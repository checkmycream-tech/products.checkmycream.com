      <li>Best money spent on perfume to date.</li>
      <li>Arrived super fast, smells and taste great.</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t strong at all.</li>

      <li>Keep sexy and fresh for that moment he kisses your neck.</li>
      <li>Fun for couples everywhere :)</li>
      <li>I was so excited to find it on amazon.</li>
      <li>Well worth the purchase!</li>
      <li>I looked at the picture and thought wow all of that for only 7 bucks that&#x27;s a great deal!  </li>
      <li>Saving it for a special date.</li>
      <li>It smells good but the smell is gone instantly.</li>
      <li>Still.. Delish.. Very Kissable even after smell is gone ;&#x3D;)</li>
      <li>Because really it is for him more than me</li>
      <li>This is good for edible kisses only.</li>
      <li>I have ordered this purfume at least three times from diffrent sellers it never disappoints, It is a fresh frangrance, that reminds me of the wonderful time i had in hawaii!</li>
      <li>and I received it in about 3 days- very fast delivery!</li>
      <li>It smells and tastes wonderful and doesn&#x27;t leave any sort of weird residue, so it&#x27;s comfortable to wear.</li>
      <li>It also adds a lot of fun to the bedroom.</li>
      <li>I bought this for something fun and flirty.</li>
      <li>well a long story short, I found it for $16, through Amazon, that was more like it, I was so glad that I was able to get it for her</li>
      <li>and they were right.</li>
      <li>I wish it lasted longer, because I would definitely buy more as it would be my new favorite fragrance.</li>
      <li>i only got 1 and it smells great, but i only got 1 bottel.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s scent wears off rather quickly, but at this price I can use as much as I&#x27;d like :0)</li>
      <li>Shipping is super high!</li>
      <li>I would love to get the entire taste collection by jessica simpson.</li>
      <li>just need my boyfriends approval to see how much he likes it!</li>
      <li>REGULARLY ALWAYS PLEASED</li>
      <li>So I first bought this ages ago at Sephoria</li>
      <li>AND IT TASTES FUNNY.</li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>Great product though for a little extra something.</li>
      <li>well that&#x27;s way to much for my budget, then I was told it was $25.</li>
      <li>My guy loves it just as much.</li>
      <li>And like others said- its somewhat oily and sticks to the skin better than other sprays.  </li>
      <li>It is also a good size and can a little goes a long way.</li>
      <li>and I have very sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Sticky when you first put it on , taste last for hours.</li>
      <li>The taste is similar to cupcakes or vanilla pudding and is very yummy to \\&quot;kiss\\&quot; off of any \\&quot;area\\&quot; you wish.</li>
      <li>I was looking for a good flirty perfume that isn&#x27;t too expensive.</li>
      <li>It can be hard to find because it is not just available in any store.</li>
      <li>Barely any scent</li>
      <li>Just be careful not to spray too much of the Pink Sugar or you might get a headache (although I am rather sensitive to these things)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d recommend letting it set on your skin for a little while before &amp;#34;testing it out&amp;#34; though because it is a little strong.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I sprayed this in my shy parts that don&#x27;t like to see anyone but ny Love...and He said I tasted like liquorish :) it has a light fragrance, but remember its more about the lickable flavor. But it has a tropical scent and sweeter taste. Fun for couples everywhere :)</li>
    <li> I looked at the picture and thought wow all of that for only 7 bucks that&#x27;s a great deal!  I bought it some of it was for me but some was for my mom on her anniversary! i only got 1 and it smells great, but i only got 1 bottel. Shipping is super high!</li>
    <li> I have had a bottle of this for the past 6 years and have used it sparingly because I thought it was discontinued. I bought it at Claires but I heard they stopped selling it there because the store is aimed at teens and....well....this is a sexy perfume! Now that I have found it here I just might have to use it much more often. The taste is similar to cupcakes or vanilla pudding and is very yummy to \\&quot;kiss\\&quot; off of any \\&quot;area\\&quot; you wish. I did not have any issues with sensitivity.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a good flirty perfume that isn&#x27;t too expensive. I came across this and read the reviews and they were right. It tastes great and smells so good. I could wear it everyday. My boyfriend usually doesn&#x27;t give my perfumes a 5 star but he said this was the first that he actually liked it. It isn&#x27;t strong at all. But I bought this on ebay for 10.00 because I was comparing prices. I would recommend it for women &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I enjoyed using it. I was not irritated in any way and I have very sensitive skin. It is also a good size and can a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I cannot say enough about this product. If you have allergy&#x27;s or are prone to getting headaches or skin irritation this is the perfume for you! I mean.... It&#x27;s edible! or Kissable.... Arrived super fast, smells and taste great. I sprayed some on my cheek and told my son to give me a peck and then lick his lips. (lol) It was so cute. He loved it and his face was priceless. I didn&#x27;t break out either, no headaches, and has not affected anyone&#x27;s allergies. Best money spent on perfume to date. It&#x27;s scent wears off rather quickly, but at this price I can use as much as I&#x27;d like :0) Can&#x27;t wait to try it on my honey to see what he thinks about it too! :-) Saving it for a special date. This will definitely be a great way to put someone in the mood. I also purchased Pink Sugar by Aqualina. I think these two will match perfectly. One for clothes and hair to have a scent that lasts longer without making your skin taste bad and another for your body. Just be careful not to spray too much of the Pink Sugar or you might get a headache (although I am rather sensitive to these things) good luck to ya!</li>
    <li> Barely any scent and it&#x27;s so called flavor was yucky!  I ended up throwing it away. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I&#x27;d recommend letting it set on your skin for a little while before &amp;#34;testing it out&amp;#34; though because it is a little strong. Great product though for a little extra something.</li>
    <li> This product was great. It smells and tastes wonderful and doesn&#x27;t leave any sort of weird residue, so it&#x27;s comfortable to wear. It also adds a lot of fun to the bedroom. ;)</li>
    <li> Yum... Smells Incredible.. BUT Smell only stays about 10 minutes (On a Good Day).. Still.. Delish.. Very Kissable even after smell is gone ;&#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s just say my man loves it!;) best product ever! Smells great tastes even better! It&#x27;s not sticky or oily and the sent and taste stays for hours after having it kissed and licked off!! 👍👍👍👌👌👌👌</li>
    <li> Smells and tastes awful</li>
    <li> Tastes yucky !!! And leaves you sticky . Boyfriend didn&#x27;t like either . Sorry Jessica, missed the mark this time.</li>
    <li> So I first bought this ages ago at Sephoria but Jessica Simpson stopped selling it there. My boyfriend loved it because it lasts through just about everything. Seriously, I put it on and sprayed all over and we went out for his birthday to a smokey bar. not to be crass but he was soo happy that I didn&#x27;t taste like a smokey bar when we went to bed.</li>
    <li> Oh my gosh I just loved this spray! So yummy. My guy loves it just as much.</li>
    <li> Sticky when you first put it on , taste last for hours.</li>
    <li> Okay.... Not the greatest.</li>
    <li> Wore this finally and it drove my guy nuts, he kept asking what was it and I will never tell…its my secret. I use this for the taste not the smell, I wear another fragrance for smell. This is good for edible kisses only.</li>
    <li> I bought Taste for my daughter for Christmas, she got it for her birthday one year &amp; she has been asking for it every since.  She loves the kissable fragrance &amp; the fact that you can taste it. I searched every where &amp; seem like no one had it. I was told this sold for $40, well that&#x27;s way to much for my budget, then I was told it was $25. well a long story short, I found it for $16, through Amazon, that was more like it, I was so glad that I was able to get it for her, it made her Christmas. Wished I had bought her 2, but then there is always her birthday.  : )</li>
    <li> This scent does not last at all.  Not worth 5 cents.  It smells good but the smell is gone instantly.</li>
    <li> I LOVE the way this perfume smells, but it seems to wear off VERY quickly. I wish it lasted longer, because I would definitely buy more as it would be my new favorite fragrance.</li>
    <li> IT SMELLS GOOD, SMELLS LIKE VANILLA. BUT ME AND MY BOYFRIEND TASTED IT AND IT TASTES FUNNY. WE DID NOT LIKE THE TASTE. ITS KINDA LIKE YOU CAN TASTE THE CHEMICALS OF THE PERFUME OR SOMETHING. THIS WILL BE USED AS A PERFUME.</li>
    <li> Perfect! Smells an tastes great!</li>
    <li> I like it, smells great. Only bad thing is it leaves a sticky residue where you spray it. 😳</li>
    <li> Another great one to have in your bathroom after a shower. Keep sexy and fresh for that moment he kisses your neck.</li>
    <li> FAVORITE FRAGRANCE BUY FROM HERE REGULARLY ALWAYS PLEASED</li>
    <li> Bought and a gift for someone and they loved it!</li>
    <li> I have ordered this purfume at least three times from diffrent sellers it never disappoints, It is a fresh frangrance, that reminds me of the wonderful time i had in hawaii! I have just ordered two one for me and my mother. This is our favorite scent. It doesnt last on the body as long as i would have hoped for. But still wonderful product. It can be hard to find because it is not just available in any store. I wish that they hadnt disconitued this frangrance. I would love to get the entire taste collection by jessica simpson. If you havent smelled it yet! its heavenly, and you can actually eat it which i have not tried doing. lol!!  But if you spray yourself and you happen to get some up your nose or in your mouth is good to know that you can eat it. I spray librly to my body this fragrance and it is wonderful get it!!</li>
    <li> Smells and tastes amazing. Love this stuff.</li>
    <li> First off I have to say that the seller is great!  I ordered one, I got confirmation that it was delivered  but I never received it (but not the sellers fault).  When I emailed them to let them know they sent out another one the next day with no problems and I received it in about 3 days- very fast delivery! This smells soooo good- reminds me of summer day at the beach...Also taste good too ;)  And like others said- its somewhat oily and sticks to the skin better than other sprays.  I would of given 5 stars but the smell doesn&#x27;t seem to last long at all.</li>
    <li> Was pleased when I tried it on and licked it  I would purchase again  just need my boyfriends approval to see how much he likes it! Because really it is for him more than me</li>
    <li> This perfume smells nice and lasts waay longer than her body sprays. Arrived before it was supposed to and couldn&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> I bought this for something fun and flirty. It tastes gross and smells gross. I am really disappointed. Most of Jessica Simpsons stuff is really nice. Don&#x27;t know where she went wrong with this one. I literally just tossed it.</li>
    <li> This is a product we found years ago at Rite Aid or some other Pharmacy like that. When the one we had ran out I was every disappointed I could not find it in any stores. I was so excited to find it on amazon. Well worth the purchase!</li>
