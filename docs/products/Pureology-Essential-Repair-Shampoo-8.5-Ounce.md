<li> Doesn&#x27;t leave my scalp dry, leaves my hair silky and soft.</li>
<li> I received this shampoo and it was clearly watered down.</li>
<li> I have processed blond highlights in my hair, so it is dry and moderately damaged.</li>
<li> My hair is dry, damaged and frizzy in the summer and this helped bring my hair back to life.</li>
<li> The whip is a must with this, as this shampoo will &amp;#34;strip&amp;#34; all product build up and leave your hair feeling dry.  </li>
<li> Not only is it sulfate-free, but a little goes a long way.</li>
<li> I have problems with breakouts on my scalp, with other shampoos.</li>
<li> Other shampoos have caused my head to itch, flake and have sores.  </li>
<li> Usually, I will feel build-up and my hair will begin to feel coarse, but not with Pureology.  </li>
<li> Once (air) dried, it felt dry and was frizzy.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s expensive, but it lathers really well</li>
<li> This shampoo appears to have been watered down.</li>
<li> and I did not like it at all, coated my hair and weighed it down without even helping with frizz.  </li>
<li> The bottle was half smashed and all over&lt;br /&gt;the inside of the box.</li>
<li> Watered down!</li>
<li> I would call ordinary or not worth the money.  </li>
<li> This particular  formula seemed to tangle and make my hair very difficult to comb through, out of the shower.</li>
<li> Usually the shampoo is of a thicker consistency.</li>
<li> Unfortunately, Pureology has discontinued this Essential Repair line.</li>
<li> order arrived in a poorly sealed shipping box and there was no seal over&lt;br /&gt;the cap, which is typical for &amp;#34;New&amp;#34;.</li>
<li> It is a thick shampoo.</li>
<li> This product was blatantly watered down....have been using this shampoo for years</li>
<li> Just the wrong product for me.</li>
<li> Unfortunately I did not learn this until I opened it a couple of months after ordering so cannot return.</li>
<li> I am shocked and disappointed and won&#x27;t buy from this seller again.</li>
<li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for years. It is a thick shampoo. The one I just got here is so watery. I am shocked and disappointed and won&#x27;t buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Was runny when it arrived</li>
    <li> IT IS THE BEST SHAMPOO I HAVE USED - GENTLE ON MY HAIR, PLEASANT SMELLING, AND HAIR SEEMS TO HAVE A SHINE (WHICH AS I GET OLDER I HAVE BEEN LOSING). THANK YOU</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo for my hair which tends to get curly/wavey in humid weather. It helps to calm the frizz. Although Suave keratin infusion works well and is 1/2 the price. I stay with Pureology since they do not test on animals.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is the best for helping freshly processed hair bounce back.  I have lots of fine, wavy long-layered hair that is 30% gray with color and highlights done every 3-4 months.  Unfortunately, Pureology has discontinued this Essential Repair line. The recommended &amp;#34;replacement&amp;#34; line is their Strength Cure.  I tried that shampoo and I did not like it at all, coated my hair and weighed it down without even helping with frizz.  I will be taking that new shampoo back, using this oldie but goodie until I can find a suitable replacement.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo based on a recommendation from a hair stylist and she was spot on! My hair is dry, damaged and frizzy in the summer and this helped bring my hair back to life. Not only does it strengthen your hair but it smells really nice too. A little pricey, which is why I&#x27;m giving it a 4, but well worth it.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. Not only is it sulfate-free, but a little goes a long way. I have been using Pureology Essential Repair for almost two years and won&#x27;t use anything else. It leaves my hair silky and shiny, while protecting my color.</li>
    <li> My favorite shampoo---great price.  Arrived right on time just as ordered.  Perfecto!  I love this product to pieces and am so glad I found it on Amazon at such a fabulous price.</li>
    <li> I have problems with breakouts on my scalp, with other shampoos. With this shampoo, that doesn&#x27;t happen. I love it and my hair feels and looks healthy.</li>
    <li> Watered down! What a scam!!</li>
    <li> This product was in very good condition.  It came very quickly and as advertised in the photograph and caption.  I recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I thought this was the Pureology product that my beautician recommended. I have processed blond highlights in my hair, so it is dry and moderately damaged. This particular  formula seemed to tangle and make my hair very difficult to comb through, out of the shower. Once (air) dried, it felt dry and was frizzy. I had to use A LOT of CHI silk infusion to get it under control. Then switched to &#x27;It&#x27;s a 10&#x27;, and have been much happier.&#x27; Just the wrong product for me.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair, color upon color, and this product repairs fantastically!&lt;br /&gt;Problem with the packaging.....&lt;br /&gt;My order arrived in a poorly sealed shipping box and there was no seal over&lt;br /&gt;the cap, which is typical for &amp;#34;New&amp;#34;. The bottle was half smashed and all over&lt;br /&gt;the inside of the box. Amazon was great and refunded.</li>
    <li> All their products excel.  I haven&#x27;t used any I would call ordinary or not worth the money.  Try them yourselves.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Complete fan of Pureology. I love this product and it smells the best out of the whole line of shampoos. This is my go to shampoo and I love how it makes my hair feel so lustrous and soft. Unfortunately, they replaced it with another product that has even more distinct chemical smell. I think I will switch shampoos once I can&#x27;t find Pureology Repair shampoo anymore...</li>
    <li> Great product!  Takes only a tiny bit, so it&#x27;s cost effective, as well as being very good for your hair!</li>
    <li> Excellent product.You don&#x27;t have to use much of it for it to be effective.</li>
    <li> This was my first time purchasing the shampoo from this seller. Usually the shampoo is of a thicker consistency. I received this shampoo and it was clearly watered down. It was runny and drips right our of my hand from the bottle. I will not purchase from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave my scalp dry, leaves my hair silky and soft. I am a daily washer, I get a professional permanent color treatment of very dark chocolately brown with mahogany low lights and platinum high lights this shampoo preserves my hair color beautifully.</li>
    <li> I use this along with the hair whip once a week.  It completely strips your hair of product build up.  The whip is a must with this, as this shampoo will &amp;#34;strip&amp;#34; all product build up and leave your hair feeling dry.  But it is worth every penny and keeps my hair healthy!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo; it lathers well yet as no sulfates.  I alternate this with Redken shampoo for color-treated hair.  I also like the Pureology leave- in spray.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo because it is gentle on my fine, thin hair. Most shampoos make my scalp irritated but not this one. It&#x27;s expensive, but it lathers really well so it lasts. I also like the way it smells (like oats).</li>
    <li> Honestly after i have used this shampoo my hair feels soft but not completely clean. The hydrating shampoo, and smooth shampoo are better.</li>
    <li> This does provide SOME color protection, though I always would prefer more. It cleans thoroughly and washes out easily and cleanly, leaving my hair easy to style and feeling nice.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my daughter and she swears by this product.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier. Can&#x27;t find it in the stores anymore so glad I could find it online.</li>
    <li> This shampoo appears to have been watered down. It isn&#x27;t the same consistency as what you get from the hair salon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for over a year now and my hair feels great.  Usually, I will feel build-up and my hair will begin to feel coarse, but not with Pureology.  I also like that it&#x27;s sulfate free.</li>
    <li> Been using this for years...hope I never have to use anything else.  Other shampoos have caused my head to itch, flake and have sores.  I am NOT allergic to this shampoo!!  And, it smells great.</li>
    <li> This product was blatantly watered down....have been using this shampoo for years and I know what the consistency should be. This was literally watery. Unfortunately I did not learn this until I opened it a couple of months after ordering so cannot return.</li>
