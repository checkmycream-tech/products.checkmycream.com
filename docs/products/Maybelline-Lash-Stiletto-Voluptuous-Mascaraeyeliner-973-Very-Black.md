      <li>This is simply the best mascara I have ever used!  </li>
      <li>but when I opened the mascara it didn&#x27;t have any of the liquid all over the top</li>

      <li>Goes on smoothly (both of them).</li>
      <li>I think we have a reasonable right to expect to get what we want, even at a good price.</li>
      <li>Worth the price!</li>
      <li>Well worth the money for just ONE of the items easily.</li>
      <li>She loves it, and says it is ez to clean off at night.</li>
      <li>The company is also great and they shipped the product before the expected time.</li>
      <li>Item arrived in good quality and buyer sent it promptly, however I don&#x27;t actually like the Maybelline product.</li>
      <li>The mascara is decent, not my favorite</li>
      <li>I received this two days after ordering it and was very surprised it came so fast, when i tried the  product i was very satisfied with the results.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Works really well!!</li>
      <li>Sounded like a great deal...too good to be true, Im afraid.</li>
      <li>I recently bought the Falsies  Waterproof Mascara from Maybelline looking for an amazing look of my lashes but was dissapointed.</li>
      <li>I bought this bundle for $4.50, not expecting much out of it since it was so cheap.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d say is worth the $4.50 and</li>
      <li>These were obviously sold at a great price because they were OLD.</li>
      <li>Im glad I only ordered one and did not waste any more money.</li>
      <li>I got an extremely good deal so it is not worth returning.</li>
      <li>the product was kind of dry when i recieved it ....</li>
      <li>Possibly an item better when bought &amp;#34;fresh.&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>This is my first choice when picking mascara.  </li>
      <li>Ladies can never have too much mascara or eyeliner products!</li>
      <li>The tip is not the most confortable, it makes it hard to apply, but the product is ok, and I would buy it again.</li>
      <li>It really was&lt;br</li>
      <li>Fast Shipping.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love lash stiletto mascara.  It is amazing.  This is my first choice when picking mascara.  It makes my eyes look divine!</li>
    <li> Works really well!! recommend to anyone with short eyelashes like mine.&lt;br /&gt;the eyeliner is also nice I use it everyday!</li>
    <li> this was the best Mascara/eyeliner  i ever bought and loved the price...i esp loved the Mascara and how it looked on my eyelashes. they looked bigger and longer.</li>
    <li> The stick of the eyeliner was broken and also the mascara seemed old and a bit dried out. I got an extremely good deal so it is not worth returning.</li>
    <li> I mean mascara is mascara...as long as it goes on well without clumping and looks natural with staying power.  I comes off well without tearing out you lashes which is important for me also. I have used better but it works well 4 out of 5.</li>
    <li> Came in good condition works my favorite product. Always use it going to purchase it again. Thank. Its lasting me a month (:</li>
    <li> Maybelline has some great eye makeup!  This stuff goes on nicely, lasts, and looks great!  The price was really good too!</li>
    <li> I was not impressed with this! I typically use this type of makeup and my eyeline was broken in several places and the mascara was DRY. I mean REAL dry!! Possibly an item better when bought &amp;#34;fresh.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Perfect in package.Just doesn&#x27;t work for me as far as volume- wanted larger volume in lashes, and it does a good job for just plain ole mascara</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s a lot to like about this inexpensive mascara:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. This is a lengthening formula (makes lashes look longer) but also has a brush with dense bristles to add some volume.&lt;br /&gt;2. The color is very dark black&lt;br /&gt;3. You can control the end of the brush to hit the little lashes at the ends of your eyelids.&lt;br /&gt;4. comes with an eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;5. At this price, if you like this formula, you can stock up and throw out your mascara on a monthly basis. Mascara gets contaminated with bacteria from the air and from touching your eyelid, and even though there is preservative in it, eventually you should toss it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do toss my mascara monthly and I don&#x27;t like spending a lot--even drugstores now charge over five a pop. This is a very good value. Not the best mascara I&#x27;ve used (for the price, that would be L&#x27;Oreal Voluminous) but this is quite acceptable. Bottom line: if you want an inexpensive mascara that lengthens and is a dark black, this is a good choice.</li>
    <li> I bought four of these when they were $2.95...such an awesome deal! Well worth the money for just ONE of the items easily.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as part of my niece&#x27;s Christmas gift and she loves it.  She says it leaves her lashes long and thicker.  She highly recommends it.</li>
    <li> I use both the eyeliner and the mascara on a regular basis. The brush and mascara are awesome, and the eyeliner is too, haha. I&#x27;m probably going to order more soon, at the store this deal is like $10! I ordered this for like $4 on here!</li>
    <li> My lashes look darker, but appear to have even less volume than if I don&#x27;t wear any mascara at all. Will probably not buy this again.</li>
    <li> i didn&#x27;t even have to curl my eye lashes with this mascara! it made them look full and super long,, the eyeliner is really black i really like it it feels like it&#x27;s gel, liked this duo</li>
    <li> was to be a Christmas Gift, but my daughter saw it in the mailbox. She loves it, and says it is ez to clean off at night.</li>
    <li> Now I already have pretty long lashes but they aren&#x27;t very dark.  This mascara is INCREDIBLE!!  It makes my lashes look amazing.  Super long and nice and dark.  I have gotten sooo many compliments on my lashes since I started using this stuff.  Best mascara ever!!!  And the added bonus...the eyeliner.  Goes on nice and smooth.  I recommend this duo HIGHLY!</li>
    <li> This is simply the best mascara I have ever used!  And the combo pack is great too!  I usually use a different brand of eyeliner, but I use this eyeliner as backup.  I keep this eyeliner in my purse for the last minute touchups and its perfect!</li>
    <li> I love these products! Ladies can never have too much mascara or eyeliner products! I love the wand on the mascara and I love the color!</li>
    <li> This is what I love a great product which everybody knows  and likes at a perfect low price! Use it everyday! love it!</li>
    <li> I bought this bundle for $4.50, not expecting much out of it since it was so cheap. The mascara is decent, not my favorite but it does the job. I personally love the eyeliner, it glides on nicely, nice color, the eyeliner itself I&#x27;d say is worth the $4.50 and the mascara is just a bonus.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this product is too old but this has been the only maybelline product I&#x27;m dissatisfied with. The eyeliner went bonkers after one use and mascara is useless.</li>
    <li> the product was kind of dry when i recieved it .... so that didnt make me too happy. umm my lashes clumed up kind of. so also did not make me too happy. (mascara) but besides that it made my lashes look fuller witch i loved. okay the eyeline is not all that good !! i had to go over my lash line twice to get a decent black line... if you are trying to get the cat eye look it WILL NOT work with this eyeliner because it does get a round point . maybe if you try real hard ? so yea i probably would buy it again because it is a good deal. i saw this sold on walmarts website for 14 dollars a couple weeks ago so compar 14 to about 3 dollars... um of course the 3 dollars !! maybe someone will get more lucky when they purchase it.</li>
    <li> I received this two days after ordering it and was very surprised it came so fast, when i tried the  product i was very satisfied with the results.&lt;br /&gt;  the liner that came with it stays put and was a great deal!!</li>
    <li> Linger last long time and mascara really lengthins ur eye lashes beautifully!! I Will definitly be buying these items again!!!</li>
    <li> I got this for my daughter, she doesn&#x27;t use eye liner so I tried it, It Is The Best Eye Liner I Have Ever Used, It Stays where I put it and Doesn&#x27;t give me the Racoon Look at the end of the day :)</li>
    <li> This is a great mascara I love it. The eyeliner got dry and broke but It could just be I didnt put the lid back on. Worth the price!</li>
    <li> I recently bought the Falsies  Waterproof Mascara from Maybelline looking for an amazing look of my lashes but was dissapointed. I was hoping this macara (THE LASH STILETTO) would add volume and make my eyes look great, and I must say it does. The tip is not the most confortable, it makes it hard to apply, but the product is ok, and I would buy it again. I do recommend this a lot!</li>
    <li> Clumpy, dry, doesn&#x27;t go on well, etc...&lt;br /&gt;do not buy this mascara. It really was&lt;br /&gt;a disappointment since I do like Maybelline&lt;br /&gt;products.</li>
    <li> Like tha picture BUT the mascara its bad, i hate it ( El rimel no funciona bien, no suben las pestañas con el muy desepcionada )</li>
    <li> I have used both of these products before and been happy with them. These were obviously sold at a great price because they were OLD. Both of them were dried out and impossible to use. Caveat emptor!</li>
    <li> This mascara creates a dramatic but not overly dramtic look. It makes my eyelases appear false in a good way. The eyeliner is also great. It is waterproof like advertised.</li>
    <li> I received the product way earlier than the estimated shipping date, which was great! However, the package was damaged and not sealed ( the mascara and eyeliner were not just in the envelope with the back paper in there looking like it was ripped open). I worried that the product may have been used but when I opened the mascara it didn&#x27;t have any of the liquid all over the top so I decided that it probably wasn&#x27;t used and chose to keep it. However, the brush was very dry, there isn&#x27;t a lot of liquid in the mascara tube. Moreover, no matter how many coats I applied, the mascara does not lengthe. It simply coats your eyelashes with black liquid. Over applying it won&#x27;t give add any length or volume to your eyelashes, it will just keep coating them and end up clumping. I am very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara and this made me love the eyeliner. Goes on smoothly (both of them). If you want long lashes this is the mascara to buy. No irritation. No flaking. The eyeliner didn&#x27;t rub or make me look like a raccoon after a long day. The seller was great. Fast Shipping. Came in new condition. Eyeliner is a little hard to take off but I like the eyeliner from last night look.</li>
    <li> I dont normally wear mascara but i will now,i absolutly loved this brand and the eye liner too Ty so much</li>
    <li> Im glad I only ordered one and did not waste any more money. It was old, dried and clumped up.  Sounded like a great deal...too good to be true, Im afraid.</li>
    <li> THIS IS A GREAT BUY. THE MASCARA IS WONDERFUL.LOOKS JUST FANTASTIC. GREAT PENCIL.THIS IS THE THIRD TIME I GOTTEN THIS SET..</li>
    <li> love love love love love love the mascara it works great and makes my lashes SUPER long the eyeliner is great too very long lasting</li>
    <li> Great product and great price. The company is also great and they shipped the product before the expected time. I will recommend this for future purchases.</li>
    <li> Item arrived in good quality and buyer sent it promptly, however I don&#x27;t actually like the Maybelline product. Others may disagree, but I left it made me eyelashes spider like...not the best look.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara, it is a great product.  Does not clump and makes your lashes look amazing.  I love the eyeliner except it was broken from shipment.  Altogether a great product.</li>
    <li> liner keeps breaking off mascara goes on messy&lt;br /&gt;messy not the best but does the trick for a quickie makup</li>
    <li> I received the product within 3 days to FL, the price was good and those are the highlights. The product is obviously old and a bit dried out. It went on a little clumpy and took a little work to get it to look good but it works, just hoped for not slightly dried out mascara. Also, the package seems to have been previously opened (but with shipping who knows-so I don&#x27;t want to say for sure). Next time I will just spend the $3-$4 extra and go to the store where it might not have sat AS LONG. I think we have a reasonable right to expect to get what we want, even at a good price.</li>
