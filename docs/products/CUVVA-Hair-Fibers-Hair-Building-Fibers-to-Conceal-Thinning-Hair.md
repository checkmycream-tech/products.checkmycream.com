### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>have medium brown hair and bought medium brown and it matches perfectly.  </li>
      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>Awesome.</li>
      <li>Have to tell you that this product works every bit as well as Caboki to hide bald spots (and Caboki works wonderfully).  </li>
      <li>A very good product.</li>
      <li>Incredible.</li>
      <li>and I LOVE it!!  </li>
      <li>but the results are amazing!</li>
      <li>good quality hair fibers.</li>
      <li>It is good.</li>
      <li>It worked great and gave the impression of thicker, more layered hair.</li>
      <li>I love it!  </li>
      <li>It came and I told him to prep as specified and the immediate result was amazing.  </li>
      <li>My grandmother has since tried it on her own and is as equally thrilled.</li>
      <li>I used it to make my own 3D eyelash mascara.  </li>
      <li>I am thrilled with this Hair Concealer.</li>
      <li>It really covers up my bald spots, and the auburn color is perfect for me.</li>
      <li>I received this product for review and inspection purposes and my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
      <li>I based this review on my honest opinion.</li>
      <li>I have received this product without charge to write an honest review, I have received no instruction and the opinions expressed are my own.</li>
      <li>but it&#x60;s better quallity.</li>
      <li>Looks 100% authentic, even when the person is about an inch from your head.</li>
      <li>Received this product recently and was really impressed with the results.</li>
      <li>I may even like this a bit more than Caboki as Caboki has changed the shape of their container (shaker) to a thinner model and</li>
      <li>Not only conceals any developing bald spots, but blends in perfectly with existing hair.</li>
      <li>The fibers hold better than toppik as well.</li>
      <li>well satisfied with the coverage and confidence this provides.</li>
      <li>Great product it definitely works, I love it</li>
      <li>It easily washes out and I have had no reactions from this concealer.</li>
      <li>He doesn&#x27;t wear it every day since it&#x27;s just a thinning spot and he doesn&#x27;t want people at work to think he got something done, but for special occasions we make sure he&#x27;s got it packed...</li>
      <li>I helped her apply the product the first time, and can honestly say that it did not look &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; and blended in well.  </li>
      <li>I love it because it&#x27;s quick and so easy to use.</li>
      <li>However,  I will say it works great for the use I intended it for which is similar to the hair fill in idea.  </li>
      <li>Bottom line, both this is and Caboki are great products which work well, but are very over-priced considering how much they probably cost to manufacture.  </li>
      <li>and I was pleased with how well it filled in his bald spots from the pillows he sleeps on ;-)</li>
      <li>They are easy to use (follow included instructions), and worked very well to fill-in scalp spaces.</li>
      <li>He was very much against any sort of spray or powder or anything like this product</li>
      <li>thanks!</li>
      <li>I used this for the first time today</li>
      <li>Instant gratification, so easy and exactly the result I was hoping for in a shaker fiber solution.  </li>
      <li>That said, they are still worth the price to me as nothing quite looks as natural and hides baldness as well.</li>
      <li>was a very close match to her hair color.  </li>
      <li>He pulled a total 180 and agreed that it was a fantastic, temporary solution.  </li>
      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>Ok so I must admit I am not balding or in much need of this product for anything other than cosmetic purposes.  </li>
      <li>but the the color iz more dark that i desired.</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing, I&#x27;m getting a little thin on the top and this stuff makes me look like I have a full head of hair.</li>
      <li>I am a female with thinning hair, esp on the top front, which is very obvious when I wear it in a pony tail.  </li>
      <li>#34;okay now that you&#x27;ve seen it, let&#x27;s work on it.&amp;#34;  I wanted to get something that would be a more immediate fix, albeit temporary, for a few events we had coming up</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t too sure how well this stuff would work (I have long hair that I keep pulled back in a ponytail)</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t take very much to fill in the thinning spot towards the back of my head and it holds up well.</li>
      <li>I pressed it down as instructed,  then lightly sprayed my hair with hair spray as mentioned in one of the reviews.  </li>
      <li>My partner has a spot on the back of his head where his hair is thinning that reveals itself pretty obviously in direct sunlight or in flash photos.</li>
      <li>but they&#x27;re charging nearly $17 to deliver.  </li>
      <li>Wow ...</li>
      <li>at least until we find a more permanent fix.</li>
      <li>My girlfriend says it looks natural</li>
      <li>Not sure if any of you have seen such a thing but its really the same as this stuff except you get A WHOLE LOT more lash extending fibers for about 10 bucks less.  </li>
      <li>the texture of it is almost the exact same as dry shampoo which also helps to add a bit of volume.  </li>
      <li>I especially like the small travel size, which is easy to aim and pour.</li>
      <li>I did have a little fun and used some on my 2yr olds</li>
      <li>and we&#x27;re working on natural treatments to actually help with regrowth.  </li>
      <li>So glad I thought of this before I spent all that money on one small tube of mascara!  </li>
      <li>and I was pretty stunned that this spot vanished with only a few shakes.</li>

    <li> Instant gratification, so easy and exactly the result I was hoping for in a shaker fiber solution.  Wishing for a lighter color, but well satisfied with the coverage and confidence this provides.</li>
    <li> I used this for the first time today and I LOVE it!!  I am a female with thinning hair, esp on the top front, which is very obvious when I wear it in a pony tail.  Well, today was the test.  I pulled my hair up and sprinkled the product on my scalp.  Wow ... it seemed to work.  I pressed it down as instructed,  then lightly sprayed my hair with hair spray as mentioned in one of the reviews.  I then went to an hour long crossfit class and sweat. I was paranoid and kept wiping my head.  When I left the class, I checked my car mirror and was not sweating brown, thank goodness.  I then went to a trail and walked in the sun for over an hour.  When I got home, I checked again and the product was still in place.  I brushed my hair and re-did my pony tail.  Still, no bald spot and product stayed in place.  I will definitely buy this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have medium brown hair and bought medium brown and it matches perfectly.  I feel like I used a lot, so I&#x27;ll see how long it lasts.  I will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Awesome. Not only conceals any developing bald spots, but blends in perfectly with existing hair. Looks 100% authentic, even when the person is about an inch from your head.</li>

    <li> Works like a charm! Thx!</li>
    <li> good quality hair fibers. I already have several hair fibers. but it&#x60;s better quallity. thanks</li>
    <li> he feeling of youthful. A very good product.</li>
    <li> Great product it definitely works, I love it</li>
    <li> Incredible. My husband&#x27;s hair is growed up.</li>
    <li> I had been telling my husband about a thinning spot that he never chose to pay attention to it or take me seriously until he saw a picture where he was standing in the background and you could see it.  He immediately had to find a mirror so he could try to get a look at it but was unable to so I took a picture for him.  Needless to say he went into an immediate funk and I said, &amp;#34;okay now that you&#x27;ve seen it, let&#x27;s work on it.&amp;#34;  I wanted to get something that would be a more immediate fix, albeit temporary, for a few events we had coming up and we&#x27;re working on natural treatments to actually help with regrowth.  He was very much against any sort of spray or powder or anything like this product but I had a gift card and saw the reviews so I figured that if I bought it and it was in the house, he would at least let me test it out on him.  It came and I told him to prep as specified and the immediate result was amazing.  My husband kept making me take pictures from different angles and was kept looking in the mirror in disbelief.  You couldn&#x27;t tell the difference between where it was and wasn&#x27;t applied at all and the texture of it is almost the exact same as dry shampoo which also helps to add a bit of volume.  He pulled a total 180 and agreed that it was a fantastic, temporary solution.  He doesn&#x27;t wear it every day since it&#x27;s just a thinning spot and he doesn&#x27;t want people at work to think he got something done, but for special occasions we make sure he&#x27;s got it packed... at least until we find a more permanent fix.</li>
    <li> They are easy to use (follow included instructions), and worked very well to fill-in scalp spaces.</li>
    <li> I am thrilled with this Hair Concealer. It really covers up my bald spots, and the auburn color is perfect for me. I especially like the small travel size, which is easy to aim and pour. I tried the spray device&#x27;s before and they don&#x27;t work as well as this. It easily washes out and I have had no reactions from this concealer. I love it because it&#x27;s quick and so easy to use. This is defiantly recommend. I based this review on my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t too sure how well this stuff would work (I have long hair that I keep pulled back in a ponytail) but the results are amazing! My girlfriend says it looks natural and I agree. It doesn&#x27;t take very much to fill in the thinning spot towards the back of my head and it holds up well.</li>
    <li> Received this product recently and was really impressed with the results. My partner has a spot on the back of his head where his hair is thinning that reveals itself pretty obviously in direct sunlight or in flash photos. We tried this out and I was pretty stunned that this spot vanished with only a few shakes. He has dirty blonde hair but we used the dark brown color to cover his spot. It worked great and gave the impression of thicker, more layered hair. It lasted all day. Great product!</li>
    <li> I got the CUVVA product for my grandmother to try for her thinning hair. She colors her hair and the medium brown was a very close match to her hair color.  The product was very simple to use, it came on like a powder and created an illusion of fuller and thicker hair, while hiding the thinning areas. I helped her apply the product the first time, and can honestly say that it did not look &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; and blended in well.  My grandmother has since tried it on her own and is as equally thrilled. I received this product for review and inspection purposes and my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> This works for where my hair is thinning in the front.</li>
    <li> It is good. but the the color iz more dark that i desired. thanks!</li>
    <li> Got this on sale for $19 after I noticed it when I was reordering Caboki, so I figured why not give it a try?  Have to tell you that this product works every bit as well as Caboki to hide bald spots (and Caboki works wonderfully).  I may even like this a bit more than Caboki as Caboki has changed the shape of their container (shaker) to a thinner model and this wider shaker seems to be easier to spread out the fibers.  My only issue is that the product is now back up to around $35, which is about the same cost as on the Caboki website.  Here on Amazon, someone is selling Caboki for around $10+ but they&#x27;re charging nearly $17 to deliver.  Bottom line, both this is and Caboki are great products which work well, but are very over-priced considering how much they probably cost to manufacture.  That said, they are still worth the price to me as nothing quite looks as natural and hides baldness as well.</li>
