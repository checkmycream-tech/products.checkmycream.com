      <li>Loved it.</li>
      <li>Love these!</li>
      <li>What a fantastic design, should be mandatory for all hairstylists. :P</li>
      <li>Very strong -hold</li>
      <li>I am able to pile my hair on top of my head with one clip and it will not slip or budge until I remove it.  </li>
      <li>However, I like these clips better because it feels smoother.</li>
      <li>Love them..</li>
      <li>They seem to hold better than most ...</li>
      <li>I love how these are plastic -- so they don&#x27;t heat up and singe your hair or fingers when blowdrying&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love using these in the summer to keep the hair off my neck &amp; shoulders.  </li>
      <li>I was so pleased to find them on Amazon.</li>
      <li>They are perfect to use when sectioning your hair to color or flat iron.  </li>
      <li>These clips are perfect for sectioning hair while you blow-dry or flat iron.</li>
      <li>I own about a dozen hairclips, all claiming to be super hold, strong grip etc, but when i got these, i think, this is all i&#x27;ll ever, ever need.</li>
      <li>These are really reliable quality, as good as you can get with plastic hair clips.</li>
      <li>Easy to use and will not pull your hair out.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also really strong that it can hold a lot of hair, and believe me, I have A LOT of hair.</li>
      <li>I use these every day, and though they are awesome, do remember that they are plastic, and that the little plastic grommet that the metal pin sits in will eventually weaken and break.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few products to hold my hair up and these are the best.</li>
      <li>My hair stays secure when using them.</li>
      <li>These are really comfortable and stay wherever you clip them in your hair.</li>
      <li>A gamechanger for me!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very pleased thus far.</li>
      <li>/&gt;They are strong and really hold your hair in place!</li>
      <li>They hold a tremendous amount of hair and don&#x27;t snag or break hair as the metal clips do.</li>
      <li>I would not go as far as saying one clip will hold any amount of hair because one clip has never been able to hold all of mine.</li>
      <li>/&gt;They have also been going strong for the past 2 years, so the quality is quite good.</li>
      <li>The girls in my salon love these, no other clips hold the hair as well!</li>
      <li>They are just the right size for my shoulder-length hair &amp; I prefer them to the elastics.  </li>
      <li>I saw them at my hair stylist first</li>
      <li>They are exactly as depicted in the photo.</li>
      <li>they work great holding lots of hair, sometimes a little too big for thinner hair.</li>
      <li>The clips are plastic and have stainless steel pins so they should not rust.</li>
      <li>These clips are very sturdy; they have lasted for years.</li>
      <li>I really like these clips.</li>
      <li>but you do receive a quality product that works really well.</li>
      <li>And this is coming from a very persnickety buyer.</li>
      <li>, overall these are very good quality when not subject to harsh environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have short hair, but it&#x27;s pretty thick, and these work great to clip it into place while I&#x27;m blowdrying and flatironing my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Since they have such a powerful hold, I would bet they would work great with thin hair as well.</li>
      <li>Even I kind of lazily bunch up my hair and then throw this clip in it</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>High quality plastic and springs.</li>
      <li>The first one that broke actually snapped weirdly on my hand and hurt a little bit; I was more hurt by the fact that I would no longer be able to use my favorite clip though.</li>
      <li>So with normal use they held up quite well</li>
      <li>It would be fun if they came in different colors.</li>
      <li>They are probably overkill for shorter hair since my other clips worked fine, but I do like these two features:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Overall very sturdy clip.  </li>
      <li>As far as durability it held up well</li>
      <li>I recently got straight bangs and it was a pain to straighten them</li>
      <li>(my hair is thick, but fine).</li>
      <li>That said they are made in China (oddly a lot of their stainless DOES rust) for a company based in CA.</li>
      <li>already had some long, flat metal clips that I had bought at my local beauty supply, but I thought I&#x27;d try these out when I got my new Metropolis flat iron since the blue and white matches the flat iron (dorky, I know, but I like things to match).  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Got them for my girls. They were a bit pricey, but they are the best, and girls like them.They arrived in a timely manner. No complaints.</li>
    <li> These are the best! Very strong -hold every hair in place while you blow dry the rest. My hairdresser got them from a travelling salesman at her salon!  I was so pleased to find them on Amazon.</li>
    <li> They are exactly as depicted in the photo. I found it easier to open the bottom of the package so that I can reuse it for storage. The clips are plastic and have stainless steel pins so they should not rust. That said they are made in China (oddly a lot of their stainless DOES rust) for a company based in CA. When I compared the quality, quantity, and price, this was the best deal I found. I&#x27;m very pleased thus far.</li>

    <li> I was looking for something to make blow drying and curling my hair in sections easier, and these clips are a godsend. I&#x27;m Hispanic with tons and tons of curly hair and nothing has worked like these clips. They will hold your hair no matter what. I had a hard time with other clips sort of sliding out of my hair during styling, but these really GRIP. Even I kind of lazily bunch up my hair and then throw this clip in it, it stays in until I remove it. What a fantastic design, should be mandatory for all hairstylists. :P</li>
    <li> These crane clips really offer terrific holding power, even on thick hair, since the upper arm bends to make room for all the hair being held. I use these every day, and though they are awesome, do remember that they are plastic, and that the little plastic grommet that the metal pin sits in will eventually weaken and break. My clips have lasted 4 years before needing replacement. These are really reliable quality, as good as you can get with plastic hair clips.</li>
    <li> I recently got straight bangs and it was a pain to straighten them so I decided to get a clip to make it easier. When I decided to order these, I thought they would be uncomfortable to use because of the teeth on the upper part of the clip, but I caved because of the rave reviews. Good thing I did. These are really comfortable and stay wherever you clip them in your hair. It&#x27;s also really strong that it can hold a lot of hair, and believe me, I have A LOT of hair.

They are lightweight and also perfect for travel. I wish they were a bit less expensive but you do receive a quality product that works really well.</li>
    <li> They might be a little expensive but they do a great job ! I have thick long curly hair and they can hold and not entangle. And this is coming from a very persnickety buyer. Loved it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few products to hold my hair up and these are the best. Those cranes hold any amount of hair. It doesn&#x27;t pull or drag. Just clip and go. High quality plastic and springs. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I like the sturdiness of these hair clips. My hair stays secure when using them. It would be fun if they came in different colors.</li>
    <li> good job with this one. I own about a dozen hairclips, all claiming to be super hold, strong grip etc, but when i got these, i think, this is all i&#x27;ll ever, ever need. I like the color too, pops out. I have medium length thick hair and one clips holds it all together.</li>
    <li> I really like these clips. They hold my thick hair in place. The perfect amount of grip. I recently purchased another manufacturer&#x27;s product and the grip on them in not sufficient for my hair. These clips are very sturdy; they have lasted for years. Definitely would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Love using these in the summer to keep the hair off my neck &amp; shoulders.  They are just the right size for my shoulder-length hair &amp; I prefer them to the elastics.  They seem to hold better than most ...(my hair is thick, but fine).</li>
    <li> Love them..broke 2 of these but it works as they should be. As far as durability it held up well ( I have these clips for a long while now.  I broke two of these maybe because I was too rough on them I use some of these in the shower to clip my hair to let conditioner set on my hair before I wash with water so I think that&#x27;s what caused the breaking.  One of those metal thingy broke the plastic thing around them ( Sorry, I couldn&#x27;t come up with a better name of them).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of these clips that I assigned outside shower area to separate my hair while curling, trimming, straightening, etc are still kicking it. So with normal use they held up quite well, overall these are very good quality when not subject to harsh environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eventually I found similar  clips in Walmart and are cheaper.  However, I like these clips better because it feels smoother. But I think I&#x27;ll buy the Walmart clips to use in the shower and these for everything else.</li>
    <li> These are also know as alligator or T-Rex (looks like dinosaur teeth) clips.  I am Latina, so I have thick naturally curly hair and the basic claw clip does not hold my hair in place.  I am able to pile my hair on top of my head with one clip and it will not slip or budge until I remove it.  They are perfect to use when sectioning your hair to color or flat iron.  Easy to use and will not pull your hair out.  Since they have such a powerful hold, I would bet they would work great with thin hair as well.</li>
    <li> i am a cosmetologist, and I used these every day for 2 years before they started breaking. 3 years later and I still have one! lol. they work great holding lots of hair, sometimes a little too big for thinner hair.</li>
    <li> These clips are great! I would not go as far as saying one clip will hold any amount of hair because one clip has never been able to hold all of mine. I have very thick, natural, curly (3c/4a) hair and use these whenever I am washing, styling or just dealing with my hair in any way. They have never pulled my hair out and once they are in place, they are in place! I use these clips every week. I will say, though, that I am giving them 4 stars out of 5 because in only six months, 3 (half) of my clips have broken. The first one that broke actually snapped weirdly on my hand and hurt a little bit; I was more hurt by the fact that I would no longer be able to use my favorite clip though. They all broke around the same time, so I do not know if they have a limited amount of use or what...but I would reorder these. Hopefully my last three will hang in there for a while longer though.</li>
    <li> I use this in the shower to hold my hair up while conditioning. I also use it to braid parts of my hair in sections.  Overall very sturdy clip.  Highly recommend, and I have long very thick hair.</li>
    <li> I have hard thick hair and I have actually let it grow a little bit longer.  My problem is that regular hair clips just did not hold my hair up when I needed it to.  These clips are just perfect.  I saw them at my hair stylist first and then I knew I had to get myself a set of these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They have also been going strong for the past 2 years, so the quality is quite good.</li>
