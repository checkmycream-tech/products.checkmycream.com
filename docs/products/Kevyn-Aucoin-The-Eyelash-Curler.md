      <li>it seems to fit better and never pulls eyelashes</li>
      <li>So much better than the cheap eyelash curlers I&#x27;ve used (e.g., Revlon).</li>
      <li>Admittedly, this is the best eyelash curler that I have used, as other brands are an exercise in futility.  </li>

      <li>Worth every penny!</li>
      <li>this is worth the money!</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t do the job any better than a much cheaper store brand like Revlon.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This eyelash curler is excellent. It conforms well to the curve of my eyes and does a good job of curling. Once it is positioned it is easy to squeeze and hold. It comes with a replacement red band.</li>
    <li> It was just okay. I didn&#x27;t see much if any difference from the others on market.  Pretty expensive for not seeing a big difference</li>
    <li> I read good things about this Kevyn Aucoin eyelash curler and I am always looking for the next best thing in all things make-up and health and beauty products...but was very disappointed! It doesn&#x27;t do much of anything...barely see a difference, even when I added heat to curler!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money and invest in an authentic SHU EMURA eyelash curler-the BEST there is! Don&#x27;t let someone tell you Shisheido is the same as Shu Emura either, it&#x27;s not!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why I strayed, I don&#x27;t know! : (</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what I was expecting with this but it works just like every other eye lash curler. I will save my money and buy one from the drugstore next time.</li>
    <li> this is the best eyelash curler I have ever used.  Better than shu uemura, way better.  Just wish they would give you replacement pads.  But this is by far the best I have ever used and I have tried a lot!!</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t waste money on drugstore curlers.  This one was worth it, it actually curls lashes and does not pinch.</li>
    <li> This is the very finest eyelash curler I&#x27;ve ever had (and I&#x27;ve bought the expensive ones from Japanese companies)  It works and doesn&#x27;t hurt.  What else do you need?</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t curl any better than my regular eye lash curler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;waste of money! at least for me</li>
    <li> My title says it all...this is the best eyelash curler that you can buy.  I&#x27;ve used every beauty product, device known and have been in the beauty business for almost 30 years.  This is the curler to buy... it costs more than your drug store brands (maybelline, covergirl, etc..), but it lasts alot longer and works much better.  You will not be disappointed with this curler.  I&#x27;ve had mine for almost a year and switched out the rubber curler part once...now I am going to order another.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this one! I&#x27;ve had many over the years.... But NOT like this one.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Feels smoother and different than other eyelash curlers.  Very high quality.</li>
    <li> Hands down the best eye lash curler ever! Worth every penny! This is my second one. My first lasted 7 years!</li>
    <li> In my opinion this eyelash curler isn&#x27;t any better than any other. Actually, I think the Revlon is better, so I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money again.</li>
    <li> I have used the drugstore eyelash curlers forever. I was still never able to get a natural curl with them. Based on others reviews, I purchased this. Wow!  This curled my lashes beautifully with no crunch look. It opens the eye and even if you did not get enough sleep, you wont be able to tell if you use this product!</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed.  This eyelash curler didnt curl my lashes.  I tried numerous times, even holding it for an extended time.</li>
    <li> I really love this eyelash curler. I often have an issue (especially with my inner corner lashes) getting pinched and it&#x27;s quite painful. This eyelash curler has a large opening which really helps prevent this pinching issue. I really like these and I would recommend them to anyone who has large eyes, long eyelashes, or issues with eyelashes being pulled/pinched.</li>
    <li> this is worth the money! best curler ive ever bought!</li>
    <li> This curler was highly rated and I find that to be true also. Don&#x27;t know how I lived without one all these year. Don&#x27;t wait! Order one for yourself today. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Love...gentle and lashes look fantastic.</li>
    <li> This eyelash curler is not even comparable to the other torture devices on the market.  This one takes a couple of squeezes and your lashes are curled! Not only that but it gets close to the root without ripping your eyelashes out.  It comes with one extra pad.  They do not sell the replacement pads separately so this is my second Kevyn Aucoin Eyelash curler in 10 years....Phenomenal product!</li>
    <li> I have found this Kevyn Aucoin eyelash curler to work no better than a cheap one at Target.  Doesn&#x27;t curl and certainly doesn&#x27;t stay like suggested.  Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> best lash curler I have found in years</li>
    <li> Years ago I bought a Kevyn Aucoin eyelash curler.  Previously I had always used Maybelline which was a lot less expensive.  However, I found the Kevin Aucoin curler much better, mainly because it never took out any of my lashes.  Recently I decided to buy a new one because the rubber piece seemed like it could use replacing and I couldn&#x27;t find replacement rubbers anywhere.  Upon receipt of the new curler, though, the first thing I noticed was that the curler was so light weight that it seemed cheap and flimsy.  It didn&#x27;t seem to curl my lashes as well either.  It&#x27;s definitely not the same product or worth the extra money.</li>
    <li> I have a drawer in my bathroom full of eyelash curlers ... close to one of every brand made.  This one does the trick ... my lashes have gradually become more and more resistent to curl the older I get.  This is the only one that will curl them.  I can&#x27;t imagine that anyone could get as good a curl out of another brand.  It is worth any amount of money to get something that works as well as this one does.</li>
    <li> Best eye lash curlers!! Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> My eyelashes are short and gard to curl. I wanted to love this product but it just disapointed.</li>
    <li> This eyelash curler works great!  It opens wide enough so that all your lashes fit.  It works like a charm on my very, very straight long eyelashes.  It looks like most eyelash curlers, however, the difference between most curlers and the Kevyn Aucoin is that the Kevyn Aucoin opens up alot wider than your average curler.  It makes all the difference.  Compare the KA against another brand and you will see what I mean.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll love it, because, I have used this eyelash curler before. Kevin Aucoin was a genius and it is too bad he died so young.</li>
    <li> Feels cheap and flimsy, and the rubber insert is too hard. I have looked all over for a replacement (or refill pads) for the Revlon Extracurl model that I bought a few years back at Walmart for around $5.00. This doesn&#x27;t even come close, and it&#x27;s three times the price.</li>
    <li> The best thing about this eyelash curler is the red &amp;#34;rubber gasket&amp;#34;, at least I think that&#x27;s what they call it.  It puts the best crimp in your eyelashes I&#x27;ve ever seen plus it holds the crimp while putting mascara on.</li>
    <li> I was hoping to find the perfect eyelash curler.  For me, this is it.  Curls perfectly, with a natural looking upward curve in my lashes, and is not uncomfortable to use.  No more pinching, or crimps in lashes.  So much better than the cheap eyelash curlers I&#x27;ve used (e.g., Revlon).</li>
    <li> My favorite eyelash curler! Opens wider than most making it easy to use and with great results!</li>
    <li> I have big eyes and for once I have found an eyelash curler that covers the whole row of lashes.&lt;br /&gt;I am very please.  Thank you Kevin.  They only one that comes a close second is maybeline.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do the job any better than a much cheaper store brand like Revlon.</li>
    <li> This is a great eyelash curler. It gets all the lashes in and gives them a nice curl. Worth the money to me!</li>
    <li> This eyelash curler is the best I&#x27;ve ever used &amp; I&#x27;ve used Shu Uemura for over 20 years. This curler gets right at the base of lashes &amp; gives the most natural looking curl without kinks. I can&#x27;t believe how long my lashes look with this.</li>
    <li> This one works like a revlon or any other drug store brand. I prefer the classic high end Japanese curler.</li>
    <li> This is the best Eyelash curler there is. A little more expensive - but no pinching. I am thrilled at how easy it was to order. (Years ago, it was only available at Henri Bendel&#x27;s in NYC!</li>
    <li> The absolute best eyelash curler ever existed to &amp;#34;womankind&amp;#34;!!!! I have used EVERYONE brand, from obviously every drugstore brand to Shu Uemura Gold, and was actually planning on purchasing the Lancome lash tool...BUT, due to the holidays, it was out of stock months after Christmas. I did my research and figured I&#x27;d try the Kevyn Aucoin curler. WOW!!! Perfection in every way possible for a tool I quickly will spend ANY amount of money for quality results! XOXO</li>
    <li> Admittedly, this is the best eyelash curler that I have used, as other brands are an exercise in futility.  This particular curler seems to get closer to the root of the eyelashes, which results in a better curl.  It did come with a replacement rubber insert.  However, I can&#x27;t help but wonder how easy it will be to find another one, once the original and the replacement insert are no longer usable.  The only reason that I gave it four stars is due to the pricey price-tag.  Is it worth three times the cost of other brands?  That is a judgment call that you will have to make.</li>
    <li> Love it! Curls eyelashes perfectly.</li>
    <li> item came quick and worked wonderful . . .  so i was told. I wouldn&#x27;t know because I do not curl my eye lashes.</li>
    <li> Love this eyelash curler.  Has a large opening -- perfect for not pinching!</li>
    <li> I have long lashes, but they just don&#x27;t like to curl. I heard all the great reviews about the Kevyn Aucoin, so I purchased one for myself. I really like it, and will purchase another soon... because I wore out the one I have now.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see what all of the hype about this eyelash curler is all about. It doesn&#x27;t do anything that a Maybelline or other drugstore eyelash curler can do. I think we sometimes get all caught up in the hype of advertising, especially in these &amp;#34;beauty&amp;#34; magazines. Save your money and just go to the drugstore and buy one of those.</li>
    <li> Eyelash curlers look much the same but are definitely not created equal. This one is good stuff! I have longish but very straight lashes, so I usually need do a routine of two curlers, one I use near the root and another one midway towards my lash tips so I get a decent curl. This Kevyn Aucoin curler is almost all I need now, gets all my lashes in a row and gives them a nice durable curl. Get yours! :o)</li>
    <li> My left eyelashes have always pointed stubbornly outward and resisted curling. They still do to an extent, but this is the best curler I&#x27;ve found so far. After a bit of experimenting to find the proper placement, my left lashes are finally visible!</li>
    <li> Best eye lash curler!!</li>
    <li> I have used Kevyn Aucoin eyelash curler for several years and won&#x27;t use anything else! I purchased this from Amazon.com</li>
    <li> The best - forget all others including Sephora, Maybelline and Shu Uemura if you can ever find again.  Kevyn also makes the best mascara EVER..but not cheap.  Well cheaper than Dior Show line......</li>
    <li> I have used the Shu Umera curler for many years and decided to try this one because I read good reviews.  In my opinion it seems comparable to Shu Umera and it fits my eye shape well, no pinching, and I also like that this curler opens much wider. It also comes with an extra pad.  The only difference I notice is the pad seems firmer so I get more of an L- shape curl rather than a soft, round curl.</li>
    <li> It was as described but the eye curler didn&#x27;t curl my eyes too good. I expected so much more from this brand.</li>
    <li> I was nervous about spending the money on this curler but thought I would take a chance based on reviews. It does curl very well and I am very pleased. An extra tip I learned long ago is instead of buying a heated curler just run your hair dryer over it a few seconds and it works great.</li>
    <li> My husband thinks this is some kind of torture device, but works great. It even comes with a spare red cushion.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best eye lash curler on the market. I recommend it to everyone in the market for a new curler.</li>
    <li> I have eyelashes that point down.  They are very hard to curl. For some reason this one can handle the job.  It&#x27;s a very sturdy call, not flimsy like most.  When you close it, it grips down nicely without pinching.  A bit more than I&#x27;m used to paying, but it works and hopefully will last a long time.</li>
    <li> no spare erasers. Although the manufacturer replacement gum should be included. I am very upset because for my money was not complete.</li>
    <li> I moved on from the Shu Uemura lash curler to this one. I love it. I have straight eyelashes and this curls them just right. It does open quite a bit farther than necessary, but doesn&#x27;t affect its usability or functionality. Great eyelash curler.</li>
    <li> Best eye lash curler I have ever used! My make up artist recommended it to me and I&#x27;m so glad she did. Worth every penny. Curls my lashes beautifully!</li>
    <li> It took me a few times to get the knack. The first time it rolled my very long lashes into a tube shape (lol). Yes, it curls that much! After removing my eye makeup with baby oil my lashes are still curled!!!! It is due to the thick rubber strip on the curler. I&#x27;ve used Revlon for years and decided to make a changed. More than 2 seconds of pressure is not needed with this baby. It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
    <li> Horrible eyelash curler. Didn&#x27;t curl at all and pinched.</li>
    <li> It rounds the eye lash up instead of smashing it up.</li>
    <li> I saw this product on a list of a 100 items you should use before you die.  I really like it and it works well.  I&#x27;m glad I brought this eyelash curler.</li>
    <li> Like others eyelash curlers. I don&#x27;t see the difference.</li>
    <li> I was surprised that for the cost of the product it wasn&#x27;t that good. It pinched and didn&#x27;t curl any better than the drugstore curlers.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try whether the red rubber piece in the curler actually helps. it&#x27;s one of the worse curler i even purchased.&lt;br /&gt;Expensive garbage. Can&#x27;t even send it back for refund - i had high hopes for it and did not keep the original package.&lt;br /&gt;live and learn.</li>
    <li> This eye lash curler has great curl to it.  My lashes look fabulous I have very long eyelashes but unfortunately they are very straight.  i do not know what it is about this curler but it does a great job of getting a fabulous flair to your eyelashes.  I also like the rubber pad being red as it makes it a bit easier to see that your eyelashes are lined up.</li>
    <li> The spring is loose and takes longer to curl my lashes than less expensive drug store products. Save your money.</li>
    <li> Love it. Will order again when I wear this one out.</li>
    <li> As great as everybody says.</li>
    <li> I love this Eyelash Curler it&#x27;s the best I ever had!! Definitely recommend it! Its totally worth what you pay for!! For now on I will only purchase this one!</li>
    <li> Boy,am I sorry I spent $20.00 on this eyelash curler!  Not only does it not curl, but it pinches too.  I have tried other ones, but I always go back to my old Revlon curler. Big Red</li>
    <li> I was looking for a better way to curl my eyelashes. was very cautious because i had recently lost my lashes and had to wait months for them to regrow. this is the best eyelash curler i have ever used. it seems to fit better and never pulls eyelashes out.&lt;br /&gt;makeup artist Lisa Eldrege recommended this in many of her you tube videos</li>
    <li> This eyelash curler is the best I&#x27;ve tried...and I&#x27;ve tried them all!  It curls so well and the curl holds all day.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.  The customer service at Kevyn Aucoin is absolutely awesome and I will definitely purchase from them again!</li>
    <li> This is without a doubt the best eyelash curler that I have ever owned.  My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t purchase this when I was a lot younger.</li>
    <li> This product did nothing different than any other eyelash curler I&#x27;ve owned, eyelashes curled up for a few seconds, that&#x27;s it.</li>
    <li> A really, really great eyelash curler.</li>
    <li> I threw my old curler out after it managed to cut off some of my lashes. After asking a friend she recommended this one and I will never go back to anything else! great price for a great product!</li>
    <li> Okay, my lashes are long &amp; hard to keep a curl. I have large eyes and these are good for that but i still can&#x27;t hold a curl. I&#x27;ve tried heating these first..... I&#x27;ve tried holding for a count of 50 at the root, then 25 in the middle, 15 at the ends. After 5 minutes the curl is gone! Seems Revlon works better for me.</li>
    <li> I love my curler, I got it as part of a kit 2 years ago and I love it. I always feel so special using it and extra fab! It&#x27;s sturdy, quality made, to last forever. Mine still looks brand new. Definitely suggest.</li>
    <li> Really pleased with this purchase</li>
    <li> I have to just agree with all those beauty bloggers who rated this gadget very high. It curled very naturally, no fractures.</li>
    <li> This curler is worth the price paid! It is recommended for Asian eyes because of its angle. Though I&#x27;m not Asian, this works in a way none of the others have!</li>
    <li> It works great, the best devise that I ever use.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that there really is a difference in eyelash curlers until using this one. Absolutely worth the higher price compared to the average drugstore curlers (I&#x27;ve used revlon for years). Highly recommend.</li>
