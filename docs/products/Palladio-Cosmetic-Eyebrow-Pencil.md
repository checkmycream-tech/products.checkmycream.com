      <li>Easy to use and stays all day.  </li>
      <li>I have dark auburn hair and it looks perfect.  </li>
      <li>Once the pencil had reset, it was fine.  </li>
      <li>And because it&#x27;s waxy, it glides on smoothly and the wax keeps the hairs in place.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Goes on smoothly and lasts all day.</li>
      <li>THIS IS A GREAT EYEBROW PENCIL SIMPLE TO USE</li>
      <li>TO SMOOTH OUT</li>
      <li>I love that it has great brush on the other end and both ends are capped.  </li>
      <li>The pencil is different now, with the brush on the end, and it is very handy.</li>
      <li>It has a very nice taupe color, not too gold or red.  </li>
      <li>Too excited to try my budget friendly pencil, I immediately opened it and applied.....</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t believe that I&#x27;ve found the perfect pencil for $6 after spending at least $20 each for &amp;#34;high end&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Love this, I have very light eye brows almost blonde</li>
      <li>the brush on the other end is perfect for smoothing out the brows and giving them a natural look.</li>
      <li>I bought this because my beloved Anastasia pencil is out of my budget for a long time.</li>
      <li>Good price but too dark for my light brown hair.</li>
      <li>Cheaper than having them dyed, since I have the exact results!</li>
      <li>This is exactly what I was looking for!  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s worth it.</li>

      <li>One of my favorite brow pencils by far.</li>
      <li>The taupe is a perfect fit for my pale eyebrows and lighter blonde hair.</li>
      <li>they are just right.  </li>
      <li>I never use eyebrow pencils because they never looked right on me.</li>
      <li>The color is just right for a medium brown.</li>
      <li>it goes on kind of dry, not greasy.</li>
      <li>Glides on easily, doesn&#x27;t smear and has a natural look towards it.</li>
      <li>I have light brown hair and this color looked very natural.</li>
      <li>my moms are light works for us both very natural looking.</li>
      <li>My fault for not realizing wax pencil in hot truck + hot porch on hot day &#x3D; globby eyebrows.  </li>
      <li>But now at 70 plus years they are getting very sparse!  </li>
      <li>Taupe is probably meant more for a blonde woman with darker eyebrows.</li>
      <li>I will definitely be buying more.  </li>
      <li>Will definitely order more.</li>
      <li>I love the price and will definitely buy again.  </li>
      <li>This was a good replacement for the old Cover Girl grey color, but not now.</li>
      <li>Taupe should be a light cool grey brown.</li>
      <li>While not an exact match, the color is very close</li>

    <li> I love the Palladio eyebrow pencil!  I can&#x27;t believe that I&#x27;ve found the perfect pencil for $6 after spending at least $20 each for &amp;#34;high end&amp;#34; brands which are far inferior in quality!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t break when I sharpen it (which is the big problem with the powder eyebrow pencils), so you don&#x27;t waste 3/4 of the pencil trying to sharpen it.  And because it&#x27;s waxy, it glides on smoothly and the wax keeps the hairs in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope they never discontinue this product, I can&#x27;t imagine using anything else!</li>
    <li> This pencil is a perfect color on my darker eyebrows - I would say that taupe is always a neutral.  It glides on easily and stays put all day.  I love the price and will definitely buy again.  It compares to expensive pencils I have purchased in the past.</li>
    <li> Love this, I have very light eye brows almost blonde and this is a good match</li>
    <li> Best brow filler for the price. It blends perfectly with my blonde hair.</li>
    <li> I really like this eyebrow pencil. I just recently started filling my eyebrows in and it is a huge difference, improvement to my overall look. The pencil is a great color and is perfect for my hair tone. I am glad I bought this.</li>
    <li> I was told that taupe goes with every hair color, yet I am a very light brunette and this color just does not blend well with mine. The pencil itself seems like good quality, it&#x27;s just the color that is off putting to me. Taupe is probably meant more for a blonde woman with darker eyebrows.</li>
    <li> I will buy this again.  Good value.</li>
    <li> THIS IS A GREAT EYEBROW PENCIL SIMPLE TO USE AND I LOVE THE BRUSH BEING ON THE OTHER END  TO SMOOTH OUT ANY MISTAKES HELPS A LOT.I CHOSE THE COLOR TAUPE I DON&#x27;T LIKE A DARK COLOR ON MY BROWS AND  IT SEEMS TO BE WORKING FAIRLY WELL.IT IS NOT EXPENSIVE AND IT IS A LONG PENCIL SO IT SHOULD LAST AWHILE.I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT. HOPE THIS HELPS WITH ANYONE WANTING TO PURCHASE THE PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> I was surprised at how natural this product looks, I am a strawberry blonde.  This worked great when I used the pencil then used the brush end to feather.  It doesn&#x27;t look like I drew my eyebrows, just a natural look. Cheaper than having them dyed, since I have the exact results!</li>
    <li> I ordered these eyebrow pencils because one cannot find them (in Taupe) in a small town.  I love them....they are just right.  Like&lt;br /&gt;the brushes on the end of them...makes brows look more natural.</li>
    <li> WARNING- the manufacturer has changed the formulation for the color &amp;#34;Taupe&amp;#34;. It used to be a nice cool brownish color but now has gotten warmer. This was a good replacement for the old Cover Girl grey color, but not now. I will be switching because I hate having orange eyebrows!</li>
    <li> color is perfect for all hair colors and skin types and bonus brush...but only problemis no staying power at all! I am going to try finding a similar powder color to go over it with and see if that helps but the smoothness of it when applying and color is awesome! I would buy again just modify what i put over it for staying power</li>
    <li> One of my favorite brow pencils by far. And I like to order these because I like sharpening my own pencils to a fine point. Not everyone likes doing that, but if you don&#x27;t mind - it is seriously a GREAT pencil. Great pigment/color and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I am a make-up junkie, even sell a cosmetic brand and have had trouble finding an eyebrow pencil that stays on-I have tried many!  This one works great, does not irritate my skin and looks natural. I chose Taupe, as my hair is medium brown, it is a believable shade.  Great pencil for a great price. Will definitely order more.</li>
    <li> Nice product for my eyebrows. The color worked out perfectly and it is easy to apply. Good product for the buck!</li>
    <li> Good price but too dark for my light brown hair. Didn&#x27;t like texture of oencil - couldn&#x27;t blend it in</li>
    <li> Best eye brown pencil color I&#x27;ve found in a long time.  Goes on great ---looks natural.  Easy to use and stays all day.  I will order it again.</li>
    <li> Picture shows two pencils.  I received only one.  Had to call to have the seconding sent.  If supply is really only one per order, picture should reflect that!</li>
    <li> The color is just right for a medium brown. Goes on smoothly and lasts all day. Eyebrows look totally natural.</li>
    <li> llove the brush on the end. Very convienient. Goes on well and stay pretty good. It was a good price for the product.</li>
    <li> Color is nice, sharpens well, doesn&#x27;t break easily, stays on well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to apply if you use primers though. It also feels too waxy. I can feel that I have makeup on my brows during the day, and that is not a good thing in the summer. Staying power is good but I just hate the formula. It feels unnatural. I bought this because my beloved Anastasia pencil is out of my budget for a long time. Sigh. I have tried so many non-prestige brand brow pencils and they&#x27;re all awful.</li>
    <li> Needs to be a little softer crayon</li>
    <li> Color blends in well with my honey blonde hair look. Not to dark where my eyebrows stand out and not too light.</li>
    <li> Had trouble finding a &amp;#34;taupe&amp;#34; eyebrow pencil and this one a perfect color--sort of a grey-brown and subtle enough for a senior&#x27;s graying hair color.  Will order again.</li>
    <li> Perfect brow taupe color pencil for all shades I have black brows my moms are light works for us both very natural looking.</li>
    <li> I only use the brush side now. That&#x27;s really what I got it for anyway.</li>
    <li> The taupe is a perfect fit for my pale eyebrows and lighter blonde hair.Natural looking color.</li>
    <li> Only eyebrow pencil I have found that is the perfect color match for my reddish brown hair, and it goes on kind of dry, not greasy.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product for eyebrows!  I never used to have to worry about them! But now at 70 plus years they are getting very sparse!  Great product!</li>
    <li> I used to buy these in the beauty supply. but couldn&#x27;t find them locally. Glad I could find on line. The pencil is different now, with the brush on the end, and it is very handy. The taupe color is a perfect choice for light brown, blonde, or even gray hair. The light brown pencils tend to be too red, and this color is very neutral.</li>
    <li> This color is definitely not a taupe. Taupe should be a light cool grey brown. This is the ever present reddish brown brow color that seems to be everywhere.</li>
    <li> its more of a powder pencil so it doesn&#x27;t mash your brows or make them too dark. great universal color for any brown, blonde, even red.</li>
    <li> Great color and very nice to apply. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> It stays on all day and the color is perfect for me!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product! Glides on easily, doesn&#x27;t smear and has a natural look towards it. This price is pretty decent, i normally pay close to 10 bucks for it at my local Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply store. I have my hair dyed a dark burgundy color and my eyebrows are a medium brown shade i use the &amp;#34;auburn&amp;#34; colored pencil to fill in my eyebrows and the color sort of matches my hair in a way, i always get asked if i dyed my eyebrows.</li>
    <li> The pencil is the perfect color for blondes.  I would have given it five stars but the pencil is just a tiny bit to soft so it&#x27;s hard to get smooth lines.</li>
    <li> Great product will keep using.</li>
    <li> Perfect color for my dishwater brown/ blonde hair. Nice application too. An excellent eyebrow pencil.</li>
    <li> Color is much more red than expected. I have used this same product and same &amp;#34;color&amp;#34; purchased from in store with very different results. The pencils purchased here online are a much redder shade. -Laura</li>
    <li> best ever the only one I will use</li>
    <li> Goes on really well with no smudging. I&#x27;ve been using it for three weeks everyday and haven&#x27;t had to sharpen it yet. The color is perfect and blends in well with the blond and brown hairs I have in my brows.</li>
    <li> I was a Lancome user for this type of product.  I find it more than sufficient as a substitute and a heck of a lot less expensive.</li>
    <li> I have tried almost all the eyebrow pencils out there.  This $6.00 pencil out ranks even the most expensive that I tried.  I stays on and the Taupe is great for anyone.  I have dark auburn hair and it looks perfect.  I like the fact that it is a pencil and not a roll up one. I can sharpen it to a perfect point.  I highly recommend this pencil for anyone.</li>
    <li> Has a red undertone.... I love to color my entire lid with it as a base...</li>
    <li> This eyebrow pencil in Taupe is the perfect universal color for anyone. The brush makes your eyebrow pencil look like real hair.</li>
    <li> I love this pencil.  It has a very nice taupe color, not too gold or red.  It glides on nicely and sharpens well.  I love that it has great brush on the other end and both ends are capped.  Would definitely buy this product again.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I was looking for!  As an older person, I don&#x27;t like the dark colors for brows.  The taupe is perfect. Not too dark.  the brush on the other end is perfect for smoothing out the brows and giving them a natural look. I will definitely be buying more.  In the picture, it shows two pencils but in reality, you get only one.  That&#x27;s okay, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> I was using the Lancome Taupe, which runs $20 a pencil.  While not an exact match, the color is very close and I am extremely happy with the price too.  My only mistake was ordering this for the first time during the hot summer months.  Too excited to try my budget friendly pencil, I immediately opened it and applied.....picture Joan Crawford meets Groucho Marx eyebrows!  Thick and messy!  My fault for not realizing wax pencil in hot truck + hot porch on hot day &#x3D; globby eyebrows.  Once the pencil had reset, it was fine.  Learn from my stupidity. :)</li>
    <li> Love the brush applier. The pencil itself is very light and hardly pigmented at all</li>
    <li> I have light brown hair and this color looked very natural.</li>
    <li> I really like this eyebrow pencil.  You just cannot easily find the taupe color for some reason.  The price is reasonable also.  I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have never been able to find my perfect color until I found this pencil. The taupe color is not red at all and not too dark for my hair color which is lightish brown with a little bit of Auburn in it. I never use eyebrow pencils because they never looked right on me.</li>
    <li> Not the greatest brow pencil but what do you expect for the low cost.</li>
