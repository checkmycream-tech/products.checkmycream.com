      <li>have to say, this was my first experience with any kind of eye mask...</li>
      <li>I love the cool sensation feeling</li>
      <li>Because i never got fine lines underneath my eyes before.  </li>
      <li>Since I used it, i think it gave me fine lines.  </li>
      <li>My friends and sister in law said that they noticed my fine lines after using it.  </li>
      <li>It does what it says it will do, it minimizes fine wrinkles, improves skin tone and texture.</li>

      <li>I left these one for about 30 minutes and the results were amazing!</li>

      <li>They really do make your makeup look better.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be leaving this feedback on each of the items I bought and will most definitely be purchasing more when I need it.</li>
      <li>the eye mask is great, but the fluid really really runs everywhere.  </li>
      <li>Overall these are a great product that I highly recommend!</li>
      <li>The older I get the more</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy with each of their products individually and as a whole.</li>
      <li>I used this for the first time last night and really loved how it made my eyes feel.  </li>
      <li>My skin is also very soft to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;Thirdly, and my favorite, there is no cleanup.</li>
      <li>felt &amp;#34;decongested&amp;#34; and fresh.  </li>
      <li>They arrive in a really nice box and each set of anti-aging collagen eye masks are individually wrapped.</li>
      <li>When I get out of the shower I place them under my eyes on my freshly cleaned face.</li>
      <li>i stop using it right away.</li>
      <li>I usually only wear them before a big night out, but would be great for a spa night too.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have very much in the area of lines and wrinkles around my eyes (</li>
      <li>I used these tonight for the first time.</li>
      <li>Very moisturizing!</li>
      <li>It is such a refreshing feeling.</li>
      <li>I tried them out for the first time yesterday.</li>
      <li>My skin is looking better than it has in a long time after using their products.</li>
      <li>I bought this along with several of their other products and I&#x27;m absolutely happy.</li>
      <li>This product, a good eye cream (Bobbi Brown Extra Repair and Mario Badescu Ceramide gel) and a few minutes of light lymphatic massage nightly seem to really target and handle the amount of puffiness.  </li>
      <li>Absolutely.  </li>
      <li>and  will slide off your under eye area if you sit up or move around much.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very relaxing process.&lt;br</li>
      <li>These Anti-Aging Collagen Eye Mask works really well.  </li>
      <li>I really like them.</li>
      <li>I really like using these eye masks.  </li>
      <li>They are very cooling and really do work.  </li>
      <li>plus my eyes feel very refreshed after using it.</li>
      <li>very hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>After wearing them for about 20 minutes gently peel them away and then wash your face.</li>
      <li>It was very hydrating as well.  </li>
      <li>I am in my early 30&#x27;s and have really started to notice the aging process taking effect!</li>
      <li>I love them because they help to rid the dark circles and bags that I always have under my eyes.</li>
      <li>If I knew how often I&#x27;m to use it then possibly the product would likely work better.  </li>
      <li>They feel cool and wet when you first apply them.</li>
      <li>They initially feel great but they slide around and you are always pushing them back in place unless you are lying flat on your back.  </li>
      <li>so I decided the overall experience was worth it.  </li>
      <li>I have been looking for and trying new products to help me combat this.</li>
      <li>I would suggest using these when you have time to lay back, relax and close your eyes as they are pretty saturated with liquid</li>
      <li>I wore the masks for 20 minutes yesterday and today the skin under my eyes still feels soft and rejuvenated.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>These leave my eye area soft and moisturized.  </li>
      <li>I washed my face first with my regular facial cleanser.</li>
      <li>I only used it this twice so far and already see a difference</li>
      <li>I have such a full schedule that without the help of products like these I would probably look like a zombie for the walking dead.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> There is so much product on these masks that they slip off from under your eye down your face. It is a very messy product. A reusable mask with collagen is much better.</li>
    <li> I am in my early 30&#x27;s and have really started to notice the aging process taking effect! I have bags under my eyes and just an overall puffy feeling to them. I have tried every cream or serum out there and nothing seems to take the puffiness away. I jumped at the chance to get a sample of these and share my experience with them here with you. They arrive in a really nice box and each set of anti-aging collagen eye masks are individually wrapped. I washed my face first with my regular facial cleanser. I would suggest using these when you have time to lay back, relax and close your eyes as they are pretty saturated with liquid and they start to slide down your face. I left these one for about 30 minutes and the results were amazing! My puffiness and bags were totally gone! What I also love about these anti-aging collagen eye masks is that they are made in the USA and have no odor to them at all! Overall these are a great product that I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I tried it ! Not good enough,sorry......</li>
    <li> It would slide down so stopped using it after 2 times. Wanted something I could walk around with</li>
    <li> These eye masks are basically silicone pads that are soaked in the collagen solution.  I was offered the opportunity to test them at a substantial discount and agreed to post my thoughts.  I tried them out for the first time yesterday. The ingredients seem really good so I was looking forward to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I was a little put off by the wet slippery texture when I pulled them out of the package.  When I put them under my eyes it was very refreshing though so I decided the overall experience was worth it.  I wore the masks for 20 minutes yesterday and today the skin under my eyes still feels soft and rejuvenated.&lt;br /&gt;I think these eye masks are a great idea to use the day before a special event.  One thing I do recommend is to lie down or sit quietly while using them because I was wearing them while walking around the house and they kept sliding down.  The manufacturer does recommend resting while using them.</li>
    <li> I see a difference and I like it.</li>
    <li> I received these anti-aging collagen eye masks for a product review. I love these! They are awesome! I love them because they help to rid the dark circles and bags that I always have under my eyes. I have such a full schedule that without the help of products like these I would probably look like a zombie for the walking dead. I keep long hours and never have down time, so my face needs some pampering. These are very easy to use. Literally just place them under your eyes and let them work. They feel cool and wet when you first apply them. It is such a refreshing feeling. When I get out of the shower I place them under my eyes on my freshly cleaned face. Then I sit and do some homework while they are repairing some of the damage done to my skin. I only use them about once per week, so this set will last me a little while. I am trying to get into a routine with facial skin products because I want to look younger than my age, not older or even my age, BUT YOUNGER. They are easy to use and can be used on all skin types. After wearing them for about 20 minutes gently peel them away and then wash your face. You can feel the difference in just one application. And you can SEE the difference. I love using a product that you can know is working as soon as you apply it. These are an amazing product to have on hand for personal use and they would also make an excellent gift. Most women would love to get a set of these masks! They come with a money back guarantee, too!</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing! I really like them. I don&#x27;t know yet if they are helping, I am just starting to use them but I have dry skin and the moisture  from the masks definitely helps.</li>
    <li> If you have bags, BUY THESE NOW!!!  I have huge bags with some shadow beneath them.  I don&#x27;t have very much in the area of lines and wrinkles around my eyes (yet....when you&#x27;re my age unattractive stuff pops up seemingly overnight).  Anyway, I bought these to address my bags.  They are very cooling, refreshing, comfortable and easy to apply.  Are they slimy?  Yes.  Did they stay where I put them?  Yes.  Did I notice an actual reduction in the size of the bags after 30 minutes?  Yes.  They de-puffed my eyes and the entire eye area felt &amp;#34;decongested&amp;#34; and fresh.  Were the bags gone?  No, but significantly reduced.  I have fat from my eye socket that leaked out into my under eye area.  It happens to a lot of us as we age.  Will it magically go away for good?  No.  Not without surgery.  Can I reduce the puffiness and hide the shadow to make them less noticeable?  Absolutely.  This product, a good eye cream (Bobbi Brown Extra Repair and Mario Badescu Ceramide gel) and a few minutes of light lymphatic massage nightly seem to really target and handle the amount of puffiness.  A great concealer, applied properly, hides the shadow beneath the bag.  To sum up, this product has made an actual, noticeable difference for me.  Try it.  You have nothing to lose....except puffy eyes!!</li>
    <li> Since I used it, i think it gave me fine lines.  Because i never got fine lines underneath my eyes before.  I&#x27;m not sure if its this one or the 24K Gold collagen eye lifting mask by same company, but one of them gave me finelines or just the company itself make false product.  My friends and sister in law said that they noticed my fine lines after using it.  awful!!! i stop using it right away.</li>
    <li> I bought this along with several of their other products and I&#x27;m absolutely happy. My skin is looking better than it has in a long time after using their products.I&#x27;m happy with each of their products individually and as a whole. I&#x27;ll be leaving this feedback on each of the items I bought and will most definitely be purchasing more when I need it.</li>
    <li> Best eye mask I&#x27;ve ever tried and I tried a lot......I only used it this twice so far and already see a difference plus my eyes feel very refreshed after using it. Def. a great product worth every penny</li>
    <li> I used these tonight for the first time. They were very simple to use, just wash your face and eye area, take them out of the package, place under your eyes....relax.....wait about 15 minutes...then take them off and rinse your face.&lt;br /&gt;I have to say, this was my first experience with any kind of eye mask...and it was AWESOME!  They were cold on my eye area and then after having taken them off, they leave your eyes feeling fresh.  That is the best description I can give.  My eyes are almost always &amp;#34;tired&amp;#34; looking and when I was done, they didn&#x27;t look that way.  It leaves you with a tingly feeling on them.  I am assuming that is the collagen working?  Either way, the bags under my eyes are not there!  Love these!&lt;br /&gt;I received these for free and this is my honest and unbiased opinion</li>
    <li> Not enough adhesion, you have to till your head back or lay down for them to stay on</li>
    <li> Love these!! I put them in the fridge for extra de puffing. I usually only wear them before a big night out, but would be great for a spa night too.  They really do make your makeup look better. They are also super refreshing and relaxing!</li>
    <li> The older I get the more I notice my skin becoming dryer and dryer around my eyes. It&#x27;s like the Sahara. I have been looking for and trying new products to help me combat this. I was given this mask at a great price to try and provide my unbiased opinion. I love these! They are the solution I have been looking for.&lt;br /&gt;First, they are beautifully packaged. Just the look and feel of them makes you feel like you are at the spa. It&#x27;s a very relaxing process.&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, they feel so good when applied. I can feel my skin just soaking in the moisture. When I remove them there is a noticeable difference in the look and feel of my skin. I can press that area and see the elasticity being restored. My skin is also very soft to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;Thirdly, and my favorite, there is no cleanup. None. Just throw them away. It&#x27;s that easy.</li>
    <li> Just like other reviews, it comes in a nice package and does feel great on the eyes!  The reason I gave it 3 stars is because I haven&#x27;t used it long enough and also there are no instructions telling you how often to use it.  If I knew how often I&#x27;m to use it then possibly the product would likely work better.  I&#x27;ll be sure to update this review if I do find this out and truly see results.</li>
    <li> It took a while for the mask to stay lol . Overall I like the smell of it . No allergic reaction which is a plus for me ! I notice some change I will continue to wear them everything . I love the cool sensation feeling I fee relaxed</li>
    <li> These things are a waste of money. They don&#x27;t stay on your face!</li>
    <li> Individual packs pertain no serum at all!  No result!  Do not recommend.</li>
    <li> Prety good . Have not use them enough to see a big difference</li>
    <li> I have really bad dark circles from lack of sleep. I tried these eye mask and love it! I am seeing my dark circles and bags disappear. It fits snug against my skin and feel like I am in my own spa. The price is great for the quantity you receive and it works too! This is a great gift for those who need this and great to have. Men must use these as well, I have been forcing my husband to use this and he is looking more awake.</li>
    <li> They initially feel great but they slide around and you are always pushing them back in place unless you are lying flat on your back.  Definitely cannot be used while sleeping as they would never ever stay on....will not purchase them again</li>
    <li> Loving these ingredients! Collagen, ginseng, multivitamins and more good things. The ingredients in these little things say enough. Lots of goodness in small packages. These are to be worn 15-20 mins at bed or rest time. I&#x27;m looking for good things to come from this product.</li>
    <li> I use these to help with my crows feet, wrinkles, and dark circles under my eyes.  These leave my eye area soft and moisturized.  I use these and go relax for about 20 min or so and everybody knows to leave me alone.  Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for an honest and unbiased opinion</li>
    <li> I used this for the first time last night and really loved how it made my eyes feel.  They were very easy to use...just washed my face and placed them under my eyes and relaxed for 15 minutes.  I then removed them and rinsed my face.  They were cold at first but not shockingly cold.  My eyes felt very refreshed after I took them off and my under eye bags weren&#x27;t as bad as they usually are.  It was very hydrating as well.  I really like using these eye masks.  Using them give me a reason to be still and relax because they are very wet and  will slide off your under eye area if you sit up or move around much.  You need to lay down and be still for them to stay in place.  Also be very careful when you take them out of the package because they are very delicate and you can tear them...they are a gel like consistency.

    <li> The Anti-aging collagen eye masks are amazing.  The results are wonderful.  I store these in the refrigerator for maximum de-puffing.  They are very cooling and really do work.  The skin under  my eyes immediately felt tighter but still very hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because the masks are stored in water in the package, I did have some issues with them slipping and not staying in place if I was upright.  I do suggest draining the liquid and letting them dry out a bit in the fridge before applying.  The results are immediate.  I cant wait to use them again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*sample provided for review</li>
    <li> the eye mask is great, but the fluid really really runs everywhere.  There are others I&#x27;ve tried that are a lot cleaner to use</li>
    <li> These Anti-Aging Collagen Eye Mask works really well.  I have used them twice and they come with 10 packages.  It&#x27;s very easy to use, wash your face and eyes with warm water.  Open the package and apply under your eye area. Leave on for 15 to 20 min then remove.  It does what it says it will do, it minimizes fine wrinkles, improves skin tone and texture.</li>
    <li> these work well.  I ordered the gold ones to try as well.</li>
    <li> Amazing... i also bought the face mask version for my wife!</li>
