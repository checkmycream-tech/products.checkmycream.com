      <li>/&gt;The first time I used the duo, I fell in LOVE!</li>
      <li>Not only did she want to make sure I was happy, but she also made some suggestions for an equally as fabulous shampoo and conditioner for my dog who also has itchy skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I noticed that my scalp is less dry,itchy and isn’t flaking at all,so I think all the moisturizing ingredients are whats helping that,so if you have dandruff,dry or itchy scalp,this shampoo and or conditioner would be awesome for you.</li>
      <li>Overall, I feel this is a great shampoo and conditioner set.</li>
      <li>No, this is not for sympathy, only to allow you to understand my appreciation of the availability of really great products online  </li>
      <li>my daughter hair was so smooth and shiny</li>
      <li>So far I am pretty happy with the results</li>
      <li>I love the product very much.</li>
      <li>Hope I&#x27;m correct on the intervals with this.&lt;br /&gt;Update on original review below</li>
      <li>Like the conditioner, shampoo doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel clean.</li>
      <li>This shampoo/conditioner combo softens my hair and gives my hair that clean feeling.</li>
      <li>No more static and it shines beautifully.</li>
      <li>The scent reminds me of the bubble gum toothpaste that the dentist uses to clean your teeth.  </li>
      <li>These products made my hair very soft and they have a nice fragrance.  </li>
      <li>I have bleach blond fried hair &amp; after using this my hair was softer, more manageable &amp; easier to combo, I didn&#x27;t have much breakable either.</li>
      <li>It seemed to require more product than recommended to shampoo hair and conditioner had to rinsed out really well</li>
      <li>shampoo leaves hair super clean without drying or stripping.</li>
      <li>I have less knots and my hair has this beautiful shine that I hadn&#x27;t seen in a while.</li>
      <li>And, your hair color will remain more vibrant for a longer period of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>cause it just looks super oily.  </li>
      <li>not only does it have Argan oil that has been proven to do amazing things for your hair</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using these products for a few days but already have seen great improvement. My hair is soft and glossy and my curls are bouncy. Frizz seems to have gone by the way side as well! The light orange fragrance is delightful too. I will definitely purchase again and highly recommend that everyone try them.</li>
    <li> Helps my curly, frizzy hair immensely!  Smooths my coarse blonde hair, blue eyes, pale skin.</li>
    <li> So far, a really lovely product.  Has a very pleasant scent (like an orange creamsicle tastes) and leaves my hair feeling very soft.  Shampoo does not lather a ton, so I have to use a little extra.  But I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always steered away from Argon Oil products because I have very fine hair, but this product left my hair soft and shiny but not weighed down like most Argon conditioners do.  It also had a yummy citrus scent, not a sweet perfumed smell that I am sensitive to. My daughter also tried the set and loved it! She said her hair never lays down smoothly after washing, but it did with these products.  Definitely will buy it again!!</li>
    <li> Here&#x27;s what my wife says (she&#x27;s happy, so I&#x27;m happy!): I actually love this product. I have fairly curly hair and it&#x27;s always a lot of work to straighten it. After using this argan oil shampoo and conditioner it is now so much easier to manage. Usually when I come out of the shower my hair is like a rat&#x27;s nest, and now, combing it through is so much easier. And straightening it with my hair dryer goes twice as fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it for a while, my hair is much smoother than with my old shampoo. People have noticed and commented on that as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product, I love the feel of my hair after using it. I&#x27;m really impressed!!</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:1e88c1a1124a711a21bb506ecea4c69b]] This has been amazing for healing my dry itchy scalp and creating body. I love this product not only does it have Argan oil that has been proven to do amazing things for your hair but it also doesn&#x27;t have the harsh cancer causing chemicals. I am so glad I decided to try this product and have been completely happy with my results</li>
    <li> After using this product for about a week I&#x27;d say overall, this product works well on all hair types --- fine, straight, color-treated hair, to fine untreated long hair, to thick, wavy hair with scalp issues (oily/dandruff). The product provided SOFTNESS and VOLUME to me and daughters&#x27; respective hair types. It seemed to also helped with dandruff and dry, itchy scalp issues. The product also smells a Dreamsicle, but it&#x27;s not overbearing. So why not 5 stars?  It seemed to require more product than recommended to shampoo hair and conditioner had to rinsed out really well or hair felt oily at roots. Shampooing intervals can be stretched to every 2 days. When the product arrived the inner seal in the conditioner was loose and some product had spilled.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference in my hair texture but the smell is wonderful!</li>
    <li> i try this product after a swimming pool day and it works great for my daughter hair (thin and curly) but didn&#x27;t work for mine (thick,Straightened,colored). my daughter hair was so smooth and shiny,i didn&#x27;t see any different on mine...</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product!!! Worked wonders for my dry, frizzy, dull, thin hair!</li>
    <li> These products are great - my hair is soft and smells great.</li>
    <li> was good at first , then made my hair dry, had to return. Good people though!</li>
    <li> This shampoo/conditioner combo softens my hair and gives my hair that clean feeling. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Being a pool owner in the summer and living in pretty much Antarctica and cranking the heat all winter... My hair gets pretty dry! Argan oil is seriously the thing that keeps my hair silly and smooth! No more nettle hair for me now that I started using this shampoo and conditioner:)</li>
    <li> LuxeOrganix Shampoo + Conditioner helps to moisturize your hair whether you’re spending your days in the chlorine of the pool, the salt of the ocean, or under a wool cap when it’s cold with its UV and thermal protectant as well as vitamins and antioxidants.  It’s perfect for natural, dry, coarse, fine, curly, or straight hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LuxOrganix helps to nourish and repair your hair from the damage of blow dryers, curling irons, straighteners, coloring, and all sorts of products.  Your hair will be healthier, shinier, and have a more youthful appearance.  And, your hair color will remain more vibrant for a longer period of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the issues I have with conditioners is that it makes my hair too soft.  With LuxeOrganix condition, it doesn’t leave my baby fine hair overly conditioned and soft.  I’m still able to use it and then style my hair.  The style holds for the whole day with my regular hair care routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite thing about this shampoo and conditioner combo is that they smell so good!  The scent reminds me of the bubble gum toothpaste that the dentist uses to clean your teeth.  Thankfully, I don’t smell like bubble gum all day, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LuxeOrganix contains no sulfates, parabens, or sodium chloride; ingredients that are thought to possibly cause itchy scalp and serious skin irritation as well as disease, hair loss, and damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A bonus of using LuxeOrganix is that they are a very proactive and communicative company and were great to work with.  Not only do I recommend LuxeOrganix Shampoo and Conditioner, I recommend the company, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m a product review blogger and I received this product in exchange for an honest review.</li>
    <li> Bought the shampoo and conditioner and its a great product.I love it. It&#x27;s the best shampoo and conditioner I have ever used. Leaves my hair silky and soft. I&#x27;ve recommend it to my daughters and they love it too.</li>
    <li> My hair is super soft and manageable! Great product</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner.  So far I&#x27;ve only used it 3 times, but it really makes my hair soft and manageable. The smell is lovely, citrusy like an orange creamsicle. I have no complaints, because of the natural ingredients, of course it&#x27;s not going to lather up a ton. That doesn&#x27;t bother me, more than other natural shampoos, it lathers quite a bit and my hair felt very clean. The conditioner made my thick hair very easy to comb through. Overall, I feel this is a great shampoo and conditioner set.</li>
    <li> First let me say it smells wonderful!  The shampoo let it feeling nice, and clean without weighing it down or drying it out. The conditioner slid on like silk. Left it moisturized, but not greasy, or heavy. And yes I noticed volume. Thanks will gladly reorder!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using the shampoo and conditioner for a week now and can&#x27;t image ever going back to any other shampoo or conditioner brand. After the very first washing I noticed a difference in my naturally curling hair. My curls were softer and shinier and less frizzy (a comb can go through my curls easily when i had the conditioner still in, that doesn&#x27;t happen often). My hair feels fuller and is much more manageable. I have recommended LuxeOrganix to my friends and family. Getting use to a shampoo that doesn&#x27;t lather like others takes time, but i don&#x27;t have to use as much shampoo or conditioner to get the results of beautiful clean hair.</li>
    <li> I love the product very much.</li>
    <li> I stumbled upon this shampoo and conditioner on Amazon. I was simply looking for a decent sulfate free shampoo. The reviews were good so I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used the duo, I fell in LOVE! Holy WOW..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have SOOO many great things to say about this duo. However, if you&#x27;re like me, you like reviews summed up in just a few words. So here goes... As brief but helpful as I can!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line - I am a highlighted blonde who is in desperate need of a highlight. Hence, dark roots. This shampoo and conditioner I swear makes my hair so gorgeous and shiny, the roots take a back seat!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never smelled a shampoo and conditioner so delicious... Yummy orange sickle!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have an itchy scalp and was hesitant to apply the conditioner to my scalp especially since my roots are months overdue. After reading about this duo, I did as instructed and NO MORE ITCH!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo leaves hair super clean without drying or stripping. The conditioner reminds me of silk. My hair feels like it soaks up all of the rich, conditioning ingredients and rinses clean leaving behind a lightweight glossy finish. I can get my fingers through from root to tip after just a minute on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To top it all off, I got an email from from the founder/President of the company making sure I was happy with my purchase. Um.... I have NEVER had anyone care if I liked my hair products.  Not only did she want to make sure I was happy, but she also made some suggestions for an equally as fabulous shampoo and conditioner for my dog who also has itchy skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a customer for LIFE!!</li>
    <li> Good Morning, Christine.  I&#x27;m having a lovely week, yes.  I did receive the LuxeOrganix By Designe Rejuvenating Argan Oil Shampoo &amp; Conditioner via Amazon.  It&#x27;s my pleasure to respond with feedback, and congratulations on your business.  First, let me say that I have been diagnosed with a serious disease since Dec., 2014.  Prior to that time, I would be free to go out and shop.  No, this is not for sympathy, only to allow you to understand my appreciation of the availability of really great products online  After my diagnosis and being placed on oxygen 24/7,  I began to shop for nearly everything online.  While there have been some &amp;#34;hits &amp; misses&amp;#34;,  I have to say your products stand out as perhaps the only really stellar products that I&#x27;ve purchased.  Yes, many selections in different categories have met and exceeded my expectations; however your shampoo &amp; conditioner are magnificent!  I have very thin, fine, naturally straight hair.  My medications, one in particular, causes hair loss.  That being said, I was afraid of the word &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34;.  The shampoo/conditioner, from their delicate scent of orange, to the gentle cleansing and light conditioning, rinse beautifully.  My hair had no little tangles; it smelled like Heaven, and I simply blow-dried my hair on cool setting.  What a pleasure to find such a well-made product.  I wish you the greatest success.&lt;br /&gt;With Every Good Wish To You, Christine,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delores</li>
    <li> Smells good--- Conditioner was great-- but didnt work for me. Seller was great and stood behind product.</li>
    <li> I have been on a search to find a great shampoo and conditioner set to help with my hair. Recently I have been fighting damage hair and dry and itchy scalp. It seems like I can not find the right combo set until now. My friend recommended LuxeOrganix Argan Oil Shamppo and conditioner set. This set is decently priced and you get a decent amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first tried this product I had to see what it smelt like. That factor will break or make a product for me. I have a sensitive nose and if I don&#x27;t like the scent or it’s to overpowering I will discontinue the product. This shampoo and conditioner worked very well. It lathered decent and my hair felt great. It did not feel greasy or oily after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this product I noticed that my hair looked amazing. It looked healthier and smoother. It looked like it used to. I also noticed that my scalp was not as itchy as it used to be. I was quite amazed with this product. I would defiantly continue using this shampoo and conditioner set and would definitely recommend it to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> These products made my hair very soft and they have a nice fragrance.  I SO much dislike overpowering scents and this shampoo and conditioner have a subtlety pleasant fragrance.  I am curious to see how these products work during the winter months when I usually have a lot of trouble with static and flyaway hair.</li>
    <li> I was able to get this product for an awesome price to try it out &amp; review. I have used the shampoo &amp; conditioner, I love that it&#x27;s FREE of Sulfates Parabens Sodium Chloride, actually good for my hair. I have bleach blond fried hair &amp; after using this my hair was softer, more manageable &amp; easier to combo, I didn&#x27;t have much breakable either. I would buy this again &amp; will let me friends know that complement my hair looking healthier what I&#x27;m using.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner. I am a licensed cosmetologist and I think this is one of the best products I have ever tried. My husband is allergic to many products, he has used this for nearly a month and his scalp loves it. Normally his scalp is very dry and flaky, now it is almost normal again. He and I both really love this line, and it smells great as well.</li>
    <li> I got this argan oil shampoo and conditioner when a friend of mine told me that it was helpful for men, too, especially for helping with dry scalp issues. After using it just 2 times my scalp dryness was gone. I didn’t realize the other products I was using were the culprit of my itchy, flaky head. It wasn’t like the other store bought products I normally buy, it’s smoother and richer (maybe that’s what gives it the luxurious feeling and why it’s called LuxeOrganix?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I’d change is the fragrance (it’s kind of citrus smelling), but maybe that’s just cause I’m a guy. It’s not overbearing, so it won’t keep me from using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for my overall experience, I have to say I was really surprised. From the packaging, to how it felt when I used it, to how I felt after using. The bottles look good chilling in the shampoo holder in the shower. Oh, and I got an email from the seller making sure everything was perfect…that was neat! I’ve never received that from any seller on Amazon. I felt like they really want to make this a great experience.</li>
    <li> UPDATE: Also recently used the NEW LuxeOrganix CoWash. I have to say, from a previous WEN user, this is a WINNER!!! You don&#x27;t use as much as what WEN recommends, it smells wonderful and not pungent, the texture it great and it costs much less. It made my hair feel a look wonderful!!!! This is to be used to alternate with the LuxeOrganix Shampoo and Conditioner every few washings and I believe with all three I am now set! Hope I&#x27;m correct on the intervals with this.&lt;br /&gt;Update on original review below: Since August, my first purchase of S &amp; C, I had been experimenting with this brand shampoo and conditioner and trying other natural and organic products, less expensive lets say, to see if the differences were big enough to stick with it. EVERYTIME I used LuxeOrganix I had a great hair day! Every single time! When I did not, well not so good. With my wavy, thick, color treated, shoulder length hair it&#x27;s not easy to find natural products that will tackle it successfully. Definitely a difference that you can see. Try the COWASH especially if you are a WEN user in addition to the shampoo and conditioner. So glad I stumbled upon this brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prior review:I do like how it makes my thick, color treated hair feel. Easy to manage for sure. I will have to use it a bit longer to really know if my hair likes it. I&#x27;ve tried so many different  natural shampoos, cleansing conditioners, etc.out there on the market. LuxeOrganix is definitely high up on the list of WELL DONE ones so far! Great customer service, I might add, when I had questions about the product. She knows her stuff! Look forward to other products they come out with.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased LuxeOrganix Rejuvenating Argon shampoo and conditioner and I&#x27;m very happy with the product! My hair feels healthy and alive. The refreshing scent is an added bonus.  Knowing the product is organic and healthy is a plus. I can&#x27;t wait to try future products!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this products, I feel like I&#x27;m getting salon treatment every time I shower.  I am left with this amazing fructis smell in my hair for days. My frizzy curly hair is now under control it does not frizz at all. My hair has gotten it&#x27;s body and volume back. Ever since I bleached my hair for highlights I&#x27;ve been having trouble trying to get my hair healthy again. And with this rejuvenating argon oil shampoo and conditioner it leaves my hair smooth and soft, super manageable I have less knots and my hair has this beautiful shine that I hadn&#x27;t seen in a while. It makes me feel so confident, I can now get out the shower and just air dry my hair without worrying about the frizz as well when I straighten it I used to get a puffy straight hair and now it&#x27;s just perfect.This product Contains a UV and Thermal Protectant with Vitamins and antioxidants this will nourish and repair dry hair from daily use of a straight iron or curling iron, or chemically harm to your hair. This product is harsh chemical free so you know your not gonna have any harmful ingredients can cause itchy scalp and serious skin irritation and disease, hair loss and damage. LuxeOrganix contains NO sulfates, parabens or sodium.  This set also includes a UV absorber designed to protect hair and prevent fading of color.  As well it has Vitamin B5 that penetrates through the cuticle of the hair, resulting in hair that is stronger, thicker and younger looking.Though I received this product for free in exchange for my honest, unbiased review, I have to say that this is one of the best shampoos and conditioners I have ever tried - it&#x27;s in my top 3 favorites.</li>
    <li> Wonderful products! My hair feels wonderful and so much more healthy. No more static and it shines beautifully.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo and conditioner I have ever used on my hair. My hair feels so soft and silky.  It makes beautiful curls.  Makes my hair is so beautiful.  I love it.</li>
    <li> I have very fine thin wavy hair and a friend of mine told me about LuxeOrganix. So I thought I would give it a try. My hair is also very oily and I have to wash my hair every day cause it just looks super oily.  After the first couple of washes with LuxeOrganix my hair and my curls felt very soft. My daughter has been using it as well and she has very curly hair but straightens it every day. She too says her hair feels really soft. (maybe she will stop straightening it so much). I also stopped washing my hair everyday and wash it every other day it does not seem to be as oily.  It also smells like Orange Sorbet and makes you want to eat it:)  So far I am pretty happy with the results and I&#x27;m recommending it to my sisters and my friends!</li>
    <li> Like the conditioner, shampoo doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel clean. Went back to using my regular shampoo with the conditioner.</li>
    <li> First thing I noticed about this product is that its smells so good,the scent to me smells like bubble gum or cotton candy,it smells sweet too,i love it,its also a light bubble gum pink color.It has argon oil in it which is amazing for your hair,it also moisturizes your hair,without weighing it down or making it greasy,i did notice my hair feeling greasy the day after I used it,twice,but it was also around 90 and humid,so I think its just the weather,all the other times I used it,it kept my hair clean for around 3 days,which is my normal.This shampoo and conditioner is also safe for color treated hair.It did make a noticeable difference in the dryness in my hair. I noticed my hair was less frizzy,but it was not voluminous,or all that soft. Since using these together and not many others in between I noticed that my scalp is less dry,itchy and isn’t flaking at all,so I think all the moisturizing ingredients are whats helping that,so if you have dandruff,dry or itchy scalp,this shampoo and or conditioner would be awesome for you.This product has no harsh chemicals or sulfates in it,which is awesome,and so much better for us.It also lathers very well and especially on the shampoo,you don’t need that much,so it should last a long time,i have been using mines for over a month and I have to even used a fraction of the bottle,using it almost every time I shower,i also want to mention that my hair is quiet longI received this product for free,for review purposes,all thoughts and or opinions are my own and I was not compensated.</li>
    <li> I have heard a lot about Argan Oil but was hesitant to try it because I have fine hair and any residue left by hair products makes it limp and hard to manage. I live in the desert and keeping my hair, skin, and nails hydrated is an ongoing battle. I found LuxeOrganix Argan Oil Shampoo and was pleasantly surprised at how clean and moisturized it left my hair...no residue. Typically, I do not like fragrance of any kind in my hair products but the subtle scent of ​​​the shampoo and conditioner were pleasant and not overbearing. I would definitely recommend these products!</li>
