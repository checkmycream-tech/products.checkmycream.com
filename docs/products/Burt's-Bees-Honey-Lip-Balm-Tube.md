      <li>although it is not expensive, but it has a perfect effect, great product!</li>
      <li>The Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm however has a pleasant &amp;#34;taste&amp;#34; and is not to goopy or sticky.</li>
      <li>You feel good using it.</li>
      <li>it smells so good.</li>
      <li>This stuff must be good, my wife likes it.  </li>
      <li>My Daughter love all of Burt&#x27;s products !</li>
      <li>I love this Chapstick!</li>
      <li>However, as soon as I applied it, my lips felt amazing.</li>
      <li>Nice lip moisturizer ...</li>
      <li>The size of the container is handy -- I put it in my shirt pocket as I work at home.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried cheap lip balms and they were not as good as this.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t have a soft or flexible texture so it doesn&#x27;t apply well to your lips, and even after that isn&#x27;t very good with moisturizing them in any way.</li>
      <li>It is much better than lip smackers (which is chalky, but great flavored), but it is the same quality to me as Chap Stick, and Blistex, and not as good as Softlips.</li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>soothing treat for any time of the year, minty and refreshing.</li>
      <li>I love this lip balm.</li>

      <li>I love all the Burts Bees products.</li>
      <li>I love having these delivered 3 at a time.</li>
      <li>Needs to be applied more often.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm, but don&#x27;t like this honey version.</li>
      <li>What more can one ask for a lip balm?</li>
      <li>I love the taste of honey</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my favorite of all their products.</li>
      <li>Thank you, much love.</li>
      <li>Have used this for lots of years and love it.  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>Great price, feels good on dry lips.  </li>
      <li>Burt&#x27;s Bees, famous for their natural beauty products, has now added honey powder to the already delicious lip balm, known for its fresh pepperminty flavor.</li>
      <li>It was with great intrigue that I decided to try the new version.</li>
      <li>Like the original better</li>
      <li>My lips chap easily</li>
      <li>It smelled like strong baby powder.</li>
      <li>This lip balm tastes and smells strongly of baby powder.</li>
      <li>The texture is slightly more grainy upon application because of the honey powder, but it quickly turns silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really enjoy the flavor.</li>
      <li>Smooth application with healing comfrey root.</li>
      <li>Goes on creamy and not greasy, velvety smooth.</li>
      <li>great lip balm, like having different flavors</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great to keep several in the house and pocket book at all times, in case you misplace one.  </li>
      <li>Comfortable product</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t wear off like most lip balms and is very gentle with no pulling of the lips when applying.</li>
      <li>but the Honey one only is amazing!</li>
      <li>if you expect a smooth sweet honey taste you will not like this..</li>
      <li>is a comparison between this product and the original version:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beeswax</li>
      <li>Leaves your lips protected for a long time and smells great.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite chapstick in the whole world.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not too sweet.  </li>
      <li>Once it&#x27;s on, your lips feel immediately much more moisturized, and then you&#x27;re comfortable enough that it slips your mind altogether.  </li>
      <li>There&#x27;s not much to review about any lip balm, but it smells, good</li>
      <li>so you know I&#x27;m not someone who buys beauty products for fun and for the novelty of it.  </li>
      <li>For me, the Lifeguard Lip Balm felt chalky, the regular Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Balm had a nice peppermint flavor but was otherwise unremarkable, and the Honey Lip Balm had the smoothest and richest feel of all.  </li>
      <li>I would give this product a 4 or 5 if it was a more reasonable price compared to it&#x27;s competition, but it isn&#x27;t well priced either online or in the store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest it to people, mainly people who prefer organic items or more natural items.</li>
      <li>I just used the one at my desk right now (this honey one I&#x27;m reviewing)</li>
      <li>This stuff it very pure untouched honey....</li>
      <li>Other chapsticks such as Baby Lips feel nice on your lips but pool in the creases of them and goes away easily--leaving your lips more chapped than before!</li>
      <li>no harsh chemicals,no strong fragrance.</li>
      <li>I keep many of these around, especially in the winter.</li>
      <li>Love the organic ingredients and the sheer look</li>
      <li>may want to order many since you will be using it daily.</li>
      <li>It wouldn&#x27;t be my first suggestion to people though, softlips would be.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to go out on a limb here (noticing that the regular Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Balm already has 55 glowing Amazon reviews) and say that this Honey Lip Balm is better.  </li>
      <li>I personally feel like this dries out my lips more.</li>
      <li>She said her chapped lips were better the next day...</li>
      <li>I am addicted to BB, this is the best, all natural lip balm I have ever used.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll admit, when I first smelled it, I was very hesitant.</li>
      <li>We use a wood burning stove from about October through May, and it causes your skin to be more dry.  </li>
      <li>not as good as i think, and it is not suitable for me.</li>
      <li>great, don&#x27;t understand why this one is such a waste of money.</li>
      <li>It works very well.</li>
      <li>I really like this lip balm.  </li>
      <li>In fact I have absolutely zero interest in cosmetics (and don&#x27;t even wear them)</li>
      <li>The honey version doesn&#x27;t have the menthol or burning sensation on their very chapped lips.</li>
      <li>very luxurious feeling.</li>
      <li>It really does the job as well.</li>
      <li>other than that I need to buy more.</li>
      <li>More waxy and less honey-tasting than I expected but still ok.</li>
      <li>It does a decent job as a chapstick, but im not a fan of the taste.  </li>
      <li>That&#x27;s what I want is a lip gloss that feels so natural that you forget you&#x27;re wearing it.d, and then you&#x27;re comfortable enough that it slips your mind altogether.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>This poses a real problem during the Winter because my lips always get super dry and chapped.</li>
      <li>It gets the job done, it feels good, and it isn&#x27;t flavored poorly.</li>
      <li>/&gt;A slightly more nourishing formula that seems to last a bit longer and has appeal for dry weather.</li>
      <li>Much much different than the original Burt&#x27;s Bees which I generally like.</li>
      <li>But, gosh, your lips get just as dry indoors, and I go through the tube of Honey Lip Balm that I keep near my computer pretty fast.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Totally worth the money, I love the honey flavor because it&#x27;s not over powering and too artificial like other balms.</li>
    <li> I really like this lip balm.  Works well and keeps my lips soft.</li>
    <li> I found the flavor and scent of this to be very fake and overpowering, which bummed me out because I typically love this brand.  I typically lose my chapsticks, and I won&#x27;t be sad when this one meets its ultimate fate, other than that I need to buy more.</li>
    <li> great lip balm, like having different flavors</li>
    <li> This is the worst lip balm since Chapstick Original. It goes on rough but the worst is smell / taste. It smells like old ladies&#x27; hand cream. It makes me gag, the smell is that bad. Instead of just tossing it out, I have been using it on the dog&#x27;s foot pads. It  has worked to keep them from cracking and the dogs don&#x27;t lick it off.</li>
    <li> I personally feel like this dries out my lips more. The product has a plastic-y consistency. Much much different than the original Burt&#x27;s Bees which I generally like.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite chapstick in the whole world. It smells wonderful. The skin on my lips is very sensitive and most other brands of chapstick (even other flavors of Burt&#x27;s Bees and some other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; brands) will make the skin on my lips peel off. But this one doesn&#x27;t. I have chapsticks all over the house because I can&#x27;t stand the feeling of having dry lips. I just used the one at my desk right now (this honey one I&#x27;m reviewing) and yum it smells so good. It goes on smooth, doesn&#x27;t leave any chunks, not too thick not too thin, lasts long.</li>
    <li> I love this lip balm. It&#x27;s not like other lip balms that leave your lips in constant need of another application. This lip balm leaves my lips feeling moisturized well after an application.</li>
    <li> Just the same as its intro!</li>
    <li> This stuff it very pure untouched honey.... Meaning it is not sweet at all so if you expect a smooth sweet honey taste you will not like this.. Like most burts bees chapsticks it also hard to apply and very stiff....this is just not my faavorite chapstick, but i can&#x27;t say it doesn&#x27;t do it&#x27;s job.</li>
    <li> This lip balm is awesome. There&#x27;s not much to review about any lip balm, but it smells, good, it&#x27;s not too greasy, and it works well. It doesn&#x27;t have that medicated scent to it that you would get from a regular lip balm, and it&#x27;s not over bearing like those fake berry or apple scents.</li>
    <li> Great lip balm. Smells really great, just like honey. Goes on creamy and not greasy, velvety smooth. Feels great on your lips and protects as well. very luxurious feeling. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Love the hint of honey you can smell and taste. Works wonderfully!</li>
    <li> I love having these delivered 3 at a time. Comfortable product no harsh chemicals,no strong fragrance.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going to go out on a limb here (noticing that the regular Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Balm already has 55 glowing Amazon reviews) and say that this Honey Lip Balm is better.  I&#x27;m no cosmetic expert.  In fact I have absolutely zero interest in cosmetics (and don&#x27;t even wear them) so you know I&#x27;m not someone who buys beauty products for fun and for the novelty of it.  But I live in the desert where the dry air desiccates your skin and lips, and having dry lips drives me nuts.  I literally have to carry around a tube of lip-gloss and apply it every 5 minutes.  So I&#x27;ve gotten extremely picky about what works and what feels drying or greasy or weird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most lip glosses feel simultaneously too greasy and too drying to me.  I think this is because they&#x27;re loaded with chemical protection from UVA and UVB sun-rays.  That or they feel chalky because they have organic protection like zinc oxide built in, which is the case with Burt&#x27;s Bees Lifeguard Lip Balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lip balm I have to wear outside is Blistex Fruit Smoothies with an SPF of 15 because, in the high desert, you just don&#x27;t want to mess around with anything less in the way of UVA/UVB protection (and that includes the zinc oxide stuff) unless you have actual chemical allergies.  The Blistex Fruit Smoothies is the only lip gloss with measurable SPF that I can stand the feel of.  The Burt&#x27;s Bees Honey Lip Balm feels ten times better than the Blistex to me; unfortunately, its SPF (Sun Protection Factor) is nill.  That&#x27;s the only reason I&#x27;m giving it less than 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balms are, for me, strictly for indoors.  But, gosh, your lips get just as dry indoors, and I go through the tube of Honey Lip Balm that I keep near my computer pretty fast.  For me, the Lifeguard Lip Balm felt chalky, the regular Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Balm had a nice peppermint flavor but was otherwise unremarkable, and the Honey Lip Balm had the smoothest and richest feel of all.  Once it&#x27;s on, your lips feel immediately much more moisturized, and then you&#x27;re comfortable enough that it slips your mind altogether.  That&#x27;s what I want is a lip gloss that feels so natural that you forget you&#x27;re wearing it.d, and then you&#x27;re comfortable enough that it slips your mind altogether.  That&#x27;s what I want is a lip gloss that feels so natural that you forget you&#x27;re wearing it.</li>
    <li> I hate wearing anything on my lips because most of the products out there have a bad taste. This poses a real problem during the Winter because my lips always get super dry and chapped. The Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm however has a pleasant &amp;#34;taste&amp;#34; and is not to goopy or sticky.</li>
    <li> I am addicted to BB, this is the best, all natural lip balm I have ever used. I always have several within reach.</li>
    <li> Nice lip moisturizer ...I spend a lot of time in the sun, so i carry this with me and use it a lot.  It works very well.</li>
    <li> Shipped fast and as expected.</li>
    <li> worst product ever, forget if you think there will be even a slight flavor, none at all!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> It is a gift.&lt;br /&gt;It is great.&lt;br /&gt;If you have allergies it fulfill the requirement.&lt;br /&gt;You may want to order many since you will be using it daily.</li>
    <li> Long lasting smoothness and protection. Love the organic ingredients and the sheer look I get from this. Great every day balm.</li>
    <li> Takes a bit of wear to soften it up. Smells natural. Goes on lips well when softened. Stays on long and keeps lips moisturized even after you cannot feel it when you rub your lips together. Other chapsticks such as Baby Lips feel nice on your lips but pool in the creases of them and goes away easily--leaving your lips more chapped than before! This chapstick seems to blur out any creases and is neither glossy or matte. At school, I need around 1-2 reapplies (8hrs), meanwhile, Baby Lips needs a reapply after every 20 mins.</li>
    <li> Great moisturize for your lips</li>
    <li> Hard to wear lipstick on this without the lipsstick coming off. Very good though. I&#x27;ve tried cheap lip balms and they were not as good as this. Since I started using this, my lips no longer peel or dry out. I apply it twice a day in morning and night. It does have a smell, but it&#x27;s just the smell of honey. It doesn&#x27;t stink to me. It&#x27;s also cheaper at target, so I will be buying it from there from now on.</li>
    <li> More waxy and less honey-tasting than I expected but still ok.</li>
    <li> I use oxygen and this  product contains does not contain oil or any other flammable products.  Three cheers to Burt&#x27;s Bees.  It really does the job as well.</li>
    <li> Ive been using this chalp stick for years; chalp sticks use to tear up my lips leaving them cracked unless i constantly used, like my lips were addicted and needed their drug, but burts bees is amazing; it works very well, last a long time, and i dont feel like im in panic mode if i leave the house without it as it repairs my lips for permanent change. However DO NOT try the mint one! It cracks my lips but the Honey one only is amazing! Its the only thing ill use!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really enjoy the flavor. But it moisture my lip well.</li>
    <li> I personally didn&#x27;t like the flavor, but gave it to my daughter &amp; she loves it! She said her chapped lips were better the next day...&lt;br /&gt;I am going to try it in a different flavor...</li>
    <li> Great price, feels good on dry lips.  What more can one ask for a lip balm?</li>
    <li> Kept our lips moist during the harsh Midwestern winter.</li>
    <li> I love all the Burts Bees products.</li>
    <li> My Daughter love all of Burt&#x27;s products !</li>
    <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees, famous for their natural beauty products, has now added honey powder to the already delicious lip balm, known for its fresh pepperminty flavor. It was with great intrigue that I decided to try the new version. Alas, it does not have the same tingly peppermint flavor, but is milder and has more honey mystique. The texture is slightly more grainy upon application because of the honey powder, but it quickly turns silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is a comparison between this product and the original version:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beeswax Lip Balm - Ingredients: Beeswax, coconut oil, sunflower oil, vitamin E, lanoline, peppermint oil, comfrey root extract, rosemary extract.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A soothing treat for any time of the year, minty and refreshing. Smooth application with healing comfrey root. Made me an instant Burt&#x27;s Bees fan. Needs to be applied more often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honey Lip Balm - Ingredients: Shea butter, almond oil, cocoa butter, coconut oil, beeswax, candelila wax, lanolin, comfrey root, honey powder, rosemary extract, vegetable oil, fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A slightly more nourishing formula that seems to last a bit longer and has appeal for dry weather. Seems to last a bit longer and has a richer texture once applied. Soothing comfort, perfect for outdoor life or applying before you put on lipstick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only solution for anyone who misses the peppermint flavor is to apply both at the same time. I like that we now have two options because I can use the honey flavor before applying lipstick and then apply a vanilla lip gloss. I could see an entire line of various flavors appearing. How about vanilla, chocolate and cinnamon?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review, wearing both at once</li>
    <li> This lip balm tastes and smells strongly of baby powder. I had to wash it off immediately. I feel very disappointed that i wasted money on this lip balm. Sadly Burt&#x27;s Bees has no satisfaction guarantee.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Leaves your lips protected for a long time and smells great.</li>
    <li> This stuff tastes terrible! It&#x27;s kind of like a fake baby powder smell. Uhg.</li>
    <li> It doesnt glide smoothly on my lips, bit on the dry side, strong weird honey smell, and no moisturizing effect at all.&lt;br /&gt;I live in tropical country so its funny how the lip balm in this hot weather has no effect at all and quite difficult to apply.</li>
    <li> I will admit this is a great chap stick. It gets the job done, it feels good, and it isn&#x27;t flavored poorly. It is much better than lip smackers (which is chalky, but great flavored), but it is the same quality to me as Chap Stick, and Blistex, and not as good as Softlips. I would give this product a 4 or 5 if it was a more reasonable price compared to it&#x27;s competition, but it isn&#x27;t well priced either online or in the store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest it to people, mainly people who prefer organic items or more natural items. It wouldn&#x27;t be my first suggestion to people though, softlips would be.</li>
    <li> We use a wood burning stove from about October through May, and it causes your skin to be more dry.  Someone recommended this Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm.  I love the taste of honey so thought why not try the honey version?  I love it.  It&#x27;s not too sweet.  It stays on your lips for awhile.  The size of the container is handy -- I put it in my shirt pocket as I work at home.  If you apply it morning, noon and night, it should keep your lips from drying out and cracking if you&#x27;re in a dry climate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to buy several at once. It&#x27;s great to keep several in the house and pocket book at all times, in case you misplace one.  I don&#x27;t like to go a day without applying this, so don&#x27;t want to run out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ad says it&#x27;s 99.82 natural.  You feel good using it.</li>
    <li> Even if you can get passed the absolutely horrible smell of this chapstick it&#x27;s still not good. Doesn&#x27;t have a soft or flexible texture so it doesn&#x27;t apply well to your lips, and even after that isn&#x27;t very good with moisturizing them in any way. I&#x27;ve used other chapsticks from this company that work (and smell) great, don&#x27;t understand why this one is such a waste of money.</li>
    <li> although it is not expensive, but it has a perfect effect, great product!</li>
    <li> Keeps my lips from drying out much better than chapstick</li>
    <li> It does a decent job as a chapstick, but im not a fan of the taste.  Also, it feels greasy on the lips.</li>
    <li> wonderful product!! I would recomend it to anyone. It doesn&#x27;t wear off like most lip balms and is very gentle with no pulling of the lips when applying.</li>
    <li> Perfect lip balm with a perfect price!</li>
    <li> not as good as i think, and it is not suitable for me.</li>
    <li> not what I expected.  Like the original better</li>
    <li> I love burts bees but this scent was terrible. It made me feel sick just putting it on. Same this happened with my wife.</li>
    <li> This stuff must be good, my wife likes it.  I&#x27;ve never tried it myself but she asks for it every Christmas.</li>
    <li> Smells and tastes TERRIBLE.  Yuck!!!</li>
    <li> I love this Chapstick! I&#x27;ll admit, when I first smelled it, I was very hesitant. It smelled like strong baby powder. However, as soon as I applied it, my lips felt amazing. My lips chap easily, it&#x27;s frustrating to find a product that lasts for the long run. Burt&#x27;s Bees has proven to be a reliable brand. Thank you, much love.</li>
    <li> This is the only lip balm our kids will use. The honey version doesn&#x27;t have the menthol or burning sensation on their very chapped lips. I keep many of these around, especially in the winter.</li>
    <li> Have used this for lots of years and love it.  Can&#x27;t go to sleep at night without having it on and it stays on all night!</li>
    <li> Love Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm, but don&#x27;t like this honey version. Tastes and smells weird.</li>
    <li> Moist effect is good，but smell too strange。</li>
    <li> The box was empty! The lip balm with honey is difficult to find in my area. It&#x27;s my favorite of all their products. It would rate 5 stars from me for the product itself. The little lip balm container within the package was empty, with no lip balm whatsoever in the main package.</li>
    <li> Just cannot get past the cloying scent-taste of baby powder-surprisingly bad for Burt&#x27;s bees.</li>
    <li> This is great. It hydrates me extremely dry lips in a day or two, and I don&#x27;t need to use it everyday.</li>
