      <li>I will never buy another nail polish unless it is from a reputable store.</li>
      <li>This is a fantastic product!  </li>
      <li>Formaldehyde free!</li>
      <li>I do not think I will even be able to use it as directed for a week.  </li>
      <li>I had purchased Barielle nail rebuilding protein prior to this purchase and used it weekly with wonderful results.  </li>
      <li>It works much better than nail polish.</li>
      <li>My nails have grown out and look so much better.  </li>
      <li>These products are TOTALLY worth it!!  </li>

      <li>Was a type of polish finish prevents absorbing of building cream by beriella a much more effective product</li>

      <li>Another great nail product that does not dry up the cuticles.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how smooth my nails looked.</li>
      <li>Great for getting my nails back into condition after having gel nails all summer.</li>
      <li>I cannot say enough good stuff about this product.  </li>
      <li>I guess it&#x27;s rare for a man to have this problem.  </li>
      <li>It is worth every dime.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used OPI Nail Envy before and liked it; this seemed similar.</li>
      <li>This is a good product but doesn&#x27;t dry as fast as others I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
      <li>I waited this long to write a review because I wanted to really share a useful review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  1 month later and these products are still amazing!!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many a product to deal with splitting and weak nails -- this one really works, and I&#x27;m delighted with it.</li>
      <li>I switched to this, along with the nail strengthener cream and voila, for the first time IN MY LIFE</li>
      <li>I discovered this product and in about 10 months my nails were repaired back to a healthy appearance.  </li>
      <li>I was first introduced to this treatment in a manicure gift I received about a year ago.</li>
      <li>While I did experience more nail growth than usual and loved the shine of the initial application, my nails continued to peel and split.</li>
      <li>Granted, I do have a pretty strong sense of smell, but still, OPI or Sally Hansen never lasted this long or smelled this chemical-perfumey.  </li>
      <li>I had high hopes for this Barielle product since I&#x27;ve had success with them before - however this particular one was not what I&#x27;d hoped for.</li>
      <li>This has made my nails grow a little faster, and it has a nice shine to it.  </li>
      <li>Somehow my nails got very damaged, were splitting, breaking.</li>
      <li>It is the only thing that allowed me to free myself of years of acrylic nails.</li>
      <li>This product has really helped rebuild my nails.</li>
      <li>Works very well.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not goopy and it dries clear and quickly with a nice subtle shine.</li>
      <li>When I decided to take them off, I tried many products to bring my nails back from their short, peeling, brittle state.  </li>
      <li>I am pregnant and removed my acrylic nails shortly after finding out, so I wanted a product to help me transition that wasn&#x27;t toxic.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>All of the Barielle products I have purchased so far really help.  </li>
      <li>But my nails are much improved when I use the protein, Natural Nail Camouflage, and oil.</li>
      <li>I have purchased this product for the woman in my office who have kicked their acrylic and gel nails to the curb, and they have had similar success.  </li>
      <li>I initially bought this due to the good reviews and the fact that it was rated reasonably low risk by the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s cosmetic safety index.  </li>
      <li>but you do have to be consistent and use it regularly.  </li>
      <li>I am currently on my second one and two nail that broke (one deeply in the skin bed) seem to be coming back at a more rapid pace than I remember.  </li>
      <li>that is, whether they actually are a protein or special fibers or whether they are simply a layer of nail polish or clear nail hardener.  </li>
      <li>I wore acrylics for 17 years (in a row) because my nails were to weak to grow on their own.  </li>
      <li>This has helped me rebuild my natural nails.</li>
      <li>old and brittle an it may be that nothing is going to help them.</li>
      <li>Over the years, I&#x27;ve found a few nail products that won&#x27;t dry my cuticles, so as to allow better health grow of my nails.</li>
      <li>I put a new coat on several times a week and my manicure lasts and my nails don&#x27;t break.  </li>
      <li>I finally have natural nails!  </li>
      <li>Dries clear and almost instantly.</li>
      <li>I have now also added the  clearly noticeable nail thickener and cuticle oil, all by the same company, to my nail care routine.  </li>
      <li>Most people talk about their nails being brittle, mine are thin and peal off.  </li>
      <li>My nails began showing increased growth with less breakage and splitting with my first bottle.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t ever plan to be without this product, it is better than any other nail product I have tried in the past.</li>
      <li>but it dries clear allowing to see the natural pink of the nail.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Even if I&#x27;m able to permanently stop my peeling issue, I will continue to use this as my base coat for as long as it is available.</li>

<li> They are not super long (yet)</li>
<li> Except for the oil, I haven&#x27;t figured out how the other products work--</li>
<li> I am not sure how this product does long term.  </li>
<li> I had shellac on for about four months, and my nails were weak and brittle after I finally took the shellac off.</li>
<li> but since I started these products daily (about 8 weeks ago) not a single nail has broken!!  </li>
<li> I tried another product that contain harsh chemicals, like formaldehyde.  </li>
<li> I would recommend this for anyone who has thin, hard to grow nails.</li>
<li> I wore acrylic nails for almost 20 years and just got tired of investing the time to go to the salon every two weeks to keep the maintenance up on them.  </li>
<li> I have been using this base coat for a little over a year</li>
<li> Not one nail has broken!  </li>
<li> I think I used some bad nail polish.  </li>
<li> I like that it can be used as a treatment as well as a base coat.</li>
<li> The horrible drilling ridges were gone.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have the weakest nails ever.  Most people talk about their nails being brittle, mine are thin and peal off.  I tried another product that contain harsh chemicals, like formaldehyde.  That didn&#x27;t work at all.  I switched to this, along with the nail strengthener cream and voila, for the first time IN MY LIFE I&#x27;m growing nails!!  It&#x27;s truly amazing.  I have now also added the  clearly noticeable nail thickener and cuticle oil, all by the same company, to my nail care routine.  It is amazing to me how well this stuff works.  I am wearing french manicures and the polish stays on for an entire week!  I cannot say enough good stuff about this product.  Will it work for everybody?  Probably not but it worked for me and I plan to continue using these products for a long time!  I wore acrylics for 17 years (in a row) because my nails were to weak to grow on their own.  I will never go back to acrylics again.  I finally have natural nails!  They are not super long (yet) but since I started these products daily (about 8 weeks ago) not a single nail has broken!!  That is amazing to me!  I say try it but give it a fair chance.  These products take time to work.  I waited this long to write a review because I wanted to really share a useful review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  1 month later and these products are still amazing!!  I have a perfect ten manicure! Not one nail has broken!  Two people have ask me if I have shellac on my nails.  They cannot believe real nails can look this good!  These products are TOTALLY worth it!!  I will continue to use them and enjoy my beautiful manicure!</li>
    <li> I have been searching for something that will keep my nails from splitting.  I guess it&#x27;s rare for a man to have this problem.  This product did not work for me, however, Healthy Hoof, believe it or not did.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this Barielle product since I&#x27;ve had success with them before - however this particular one was not what I&#x27;d hoped for.</li>
    <li> peeled off..forget it</li>
    <li> This stuff works just great but you do have to be consistent and use it regularly.  It&#x27;s a very nice product and does what it says.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many a product to deal with splitting and weak nails -- this one really works, and I&#x27;m delighted with it.</li>
    <li> I love this nail polish with protein. After two applications my nails are good for the week!</li>
    <li> My nails are old and brittle an it may be that nothing is going to help them.</li>
    <li> Was a type of polish finish prevents absorbing of building cream by beriella a much more effective product</li>
    <li> I have been using this base coat for a little over a year and it&#x27;s my favorite! It&#x27;s not goopy and it dries clear and quickly with a nice subtle shine. I like that it can be used as a treatment as well as a base coat. My nails are very sturdy on their own, but I experience  straining and flaking without a base coat. It&#x27;s a must have for me whenever I do a manicure at home!</li>
    <li> This is the only product I have found that helps to keep my nails from splitting and cracking. It works much better than nail polish.</li>
    <li> Received very quickly, in perfect condition.  Very good product.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I have used this before. It&#x27;s my second order of this product. It works for me. I would recommend this for anyone who has thin, hard to grow nails.</li>
    <li> Another great nail product that does not dry up the cuticles. Formaldehyde free! Dries clear and almost instantly. Its color is that of a nail ridge filler (nice thickness) but it dries clear allowing to see the natural pink of the nail.&lt;br /&gt;I have psoriasis in only 4 nails and I have to switch nail hardeners constantly. Over the years, I&#x27;ve found a few nail products that won&#x27;t dry my cuticles, so as to allow better health grow of my nails. However, I always apply oil to the cuticles but some nail polishes just suck moisture out my nails and cuticles almost instantly.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product. It seems good and protein is good for the nails.</li>
    <li> I had shellac on for about four months, and my nails were weak and brittle after I finally took the shellac off. This product has really helped rebuild my nails.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. It is the only thing that allowed me to free myself of years of acrylic nails. When the nails came off in the past, my real nails were far too thin and brittle. Not with this stuff. It is worth every dime.</li>
    <li> This has made my nails grow a little faster, and it has a nice shine to it.  I recommend trying it.</li>
    <li> Somehow my nails got very damaged, were splitting, breaking. I think I used some bad nail polish.  I was looking for something to protect them as they grow out.  I like this product and the price was good.  It evens out the nail making it look much better while I am trying to grow out the bad spots.    Update 1/14/15  My nails have grown out and look so much better.  They are no longer peeling or crumbling.  They are strong again. This nail polish made my nails look nice while they were growing out.  I will never buy another nail polish unless it is from a reputable store.</li>
    <li> All of the Barielle products I have purchased so far really help.  Except for the oil, I haven&#x27;t figured out how the other products work--that is, whether they actually are a protein or special fibers or whether they are simply a layer of nail polish or clear nail hardener.  It has to be removed after awhile, because it chips the way polish would.  But my nails are much improved when I use the protein, Natural Nail Camouflage, and oil.</li>
    <li> Great for getting my nails back into condition after having gel nails all summer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used OPI Nail Envy before and liked it; this seemed similar. No complaints, and it seemed to help my peeling nails, but don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;d call it a miracle worker.</li>
    <li> This is a good product but doesn&#x27;t dry as fast as others I&#x27;ve tried.  Nevertheless, it does the job.</li>
    <li> Works very well. I can see improvement after two weeks. My nails are harder and growing longer and staying that way.</li>
    <li> I was first introduced to this treatment in a manicure gift I received about a year ago. At that time, I had been experiencing peeling nails and could not seem to get the peeling to stop no matter what I tried. Within a week of starting this treatment, I noticed there was no new peeling. Once the already peeling portions of my nails grew out, I remained peel-free until the bottle ran out. It wasn&#x27;t until the peeling returned a few weeks after using a different base coat that I realized how wonderful and helpful the Barielle had been for me all along!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to offering superior nail rebuilding, my polish would stay on, chip free, for DAYS (something I was never able to achieve with any other &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; base coat).  Even if I&#x27;m able to permanently stop my peeling issue, I will continue to use this as my base coat for as long as it is available.</li>
    <li> See my review on the Barielle Nail Building Cream.  Combined with this product, I&#x27;ve been able to grow my own nails for maybe the first time in my life, and I&#x27;ve given up the bi-weekly trips to get acrylic.  I&#x27;m VERY happy with it - I put a new coat on several times a week and my manicure lasts and my nails don&#x27;t break.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I used this when I was regrowing my nails from having acrylics. I couldn&#x27;t believe how smooth my nails looked. The horrible drilling ridges were gone. I was very pleased, and my nails were VERY strong.</li>
    <li> I had acrylics for years.  This has helped me rebuild my natural nails.I</li>
    <li> I am not sure how this product does long term.  I do not think I will even be able to use it as directed for a week.  I initially bought this due to the good reviews and the fact that it was rated reasonably low risk by the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s cosmetic safety index.  I am pregnant and removed my acrylic nails shortly after finding out, so I wanted a product to help me transition that wasn&#x27;t toxic.  I put this polish on this morning and I can still smell it on my hands almost 8 hours later.  Granted, I do have a pretty strong sense of smell, but still, OPI or Sally Hansen never lasted this long or smelled this chemical-perfumey.  If you don&#x27;t mind the scent, this might be a good product.  I wish I had bought something else.</li>
    <li> My nails began showing increased growth with less breakage and splitting with my first bottle. I am currently on my second one and two nail that broke (one deeply in the skin bed) seem to be coming back at a more rapid pace than I remember.  I stopped using this company&#x27;s products years ago and I can&#x27;t remember why.  Now I&#x27;m hooked again.</li>
    <li> I had purchased Barielle nail rebuilding protein prior to this purchase and used it weekly with wonderful results.  I have never had such strong beautiful nail until I started using Barielle nail rebuilding protein.  I highly recommend this product for any one with thin brittle nails, you won&#x27;t believe the improvement in your nails within just a short time.  I don&#x27;t ever plan to be without this product, it is better than any other nail product I have tried in the past.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product!  I wore acrylic nails for almost 20 years and just got tired of investing the time to go to the salon every two weeks to keep the maintenance up on them.  When I decided to take them off, I tried many products to bring my nails back from their short, peeling, brittle state.  I discovered this product and in about 10 months my nails were repaired back to a healthy appearance.  I have purchased this product for the woman in my office who have kicked their acrylic and gel nails to the curb, and they have had similar success.  Will continue to purchase this product!</li>
    <li> I began using Barielle to help with peeling and splitting. It&#x27;s been 5 weeks now and I will NOT be using it anymore. While I did experience more nail growth than usual and loved the shine of the initial application, my nails continued to peel and split.</li>
