      <li>I love this powered.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t get banana.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
      <li>This is more like a setting powder.</li>
      <li>With trends towards more natural looks, this stuff is great for highlights and contouring.</li>
      <li>but  not as good  as the Mac version, Not  so much for translucent as I wanted it to be  made  </li>
      <li>I loved the banana luxury powder so much I wanted to try the camel .</li>
      <li>I also used the &#x27;dark coca&#x27; on my face and those together work perfect.</li>
      <li>The texture is fine and silky</li>
      <li>This keeps my makeup in place and shine free for about 6 hours before I need a touch-up.</li>
      <li>it covers up my flaws really well &amp; has a nice tan look.</li>
      <li>but I read that it can be a bit light for darker complexions</li>
      <li>To my unknowing I noticed in picture&#x27;s the highlight was appearing to look ashy and to light for my skin complexion.</li>
      <li>I am med to light brown skinned with oily skin.</li>
      <li>I can not apply makeup w/o this in camel: felt like banana would be too light for me</li>
      <li>My under eye looks so smooth, almost as if I had a blurred filter on.</li>
      <li>far it is good if u mix it with banana powder because you dont want it to be too light if you are a caramel complexion</li>
      <li>Bottles small but Fine luxurious powder perfect with my nw45 foundation</li>
      <li>Worth the price!</li>
      <li>I was skeptical but what a great price and great quality..</li>
      <li>Make sure to use a foundation that covers acne scars if you have them because it has a very translucent finish.</li>
      <li>I have sort of a caramel complexion with yellow undertones, and this is a good color for my skin.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m NW45 in MAC products or 7.5 in their Mineralize Foundation and Beautiful Bronze or Nutmeg in Black Opal.</li>
      <li>I love this product!I have been learning and practicing new makeup techniques.</li>
      <li>Very nice for dark skinned girls,</li>
      <li>it makes my makeup look very even!!</li>
      <li>Arrived when expected, product is good not very impressed maybe because I&#x27;m not applying correctly but just didn&#x27;t see the flawless look people talk about.</li>
      <li>I purchased this product and tried it and lived the smooth finish but noticed it now blended too much with my skin and did not allow for a highlight.</li>
      <li>I am def going to find my shade for my overall face because this stuff is amazing.</li>
      <li>Even though the Banana powder is amazing, at times I felt it might be a tad bit too yellow for undertones.</li>
      <li>I purchase Ben Nye Banana as a highlight for my face earlier last year and loved the smooth finished!</li>
      <li>Cant live without it!!!</li>
      <li>Additionally, I have VERY, VERY, VERY oily skin.</li>
      <li>love this product I am definitely a fan of Ben Nye.</li>
      <li>Shipping is so fast!</li>
      <li>Our skin has more of the yellow under tones.</li>
      <li>The first day I wore it to work, a coworker told me my face looked &amp;#34;flawless&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>can&#x27;t wait to buy more most likely stock up with the larger size bottle</li>
      <li>So I got caramel and it&#x27;s almost exactly what I need.  </li>
      <li>Love this product blends in very well with my Carmel complexion and last all day</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this and its worth the price and the hype.</li>
      <li>so you can&#x27;t really see it and</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product!.</li>
      <li>When I do my make up and put this on last and lightly brush it all over my face.</li>
      <li>it from  seeing  what you really look like  with this powder  </li>
      <li>I thought it only came in banana and was for light complexions</li>
      <li>Good powder for ladies of color who are victim to the same old ashy looking powders.</li>
      <li>It arrived quickly and I enjoy using this for everyday wear.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m highly considering order the Banana.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> AMAZING. NICE MATTE FINISH. WARM TONE. LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> I am about a MAC NC45.  This fits well on my complexion as a setting and highlighting powder. Great price too!!</li>
    <li> i like it s far it is good if u mix it with banana powder because you dont want it to be too light if you are a caramel complexion</li>
    <li> Love this product blends in very well with my Carmel complexion and last all day</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t get banana. That color is not for dark skin. This is more like a setting powder. I had powder that matched my skin tone before but it seemed like I had to touch it up every couple hours due to oily skin. When I do my make up and put this on last and lightly brush it all over my face. Its translucent so you can&#x27;t really see it and my make up stays on all day and I don&#x27;t have to touch it up. I highly recommend this and its worth the price and the hype.</li>
    <li> I love this product!I have been learning and practicing new makeup techniques.As, with changes in my hair, I need new looks in beauty and makeup. With trends towards more natural looks, this stuff is great for highlights and contouring.It has taken me from the heavy red rouge applications that i have used for sooooo long! Although,it was a little difficult to take off the protective plastic cover. I highly recommend this product!.</li>
    <li> This powder gives the perfect natural looking highlight for my skin. I&#x27;m NW45 in MAC products or 7.5 in their Mineralize Foundation and Beautiful Bronze or Nutmeg in Black Opal. Love this product!</li>
    <li> I loved the banana luxury powder so much I wanted to try the camel . I&#x27;m a NC50 in Mac and Caramel in  revlon color stay. Even though the Banana powder is amazing, at times I felt it might be a tad bit too yellow for undertones. So I got caramel and it&#x27;s almost exactly what I need.  It get a thumbs up!</li>
    <li> Best powder I have ever used!!!  Flawless.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. It arrived quickly and I enjoy using this for everyday wear. It is a little messy but its powder so you will get used to it!</li>
    <li> This powder is awesome....it sets my concealer just right and gives me that perfect highlight and definition I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
    <li> I love this powered.  it covers up my flaws really well &amp; has a nice tan look.</li>
    <li> Love it you don&#x27;t have to get the KimK color if you a bit darker and you can use it as a all over face powder as well</li>
    <li> Great for medium skin tones!</li>
    <li> I used this under my eyes and they help my eyes &#x27;pop&#x27;.  I am a dark skinned &#x27;sista&#x27; and it works for me.  I also used the &#x27;dark coca&#x27; on my face and those together work perfect.</li>
    <li> I got it sooner than expected and I love it!! I will definitely purchase this product again. Awesome ship time as well.</li>
    <li> Arrived when expected, product is good not very impressed maybe because I&#x27;m not applying correctly but just didn&#x27;t see the flawless look people talk about.</li>
    <li> I am med to light brown skinned with oily skin. This product worked lovely on my  face. I ordered the banana, Carmel, and topaz powder. My daughter is lighter than me and it works great for her too. Our skin has more of the yellow under tones.</li>
    <li> Shipping is so fast! Just got here today 😏 can&#x27;t wait to try it tomorrow! 👌😍</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay I guess not sure this was what I was looking for</li>
    <li> Great product for darker skin girls. I just love!!!</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way! I&#x27;ll be using this small bottle forever! Good powder for ladies of color who are victim to the same old ashy looking powders.</li>
    <li> I have sort of a caramel complexion with yellow undertones, and this is a good color for my skin. I think it&#x27;s good for setting your foundation or concealer. It has a matte finish and it enhances my skin tone. I also like the finish of the powder.</li>
    <li> Ben Nye is alright I got this  product  based on on all the hype!  It was getting on YouTube  it&#x27;s  good but  not as good  as the Mac version, Not  so much for translucent as I wanted it to be  made  me turn  quite yellowish in the face 3 words: ( No Flash  pictures)  you will  loose  it from  seeing  what you really look like  with this powder  if your not careful  how to apply it out overall it&#x27;s  good</li>
    <li> The best powder out there.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my skin. Will be purchasing again</li>
    <li> I previously used white translucent powder, which was good but in lighting was bad especially in pictures (flash) this stuff here!! Is AMAZE-BALLS it truly is heaven sent. I can not apply makeup w/o this in camel: felt like banana would be too light for me im brown 7.5 in macs matchmaster . I brought a lil plastic jar &amp; poured some of this in it to go when im out for touchups. Its the cherry on top :)</li>
    <li> This product is awesome. The first day I wore it to work, a coworker told me my face looked &amp;#34;flawless&amp;#34;. I usually wear MAC NW 40/45 pending on the season, and this does not cake up or make you look ashy. I&#x27;m highly considering order the Banana. Additionally, I have VERY, VERY, VERY oily skin. This keeps my makeup in place and shine free for about 6 hours before I need a touch-up. The one drawback is that it can get messy; I&#x27;ll ususally pour the powder into the cap and use my concealer brush to reduce waste. Besides that, a truly great product.</li>
    <li> I purchase Ben Nye Banana as a highlight for my face earlier last year and loved the smooth finished! To my unknowing I noticed in picture&#x27;s the highlight was appearing to look ashy and to light for my skin complexion. I sought out other young ladies my skin color on YouTube and seen allot of girls caramel in color used Camel Ben Nye opposed to banana. I purchased this product and tried it and lived the smooth finish but noticed it now blended too much with my skin and did not allow for a highlight. I came up with the ideal to mix the two banana and camel and walah!!! The perfect highlight!!</li>
    <li> I have been using Mac make-up for as long as I can remember. I saw this brand on YouTube and decided to experiment with it; I was blown away I ended up buying another. This is freakin awesome it goes on smoothly and the finish is flawless. The texture is fine and silky it goes on well with Mac liquid foundation,. Further it is perfect for highlighting even better all over. Do not hesitate to purchase one it is a must have for all makeup artist from beginners to season ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product I am definitely a fan of Ben Nye.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing.  I&#x27;ve been wanting  to try it for a while.  I&#x27;m glad I did.  Leaves your skin looking flawless.</li>
    <li> Beautiful finish! Will order again!!</li>
    <li> Yes! Very nice for dark skinned girls, and it&#x27;s also good for contouring on a lighter toned girl! Very pleased with this product. I&#x27;d like to purchase the banana one as well.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical but what a great price and great quality.. No wonder kim ks makeup always looks so flawless, this powder thtat she introduced to the makeup world is the best! I was skeptical bc I thought it only came in banana and was for light complexions but once I discovered there was a camel color for brown skin, I immediately placed my order! Been using it for two weeks, and I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> Cant live without it!!! Absolutely love this powder! I use it all over my face after my regular powder and I dust the majority off it makes my makeup look very even!!</li>
    <li> The color is awesome!! I wanted to try something other than banana.  I can no wait to see how this looks on my skintone.</li>
    <li> love it, i use it to set my concealer and foundation</li>
    <li> Not what I expected . My face looks orange.</li>
    <li> Does not stay on all day,</li>
    <li> Oh baby. It is all the rave and rightfully so. I am a MAC NW47 and I use this to set my under eye concealer and oh boy. My under eye looks so smooth, almost as if I had a blurred filter on. Closes the pores. Has a nice matte finish but not too matte. It&#x27;s amazing!!!! I am def going to find my shade for my overall face because this stuff is amazing. Worth the price!</li>
    <li> This powder is AMAZING!!! My complexion is NC50 in MAC or New Guinea in NARS and this is the perfect shade for me.  I wanted to try the Banana powder but I read that it can be a bit light for darker complexions and I didnt want it to photographer white under the eyes.  This provides the perfect highlight and lasts all day.  I&#x27;m so happy I found this. It&#x27;s a makeup dream!!</li>
    <li> Bottles small but Fine luxurious powder perfect with my nw45 foundation can&#x27;t wait to buy more most likely stock up with the larger size bottle</li>
    <li> Great powder. Make sure to use a foundation that covers acne scars if you have them because it has a very translucent finish.</li>
