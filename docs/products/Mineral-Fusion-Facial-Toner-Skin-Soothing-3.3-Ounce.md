      <li>I gotta say that I bought this one because of the nice price.</li>
      <li>This is a nice refreshment for the skin.</li>
      <li>Mineral Fusion toner is very soothing, no harsh chemicals, has magnesium and copper--which are great for your skin, along with a wonderful minerally spa scent.  </li>
      <li>I have bought it three times now and haven&#x27;t found anything I like better.</li>
      <li>Product has an appealing odor.</li>
      <li>I would like is better in a squirt bottle rather than a spray.</li>
      <li>I love this toner, I like that</li>
      <li>It is soothing and has a healthy effect on my complexion.</li>
      <li>I love the light smell and it is a nice calming toner.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>also love their Mineral Fusion illumunating Beauty Balm.  </li>
      <li>My grand daughter loves this product.  </li>
      <li>(I think even better than Sothys).  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m still searching for the perfect toner, but I will definitely repurchase if nothing else works.</li>
      <li>Happened upon this several months ago, on a very good sale, at Sprouts.  </li>
      <li>The ingredients are fantastic for aging skin (that&#x27;s the part</li>
      <li>I started doing my homework to find an alternative, paraben free product.  </li>
      <li>great for the toning how every my local store sells this cheaper then what it is on here.</li>
      <li>great product, except that in a year this same product went from a 6oz.</li>
      <li>It feels comfortable and helps purify the skin after wash, so it&#x27;s smoother before applying moisturizer and makeup.</li>
      <li>Like the ingredients and like the fact it is in the glass container because it would safely store the natural toner :)</li>
      <li>It feels pretty cool and refreshing.</li>
      <li>Love it and highly recommend this line of products!  </li>
      <li>this is such an exceptional toner.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m interested in!).  </li>
      <li>This is a nice toner I work outside in Fl.</li>
      <li>Nice basic toner.</li>
      <li>Sothys is a great French skincare line, but when I recently realized their toner has parabens</li>
      <li>It helps the texture of my skin and offers such good stuff for my skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>First found this from local store and I&#x27;m doing S&amp;S as Amazon has better price.  </li>
      <li>A few spritzes and you&#x27;re good.</li>
      <li>Also, the formula must be new because the fresh herbal smell is gone.</li>
      <li>I do struggle with acne, but I couldn&#x27;t tell if it helped, though it certainly didn&#x27;t cause anymore.</li>
      <li>It is so much easier to order and get on line than finding a store that carries it.</li>
      <li>who wants glass bottles in the bathroom?  </li>
      <li>For some reason, it goes fast, though.</li>
      <li>This does not agree with my skin, I ended up with very irritated skin and a bit of a rash.</li>
      <li>It also helps my skin color be more uniform; less reddish areas on my face.</li>
      <li>He is an older manly man..</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been on a quest to find the right toner for my super sensitive skin while at the same time, totally natural.</li>
      <li>I spent more on this than I usually would for a toner, but I love it.</li>
      <li>However, sometimes, if I&#x27;m more sensitive that day, or if for some reason I use a bit too much, it does burn a little bit.</li>
      <li>Is this normal?</li>
      <li>Will update in a few more weeks.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more than just a watered down BB cream because it actually is more like a foundation and on my 50-something skin I seriously can use just this Beauty Balm with no foundation and it looks fresh and natural, yet does provide slight coverage and evens out skin tone.  </li>
      <li>I will also use the Mineral Fusion Natural Brands Intense Hydration Facial Cream.</li>
      <li>I have acne prone skin as an adult woman and this seems to help keep my skin clearer.</li>
      <li>So far, I&#x27;m stick to this toner for daily use.</li>
      <li>My only warning is to stay far away from the eye area because it will sting.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I quite like the ingredients of this facial toner. It is soothing and has a healthy effect on my complexion. I don&#x27;t like to spray this on toner pads because the product gets wasted, so I use a separate toner to use in that way. This is a nice refreshment for the skin. A few spritzes and you&#x27;re good. Plain and simple.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been on a quest to find the right toner for my super sensitive skin while at the same time, totally natural. I gotta say that I bought this one because of the nice price. I like it overall. I like the smell and it does not leave residue on my skin. However, sometimes, if I&#x27;m more sensitive that day, or if for some reason I use a bit too much, it does burn a little bit. After a few minutes it will go away and i never got a rash or anything. That&#x27;s the reason for 4 start instead of 5. When I find the toner that does not burn my skin, I will give it 5 starts!</li>
    <li> I just got this a couple days ago, and it seems to have helped my acne on my cheeks. I spray it on a cotton ball then rub it on my face. It smells like mosquito repellant though? Is this normal? I  know Avon spray makes the best repellant, maybe it has the same key ingredients. Will update in a few more weeks.</li>
    <li> My grand daughter loves this product.  It is so much easier to order and get on line than finding a store that carries it.</li>
    <li> It feels comfortable and helps purify the skin after wash, so it&#x27;s smoother before applying moisturizer and makeup. Nice basic toner.</li>
    <li> I spent more on this than I usually would for a toner, but I love it. I would like is better in a squirt bottle rather than a spray.</li>
    <li> I love this toner, I like that I can spray it on. I use it just after the shower, spray on, then I use my facial oil (that I make myself).&lt;br /&gt;then I will also use the Mineral Fusion Natural Brands Intense Hydration Facial Cream. I love the light smell and it is a nice calming toner. never has broken me out, and it calms my mild rosacea.</li>
    <li> This is a nice toner I work outside in Fl. I keep one in my truck to spray during the day, I do not wear makeup - works well with the moisturizer I wear and the sunscreen, does not run or block pores.&lt;br /&gt;I have not worn sunscreen and used this i am fair skin- I did not burn..&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend wearing sunscreen but those days proved to me the minerals protected my face.I have not tried there other lines of products. This is a great product for myself. I have gotten my coworker { male } to use and he loves it. He is an older manly man..</li>
    <li> This does not agree with my skin, I ended up with very irritated skin and a bit of a rash. It started to sting whenever I sprayed it on, not a good sign. I swtiched to Andalou and that works wonderfully for me. I gave the toner, cleanser, and facial scrub to a friend and she loves it.</li>
    <li> Love this toner!  I use Witch Hazel too at times (Dickinson&#x27;s Pore Refiner).  Like both, but prefer the Mineral Fusion brand.  The ingredients are fantastic for aging skin (that&#x27;s the part I&#x27;m interested in!).  The fragrance is a treat - like have a little &amp;#34;spa experience/treatment&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can FEEL it after I spray it on.  It tingles a bit which tells me the ingredients make a difference.  (I&#x27;ll try swiping it on with a cotton disk too, on moist skin).  It helps the texture of my skin and offers such good stuff for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spray it on face &amp; neck after I apply my DIY Vit C Serum.  Skin is lookin&#x27; quite good!  I&#x27;ve been using this Mineral Fusion toner for about 3 months now.  Love it and highly recommend this line of products!  I found mine at my local Sprouts store on sale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love their Mineral Fusion illumunating Beauty Balm.  It&#x27;s more than just a watered down BB cream because it actually is more like a foundation and on my 50-something skin I seriously can use just this Beauty Balm with no foundation and it looks fresh and natural, yet does provide slight coverage and evens out skin tone.  It&#x27;s beautiful!  There&#x27;s a Satin version too - I&#x27;ll try that one next.  Happened upon this several months ago, on a very good sale, at Sprouts.  Amazon pricing is very good too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Top-notch company!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used an entire bottle to give it a chance. I&#x27;ve only used one other toner, so this is based off how my skin reacted. It feels pretty cool and refreshing. It makes your face feel like it was spritzed with cold water. It made my skin look and feel fresher. I do struggle with acne, but I couldn&#x27;t tell if it helped, though it certainly didn&#x27;t cause anymore. My only warning is to stay far away from the eye area because it will sting. I&#x27;m still searching for the perfect toner, but I will definitely repurchase if nothing else works.</li>
    <li> The new packaging is silly.  who wants glass bottles in the bathroom?  Not to mention it is half the volume but the same price as the previous package.  Also, the formula must be new because the fresh herbal smell is gone.</li>
    <li> great product, except that in a year this same product went from a 6oz. bottle for $11 to a 3.3oz.  no more for me!</li>
    <li> great for the toning how every my local store sells this cheaper then what it is on here. not to mention it severly drys out your skin</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It make my skin feel very nice. I have acne prone skin as an adult woman and this seems to help keep my skin clearer. It also helps my skin color be more uniform; less reddish areas on my face.</li>
    <li> First found this from local store and I&#x27;m doing S&amp;S as Amazon has better price.  Like the ingredients and like the fact it is in the glass container because it would safely store the natural toner :) So far, I&#x27;m stick to this toner for daily use.</li>
    <li> I picked this toner for the beneficial natural ingredients for my sensitive skin and have not been disappointed.  It is quite soothing after washing my face or doing a microdermabrasion..  I would purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I have never written a beauty or skincare product review, but felt I had to let others know this is such an exceptional toner.  I get facials monthly and have used luxury skin care products for years.  I am known for having very beautiful, youthful looking skin (I&#x27;m in my forties and have skin&lt;br /&gt;Iike a 30 something).  My Esthetician started me on Sothys Soothing toner about ten years ago. Sothys is a great French skincare line, but when I recently realized their toner has parabens I started doing my homework to find an alternative, paraben free product.  Mineral Fusion toner is very soothing, no harsh chemicals, has magnesium and copper--which are great for your skin, along with a wonderful minerally spa scent.  This toner works extremely well (I think even better than Sothys).  It&#x27;s also less than half the price.  Can&#x27;t beat that!  I&#x27;ll definitely be trying their other products!</li>
    <li> Product has an appealing odor. I have bought it three times now and haven&#x27;t found anything I like better. For some reason, it goes fast, though. It used to make my lips tingle, but that effect has worn off.</li>
</ol>
