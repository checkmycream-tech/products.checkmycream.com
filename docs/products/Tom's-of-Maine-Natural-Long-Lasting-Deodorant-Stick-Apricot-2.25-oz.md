      <li>But this stuff works amazing!  </li>
      <li>I loved their toothpaste also, but I will no longer purchase from Tom&#x27;s of</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m good with that)and</li>

      <li>It is best used on clean skin, though.</li>
      <li>I got this in beautiful earth and it smells lovely.</li>
      <li>My favorite thing about it is how great my skin feels there now.</li>
      <li>I used the Apricot scent, and it smells pretty wonderful-</li>
      <li>but just wait, there&#x27;s more!</li>
      <li>I love this deodorant!  </li>
      <li>This is my favorite!  </li>
      <li>Toms, you need to make a better formula so you won&#x27;t have that problem!    </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s amazing how involve they are and helping with the environment.</li>
      <li>that is aluminum free and it smells great.</li>
      <li>It works for me also, and am happy I can now wear aluminum free deoderant.</li>
      <li>Even after pregnancy it&#x27;s been effective for odor.  </li>
      <li>It smells nice, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
      <li>I love the smell of this, it goes on nicely and keeps me smelling good all day.</li>
      <li>the $18 brand smelled and felt nice but quit working after 2-3</li>
      <li>I thought it smelled really nice.  </li>
      <li>Best product I have found so far</li>
      <li>my never ending quest to find the best natural deoderant I splurged on an $18 luxury brand (LAVANILA)&lt;br</li>
      <li>And the scent is light but good.  </li>
      <li>I apply it right after getting out of the shower (i.e. after I&#x27;ve shaved), and I haven&#x27;t experienced any burning or redness.</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t require a strong deodorant and want something light, fresh without a flowery smell this apricot deodorant is perfect.</li>
      <li>For many people out there [...] it causes the skin to peel off your armpits and a burning sensation.</li>
      <li>love the smell and how it doesnt make us smell:)</li>
      <li>I also love the apricot scent of this product.</li>
      <li>Who could ask for more?</li>
      <li>I have read much better reviews for this product.</li>
      <li>If I had to apply it more than once a day (say after an afternoon shower)</li>
      <li>By midday my BO has made a return, and the lovely scent that once graced my pits is gone.</li>
      <li>I just look at the company&#x27;s website to find out what&#x27;s the latest product.</li>
      <li>just make sure theres no bacteria before applying toms</li>
      <li>I switched to Arm &amp; Hammer Naturals and have found it to be a MUCH better alternative</li>
      <li>Since it&#x27;s not sticky, you can put on more than one</li>
      <li>Off to finding something better...</li>
      <li>Tom&#x27;s apricot still comes out on top</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I love the Calendula and Lavender</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t know how well this stuff would work for someone who sweats more than myself.</li>
      <li>That one seems to have better reviews.  </li>
      <li>I use many Tom&#x27;s of Maine products, and am generally satisfied.  </li>
      <li>I started using this deodorant about a week ago after picking some up on a whim, and I love it.</li>
      <li>first I would have recommended it, but I am warning you DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!</li>
      <li>while it is not as good as a deodorant that contains aluminum salts, it is good enough for most days.  </li>
      <li>I have read that it doesn&#x27;t work for some people, but since becoming vegan my sweat isn&#x27;t as offensive, so that probably helps :)</li>
      <li>Not weird in a good way either.</li>
      <li>I really wanted it to be great, and I guess it&#x27;s fine if you don&#x27;t mind reapplying throughout the day, but that&#x27;s not for me.</li>
      <li>is unique and some people are hurt by the zinc ricinoleate.\\&quot; Which is just unacceptable!</li>
      <li>Despite the lovely smell of the Apricot and the aluminum free formula, I can not use this deodorant any longer.  </li>
      <li>I decided that my son and I would originally share as I did not want to spend more money and not like it.   </li>
      <li>Easy to wash off in the shower.</li>
      <li>I had doubts, since I have strong odor for a girl sometimes.  </li>
      <li>overwhelmingly sticky sweet smell.</li>
      <li>I would start out with the unscented kind first.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m fine.  </li>
      <li>I would love to drop the stuff, but I have yet to find an adequate replacement.</li>
      <li>He told me to throw it out because even aluminum filled deodorants don&#x27;t do that to your skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Tom&#x27;s free, and I&#x27;m still in pain.</li>
      <li>Trying to find an aluminum free deodorant?  </li>
      <li>It smells FANTASTIC.</li>
      <li>, they are no longer cruelty free as they sold out to another company that tests on animals.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Fortunately, reapplying masks the unnatural stench.  </li>
      <li>Seeing as how it was natural and smelled good</li>
      <li>I must say that I&#x27;m impressed with my new purchase; I worked in 90 degree weather, same work schedule</li>
      <li>I started using the 12 hour Lavender scent and while I loved the scent, the deodorant factor barely lasted 4 hours.  </li>
      <li>and I work outdoors pretty much most of the year.  </li>
      <li>Most had 18% or higher.)</li>
      <li>I started off with the original scent which did not work at all.  </li>
      <li>I was excited to find it and put it in my shopping cart.</li>
      <li>I bought this deodorant and was really excited to try it.</li>
      <li>As someone has become more health conscious, I wanted to started using skincare products that were better for me and for the environment.  </li>
      <li>That&#x27;s right!</li>
      <li>My arm pits are bright red</li>
      <li>It smells nice and goes on clear.</li>
      <li>I honestly thought I would have to goto a natural food store, but there sat toms apricot on the shelf.</li>
      <li>I picked the apricot smell because it was pleasant and not too strong and the other choice was lavender, which can sometimes smell too \\&quot;organic-y\\&quot; for my tastes.</li>
      <li>I had mild odor.</li>
      <li>I read online that Aluminum can actually make people sweat more because it clogs your pores and your body reacts by sweating even more to try and remove the aluminum.</li>
      <li>I started using the lavender one when I was pregnant and never had a problem with odor</li>
      <li>am one of the lucky victims that got to experience the dark side of this wonderful, natural deodorant.</li>
      <li>Also, the first time you notice irritation, discontinue use!  </li>
      <li>so I started using Adidas aluminum free deodorant which worked really well.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t care for the apricot scent even though it does kind of last.  </li>
      <li>or so for a more natural alternative.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m surprised at the reviews because I love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>It feels soft, smooth, and clean.</li>

    <li> So it kinda defies the purpose. I bought the apricot. It smells nice and goes on clear. I showered, washed my pits with soap then swiped them with alcohol astringent just make sure theres no bacteria before applying toms and then went to work. I work in an office so no real sweating going on. It lasted until noon so about five hrs. it didn&#x27;t smell so bad but not as fresh as i would&#x27; ve liked. I reapplied it after swiping again with astringent. I went for a walk after work. Sweated very little and the smell was horrible. I&#x27;m thinking I&#x27;ll put it away until winter and the wear it to the office.</li>
    <li> Always great! Set n Save is great! Thanks for offering!</li>
    <li> I have been using Tom of Maine&#x27;s deodorant with Apricot scent. I had used several deodorants in the market and i really love this one because it does not include aluminum- NO ALUMINUM!!!  Aluminum can darkens your armpit which makes it really unattractive.  The apricot scent is not overpowering.  I didn&#x27;t even know i was using an apricot scent in the beginning because i could not smell it at all. I applied it once a day and that covers my 24 hour of odor control.   As a nurse in ICU, i really needed something to control my underarm sweat and odor.    I therefore, highly recommend this product.  I just look at the company&#x27;s website to find out what&#x27;s the latest product. It&#x27;s amazing how involve they are and helping with the environment.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to switch all of my personal care products to organic products, so I like that this is a widely available organic deoderant.  (It&#x27;s sold in my local grocery store and in Target.)  I also like the apricot scent.  Unfortunately, it just doesn&#x27;t work for me.  I&#x27;ve never been a really big sweater or had to worry about whether I stink, but with this I am constantly reapplying and worried that I smell.  I don&#x27;t care for the sticky feeling when I first put it on, but it dries so I can get over that.  It just doesn&#x27;t last though.  It says 12 hours but I find myself starting to smell sweat much sooner than this.  I really wanted it to be great, and I guess it&#x27;s fine if you don&#x27;t mind reapplying throughout the day, but that&#x27;s not for me.</li>
    <li> I have developed a painful, red rash and burning from only using this product for 2 days. I immediately stopped using this product but I am still experiencing burning and pain and it&#x27;s been over a week. I have researched this on the internet and have found many similar claims. I  contacted the company and they are requesting I send the product (and providing a postage paid envelope) to them for testing. They are also providing a refund or replacement product in exchange. If you have even mildly sensitive skin I would definitely not recommend using this product.</li>
    <li> I would not recommend the Tom&#x27;s of Maine long-lasting natural deodorant, especially for those with sensitive skin. I do not have sensitive skin by any means, but this deodorant caused my armpits to burn for an hour after application. I tried it every day for about a week before giving up. I was hoping that maybe my skin would adapt to it or something, but it didn&#x27;t happen. It gave great protection and I smelled fresh all day and night, but I couldn&#x27;t get past the burning. Also, Tom&#x27;s of Maine is a little more expensive than regular deodorants at about $6 per stick. One other thing I didn&#x27;t like too much about it is that it went on more like a gel so it took a while for it to dry after applying. I did like that they have a wider variety of scents to choose from.</li>
    <li> I have not had more of the worse side effects people have voiced in their reviews- the burning sensation for example- but I was shocked when a few weeks after my regular use of the deodorant, I saw the skin on my armpits peel! I didn&#x27;t shave there much during the winter, but it became really obvious once I shaved my armpits and applying the deodorant regularly that the skin was peeling. I have a hunch that the men who use this product may not have this as an issue as much as women do (at least, those who shave their armpits), since men probably have more hair blocking direct contact with the deodorant onto their skin. I find the skin peeling issue somewhat ironic because the media has recently talked about how advertising companies are trying to make women feel bad about how their armpits look. Toms, you need to make a better formula so you won&#x27;t have that problem!    I used the Apricot scent, and it smells pretty wonderful- this is going to sound odd, but it&#x27;s like my armpits smelled like jam! Ha! I have to remind myself to wear/reapply this deodorant because otherwise, I REALLY reek. This might be due to my body finally rid of the perspiration blockers from my previous antiperspirant. I just had no idea I could smell this good AND this bad.    All in all, I didn&#x27;t have as bad problems as other reviewers, but I can&#x27;t exactly rave about it either. This is my first foray into non-aluminum products, so I may edit my review as I test other products out. 3/5 stars- not too bad/not that great.</li>
    <li> After having used this product for a few weeks I felt confident that I would not be one of those who would have an allergic reaction to it. Seeing as how it was natural and smelled good I wanted to believe in it. I always go for the natural products before anything else... But boy was I wrong to pick this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The deodorant initially worked fine, but then about 3 weeks into wearing it I noticed that my skin was very dry under my arms, and places were peeling like I had just gotten over a minor sunburn. No biggie. Then came the burning. It had burned before but only when I put it on right after a shower( and being a female who shaves her underarms I thought that might have been why it burned).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got up one morning after I had washed the deodorant off the night before and there was a large strip of skin rubbed completely raw on the side of my underarm toward my back. This stuff caused an allergic reaction on places that I didn&#x27;t even put the deodorant on! Then my underarms began to peel worse and before it was all over I was searching every super-store for some sort of relief. Finally settled on Old Spice After Hours Deodorant( without an anti-perspirant) to use instead. I didn&#x27;t think it was going to cause a reaction 3 weeks into wearing it but I was obviously mistaken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I would have recommended it, but I am warning you DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!</li>
    <li> I have dry skin, so the typical Aluminum Zirconium antiperspirants are way too potent for me; forget that I don&#x27;t sweat much, but those deodorants leave my underarms looking embarrassingly dark.  Tom&#x27;s deodorant is really gentle: I didn&#x27;t experience any rashes and it seems to be allowing the dark-pit issue to heal (not actually helping it heal).  However, it smells odd after a few hours (active 4 hours vs an inactive 10).  With other deodorants I don&#x27;t need to reapply, but with this, I must; not because I have sweated, but because it makes me smell (an atypical smell unlike  B.O.)  Fortunately, reapplying masks the unnatural stench.  Well, I rather carry deodorant with me than have dark pits, which is why I reluctantly gave it 4 stars -_-     It works for my needs.    If you tend to sweat a lot, I would not suggest this product to you.</li>
    <li> I wish I had listened to the reviews! If I had done my research, I would not have spent my money on this. I don&#x27;t understand why it has some good reviews when it clearly stinks more than your armpits will within the hour you apply it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now back to looking for a natural, cruelty &amp; aluminum-free deodorant!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes you STICKY as hell!&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t stand to apply it! I have to mentally prepare myself to put it on because it&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ve had for the past two weeks. I kept trying to see if it would work for me if I shaved and waited to apply it or if I showered before applying it, but it still BURNS, STICKS, and DRIES my underarms to the point where the skin starts peeling off!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it claims to give you 24 hour protection but it does not even last an hour! I literally sit at home watching tv or sleeping and my armpits smell so awful even if i reapply and I don&#x27;t even sweat!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a woman but my fiancé also tried it and it made his armpits super red and irritated. It hurts just to put your arms down! He told me to throw it out because even aluminum filled deodorants don&#x27;t do that to your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought mine at CVS because I wanted something ecofriendly but all I got was a pricey deodorant that consistently disappoints me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am done trying to make it work and I&#x27;m throwing it out completely. What a shame! I loved their toothpaste also, but I will no longer purchase from Tom&#x27;s of Maine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, they are no longer cruelty free as they sold out to another company that tests on animals.&lt;br /&gt;That made an awful product even worse!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save yourself the headache, burning, stickiness, and don&#x27;t buy this deodorant! I never bother to review things but I HAD TO if it could save at least one person from the uncomfortableness and burning pain I endured for the past two weeks trying to make it work!</li>
    <li> I started using the 12 hour Lavender scent and while I loved the scent, the deodorant factor barely lasted 4 hours.  I had to buy another one to take to work just to get the through the day.  When I discovered the 24 hour protection, I immediately bought it.  I had no burning sensation or irritation, and while it certainly didn&#x27;t last 24 hours,I was able to get through the work day and into the evening without any odor. I even sweat  a little (which is natural and I&#x27;m good with that)and the deodorant combatted the potential odor well.  I&#x27;m not fond of the fragrance (I prefer lavender), but I could live with it.  Until today (about three weeks after starting to use it), I would have given this deodorant much higher marks. Alas, it was time to wax my pits and when I raised my arm over my head--GASP--my underarms were a sort of reddish gray color and there was faint peeling (like a sunburn). The discoloration was exactly in the area where I apply the deodorant. I went online and found out I&#x27;m not alone--on the one hand it&#x27;s good not to be the only peeling pit person, on the other...well, peeling pits and discolored skin are not so good. In the meantime, back to the old anti-perspirant loaded with aluminum until this funky problem goes away. (Side note: Lady Speed Stick does have the least amount of aluminum--15.4%--of all the anti-perspirant brands I have checked.  Most had 18% or higher.)</li>
    <li> If this doesn&#x27;t cause a rash for you, you&#x27;re in the happy minority. For many people out there [...] it causes the skin to peel off your armpits and a burning sensation. This seems to be occurring specifically with their \\&quot;long lasting\\&quot; varieties.   best of luck-</li>
    <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t work for me. I think mine says 24 hour protection, but it doesn&#x27;t last even a few hours. Also, I found that if I get dressed right after I put it on it leaves wet marks that show through my shirt. It makes it look like I have sweaty pits. So now I have to wait a little while before I finish getting dressed, wipe my armpits with some tissue, and then put a shirt on. I don&#x27;t want to throw the whole thing out as it was over 4 bucks, but this stuff just does not work. It smells nice, but that&#x27;s about it. I will never buy it again.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had an easy time trying to find a natural deodorant.  Either they aren&#x27;t \\&quot;strong\\&quot; enough to last throughout the day or, like this product, they burn my skin to the point that it is raw.  I used this product for only a day and a half before I had to run to the nearest bathroom to wash this crap from my pits.  As of now, I am still using regular deodorant.  I would love to drop the stuff, but I have yet to find an adequate replacement.</li>
    <li> I barely ever write reviews, but I felt the need to do so for this particular product. I have stupidly sensitive skin (eczema and contact dermatitis), so recently I&#x27;ve been trying to switch to all-natural products to see if that helps. I gave this product two stars instead of one because it smells amazing! BUT it has caused my underarm skin to start peeling really bad... Apparently, I&#x27;m not the only one who has experienced this issue, as I have read on multiple websites. Other than that glaring problem, the deodorant has worked well for me; I have a very physical job which requires me to walk 8-10 miles a day, and Tom&#x27;s long-lasting apricot deodorant seemed to have been up to the task. I just wish it didn&#x27;t mess up my skin so horribly! I&#x27;m discontinuing use of this product and switching to Jason&#x27;s Aloe Vera Gel Deodorant. I have read much better reviews for this product.</li>
    <li> I used to have a horrible sweating problem. No matter what deodorant i used i would sweat so much that i would stain all of my shirts. I could not wear white shirts because of this. I kept switching brands even trying the more expensive prescription strength antiperspirant which did nothing at all. I read online that Aluminum can actually make people sweat more because it clogs your pores and your body reacts by sweating even more to try and remove the aluminum. Since i started using Tom&#x27;s of Maine Long Lasting Stick i have had a dramatic decrease in the amount i sweat. I am even able to wear white shirts. I also love the apricot scent of this product. Further i love supporting a company that does not test on animals.      PS: I recommend using a loofah on your armpits when you first start using this product and once a week after the first week to to help un-clog your pores.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been interested in trying a natural, aluminum-free deodorant for quite some time. I picked the apricot smell because it was pleasant and not too strong and the other choice was lavender, which can sometimes smell too \\&quot;organic-y\\&quot; for my tastes. Unfortunately, this pick just doesn&#x27;t work.     This deodorant says it provides 12-hour protection, whereas my aluminum-containing Dove deodorant claims 24 hour-long protection. I don&#x27;t usually struggle with body odor and have never smelled myself with Dove deodorant, even after a period longer than 24 hours. However, with Tom&#x27;s, even while I&#x27;m aware that it wouldn&#x27;t last as long, I can smell body odor in just 5 or 6 hours. Gross!!! I feel I need either to shower or reapply the deodorant every few hours or so, which just isn&#x27;t realistic. On a minor note, I also don&#x27;t like how the solid stick becomes liquid in consistency upon application and takes forever to dry. So sad. I really would like to find an alumnium-free deodorant that works!</li>
    <li> I was at my local walmart when I decided to see if they had any aluminum free deoderant. I honestly thought I would have to goto a natural food store, but there sat toms apricot on the shelf. I was excited to find it and put it in my shopping cart. I decided that my son and I would originally share as I did not want to spend more money and not like it.   He puts on the aluminum deodarant and after outside playing for an hour is stinky. I had him put on toms deoderant before going out to play, and my oh my!!! we have found the answer to some stinky adolescent armpits!!! It works for me also, and am happy I can now wear aluminum free deoderant. neither my son or i have had any foaming, or redness, or anything crazy like i have read. but i am beginning to wonder if alot of peoples reactions are actually the aluminum clearing from their bodies and its reacting to the zinc? only a guess on my part. anywho my son and i have no problems whatsoever with this product and are going to be toms customers from here on out. love the smell and how it doesnt make us smell:)</li>
    <li> As someone has become more health conscious, I wanted to started using skincare products that were better for me and for the environment.  Naturally, this included finding an aluminum free deodorant.  Tom&#x27;s of Maine was my first choice since it was recommended by a friend who uses it religiously.  I started off with the original scent which did not work at all.  I then opted for the Apricot version and my experience with this product went down hill from there.  Initially, I felt a slight sting but I attributed that sensation to my skin just getting used to the new aluminum free formula.  After a few months, I noticed my skin peeling and my armpits turning red.  Tonight, I looked at my armpits a little closer and I now have red, raw skin over the lower half of my armpits.  It&#x27;s disgusting!  Despite the lovely smell of the Apricot and the aluminum free formula, I can not use this deodorant any longer.  My armpits look like they were severely sunburned.  Off to finding something better...</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and regular deodorant makes me break out so I started using Adidas aluminum free deodorant which worked really well. Eventually though I couldn&#x27;t find it in the store anymore, I guess they stopped selling it. So I started using toms and I thought it smelled pretty decent but it doesn&#x27;t work! Like, at all. I put it on and literally a minute later I&#x27;m sweating and the deodorant it starting to smell really...I don&#x27;t know how to describe it but it&#x27;s just weird. Not weird in a good way either. My advice is use it if you want to but not if you sweat a lot like I do or if you&#x27;re about to do something where you know you&#x27;re going to get really sweaty because if you try to go to the club and dance or something while wearing toms then trust me you&#x27;re gonna be pretty ripe in about 30 minutes so just wear regular deodorant. So basically only wear toms in the winter time when you&#x27;re doing absolutely nothing. Then it works. I guess.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite!  I usually purchase it at Walgreens or CVS, but the price here is quite competitive.  If you don&#x27;t require a strong deodorant and want something light, fresh without a flowery smell this apricot deodorant is perfect.</li>
    <li> Maybe it&#x27;s my body chemistry, but this product works fine for me (African-American female). No burning, peeling, bumpy, raw skin for me, though I don&#x27;t recommend using DIRECTLY after shaving. All deodorants burn my skin when applied directly after shaving. It is best used on clean skin, though. I have to wait a 1-2 minutes so it can dry before I put on a shirt, but I&#x27;m ok with that. The longer your armpit hairs are, the foamier this product gets, and the longer it takes to dry. Be warned that this is a deodorant, NOT an antiperspirant. I&#x27;m not a heavy armpit sweater, so this isn&#x27;t a problem. Other deodorants clog my sweat glands, but this one doesn&#x27;t. Jell deodorants of this type usually turn sour on me half way through the bottle, but the smell on this one is holding up nicely. I do recommend not relying on this completely, though.&lt;br /&gt;(bought at Target)</li>
    <li> First off, let me rate the \\&quot;long lasting scent\\&quot; part of this, with one word: nonsense. I realize natural deodorants are not as strong as aluminum based, but compared to the new natural brand I use, Earth Science Mint Rosemary, Tom&#x27;s is awful. Even the scent doesn&#x27;t smell good to begin with after smelling other natural brands&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the real review: perhaps I missed it on the warning label, but I was unaware that zinc ricinoleate caused SEVERE allergic reactions in several people! (Here I was worried about cancer causing aluminum...!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am one of the lucky victims that got to experience the dark side of this wonderful, natural deodorant. Unfortunately, I did not realize it was the deodorant initially, as I work out frequently and related this chafe like BURN to the lack of antiperspirant while exercising. I ditched the Tom&#x27;s, and went back to Dove. The \\&quot;chafing\\&quot; healed. I eventually decided that I could buy new moisture wicking work out clothes to avoid the chafing and stick to a \\&quot;healthy\\&quot; natural product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well that was a mistake. About 4 days after continuing with Tom&#x27;s I had severe peeling, dryness, and burning in my under arms! It was as if the gates of HELL had been opened. I got smart at this point and googled Tom&#x27;s and found plenty of people with this issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m writing this after over a week Tom&#x27;s free, and I&#x27;m still in pain. I was literally burned by this product. It&#x27;s definitely healed up a lot, but the red and dry dust bowls that were once was my armpits have still not fully recovered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you visit their website you can see them defend the allergic reactions with \\&quot;everyone is unique and some people are hurt by the zinc ricinoleate.\\&quot; Which is just unacceptable! If you look up zinc ricinoleate articles talk of FREQUENT allergic reactions.. Not a few people, s.e.v.e.r.a.l.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short: by no means \\&quot;experiment\\&quot; with this product to see if you can handle the zinc ricinoleate. IT IS NOT WORTH IT!!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this deodorant!  I have very sensitive skin and Tom&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t irritate it at all.. even with the scented ones.  I have read that it doesn&#x27;t work for some people, but since becoming vegan my sweat isn&#x27;t as offensive, so that probably helps :)</li>
    <li> overwhelmingly sticky sweet smell. lasted an amazingly long time, but made me want to retch every time I raised my arms. I love the Calendula and Lavender versions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice that it&#x27;s aluminum free- especially since I&#x27;m breastfeeding.</li>
    <li> In order to make this review relevant, I&#x27;ll tell you that I&#x27;m a male and I work outdoors pretty much most of the year.  In other words, I sweat a lot when it&#x27;s hot.  I purchased the Tom&#x27;s of Maine Natural Care 12 hour long lasting apricot deodorant stick because it was aluminum free and the apricot smell was the least offensive out of the available choices.  In my case, some of the negative side affects that I read about in other reviews were actually true.  Upon applying the deodorant stick, I did notice the it would start to foam up as though I was putting shaving cream under my arms.  Secondly, after a few days of usage, my underarms started to have a burning sensation once I applied the deodorant.  Finally, the effectiveness of the deodorant deteriorated as the day progressed, so much so that I would ask the Lord to have mercy on anyone who was standing next to me after 12:01 hours of wearing said deodorant.  I finally gave up on the product and switched to Naturally Fresh Deodorant Crystal.  I must say that I&#x27;m impressed with my new purchase; I worked in 90 degree weather, same work schedule and I made it home without any traces of a hard days work.  I&#x27;m giving the Tom&#x27;s Brand two stars because at least they tried to make a product without using aluminum.</li>
    <li> Well, if by &amp;#34;long-lasting&amp;#34; they mean &amp;#34;your BO will return like Sauron in LOTR&amp;#34;, then sure, it lasts a while. Okay, so maybe it isn&#x27;t that bad, but the long-lasting effects are anything but. The initial scent is lovely, but it&#x27;s got a half-life of maybe an hour. By midday my BO has made a return, and the lovely scent that once graced my pits is gone. I&#x27;m also unsure about the texture/feel of this deodorant. Instead of a traditional powdery &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; feeling, it goes on feeling like oil (coconut oil, maybe), and feels a bit sticky and awkward until it has soaked in. I switched to Arm &amp; Hammer Naturals and have found it to be a MUCH better alternative (while unscented, it has that &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; odor, and it lasts all day).</li>
    <li> So I ordered this and firstly it wasn&#x27;t the scent that I chose and secondly this stuff DOES NOT WORK, at least not for me. I used it once and an hour later my underarms actually stunk!!! I normally use Secret anti persp, which works brilliantly; but I heard products with aluminum can be harmful so I thought I&#x27;d give this a try. I put loads on and after 1-2hrs I smelled and that has never happened as I am not someone who sweats very much at all. This may be great for a lot of people but for me this stuff is rubbish. I&#x27;ll take my chances with the aluminum.</li>
    <li> This deodorant protects you from the smellies for at least two days, and it won&#x27;t cause dementia or alzheimer&#x27;s due to the aluminum - because there isn&#x27;t any! Imagine that?</li>
    <li> I use many Tom&#x27;s of Maine products, and am generally satisfied.  However, this product is awful.  It&#x27;s so drying that my armpit skin peels and flakes off.  No one wants peeling armpits.  The roller ball version of this product (in the clear, squat container, not the taller opaque container) doesn&#x27;t have the same drying effect, and seems to last longer.</li>
    <li> I really struggle sticking to a natural deoderant none of them really cut it for me. The apricot by Tom&#x27;s is the best of the bunch for me. I have tried Crystal, Toms Lavender, Toms Calendula, Trader Joes unscented with Cotton fibers, Vinegar, coconut oil, Homeade baking soda deoderant sticks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new bottles say 24 hrs on them but the formulation is pretty much the same. I have had mine on 12 hours right now and its still holding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;********** update&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my never ending quest to find the best natural deoderant I splurged on an $18 luxury brand (LAVANILA)&lt;br /&gt;My Tom&#x27;s apricot still comes out on top the $18 brand smelled and felt nice but quit working after 2-3 hours.&lt;br /&gt;I used the Vanilla/Lavender</li>
    <li> I started using this deodorant about a week ago after picking some up on a whim, and I love it. It does last the full 24 hours for me and possibly longer. My favorite thing about it is how great my skin feels there now. It feels soft, smooth, and clean. It&#x27;s awesome. I apply it right after getting out of the shower (i.e. after I&#x27;ve shaved), and I haven&#x27;t experienced any burning or redness. Of course, it is winter right now, so we&#x27;ll see how well this does for me during summer. Hopefully it works because I never want to go back to using antiperspirants.</li>
    <li> I came on here to re-order this product and I&#x27;m surprised at the reviews because I love this stuff.  I started using the lavender one when I was pregnant and never had a problem with odor (although when you are pregnant your sweat does not smell as much due to changes in its composition).  Even after pregnancy it&#x27;s been effective for odor.  I fell in love with it because it absorbs into my skin and feels like nothing, so the next time I shave I don&#x27;t have to worry about residue and I end up with a smoother shave.  I found it conditions my skin- my armpits have never been softer or smoother. It does sting a little (for me, it&#x27;s a few seconds) if you apply it right after you shave, so I wait a few minutes and I&#x27;m fine.  I also like that it&#x27;s clear, so I never have to worry about deodorant smudges on clothing.</li>
    <li> My 7 year old son has a lactose allergy/intolerance that causes him to sweat and have underarm odor.  We tried a different kid&#x27;s deodorant from amazon that did not last the whole day.  This works great!  From day 1 all underarm odor was eliminated.  It lasts throughout the whole day (and really until it is washed off).  Life changing for our little boy.</li>
    <li> Advantages:&lt;br /&gt;NOT sticky. Easy to wash off in the shower. Works for 24 hours in hot and humid Florida.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application recommendation:&lt;br /&gt;Wash off old deo very very well in the shower. Dry skin with towel. Apply plenty of deo. Since it&#x27;s not sticky, you can put on more than one layer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Result:&lt;br /&gt;I do photography in hot and humid Florida summers. This deo works!</li>
    <li> I never use Tom&#x27;s of Maine if I already have sweated a lot. If I don&#x27;t remember to put it on in the morning then I usually won&#x27;t put any on later unless I really haven&#x27;t sweated much yet. If my underarms are moist then this deodorant doesn&#x27;t help, it just causes my skin to peel off and sometimes I&#x27;ll even get a rash. I know people with sensitive skin who no matter what have some issues with this deodorant but I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the only deodorant I use and I&#x27;m careful to always remember to put it on in the morning and it works like a charm for me. I&#x27;ve tried other natural deodorants but none of them worked well, they were too weak. I also tend to not sweat much so I don&#x27;t know how well this stuff would work for someone who sweats more than myself. The Lemongrass scent does not go well with the small amount of the sweat smell that I get sometimes but the lavender and the apricot do. I like some of their other scents as well but lavender and apricot are my favorites.</li>
    <li> I have been using natural skincare for a while.  I decided the next step in the natural direction would be deodorant.  I picked up Tom&#x27;s of Maine Apricot scent.  I thought it smelled really nice.  The first few days I was pleasantly surprised.  It wasn&#x27;t as powerful as non natural brands, but it did keep odor at bay.  I have been using this for about two weeks, and now my armpits are on fire!  At first I couldn&#x27;t figure out what was wrong.  My arm pits were literally peeling.  They felt like that had a really bad sunburn.  I didn&#x27;t put two and two together for a few more days.  My arm pits are bright red and they are on fire.  I can&#x27;t even shave my arm pits right now...gross right?  I am having to put 100% shea butter on before I go to bed.  I actually feel like I have a chemical burn.      Before writing this review off, I have to tell you I have never had a reaction to ANY product.  I have used probably close to 100 different brands of cosmetics and skincare products from cheap to expensive, from non natural to completely natural.  This is the ONLY product I have ever had a reaction to.  Please be careful.  I would start out with the unscented kind first.  That one seems to have better reviews.  Also, the first time you notice irritation, discontinue use!  It will only get worse.</li>
    <li> No aluminum!  That&#x27;s great for the &amp;#34;breast cancer&amp;#34; factor!  I had doubts, since I have strong odor for a girl sometimes.  But this stuff works amazing!  And the scent is light but good.  I love it.</li>
    <li> for some reason it burns when i first put it on and by mid afternoon i smell dont think ill buy again</li>
    <li> I got this in beautiful earth and it smells lovely. I recently got on a \\&quot;kick\\&quot; of trying to phase out aluminum based deodorants and have been trying a few natural ones with no success. I actually tried Tom&#x27;s a few years ago (in lavender) and it caused burning redness after the first day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having been a while, and the packaging change, I decided to try it again. Nope... by the second day my pits are starting to turn red and burn. In addition, while it smells nice, it&#x27;s hardly 24 hour protection. The smell started to wear off by the evening and by the time I went to bed I had mild odor. I&#x27;m not a particularly sweaty or smelly person so this is definitely not for anyone who perspires moderately to heavily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also shaved this morning and OWWW! Putting this deodorant on after a shave is pretty painful.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this, it goes on nicely and keeps me smelling good all day. I&#x27;ve used this deodorant for about three years now.</li>
    <li> Best product I have found so far that is aluminum free and it smells great.</li>
    <li> This deodorant was not a good choice for me.  My skin is fairly sensitive and it caused my skin to become very irritated and actually started peel.  If I had to apply it more than once a day (say after an afternoon shower) it would burn my underarms.  Forget about shaving your armpits and then applying - it was like I was rubbing my armpits with alcohol.  I definitely smelled fresh but this is not something I could everyday - very irritating.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sad. I bought this deodorant and was really excited to try it. I have previously used Dove and Secret deodorant with no issues. This was my first time trying a natural deodorant so I have nothing to compare it to. It smells FANTASTIC. It&#x27;s a little weirdly sticky when you apply it. Kinda like a solid lip gloss or something because it doesn&#x27;t go on easy but it&#x27;s like a slick rubbery thing. This deodorant made me raw CRAZY itchy and red for days after applying it once. I gave it a second try on a different day to make sure it was the deodorant making me itchy. Same results. I really wanted to like this product and I&#x27;m really not that sensitive to any products except for my lips. Disappointed. It went straight to the trash after that. &#x3D;(</li>
    <li> Do you long to have perfectly red, scaley, dry, RAW underarms?&lt;br /&gt;Then look no further! Tom&#x27;s of Maine all natural apricot deodorant is the deodorant for you, my friend!&lt;br /&gt;Within minutes of application, your underarms will begin to sting.. but just wait, there&#x27;s more! Within several hours, your underarms will begin BURN with the white hot intensity of a thousand suns. As a free bonus, you will be unable to let any type of clothing touch your underarm area, due to the intense pain. That&#x27;s right! You get the pain, absolutely FREE!&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t stop applying now. Keep applying this terrific product daily. With continued use, your underarm area will become so dry and irritated, that it will completely scab over. Within days, that deliciously crispy scab will start to rub off, leaving you with those perfectly raw red pits you&#x27;ve always dreamed of. Who could ask for more?</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work! It&#x27;s just like you didn&#x27;t put any on at all. I smelled like BO! I actually smelled myself and I shower everyday. Also my pits felt like they were on fire.</li>
    <li> I started my hunt for aluminum-free deodorant because I was tired of the aluminum ruining my clothes. This is the first natural deodorant I&#x27;ve tried and I&#x27;m not impressed with it. Granted, I didn&#x27;t run into the rash/discoloration a lot of people here describe (I also don&#x27;t use it right after I shave either so maybe that&#x27;s imporant?).  I don&#x27;t care for the apricot scent even though it does kind of last.  (I work in an office, not physically challenging at all.) By the end of the day I smell like an odd mixture of apricot and subtle odor.  I know it&#x27;s not an antiperspirant but I hate how damp it feels. It doesn&#x27;t seem to dry at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve really been trying to swap in healthier, more natural products into my every day life and figured I&#x27;d go ahead and do what I could for the old arm pits. For about 12 years now I&#x27;ve had to use Secret with Olay because I have some extremely sensitive arm pits. If I even think about using anything like Dove or Suave, within a couple days I can barely shave my arm pits without tears because they hurt so much. I mean I can barely stand to keep my arms down, very tender. SO, with a lot of reservation I gave this a go. At first I was pleasantly surprised... a little more expensive than what I currently use, but I&#x27;d be willing to sacrifice that dollar or so for a more natural alternative. So, firstly this doesn&#x27;t stop the sweat, you&#x27;ll still sweat, it&#x27;s just supposed to block the smell. And it doesn&#x27;t do that all too well, either. It&#x27;ll work for a little while but if you do anything remotely physical, you will probably have to reapply. After being on my treadmill for 30 minutes, forget about it, didn&#x27;t help at all. I stuck with it for a couple weeks and I was noticing a little sensitivity with the under arms, but it didn&#x27;t really get bad until a couple days ago. They are now red and tender. I put my old Secret with Olay on this morning and breathed out a sigh of relief, it felt so nice and calmed the rash. Sorry Toms, but Gels suck and something in your ingredients is obviously just not working, too many of us are getting rashes!</li>
    <li> Trying to find an aluminum free deodorant?  Don&#x27;t try this one.  It made my underarms sticky.  After an hour I couldn&#x27;t stand it and had to wash it off.</li>
    <li> My daughter has huge dark brownish red patches in her armpits from using this. She says its painful and swollen. She has had this for less than a week and stopped using it a few days ago. I told her to just throw it away. I have never seen anything like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On another note, this customer service at Toms of Maine is such a nightmare. I wasn&#x27;t asking for a refund or being a jerk. I simply called to let them know, in my mind, basically just being socially responsible. I asked them if they are getting a lot of calls about this product. They weren&#x27;t \\&quot;at liberty\\&quot; to say. I disagree with the way they handled my call. They shuffled me around and sent my call to the Pittsburg poison control center.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live in Maine and this is Tom&#x27;s of Maine, so I&#x27;m wondering why I have just been transferred to Pittsburg. I pretty much feel like this company is being run by Looney Tunes. (And, no, I&#x27;m not affiliated with Warner Bros.) o.O</li>
    <li> I like this product.  while it is not as good as a deodorant that contains aluminum salts, it is good enough for most days.  If you really sweat a lot and are prone to body odor, this product may not be what you are looking for.  You may have to apply several times during the day to control odor.</li>
    <li> Red, itchy rash began about 5 minutes after application so I had to immediately wash it off. Horrible. I don&#x27;t usually have skin allergies. This is pretty bad considering even Axe deodorant stick doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. Needless to say, I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
    <li> smells great, lasts long, leaves you with horrible rashes. Very disappointed in Toms. Makes me doubt their other products. Not happy at all.</li>
    <li> I like this deodorant very much. It helped me with a minor rash that just went away when I started using it. The smell is very subtle.</li>
