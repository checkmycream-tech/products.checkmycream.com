      <li>we use them to scrub the dog. :)</li>
      <li>I like the Earth Therapeutics better, so for that reason it gets 5 stars, but if you prefer a lighter scrub then Swissco  might be your preference</li>

      <li>They work fantastic!</li>

      <li>hoping they won&#x27;t fall apart as so many of these things do.</li>
      <li>(I have medium/average lady hands) - they stretch nicely and I can imagine they&#x27;d fit most hands.</li>

      <li>Good as new.</li>
      <li>I have been using these mitts for a year now and they seem to be holding up fine still.</li>
      <li>---it works fine too.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used body wash and a bar of soap both to do so, either works fine.</li>
      <li>She says they have excellent texture for scrubbing and they lasted 1.5 years with everyday use.</li>
      <li>They have the perfect roughness to do the job, while still remaining gentle enough so my skin isn&#x27;t stinging with pain.</li>
      <li>so far pretty great and not flimsy.</li>
      <li>It makes showering more joyful easy and fast.</li>
      <li>really well, i actually dont have to put any pressure to get a really nice good scrubbing.</li>
      <li>I had tried out a glove like this that my fiancee had a while back, and they were great for getting my face feeling incredibly fresh and clean.</li>
      <li>Massage and clean even your feet (and every toe) in these gloves.</li>
      <li>Gloves are as described and great for getting dry skin off while in the shower.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;They have great traction for dry winter skin!&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
      <li>I love these gloves so much, I don&#x27;t know how I lived without them.</li>
      <li>im able to move better and grab things on that tiny NY bathroom!&lt;br /&gt;Oh</li>
      <li>High quality, l love it</li>
      <li>Glad I purchased, works very well for my 16 year old acne prone teenager, who has used so many products and now he uses the glove twice a week.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s too soft to do anything more than clean.  </li>
      <li>When I put lotion on my body it seems to go a lot further and glide on more easily.</li>
      <li>Unlike another reviewer, I think they fit my hands really well</li>
      <li>I now realize how important exfoliation really is</li>
      <li>So simple yet amazing.  </li>
      <li>The kind you buy in the grocery store and the same brand</li>
      <li>They are both so inexpensive, it is worth owning both:  </li>
      <li>that&#x27;s right for you.</li>
      <li>The gloves are just right</li>
      <li>Yes that&#x27;s right gloves.  </li>
      <li>Feel I can really get the gloves clean after use</li>
      <li>Can sub for a hot glove in a pinch.</li>
      <li>I would say that I have average-sized lady hands, and have never had a problem fitting into one-size-fits-all gloves, but these are too big on me.</li>
      <li>Leaves skin soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>I use them to scrub off self-tanner in the shower before reapplying it, and they work pretty well at getting the tanner off.</li>
      <li>I really like these gloves!  </li>
      <li>My skin is now so smooth and clear.</li>
      <li>It is so much easier than loading up a bath scrubbier - since you are just basically using your hands!</li>
      <li>My skin feels so soft and smooth after use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Great for sloughing off dead skin and feeling extra clean.</li>
      <li>It&#x27; kind of expensive given you&#x27;ll want to replace it after a month or 2, but it does work effectively.</li>
      <li>They are rough but not irritatingly so, the cuff has a nice elastic</li>
      <li>They are nice and easy to use- dry quickly, no problems with that... even in super humid Florida.</li>
      <li>After they are ready, I pretty well just pretend I am rubbing in lotion or sunscreen.</li>
      <li>I certainly will</li>
      <li>These exfoliating gloves seem to be made for large hands.</li>
      <li>I shower completely first using my luffa like normal, then toss these on.</li>
      <li>Today I&#x27;m in a mood to review as much products as i can from amazon (it could be the earthing mat</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t realize how much it helped my &amp;#34;chicken skin&amp;#34; condition until I stopped using it.</li>
      <li>I just wish I would have known about these so much sooner.</li>
      <li>They make my Bath and Body Works sugar scrubs go so much farther.  </li>
      <li>I first soak them in water until they are wet through (which you can easily see happening), and then I apply a bit of soap to them.</li>
      <li>To make sure there was no bias,  I then turned around so his hands would be trying the other side.  </li>
      <li>Well made, high quality.</li>
      <li>and I highly recommend these.</li>
      <li>Wow, I really like these gloves, I wear both of them in the shower</li>
      <li>i got the green, and I love the color as well.</li>
      <li>I have a hot tub at home, so I first soaked in it for 15 minutes until the dry skin started loosening in ropes.  </li>
      <li>I used natural products before this glove does an even better job to remove dead skin.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It&#x27;s not &amp;#34;Free Shipping&amp;#34; as advertised.  If you dig down into the small print, you&#x27;ll find that, in fact, Free Shipping is only offered within the Continental US.  I&#x27;ll purchase through Ebay where &amp;#34;Free Shipping&amp;#34; means &amp;#34;Free Shipping.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> GOOD PRICE FAST DELIVERY</li>
    <li> These were recommended to me to help exfoliate without using pore clogging body creams or irritating salt rubs.  It prevents after shaving regrowth discomforts.  I use it everyday, too.  Not too harsh.</li>
    <li> My skin is about as delicate as a tank tread. My elbows look like a wasteland, while my face could probably solve an oil crisis by the end of a day. I had tried out a glove like this that my fiancee had a while back, and they were great for getting my face feeling incredibly fresh and clean. I then decided to head out onto the interwebs in search of a pair for myself. After reading lots of reviews, I ordered these. They work fantastic! I shower completely first using my luffa like normal, then toss these on. I first soak them in water until they are wet through (which you can easily see happening), and then I apply a bit of soap to them. I&#x27;ve used body wash and a bar of soap both to do so, either works fine. With no soap it was just slightly less comfortable. After they are ready, I pretty well just pretend I am rubbing in lotion or sunscreen. I focus mainly on the bad spots for myself that tend to get oily, sweaty, calloused, etc. I always start with my face, which I can feel getting cleaner as I use them. If I miss a spot, I know it without looking in a mirror or touching it, but for testing sake I only did half my face one time. I looked like I was wearing old makeup or something on the &#x27;dirty&#x27; side. I then follow up by doing the sweaty zones... arm pits and *cough we won&#x27;t say this one in the review ;) cough*, and then finish up by getting the dried or calloused parts like my elbows, ankles, and the bottoms of my feet. I think I&#x27;ll leave this just as an audio review, and save you all from the video!    I would definitely recommend these to others, and have in fact to several that mentioned to me that I looked more &#x27;awake&#x27; or asked if I had done my hair differently or anything of that sort.</li>
    <li> I like Turkish hamams and Korean spa scrubs, but sadly there are none of those near my new house.  Looking for a similar experience at home, I conducted a test of this product against the Swissco gloves  (see http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0069D70UA/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1 ).  Here is how the test was conducted, and the results.    1.  I have a hot tub at home, so I first soaked in it for 15 minutes until the dry skin started loosening in ropes.  2.  Hopped into the shower.  Used these gloves to scrub one side of my body and the other gloves to scrub the other side.  3.  This was not dry-tested.  I used a sugar scrub for soap.  4.  Scrubbed HARD.  Neither glove produced ropes of skin like at the spa.  5.  Earth therapeutics felt \\&quot;harsher\\&quot;, i.e. more scratchily satisfying,  which is what I like.  If you like a softer scrub, the Swissco glove would be better for you.  6.  Afterwards,  both sides were noticeably better---no dry \\&quot;alligator skin\\&quot;.  (It&#x27;s winter here and my skin gets dry.)  To the eye, no difference in the two sides.  My skin doesn&#x27;t feel itchy anymore.  7.  I thought the FEEL of Earth Therapeutics&#x27; side was slightly smoother, so I then had my husband do a \\&quot;skin feel test\\&quot;, both hands at the same time.  To make sure there was no bias,  I then turned around so his hands would be trying the other side.  He proclaimed no difference in the feel or smoothness.    So there you have it.  I like the Earth Therapeutics better, so for that reason it gets 5 stars, but if you prefer a lighter scrub then Swissco  might be your preference---it works fine too. These feel like better quality, so if you&#x27;re looking to give as a gift I&#x27;d give these---or give both! They are both so inexpensive, it is worth owning both:  I will probably use Earth Therapeutics weekly but the gentler Swissco every other day.  If I notice later any difference in results,  I&#x27;ll report that here in an update.</li>
    <li> I love these gloves so much, I don&#x27;t know how I lived without them. I have seen so much improvement in my skin since using these gloves in the shower daily in combination with my topical treatments for acne. The rest of my skin (that doesn&#x27;t get acne) is smoother as well. I now realize how important exfoliation really is and I highly recommend these. They are also durable and long-lasting. Just put them in the washing machine and voila! Good as new.</li>
    <li> Amazing! I will keep buying these. I&#x27;ve used these daily for about 3 months and they are still awesome.</li>
    <li> Nice course scrubby gloves. Leaves skin soft and smooth. Although I leave them out to dry, after a while smell a bit musty. A trip through the washing machine fixes that. Good for the price.</li>
    <li> I really like these gloves!  They make my Bath and Body Works sugar scrubs go so much farther.  They definitely exfoliate and they don&#x27;t irritate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They lose a star, though, because even though I&#x27;m not using them on anything dirty (I wash off lotion from the day before before using these) they have turned black and got even blacker after I washed them.  It&#x27;s not mold so I&#x27;m not sure what it is.</li>
    <li> I purchased five or six different exfoliating gloves for my wife to try out.  These were the absolute best.  She says they have excellent texture for scrubbing and they lasted 1.5 years with everyday use.</li>
    <li> Hands down, the most effective body exfoliater I&#x27;ve ever bought in my life!!!!!!! I&#x27;ve spent money on some body scrubbers from every major retailer. This is the best one and the fact that it&#x27;s in a glove form makes it easier to hit every body part in great detail. Massage and clean even your feet (and every toe) in these gloves. I just wish I would have known about these so much sooner. I need to stock up cause I a total lifelong customer as far as these babies are concerned.</li>
    <li> So simple yet amazing.  Game changer!</li>
    <li> Very good product made well and works well</li>
    <li> I waited so long to treat myself to decent shower gloves. I could scrub with these all day, like bears rubbing up against a tree to scratch their back.&lt;br /&gt;The flimsy ones you buy at the &#x27;other&#x27; stores aren&#x27;t worth a thing, just a fake substitute for these, they cannot compare.&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor and buy these, treat yourself.&lt;br /&gt;You will love the sensation and the smooth lovely skin you gain from using these.&lt;br /&gt;They have great traction for dry winter skin!&lt;br /&gt;They prepare your skin for moisture that would otherwise not penetrate.&lt;br /&gt;A ++++ product.</li>
    <li> Works extremely well.....</li>
    <li> This exfoliating glove has worked wonders on my skin. My skin is now so smooth and clear. I had back-acne and after a month of using this exfoliating glove, i no longer have back-acne. it has cleared up my entire body. Do not use it on the face! it is harsh on your face, especially if you have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Works well for intended use.  Can sub for a hot glove in a pinch.</li>
    <li> So much better than a loofah..Feel I can really get the gloves clean after use and they are not too rough on my skin.  Great for sloughing off dead skin and feeling extra clean.</li>
    <li> I love these gloves! Absolutely amazing and they are rough enough to work but soft enough to just use. They are a little larger but I figure if they get completely wet in the shower or so they might just contour to your hand. Anyway, I recommend for men and women. :) will update as I use them more. 6/11/2014</li>
    <li> It&#x27; kind of expensive given you&#x27;ll want to replace it after a month or 2, but it does work effectively. I didn&#x27;t realize how much it helped my &amp;#34;chicken skin&amp;#34; condition until I stopped using it.</li>
    <li> I purchased these for normal hygiene purposes but found that they truly perform above what I expected. I found that these gloves could remove all sorts of impurities, ranging from mud to ground in coal dust. My skin feels so soft and smooth after use.&lt;br /&gt;I do not know if the gloves are made to be washed, but I do wash them every few weeks. So far I haven&#x27;t had to replace them, but when the time comes to purchase new ones I certainly will</li>
    <li> Yes that&#x27;s right gloves.  Just exfoliating gloves.  The kind you buy in the grocery store and the same brand but at a better price.</li>
    <li> very nice cleans and softens my skin</li>
    <li> I have been using these mitts for a year now and they seem to be holding up fine still. I would recommend washing them in the clothes washer every week or so just because in my shower I have that pink slime and it get into the fibers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I primarily use these with the Moroccan Black soap (Eucalyptus and olives) to get the soap foamy (see my review there on how I wash with these and that soap)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These mitts are soft enough for your 2000 parts and hard enough to slough off dead skin. I did find when I first got them, they were a little rougher than now. I got a rash from scrubbing too hard on the second day. Now they have warn a little being a little softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also poked a hole over time in them because I usually only use one to maximize the foamy soap; switching from one hand to the other in the middle of washing to get the other side of me. So now my thumb pokes out of the pinky side of the mitts.</li>
    <li> These are a good exfoliating glove....use it, wash hang over towel go dry....</li>
    <li> Glad I purchased, works very well for my 16 year old acne prone teenager, who has used so many products and now he uses the glove twice a week.</li>
    <li> These are just what you want in exfoliating gloves. They are rough but not irritatingly so, the cuff has a nice elastic so they don&#x27;t slide off in the shower and they do what they were hired to do. i got the green, and I love the color as well.</li>
    <li> These gloves work wonders on exfoliating in the shower.  Just plop some body wash or scrub on them and go at it!  It is so much easier than loading up a bath scrubbier - since you are just basically using your hands!</li>
    <li> These are nice scrubby gloves. They are nice and easy to use- dry quickly, no problems with that... even in super humid Florida.</li>
    <li> Effective exfoliator at a great price.</li>
    <li> Works like a champ, and when they get old....we use them to scrub the dog. :)</li>
    <li> good glove - nice colour options</li>
    <li> High quality, l love it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d suggest only using these on rough areas, like the bottom of your feet.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s been a 2 weeks and i have noticeably softer skin :)</li>
    <li> so far pretty great and not flimsy. hoping they won&#x27;t fall apart as so many of these things do.</li>
    <li> These exfoliating gloves seem to be made for large hands. I would say that I have average-sized lady hands, and have never had a problem fitting into one-size-fits-all gloves, but these are too big on me. Because of this, they move around a lot on my hands while I&#x27;m scrubbing away at my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, these gloves do a great job of exfoliating. I use them to scrub off self-tanner in the shower before reapplying it, and they work pretty well at getting the tanner off. They have the perfect roughness to do the job, while still remaining gentle enough so my skin isn&#x27;t stinging with pain.</li>
    <li> Today I&#x27;m in a mood to review as much products as i can from amazon (it could be the earthing mat im sitting on) hehe.&lt;br /&gt;Anyways these exfoliating gloves are amazing! i love them!! how come i never got one before i dont know? It makes showering more joyful easy and fast. I have been using loofahs for quite some time (started this year) but never really enjoyed them &#x27;cause they would sometimes slip off my hands. I have tried different loofahs from small round ones to the ones with the stick and recently the one you use as a mitten. Never felt comfortable, it was either too wide long and uncomfortable or too heavy with the absorption of the water. The gloves are just right they dont slip off my hands and im able to move better and grab things on that tiny NY bathroom!&lt;br /&gt;Oh and it scrubs really well, i actually dont have to put any pressure to get a really nice good scrubbing.</li>
    <li> Well made, high quality. Very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> Before using it I was not sure if it was worth the money, but it really does the work. I used natural products before this glove does an even better job to remove dead skin.</li>
    <li> Wow, I really like these gloves, I wear both of them in the shower and I just scrub away.  They remove lotion and everything; great purchase!</li>
    <li> They made my skin feel amazing when I put lotion on afterward. When I use them on my face it feels less tight after it dries from the shower, like there&#x27;s less of a need for moisturizer (although I still apply some most of the time). When I put lotion on my body it seems to go a lot further and glide on more easily. It&#x27;s just great. They feel like the best thing ever invented when used to wash feet. Nothing has ever felt better! My only complaint is I wish they were more durable. They&#x27;re pretty rough, but if they&#x27;re too rough for you, try only gliding them over your skin without putting a lot of pressure, the person using them is really in control of how harsh they can be. They&#x27;re definitely better than searching long and hard for an exfoliating body wash that&#x27;s right for you.</li>
    <li> Great gloves!!! They give a nice friction on the body when exfoliating. I also like that I can use my hands to exfoliate and massage a soap onto my body rather than my old exfoliating brush. Since using this my skin has never been smoother. They are also thick and durable, they don&#x27;t feel cheap at all to me. Seriously try them and you will notice a difference too!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just a wash cloth in glove form.  It&#x27;s too soft to do anything more than clean.  It&#x27;s not &amp;#34;rough&amp;#34; enough to exfoliate.</li>
    <li> Does not exfoliate at all. Nothing comes out of my skin no matter how hard I scrub. All it did was irritating my skin. Do not recommend.</li>
    <li> Gloves are as described and great for getting dry skin off while in the shower.  You can use them wet or dry and with continuous use will get your skin glowing in no time.</li>
    <li> Great gloves! These make exfoliating your skin so easy. Just put them on, add soap or body scrub, and scrub away. You can throw them in the wash with your towels every once in a  while. Unlike another reviewer, I think they fit my hands really well (I have medium/average lady hands) - they stretch nicely and I can imagine they&#x27;d fit most hands.</li>
