      <li>I accidentally ordered 3 bottles, but since they were such a great price</li>
      <li>I originally bought it to use on my bundles, but i don&#x27;t need it</li>

      <li>I noticed this even more so after I big chopped and had more texture at the ends.  </li>

      <li>This is by far one of the better products out there.</li>
      <li>I have since switched to a different product that is cheaper and gives me much better results.</li>
      <li>the price is so reasonable too!</li>
      <li>I was excited about using this wrapping lotion because I wanted to not use a hair dryer on my natural hair after washing.</li>

      <li>This product is easily found at most local drugstores and beauty supply stores for  approximately 7 bucks.  </li>
      <li>This is the first setting lotion I tried, and it definitely holds the hair and gives it some shine.  </li>
      <li>then Carol&#x27;s Daughter&#x27;s version, but the ingredient list wasn&#x27;t necessarily on my natural product path.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m transitioning from relaxed hair to natural hair by keeping my hair in curly or textured styles.  </li>
      <li>It worked perfectly on my natural hair.</li>
      <li>I just wrap set it and a few hours later have gorgeous, long lasting curls!</li>
      <li>NOT too crazy about this stuff , it is really really stiff , must use with a REALLY good oil - only good for roller sets and dont be fooled by how it says OIL on the bottle - it leaves you almost completely dry without oil</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m currently transitioning my hair to its natural state and am wearing a protective style.</li>

    <li> I love this product!  I&#x27;m currently transitioning my hair to its natural state and am wearing a protective style. I found this mousse on an online tutorial and decided to give it a try and fell in love!! My curls seriously last ALL day!! This product smells wonderful and allows me to not use any heat on my curl. I just wrap set it and a few hours later have gorgeous, long lasting curls! I accidentally ordered 3 bottles, but since they were such a great price and I love the product, I&#x27;m glad I did because I will be using them all!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m transitioning from relaxed hair to natural hair by keeping my hair in curly or textured styles.  I was using the Motions wrap foam to set my hair in curlformers or braidouts.  That had a better hold then Carol&#x27;s Daughter&#x27;s version, but the ingredient list wasn&#x27;t necessarily on my natural product path.  Carol&#x27;s daughter had great ingredients ....this lead me to trying Cream of Nature&#x27;s Argan oil. I used it last night on a curlformer set, and sat under the dryer for just ten minutes before I went to bed with them still in my hair (it was late when I finished and I wanted to help with the excess wetness).  The curls were firm and defined, with no crispiness.  I&#x27;m not experiencing flaking either.  The smell is fantastic and the ingredients included many natural ingredients that facilitate maintaining moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think some of the more negative reviews had unrealistic expectations for this product.  I will continue to use this product, especially at the price point of about $6.  If I experience flaking or dryness I will be sure to update this review.</li>
    <li> Really love this product, will buy more</li>
    <li> I was excited about using this wrapping lotion because I wanted to not use a hair dryer on my natural hair after washing. So I used it last night and took my hair down and all I see are white flakes and my hair is a frizzy mess. I&#x27;m disappointed because I thought this would be the answers to my stopping with the hair dryer. This morning I am going to have to cowash my hair with conditioner to get the flakes out. Maybe this is a product only for permed hair. I give this a 0 based off my usage.</li>
    <li> This has been one of the very few products that will allow my hair to curl without the frizz. LOVE it and the price is so reasonable too!</li>
    <li> Good wrapping lotion.</li>
    <li> Ok. I didn&#x27;t bother trying it out. I originally bought it to use on my bundles, but i don&#x27;t need it so I can&#x27;t really comment on whether or not it works. sorry</li>
    <li> i would recommend this product to anyone interested in a great foaming wrap. the item came 2 days after I placed order. smells great and hold awesome curls.</li>
    <li> NOT too crazy about this stuff , it is really really stiff , must use with a REALLY good oil - only good for roller sets and dont be fooled by how it says OIL on the bottle - it leaves you almost completely dry without oil</li>
    <li> Feels great on my hair</li>
    <li> This product is amazing fot my.wash n gos using the shingling method. I.have tried other products that left my hair shrunken n residue but not this evrn of u use a lot u will not have residue my natural curls set beautifully they are sof n bouncy. I have gotten so many compliments on my hair w this product. Your Hair doesn&#x27;t have to dripping wet either. I co wash my hair n towel dried n it came out great. No neef to sit under the dryer it drys fast n leave hair looking good for the week.</li>
    <li> This wrap foam is lightweight. No strong odors. It absorbs into the hair very quickly. After unwrapping, hair has a nice sheen, is soft, and smooth. Absolutely, no \\&quot;crunchy\\&quot; hair. If using a flat  or curling iron, the hair will curl or further straighten very quickly.   This product is easily found at most local drugstores and beauty supply stores for  approximately 7 bucks.  If you purchase from some sellers you&#x27;re only paying about 1. more to get it to your door.  It may be worth the convenience.</li>
    <li> Creme of Nature Argan products work very well with natural hair styles.</li>
    <li> Great for setting relaxed hair whether with rollers, twistouts, braid outs. It provides great shine, moisture, and definition. I really love it. Used it for 3 years</li>
    <li> I recently \\&quot;big-chopped\\&quot; after transitioning for one year.  My go-to style during transition and after, has been the bantu-knot-out. This is the first setting lotion I tried, and it definitely holds the hair and gives it some shine.  The only issue is it leaves the hair a little crunchy and sticky, leading to breakage especially at the ends.  I noticed this even more so after I big chopped and had more texture at the ends.  I have since switched to a different product that is cheaper and gives me much better results.</li>
    <li> I have tried many other brands of foam wrap lotion. This is by far one of the better products out there. My hair tends to be on the dryer side. But after using this lotion, my hair is moisturized and looks much healthier. The fragrance is not too strong, very refreshing. From now on, this is my go-to product for wash and set styles.</li>
    <li> Crème of Nature Argan Oil Style  for Hair is great</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, it flakes. I&#x27;m already bald, can&#x27;t be bald and flaky. I would advise to go for their gel, it&#x27;s a better product.</li>
    <li> This product left my hair feeling extremely crunchy brittle and dry with an odd film like substance. Im currently transitioning and needed a holding aide for my curls and twist outs. This was not helpful at all. Not on dry, wet or damp hair. I used half a bottle before finally giving up because I wanted to try and like it but it was not meant to be.</li>
    <li> I really love this. It worked perfectly on my natural hair. I am black and my hair is natural has to be done and this product is perfect. If you want to see how i use the product watch my youtube video and subscribe, if you have any question ask me on the comment section, youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;AIaSEf4ovn0</li>
