<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Super fast delivery.  Product as described</li>
    <li> Muy teeth are white already and it&#x27;s been a week</li>
    <li> This product has been very satisfactory. It works very well...better than any  have used previously.</li>
    <li> I just used it in my second day and I can see a good results already, just be carefull on not touch your tongue with it cause it kind of hurt.</li>
    <li> This product worked great! I used 3/4 of the syringe and my teeth were toilet bowl white in a week. Just make sure when you use it to place just a dot in the molded tray use your gums don&#x27;t become to sensitive to the bleach. If some squirts out just wipe it off. Two thumbs up!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical to order this product from the USA, but it&#x27;s similar to the product my dentist is selling. The only difference is the unbeatable price there. 3-4 weeks was the specified delivery time. So I was really impressed when 2 weeks after ordering the package arrived.&lt;br /&gt;Read the user instructions and follow their directions! If you use too much gel or exceed the contact time your gums and teeth get sensitive.</li>
    <li> These r definitely strong, so strong that I wonder if I&#x27;m seriously harming my teeth by using it.....I got a whitening light to go with it but I&#x27;m honestly too scared to try it. I have only used this 2 times and I do notice that my teeth are lighter.</li>
    <li> I was hoping that this product would work as well as the initial gel I got from the dentist when I had a professional whitening treatment. It does--and is much less expensive!</li>
    <li> Works FANTASTIC...and since I&#x27;ve been bleaching my teeth for many years and understand how sometimes there is sensitivity, this particular product gave me none at all.</li>
    <li> After one use there was a notable whitening of my teeth. The product is easy to use and very effective.</li>
    <li> Wow, huge tubes! You would normally get the same qty of one of these tubes in a name brand set, AND you&#x27;d pay twice as much. Its the same product, just package generically. This is probably how a dentist office received the stuff. This is a good buy and I recommend it.</li>
    <li> have purchased before...product is as expected... a lot of treatments</li>
    <li> Is a bit harsh on gums and doesn&#x27;t whiten as much as the description states.</li>
    <li> It seems to work ok but I think It was stored under the correct temperature because it doesn&#x27;t work as good as previous orders.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery and great price!</li>
    <li> While this may be a good product, personally I do not like it. I have been using whiteing products for years. I was a dental assistant for 6 years. Whit this product on the first use (only 10 min) I end up with bunch of discoloration. I am very dissapointed!</li>
    <li> so far so good, its been a month and ive used it about 7 times... i&#x27;d say my teeth have moved up about 3 shades. ( i do use a LED light for teeth)</li>
    <li> It works but it burns.</li>
    <li> I am so happy that this came in. The product is better then the dental oofice. I will be buying more</li>
    <li> Get works fine with my dental tray, only thing can’t use it daily or even every other day for no more than 20 minutes. This gel is very strong, got my teeth whiter at the expense of burning my gums.</li>
    <li> And a little goes a LONG way. I&#x27;m still on my first syringe, after about five uses. I have fitted trays, and only fill in the front eight or so teeth wells halfway. I used it every couple of days for 15 to 30 minutes, and saw a noticeable difference in my teeth. I tried using it two days in a row, and my gums got pretty sore on day two. I use Sensodyne toothpaste daily, and remineralization gel after bleaching so my teeth feel fine. There is no way to keep the bleach from touching your gums, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend daily use. My teeth are naturally yellow, so they will never be white-white, but this fixes my coffee staining.</li>
    <li> Work really will... My teeth is much whiter then before.. Thank you so much</li>
    <li> Wonderful. Got lots of gel for cheap!</li>
    <li> i just used the product for the second time and it burns like crazy. My gums temporarily turned white and were bleeding in some areas. I am going to try to use less product and see if it&#x27;s not as painful, but I didn&#x27;t think I was using more than directed in the trays.</li>
    <li> I started whitening with a 22% solution.  Followed with this 35% solution.  I do question the strength of the product as I have not had problem with solution on my gums for extended period, like others.  I have used for 26 treatments of at least 30 minutes, and the results have been dramatic.</li>
    <li> These things suck. Now I know why they&#x27;re so cheap 9$ for 4. I rather spend 75$ for just one at the dentist.</li>
    <li> Works well and even better than other similar whitening gels I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Noticeable change even from first use</li>
    <li> Does exactly as promised, unlike many items. Very strong and works from the first application. Shame I have to buy from the USA as the product is now banned from the uk market.</li>
    <li> Omg after 3 treatments, my teeth are PURE white!!!! Excellent!!!!</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed with this product, as it did not whiten my teeth.  I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> The price and strength were just what I was looking for--just started using it, so am cautiously optimistic about returning to a bright white smile!!</li>
    <li> Totally works. ..but ouch my teeth and gums hurt.</li>
    <li> The bleach is super strong....I couldn&#x27;t leave it on my teeth for more than 5 minutes because it burned my gums. Not sure if this percentage is good for my teeth, so I threw mine out. Can&#x27;t tell if it works, because it is too painful to keep on.</li>
    <li> Pretty strong - don&#x27;t need to leave on too long, or teeth will get sensitive.</li>
    <li> This gel works well!  Even after being in the fridge for a while.  I had started out with what the dentist gave me, not as strong or fresh, and after a while it stopped working.  I am seeing progress again with this gel  It is strong though, so be careful not to get it on your gums if possible because it will burn.  But extremely effective, and cuts bleaching time in half.</li>
    <li> I have purchases opalescence before and it worked much better. Don&#x27;t know if this solution was old but have used this a few times and see no results</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product for a short time but my teeth have whitened up already. I should have a dazzling smile in a few more weeks.</li>
    <li> great deal! definitly a strong whitener, i can&#x27;t use it often because me teeth are very sensitive after.</li>
    <li> Great product great value and its not to strong that it makes the teeth sensitive.I will continue to use  Thx</li>
    <li> This is so great, it really works! Easy to use, and I do not have those trays it suggests.</li>
    <li> Good product for the price your paying...but no quality. The gel gets too foamy its almost impossible to leave in for more than five minutes because it foams out of your bleach tray. Comes with giant tubes but haven&#x27;t got to see much of a whitening difference because I can hardly leave it in. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many off the shelf teeth whitening systems in the past.  From $10 - $50.  But they never seemed to work.  They also hurt and take many treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this whitening gel was so inexpensive I thought I would try again.  I&#x27;m so glad I did!  My teeth haven&#x27;t been this white in a very long time.  They look great.  I&#x27;m so happy and slightly surprised such an inexpensive product works so well.  I didn&#x27;t realize how big the tubes were so I purchased two sets.  As well as this stuff works I&#x27;m set for a while.  I have them stored in the fridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 twenty minute &amp; 2 thirty minute treatments (one tube) and my teeth look fantastic.  I recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> Tried it twice and no complaints..works great and you get large syringes for a fraction of the cost that the dentist charges.</li>
    <li> The syringes seem to hold more product that the previous syringes I purchased from dentists.  Be warned, unless you are accustomed to using stronger bleach, your mouth may be sensitive after using.  I&#x27;ve been  using bleach with custom trays for a number of years; with this bleach I don&#x27;t leave it in longer than 30 or 40 minutes.  Really helps whiten your actual teeth (not caps, etc.).  Glad I found this product!!!</li>
    <li> Works fine, great price. Why pay more.  I had no problems with burning. The material came easily out of most of the tubes. One or two would get clogged. I fix that by pulling the plunger back once or twice and then it works fine.</li>
    <li> The product does a great job, my teeth look amazing. Warning do not leave it longer than suggested your teeth will hurt!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product a few months ago and I must say it works great if you do a light coating of the job I do not have any pain or bleaching of the gum I do have extremely sensitive teeth and the fact that this product does not cause me any pain is amazing I&#x27;ve tried white strips in the past and I did get shooting pains from those I would highly recommend this product and I will definitely fight against my teeth look great</li>
    <li> I did not know what to expect.  However this product works very well.  My teeth improved by several shades the first application.  Do yourself a favor, do not use to much gel with each application.</li>
    <li> Be careful. This is strong stuff. Don&#x27;t use more than listed.</li>
    <li> This product works wonderfully!!!</li>
    <li> Caused gum irritation. Didn&#x27;t whiten as well as I had hoped. Applicator tip needed to be small to inject into my tray. Use to much and you&#x27;ll know it right away.</li>
    <li> The seller communicated very accurately &amp; well.&lt;br /&gt;The shipping was well on time.&lt;br /&gt;My order looked exactly as the product that was being sold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(It came greatly packaged with instructions and a teeth color guide)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The syringes were NOT properly sealed (But instead had a pull off removeable cap)&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a very strong 35% whitening agent (Which tortur and burn your gums!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;THIS PRODUCT HARDLY WHITENED MY TEETH EVENLY after 30 applications - It took my teeth from a medium yellow to a lighter yellow!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not totally convinced or satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank You</li>
    <li> This gave me a 4 shades...i got a yellow teeth and now it is pretty showing the progress.worth the price</li>
    <li> Worth the money and whitens teeth well.  Use sparingly as it cannot get on your gums as it will burn.  If u feel the burning just have to take the mouth tray out and wait a few days to start again. DO NOT let the burning continue as it will damage your gums and bruise them.  A little goes a long way and I plan on buying more.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Works very well. The best I&#x27;ve ever had so far. Thank you Amazon.your the best, and oh your prices.</li>
    <li> These whitening gels are great! They work just the same as gels provided from my dentist and I am very glad I got them. I recommend using them for 20 minutes, avoiding gel on your gums. Also make sure your have had a cleaning at the dentist recently to avoid uneven coloring! If you follow those steps you will see amazing results!</li>
    <li> Have only used once.  Does a fine enough job.</li>
    <li> The syringes arrived on time, in good condition, and as described.  The gel is easy to maneuver into dental trays.  Increasing from, say, 15 or 20 up to 35% makes for quicker whitening; I noticed a difference after the first whitening with this particular gel.  Do be careful not to allow gel onto the gums.  To limit sensitivity, I usually whiten 1-2 hours with the upper tray one day, then 1-2 hours with the lower tray the next, then continue alternating for a couple weeks.  At 35%, I do not keep the trays in overnight.  Syringes can be kept in the fridge to prolong shelf life.  This was at an excellent price and I would order again.</li>
    <li> Works fine good whitening good price good quality</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! Shipping was very fast and the syringes were much larger than I expected. I use to pay $300 at my dentist for teeth whitening and I decided to try this and saw results immediately. Definitely recommend this and I will certainly buy again. I saw results after the first use as an avid wine drinker and smoker this product made a huge difference.</li>
    <li> Burned the crap out of my gums...just saying.  Make sure you use just a little bit or it&#x27;ll irritate your gums.</li>
    <li> It definitely makes your teeth whiter but don&#x27;t leave it on too long! My gums started to bleed after 10 minutes</li>
    <li> I used entire product as described but don&#x27;t notice any change. Its a lot of work for nothing. I do not smoke. I do drink coffee</li>
    <li> It burned so bad I washed it off after 3 minutes. It&#x27;s impossible to only keep it on your teeth without it touching your gums. In 3 minutes time it turned my gums white. I could hardly eat for two days. Such a let down.</li>
    <li> My teeth were badly discolored, but this teeth whitening gel works!  It is strong and will burn your gums if it comes in contact with them.  Will be ordering more product if available.</li>
    <li> When used as directed this product really does a nice job in whitening your teeth at a fraction of the cost if done by a dentist.</li>
    <li> For the price my expectations were not high regarding what would actually arrive in the mail but figured for the cost of 35% gel at the dentist office ($80) it was worth a shot. I must say I was very impressed with the speed of delivery and the quality of this gel. It is as advertised and you get enough to last for years. I am part way through the first tube and my teeth are about 4 shades whiter already. Its potent gel and gets the job done. Couldn&#x27;t ask for better value or quality from this product.</li>
    <li> Even after using this for about 2-3 weeks, I didn&#x27;t really notice a big difference in the shade of my teeth. It did manage to burn my gums a few times though... Not fun.</li>
    <li> Bought for a gift.&lt;br /&gt;Was told that it works alright.&lt;br /&gt;The light made no difference.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me.  Didn&#x27;t bubble, so I bet it was expired.  I&#x27;m trying the carbamide 35%,  Just ordered it today.  Even though the hydrogen peroxide is supposed to be stronger with shorter wear time,  it doesn&#x27;t last as long as the carbamide, so I&#x27;ve read. So I will give the CP 35% a try (even though I also read its made with urea!) I want white teeth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried several brands,  so this review will be found elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Results are impressive but the product really, really, really stings my gums.</li>
    <li> Okay so I forgot to order the trays for this. So I used a cotton ball, cut it in half and rolled it long enough to put between my lip and gums. I carefully put the gel on my teef with a cotton swap. As others suggested go slow, I managed to do 15mins with no spillage to my gums. I think it&#x27;s worth my $9. its a great buy and you do get a lot of product. the syringes are filled with about 2 1/2 inches (guesstimate) x 1/2 width (about the size of my toothbrush). my teef are half a shade lighter after one use. Slow progress but definitely working!!!!</li>
    <li> I have used other teeth whitening gels, but this one seems to be more gentle and less harsh and others I&#x27;ve used. no burning of the gums and little tooth sensitivity.  It also has a slight lemon flavor that make is less gross when it gets in your mouth.  So far happy with the results after just 3 applications.</li>
    <li> Love these whitening gels.They are a wonderful addition to an original whitening kit for teeth.The original kit obviously does not contain enough  gel for continued use . I hate looking at folks in any setting with dirty brown teeth,especially as we become geriatric. No excuse for that today.I drink a lot of coffee,and or tea,which also contributes to discoloration of teeth. I recommend these refills as a good remedy to whiten up those teeth and as a supplement to the kits.</li>
    <li> This is an exceptional  product and works just like what I was purchasing from my Dentist. Very satisfied with my purchase!</li>
    <li> This stuff seems to be professional but I didn&#x27;t notice the rapid improvement I expected. And my teacher not that badly stained. Still I think it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
    <li> No stars!  I had read the reviews and they were all raving, so I decided to give it a go.  I received the product and was very surprise to find that the syringes are not sealed.  You simply just tug at the cap on the end of it and you&#x27;re ready to go,  I was very uncomfortable with this as you don&#x27;t know who / what was responsible for putting that cap on.  Not tamper proof, in other words, this is not at all a sophisticted, sterile operation.  (A product for your teeth. Really??) Did these people wash their hands, wear gloves?  Was a little creepy.  Next, there are no instructions as to how frequently you should use the produt.  It does recommend only 20 min at at time, but again, frequency is not addressed.  When the gel meets the gums or gets on the roof of your mouth, look out.  Pain, burning is excruciating. EXCRUTIATING!!  It is extremely caustic.  Turned the room of my mouth directly behind the front teeth completely white !  Ouch.  Had to stop and end sessions early.  Lastly, after approx 6 treatments, I found that my teeth were starting to yellow.  Yes, you heard it, YELLOW.  They became very sensitive too.  I checked on line, and it certainly is true that if the tooth enamel is gone, you teeth will be more sensitive and they show stains more.  I realized this product is so caustic, it eroded my enamel....very angry and would NEVER buy.  Guess I&#x27;m outnumbered though, so you decide.</li>
    <li> Very strong stuff. Stronger than the dentist&#x27;s and can irritated gums if left on too long.</li>
    <li> This is one of the great products Ive bought on Amazon. Quick delivery, syringes are huge for under $10??!! I live in Hollywood and your teeth have to be white. I usually spend about $60 for 4 or 5 skinny syringes with bleach in it that is standard but weak. Typically I wear teeth molds with bleach in for 1/2 nights sleep. And NEVER have my teeth come out as white as with this stuff in 15 minutes! I know dentists would say its too strong, but all the brushing Ive done with toothpaste brands that gaurentee 3 shades lighter in a week, plus the backing soda and brushing my teeth twice a day, cant be much better than 15 minutes of this stuff once a week!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been working great for me for months. I&#x27;ve tried it expensive gels and this works just as well. Ps ill buy again!</li>
    <li> This is a great product for your money however if any of it leaks out of the tray it tastes awful!</li>
    <li> Got stains? Get them out! THis stuff whitened my teeth faster with one tube than that expensive stuff from the doc did.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased bleach refills several times now and they all work as good as the next as long as the percentages are the same.  Now I just shop by price and quantity.  I keep them refrigerated until use and they work great.  Told my dentist when he tried to sell me more and he was not happy.</li>
    <li> All tooth gel whiteners are the same and this does the job and is safe. Plus for $10, you can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
    <li> Not noticing much of a difference, and it tastes terrible.</li>
    <li> I usually use 15-20 % solutions and thought I&#x27;d try something stronger, and maybe quicker?The gel that oozed out of my trays at the top Burned my mouth. I tried to keep them in a while and just deal with it, thinking it might be the initial burning, that would get better.  Big mistake. My mouth is just recovering, 3-4 weeks later. I went though a sore scab-like feel and then peeling.&lt;br /&gt;If it burn,s at all take it out right away!&lt;br /&gt;In the end it didn&#x27;t even whiten any better.</li>
    <li> Grwat value! Do the job.</li>
    <li> Use to buy these off Ebay, but thought &amp;#34;hey, I get everything else here&amp;#34;. So I ordered. I don&#x27;t have to use them very often, every few months I guess or when I just think I have lost some whiteness from coffee or whatever. People always remark about my teeth and ask if I use whitestrips. No, I don&#x27;t, but I do use..... : )</li>
    <li> I bought this because I read such great reviews on it. However, when I got it in the mail there were no instructions on how to use it at all. I didn&#x27;t know what to do with them. To this day, it is still sitting in the envelope it came in.</li>
    <li> not your fault- but burns/sores on my mouth when i have used this product&lt;br /&gt;had to throw it out- just can&#x27;t use it&lt;br /&gt;have bleached my teeth for years never this type of problem&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but not your fault</li>
    <li> This was a great price, strong strength.  It works.  There are no expiration dates, that I could tell, but when using them I can tell you there&#x27;s pretty fresh.  They will burn the hell out of you if you&#x27;re not careful.  If you have sensitive teeth go with a weaker strength.  After 7 days of use my teeth are noticeably white, really white.  Others have talked about a grittiness but I didn&#x27;t have a problem.  I&#x27;ve bought name brand bleaching gel on Amazon and these are just as good, even better than some.  They will have no effect on your crowns so if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re aiming for you&#x27;re out of luck.</li>
    <li> I do like the 35% but do wish I could go stronger without increasing sensitivity.  Unfortunately genetics play a role in how far one&#x27;s whitening will go at least with this type of whitener.  Laser/light? who knows, but for an inexpensive whitener this will do!  This was the 1st time I went to 35%, up from 22%, and did not experience but only mild sensitivity that was only temporary and only after about a week and a half.  Can&#x27;t beat the price, plus I have a syringe left over for a touch up later.  Oh, this was the 1st time whitening in a year (had been hydro-pyroxiding/baking soda every other day).  Planning on every 6 mos. whitening, I have stubborn teeth, but do not smoke or drink a lot of coffee or tea.  Again genetics has the final say.  HP w/baking soda every other day is part of my dental hygiene but will whiten every 6 mos. so hopefully I won&#x27;t need to go at Most 2 weeks, starts getting pretty old after that.</li>
    <li> it does the job at a fraction of the price a dentist would charge..the mouth trays that you buy at the store are a little less than optimal even when you customize them but overall they work just fine.</li>
    <li> The graphics on the page are confusing, so I thought I&#x27;d clarify. The tubes are the XXL ones -- not the small ones you typically see. This is a fantastic product and the price is unbeatable. Mine shipped from NYC and I had it in days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  I&#x27;ve used other bleaches before, and this one is AMAZING!! It really gets your teeth white quickly. It&#x27;s powerful, so I&#x27;ve taken to carefully wiping my gums off immediately after putting my trays in to avoid the bleached-out gum thing, and I spit often while the trays are in (EEW!!!! but still better than swallowing peroxide!).  Totally worth the investment.</li>
    <li> It made my teeth slightly whiter right after I took the trays out but it&#x27;s a very subtle difference in the long run.</li>
    <li> This was a great deal! My only problem with it is that it&#x27;s kind of runny and tends to come out of the mold while in your mouth, and it tastes terrible! When you take the mold out of your mouth, no gel is remaining in it and you wonder exactly how much was on your teeth and for how long.</li>
    <li> Absolutely works great on my coffee and tobacco teeth.  Product has brightened my teeth better than expected.</li>
    <li> So far slow in working.  Vile tasting!  I have used Opalesence for years, both the melon &amp; the mint.  The price of this doesn&#x27;t make up for the awful taste.  I have been using my dentist trays.  I may try the heat &amp; mold to see if the product stays put bettet.</li>
    <li> This stuff burns like hell if you get it on your gums. It also turns your gums white for awhile if it gets on them. I do not recommend it.</li>
    <li> Works really well to whiten teeth.  Be careful to avoid the gums or you will turn them white, which is ok because they go back to normal, but it stings and makes them sensitive.  The directions are clear about this, so no docking of points.  Great product to use in my trays!</li>
    <li> This teeth whitening gel works great. It can save you a good amount of money compared to a professional dentist but delivers the same quality of results.</li>
    <li> very fast shipment. Have used product several times and it has made a significant difference.  Be careful not to use it for an extended (more than the recommended 15-20 minutes) time as it will make your teeth extremely sensitive.</li>
    <li> These came promptly, were a great price and were much stronger than the ones i had ordered previously..... and of larger quantity to boot. would definitely order again.</li>
    <li> Great item last a long time!</li>
    <li> I went to the dentist to get a new upper denture and when it was delivered the color was a few shades lighter than my natural bottom theeth.  I used this every day for a week and now there&#x27;s no difference and looks natural</li>
    <li> Threw them out..hurt my teeth....</li>
    <li> This product bbc ir pretty good.. careful with amount in trays and time in between bleaching. Cause tingling to gums and starts to whiten the gum area</li>
    <li> WAY TOO STRONG!  I could not keep it on my teeth for more than a few minutes.  Would not buy this again.</li>
    <li> Just as promised with a quick delivery and quality product!</li>
    <li> Absolutely brightened my smile.  However, if left on too long the whitening will be uneven.  The unevenness goes away after a couple of days.  Each syringe is good for about ten uses for both upper and lower.  So this purchase would be good for at least forty treatments, well over a years supply.  If your mouth is sensitive this formula is probably not for you; perhaps 22% is better.</li>
    <li> Tastes TERRIBLE. By far the worst tasting bleach I&#x27;ve ever used. Burns the gums and tongue. That said, it does whiten teeth. Great price but next time I&#x27;m spending a little more on flavored stuff.</li>
    <li> You have to be careful with peroxide, because it&#x27;s caustic, but I find that a little bit of this stuff works well. I am not using it every day, because I don&#x27;t wan&#x27;t to mess up my enamel, but it has worked really well for surface stains.</li>
    <li> Works great to whitening the teeth.  I&#x27;ve been these type of products for over 6 years and have never had a problem.</li>
    <li> feels like baking powder with vinegar.... foam explosion in my mouth</li>
    <li> Good bleaching action. I use it everyday and have see results right away. Would recommend this product to anyone who wants great results.</li>
    <li> This whitening bleach hurt my teeth! I use a fluoride rinse on a regular basis which helps with sensitivity and this stuff still caused pain. If it touches your gums, same thing. Tons of pain. I stopped using after half a tube. I&#x27;ll stick with dentist office stuff.</li>
    <li> This works very well. Be sure to use this along with a remineralizer. Otherwise you&#x27;ll have beautifully white, yet sensitive teeth. Please also follow the instructions so as not to end up with sore gums.</li>
    <li> Foams up like crazy and brunt my gums</li>
    <li> Product is very very strong.</li>
    <li> love this product  works great and fast</li>
    <li> Fast working. Excellent product</li>
    <li> The tubes were 4 of them, and they were WAY bigger than I thought they were. The dentist I got my custom trays from wanted $25 for 1/2 the size of ONE tube. So if you&#x27;re debating buying, I highly recommend this product. Amazing!</li>
    <li> Big tubes, works fast. Be sure and wipe off excess that squeezes out to avoid getting temporary burns or irritation on your gums; This stuff is strong.</li>
    <li> I really liked this teeth whitening get because it was a lot better than what i expected. I got these when there was a sale on Amazon and it was a VERY good discount. I can notice a little bit of a difference after a couple days of using the gel on my teeth. this brand of bleaching gel caused me absolutely no sensitivity and burning. However, the reason i gave it only four stars was because the shade guide was confusing as to what it was for. I also caution people who use this with bleaching trays to cut it so it doesn&#x27;t get on your gums. If it gets on your gums, it could maybe cause it to burn.</li>
    <li> It does work, but I cannot use it because it makes me gag... Very horrid taste... If you are not a wimp and the desire for white teeth trump your gag reflex, it does do the job.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t get product out of the tube. It had so many hard pieces in the gel that I couldn&#x27;t even fill one tray without having to unclog it. Would not recommend</li>
    <li> Works well, as advertised, if you drink Coffee tea or are from an area that has stain causing substances in the water (England) then this is for you!</li>
    <li> This teeth whitening product same to be working well for me, but then again I am a devoted visitor of the dentist for cleanings so I guess that assisted in the results that I got as well. I don&#x27;t smoke nor do I drink wines, and I brush and floss all the time so I would attribute all of these measures to helping out with this bleaching process. My teeth have gone from pearl white to the whitest I have seen if a professional was doing it. I would recommend this whitening agent for consideration as a teeth bleaching regime.</li>
    <li> I used this teeth bleaching gel with custom fitted (dentist-made) trays and saw no difference.  I have fairly white teeth and just drink one cup of coffee in the mornings as well as cranberry juice a few times a week.  I like to try to maintain or lighten regularly so that my teeth never get a stained look to them.  I did not even see one difference in shade.  My Mom also used this same gel (custom fitted trays) as well and was not able to see a difference.  Since I bought some for both of us, I was curious as to her opinion and was hoping she had better luck than I did.  It could be that the product itself was old or just not strong enough.  I did notice a few comments where people had problems using this due to sensitivity.  It is hard for me to wrap my mind around that one.  I have used whitening products over the years (usually professional strength) that did in fact cause some gun or tooth sensitivity while using them.  -The only difference was, they whitened my teeth dramatically.  I will deal with some sensitivity if a product actually works.  In this case, no sensitivity and no whitening whatsoever.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend this. Works as advertised for a good price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Careful not to use too much as it will burn your gums.</li>
    <li> great product. shipped well. xx dd dd dd dd dd dd dd dd dd dd dd dd d d d</li>
    <li> Love this product and a very good deal.</li>
    <li> This product has the whitening agent concentrated at 35%. This is what is needed to whiten teeth quickly. The 4 syringes are more that enough for one series of whitening. Good value</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product.  Gave one to my friend who liked it as well.  A good deal indeed.</li>
    <li> it has some crystals in it that I don&#x27;t like against my teeth. Otherwise, it whitens ok but I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and works fabulously!&lt;br /&gt;Works best if you already have custom made trays.</li>
    <li> Definitely whitens but very unpleasant to have in, especially if you get a taste of it. Yuck! My advice is start slow and don&#x27;t use a lot. They&#x27;re BIG syringes and will last you a long time!</li>
    <li> This stuff works! No using it fifteen times and exposing your gums to solar flares. Use it once and you will see a difference. If you have one of those tooth molds the dentist uses, so much the better. But basically, put it on... wait a bit, and will get whiter teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice to see stuff that is cheap and works...</li>
    <li> this whitener works well, like other 35% gel i&#x27;ve used in past. It&#x27;s easy to use. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend says he has noticed a difference. I use this about twice a week for 10 minutes each. There is no irritability if you don&#x27;t put a lot in the mouth piece.</li>
    <li> Be careful not to get ripped off by your dentist. They normally give you a small dosage of the teeth whitening gel so that you have to keep coming back for more and more and it takes a long time two whiten your teeth. My dentist offered me the same whitening gel for an in house visit at around $200. Amazon&#x27;s price eight dollars.</li>
    <li> The gel works as advertised and as others have said this is strong whitening agent so I only leave it on for 20 minutes while I shower in the morning. I would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I smoked for many years (quit, but the damage was done), and drink quite a bit of coffee, so I&#x27;ve wanted to whiten my teeth for years. I&#x27;d only used a drugstore type whitening system in the past - Rembrandt - and of course I&#x27;d used several whitening toothpastes and mouthwashes. I have never achieved a noticeable difference with any of these products. This method - using a strong bleaching compound for short (15 minute) sessions - has yielded much more noticeable results. The kit includes a chart to log your before and after colors. Hold the chart up next to your mouth while standing at the mirror - find the color that matches you - then after using the compound, check again. The first time I moved 4 gradients whiter, and the second time I moved two more. Considering where I started, and the fact that I still drink coffee regularly, I&#x27;m very happy with that amount of whitening. I&#x27;m concerned about enamel damage, so I committed to only doing 15 minutes every month, now that I&#x27;ve achieved a whiter smile. I didn&#x27;t not perform exhaustive research on the safety of the product - though I did read a few reviews by dental hygienists who say that this is the same product used by dentists - so I&#x27;d never suggest using it with reckless abandon. But at this price, I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t pay my dentist $500 for the first two treatments and my &amp;#34;personalized&amp;#34; trays. I used my own trays from the $20 Rembrandt treatment and for a few dollars more I finally have the smile I&#x27;d hoped for.</li>
    <li> Whitens but doesn&#x27;t keep up with the white. You have to keep doing it. Sucks, but still works for temporary things. Also hurts gums kinda. No biggie, unless you&#x27;re a wuss.</li>
    <li> if you are looking for whitening this is the stuff. The cost was great. This is better than the stuff I have previously bought from my Dentist. Be careful to keep it on your teeth and not your gums. I put the stuff on my finger and rub it on my teeth and then put the mouth piece in. It works well with my molded mouth piece which I had made at the Dentist. I don&#x27;t know how well it will work without the molded mouth piece.</li>
    <li> Waaaay too strong! Burned my gums really bad after just a minute! Seriously don&#x27;t try these, they are way too strong!</li>
    <li> 18 year old girl with slight yellowing due to coffee and cigarette smoking once and awhile. Works the first time you use it. Doesn&#x27;t even hurt my gums much but kinda makes them feel raw after. Your teeth feel weird after for a few minutes but it doesn&#x27;t last. Way way better than Crest Whitening strips. I used those before prom for a month and this gel does more in just one day. Use for 20 minutes in a mouth guard. Very very much recommend.</li>
    <li> What a great price and effective. Just like my other bleach gels I paid double the price for</li>
    <li> Great item and a fantastic deal!</li>
    <li> After having bleaching trays made at my dentist&#x27;s office, I thought I&#x27;d save money by ordering whitening gel on line.  I was disappointed in the consistency of the gel and the size of the opening in the syringe. This gel was much thinner than the product I got from the dentist and I found it hard to get just the right amount in the trays so it wouldn&#x27;t ooze out and burn my gums. Does the product work, yes. Will I purchase this particular brand again, probably not.</li>
    <li> You can see why a dentist would normally use this -- if left too long on your gums, it can bleach and burn them. If you have professional trays, this is an excellent use for them.  Just keep it to 5-10 minutes.  And don&#x27;t even think about using it overnight. The results are as good as the $350-$750 charged by the pros. Although they&#x27;d make sure your teeth are clean and can benefit from this the best.  But if your teeth are clean, this is the way to go. If you&#x27;re currently using the 3-10 percent stuff overnight, stop.  Get this.</li>
    <li> This stuff is STRONG! I have sensitive teeth and usually stick with the 22%. I bought this for some of my patients to try and ending up using one myself. I also bought the remineralization gel (ie flouride) and it helped a TON! I used this once, and went up a shade or two! Each time afterwards I used the remineralization gel and where normally just breathing hurts me after a whitening treatment, the remin. gel made it MUCH better faster. I was still a bit sensitive but nothing like what i would have expected jumping to this industrial strength stuff. If you want quick results and if you get sensitivity no matter what percetage you use, and/or you just want it to work fast, try this item with the remineralization gel! It&#x27;s quick and works!</li>
    <li> I bought this without reading the product description properly and didn&#x27;t realize it doesn&#x27;t come with trays. This is not the first time that my lack of reading has caused me to suffer, but I have yet to learn my lesson. Anyway, I decided to just apply this onto my teeth using a q-tip and smile so big my lips don&#x27;t touch my teeth and hope for the best. I can only smile so long so I only made it a minute or 2 but in that time I did notice my teeth are a little lighter. The taste isn&#x27;t horrid as others have said, at least not in the small amount I used. Obviously its a chemical solution so it&#x27;s not going to taste *good* but it wasn&#x27;t vile. I also did not have any gum sensitivity but I would attribute that to the fact that I applied it directly to my teeth. I give it 4 starts because the directions it came with were a little unclear. Overall, great product</li>
    <li> Very powererful stuff.  You can probably get something with a little less %  But if you are short of time and need a quick &amp;#34;SMILE&amp;#34; this stuff works great.</li>
    <li> This product really works! It does tend to tingle a little but not as bad as other reviews have made it seem. I totally noticed the difference in just a few days</li>
    <li> Only use a little, it can burn your gums it&#x27;s so strong...but in 2 nights my teeth were Hollywood white after 1 year of not whitening. Works very fast.</li>
    <li> Need to use as directed. Have seen a good improvement.</li>
    <li> does what it says. super fast shipping. you can rely on this seller. have tried several other products but this seems the most promising.</li>
    <li> I was a little worried knowing that it was a strong product but it is very useful! I have whitened my teeth for years with Crest strips &amp; was delighted to see the same results for much much less with this product. I have used the gel with my mouth guard thing from another product (to keep my &amp;#34;smiling teeth&amp;#34; exposed) as the use of my clear retainers &amp; store bought mouth piece caused the product to sit on my gums and burn them. With careful application and consistent use of at least one week then you should be a happy camper with a lovely smile</li>
    <li> I am a Registered Dental Assistant and this bleach is just as good as the high priced bleaches at dental offices!  I noticed significant whitening after only 3 days</li>
    <li> Tingles but works great!</li>
    <li> It whiten my teeth but it burns my gum, so if you get it on your tongue sucks for you</li>
    <li> It works fine, if you actually use it.  I though I would but I don&#x27;t apply it nearly as often as I should.  My problem, not the bleach&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> great gel it came very clear with plenty of shelf life. i would suggest putting the stuff you wont use in a fridge to prolong it. also make sure the gel is clear and not a cloudy milky color if its not clear you have expired product and it wont whiten your teeth. also the shade guide with this product is not very good the teeth are two small on it  with tiny differences and you will have a hard time telling between shades on your teeth. if you are buying this and don&#x27;t yet have custom trays i would suggest looking into the trays made by sporting smiles they are great dentist quality trays for much less.</li>
    <li> god stuff.  wish it were stronger.</li>
    <li> This item didn&#x27;t do anything at all to my teeth, after days of use. Don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the product or the seller that I purchased it from. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again. Fortunately, it was an inexpensive lesson learned.</li>
    <li> This is a good product, and works as intended.  Sensitivity of teeth after use is minimal.  I have left on teeth for over an hour on occasion with no adverse affect.  Definite whitening!</li>
    <li> On point dental grade bleaching that truly does what it&#x27;s meant to do. I use it in my invisilgn retainers with such ease. Super satisfied and the tubes are UGE!! Ginormous. The price? Even better... Love love love this stuff.</li>
    <li> THIS ITEM IS AWESOME!!! After just a few minutes I could see a noticeable difference! No sensitivity either...GREAT VALUE HERE!!!</li>
    <li> This product is very effective but tough on the gums.  So I use it then skip a few days before using it again.  I do leave it on longer than the instructions say (about 40 minutes) as I noticed a huge difference, much more than using it for 20 minutes on 2 successive days.  Or at least, that is how it seemed to me, as illogical as it sounds.  I don&#x27;t know if this is related to the time it takes to break down the organic plugs in the enamel channels.</li>
    <li> I love this product and the price was unbelievable! I had got on the kick of whitening your teeth in the year of 1999 and 2000. The dentist made over $1000.00 on the molds and the bleach...and if I could take that back..I certainly would. I could not imagine being able to get the products on Amazon for the cheap rates that is on here for not only the molds but also the bleach...now less than $100.00. You will not disappointed and I highly recommend these products being sold on Amazon!</li>
    <li> I have only used it once so far but was pleased with the results</li>
    <li> Very effective, but it will sting a lot, so definitely rub Orajel or something like it all over your gums (the back too), and then you don&#x27;t feel a thing. I leave the bleach on 25 mins, then rinse and brush off the remainder and the Orajel. Very effective. Keep the bleach syringes in the fridge and they last a long time. I&#x27;ve had mine for about 8 months.</li>
    <li> Good product, works without making my teeth hurt. It tastes like orange oil to me, I don&#x27;t like the flavor, but it is a great value. 4 large syringes full, I don&#x27;t think I could ever use that much gel up. The last company I ordered from sent tiny syringes so I was surprised at how much product I received .</li>
    <li> I bought these and used some of one with my invisalign and they work great.  Its hard to keep this in for a long time since they are quite strong, but they do brighten you teeth a good amount, though you really have to use it multiple times to get the full effect.  I put the unused tubes into my spare fridge (which will make them last longer) and will re-apply when I need it.</li>
    <li> Bleh! You&#x27;d do better with trying hydrogen peroxide and baking soda. These sh@#&amp;iexcl;S don&#x27;t work. Plus, I felt like a user of substances every time I took out this syringe looking instrument. Felt illegal to me.</li>
    <li> Do not get the teeth as white as I had hoped.  But there is a lot of product.  Does show some improvement after use, but not as much as the tiny, expensive dentist sold product.  Okay but not great.</li>
    <li> This product is extremely gritty and thick.I used it for a month straight and didn&#x27;t see a difference in anything besides my gums that became extremely irritated.Its safe to say I will be purchasing all my future bleaching products from my dentist.</li>
    <li> Wonderful bleaching syringes.  There is no waste with the cap.  Does a wonderful job on whitening.  Will buy again and again.</li>
    <li> Great product, great price! It works fantastic. Enough said. Enjoy your pearly-white smile!</li>
    <li> It works ok but tastes really really terrible. Get a flavored gel instead</li>
    <li> Very strong agent be cautious how much you use and follow the instruction. Use this product for about 2 weeks until i started seeing results. My teeth now are whiter than a glass of milk. They make your teeth sensitive when you first use them other than that the sensation goes aways in a few days. You will love the results though. Great product!</li>
    <li> product works very well, but I havent noticed much of a color change also product is very sensitive if it gets on the gums. Other than that I am happy!</li>
    <li> One dab will do you. This works great love it and also I really mean great product!!!!</li>
    <li> Keep these refrigerated unless you use quickly.  Aging will drop effectiveness.  They work well and SS shipped very quickly.  Good product.</li>
    <li> Great price and a lot of product.  I have been using this gel on occasion for some time now.  It does the job very quickly and comes with screw on tops that prevent leakage of the product between uses.  I don&#x27;t mind that it is not a sweetened gel, but some people might.  It is not pleasant so be careful not to use too much.</li>
    <li> I have bought and used this teeth bleaching gel a few times and continue to be pleased with the results. just put a little gel into a whitening tray and wear it for about twenty minutes. Some people like to use it longer, but I think 20 minutes, twice a week is ideal for when you want to brighten up your teeth. Then once my teeth look whiter, I may use it once a month to maintain but still get bright, nice teeth whenever I give them a treatment. What&#x27;s nice about Sporting Smiles Gel is that its gentle and I don&#x27;t get over sensitive teeth for the frequency I use it. Also the price really beats a professional treatment, so I&#x27;m sticking with it.</li>
    <li> works well economical cost per application</li>
    <li> will order whitening led light next, it&#x27;s what you need for this particular bleach whitening.</li>
    <li> stings, but works fast</li>
    <li> Maybe I don&#x27;t use it as often as I should, but I see very little whitening difference.  I don&#x27;t drink teeth staining beverages, so I feel I should have better results.  Good price, so I may order more and keep at it. I had no pain or sensitivity after using this.</li>
    <li> I was not prepared for the sensitivity of my gums. I had to stop using this because of the pain to my teeth.It is very hard not to get this stuff on your gums and once it gets on your gums OMG! I think it may work for others but not for me.Buy at your own risk. I will be purchasing crest white strips ASAP!</li>
    <li> Work just as well as the ones purchased from dentist at a fraction of the cost.</li>
    <li> I used this with my little blue light I got on here, and my teeth were glaring white in five minutes.</li>
    <li> Works really really well. It&#x27;s easy to use and does the trick</li>
    <li> Powerful stuff worked immediately. My teeth are  whiter. I could only tolerate it 10 minutes. I&#x27;m happy with the results.</li>
    <li> I bought 8 tubes of this tooth bleaching product. It works as described and the cost varies greatly from vendor to vendor. Shop around these guys were the best deal.</li>
    <li> I have use this treatment for two weeks now. And I can already see a difference. The tubes are huge though. I think 1 tube would last months.</li>
    <li> I have used teeth whitening gels from a dentist office and they made my teeth so sensitive I could only use it one time.  I was skeptical to try it again.  I am one for perfect teeth so I thought I would try one more time.  I have very sensitive teeth and this product was amazing!! Being nervous to try it the first time because of sensitivity I only left it on for 9 minutes.  I already noticed a huge difference and I didn&#x27;t have any sensitivity.  I used the reminerizing gel after my whitening treatment which may of made a difference as well.  I highly recommend this product because it really works.  I noticed my first time!!</li>
    <li> good product for the price.</li>
    <li> I am a  2009 retired dentist and in my office we paid more for similar carbamide peroxide bleach than you pay for this online. If you allow some of this bleach to touch your gingiva for any length of time you will know it. There will be discomfort and perhaps a whitening of the gingiva that will not last. There is no permanent damage from this but marked soreness will result and depending on length of exposure , can last up to a day or so. You do not need to cover all of the enamel to get effective bleaching of the the entire visible tooth/teeth. If you cover 1/2 to 2/3 of the clinical crown ( ie the visible part of your teeth) the &amp;#34;bleach&amp;#34; will lighten the entire visible tooth. Another side to this bleaching process is that the higher the concentration of the bleach the faster the bleaching happens but there is the increased risk of transient sensitivity as well so the recommendation is go slow as you increase exposure time. Another reason for covering only 1/2 to 2/3 of the of the clinical crowns of the teeth is the issue of swallowing the excess carbamide peroxide. I don&#x27;t think it is a problem but there is no sense swallowing any of this you don&#x27;t have to. I don&#x27;t think FDA or researchers have demonstrated any evidence of toxicity from carbamide peroxide or we would have heard about it- nevertheless, use as little as possible to get the job done. I think this product is very effective and strongly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Works great!  Cheaper than going to the dentist.  No problems at all.</li>
    <li> They seem to work ok.  But the taste is terrible.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have used the 35% Gel. I am using it in molds done by my dentist. I have used it about 6 times now, and I see significant whitening with each application - more at first and less now as my teeth get close to what I want. Be careful not to use too much in an application because it will leak out.  It burns your gums a little, and it tastes terrible. Getting a mint flavor, if they have it, would be much better.</li>
    <li> I received the product four days sooner than quoted, and was very happy about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took a picture of my teeth before I used the gel the first time. I am fortunate to have dentist-made trays to use. I&#x27;ve only used twice so far - slight tingling after the trays have been on a while, but no pain or sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will compare my pre- picture in a week or so and update my review...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the product for a little bit now and have had amazing results! I&#x27;m so glad that I took a \\&quot;before\\&quot; picture to compare. At first I had slight sensitivity, but that lessened and went away after only a few uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth look white and I am very pleased!</li>
    <li> I loved this product, it is a little thick but it does a good job of whitening.</li>
    <li> I used this product twice and although it works and whitens pretty quickly, I&#x27;d get a huge jolt of pain deep in my teeth randomly using these. I don&#x27;t have any open cavities but my enamel isn&#x27;t the greatest. The burning sensation wasn&#x27;t a problem at all but the jolts will leave you stunned and wanting to discontinue. I looked it up online and they are referred to as \\&quot;zingers\\&quot;</li>
    <li> The BEST deal, and it doesn&#x27;t make my teeth sensitive, like other teeth whiteners!</li>
    <li> Works great just like the expensive type you purchase from your dentist but better.</li>
    <li> I have used professional teeth bleaching kits from my dentist and also over the counter products and although the price is low, I have not seen the results expected from a product which is supposed to contain 35% bleaching strength. After using an entire tube and comparing it to the chart, my teeth haven&#x27;t lightened at all. I do not recommend this brand.</li>
    <li> Great product for the price. I used to pay $50 for a few tubes of whitening gel at the dentist. Although there is some initial sensitivity with normal usage, that tends to be the case with any professional whitening product.</li>
    <li> Gel is very strong, it make my gums sore and can feel &amp;#34;zingers&amp;#34; the day or two after.</li>
    <li> Works greats and lasts long!</li>
    <li> I love this product! I wouldn&#x27;t trust any other whitener! I get compliments on my teeth all day, everyday. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Saved me money. Results in a few days.</li>
    <li> Works okay, but doesn&#x27;t seem to get my teeth as white as previous products I have used.  As I said, &amp;#34;just okay.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> As soon as I got this I put it on my teeth using my mouth tray. After only maybe three minutes I felt an excruciating pain jolting through my front teeth so bad that I had to rinse it out immediately. I tried using it again this time without the mouth tray and it happened again. Really disappointed cause I wanted to keep it in longer than 15 mins and see results but if it&#x27;s going to be that painful I probably can&#x27;t. Guess I&#x27;ll just spot treat my incisors and other surrounding teeth to see of that works any better</li>
    <li> These tubes are really big and I have used one tube for the past 5 nights, and i&#x27;m not even 30% of the way done. So they will last a long time! I&#x27;m surprised by how well they whiten as well, and you only need to have them on for 10-15 minutes tops. I do it for about 12 minutes a night, and it whitens my teeth and surprisingly doesn&#x27;t make them very sensitive like most whiteners do. Definitely will be ordering more when i&#x27;m done!</li>
    <li> The order was delivered faster than normal and the product is a true product.</li>
