<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> NICE SCENT ARRIVED ON TIME</li>
    <li> I got this for my mother. It&#x27;s her favorite perfume.</li>
    <li> I just love this perfume. It is fresh, delicate and long-lasting.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is soft without a vanilla smell.&lt;br /&gt;It is one of a kind!</li>
    <li> Love Sweet Honesty smells wonderful! Shipping was fast too!</li>
    <li> I love Sweet Honesty&#x27;s scent - as \\&quot;sweet\\&quot; and light as its name implies. It pleases rather than assaulting the senses. And it is very inexpensive but doesn&#x27;t smell \\&quot;cheap.\\&quot; It is a wonderful value. My favorite perfume I have ever tried.</li>
    <li> If you want a soft smelling perfume that gets noticed Sweet Honesty is always the best. Got tons of compliments on it!!</li>
    <li> I was first introduced to this perfume as a going-away gift after I worked as a Graduate Student rehabilitation counseling intern, many years ago, for several months at a vocational rehabilitation counseling facility. I worked under five supervisors/bosses, and had to report to each of them each week while teaching and counseling the facility&#x27;s patients. Anyways, I had great rapport with all my co-workers, bosses, and clientele, and they gave me great going-away presents such as rare Care Bear stuffed toys, nice writing utensils, various American Eagle company winter accessories and jewelry, nice local BBQ lunch, pomegranate fruit, and various Avon products including this perfume. The head boss frankly told me the reason why she gave me this perfume. She said that she considered me a sweet and honest person when I served as a counselor there. She said that I was one of the few individuals who told her upfront my honest opinions about how the workplace and the workplace environment could be improved, and that I did it in a nice, constructive, friendly, \\&quot;sweet\\&quot; way instead of in a harsh, mean way as some past employees. Anyways, what she said was honestly one of the best compliments I&#x27;ve received because she trusted and valued my sincere honesty, remarks, and opinions. Anyways, you can see why this cologne spray holds sentimental value to me. I own a lot of more expensive perfumes, but this cheaper in cost fragrance holds more value and meaning to me. It goes beyond cosmetic/beauty value for me. I love the fact that it&#x27;s youthful, light, and subtle-smelling. I can&#x27;t stand strong, powerful fragrances. This Sweet Honesty fragrance is just right. If you know a sweet, honest, opinionated woman who likes wearing light fragrances, then this would be a great fragrance to give as a gift. I think this would make an excellent gift for employees, co-workers, birthdays, graduations, etc. I highly recommend this fragrance from Avon.</li>
    <li> really love the mild scent , it last long as well</li>
    <li> I have loved this fragrance for years but it doesn&#x27;t last on the skin. Best used fresh out the shower or around the house for a light fragrance. Wish it was stronger because it really is a beautiful clean floral scent.</li>
    <li> Long lasting,  baby powder smell without leaving a scent trail...seller delivery lightning fast,  will order again.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite fragrances. Avon has many&lt;br /&gt;others  worth  buying too. The bottle looks nice&lt;br /&gt;on my dresser. Thanks Avon!</li>
    <li> Fresh, light ,not overpowering, great everyday fragrance highly suggest to anyone that likes something fresh and clean smelling&lt;br /&gt;try it today you won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
    <li> My wife simply adores this perfume and I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere; even Avon doesn&#x27;t carry it anymore.  Amazon.com to the rescue and at a great price.  This was a Christmas present, but I sure she will just love it because its her favorite.</li>
    <li> Fragrance not strong enough</li>
    <li> I love the smell, but by the time I put the bottle in my purse, there&#x27;s no trace of a scent.  I know it&#x27;s cheap, but I&#x27;ve bought other cheap fragrances that did a little better. Now I remember why I stopped buying this years ago.</li>
    <li> Love the scent, the only thing I didn&#x27;t like that you did NOT give me any samples. How I&#x27;m going to continue to buy your product if you do not give out samples.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve never tried this fragrance you owe it to yourself to give it a shot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very soft and clean baby powder type scent. Its not at all overwhelming or perfumey. It smells very subtle and clean. I know so many women want to smell \\&quot;sexy\\&quot; these days, and if thats your thing you probably won&#x27;t like this fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am back to basics at this point in my life, and this fragrance fits the bill in every way. Try it!!</li>
    <li> Love it since high school. Smells sweet and dainty.</li>
    <li> It cam on time.  However, It was on sale for 2,99, but by the time I paid for shipping for such a tiny item, I ended up paying full price, which I could have done through a private sale. So I didn&#x27;t save any money.  It&#x27;s all good.&lt;br /&gt;I still love amazon</li>
    <li> nice light scent for during the day. does not stain clothes</li>
    <li> Sweet Honesty - this is still my favorite cologne. I try other scents and I keep coming back. Thank you!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s strong you dont need to spray it more than once but it&#x27;s very sweet smelling perfume for all women</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very Good sent my boyfriend loves it as much as I do... And it&#x27;s a good price too</li>
    <li> I was trying to regain that feeling of being 15 but maybe 15 wasn&#x27;t that great after all because although it smells the same, it&#x27;s not nearly as good as I remembered. You can&#x27;t go home again. :D</li>
    <li> My sweet grandmother Louise wore this and Sweet Honesty was her favorite perfume. She was sensitive to overpowering scents so she liked how light this one was yet it does have lingering power. After she passed I got a bottle of hers and starting wearing it myself in her memory. I really like it now and continue to buy it. It is very light and fresh and reminds me of the scent of baby powder, and of course, my sweet Louise :)</li>
    <li> Love, love love this stuff!!</li>
    <li> This was a gift for a friend .This is her favorite Cologne . Was very well recieved.Has a nice soft smell.</li>
    <li> I love this spray cologne.  Cannot get enough of it</li>
    <li> So so so so excited to find this perfume! It was the perfume my grandma wore for years before she passed, and I could never remember the name of it. Recently I was given an almost empty bottle that was my grandmas and I was afraid it wouldn&#x27;t be around anymore as it came from 1998. Can&#x27;t wait to purchase more! It has a lovely sweet, subtle scent. It smells a little like baby powder, but more floral. I love it!!!</li>
    <li> Beautiful floral scent</li>
    <li> GREAT SALE,, LOOKING FORWARD TO BUY AGAIN, SAME PRODUCT. EASY SHIPPING,, FAST DELIVERY! THANKS,, JEAN</li>
    <li> What a fantastic fragrance, however I did find the difference between fragrance &amp; cologne. Perfume is very dilutive, mixing other types of soft floral fragrances. Cologne has a higher percentage of alcohol (which is why perfume is much more expensive). So just a spray or two of this is all you need.</li>
    <li> Love this perfume as I used to wear it in high school many years ago! Product arrived on time and in great condition! Thanks!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what I expected but it smells very floral with sweet undertone...as my daughter said &amp;#34;You should give it to Grandma it smells like her&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> thank u for getting it to me so fast  sweet honesty is my favorite sent ill be back for more</li>
    <li> Not as long lasting of a scent as Avon&#x27;s other colognes but it smells pretty.</li>
    <li> This was my very first perfume.....I was a preteen and my mom was introducing me to &amp;#34;lady like&amp;#34; ways....LOL She bought me this perfume along with other feminine products so I could start taking pride in the way I carried myself...Lol it has a sweet soft scent...not too strong and not too light....smells like fresh rose pedals.....I hadn&#x27;t seen it in years until I bought this on here...worth every penny...</li>
    <li> This is one of the first fragrances I had as a kid.  I bought it for my daughter as it has a nice light scent that is great for little girls too.</li>
    <li> I wore Sweet Honesty as a teenager and it was a wonderful walk down memory lane to wear it again.</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume for my Mom when she was alive. Sorry I am behind on my reviews. She loved this perfume and I would usually by it on-line for her whenever she ran out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn this since the 1970s, when I turned thirteen. It and Estee Lauder Youth Dew were my first-ever perfumes. It&#x27;s a classic, perfect for any age. Sweet floral, flirty scent.</li>
    <li> Awesome  perfume  i love the aroma it takes me back to my high school days very recommend product! !!</li>
    <li> Just like another review...this was my fav.in Highschool.Even many years later at 36,This beautiful smell is simply one of a kind!Thee best!</li>
    <li> Those heady college days, when the world was my oyster and I had it all ahead of me. . .all brought back with one whiff of Avon&#x27;s Sweet Honesty Cologne!  It was one of the most popular scents on campus (admittedly a small campus).  I was heartbroken when Avon stopped selling it.  Fast forward, and I took a notion one day to look for it online. After all, everything&#x27;s online nowadays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trying a few old faithful perfume sites, I checked Amazon, and lo and behold--an amazing choice of Sweet Honesty products at unbelievable prices. I chose the 1.7 oz spray at a 94% reduction from RRP! It arrived in short order, and since then I have been reliving the memories.  Trust Amazon to have what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I have used this perfume for years as my primary one and have been complimented numerous times about smelling good. I suppose you could hook up with a Avon representative to be able to smell it first.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite perfumes ever...so fresh!</li>
    <li> Smells like Johnson&#x27;s baby lotion.</li>
    <li> Smells like baby powder; not that it&#x27;s a bad scent, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting such a weak fragrance that doesn&#x27;t linger long enough for anyone to smell it. Personally, it seems like a scent for preteens, but it&#x27;s not for me.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my grand daughter and it is just as I remember.  Sweet and light floral scent.</li>
    <li> This perfume did not smell the same. I have been buying sweet honesty for years. I think the product was old. Shipping was fast.</li>
    <li> I bought this cologne because it was claimed by others as smelling similar to baby powder.  Unfortunately, I disagree.  It has too strong a fragrance for my liking.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing Sweet Honest since high school...over 30 years ago. I still get compliments on how fresh and pretty it smells when I wear it. I hope Avon continues to make this fragrance for many, many more years.</li>
    <li> .I&#x27;ve been wearing this stuff on and off for the past 40 years.  The usual reaction I get from men when they smell it is a question.  They usually ask if I just came in from outside.  It&#x27;s a nice light floral / citrus scent.</li>
    <li> Captivating cleanliness which inspires reliance</li>
    <li> i wear this everyday at work and people will not complain about strong scents..this is mild and sweet...</li>
</ol>
