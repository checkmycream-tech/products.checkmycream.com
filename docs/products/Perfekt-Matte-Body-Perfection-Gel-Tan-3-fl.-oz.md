<li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
<li> I am extremely fair-skinned and do not tan.  </li>
<li> Not worth it for the price.  </li>
<li> Also, you have to wait several hours for them to &amp;#34;develop&amp;#34; and you never know what color you&#x27;re going to get or if it will be blotchy until it is too late.  </li>
<li> Its not your typical bronzer</li>
<li> I&#x27;m also a stickler for what a fake tan looks like in natural sunlight!</li>
<li> What am I missing?</li>
<li> A little hard to spread on</li>
<li> a little too expensive</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t cover as deeply as I would it, too... but it does give my legs that &amp;#34;sun-kissed&amp;#34; look, which is what I was aiming for in the first place.  The price is a tad high, but you only need to use the gel sparingly, so it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Love the natural tan but don&#x27;t use on face it shows the lines!</li>
    <li> This product is a cross between a tanner and hose.  It gives an excellent glow to the skin, even for older skin.  I use it on my legs when wearing a skirt or dress.  It is perfect as the title says.</li>
    <li> Looks as good as a pair of perfectly tinted nylons without the hassle!</li>
    <li> This product evens out the tones of your skin to one color, giving you that smooth sensational look we all desire.</li>
    <li> I never tan, and I hate the stink of self tanners.  This is an excellent product for me, because I only use it on mornings when I&#x27;m wearing a skirt to work.  It&#x27;s a thick brown paste and is easy to apply because you can see the color on your skin as you apply it.  It&#x27;s very moisturizing, and it not only tans but also covers flaws in your skin.  I recently put in on before going to a water park.  My friend teased me that I was silly to waste in when it would just wash off in the water.  BUT IT DIDN&#x27;T WASH OFF.  It only came off on my feet where my water shoes rubbed it off my skin.  Expensive, but well worth it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m allergic to self tanners so this is great for a tan look without the sun.  For a true tan look you need to go with the darker shade.  Once dry it stays put.  Sometimes I brush a little bronzer on top.</li>
    <li> brilliant stuff -- gives gorgeous natural looking smooth color -- but it essentially is make-up -- as opposed to self tanner -- so it WILL come off on sheets/clothing etc.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s rather perfect.</li>
    <li> Just love it it really goes on so smooth and even and makes your skin so silky smooth.  Pricey but worth it</li>
    <li> This does make your skin and complexion look great..however, it does not last.  Washes right off.  Not worth it for the price.  I also only had luck on my face and chest.. came out real spotty on legs and feet even after exfoliating</li>
    <li> I have tried it A-L-L.... I tell you this stuff is gold. I know the price is scary but this stuff is that good. I&#x27;ve scoured the Internet and parted with $45 when I couldn&#x27;t find one bad review. I&#x27;m also a stickler for what a fake tan looks like in natural sunlight! I used to pay $50 for a spray tan that was never right,it was a pain to upkeep, came off patchy, and settled into my pores...this was my solution to a instant perfection!!!&lt;br /&gt;Pro: comes out perfect every time- no streaks&lt;br /&gt;  -color is a BEAUTIFUL toasted color- great for REALLY pale people&lt;br /&gt;  -skin feels like silk&lt;br /&gt;  - no nasty tanner smell&lt;br /&gt;  - a little goes a long way&lt;br /&gt;  - no dumb shimmer it&#x27;s a beautiful natural matte&lt;br /&gt;Con:  washes off when you shower&lt;br /&gt;  Is water resistant however you can&#x27;t swim or really get wet with it. I went peddle boating and got splashed several times and it started to run&lt;br /&gt;  - price is high&lt;br /&gt;  - does come off on inside of  clothes where it rubs (bottom of shorts edge on thigh)&lt;br /&gt;Pictures 2 below left leg is natural- right has product on it&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both legs done in natural light:&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> Yes, it is pricey, but this really delivers a natural tan look. I love the ease in putting on. The gel is a little talc-like in texture, which was a little scary at first, but it went on so smooth and my arms and legs looked instantly tan with no blotching or unevenness. I am thrilled to find a product that I can use for a summer wedding on a hot day (no pantyhose, thank you). Another plus is there is no weird odor and it leaves my skin feeling very soft. I love this stuff.</li>
    <li> I love the Perfekt line of products.  I had this product a long time ago and ran out and just never got around to buying another bottle.  This new formula is even more light weight and glides on so smoothly.  Its not your typical bronzer in fact the best way I can describe it is liquid nylons.  It just makes your complexion look, well perfect!</li>
    <li> I am impressed; the gel went on smoothly, no streaking, no awful odor associated with most self tanning products, no orange colored buildup around my ankles or knees. The gel didn&#x27;t completely cover my veins or bruises but it does camouflage to some extent. The product is expensive but it only takes a small amount and it does work better than any other self tanning product that I have tried.</li>
    <li> A little hard to spread on I use a tiny bit of lotion to help. Great giving some color to bare legs and covering varicose veins.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried applying it lightly, I&#x27;ve tried putting it on thicker. I&#x27;ve tried rubbing it in, patting it on, blah blah blah. Just seems to do nothing. What am I missing? Come to think of it, why am I giving this thing two stars?</li>
    <li> This is a very interesting product!!  I have used self-tanner for years now but this is different.  It does give a nice &amp;#34;non-orangey&amp;#34; tan color to&lt;br /&gt;the skin and I love that it has no scent.  The only bad thing is the PRICE.  Too expensive and probably can be since it&lt;br /&gt;is like no other product I have used before.  Better than a bronzer in that it doesn&#x27;t leave you all &amp;#34;shimmery&amp;#34; and gives a nice&lt;br /&gt;even tan tone if you apply it to dry skin.  Really nice!  I will just have to use it sparingly and for special occasions since it is&lt;br /&gt;so expensive.</li>
    <li> I actually found out about this product because I heard Rihanna&#x27;s (singer) makeup artist uses this on her all the time. I love it I am tanned skin already like Rihanna and this just gives your legs a flawless finish. Makes them look great hides spider veins wonderfully. Makes your skin feel very smooth and soft and doesn&#x27;t rub off.Def recommend this.</li>
    <li> great product. a little too expensive however...if you can get it on sale it is worth spending a little extra for this product.</li>
    <li> This is fantastic self tanner- without overdoing it, it enhances your natural skin tone and makes you legs look youthful and toned. No streaks and water proof! Love this product!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a ballroom dancer and use this product every time I need a little color - absolutely the best product I&#x27;ve used in a long time!</li>
    <li> Great Product!  Goes on smooth with incredible coverage.  So much better than spray tan.It actually covers imperfections and makes skin look younger.  Only downside is that you have to apply it after each shower.  But will never do another spray tan as long as I can get this product.</li>
    <li> Color is perfect and you don&#x27;t have to worry thAt it will come off on your clothing or furniture.  There is no smell, that alone is a great plus and it is temporary...no streaking...just perfect. LOVE...</li>
    <li> Have tried them all and this finally delivers.  No funny smell and easy coverage.  Stays on until washed off.  No shine on this matte. Totally believable coverage.  Expensive but I will still buy.</li>
    <li> Wow, I was pleasantly surprised by this product!  I am extremely fair-skinned and do not tan.  In the summer I usually use self tanners but really don&#x27;t like how they smell.  Also, you have to wait several hours for them to &amp;#34;develop&amp;#34; and you never know what color you&#x27;re going to get or if it will be blotchy until it is too late.  This is a WONDERFUL alternative to self-tanners.  When it comes out of the tube it is super dark and it looks like it will be a disaster, but once on your skin it gives you just the right amount of gorgeous color!  A little goes a long way.  Very important not to moisturize before using this or it will slide right off.  Believe it or not, the gel consistency makes your skin silky and soft and this is all you need for moisture.  I use it mainly on my legs to give them color when I am wearing shorts or a dress, although I have used it on my arms and decollete as well.  I do have some spider veins and freckles on my skin and it does not cover them up, but does go a long way to even out the tone and they are not nearly as noticeable.  Color is very natural, not orange or reddish, just a nice, neutral brownish tan.  Does not rub off easily, however I would not wear anything white - I wouldn&#x27;t wear white with a self-tanner either so no difference there.  This will be my go-to instead of self-tanner from now on!</li>
    <li> Love this product!! Does exactly what you hope it will and no scent! YAY!</li>
    <li> Life changing. No smell. Easy to apply. Never again will I use anything else. Take my word for it.</li>
