      <li>and I have to say that my face has adjusted nicely.  </li>
      <li>Which is how I came to own this one.</li>

      <li>If you look at the remington site you&#x27;ll find the cleaning solution and replacement blades VERY cheap.</li>

      <li>Achieving a close-enough shave required applying more pressure which in turn caused irritation.</li>
      <li>and this seems to do a better job - although it does take longer than a blade or the Braun.</li>

      <li>Once Norelco releases one it will cost around $135 more then the remington based of thier latest releases and dollar amounts).&lt;br /</li>
      <li>that lift and cut system by Norelco gives me what I want most, a close shave.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t see how this shaver could do a better job than it does.  </li>
      <li>There is not a horrible difference</li>
      <li>it is great and FAR better then</li>
      <li>He had a Norelco but says this is a top of the line comfortable close shave.  </li>
      <li>I love the way this razor makes his face feel so smooth.</li>
      <li>He loved it so much he told me to write a 5 star review.  </li>
      <li>ONLY good part of this razor is the nice smell of the cleaning solution.</li>
      <li>I have a very soft and fine beard, and it just would not give me a good shave.  </li>
      <li>If you do not grow a great deal of facial hair then this shaver will be fine to purchase, but i have hair on my neck and this does not get to them unfortunatly.  </li>
      <li>Fantastic product - my husband loves it.  </li>
      <li>, just consider what your primary use is and how often.</li>
      <li>and they would replace it for free without any hassles.  </li>
      <li>A foil keeps everything smooth if used often.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, this Shaver is nice if really want the cleaning feature</li>
      <li>My Norelco always seems something less than sparkly clean despite my best efforts to clean it.  </li>
      <li>&lt;BR&gt;-Quality of construction is not as good as Norelco&#x27;s.&lt;BR&gt;-The number of blades on each head of the Remington is about half the number of Norelco&#x27;s.&lt;BR&gt;-The self-cleaning feature is nice</li>
      <li>I found customer support to be well informed when I called on the original shaver.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I think I&#x27;d pass on it if I were to buy another, and stick with a manual clean model thats easier to clean.</li>
      <li>And it never seems to stay clean.</li>
      <li>it is to keep it clean.</li>
      <li>just push the clean button, and you&#x27;re done.</li>
      <li>now I have to clean it manually with water.  </li>
      <li>he just hates to manually clean razors.</li>
      <li>but if a quality shave is important, spend the extra money and get a good Norelco.</li>
      <li>It appears to keep the Titanium exceptionally clean.  </li>
      <li>The Titanium is still a good value however and seems like a solid shaver.  </li>
      <li>So after a full day charging, I grab my razor and take it off the charger (stating 60 minutes) and as soon as I turn it on, it falls to</li>
      <li>But the screens develop holes quickly sometimes.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I then passed over my face lightly with my old Remington Intercept and took off a significant amount of hair!.  </li>
      <li>When you open the top of the shaver after the cleaning - it&#x27;s spotless!</li>
      <li>Definitly worth the price I paid for it.</li>
      <li>Cleaning solution is about $5 for a month&#x27;s worth, which is $60/year</li>
      <li>The washing/lubricating system keeps it fresh.  </li>
      <li>but it really doesnt clean at all</li>
      <li>but I have to run it twice before it really seems clean.</li>
      <li>I thought the self-cleaning would be a great time-saving feature but with my old Intercept I could shave and clean up in half the time of just shaving with the 9500.&lt;BR</li>
      <li>I used this shaver every day for the full 30 day trial period and found that it still required a lot of effort to get a decent shave.  </li>
      <li>Very easy to use and keeps the charge for a long time.</li>
      <li>---there&#x27;s a good chance you will feel a little irritation at first-probably on your neck.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s quiet, quick and easy.  </li>
      <li>Neck never gets red or burned and it does a better job around the neck than a blade.</li>
      <li>I had gotten a Remington foil shaver first.  </li>
      <li>First, I&#x27;ve owned it for about 8 months.  </li>
      <li>I love this product, especially the self cleaning.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;This is my first rotary shaver and so far I am a huge fan.  </li>
      <li>My first one lasted just over a month.  </li>
      <li>It takes a couple layers of your skin off at first.</li>
      <li>I had a Norelco, but this is a much better shave, and very solidly built.</li>
      <li>I am now after 2 months of using their pre-shave talc \\&quot;face-saver\\&quot; which actually gives me a closer shave, completely satisfied with my purchase.  </li>
      <li>I love the quiet smooth fast action, the lack of vibration, and the ease of use.  </li>
      <li>I exchanged it for a different brand that gave me a much closer, very comfortable, and uneventful shave.</li>
      <li>I certainly don&#x27;t see myself switching to any other kind of shave any time soon.</li>
      <li>The cleaner does a great job of cleaning the razor but as another reviewer pointed out it takes a long time for the razor to dry.  </li>
      <li>it more then makes up for the minor inconvienance of ordering from thier site!&lt;br</li>
      <li>When I first took this razor to my face it felt like I had really shaved off layers of skin.  </li>
      <li>The automatic cleaning system is real neat.</li>
      <li>I also don&#x27;t really care for the built in reservoir and separate filter design.</li>
      <li>I really gave this razor a chance, and suffered through the pain thinking it would eventually subside.</li>
      <li>Braun&#x27;s self contained setup is so much better.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It really depends how you grow your hair.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t realize just how much damage I was doing to my face until I splashed on aftershave --</li>
      <li>find the cleaner works very well</li>
      <li>But I have not found a rotary shaver that shaves very well.</li>
      <li>right now remington is a little more high tech then Norelco.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t run out of the original fluid</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have been looking for something to supplement my Syncro for the neck/chin area, so I bought into the hype and picked myself up an R-9500 2 weeks ago...&lt;br /&gt;2 weeks later... and the cuts have finally healed. The 9500 is by far the worst razor I have ever used. It was extremely harsh and unpleasant. Felt like I had dull rusted blades chopping away at my face. Under my nose, chin, neck area was a total mess. Swollen red bumps, little cuts everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;The floating head design is really poor, it doesn&#x27;t conform to your face at all and you have to apply a little pressure or it wont cut. Even after going through all of that, you still end up with a horrible shave. 5 o&#x27;clock shadow is still there and you could run your hand over your face and get the sand paper effect.&lt;br /&gt;Not much I can say about the cleaner other than it gets the job done, but it does a really poor job drying the razor. A couple hours later I could take it out of the stand, pop off the top and get several drops of cleaning solution out of it. I also don&#x27;t really care for the built in reservoir and separate filter design. Braun&#x27;s self contained setup is so much better.&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor, do not waste your money on this razor. If you want a rotary, stick to Norelco.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t give me a close shave.  It leaked profusely. And eventually it just plain broke.  Save your money and wait til Norelco comes out with a self-cleaning razor.</li>
    <li> I have owned this razor for several months, not including the time it has been in the shop.  My first one lasted just over a month.  Something got plugged-up and the self-cleaning failed to clean.  I returned it and got another. This one seems to work, but in one cleaning cycle it leaked all of the fluid out on my sink.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As a razor, it seems about average. The cleaning solution leaves a lubricating oil which helps with the shave.  If you don&#x27;t use the self cleaning feature, this razor is rather hard to clean manually since the blades are sealed in a plastic compartment which has to be taken apart to clean. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Self-cleaning, when it works, does work well, but its rather noisy.  Cleaning solution is about $5 for a month&#x27;s worth, which is $60/year so consider this when you look at the cost.  If you don&#x27;t want to use it as a self-cleaning razor, you can use it as a regular razor, but others are easier to clean than this one. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think I&#x27;d pass on it if I were to buy another, and stick with a manual clean model thats easier to clean.</li>
    <li> bought it off ebay for $50 new. yes, it does take a little while to get used to---there&#x27;s a good chance you will feel a little irritation at first-probably on your neck. But let me tell you something: this thing shaves a gazzilion times faster than my Braun did. I used to dread shaving, especially if i missed 2 or 3 days. This shaver is a breeze to use. I use the self-clean once a week so far. If you&#x27;ve ever used a Norelco, you know what a collassal pain in the butt it is to keep it clean. And it never seems to stay clean. This system is such a breath of fresh air. just push the clean button, and you&#x27;re done. &lt;br /&gt;p.s.  I almost wonder if some of the horrific revues were written by the competition. seriously.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Great shave in minutes! The automatic cleaning system is real neat. When you open the top of the shaver after the cleaning - it&#x27;s spotless!</li>
    <li> First, I&#x27;ve owned it for about 8 months.  Use it everyday and refill the cleaning solution with the brand/type designed for the unit.  Shaves are initially as close as a razor but you have to reshave if you plan on going out past 6pm.  Never get any ingrown hairs because I exfolliate prior to using it with either a scrub or washcloth in the shower prior to shaving.  Use either a preshave conditioner, a shaver stick by Remington or King of Shaves oil.  Never had an ingrown hair or bump since.  Neck never gets red or burned and it does a better job around the neck than a blade. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Used a Braun for years and this seems to do a better job - although it does take longer than a blade or the Braun. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The only problem I&#x27;ve found so far is with the charging base.  Its poorly constructed.  Seven months of use and the spindle that holds the prop that circulates the cleaning solution has totally rusted through rendering the cleaning cycle inoperable.  Called Remington today and they would replace it for free without any hassles.  Found out from other websites that this is a common problem with this unit. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Charges do last a relatively long time.  About ten days with power to spare and I shave for about 5-6 minutes which isn&#x27;t bad! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Wish it was waterproof like the Panasonics or Norelcos so I can use it in the shower. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> When I purchased this shaver, it was with the understanding that it was new. When it arrived it had scratches on the chrome surface, the on off switch was obviously worn. When I shaved with it my neck was not red from irritation It was red with blood, not just one spot. There were at least 30-40 places that were bleeding. It was  delivered with no paperwork. I have no idea how to return it.    Ken Maxwell</li>
    <li> Not so great.  I Thought as a Remington it would shave great.  But I have not found a rotary shaver that shaves very well. Convenient and easy, but not very good.  Plus the cleaning system broke in a few months and could not be replaced or repaired, so now I have to clean it manually with water.  The shaver itself is solid and strong, but shaves no better than any other rotary I have used.    Stick to the Remington Micro-screen.  Best electric shave I have found.    Not happy about the \\&quot;Made in China\\&quot; label either.</li>
    <li> This electric razor does the job when it comes to shaving.  However, my one major reason for purchasing an electric razor was so that I could shave on the go.  Unfortunately, this razor does not live up to the job because it never keeps the charge.  When fully charged, the razor reads \\&quot;60 minutes\\&quot;.  So after a full day charging, I grab my razor and take it off the charger (stating 60 minutes) and as soon as I turn it on, it falls to \\&quot;0 minutes\\&quot; and does not work.  Then if I plug it in, it still doesn&#x27;t work.  Now, please understand that this did not used to be a problem; this only happened after about 1 year of ownership.  But, I would not expect this to happen after only one year, maybe after 5-6 years.  Good luck to you, gentlemen.</li>
    <li> This is a great razor...easily the best shave I have ever had.&lt;BR&gt;I had a Norelco, but this is a much better shave, and very solidly built. I love the self-cleaning feature.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best electric shaver I have ever used.  If you use it as directed (not pressing it too hard into your skin), there is no way it can cut you or even irritate.  I have sensitive skin, yet I can use this without any pre-shave products.  The self-cleaning feature is outstanding as well.  The shave I get is also much closer than with any other electric shaver I ever used-- I used to avoid electric shavers because they always left me with stubble; this one doesn&#x27;t.  If you&#x27;re looking for a premium shaver, get this one.</li>
    <li> This shaver did not work out for me.  I can see some reviewers love it though.  I had gotten a Remington foil shaver first.  I have a very soft and fine beard, and it just would not give me a good shave.  Remington customer service said foil shavers aren&#x27;t for everyone, and told me to exchange it for a rotary.  Which is how I came to own this one. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have senesetive skin, and this shaver just butchered the skin on my neck.  I am aware of applying too much pressure, and was being very careful in that regard.  What it did shave was not close at all.  After several days, I looked like a cat had had a go at my neck.  I couldn&#x27;t tolerate it and had to return it.  So, I guess this is not the shaver for you if you have sensetive skin.  I exchanged it for a different brand that gave me a much closer, very comfortable, and uneventful shave. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What I loved about this shaver was the cleaning/charging base.  The shaver charges up in an hour, and cleans great.  I also liked the battery level display on the shaver. I found customer support to be well informed when I called on the original shaver.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I used \\&quot;Lectric shave\\&quot; and tried hard to make it work for me, because I really did like this shaver.  It just wasn&#x27;t for me. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> It is NOT a Norelco!! Heavy duty motor. It takes a couple layers of your skin off at first. No height adjustment lowers my opinion of this razor.The cleaning system is nice and works pretty good.</li>
    <li> .I bought this shaver in Detroit, MI. Do yourself a favor and don&#x27;t buy this one, it was definetely one of the biggest shopping mistakes I done so far.The battery finishes after 30 minutes of shaving instead of 60.The cleaner doesnt do the cleaning well, and the electric chord doesn&#x27;t hold up well while charggin, which means you can&#x27;t shave while charging.DON&#x27;T BUY THIS ONE !!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never owned a rotary before. I looked at all the norelco&#x27;s and it sounded like right now remington is a little more high tech then Norelco. I use it daily for my face and head and there have been no issues at all yet despite all lot of negative feedback I have seen around.&lt;br /&gt; The cleaning solution and replacement heads are VERY easy to obtain. I shop at various places online but when it comes to replacement parts I order directly from the manufacturer. If you look at the remington site you&#x27;ll find the cleaning solution and replacement blades VERY cheap. Yes you have shipping and handling but seeing how your planning ahead you just order 3/4 bottles and a set of blades and it more then makes up for the minor inconvienance of ordering from thier site!&lt;br /&gt; Overall it is great and FAR better then my old foil shaver. When Norelco finally gets a self cleaning unti I&#x27;ll buy it. But until then due to the high amount of shaving I do daily I need the self cleaning model. (I have also found remington to be the cheapest by nearly $75 in self cleaning razors. Once Norelco releases one it will cost around $135 more then the remington based of thier latest releases and dollar amounts).&lt;br /&gt; Always remember to comp shop and read product information before you spend $100 on a razor. Everyone has different needs.&lt;br /&gt; One last tid bit. I also bought the Braun self cleaning foil shaver. I use them both. The foil one is faster and leaves no irritation AT ALL. But the screens develop holes quickly sometimes.&lt;br /&gt; It really depends how you grow your hair. A foil keeps everything smooth if used often. The rotary will cut through anything even if you grow it out off and on. All in all either one works great, just consider what your primary use is and how often.</li>
    <li> My husband is a Drill Instructor for the Marine Corp. He always has to have a close shave. He works 18 hour days, and often can&#x27;t even come home at night. The razor shaves close enough to get him through the entire day w/out needing a second shave, and the battery lasts for an entire hour worth of shaving! Perfect for when he has to take it with him when he&#x27;s on the go! He loves it. I&#x27;d venture to say its the best one on the market. Cleaning is a breeze.</li>
    <li> I bought two, one for my son and one for my husband.  Son has opened and used it.  He loved it so much he told me to write a 5 star review.  He had a Norelco but says this is a top of the line comfortable close shave.  5 star quality and price...love the cleaning feature!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this razor about a month ago.  I have used Norelcos for years but I get tired of replacing blades and stripping the razor down to really get it clean.  I find that I open and blow out the head after every shave and use the self cleaner every 4-5 shaves.  I feared having to hunt for the cleaning solution so I bought a refill when I purchased the razor at Walmart.  If you are looking for the solution, try your local Walmart.&lt;br /&gt;I find that I must use a pre-shave with this razor or I get razor burn from it.  I have a tough beard and this razor handles it fine with the shave lasting at least 10 hours.  (I used to have to shave twice a day with the Norelco too)&lt;br /&gt;All of these rotary razors are tough to find replacement blades for when you need them, so I guess I&#x27;ll find out if the &amp;quot;self sharpening&amp;quot; feature really works and if these last longer.&lt;br /&gt;I find the cleaner works very well but it is noisey as the razor runs for a portion of the 15-25 mins cycle.  Depending on your bathroom setup, this might be a problem for other members of your family.  I haven&#x27;t run out of the original fluid yet so I can&#x27;t comment on how long it lasts.  I do like the carrying case as it actually has room for the power cord in case you are gone long enough to need to recharge the shaver.  Cleaning stand is not portable.</li>
    <li> When I first took this razor to my face it felt like I had really shaved off layers of skin.  Razor burn was incredible.  But like all electric shavers you must allow 3 weeks for your face and razor to adjust.  I like this model compared to the other rotarys because of its self cleaning function, it works fantastic.  I used to use foils but they would never trim my long hairs if I didn&#x27;t shave for a couple of days.  This thing on the other hand handles it all.  I am now after 2 months of using their pre-shave talc \\&quot;face-saver\\&quot; which actually gives me a closer shave, completely satisfied with my purchase.  It just took longer than I had expected.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver about a month ago. I been using it fairly regularly to let my face get used to it. After that month I still get massive razor burn from it.  It takes me at least 7 minutes to get a decently close shave with it and by 5PM I got shadow all over.  I can do a better job with my Gillete Atra in half the time. I have tried pre electric shave lotions and after shave lotion but nothing helps, my face still gets red with razor burn. What is also bad is that the cleaning solution only lasts about 4 weeks and when I tried to order it from Remington directly they said there was a 3 week backorder wait time, they were out. No store seems to carry the cleaning solution at this time either.   I guess if you have to have it, get it, but I prefer my old wet razor.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my husband for his birthday and he loves it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see how this shaver could do a better job than it does.  I&#x27;ve owned it for about three weeks now and shaving has gone from an annoying chore to a breeze.  I can in fact shave my face in less than two minutes with no hassle or fuss.  The shaver sits in a base station that keeps it charged and at the press of a button will clean itself.  It&#x27;s quiet, quick and easy.  Although the shave is comfortable there is a slight irritation afterwards so I use an after shave lotion.  Frankly though I think I am still adjusting to it as it is barely three weeks since I started using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first rotary shaver and so far I am a huge fan.  I love the quiet smooth fast action, the lack of vibration, and the ease of use.  I would highly recommend this item.  I certainly don&#x27;t see myself switching to any other kind of shave any time soon.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver a couple of months ago and I stopped using it.  If you do not grow a great deal of facial hair then this shaver will be fine to purchase, but i have hair on my neck and this does not get to them unfortunatly.  The top part of my face the machine shaves but I will have to reshave in a day.  The cleanining system is the worst part of this deal it says it is an automatic cleaning system but it really doesnt clean at all, I have to dissassemble the shaver and run it through with water to get the hairs out of the way.  My advice is still with the razor blades it will cost less money and less headache.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product - my husband loves it.  This is his second titanium 9500, his last one lasted for over 4 years and he finally wore it out.  He uses it not only for his face but he also shaves his head!  What a great product.</li>
    <li> Been using this product since 4/2006.  However a the cleaning system has a very difficult time keeping the product clean, then after 1 1/2 years just died.  Why -&gt; internal contacts had corroded due to rust and pieces had broken off.</li>
    <li> I have had mine now for about a month and I have to say that my face has adjusted nicely.  It may take longer for some but the quality of the shave (closeness) does improve with time.  The cleaner does a great job of cleaning the razor but as another reviewer pointed out it takes a long time for the razor to dry.  Not really a big problem for me personally.  The only real problem I have identified is that the cleaning solution and replacement heads are only available by mail order.  I bought mine at Walmart and I think Walmart should carry the replacements.  I have not ordered any solution yet so I can not speak to the availability issue.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver and have used it almost a month and a half. I&#x27;ve used Remington shavers before, and have never had a problem. This was until I bought this instrument of pain. I really gave this razor a chance, and suffered through the pain thinking it would eventually subside. It hasn&#x27;t. This sucker just plain hurts.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I get bad razor burn on my neck when I try to get a real close shave, and the shaver loves to yank the hair around the chin and mustache area (which shouldn&#x27;t happen with brand new blades, and a fully charged unit!). It hurts really bad.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Getting up to go to work or school in the morning is painful enough, but this shaver just adds to it.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The ONLY good part of this razor is the nice smell of the cleaning solution. Does that count??</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used nearly every kind of razor in the 50 years since I started shaving and this one is the best I have ever used.  The washing/lubricating system keeps it fresh.  The R-9500 continually shaves closer with less irritation than either my Norelco or the wet blade razors I&#x27;ve used recently.&lt;br /&gt;My only gripe is that Remington apparently didn&#x27;t anticipate the demand for the cleaning solution refills.</li>
    <li> The manual said to order your solution and filters on line.&lt;BR&gt;So I tried but found no mention of it. I checked the local drug stores and found nothing. Now what do I do. Still trying to call the company, so far no luck. VERY FRUSTRATED!</li>
    <li> I bought this Shaver about a month ago replacing my old Norelco 4805XL. I bought my Norelco 6 years ago and have cleaned it regularly but have never changed the blades! The point is that I get slightly more irritation with the Remington and it doesn&#x27;t give as close of a shave. That being said and it being the most important aspect of a shaver here a few details that might interest future buyers and current owners.&lt;br /&gt;-I have found that the Bestbuys in my area are well stocked with cleaning solution refills. Check the appliances section.        &lt;BR&gt;-Quality of construction is not as good as Norelco&#x27;s.&lt;BR&gt;-The number of blades on each head of the Remington is about half the number of Norelco&#x27;s.&lt;BR&gt;-The self-cleaning feature is nice but I have to run it twice before it really seems clean. Plus it takes a long time to dry.&lt;BR&gt;-The Norelco&#x27;s Lift and Cut system gives a closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this Shaver is nice if really want the cleaning feature but if a quality shave is important, spend the extra money and get a good Norelco.</li>
    <li> My fiance used to have a Norelco Spectra and it never gave him the close shave he was used too from his old Braun shaver. I figured that I would get him a razor for our anniversary. Well, I will have to say that his face is smoother than ever. He did get a few bumps on his neck area, but he also has very sensitive skin and it seems everytime he switches to a new razor it does that too him. The self cleaning feature is great becuase he just hates to manually clean razors. he has not had any problems with the unit not drying quickly enough because about 5 minutes after he cleaned it he used it with no problems at all. I love the way this razor makes his face feel so smooth. He comes home with NO 5 oclock shadow which is even better. Definitly worth the price I paid for it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a Norelco man for almost 35 years but decided to give the Titanium a try.  The Titanium intrigued me with its \\&quot;Turbo Cleaner\\&quot;.  My Norelco always seems something less than sparkly clean despite my best efforts to clean it.  Well, the Turbo Cleaner is nice and gives the bathroom a light \\&quot;barber shop\\&quot; scent which seems attractive to the wife.  This is a plus I hadn&#x27;t expected.  It appears to keep the Titanium exceptionally clean.  The Titanium and the Norelco are remarkably similar with the Titanium being almost $100 less... another big plus.  Then I decided to do that stupid TV type test with shaving half of my face with the Titanium and the other half with my old Norelco (the heads are almost a year old).  The Norelco simply gives a closer shave.  I think so, and the wife thinks so.  I didn&#x27;t even tell her which side of my face I shaved with the Norelco.  There is not a horrible difference but it is still one you can feel.  I even waited an hour in case the lift and cut Norelco system caused some kind of swelling.      Bottom line is that the Norelco gives a closer shave.  I wish it had a Turbo Cleaning system.  The Titanium is still a good value however and seems like a solid shaver.  I had to give it 4 starts since it seems like a quality product for the money but that lift and cut system by Norelco gives me what I want most, a close shave.</li>
    <li> I used this shaver every day for the full 30 day trial period and found that it still required a lot of effort to get a decent shave.  Achieving a close-enough shave required applying more pressure which in turn caused irritation. Even on the thirtieth day, the shave took seven minutes.  I then passed over my face lightly with my old Remington Intercept and took off a significant amount of hair!.  &lt;BR&gt;I thought the self-cleaning would be a great time-saving feature but with my old Intercept I could shave and clean up in half the time of just shaving with the 9500.&lt;BR&gt;I didn&#x27;t realize just how much damage I was doing to my face until I splashed on aftershave -- major burning with the 9500, none with the Intercept.</li>
    <li> I love this product, especially the self cleaning.  Very easy to use and keeps the charge for a long time.</li>
