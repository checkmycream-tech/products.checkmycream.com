      <li>This has to be the best hair product there is.</li>
      <li>wonderful stuff.</li>
      <li>J.R. Liggetts Shampoo is the best shampoo out there.</li>
      <li>It works best for my hair.</li>
      <li>This product is ideal for your hair period.</li>
      <li>Lathers great and a bar lasts over a month for me.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for travel, too.  </li>
      <li>Great price.  </li>
      <li>Great product (I have been using it for years).  </li>
      <li>Even better than being a wonderful shampoo, there&#x27;s no bottle so no additional plastic goes into the system.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Environmentally wise: one bar &#x3D;</li>
      <li>Really good stuff.</li>
      <li>LOVE that my husband and I can wash our hair without plastic!</li>
      <li>Love this formula!</li>
      <li>When it dries it feels amazing and stays that way for days.</li>
      <li>, so shipping is more efficient, packaging is just a piece of paper, it&#x27;s lighter.&lt;br /&gt;Feels good on your scalp.  </li>
      <li>Works fine, comes to a good lather, and I love that it spares the planet of a plastic bottle or two, not to mention the chemicals from the plastic not leaching into the product.</li>
      <li>sometimes more.  </li>
      <li>I love this soap and keep buying it.</li>
      <li>Great shampoo, was suggested by my cousin to use bar shampoos as it does not strip hair of natural oil and isn&#x27;t as harmful as the shampoos used today are.</li>
      <li>Since I&#x27;ve started using J.R. Liggett&#x27;s, my hair has been much more soft and healthy.</li>
      <li>full size shamppo bottle-</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s completely worth it.</li>
      <li>Not only is it better for the environment (the packaging is more earth-friendly than regular plastic shampoo bottles), it&#x27;s also better for my hair.</li>
      <li>Since then I have had no hair problems and rarely even need conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>What&#x27;s not to love: natural-</li>
      <li>Feels good knowing that I&#x27;m not putting all that other junk in my hair.</li>
      <li>My hair is usually frizzy but after a wash, my hair feels great with no flyaways.</li>
      <li>i have fine hair and a sensitive scalp</li>
      <li>This is the first brand I tried and haven&#x27;t tried another since.</li>
      <li>I first started buying J.R. Liggett&#x27;s shampoo about three years ago.</li>
      <li>and I still haven&#x27;t used up my first bar.</li>
      <li>so it does take me a few minutes to work up a good lather</li>
      <li>It lasts a long time and cleans well...much better than the detergent brands.</li>
      <li>Fast deliver.  </li>
      <li>If people only knew how easy it is to look after your hair instead of buying all that expensive, beautifully packaged shampoo and conditioner.</li>
      <li>At first I was skeptical about going &amp;#34;no shampoo&amp;#34; but now I&#x27;m happy I did.</li>
      <li>Liggett&#x27;s shampoo bar keeps my hair clean longer than traditional shampoos as well.</li>
      <li>My hair is healthier, thicker, easier to manage, and I love that I&#x27;m no longer washing tons of chemicals down the drain.</li>
      <li>I love this shampoo not going back to regular shampoo</li>
      <li>It really cleans the hair well and leaves it soft and manageable.</li>
      <li>not at all recommended for use if you are having issues because of chemotherapy or just have a sensitive scalp.</li>
      <li>Regular shampoo makes my hair dry out really quickly.</li>
      <li>I like this soap, just wish it would be bigger in size, though it last long enough and easy to take on the road.</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need much, so it lasts a long time, and this 3 pack saves a lot!</li>
      <li>This product has made my hair bouncy and soft in a way that traditional shampoo has never done.</li>

    <li> Love this formula! It works best for my hair. My hair is usually frizzy but after a wash, my hair feels great with no flyaways. Feels good knowing that I&#x27;m not putting all that other junk in my hair.</li>
    <li> Works fine, comes to a good lather, and I love that it spares the planet of a plastic bottle or two, not to mention the chemicals from the plastic not leaching into the product. You might or might not still want to use some conditoner.</li>
    <li> Even better than being a wonderful shampoo, there&#x27;s no bottle so no additional plastic goes into the system.</li>
    <li> Wonderful shampoo. Works in our hard water. Don&#x27;t need conditioner. No noticeable build-up. LOVE that my husband and I can wash our hair without plastic!</li>
    <li> i have fine hair and a sensitive scalp so, this one ended up being given away.  not at all recommended for use if you are having issues because of chemotherapy or just have a sensitive scalp.</li>
    <li> I like this soap, just wish it would be bigger in size, though it last long enough and easy to take on the road.</li>
    <li> I love this soap and keep buying it. It really cleans the hair well and leaves it soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> I bought three of these bars a couple months ago and I still haven&#x27;t used up my first bar. They last quite a while especially since when you stop using chemical packed shampoos you don&#x27;t have to wash your hair as often. I wash mine every 4 to 5 days. At first I was skeptical about going &amp;#34;no shampoo&amp;#34; but now I&#x27;m happy I did. My hair is healthier, thicker, easier to manage, and I love that I&#x27;m no longer washing tons of chemicals down the drain. Plus I no longer have to use conditioner. My hair has a completely different feel when I finish rinsing in the shower, it no longer feels thin and/or slimy. When it dries it feels amazing and stays that way for days. My hair is thick and very curly so it does take me a few minutes to work up a good lather but it&#x27;s completely worth it.</li>
    <li> best shampoo ever. I have gone over to this from the bottle shampoos and my hair and scalp are thanking me for it. Lathers great and a bar lasts over a month for me. Really good stuff. All I will use now.</li>
    <li> wonderful stuff. hard to find.</li>
    <li> J.R. Liggetts Shampoo is the best shampoo out there. It lasts a long time and cleans well...much better than the detergent brands.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo, was suggested by my cousin to use bar shampoos as it does not strip hair of natural oil and isn&#x27;t as harmful as the shampoos used today are. This is the first brand I tried and haven&#x27;t tried another since. 5/5 stars excellent product . One note is it does hurt quite a bit if it gets in your eyes</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for years.  Until I started using this shampoo I had flaky scalp.  Since then I have had no hair problems and rarely even need conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are times when I am either sailing or camping.  If there is water restrictions, this is the shampoo to use.  It rinses out in very little water.  It&#x27;s great for travel, too.  No messing with TSA.  One bar lasts me about a month...sometimes more.  I have told a few friends about it and they are now converts.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo not going back to regular shampoo</li>
    <li> This product has made my hair bouncy and soft in a way that traditional shampoo has never done. Liggett&#x27;s shampoo bar keeps my hair clean longer than traditional shampoos as well.</li>
    <li> I had used this before, but this soap really dried my hair out and seemed to be very harsh rather than natural.  I would not buy again.</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s not to love: natural- historic method of making soap and shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;All natural, minimal ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;No Laurel sulfate, or other poisonous chemicals&lt;br /&gt;Environmentally wise: one bar &#x3D; full size shamppo bottle- contains no liquid, so shipping is more efficient, packaging is just a piece of paper, it&#x27;s lighter.&lt;br /&gt;Feels good on your scalp.  TSA doesn&#x27;t consider it, b/c it&#x27;s a solid, not liquid.</li>
    <li> Great product (I have been using it for years).  Great price.  Fast deliver.  The triple crown!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for a year or so. I&#x27;m very happy with the results. You don&#x27;t need much, so it lasts a long time, and this 3 pack saves a lot!</li>
    <li> This has to be the best hair product there is. If people only knew how easy it is to look after your hair instead of buying all that expensive, beautifully packaged shampoo and conditioner. I cannot ever see myself using anything else. This product is ideal for your hair period.</li>
    <li> I bought these to get away from plastic containers of shampoo but the shampoo is a bit harsh and I have a sensitive scalp. Also, the shampoo is a bit harsh on your hair too.</li>
    <li> I first started buying J.R. Liggett&#x27;s shampoo about three years ago. Now it&#x27;s all I use. Not only is it better for the environment (the packaging is more earth-friendly than regular plastic shampoo bottles), it&#x27;s also better for my hair. Regular shampoo makes my hair dry out really quickly. Since I&#x27;ve started using J.R. Liggett&#x27;s, my hair has been much more soft and healthy. Also, I don&#x27;t need to use conditioner anymore-- another plus!</li>
