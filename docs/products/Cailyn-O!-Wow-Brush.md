      <li>I&#x27;m planning to get a couple more</li>
      <li>so I mostly attribute the problem to user error.</li>
      <li>I have recommended it to many friends, who also love it.  </li>
      <li>I will say this though, my beauty blender works better with RCMA.</li>
      <li>Love this brush,...lokked for it at the Cailyn web.</li>
      <li>I have since bought two more; one for my travel case and a spare.</li>
      <li>Love it.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m joining the chorus of all who&#x27;ve written to say they love this makeup brush.</li>
      <li>brush is fantastic!</li>
      <li>I LOVE this makeup brush.</li>
      <li>You do have to watch for streaks and make sure to work you product around.</li>
      <li>Love it...</li>
      <li>Love this brush.</li>
      <li>but truly stunning with mineral powder.</li>
      <li>When applied with this brush, my makeup looks smooth and there is full coverage, even a nice application on the sides of the nose.</li>
      <li>really smooth application of my makeup.  </li>
      <li>Makeup goes on so smooth leaving no pores exposed.  </li>
      <li>Well worth it!</li>
      <li>I clean it by placing in a mug with dilute Dawn dishwashing soap.</li>
      <li>&amp;#34;O Wow&amp;#34; brush is right!  </li>
      <li>The only downside is that I have to clean it after each use or it wouldn&#x27;t work that good</li>
      <li>It looks so cool too.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s velvety soft, blends my makeup to a flawless finish, fits easily into tight areas such as under-eye-top-of-nose and eyelid, is easy to clean, lightweight, flexible and yet very strong, and comes with a protective cover.</li>
      <li>Cap is super helpful.</li>
      <li>I use a liquid foundation that I was using a sponge to spread, but it did have streaking issues if done quickly.  </li>
      <li>AS ADVERTISED, SOOOOO SOFT LOVE IT</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t seem to have the handle breaking issues that plagued the mac brush and the price was right</li>
      <li>It gives my makeup a nice smooth finish in a couple minutes without my hands getting messy.  </li>
      <li>WOW!&amp;quot; the first time you use it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I bought one for my daughter and she really likes it also!</li>
      <li>Really spreads liquid foundation with ease and perfection!</li>
      <li>The bristles are way beyond fine and soft, giving them the ability to distribute makeup very evenly.</li>
      <li>For instance, I use bare minerals, and either I am using too light of a color, or using to much, which I never had this problem before with my kabuki brushes?  </li>
      <li>This brush really does make a difference.</li>
      <li>It really does give an airbrush like finish.</li>
      <li>Softer than the softest brush I have ever previously used - wonderful with ordinary cream foundation...</li>
      <li>My face seems to be extremely light with a powdery look, not nearly as natural, and yes I am still tapping the excess off before placing on my face.</li>
      <li>After many hundreds of dollars later, I was still having the same issue.</li>
      <li>they are VERY soft and feel nothing like a toothbrush.</li>
      <li>It is velvety soft and never streaks, can be used under eyes, and gives an airbrushed finish.</li>
      <li>They are THAT soft.</li>
      <li>Extremenly soft bristles.  </li>
      <li>Extremely reasonable priced for such a quality makeup accessory.  </li>
      <li>Oh Wow brush.</li>
      <li>wow brushes and tossing the rest.</li>
      <li>I would even dare say the brush is as gentle on skin as a wet sponge.</li>
      <li>My only hesitation is that I am not sure I am actually getting it clean by soaking it .</li>
      <li>Make up looks so much smoother and enables you to use less.</li>
      <li>but it does place a little too much on your face in one place.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I LOVE this makeup brush. I saw it at the Birmingham hair show and just had to have one. I use it for my liquid foundation and I can&#x27;t go back to any brush or sponge I used to use!</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;O Wow&amp;#34; brush is right!  Love it!  Really spreads liquid foundation with ease and perfection!</li>
    <li> Came dirty and without the protective cap that is included.  Disappointed with that. I sanitized it, and tried the brush, works well.  Just wished that I had gotten a new one, not a used one with missing pieces.</li>
    <li> Great-gives a very smooth texture to your face-easy to get into creases of nose etc.  I bought one for my daughter and she really likes it also!</li>
    <li> I dare you not to say &amp;quot;O! WOW!&amp;quot; the first time you use it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush is fantastic! I&#x27;ve never used anything like it. It applies foundations, powders, concealers, flawlessly and easily. I wish I would have found this brush ages ago. It would have saved me a ton of money buying the many brushes I do not use because they just don&#x27;t do a good job. I&#x27;m planning to get a couple more o! wow brushes and tossing the rest.</li>
    <li> feels like silk gliding across your face! Shape is genius for eye and nose area. Cap is super helpful. Get it!</li>
    <li> Very disappointed it&#x27;s like using a tooth brush on your face.</li>
    <li> Love this brush,...lokked for it at the Cailyn web. and they no longer have it,...great at putting on liquid foundation.&lt;br /&gt;At MAC this brush cost alot more!</li>
    <li> This brush feels amazing! It is the softest one I&#x27;ve ever tried, makeup applies great, gives an airbrush finish, definitely worth the price. The only downside is that I have to clean it after each use or it wouldn&#x27;t work that good</li>
    <li> Awesome make up brush</li>

    <li> What a spectacular piece of kit! Softer than the softest brush I have ever previously used - wonderful with ordinary cream foundation...but truly stunning with mineral powder. One use of this brush in the morning, and you don&#x27;t actually need to fiddle with your face again all day. Marvellous. It looks so cool too.</li>
    <li> Very good came in a good way good service and perfect quality</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m joining the chorus of all who&#x27;ve written to say they love this makeup brush. In my opinion, it&#x27;s the very best by far. It&#x27;s velvety soft, blends my makeup to a flawless finish, fits easily into tight areas such as under-eye-top-of-nose and eyelid, is easy to clean, lightweight, flexible and yet very strong, and comes with a protective cover. I use this brush daily and am on Amazon now to buy a second one to put into my travel makeup case.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS THING!!!!!  Love love love it!!!  Extremely reasonable priced for such a quality makeup accessory.  Buy it - you won&#x27;t regret it at all!!!  In fact, you&#x27;ll probably end up ordering more :o)</li>
    <li> I use this brush for my BB cream.  It gives my makeup a nice smooth finish in a couple minutes without my hands getting messy.  It has been a great addition to my morning routine.</li>
    <li> This brush really does make a difference. It really does give an airbrush like finish. I&#x27;ve never tried anything else quite like it. The bristles are way beyond fine and soft, giving them the ability to distribute makeup very evenly. Expensive but worth it. Only wish they also made a smaller one for very tight spaces.</li>
    <li> really smooth application of my makeup.  Extremenly soft bristles.  Small footprint on the counter</li>

    <li> This brush is unbelievable! Makeup application is not easy for me, so this brush is a lifesaver! When applied with this brush, my makeup looks smooth and there is full coverage, even a nice application on the sides of the nose. It works well with my liquid makeup. I will never go back to applying makeup any other way!</li>
    <li> I received this as a gift from a girlfriend who discovered it on vacation. I use a liquid foundation that I was using a sponge to spread, but it did have streaking issues if done quickly.  I don&#x27;t have a lot of time to spend in the morning for makeup application, and this brush gives me a FLAWLESS finish in seconds!  It is velvety soft and never streaks, can be used under eyes, and gives an airbrushed finish. I have recommended it to many friends, who also love it.  I have since bought two more; one for my travel case and a spare. I clean it by placing in a mug with dilute Dawn dishwashing soap. I let it soak for a few minutes, give it a little shampoo, rinse well, and let it dry by placing next to an air conditioning vent.</li>
    <li> I use my mac liquid foundation with this brush and it does get spread nicely. You do have to watch for streaks and make sure to work you product around. I bought it on a whim after seeing an ad for a much more expensive brush. This one was the most reasonably priced with the best reviews. Well worth it!</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing. I&#x27;d been having issues with NUMEROUS foundations either settling into my pores or not giving me enough coverage. In addition to the plethora of foundations I&#x27;ve been trying, I&#x27;d bought every manner of foundation brush thinking my beauty blender could possibly be the culprit. After many hundreds of dollars later, I was still having the same issue. This topic came up in convo with some girlfriends and one of them said they swore by the mac number 6 oval brush. I went online to order one only to discover they were no longer producing the brush. Further research brought me to Cailyn&#x27;s Oh Wow brush. It didn&#x27;t seem to have the handle breaking issues that plagued the mac brush and the price was right so I ordered one. It, honestly, has been the best cosmetic purchase I have made in several years. I will say this though, my beauty blender works better with RCMA. Even when thinned the foundation application was a tad streaky. RCMA can be tricky to work with so I mostly attribute the problem to user error. Buy this brush. You won&#x27;t regret it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh! The bristles...they are VERY soft and feel nothing like a toothbrush. I would even dare say the brush is as gentle on skin as a wet sponge. Yes. They are THAT soft.</li>
    <li> Love it...it works as described. Flawless makeup application.  My only hesitation is that I am not sure I am actually getting it clean by soaking it .</li>
    <li> I like it but it does place a little too much on your face in one place.  You have to learn to layer your make up.  For instance, I use bare minerals, and either I am using too light of a color, or using to much, which I never had this problem before with my kabuki brushes?  My face seems to be extremely light with a powdery look, not nearly as natural, and yes I am still tapping the excess off before placing on my face. So for now I am using it only for a blusher brush, and using my kabuki for the foundation.</li>
