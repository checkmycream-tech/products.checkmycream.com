      <li>I love this product it good to wear almost everyday.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re my new favorite hair accessory.</li>
      <li>a bit to get here, but worth it.&lt;br /&gt;They are really worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
      <li>Kind of fragile and</li>
      <li>I got two right hands :l</li>

      <li>Cute but fragile.</li>
      <li>They even hold my unruly hair back, and they will stay unless removed or forcibly jostled.</li>
      <li>As soon as Im able, Im buying the white ones.</li>
      <li>I can probably fix it with a hot glue gun.</li>
      <li>One of mine broke the first time I used it.</li>
      <li>I was surprised by the quality, since they are so cheap.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I got two right hands :l</li>
    <li> One of mine broke the first time I used it. But nothing a little glue cant fix.</li>
    <li> cute but broke right away</li>
    <li> I love my pair! They&#x27;re perfect and I wear them every day. As soon as Im able, Im buying the white ones. Tottally recomended, though treat with care.</li>
    <li> Very cute and work nicely. Hands are pretty big than I expected but I love the size. I wanna say about 2 inches at the longest length? But I am taking a star off because I didn&#x27;t get black I got white when I ordered black. Other than that worth the money and ordered a whole bunch and going to buy even more soon.</li>
    <li> Just came in today and they were perfect! Super sturdy and very very cute.</li>
    <li> Kind-of made cheaply.</li>
    <li> It came as described.</li>
    <li> Ive had to hot glue the hand back on the clip twice now but its no prob, its worth it!</li>
    <li> These are very cute! Also sturdy! I was surprised by the quality, since they are so cheap. My only quip is my pair had two identical rather than opposite hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to order a pair in green or white.</li>
    <li> They are amazing. Arrived weeks earlier than it said, super cute, and very sturdy. They have a clip with teeth so they stay! They even hold my unruly hair back, and they will stay unless removed or forcibly jostled. I love them!</li>
    <li> It was cute but brake very fast , it wont stick in my hair and hold , it will stick to a stan and hang there and dangles</li>
    <li> The clip is cheap, I had to Re glue it back together but it&#x27;s still cute to wear for halloween</li>
    <li> i got mine! and i adore them, the clip part however is a bit small but i wear these with one of my wigs or just in my hair and i get tons of compliments, they look amazing and dont irrate me at all. (some clips tend to be annoying) i love how these look, feel and just ahh im so happy. an d for 3 dollars?! how could you not want these</li>
    <li> These would be great except the photo shows opposite hands but I got two of the same in my package so now if I try to wear both one is always upside down.</li>
    <li> These are amazing and great in size. I love the way they look in my hair and I always get amazing compliments.</li>
    <li> i got these today and they came way faster than expected, theyre very cute and the right size that i expected, i cant wait to wear these and will buy more!</li>
    <li> They weren&#x27;t black. The only downside cause I bought the white ones at the mall and these came in and they were white :/</li>
    <li> Adorable,&lt;br /&gt;Took a bit to get here, but worth it.&lt;br /&gt;They are really worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the clips are a bit hard to arrange, and they get caught and covered in my hair, and they at a bit fragile.&lt;br /&gt;Would buy again.</li>
    <li> One of the hands arrived with a broken finger. Will try to superglue it, Will make a great accessory for halloween pirate costume I plan to wear. Larger than I thought they would be.</li>
    <li> I want these in every color. Mine arrived unharmed (during the shipping process). I know other people had the clips snap off of the skull hands but I&#x27;ve been wearing these almost daily and have yet to have that problem (I got lucky!). Even if the clips pop off I&#x27;ll just hot glue them back on and continue wearing them. Overall, great price, cute, unique, and will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I recently cut my hair short and was looking for some cute clips to go with my new style, these clips currently do the job.The clips are well made so saying that I&#x27;m not disappointed. :)</li>
    <li> Very cute, on time and good quality! :D</li>
    <li> Very well made, super glued on, but still very secure. Got in both black with white and white with black.</li>
    <li> I have these in black and in white &amp; I get compliments on them every time I wear them! They&#x27;re a good size and stay in all day.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s cheap and cute but the clip keeps coming off. at least i can hot glue it back on but still it&#x27;s annoying</li>
    <li> One of the clips was not glued on when I received the package.  They&#x27;re still super cute - I just was planning on having to re-glue my hair clips.</li>
    <li> Very cute, arrived in one piece, but I will say that taking.them out of your hair can be painful because tufts can get caught between the clip itself and the plastic design and getting it out can hurt.</li>
    <li> I like the clips, they add a nice touch to my outfits. I did have a small problem with one of the fingers breaking off (most likely my own doing though), quick fix with super glue and I can&#x27;t even tell where it broke now(:</li>
    <li> A simple and cute clip for the cute / &#x27;goth&#x27; / &#x27;emo&#x27; / &#x27;scene&#x27; / &#x27;pastel goth&#x27; / etc.image, and I&#x27;ve received many compliments from strangers where I work c:  A bit bigger than what I expected (size of my pointer finger / 2 inches ) , but it&#x27;s not a tragedy and doesn&#x27;t stop me from wearing them almost every day c:</li>
    <li> Very adorable, everyone loves them ♥. My only complaint is they break soooo easily. I&#x27;ve had them for two days and 4 fingers already broke</li>
    <li> I love these clips. The only issue is the clip had come off the hand when I got it but some hot glue and its an easy fix.</li>
    <li> These are really cool and came fast too, they are the perfect size and the color I ordered. The only problem seems to be the clip, one of them seems to already be coming off and might probably get damaged soon, but nothing I can&#x27;t fix, I can just grab another hairclip&#x27;s clip and attach it to the skull hand. Other than that, it&#x27;s really good for the price!</li>
    <li> Very cute! Kind of fragile and the clip isn&#x27;t the most comfortable.</li>
    <li> Super cute and looks exactly as it is in the picture.</li>
    <li> Love these! They are adorable and the clips stay in well... One thing I noticed; be very careful! They are glued on and if dropped the clip can break right off, I&#x27;ve had to super glue one already, but if anything that shows how much i like them. For $2 bucks, (and a dollar for super glue) i have certainly gotten my moneys worth. Plus they arrived very quickly, which is also a bonus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all I&#x27;m pretty satisfied</li>
    <li> I bought the white ones and I decided I wanted black too...2 came in the package but one ring finger came broke off but was easily fixed with clear nailpolish</li>
    <li> These are sooo cute. They stay in your hair nicely and are made well. The  only thing I didn&#x27;t like was how long it took to get them.</li>
    <li> there how i imagined them except the clip is smaller and more annoying to work with than i would hope. but for the price they are wonderful.</li>
    <li> Really nice. Probably the best thing I got for my hair ever. Just I got two right clips.</li>
    <li> Very cute but break easily.</li>
    <li> hold well loooks great. ill be getting more colors</li>
    <li> Very cute but doesn&#x27;t clip very good</li>
    <li> very cute skeleton hand hair clips. rather flimsy. one was broken when they arrived but I was able the fix it easily. worth the little bit of money I paid.</li>
    <li> cute but break way too easily.</li>
    <li> Really like them, they seem to be good quality. My only complaint is the alligator clasp catches my hair more than they normally do.</li>
    <li> Cute but fragile. Easy fix as well.</li>
    <li> My two clips arrived not only WAY late but they were both SHATTERED. Broken into tiny pieces that couldn&#x27;t even be glued back together. Awful.</li>
    <li> I bought two pairs. One was ok, the second had two of the same hand and one of the fingers was broken</li>
    <li> absolutely love these, very nice clips, very impressed. .</li>
    <li> Cute but broke off after just a couple wears.</li>
    <li> The clips on it came all crooked. I love how they look but it&#x27;s difficult to put in my hair if the clips don&#x27;t align each other. They kept slipping off and I get frustrated and just took them off. They look nice but overall, very poorly made but then again, it was les then two bucks.</li>
    <li> The clips to put these on are a bit cheap and difficult to clasp on but I love these with pigtails. They&#x27;re my new favorite hair accessory.</li>
    <li> I love this product it good to wear almost everyday. its the best and i will continue to get more items like this</li>
    <li> Love these, Ive had them for a while and their holding up great, as well as look great.</li>
    <li> Took them out of the package and the hair clip came off..I can probably fix it with a hot glue gun. They&#x27;re really cute, just.be prepared to &#x27;re- glue the hand to the clip.</li>
    <li> I like this a lot and it came fast too! The only thing is I dropped it once and one of the fingers snapped off, not very sturdy but they were also very cheap so you get what you pay for. Also the clip is very small and a little hard to keep in place. Still very cool though and I get a lot of compliments on them. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Looks just like the one posted in her. Really love it!</li>
    <li> I love them! They clip in easy and they stay REALLY well! The only problem i ran into is one of the little clippy bits happened to be bent out of shape, but that was very easily fixed with some pliers. (Or possibly fingers, but I have really weak hands.)</li>
    <li> I love these clips! Sadly they weren&#x27;t black like the picture shown which was a disappointment.</li>
    <li> Are cute, but half of my 6 piece order was broken. I had to reglue the hands to the hair clip.</li>
    <li> The metal clips come off of the skeleton hands so easily! I&#x27;ve had to be creative with using glue to fix them! Still very cute!</li>
    <li> I love them. They&#x27;re extremely cute. I highly recommend buying this product.</li>
    <li> Took awhile to come but that was excepted because it came from China. Love them. They are so cute and work well.</li>
