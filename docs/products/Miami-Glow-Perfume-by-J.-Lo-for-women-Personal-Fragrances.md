<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Smells fresh and clean. Was a good buy for the money.</li>
    <li> I bought this item August 2011- so granted the product is almost 2 years old.  At this point the fragrance doesn&#x27;t last more than ten minutes before it completely fades.  The last one I had lasted for a lot longer.  I love this scent and it became my signature scent but I wouldn&#x27;t order this one here.</li>
    <li> The smell is nice once you get used to it, but the smell just isn&#x27;t potent and disappears almost immediately! I spray and spray and still my husband has to get right up to my neck to be able to smell it! Won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> I love it! My fav perfume.... Fast and prompt service! Thank you!! I will order again soon!!</li>
    <li> Can I give this five more stars!!!! I love this scent. I&#x27;m going to order more soon.</li>
    <li> This item was delivered extremely quickly.  I love this scent it is very adult and sexy, not so sweet and candyish.</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading all the positive reviews, but when I got the item, I really dislike the smell and it gives me a head ache.  I can&#x27;t even return it even though it was through Amazon Prime, because it is apparently classified as either a hazardous material or use flammable liquid.  I am really at a loss as to how to get a refund or what I should do</li>
    <li> I love all things tropical so was drawn in by the reviews describing this as a summer scent. The bottle I received smells really gross, one other review said &amp;#34;nail polish remover&amp;#34; type smell and that is what I thought of too. It was strong with staying power which was negative in this case. Such a bummer.</li>
    <li> smells floral and fruity, reminds me of the summer and the beach.</li>
    <li> Great scent that lasts all day. Better than more expensive products I have tried. I always go back to this perfume!</li>
    <li> thanks to amazon i can now smell fab again since i am unable to hunt this down in any store. arrived exactly how it should in the perfect time frame \\&quot;)</li>
    <li> Love this perfume, this is a summery fragrance a day at the beach... In mid winter gives a boost to get thru a miserable snowy day... Close your eyes you can smell the salty air, feel the mist hitting your skin, clinging to your hair...hmmm summer time. Jlo hit the mark with this fragrance omg this is the best...</li>
    <li> I love this scent. this price in unbeatable and I have allergies and the JLO glows are great for me!</li>
    <li> Love miami glow &amp; amazon has been only place I can find</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of all JLO perfumes. When I first smelled Miami Glow, I fell in love with it. I usually only wear it in the summertime, so my bottle has lasted several years. To sum up the smell- it is a light &#x27;beachy&#x27; smell. Every time I wear it, it reminds me of the beach.</li>
    <li> Love it last all day and came super fast !!!!! So in love</li>
    <li> excellent product, what I expected no complaints about it</li>
    <li> I love this perfume and have been buying it for years. Best price was on Amazon</li>
    <li> fast delivery and great price!</li>
    <li> This is a great smell.  I get compliments all the time.  I am so sad they dicontinued it.  Thanks for having it, I looked everywhere!</li>
    <li> I have to be honest, I&#x27;m not really a fan. I bought this blindly, so I knew that there would be a chance of me disliking this perfume, but after reading so many positive reviews and seeing the cheap price tag, I just went for it. The scent is very light... almost faint, which I don&#x27;t really care for, and it fades SUPER fast! The smell itself isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; but it&#x27;s not at all like I was expecting. I would agree that it is a summer scent, as it does have that beachy/earthy type of scent, and the bottle is very cute. That being said, I would not repurchase nor recommend. It&#x27;s just not me.</li>
    <li> This perfume is amazing and for such a great price on here!</li>
    <li> LOVE THE BEACHY SMELL :)</li>
    <li> Love this perfume one of my favorites an my oder got here fast I love love love amazon</li>
    <li> One of my favorite scents of all time- and discontinued! So I stocked up via Amazon and have been sooo happy with my new stock of Miami Glow.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok, would buy it again</li>
    <li> My favorite perfume! I am complimented daily and as a Prime member, I got it at the lowest price I&#x27;ve ever paid per bottle, so I was able to buy 3! Very happy customer!</li>
    <li> I bought this after seeing great reviews of it on YouTube. I am sorry, but it does not smell beachy at all. There is no coconut smell or other summer scents. What I do smell is aftershave cologne. It smells just like a man.  I don&#x27;t want to smell like a guy.</li>
    <li> love love this perfume</li>
    <li> Great perfume - fantastic scent!!! Absolutely must buy, I will keep buying new bottles of this, one of my all time favorites!! Barely found in stores so online is the best way to go.</li>
    <li> I just discovered this scent at the drugstore, and I was sad to here it&#x27;s discontinued.  It was $50 at the store, and I ordered it as soon as I found it here, being half price and all, and then I was even more surprised that this bottle is twice as big as the one at the store!    The scent lasts a while and smells great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a little disappointed with this product.  I was expecting a feminine, tropical scent.  Everyone described it as summery and fresh, and even soapy so I figured it&#x27;d be clean, tropical scent. To me, it&#x27;s none of these.  It&#x27;s a sweet musky scent and smells almost manly.  It reminds me of JLo&#x27;s Deseo, which had sweet and tropical top notes but smelled like a man at the end of the day.  Ick.  Not for me.  On top of that, it&#x27;s not returnable which is NOT stated when you order it via the mobile version of Amazon.  I won&#x27;t be buying perfume again via Amazon!</li>
    <li> Love this perfume and always receive compliments when I wear it.</li>
    <li> Let me just start by saying that people who have mentioned that this secent does not smell beachy or like summer are incorrect.&lt;br /&gt;I believe their noses are broken. This scent is amazing &amp; the absolute all-time, epic summer scent. Guys LOVE this scent and so does everyone who comes near you when you are wearng it. Dont believe me? buy it and see for yourself. Nothing current is better smelling than this scent for summer.I am a very picky woman and I am a scent snob. Believe me when I say you must have this.</li>
    <li> This has always been one of my favorite perfumes and i haven&#x27;t been able to find it in a store for years. If you like a tropical sweet sexy smell this is the perfect. So happy i was able to find it again!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. The seller was pleasant and quick at getting me the J.LO Miami Glow Eau de toilette. It&#x27;s smells great and it lingers all day.</li>
    <li> Irrisistable perfume, Clean, Makes you feel special and elegant. One of the perfumes that I would wear at all times and would not hesitate to buy again and again. Worth the money you pay for.</li>
    <li> This is a must buy. It smells like summer and happiness. big bottle nice size, great price. will buy again. you wont regret it, I&#x27;m extremely picky with perfumes and this is my #1 fav</li>
    <li> A great new sent.  Thanks JLO.</li>
    <li> One of my Favorite by her and so glad I found it!!!!</li>
    <li> Totally love this perfume, very pretty smell.  It&#x27;s a grown up perfume not overly flowery and sweet..more of an exotic smell</li>
    <li> This fragrance is great,  loved it for years.  I suddenly could not find it and thought it was discontinued from the line.  When I saw it on Amazon I ordered 2 bottles and was happy to see the fragrance was as great as before BUT I do notice it does not last as long as before.</li>
    <li> Love thus scent!!! Fast shipping</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite perfumes.  I always get compliments on it.  It&#x27;s a very sexy scent.</li>
    <li> came exactly as discribed by seller just as if u bought it in a department store smells amazeing!!! my very favorite scent by her next to Glow</li>
    <li> I took to Amazon since it&#x27;s hard to find this scent in stores (I don&#x27;t think they make it anymore?).  I bought it as a gfit, and when they received it, they loved it. The price is great too! Shipping was quick and arrived on time in original packaging and the original box. Smells great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this scent a couple of years back and was sad to find out that it was hard to find after they had discontinued it, and if I did find it, it cost around $40. I was happy to find it on amazon for half that prize so I bought two! Love this scent, it&#x27;s my signature scent and I wear it everyday!</li>
    <li> I LIKE THE QUALITY, I LIKE THE FIT, EVERYTHING WAS GOOD EXCEPT THAT THE SIZE IS LITTLE BIGGER THAN I WAS EXPECTING, I RECOMMEND TO HAVE BETTER DEMONSTRATION AND DETAILS FOR THE SIZE OF THE GOODS NOT ONLY GENERAL SIZE DETAILS BECAUSE MOST OF THE TIMES THE CLOTHES COME IN DIFFERENT CUTS AND DIFFERENT FITS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TALKING ABOUT QUALITY AND SERVICE, SUPER!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I WOULD LIKE TO GIVE MY OPINION ON THE SIPPING PART. SOMETIMES WHEN I BUY GOODS ON AMAZON, I GET PART OF THE GOODS SHIPPED IN THE FIRST PLACE WHILE THE OTHER PART TAKES TIME TO PREPARE IT FOR THE NEXT SHIPMENT WHICH IS COSTING ME MORE MONEY REGARDING TAX, SHIPPING AND CUSTOM FEES. I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE ALL MY GOODS SHIPPED SAME TIME EVEN IF I HAVE TO WAIT COUPLE OF DAYS MORE TO PREPARE THE PACKAGE AS A WHOLE.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite. I use it frequently but it isn&#x27;t easy to find at times. I like getting this larger size &amp; the price wasn&#x27;t bad. The smell gives a slight reminder of the beach.</li>
    <li> my wife uses it a lot</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t believe the price was so low. Have bought this many times and payed way more. I Love the perfume any way. But, the price made it awesome</li>
    <li> It&#x27;y favorite only one I wear</li>
    <li> I originally bought this perfume on a cruise.  I asked the clerk for a scent that would remind me of the cruise, ocean, tropics and a wonderful time and she recommended this.  She hit the nail on the head!  Every time I smell this fragrance now it takes me back to a wonderful Caribbean vacation.  The scent is clean but sexy and not super sweet.  I&#x27;m sorry it&#x27;s so hard to find in stores though!</li>
    <li> Smells as great as I remember! The perfect summer sexy scent!  Long lasting as well.</li>
    <li> Perfect!!!!!!!!Fast to deliver!!!!  I am buying my 2nd one!! I recommend to all my friends !! Supre happy w my perfume!!!</li>
    <li> Very sexy fragrance if you love citrus.</li>
    <li> totally smells like a laundry detergent to me. A nice one (I cant quite put my finger on the specific one) but it definitely has that detergent smell to it. In my opinion anyways and I am a big fan of anything that smells good.</li>
    <li> Great summertime fragrance!  Lots of compliments on this fresh scent!  Comes in a few sizes - one small enough to pass TSA!</li>
    <li> Fav smell glad I can still get it online. I have it on now trying not to use it every day.  But I&#x27;ve it so much</li>
    <li> I first tried this scent about 10 years ago and I still keep it on my dresser for summer nights. Perfect seasonal perfume after a hot day at the beach.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this scent before and it smells &#x27;effin&#x27; awesome!!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume, I absolutely love the sweet smell!!!and just love how its like a oil substance it lasts on you all day!! :)</li>
    <li> Love this perfume.  I have used it before and now it is hard to find.  So glad to have found it</li>
    <li> Fué buena la compra, en El Tiempo de lo esperado, me gusto el Producto, doy fe de la compra. producto de excelente calidad,</li>
    <li> The scent was what I am use to but I did notice this liquid seemed to evaporate faster than I could use it. Not sure I would purchase this again unless in person at a retail store.</li>
    <li> I took a chance and ordered this without having smelled it before and once again I am on the losing end of that gamble. From the other reviews I was expecting something tropical, fruity, exciting, etc. but all I smell is a boring vanilla/musk. It&#x27;s not awful it&#x27;s just not what I was hoping for or want in a fragrance.</li>
    <li> Legitimately smells like summer on the Miami beach.</li>
    <li> This perfume is great for summer. I can&#x27;t explain the scent; it&#x27;s so different from anything else. But it&#x27;s a really sexy summery perfume - after it&#x27;s been on for a while it smells so good! Lasts all day. :)</li>
    <li> So beachy! This is a year-round scent for me. It&#x27;s light, clean, and lasts a long time. I get compliments EVERY single time I wear it. :)</li>
    <li> I have no complaints. Good, fast service. Product was delivered in one piece and not damaged.</li>
    <li> Smells a little citrusy when sprayed on a sample card but on my fiancee the citrus overtones go away &amp; it smells very fresh &amp; reminds me of when we visited the Bahamas recently. Very hard to find in stores around here, we thought they had discontinued it until I stopped here thank goodness.</li>
    <li> oh what can I say about this!!!! I have sworn by this perfume for 5 years! the first time I wore it I was in love and even after trying many many different perfumes I always come back.  It literally is so beachy smelling and warm. Like Coconuts and Pina Colada&#x27;s I love it and will buy it forever.  I hope they never stop making it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this perfume and it&#x27;s impossible to find where I live. So happy I found it on Amazon, decently priced too, about half the price I had been buying for at the dept store. It came packaged and in exactly the size it shows on the screen.</li>
    <li> I bought this without ever testing it based on the fact that it was supposed to be a coconut &amp;#34;beachy&amp;#34; scent. I don&#x27;t really get too much of that at all- it has a very clean, soapy floral scent to me. There is something in it that makes it smell somewhat hot- like one reviewer noted the laundry right out of the dryer scent. A bit like hot fabric softener sheets or something. Despite it not being what I thought it is nice and not like any other perfume I own. I usually wear it with a coconut lotion and a lot of guys from work will comment on how good I smell so I guess it&#x27;s pretty pleasant. The real unanswered question isn&#x27;t the missing coconut notes but rather, why are J Lo&#x27;s perfumes banned from Catalina Island?!</li>
    <li> If you want a fresh clean smell this is your scent! I love the bottle and I get tons of compliments whenever I wear this.  So happy!</li>
    <li> A fresh, breezy, clean, tropical, warm, aquatic coconut and juicy citruses!  It opens with fresh, clean, juicy citrus and then the coconut note starts to shine through with some mild florals to give it balance.  It&#x27;s not a heavy coconut, more like a light aquatic one. It smells nothing like suntan lotion although it&#x27;s reminiscent and would smell fantastic layered over it.  This scent is so breezy and has that signature JLo soapy cleanness to it, which is perfect for a hot and humid summer day or evening.  I really think of walking along a beach on a gorgeous hot sunny day, and definately palm trees.  It&#x27;s almost a light fragrance too, like a body spray, which makes it a refreshing fragrance.  Has great lasting power and projection.  I would definitely recommend this and I would repurchase this again!</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of all JLO perfumes. When I first smelled Miami Glow, I fell in love with it. Wear it everywhere I go ,including work, with no issues.To sum up the smell- it is a light &#x27;beachy&#x27; smell. Every time I wear it, it reminds me of the beach.</li>
    <li> This came so fast and it wasn&#x27;t a fake! It&#x27;s the real deal. They don&#x27;t make this anymore so I have to find all these outside sources to get this perfume. This is by far the least expensive method and it came so quickly!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this perfume...it is one of my most favorite scents.  You will love the exotic scent of coconut.  The scent is so light.  I never pass an opportunity to add this to my collection.  A few spritzes last you all day long.  If you like a nice soft sexy scent, this is definitely for you.  You will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product and a great price for the amount</li>
    <li> Item as described. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Very inexpensive and scent stays on for a long time</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite perfumes, it has a light spicy scent, and I wear it for day or night. I think it would be suitable for women of any age (I&#x27;m over 50). Unfortunately, the scent did not seem to last as long with this bottle as those I&#x27;ve purchased in the past; I&#x27;m not sure why. 3.4 ounces is a lot of perfume, you can reapply throughout the day I guess.</li>
    <li> I love this scent, but the nozzle was broken.  Amazon quickly refunded me.</li>
    <li> Great perfume. Long lasting. Arrived in no time!</li>
    <li> I really love this perfume! It smells just enough that you smell good but not enough to stifle you or other people! Plus a little goes a long way so it will last a while!</li>
    <li> Arrived earlier than expect! And the scent in not stale(which can be a concern when ordering discontinued perfumes). Just like I remember it in the early 2000s, thanks!</li>
    <li> This has a great summer smell! I frequently get asked what I am wearing when we go out and about. It doesn&#x27;t fade quickly like other scents do. love it!</li>
    <li> i am so satified with this product, thank you.</li>
    <li> Great beachy smell.  Very light and clean.  Only negative is it wears off quickly, but at least you can get it cheap.</li>
    <li> After seeing this fragrance on clearance I decided to try it out. I really expected something more from J.Lo, not this fragrance. \\&quot;Miami Glow\\&quot; smells like baby powder - litteraly. Wasn&#x27;t even worth the $10 I spent on it! Save your money!!!</li>
    <li> This frangrance is not super expensive but my wife likes it.  What more can I say.  She is never wrong!</li>
    <li> This perfume smells so good and lasts a long time! I bought this for a friend but she loves it!</li>
    <li> this miami glow is the best jennifer lopez edu out there and let me tell you 3.4 on for $2osomething is not bad at all ,i ordered it on a monday and had it by that friday thank u</li>
    <li> Love this scent very fresh with a lasting earthy scent</li>
    <li> Was a gift for my daughter  as this is her fav scent and it is not available in my country. She loved it and is quite satisfied.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this summer scent! Great price &amp; Free shipping. I almost always wear a scent by VS, but switched over to this Miami Glow and I am not sorry! Just enough spice and the scent seems to last all day.</li>
    <li> So glad to find Miami Glow!  Loved the scent!</li>
    <li> JLO knows her stuff!  I loved this fresh scented perfume!  Now number one ...goodbye Juicy! This is why she is so in control of her career.....Bring it on!</li>
    <li> My favorite perfume of all time. I never get sick of it. I has a wonderful sweet, clean scent that I can&#x27;t get enough of.  I can only find it on amazon so I buy it about once every 9 months because I wear it everyday.  Love it, love it, love it.</li>
    <li> I first bought this locally back in 2004 or 2005 &amp; loved it--clean, fresh scent that I could wear every day.  Ordered twice now from Amazon &amp; still love the scent, though it doesn&#x27;t seem to last all day like before.</li>
    <li> Still smells as amazing as it used to, I can tell the scent doesn&#x27;t last as long as it used to though. I remember it used to last all day, now I would say maybe half a day. I love the scent of it so much though I would definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> The scent is amazing and very affordable. Every time I used this perfume I get compliments. It&#x27;s a definite must buy!</li>
    <li> Smells great, makes you feel like you&#x27;re in the tropics!</li>
    <li> everyone comments when i wear it. can&#x27;t find it in local stores anymore. will continue to purchase as long as it&#x27;s made</li>
    <li> I have been telling about J Lo perfumes, and she has many of them, but this is the one I did like. I have never been to Miami, but if is real good!</li>
    <li> Succulent, fruity, light but warm. Best for summer but I wear all year round. Not too light, not to heavy. Inviting, kind of perfect.</li>
    <li> This is my all time favorite perfume. I buy it every 2 or 3 months! I just love it</li>
    <li> Doesnt smell like it used to</li>
    <li> Beautiful fragrance, great value and speedy delivery.</li>
    <li> Each time I wear this lovely scent I get compliments.  It is light and airy and just really smells great. They had retired it for a while and brought it back.  No doubt by popular demand.  I highly recommend it</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and decided to buy this before smelling it and BIG mistake. Not summery, or beaching smell. Smells like a man&#x27;s cologne. No hint of coconut at all! Don&#x27;t ever buy perfume from Amazon as well as it is not returnable. Better off buying from frangrancenet.com so you can at least return it and don&#x27;t buy a perfume before trying it, especially this one.</li>
    <li> omg this is my favorite perfume. and this is the real stuff it is not a knock off. smells just like the one I bought at the store.</li>
    <li> Smells good refreshing</li>
    <li> I like this perfume a lot. It&#x27;s scent is different than most typical perfumes.  Has a summery feel to it.  I&#x27;ve gotten several compliments when I&#x27;ve worn it.  Good price.  It&#x27;s ashame it&#x27;s discontinued.</li>
    <li> certified perfume junkie-I dont have 1 signature scent,but all the perfumes that I love have similar qualities. I am not nor have ever&lt;br /&gt;been a fan of floral scents, and i really dont like that have a powdery not- I like zesty,warm,sensual scents that have an energetic&lt;br /&gt;vibe.buying one that is described tropical make me nervous,so many beachy described scents have TOO MUCH beach,I dont want to smell&lt;br /&gt;like a coconut.I have always liked the original glow-i use scent like aromatherapy, to elevate and express my mood for the day-when i can&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;decide -the  original Glow seems to be the one i always turn to.&lt;br /&gt;i picked up a bottle of Miami Glow at a discount store, T.J Maxx I think.Just a random impulse purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Well instantly i really liked this- it had a nice smooth fresh and warm quality- and was surprised how long lasting it is,&lt;br /&gt;well let me tell you, i found another way to wear it -first,after bathing I put Original Glow on,than I layer this on my pulse points,&lt;br /&gt;anb the results are magical.The two scents combined create this addictive,delicious,alluring vibe,it does have a summer thing going&lt;br /&gt;but there is a mysteriousness to it that you can&#x27;t quite put your finger on-I have recieved compliments on other scents I wear,but thus combo&lt;br /&gt;is like a drug,I cannot tell you how many times a man will abruptly stop and ask me what i am wearing so they cam give to their&lt;br /&gt;girlfriend?wife, and yes while its nice other people like it and comment on it, I just reallly like how it makes me feel-beautiful,vivacious&lt;br /&gt;and fun, I got nervous after that first bottle,I feared i would never find it agiain-but no worries-easily foumd it on several sites,but of course&lt;br /&gt;Amazon has the insanely reasonabe price- and the very generous 3,4 oz bottle is really big- I can;t think of a negative thing about it.&lt;br /&gt;Jennifer is such a beautiful,sexy woman who exudes an elegant confidence and a playful spirit-and somehow she magically has bottled&lt;br /&gt;that quality- I would happily pay much more for this if i had  to-highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> I THONK IT IS A VERY GOOD PERFUM AND IT SMELLS VERY NICE, IT IS FOR A YOUNG WOMEN SO.</li>
    <li> I love a lot of the J Lo scents. My first bottle of this was given to me as a gift. It has been hard to find in stores. I really like it. It is more of an evening scent than the original JLO Glow, (I have that one too. It smells like Rain or China Rain...Egyptian Musk.... all along the same scent.) Miami Glow is a warmer scent. It is a mixture of spicy citrus, vanilla, musk and a little amber. Kind of earthy and sweet. It&#x27;s kind of in the same scent family as women&#x27;s Obsession. It&#x27;s a bit softer though and more spicy.</li>
    <li> Just as expected. Pleased with purchase!</li>
    <li> First off: Let me say that I&#x27;d never purchase a perfume online without first testing it on my skin in a store. Besides not knowing if I like the scent, I only purchase perfumes that last a long time on my skin. Secondly, I&#x27;m not a celebrity type fragrance person. I&#x27;m picky about scents, not liking the super sweet, loud abnoxious scents, or the typical skanky smelling ones that smell like sweet foods. I choose a scent based on whether or not it compliments my body chemistry, not based on whose name is on the bottle. I was looking for the perfect scent for my beach wedding later this year. I was considering Rue 21&#x27;s 21 Black due to it&#x27;s strong coconut base, however,the scent barely stayed on my skin an hour -something that&#x27;s important to me in a tropical climate. I didn&#x27;t want anything too cloying or super fruity. I&#x27;ve also detested any &amp; all of JLo&#x27;s perfumes that I&#x27;ve ever smelled. I skeptically sampled this one at Perfumania in our local mall, at the suggestion of the sales clerk. I was surprised to love it! It&#x27;s the prefect tropical scent without being coconut-laden or super sweet. It doesn&#x27;t remind me of suntan lotion.&lt;br /&gt;At first whiff, I get this essence of golden. A warm sunlight feeling washes over me. I then the more subtle than usual smell of fruits &amp; this sun-baked sand impression. It&#x27;s musky, but not overly. It&#x27;s the perfect match of cool tropical vibes met with blazing hot sun. I think it would be appropriate to wear day or night, casual or formal. Alot of reviewers mention it being discontinued &amp; hard to find. Perfumania carries it, discount clothing stores, &amp; of course trusty Amazon have it available. Shipping was fast &amp; I&#x27;m glad to know with 100% certainty that this is not a knock off, because I&#x27;ve seen some people review beauty products saying they got ripped off. The best way to avoid this is by bring sure you&#x27;re purchasing through an Amazon seller &amp; not a seller through their online store.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite fragrance.  I receive compliments all the time about this lovely scent.  So happy to be able to find it.</li>
    <li> I wish they never discontinued  this perfume.I love the smell and it last the whole day.</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd time purchasing and from Amazon! The price is a steal for the 3.4oz bottle. I wear it often to work because it stays on. It&#x27;s one I will always have on my parfum counter. I wear Chanel, Prada and Viktor &amp; Rolf...as well as many others, but sometimes I&#x27;m just from the block like Jenny!</li>
    <li> One of my favorite scents</li>
    <li> Nothing like the original...Doesn&#x27;t last even for 30 minutes once applied. I will never buy it again....Cheap is expensive....</li>
    <li> I have had more people tell me that I smell great. Mostly strangers like at the gas station grocery store beauty shop etc. I will continue buying this.</li>
    <li> great product for the price!! I could not find it in any store near me, its great and the price was good</li>
    <li> this smells so good. its really different from the typical feminine perfumes which tend to be fruity body splashes or sweet cupcake scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if i could describe it in one word, it would be CREAMY. its just so creamyyyy and I envision a white coconut :) its very beachy and just soo relaxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i bought mine directly thru amazon and i couldn&#x27;t be happier. even the box was pristine, no dents and still in its plastic wrap. i am going to buy more!</li>
    <li> I always receive compliments on how good this smells. I was pretty sad when the company discontinued it. I&#x27;m so very happy that I&#x27;m still able to purchase it through amazon.</li>
    <li> Just received this item and it has an amazing beach scent, but I have to reapply constantly! The smell lasts only a couple of hours. If this is a scent I&#x27;m going to stick with I will have to purchase a new bottle once a month. Going to continue to search for another coconut/beach scent that will last longer.</li>
    <li> This is by far one of J lo.&#x27;s best. This is a classic in a bottle that should never be touched. I have smelled her other perfumes, but this one is my favorite.</li>
    <li> Although it was my fault to have made this purchase without first holding a test of this perfume , it is also true that the description of the frangancia is totally false if this is a summery and beachy scent I am jlo in person ; I was expecting a more youthful frangancia , light , soft smell but I got the opposite is a very strong and very elegant perfume in my opinion never Imaginare me jlo using this fragrance very own it . Upon receipt just sprinkle a touch on my wrist , and I knew I did not like , just have to point out something good about this fragrance for those who like their duration is eternal ... god !!!!!!!! that nightmare only with that little probe had to wash my wrist about 6 times that day with lots of soap and water and still no smell would disappear , really very bad experience but it was my fault for not having smelled before ; achieve rid of the as a tia will charm your scent and lasts all day even after taking a shower after a day&#x27;s work .</li>
    <li> Not a fan of J. lo at ALL! But i was at gordamans in the perfume section and thought why not spray it. OMG the smell is orgasmic!!!!!!!! It has been my fav perfume ever since! definatly worth the buy!</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful great I love it!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad there are still bottles of this fragrance left. It&#x27;s one of my favorites. It came super fast. Thank you!</li>
    <li> My Very Favorite of All time.  I need more</li>
    <li> very good. I came to buy the product. Thank you.</li>
    <li> A little late on my review but I ordered this a few weeks ago and got FAST SHIPPING and an amazing, undamaged product at a GREAT PRICE. I love this fragrance and it is one of Jennifer&#x27;s best. PERFECT for the Summer. You won&#x27;t be dissapointed by this seller and this product. This is one of my personal favorites from the only music/actress celebrity I&#x27;d purchase a fragrance from due to the quality and amazing scents in her fragrance line.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance! It&#x27;s hard to find now since it discontinued years ago in major dept stores but I can always count on amazon I Iuv it!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just not something I would ever wear. There is this strange underlying smell of baby powder and suntan oil. Not a favorite...Seller was quick to deliver, this is just not a scent I would ever purchase again.</li>
    <li> Gave this to my secret santa for Christmas and she thought I had spent twice our limited budget.  While shopping for this scent for herself, she found bottles half the size for the same cost.  So we tested them out to be sure it this product was the real thing and it was for sure.  Exactly the same as the more expensive bottles.  She loves the scent and had really wanted it, so if this is your scent, go for it!</li>
    <li> This has been my go to fragrance since high school. When it was discontinued I&#x27;m sure I wasn&#x27;t the only one that was sad. But with Amazon&#x27;s prices I can buy enough bottles to keep this sweet scent alive</li>
    <li> I bought this fragrance based on how I remembered it smelling from many years ago. I thought it was bright, tropical and sexy but what I got was completely different. I&#x27;m surprised no one on here mentions that it SMELLS LIKE SOAP! It does smell very very clean but not sexy or warm like I expected to. And no, you can&#x27;t return it.</li>
    <li> I love the scent of this Miami Glow, very sexy. Has a bit of musk, but it isn&#x27;t overpowering at all.</li>
    <li> Utterly fantastic!!!!</li>
    <li> Really love this scent.  It has gotten harder to find over the years and was really excited to find it on Amazon at this price. I have been paying almost twice this amount for 1.5 ozs when I can find it.  Definately order it now!</li>
    <li> I received this product without problems, that was the expected. my friend is satisfied because that was a gift to her sister.</li>
    <li> This is the third time ordered...:totally love it!! Ladies...A definitely spring &amp; summer perfume. You must get...won&#x27;t be disappointed for sure!</li>
    <li> What a great perfume JLO came up with. I just love the fragrance and will purchase more of it in the future.</li>
    <li> Awesome!!!! Got this for my daughters bday, thank you so much for having it in stock!! Is my daughters favorite,she loves it! &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> Cannot find this perfume anywhere but here it is. Was fairly priced and shipped when expected. My mom loved it. This is where I&#x27;ll buy it for her in the future.</li>
    <li> After reading the products description, I thought &amp;#34;This is totally my kind of perfume&amp;#34;.  I just received it and it smells HORRIBLE.  Worse than any of my grandmas perfumes.  And NOTHING like what the item description describes.  I have bought perfume online many times and never had this kind of experience.  I This perfume smells OLD.....like it&#x27;s been sitting around for years.  I tried to return it, but it will not let me.........saying its hazerdous/flamable.  Totally disappointed.</li>
    <li> I totally love Miami Glow by JLO it. So soft and fresh smelling. The scent never fades. I will reccomend every one to try it you won&#x27;t regret. It&#x27;s just another great scent .</li>
    <li> Love this perfume !!!! Will definitely but this again! Very feminine scent.&lt;br /&gt;Subtle delicate, perfect for all occasions! Day or even !</li>
    <li> Very pleased. Very happy.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite summer perfumes!! Smells refreshing :)</li>
    <li> So glad I found Miami Glow!  It&#x27;s the best smell ever and I thought it was unavailable.  I&#x27;m a happy girl!!</li>

    <li> I have been using Miami Glow for several years now and love the fruity feminine fragrance. It lasts all day and still makes me smile every time I get a whiff of it. It has become my favorite fragrance for summer (along with Dolce &amp; Gabbana&#x27;s Light Blue). Amazon also offers an excellent price on the large 3.4 oz. bottle.</li>
    <li> In new box, perfect condition, smells just like I remember!!!! So glad I found it and they shipped it so fast!</li>
    <li> This fragrance is very nice! definitely smells like a warm summer night. It is an elegant smell and is not too strong. definitely worth the price.</li>

    <li> i ordered this for my moms birthday since its her favorite, not sure if it&#x27;s authentic but she was super happy with it so i will most likely buy again.</li>
