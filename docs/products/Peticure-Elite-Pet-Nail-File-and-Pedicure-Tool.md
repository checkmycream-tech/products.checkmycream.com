      <li>Great item and service</li>
      <li>Great quality for the money.</li>
      <li>The SE Cordless Variable Speed Rechargeable Rotary Tool 9.6 V works great once it is assembled.</li>
      <li>I am happy that I got it, but I do wish the charge lasted longer.</li>
      <li>Amazing service and the item is great!!</li>
      <li>My wife grooms our Westy and finds this tool to be a great tool.  </li>
      <li>Very handy.</li>
      <li>JUST AS GOOD.</li>
      <li>Found this one on Amazon, love that its rechargable!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m thrilled with this purchase.</li>
      <li>It works great very powerful.</li>
      <li>, it is not the most beautiful  piece of equipment, but it works just fine.</li>
      <li>The greatest thing I&#x27;ve purchased for my sensitive dog that does not like to get his nails &amp;#34;cut&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>This thing is HUGE!</li>
      <li>but it sure looks just like what the groomer uses.</li>
      <li>Rotates more for a righty</li>
      <li>better then nail clippers.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m satisfied with this product &#x3D;)</li>
      <li>/&gt;Actually, I may be able to do this hack.&lt;br</li>
      <li>but i added a couple torn strips of blue painters tape (masking, duck, electrical, etc. will probably work too) to the mounting tip and it works perfect.</li>
      <li>After sleeping on it; I was able to figure out how it was assembled.</li>
      <li>so I haven&#x27;t been  able to use it.</li>
      <li>This product is more of a hassle than convenience.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s much better than this one</li>
      <li>many of the products today are shipped with crummy batteries that render the equipment disposable.&lt;br</li>
      <li>and it is still holding the original charge!</li>
      <li>It operates very smoothly, almost noise free.</li>
      <li>My confusion could have been avoided had it arrived with more detailed instructions.</li>
      <li>I loved it so much, I bought one for my Moms use (on her dog)</li>
      <li>So easy to use (easier with two people).</li>
      <li>Are the Peticure stickers easily removable, leaving no residue that doesn&#x27;t wipe off easily?</li>
      <li>frankly these dimensions work fine for me.</li>
      <li>I expect it will do the job just fine.</li>
      <li>If your dog can bear the sound and the vibration buy it.</li>
      <li>This was dirt cheap</li>
      <li>I was weary to purchase based on several reviews, but this has worked great.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried the cheap as-seen-on-tv</li>
      <li>That was quick and easy.</li>
      <li>My puppy wasn&#x27;t sure about it when I started grinding his nails for the first time, but after the 1st paw, he just sat there not squirming.&lt;br</li>
      <li>powerful tool!</li>
      <li>the tool itself is impecable, good speed control, very practical chuck; the battery insertion and recharge is also very practical...</li>
      <li>Some reviewers commented that the sanding discs do not stay on; this is true</li>
      <li>I bought this item recently just because i needed a practical rotary tool, and this looked like a good bet.</li>
      <li>The first time worked fine, although, I had to wait for the battery to charge</li>
      <li>Our dog doesn&#x27;t seem to mind this method of trimming his nails and there is no danger of getting into the quick.</li>
      <li>Works well and quickly.</li>
      <li>As good or better than a dremel&lt;br /&gt;Now , just how do I remove the battery pack to use rechargeables or  alkaline without destroying it?</li>
      <li>and it seems the battery degrades quickly.</li>
      <li>This is a great little inexpensive tool.  </li>
      <li>She would not tolerate the clippers but stayed calm for this method.</li>
      <li>Is it worth it?</li>
      <li>Will give it a while longer before changing to five stars, but so far quite pleased.    </li>
      <li>It is quiet and effective.  </li>
      <li>so I guess it was worth what I paid for it.  </li>
      <li>And very powerful, don&#x27;t have to turn it up very high to get the job done.</li>
      <li>Entirely too big to fit in your hand and use effectively!</li>
      <li>the price was right if it had worked.but</li>
      <li>very very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>When I first got it I did have to charge the battery for about 3 hrs.</li>
      <li>The only reason I gave it more than one star is because I received it very quickly and it worked the first time (barely)</li>
      <li>One specific thing I should point out that may be a plus or minus (depending on the size of your hands) is that this thing IS a hand full, and I&#x27;ve got pretty good sized hands.</li>
      <li>I got this for my hubby&#x27;s grossly thick toenails, really works great.</li>
      <li>Works great to sand down golden lab&#x27;s too long toe nails.</li>
      <li>Any drawbacks, ie: size and switch location, are easily offset by the qualities listed above.</li>
      <li>The instructions are very simple, and the speed is easily adjusted while in use.  </li>
      <li>This is OK to me as the main dog I wanted this for is one of the ones that will just lay there no matter how long.</li>
      <li>Not as much</li>
      <li>It runs put soo fast.</li>
      <li>Haha</li>
      <li>did much better than I expected.  </li>
      <li>but it does hold a charge fairly well, depending on how fast or slow the adjustable speed is set.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s fast and it is can&#x27;t hurt my dogs or make them bleed because you cut too much nail off like other products :)</li>
      <li>Works fine but doesn&#x27;t hold a charge very long.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very glad, overall, that I bought this and would still (for it&#x27;s flaws) recommend it to other dog-parents.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is great at low or high speed, although 4 is fast enough speed out of 8 given to grind small</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a 6ft tall dude with good sized hands,as mentioned, but if you&#x27;re a smaller person with more petite hands it could be somewhat awkward to use.</li>
      <li>this has NO COVER, which is really the only reason to buy this in the first place.</li>
      <li>The unit does not stay charged for more than about five minutes of constant use, so it took three chargings to complete the long needed trimming.</li>
      <li>It actually went allot better than I had expected.  </li>
      <li>I returned it and bought new sanding pads for my old one-</li>
      <li>The tool is a little heavy, but you can get a good grip on it.</li>
      <li>So far it has been.</li>
      <li>My dog is 10 years old and has never had me be the one to clip her nails.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great tool for the price</li>
    <li> B0051BM8D0&lt;br /&gt;got this to file my boston terrier&#x27;s nails. works great and it is not very noisy. I also like the idea, that it is recharchable. The tool is a little heavy, but you can get a good grip on it.</li>
    <li> better then nail clippers.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my brother who is tired of paying high prices for grooming his dog. I&#x27;m not sure how well it works but it sure looks just like what the groomer uses. I expect it will do the job just fine.</li>
    <li> Great item and service</li>
    <li> This tool does get the job done; however, after a couple of uses, it no longer holds a charge for very long. It still works good enough that I hate to spend money on something else, though. It is somewhat big and bulky and it does make a mechanical noise, but it IS a grinder. It&#x27;s going to make a noise. My dog will not let me clip her nails, but she will let me use this tool all day long. I am happy that I got it, but I do wish the charge lasted longer.</li>
    <li> My wife grooms our Westy and finds this tool to be a great tool.  Our dog doesn&#x27;t seem to mind this method of trimming his nails and there is no danger of getting into the quick.</li>
    <li> I bought this item recently just because i needed a practical rotary tool, and this looked like a good bet. So far it has been. When I first got it I did have to charge the battery for about 3 hrs. but it does hold a charge fairly well, depending on how fast or slow the adjustable speed is set. Another plus for it is.. It operates very smoothly, almost noise free. I guess it&#x27;s designed that way so as not to scare your pet(s) if you do intend to use it as a grooming tool.    One specific thing I should point out that may be a plus or minus (depending on the size of your hands) is that this thing IS a hand full, and I&#x27;ve got pretty good sized hands. It measures 10\\&quot; long (with filing drum attached). The base is nearly 6\\&quot; in diameter, and it weighs in at 12.5 to 14 oz. frankly these dimensions work fine for me. I&#x27;m a 6ft tall dude with good sized hands,as mentioned, but if you&#x27;re a smaller person with more petite hands it could be somewhat awkward to use. Over all though, I like it. Hard to beat for the price.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. It works good, but the battery is crazy. It runs put soo fast. And my dog is hella scared of it. Haha</li>
    <li> Amazing service and the item is great!!</li>
    <li> I like this product... It works well, it&#x27;s fast and it is can&#x27;t hurt my dogs or make them bleed because you cut too much nail off like other products :)</li>
    <li> So easy to use (easier with two people). Works well and quickly. I&#x27;m satisfied with this product &#x3D;) My dogs? Not as much but they are getting used to it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. wish i didnt lose it!</li>
    <li> I got this for my hubby&#x27;s grossly thick toenails, really works great. I even use it for my heals. And the battery charge lasts a really long time. Awesome product.  And very powerful, don&#x27;t have to turn it up very high to get the job done.</li>
    <li> Does it use all the same accessories as the Dremel 6-volt cordless rotary tool, including flex shaft? YES! Does it cost $15.00 less than the Dremel 6-volt cordless rotary tool? YES! ($14.97 is close enough). Are the Peticure stickers easily removable, leaving no residue that doesn&#x27;t wipe off easily? YES! Is there a logical reason, other than color, not to buy this tool, rather than a more expensive one? NO! &#x27;Nuff said!</li>
    <li> Lasts longer than dremels!!  Great price and, with care, longevity. Any drawbacks, ie: size and switch location, are easily offset by the qualities listed above.</li>
    <li> This was just what I was looking for, since it was rechargeable. But unfortunately it would not charge. So I had to return it. That was quick and easy. Still looking</li>
    <li> The greatest thing I&#x27;ve purchased for my sensitive dog that does not like to get his nails &amp;#34;cut&amp;#34;.  I file his nails in the comfort of our home and he knows I&#x27;d never hurt him do he lets me do it and and I have a happy dog as well as myself.</li>
    <li> It works great very powerful. Blasts through my dogs toe nails. It is awesome!!!! Compared to the Dremel which is 25$ THIS WORKS JUST AS GOOD.</li>
    <li> It died the second time I used it. the price was right if it had worked.but it diedand would not work</li>
    <li> This product was default ice upon delivery.  It is made poorly.  It was returned with no problem.</li>
    <li> this was difinetly worse the money. Had no issues using it.......my only fault is not really lefty savy. Rotates more for a righty then a left handed person</li>
    <li> Everything is excellent</li>
    <li> This is a great tool!  It can be used very comfortably on human toe nails for shaping and reducing the nails.  AND, it works as a cordless Dremel-type tool.  Very handy. Great quality for the money.</li>
    <li> My puppy wasn&#x27;t sure about it when I started grinding his nails for the first time, but after the 1st paw, he just sat there not squirming.&lt;br /&gt;It is great at low or high speed, although 4 is fast enough speed out of 8 given to grind small to medium sixed nails.&lt;br /&gt;the tool is a little big, a bit bigger than a curling iron handle, but handles well.&lt;br /&gt;Even used it on my kitten and he didn&#x27;t mind either....</li>
    <li> The order came incomplete me without the base where the files are placed, so you can not use.</li>
    <li> If you looking for a pedicure with the cover that prevents the dogs hair from accidental tangled up in the dremel, then go somewhere else this has NO COVER, which is really the only reason to buy this in the first place. I am very disappointed</li>
    <li> I use this product to sharpen my chainsaw in the woods.  It works perfect and saves time.  Purchase a diamond chainsaw sharpener burr on ebay for less than $3.00.  The burr can be used to sharpened the chain for at least several dozen times.  My wife uses hers to groom our dog&#x27;s paws.  It is much quicker than the more expensive one she had used.  Its quiet and does not startle our dog.</li>
    <li> the tool itself is impecable, good speed control, very practical chuck; the battery insertion and recharge is also very practical...but the batteries are of very poor quality, and did not recharge more than a dozen times, even though i was carefull not to discharge them past 60%...i guess good batteries are expensive, the price i paid for this tool reflects this.</li>
    <li> Great value and no issues.  I&#x27;m thrilled with this purchase. I was weary to purchase based on several reviews, but this has worked great.  Several uses in.</li>
    <li> Great price quality tool ! As good or better than a dremel&lt;br /&gt;Now , just how do I remove the battery pack to use rechargeables or  alkaline without destroying it? hehe&lt;br /&gt;Actually, I may be able to do this hack.&lt;br /&gt;So many of the products today are shipped with crummy batteries that render the equipment disposable.&lt;br /&gt;It is usually disappointing ,but at this price I would by more! Thanks&lt;br /&gt;Update ...use a screwdriver to pop the four plastic clips to open the battery pac (look for the two arrows on one side)&lt;br /&gt; nicad batteries look good/fresh inside!</li>
    <li> This tool seems like a great deal. When I&#x27;m getting the dog settled for a trim however the battery conks out on me. The battery and charger are poor- They generate a lot of heat and it seems the battery degrades quickly. Is it worth it? I don&#x27;t buy tools that are dull or fall apart- regardless of price. The same holds for this one.&lt;br /&gt;The single star reflects the value of this tool.</li>
    <li> Great product for the price. Be careful....powerful tool!</li>
    <li> I know these work well, if you are careful and your dog/cat isnt afraid of it. I use to use these on my past dogs but my dog now is to afraid so I haven&#x27;t been  able to use it.</li>
    <li> Entirely too big to fit in your hand and use effectively! This thing is HUGE!</li>
    <li> Received promptly. I Had an older model (it broke) that seem to be make a lot of noise; This one has very little noise to scare the dogs. Works for me!</li>
    <li> Not the highest quality but for around $7 it can&#x27;t be beat. Some reviewers commented that the sanding discs do not stay on; this is true but i added a couple torn strips of blue painters tape (masking, duck, electrical, etc. will probably work too) to the mounting tip and it works perfect.</li>
    <li> My original (really expensive) peticure bit the dust. I&#x27;ve tried the cheap as-seen-on-tv knock offs from the drugstores and they simply don&#x27;t have the power to do the job. I paired my existing safety cap with this tool and was back in business. I followed the training instruction on the peticure website and my dog will now actually roll over and hold her paws in the air when I get the tool out. She knows it doesn&#x27;t hurt and there is a treat in it for her.</li>
    <li> This tool is a bit louder than I expected from previous reviews.  It scares my (somewhat high-strung) dog, she doesn&#x27;t like it and fights me every step of the way when I use it (about once a week).  However, it is a vast improvement on trying to clip her (very thick) toenails with a pair of snips and even if you nip the quick you don&#x27;t go nearly as far as with traditional snips.  I&#x27;m very glad, overall, that I bought this and would still (for it&#x27;s flaws) recommend it to other dog-parents.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t hate it, but my dog does. She is scared to death of this thing, so it&#x27;s impossible to use it on her.</li>
    <li> This was dirt cheap so I guess it was worth what I paid for it.  The sandpaper roll attached to the tool comes loose and slides down the shaft when in use.  It came with two more sandpaper rolls, and I tried to change the to big for the new unused one, but that one is to small. But it does work, although my dogs are terrified of it for now. Will have to ease them into it.</li>
    <li> worked perfectly. don&#x27;t know how we got along without it for years. thank you</li>
    <li> It took a few minutes to get use to using it. Once I got the hang of it, it worked like a charm and didn&#x27;t take long.</li>
    <li> did much better than I expected.  It has the power to grind big dog and small dog nails.&lt;br /&gt;Does it come in a corded version?</li>
    <li> I needed something to grind down my little quaker&#x27;s nails.  It was done at the Vets office but this will save me a little money.  Can&#x27;t beat it for the low price I paid.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this one.  No head to protect the animals paws and collect the nail dust.  I returned it and bought new sanding pads for my old one- it&#x27;s much better than this one</li>
    <li> The SE Cordless Variable Speed Rechargeable Rotary Tool 9.6 V works great once it is assembled. The instructions are practically worthless for those of us non mechanical individuals. Almost returned the product. After sleeping on it; I was able to figure out how it was assembled. Really very simple. My confusion could have been avoided had it arrived with more detailed instructions.</li>
    <li> I am still getting used to it and so is my Labradoodle. My dog is 10 years old and has never had me be the one to clip her nails. She wasn&#x27;t afraid of the noise or the vibration. It actually went allot better than I had expected.  I would have given it a 5 star rating, but it is a little on the large size for a woman to use, but still totally manageable.</li>
    <li> Works great to sand down golden lab&#x27;s too long toe nails. She would not tolerate the clippers but stayed calm for this method. The unit does not stay charged for more than about five minutes of constant use, so it took three chargings to complete the long needed trimming. For the price it&#x27;s a great deal.</li>
    <li> For that money? Someone complaining? Tell me why. Please.&lt;br /&gt;It works, files the claws of your for and two legged monsters down without a hitch.&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a charger, the batteries hold up very very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hell, I keep one of the files aside for myself and did my toe nails and dry skin on my feet and it works like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;Sure, it is not the most beautiful  piece of equipment, but it works just fine. and for the price?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No brainer. If your dog can bear the sound and the vibration buy it.</li>
    <li> This is a great little inexpensive tool.  Have used it twice to file after cutting my dogs nails.  It is quiet and effective.  While my dog does not like having her nails cut, she has no issues with the grinder.  The instructions are very simple, and the speed is easily adjusted while in use.  It held a charge for two weeks, no problem.  Will give it a while longer before changing to five stars, but so far quite pleased.    Update:  Have now used this little tool every couple of weeks since the original purchase date in May and it is still holding the original charge! Still quiet enough for my dog and working well.  Still think it is unbeatable for the price!</li>
    <li> I was looking for something like this and at this price, this is a great deal.  It is variable speed and works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have 6 dogs and 2 don&#x27;t mind it at all, 2 will allow limited amount of use and 2 will not let me use it at all on them.  This is OK to me as the main dog I wanted this for is one of the ones that will just lay there no matter how long.</li>
    <li> The first time worked fine, although, I had to wait for the battery to charge which is odd they should send the item pre-charged. Also the sand paper bit covers come off after 3 seconds of grinding then you have to slide it back on every time. The second time I tried to use it the battery was dead once again. After an hour long charge, I turned the dial only to hear the most unpleasant squealing that made my dogs whine.  The bit did not turn. The only way it works is if I turn the dial all the way up. This product is more of a hassle than convenience. The only reason I gave it more than one star is because I received it very quickly and it worked the first time (barely) Considering asking for a replacement or return for my money back.</li>
    <li> Have had the Peticure Elite, plugs in for years. It died, so I went to contact the company, and it looks like they are no longer around. Found this one on Amazon, love that its rechargable! Esp for those wiggly toe toes. I loved it so much, I bought one for my Moms use (on her dog)</li>
    <li> Works fine but doesn&#x27;t hold a charge very long.</li>
    <li> My dogs HATE this. You can&#x27;t press hard enough to actually do any work. Dogs HATE the noise and vibration.</li>
