### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Wonderful product.</li>
      <li>I have used the eyelid lifter for over a year and it works wonderfully, but I also discovered it will temporarily tighten neck skin also.  </li>
      <li>This product is awesome.</li>
      <li>it works great.  </li>
      <li>The price and the size of bottle is good deal.</li>
      <li>So I decided to try with you and am delighted that you had it available.</li>
      <li>product is ok but not like the picture on the box; more like a nice eye cream.</li>
      <li>thank you very much for a great product</li>
      <li>My lids are smooth!</li>
      <li>Nothing shows aging more than the skin around the eyes.  </li>
      <li>I just ordered two more</li>
      <li>Better than others, but makes my eyes water.  </li>
      <li>It worked OK as a moisturizer, but I saw no improvement in my eye lids.</li>
      <li>the pump plastic bottle broke after the first use; very cheap.  </li>
      <li>So far I am very pleased..</li>
      <li>It absorbs quickly and you can use eye makeup after you put it on and rub it in.</li>
      <li>GOOD, AND REASONABLE FOR UPPER, AND LOWER LID.</li>
      <li>Sudden eye change was just a nice eye cream.</li>
      <li>Worth a try.</li>
      <li>If you want something that works better, by the new Sudden Change gel, works better</li>
      <li>and I think it really works!</li>
      <li>It makes my eyes look more open and has really tightened the skin on and above my top eyelid too.  </li>
      <li>Left a flaky film on my eyelids and made a huge crease across them.</li>
      <li>This product really does what its name describes.  </li>
      <li>It moisturizes very well.  </li>
      <li>I could have posed for the before and after picture that is on the package because my eyes have improved that much too.  </li>
      <li>This product really works for under eye complexion.  </li>
      <li>Since I didn&#x27;t have good results with the other product, I didn&#x27;t even open the box.  </li>
      <li>I hope it does really work since I have gotten older</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty much the only product that claims to lift eyelids, so I&#x27;ll stick with it.</li>
      <li>She used it and it worked pretty much instantly.</li>
      <li>I tried my first application last night</li>
      <li>Only thing I&#x27;ve used that really worked.  </li>
      <li>it really does work...and will definitely put off an eye lift.  </li>
      <li>I used it faithfully AM and PM for several months and really saw no difference.  </li>
      <li>Do not waste your time with this product.</li>
      <li>I have used this product for several years, but hadn&#x27;t been able to find it at the usual stores.</li>
      <li>very think line between too much and too little</li>
      <li>Once it sinks in and dries the effect is a little more pronounced.  </li>
      <li>Do not waste your money , get the eyelid tape instead, i ude the ones for asian people</li>
      <li>I am an 81 year old female and have been using sudden change for upper eyelids for year.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Nothing shows aging more than the skin around the eyes.  I had been really unhappy with my drooping eyelids and the looseness of the skin above my eyelids. Couldn&#x27;t even see my eyeshadow! This product really does what its name describes.  My droopy eyelids are droopy no more.  It makes my eyes look more open and has really tightened the skin on and above my top eyelid too.  I could have posed for the before and after picture that is on the package because my eyes have improved that much too.  I use it twice a day and will continue to use it indefinitely.  I just ordered two more so I won&#x27;t run out.</li>
    <li> This product really works for under eye complexion.  My wife was very gun shy but once she put it on for a couple of times the was a believer</li>
    <li> I used it faithfully AM and PM for several months and really saw no difference.  So, no it does not do what it says it does.  Not for me anyway.  It worked OK as a moisturizer, but I saw no improvement in my eye lids.</li>
    <li> I would not buy this again. It actually does no better than the old standby which is (should I say it) Preparation H cream. As a matter of fact, it is worse in that it leaves a residue that is visible a while after applying.</li>
    <li> Left a flaky film on my eyelids and made a huge crease across them.</li>
    <li> Does not work. Do not waste your time with this product.</li>
    <li> I am a new senior citizen and a had been previously turned on to some more expensive stuff by the ex girlfriend. It didn&#x27;t seem to do a thing for sagging upper lids. I tried this and I think it really works! The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars as it seems to irritate my eyes a bit.</li>
    <li> I am an 81 year old female and have been using sudden change for upper eyelids for year.  it works great.  I would never be without it?</li>
    <li> Do not waste your money , get the eyelid tape instead, i ude the ones for asian people&lt;br /&gt;(doble tape) this stuff is sticky ichy and it gave me allergy</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty much the only product that claims to lift eyelids, so I&#x27;ll stick with it.</li>
    <li> Since I didn&#x27;t have good results with the other product, I didn&#x27;t even open the box.  I can&#x27;t give a review.</li>
    <li> I bought this product when I purchased another item from the same brand. I bought it for my mother who has problems with her upper eyelids sagging. She used it and it worked pretty much instantly. I have now stolen it from her!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for my wife. no changes after use. i would not recommend this product. Price and quality the same low.</li>
    <li> Better than others, but makes my eyes water.  If you want something that works better, by the new Sudden Change gel, works better</li>
    <li> i have tried it several different times on various days.  It did not appear to make any difference in my eyelids.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years, but hadn&#x27;t been able to find it at the usual stores. So I decided to try with you and am delighted that you had it available. Didn&#x27;t want to be without this product!!</li>
    <li> the pump plastic bottle broke after the first use; very cheap.  product is ok but not like the picture on the box; more like a nice eye cream.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 weeks now and haven&#x27;t noticed any difference at all.</li>
    <li> Sudden eye change was just a nice eye cream. It does not sudden change anything on your eyes. Pictures must be fake.</li>
    <li> I ordered two bottles. The price and the size of bottle is good deal. I just started using this creme I hope it does really work since I have gotten older my eyes look like the picture on bottle....ugly!!!! Can&#x27;t afford an eyelid lift so I will give this a try and give an update...if I see any difference.</li>
    <li> Save your money, made skin softer but that&#x27;s about all it did.</li>
    <li> I am disappointed in this product it&#x27;s not doing what it says I have used it everyday according to directions and nothing</li>
    <li> As far as I&#x27;m concerned, this product is useless.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of Sudden Change. Been using the eye serum for years. I am 45 and people say I look 35. I noticed a little droop in my eye lids..... I tried my first application last night and I can feel the tightening. I hope this works as well as the eye serum...So far I am very pleased..</li>
    <li> makes it look like you have sleep in your eyes ... very think line between too much and too little</li>
    <li> This product is awesome. Within a week a noticed a difference. I will definitely by it again. My lids are smooth!</li>
    <li> I have used the eyelid lifter for over a year and it works wonderfully, but I also discovered it will temporarily tighten neck skin also.  Worth a try.</li>
    <li> This does actually make a visible difference.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple years, and it&#x27;s getting tougher to find.  I use it almost every night, and a container lasts about six months.  The rest of my face regimen is higher-end products, but I haven&#x27;t found anything that works this well on this area.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for years.  Only thing I&#x27;ve used that really worked.  Wonderful product. Would recommend to my friends.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t work and came in a broken bottle!!</li>
    <li> this did absolutely nothing, it was a waste of money.  I thought it would be like the serum, but it is not</li>
    <li> There may be a slight improvement in the appearance of hooded eyelids with use of this product, but I saw very little lift myself.</li>
    <li> It needs to come with some type of applicator. I got it in my eye using my fingers.  My eye was irritated all day.</li>
    <li> Seems to work.  Makes my eyelids look tighter.</li>
    <li> GOOD, AND REASONABLE FOR UPPER, AND LOWER LID.</li>
    <li> You can see the difference, and after a while of using it it fixes the problem</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a product that would help with my puffy, sagging eyelids.  I have not found anything that did anything without dyring out the eye area and leaving a film on the eye area.  This is quite moisturizing and can be used on the upper eye lid as well as below the eyes.  It does tighted the up eyelid area up a little.  I can see a slight difference.  I can actually see my eyelid once I put the cream on, where as before I couldn&#x27;t see my eye lid at all.  Once it sinks in and dries the effect is a little more pronounced.  It&#x27;s not a drastic difference but enough to keep me using it.  It moisturizes very well.  It absorbs quickly and you can use eye makeup after you put it on and rub it in.</li>
    <li> it really does work...and will definitely put off an eye lift.  thank you very much for a great product and I am telling all my friends.</li>
