      <li>From researching on the internet I seen many suffered from this condition.</li>
      <li>I still use colgate total at night, which has triclosan, to get the best of both worlds.</li>
      <li>Despite flossing more often, using a water pik and brushing sooner after meals, my dental visits got worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Thanks for carrying a great product.</li>
      <li>Has the calcium and fluoride together in one paste which I can&#x27;t find in most stores.</li>
      <li>I have been pleased with this product.</li>
      <li>Its refreshing and clean feeling.</li>
      <li>This tooth paste is fabulous,  </li>
      <li>and I smile more because of my whiter teeth.</li>
      <li>I found this locally in a sort of thrift store here in Australia for  0.50 cents for a 125ml tube used it fantastic product !!!</li>
      <li>Originally it came from a company that created a product called Enamel-On over 23 plus years ago.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Fluoride is the most important ingredient in any toothpaste and virtually all incorporate it, but liquid calcium is what really sets this one apart.  </li>
      <li>This toothpaste keeps my teeth clean and the freshness lasts for hours.</li>
      <li>Helps keep my teeth clean and refreshed.</li>
      <li>Your mouth feels so clean after using this toothpaste.  </li>
      <li>This one&#x27;s got a taste that isn&#x27;t overly sweet, and everything else I need, so that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s my preference.</li>
      <li>I personally think it tastes good with a salty/sweet flavor.</li>
      <li>I am no longer wincing when I take a sip of cool water.</li>
      <li>leaves my mouth clean and fresh</li>
      <li>Luckily I found what I needed on Amazon.</li>
      <li>hygenist today remarked that my teeth were incredibly clean, little plaque, and in great shape.</li>
      <li>It also has a decent taste and smell and feels very clean in the mouth.</li>
      <li>Gets my teeth pretty clean.</li>
      <li>It costs  premium, but your teeth are worth it.</li>
      <li>the latest is Complete Care - Enamel strengthening.  </li>
      <li>This toothpaste combines fresh minty flavor with liquid calcium to fill the cracks and crevices in your teeth to rebuild their strength.</li>
      <li>just shop around for the right price.</li>
      <li>come right to our door and know that we can trust</li>
      <li>After doing some research, I decided that baking soda was the way to go (despite the less than pleasant taste).</li>
      <li>Arm &amp; Hammer bought the patent and had it in many different variations of tooth paste over the years.  </li>
      <li>If you are also allergic to peroxide then I thought you should be aware of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>When I wasn&#x27;t able to find the toothpaste locally anymore, I switched and hoped the calcium didn&#x27;t matter.  </li>
      <li>My first encounter with liquid calcium was with Arm and Hammer&#x27;s</li>
      <li>I really feel like this toothpaste cleans better than the Aquafresh Extreme Clean that I was using before, and feels gentler on my lips and gums too since it doesn&#x27;t have a ton of menthol in it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The price is not cheap, but reasonable and it was good to be able to order as many tubes as I wanted, since it is hard to come by.</li>
      <li>Have had good dental reports that I contribute to this product along with my usual oral hygiene regime.</li>
      <li>but I think it certainly had an impact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have tried dozens of products and they were all jam packed with way too many chemicals, or there wasn&#x27;t a proper balance of active ingredients to promote strong teeth.  </li>
      <li>fast shipping.</li>
      <li>wish amazon would offer it with reasonable shipping instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I remembered this brand of toothpaste called Enamelon from way back when that I really liked, and found that this has the same ingredient (that they branded Liquid Calcium).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The big change over Age Defying is they&#x27;ve added peroxide to this formulation and tossed the glycerin, resulting in a more gritty texture.  </li>
      <li>have since stopped using this particular mixture of Arm &amp; Hammer toothpaste</li>
      <li>Will likely last more than a year...  </li>
      <li>I do not see this particular one in the stores....</li>
      <li>definitely wish I could find it more locally.</li>
      <li>I was suffering from great sensitivity to hot and cold foods and it has gone now</li>
      <li>Modern take on an old product.</li>
      <li>I brought this for my little brother and he says it&#x27;s a great toothpaste, but it&#x27;s taste is a little off.</li>
      <li>but we still use other Arm &amp; Hammer toothpastes on a daily basis as it is our favorite brand.</li>
      <li>Overseas, they&#x27;ve promoted liquid calcium toothpaste for sensitive teeth.  </li>
      <li>I have sensitive teeth</li>
      <li>My sensitivity went away after nearly a week.</li>
      <li>Arm/Hammer Complete Care Toothpaste Enamel Strength, Size:</li>
      <li>I found that the toothpastes that I had been using were far too abrasive for every day use.</li>
      <li>My dentist recommended for my sensitive gums and it&#x27;s working like a charm.</li>
      <li>This is the among the most expensive toothpaste I&#x27;ve purchased and for me it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
      <li>hunted down some remaining tubes online and rationed them, but fortunately, they introduced this new formula last year.  </li>
      <li>This toothpaste makes my teeth feel very clean for at least 1-2 hours after use.</li>
      <li>/&gt;this is the only toothpaste i would recommend highly.  </li>
      <li>It tastes very salty and has a long aftertaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>If you have special health problems and ordinary toothpastes aren&#x27;t enough, give Complete Care Enamel Strengthening a try.  </li>
      <li>We try to make sure that we do not purchase toothpaste that has peroxide in it for these reasons and usually the active ingredients like peroxide are noted on the front of the box</li>
      <li>I have been using Colgate total for quite some time, though one or two of me teeth had become sensitive recently.</li>
      <li>I was unaware of this when I first began using this particular mixture of tooth paste and within 10 days I developed hyper sensitivity to hot and cold liquids which can be caused by using peroxide on your teeth.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Years ago I had a lot of gum surgery.  Consequently, my gumline is lower than normal and sometimes several areas of my mouth are very sensitive - expecially to cold.  This tooth paste is fabulous,  After a couple of weeks using it, I have had no pain at all and I smile more because of my whiter teeth. I suspect I will never use anything else.  Thank you for a great product!</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended this low abrasive toothpaste.  I can&#x27;t stand it.  It tastes very salty and has a long aftertaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I threw away the order and ordered some Colgate Total</li>
    <li> I buy this at the local Winco.  This toothpaste keeps my teeth clean and the freshness lasts for hours. I believe it has made my teeth stonger.  I have tried dozens of products and they were all jam packed with way too many chemicals, or there wasn&#x27;t a proper balance of active ingredients to promote strong teeth.  I am hoping to stick with this toothpaste as long as I can.</li>
    <li> I have tracked the patent on this enamel strengthening over the years.  Originally it came from a company that created a product called Enamel-On over 23 plus years ago.  That toothpaste would literally add a coating to your teeth.  Arm &amp; Hammer bought the patent and had it in many different variations of tooth paste over the years.  each brand would sell for a year then be discontinued.  the latest is Complete Care - Enamel strengthening.  This is not as good as the original but in my opinion the best on the market today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRO:&lt;br /&gt;1:  Been using a variation of this enamel toothpaste for 23 plus years and never had a cavity yet.&lt;br /&gt;2:  leaves my mouth clean and fresh feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;1:  Nothing with the toothpaste but issues with the cost of shipping.  doubling shipping cost every tube I ordered?  im not paying $40.00 shipping for&lt;br /&gt;  10 tubes.&lt;br /&gt;2:  Extremely hard to find locally.  have to purchase bulk from a supply chain in California.  wish amazon would offer it with reasonable shipping instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONCLUSION:&lt;br /&gt;this is the only toothpaste i would recommend highly.  just shop around for the right price.</li>
    <li> I found this locally in a sort of thrift store here in Australia for  0.50 cents for a 125ml tube used it fantastic product !!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The variant is Enamel Care with the liquid calcium</li>
    <li> My first encounter with liquid calcium was with Arm and Hammer&#x27;s Age Defying toothpaste.  They emphasized the cosmetic benefits with that branding, but I never really saw any.  Overseas, they&#x27;ve promoted liquid calcium toothpaste for sensitive teeth.  What I did see, personally were fewer cavities at the dentist.  When I wasn&#x27;t able to find the toothpaste locally anymore, I switched and hoped the calcium didn&#x27;t matter.  It did matter.  Despite flossing more often, using a water pik and brushing sooner after meals, my dental visits got worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hunted down some remaining tubes online and rationed them, but fortunately, they introduced this new formula last year.  Hopefully it sticks around for a while, because there&#x27;s nothing else like it.  The big change over Age Defying is they&#x27;ve added peroxide to this formulation and tossed the glycerin, resulting in a more gritty texture.  Glycerin is an underrated additive that is antimicrobial, aids in moisturizing and has helps skin deal with inflammation.  However, overall, this formulation leaves my mouth feeling fresher, longer, and still helps me fend off the cavities as well as Age Defying did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fluoride is the most important ingredient in any toothpaste and virtually all incorporate it, but liquid calcium is what really sets this one apart.  If you have special health problems and ordinary toothpastes aren&#x27;t enough, give Complete Care Enamel Strengthening a try.  It costs  premium, but your teeth are worth it.</li>
    <li> Arm/Hammer Complete Care Toothpaste Enamel Strength, Size: 6 Oz  Modern take on an old product. Its refreshing and clean feeling. Have had good dental reports that I contribute to this product along with my usual oral hygiene regime.</li>
    <li> I was suffering from great sensitivity to hot and cold foods and it has gone now, I believe this tooth paste may have helped. It may not be connected, but it didn&#x27;t worsen.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended for my sensitive gums and it&#x27;s working like a charm. I am no longer wincing when I take a sip of cool water.</li>
    <li> I found that the toothpastes that I had been using were far too abrasive for every day use. After doing some research, I decided that baking soda was the way to go (despite the less than pleasant taste). I remembered this brand of toothpaste called Enamelon from way back when that I really liked, and found that this has the same ingredient (that they branded Liquid Calcium).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hygenist today remarked that my teeth were incredibly clean, little plaque, and in great shape. I really feel like this toothpaste cleans better than the Aquafresh Extreme Clean that I was using before, and feels gentler on my lips and gums too since it doesn&#x27;t have a ton of menthol in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wish the taste was a bit more pleasant, but I&#x27;ll deal with it for the results of healthy teeth.</li>
    <li> I wanted the toothpaste with the peroxide like shown here and they sent me the tube without the peroxide.&lt;br /&gt;I will return it, but it is a nuisance. I did notice that the company I got it from Pharmapacks is not mentioned&lt;br /&gt;anymore. They could at least have let me know they did not have it instead of sending the wrong item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit 8-26-2013:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have received your return to our warehouse and, as discussed, have issued a refund of the product price minus a 10% restocking fee.&lt;br /&gt;We hope you take 5% off your next order with us using the coupon code \\&quot;pharmaP5\\&quot; at check out.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!&lt;br /&gt;Pharmapacks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course this is the last time I will order from them. They sent me the wrong product they should have returned the full amount plus the shipping.</li>
    <li> Gets my teeth pretty clean. Has the calcium and fluoride together in one paste which I can&#x27;t find in most stores. My mouth was bleeding but regular brushing and flossing every day stopped this. Flavor isn&#x27;t bad and deodorizes. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Good stuff. Helps keep my teeth clean and refreshed. I look forward to using it 2X a day. I purchase it in bulk from Amazon and keep it on hand - no hassling at the local store. Good check ups with the dentist.</li>
    <li> all met my expectation</li>
    <li> Excellent tooth paste with added protection of liquid calcium, which heals cavities.  if you want the best reviews at the dentist, get this toothpaste.</li>
    <li> My dentist said this is the best. Leaves my mouth feeling truly refreshed. Glad to be doing what I can for dental health.</li>
    <li> Tastes a bit like Hydrogen Peroxide and Baking Soda, but not too bad.  It foams up well, so you can use the smallest drop.  Will likely last more than a year...  Some said it was hard to squeeze out of the tube.  Mine is not at all...</li>
    <li> nice to have products we use come right to our door and know that we can trust it will be timely and received in good order</li>
    <li> It helped with one tooth in the back that was very sensitive to cold.  I think it was because of the calcium in the toothpaste.  I do not see this particular one in the stores....does anyone know what you cannot find this in the stores with the calcium fluoride added.</li>
    <li> Our dentist recommended this toothpaste b/c it has liquid calcium, but it is very gritty, so my kids don&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> I brought this for my little brother and he says it&#x27;s a great toothpaste, but it&#x27;s taste is a little off.</li>
    <li> My dentist told me to use this toothpaste because it is among the least abrasive.  It save my teeth enamel.</li>
    <li> My son&#x27;s dentist recommended this toothpaste because his acid reflux is effecting his teeth. Unfortunately for me, it is hard to find in any store!  Luckily I found what I needed on Amazon. The price is not cheap, but reasonable and it was good to be able to order as many tubes as I wanted, since it is hard to come by. I was pleased to find what I needed and have it delivered to my door!</li>
    <li> I NOTICE THE DIFFERENCE IN MY TEETH.  IT DOES WHAT IT SAYS IT WILL DO.  YOU HAVE TO GET USED TO THE TASTE THOUGH.  YOU MAY HAVE TO ORDER IT ONLINE IN BULK.  COULD NOT FIND IT AT MY LOCAL WAL-GREENS</li>
    <li> This toothpaste uses the liquid calcium formula that used to be in Enamelon. It seems to have some actual whitening effects. Also seems to help with tooth sensitivity.</li>
    <li> I used to have this horrible burning sensation in my tongue that I had no idea how to get rid of. From researching on the internet I seen many suffered from this condition. Well after using this toothpaste for about a month that sensation disappeared. I can eat spicy food again! This toothpaste could have nothing to do with the cure but I think it certainly had an impact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I recommend this toothpaste to most people. I personally think it tastes good with a salty/sweet flavor. Your mouth feels so clean after using this toothpaste.  I will be buying this A&amp;H toothpaste as long as they make it.</li>
    <li> An excellent product at a good price, shipped promptly.</li>
    <li> good product! fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, this toothpaste gave us tooth pain. We had to discontinue using it and throw it out. We like other Arm and Hammer products.</li>
    <li> I love how the toothpaste has liquid calcium and cleans my teeth nicely. I have been using this toothpaste with it&#x27;s different names for 5 years. definitely wish I could find it more locally. Thanks for carrying a great product.</li>
    <li> My teeth feel great after use, but I will warn that the taste and smell aren&#x27;t anything to write home about.</li>
    <li> Toothpaste is a personal preference - whether for features like whitening or enamel care.  This one&#x27;s got a taste that isn&#x27;t overly sweet, and everything else I need, so that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s my preference.</li>
    <li> Tastes good, unlike some baking soda toothpaste products.  I like it!</li>
    <li> Great for my gum and teeth their is no sensitivity.</li>
    <li> This is the among the most expensive toothpaste I&#x27;ve purchased and for me it&#x27;s worth every penny. I have sensitive teeth and if I stop using it the sensitivity returns. It also has a decent taste and smell and feels very clean in the mouth. Good stuff.</li>
    <li> My wife and I have used Arm &amp; Hammer toothpaste for years and we like the way it cleans and polishes your teeth and freshens your breath. This toothpaste combines fresh minty flavor with liquid calcium to fill the cracks and crevices in your teeth to rebuild their strength. This strengthens the enamel by repairing the damage caused by acidic foods and drinks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately it also includes sodium carbonate peroxide in it which causes both my wife and I issues. I was unaware of this when I first began using this particular mixture of tooth paste and within 10 days I developed hyper sensitivity to hot and cold liquids which can be caused by using peroxide on your teeth. My wife actually breaks out in a rash when she uses toothpaste that contains peroxide and within the same 10 day period she began to break out around her lips. We try to make sure that we do not purchase toothpaste that has peroxide in it for these reasons and usually the active ingredients like peroxide are noted on the front of the box but in this case it is listed on the back of the box in the active ingredients list and on the side. If you are also allergic to peroxide then I thought you should be aware of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have since stopped using this particular mixture of Arm &amp; Hammer toothpaste but we still use other Arm &amp; Hammer toothpastes on a daily basis as it is our favorite brand.</li>
    <li> I have been pleased with this product. I have been using Colgate total for quite some time, though one or two of me teeth had become sensitive recently. I got this due to the fact that it has calcium and fluoride in it. My sensitivity went away after nearly a week. This toothpaste makes my teeth feel very clean for at least 1-2 hours after use. I like that it has baking soda, peroxide, fluoride, and calcium in it. I still use colgate total at night, which has triclosan, to get the best of both worlds. I just wish this toothpaste was easier to find.</li>
