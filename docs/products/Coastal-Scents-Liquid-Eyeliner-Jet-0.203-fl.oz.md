      <li>Super happy with it.</li>
      <li>has a good staying power and really easy to apply</li>
      <li>Works like a charm, Very easy to apply.</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t use eye product remover,I suggest a primer to make for an easy removal!</li>
      <li>This is by far the best liquid eyeliner, I love that the aplicator is penlike</li>

      <li>Glides on very smooth.</li>

      <li>yet it literally stays all day on my eyes love it</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay</li>
      <li>and I love it for that.</li>
      <li>There are better eyeliners out there.</li>

      <li>love it.</li>

      <li>Would love it if it were not for that issue.</li>
      <li>I love love love this eyeliner.</li>
      <li>but i love how it dries.</li>
      <li>I bought 3 different liquid eyeliners in an effort to find the best one.</li>
      <li>The eyeliner itself might be OK</li>
      <li>For $3, it&#x27;s merely an OK</li>
      <li>i love this eyeliner</li>
      <li>This was ok.</li>
      <li>Not my favorite.</li>
      <li>more could you ask for?</li>
      <li>Irritates my eyes, but so does most eye makeup.</li>
      <li>I bought this when it was about $3 and ordered 2 just to be safe.</li>
      <li>Love this liquid eyeliner.</li>
      <li>But it is better than some of the name brands that I have used</li>
      <li>The price is also a plus! Will definately buy more.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s a pretty good product.</li>
      <li>I love the color and the fine tip.  </li>
      <li>It stays put which is great because I have sensitive skin</li>
      <li>In fact, I loved it so much, I ran out and purchased this one...</li>
      <li>Very easy to use and comes off with mild soap.</li>
      <li>Its nice and looks good upon initial application, but ultimately would be better to just get a good quality one for a couple of bucks more!</li>
      <li>It makes for applying much more accurate and easy.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love liquid eyeliners and this one has a great applicator. The applicator is like a firm &amp;#34;sponge&amp;#34; and the tip has remained pointy for a long time. The eyeliner itself is easy to apply and easy to wash off.</li>
    <li> Goes on smooth and stays on.</li>
    <li> This eyeliner is amazing. It&#x27;s stay all day, even u wear till the morning.&lt;br /&gt;I would prefer a black one but they don&#x27;t have when I bought it. I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I like it a lot, it&#x27;s just hard for me to get used to the hard tip. Plus, since my eyes are wrinkly kinda, it left marks but it&#x27;s a pretty good product.</li>
    <li> I love the color and the fine tip.  But unfortunately after about 2 hours of wearing, my eyelids began to itch and burn like crazy! And the following morning after washing my face twice I couldn&#x27;t get it off. I don&#x27;t normally have sensitive skin, but this was definitely irritating.</li>
    <li> So now that I have it, this product is pretty good, but it smudges for me a little bit, and fades away after half a day(oily around the eyes). But it is better than some of the name brands that I have used</li>
    <li> It is a solid black color and goes on smoothly. Long wear time. The brush is firm, so if you&#x27;ve never used liquid eyeliner, it might take some practice to get the hang of it. I liked the firm brush because I felt I had more control with the line. Also, it feels like it is very watery at first, but it dries nicely and doesn&#x27;t flake. Overall, I really liked this liner :)</li>
    <li> Love it, does not smear! Great product</li>
    <li> Wow!  I never thought a cheap eyeliner like this would be so awesome!  It doesn&#x27;t smudge and lasts all day!  One of my favorites!</li>
    <li> Very nice point for precision. The liquid itself takes a awhile to dry but the finish is nice.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t last as long as other liners though.</li>
    <li> takes some time getting used to the hard brush but i love how it dries. it doesn&#x27;t crackle, it feels smooth, and it doesn&#x27;t smudge even when i rub my eyes. definitely a great deal</li>
    <li> I LOVE THE EYELINER. it was way better that my last Almay eyeliner. It is super cheap too. (:</li>
    <li> This stuff is my favorite liquid eye liner that I&#x27;ve ever used. I normally use Bare Minerals, Mac, or Clinique.... bit this stuff status on way better than the expensive brands and the price can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
    <li> Priced at $2.95 this is a great add on item since it qualifies for free shipping! This is cheaper than any eyeliner I&#x27;ve been able to get in stores ( other than 99 cent &amp;#34;wet and wild&amp;#34; crappy CVS brand. I like this one a lot. Unlike other liquid eyeliners that have a soft tip, I very much prefer this hard felt tip. Although the first time I&#x27;ve used this product, I love it! I didn&#x27;t even know they made hard tip applications. It makes for applying much more accurate and easy. Would purchase again as an add on!</li>
    <li> Watery and light colored. Did not do the trick</li>
    <li> Awesome eyeliner. Especially for the price! One thing I wasn&#x27;t a HUGE fan of was the felt tip applicator. It takes a little while to get used to, but once you&#x27;re used to it, you can do pretty much any eyeliner look you want to!</li>
    <li> The felt tip took a little bit of a learning curve but this is my new favorite! Jet black the didn&#x27;t run and even stayed when I fell asleep with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
    <li> i love this eyeliner i always purchase it</li>
    <li> Worst eyeliner I have ever purchased. It stabs at your eye when you try to put it on and it applies very, very lightly.</li>
    <li> Bought for my daughter she likes it alot.</li>
    <li> Lasts long and looks great</li>
    <li> This is actually great! I have been looking for a good one like this. Like a japanese product!</li>
    <li> Where do I start, there are so many things wrong with this eyeliner, I know it&#x27;s inexpensive but the reviews seemed ok, first of all it&#x27;s difficult to put on due to the tip being hard that it leaves streaks so I have to put on more layers which leads me to the second problem of flaking and leaving black dust under my eye, and lastly, it&#x27;s so difficult to wash off, it washes off in sections, I do a cat eye and it leaves the outline and washes off the part that was filled in. Terrible eyeliner.</li>
    <li> I have been using liquid eyeliner for sometime now and have tried all kinds of brands.  This one is really good and priced well.</li>
    <li> I needed a couple more dollars toward my total for free shipping, so I added this item on since it was only $2.99. It turned out to be a great decision!! This eyeliner is very easy to apply and it STAYS! I put it on the first day expecting to look like a raccoon (as per usual) by the time I got home for work. Nope, this stuff didn&#x27;t budge at all. I would very highly recommend this product to any woman.</li>
    <li> Love this liquid eyeliner. Was introduced to it when I received through Ipsy. Easy applicator. I&#x27;ve found others to be flimsy applicators and hard to keep a straight line on my eyelid. Stays on all day without running. Very affordable</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not wild about this eyeliner. I don&#x27;t care for the applicator. Isn&#x27;t very long lasting.</li>
    <li> Each morning when I apply this to my eyes and it doesn&#x27;t drag or run or flake, I am astounded at the price I paid. Each evening when I come home and my cat eye is still dark and precise and intact on my oily eyelids, I am astounded at the price I paid. This is a must for any makeup bag: totally budget friendly and good quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of the time you have to pay for quality but this is one of those wonderful, wonderful exceptions.</li>
    <li> This liner lasts all day! Love it!</li>
    <li> this eyeliner is marvelous!! its one of the only eyeliner that helps me make a perfect wing. i suggest buying this for any one who may want to start with a liquid eyeliner. thank you so much!!</li>
    <li> The color doesnt seem dark enough and the liner stick doesn&#x27;t go on as easy as i would like it to.</li>
    <li> I have to say I was suprised by this little liquid liner. I&#x27;ve been searching for one that is dark and a flat black. This definately fits the bill. It&#x27;s long lasting when using a primer (I use wet and wild fregie&#x27;s plain eye primer). Lasted all day and well into the night. It does seem to clump or flake when being taken off, but doesn&#x27;t leave you with raccoon eyes. The reason I gave it 4 stars is the tip. Yes the color is nice, but application is a bit tricky. The give on the pointed end of the tip compared to the rest of the tip makes application a bit skippy. Getting a nice smooth line would take someone with lots of liquid liner experience to get right. This is NOT for a beginner. I have been applying liquid liners for some time and it still took me a few tries. The tip is a bit too hard it be feasible to get a perfect line without some issues, but over all I love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve a cat eye queen! This stuff refuses to cake or clump!&lt;br /&gt;Best liquid eyeliner under $5 I&#x27;ve ever tried,and man,I&#x27;ve tried them ALL!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please know this: use a primer! This stuff is almost water proof it&#x27;s so awesome! If you don&#x27;t use eye product remover,I suggest a primer to make for an easy removal!</li>
    <li> EDIT....&lt;br /&gt;This lasted all of three days before the plastic wand broke and i was unable to use it at all. I found a better brand (essence) that has an awesome tip, awesome staying power, and amazing dark color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overview :&lt;br /&gt;What more could you ask for? I wash my face and it doesn&#x27;t budge, i have worn this through heat and humidity and it stayed put very well. I haven&#x27;t, however, rubbed this to see what kind of raccoon rings it leaves. When worn overnight, it just wore off. It didn&#x27;t leave jet black marks.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-This isn&#x27;t the type of liner that \\&quot;peels\\&quot; off.&lt;br /&gt;-super dark pigmentation&lt;br /&gt;-not too runny and not too gloppy&lt;br /&gt;- lines nice and thin but can build up to a thicker line&lt;br /&gt;-works just as well on lower lash line&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- the tip is not a soft tip...so although  it is very precise.. for those that aren&#x27;t use to a sharp sharpie tip, it may take longer to apply a thicker line. This tip, however, is perfect for lining bottom lash line&lt;br /&gt;-odd smell&lt;br /&gt;-priced at $7 if you choose not to purchase through amazon. But at $3 it&#x27;s a perfect filler to reach the $25 free shipping limit.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fine probably not the best</li>
    <li> Its nice and looks good upon initial application, but ultimately would be better to just get a good quality one for a couple of bucks more!</li>
    <li> For $3, it&#x27;s merely an OK product.&lt;br /&gt;It takes some time getting used to the hard tip, especially if you&#x27;ve only used soft-tip eyeliners before, but once you do, you get a very precise black line that stays on and doesn&#x27;t smudge. It dries really quickly and there&#x27;s no re-doing it without making a mess and having to scrub the whole thing off, so be sure to practice a bit before the first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s waterproof, and from my experience, everything-proof, really. I&#x27;ve scrubbed at it with different kinds of make-up removers, from wipes to facial scrubs, and it really is hard to remove. It does flake off after a while, though. The way it dries up, you can just wedge your nail under one end and pull the entire thing off of your eyelid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, I did not like using it and ended up buying a different eyeliner. The sharpie-like tip, the shiny dried-up paint look it gave me, and the way it would persistently stay on even after rubbing at it with make-up removing wipes - all that combined made for a rather poor-quality product.</li>
    <li> Great product for such a cheap price. It doesn&#x27;t dry out And last a very long time.</li>
    <li> Better and much less expensive that the CLIO eyeliner.  Will definitely repurchase!</li>
    <li> For the price it is hard to have complaints. It is hard to touch up, but it does the job.</li>
    <li> I love love love this eyeliner. I received it in an ipsy bag last month, and loved it so much, I bought another one from Amazon. It lasts all day,never have to reapply, and it is a nice matte black color. I also have sensitive skin, and this doesn&#x27;t bother my skin at all. It is hard to take off at night, but that is expected for an eyeliner that looks great all day. I love it.</li>
    <li> I originally received this in an Ipsy bag several months ago, and I had VERY low expectations for it. In fact, for a little while, I didn&#x27;t even open it, expecting it to be a poor excuse for liquid liner - especially when I normally where Tarte or Kat Von D. I was in a pickle one morning, though, having run out of my Tarte liner, and I opted for this bottle for a quick fix ... and WOW! I cannot believe how fabulous it is.. It&#x27;s a rich, jet black that sets like a boss - passes water, sweat, and rub tests. It&#x27;s perfect and easy to control. If I do make a mistake, I usually opt for a Q-tip dipped in makeup remover and that does the trick. My Neutrogena make up remover wipes gets rid of the liner at the end of the day, for those who said they couldn&#x27;t get it off. In fact, I loved it so much, I ran out and purchased this one... That kinda liner staying power and only $3? Can you say steal?!?! &amp;#60;3 &amp;#60;3 &amp;#60;3 Coastal Scents really outdid themselves here.</li>
    <li> In regards to some of the negative reviews I read prior to purchasing this for myself ..1).the product did not seem that difficult to me to remove. I just use a simple eye makeup remover and it comes right off.2) The applicator does not seem any lesser quality than other more expensive/department store brands that I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;The product stays on well and is easy to apply. The color does seem very black, which it is supposed to be, but in comparison to others the black seems more rich. For the price this is an excellent product that I would buy again.</li>
    <li> I loooove the tip for the eyeliner and the eyeliner it&#x27;s self. I&#x27;m extremely impressed by the quality of this product. You should definitely consider purchasing this product.</li>
    <li> eyeliner goes on very smoothly and evenly and is especially affordable.  Would buy this product again especially if a prime item</li>
    <li> I LOVE this eyeliner.  I was given a bottle of it about a month ago, and I have gotten rid of all other eyeliners I owned.  This is the only eyeliner I will use from now on.  It has a wonderful tip applicator, glides on smooth, and stays where put.  It looks fantastic and I get lots of compliments.  I will be ordering this eyeliner from now on !!!</li>
    <li> In all my hundreds of purchases on Amazon, this is actually my first time rating a product. I love this eyeliner. It&#x27;s the darkest and best liquid I&#x27;ve ever used. Unfortunately, it makes my eyes swell up horribly. Four days.  I thought it was just me, but, in fact, it&#x27;s the eyeliner. :(</li>
    <li> Makes my eyes itchy due to flaking.  Would love it if it were not for that issue. Will not be ordering again.</li>
    <li> This was ok. A little too runny for me. There are better eyeliners out there. I think the Tom Ford Eyeliner and Kevyn Aucoin liquid eyeliners are better. Though pricier, they are much darker, last longer, and easier to apply. [...]</li>
    <li> Smears everywhere almost instantly, I threw it away immediately.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite eyeliner. After going through different brands, and different types (gel, pencils, etc.), this one definitely gets the job done.  It is long lasting and doesn&#x27;t smudge after it&#x27;s dried.  Exactly what I need to last all day long</li>
    <li> The line it makes it&#x27;s wonderful, so fine , excatly what I was looking for</li>
    <li> Doesnt stay! The first time i wore it was at home to check how long it can stay, so no wind, no dust or whatsoever.. AC environment i wasnt even moving too much.. I never tested if its waterproof though, it was gone even before i decided to wash it off LMAO!! No thanks..</li>
    <li> Nice color, goes on easy and evenly, like it much better the the ELF stuff I used before, but doesn&#x27;t last quite as long.</li>
    <li> Long lasting eyeliner.</li>
    <li> Perfect for the price! lasts all day</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic eyeliner, its covers well and gives you complete control over the motions!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it says water proof, it SERIOUSLY is. To the point where wipes, face wash and makeup removers kind of tend to leave me with a slightly overworked swollen eye. The only other complaint I have is that the brush isn&#x27;t very smooth, however, it makes up for it in its preciseness. Go ahead and buy it, Coastal Scents is a wonderful brand and a true competitor to MAC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT:&lt;br /&gt;Worst applicator on this planet, gets worse every time.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for! This is the prefect inky black eyeliner that I have been trying to find. It lasts all day and is easy to apply. If you are looking for a wand with a brush so you can do a flick this is not it. The wand is is a plastic tip, but that&#x27;s what I wanted.</li>
    <li> This product left me with blisters, swelling, and oozing sores along my eyelids. I cannot put into words how painful that experience was. I don&#x27;t even have particularly sensitive skin, but there is something in this product that I reacted strongly to. I just want to put this warning out there. This was scary and extremely painful. Spend the extra money on a name brand, quality product.</li>
    <li> The brush on this is fantastic. Fantastic. I don&#x27;t have the steadiest hand but the thin enough brush made it easy to get winged liner. If I full on scratch my eye, a few parts has a 50/50 percent chance of flaking off ( which is pretty amazing). If you are very careful/ don&#x27;t touch your eyes it will stay on until you wash it off. The color is a beautiful bold, dark black. I bought this when it was about $3 and ordered 2 just to be safe. Best decision I made because I will definitely buy again once the price is reasonable even though the product is worth much much more than what it&#x27;s currently priced.</li>
    <li> bought this for my girlfriend, and she loved it!</li>
    <li> has a good staying power and really easy to apply</li>
    <li> Makes precise dark lines. Could be used to create temporary body art, not &amp;#34;just&amp;#34; eyeliner. Fun product!</li>
    <li> DEMASIADO BUENO, SUPER COOL EXCELENTE CALIDAD DE PRODUCTO.&lt;br /&gt;ME GUSTO PORQUE ES UN PRODUCTO DE ALTA CALIDAD ADEMAS DEL RENDIMIENTO QUE TIENE.</li>
    <li> Irritates my eyes, but so does most eye makeup.</li>
    <li> Nice and dark and goes on super smooth!</li>
    <li> This product is not good for eyelining near your inner lids.  It runs, luckily it doesn&#x27;t burn.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure some people love his product but for me the very stiff application brush isn&#x27;t to my liking. It hurts more than anything. I won&#x27;t be buying this in the future.</li>
    <li> The thin top of this product allows me to transform myself into a black cat like the one on Sabrina the teenage witch. Plus it doesn&#x27;t smudge when I cry my eyes out.</li>
    <li> This eyeliner is pretty decent for its price. I prefer the Sephora brand liquid eyeliner but this one isn&#x27;t bad considering its about half the price. I use it to make a cat eye and it&#x27;s not bad! Only downside is that the brush is pretty stiff, but that could be a good thing depending on what you use it for.</li>
    <li> This is my third review of this product because I love it so much!   Listen:  I wore this eye liner for an entire day at this water park, through the wave pool and pool slides and it stayed on!!!   if that&#x27;s not enough to buy this product, I don&#x27;t know what is.  This is an amazing buy!  I&#x27;m actually here buying another one.  It stays put which is great because I have sensitive skin and my eyes tend to water which causes all my other liquid eyeliners to run, but not this one and I love it for that. I also tend to prefer a felt tip to a brush tip for easier application. Can&#x27;t recommend this enough.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this eyeliner!!!</li>
    <li> It reeked of a chemical smell (almost like paint fume - NOT something you want on your skin) the moment I opened it, but I still tried it on for a lack of a better judgment. The area where I had it on stung for a few hours, then later as I washed it off and it got in my eyes, my eyes began to sting quite badly. Soon, the skin around my eyes became itchy, red and somewhat swollen, until the next day, and even the day after that.    My eyes do tend to be a bit sensitive, but I&#x27;ve never had that strong of a reaction to a product. I&#x27;m not allergic to any of the ingredients in particular, though I guess that could be a possibility, seeing as it is filled with so many chemicals. Nonetheless, even if your eyes aren&#x27;t sensitive, I still wouldn&#x27;t recommend using such a harsh product on them. I know it&#x27;s cheap, but it&#x27;s just not worth even that.</li>
    <li> The liner provides a very smooth black thin line. Very easy to use and comes off with mild soap.</li>
    <li> This is the best liquid liner I have ever bought! it stays put without any running or bleeding and has a great applicator tip.</li>
    <li> It is a good, rich black color but I&#x27;m not a fan of the hard, felt tip pen like applicator. I find it pulls on my lids and my preference is a fine brush. I also want to warn you, be careful not to let the liner get on your lashes because it dries quickly..almost to a plastic texture and your eyelashes will clump. I had to do my eyeliner and then immediately brush on mascara before it had a chance to dry. One eye at a time. Not my favorite. Won&#x27;t be using this again. I prefer wet n wild for my cheapey liquid liner, product and applicator.</li>
    <li> I bought 6 of these &amp; by the time I was ready to use another bottle I realized the jar was empty &amp; the wand tip was white &amp; dry. I couldn&#x27;t contact the seller since I was no longer eligible to return it &amp; ask for a replacement...other than that, I do like it &amp; it&#x27;s easy to apply &amp; it lasts all day. Although if you do have oily eyelids like I do, I suggest to use primer &amp; pressed powder prior to applying it. I would give it a 5 but since I have 1 empty bottle, I will give it a 3</li>
    <li> love it. only wish the brush was more fine</li>
    <li> This is by far the best liquid eyeliner, I love that the aplicator is penlike and you can line your eyes easily. The price is also a plus! Will definately buy more.</li>
    <li> I had misconceptions about liquid eyeliner.  I thought you had to have a really steady hand and some sort of artistic talent.  I decided to try this stuff because the price is pretty unbeatable, so if it was a giant fail it wasn&#x27;t that much money wasted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using eyeliner pencils for the past ten years or so.  Normally all of my makeup has smeared/smudged/sweat off by mid-afternoon and I have to touch it up 2-3 times a day.  With this stuff, I can go all day and night without it budging.  Even in rain or sweat from the gym, it stays put.  I can even run my finger over it with some pressure and it doesn&#x27;t come off at all.  I&#x27;m amazed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And you really don&#x27;t have to be an artist.  The applicator is like a stiff paintbrush that helps you draw straight lines.  You can draw thicker lines if you push down on it, like a real paintbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve been spending $7-8 on eyeliner pencils when this stuff exists.  I&#x27;ll NEVER go back.</li>
    <li> WHOA! I bought 3 different liquid eyeliners in an effort to find the best one. Can I just say...THIS WAS EASILY THE BEST! I figured it wouldn&#x27;t be that great because it was so cheap but, man! It rocks! Stays put! I apply it and don&#x27;t even have to worry about it for the rest of the day. Super happy with it.</li>
    <li> Good product, a bit light in color and not as black as would of liked it to look on my eyes.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, it&#x27;s inexpensive, jet black, and it stays on all day. definitely water and smudge proof, which I like. But that&#x27;s also the problem with it.... it stays on too well. I take a shower, wash my face, use make-up remover and some of it is still on!  After i finally get it off my eyes, my eyes are sore and irritated. Other than that, its great!</li>
    <li> This is an awesome eyeliner. The color payoff is an amazing intense black. Only downfall is the smell its a little too strong for me but other then that great liquid eyeliner</li>
    <li> Wonderful product&lt;br /&gt;Fast Shipping</li>
    <li> I used this for some of my halloween makeup. it went on sooth and stayed on all night which made me happy</li>
    <li> Love this liner. The tip is nice in thin which I love since I don&#x27;t like to wear my liner thick like I used to. Wear this almost everyday. Not hard to take off like I&#x27;ve read from other reviews. Only thing I don&#x27;t like is that this product is an add on item :/</li>
    <li> Great product. The liner goes on clean and even. I can&#x27;t wait to try the other colors. It is easy to wash off also.</li>
    <li> For being so cheap this is great eyeliner. I haven&#x27;t used liquid eyeliner in a few years so I&#x27;m a little rusty, but the brush makes applying it very easy and it dries quickly so if you need to blink it wont mess up your makeup. If you do make a mistake it&#x27;s very easy to take a makeup wipe and remove it without disturbing the rest of your makeup because it doesn&#x27;t smudge very much, which is a huge plus.</li>
    <li> THIS IS A GREAT RODUCT AND A GREAT PRICE! I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND!!!</li>
    <li> This is the first liquid eyeliner I have ever used, so please keep that in mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works very well. It dries quickly, stays put all day, and showed no signs of flaking or smearing. I did use an eyeshadow primer, however (Urban Decay Eyeshadow Primer Potion).&lt;br /&gt;The brush felt a bit strange to me, but that could be due to my unfamiliarity with liquid eyeliners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a nice little product for the price (and great for reaching the $25 free shipping price).</li>
    <li> The eyeliner itself might be OK but the applicator came off and separated from the cap after my second use.</li>
    <li> Would definitely recommend. Goes on smooth and stays on. I would definitely buy again. Great price for having a spare eyeliner.</li>
    <li> Stays all day nice and dark doesn&#x27;t hurt when you get it in your eyes easy to remove also I use over my mascara to make my lashes full all day long with out them clumping</li>
    <li> got this eyeliner in my January ipsy bag. It is my new favorite liner. The applicator is so easy to control so you get the exact look you want. I use this especially when I want to do winged liner because it so easy to just draw them on just how I like.</li>
    <li> This eyeliner has a fine tip so it&#x27;s easy to create bold, clean lines. I also love that it doesn&#x27;t run all day (unless you get it wet).</li>
    <li> Love this product!! Easy to use, strong lines and I&#x27;m almost convinced this stuff is bullets proof because it stays on so well! Not a bad price either...</li>
    <li> The applicator makes it easy to apply. It doesn&#x27;t clump on the applicator. I will definitely be ordering this again.</li>
    <li> Smooth, thin line.  Not clumpy.  Rich, dark color.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay but it has fumes that screw with my eyes and make them water a bunch, so I don&#x27;t use it all that often.</li>
    <li> best eyeliner yet it literally stays all day on my eyes love it</li>
    <li> Love it! Works like a charm, Very easy to apply.</li>
    <li> So smooth, so sleek, so black! Love this eyeliner!</li>
    <li> Love it, very deep black and glides on nicely</li>
    <li> Glides on very smooth. I like that the brush itself is thin in case your hand is a little jittery. Any mistakes are easily fixed. Doesn&#x27;t dry like a cake! Lasts all day.</li>
    <li> loved it, use it every day</li>
    <li> Just as described and arrived on time.</li>
    <li> I have never used liquid liner before so I have nothing to compare it too. Make sure you have some good eye make up remover in case you make a mistake this product is water proof</li>
