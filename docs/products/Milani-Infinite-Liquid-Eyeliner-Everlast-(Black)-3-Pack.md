      <li>and you can easily fix your mistake.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also great for those occasional \\&quot;sleepovers\\&quot; -</li>
      <li>I have been using it since I got it for around 3 months, so far so good.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m still searching for that perfect applicator, but as far as actual liner product - this one&#x27;s for me!</li>
      <li>, I have great results with Clinique&#x27;s eye makeup remover (the one in the pink bottle).  </li>
      <li>I recently tried Maybelline&#x27;s gel liner (pot and brush), and although I LOVED how it applied, the stuff smudges and disappears by mid-day.  </li>
      <li>Finally I decided to search from the web, and found Milani Infinite Liquid Eyeliner which been so so good as what it described from the web link...</li>

      <li>This is the best eyeliner if you need water proof and long lasting.</li>
      <li>Also, it&#x27;s great for nights at the club when you&#x27;re getting a little sweaty from all the dancing.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s way way worth it since I need the result of the product.</li>
      <li>This eyeliner really stays put.  </li>
      <li>I really like this eyeliner as it stays on all day.  </li>
      <li>and that is thru a whole day of work and exercise</li>
      <li>This past xmas, I gifted the liner to my girlfriends who have always commented on how well</li>
      <li>Wow!</li>
      <li>I give this four stars instead of five for this reason:  the thin brush is not my favorite applicator!  </li>
      <li>I had a rich, black line on my hand for 3 days.</li>
      <li>(the provided brush is too soft to my liking).</li>
      <li>It takes a few tries to get used to the semi-liquid semi-gel consistency and you might need to use another kind of brush depending on your preference</li>
      <li>Long lasting, smudge proof, excellent thin or thick lines to give a bold effect</li>
      <li>This is like magic, seriously.</li>

<li> of advice , once applied let it dry</li>
<li> Also if it&#x27;s dry and you need to remove , any oil will do the trick.</li>
<li> Every single eyeliner smudges on my eyes after about an hour.</li>
<li> EVERY single eyeliner.</li>
<li> : keep tightly capped and don&#x27;t leave the brush outside of the bottle for too long.</li>
<li> Bought this in stores a long time ago and couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere!!</li>
<li> I always try to find this product in my local drug store, but its always sold out in black and brown.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve even fallen asleep and the next day it was still wearable although it starts to get a little flaky.</li>
<li> One thing I noticed, though, whenever I use it my eyes dry out for some reason; I don&#x27;t have that reaction with other eyeliners.</li>
<li> I leave on when I&#x27;m working out, at work, even in military training.</li>
<li> The applicator is too wide for my liking, and the swatch did not come off for 3 days....</li>
<li> Be very careful putting on, as If  you miss,  that area will be black for a very long time too.</li>
<li> I have had other brands that would smear and this one doesnt.</li>
<li> After a few weeks, the brush loses its initial firmness and the eyeliner STARTS to become stickier on the applicator.  </li>
<li> If you mess up, just dip a q-tip in coconut oil</li>
<li> The tearing eye been worse and messing up so bad on my eye make up, especially my eyes need eye liner to look good, I have used all expensive ones like Lancome, MAC.. which did not work.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s waterproof, non-smudge and non-smear promised, but it takes time or art work to put on, sometimes it&#x27;s a little mess and also it takes a little longer to take it off</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a little oily, but it does the trick.  </li>
<li> After a few days, it will flake off if I don&#x27;t remove it with makeup remover...</li>
<li> otherwise it can be messy on the eyelid .</li>
<li> It can be difficult to get off without the proper remover; I use waterproof eye makeup remover pads by Almay and it comes off with no problem.</li>
<li> I scrubbed so hard, and used makeup remover.</li>
<li> If they ever discontinue this, I will be seriously upset.</li>
<li> been tired in it,</li>
<li> THAT is the bad news.  </li>

    <li> This is the best eyeliner ever! For easy removal use coconut oil! If you mess up, just dip a q-tip in coconut oil and you can easily fix your mistake.</li>
    <li> I really like this eyeliner as it stays on all day.  I have had other brands that would smear and this one doesnt.</li>
    <li> Great quality fast shipping</li>
    <li> Me and my daughter have been using this product for years and my store stopped selling it. I recommend this to any girl who uses eye liner. It stays on all day from day to night and does not come off till you take it off and that is thru a whole day of work and exercise I never have to worry that it will flake</li>
    <li> Been using this product for some time and I must say, I love it. Long lasting, smudge proof, excellent thin or thick lines to give a bold effect</li>
    <li> Every single eyeliner smudges on my eyes after about an hour. EVERY single eyeliner. I have had raccoon eyes for years until I discovered this. It is soooo affordable and it doesn&#x27;t budge whatsoever. It even lasts when I sleep with it on and when I take showers. Amazing!! After a few days, it will flake off if I don&#x27;t remove it with makeup remover...but it still won&#x27;t smudge. Wow! This is like magic, seriously. If they ever discontinue this, I will be seriously upset.</li>
    <li> This is a great waterproof eyeliner , once it&#x27;s on it&#x27;s like cement. I love it ... I&#x27;ve even gone swimming and it still stays on.&lt;br /&gt;Word of advice , once applied let it dry otherwise it can be messy on the eyelid . Also if it&#x27;s dry and you need to remove , any oil will do the trick. Even olive oil.</li>
    <li> Totally love this stuff. I wear for two-three days in a row and it doesn&#x27;t fade. I leave on when I&#x27;m working out, at work, even in military training.</li>
    <li> This is the best eyeliner I have tried.  It stays in place and lasts all day long.</li>
    <li> This liner stays put!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am routinely the only one in the swimming pool or at the beach whose eyes are still perfectly lined. Also, it&#x27;s great for nights at the club when you&#x27;re getting a little sweaty from all the dancing. (Have you noticed how some girls get raccoon eyes? Not me) It&#x27;s also great for those occasional \\&quot;sleepovers\\&quot; - you wake up in the morning  with your makeup still looking fresh!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone I ever recommended this to has loved the liner as well. This past xmas, I gifted the liner to my girlfriends who have always commented on how well my liner holds.&lt;br /&gt;The colors are great too!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: keep tightly capped and don&#x27;t leave the brush outside of the bottle for too long. Liner will thicken-up.</li>
    <li> My right eye has been tearing for years but lately been worst, and I went to see an ophthalmologist who suggested surgery for tear duct blocked, and I was very upset that even I was brave enough to take the surgery which did not work. The tearing eye been worse and messing up so bad on my eye make up, especially my eyes need eye liner to look good, I have used all expensive ones like Lancome, MAC.. which did not work.  Finally I decided to search from the web, and found Milani Infinite Liquid Eyeliner which been so so good as what it described from the web link... I am very happy to find this product.  It&#x27;s waterproof, non-smudge and non-smear promised, but it takes time or art work to put on, sometimes it&#x27;s a little mess and also it takes a little longer to take it off but it&#x27;s way way worth it since I need the result of the product. I have been using it since I got it for around 3 months, so far so good.  There was compliant about the product that it cannot take it off. I use the Target eye makeup remover which will definitely do the job.  Again I am very very happy with the product, I will minimize the embarrassment in the meetings or anywhere meeting people with black smudged/messy eyes by using other product of eye liner, even I took a shower with it and it still stays on, how amazing...THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE GOOD PRODUCT!!!!</li>
    <li> It is indeed water-proof. I&#x27;m Asian with mono-lids and it is HARD to find a reliable eyeliner, but this one does not fail mid-sweaty day. It takes a few tries to get used to the semi-liquid semi-gel consistency and you might need to use another kind of brush depending on your preference (the provided brush is too soft to my liking). One thing I noticed, though, whenever I use it my eyes dry out for some reason; I don&#x27;t have that reaction with other eyeliners. Overall, the benefits outweigh the minor discomfort and I do recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great product love it!</li>
    <li> I give this four stars instead of five for this reason:  the thin brush is not my favorite applicator!  After a few weeks, the brush loses its initial firmness and the eyeliner STARTS to become stickier on the applicator.  THAT is the bad news.  The good news:  THIS STUFF HAS STAYING POWER!!!  I LOVE THAT!  No raccoon eyes.  I&#x27;ve been swimming in it, cried in it, been tired in it, c&#x27;mon - I&#x27;ve even slept with it still on.  NOT A SMUDGE!  NOT A SMEAR!  Good deal!  and to the reviewer who said she (he?) was concerned with getting the stuff off, I have great results with Clinique&#x27;s eye makeup remover (the one in the pink bottle).  It&#x27;s a little oily, but it does the trick.  I recently tried Maybelline&#x27;s gel liner (pot and brush), and although I LOVED how it applied, the stuff smudges and disappears by mid-day.  No, thank you.  I&#x27;m still searching for that perfect applicator, but as far as actual liner product - this one&#x27;s for me!</li>
    <li> This is the best eyeliner if you need water proof and long lasting.</li>
    <li> This eyeliner really stays put.  Be very careful putting on, as If  you miss,  that area will be black for a very long time too.</li>
    <li> This is stuff is awesome. I&#x27;ve gone swimming, wake boarding, running (sweating my ass off), cried my eyes out and it didn&#x27;t budge! I&#x27;ve even fallen asleep and the next day it was still wearable although it starts to get a little flaky. It can be difficult to get off without the proper remover; I use waterproof eye makeup remover pads by Almay and it comes off with no problem. The only thing I wold change is the applicator brush.</li>
    <li> The only eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever used. Great quality and inexpensive ,plus stays on all day.</li>
    <li> I bought this in a store, and before putting it on, I swatched it. The applicator is too wide for my liking, and the swatch did not come off for 3 days....I scrubbed so hard, and used makeup remover. I had a rich, black line on my hand for 3 days. It&#x27;s color and staying power rocks, but I don&#x27;t recommend this because of the  difficulty of removal.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Milani infinite eyeliner for over 2 years, and nothing can compare. This product is so waterproof you can leave it on for 2 days and it won&#x27;t flake off, smudge or lose pigmentation. I always try to find this product in my local drug store, but its always sold out in black and brown.  To remove just use coconut or olive oil, works like a charm!</li>
    <li> Bought this in stores a long time ago and couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere!! This is the legit same liner, best waterproof! Good price &amp; fast shipping</li>
