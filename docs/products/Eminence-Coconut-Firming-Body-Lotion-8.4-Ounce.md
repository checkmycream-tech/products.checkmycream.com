      <li>Pretty expensive.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Bought for first time when visiting desert in winter.  </li>
      <li>I have never had much luck with lotions until I found this!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried regular store brands (i.e., Vaseline), and although they suffice, the quality of this Eminence body lotion is a whole lot better.  </li>
      <li>I decided to try some of the products in the Eminence Organics line after much research - I liked the fact they were considered organic without hidden additives.  </li>
      <li>Amazing cream really firm tge skin</li>
      <li>I really like this cream.</li>

      <li>therefore I unscrew the top and put small amounts into containers with screw off tops.  </li>
      <li>I may just stick with the lemon cleanser &amp; buy a different lotion because I&#x27;m not sure if I want to spend that kind of money to take a chance on another yucky smell.</li>
      <li>I will definitely purchase again; just wish it didn&#x27;t cost so much.</li>
      <li>They are made in Hungary and are all natural.  </li>
      <li>I Use it all year round, and my skin is fabulous.</li>
      <li>i love the natural coconut smell - yet it is not overwhelming!</li>
      <li>I live in a very dry climate and it is very moisturizing.</li>
      <li>do like other Eminence products very much though.</li>
      <li>They are more pricey but do last a very long time because it takes less each time you use the product.</li>
      <li>I am not noticing firmness on my arms or legs but maybe a few weeks isn&#x27;t enough time to notice true results.  </li>
      <li>Not sure it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>

    <li> It smells wonderful, rich and creamy, but the main thing is my skin has never looked or felt so good. It&#x27;s absorbs quickly, no oily or greasy film. Bought for first time when visiting desert in winter.  I Use it all year round, and my skin is fabulous.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not noticing huge firming benefits but my skin feels amazing soft when I use this after exfoliating with the coconut sugar scrub! I just wished it had more of a coconut aroma.</li>
    <li> This smells heavenly, and definitely makes a difference the longer I use it!  I will definitely want it again! It&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
    <li> I love all of the eminence products, Smells really good and makes your skin really soft. Highly recommend this lotion</li>
    <li> Great smell and definitely helps cellulite. It isn&#x27;t greasy or sticky..just feels like silk on your skin! This has corrected my dry skin issue altogether! I have never had much luck with lotions until I found this!</li>
    <li> I really like this cream. It goes a long way and does helm my skin feel smooth and very soft.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin, so I&#x27;m picky about the moisturizers I use.  I really love this lotion by Eminence for it is very hydrating and dries fairly quickly.  I&#x27;ve tried regular store brands (i.e., Vaseline), and although they suffice, the quality of this Eminence body lotion is a whole lot better.  My skin feels firmer and well-hydrated throughout the day.  I just wish they could have more lotion in the bottle (I guess that&#x27;s the price you pay for quality).</li>
    <li> Quality lotion. Been using this with carnosine and can tell a subtle difference in the firmness of my skin. I only use once a day when I remember and I also mix it with another generic lotion to make it last longer. I am sure if I used directly and twice a day I would experience even better results. Still a little goes a long way. Scent is light, coconut with hints of vanilla. Personally I prefer floral scents. I will definitely purchase again; just wish it didn&#x27;t cost so much.</li>
    <li> People seem to rave about this line, but I find that it&#x27;s just OK.  The lotion is thick and moisturizing.  However, I question whether this line is actually organic and based on the ingredient list for this product, my guess is that it&#x27;s not, so the name is misleading.</li>
    <li> The lotion is nice feeling . I love Eminence products , however the smell of the coconut firming lotion is not good . I may just stick with the lemon cleanser &amp; buy a different lotion because I&#x27;m not sure if I want to spend that kind of money to take a chance on another yucky smell.</li>

    <li> Nice Smell. Does it firm? Had to say.</li>
    <li> Healthy ingredients, but so heavily scented I couldn&#x27;t use.  Gave to my mom and she passed it along too because of the very heavy scent.</li>
    <li> I like this but I think I prefer the Monoi (also by Eminence) body lotion better. Feels and smells good. No complaints!</li>
