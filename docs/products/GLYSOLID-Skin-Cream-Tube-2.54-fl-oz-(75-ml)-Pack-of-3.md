    <li> Quality product, does come off in water, not sticky, have used for years</li>
    <li> On a recent TV show A dermatologist recommended using hand creams with high glycerin content. After reading the ingredients, I purchased Glysolid cream in tubes to carry in my purse and a jar of the solid for home use. It is very moisturizing and softens my hands. I carry the tubes with me and use the jar for over night. The cream in the tubes soaks in very quickly softening my hands. Thru the years I&#x27;ve used many different hand creams but none as effective as this Glysolid. When the tubes are gone I&#x27;ll be purchasing more. I highly recommend it. The only negative is that I wish they offered larger tubes of a pump container of the cream.</li>

    <li> The best skin protection ever!!!</li>
