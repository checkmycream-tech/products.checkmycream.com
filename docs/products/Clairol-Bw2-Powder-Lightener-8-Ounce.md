      <li>The big tub is the best value for those who bleach often-</li>
      <li>I have been using different powder bleaches for over 20 years and this is the best one made!  </li>
      <li>This is OK....</li>
      <li>; This is great for people who have medium brown hair and want a high lifting shade.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great product and I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>and this is pretty good.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s actually pretty good.</li>
      <li>The 8 oz tub is a great value too - mine lasted me nearly a year!</li>
      <li>This brand good one too and it help make white on deer and elk skull so best to mixed this BW2 and Volume 30 together to make sure it become thicken and start using paint brush put all over elk and deer skull just paint all over it and wait for 3 hrs.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s strong, but not too strong to the point where it irritates your eyes and skin.</li>
      <li>this is by far the best bleach I&#x27;ve found for my hair &amp; when you&#x27;ve got a lot of hair, its nice having the extra powder instead of guessing with the packets.</li>
      <li>:) bought 2, and willing to buy again. :)</li>
      <li>I used a 30 cream developer and it turned out fine.</li>
      <li>After much research, I settled on Clairol&#x27;s Bw2 Powder Lightener, and I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
      <li>Plus such a huge tub for a great price</li>
      <li>I am never disappointed with my amazon purchases.</li>
      <li>I used a blue powder bleach on most of the hair and my blue colored hair dye came out perfect.</li>
      <li>last awhile - great price, fast shipping!</li>
      <li>Tried and true product.</li>
      <li>It lifts quick and doesn&#x27;t break my skin out like some bleaches.  </li>
      <li>to.&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Quick</li>
      <li>but its pretty light now.</li>
      <li>Super quick and powerful.</li>
      <li>this make bright white color look real skull.</li>
      <li>well worth the money</li>
      <li>Have fun.  </li>
      <li>But after a couple of attempts, I got bolder and went right for the 40 developer.</li>
      <li>Blue\\&quot; has a lot of positive reviews, but it just doesn&#x27;t seem to lighten as quick as this does for me.</li>
      <li>My first order got messed up, but when I received it, I used it right away.</li>
      <li>Bleaches well, doesn&#x27;t do good with black hair though.</li>
      <li>It lightens quickly without providing much damage.</li>
      <li>Overall, pleased with results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: Despite being dedusted, the smell is still VERY strong and you must open a window or have some ventilation.</li>
      <li>Ahhhhhhh.........the perfect pale yellow color as per a review by another reviewer.  </li>
      <li>My hair turned pretty blonde the second time which is great because i&#x27;ve had my hair turn orange after bleaching before.</li>
      <li>my butt didn&#x27;t even have very much in</li>
      <li>So if I wanted to change the color of my hair, I was going to have to bleach it first.</li>
      <li>so make sure the room has proper ventilation.</li>
      <li>EXACTLY</li>
      <li>Most of my hair was bleached by Igora Blue.</li>
      <li>First, package arrived with the lid taped on and a bread tie surrounding the plastic bag inside.</li>
      <li>I have used some products that bothered me less, but this one is strong and so good enough for me.</li>
      <li>Other bleaches fry my hair but my hair was still quite manageable after this, This tub is nice and big, I was able to do my whole chest length hair with one tub.</li>
      <li>I was a bit confused about the measurements, and how the mix had to be, as there weren&#x27;t really any good instructions, but once you figure it out, it&#x27;s all too easy.</li>
      <li>I must add that the reviews and instructions left by other buyers are great.  </li>
      <li>If you are really scarred try on strand of hair under first check the time etc then go for the rest.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
      <li>good product just small tub...</li>
      <li>My hair is a lovely high honey blonde color thanks to this</li>
      <li>Of course I&#x27;m not done yet but for the first round it did great especially since it was diluted with shampoo.</li>
      <li>Although I believe it could lighten a little better, but overall a solid, good lightener that will defenitly lighten your hair.</li>
      <li>I use this bleach every few weeks and it is amazing.  </li>
      <li>BE A LOT MORE CAREFUL if you hair is longer than shoulder length.</li>
      <li>this bleach does its job, and does it very well.</li>
      <li>I would say though this product is not entirely dust free and it bothered my eyes and my nose a lot</li>
      <li>Sometimes it corrects my roots very well, but sometimes It does not.</li>
      <li>If going from darker to light you will defenitly notice a different.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Used too much...... I disappeared</li>
    <li> &amp;#34; This is great for people who have medium brown hair and want a high lifting shade. This lifted my roots from medium brown (around a level 5) to platinum with a 40 volume developer. (maybe i should have used a 30) &amp;#34;</li>
    <li> it is save  on hair better than other ,espl. if you know the white powder for hair ,and the blue powder for body small hair</li>
    <li> Great product! I have hair a little past my breast and I was able to do my hair two times with a little left over. My hair turned pretty blonde the second time which is great because i&#x27;ve had my hair turn orange after bleaching before. Damage was how you would expect, but got better within a few days of deep conditioning. For the price I think its great and I would buy again. I cant say how it is compared to other brands because I have only tried splat other than this but It definitely is better than splat (and cheaper).</li>
    <li> I normally get my hair color bleached at the salon, but lately I couldn&#x27;t find time to make it to the salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Clairol BW2 works well. It&#x27;s strong, but not too strong to the point where it irritates your eyes and skin. Some powders do irritate your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it. But do purchase the small package first and see how it works. That&#x27;s what I did.</li>
    <li> Feeling that the salon prices are outrageous for coloring services, I decided, like many other women, to do it myself.&lt;br /&gt;Based on the favorable reviews, I selected this product for my developer.  I must add that the reviews and instructions left by other buyers are great.  My confidence level was elevated and I bravely went where I had never been before - -&lt;br /&gt;to the bathroom to highlight my own hair!  I used this developer in combination with the Clairol BW2 Powder Lightener and after pulling my hair through the Magicap Tipping Cap, I applied the developer and lightener, waited the suggested amount of time, rinsed, and peeked at the results.........Ahhhhhhh.........the perfect pale yellow color as per a review by another reviewer.  (THANK YOU!!!)  She advised that in order to get silvery highlights/color, the hair must be bleached to a pale yellow color or the toner/color would not result in the desired outcome.  I then applied WELLA Color Charm - T14 Silver Lady and MY developer, waited, rinsed and..............PERFECT!!!  Gorgeous, deliciously shiney, silvery highlights.  And best of all?  I know now that I can do it myself without reservation.  Plus, I got the &amp;#34;Hubby Seal of Approval.&amp;#34;  He kept repeating, &amp;#34;I can&#x27;t believe you did this by yourself.&amp;#34;  Actually, I didn&#x27;t - - my&lt;br /&gt;Amazon buddies were with me every step of the way!!!</li>
    <li> I like my Clairol tub powder lightener, its very good..the mixture of the powder lightener come out real thick when I mixe it together..goog, good. thank/</li>
    <li> Great value, great product.</li>
    <li> If you know how to use it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I received a tub that was 1) already open and the lid taped on 2) the bag inside was clearly open and had a bread tie on it to keep it closed 3) no instructions 4) I weighed the powder and it was only a little over 4 oz!!!</li>
    <li> This bleach no matter how light it get&#x27;s your hair will still leave too much yellow toning behind. I bleached some extensions back out to the prior 613 color they came in and the bleach left behind a yellow tone that wasn&#x27;t there before and turned my blue dye to a blue-green color because of the yellow. I used a blue powder bleach on most of the hair and my blue colored hair dye came out perfect. So, i think this bleach is depositing yellow into the hair. Not a good choice for achieving a non brassy effect. Quick blue or Igora Blue is what i should have used again but i tried to save some money. Most of my hair was bleached by Igora Blue. Before using BW2 my hair never had a yellow tint in it.</li>
    <li> Worked well and didn&#x27;t have any issues. Came on time and worked as intended.</li>
    <li> This brand is a smoother powder than some of the other ones I have used ..</li>
    <li> Cheap price for a good amount of bleach. It also comes with a scoop.</li>
    <li> CAME ON TIME . EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED FOR MY MONEY.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed. Good whitening power, doesn&#x27;t leave your hair damaged! I did one bleaching in the morning (my hair is blue black), let my hair rest and did another in the evening. I know thats not the proper way to go about this but it did perfect and the damage to my hair was minimum if any. Would def. buy again.</li>
    <li> First, package arrived with the lid taped on and a bread tie surrounding the plastic bag inside. It seemed very unprofessional and like it had been used before. It comes with a little scoop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this lightner with Loreal 30 volume developer and left it on my hair for an hour (I have straight, very black asian hair, thick). I wrapped in foil too. The product lightened my hair but left behind orangey brasiness which is to be expected when going from black to blond. After using Wella T18 color charm toner, the color was to my liking. Damage was minimal, nothing that can&#x27;t be corrected with a deep conditioning mask. Overall, pleased with results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: Despite being dedusted, the smell is still VERY strong and you must open a window or have some ventilation. I found that my hair still smelled bleachy after shampooing.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and bargain. I am never disappointed with my amazon purchases.</li>
    <li> Worked nicely. I&#x27;m currently trying to remove the world&#x27;s darkest most evil semipermenant red dye crimson obsession by splat so I&#x27;ve used this bleach with a 20vol in a bleach bath. It took me from deep dark purple-y red to a very bright shade of red in one application. Of course I&#x27;m not done yet but for the first round it did great especially since it was diluted with shampoo. Even after doing this color still bleeds out so that should tell you how potent it is. Also other than a little dryness, which I think was from the clarifying shampoo, my hair was fine after a deep condition and moisturizer. Oh I have African American hair I guess it&#x27;s on the thick hair strand, wavy curl pattern side (?) that was previously bleached.</li>
    <li> I have been using different powder bleaches for over 20 years and this is the best one made!  Lifts the color perfectly, blends and makes a creamy mixture - no lumps.  And no dust.  Plus such a huge tub for a great price last awhile - great price, fast shipping!</li>
    <li> bw2 may be on the cheaper side of hair bleach products out there, but honestly I&#x27;ve tried the expensive stuff and I don&#x27;t see any difference.  The big tub is the best value for those who bleach often- it lasts me more than a year.</li>
    <li> best bleach i&#x27;ve ever used. my hair is naturally calico, and very picky. this bleach does its job, and does it very well. the closest ive ever been to platinum in one application (without totally frying my hair), and without using any toner. i do other people&#x27;s hair as well, and this is my preferred bleach, also highly recommended to clients, customers, and friends!</li>
    <li> this is by far the best bleach I&#x27;ve found for my hair &amp; when you&#x27;ve got a lot of hair, its nice having the extra powder instead of guessing with the packets.</li>
    <li> I like this product. I am not a professional and I didn&#x27;t want to take a big chance so I used a 20 volume with it to test the waters.  It took  a bit longer but it looks great.  I also bought shampoo that accents the blonde from pureology and I think it may have also helped.  I definitely recommend to take your time if you are using a cap so they amount of hair is evenly taken that also makes a big difference on the look.  If you are really scarred try on strand of hair under first check the time etc then go for the rest.&lt;br /&gt;Good luck.  Have fun.  BE A LOT MORE CAREFUL if you hair is longer than shoulder length.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s actually pretty good. The price is okay and the container is a medium size. I used a 30 cream developer and it turned out fine. I&#x27;m gonna have to do a second and possibly a third bleaching although.</li>
    <li> I did a do it yourself ombre, I used Clairol BW2 powder and the Clairol soy4plex 40 pure white developer. Came out amazing!</li>
    <li> This bleach definitely does what it needs to do. It lightens quickly without providing much damage. Although I believe it could lighten a little better, but overall a solid, good lightener that will defenitly lighten your hair. If going from darker to light you will defenitly notice a different. I currently have platinum blonde hair, and have for a while and always have to deal with dark roots. Sometimes it corrects my roots very well, but sometimes It does not. Overall, this bleach is worth buying and lasts for a long time.</li>
    <li> Bleaches well, doesn&#x27;t do good with black hair though. you can definitely tell a difference with one use . well worth the money</li>
    <li> Worked well for me with only 2 sessions and I have black hair.</li>
    <li> Best price and the product works as described. Lightens hair nicely.</li>
    <li> This brand good one too and it help make white on deer and elk skull so best to mixed this BW2 and Volume 30 together to make sure it become thicken and start using paint brush put all over elk and deer skull just paint all over it and wait for 3 hrs. Then repeat about 4 times so then wash off with cold water this make bright white color look real skull. Warning using latex gloves before using this stuff will burn hands but smell awful. I satifty with this stuffs. I recommend to outdoor hunter to use this things.</li>
    <li> 8 oz my butt didn&#x27;t even have very much in it couldn&#x27;t do but half my head</li>
    <li> This did the job &amp; bleach the hair well. 👍</li>
    <li> This is OK....Though I wish I would have gotten one that lifts to the max. level, far easier...but if only needed to use a couple of shades lighter than go for it. I have had better</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t exactly what I expected, you still have to buy the developer. my developer is awesome, and the combo of it and this is pretty good. I haven&#x27;t bought any other Tubs of Powder so I don&#x27;t have any way to compare the quality. I like it, It&#x27;s a lot for what you pay. It will last me a long time.</li>
    <li> Love it. Might want to purchase more than 1 at a time .</li>
    <li> VERY HAPPY WITH THE POWDER LIGHTNER...DELIVERY WAS ON THE TIME THEY STATED ...VERY HAPPY....USED IT AS SOON AS I GOT MY 40 VOLUME CREME DEVELOPER, I HAVE VERY DARK BROWN HAIR NEED THE 40 VOLUME TO GO WITH THIS SO IT GOT LIGHTER FASTER.. VERY HAPPY WITH PRICE AND DELIVERY AND THE PACKAGING</li>
    <li> In 2 bleaches with 30 vl. developer it lifted my dyed black hair very well. Was expecting my hair to be pretty dark still but its pretty light now. the only downfall of this product is its VERY flaky. Not sure why but after its on for awhile you&#x27;ll have a million white dots of bleach everywhere. Creates a real mess but other than that I really enjoy it. :)</li>
    <li> I have a ton of hair, it&#x27;s super thick and sucks up color quickly.  I did my whole head and had some left over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great deal</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t bad. My first order got messed up, but when I received it, I used it right away. I was a bit confused about the measurements, and how the mix had to be, as there weren&#x27;t really any good instructions, but once you figure it out, it&#x27;s all too easy. Might buy again.</li>
    <li> tub was smaller than expected:\ dont know if i will purchase again kinda small... good product just small tub...</li>
    <li> I always have a bucket of this stuff! Super quick and powerful.</li>
    <li> Instructions are not clear. It burns your hair to a straw.</li>
    <li> My natural hair color is a solid black, too dark for any of the box dyes in the stores to have an impact. So if I wanted to change the color of my hair, I was going to have to bleach it first. After much research, I settled on Clairol&#x27;s Bw2 Powder Lightener, and I&#x27;m glad I did! At first I was timid with it, only mixing it with a 20 developer and not leaving it on for too long because I was afraid of damaging my hair. But after a couple of attempts, I got bolder and went right for the 40 developer. My preference is to first put a few streaks in my hair to frame my face, and after 20 minutes wash it out and mix another batch of lightener and developer with an equal amount of conditioner and apply it to my roots, and pull it throug hthe rest of my hair. This process only needs to sit about 10 minutes to lighten my roots enough that I can then dye it a beautiful dark red and have the color show just the way I like it. The 8 oz tub is a great value too - mine lasted me nearly a year!</li>
    <li> Works great with foil or a frosting cap. Will lift easily over dark tint with 30 volume... just be sure to coat and  process the center of the strand first... roots and ends later otherwise you&#x27;ll not get an even result OR you&#x27;ll fry your ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this bleach in beauty school in the 1980s. Tried and true product.</li>
    <li> Well I&#x27;m starting to go gray in my dishwater blonde hair. So I decided to lighted up with some streaks and let it wind. This is the best stuff and it saves you money because you can use as much or as little as you need I been using this for many years when I was younger. This is always been&lt;br /&gt; the best white bleach made</li>
    <li> I use this with 40% peroxide to get my hair blonde to white.  It takes a few rounds, but has been the product I keep coming back to.&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Quick Blue\\&quot; has a lot of positive reviews, but it just doesn&#x27;t seem to lighten as quick as this does for me.</li>
    <li> Went from dark black to blonde with this! Loved it!</li>
    <li> Came damaged...quality seal broken and it appeared as though it was used on the onside as it was a bag of white powder not sealed and only thing holding the bag of powder together on the inside was a bag clip with white powder on the outside of the bag....definitely previously used and tried to sell to me in that condition.  Very poor.</li>
    <li> I use this bleach every few weeks and it is amazing.  It lifts quick and doesn&#x27;t break my skin out like some bleaches.  It is also enough to last FOREVER!</li>
    <li> Loved this.  Worked better than expected and left my hair very soft!</li>
    <li> I used this for the first time about a year ago to achieve an ombre effect and was really impressed. I paired it with Clairol 40 volume developer and it worked fantastically! I had used other brands before but this does the job wonderfully and have not been disappointed. It&#x27;s a great product and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Along with the clairol 40vol developer I was able to lift my dark Asian black hair into a  blonde in two bleachings. Other bleaches fry my hair but my hair was still quite manageable after this, This tub is nice and big, I was able to do my whole chest length hair with one tub. Good price too.</li>
    <li> I was not trying to make my hair platinum blond, just lighten it and this product worked great for that. I would say though this product is not entirely dust free and it bothered my eyes and my nose a lot so make sure the room has proper ventilation. I have used some products that bothered me less, but this one is strong and so good enough for me.</li>
    <li> worked well on my medium blonde hair to go platinum! Cheap and works well!</li>
    <li> I used this along with my 40 developer from Clairol. I needed to bleach some extensions I&#x27;d bought. It was my first time bleaching  ever; and it turned out perfectly. Just remember to wear gloves!</li>
    <li> Works great with L&#x27;Oreal Oreor Creme 40 Volume Developer...I am pleased with my results as this was my first time lifting my hair from black to blonde</li>
    <li> i love it. it works well</li>
    <li> The bleached bleached my hair well&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE this product</li>
    <li> Worked well with a 40 developer i had bought . . My hair is a lovely high honey blonde color thanks to this</li>
    <li> i really enjoyed this!!! it was enough for 3 peoples hair, one short, one medium guys length hair, and a womans length maybe 2 in below shoulders. :) bought 2, and willing to buy again. :)</li>
