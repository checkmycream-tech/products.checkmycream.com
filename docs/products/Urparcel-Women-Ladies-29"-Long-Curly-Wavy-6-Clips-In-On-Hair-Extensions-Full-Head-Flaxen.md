    <li> Way too dark I orderd the aubrn and got dark brown/light black very disappointed again and sheds and falls out and is really knotty</li>
    <li> I love the hair when I opened the package! It&#x27;s just so much and the deliver its fast! It just wasn&#x27;t my color but that doesn&#x27;t matter I can dye it just a little darker but I love them too long that&#x27;s just perfect!</li>
    <li> Not impressed. Didn&#x27;t meet expectations. Not real looking. Doesn&#x27;t blend well. Not the color it said. Just not a good product.</li>
    <li> resive the goods well and that I live in mexico</li>
    <li> These extensions were horrible. for the price, you can&#x27;t beat it but the quality was horrendous. They came fast, but I didn&#x27;t have the on for more than 2 minutes and they started getting tangled. I tried everything to untangle them but nothing worked. I threw them away that night. They were extremely heavy on my head, giving me a headache. Don&#x27;t buy these unless you need them for a costume and don&#x27;t mind untangling them every 2 minutes.</li>
    <li> I love that it&#x27;s long but I order a blonde and got a black one.</li>
    <li> I loved it but I can&#x27;t figure out how to put them on. Can someone help ?</li>
    <li> Color darker than expected.</li>
    <li> The Color was not what I expected.</li>
    <li> Looks thick on pic! Thin would need 2 to be that thick</li>
    <li> There are two items expected by the 11th And four expected today</li>
    <li> WRONG COLOR RED INSTEAD OF BLONDE</li>
    <li> this hair was completely the wrong color, very disapointed.</li>
    <li> my favorite hair product i order alot of thses and difrent colors too.</li>
    <li> Not bad it is nice but it needs more hair.</li>
    <li> Beautiful!! I am buying 2 more, it&#x27;s gorgeous matches to my hair perfectly. The flaxen is what I offered. Came exactly a week after I ordered. Prefect for redheads!! :)</li>
    <li> Its very pretty. It is very long. It matches my hair perfect. I ended up having to cut about 6 inches off it other wise I would of been sitting on it, and thats not fun sitting on it having it pull your own hair along with it.</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 as some reviews said that the extensions were thin and a set of 2 works wonderfully. I love the length. The color blends almost exactly to my hair color and with the right primping of my natural hair, you&#x27;d never even know they were extensions. I love the extra length and immediately ordered 3 more knowing that I&#x27;m going to wear them frequently they will soon need replacing. You can tell it isn&#x27;t human hair if you touch it, but not if you just look. But seriously, if you aren&#x27;t going to invest in remy hair, you get what you pay for. But for a total of $14 you can&#x27;t beat this set, even if it only lasts a couple wears. Very impressed for the price.</li>

    <li> Its Really nice! Butttttt it&#x27;s not the color I ordered!! U ordered flaxen which on the pic looks like very light brown/ almost strawberry... What I received was dark brown.. And now I don&#x27;t know what to do with it because my hair colors isn&#x27;t that!!! Suckssss</li>
    <li> This deserves 5 stars because 1. It got here waaay early which is amazing.  2. Price 3. Its beautiful I&#x27;m adding a picture. 4. It&#x27;s really the color in the picture I made the mistake of thinking it&#x27;d be darker but it blends well.</li>
    <li> The hair was unruly and hard to manage.</li>
    <li> God, it is beautifullllll. It is really long, so you might want to cut it to suit you.</li>
    <li> Has a lot more red then what I was expecting, and extremely long! I love it !</li>
    <li> Was completely the wrong color. ... can&#x27;t even use it.</li>
