      <li>nice lemon smell and fresh.  </li>
      <li>I have used other products but like this the best.</li>
      <li>It is so refreshing and clean smelling.  </li>
      <li>It is super, very light</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice after a shower or just to freshen up on a hot day.</li>
      <li>Not to strong and not to light.  </li>
      <li>I love this spray, its fresh and not perfume like.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light with one spray, like the Moroccan Argon Oil.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Jean Nate since the early &#x27;60&#x27;s and have always loved it.  </li>
      <li>It has a light scent that is not heavy and perfumey; rather, it is a very fresh, clean, bright scent with just a bit of bite that makes it refreshing or &amp;#34;zingy&amp;#34; (my wife says it feels &amp;#34;zingy!&amp;#34;)</li>
      <li>She absolutely loved the gift reminded her of being young again, brought back her best memories of her early days!</li>
      <li>The original scent has been modified from a light clean smelling after bath splash to something that can make your eyes water.  </li>
      <li>The original is still the original.  </li>
      <li>As usual, delivery and reliability have been excellent.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s been around for a long time and it still smells great.  </li>
      <li>I emptied this mising bottle and poured some of the original into it.  </li>
      <li>She used them years ago as a teenager, and she was delighted to find them again, easily available on Amazon, years later.</li>
      <li>Love to keep in refrigerator for a quick, cool spritz before heading out the door during our hot summers.</li>
      <li>I always feel so fresh and clean when waring this scent.</li>
      <li>Delivery was quick and prompt.</li>
      <li>I purchased both this and a giant bottle of the original -- you know, the kind mom and grandma used to keep in their bathroom?  </li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s the same scent that I love!</li>
      <li>that like that fresh smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Jean Nate is now stronger, not the light lemony fragrance of older days.  </li>
      <li>Product arrived promptly and was exactly as advertised.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice break from other fragrances.</li>
      <li>She has not had any issues with an &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; smell that a few other posters mentioned, so if indeed some problem was occurring it seems that it has been addressed, and the splash smells wonderful to me when she emerges from the shower.</li>
      <li>I very highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always enjoyed its subtle fragrance and how it is refreshing right after a bath or shower, especially during the hot weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I really wanted to like this product.</li>
      <li>THANKS</li>
      <li>and since it was a gift, they were very thankful for introducing this product to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I really, really, really miss it.</li>
      <li>I had been using this product and very convenient to use.</li>
      <li>Bring back the original.</li>
      <li>This is such a clean scent and people admire it when you wear it.</li>
      <li>The old citrusy scent of old is covered with a cheap floral scent, and doesn&#x27;t remain on the skin more than a few minutes.</li>
      <li>For her it brings back memories of riding in a convertible to the beach with her pack of &amp;#34;besties,&amp;#34; flip-flops on, and coming home with her hair full of ocean air and sand.</li>
      <li>Would rather have this than all the high priced After</li>
      <li>This new stuff has a musty scent.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if this was leftover or a new formula.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It did seem though that the fragrance was a little different from the one I had for many years.</li>
      <li>This is such a classic!</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t smell anything like the old Jean Nate.  </li>
      <li>But save yourself the trouble, get the vat and a cheap spray bottle.</li>
      <li>but it gets old with the splashing this on routine.  </li>
      <li>This is so refreshing after a shower and the only product I have used for the past 25+ years.</li>
      <li>It is not only different, it&#x27;s positively revolting.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My sister &amp; I both were very happy to find the product again and enjoy the clean and beautiful smells. Thank You</li>
    <li> used this for years...love it!</li>
    <li> This is no where to be found in the usual stores. It&#x27;s a nice break from other fragrances. Love the spray feature.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product on Thursday and Just received it to day 6/20/12. I love that is the origninal scent and I love that price. I bought this for my mother as a late Mother&#x27;s Day present. She smelled it and loved that Sam&#x27;s will send the original scent. I love that it smells so great and my mom is in love.</li>
    <li> This is such a classic! Been using this for years - never get tired of it - Refreshing scent - summer and winter.</li>
    <li> I have been using this scent since the late 1960s. I have always received compliments on this scent when I am wearing it.</li>
    <li> It reminds me of summer!  It is so refreshing and clean smelling.  It&#x27;s nice after a shower or just to freshen up on a hot day. My only complaint is the fragrance doesn&#x27;t last very long.  I looked into buying the cologne and it&#x27;s so expensive I can&#x27;t afford it so I&#x27;ll stick with the splash.</li>
    <li> Product arrived promptly and was exactly as advertised.</li>
    <li> Stronger smell than I remembered</li>
    <li> It has a different odor than I remember, smells old or musky. Not pleased at all. I think they change the formula.</li>
    <li> I love this spray, its fresh and not perfume like. The price is great and you can&#x27;t beat the quality</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this product. The Jean Nate powder has a delightful scent - but this product was nothing like the powder. This scent was more of mold and rancid. This is the first negative review I&#x27;ve ever left &amp; I&#x27;m sorry to have to do so, but this product smells just horrible.</li>
    <li> I purchased both this and a giant bottle of the original -- you know, the kind mom and grandma used to keep in their bathroom?  I received them the same day and I can tell you that this formulation is not the same. Immediately upon application and after drying down, this just smelled like Jean Nate that&#x27;s been cut with Pine Sol.  The original is still the original.  I emptied this mising bottle and poured some of the original into it.  Much better. But save yourself the trouble, get the vat and a cheap spray bottle.</li>
    <li> I have been using Jean Nate for the past 25+ years. This is so refreshing after a shower and the only product I have used for the past 25+ years.</li>
    <li> I used jean nate for years and then forgot about it so I was very happy to  find it again. It is super, very light and I thank Amazon for carrying it.</li>
    <li> Just just what I needed. Thank you</li>
    <li> Hasn&#x27;t arrived yet but I cannot wait!  I loved this as a girl and will go perfectly with my Philosophy Lemon Custard Bath Soap and Cream!  Just screams &amp;#34;Summer&amp;#34;!</li>
    <li> Great old school scent!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used Jean Nate for years, brought back memories!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to find this any where in my town. No one carries it anymore. I was way more than happy to find it. It arrived in perfect condition and I am a happy camper! Thank you for the prompt service.</li>
    <li> is perfect for traveling purpose</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. Lovely scent</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Jean Nate since the early &#x27;60&#x27;s and have always loved it.  However, it seems to be a different formula now and the fragrance is not the same.  Actually, it is making me sick to my stomach!  Wish they hadn&#x27;t changed it.  One more product I will no longer buy.</li>
    <li> I love Jean Nate. I just wish that they would make he cologne again. I really, really, really miss it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good scent that will hopefully be around for many years to come. It&#x27;s a good faithful product. Always a delight.</li>
    <li> Wonderful.  Hard to find.</li>
    <li> My wife loves the Jean Nate after-bath body splash and powder. She used them years ago as a teenager, and she was delighted to find them again, easily available on Amazon, years later. For her it brings back memories of riding in a convertible to the beach with her pack of &amp;#34;besties,&amp;#34; flip-flops on, and coming home with her hair full of ocean air and sand. She has not had any issues with an &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; smell that a few other posters mentioned, so if indeed some problem was occurring it seems that it has been addressed, and the splash smells wonderful to me when she emerges from the shower. It has a light scent that is not heavy and perfumey; rather, it is a very fresh, clean, bright scent with just a bit of bite that makes it refreshing or &amp;#34;zingy&amp;#34; (my wife says it feels &amp;#34;zingy!&amp;#34;) As usual, delivery and reliability have been excellent.</li>
    <li> It did not have a box . i wanted to give it as a gift. MARY MILLER why did it not have a box.?</li>
    <li> It smell wonderful, but the sprayer leaks</li>
    <li> I had been using this product and very convenient to use. It satisfies my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;I will order it again sometime soon and since it was a gift, they were very thankful for introducing this product to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Priscila A. Untalasco</li>
    <li> Yuck!  Didn&#x27;t smell any thing like it used to.  Threw it away.</li>
    <li> Not at all as I remembered. The old citrusy scent of old is covered with a cheap floral scent, and doesn&#x27;t remain on the skin more than a few minutes.</li>
    <li> This body splash is great.  Light spring like scent, very happy that I looked on Amazon for it..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this fragrance since the sixties.  I love it.  Always reminds me of my college dorm.</li>
    <li> I very highly recommend this product. It is very refreshing to smell. Not perfuming smell. nice lemon smell and fresh.  Love this product and recommend it to people that like that fresh smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t need to use this just after a bath, can use it anytime!</li>
    <li> This is a great body splash.  It&#x27;s been around for a long time and it still smells great.  I love the way it smells on my mom!</li>
    <li> This was not the Jean Nate that I remembered.  It smelled stale and was way too strong. I don&#x27;t know if this was leftover or a new formula.  I won&#x27;t be able to wear this.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t smell anything like the old Jean Nate.  Disappointing.</li>
    <li> DIdn&#x27;t like the smell. A bit too thick for my liking</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT  MY WIFE HAS BEEN USING IT FOR OVER 30 YEARS BUT UNABLE TO FIND IT LOCALLY ANY MORE. THANKS</li>
    <li> I was so glad to find this product.  Brings back wonderful memories. I always feel so fresh and clean when waring this scent.</li>
    <li> Present for my mom...she&#x27;s used this product since I was a kid!</li>
    <li> The original scent has been modified from a light clean smelling after bath splash to something that can make your eyes water.  Bring back the original.</li>
    <li> One of my favorites from years ago and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed, it&#x27;s the same scent that I love! Love to keep in refrigerator for a quick, cool spritz before heading out the door during our hot summers. Delivery was quick and prompt.</li>
    <li> I like it.  It is a refreshing smell.  Not to strong and not to light.  I have used other products but like this the best.</li>
    <li> Not a flower smell person.  At least, not on my body only on the flowers  Glad I was able to find it</li>
    <li> Happywith my item and will order again with Amazon</li>
    <li> Beat ever.  Would rather have this than all the high priced After Bath spray on.  This is such a clean scent and people admire it when you wear it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for over 25 years. I&#x27;ve always enjoyed its subtle fragrance and how it is refreshing right after a bath or shower, especially during the hot weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did seem though that the fragrance was a little different from the one I had for many years.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews that said they had changed the fragrance, despite the bottle stating that this is the &amp;#34;original.&amp;#34;  I thought maybe someone&#x27;s sense of smell had changed over the years.  I still have a bottle that I bought about 25 years ago, and it has that wonderful citrusy scent.  This new stuff has a musty scent. It is not only different, it&#x27;s positively revolting.  This is going down the sink.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife for christmas she has not used it all as it does not smell good at all and she is dissatisfied... may I return this item please</li>
    <li> PLEASE DO NOT ORDER THIS JEAN NATE AS IT (DOES NOT) HAVE THE SCENT OF THE &amp;#34;ORIGINAL&amp;#34; NATE I HAVE USED FOR 40 YRS!  REVLON MUST HAVE CHANGED THEIR MIXTURE FOR THIS SCENT, BECAUSE EVEN AT OUR LOCAL CVS, THIS DOES NOT SMELL LIKE THE ORIGINAL.&lt;br /&gt;THANK-YOU!</li>
    <li> Body splash takes on the smell of the plastic bottle.  I used to buy it in a glass bottle years ago.  It should not be stored in plastic.</li>
    <li> Jean Nate is now stronger, not the light lemony fragrance of older days.  I do still like it, just not nearly as much. Tried adding some rubbing alcohol....maybe that will lessen the stronger fragrance.</li>
    <li> My signature fragrance at a great price</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t as fresh as I have had in the past. Smelled a little old.</li>
    <li> This product was given to me as a gift some time ago and I love it!  I&#x27;m handicapped to unable to check out stores like I used to so I was so pleased when I saw it available on line.</li>
    <li> She absolutely loved the gift reminded her of being young again, brought back her best memories of her early days!</li>
    <li> Reminds me of mom, but the scent is coming back. It&#x27;s light with one spray, like the Moroccan Argon Oil. (I&#x27;m 36 yo.)</li>
    <li> wonderful mist after shower or whenever,</li>
    <li> My wife used to have this product.  She ordered it and fell in love with it even more.  Even smells good.</li>
    <li> I love Jean Nate but it gets old with the splashing this on routine.  I bought this spray bottle to use to spray on because it was priced at a good price.  Now I can just refill from the larger bottle which makes this easier to apply!</li>
    <li> Terrible bottle.came half full. It spilled all over packaging.</li>
    <li> Have been looking all over for this as it seemed to be gone from the marketplace - was glad to find it again and at a great price</li>
</ol>
