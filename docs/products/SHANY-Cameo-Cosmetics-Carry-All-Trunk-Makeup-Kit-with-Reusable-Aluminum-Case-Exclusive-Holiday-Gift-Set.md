<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Good for someone with no makeup experience, but it was not worth the price at all. This item look way bigger than it really is.  I would not buy this product unless it&#x27;s for a teen who is a beginner</li>
    <li> The items are okay but I though it had more in the case and was disappointed with how few items were in the case.</li>
    <li> Waste of money.  Horrible quality.  Dry and child-like make-up.</li>
    <li> Excellent shop and head</li>
    <li> Good for girls just starting out.</li>
    <li> The item came very quickly. It&#x27;s a very nice product. I&#x27;m can&#x27;t keep it away from my daughter. We both love it.</li>
    <li> When I ordered this make up set I did so thinking how nice it looks. So I ordered it and when it came it was in a small silver suitcase looking box. I know that everything in that carry all trunk  was not in my \\&quot;box\\&quot;.. I was very disappointed in this purchase.</li>
    <li> the quality of the make up is v.good but the box is so weak and easy to be broken. the design of arranging the items inside the box is so bad it is for show only but not for use, it isn&#x27;t easy to use also mascara isn&#x27;t included. no foundation for the blond people it is  dark for the brown people only[[ASIN:B002XXAUE8 Shany Carry All Trunk Professional 48 pc.  Makeup Kit, Gift Set,]]</li>
    <li> mom loved it for christamass and from what she said it was a good buy for the price</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a gift for mom. It is packed with tons of products eye shadow nail polish lip gloss. You name it its got it. Great deal for price too. Very happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> It is good in this price. I got on right time, but I got silver color instead of gold as picture shows. I like this product. I recommend to people this product.</li>
    <li> Love the see thru case, is so nice you can see what you are looking for. Colors are trendy, I like it a lot.</li>
    <li> I ordered this, it&#x27;s on the way, but, I&#x27;d like to add that I read the one star reviews where people says it&#x27;s decieving, and that the makeup is set around a hollow box, if you look at the pics, you can clearly see that the make up they have laid out around the case is clearly not enough to fill it. If the makeup filled the carrier/storage box,  it would cost way more. I think its basically just to start you off if your new to the makeup. I bought this for my teen daughters. They have other makeup, so this would be perfect for them, they are 11, 13 &amp; 14. This is not for a professional, or dating women, who know how to really &amp;#34;beat their face.&amp;#34; The product isn&#x27;t misleading, it shows what&#x27;s in the kit, ya just hv to know what your looking at.</li>
    <li> I received some break makeup, and they are all around the gift box middle of the box have an empty silver box, is not full as the picture, a part of this is Cameo Brand, not really good and in the .   I don&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> Website described the case as 16 x 10 x 14 inches, but the case I received is 9.5 x 6.5 x 6.25 inches; invoice shows correct model number and tag on case shows 48 pieces of makup.  So either the website is wrong or they sent me the wrong case with the right tags.  Didn&#x27;t open the case so can&#x27;t comment on contents.  Very disappointed and don&#x27;t have time nor the patience to listen to company&#x27;s excuses for the mistake.  If the case is important to you, as it was for me, recommend you don&#x27;t order unless you can verify size.  One last thing, thought I was going to get a gold case, but it was silver.</li>
    <li> Lots of makeup to choose from in this kit. Something for every skin tone.</li>
    <li> Its a great Gift for someone.  And really fast delivery..</li>
    <li> I am going to use this for a fashion show I am going to compete it and it has everything in it. I give it 2 thumbs up.</li>
    <li> Product was delivered in a timely manner. I would not recommend this product to anyone. The carrying case is made of a really cheap plastic and arrived with the handle broken. This was a christmas present so no time to return and receive a replacement. I tried to contact seller with no success. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT OR BUYING FROM THIS SELLER.</li>
    <li> MAKEUP&#x3D; 5 stars, CASE&#x3D; -1 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very good quality makeup for my little &#x27;tween-ager&#x27;. Lots of colors &amp; types for her to experiment with. She is quite pleased!  :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER....I have a big negative rating for the plastic-sided box/case itself. It&#x27;s held together by metal rivets that go through the clear plastic sides, but that plastic is far too thin and weak and as a result it has broken/cracked at nearly every rivet location. Because of this, the box itself started falling apart pretty much immediately.</li>
    <li> I lost it. I can´t enjoy</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift for my 15-year old sister and she absolutely loved it. Had I been the same age as hers, or eve jsut 2 years older, I would&#x27;ve bought another one for myself. The kit is so jam-packed with makeup and nail polishes! It&#x27;s very worth every penny.</li>
    <li> it is good make up but its not completly filled there is a box in the middle holding it to the sides</li>
    <li> I do not like this the make up is cheap and I will not buy it again</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really good I like everything</li>
    <li> when my stuff was arrived some of eyeshadown and brush were damaged .and the quality it is bad .I waste my money</li>
    <li> I bought this for my little girl.  The case is great, I thought there would be   a little more make-up, but I am happy  with what I got.</li>
    <li> This has been a great gift that I have given twice to younger gals who use a lot of makeup and like variety.</li>
    <li> They put a silver box in it that fills up the space of an over size carrying processional makeup kit, but I see no mention of it. and I see no reason for it other then to deceive you on what your buying.. I was...</li>
    <li> I would like to give this item a 3 1/2 star rating, but the quality of the item pushed me to opting for a 4 star rating.  Why no 5 star rating? Although there are a few dozen different colors/types of make-up, all are tiny sample-size or tester size pots and tubes of make-up (with three very small bottles of nail polish with scant pedicure/manicure items) with most items almost too small to use more than a time or two (although testers are always helpful when figuring our what color looks good/bad and so on).  The interior of the case held a very large silver cardboard box (which I filled with some \\&quot;real-sized\\&quot; make-up palettes and tools as this was meant to be a gift for a 17 year old girl).  The case is a rather small-sized train case without trays or dividers inside like some I have owned (although the description did not note there were dividers etc.).      I probably would not buy this again primarily based on price as I feel I could have purchased a similar case and added several nice nontester-size palettes of make-up and kits and the like (especially readily available during the holiday season) for a similar price, however this arrived in excellent time, was well-packaged (nothing broken/cracked etc) and ultimately saved me some time.</li>
    <li> The images make this product seem like a great value for your money, but it is not. The case is quite small and all the items are miniature sized. This product would be a good starter kit for little girls who like to play make-up. I was very disappointed with this item especially since it was ordered as a Christmas gift for my teenager. I was expecting medium-to-full size items inside the box. This item could have been worth $20-$25.</li>
    <li> Got this for daughter on her 18th birthday, and she loves it.</li>
    <li> This product is very nice for a beginner like me. I REALLY love it. The price was perfect as well.</li>
    <li> I read previous reviews about this item. I can say that they probably had their expectations way higher than the average, I guess, because when I received this, all the make-up was not dried up, it was excellent. It was better than I honestly expected it to be. I mean, it&#x27;s obviously sample sizes and it&#x27;s a bit of everything you need. It&#x27;s great for a gift of say, a young lady entering womanhood, or great for a lady who needs a little make-up for a confidence boost. I love all of it. The lipstick isn&#x27;t too sticky or chapsticky&#x27;ish, which is why I normally hate lipstick. This stuff is great for the person who doesn&#x27;t like lipstick. The lip gloss is great too, no complaints. Nail polish was beautiful after applied. Eye shimmer, again beautiful and no complaints. Eye shadows, again, no complaints. Honestly, I do not have one bad thing to say about any of it. I recommend this product!! I will probably end up purchasing 1 or 2 more.</li>
    <li> The makeup is VERY tiny and there is not a lot of pieces like the image makes it look. About 10 mini little pieces. Really liked the little carrier though.</li>
    <li> It was ok. Honestly, I did not like it. It doesn&#x27;t bring a lot of products. I can buy the same amount of products, same type at another place for a cheaper price. I was truly disappointed. In the middle of the case there was an empty box occupying all the space. Good side, the box its pretty cute and a decent size. I like it. But, I do not like the products. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for a friend as a Christmas present. I had been waiting anxiously for the package to arrive because I had read reviews about poor packaging and the case being broken...well sure enough it was. The back panel had been broken in the corner. I am very disappointed that the company would still send the product in poor packaging since I am obviously not the first to give a bad review on packaging. I won&#x27;t be buying from them again in the future due to the fact that they don&#x27;t take their customers thoughts or feelings seriously.</li>
    <li> nice I like it good product</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my tween at Christmas. The make-up sits around the outside of the trunk, with a silver box placeholder in the middle. It is a decent amount of product with a nice presentation. But, the packaging was deceiving to my daughter. I expected a hollow core.</li>
    <li> Really dont buy it was not look like what in the picture . Its just a box surrounded buy make up and nothing inside it just a carton</li>
    <li> Overall is great, wish that the box was made out of a stronger material.</li>
    <li> I was very upset when receiving this in the mail yesterday. The box and makeup is all very cheap and not good quality at all. There is not a single item of makeup I would use in here.&lt;br /&gt;Partly my fault for not reading the reviews first. Every negative review is spot on!&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM ..... EVER!!!!</li>
    <li> The actual make-up was fine...mostly...but the carrying case was inferior and arrived broken apart. This was a Christmas present and could not be given as the case was completely broken in pieces and one or two pieces of make-up were also broken. Though I contacted the seller about this almost two months ago, they never replied...very poor service. Overall, poor packaging for shipment and even worse customer service.</li>
    <li> It was a Christmas gift for my daughter she loves it. She cant wait to use her makeup. Thank you</li>
    <li> The item was not securely constructed allowing it to come apart at the corners. All items included very small and the illustration gave the appearance of being much more than it was in reality.</li>
    <li> I just love this shany carry all truck filled with shany beauty products. For less then 40 buck. That right less!! Hard to believe all these fabulous products in this one  trunk. This is a great buy and will give you hours of beauty combinations&#x27;  my daughter got this for her birthday and we love it . I have it on my wish list to buy for me cause I love using hers so much .if you love great beauty products at a affordable price this is for you. Its totally worth the buy. Go ahead get yours  today and start mixing up all the beauty opportunities with your shany trunk.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my wife, but wish I had thought one more time to click. It looks so cheap and thin wall. Things inside box are also look very cheap. Just try to stay away from this part.</li>
    <li> Gift to my Granddaughter&#x27;s 13 Birthday. She loves it!</li>
    <li> This makeup kit is nice. Lots of color choices. Just fyi all the makeup that you see around the box is the makeup there is. It is hollow in the middle so don&#x27;t like it&#x27;s just crammed full of stuff.. But the stuff it has is very nice good quality makeup, brushes etc. Also has containers to hold individual makeup pots. Plenty of room for your base and foundations etc in the box.</li>
    <li> Its great I really like the case for all my make-up</li>
    <li> My daughter loves her kit. She was so happy with her gift. The only thing I had problem with is I thought it had compartments to keep makeup organized. Otherwise we were more than satisfied.</li>
    <li> Real nice collection. I bought it for my girlfriend and she was very delighted.</li>
    <li> The dimensions on this item was 16x10x14. The actual dimensions was 9 1/2 x 6 1/2 x 5 1/2. I bought this for my wife because the dimensions it showed for the product was large enough for her to put her nail kit items in. When it arrived, I was excited because it came 2 days early. When I open the box, the disappointment set in. I have ordered a lot of items from Amazon and this is the first time I have written a review. It&#x27;s sad that it&#x27;s over a very poor experience. Partly my faught for not reading the reviews in the first place. If I would have, I would have known it was about half the size it&#x27;s stated on-line. I will no longer order anything from Amazon without reading all of the reviews.</li>
    <li> I love love this.  I don&#x27;t like spending a lot on make up.  I find you get what you pay for.  With the exception of these.  The price is cheap but I love the quality.  The shimmer eye make up is my favorite.  I use the light shimmer to highlight my face for a dewy look.  I am very happy  and will be buying more products from shany.</li>
    <li> I sent this product as a gift! The recipient is over 40 yrs old and I thought this was a good present since it has so much makeup and stuff. When she opened it, the blush was broken and the items looked like the were \\&quot;Play makeup for little girls\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;I was so disappointed! I asked her to pack it up and UPS picked it up for a return! Very disappointed! They should have more pictures of the items!</li>
    <li> I think all of you were expecting too much. I am 14 and am in theatre so i bought this for a \\&quot;Stage Make-up\\&quot; Kit. I got the kit two days before the ETA and when i opened it it was exactly as described. The only down fall was that one of the blushes were broken, but what can you do? It was shipped so of course you can&#x27;t control that. So i give it FOUR STARS</li>
    <li> MAKE UP IS GREAT. NICE SIZE BOX BUT WAS BROKEN WHEN I RECEIVED IT. JUST GLUED IT BUT IM NOT THE ONLY REVIEW WITH THIS ISSUE. BOX IS NOT COMPLETELY FILLED WITH MAKEUP. STILL NICE THOUGH.</li>
    <li> I know absolutely nothing about makeup. I thought I was purchasing a comprehensive, all-in-one makeup kit. This kit was 75% empty. There was a large, mirrored box concealing the center (empty) portion. My wife was completely disappointed and I looked like a total idiot after putting this under the tree this year. On the plus side, it shipped quick.</li>
    <li> The variety and quality of items is high.&lt;br /&gt;The comfort of taking out and in from box is low.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for something inexpensive to gift someone, this would be a great gift. Who wouldn&#x27;t like a makeup kit for a present?</li>
    <li> This makeup kit has everything you could ever want. the makeup case is of a great quality. i use it for holding some of my other makeup items too. the actual cosmetics have also become a few of my go to&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> You get all theses items for this price and I absolutely love mine. I came on Amazon to look for a good deal makeup kit and came across this!</li>
    <li> This is a great starter/travel kit.  You can&#x27;t beat the price for all of the essentials! Love the clear case, too.</li>
    <li> The make up box has exactly what the description tells you. The middle is a silver box that you can take out and the rest of the make up after taken out of plastic cases is not organized. But it is a good deal.</li>
    <li> This was purchased as a gift for an older lady that had no makeup left to use.&lt;br /&gt;She was so happy to receive it!&lt;br /&gt;It contained a little bit of everything she could use.</li>
    <li> Item was not what I expected. Much smaller and poor quality, shiped fast, small enough for a 5 year old</li>
    <li> I received the goods on time as promised. However the case came broken at the top.I was a bit dissapolnted</li>
    <li> Great for my line of work. I work with a lot of models and this is good for application, touch up, and so much more. Almost to perfect and when I run out I can get more make up to fill the trunk with.</li>
    <li> I got two of these for Christmas gifts cause its a great price and shipping was fast. most of all its much more when in the kit then i thought! after getting it person.</li>
    <li> I got this for a gf&#x27;s birthday. She likes doing making up so we were both very excited to open this big box. However, there is an empty box in the middle so it comes with less stuff than we expected. It&#x27;s still a nice gift but not very classy, I suppose.</li>
    <li> Gave this trunk to my granddaughter for Christmas  upon opening discovered lid was cracked from one side to the other.  Notified amazon and returned next day. Received replacement a week later.  Would advise anyone ordering this to remove bubble wrap and inspect thoroughly  before giving as a gift.</li>
    <li> I love the make-up, the package was fine. I was disappointed it was made in China,  I picked this make-up because it is not tested on animals.  Maybe I should have read a little closer but I thought this was made in the USA.</li>
    <li> Pretty cool! The pictures make it look like there&#x27;s more than there actually is.</li>
    <li> With so many products from China containing Lead -- and other questionable ingredients -- you might want to think twice about putting this stuff on your face, lips and in your eyes.</li>
    <li> as course she choose it and i paid but from what i hear everything is of good quality and no complaints</li>
    <li> Some of the makeup is prettty good, others not so good. The box I used for about a year and a half until it broke.</li>
    <li> I thinking have more make up but lke I want find all in onli 1 site lol thanks so much</li>
    <li> complete set beautiful color</li>
    <li> i brought this for my Girlfriend for christmas she loves no faults with it from my point of vveiw came in a very orangized box. she really loved the varity of things she got.</li>
    <li> I guess it was ok! I liked all of the make up. If your only looking for a case with a little make-up and lots of storage get this. There is a ton of storage for make-up you already have and in my opinion it is overpriced. But my overall review of the product is 3stars</li>
    <li> well made product exactly as advertised. makeup kit has every product you can want. would use this seller again the case is study and compact easy the carry. great as gift or to use for yourself, the shipping was extremely fast A+ rating.</li>
    <li> This was false advertising , the case is not full of makeup it has a large empty box in it that takes up most of the space , SUPREMELY DISAPPOINTED AND WILL NOT BE PURCHASING OR RECOMMENDING AGAIN</li>
    <li> For the amount it cost-not worth it.</li>
    <li> It looked like more in the pictures. I got it as a gift and she loved it but to me it looked like so much more in pictures.</li>
    <li> Recommend a good product to buy</li>
    <li> I recIeved this product in a timely manner, however two of the three blushes were broken and no longer pressed powder. I am keeping this product and not sending it back because the blush that did not break and remained pressed powder is the one color that I did need. Every thing else was as described in this kit.</li>
    <li> i dont recommend it to any one. i have bought it the box was broken and everything was mixed and all colors look like 200 years old.</li>
    <li> Me and my daughter have enjoyed using this product.  It was a awesome Christmas gift.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for. My little girl was very happy with it.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery solid quality.</li>
    <li> This set is a must have for any makeup fanatic!! Quality is exceptional and there is such an array of products at your fingertips!!! Def a must buy!!!</li>
    <li> i love this makeup kit! the quality of these products are amazing for the price! this is a perfect gift for someone who loves makeup!</li>
    <li> All of the make up you need is in this box! It comes with a clear box, which is pretty handy to store all of your makeup in! You can create a smokey, natural, summer, spring and many more different looks! It comes in pretty handy! You have to check it out for yourself! :)</li>
    <li> My youngest sister just became interested in makeup. She&#x27;s still a preteen so I asked my mom if she would be okay with me buying my sister makeup. She agreed but that I had to tell my sister she couldn&#x27;t wear it around boys. Haha! After some online shopping I found this. It was absolutely perfect and was exactly what I needed to teach her with without being overwhelming. This set has a little bit of every thing. I told her this box had everything she needed for every day so now she calls it her \\&quot;Day Box\\&quot;. I definitely recommend this for younger people. If I were to buy a set for an older person I would recommend a larger set as this one doesn&#x27;t have a large variety.</li>
    <li> Update 8/10/12 : Gave this to my younger cousin and she absolutely loves it. Thinking I might pick up a few more as gifts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would be a great gift for any girl beginning to use makeup. There is a good selection of all the stuff you should start off with, also there are a lot of different colors so you can play with everything and see what colors you like and don&#x27;t like.</li>
    <li> So cute! Have would really love to get this for my little sister, i have eyeshadows from Shany so I know they are great!</li>
    <li> this is really the perfect gift to give! it comes with everything a girl needs to finish her look! the products are high quality and the price is very good</li>
    <li> This is a perfect kit for beginners and is very affordable. Comes with everything you need and a lot of extras. The cosmetics are great quality and you couldn&#x27;t ask for anything more for this price!</li>
    <li> Although the makeup comes in small amounts I really enjoyed this kit. The clors have nice pigmentation and you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> not worth the price at all . the image is very much misleading . there is nothing but an empty gray box in the middle with TINY &amp;#34;sample&amp;#34; pieces . for 40 something dollars . complete waste . it looks like a makeup kit for little kids . -_-</li>
    <li> The best makeup kit ever.</li>
    <li> These are awesome for people who want to try a variety of makeup products. They are a good size to test and is a real good buy.</li>
    <li> This gift set has it all! everything you need is included. My cousin received this for her birthday and loves it! I cant believe that all of this comes for the price of 1 item from competitors.</li>
    <li> Love the price for this train case and gift set that comes with it. Really good stuff. It comes with a little bit of everything and the train case alone should be worth more then the price listed. this is a great buy I high Recommend!</li>
    <li> The item was not worth the Price , made it to look it is full of items ,when there is only few items worth less than $15.00</li>
    <li> This is a great set for young girls. I bought this for my daughter&#x27;s eleventh birthday. She loves to play in make-up, but I wanted simplier colors for her to use. The colors in the set are not as wild as most other make-up kits.</li>
    <li> I was looking for the perfect makeup kit for my granddaughter and this was it.  She was very happy with it when we gave it to her for Christmas!</li>
    <li> this case comes with all kinds of items and i&#x27;ll tell you, she definitely looks good with it on. as soon as she received it, her face lit up with joy.</li>
    <li> Poorly constructed case. Make up is ok , but some makeup was damaged . Keep looking for a better makeup set .</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift for my younger sister since her interest in makeup has gone crazy. I wanted to get her something she can start off with, and she fell in love with it. You get a lot for $23.21! Its perfect for her since she doesn&#x27;t has much and can store everything in the case. She enjoyed every item epecially the eyeshadows, blushes, and lipstick. She enjoys experimenting with this makeup kit.</li>
    <li> I loooved the make up it is really good I&#x27;m using it everyday, And for suuure I&#x27;m gonna order more when I finish them</li>
    <li> I love this! I actually received it as a Christmas gift. The products are nice quality and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I ordered this kit for a Christmas gift. This is everything my young sister likes and uses. It&#x27;s a wonderful kit for ladies who don&#x27;t have the means to shop. I will wrap and ship to her next week. She will love it I know. What a wonderful way to give facial products as gifts for people who cannot afford to buy seperately. I am grateful to have found this as I do many of my gifts on Amazon. This kit has everything.</li>
    <li> I have to say, I am extremely disappointed with this. I got this for $20 during a lightning deal. When it arrived, despite being completely surrounded by bubble wrap, the case was cracked. This means that someone broke it while they were packaging it. This makes me angry that they would not replace it when they have a warehouse full of them right where they are. I then opened the case. The picture makes it look like it is packed full of all sorts of wonderful things. It isn&#x27;t. There are 5 pieces of plastic packaging holding a total of 16 colors of eyeshadow, all of which are very similar, 3 lipsticks with little pigment, 2 lip liners that are almost useless as they have no color, 2 eyeliners that share the same lack of pigment, 3 tiny bottles of nail polish, two wooden cuticle pushers that broke, 2 toe separators, 3 blushes lacking pigment, and one decent bronzer. That may sound like a lot, but when you consider the quality of it and how small everything is, it really is not worth the $20. I have learned from experience that Shany as a company is not the way to go. It is overpriced for the quality.</li>
    <li> Over all the product was as advertised. Sadly the lid was cracked upon removing the bubble wrap around the case.&lt;br /&gt;My daughter loved the make-up, and did not want to send back the product. I have had trouble getting with amazon&lt;br /&gt;to deal with the problem. I guess when your just one out of millions of customers, you don&#x27;t count.</li>
    <li> The case was cracked. It was a carry case which cannot be carried.  The Make up inside was ok though.</li>
    <li> there wasnt alot of colours....like what was  shown so i wont advice persons to buy it&lt;br /&gt;hated my product and wont refer</li>
    <li> The box was from a poor material as the make-up that came inside with it.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend to any one that likes make-up.</li>
    <li> thanks, i like this product thanks you so much i need it is very confortable and softly thanks you 4 all</li>
    <li> I was so excited when i got it at my door,when i opened it up i was so excited seeing that i love makeup&lt;br /&gt;when i took it out the box i went threww it and the makeup was fine.when i was taking it to put away i noticed that the case was broken and i was unable to use the handle.</li>
    <li> I bought this SHANY CARRY ALL TRUNK PROFESSIONAL MAKE UP KIT for my little sister who is 27,as a mother&#x27;s day and it was delivered to her in pa. thank you my sister loves her gift . it  has so much make up and nice colors for her to put on..</li>
    <li> This makeup kit is a great gift! I gave it to a friend of mine who is just getting into makeup and she loved it!</li>
    <li> The case is great, seems unbreakable but there is a very large box in middle and only the make-up is visible on the outside. I bought something at Wal-Mart for $10 less that was much nicer than this.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife for Christmas. She loves it and takes it with her on trips as its the only thing extra to carry along with her suit case.</li>
    <li> I was pleased with this except for a few things. First the \\&quot;manicure and pedicure set\\&quot; was just 3 very very small bottles of nail polish and a cuticul pusher. Also the bronzer is too dark for my skin tone so they should either take that out have and case that has different eye shadow color and lighter bronzer or the could take out the bronzer and put in an eye shadow primer so the colors will pop.</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed this product, especially for young girls just starting out with their collection. It really teaches them the basics and it has a little bit of everything to have fun with. The carrying case wasn&#x27;t the best but it was still good enough to give it 5 stars because I think the products and the price was worth having a bit of poor packaging.</li>
    <li> This is a great gift for a friend or relative who loves makeup; i bought it for my cousin and she loves it!! Its a collection of lots of different makeup which you can try out and mox the different shades and combinations together. Recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> Everything you could possibly need is all in one cute case. Love the case and whats inside. From head to toe beauty items again another great product thats easy to take along with you wherever you go. :-) :-) :-)</li>
    <li> I love this cosmetic set so much. It has everything I need. A lot of eye shadow colours. I really really love it. Thank you  shany for such a good product :)</li>
    <li> I will admit that at first I was a little disappointed with this set. The clear box had no compartments and the cosmetics are just displayed against a silver cardboard.  Then I realized this is an excellent beginners set.  I have a niece who&#x27;s Birthday is in mid-August who is 14 and very interested in real makeup.  So, I gave this to her for her birthday.  She is thrilled and has asked sister and female cousins for makeup tips.  This set is excellent to start a young lady out with quality makeup, instead of bargain bin junk.  Linda W.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my little sister and she absolutely loves it. She is in 6th grade so this set was perfect. I love how it came with a case that she can put everything in. I dont recomend this to anyone older then 15. The make up quality really isnt there. But its a great started kit.</li>
    <li> I thought the case was very big but when i did get it all the blushes where ruined so i have to throw it away. ithink the product was good just should have been protected better</li>
    <li> I was VERY disappointed. For starters- the Carry All Trunk was BROKEN INTO MANY PIECES-and in the middle of the pieces was an EMPTY silver box, and the few products that were enclosed were sample sizes. Also- there was no paperwork enclosed to send it back for a refund.</li>
    <li> diappointed as i could see more empty space than the items in the box.. we dont find eye liner inside:(</li>
    <li> The container is made of really cheap plastic that does not hold up well at all. The picture and description sounds like you get more contents that you really do, it would be better if they gave you more samples with a coupon and order sheet to get the real stuff when your done with the samples. The one good thing I like is that you get two real lip glosses rather than the cheesy little squares. Overall if it was not $50 I would give it to a teenager as a gift but it is definitely not worth the price</li>
    <li> Case came all cracked up and handle is falling in.  NOT sure who to speak with to get this replaced????</li>
    <li> I was reall excited for this gift for my mom and expected much more makeup as it shows in the picture but it is no where close to that! it doesn&#x27;t have enough make up I would my recommend it I was disappointed</li>
    <li> The wife loves this case,... a great buy at a great price, ...and she plans on taking it along on vacation ...  It is compact enough to store more, and it looks really more expensive and has a lot of charm to it ( her words, not mine ) hahaha  ;-) ...</li>
    <li> This is a great makeup kit for me on the go, I like to travel a bit and it’s nice to have a kit with almost everything I need in it. From lipstick to cover up to eye liner this kits got it all. Its got plenty of different colors so no matter what I put on I can match it to my outfit, the makeup doesn’t apply heavy or thick at all it goes on smooth. and the makeup seem to go a long way.</li>
    <li> Okay so here it goes if your person that is a beginner stage of collecting make up this is perfect are you. Do not buy if you are a person that is looking for quantity this ain&#x27;t it lol seriously waste of money A total fantasy they give you about maybe five pieces of bull crap ..good luck!!</li>
    <li> You took care of business as well as you could have thank you very much for your help</li>
    <li> This product came in a very flimsy box and was broken when i recieved it.  the makeup inside was okay but one of the eyeshadows was broken and the lip gloss was not usable. i don&#x27;t think that it was worth it for how much it costs.</li>
    <li> I found that this clear case is a must when your in a hurry to apply makeup! The cosmetics are great as well. A winner in my book!</li>
    <li> So much variety and choices in a smart case.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my wife. The number of items in this makeup kit was equal, or better than the more expensive kits. It was shipped promptly and my wife loved it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and seller</li>
    <li> This Makeup kit was a requested Christmas gift.  It is nice makeup and she was very pleased with it.  The only draw back is the size and quantity of the content.</li>
    <li> this is a gift set, it comes with individual little tester samples of things which is great for trying out new products and testing out stuff, its awesome as a gift present idea, and i got it for my friend amy and she loved it.</li>
    <li> you get so many items in this kit. everything from makeup to nail products. a great gift for beauty lovers or the beauty beginner.</li>
    <li> Loaded with cosmetics suitable for a young girl enclosed in a cute traincase!!  It was a gift for my oldest granddaughter and she really liked it!</li>
    <li> YES, My wish was that it had more, face &amp; blush colors, and a containers for travel. They will break easily. I will always go to amazon first.  I love to shop @ amazon..</li>
    <li> Even though read reviews I really wanted to get for my soon to be daughter in law for Christmas. I got it for the case not the makeup. It cracked from me just putting a lite little present on top or it was sent that way and I just didn&#x27;t notice. Needs better quality makeup and case for the price.</li>
    <li> It is amazing and just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Its like a dream to see that makeup kit, its has everything, great colors, all that I need to do a very nice makeup.!</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for someone so my review is based on her response :) She liked it and the contents seemed satisfactory, but beware there is a lot of free space in the case, hence the reason for the 4 stars. The person i gave it too actually liked the space to place all her other makeup accessories.</li>
    <li> muy buen producto de maquillaje,enviado rapidamente y  llego a tiempo a mi pais, muy agradecida, con variedad de colores. Recomendado</li>
    <li> Ordered two of these for my daughters and one came with a cracked carrier and had to be returned, I was unable to reorder. The one I kept for my 11 year old is very nice as a starter for experimenting with makeup at home.</li>
    <li> Talk about a bargain! This case literally has everything you will ever need to do your makeup. The quality of the items is amazing, and you get so much for such a good price. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> My daughters love makeup!! And this is such a great gift for them without it being too pricey. Thanks again Shany!!</li>
    <li> I am so blown away by just how great the product is!  It goes on so smoothly and stays put!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Ok who could not love this one?&lt;br /&gt;it was like a perfect makeup kit&lt;br /&gt;all in one box!&lt;br /&gt;perfect to go out with instead of always forgetting something at home just leave it in your makeup box</li>
    <li> New to Shany Cosmetics? This  kit is for you it is kind of like a bunch of  samples altogether.  It is very good if you haven&#x27;t brought anything from Shany before, and would like try out a variety of their products. My favorite is the lip gloss and the eye shadows.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter for christmas. I thought the container was hard plastic but it wasn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s a flimsy cheap plastic. The makeup inside was cheap too. A plastic bag would be nicer.</li>
    <li> this make up kit is verry cute. the case itself is quite nice&lt;br /&gt;everything case makeup came in good condition. would highly&lt;br /&gt;recommend this product for the young and older women. i have&lt;br /&gt;also added my perfumes to the kit i would give this kit a 5&lt;br /&gt;star for sure, excellent prompt delivery</li>
    <li> I love this company, they have great products an affordable prices, everyone wants to borrow my new makeup!! It makes a great gift:)</li>
    <li> everything in this package works great, all of the color are beautiful, the toe separators work really good it&#x27;s a great product</li>
    <li> I LOVE THE CASE AND ALL THE MAKE UP WHAT A GREAT GIFT IDEA. I THINK I WILL BE ORDERING MORE FOR THE HOLIDAY SEASON FOR ALL OF MY FAMILY AND FRIENDS.</li>
    <li> great really nice my gril loved it she was very happy thank you very much...... will buy more products for her</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT IS GREAT TO GIVE OR RECEIVE AS A GIFT...I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO FRIENDS AND FAMILY MEMBERS..SHANY COSMETICS IS GREAT COSMETICS LINE</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t apply or show up once applies to my face. It smells funny and made my skin itch. Thumbs down.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit for my color skin !</li>
    <li> This was a nice kit for beginners.but it was made in China and not safe to use</li>
    <li> My granddaughter wanted makeup for Christmas.  I ordered this and she loved it.  I was a little disappointed because there wasn&#x27;t more makeup in the case.</li>
    <li> Good product...&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it...</li>
    <li> Now I scored big time daddy points when this came in the mail. My youngest and middle daughters loved it. Came as described. Well packaged. Was late didn&#x27;t make it by Christmas but we still got it. So I&#x27;m satisfied cause my girls said it was worth the two day wait. Thanks</li>
    <li> La caja venia quebrada, en la parte superior seguro fue en el momento de transporte.&lt;br /&gt;Seguro la caja era muy grande y por eso dio espacio para que se moviera mucho y se quebrara.</li>
    <li> NO!  Just NO!  Horrible.  Not a lot of makeup and the make up in it is TINY!  The case is flimsy too.</li>
    <li> What a price for that many pieces, and a perfect makeup case, how does the seller do it! You will have so much, I had to give a lot away. You&#x27;ll be set for a year, it&#x27;s by far the best makeup deal available on the website.</li>
    <li> I got this makeup kit as a gift and I absolutely love it! Everything in it was just perfect! And this is also the perfect makeup box to put all my makeup in :)</li>
    <li> SHE WAS EXTREMELY PLEASED WITH THIS GIFT.  IT HAS MANY COMPONENTS THAT A BEAUTIFUL LADY NEEDS TO LOOK PRETTY.&lt;br /&gt;IN FACT, THIS ITEM HAD TO BE REPLACED DUE TO A SLIGHT DAMAGE.. THE REPLACEMENT PROCESS WAS QUICK AND EASY.</li>
    <li> so much stuff, its greatttttttt!</li>
    <li> Got this for my niece as a birthday gift. She absolutely loved it! Couldn&#x27;t of gotten her a better gift.</li>
    <li> great little box it makes my wife happy even thought the picture kind of misleading cause when you receive the box you pull everything out, you would probably say what the heck.</li>
    <li> buenas noches la compra todo fue muy rapido y sin ningun problama y en excelentes condiciones y llego a tiempo gracias</li>
    <li> when granddaughter opened this gift at Christmas, the glass was broken. Did not bother to return it. Otherwise, nice gift.</li>
    <li> The lipsticks, glosses, blushes, and eyeshadows are my favorite! Great color payoff, long lasting, and all around awesome! The lipsticks are so creamy :):)</li>
    <li> loving it....absolutely no problem,just what i wanted :)</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter and she loves it.</li>
    <li> I bought it for a friend for her birthday she loved it. Its cheap and has lots of selections. Plus its cheap so its good for your  pocket  too lol just acting cheap</li>
    <li> Nice case, but not a whole lot in it.  For what you pay, it&#x27;s a decent deal, but it&#x27;s a little surprising to open the box and find it empty except for the two inserts that hold the makeup against the front/top.  So don&#x27;t expect this to be full of makeup.  There&#x27;s enough makeup to justify the price though and the box will make for a nice storage bin.  But you can surely fit about 10x the amount of makeup in this box than what comes in it after you remove the cardboard spacers.</li>
    <li> Great lil case to stay organized plus room for more</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not exactly what i ecpected, but it will make a great christmas gift for my teen daughter.</li>
    <li> When I opened the package everything looked good but one of the blushes was damaged. The rest of the product was grate</li>
    <li> This holds alot and the testers are great. The only probleme for me is the clear walls and that is just a personal preference</li>
    <li> The best stuff on earth! I never thought I would love something do much!!! Great products with great prices! The best</li>
    <li> I am really excited about this product. The items may be tiny, but this would be a great starter kit for a young girl just getting into makeup, someone who doesn&#x27;t need a whole lot, but needs a bit of everything. I love this kit and would consider buying it for my kid sister.</li>
    <li> This is truly a great gift set! I bought a couple for my cousins for Christmas this year!!! They are perfect for beginner makeup wearers! Shany has been a good company to buy from!</li>
    <li> Look at this neat trunk of make up! I would love this and having it all in a trunk instead of piling it up everywhere in your bathroom or wherever your store your makeup is awesome and the price is right.</li>
    <li> Its a good product but in the photos and description it looks and seems like a whole bunch of makeup but it&#x27;s not. I waz disappointed at this..soo yeah 😔</li>
    <li> I would highly recommend this make up case as a great xmas present for any young girl. There is a wide range of colours and shades, with a great variety of lips, eyes and cheeks. All in a handy carry case. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy so I can&#x27;t really go on about whats in the box but I will tell that you that the top of the case came cracked;A real eye-saw.There&#x27;s really no point in gift wrapping it now,I&#x27;ll just give it to someone.</li>
    <li> out standing job thank you its awsome</li>
    <li> Just perfect for my wife</li>
    <li> Great make up kit for every woman to use in cooperating her  day to day colors in feeling good. Nice.</li>
