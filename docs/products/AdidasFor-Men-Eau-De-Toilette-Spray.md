<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Nice scent, but does not last very long. But hell, it&#x27;s 10$.. what do you expect for 10 bucks???</li>
    <li> My husband likes this one, and it seems to be on the lighter side. Somewhat sporty.</li>
    <li> Item is as it was described, thanks.</li>
    <li> Not strong enough. Very mild.</li>
    <li> Seller did great with getting product to me&lt;br /&gt;Smells great and good price</li>
    <li> Purchased for all of my 3 boys and my husband.  They all love the Adidas scents.  Can&#x27;t go wrong for the price either!</li>
    <li> great product !! arrived before scheduled date ..love it and will definitely order more.</li>
    <li> My brother loved it for xmas. it smells really good. very big bottle. came wrapped nicely. i still like adidas sport smells better but this is a very close second</li>
    <li> Actually awesome for the price.  Why pay like fiddy bucks for cologne?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very good that its not overpowering like Hugo Boss or Polo.  Smells kinda athletic but may be somewhat weak that you have to apply more than necessary.  For some people, it may smell too weak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a fan of Adidas so thought I try this and was not disappointed.  However, one of reason why I use cologne is to cover up the foul smell of my clothes because I don&#x27;t change them often since I&#x27;m too lazy to wash them and so I actually need something stronger.  But I will definitely use this when I do come around to doing my laundry.</li>
    <li> Excellent product , I recommend</li>
    <li> SMELLS GOOD LASTS LONG.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s extremely soft, so soft you can almost no smell it, but I guess you can&#x27;t expect much for that price</li>
    <li> When I purchased this product it was 1 week before Christmas and I was sure it was going be late, To my surprise it was there within days..  I bought it as a give for my husband. When he opened it, I was  pleasantly surprised with the aroma.  My husband and I loved it so much I had to purchase again</li>
    <li> great smell for very good price i love it</li>
    <li> Smells much better than I had anticipated. Got it for post gym freshness as all my sport sprays are but I have worn it as a casual cologne a few times well. I critique scents a lot and would have easily given this a 3 star because it may seem &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; but it receives a full 5 stars because it makes you smell like a man.</li>
    <li> Reasonable quality while affordable.</li>
    <li> I am definitely buying this again. Wonderful smell. I would love a bigger bottle.</li>
    <li> Good product, with reasonable price.</li>
    <li> It goes on strong but mellows soon after and stays at work all day long. I would recomend this as a great scent for work no problem.</li>
    <li> My young boys love the smell</li>
    <li> Nice stocking stuffer thanks</li>
    <li> Wanted a cheap clone to use here and there when I needed it, these were great when they were like $5, now at this price they don&#x27;t make no sense.</li>
    <li> Smell really fresh and nice... Love it!!</li>
    <li> Really like the scent. My son really likes it too. I bought this one and the Deep Energy and this is the one he liked the best. Smells like a guy, but not so strong it chokes you. I would definitely buy this one again.</li>
    <li> It smells really good!!</li>
    <li> Excellent experience! All according to the agreement. Impeccable compliance deadlines. Thank you very much!</li>
    <li> my son loves it I thin the smell is a bit strong</li>
    <li> I like it and for what I paid makes it better!</li>
    <li> Good name product at a reasonable price.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> For less than 10 bucks, this product smells great too! Recommended to all men out there!</li>
    <li> Great smell considering I bought this blindly. There is a hint of citrusy and tropical when you first spray it on. As time wears on, the smell turns more heavier and mature but not overbearing. I don&#x27;t think this has great sillage and last about 5 or so hours before maybe needing to respray. It may be because it is winter and my clothes are rubbing off on it, but it still is a great cologne for the price.</li>
    <li> I like the scent but it seems to have lost its potency. I can douse myself in this and hardly smell it.</li>
    <li> I bought this based on favorable reviews on a fragrance website.  Upon first sprays on skin it has a harsh synthetic grapefruit scent, then calms to a more tobacco scent.  This scent last quite a long time compared to other cheap scents I&#x27;ve purchased, but the silage is lacking.  I was looking for a typical summer fragrance, and this missed the mark with too much tobacco and woody notes.</li>
    <li> It is very cheap. Strongest doesn&#x27;t last long. I guess you get what u pay for.  Nautica is little more expensive but much better than this one.I won&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> Cap was broken so you cant spray it ...... it does smell nice thou</li>
    <li> I congratulate you for the excellent article.</li>
    <li> Excellent seller recommend 100%</li>
    <li> No scent that I can tell at all</li>
    <li> The Adidas Team Force was also very, very, good.  All adidas products i&#x27;ve always been happy with.  The scent isn&#x27;t too over powering, it&#x27;s made just right. I would definetly buy this product again.</li>
    <li> love it...smell good...</li>
    <li> This perfume has a simple fragrance in it. I don&#x27;t see how it could stand on its own but probably for the casual hang out or some social occasions, it could work fine.</li>
    <li> It is difficult to rate this item as I am still waiting over a month to receive it, so I don&#x27;t kow if I like it or not, but I had to do something to let the sender know that after paying over a month for this one simple item, I have still nto received it yet; this is unacceptible.</li>
    <li> The only perfume that I use. the scent&#x27;s not too thick.</li>
    <li> My son loves it. So im happy.</li>
    <li> Smells good! I got found a better price at Gordmans though... Wish I would have done a little better research, I wouldn&#x27;t have paid as much.</li>
    <li> Was not as good as other reviewers said, i doubt if the reviews were matched correctly for the product.</li>
    <li> Smells very good......</li>
    <li> Good product, good seller!!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my Husband, I really love the scent.</li>
    <li> Smells great but dissipates after a bit. Have to get real close to smell it but that part holds for days.</li>
    <li> Fragancia refrescante</li>
    <li> excelent product 100 % recomended</li>
    <li> Smell was ok. For nephew, he loved it.</li>
    <li> product was as described, it was delivered on time and no complaints about anything in the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love adidas, its a a time tested product and nothing has really ever gone wrong with it</li>
    <li> If you want to use  fragrance which don&#x27;t even make an impact for 5 mins,Please use this.. :) ..Unfortunately cannot return..Lesson learnt is never buy a fragrance without testing..</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very good cologne.  I like it a lot.</li>
    <li> I love the scent. It was reasonably priced and it was worth the price. I would buy this product again!</li>
    <li> Good for the price, came on time as I expected. Perfect smell.</li>
    <li> I got this perfume at a great price as it was an add on item. It smells awesome and I very happy to use it.</li>
    <li> Big bottle. Smells alright, Fresh clean scent. Doesnt last as long as I hoped for but its also not overpowering. For around $10, its a great everyday scent to use</li>
    <li> Smells nasty when you first put it on but the after smell is divine!</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product ( different fragrance ) a 2nd time now and use it almost everyday.&lt;br /&gt;No complaints whatsoever.</li>
    <li> I love scents that are citrus-y and this is great! The smell lasts all day too.&lt;br /&gt;If you are into scents that are fresh, this just might be the one you are looking for.</li>
    <li> Just received it it smells great its a gift for my husband I really think he&#x27;ll like it nice size also thanks</li>
    <li> Quick Delivery &amp; good Product , Good discount</li>
    <li> Fast ship. Nice smell</li>
    <li> I only use it to work out. The smell is ok and does not last long. The bottle is a nice size though. Would not buy it again.</li>
    <li> For under 10 bucks eau de parfum, it is alright.Just Ok. Not good but OK. Don&#x27;t expect too much from this if not you will be</li>
    <li> Great scent good price. Works for everyday use!</li>
    <li> this product really smell good for the price.  it is worth more than its cost</li>
    <li> Smells good it got here fast very good for the price as well great for everyday use and isint as small as I thought.</li>
    <li> Smells good. Lasts pretty long if you use it generously.</li>
    <li> Not what i expected for $8, really met my expectations :), I&#x27;d like to thank Amazon for carrying such a good smelling brand of cologne.</li>
    <li> It arrives as expected. I like it because it is cheap but quality. I will recommend it to my friends and family</li>
    <li> Great gift, arrived on time</li>
    <li> Nice for young men just learning about adult grooming...very pleasant.</li>
    <li> I bought this Adidas, and I thought it was a little bottle, but it&#x27;s a big one, and the scent is close to the Jaguar which I used to buy a lot of money, and it lasts for a while on you. I totally recommend it!</li>
    <li> It smells really good!!</li>
    <li> very good smell, can be used for a whole year</li>
    <li> I bought this for my fianc&amp;eacute;e. He likes the smell. It&#x27;s a nice fresh scent. Not to strong &amp; powerful to the point it overwhelms you but still a good scent where you want to pull your man closer to you. :)</li>
    <li> Lovely perfume.....it last for a while</li>
    <li> Good and Elegant Perfume for a very reasonable price (without shipping.)</li>
    <li> Not very impressed with a weak lemony smell . Box was opened and it seemed like it was used a little.Would not recommend even at that price.</li>
    <li> Ordered Adidas Team Force By Adidas For Men from Perfumeland Megastore&lt;br /&gt;I received cologne that was not shrink wrapped in plastic. I was planning to give this to someone as a gift but I don&#x27;t want to give it now for someone&lt;br /&gt;The item I received is different from the item on the pictures&lt;br /&gt;Smells like cheap cologne, or cologne for people over 60</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s smells good got grils al up o me is is perfect just for so cheap can&#x27;t miss this opportunity</li>
    <li> The smell goes away fast</li>
    <li> Nice and fresh. We are pleased with it</li>
    <li> smells good and priced great!</li>
    <li> 1) I ordered it, it arrived on time. The box was slightly bigger then the Adidas box it came in, yet they crammed the rest of the space with bubble rap. Nice to protect it, a pain to get the product out of the box!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) The bottle looks right in size as told. It smells good, not the best Adidas out there, but at least in the top 10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Not that it matters, but in the picture the cologne looks clear in color, when its more like a lite yellow&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) You will pay the same price or more for shipping over the cost of the cologne itself... kinda redundant</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t get this scent at all. I won&#x27;t be getting it ever again. Highly disappointing to be honest.</li>
    <li> A perfect gift for father&#x27;s day</li>
    <li> The fragrance is great, but takes a few minutes to lose its alcohol scent. Also, you need to reapply every 4 hours or so... So its a nice, well priced fragrance, but not the absolute best. Possibly the best for its price though.</li>
    <li> This scent was even better than I expected it to be, and the price was awesome! I also really like Chrome, but I think this may actually be just as good if not better and the scent stays on my boyfriend&#x27;s sweaters and coats for days. Great buy!</li>
    <li> my iten arrived at very good time.....it smells good...</li>
    <li> Excelent fragancy and quality product</li>
    <li> Got plenty cause the system gave me more than I wanted. Will keep tho&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much, big brother.&lt;br /&gt;JEBurley</li>
    <li> It stays on only for couple hours. Spend more money and buy EDP cologne rather than wasting money on this.</li>
    <li> Great smalling for any man that loves to small nice all the time</li>
    <li> I was nicely surprised. It smell fresh and clean, good item for a very cheap price.</li>
    <li> I like it, but its fragrance lasts too short.</li>
    <li> The smell is very woody and citrus.</li>
    <li> 5 stars. Great product!!!!!</li>
    <li> Inexpensive, fine daily cologne. COTY/ ADIDAS makes about ten of this item, in different &amp;#34;flavors.&amp;#34; I use most of them.&lt;br /&gt;All are LESS THAN $10/ bottle.</li>
    <li> You just can&#x27;t beat this Adidas&#x27; spray on for the money. I had just gone to the mall a few weeks ago and tested many other bigger name scents for a lot more money, and I like this just as well. The four stars is because of great value that you get here. Perfect for everyday use and not overbearing. I&#x27;m personally going to try another Adidas spray without having tried, we&#x27;ll see about that one, I&#x27;ll&lt;br /&gt;review it later.</li>
    <li> Solid sporty scent, lots of it, great value for money</li>
    <li> Great for going to exercise</li>
    <li> It smells really,smells hot but light too.&lt;br /&gt;Got here on time. Really nice packaging, I would love to buy again. Good job!</li>
    <li> Ok for the cheap price. It lasts well but I&#x27;m not a fan of this hard, spicy, citrus smell. I prefer I am king, or Paris Hilton.</li>
    <li> This cologne is da bomb! It is a real fresh manly scent! I have gotten so many compliments wearing it I have lost count! A great scent and a great deal all in one!</li>
    <li> Great Item. Is as described on site. Purchased for my husband who liked it. A little small though. Goes fast.</li>
    <li> It smells great for athelete. After a long day of playing basketball he smells awesome after putting this on. Smells great</li>
    <li> This is one of the best Adidas has produced. Smells great.</li>
    <li> Great price. Pretty good smell for the price. The smell does dissipate quicker than other colognes but that is the only downside.</li>
    <li> My son is now the BMOC w/the gals chasing him</li>
    <li> This is essentially Axe Body Spray or Old Spice (Denali) dressed up like a cologne. Axe is cheaper but this lasts longer, but not much longer.  Better for a younger man as a daytime fragrance.</li>
    <li> Not bad for the price but the smell is light and not super strong. Sporty smell and in expensive which makes it perfect for the locker at the gym after I shower.</li>
    <li> I alway like adidas products, this are a good one, I will buy more in my next shoop of colognes.</li>
    <li> I like the smell but doesn&#x27;t stay for more than two to three hours. Useful to wear after tough workout. For the price it is worth it but don&#x27;t expect to be like a designer perfume.</li>
    <li> Arrived very quickly! Extremely satisfied!!!!</li>
    <li> I really liked it! Very reliable seller.</li>
    <li> This has a nice sent the down side it dosen&#x27;t last, if it was to last the hole day this would be perfect.</li>
    <li> Received on time, very nice smells and very cheap. Is a cologne to be use for all days, more during day in weekends. Not like a perfume.</li>
    <li> Really does smell amazing.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s really not a whole lot to say other than this is a great scent for the price. I think I am more of a fan of the regular Adidas Moves, but this is great too. For less than $10 on Amazon, it is a great sporty cologne.</li>
    <li> This product is great.... I love it.</li>
    <li> I am satisfied good service</li>
    <li> Seems to have a strong scent of the alcohol in it.  Does smell good but if you have a sensitive sense of smell you will smell the alcohol before anything else.  This lasts only for a few minutes though.</li>
    <li> Nice smell and not too strong. Would recommend as daily use.</li>
    <li> Smells great, very affordable, and it&#x27;s strong. I dropped it millions of time, and it doesn&#x27;t even have a scuff.</li>
    <li> Great smell..quick delivery and good price..</li>
    <li> So awful wish i can put no stars i purchased this item 13 days ago and still isnt here</li>
    <li> Great product really good BUT horrible horrible packaging no foam or or something to protect the glass</li>
    <li> It Smells great and arrived quickly. It is Half the price then that I have seen in stores. I would definitely recommend this cologne to everyone.</li>
    <li> It smells nice. It&#x27;s not crazy strong, and the smell doesn&#x27;t last as long as a high end cologne would, but it&#x27;s something nice to just leave in the car.</li>
    <li> It was a great product!</li>
    <li> this product is awesome!</li>
    <li> smells great long lasting</li>
    <li> My husband commented that this is a &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; men&#x27;s fragrance; it is a pleasing scent...although he perfers stronger colognes, personally.</li>
    <li> The shipment arrived at my house in 2 days which is great. Also the shippment was greatly protected and neatly packaged. But for some reason the box came ripped up and torn apart. The bottle feels a little cheap but has a great grip onto it. The scent is outstanding!! But the projection is awful, hard to push down button and sprays only a small amount. Im rating this a 3 star because scent is great but every other factor isnt</li>
    <li> Always loved colognes and this one has cool scent. If you are looking for a scent that&#x27;s not too loud but smells refreshing then this one is.</li>
    <li> Has a sharp, cool, ordinary smell.</li>

    <li> Light good quality Eau De Toilette spray for men&lt;br /&gt;Perfect during day time&lt;br /&gt;Not strong to irritate some sensitive colleagues at work&lt;br /&gt;Reasonable price&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it for men working with others during day time</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t get a better cologne/perfume for cheaper than this !! This is your &#x27;any day&#x27; perfume. I might just order one of each such variants soon !</li>
    <li> this perfume is my second time buy it for my friend, he told me it is wonderful .</li>
    <li> Got a couple of these in different scents for gifts.everyone seems to like it.will recommend for gifting,not bad at all.</li>
    <li> Adidas is my favorite shoe brand and what could be better than having a Cologne of the same brand. The smell is amazing! Would buy this again.</li>
    <li> Its a very light fragance with a citric tones that make it smell very fresh. Match very well with sports men</li>
    <li> This item smells great. My husband really enjoy this cologne. I have recommended this to all my brothers and male friends.</li>
    <li> Gift for my nephew, he loved it.</li>
    <li> This scent really surprised me.  I brought it for my fiance and I cant keep my nose off of his neck.  I never thought that this could smell so wonderfully good.  Everytime he wears it men and women ask him what is that or comment somebody smells real good if we are in a crowd.  I&#x27;m more than pleased.</li>
    <li> Cheap fragrance, it is made in India and I can tell the smell is popular among Indian. I would go for Armani instead.</li>
    <li> OKAY, WHAT EXPECTED-I LIKE AND RECOMMEND</li>
    <li> Great quality, 100% recommended! I love it &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> product is very nice but delivery was a week longer than originally said</li>
    <li> It is a nice fragrance for every day use and definitively I will buy again, thank you for your excellent service</li>
    <li> I use this exclusively for my sporting events. It sticks with me well and is one of my favorite Adidas scents.</li>
    <li> I liked it but it does not last long at all. For the price, not to bad. I need something that will last.</li>
    <li> The smell is good but it dose not stay for a long time.But for the price its good. I ordered two one of them came broken.</li>
    <li> Aroma leaves after few pumps.  All of perfume oils must have settled to bottom. May require a good shade PRIOR TO USE!</li>
    <li> What can I say? I love the fresh clean scent. Fresh is a key word describing the scent of this product. Fresh - very clean. It is also cheap for a good smelling cologne. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> The scent is good, but it does not stay too long on my skin...</li>
    <li> One of the best fragrances i have ever tried...fell in love with this one when i was in school...The exotic hues of this fragrance is perfect for an evening of pleasantries and even lazy, warm afternoons....</li>
    <li> Great price and smell cant ask for more.</li>
    <li> Cool feel on the skin</li>
    <li> This is a more adolescent scent than I expected.</li>
    <li> Not too bad. I tend to think all the Adidas cologne of this style smell really similar. It isn&#x27;t a bad smell but its nothing special. For the price its not a bad buy....just don&#x27;t purchase more then one of this style.</li>
    <li> item was as per my expectation and loved it,,will repeate my order soon. and have turst on this items .</li>
    <li> I have always enjoyed Adidas Cologne for daily use. This has a strong yet subtle scent that everyone around me enjoys. I don&#x27;t like over bearing Colognes. I have a keen sense of smell and they drive my nostrils crazy. The price is a fraction of what i used to pay at stores. And it arrived supet quick. I recommend.</li>
    <li> Excellent, the product came in as expected.</li>
    <li> I recommend excellent product thanks</li>
    <li> I like a lot its smell, my girlfriend says that now i smell to man , haha</li>
