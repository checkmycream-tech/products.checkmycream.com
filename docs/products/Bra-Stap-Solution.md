      <li>lol</li>
      <li>Colors are great.</li>
      <li>A great value.</li>
      <li>I think they&#x27;re very handy, and kept the tan one for myself.</li>
      <li>she says its a really good bra strap concealer.    </li>
      <li>then you will feel good about wearing your bras.</li>
      <li>Good for the price.</li>
      <li>All in all, a good review.</li>
      <li>good deal, too.  </li>
      <li>but that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s great that this comes with so many.</li>
      <li>These took a while to ship (2 weeks about I think), but I am very pleased with them.</li>
      <li>I love these!</li>
      <li>It also comes with invisible tape which I haven&#x27;t used but is a nice bonus.</li>
      <li>The product is super easy to use, and it hides my straps perfectly!</li>
      <li>These really help with some nice lifting, make a slouchy bra provide more support, keeps the straps from falling off your shoulders - with a good bra, it can feel like you just lost 10 pounds off of your chest!</li>
      <li>/&gt;It feels great, is largely unnoticeable, and is very easy to put on either by yourself or with someone else&#x27;s help.</li>
      <li>I wear a size 16-18 top</li>
      <li>the \\&quot;perfect strap\\&quot; definitely does exactly what it&#x27;s advertised as... conceals straps and increases the (appearance) of your cup size... really nice lifting!  </li>
      <li>but most of my tops hide it and</li>
      <li>I cannot even explain how much I love this product.</li>
      <li>I also feel like I get more support when i wear them.</li>
      <li>[[ASIN:B001OR9PUO Strap Perfect Bra Clips Ultimate Bra Strap</li>
      <li>I am a 38 DD and it held me up just fine.</li>
      <li>This would probably have worked fine if the straps had been a lot closer</li>
      <li>Bless the inventor of this fine product.</li>
      <li>These little things work awesome for me!</li>
      <li>It was comfortable and helps tons with posture.</li>
      <li>Really comfortable.</li>
      <li>They send you some cheap flimsy knock off version and there are not 6, there are 3.</li>
      <li>I am using one right now on a camisole with a crappy built in bra &amp; these \\&quot;girls\\&quot; need their support &amp; they are getting them!</li>
      <li>They are really simple to use and surprisingly they aren&#x27;t flimsy.  </li>
      <li>I never even wore this one full day.  </li>
      <li>She liked the different colors and the strong design.</li>
      <li>My wife enjoyed the product highly...  </li>
      <li>They are perfect for racer back tops and the shape makes them easy to grab hold of and pull down into position.</li>
      <li>bought them just for fun...</li>
      <li>Harder than it looks to put on, but I suppose with more practice it&#x27;ll be OK.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
      <li>Good value and so much better than expensive brands available in the market.</li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s so worth it, if you are large, to have that added comfort and support.</li>
      <li>First, if you have small breast these are great, if you have large breast, forget about it...</li>
      <li>Hope it&#x27;ll not be uncomfotable as it first appeared to be on my practice.  </li>
      <li>These work exactly as they are intended to.  </li>
      <li>Not uncomfortable at all, either.</li>
      <li>and it was exactly what I has hoping for.</li>
      <li>Love the concept though and really hope it works for the racer back tanks I have</li>
      <li>when i do use this product i find it rests up pretty high, close to my neck and doesn&#x27;t work if you have a keyhole type top on because that is exactly where the strap holder ends up resting on my back.</li>
      <li>Another thing I like about this product is that you can easily slide up (tighter fit) or down by yourself as the clip glides thru your bra.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping and product was exactly as described.</li>
      <li>I am a large breasted women with 42DD</li>
      <li>The material and design are so much better than the first one (other brand)</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>they work very well.</li>
      <li>Very durable.</li>
      <li>I really did not want to go strapless.  </li>
      <li>and they work very well.</li>
      <li>that was much sturdier.  </li>
      <li>I love wearing tanktops so these are extremely helpful.  </li>
      <li>i took 1 star off beacuse of the high price</li>
      <li>Especially people that wrote a review without even trying the thing first!</li>
      <li>The multi-way bra from Victoria&#x27;s secret is a good one.</li>
      <li>Gave some to a friend who also can&#x27;t live without them.</li>
      <li>and I only use this when I want to wear something sexy in drag.</li>
      <li>I was looking for something to help me alter my bra to fit an odd neckline on a bridesmaid dress.  </li>
      <li>I dance and in addition to looking great with any racerback tanks I might want to wear this prevents my bra straps from slipping off of my shoulders and basically turns any bra into a sports bra (albeit a shmexy, not actually appropriate for actual sports bra).&lt;br</li>
      <li>This was a great disappointment.</li>
      <li>I have purchase these before and they did have clear.  </li>
      <li>The added clear bra straps and fabric tape were added bonuses.</li>
      <li>These did not work for me because the bras I have the straps are too far apart.</li>
      <li>If you are a woman who doesn&#x27;t really need a bra for support, but wears one for modesty or nipple coverage, then this product will likely work for holding your bra straps together as shown.  </li>
      <li>A little more bendable then ones I previously bought making it easier to place into position and also since it is more flexible it should be less likely to snap.  </li>
      <li>It dident come in a box (like pictured); They were very thin &amp; weak, unlike the teh REAL Strap Perfect,</li>
      <li>For a mere $7.31 &amp; free shipping (cheap compared to what they are in the stores) you get the 6 strap perfects AND a pack of bonus (24) invisible tape to use for such things as too low plunging neck lines etc.</li>
      <li>This product does exactly what I needed it to(hide my straps) - they are a little big</li>
      <li>I guess the straps on my bras are not very long b/c</li>
      <li>At first I was skeptical to order this, but I figured it was worth a shot.</li>
      <li>They have worked just fine, they haven&#x27;t broken yet and the straps have not slid out.  </li>

<li> and you can&#x27;t add another layer to pull back unless it is loose on you to start with.  </li>
<li> Just make sure you loosen the bra strap quite a bit, if not the pull is too tight and it will be uncomfortable at the end of the day.</li>
<li> i&#x27;m barely an \\&quot;a\\&quot; cup and this little do-hicky</li>
<li> it is a little uncomfortable after a few hours, but i&#x27;m kind of senstive...</li>
<li> This company sent me 2 black, 2 nude and 2 white, no clear.  </li>
<li> My daughter who is a size small has the same problem but to a lesser extent.</li>
<li> but they are too tight across my back.  </li>
<li> a few practice are essential.</li>
<li> /&gt;They&#x27;re extremely durable</li>
<li> Like other \\&quot;as seen on tv\\&quot; products this one is a 50-50.</li>
<li> and I needed these because one bra strap is always falling down.</li>
<li> I recommend putting it on behind you at the base of your neck and then, once it&#x27;s attached, pushing it down from the top and then reaching around your back and pulling it down from the bottom.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love wearing tanktops so these are extremely helpful.  They are really simple to use and surprisingly they aren&#x27;t flimsy.  I also feel like I get more support when i wear them. Definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> Harder than it looks to put on, but I suppose with more practice it&#x27;ll be OK. Haven&#x27;t worn it yet, just tried to affix it.  Hope it&#x27;ll not be uncomfotable as it first appeared to be on my practice.  Love the concept though and really hope it works for the racer back tanks I have - I am too endowed to go braless and can&#x27;t find racer back bras with enought support.  All in all, a good review.</li>
    <li> the \\&quot;perfect strap\\&quot; definitely does exactly what it&#x27;s advertised as... conceals straps and increases the (appearance) of your cup size... really nice lifting!  i&#x27;m barely an \\&quot;a\\&quot; cup and this little do-hicky made me a look like a \\&quot;b\\&quot; cup, awesome!    it is a little uncomfortable after a few hours, but i&#x27;m kind of senstive... so i wouldn&#x27;t let that deter you.</li>
    <li> they work very well. 3 sets ( 9 pieces). good deal, too.  The only concern is that you should get familiarized with your skills to put them on. a few practice are essential. then you will feel good about wearing your bras.</li>
    <li> I never even wore this one full day.  The clips are cheap, hard, and uncomfortable and difficult to put on.  Buy a convertible bra instead.  The multi-way bra from Victoria&#x27;s secret is a good one.</li>
    <li> i felt compelled to write this review because my wife nagged me.  she says its a really good bra strap concealer.    i took 1 star off beacuse of the high price (in my mind, these should go for like $4.99).  comes in pack of 6. i took one for use with my PC&#x27;s cable management.</li>
    <li> Bought these after my sister told me about them.  I have worn them a couple of times now with tops and dresses that would show the straps if I wore them otherwise.  They have worked just fine, they haven&#x27;t broken yet and the straps have not slid out.  I have not tried to use them on any bras that have thick straps yet, i&#x27;m not sure they would work on those.  I guess the straps on my bras are not very long b/c when i do use this product i find it rests up pretty high, close to my neck and doesn&#x27;t work if you have a keyhole type top on because that is exactly where the strap holder ends up resting on my back.</li>
    <li> this things are hard to put on and to take off, but the worse part is that they are uncomfortable, it hurt to wear them so I rather not. waste of money!</li>
    <li> I wanted to like these and wish it would have worked for me but they are too tight across my back.  I&#x27;m not \\&quot;chesty\\&quot; by any means or a big woman at all but maybe these straps work on a smaller framed woman.  They felt too tight to pull in my bra and you can&#x27;t add another layer to pull back unless it is loose on you to start with.  Guess I&#x27;ll have to keep looking.</li>
    <li> These really help with some nice lifting, make a slouchy bra provide more support, keeps the straps from falling off your shoulders - with a good bra, it can feel like you just lost 10 pounds off of your chest! Really comfortable. Now, pulling the straps in means that sometimes they cut you a bit different near the neck, but nothing too bad, and you can adjust the position to prevent or minimize that. And it&#x27;s so worth it, if you are large, to have that added comfort and support.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B001OR9PUO Strap Perfect Bra Clips Ultimate Bra Strap Solution- 6 Pack]]  This is a great product!!!! The material and design are so much better than the first one (other brand) I used. You can actually put this on without help. Another thing I like about this product is that you can easily slide up (tighter fit) or down by yourself as the clip glides thru your bra. Good value and so much better than expensive brands available in the market.</li>
    <li> First, if you have small breast these are great, if you have large breast, forget about it...lol&lt;br /&gt;they tend to snap, and bend and they dig into your back, so, I would not be recomending this to people.</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me.  Unless you are a contortionist or very flexible, it was very difficult to put on by myself.  I needed the help of another person.  Then the thing was so tight it was strangling. It does not accomodate thicker straps so my straps were bunched together.  This was a great disappointment.</li>
    <li> I did not like them. They irritate my skin. I guess I got them for emergencies and to try them. I would not recommend them. You can do without.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something to help me alter my bra to fit an odd neckline on a bridesmaid dress.  I really did not want to go strapless.  This worked perfectly!  The added clear bra straps and fabric tape were added bonuses.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand some of the poor reviews on this product written here. Especially people that wrote a review without even trying the thing first! For a mere $7.31 &amp; free shipping (cheap compared to what they are in the stores) you get the 6 strap perfects AND a pack of bonus (24) invisible tape to use for such things as too low plunging neck lines etc. A great value. Even if you do try them &amp; they aren&#x27;t for you the price is so low that you can just pass them along to someone else that probably will like them. Now for the review:&lt;br /&gt;I like many women am not a perfect cup size, I am between a D &amp; DD so it is very hard to find the correct bra for me. These little things work awesome for me! I didn&#x27;t read the directions, just took one out of the box &amp; had it on in a minute by myself (all I can say). They don&#x27;t \\&quot;dig\\&quot; into my back &amp; I can&#x27;t even feel that I have one on. You don&#x27;t have to use them just with tank tops either. I am using one right now on a camisole with a crappy built in bra &amp; these \\&quot;girls\\&quot; need their support &amp; they are getting them! Bottom line, the product does just as it says. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> These are perfect for me. Granted, though, I am a man and I only use this when I want to wear something sexy in drag. Nevertheless, I&#x27;ve used these strap-helpers multiple times and on virtually all the thrift store bras I have. Bless the inventor of this fine product. I will never mock &#x27;As Seen on TV&#x27; products ever again!</li>
    <li> My wife enjoyed the product highly...  She liked the different colors and the strong design. Recommend to all the ladies.</li>
    <li> If you are a woman who doesn&#x27;t really need a bra for support, but wears one for modesty or nipple coverage, then this product will likely work for holding your bra straps together as shown.  If you MUST have a bra for support this product was much to thin and bendy to hold the straps in place as advertised.</li>
    <li> I wanna say don&#x27;t waste your money but maybe others out there will have better luck figuring out how to use the product without it being so uncomfortable. Like other \\&quot;as seen on tv\\&quot; products this one is a 50-50.</li>
    <li> Very hard to actually use this product. Once it is on the bra straps, it is very, very hard to move it up or down the straps for comfort.</li>
    <li> Broke after a week or so.  Not happy with the quality-Found another locally that was much sturdier.  Wouldn&#x27;t recommend.  Don&#x27;t buy.</li>
    <li> These took a while to ship (2 weeks about I think), but I am very pleased with them. They work great; I use them all the time! It also comes with invisible tape which I haven&#x27;t used but is a nice bonus. Good for the price.</li>
    <li> It is hard to get on the bra and if you don&#x27;t loosen the straps first, it will be uncomfortable. That being said... It works wonders Lol. I am a 38 DD and it held me up just fine. It was comfortable and helps tons with posture. It is a great buy!</li>
    <li> I bought this and gave one to each of the women in my family as stocking stuffers (why would I need 6 of them?). I think they&#x27;re very handy, and kept the tan one for myself. It may stretch the straps out a bit, so I loosen them up before using. I don&#x27;t have to worry about straps showing at all though, which is great.</li>
    <li> A little more bendable then ones I previously bought making it easier to place into position and also since it is more flexible it should be less likely to snap.  Works just as stated.</li>
    <li> I mistook them for the TV name brand, but they&#x27;re alright, just a little cheaper built. I lost a few too, some being my fault and another just fell off my bra...which idk if it has to do with the products quality.</li>
    <li> At first I was skeptical to order this, but I figured it was worth a shot. I received it two days after I ordered it and it was exactly what I has hoping for. The product is super easy to use, and it hides my straps perfectly! Not uncomfortable at all, either.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I use these a lot. Just make sure you loosen the bra strap quite a bit, if not the pull is too tight and it will be uncomfortable at the end of the day.</li>
    <li> I love these! Still use them two years later. Gave some to a friend who also can&#x27;t live without them. They are perfect for racer back tops and the shape makes them easy to grab hold of and pull down into position.</li>
    <li> I bought these in a store and returned them. even with my straps extended as far as possible, they were way too tight. I wear a size 16-18 top and I felt like I was hooked up and hanging from a wall hook. My daughter who is a size small has the same problem but to a lesser extent. She continues to use them. For me they were worthless.</li>
    <li> I am a large breasted women with 42DD and I needed these because one bra strap is always falling down. These did not work for me because the bras I have the straps are too far apart. This would probably have worked fine if the straps had been a lot closer int he back. This is the only reason I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5.</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what I needed it to(hide my straps) - they are a little big but most of my tops hide it and the range of colors helps.</li>
    <li> We hunted all around for these in stores and online. Finally got them here. My wife loves them for her summer shirts.</li>
    <li> Very durable. But not easy to use without help. Fast shipping and product was exactly as described. Colors are great. But i do need help from my sister to apply this bra clip.</li>
    <li> bought them just for fun... have been wanting to try them. they stretched out my straps a little bit but wasnt too bad</li>
    <li> I cannot even explain how much I love this product. I dance and in addition to looking great with any racerback tanks I might want to wear this prevents my bra straps from slipping off of my shoulders and basically turns any bra into a sports bra (albeit a shmexy, not actually appropriate for actual sports bra).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels great, is largely unnoticeable, and is very easy to put on either by yourself or with someone else&#x27;s help. I recommend putting it on behind you at the base of your neck and then, once it&#x27;s attached, pushing it down from the top and then reaching around your back and pulling it down from the bottom. Have someone help you at first if it&#x27;s confusing or you&#x27;re getting frustrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re extremely durable and I&#x27;ve had mine for over two years now. I occasionally lose one but that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s great that this comes with so many. Basically, I couldn&#x27;t do without mine. Ladies of the world - get this. Seriously.</li>
    <li> The package says that it contains 2 black, 2 nude and 2 clear strap perfects.  I have purchase these before and they did have clear.  This company sent me 2 black, 2 nude and 2 white, no clear.  Obviously there was a substitution into the package.  I won&#x27;t send them back, but I won&#x27;t buy from this company again.</li>
    <li> What is pictured is not was being sold! They send you some cheap flimsy knock off version and there are not 6, there are 3. I was very very disappointed</li>
    <li> HORRIBLE!!  This is SO not what I ordered!  It dident come in a box (like pictured); They were very thin &amp; weak, unlike the teh REAL Strap Perfect, that I thought I was getting.  I&#x27;M ANNOYED!!! DO NOT ORDER if you are looking for something that will hold your  bra straps!</li>
    <li> Feel a little flimsy but does the job.</li>
    <li> These work exactly as they are intended to.  I never had an issues with them and they work very well.</li>
