      <li>If you have never used this you don&#x27;t know what clean hair is!</li>
      <li>Great product with natural ingredients.</li>
      <li>I love this shampoo, it makes my head feel really clean afterward</li>
      <li>Squeaky clean isn&#x27;t so good as that means it isn&#x27;t adding much moisture to my hair, and instead is stripping it of moisture.</li>
      <li>Leaves hair silky smooth</li>
      <li>I very much enjoy Dudu-Osum products and this is no exception.&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
      <li>Experienced considerable hairfall on me within the first washing.</li>
      <li>We were not disappointed.</li>
      <li>It is also great for dry itchy scalp.</li>
      <li>, I notice that my hair is squeaky clean when I use it.</li>
      <li>There is nothing special about this  product.  </li>
      <li>Love the soap, but the shampoo, not so much.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s normal, healthy feel.</li>
      <li>I love having this all natural shampoo.</li>
      <li>I figured using something completely herbal and natural would help keep my hair strong and healthy.</li>
      <li>It offers good moisture, but I think it&#x27;s too much if you have young dreads</li>
      <li>This shampoo dose not lather up very much</li>
      <li>Third try, I was sure.</li>
      <li>First try, my straw became hair again.</li>
      <li>After the first use, I felt an immediate difference.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t be afraid to try this as it gives your hair what it need to feel great and results in healthy shiny hair.</li>
      <li>I just bought this shampoo off Ebay since I am attempting to grow my hair very long and healthy.</li>
      <li>What it really does though is help to repair damaged hair, mediate dandruff problems, etc...</li>
      <li>It cleans my scalp so well and really lifts up dirt and debris.</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s the honey in the shampoo and conditioner that softens the hair so much.</li>
      <li>PH balance of shampoo is VERY drying.</li>
      <li>very clarifying (you could skip an ACV rinse)</li>
      <li>After using in my natural hair I had to deep condition twist in order to restore my strands and make them more pliable.</li>
      <li>Can we keep the main ingredients and maybe add something to make it smell prettier?</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t live without it..</li>
      <li>My cousin even gave me some professional high quality shampoos and nothing worked, until I started using this shampoo.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend if you are looking for a natural product to cleanse your scalp.</li>
      <li>I love dudu osum soap, not sure about shampoo</li>
      <li>I think this shampoo would be fine for other natural hairstyles and for people who have mature dreads.</li>
      <li>Cannot use everyday as dries my fine hair out.  </li>
      <li>btw i am afric-amer w natural hair.</li>
      <li>which mine are (6 month old).</li>
      <li>It really puts nutrients back in your hair.</li>
      <li>This man has information on how to natural eliminate psoriasis from your life.    </li>
      <li>I have curly mixed hair and it worked well on the first shampooing however, after the second time I used it on my dreads, it started loosening them.</li>
      <li>This shampoo is a lot cheaper than other psoriasis specific shampoos that I have tried, and it gives your scalp an amazingly cool sensation while you rub it in.</li>
      <li>I had started having problems with dandruff that no other shampoo could get rid of.</li>
      <li>It just takes all the daily grime off of your hair while leaving your natural hair oils.</li>

<li> It just takes all the daily grime off of your hair while leaving your natural hair oils.</li>
<li> so I don&#x27;t use too much and a little goes a long way.</li>
<li> My son has long, thick and natural hair with very bad dandruff; he has tried many many products and this is the ONLY shampoo that has worked for him.</li>
<li> and my scalps itches much less frequently with this shampoo than any other I have tried so far, and I have tried a lot of shampoos trying to alleviate an itchy scalp.</li>
<li> Even after deep conditioning using heat, followed by the LOC method, and finally twisting my hair using shea butter, I find that my hair is STILL extremely dry the next day when I take my hair down.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t have this problem using the SM Restorative Shampoo, and I think I may go back to using it or some other brand of ABS.</li>
<li> This product definitely works for people that have eczema and other scalp issues like psoriasis and dandruff.</li>
<li> this shampoo if you have dry hair from illness or genes, or if your head is itchy.</li>
<li> The shampoo itself is thicker than mega corporation brand shampoos, and a little goes a long way, even with long hair (such as I have).</li>
<li> As I said earlier, a little truly goes a long way.</li>
<li> Second try, I thought my head itched less.</li>
<li> My hair was stripped, further dried out and thinned.</li>
<li> Just so you know, a little goes a long way.</li>
<li> There are other herbs and oils, as well as tea tree oil.</li>
<li> /&gt;This is EXTREMELY drying to my hair.</li>
<li> I use it every other day.</li>
<li> On both a little goes a long way!</li>
<li> I have really thick coarse hair</li>
<li> like, frizzy, undefined mess.</li>
<li> This shampoo was too harsh on my hair.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s so dry, that my twists don&#x27;t form and sometimes my hair is hard to pull apart (eek!)</li>
<li> The decrease in dandruff and raw itchy scalp is one thing I&#x27;ve noticed a change in.</li>
<li> : The bottle is small, but dont let that dissuade you.</li>
<li> no more</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Love the soap, but the shampoo, not so much.  Cannot use everyday as dries my fine hair out.  Will use when I get dermatitis from a shampoo allergy.</li>
    <li> I love having this all natural shampoo. Just so you know, a little goes a long way. You really only need to use a dime sized amount.</li>
    <li> We have been using DuDu-Osum soap for over a year now so we decided to try this and the conditioner out as well. We were not disappointed. Best shampoo and conditioner we have ever used. Don&#x27;t be afraid to try this as it gives your hair what it need to feel great and results in healthy shiny hair. Your Gonna Love It!</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo. Bought it for my husband at local health food  store for $6.99, but they ran out. Bought 2 bottles because now I use it. Leaves my hair incredible.  As soon as my local health food store stacks up again, I&#x27;ll  buy 6. It&#x27;s a Great Product!</li>
    <li> i have been using this for years to wash my hair and i lov it. it has kept my hair so healthy. i love most that it has neem oil which is great for my scalp withouth the neem oil smell. used to have crazy dandruff dry and itchy scalp now no more and people comment all the time about how healthy my hair looks. btw i am afric-amer w natural hair. it has def helped w my hair growth. the only thing i wish is that it were easier to come by or i could get a bigger size</li>
    <li> I just bought this shampoo off Ebay since I am attempting to grow my hair very long and healthy. I figured using something completely herbal and natural would help keep my hair strong and healthy. It is just incredible! After the first use, I felt an immediate difference. I think it&#x27;s the honey in the shampoo and conditioner that softens the hair so much. There are other herbs and oils, as well as tea tree oil. Your scalp tingles a bit, it is so refreshing. Also, do not be fooled: this product is for any hair type. I am Caucasian with oily hair. This stuff doesn&#x27;t make my hair any more oily. It just takes all the daily grime off of your hair while leaving your natural hair oils. Amazing product!</li>
    <li> This was something of a revelation for me. The shampoo itself is thicker than mega corporation brand shampoos, and a little goes a long way, even with long hair (such as I have). What it really does though is help to repair damaged hair, mediate dandruff problems, etc...It also smells quite nice. I very much enjoy Dudu-Osum products and this is no exception.&lt;br /&gt;Note: The bottle is small, but dont let that dissuade you. As I said earlier, a little truly goes a long way.</li>
    <li> However, I liked the way my hair felt after using product.Can we keep the main ingredients and maybe add something to make it smell prettier?</li>
    <li> Shampoo is great and has tea tree oil in it so it really cleans your scalp without over drying.  Follow up with the conditioner and you&#x27;re good to go.  I use it every other day.</li>
    <li> This shampoo was recommended to me by a friend, and I really love it. It cleans my scalp so well and really lifts up dirt and debris. I have locs, and it is currently only the only shampoo I use. I highly recommend if you are looking for a natural product to cleanse your scalp.</li>
    <li> I only recommend this product if you don&#x27;t mind the cost. I have severe psoriasis and constantly look for products, foods, drinks, and information that will help to deal with this condition. This shampoo is a lot cheaper than other psoriasis specific shampoos that I have tried, and it gives your scalp an amazingly cool sensation while you rub it in. I honestly love using this shampoo, but using shampoo won&#x27;t get rid of the psoriasis. I encourage everyone to read this book about how to life a healthier life. This man has information on how to natural eliminate psoriasis from your life.    [...]</li>
    <li> I forgot I ordered it until I was doing these reviews.  I love dudu osum soap, not sure about shampoo</li>
    <li> Best shampoo...just not enough of it</li>
    <li> Removes excess oil without damage to hair and adds fullness. I have oiily hair and this is the best product I&#x27;ve found for Long term use</li>
    <li> My husband loves this soap considering this is the only soap he can. Use for his skin.... i have used it too and i love it too. I would recommend this soap to people who have a skin problem. This even better than dove soap.</li>
    <li> It is a shampoo with good aroma, nice texture and leaves hair shiny. I bought a second bottle to test 2 months to see results in the medium term</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. It has honey as #1 ingredient. I have really thick coarse hair and it lathers and washes wonderfully. The price is excellent. I have been using Dudu Osun soap for close to 20 yrs.</li>
    <li> Buyer for life! If you have never used this you don&#x27;t know what clean hair is! I use the dudu osum moist conditioner with it as you will need to follow your wash with a conditioner! On both a little goes a long way! Awesome natural clean product! I can&#x27;t live without it.. I use dudu bar soap, shampoo and conditioner and lotion!</li>
    <li> I got hooked on the Dudu-Osum soap and now I am hooked on thier shampoo. Great product, does what is says, highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Leaves hair silky smooth</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo, it makes my head feel really clean afterward and my scalps itches much less frequently with this shampoo than any other I have tried so far, and I have tried a lot of shampoos trying to alleviate an itchy scalp. I will continue to purchase this. I also use the conditioner that goes with it.</li>
    <li> This product definitely works for people that have eczema and other scalp issues like psoriasis and dandruff. The decrease in dandruff and raw itchy scalp is one thing I&#x27;ve noticed a change in. However, I&#x27;ve noticed another not so good change as well...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is EXTREMELY drying to my hair. I&#x27;m going to have to stop using it. Even after deep conditioning using heat, followed by the LOC method, and finally twisting my hair using shea butter, I find that my hair is STILL extremely dry the next day when I take my hair down. It&#x27;s so dry, that my twists don&#x27;t form and sometimes my hair is hard to pull apart (eek!) and it ends up being a straw like, frizzy, undefined mess. It also takes about 2 twisting sessions to get my hair back to it&#x27;s normal, healthy feel. (I twist every night) I also added JBCO to the shampoo, and it still gives my hair the same effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very clarifying (you could skip an ACV rinse) so I don&#x27;t use too much and a little goes a long way. If it does work for you, this is a great value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, I notice that my hair is squeaky clean when I use it. Squeaky clean isn&#x27;t so good as that means it isn&#x27;t adding much moisture to my hair, and instead is stripping it of moisture. I don&#x27;t have this problem using the SM Restorative Shampoo, and I think I may go back to using it or some other brand of ABS.</li>
    <li> My son has long, thick and natural hair with very bad dandruff; he has tried many many products and this is the ONLY shampoo that has worked for him.</li>
    <li> love this shampoo, it&#x27;s very good</li>
    <li> Great Shampoo. I had started having problems with dandruff that no other shampoo could get rid of. Not &amp;#34;Head &amp; Shoulder&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Selsum&amp;#34; nothing at all. My cousin even gave me some professional high quality shampoos and nothing worked, until I started using this shampoo. Will definitely order again, and it smells great!</li>
    <li> Great product with natural ingredients. Works great for cleaning and moisturizing locs.</li>
    <li> Bought this shampoo after watching a youtube video about it and how it works on dreadlocks. I have curly mixed hair and it worked well on the first shampooing however, after the second time I used it on my dreads, it started loosening them. It offers good moisture, but I think it&#x27;s too much if you have young dreads which mine are (6 month old). I think this shampoo would be fine for other natural hairstyles and for people who have mature dreads.</li>
    <li> Experienced considerable hairfall on me within the first washing. My hair was stripped, further dried out and thinned. PH balance of shampoo is VERY drying.</li>
    <li> This shampoo was too harsh on my hair.  However, every now and again I will use it as a face wash. After using in my natural hair I had to deep condition twist in order to restore my strands and make them more pliable. 😱😱🙆🏽🙅</li>
    <li> First try, my straw became hair again. Second try, I thought my head itched less. Third try, I was sure. Now I don&#x27;t even use conditioner after every shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;The color is...interesting. Who ever heard of pearly brown shampoo?&lt;br /&gt;The aroma is pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;The suds are abundant.&lt;br /&gt;The effect is magic.&lt;br /&gt;Buy this shampoo if you have dry hair from illness or genes, or if your head is itchy.</li>
    <li> This product was too dry for my hair,, not a fan of the smell either :(</li>
    <li> Weird funky smell, dried out my hair.  Threw it away.</li>
    <li> There is nothing special about this  product.  It also makes my hair dryer than it is already.  Will not buy again</li>
    <li> This shampoo dose not lather up very much but I like the results from it. It deep cleans without drying you hair out. It really puts nutrients back in your hair. It is also great for dry itchy scalp.</li>
