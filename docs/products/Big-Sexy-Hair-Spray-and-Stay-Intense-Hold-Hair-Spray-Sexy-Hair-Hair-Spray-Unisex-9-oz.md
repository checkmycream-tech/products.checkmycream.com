      <li>I wish there was a happy medium between super scented and light scented.</li>
      <li>Will for sure order from these fine folks again!  </li>
      <li>I received my latest order of this product today, and it is NOT as pictured.</li>
      <li>They mostly all work, (except for Dove flexible hold) but they make my scalp itch and give me eczema.</li>
      <li>Sexy Hairspray is his go-to.</li>
      <li>Living in North Carolina, this spray holds up to humidity which is here most of the year.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use haircare products but he sure as heck</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried all the Big Sexy Hairsprays and I think this is the best one.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite hairspray and I was so excited to find it for a better deal than in stores.</li>
      <li>Not much to say, one of the best hairsprays ive used.</li>
      <li>My hair stays perfectly with this product without weighing it down.</li>
      <li>This is a great product, especially for this price.</li>
      <li>Holds the style good enough but the smell is overwhelming</li>
      <li>Hair is somewhat stiff after being sprayed and gives the best hold.  </li>
      <li>This hair spray does exactly what its supposed to and more.</li>
      <li>Holds great, all day long!</li>
      <li>I love this hairspray so much</li>
      <li>Good stuff, make your hair definitely stick!</li>
      <li>Holds very very well!  </li>
      <li>But it doesn&#x27;t hold any better than the \\&quot;Spray and Play Harder\\&quot; which is what I normally use.  </li>
      <li>Next time, I will be paying full price in the store for better quality!</li>
      <li>This hairspray has an outstanding holding power with out weighing down fine hair even in humid  hot weather conditions.</li>
      <li>I love Big Sexy Hair Spray and Play and thought this would be similar.  </li>
      <li>My hair was left more brittle than anything else.</li>
      <li>First bought elsewhere, looked up to see if Amazon carried it .</li>
      <li>I ordered the Big Sexy Spray and Stay All Nighter as the photo shows..</li>
      <li>All Big Sexy products do what they&#x27;re supposed to do.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t live without Big Sexy hair products.  </li>
      <li>Like aqua net only better quality!</li>
      <li>I ordered Intense Hold.  </li>
      <li>It really helps keep the style of the hair for the whole day.</li>
      <li>It holds really well all day and it volumizes somewhat, too.</li>
      <li>a little goes a long way, holds great and gives hair a lot of volume.</li>
      <li>Have had other sprays to do a better job.  </li>
      <li>Often times we worry about buying items like this at such great prices - worrying that it&#x27;s watered down or old, etc.</li>
      <li>You can buy Big Sexy Spray and Play ANYWHERE, but your can as advertised right on the front of your picture says ALL NIGHTER, which  is much more difficult to find and this is what you advertised and this is  NOT Big Sexy All NIGHTER.</li>
      <li>I bought the Got2b and Big Sexy Hair Spray Intense Hold at the same time to test them out.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>Favorite hair spray with firm but flexible hold.  </li>
      <li>They sent the kind with the least holding power.  </li>
      <li>Love, love for days when it&#x27;s muggy, at beach, or raining.</li>
      <li>WOW!</li>
      <li>This hairspray, although a bit expensive, is great at holding my short hairstyle in place all day.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and realized it was probably the scent in their products.</li>
      <li>So far, neither Got2b or BSH has made my scalp break out in eczema, probably because they are not scented at all.</li>
      <li>Got2b Freeze spray is good, and at least half the price, i&#x27;ll probably use that from now on.</li>
      <li>I get day hold on fine, thick shoulder length hair.</li>
      <li>However, I have to make sure not to spray the hair while it is in the curling iron because it turns thick, dry and white and starts to crack near my ends.</li>
      <li>This is my FAVORITE hairspray, and the only one I use for my thin baby-fine hair.  </li>
      <li>It holds really well for hours and hours and doesn&#x27;t weight your hair down.</li>

<li> However, you can brush or pick and it becomes soft with only a slight loss in hold.  </li>
<li> Definitely recommend if you want an extreme hold especially if your a guy trying to achieve that faux hawk type look.</li>
<li> Be careful when buying this, I misread it as Spray and Play, which is a different product.  </li>
<li> Holds my hair all day long</li>
<li> There are several hairsprays on the market that will do the same thing for a lot less.</li>
<li> It is a little expensive for hairspray, but it holds better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
<li> This hair spray makes my hair feel dry and coated.  </li>
<li> -- I have thick heavy hair and it holds perfectly -- I rarely do touch up</li>
<li> My box arrived and the nozzle was loose inside of the cap.</li>

    <li> WOW! ordered 2- 9oz, received 2 with 40% more!  Now how good is that!  Will for sure order from these fine folks again!  Besides, love this product!</li>
    <li> This product smells like bug spray to me. Holds the style good enough but the smell is overwhelming</li>
    <li> This is the best quality hair spray I&#x27;ve ever used by far. You only need a little bit of this product and the hold lasts ALL night. Awesome for doing gorgeous hair styles...I can&#x27;t tell you how much I love this!</li>
    <li> Made my hair look oily. I like redken!</li>
    <li> I am so mad that this is a 9 oz can not the normal 10oz!!!!!!! unreturnable too. Very very unhappy about this! I would have never ordered a 9 oz. can, big rip off!!!</li>
    <li> Favorite hair spray with firm but flexible hold.  Hair is somewhat stiff after being sprayed and gives the best hold.  However, you can brush or pick and it becomes soft with only a slight loss in hold.  I get day hold on fine, thick shoulder length hair.</li>
    <li> Not much to say, one of the best hairsprays ive used. Gives allot of flexibility while keeping that hold all day!</li>
    <li> a little goes a long way, holds great and gives hair a lot of volume. i would dif buy again</li>
    <li> Good stuff, make your hair definitely stick! Will keep buying.</li>
    <li> I find this hairspray too sticky and my hair looses its shine.</li>
    <li> I love this hairspray so much I subscribed it twice -- I have thick heavy hair and it holds perfectly -- I rarely do touch up but when I do -- it not a lot</li>
    <li> My hair stays perfectly with this product without weighing it down. This is a good place to get it at a great price.</li>
    <li> This is the only hairspray that works for my fine-type hair. I wish I could get it locally instead of having to order it off the web.</li>
    <li> Like aqua net only better quality!</li>
    <li> Love, love for days when it&#x27;s muggy, at beach, or raining. Holds firm. if your&#x27;e looking for soft hold, this is the wrong product for you.</li>
    <li> There are several hairsprays on the market that will do the same thing for a lot less. Got2b Freeze spray is good, and at least half the price, i&#x27;ll probably use that from now on. I bought the Got2b and Big Sexy Hair Spray Intense Hold at the same time to test them out. You can name any drug store brand, I&#x27;ve tried them all. They mostly all work, (except for Dove flexible hold) but they make my scalp itch and give me eczema. I have sensitive skin and realized it was probably the scent in their products. So far, neither Got2b or BSH has made my scalp break out in eczema, probably because they are not scented at all. A bit of a bummer. I wish there was a happy medium between super scented and light scented. Anyway, I&#x27;ll be saving my money from now on and go with Got2b.</li>
    <li> Will continue to buy this again and again! It&#x27;s an awesome product and keeps your hair in place all day and night!</li>
    <li> Holds very very well!  This is the only hairspray I use!</li>
    <li> this product gives a good hold to the hair.</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price. Always on time</li>
    <li> Best hairspray ever and I&#x27;ve tried a LOT of hairsprays. This one holds best AND never flakes; even after next-day sprays.</li>
    <li> thought t was the bigger can that was advertised, kinda was a let down</li>
    <li> First bought elsewhere, looked up to see if Amazon carried it . When I found they did &amp; at a lower price I was thrilled. Sexy Hair Spray &amp; Stay is the best hair spray I&#x27;ve found. Hair stays put all days &amp; night without being heavy &amp; doesn&#x27;t leave flakes when you comb hair.</li>
    <li> This hairspray has an outstanding holding power with out weighing down fine hair even in humid  hot weather conditions. Very good spray</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t live without Big Sexy hair products.  I&#x27;ve been blessed with great hair and a fabulous stylist.  All Big Sexy products do what they&#x27;re supposed to do.  I have NEVER been disappointed!!!!</li>
    <li> Be careful when buying this, I misread it as Spray and Play, which is a different product.  This is just hair spray.</li>
    <li> My favorite hair spray!</li>
    <li> Been using this product for years on my hard to tame hair. Smells nice and holds well without feeling sticky.</li>
    <li> u guys charged me 17.89 for it.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, especially for this price. Holds great, all day long!</li>
    <li> great hold for all day</li>
    <li> New to hairsprays, I must say this stuff is awesome! Before buying I always had issues with keeping my hair in one place when going out. Came across this product and thought I&#x27;d give it a try. This hair spray does exactly what its supposed to and more. It holds really well for hours and hours and doesn&#x27;t weight your hair down. Definitely recommend if you want an extreme hold especially if your a guy trying to achieve that faux hawk type look. Will buy again when I run out!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hairspray and I was so excited to find it for a better deal than in stores. My box arrived and the nozzle was loose inside of the cap. I pushed it back on and now it doesn&#x27;t  spray evenly. Next time, I will be paying full price in the store for better quality!</li>
    <li> Have had other sprays to do a better job.  My hair was left more brittle than anything else.</li>
    <li> Great quality hairspray. This hairspray has the best hold I have ever experienced.  I would definitely order this again in the future.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m reviewing this on behalf of my fella. Yes, the tables are turned. I don&#x27;t use haircare products but he sure as heck does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Big Sexy Hairspray is his go-to. He prefers it over BedHead (in the silver can) which I reckon is a competitor of this brand. He does need to reapply once or twice a day to keep his hair in place though. It doesn&#x27;t get that weird hairspray crusty look or feel.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this hairspray!  It&#x27;s a great hold without being overwhelming or too sticky!  You don&#x27;t need a lot so it lasts awhile.  Great product!</li>
    <li> This is my FAVORITE hairspray, and the only one I use for my thin baby-fine hair.  It holds really well all day and it volumizes somewhat, too.</li>
    <li> I could not get this to come out without enough coming out for 6 people.  I gave it to my daughter and she lives it.</li>
    <li> This is the  best spray I ever bought. I highly recommend it. The spray holds for among time. It even works well with a convertible tested myself.</li>
    <li> This hair spray works wonders for me when I curl my hair. However, I have to make sure not to spray the hair while it is in the curling iron because it turns thick, dry and white and starts to crack near my ends. So, i wait until the curl comes off of the barrel and then spray it. It seriously holds all night. Nest hairspray i&#x27;ve used in a while!</li>
    <li> I ordered Intense Hold.  They sent the kind with the least holding power.  I didn&#x27;t even look at the label until I returned from an event with droopy hair!  I continued to use the spray, but my hair only responds to the heavy duty variety.</li>
    <li> Super product, excellent seller!</li>
    <li> This is my go to spray. Living in North Carolina, this spray holds up to humidity which is here most of the year.</li>
    <li> I was afraid of this leaving that shiny hair gel look but holy crap, it doesn&#x27;t have that and i love it!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. I haven&#x27;t found one other hair spray that can hold my bangs in place out of my face all day long. I keep one at home, at work, and in my gym bag.</li>
    <li> I love Big Sexy Hair Spray and Play and thought this would be similar.  Wrong.  It is just awful for my hair.  It feels sticky and gunks up after a day or two.  I have thin, dry, fine hair.  It might work on other hair types.</li>
    <li> Best hair spray I&#x27;ve found on Amazon yet. I&#x27;ve tried all the Big Sexy Hairsprays and I think this is the best one.</li>
    <li> This is a good product and a good price.  It hold my hair in place with out being stiff.  It is touchable</li>
    <li> This hair spray makes my hair feel dry and coated.  But it doesn&#x27;t hold any better than the \\&quot;Spray and Play Harder\\&quot; which is what I normally use.  I will stick with that in the future.</li>
    <li> False advertising. You can buy Big Sexy Spray and Play ANYWHERE, but your can as advertised right on the front of your picture says ALL NIGHTER, which  is much more difficult to find and this is what you advertised and this is  NOT Big Sexy All NIGHTER. Very Disappointed. . I&#x27;ll just have Walgreens order me the correct can. I have used this product for years. Two totally different hair sprays, look at your pic.</li>
    <li> Often times we worry about buying items like this at such great prices - worrying that it&#x27;s watered down or old, etc. NOT the case here - great item!!</li>
    <li> This is the best defense against the Louisiana humidity.  I&#x27;ve tried other expensive brands but they were a waste of money.  This is the best!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for 2 yrs. and I love it!  Holds my hair all day long and it&#x27;s not sticky or heavy. Even on the windiest days my hair holds up.</li>
    <li> I received my latest order of this product today, and it is NOT as pictured. I ordered the Big Sexy Spray and Stay All Nighter as the photo shows.. I received the lesser holding quality Spray and Stay . I&#x27;m wondering if the All Nighter is discontinued. They don&#x27;t carry it in brick and mortar stores anymore.</li>
    <li> This hairspray, although a bit expensive, is great at holding my short hairstyle in place all day. Have to be careful not to use too much though as that will cause a crusty buildup; a few well placed sprays after a touch of sculpting wax have my hair secured while retaining a natural look.</li>
    <li> This hairspray does a really good job at holding styles. I use it on myself and also on my 3 daughters when I put their hair up in different styles. It is a little expensive for hairspray, but it holds better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Love this product. It really helps keep the style of the hair for the whole day. Great price on Amazon too!</li>
    <li> Best hairspray.  I did receive the play and stay ALL NIGHT, as pictured in the photo.</li>
