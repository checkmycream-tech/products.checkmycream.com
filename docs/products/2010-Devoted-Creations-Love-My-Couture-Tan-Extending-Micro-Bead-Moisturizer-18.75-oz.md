<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> love this stuff, keeps my skin soft all day and smelling amazing. smells just like viva la juicy by juicy couture. bottle lasts a while and doesnt really turn hands orange but gives skin a great glow all day</li>
    <li> I am african american and was a bit hesitant when purchasing this only because it darkens your skin gradually overtime. HOWEVER, I LOVED the smell so much it doesn&#x27;t even bother me to know it is somewhat of a tanner! Nice Fragrance!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.s. Shipping was good!</li>
    <li> I recommend this lotion! It hydrates perfectly. It is suitable for face (I have no reddness after it. My skin type is mixed) and I use it everyday. Skin looks great with a light glow. Very good product and I never knew that a brand of tanning cosmetics has better products than ones from drugstore!</li>
    <li> The list of lotions I&#x27;ve tried is extremely long and then I found this one.  It goes on like silk and makes your skin super smooth with a healthy glow.  I highly recommend this one.  I&#x27;m on my second bottle.  Just an FYI, the best prices (including shipping costs) I&#x27;ve found are from the Amazon seller Half-Off Lotions storefront.  Some sellers charge lower prices but have higher shipping, so do your homework.</li>
    <li> Whether or not it helps actually extend my tan is up for debate, but regardless it&#x27;s a wonderful smelling lotion that leaves my skin feeling like silk. Always a beauty staple in my bathroom.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this moisturizer!  You get a big bottle of the best smelling tan extender, and its cheap!!  By far the best after tan moisturizer I have used to date.  Softens, glows, perfumes ... what else should there be in a moisturizer for this price?    It smells very similar/if not a 98% replica to Juicy Couture.  Also makes that after tan smell go away more than other moisturizers.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this lotion from my tanning salon at a 110% price mark up. The lotion is exactly the same but at an affordable price.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite lotion ever!!! Mostly used daily in the summer but also in the cooler months! Wonderful smell and moisture!</li>
    <li> This is without a doubt, the best after tanning lotion I have ever used, and believe me when I say that I have tried many.  Love My Couture leaves my skin feeling like silk and the smell is intoxicating. Most leave you feeling moisturized immediately after putting them on and smell like, well, like lotion.  Love My Couture leaves my skin feeling ab fab all day and since I use it before I get out of the shower, my robe smells great too! Bonus!!!</li>
    <li> Really like how soft it makes my skin feel, but personally the smell is too strong and too sweet for me. I probably won&#x27;t purchase this again.</li>
    <li> This product was just okay. Can&#x27;t say anything exciting about it. It wasn&#x27;t terribly,  just not great enough for me to order it again. There are much better moisturizers.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Smells great .</li>
    <li> This is my favorite lotion. smells amazing. I&#x27;ve ordered 3x before and will continue to use this lotion</li>
    <li> This is an AMAZING moisturizer!  The smell is amazing, (smells like juicy couture) and it lasts all day. It kept my skin from drying out, even when tanning every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that being said - I purchased it from Select-Goods my second time around. DO NOT  purchase it from that seller!! I got a diluted version,  and they would not refund my money citing that &amp;#34;the product had been opened&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I really love the scent of this lotion and it keeps me so soft. I&#x27;ll keep buying it for sure!!</li>
    <li> Keeps my color from one tanning session to the next and leaves skin smooth and young looking. Would recommend to anyone</li>
    <li> I used to work in a tanning salon that sold Devoted Creations products exclusively. They are great products and really supplement your tan. This cream is a great moisturizer and really prolongs your tan</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell at all and it lingers all day. But it does have really great hydration. I only need to use it once a day and I&#x27;m not all dry and ashy like I would be with just basic lotion. So if you like the smell it&#x27;s great! But I probably will find something else.</li>
    <li> This lotion has a fantastic smell to it and absorbs very well.  It has moisturizing beads that leave your skin very soft.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. It doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling greasy but it is thick and rich enough to moisturize all day long and it smells amazing.</li>
