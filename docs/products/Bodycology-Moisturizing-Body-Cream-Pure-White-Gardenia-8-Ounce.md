    <li> As a loyal amazon.com customer since they first went into business selling books, I buy nearly everything I can from them.  The price for my favorite lotion is over the moon....buy it from Drugstore.com for $3.99 each.  I wish amazon.com would offer it at a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the aroma of gardenias and have some in our garden......this fragrance is very close to the real thing!  Come on. amazon......please find&lt;br /&gt;another seller or kindly ask them to revisit their pricing....I only like to buy from you.</li>
    <li> This is a nice smooth skin cream, not greasy, and with a lovely fragrance.  This is a favorite of mine, and I recommend it to anyone with dry skin problems.</li>
    <li> I love the scent of Gardina. It&#x27;s not a heavy scent. I wish amazon had a scent of Gardina that lingered with you all day. After bath is the best time to use it.</li>
    <li> such a light clean fragrance and love the depth of the lotion</li>
    <li> This was a gift for a friend.  She loved the smell and it was moisturizing.  It seemed a little difficult to rub in, but eventually it did and left our hands feeling soft.</li>
    <li> this lotion is the BEST! I love everything about it especially the scent, you can&#x27;t lose this this product. yep</li>
    <li> I enjoyed this cream, the scent is light, first came across it at a Target store in a white tube labeled White Gardenia by Bodycology. When I ran out I looked for it again but found it had been replaced with new scents. Got online on Amazon and found it as Pure White Gardenia by Bodycology. I would have to say the scents are identical. it is sold as both body lotion as well as cream. I use it on my hands, feet and elbows after a shower. It works wonders on dry heels and smells beautiful in the process too.</li>
    <li> Smells good, thick cream lotion</li>
    <li> Overpriced but smells wonderful</li>
    <li> Very good product. Ty!</li>
    <li> My wife was already using this product and when it was running out she requested another tube. This is a testament to the quality and effectiveness of the cream.</li>
    <li> For winter this is a good cr&amp;egrave;me for all over body, to fight the dry season.</li>
    <li> This also is very nice!</li>

    <li> Bought as a gift for my girlfriend who can&#x27;t find this anywhere else. She always gives me a huge hug when I surprise her with a new one. She loves the cream and she smells beautiful with it on. What more could one ask for?</li>
    <li> I love it.  Have been having trouble finding it until I thought of good ole&#x27; Amazon.  Thank you, Amazon!</li>
