    <li> I always used this product for years, I recieved it and the aroma is not the same.  The first bottle the sprayer doesn&#x27;t work and the secomd one dosen&#x27;t smell like Animale.  I never had this problem with other vendor.</li>

    <li> Not like the original. The scent is the same but it lasts for about 30minutes only. Then it&#x27;s gone....</li>
