      <li>came very quick in mail.</li>
      <li>they are easy to use, but the ends are not stable, they move in &amp; out.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like foam, it tears very quick and easy.</li>
      <li>Better if used with special paper in order to prevent ends to come out of the roller.</li>

      <li>Overall good product.</li>
      <li>These work good but the white caps come on</li>

      <li>I  can sleep pretty comfortably in they and they do not fall out of my hair.  </li>
      <li>These are good for 2-5 times of use, but if you are looking for real ones that you plan to keep in the bathroom closet and use time and again, skip these and buy real ones with real quality.</li>
      <li>This product does a great job at heat less curling.</li>
      <li>The best part is that I only paid ONE DOLLAR for each pack of these exact same rollers at Dollar Tree.  </li>
      <li>My daughter has fine straight hair.</li>
      <li>I am all for cheap alternatives when it comes to certain things</li>
      <li>Grandkids have had fun with these though.</li>
      <li>It was worth it, and I have purchased another set of them to replace the ones that will eventually fall apart.</li>
      <li>and I needed so many that I really didn&#x27;t want to put out that much money for &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; ones.  </li>
      <li>but they are cool and very flexible.</li>

      <li>I think the description should have been more specific.</li>
      <li>My daughter was able to have curly hair that lasted all day long.  </li>
      <li>my daughter needed more then one pack because of her long hair.</li>
      <li>will update later if anything changes, but I highly recommend these curling rods for anyone who wants the beauty of curly hair without the effort of anything more than sleeping in curlers.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> see picture i like them its nice</li>
    <li> Love them will buy more.</li>
    <li> It was not close to what I had in mind. I think the description should have been more specific.</li>
    <li> These are nice. Work well but a little too long for my hair length. Oh well, will just have to purchase a shorter version.</li>
    <li> The white cap at end popped out on all of them</li>
    <li> They smell wierd and make your hair smell wierd the first few uses. They gave me really nice curls and I didn&#x27;t have to much trouble sleeping on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine hair but a lot of it, making it nither thick or thin. This being said I only needed 11 for my whole head.</li>
    <li> Thank You!!! Love it!!</li>
    <li> Its great! I love it a lot:)</li>
    <li> I actually like them.  They work pretty good on my hair.  I just use them to turn the ends under on my bob.  Agree with other posters, they don&#x27;t last long, but its to be expected.  I  can sleep pretty comfortably in they and they do not fall out of my hair.  The best part is that I only paid ONE DOLLAR for each pack of these exact same rollers at Dollar Tree.  They will last about three weeks to a month with daily use, then the ends start falling off.  For what I paid, ( two dollars for two packs, enough to curl ends under all around my head).  It was worth it, and I have purchased another set of them to replace the ones that will eventually fall apart.</li>
    <li> Cheap feeling... used only a few times and then had to pitch them.</li>
    <li> I like them they are easy to use, but the ends are not stable, they move in &amp; out. This causes hair to get caught in them &amp; pulled- resulting in breakage</li>
    <li> This product didnt work for my thick hair. The foam curler didnt even hold my hair over night. When I woke up the foam curlers were all out of my hair. Did not keep any curl.</li>
    <li> First off it&#x27;s my fault because I had so many taps up, I wasn&#x27;t paying attention. If I had realized that these were made of foam, I would have never brought them. I am all for cheap alternatives when it comes to certain things but when it comes to my hair, I don&#x27;t do cheap. These are good for 2-5 times of use, but if you are looking for real ones that you plan to keep in the bathroom closet and use time and again, skip these and buy real ones with real quality. I don&#x27;t like foam, it tears very quick and easy. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll even ever use these. For me it was a waste but again my fault for multi-tasking. It shipped when expected, just was really surprised when I opened the package and realized what it was made of :/</li>
    <li> I have not been able to get them to stay in my hair all night which was my original purpose but they are cool and very flexible.</li>
    <li> I just got these curlers in yesterday and I was a little apprehensive. You have to roll your hair and then bend the ends towards each other to keep the hair from falling out. They did not come with any instructions, but if you&#x27;re a savvy shopper, you should know to do your research on a product before buying it, so I knew that I had to roll the hair and then bend the curlers. I bent them upwards and made the ends touch and they stayed in all night. It was a little uncomfortable at first, but then I realized that it was my memory foam &amp;#34;firm&amp;#34; pillow that was causing the discomfort. After I got a regular pillow, the rollers were not all that uncomfortable on my head anymore. I wake often at night and every time I would check my hair the rollers were still in place. In the morning, I was pretty skeptical, as I always am when trying something new, but when I took the rollers out (I had used 10 on my long hair) and finger-combed through my hair, I was stoked to see how bouncy and curly my hair was! It&#x27;s like having loose spiral curls without the torture of a perm or the annoyance of having to use a curling iron. My 8 year old was equally as impressed and immediately wanted me to do it to her hair, too, lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, overall, I&#x27;m not sure if there&#x27;s fancier curling rods out there, but there surely are more expensive ones, and I&#x27;m really happy with the price I paid and the results I got. I wish I could post a picture so y&#x27;all could see how awesome my hair is! As far as quality, they&#x27;re made of foam and they bend and twist, but nothing broke on my first night using them.&lt;br /&gt;I will update later if anything changes, but I highly recommend these curling rods for anyone who wants the beauty of curly hair without the effort of anything more than sleeping in curlers.</li>
    <li> These work good but the white caps come on</li>
    <li> These work SO well. I will buy more soon.</li>
    <li> These are birthing like he real curl formers or flexi rods, these are very soft and arnt hard like the way it&#x27;s suppose to be</li>
    <li> They come exactly as they look and I think you get a lot for the price! I would definitely recommend this item.</li>
    <li> Use them...Pretty good</li>
    <li> umm.... my kinky hair doesn&#x27;t like the foam curlers. i read all the reviews on the flexi rods and decided to give them a try. once i tried them i came to the conclusion that i wasted my money on them. they don&#x27;t curl my hair, the hold isn&#x27;t all that great. but they are easy to sleep in and they&#x27;re soft. the foam flexi rods didn&#x27;t work for my African american hair but it might work for you. i think i&#x27;m gonna try flexi rods made out of rubber or other stronger material.</li>
    <li> Love this worth every penny</li>
    <li> These rollers are poorly made. On the first use the end caps fell off while I was rolling the hair. The material is also inferior.</li>
    <li> The curlers are good but the ends popped off after one use. I still use them but don&#x27;t know for how much longer. It my be the fact that I have locs and it&#x27;s too much hair for them but who knows.</li>
    <li> F.y.i - all the white ends/caps on flexi rods CAN come off. Just pop them back on! As long as they last with proper care and can apply to hair without  snagging the hair i don&#x27;t see what&#x27;s the difference between the typical material of a &amp;#34;higher quality&amp;#34; flexi rod and these?! I mean I have shine high quality rods and i was so upset when the cap popped off when using, too find that if i pushed the former down the flexi rod the cap easily attached back, no problems since! Side note: these are wayyyy overpriced people. Do your research first.</li>
    <li> This product says CONTAINS MATERIALS THAT MAY CAUSE CANCER. When I contacted Amazon they didn&#x27;t care that they&#x27;d sold me something that could cause cancer. Avoid this product.</li>
    <li> These things don&#x27;t stay in my hair and fall out all of the time. I wish i never bought them. Also they do not make nice curls, and you have to use clips to get them to stay in the hair. Bending does not do anything!</li>
    <li> No instructions.  Terrible hold.  Even the finest YouTube videos published by the most stylish teenage girls did not help me figure out how to twist these rollers into my hair, and keep them there long enough to make any difference.</li>
    <li> It needs improvement.</li>
    <li> I used to use heat everyday for about an hour to achieve these curls. All I do now I dampen my hair get like 20 tiny bands. I wrap  the hair like i would on my curling wand and tie it at the end. Putting it In takes like ten minutes and they&#x27;re heatless!</li>
    <li> Would say 5 stars but the little white things on the end catch your hair when taking them out and pulls it. Hurts like hell.</li>
    <li> I bought this item for my daughter as a stocking stuffer for Christmas.  The seller decided to put 1 package of curlers in the box instead of 4.  4 packages is what I paid for but only received 1.  Shipping the correct items is simple stupid.  What a pain in the &amp;#34;you know what&amp;#34; to return such a mundane item for a refund.  Never buy from this seller.</li>
    <li> My daughter has very long and thick hair ( by long I mean she can sit on and so thick the big ponytail holders can&#x27;t hold it). These work perfectly for her and makes really pretty curls.</li>
    <li> Great for curling your hair and managing it. Love it . It is comfortable to sleep in and your head won&#x27;t be sore in the morning.</li>
    <li> Used them a few times, works well. Depends on the style you are looking for.</li>
    <li> I have used it once and it tamed my wild natural black hair.... I&#x27;ll recommend it</li>
    <li> I love these. My hair looks so good when I take the rollers out in the morning. Its a super quick easy way to have great hair the next day! You just have to be careful with how you roll them. It can be uncomfortable to sleep in if you don&#x27;t flatten them against your head. I get lots of compliments on my hair and lots of people ask how long it takes me to get ready in the mornings... haha.</li>
    <li> Still learning how to use them</li>
    <li> Would not purchase again, these are terrible for they do not stay put on your hair no matter what you do even if you use bobbypins.&lt;br /&gt;Threw them out and good riddence.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves them. They are easy for her to do and her hair turns out curly and adorable.</li>
    <li> Brought this for a friend and she loves them. This product does a great job at heat less curling. Works on many different hair types and leaves hair spirally all day long.......well as long as you apply hair spray. Overall good product.</li>
    <li> they work well but are quite inferior compared to some others that i bought. I personally would not get these again because I&#x27;ve purchased stronger ones.</li>
    <li> These are just a mess I wish I could get rid of them. They are horrible colors and really just make you look like Shirley Temple.</li>
    <li> I used these once and was ready to throw them away. First, my hair slipped out multiple times. I had to try and re-set them but this was impossible as once they were bent once they did not return back to their regular shape. Don&#x27;t waste your time on this product.</li>
    <li> The ends made them too hard to sleep with!</li>
    <li> I just loved this product.  My daughter was able to have curly hair that lasted all day long.  I put the curlers in before she went to bed, She said it wasn&#x27;t too hard for her to sleep and then after taking the curlers out in the morning awesome curls.</li>
    <li> My mom is a hairdresser so I was very apprehensive about buying these for my 9 yr old daughter but she has long thick hair and I needed so many that I really didn&#x27;t want to put out that much money for &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; ones.  My mom actually rolled these for my daughter and said she preferred them to her more expensive ones.  My daughter slept in them and because they are so lightweight she didn&#x27;t complain about them being heavy or terribly uncomfortable.  In the morning they were still all in place and her hair looked AWESOME...she loved it!  Curls everywhere.</li>
    <li> This product literally sucks.  My hair is to thick for these.  Didn&#x27;t realize that until the product arrived.  This product is definitely not for people with really thick, curly and wavy hair.  That&#x27;s just my opinion and what I have experienced.</li>
    <li> These rollers are good for temporary use. I have used them a couple of times now, and the white round piece at the tip of the rollers is already coming out. For the cost, I didn&#x27;t expect them to last for very long, so I guess I got what I paid for.</li>
    <li> These are dollar store quality, literally... I saw these at the dollar store. If your looking for quality flexi rods try the Diane brand.</li>
    <li> They are good for small tight curls.</li>
    <li> great product, great if you dont want to apply heat to your hair but want to have great curls.</li>
    <li> these are alright but don&#x27;t think they will last long. Grandkids have had fun with these though.</li>
    <li> they&#x27;re pretty flimsy</li>
    <li> These are the best rollers for quic curls, traveling and no fuss. I couldn&#x27;t believe the flexibility. Great  stylistic accessory</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase, you can either use them at night keep them and you will be ready the next morning or use a dryer and you will have perfect curls in 1 hour. I loooove these rollers!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like them and i want my money back and they over charged me and i don&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> these are not the best quality flex rods and next time i would go to an authentic hair shop to get a better quality. CVS also sells the good brands but way to expensive. these did work great but won&#x27;t last.</li>
    <li> good product. Works as well as the name brand, works best with wet hair. I haven&#x27;t tried it with dry hair because I&#x27;m a little skeptical about the hold of the ends.all in all it&#x27;s a great product and you get 4 packs!!! I might purchase another 4 packs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy these, and save some money.</li>
    <li> Came in the mail early. I love the colors. They are a little flimsy but still good for hair. Especially for the price. Love em.</li>
    <li> I bought this type of curler several years ago but one by one they broke, the wire inside of the rubber curler back then. These are a styrofoam type but they work just as well and I get great spirals every time and they do not pull when removing them!</li>
    <li> MY HAIR MAY JUST BE TOO SHORT FOR THESE. IT&#x27;S ONLY ABOUT 7&amp;#34; AND IT WOULDN&#x27;T GRAB THE HAIR. I&#x27;M AN EX HAIRDRESSER AND I DON&#x27;T WANT TO USE END PAPERS TO THROW SOME RODS IN MY HAIR.</li>
    <li> My friend used these on hair long nice hair and the curls looked great in the morning!</li>
    <li> tHE PICTURE IS NOT WHAT THEY ARE ACTUALLY LIKE.. AND i SENT THEM BACK, VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THE PRODUCT, SORRY.</li>
    <li> I bought the product so use with my dreadlocks. The foam rollers are very flimsy and did not work on my hair. If I was someone with extremely straight, then this product might work.</li>
    <li> these work great. one pack alone was six bucks in walmart. my daughter needed more then one pack because of her long hair. came very quick in mail. recommend.</li>
    <li> The product is not very sturdy and seems like they will fall apart after one or two uses.  It is flexible but does not hold its shape as good as I would like it to.</li>
    <li> This is by far the WORST product I have come across .. Do not purchase this .. It does not work AT ALL Save your Money People !!!!!!</li>
    <li> I like them but I wish I ordered the conair  ones instead the work much better and they have a much better hold I also think that the material is cheap and does not last long</li>
    <li> Shipping was so fast. They are a little flimsy, however they do get the job done. Love them and besides that you get 20 for the price of one pack</li>
    <li> Not great. The first time you put them in, it&#x27;s as easy as working with flex rollers is. But, after that, they don&#x27;t return close enough to the normal shape, and so the wire inside the foam rolls around when you are trying to roll your hair up, making it a really frustrating task. Also, the plastic caps on the end are super uncomfortable. I could never sleep in these. Maybe I just don&#x27;t like flex rollers...</li>
    <li> Fast shipper. Not the greatest product though. Couldnt keep it in and was a little awkward to use. Instructions would help, but still not exactly what we hoped for.</li>
    <li> Got itto curl my hair and it was a lil messed up first caise it was my first time but now i think i git it</li>
    <li> Great idea to curl hair, doesn&#x27;t lock in place too well. But it does what it is suppose to, it makes small curls.</li>
    <li> This is for people that dead hair.  I have thick hair so it really didn&#x27;t do anything ...instead i gave to my 2 year to play with it and he is enjoying it...</li>
    <li> These work great with soft moisturized hair. Shipping came fast and package was accurate!!</li>
    <li> Great! The spiral rollers are easy to use and makes wonderful natural bouncing curls. You do not need to use many of them since when you unroll the hair it creats double and triple bouncing curls. Better if used with special paper in order to prevent ends to come out of the roller.

    <li> My daughter has fine straight hair. I have course, thick hair. We both tried them and both got great results. Best of all no heat!</li>
    <li> Love these. Easy to manage and adds great fullness to my hair.</li>
    <li> These are amazing , there&#x27;s so many of them &amp;&amp; they shipped early. I will totally buy these again.</li>
    <li> These are definitely worth having! I have dreads and they gave me great curls</li>
    <li> Decent quality. They work well, I like how they leave my hair.</li>
    <li> did not do whats its intended to do, very light and unusable. will not buy this item ever again its not worth your money</li>
