      <li>They were so cute and fluffy and warm!</li>
      <li>Warm and soft.</li>
      <li>They are cute but really dissapointed bc</li>
      <li>Other than that they are great.</li>
      <li>they&#x27;re so adorable and soft!</li>
      <li>I will say they are cute though, and have given them to a friend for her young daughter,</li>
      <li>The slippers took a while to come but they are definitely worth the wait.</li>
      <li>Compared to other slippers I&#x27;ve had, the amount of padding was good.</li>
      <li>the right size</li>
      <li>Took quite awhile to get to me but these little slippers are comfortable and just too cute!</li>
      <li>Super cute and cozy, I had to stretch the top part where your foot goes in when I first got them to get my foot in but</li>

      <li>They look exactly as they do in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>High quality, soft, squishy, and comfortable.</li>
      <li>I really like these.</li>
      <li>They were very accommodating, and offered me a refund for my lost slippers.</li>
      <li>The only cons I&#x27;ve found are that the slippers do make a good amount of noise on hard floors, and that if your feet are swollen (say from an ant bite or walking all day despite showering), then they can be a little hard to squeeze into height wise.</li>
      <li>The projected arrival was already about one month after purchase and these guys came in more than two weeks late!</li>
      <li>I do see what other reviewers are saying about the sole being a bit small and that I can kind of feel the edges of it.</li>
      <li>These took a long time to come, as they were shipped directly from China.</li>

<li> It took too long to get it.</li>
<li> Also they are not adult size AT ALL.</li>
<li> If you regularly wear a size 7, you may have trouble with these slippers due to the back on the slipper.</li>
<li> but she had to take the stitching out of where you put your foot in because it was so tight and hard to put on.</li>
<li> She has small feet too</li>
<li> And if they are a gift, I would suggest ordering at least 2 months ahead of time.</li>
<li> When I got it, it was already broken inside..</li>
<li> Poor quality..</li>
<li> they look dirty!</li>
<li> I was very disappointed in them.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;m a size 7-71/2 in women&#x27;s shoes and these slippers fit me perfectly! I love them :)</li>
    <li> They were so cute and fluffy and warm! Compared to other slippers I&#x27;ve had, the amount of padding was good. The slippers fit me perfectly and I&#x27;m a size 5 1/2 to 7 depending on the type of shoe and where the shoe is from (though most often for flat shoes a 5 1/2-6).

    <li> This slippers are super cuteeee!!!!!! You must buy it!!!!!!</li>
    <li> The slippers took a while to come but they are definitely worth the wait. They fit perfectly and are cute and comfortable. I really like these.</li>
    <li> bought them for my girlfriend and she loves them, she says they&#x27;re super comfy and adorable</li>
    <li> Super cute and cozy, I had to stretch the top part where your foot goes in when I first got them to get my foot in but after that they fit pretty perfect. The only thing is the bottom &amp;#34;sole&amp;#34; part seems a bit smaller than my foot, I can feel the edges of it on the bottom of my foot. Other than that they are great.</li>
    <li> High quality, soft, squishy, and comfortable. Fits size six (U.S) perfectly!</li>
    <li> It took too long to get it. Poor quality..When I got it, it was already broken inside.. take a look at the pic.</li>
    <li> Very cute. My GF loves them. Great seller, quick delivery. Very Happy</li>
    <li> adorable and fuzzy fast shipping thank you!</li>
    <li> thank you i find it super adorable &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> I got these as a gift and they r nice but she had to take the stitching out of where you put your foot in because it was so tight and hard to put on. She has small feet too so you might have to do the same.</li>
    <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  these slippers, best I&#x27;ve found in fact. Fits like a glove and I will definitely buy these again for gifts.</li>
    <li> Warm and soft. I like it.</li>
    <li> These panda slippers are super cute! Also warm and comfortable. They look exactly as they do in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BEWARE. I do believe these only come in one size. I normally wear a size 6.5 in Women&#x27;s US sizes and these are a near perfect fit! I think these slippers could fit a 5.5 up to maaaybe a 7. I do see what other reviewers are saying about the sole being a bit small and that I can kind of feel the edges of it. If that&#x27;s something that will bother you, make sure you will fit the size of these slippers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These did take FOREVER to come though. The projected arrival was already about one month after purchase and these guys came in more than two weeks late! I got worried and contacted the seller. They were very accommodating, and offered me a refund for my lost slippers. They even said that if my slippers ever arrived, to consider it a gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you want these babies just make sure you got the right foot size for whomever you are ordering for! And if they are a gift, I would suggest ordering at least 2 months ahead of time.</li>
    <li> Took quite awhile to get to me but these little slippers are comfortable and just too cute!</li>
    <li> supper comfy and the right size, i ordered this expecting to receive it in the middle of the month only to find that it has arrived earlier than expected.</li>
    <li> Its so cute. It fits me fine. Its warm too. Perfect for winter.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had them for a week or two and the panda heads are already ripping at the seams.</li>
    <li> They are so warm and comfy ! They also fit me perfect ! ♥</li>
    <li> they&#x27;re so adorable and soft! i think it&#x27;s worth the price!</li>
    <li> They are cute but really dissapointed bc they look dirty! It&#x27;s honestly really gross they don&#x27;t even look white they look gray! Ugh.</li>
    <li> These took a long time to come, as they were shipped directly from China. Also they are not adult size AT ALL. I was very disappointed in them. I will say they are cute though, and have given them to a friend for her young daughter,</li>
