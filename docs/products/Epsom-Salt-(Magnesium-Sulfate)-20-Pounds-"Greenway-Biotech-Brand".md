    <li> There was a hole in the bag - but this was a big bag and everything stayed in the box. This is such a cost effective way to purchase!&lt;br /&gt;perfect quality for soaking sore muscles in.&lt;br /&gt;I give a 5+ stars.</li>
    <li> This is a terrific buy if you like to use Epsom salts for a soak. Works great and much cheaper than buying in the grocery store.</li>
    <li> great for my plant-gardening and a soak in the tub</li>
    <li> I used this product daily.  Great buy with economical price!!</li>
    <li> No problems with the bag as others have had. I thought it was a great value and the Epsom Salts have been wonderful in baths. I&#x27;m looking forward to using them in the garden this season and trying the many other uses for them!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Epsom salt, but I do have to knock off a star for a couple reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Slow shipping, Probably because it shipped usps so it arrived 9 days after ordering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bag was ripped and leaked. They obviously knew this because they put scotch tape over the rip. Really scotch tape? Use duct tape or something that will hold. So even as I picked the box up off my doorstep, some salt fell out. Also made it a bit harder to transfer to smaller bags.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are wondering, 20lbs fills up 3 big large freezer bags.</li>
    <li> ABSOLUTELY......b/c I use it in my gardens every year and it&#x27;s nice to know that I can buy it in bulk.</li>
    <li> OTHER epsom salts eat my skin up, really sad because i need to use it, so i resort from one problem swelling to another problem drying out.....NOT WITH THIS ONE...GREAT STUFF WORTH THE PRICE. Until i bought this i didn&#x27;t know one Epsom could be more gentle to the skin than another, I&#x27;m guessing it is in where it comes from, maybe the processing, i just know this brand doesn&#x27;t eat me up like the typical drug store brands.....so happy!!!</li>
    <li> Liked the size for the therapy tub use. Economical.</li>
    <li> I really like having the Epsom Salt delivered right to my door!!! It sets next to the tub and we use it with each bath!</li>
    <li> Very fast delivery.  The epsom salt is contained in a very strong bag packed in a sturdy box.</li>
    <li> The first bag of 20 lb. Came and had a large hole in it. Was all over my porch.;-(.  The second one I just ordered 25 lbs. Came and was just fine.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  I&#x27;ll be purchasing again in the future.</li>
    <li> why cant i set up a subscription? i need this sent to me every month</li>
    <li> Comes in a very big envelope (nice lined sort) which I had trouble re-sealing due to the 20 lbs of salt inside....got a large Rubbermaid cereal type container for it that keeps it dry and accessible beside the tub and that has been working out great.  Will buy again!</li>
    <li> LOVE IT !  GREAT PRICE ! VERY HAPPY ALL AROUND !  VERY HEALING &amp; SOOTHING TO THE SOUL... ENJOY !</li>
    <li> I use for bath with some baking soda.</li>
    <li> it is helping my husband with the edema in his legs; swelling down and discolaration almost gone. really great.  also works on other health and household needs.</li>
