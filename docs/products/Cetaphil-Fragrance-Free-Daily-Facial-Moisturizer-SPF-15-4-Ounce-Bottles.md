      <li>I have recommended this moisturizer to many people and will continue to do so, and will continue to purchase this product.</li>
      <li>Rubs in nicely and is ideal for daily use or under-makeup use.</li>
      <li>I HAVE USED THIS PRODUCT FOR MANY YEARS.  </li>

      <li>I&#x27;m not allergic to anything so, foolishly, I thought maybe I just needed to acclimate to it and continued using it for 2 more weeks.</li>
      <li>Best face lotion ever for daily use!</li>
      <li>so I have to remove the top, hold it upside-down, and shake it, to get the remaining bit out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t need more than 3/4 of a pump to cover my face.</li>
      <li>My dermatologist told me it&#x27;s the best for my skin and seems to be proving that with several years&#x27; use.</li>
      <li>I love this face moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I love the spf 15 factor.  </li>

      <li>At first I thought this felt good on my skin</li>
      <li>, I think it could be perfect for oily, dry, or combo skin types.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not the best moisturizer in the world but it absorbs quickly and is reasonably priced for a mild sunscreen product.</li>
      <li>Keeps my skin clean and healthy, can&#x27;t ask for much more than that from moisturizer.</li>
      <li>It is priced very reasonable and I have been very pleased with the results.  </li>
      <li>have been using this for ages, great for sensitive skin</li>
      <li>It is lightweight so it doesn&#x27;t make your skin oily or greasy - and it is very kind to sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>soft n smooth and feeling great</li>
      <li>(the firey, itchy, bright red kind of rash).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>It has kept my skin moisturized and even worked my fine lines well.  </li>

      <li>It came very quickly and it&#x27;s the same great product</li>
      <li>It very much feels like there is a rose-scented air freshener attached to my nose!!</li>
      <li>Cetaphil feels very balanced and light while managing to be quite effective.</li>
      <li>The advertising on the bottle says &amp;#34;non-greasy formula that won&#x27;t clog pores&amp;#34; but that did not prove accurate for me.</li>
      <li>This company is recommended by my dermatologist and is fragrance free.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have been using this lotion for a few years now. Its not oily but it moisturizes very well. I use it twice a day, once before I apply my makeup and again after I wash my face at night.</li>
    <li> Generally, I find Cetaphil products to be better than other brands because it has less ingredients that cause problems for my skin, and my family&#x27;s skin.  I use this every day.  For the price, it&#x27;s great, it does what it needs to do, and has built in sun screen so I don&#x27;t shrivel up and get all wrinkly before I&#x27;m supposed to.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the Cetaphil line of products.  It was recommended to me by my dermatologist after I had an allergic reaction to cosmetics.  I have been using it for about 3-4 years and love it  This moisturizer is great.  I love the spf 15 factor.  I use it daily and am very pleased.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is great on my skin. Not too waterey but not too thick...very happy with this product especially since it has a SPF of 15</li>
    <li> This product does not do such a great job of moisturizing your face. After using it for a week, I didn&#x27;t feel like my skin was really benefitting from it.    But worse: it makes my eyes burn.</li>
    <li> I went to the dermatologist for help with my very dry and very sensitive skin. My dermatologist recommended that I no longer exfoliate due to the sensitivity and try Cetaphil. I&#x27;d heard of it before but never wanted to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;ve been using Cetaphil for only a week, and my skin is radiant! My pores are tiny, my t-zone is no longer flaking, I have no more random annoying whiteheads, and my face is absolutely glowing. Even my boyfriend has commented on my newly supple complexion!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product also doesn&#x27;t leave my skin looking/feeling oily later on, even in the morning after I wake up. Cetaphil feels very balanced and light while managing to be quite effective. I also like that it is fragrance free -- I do not need the added ingredient on my sensitive face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ~highly~ recommend this product if you&#x27;re still looking for one that works. Wow, what a difference! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(For posterity&#x27;s sake: I wash with just water in the morning, pat dry, and apply a pump to a pump and a half of the moisturizer to my face and neck. Skin does not feel tight with an adequate amount of moisturizer! In the evening, I use the facial cleanser, my Alba Hibiscus toner, and finish with the moisturizer.)</li>
    <li> This is good stuff. It doesn&#x27;t leave that white residue in my stubble that so many other sunscreen/moisturisers do. It absorbs quickly, and isn&#x27;t very greasy. I bought this product after seeing it recommended on several websites for oily skin (which I have). All in all, a good product!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin.  And there have been so many products that claim to not block pores and actually do.&lt;br /&gt;This has been the best so far in actually doing what it claims to do.</li>
    <li> I needed a facial moisturizer with SPF and UVA/UVB protection. Cetaphil&#x27;s a good brand so I picked it up. It works as a moisturizer but goes on a little greasy and takes a while to absorb, so I have to wait before I put my make up on. I&#x27;m not sure about SPF-- I&#x27;ve only been using it during the winter and haven&#x27;t been outside too much, but it&#x27;s generally fine. I&#x27;ve had luck with this, it hasn&#x27;t made me break out. A little goes a long way! I don&#x27;t need more than 3/4 of a pump to cover my face. I like the fact that it has a twist lock.  However, after 4-6 hours it slips down my face and burns my eyes for a good twenty minutes. I can&#x27;t blink without it stinging. Definitely not buying this again; certainly not worth the pain.</li>
    <li> This product has a horrible chemical smell and when it dries it is sticky and stringy like mucous. It feels like paint on my face in the morning. It doesn&#x27;t breath and cakes my make up. I am looking for a better product.</li>
    <li> In the winter when my face is extra dry, this is great.  But in the summer, it breaks me out and it makes me feel even hotter.</li>
    <li> I bought the Cetaphil facial cleanser and moisturizer and I can&#x27;t believe how healthy my skin feels.    I&#x27;m not sure why but the moisturizer causes my face to tingle or \\&quot;burn\\&quot; directly after using. I have never had this type of reaction from a moisturizer before, and although the burning lasts for only a few minutes I&#x27;m not sure if I should continue to use this product.    I would suggest finding a way to sample this product before buying it.</li>
    <li> for my dry and sensitive skin...it stings and burns when i apply ...i tried it for few days, the stinging and burning decreased but i got acne with it...(though i didnt have one before using it)</li>
    <li> I was looking for a daily moisturizer, something with a low sheen or matte-like tone. I was dead wrong with this. This leaves your face greasy, shiny, and worse, sticky.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Cetaphil Fragrance Free Daily Facial Moisturizer for over 5 years.  My skin is sensitive and dry.  I use it everyday, even during summer.  Other reviewers have said that it is greasy, but I have not experienced that.  After application, I wait at least 10 minutes before putting on make-up.  Maybe that would help.  This is a really great face moisturizer.  I love the fact that it has SPF 15 in it, because  I am very fair.  It isn&#x27;t waterproof, so don&#x27;t use this in place of sunblock when going outdoors for an extended length of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that it does not come with a small plastic lid.  I never forget to take this moisturizer with me when going out of town and some of the time it pumps in my bag. (Pack it in a baggie!)  It does have a locking feature, where you turn the pump to the side so it doesn&#x27;t squirt, but when bumping around in my travel bag, it tends to knock back in to pump mode.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a sunscreen without the typical sunscreen smell. Other SPF products (even from Cetaphil) that say &amp;#34;fragrance free&amp;#34; still smell like sunscreen. This does not smell like sunscreen! It does have a light scent - something like pepper sprinkled on a flower - but it fades quickly so you won&#x27;t be smelling it all day.</li>
    <li> I use this at the recommendation of my dermatologist.  I like that it has SPF 15 and protects my skin.  My skin seems to be dry in certain spots and this isn&#x27;t quite enough of a moisturizer for those areas.  Otherwise, I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> BURNT MY SKIN! I love this brand and bought it because I thought all cetaphil products were great, this was not.</li>
    <li> Great product. I break out often. This helps moisturize without clogging pores.</li>
    <li> I have ridiculously sensitive skin.  I break out in a rash if something too smelly or acidic gets near my face (the firey, itchy, bright red kind of rash).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as oily or dry skin, I am in the middle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for 10+ years and will probably use it the rest of my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never felt like it left my face oily. And yes - if it gets in your eyes it will sting (but not any worse than say...getting sunscreen in your eyes), so don&#x27;t get it in your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use Cetaphil&#x27;s Gentle Skin Cleanser to wash my face in the morning, and the two of these products combined are the extent of my skin care routine.</li>
    <li> The Cetaphil brand is what my skin doctor recommended and I use this for my face.  Its great!</li>
    <li> I ordered this particular moisturizer because it scored relatively low in terms of dangerous ingredients at[...]. While it feels nice on my face, I have learned to apply it very carefully. God forbid you just slather it on because if any happens to get on your lips the taste is disgusting and very chemical-like. And please don&#x27;t rub your eyes because your they will burn and water so much you&#x27;ll swear you&#x27;re about to go blind.    Somehow I&#x27;m going to give this three stars since I suppose it does do what it is intended to do, but it&#x27;s not quite as \\&quot;free and clear\\&quot; as I was imagining a Cetaphil product to be.</li>
    <li> I could not find the usual Cetaphil jar that I use, so I got this. It worked just as well, but I did not like the feeling and I just couldn&#x27;t get over the smell! If you don&#x27;t want to use sunscreen, this is a good alternative, but I wouldn&#x27;t use it on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> This product works great on a daily basis to moisturize my face while not making it all oily. I&#x27;m to the point that I have to put it on after a shower or my face feels so dry</li>
    <li> I thought I&#x27;d try something different since I LOVE Cetaphil&#x27;s bar soap, but this facial lotion is just too greasy for my sensitive skin.  I went back to Oil of Olay, which is very light and non-greasy.</li>
    <li> I have dry skin, and I&#x27;ve struggled with finding a moisturizer for my face that was very hydrating but not too greasy. This product is great!! I don&#x27;t have dry flaky skin any more. It absorbs fast and really helps my make-up go on smoothly. I like that it also has some SPF as well.</li>
    <li> Good deal on these two for one cetaphil. My girl uses this daily so when I saw a this deal I just had to get it for her.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for awhile now.  My complexion has become clearer from this lotion. I love  that it has an spf 15 in it. My skincare regimen: I usually wake up and   rinse my face with cold water, then I apply this lotion, wait a little while..  apply primer, then makeup and voila! perfect skin.   I also used to use this at night, but I switched to neutrogena&#x27;s tone  correcting night serum. Great daily facial lotion. It most likely will give your face a glow to it.  Very moisturizing.</li>
    <li> At first I thought this felt good on my skin but after a while I noticed an off chermical smell and then a bad taste in my mouth.  I believe it probably is from the added sunscreen.  I will not repurchase.</li>
    <li> wonderful product especially with the built in SPF great skin protector and moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;leaves skin soft n smooth and feeling great</li>
    <li> Used in the morning before the work and gets greasy by noon. And you have to clean your face with wet tissue or wash your face...</li>
    <li> I tried this moisturizer thinking I could go a little cheaper then the one I normally use. However, I used this stuff twice and it made my skin feel like there was a film on it. My skin is very sensitive and it made my face break out like a teenager. Definately will not be using again...</li>
    <li> This does indeed moisturize very nicely. Unfortunately it is the only good thing about this product. It&#x27;s rosey-like smell sticks around for HOURS after applying it. Fragrance-free my butt. It very much feels like there is a rose-scented air freshener attached to my nose!! It&#x27;s absolutely HORRIBLE and very, very strong. I see that others have complained about the chemical smell, too. To me, the closest thing akin to it are roses. &lt;shrugs&gt; Secondly, no matter how carefully I try to avoid my eyes at all costs (I stay clear of the hollow and just apply right below the cheekbone) it somehow makes it&#x27;s way up there, burns the crap out of my temples, and makes my eyes water till the end of time. NOT WORTH IT. Will have to keep looking. Sorely disappointed. :(</li>
    <li> For years I had read and heard that cetaphil is supposed to be good for sensitive skin, so I was excited to try it. However, when I tried it I immediately had a burning sensation. I&#x27;m not allergic to anything so, foolishly, I thought maybe I just needed to acclimate to it and continued using it for 2 more weeks. My skin is now peeling and dry. I will never try this again.</li>
    <li> I used to use department store moisturizers that were pricey - upwards of $50 for anywhere between 1oz - 3oz bottles. But I still broke out and where my skin was oily. Devastated and at my wits end, brought in the products I was using and I asked my dermatologist what he recommened. Suprisingly, her recommended Cetaphil! I was shocked at the price and even more so at how my skin reacted to this wonderful, combination skin moisturizer. It kept my dry areas nicely moisturized while balancing out my oily t-zone areas. It also has SPF 15 - which is a plus (however, I do recommend using a SPF 30 if going out in the sun ... my foundation provides this so I just layer it over the Cetaphil). I am thankful that I have finally found a good hydrating lotion (especially for this rock bottom price ... you can&#x27;t beat it). I&#x27;d pay 10x as much as still be satisfied!</li>
    <li> For some reason this moisturizer burns my skin. I don&#x27;t have this problem with other moisturizers with spf, but sometimes using cheap sunscreen makes my face burn in the same way. I think that&#x27;s probably what&#x27;s going on here. Too bad, I love other cetaphil products!</li>
    <li> I have a friend who grew up nearly in a bubble; as a child, he was allergic to nearly everything. His mom bathed him in Cetaphil products. I use the Cetaphil cleanser and lotion, and have added this facial moisturizer to my repertoire. It&#x27;s light, non-greasy, and absorbs quickly. Fragrance-free, too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a year. I switched to it at the same time I started using the Cetaphil cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;--Absorbs well: Doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling or sheen&lt;br /&gt;--Moisturizes well&lt;br /&gt;--Gentle: Does not cause stinging or reddening of the skin&lt;br /&gt;--Does not cause acne&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;--Stings the eyes badly. I could use my previous moisturizer on the eyes no problem, but the first few times I used this one I might rub my eyes right after applying and be very sorry! It stings like crazy and made me cry. Now I&#x27;m just more careful to not go all the way to the edge of the eyelid, and I let it soak in before rubbing my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;--Tastes terrible. The couple of times I&#x27;ve accidentally gotten it on my lips during application and then licked my lips, it tasted like I was wearing metallic tasting lipgloss. Again, I&#x27;m just more careful now about keeping it off my lips when I&#x27;m applying to my chin and upper lip area.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and get acne and dry red patches from most moisturizers.  Cetaphil is the only moisturizer I&#x27;ve found that works well for me.  It&#x27;s non-greasy and absorbs quickly.  It doesn&#x27;t leave me looking shiny, and I don&#x27;t feel like I need to wear any concealer or foundation when I use this daily.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re like me you have those facial products that are under the sink and those that are on the sink. On the sink means you use it every single day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dad had melanoma and I&#x27;m ultra careful. I was raised in the desert and burned, burned, burned. I&#x27;m a pro photographer  and on the days that I go on a shoot I add more SPF, but first in the morning EVERY am this goes on. My skin is very sensitive, in fact, I have rosacea, so this goes over the medication for that. I&#x27;m not changing my facial moisturizer to another brand.</li>
    <li> I have been using Cetaphil products for 6 years. It was recommended by my dermatologist during my treatment of accutane and also for my newborn that was suffering from atopic dermatitis/eczema. I use the gentle cleanser for my face and follow up with the moisturizing lotion. The only reason I purchased this lotion is because I find the regular moisturizing lotion to be too greasy for under my makeup in the morning. This face lotion is so much better! I only use a small amount and it is absorbed quickly and non greasy. I didn&#x27;t have any burning of the face or eyes like other people stated, maybe because I am used to the product line? I still use the regular moisturizing lotion at night however for extra moisture. By the way, I&#x27;m 30 with combination skin. Oily t-zone and dry lower cheeks.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s non-greasy, applies easily.  SPF is only 15 but really does a nice job and lasts quite a while in the sun.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years, as per recommendation.  I have very sensitive skin and this works well.  I like the weight and SPF, and it absorbs quickly for morning routine.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great - maybe the best out there.  I&#x27;ve tried a variety of moisturizers for my face and many leave you greasy or are too harsh.  This does not.</li>
    <li> I have dry skin, so this moisturizer works well for me.  It glides on and is absorbed quickly. I only like a moisturizer that works with my Estee Lauder Lucidity makeup.  Many other moisturizers that I&#x27;ve tried make my makeup sit on my skin and in my pores. Not a pretty sight.  I give it a 4 star rating, because it does sting the eyes.  I use an eye cream for that instead.</li>
    <li> I like this product - price is right and I use it as a moisturizer and sun screen for my morning walk. Probably spending a lot more money would give you a better experience but this is good enough for me anyhow.</li>
    <li> I use this lotion on my kids faces in the summer. It has SPF and it good for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> My doc recommended this to me to use in the mornings after I wash my face. Unfortunately, there was nothing good about it! It smells like chemicals, it leaves a horrible greasy film that takes forever to soak in (I would avoid putting it on my cheeks when I could, I brush bronzer on in the mornings and I don&#x27;t have three hours to let this stuff dry!) and, worst of all, it BURNS! It wasn&#x27;t so bad at first, but after a few days to a week of using this moisturizer, my face was on fire. I still have no idea why-- I don&#x27;t have sensitive or dry skin or anything, but boy did this stuff hurt! So I switched to the Nivea cream and have been happy ever since :)</li>
    <li> I had some skin problems and my Dermatologist recommended this.  I had never heard of it before. It is priced very reasonable and I have been very pleased with the results.  Would recommend to others and will definitely re-order!</li>
    <li> This is one of the only moisturizers I&#x27;ve ever found for my rosacea-prone, contact dermatitis-prone skin.  However, in researching several personal care items for gluten, I came across an e-mail sent by someone asking about celiac.  The response from Galderma indicated that this is not gluten-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t gluten-free.  (If you have celiac or gluten-sensitivity, this is one of the items that probably should be gluten-free, because you might accidentally ingest it while flossing or preparing food.) So, if gluten is an issue, don&#x27;t buy it. That&#x27;s so sad.  I&#x27;m off to toss mine in the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Ironically, much cheaper things like Suave lotions, are, or will tell you they&#x27;re not.)</li>
    <li> My wife swears by this stuff. She uses it to keep her skin moist but not oily before applying makeup. It also keeps her skin from getting wind-burned by our chilly Chicago winters. I always think she looks fantastic regardless of what lotion she uses, but she says this one is the best, and I&#x27;ll take her word for it.</li>
    <li> I honestly do not believe that these glowing reviews are from real people... To echo what other reviews have been saying: 1. This \\&quot;fragrance free\\&quot; moisturizer smells horrible. It leaves a very synthetic, plastic smell that sticks around on your hands and face for hours. 2. It takes forever to absorb. Leaves a shiny residue after applying which is something you do not want under makeup. Makes my face looks greasy and caused me to break out. 3. I would not say this is a lightweight moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would someone please recommend something else? I live in a very cold place and my skin is yearning for hydration...</li>
    <li> Have used this for years, great product, still wrinkle free (knock on wood!).</li>
    <li> I was having a lot of skin issues until I started using Cetephil exclusively on the advice of a dermatologist.  I also like that it has SPF and does not have a smell (my husband has a sensitive nose).</li>
    <li> I love this product and have used it for years, but I hate the packaging. It is impossible to get the last bit out of the bottle. After cutting it open with scissors and scooping the leftovers out into a plastic cup, I weighed it on a digital scale. After subtracting the weight of the cup, there was over 1/2 ounce of cream in there - .60 ounces to be exact. That&#x27;s 1/8th of the total product that would otherwise be wasted. I have put up with this for years but am switching now to an Aveeno product with a newer pump style that allows you get out every last drop.</li>
    <li> I tried this for the first time and love it.  I have sensitive skin especially on my face and tried this because I use the Cetaphil moisturizing lotion and have no problem with it.  This also has sunscreen and I apply under my makeup giving me double protection.</li>
    <li> Nice, light feel, doesn&#x27;t contain Oxybenzone, and a good price, but beware if you put it on your neck or anywhere else that touches your clothes, because once it mixes with your skin oils, it stains horribly and won&#x27;t wash out. Ruined several white/light shirts &#x27;til I realized the connection! Now I&#x27;m stuck with 2 bottles of the stuff. :(</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Fast shipping</li>
    <li> If you live in a hot climate or are going to do any sort of strenuous activity, you probably don&#x27;t want to use this as it burns very badly when it runs in your eyes from sweating. I found it to be greasy on my skin, but I expect that from any moisturizer that has sunscreen. On the plus side, it didn&#x27;t make my skin burn like some other products have.</li>
    <li> I was hoping it was just a weird adjustment phase or maybe I wasn&#x27;t putting enough of it on. Unfortunately, it got to the point of a weeks use with super dry skin (flaking) and just burning. Waste of money and wish I could get my refund. Also bought their whole line of products with the thought that it was for all types of skin. The facial wash produces the same result...</li>
    <li> I love this because my sensitive skin does not react and because i NEVER sunburn. It has 15 spf in it, but as long as I am in the sun only for a couple of hours, this always is sufficient for me.</li>
    <li> recommended by my doctor - I have very sensitive skin and other moisturizers caused burning. This is gentle, and smooths easily over the skin - and SPF15.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is wonderful for sensitive skin like mine.  Cetaphil has great products, and this double pack is a great value!</li>
    <li> I picked this up at the end of April before I left for vacation. I had just had a stern talking to by my dermatologist about using sunscreen this summer – even when I was only spending 10-15 minutes outside. And since I hate using a heavy sunscreen on my face, I went with a moisturizer instead. Cetaphil has been around for a long time, and though I’ve used the cleanser, I haven’t delved into their moisturizer options much.  I’m a wimp when it comes to paying full price for a moisturizer I have never used, because my skin is so picky. It can be really oily and dry and flakey at the same time. Urg! The last moisturizer I used left me annoyed, but this one was perfect for my skin. It gives moisture to my dry spots but doesn’t make me shiny. I’m in love! 😀&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging claims it can be used “for all skin types” and I agree, I think it could be perfect for oily, dry, or combo skin types. I also enjoy how small amount of product you need. It may only be 4 oz. for a regular sized bottle, but a bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer for oily acne-prone skin. Even though my skin is oily, I still need to moisturize. If I don&#x27;t moisturize, my skin becomes oilier at the end of the day. Not too much of a scent. Other facial moisturizers with SPF tend to make my skin look white. This moisturizer blends in with your skin color.</li>
    <li> Been using this for years, doesn&#x27;t hurt my skin like many other products, doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts or redness for me. Everyone&#x27;s skin is different, so find what works for you. I definitely recommend this product for a daily moisturizer and sunscreen.</li>
    <li> Very easy to apply. Seems to work.</li>
    <li> Really like this stuff, however, once you get wet (was at the lake) and this stuff gets in your eyes it burns!</li>
    <li> This stuff was recommended by my dermatologist and she was right...you don&#x27;t break out with it...why buy the expensive stuff from Nordstrom when this works just as good and is a fraction of the cost!</li>
    <li> Though I would never pay $20 ^ for it (they are charging way too much), this is a great moisturizer. You can get this product from $9 - $11 at a drug store or other online sites.     I have acne prone skin.. I usually use neautrogena face wash with this moisturizer.. and I my acne has improved soo much since I began to use these. Especially this moisterizer.. it is very light and non greasy.  I even get a bit dry skin during winter months and this helps for that as well.</li>
    <li> This is the one facial moisturizer that is very light and none greasy, not to mention unscented.  I have been using it for a number of years and quite happy with it.  Hope you like it as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had extremely dry skin all of my life.  And, as a kid, I spent a lot of time in the sun with no sun protection on and as a result I have pretty badly damaged skin.  So I need something that not only moisturizes my skin, but also protects it from the sun (even &amp;#34;casual&amp;#34; sun, such as coming through a car window on the drive to work).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the years, I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different products, with varying degrees of success.  Cetaphil, with SPF, was recommended to me both by my Dermatologist and by a friend who is also a Dermatologist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, this product has been the best available option yet.  It gets rid of the visible dryness on my face, and soothes areas that can get very itchy due to dryness.  It also doesn&#x27;t make my skin look oily when I initially put it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only three gripes I have: (i) my skin can start to look greasy later in the day (particularly if it is warm out or if I had to put on more of this product than usual), (ii) I&#x27;ve noticed that my eyes can sometimes start to burn from (I think) this product getting in them a bit during the day, (iii) the way this bottle works, there can often be 5%-10% left that the dispensing system can make available - so I have to remove the top, hold it upside-down, and shake it, to get the remaining bit out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those issues (with the possible exception of the third) have been at least as bad with other products that I&#x27;ve tried.  So although I&#x27;m only giving this 4 stars, there is no competing product that I would give more than 3 stars at this time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
    <li> have been using this for ages, great for sensitive skin that&#x27;s prone to breakouts. cetaphil moisturizer was recommended by my dermatologist and out of all the products i&#x27;ve tried over the years it&#x27;s still the one that is gentlest to my skin.</li>
    <li> I use the 15 spf in the winter and the 50 spf in summer. The container discharges just the right amount for face in one pump so it lasts a long time. Creamy with no oily feel left behind. Love it!</li>
    <li> This non-greasy moisturizer is like spreading melted butter on your skin. I bet when they decided to add \\&quot;non-greasy\\&quot; to the box and angel lost its wings and then died. This is about as greasy as it comes. As far as moisturizing... not really. there are far better products out there.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this product because I absolutely LOVE Cetaphil&#x27;s daily facial cleanser. I have sensitive skin, and the cleanser is magic.    Unfortunately, I found this product to be far too oily for me. Based on other reviews, I suspect it works better for people with very dry skin. For me, when I was wearing it, it felt to oily. After I washed my face, the oily feeling remained. Most problematic, this product gave me small breakouts all over my face, and I had very clear skin while using my previous moisturizers (Clinique Dramatically Different and Youth Surge SPF 15; trying to find a less expensive alternative). For me, the hunt for the perfect moisturizer (that I can afford) will have to continue.</li>
    <li> This is great face lotion and getting a two pack is amazing.  Great to have sunscreen everyday and without the odor.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist told me to switch to this brand. I was skeptical that it would be moisturizing enough because I have very dry (but also very sensitive) skin. Not only does it do a fantastic job, but it&#x27;s easy on my skin.</li>
    <li> Supposed to be recommended by dermatologists, however, this caused my combination skin to break out in acne. The advertising on the bottle says &amp;#34;non-greasy formula that won&#x27;t clog pores&amp;#34; but that did not prove accurate for me. I have an oily T-zone and dry cheeks/jawline. It made part of all areas of my face break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little heavy for a moisturizer. You can definitely feel the sunscreen in it. I&#x27;ve used other similar facial moisturizers, so I know that often you can feel when there is sunscreen. But I&#x27;ve used a couple with sunscreen that felt a little lighter.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by my dermatologist.  It is a wonderful moisturizer.  It leaves my skin feeling fresh and never a heavy greasy feeling.</li>
    <li> It is a light-weight lotion that doesn&#x27;t make your skin feel greasy. However, it seems to burn slightly the longer it&#x27;s on your skin and it STINKS like bug spray! There&#x27;s no way I want a lotion that makes me feel like I sprayed myself in the face with bug killer. It makes me wonder what&#x27;s in it, too. Give this one a pass. If you want a good face lotion for sensitive skin, try Trader Joe&#x27;s store brand face lotion.</li>
    <li> Have been using it for years.  Non-greasy and good natural product...spf15 too!&lt;br /&gt;Put it on in the morning and forget about it!</li>
    <li> The product is fantastic but I am more impressed with the prompt delivery! Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer for several years and have re-ordered it several times. This is a light, non-greasy moisturizer that also has some sunscreen capabilities to protect your skin. The only thing I dislike about it is that if it gets in your eyes, it does sting quite a bit! I&#x27;ve gotten used to applying it carefully to avoid the eye area and then it works great.</li>
    <li> This product is a staple item for me. This is the perfect moisturizer. It leaves my skin moisturized, but never oily. It does not clog my pores and never leads to break-outs like many of the other moisturizers I have used. I couldn&#x27;t speak highly enough for this product and never plan to switch to another moisturizer.</li>
    <li> To start, I love the Cetaphil daily facial cleanser and use it on a regular basis.  I have sensitive skin, and am prone to reactions to new lotions.  So, I was looking for a face moisturizer, and decided to try this since I have had such a good experience with the cleanser.  I am very disappointed with this product.  (1) it left a somewhat greasy feeling on my skin.  (2) the second day I used it, I was left with a mild burning sensation in my skin for a few seconds after application; (3) Now, for the past two days since the second (and last) application, my face is completely chapped and dry.  Perhaps this is a good product for some, but if you have sensitive skin, this does not live up the expectations I had from Cetaphil&#x27;s other products and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not the best moisturizer in the world but it absorbs quickly and is reasonably priced for a mild sunscreen product.</li>
    <li> Used this for almost 15 years now. Love it!!</li>
    <li> My wife loves this stuff.  As it is sometimes hard to find in stores, it is very convenient being able to buy it through amazon.</li>
    <li> The very first time I tried this product, I applied it to my face and experienced an immediate strong burning sensation which stopped only when I (hastily) cleaned the lotion off. I&#x27;ve been using Cetaphil cleanser for decades and love it, but the moisturizer is definitely not for me.</li>
    <li> I bought this online because I kept going to the local store and it was not in stock. After three or four attempts at that, I looked it up here on Amazon and ordered it through them. It came very quickly and it&#x27;s the same great product I&#x27;m accustomed to using. My dermatologist told me it&#x27;s the best for my skin and seems to be proving that with several years&#x27; use. I&#x27;ll be ordering it again. It has no perfumes, just so you know.</li>
    <li> A truly great product! It&#x27;s the only face moisturizer I have found that hydrates my skin well but doesn&#x27;t clog pores.</li>
    <li> This is definitely not for sensitive skin. My skin isn&#x27;t all that sensitive but it broke me out in these, red, almost chapped patches. I tried this because it&#x27;s what my dad uses, I usually just use the regular Cetaphil cleanser &amp; lotion. Ow, my face hurts!</li>
    <li> Cannot get this in Australia only in tube .it is really light and not greasy .also has great sun protection</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several years and am more than satisfied.  I have recommended this moisturizer to many people and will continue to do so, and will continue to purchase this product.</li>
    <li> Best moisturizer  and reasonable. too. I have been using it for years. It doesn&#x27;t matter if you are young or old.</li>
    <li> This was also recommended by my facialist . I have dehydrated fair skin and wanted something that had spf in it. Thank goodness this has spf 40. Love the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
    <li> The product is advertised as \\&quot;lightweight\\&quot; and \\&quot;free of fragrances.\\&quot; Yet upon application, I found it to be heavy, difficult to absorb, and worst of all, have a foul smell.  Some of the other reviewers have commented that this moisturizer smells awful - this is undoubtedly true. The smell can roughly be likened to a combination of insecticide and burnt rubber/plastic.  I cannot recommend this product at all, despite the Cetaphil brand.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion daily for close to 10 years.  I know many said they find it greasy and I couldn&#x27;t agree less.  I find this much more of a water base lotion that dries nicely on the skin.  It can burn when you put it on if your face is still wet after cleaning it with cleanser.  To avoid this let your skin dry then apply the lotion-then it won&#x27;t burn.  Also it depends on what you cleaned your skin with before applying the lotion.  The SPF 15 works well, if I&#x27;m outside all day sometimes I reapply.  For a lower priced lotion I think this works great.</li>
    <li> Great product and have used this for quite some time. I was told by a dermatologist that you don&#x27;t need to spend a lot of money on moisturizers.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to everyone who wants it. Really worked in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I also would recommend this store, really good job.</li>
    <li> no perfumes or artificial colors. great, non greasy , great for under makeup. great dispenser, no worries about contaminating the whole container because of the pre measured pump.</li>
    <li> I have tried a variety of SPF moisturizers - from the expensive to the not-so-expensive - and this is the best I have found.  It is lightweight so it doesn&#x27;t make your skin oily or greasy - and it is very kind to sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product throughout my 20&#x27;s and now into my 30&#x27;s.  I like the fact it is fragrance and dye free.  It really moisturizes well and lasts all day.  I have very sensitive skin and this product does not irritate like some of the department store brands can.  It seems very gentle.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> A great and gentle moisturrizer with the necessary SPF.&lt;br /&gt;All things Cetaphil are wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t hesitate to purchase this one.</li>
    <li> Cetaphil is a great product. They don&#x27;t license to generics, so it&#x27;s expensive, but the knock-offs are nowhere near as good. Also, the more popular versions of Cetaphil (gentle face wash for normal skin and this moisturizer) are often out of stock at Targets and Walmart. I&#x27;ve found ordering from Amazon the best way to buy the Cetaphil products that I like.</li>
    <li> I have always had problem skin. It is delicate, oily, acne prone.. sounds lovely right? I was looking for something that was not water proof that would be light and not irritate whatever unimaginable variety of things might be contributing to my skin breaking out...and give enough sun protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this sun screen after cleansing with grandma&#x27;s acne bar (natural soap) followed by cleansing with raw unpasteurized apple cider vinegar &amp;#34;with the mother&amp;#34;, using the vinegar also as a toner too, and I have never in all my life of dealing with problem skin, had my skin in such good condition.  So I think it is the combination of these products but I would not be without any of them. This is a great sunscreen, probably because of what it does *not* contain...It just seems light, basic moisturizing, it just feels like a light lotion and washes off well using these cleansers.</li>
    <li> I recently switched to Cetaphil from Clinique&#x27;s Dramatically Different lotion, and I will never go back! I am in my twenty&#x27;s so my skin is beyond that awkward teen stage but not yet at the point where I am using any thing to stop or lessen wrinkles. Since the switch, my pores don&#x27;t feel as clogged, I hardly ever break out, and the SPF is in the lotion so I don&#x27;t even have to think about if my face is protected from the sun! Plus it&#x27;s more affordable! And in this economy getting a great product at a great price is crucial!</li>
    <li> I HAVE USED THIS PRODUCT FOR MANY YEARS.  MY SKIN IS VERY SENSITIVE AND I HAVE HAD NO BREAKOUTS FROM THIS.  I ALSO LIKE THAT IT HAS AN SPF 15.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is perfect. I started using it while I was a teenager, constantly using medicated creams and what not to prevent breakouts dried out my skin, and the cetaphil lotion offers the best non-clogging, non greasy, and a little hint of SPF (which is needed due to the sun sensitivity with medications for acne) along with no fragrance. The bottle design is also great in that you only get a small amount each pump.</li>
    <li> Great price and product</li>
    <li> Keeps my skin clean and healthy, can&#x27;t ask for much more than that from moisturizer. Very good product, highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Best face lotion ever for daily use! Not thick or greasy. Rubs in nicely and is ideal for daily use or under-makeup use.</li>
    <li> Perfect for dry and sensitive skin.  I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love this face moisturizer. It moisturizes dry skin without exacerbating issues with oily skin, and even protects you from the sun! Works well under makeup. A+.</li>
    <li> I reeeally don&#x27;t like this moisturizer, i bought it because they quit making the one i&#x27;ve been using for the past 10 years &amp; this one seemed to have similar attributes... well, i was wrong. it smells like medicated ointment, feels super greasy, took forever to rub/soak in &amp; (i put it on after a shower, without scrubbing my face or anything, just a damp face) it burned when i put it on, leaving my face red for about an hour. tried it for 3 days just in case -- same thing every day. will not be using the rest... i&#x27;ll put it in the guest bathroom i guess. what a waste of money :C back on the hunt for a good moisturizer!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this facial moisturizer for years—probably since high school. I&#x27;ve had bad acne on and off for over 10 years, and this is one of few moisturizers that doesn&#x27;t upset my sensitive, fair skin. I also like the feel, I like that it&#x27;s generally unscented, and I like the bottle design A LOT. The bottle is great for travel because the nozzle has locking feature that some bottles/brands just don&#x27;t have. I&#x27;ve put these poor things through a lot of abuse between flying, road trips, and camping/backpacking trips (yes, I take the full bottle camping and backpacking—you gotta do what you gotta do), and they have never popped open or leaked so long as I lock the nozzle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reasons I gave it 4 out of 5 stars are these:&lt;br /&gt;- I wish it had slightly higher SPF for us pale people out there&lt;br /&gt;- I wish it went on a little more matte. It&#x27;s not glossy exactly, but it takes a bit for it to soak into your skin.</li>
    <li> Great product! Also purchased some for my sister.</li>
    <li> This lotion is very nice for your face on when going outside. It stings a little bit when applying after shaving. I guess anything with sunscreen in it might sting if applied after shaving.</li>
    <li> Been using this for almost 3 years now with acneprone combination skin that&#x27;s ULTRA sensitve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. it can burn when you put it on if you&#x27;re sweating/hot&lt;br /&gt;2. Doesn&#x27;t make me break out or clog my pores.&lt;br /&gt;3. Doesn&#x27;t smell&lt;br /&gt;4. Moisturizes me! But sometimes it can make me feel shiny.</li>
    <li> The best sunscreen for my very senstaive skin. Everything I had tried previously left my skin red and stinging. This goes on nicely, leaving my skin moisturized but not greasy.</li>
    <li> This is a good moisturizer if you want one with an spf and no perfumes. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few years and it is light and seems to work well. My dermotologist just recommended I change to a lotion with spf 30 so I&#x27;ll be looking into some others but this is definitely worth a try if 15 is enough for you.</li>
    <li> I see a lot of 5 stars and a lot of 1 star reviews here- it either burns or it doesn&#x27;t.  I can say I searched high and low for a moisturizer WITH SPF that didn&#x27;t redden my face and/or have some kind of bad reaction with my skin from daily use.  Neutrogena, equate, oil of olay, lancome, clearasil, jack black, etc. etc. All big fails that have lead to a massive face lotion collection for my girlfriend.  This is the only one I&#x27;ve found that works great for my skin type, does what it&#x27;s supposed to, doesn&#x27;t sting, and is generally awesome. Clearly this is satan&#x27;s spawn for some, but if you&#x27;ve been on the hunt for a while to no avail for SPF face lotion, this one clearly has some different active ingredients than 90% of the other ones on the market.</li>
    <li> Good moisturizer, but doesn&#x27;t have last moisturizing effects. Have to apply at least twice a day.</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely a gem in my book.  It prevents skin damage, reduces wrinkles and lines on the face and soothes my skin to touchable perfection.  This company is recommended by my dermatologist and is fragrance free.</li>
    <li> Been using it for the past few days.  My face feels moisturized, but it burns when I apply it. Has alcohol in it, that&#x27;s probably why. Not sure why a moisturizer has alcohol as an ingredient.</li>
    <li> like the others said, this product stings a lot. My eyes keep running even though I didn&#x27;t realy apply it close to my eyes. I have special eye cream. throwing them away. I don&#x27;t even recommend the smell.</li>
    <li> My derm recommend this as I have hormonal acne.  I have been using this for about 3 years.  It has kept my skin moisturized and even worked my fine lines well.  I don&#x27;t find there to be any offensive scent as other noted.  As a matter of fact, I don&#x27;t find a scent at all.  Initially, I had to keep this away from my eyes as it would sting.  Don&#x27;t know what happened - if the product changed or my body changed, but I don&#x27;t have that issue any longer.  My only issue is that I can find this same product locally for the same or lesser price without the shipping fees.  Get rid of the shipping fees associated with this and I would purchase from Amazon every time.</li>
