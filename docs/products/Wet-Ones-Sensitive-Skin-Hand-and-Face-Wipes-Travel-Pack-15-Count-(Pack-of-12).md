      <li>Wet Ones are amazing and it&#x27;s really great to have the option to get these travel packs on subscribe &amp; save.  </li>

      <li>These wipes clean him up without causing rashes.</li>

      <li>Pros: quick, convenient, re-seals well, sanitizes (I&#x27;m assuming),</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly</li>
      <li>I love having wipes handy in my car for cleaning my hands if I can&#x27;t wash them in a restroom, or for cleaning them if they get messy while we&#x27;re out.</li>
      <li>Also, great to have in the car for everyday use.</li>
      <li>Plus having the sensitive skin factor is better for his baby skin.  </li>
      <li>With norovirus and flu running around, I&#x27;ve stayed healthy so far.  </li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t take up too much space, stay moist in the packaging, and clean my hands well without drying them out.</li>
      <li>These wet ones sensitive skin hand and face wipes travel pack are great to keep in your purse for emergencies.  </li>
      <li>Very gentle</li>
      <li>Exactly as described.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve ordered and reordered these wipes for the last number of years after trying many others.</li>
      <li>The Sensitive Wet Ones are gentler on the skin than some wet-wipes, and handy to keep in my purse for quick clean-ups.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;ve come in handy when my husband had to change our tire and his hands were black and greasy</li>
      <li>The moisturizers leave your hand really slimy and sticky.  </li>
      <li>they are as much a part of my toolkit as a stethoscope and BP cuff.  </li>
      <li>With an infant, I use these all the time to clean public surfaces before he touches them.  </li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t actually get your hands clean.</li>
      <li>I like this product, but would like it more if it was a smaller size, so it can fit in small handbags.</li>
      <li>You never know what kinds of germs are on high chairs and tables and whatnot.  </li>
      <li>Most wipes burn her little hands.</li>
      <li>So, I wish the packaging was a little better.  </li>
      <li>I have a grand-daughter with very sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I purchased some Johnson and Johnson Baby Wipes locally for immediate needs, then went with Wet Ones given that large quantities were available on Amazon.&lt;br</li>
      <li>We always buy sensitive skin products if we can!</li>
      <li>I love these small and portable packets.</li>
      <li>I also like how these wipes leave your hands feeling soft, after you have cleaned them.</li>
      <li>My son has eczema, and his skin is sensitive.</li>
      <li>started helping a friend with 2 young kids</li>
      <li>I also wanted wipes for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>/&gt;These are sensitive skin, though, so they&#x27;re not antibacterial.</li>
      <li>Plus they are long and flat and fit right in a small pocket w/a diaper instead of the bulkier portable/disposable wipes.</li>
      <li>Yes, I really did buy the 12 pack of Wet Ones, but I dont regret it one bit!</li>
      <li>There is no cleaning \\&quot;power\\&quot; claim on the Wet Ones, leaving me to believe that they only wash away messes but really didn&#x27;t clean/sanitize things like your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<li> No strong scent and gentle enough for my eczema prone son&#x27;s skin.</li>
<li> I use these everyday to keep my little one clean.</li>
<li> I highly recommend these wipes for travel and everyday use.</li>
<li> We used to use the individually wrapped ones, but they tend to dry out since we were purchasing them in volume from BJ&#x27;s.  </li>
<li> I do recommend that in order to extend the seal&#x27;s life, for you to manually dry out the area, where the seal will stick, because this helps the seal to actually stick.</li>
<li> /&gt;Smell - I found the smell to be strange and almost chemcial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> and they all end up being dry wipes.  </li>
<li> the Wet Ones washed away visible dirt, etc..., but I never knew how completely they killed germs.  </li>
<li> /&gt;Compared with the J&amp;J Baby Wipes, I felt the Wet Ones were lacking in two areas:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I keep a pack in the center console of my car as well as my purse.</li>
<li> the packet is LONG, too long for putting in a pocket or a small handbag.  </li>
<li> They do have a slight odor to them, the one characteristic of non scented wipes.</li>
<li> Thank you, Wet Ones!</li>
<li> I have never found any other brand that gives me a purse-sized packet and that is truly fragrance and otherwise fume-free.</li>
<li> So i like to wipe everything down before he goes at it.  </li>
<li> I use them for my hands, my kids&#x27; hands and faces, after pumping gas, wiping down grocery cart handles...</li>
<li> Health policy professions recommend generally not using anti-bacterial products, because their widespread overuse has led to super-bacteria that common antibiotics can&#x27;t kill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> (Every time you pull a wipe out, the area is slightly moistened.)</li>
<li> These have been in my bag since my little guy was born 4 years ago.  </li>
<li> the cover will not be sticky after a few lifts so i will use a strip of duck tape to seal the unused wipes.  </li>
<li> We use these in our diaper bag instead of portable wipe container that you have to keep filling and always seem to be dried out when you need them.</li>
<li> Power - the J&amp;J Wipes said their wipes killed 95% of the germs.  </li>
<li> : smells so strong that if you use it before eating, it ruins the taste, leaves a bad taste on you fingers and other things you sanitize such as pacifiers :( ...</li>
<li> However, the scent is not strong, and it leaves as soon as the moisture dries our, from your hands.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s hard to find wipes that aren&#x27;t antibacterial wipes.</li>
<li> Wipes are thin, therefore the package is slender with 15 wipes.</li>
<li> I hate buying wet wipes because i never use them up</li>
<li> Since they&#x27;re fragrance-free, the wipes smell similar to fragrance-free lotions (i.e. nothing disgusting).</li>
<li> And they smell weird.</li>
<li> While recovering knee surgery, I found it difficult (and dangerous) to wash my hands.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Totally not what I was looking for.  The moisturizers leave your hand really slimy and sticky.  Felt horrible and I had to wash my hands afterwards to get rid of the stickiness.</li>
    <li> With an infant, I use these all the time to clean public surfaces before he touches them.  You never know what kinds of germs are on high chairs and tables and whatnot.  Plus having the sensitive skin factor is better for his baby skin.  A must-have for your diaper bag!  Also, great to have in the car for everyday use.</li>
    <li> Yes, I really did buy the 12 pack of Wet Ones, but I dont regret it one bit! I&#x27;ve given a couple away to family &amp; keep a stash in my car, in my purse, &amp; when I go hiking. It makes cleaning a breeze!</li>
    <li> I hate buying wet wipes because i never use them up and they all end up being dry wipes.  thought i would give this one a try for there are only 15 in a packet.  the packet is LONG, too long for putting in a pocket or a small handbag.  the cover will not be sticky after a few lifts so i will use a strip of duck tape to seal the unused wipes.  the jury is still out on this one.</li>
    <li> I was searching for wipes that were OK for children to use on their faces as well as their hands. Wet Ones Sensitive Skin Hand and Face Wipes Travel Pack were it! These come in a convenient resealable package that fits into my purse or totebag. I keep a pack in the car glove compartment, too. They are great!</li>
    <li> Love the unscented - doesn&#x27;t smell chemically</li>
    <li> Met expectations.  Excellent product and service!</li>
    <li> Wet Ones are amazing and it&#x27;s really great to have the option to get these travel packs on subscribe &amp; save.  I have them everywhere - purse, car, desk, etc. I&#x27;m not quite sure what I&#x27;d do without them.</li>
    <li> We use these for school lunches.  We used to use the individually wrapped ones, but they tend to dry out since we were purchasing them in volume from BJ&#x27;s.  Also they were more difficult to open.  These packages are easier to open as the kids can seal and reseal them using only what they need.  We always buy sensitive skin products if we can!</li>
    <li> Works great! Shipped well! Arrived quickly</li>
    <li> My kid will touch anything, no matter how disgusting.  If given the chance, he&#x27;d submerge his hand in a urinal at Soldier Field.  So i like to wipe everything down before he goes at it.  These wipes do the trick.</li>
    <li> I have never found any other brand that gives me a purse-sized packet and that is truly fragrance and otherwise fume-free. I have chemical sensitivities and I can use these.</li>
    <li> I like this product, but would like it more if it was a smaller size, so it can fit in small handbags.</li>
    <li> I love having wipes handy in my car for cleaning my hands if I can&#x27;t wash them in a restroom, or for cleaning them if they get messy while we&#x27;re out. I especially keep a pack handy if we&#x27;re on vacation, at a concert, or at some kind of festival/fair. They&#x27;ve come in handy when my husband had to change our tire and his hands were black and greasy afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are sensitive skin, though, so they&#x27;re not antibacterial. I wonder how clean they get my hands if I&#x27;m going to be eating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Convenient</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a nurse out on the road, from patient&#x27;s houses to facilities.  I use these constantly between patients, and wash my hands almost as often.  These cloths are not drying, they stay moist inbetween package openings, and I feel are very effective.  With norovirus and flu running around, I&#x27;ve stayed healthy so far.  i have these coming to me on Subscribe &amp; Save, and wouldn&#x27;t change it ever ... they are as much a part of my toolkit as a stethoscope and BP cuff.  Thank you, Wet Ones!</li>
    <li> I love these small and portable packets. I use them for my daughter when we&#x27;re on the go. I also bought the dispenser but I like this better because I can fit it into my pocket and it makes things easier traveling with a kid to have lighter things.</li>
    <li> I love these wipes. They are always handy. It&#x27;s hard to find wipes that aren&#x27;t antibacterial wipes. I also like how these wipes leave your hands feeling soft, after you have cleaned them. They do have a slight odor to them, the one characteristic of non scented wipes. However, the scent is not strong, and it leaves as soon as the moisture dries our, from your hands. The resealable lid works well every time. I do recommend that in order to extend the seal&#x27;s life, for you to manually dry out the area, where the seal will stick, because this helps the seal to actually stick. (Every time you pull a wipe out, the area is slightly moistened.) I use a wipe every day, at work, at lunch time, and I find that the wipes do sustain a comfortable amount of moisture to do the job well.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for.  A must have in any purse, carry-on or backpack!  Do not leave home without these.</li>
    <li> Our son carries in variety places, back pack, tackle box, CamelBak, and extras in his foot lockers when he goes camp.</li>
    <li> Having both mysophobia and eczema on my hands, these wipes do wonders. They don&#x27;t take up too much space, stay moist in the packaging, and clean my hands well without drying them out. Since they&#x27;re fragrance-free, the wipes smell similar to fragrance-free lotions (i.e. nothing disgusting). I highly recommend these wipes for travel and everyday use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d give these 5 stars, if they had slightly better packaging.  I have a 3 year old, and always keep them handy in my bag, and at home.  I would give them 5 stars, but the sticky tab used the close the packages stops working sometimes.  So, I wish the packaging was a little better.  They have never fallen out of the package though.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described. Love these handy wipes!</li>
    <li> These are great all around wipes for both humans and pets.</li>
    <li> The Sensitive Wet Ones are gentler on the skin than some wet-wipes, and handy to keep in my purse for quick clean-ups.</li>
    <li> I bought these foremost to avoid anti-bacterial cleaning products.  Health policy professions recommend generally not using anti-bacterial products, because their widespread overuse has led to super-bacteria that common antibiotics can&#x27;t kill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I also wanted wipes for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started helping a friend with 2 young kids and she instructed me to have wipes for them to use before outside eating.  Since I always had some for the kids, I started using them too.  I was hooked.  Now, I never go out without a pack.</li>
    <li> I use these everyday to keep my little one clean.</li>
    <li> Love these. Very handy. Used them in many dire situations. If you have kids, a must!</li>
    <li> These are perfect for me. Wipes are thin, therefore the package is slender with 15 wipes. Reseals well after use and the wipes are very effective. I&#x27;ve ordered and reordered these wipes for the last number of years after trying many others. The best wipes for travel.</li>
    <li> I got these for my diaper bag. They don&#x27;t actually get your hands clean. And they smell weird. Didn&#x27;t care for them</li>
    <li> Great to have in your bag and takes up almost no room.  I use it for my toddlers hands and face when we are on the go.  No strong scent and gentle enough for my eczema prone son&#x27;s skin.</li>
    <li> While recovering knee surgery, I found it difficult (and dangerous) to wash my hands.  I purchased some Johnson and Johnson Baby Wipes locally for immediate needs, then went with Wet Ones given that large quantities were available on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared with the J&amp;J Baby Wipes, I felt the Wet Ones were lacking in two areas:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sanitation Power - the J&amp;J Wipes said their wipes killed 95% of the germs.  There is no cleaning \\&quot;power\\&quot; claim on the Wet Ones, leaving me to believe that they only wash away messes but really didn&#x27;t clean/sanitize things like your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell - I found the smell to be strange and almost chemcial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line the Wet Ones washed away visible dirt, etc..., but I never knew how completely they killed germs.  I ended up using sanitizer wipes when it was important to kill germs.</li>
    <li> I keep a pack in the center console of my car as well as my purse. I use them for my hands, my kids&#x27; hands and faces, after pumping gas, wiping down grocery cart handles...I could probably use it for more but I go through a pack a week as it is!</li>
    <li> My son has eczema, and his skin is sensitive. These wipes clean him up without causing rashes. I always keep a pack of the wipes in my diaper bag. We keep a larger container of the wipes on our kitchen table for any messes.</li>
    <li> These wet ones sensitive skin hand and face wipes travel pack are great to keep in your purse for emergencies.  I use them all the time.</li>
    <li> I throw a pack in each purse, bag, and room.  This is great to use on my baby since she is at point where everything goes in the mouth.</li>
    <li> I like how convenient this pack is. Very portable and comes in handy in messes. I use them every day. Very gentle</li>
    <li> I keep these with me. I have a grand-daughter with very sensitive skin. Most wipes burn her little hands. These work well but don&#x27;t sting. We ate Cheetos and got orange stains on our hands. That stuff doesn&#x27;t come off easily. This product removed the orange stains without burning.</li>
    <li> Pros: quick, convenient, re-seals well, sanitizes (I&#x27;m assuming), good price when bought in bulk plus subscribe-and-save&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: smells so strong that if you use it before eating, it ruins the taste, leaves a bad taste on you fingers and other things you sanitize such as pacifiers :( ...which is the primary reason I bought this</li>
    <li> These have been in my bag since my little guy was born 4 years ago.  Great for hands and faces!</li>
    <li> We use these in our diaper bag instead of portable wipe container that you have to keep filling and always seem to be dried out when you need them. Plus they are long and flat and fit right in a small pocket w/a diaper instead of the bulkier portable/disposable wipes.</li>
    <li> I love these wipes. Great for the car, stroller, purse and use them daily. They do not have a chemical smell and I feel safe using them on my toddler.</li>
    <li> Not moist enough, I use them to wipe my dog after he does his business.</li>
