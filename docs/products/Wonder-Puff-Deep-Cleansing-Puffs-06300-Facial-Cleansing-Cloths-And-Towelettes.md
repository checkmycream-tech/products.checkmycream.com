<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These are really gd for cleaning ur face if you have acne problems. They get deep down in ur pores they feel like an sos pad at first if ur not use to using them. Over time as you use it, it will start to soften up. When it get to soft that&#x27;s how you know it time to throw it out. I have been using these for years. I use to buy them out of Walmart but they most definitely work for exfoliating ur skin and clearing up ur face, ur face will be glowing afterwards. Make sure you use a face moisturizer afterwards to help with the peeling away of died skin.</li>
    <li> Cheap and worth it! At Wal-mart they sell like 2 of the cleansing puff for almost $4. This is a bargain and I always have plenty in hand.</li>
    <li> I have  bought this at other stores but they don&#x27;t carry them anymore.  This sponches are good for face and body. They really get the make up off your face. I will recommend this product. However if you skin is sensitive to scrobing go for something soft.</li>
    <li> These unfortunately did not live up to my expectations. I was hoping they would feel and exfoliate like the real &amp;#34;Buff Puffs&amp;#34; but they don&#x27;t. There too abrasive because the fibers on it are all uneven and spaced too far. So you get an agressive scrub (even if you apply little to no pressure) and the sponge doesn&#x27;t hold any water in it.</li>
    <li> great item at a great price</li>
    <li> Great face scrubbers.</li>
    <li> I use these puffs strictly for my facials and they feel great.  They do a good job of daily exfoliating.  Cheap and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Good price for a good product.  We cut them in half, which doubled the value.  They do not scratch your skin if you keep the pads wet.</li>
    <li> 36 years old and people always comment on how youthful I look. Each one lasts 3-4 weeks for me. Great value.</li>
    <li> Best price around for Buf Puf&#x27;s very happy with the quality &amp; the speedy delivery. Would definitely purchase again!! Easy transaction!</li>
    <li> I love these puffs.  I use them morning and night.  My skin is always exfoliated. I&#x27;ve been using these for at least 20+ years and I&#x27;ve always gotten compliments on how clear and nice my skin is.  Since I use these I never have to use scrub etc...  I just use dove soap on this puff and wash my face.</li>
    <li> Hard to find these gems! Love &#x27;em!</li>
    <li> Nice size puffs that work as expected. Like the storage bag--has a zip close top to keep the puffs fresh until use.</li>
    <li> Excellent cleansing product! Removes dead skin, oil and bacteria... Best facial sponge I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Great product. Have been using the brand name version for years, but would like to replace it more frequently. this product fits the bill perfectly. Works just as well and I don&#x27;t feel guilty replacing it as often as I want to.</li>
    <li> Love these puffs.  I bought them for shower use, but they are also are great for washing dishware and other general cleaning.  I searched all over for them and couldn&#x27;t find them anywhere.  Economical too.  Thanks Amazon.</li>
    <li> The original &#x27;buff puff&#x27; was very good, but for some reason, the manufacturer changed how they made them. They do not last as long and expensive. I&#x27;m trying this alternative. They seem slightly less abrasive the original and also have already started to break down.</li>
    <li> Work well but wear out quickly</li>
    <li> Completely satisfied.</li>
    <li> Just like a buff puff. great deal.</li>
    <li> leaves my face feeling clean, refreshed and smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom &#x3D;P You won&#x27;t find the prices lower anywhere else..</li>
    <li> I bought a pack of these once and have been looking everywhere for them!! I&#x27;m so glad that I finally have them again my skin is so soft</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase. I use this every day when showering and use it to exfoliate my whole body, works especially well on my underarms. I did find it a bit too rough on my face though.</li>
    <li> These are my favorite facial exfoliant puffs. I sometimes break one in half and use the inside part, which is smoother. I use them almost daily to exfoliate, but I try not to put much pressure on the skin so not to irritate it, and that way these work wonderfully!</li>
    <li> Facial cleansers are very important but so is taking off the dead layer of skin on your face.  I highly recommend this product.  I&#x27;ve been using it for almost 25 years.  It makes a HUGE difference in how your skin looks an feels and it&#x27;s so budget friendly.  I keep mine in the shower to use and I use once or twice a week.</li>
    <li> I like these puffs.  Note:  they are &amp;#34;tougher&amp;#34; than Buff Puffs so expect a vigorous defoliation!  They last longer and stay &amp;#34;crisper&amp;#34; and for the price are a good buy.</li>
    <li> I was so glad to see that they work just like the name brand buf puf.</li>
    <li> These are a great value. They are also very coarse. For sensitive skin like mine I can use these every two to three days. Any more than that and my skin gets tender. But on that note, they are perfect for daily smoothing on the body. especially rough areas like elbows and knees. Probably not tough enough for feet though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just keep them clean, well rinsed and let them dry between each use and you can get several weeks out of one at nearly daily use.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THESE!!!!! So glad I found them on Amazon. Can&#x27;t find them in stores any more. These are for serious exfoliating. They are NOT gentle. Just how I like em! If you used the winco brand before they discontinued them you&#x27;ll love these. Same thing.</li>
    <li> Great product, great price</li>
    <li> Does not last as long as BuffPuff, gets flat too easily, but it is an OK product.</li>
    <li> These are great for cleaning the bottom of your pans!  I bet they&#x27;d be great to scrub your feet after a day at the beach.  If you want to leave some gashes on your face, then go ahead and try it there too (I did and sorely regret it)</li>
    <li> These work very well as opposed to Buf Puffs or others I have tried and the price is right as well.  Will purchase again. Have purchased for the second time and the shipping was extremely fast..  Will puruchase again.. So nice to use these a few times and dispose.    Great hygienic item if used properly.</li>
    <li> Very good. As good as the store bought type but less expensive and more of them. Buy these scrubbers now!</li>
    <li> Really a great buy! I cut mine in half for face and use with facial cleaner to keep pores clean and clear. Significantly reduces break outs by exfoliation. Great product.</li>
    <li> People comment on my beautiful skin and I am 62.  I use these puffs on my face to keep my skin feeling fresh and looking glowing.  I use them on my body for skin brushing and defoliating.</li>
    <li> These are the best . I have not been able to find these that work like this.</li>
    <li> I purchased the wrong thing.  I need the one for sensitive skin.  This version is a bit too rough for my skin.</li>
    <li> Remember these from long ago and love them.  We sent some to the soldiers, thought they could use too. Thanks</li>
    <li> These are just like the original Buf Puf exfoliating sponges that seem to have disappeared - and are a much better price anyway!</li>
    <li> these lose their edge after maybe 3 uses - - can&#x27;t really complain though.  You get what you pay for.  Based on quality and durability buy the buff puff if you want something longer lasting - buy this if you want to replace every couple days.  Not bad - - when you chalk up the final price it is probably equivalent.</li>
    <li> Great puffs, and economical. Work as well as the brand name without the cost! I would recommend buying these if you need an exfoliating pad.</li>
    <li> excellent value, just like the expensive ones.</li>
    <li> Not as finely textured as the original brand of puffs but a great value.  Great to keep on hand as replacements and would buy again.</li>
    <li> Thought I would buy these based on reviews as a replacement for the Buf-Puf. Big mistake. It&#x27;s really not abrasive enough to do much exfoliation and it starts to pill almost immediately after 2 uses. It&#x27;s OK for facial application -- if you want to use it to lather up your face wash. But that&#x27;s also what a clarisonic is for.....Def not buying this again.</li>
    <li> Really too rough on your skin</li>
    <li> Very happy to find this economical alternative to buf puf.  Exactly the same as the name brand.  Yes if you scrub your face hard it will hurt, but the answer is simple - just apply less force.  Duh.</li>
    <li> I have ordered this for over 2 years, this last shipment the product quality was different -- very rough.&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed after buying this for so long.</li>
    <li> I have been using &amp;#34;cleansing puffs&amp;#34; for over 30 years and these are just as good as the name brand puffs at 1/5 of the price.  They are great cleansing and exfoliating puffs.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s too rough. I don&#x27;t think it can be used to wash face. Now I use it to clean the wash basin.</li>
    <li> We buy these a lot. Cheap little scrubby that does the trick !</li>
    <li> These are really really abrasive.</li>
    <li> This is the Best Buff....Gentle on skin, a very good exfoliater, Highly recommend to anyne, Price is very reasonable and economical</li>
    <li> This is a great product at a great price. Couldn&#x27;t ask for more. Excellent product that performs just as promised.</li>
    <li> I use these all the time. Perfect for facial scrubbing and lasts forever.</li>
    <li> My skin feels wonderfully smooth and clean after using this puff, along with a facial scrub.  It is very rejuvenating!</li>
    <li> Bought for my cousin works the same as Buff Puff&#x27;s and does not cost as much, she really likes the Wonder Cleansing Puffs as they clean your pores and remove dead skin from your face, a must have.</li>
    <li> These are great for getting rid of any kind of really dry skin on a regular basis.  I am on Retin A and my face is constantly flaking because of it, and I wash my face with these every morning and night and it does a great job of exfoilating without irritating my skin any further. They last a couple of weeks and then you can just throw one away and get a fresh one.  Good bargain.</li>
    <li> Definitely a little rough like others have said in their reviews, but that&#x27;s expected for a exfoliating scrub. After a few days of use it was perfectly fine. It does its job and I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> Terrible.  Product arrived smelling musty.  Product unusable.  Harsh as sandpaper also. Worst experience I have ever had using Amazon.</li>
    <li> Too rough for facial cleaning.</li>
    <li> This is my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; multi use sponge. It&#x27;s great for exfoliating the underarms and getting rid of deodorant build up!!!</li>
    <li> Too harsh to use on your face. It scratched my skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Buff puff singles for years, but they are getting really expensive and hard to find.  I found the wonder Puff on Amazon and w/the great reviews, I had to try it.  Well, the price isn&#x27;t bad, that&#x27;s true, but the puff itself has some issues.  First it&#x27;s very thick and large, and isn&#x27;t easy to handle or use on your face.  It is extremely abrasive.  You feel like you&#x27;re scratching your face.  You have to keep squeezing out water because it doesn&#x27;t hold water if yo wet it &amp; it drips all over the place.  That said, I have found a way that works ok for me.  First, I cut the puff in half so that it&#x27;s not so thick.  You can get a better grip and it&#x27;s more flexible to move around the face.  Second, I use it very, very, lightly.  I can&#x27;t emphasize that enough.  It feels akin to sandpaper and can hurt, so you really must be careful.  Exfoliating is good, removing the skin or scratching it isnt.  Having said all that, I will use these and see how they last.  I have to admit that the price is pretty good, especially if you cut them in half, you then get 24.  One thing I might mention is if you leave them out and have a cat, your cat is going to find it and that may be the last you see of it.  My cat loves it, it&#x27;s a great cat toy as far as she is concerned.  I just gave up and gave her one, and she&#x27;s always batting it around.  I hide the other puffs.</li>
    <li> Practically as good quality as the original BP, much better than most; great value.</li>
    <li> VERY pleased,  WILL re order</li>
    <li> I thought I would try these just to save some $$ since the Buf-Puf brand is a little pricy but these are NOT the same. They are rough, not gentle and are really flimsy when you get them wet. I would not buy these again.</li>
    <li> It is cheaper to buy the bag and convenient for me.  I don&#x27;t run out so quickly.</li>
    <li> My skin looks and feels amazing.  Not only are they great facial buffers but they do an amazing job cleaning bathroom counters, sinks and other tough dirty jobs.</li>
    <li> Just what i needed to clean my face.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for.  Better price than the local beauty supply store.  although I already submitted this review!  So once again. great product</li>
    <li> Love Them.. Really get&#x27;s dirt out from deep in your skin pores. Makes my face look refresh!! Thank You</li>
    <li> What a great bargain, exactly as I remember buf pufs as being. Love them and would buy again. Received very quickly</li>
    <li> good deal.... super for using a scrub on your face with this sponge.</li>
    <li> Recieved my Wonder Wedges promptly. they are just like buff puffs which i cannot find in stores anymore. these are the perfect replacement solution.</li>
    <li> when cvs charges you 4+ per facial scrubbing pad, finding an economy sized bag was awesome! i use this everyday, have for years. i&#x27;m almost 40 and can pass for 20... no wrinkles and i credit daily scrubbing for it.</li>
    <li> this item was shipped promptly.  this item was well packaged. item is cheaper than what i can buy for locally.</li>
    <li> I love these &amp;#34;buff puff&amp;#34; knock offs.  They are the same as the original and much less expensive.  I&#x27;ve got one each in two showers and two vanities for facial cleaning along with my Clarisonic.  These are great!</li>
    <li> FANTASTIC PRODUCT. I BUY IN BULK TO ENSURE I DO NOT RUN OUT. IT IS GREAT FOR EXFOLIATION OF THE SKIN!</li>
    <li> These Wonder Puffs are not only the best facial scrub but they are also the best deal. Men, women and children alike can use the Wonder Puff along with a facial soap to keep your facial skin clean and clear. Wonder Puffs provide light exfoliation. I can&#x27;t live without them now!</li>
    <li> I love these...they aren&#x27;t buff puff brand so they won&#x27;t endure as long but if you want a good substitute at a reasonable price, these are them.  I have bought several bags of them and I&#x27;ve never been disappointed. I would recommend them!</li>
    <li> I no longer can find these in my local beauty stores anymore :( But so glad I found on Amazon for such an amazing price! The local stores use to sell a 1 pack for the same price of this 12 pack. I use one in my daily regimen. And when traveling, I never leave home without one.</li>
    <li> Love these. I think you have to get used to them, but I feel like my face is not clean without using them. Great exfoliation, then moisturizer really gets absorbed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using products like this one for decades to reduce razor bumps (pseudofolliculitis) from my face. And it works better when used with proper shaving techniques and razor bump medicine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue with this particular brand of cleansing puff is that the material used is more suited for gentle use. Which means this product only last 3-5 days under the strain I put it under. But overall, for the price, I can live with replacing them regularly. Try it with a good facial cleanser for reducing razor bumps.</li>
    <li> Great size and good quality.  Effective for daily deep cleansing.</li>
    <li> Great deal! Buff Puff quality</li>
    <li> It really helps get rid of the dead skin. With a clean feeling afterwards.</li>
    <li> Best sponge for facial cleaning!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how inexpensive these cleansing puffs were as compared to other items of the same type. I have used facial scrubs of one brand or another for many years. I need to be clear first - I have no problem heavily scrubbing my face with an abrasive. After shaving I use one of these to scrub dead skin from my face and at 65 still look years younger because of this. When I lapse into not scrubbing for a while I notice (as does my wife) that I look a lot more &amp;#34;tired&amp;#34; than when using. If your face can take the abrasion (which is actually mild) then these are for you especially at the price point. I guess some women may find them too harsh but even my wife uses some sort of facial scrubbing brush which is a lot more work and a much greater expense.</li>
    <li> These sponges are a great substitute to the Buf Puf sponges that I love.  They are a little rougher than the Buf Puf, but I just use them in a gentler manner.  I definitely recommend!</li>
