<li> I live in a dry climate area and have a lot of hair issues as a result.  </li>
<li> Overall, I&#x27;d recommend this product for dry, itchy scalp.</li>
<li> Clearly, the product actually does exfoliate the scalp and scrubs away build-up because my hair has grown thicker after two uses merely three weeks after my first use.</li>
<li> but wasn&#x27;t any better than less expensive products</li>
<li> Afterward, hair felt sort of dry.</li>
<li> It ends up making my scalp extra oily for the next few days.</li>
<li> I will admit that my hair is quite thick, so someone with thin or thinning hair would probably have better luck.  </li>
<li> My scalp is very dry and itchy.</li>
<li> Smells exactly as I expected, but I have a problem with getting the actual scrub part (rough granules) down to my scalp.</li>
<li> I only used it a few times a week for a month and then sporadically after that</li>
<li> Total waste of money.</li>
<li> I was hoping it would reduce the scaling on my scalp, but found that the scrubbing granules got trapped in my hair so they weren&#x27;t actually reaching the source of my problem.  </li>
<li> There was absolutely no difference.</li>
<li> That was the result I expected to see with this Bay Leaf Exfoliating Treatment</li>
<li> I haven&#x27;t seen the results that other reviewers have stated.</li>
<li> I use is every other day just to get rid of it and still, I do not see the results that I was hoping for this product to give.</li>
<li> Maybe exfoliating dry, dead skin will help my hair to grow.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve also noticed less hair shedding in the shower.</li>
<li> I leave in my hair for a few minutes while I shave my legs, again, once a week.</li>
<li> :/</li>
<li> This product was not effective for me.  </li>
<li> If your hair is already thick and you do not want it thicker, I would not recommend using.</li>
<li> Only bad thing is that sometimes it&#x27;s hard to get all the exfoliating particles out of my hair.  </li>
<li> I had hoped to have the side effect of hair growth because my hair is normally thin, (not thinning)</li>
<li> It is on the expensive side but it works (plus, you aren&#x27;t supposed to use it everyday/wash).</li>
<li> After arriving and noticing the fake looking packaging I went to the official website to search for the product.</li>
<li> Product is fake!!</li>
<li> Ouidad Bay Leaf treatment has relieved the terrible itching,</li>
<li> and I&#x27;m not getting the horrible winter dryness anymore.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love how soft my hair feels after I use this!</li>
    <li> I had really high expectations for this product. I was hoping that this would be my yearly solution when the winter months came. I followed the instructions and made sure to get the scrub into my scalp. There was absolutely no difference. I use is every other day just to get rid of it and still, I do not see the results that I was hoping for this product to give. I have better results with two table spoons of olive oil and a tablespoon of brown sugar once a week. I leave in my hair for a few minutes while I shave my legs, again, once a week. My scalp is so clear afterward! That was the result I expected to see with this Bay Leaf Exfoliating Treatment and it did not work for me at all. I notice flakes right after blow drying from the shower I just used it with. I will not be purchasing this product again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome!  I love the way it makes my hair feel and it is a nice scrub for the scalp.  It&#x27;s gentle, yet effective.</li>
    <li> This product was not effective for me.

I will admit that my hair is quite thick, so someone with thin or thinning hair would probably have better luck.  I found the scent to be pleasant in an herbal way, but did not notice that it lingered in my hair.</li>
    <li> Initially I discovered this product as a trial size in a beauty box of the month club and while its aroma was not quite what I would expect the Mediterranean to smell like as I have never been there I do like this product and the results it produces. Rinse well!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel like this does much. If anything, I think it clogged my hair follicles more :/ I noticed an increase in dandruff and oil production on my scalp after using this product</li>
    <li> I think this product works well.  The smell is fine, not very noticeable.  I applied to wet hair and followed with regular shampoo (to make sure all of the scrub was out of my hair) and conditioner.  It did work to help with my itchy scalp, but didn&#x27;t make any difference with hair growth.  I mainly bought it for my dry scalp, which happens in the winter, and it has been effective.  I only used it a few times a week for a month and then sporadically after that and my scalp was back to normal.  I had hoped to have the side effect of hair growth because my hair is normally thin, (not thinning) but it didn&#x27;t happen.  Overall, I&#x27;d recommend this product for dry, itchy scalp.</li>
    <li> makes my hair so soft!  love this product.</li>
    <li> Itchy scalp? Try this! I thought I had a dandruff problem, after I used this 3 times my scalp itch had gone away completely and my hair felt so much cleaner.</li>
    <li> I found this product on sale at Ulta about a month ago, and I am SO glad I bought it! Clearly, the product actually does exfoliate the scalp and scrubs away build-up because my hair has grown thicker after two uses merely three weeks after my first use.

    <li> My scalp is very dry and itchy. Ouidad Bay Leaf treatment has relieved the terrible itching, Maybe exfoliating dry, dead skin will help my hair to grow. I hope so.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I live in a dry climate area and have a lot of hair issues as a result.  With this product I&#x27;m able to go longer between shampoos, keeping my hair from drying out as quickly.  My hair looks shinier and feels healthier.  My scalp hurts sometimes, too, and this product put an end to that. Only bad thing is that sometimes it&#x27;s hard to get all the exfoliating particles out of my hair.  I&#x27;ve repurchased 3 times!</li>
    <li> I love this product...very hydrating and my hair looks great for a week after one use.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works! You only need to use a &amp;#34;dab&amp;#34; (about the size of a pea). It exfoliates great. I actually have new hair coming in on my scalp thanks to this stuff cleaning my pores! My scalp and hair feel very clean after using it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is a little pricey but works amazingly. My scalp feels so clean and I&#x27;m not getting the horrible winter dryness anymore. I&#x27;ve also noticed less hair shedding in the shower.</li>
    <li> This product really works. Every time I do it my scalp feels cleaner and no little bumps or anything. It is an amazing product, I recommend it especially for people with scalp problems like me</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen the results that other reviewers have stated.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff to exfoliate my dry scalp, calm the itch, and remove buildup of products from my hair. I also love the smell. It really does smell like bay leaf and other herbs. I try to remember to use it once or twice a week.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t really do anything for my scalp .. conditioned hair ok but wasn&#x27;t any better than less expensive products</li>
    <li> Smells exactly as I expected, but I have a problem with getting the actual scrub part (rough granules) down to my scalp. It ends up making my scalp extra oily for the next few days. My hair seems to be grow a bit faster when I use it regularly, so maybe I&#x27;ll keep using it or look for a similar product that doesn&#x27;t give the oily effect.</li>
    <li> Total waste of money. Don&#x27;t bother with this product. Exfoliating your scalp is great but this product is not. I&#x27;ve taken the time to part my hair and apply the product but still didn&#x27;t feel a difference in my scalp as opposed to not using the product at all.</li>
    <li> Did absolutely nothing for my hair. Had a heck of a time washing it out! Afterward, hair felt sort of dry. I wanted to like this product so much since it&#x27;s not cheap. Oh well, still in search for the Holy Grail of hair conditioners.</li>
    <li> Product is fake!! After arriving and noticing the fake looking packaging I went to the official website to search for the product. I called Ouidad headquarters and they informed me that they stopped producing this product years ago. Be-careful!!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my teenage daughter who is blessed with a flaky scalp (yes, dandruff) yet oily hair. We have been searching for YEARS for something to combat both issues. If we get a dandruff shampoo to handle the scalp, it would make her hair greasy looking. If we found something a little more drying it would make her scalp itch and flake. This product has treated both problems with ease. It is on the expensive side but it works (plus, you aren&#x27;t supposed to use it everyday/wash).</li>
    <li> This is the best product for my hair.  I used it according to the directions and my hair feels so good after washings.  I recommend this Quidad product for anyone who is wear the natural styles today.</li>
    <li> Great exfoliator for the scalp, gentle, but effective.</li>
    <li> This stuff REALLY helps with my dry scalp in the winter!!</li>
    <li> Really soothing and brought body back to my hair</li>
