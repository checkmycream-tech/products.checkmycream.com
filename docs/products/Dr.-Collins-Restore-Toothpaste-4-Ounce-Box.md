      <li>&amp; it&#x27;s amazing stuff.</li>
      <li>(Jasmine Mint IS AMAZING)</li>
      <li>I used to get a lot of stains because I drink a lot of coffee and my teeth are a nice tooth color instead of a lot of stains.  </li>
      <li>but I was just so impressed by how much it helped my teeth sensitivity with just one use that I had to share it.  </li>
      <li>but I must say it does have a nice minty taste.</li>
      <li>I do know that it has a nice flavor and consistency.  </li>
      <li>Im kind of using this stuff as a maintainance product.</li>
      <li>When my teeth rubbed together it gave me that nails on the chalkboard kind of feeling.  </li>
      <li>I thought it would be good to get a tooth paste because I needed to be able to brush my teeth.</li>
      <li>It is effective in somewhat on recalcifying the teeth.</li>
      <li>The toothpaste does NOT have a strong minty taste, it is quite pleasant.  </li>
      <li>It also has a very mild, good flavor.  </li>
      <li>This product was much more cost effective, and it was shipped to my home in days.  </li>
      <li>This is the best product by far that I have ever used.  </li>
      <li>This is a great product - for the cost it is well worth it -</li>
      <li>Received a free tube as a trial, and loved it.  </li>
      <li>I liked it better when it cost 7$</li>
      <li>/&gt;It tastes great and a little seems to work great!</li>
      <li>The flavor is pleasant and my mouth feels clean without the burning sensation like most toothpastes leave after using.</li>
      <li>I was at first greatly displeased, because the claims in the description (Rebuilding Enamel) were nowhere on the packaging, figured it for yet another scam.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It also has a mild, but pleasant taste, that doesn&#x27;t interfere with the taste of my morning coffee :-)</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I used the whole tube without switching to any other brand and really didn&#x27;t notice any improvement over the cheapest toothpaste that can be purchased from the dollar store. I even purchased this with Dr. Collin&#x27;s toothbrushes (which are decent). This paste isn&#x27;t any better at rebuilding enamel, whitening teeth, or decreasing sensitivity than dirt cheap AIM toothpaste that comes in a tube 3x the size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, I&#x27;ll never buy it again. I tried plain baking soda with a warm salt water rinse for 30 days after I ran out of this stuff and it worked much better for all the things that this toothpaste claims.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a year.  While my sensitivity has leveled off, not sure whether it&#x27;s this toothpaste or my use of vegetal silica (or both) that is helping the sensitivity.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any whitening benefit.  I guess I&#x27;ll re-order but I&#x27;m really disappointed in the 17% price increase. It appears that demand for this product is increasing, this should reduce the price not increase it!!  Why?  I gave it 3 stars because of the price increase.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste keeps my teeth from feeling sensitive. I was using MI Paste from the dentist but wanted to find something less expensive. This works just as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had this a week so I&#x27;ll have to update later about any changes in my sensitive teeth, but I did want to say that the flavor is spearmint, which to me is a major score because that is my absolute favorite flavor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week &amp; it&#x27;s amazing stuff. I quit using my Sensodyne Pronamel &amp; brushed with this the night it arrived. Works great for sensitivity. I was afraid it wouldn&#x27;t be immediate, but it was. The texture is slightly gritty &amp; it&#x27;s a creamy paste with a light mint flavor. Not too sweet. The first time I brushed I noticed that my teeth were shining! Like almost sparkling. You can feel the protective coating over your teeth &amp; it makes you want to smile all day because your teeth feel so smooth &amp; strong. I brush for 2 mins &amp; then wait another minute to rinse while I brush &amp; scrape my tongue. Lastly, I rinse with Closys. My teeth stay smooth all day, &amp; I noticed less plaque on my teeth by the end of the day, even when I had a candy bar. The Novamin is awesome! I wish it was more widely available. I&#x27;m an oral hygiene fanatic &amp; I&#x27;m just now finding out about this product.</li>
    <li> This is a great product - for the cost it is well worth it - I have had way less sensitivity around my crowns and gums - been using it for several months and am on my 3rd tube now. I will continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> My dentists told me to get this and along with some treatment in his office my smile has gotten drastically brighter.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended this toothpaste because the bacterial makeup of my mouth was very acidic. He warned me I naturally had soft enamel, and that was where my sensitivity came from. He told me his wife had the same problem and that they used this toothpaste so he recommended it to me. I tried this toothpaste and was completely stunned at how well it treated my sensitivity.</li>
    <li> I just got it today so I haven&#x27;t been using it that long, but I just used it ONCE and I can already feel the positive effects. My teeth are sensitive to cold water and even sometimes breathing in air... but having just brushed my teeth with this stuff I don&#x27;t feel the slight pain in my teeth that I used to. I almost can&#x27;t believe how much of a difference it made from before.  Also from just one use my mouth has a more natural clean feeling than with any other typical tooth paste I&#x27;ve been using. It has a nice, not-too-overpowering taste to it that gives me fresh breath without the stingy minty coolness of other toothpastes (I don&#x27;t know how else to describe it).  I know I should have waited to review after using it for an extended amount of time but I was just so impressed by how much it helped my teeth sensitivity with just one use that I had to share it.  All in all I&#x27;m glad I bought it and look forward to keep on using it.</li>
    <li> Healed my kids small cavities.  Kids don&#x27;t get cavities while using it.  When they stop for a while they get them again.  So now I&#x27;m on a subscription so we won&#x27;t run out.  Restore every day keeps the dentist away!!</li>
    <li> I got this after reading the reviews. I haven&#x27;t had painful hot/cold sensitivity in my teeth since using this toothpaste. My teeth are noticeably whiter than before using this product. Well-recommended!</li>
    <li> The product has ingredients I cannot have like Sodium Laurel Sulfate. I wish the full ingredient listing was on the product page so this would not happen. I wish I could try the product but it&#x27;s not up to my basic quality standards AND none of these ingredients are listed on the product page. Also, this item is not eligible for returns while other tooth pastes Amazon sells are eligible.</li>
    <li> Runny, goopy, messy. Made in China. I thought I was saving money versus purchasing Oravive.  This stuff is not like toothpaste as I know it. I&#x27;ve never had paste run out of the tube and off the bristles until this product. That problem aside it seems to work ok. I&#x27;ll pay $2.00 more and buy the competing Oravive brand and it is made in the USA.</li>
    <li> I have fluorosis from too much fluoride as a child. I have tried all sorts of whitening products and they have helped slightly. But this toothpaste has whitened my teeth more than anything I&#x27;ve ever used. I don&#x27;t ever remember my teeth being so white as they are now. Now, they don&#x27;t just feel clean, they really look clean too. I have also not had a problem with sensitivity since using this toothpaste. I looked at several different toothpastes with NovaMin, and I tried this one because it doesn&#x27;t have fluoride. I really like that. Without a doubt, this is the best toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
    <li> I was very happy to find a remineralizing toothpaste without fluoride. It does the job I need, without that poison, and I like the taste. Can&#x27;t ask for much more from it.</li>
    <li> I have been using Restore Toothpaste for the last six months. It not only strengthens your teeth; it whitens them as well! An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Wow! This stuff works. Gone is the myth that once tooth enamel is lost it cannot be restored. It most certainly can be restored. This product does what it says and it doesn&#x27;t taste bad at all. I have a finicky 14 year old son who uses this and he loves it! I especially love the fact that it does not have any toxic fluoride in it. That alone would have kept me from trying it. I will continue to order this product and recommend it to others!!!!! This will save you lots of money, as you won&#x27;t need those tooth sealers. They can be made from toxic ingredients and further expose you to unnecessary chemicals. This is the way to go to care for your health.</li>
    <li> OMG, I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks. I have tried everything. I tried herbal stuff, I tried Synsodyne, I tried being super diligent about cleaning, but this is the only thing that has shown me real progress. I have pain when I eat processed sugar and cold. This week was the first time I ate chocolate muffins without rushing to my cup of Xylitol water (if you have teeth issues of any sort and you are not using xylitol, get on it!!!)! I ate cold salad today without cringing! Wow! I&#x27;m sorry, but nothing has given me any kind of sensationally noticeable results like this. And I am a lazy person... I don&#x27;t brush twice a day. There are even a few days where I fall asleep without brushing at all during finals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wonder what continued use of this product will do for me. I&#x27;m also tempted to buy the whole line, if he has one (floss and mouthwash). I haven&#x27;t been to the dentist yet, but will update when I do.</li>
    <li> Quick shipping. Really like it,it makes your mouth feel really fresh. Havn&#x27;t used it long. Hope it helps our teeth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for about a month. Within a week the sensitivity in my teeth greatly decreased. It tastes pretty good. It is a little more \\&quot;gooey\\&quot; than normal toothpaste but not to the point of being annoying, for me at least.  I&#x27;m in the middle of extensive dental treatment for lots of cavities. My tooth decay is very severe so I don&#x27;t expect this toothpaste to be a miracle cure for most of my teeth. But I hope that using this toothpaste, along with taking vitamins and drastically reducing the sugar in my diet, will help to some degree. When I get my next set of x-rays I will update this review if it has made a difference. I&#x27;ve given this toothpaste four stars because I&#x27;m unsure of the remineralization results so far.  This toothpaste would be beneficial for anyone looking to relieve sensitive teeth. As far as remineralization is concerned, time will tell.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because i noticed my teeth were starting to look aged...transparent, kind of yellow. Also my teeth had recently become very sensitive to cold water which was worrying.  After a week of using this toothpaste, I noticed that I was able to tolerate cold water.  I&#x27;m coming to the end of my 1st tube now and have noticed my teeth does look a bit more white and less transparent and no longer sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the most shocking aspect was upon purchasing some tools to clean and look closely at my teeth in a 10x mirror at the same time I had purchased this toothpaste, I had noticed about 4-6 vertical hairline cracks running through my front teeth.  I say 4-6 b/c I hadn&#x27;t officially logged it and can&#x27;t really remember where exactly they were....because they are no longer there!!  If I look really closely, I can still see one faded line...but it looks like a fine sheet of glass has covered it.&lt;br /&gt; I don&#x27;t care where its made, I&#x27;d use it anyway, but it says MADE IN USA!</li>
    <li> I am in love with this toothpaste. I tried it once and felt it was a pain to order it online so I went back to my normal toothpaste and regretted it ever since. My mouth felt cleaner than ever, my teeth were whiter, and my sensitive teeth no longer hurt. My dentist said that he has seen great improvement in the health of my teeth and even asked me what I was doing. I love this toothpaste and will continue to use it from now on. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for something new or those who have sensitive teeth- you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this product because I wanted to try to restore my teeth from years of acidic wear &amp; tear and I loved that it was fluroid-free, but I think it may have only minimally helped w/my tooth sensitivity.  The major problem I had was very noticeable calcium build-ups and deposits on my teeth that I would have to scrape off with a metal pick. I wasn&#x27;t overusing the product since I was only using it once a day.  Also, there are sulfates in this toothpaste which have known carcinogenic properties so I strive to avoid these in all my personal care products.</li>
    <li> I just started using Restore yesterday. My mouth feels so much cleaner and my gums and teeth do not hurt now. It is not runny at all. I&#x27;m puzzled why some say it is. Is your toothbrush soaking wet when you put Restore on it? Try it on a dryer toothbrush and don&#x27;t mix water in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased with this product. I will continue using it.</li>
    <li> The past is pretty good, but not sure if it is really any better then cheaper options made available these days by some of the major brands.</li>
    <li> There is a clean taste about this toothpaste that I find very pleasant, and my teeth feel cleaner after brushing, and my gums less sensitive, than after using other toothpastes. If it keeps up this way (I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week) I will consider it a real find.</li>
    <li> I used sensodyne for at least 12 months as instructed without any improvement. After using a presciption strength Novamin product, and finding relief after 30 days of treatment, I went back to using Sensodyne. Big mistake. I decided to try Dr. Collins, though I was a bit skeptical since the concentration of Novamin was so much lower than the prescription strength.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have just finished my  first tube of Dr. Collins and this is what I found:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The OTC product (Dr. Collins) takes longer to work than the prescription. It took about 2-3 weeks for me to feel a real difference. The improvement was gradual but significant. Its full effect took about 8-10 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The product is very effective at reducing sensitivity. Before, I was sensitive not only to cold, but to hot, to sweet, even to pressure. I couldn&#x27;t even tap on my teeth! Water had to be room temperature or had to be drunk through a straw to avoid my teeth. I am now able to eat ice cream and drink ice water from a glass without cringing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. It&#x27;s very effective at whitening. Many toothpastes claim to whiten. This is the ONLY one where I have noticed a difference, and others have commented too on how nice my teeth look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. The thinness of the toothpaste is easliy overcome at the beginning. Keep the toothpaste upside down at all times. You will only have soft toothpaste the first couple of times you use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product, I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This stuff works well on teeth, helping to restore/repair. I get even better check ups with it, even when I was eating too much sugar. I can tell it was helping to repair damage, including pain when i needed to. When I would stop using, I could feel, the difference in my dental health in more ways than one. So sorry not to be able to find more. I NEED MORE OF THIS PRODUCT! THIS ACTUALLY WORKS!</li>
    <li> I had read a bit about tooth re-mineralization and bought this toothpaste based upon the reviews here.  I have not been disappointed.  After only two weeks of use, my teeth feel so much cleaner, a miniscule chip on my front tooth is no longer visible, and my teeth are whiter and less \\&quot;transparent\\&quot; looking.  What&#x27;s more, I no longer wake up in the mornings with dry mouth and bad breath.  Hard to believe all the changes I&#x27;ve noticed.  I&#x27;m recommending this toothpaste to everyone I know!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a product to help  with sensitive teeth. I had been to the dentist several times and he did not know what was wrong. My dentist wanted to send me to a gum specialist, I choose not to go. I did allot of research and came across this product. I thought what do I have to lose 20 bucks so what!!!! I tried it and it really worked. I will say all my teeth were hurting, to cold, hot and sweets. I have used it for a few weeks and it is helping, they are not fully better, but I can at least eat. I had to microwave all my foods to eat it, now just some things. This sure does beet digging in your gums. I did not even get a diagnosis they were not sure what was causing them to hurt. I would recommend this to anyone it is a great product I know $10.00 for tooth paste seems awful, but when your desperate, ask yourself is it worth the try.  I am here to tell you yes!!!! I will continue&lt;br /&gt; to order this as long as I have to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blessings</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is excellent for people who suffer from sensitivity, weak teeth, or painful teeth. I have periodontitis and I felt my teeth becoming very weak. I also had severe sensitivity. The dentist as usual suggested sensodyne. However sensodyne did nothing. My teeth still hurt. After using this toothpaste for few days my sensitivity was gone and I no longer felt weak or painful teeth. I clearly felt my teeth strengthen and become harder. That is something I have never experienced with any other toothpaste I have ever used. This toothpaste is specifically targeted towards people with weak, painful and sensitive teeth</li>
    <li> After several weeks of use my teeth began to become translucent and very prone to staining from various foods.  I stopped use due to the unexpected and undesired &amp;quot;cosmetic&amp;quot; results.</li>
    <li> I like this product. It does not \\&quot;sting\\&quot; when you use it like other whitening products. My teeth look brighter.</li>
    <li> My teeth look whiter and feel smoother after just 3 uses!    I use it with the Perio brush.  You&#x27;ll be thankful you did the same.  See the reviews for yourself.    It&#x27;s crime dentists don&#x27;t teach us about Novamin, Restore toothpaste and the Perio brush!</li>
    <li> My teeth are whiter, brighter, stronger and feel tighter since switching to this toothpaste and making some other changes. Yellow stains from too much fluoride in toothpaste, dental cleanings, mouthwash our water supply and foods we eat have gone away. I had periodontal problems even when I flossed and brushed regularly, and my gums were receding. Now my gums are pink, healthy, the recession has slopped, and my gums feel less irritated.  Even my dentist has noticed the difference.</li>
    <li> Our Dentist recommended MI PASTE for our son, who also wears braces.  He had developed little &#x27;white spots&#x27; on his teeth due to his decrease in salvia production (because of braces).  The MI PASTE is only available by prescription is $25.  I read the ingredients of this product &amp; compared them to MI PASTE and they were exactly the same.  This product was much more cost effective, and it was shipped to my home in days.  Our son loves the taste, and we can see a difference in the &#x27;shades&#x27; of the white spots already!</li>
    <li> I recently had my first tooth filling EVER! I&#x27;m 36 years old, so for just now having a cavity I think that is great! However, eating after the fillings was very painful.  I could not eat anything too warm or too cool, forget soup &amp; ice cream!  I was looking for something, anything, that would take away this sensitivity to heat and cold. I read the reviews for \\&quot;Restore\\&quot; and thought I&#x27;d try it, anything had to be better than only being able to eat room temperature food.  I have been using this toothpaste for a little over a week and I can tell the difference!  I am able to eat warmer foods &amp; my ice tea don&#x27;t send me into cringing pain.  I hope with continuous use the sensitivity will be completely gone.  The toothpaste does NOT have a strong minty taste, it is quite pleasant.  It does NOT leave the inside of my cheeks peeling in a thin film like other strong toothpaste have. I also ordered the Dr. Collins toothbrush to use with this toothpaste, it is soft and very tender to gums. My teeth are smooth as pearls all day long. I have not found this toothpaste \\&quot;runny\\&quot; as some people have stated, it seems the same consistency as any other \\&quot;paste\\&quot; to me. I have not tried and other \\&quot;restorative\\&quot; toothpaste so I can&#x27;t say if this one is better than others like it, but I can say I like this MUCH better than regular fluoride toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Shame on you AMAZON!  This toothpaste is wonderful , and probably becoming quite popular. That is still NOT a reason to jack the price up from about 12 to 34 dollars.  NO WAY I&#x27;ll pay that price, to you or anybody.  Once again, SHAME ON YOU!</li>
    <li> I have been using Restore for a few weeks now and have found that it seems to do a great job when it comes to whitening and leaving the teeth with that \\&quot;clean film free\\&quot; feeling. However, part of the reason for purchasing the product was to reduce my teeth sensitivity to cold. If anything the product seemed to aggravate sensitivity to cold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I use another brand of toothpaste made exclusively for sensitive teeth which works just fine. However, it does not provide the other benefits of Restore, so no matter how thorough the brushing I am often left with that \\&quot;filmy teeth\\&quot; feeling and can see no visible whitening action. Every so often I try using Restore again just to get that \\&quot;clean\\&quot; feeling but find that the cold sensitivity comes right back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product for anyone not attempting to reduce tooth sensitivity to cold.</li>
    <li> I really like this toothpaste.  It&#x27;s very quickly helped with tooth sensitivity when a lot of other toothpastes designed to help sensitivity haven&#x27;t done as much.  It also has a very mild, good flavor.  I recommend it to anyone.  I actually have a couple friends that swear this toothpaste got rid of cavities for them!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve brushed with sensodyne toothpaste for months suffering with frequent sensitivity despite my best efforts.  My dentist basically told me there was nothing wrong with my teeth and that there was nothing he could do.  After mere days of brushing with this product my sensitivity has seemingly completely disappeared, soups and tea no longer leave me cringing in pain and I can now enjoy the things I used to enjoy.  If you&#x27;ve tried the usual suspects for sensitivity and have been let down give this stuff a shot, it really does work.    The toothpaste itself is a little on the thin side but it certainly doesn&#x27;t drip out the tube on it&#x27;s own, just be careful about how you squeeze it so you don&#x27;t get too much.</li>
    <li> I didnt like some of the ingredients in it.  I try to stay away from fluoride and also fake sugars.</li>
    <li> My sensitive teeth are no longer sensitive,and I can enjoy cold food again.Checkups are great.I recommended it to my dental hygienist,and she ordered it for herself.</li>
    <li> After using it for a month.  I can say that it works very well for tartar control.  Much better than whatever brand that you can get in a store.</li>
    <li> I loved this toothpaste. I&#x27;m so sorry it&#x27;s not for sale anymore. Darn you Glaxosmithkline! You destroyed a great product, and gave us nothing as good to replace it with. I also believe that fluoride, at least partially, inactivates the NovaMin. So far, all the products that Sensodyne sells (in the UK) that have NovaMin also include fluoride. Another cool thing about Dr Collins is you didn&#x27;t rinse it - you left a thin coating on your teeth. You can&#x27;t do that with a fluoride toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for all the good years Dr Collins...&lt;br /&gt;*sniff*  :-(</li>
    <li> This tooth paste works. If you have tooth sensitivity, you know how much it hurts. This tooth paste provides relief. I purchased this tooth paste after eating ice cream left me in such severe pain I could not stand it any longer. I found the recommendations for Orajel Tooth Desensitizer online and I bought it, but my teeth were so sensitive it hurt even to brush them. I thought it would be good to get a tooth paste because I needed to be able to brush my teeth. So I ordered this tooth paste and I will order it again. It works. All I have to do is brush my teeth like normal and I can eat ice cream again. As for the Orajel Tooth Desensitizer save your money it&#x27;s very complicated to apply and it did not work for me.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s such a pain to have to use a fluoride rinse every time I brush my teeth, and I&#x27;m worried that I&#x27;m getting too much fluoride, but THIS PRODUCT DOES NOT WORK WITHOUT FLUORIDE!!!! (Independent clinical studies have demonstrated this over and over).  The good news is, that products that contain BOTH fluoride and Novamin have demonstrated efficacy.    Since Dr. Collin&#x27;s does not have fluoride and no other over-the-counter product currently sold in the US contains Novamin (to my knowledge anyway.... Glaxo-Smith-Kline is purposely sitting on the Novamin patent trying to keep the technology out of the hands of consumers because they want people to buy Sensodyne (which we all know does not work!) GSK does sell a very very expensive Novamin product to dentists who apply the stuff in their office and pass the cost on to you, of course), so my only option seems to be to use fluoride rinse (like ACT), brush with Dr. Collin&#x27;s, and then use the fluoride AGAIN.  The reason you need to use fluoride twice each time you brush is because flouride first needs to coat your teeth in order for the Novamin to rebuild the matrix in your teeth.  The problem is, the act of brushing brushes the fluoride off your teeth, so you need to use the fluoride again immediately after brushing to get maximum benefit from the fluoride treatment.  It would be SO much easier if Dr. Collins made a version of this toothpaste that already had fluoride in it.</li>
    <li> I bought this product a long time ago, but it was one of the best toothpastes I ever used.  I was unaware that it was not available anymore.  I continued to check to see when it was back in stock -- no luck.  I hope another product comes along like this one some day.  It was a great toothpaste.</li>
    <li> I have been using this toothpaste for about 6 weeks now and i have to say Im disappointed..i read all reviews and thought it would work...Okay first id like to say that maybe there is a slight change in whitening but as far as hair line cracks i just noticed i have one more..it doesnt take care of aging teeth as others have said and does not get rid of slight hair line marks in the teeth...I actually noticed one more so i wonder if its making it worse..If you put a light to your teeth you will see the lines crazy and scary.i was praying it would work ..on second tube and nothing...So I have to agree with those that have said that it doesnt work..i dont understand what others are raving about especially the ones that say it works in days...sorry cant compare it does nothing..as far as sensitive..i still have to use sensodyne for that...I wouldnt recommend this sorry i wish i could I was so excited</li>
    <li> I like that it doesn&#x27;t leave a film in my mouth but it only took the edge off of my tooth sensitivity.  The pain is still there everyday, and I&#x27;ve been using this for several months now, 4 and 1/2 to be exact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only paid $6.67 for the tube, so I don&#x27;t understand why it is being sold today for $35 by a particular vendor that is shipping through AMAZON.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works well enough for the $6.67 price, great for mild tooth sensitivity and it is definitely helping the health of my gums, but I wouldn&#x27;t dare pay $35 for it.  If you have severe tooth sensitivity, this will help but you&#x27;ll likely need to use it with other methods of treatment plus inclusion of a pain reliever.  What would I consider severe?  Well, I&#x27;m currently saving up for a very expensive (to me) root canal.  The dentist took a chunk out of my tooth and put a temporary filling in.  Well, I wasn&#x27;t able to save the money as quickly as I had planned (laid off after the dentist drilled; I was 2 months into saving up), so I&#x27;ve had the temporary filling redone twice now and it&#x27;s again wearing away.  I am getting additional relief with oil pulling though so I still use this product in my daily rotation of treatments but am looking for something stronger.  Squigle tooth rebuilder is next on the list.  I&#x27;m trying to get enough relief so that I can feel the irritation but without the intense pain.  I would be satisfied with that, like a cut or burn that has begun healing.  There is slight irritation so you know the injury is still there but is not so painful that it&#x27;s all you think about all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> I have been using the product for about four months now.  To confirm comments made by other reviewers, the toothpaste not only builds enamel but also appears to remove stains/cavities.  I had several cavities forming on my molars which are a lighter brown now than before.  This took about two months to happen.  It also removed staining/enamel damage that was surrounding a white filling.  As other reviewers have said, after brushing you should give about 30 minutes or so before eating or drinking something so that you don&#x27;t wash away the toothpaste.</li>
    <li> This is a very mild tasting toothpaste which I like. It does not have fluoride. I alternate using it with a fluoride toothpaste.</li>
    <li> I normally use Sensodyne and this seems about the same. It&#x27;s a good product, I just didn&#x27;t experience any of the dramatic benefits other people have had. I&#x27;ve used an entire tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s NOT worth $35, the current price, but it is worth $7.50 which is what they normally charge. The Dr. Collins website says that they are reformulating the toothpaste. I&#x27;ll wait for the new product (hopefully sold at a normal price).</li>
    <li> I have been using this toothpaste for a little over a month and I like it A LOT!  My teeth look glossy and white and the sensitivity is gone.  I combine this toothpaste with sensodyne, I floss with a water pik and dental tape 2times per day and I take Dental Essentials Complete supplement 2 times per day.  Everyone comments on how white my teeth are, and I see how shiny they look.  I highly recommend this toothpaste to anyone who is suffering from teeth problems, as I am.  I had my first root canal when my first molar came in, and I&#x27;ve had a lot of dental problems since but this toothpaste combined with the supplement seems to be doing a wonderful work at keeping my teeth nice, white and pain free.  I will be going to the dentist on 4/26 for a check up, I hope is s great one!  I will continue buying this toothpaste.</li>
    <li> okay well, I was hoping to have finally found something to help my teeth that have been abused for years and enamel is worn.  I was at first greatly displeased, because the claims in the description (Rebuilding Enamel) were nowhere on the packaging, figured it for yet another scam.&lt;br /&gt;But, the first time I used it I did notice a positive difference.&lt;br /&gt;One of the things about brushing is that if you have acid problems, flouride toothpaste makes it worse, beacue going from the PH of acid to the PH of flouride softens the enamel, which is then brushed and damaged.&lt;br /&gt;My teeth do feel stronger, seem thicker somehow, I feel ready to smile.&lt;br /&gt;But, oddly I have a sore tooth now, could be just a coindedence, not sensitivity but pressure bothers it, I hope it is not this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;I only have a couple of sensitive spots, I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference with that. I am mostly interested in the enamel building capabilities, which is why i was pretty angry that when I got it there was nothing on the package about rebuilding or remineralizing. For now it seems to be working, probably a cumulative thing, I hope it does work.&lt;br /&gt;Update: Okay, so after some research and trial and error, I have found the following: First, it seems to need flouride to work with.This is what I do, and I have seen results: Brush with regular toothpaste(I use arm and hammer with liquid calcium),spit, don&#x27;t rinse, then add the Dr Collins to the toothbrush, and brush gently. Spit. THEN, flouride rinse (I use crest enamel building), then, take some Dr. collins and rub it onto teeth, front and back, with fingers, and leave on. Warning, the Arm and Hammer is pretty strong, burny even. But, the baking soda seems to neutralize the mouth, and makes the other stuff work better. BEWARE: I did find out that NovaMin works with the calcium in saliva---meaning, make sure you get enough calcium, and the kind that is absorbable (many supplements are not, sadly). Also, it appears to be made with GLASS. I amnot sure how I feel about that....time will tell!</li>
    <li> After trying several tubes in order to &amp;#34;Restore&amp;#34; different components of my teeth, I simultaneously learned about the hard facts of reality and dental care. Most pastes are merely stretches in advertising the very poorly conducted studies by those with a vested interest in sales rather than truth.&lt;br /&gt;Instead, choose a quality fluoride delivery mechanism, shown in studies to be effective and consistent with theory, which most of the major brands already have. Skip the hype in this fluoride-free waste of paste. Sadly disappointed hopeful customer, seeking good toothpastes!</li>
    <li> I much prefer the taste and the clean feeling that I get from the Spry brand (the all time BEST). I&#x27;ve tried every natural brand toothpaste, so I wanted to try this one... but it does not leave as long of a fresh feeling which is important. I also love Marvis brand (Jasmine Mint IS AMAZING) leave such a great aftertaste. Basically try Spry and Marvis. Spry&#x27;s *mouthwash is simply thee best.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, Novamin was purchased by a giant pharma company, and none of the products previously containing it are available in USA anymore. If you are near Canada, you can purchase Sensodyne with Novamin, but Restore and other dentifrices are victims of corporate nonsense.</li>
    <li> This was a great product that kept my teeth white, strong and pain free.  So sad the Novamin is not allowed in the US.</li>
    <li> Very nice toothpaste to help protect the teeth, would recommend it to anyone that has sensitive teeth and want to build the enamel</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;ve only used this product a few times, but it actually worked for me. It cleans my teeth really well and did help me re-mineralize the decalcification spots on my teeth. There&#x27;s one white spot I think it actually got rid of completely as I barely see it at all anymore. Since I haven&#x27;t used this toothpaste long-term I can&#x27;t comment on the long-term effects, but so far I love it and it was well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Doing it&#x27;s job! I&#x27;m so happy I found this product. It helps with plaque and after a week of using tooth sensitivity was minamized.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive teeth due to years of whitening. This stuff makes a noticeable difference in just a matter of days.</li>
    <li> Good toothpaste.  A healthier choice than most others which are loaded with chemicals fluoride, sls, etc...  bought and buying again.</li>
    <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but if I&#x27;m having an uncomfortable feeling or slight pain in the gums or teeth, I can brush with this and it will subside within a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fluoride free is also a huge bonus. I use this exclusively and love it.</li>
    <li> Loved this, but when I went to reorder it was super expensive.  I have not found it elsewhere.  If you have, shoot me a comment.  I&#x27;d love to get it again.</li>
    <li> I was shocked to find that Dr. Collins Restore was no longer available. I did a quick google search and apparently Glaxosmithkline (a pharmaceutical company) bought out NovaMin in 2010, and shortly thereafter no one could find anything with NovaMin in it. After spending an hour researching online, I discovered that EVERY SINGLE PRODUCT that contained NovaMin has been pulled in America. Not just Dr. Collins Restore, but other products called SootheRX, Oravive, and Burt&#x27;s Bees toothpaste have also disappeared. Do a google search for any of those products and you&#x27;ll see. Burt&#x27;s Bees quit making toothpaste altogether, buy up what&#x27;s left while you can! There is only one NovaMin toothpaste still being produced in America: Topex ReNew. It sucks because it has fluoride and soap in it, but I still ordered 1 tube at the great cost of $32. Once this supply is gone, it won&#x27;t be around anymore either. I still wanted to tell you about it though, because GSK has no right to keep NovaMin from us. If I kept this stock all to myself I&#x27;d be just as bad as them. I hate giving them money but I&#x27;m between a rock and a hard place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the FDA has NOT banned NovaMin. GSK is holding NovaMin hostage as a marketing gimmick instead of releasing this tooth-saving treatment. Could you imagine if an HIV medicine company witheld life-saving HIV medication in Africa because they could make more money elsewhere? That&#x27;s what GSK is doing! GSK could allow other companies like Dr. Collins to use NovaMin but they won&#x27;t! They sell NovaMin in Europe but not the USA. They blame the FDA but all GSK has to do is rename their Sensodyne paste to not use the word &amp;#34;repair&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glaxosmithkline is evil and is out to get us. Anything that helps Americans stay healthy hurts their bottom line. The money GSK would make from sales of NovaMin toothpaste would not be more than the money they make from dental treatments and prescriptions after your mouth goes to pieces. Here is a small list of the dental products GSK sells in America:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Aquafresh (soapy toothpaste which can cause dry mouth)&lt;br /&gt;- Biotene (dry mouth treatment)&lt;br /&gt;- Gly-Oxide (irritation treatment)&lt;br /&gt;- Polident (denture cleaning)&lt;br /&gt;- Poligrip (denture glue)&lt;br /&gt;- Sensodyne (sensitivity)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very interesting that they sell the cause and the cure, not to mention denture fixatives! After you lose all your teeth, you can give GSK more money to glue your fake teeth in. Then when you&#x27;re depressed from being toothless, you can take Paxil and Wellbutrin, also from GSK. Shame on drug companies for doing this to us. Shame on us for letting them!! Until American consumers wake up and start taking care of our own health, these vultures will continue to circle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, here are a few tooth strengthening products I&#x27;ve found that are still available besides Topex Renew: MI Paste (aka GC Tooth Mousse), Squigle Tooth Builder Sensitive, Coral White Toothpaste, and of course, a proper diet full of colloidal minerals, calcium, magnesium, vitamin K, boron, zinc, and vitamin D. If you avoid refined flours and sugars, eat plenty of fresh, raw veggies and fruits, and eat sprouted beans and seeds, you&#x27;ll have a great body system to rebuild teeth, not to mention prevent getting diabetes (guess who makes Avandia, the diabetes drug? yep, you guessed it!). I also recommend a toothbrush with tapered bristles like Perio Brush, abcOralCare Ranhee 5, or Colgate Slim Soft Pro Tip. Good luck to you and your mouth!the dental products GSK sells in America:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Aquafresh (soapy toothpaste which can cause dry mouth)&lt;br /&gt;- Biotene (dry mouth treatment)&lt;br /&gt;- Gly-Oxide (irritation treatment)&lt;br /&gt;- Polident (denture cleaning)&lt;br /&gt;- Poligrip (denture glue)&lt;br /&gt;- Sensodyne (sensitivity)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very interesting that they sell the cause and the cure, not to mention denture fixatives!

    <li> This toothpaste is terrific.  I brush with it and keep some packed up around a bridge that has some trouble spots.  I&#x27;m trying to save my teeth and bridge.  This toothpaste has made my teeth much less sensitive and there are no more stains.  My gums feel a lot better than they ever had before and my mouth feels at ease.  I used to get a lot of stains because I drink a lot of coffee and my teeth are a nice tooth color instead of a lot of stains.  It is being reformulated with a comparable ingredient to Novamin since the Novamin will no longer be in Restore Toothpaste.  Dr Collins facebook page says it will be out in September.  This toothpaste also helps to keep the mouth environment at an alkaline ph and so keeps acids from forming and keeps the good bacteria in and kills the bad bacteria.</li>
    <li> This might be a fine product, but it was sent with a sticker over the freshness date.  When I peeled back the sticker it said&lt;br /&gt;use before 7/2013!  Not very reassuring when this is something going into your mouth!  Also box it was packaged in was broken and the toothpaste tube was falling out.  Would NOT recommend buying this toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Hard to say is it really better than other, but I like to use it. It creates pleasant heat on the tooth surface when applied. Much cheaper on Ebay, no idea why sellers sell on such exorbitant prices. Recommend it.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my Dentist ... I need it for high sensitivity ... it helps! ... the taste if fine and my teeth are clean!</li>
    <li> this seems to do as it&#x27;s promoted to, and it&#x27;s a great-tasting toothpaste to boot.  My daughter also loves it.</li>
    <li> I started using this toothpaste when I got my last cavity (2 years ago; clean since then). It seems amazon doesn&#x27;t have it directly at this time but luckily I bought 2 tubes last time :). I use this toothpaste (only this one) with a sonicare brush. The flavor is almost nonexistent compared to other toothpastes which I like. My dentist always compliments me on how healthy and clean my teeth are. They may not be straight but even I admit they are much cleaner than they used to be. It&#x27;s probably mostly due to the brush itself but this toothpaste seems to have helped me with some sensitivity issues as well. All in all, I think it&#x27;s best to have a good brushing habit and brush everyday.</li>
    <li> This product really worked for my sensitive teeth. What an improvement over the other toothpastes I&#x27;ve tried for sensitivity.  I was especially pleased that it has the bonus of being MADE IN THE USA!! Thanks to the company for making a product that works, and for making the product here instead of China. A big thumbs up for me.</li>
    <li> This has been a great toothpaste. It whitens, reduces sensitivity, forms a barrier over the exposed dentin and does all it claims. However, I am switching to a different brand with Novamin because Restore doesn&#x27;t have any fluoride.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Novamin is the active ingredient in Dr. Collins Restore Toothpaste that makes it so stellar. Novamin is essentially tiny glass silica particles that bond with essential elements in your saliva, after which your teeth absorb the newly formed compound, which then encapsulates the sensitive bits and exposed dentin in your teeth, making them impervious to the elements that upset them. To receive the maximum benefit of any product with Novamin it is VERY important to not rinse or eat for half an hour after you brush. The toothpaste must interact with your saliva over time to be absorbed into your teeth. Additionally when you first begin using this or any other Novamin product after having used traditional sensitivity toothpastes you will experience a few days of increased sensitivity while your teeth lose their protection from traditional potassium nitrate sensitivity toothpastes and begin to acquire protection from the Novamin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Novamin has been used in Britain, Europe, and Asia for several years now in mainstream toothpastes with astonishing results. Sensodyne brand here in America just bought the patent rights to the Novamin technology and will be issuing a line of Novamin toothpaste here in the states soon. Until that is available you can order their line of Novamin Sensodyne from other countries here on Amazon: [[ASIN:B008VPSTOA Sensodyne Repair &amp; Protect Whitening Toothpaste 75ml]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I certainly understand that some people have a fluoride sensitivity and Dr. Collins Restore is a better choice for them. For the rest of us, there is no reason to lose the benefits of Fluoride just to get the benefits of Novamin. The Sensodyne line offers both. Whichever line you choose, remember don&#x27;t rinse or eat for half an hour after application!f an hour after application!</li>
    <li> it tastes very cheap like a dollar store toothpaste, i noticed a slight protection. but restoring mouthwash did the trick for me. also i HATE the pasrt that it is small, expensive, and wears out quick.</li>
    <li> This whitening toothpaste works SO WELL!  I love it!  I can&#x27;t seem to find it anywhere to buy it again though :(</li>
    <li> This toothpaste does everything it says it will (I guess it better for the price - yikes!). I do wish it was cheaper but I truly feel it&#x27;s worth it. I could tell the difference in the whiteness and smoothness of my teeth within a week. It also helps tremendously with sensitivity. I have now used it for two and a half weeks and will definitely buy more when needed. I highly recommend this toothpaste and am thrilled Amazon is carrying it!</li>
    <li> There are no magical toothpastes in the world to fill up cavities but this one did its best to cure my teeth sensitivity on top of the cavities, but i have more problems than just that. can&#x27;t say i regret buying it. It did what it promised to do.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive teeth and have floride sensitivity, so it is super hard for me to find a toothpaste that will work for me.  This is the only toothpaste in YEARS, that hasn&#x27;t caused me issues.  I have less sensitivity \\&quot;outbreaks\\&quot; and it is floride free.  This toothpaste has actually helped restore holes in my teeth.  This is worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I like that it doesn&#x27;t have any floride but i haven&#x27;t really seen a change as far as whitening but its ok, i&#x27;d buy it again.......</li>
    <li> Did not see or feel any difference.</li>
    <li> I liked it better when it cost 7$ but the price was recently increased. 35$ for it is way too much. It is not worth it. I&#x27;m very disappointed and not buying it anymore..</li>
    <li> great toothpaste that&#x27;s currently being reformulated</li>
    <li> It was no big deal. It helped a little but I&#x27;m not a scientist and there were many factors involved.</li>
    <li> I have two chipped teeth in front that have been fairly sensitive lately - even when not eating/drinking anything, but the intensity of the sensitivity started to fade after a few days, and after about a week I&#x27;m able to run my tongue over the chipped areas without pain.</li>
    <li> If you want to see exposed roots or damaged enamel turn white again, give it a try.  It does more than I expected.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for nearly 3 months and have see no improvements with my tooth sensitivity, nor has it whitened my teeth at all. Won&#x27;t buy this toothpaste again.</li>
    <li> I bought this to help with my yellow coffee stained teeth and to try to remineralize the calcium deposits that are on my front teeth. I just finished my first tube and on the second one. It doesn&#x27;t do anything for my teeth at all for the price. And if I use a whitening product, my teeth are still sensitive. I will not make another purchase and go back to my regular toothpaste.</li>
    <li> This is as good as GC mi toothpaste,only here you get bigger size and better price,try it ! My white interproximal decalcified  spots ( after braces ) faded a little when using this toothpaste.</li>
    <li> It is effective in somewhat on recalcifying the teeth. However if they are not using fluoride you would think they would opt out of the added glycerin since both impair the remineralization of the teeth:-) Doesn&#x27;t seem logical to me. I have started using the MI paste from my dentist which calcifies the teeth as well, and it is extremely potent compared to this stuff. Wish I would have started using the MI paste sooner. Im not sure if the MI paste has the glycerin or not, but it does work. You can order the MI paste in fluoridated or non fluoridated. I would suggest skipping this stuff and ordering the MI paste from the dentist.</li>
    <li> Not overly excited about this product but will keep for now. In fact, after my first use it made my gums a little sensitive for some reason. Very Fast Shipping from Seller:-)</li>
    <li> I have been dealing with tooth sensitivity for as long as I can remember.  It eventually got so bad that I couldn&#x27;t even chew on one side of my mouth.  Drinking or eating anything hot or cold was also extremely painful.  After confirming with the dentist that it was nothing serious, he told me to try sensodyne.  Well sensodyne did not work for me so I came on amazon and discovered this product.  This product is amazing!  After about one and a half to two weeks of using twice a day my sensitivity was gone.  I&#x27;m amazed at how fast this product works and how effectively.  I can eat hot and cold foods again without any problem at all.  I still can&#x27;t believe it.  If you&#x27;ve tried sensodyne and had no results, you have to try this!</li>
    <li> I am not going to get into the science and the arguments for/against the science involved here. I will just share my positive experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had switched jobs and was waiting on the Dental insurance to kick in when I developed cavity related pain in my tooth (cavity was not visible but I could tell from the pain the tooth was decaying.) I had some 15 days left in the insurance to kick in thought about riding the pain out. I did some searches online and got to this paste. I ordered it on prime shipment and started using it. In my case, it certainly did help with the pain (which sort of disappeared) and I was able to ride it out. I did enjoy the taste (I hate the mint taste in toothpastes) and I could tell that it helped with tooth sensitivity (though I do not have very sensitive teeth).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not advise you to delay getting dental care if you develop a tooth ache (hypocritical I guess) but if you find yourself in a bind, give this a shot. I doubt it will actually heal your decay but it could buy you some time.</li>
    <li> I bought this based on the raving reviews thinking that it would be the ultimate toothpaste. However, on one of my teeth, it actually made it more sensitive (to cold). At the same time, I heard that glycerin coats the teeth and prevents remineralization and soon discovered that this toothpaste has glycerin. I used another kind of tooth powder (Eco-Dent brand) and within a day, my sensitive tooth felt better. Eco-Dent does not have glycerin. Eco-dent is a good tooth powder in my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also just ordered Coral White Toothpaste but have not received it yet. It has a lot of positive reviews as well. The product has natural ingredients with NO glycerin, SLS, or fluoride. It does have hydrogen peroxide which, from what I&#x27;ve read is good as the oxygen from the H2O2 kills anaerobic bacteria and of course the coral calcium which is supposed to add calcium to the teeth via mineralization. I will be interested in trying this out. I liked Eco-Dent but want to give this Coral White a try too based on the reviews and ingredients.</li>
    <li> I tried Restore for a couple of weeks, then finished my Sensodyne for a couple of weeks, then tried the Restore again for a couple of weeks.  I have lost most of my enamel and have teeth sensitivity which is completely relieved by Sensodyne, though I don&#x27;t like the fact that it&#x27;s a commercial, unnatural toothpaste with sodium fluoride, a manufacturing waste product.  I tried Restore first and had serious problems.  It made my teeth extremely sensitive and I had two toothaches deep down in the gums in two separate areas.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve had a toothache since I was a kid.  I don&#x27;t think this was part of a healing process where it gets worse before it gets better.  In any case, it definitely doesn&#x27;t help build enamel.  I&#x27;m now using a natural toothpaste, Dessert Essence, which has no effect on tooth sensitivity which is fine as long as I don&#x27;t eat much acid fruit, vinegar salad dressing, champagne, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Restore does have a nice peppermint flavor, which I usually don&#x27;t like, but that&#x27;s the only positive thing I can say about it.  If you have any pain or sensitivity, switch to another toothpaste immediately.  You can then switch back when the problem goes away to confirm your suspicions.  I think this product should be taken off the market.  There is an element of risk here.</li>
    <li> After reading reviews about this toothpaste i decided to give it a chance. And boy was I glad I tried this one. After using it the first time i instantly felt a difference after brushing my teeth!!! it just feels cleaner and makes them feel good. I know all this sounds cheesy but it&#x27;s true! two thumbs up on this one folks</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for a week, so I haven&#x27;t seen any miraculous differences yet.  One positive thing is that it tastes really good...like a spearmint flavor.  My young daughter already had 3 cavities, so we are willing to try anything to help her.  Hope it works like most of the reviews say it will!</li>
    <li> Great, would buy it again</li>
    <li> It does what it says.  Takes about four months to see results, though.  Only thing is I am finding that I have some sensitivity with a couple of my fillings... I don&#x27;t really know what to attribute that to, but I doubt it&#x27;s the toothpaste.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is great. The flavor is pleasant and my mouth feels clean without the burning sensation like most toothpastes leave after using.</li>
    <li> I am opposed to fluoride and this by far beats sensodine, which has fluoride, and does not work for my gum sensitivity after a week of use. RESTORE WORKED THE DAY I STARTED USING IT!!! I totally recommend this product for those with sensitive teeth and gums!</li>
    <li> It is surprising how well this toothpaste feels and o know I am not overdosing on fluoride makes me happy. I haven&#x27;t used this long enough to evaluate its performance but I will write an update in the future.</li>
    <li> This is great for sensitive teeth. I wanted a fluoride free formula as I don&#x27;t believe fluoride should be any where near your mouth. Way better than sensodyne for sensitivity and wish you could get it in all retail stores.</li>
    <li> So...the first day of using this I want to say one thing....THANK YOU for not making this toothpaste the strong mint flavor of other toothpastes. I can comfortable use this without having a disgusting taste in my mouth. (Allowing me to brush longer)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also went ahead and bought the Dr. Collins toothbrushes because soft brushes sound very nice to sensitive teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will be having 4 Wisdom teeth pulled very soon....and a couple crowns, and some fillings in the future...hopefully with this, along with better hygiene I won&#x27;t have any future problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;^ Why do I have so many problems? Did not go to the dentist for many years because I wasn&#x27;t covered under any insurance without having to travel hours away. The dentist&#x27;s &lt;-- Multiple....I see now are so much better it&#x27;s remarkable, and recommended me \\&quot;MI Paste\\&quot; which I believe this is.Something to rebuild the surface, and help remove the plaque at the top of teeth. (which causes cracks, and cavities)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far... I love the low cost, and the taste. It&#x27;s slightly mint, but not nearly as strong as most brands, so you&#x27;ll have nice breath just not toxic mint breath :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ /  ★ ★ ★ ★ ★  (Subject to change of course)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Update 1: So I got this paste on January 2nd, and have used it solely since. (I&#x27;m not the best at taking care of my teeth, and don&#x27;t brush twice a day, and sometimes skip days, i&#x27;m thin and look good, but hygiene is hard to keep up with for me because of my irregular sleeping patterns, and habbits)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I wanted to say, shortly after getting this paste (about half a week later) I got 4 wisdom teeth cut out. With the soft brush, and this paste, I actually brushed my teeth the day after with minimal pain. (Actually barely had any pain at all, just couldn&#x27;t speak for half a day because of a numb tongue. Haha. 2nd day I was eating solid foods surprisingly, and was not dependent on medication at all. Very odd, but awesomefor me...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;back to the product, keep in mind I don&#x27;t use anything else besides this paste. Not sure if that&#x27;s good or not, but I&#x27;ve noticed two things. My teeth are whiter, and much less plaque on the surface. Also, the Dr. Collins soft brush acts like floss. (I don&#x27;t floss, because it&#x27;s odd to stick string between my teeth and cut my gums *ouch*), so in combination it&#x27;s like perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I can tell with my tongue when plaque is beginning to build behind my teeth, when I brush using this paste + brush it seems to be removed. (basically how your teeth feel after getting them cleaned at a dentist) Sort of rough on the backside (not as smooth) because the plaque is scraped away. Except now I can do this myself, which normal toothpaste/brushes did not do at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You also may find it odd..using a soft brush in combination with this paste to clean teeth, doesn&#x27;t it make more sense to use a hard brush to scrape away the bad stuff? No idea, but as a theory, I think hard brushes do more damage to the part of the gum line where your teeth meet than most people realize, and this area is where cavities typically form. (only reason I bought this product was because I was suggested \\&quot;MI Paste\\&quot; to \\&quot;Restore\\&quot; what I damaged over the years with soda, and most likely hard brushes and incorrect flossing. Anyway, I LOVE using a soft brush, and this paste...it&#x27;s like now instead of brushing being a nasty (hate mint) painful brush as fast as you can experience, it&#x27;s more of a gentle, relaxing, refreshing sensation that I don&#x27;t have to worry about. (although I do believe I need to brush more often) xD&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(This is from someone who drank MTN dew for ~6 years straight, and brushed a couple times a week..., my teeth were not horrible, and did not look bad, but internally, some were cracked (deep cavities) although no pain, and the very tops of each tooth had a layer of yellow plaque which essentially was solid. (also didn&#x27;t have dental insurance and did not go to the dentist for over 6 years) So for someone like to me to actually \\&quot;like\\&quot; a pretty inexpensive toothpaste, and toothbrush...is something to consider.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;^ I also do not work for this Dr. Collins guy, no idea who he is. haha, this just came up when I typed MI Paste, and was inexpensive. ♡ (poor, starving, college kid xD)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;----------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: Parents...if your children do not like Mint, or Brushing their teeth...I highly suggest a \\&quot;soft brush\\&quot; and a toothpaste like this. This does have a slight mint taste, but not nearly as strong, and does give refreshing breath without the need of the disgusting mint flavor ruining an hour of your day. xD (I remember after brushing I would hate to eat or drink, because of that mint taste mixed in, eww!) Also, if you don&#x27;t understand what I mean, consider the taste of food you dislike, or a type of fruit, and imagine that was your toothpaste. That&#x27;s how I feel about mint, and mouthwash...it&#x27;s just disgusting, when the main objective is not to taste or eat, it&#x27;s to protect teeth. ✔&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note 2: I wonder why no company has come out with a \\&quot;long lasting\\&quot; paste or gel. Since teeth are simply solid objects used for chewing, you would think \\&quot;someone\\&quot; would be able to create a way to keep the teeth and gums healthy over a longer period of time. (not waste time twice a day) In this day and age, I&#x27;d expect some sort of gel that could last a week... ✔&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note 3: Since my latest visit to the Dentist there&#x27;s been some changes everyone should know about. There are \\&quot;White Fillings\\&quot; so no need to have your entire mouth filled with grey ugly stuff. There are white caps that are not noticeable. There are replacement teeth that are not noticeable. There&#x27;s better ways to whiten your teeth. And getting Wisdom teeth taken out has been improved dramatically. Instead of having \\&quot;open sockets\\&quot; which cause pain, bleeding, and infection, theyactually can stitch up parts with dissolving stitches that go away after around a week. So the \\&quot;pain factor\\&quot; is gravely reduced, and experienced no swelling either. (All 4 of my wisdom teeth were causing extreme pain and headaches, the top two I cracked because there was no room, they came in razer sharp, and were cutting my gums, and the bottom two had not even appeared, one was actually sideways putting pressure against teeth with fillings causing major pain) There is also &#x27;laser&#x27; gum line repair which is painless as well. (Just updating everyone on the new technology dentists have available, no more grey in your mouth!) ✔&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;------------------------------------------------------------</li>
    <li> This is the best product by far that I have ever used.  This is a thick sticky paste, don&#x27;t use water on your brush, just use it on the brush dry so that it will move onto your teeth and let your siliva provide the moisture.  I don&#x27;t rinse it off, I just spit the excess out and let the rest sit on my teeth for 10 - 15 minutes before I rince.  I was testing to see if this would make a new cavity go away, and it did, I wish I would have taken pictures.  But my teeth are whiter and the little cavity is gone, so I am sold and will continue to buy this product.</li>
    <li> I was floored by the amount they wanted to repair the baby teeth of my 5 year old. $3000! Yes, I know all about the possibility of decayed teeth infecting adult teeth, but really. I could see exactly what the dentist was talking about. The most noticeable was between her two front teeth, outside of one of her incisors, between two back molars and one on the outside of her back molar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  We are brushing with Restore twice and day. We floss as well, and used Spry mints occasionally between meals. We are on a second tube of Restore, and it is really working. She had a brown hole on the outside of her incisor, that is almost gone. The brown decayed area between her two front teeth is gone. The area between her two molars is way better and almost gone. The back molar was the worst of all and is still there, but has become a lot smaller and lighter in color. Her teeth look great. It is not just whitening the areas, but repairing them. This stuff is for real. Most dentist will tell you that some teeth take far longer to fall out than others and if they are decayed, they can infect other teeth. They believe, and it may be true with some children, that the tooth infected will continue to decay and then rot. This may be true to some extent, but I am a firm believer that with Restore, it will not be a problem. I really feel that a lot of dentist play in this gray area, which they are \\&quot;technically\\&quot; correct, but it may not really be necessary.  They will never tell you about stuff like this, that is for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  We are in the process of looking for another dentist, and I will update with any future info.</li>
    <li> I have bad teeth, and I purchased this product because it contains NovaMin. After a few days of use, I would recommend the product to people for whom taste and mouth-feel are important. The taste is mild and very tolerable, and the texture when you brush is pleasant as well. I can&#x27;t speak to the anti-cavity aspect of the product, but it does leave my teeth feeling very polished and sensitivity-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, since it doesn&#x27;t contain fluoride, I would hesitate to recommend using this as your only re-mineralizing dental care product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final verdict: Recommended based on taste and feel. Use in conjunction with a fluoride dental product.</li>
    <li> I went from a normal multicare toothpaste to this because it&#x27;s one of the few toothpastes available that has Novamin in it.  I had heard Novamin helps rebuild (albeit temporarily) tooth enamel and, though I have fairly health teeth, I thought it was a good way to keep them stronger longer.  However, after using it for a few weeks, I found that, not only did it seem to make my teeth more sensitive, it failed to keep them feeling clean for more than a few hours at best.  I suppose if you have an issue with Fluoride (I did not) it would be a useful producct to have.</li>
    <li> The sensitivity in my teeth are no longer an issue. I have been using this product for a while now. It keeps my mouth fresh and my gums healty. I am unable to assess whether the product whitens teeth though.</li>
    <li> I found nothing special about this toothpaste. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of months now, and let me tell you, I&#x27;ve noticed no difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth have not become any whiter. I guess that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ll say first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tooth sensitivity does go away if you use this, but it takes a pretty long time before it alleviates the sensitivity. It took me about a week using twice a day before there was any difference in my tooth sensntivity, and before you use it that long it effing HURTS to use this on sensitive areas!!! Be warned!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does not cure tooth sensitivity. If you don&#x27;t brush your teeth with this or accidentally fall asleep one night before brushing come the next time you brush your teeth you&#x27;ll be right back to square one-- crazy pain! This has happened to me multiple times now. Be warned!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The worst thing about this product: It does NOT restore in any way. I don&#x27;t know why this is called &amp;#34;restore&amp;#34;, but it doesn&#x27;t restore teeth at all. Nothing on the packaging or the tube mentions restoring enamel, nothing, and I haven&#x27;t noticed any miracles yet. It annoys me that the description of this product on here talks and talks about how this will restore enamel, when in actuality, that&#x27;s not even what it is designed to do. What a joke. I would not recommend this product just because of that fact alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be fooled. I spent almost thirty bucks on two of these tubes with fast shipping, for nothing!</li>
    <li> Contains no flouride and I though it would be a good product because after extensive research on flouride-free dental care, I found that Dr. Collins is one of the foremost experts on the subject. However, his toothpaste is a huge disappointment. Filled with artificial foaming agents and chemicals, I went out the next day after using this toothpaste and purchased Tom&#x27;s of Maine which has been far far superior and free of harsh chemicals found in the Dr. Collins Restore paste. If you&#x27;re looking for flouride-free as well as something more natural, with fewer chemicals then this is not the paste for you. However, if you don&#x27;t mind the chemicals but are only interested in flouride free, then go for it.</li>
    <li> I bought this about 6 weeks ago and have waited to do my review because I wanted to give it a chance to work for me, and, as it turns out, it hasn&#x27;t. I have decalcified spots on my teeth from where I had braces, and the Novamin in this product is supposed to work wonders on them. I took before pictures and started using this as one user suggested and brushing my teeth with &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; toothpaste first and then with Restore afterward, just spitting and not rinsing so that the Novamin could really sit on my teeth and work. But it doesn&#x27;t work. None of the spots have changed, my teeth were not any less sensitive, and they certainly aren&#x27;t any whiter. I&#x27;m not sure what this is supposed to restore, but I&#x27;d settle for the $7 I wasted on it being restored to my wallet, if you know what I mean ;].</li>
    <li> If you suffer from sensitive teeth at all you definitely want to purchase this.  This is hands down the best toothpaste I have ever used.  I have tried lots of different products out there hoping for good results and wind up coming short when they didn&#x27;t help me at all.  So on a whim I tried Dr. Collins and after a couple weeks the sensitivity in my teeth are completely gone.  This product is definitely a life saver.</li>
    <li> I would rate this paste excellent just because I like how it feels in my mouth;- order than that, it&#x27;s a complete rubbish in terms of what it proposed to do. It does nothing, my teeth are the same in every way and even more sensitive than they ever were.</li>
    <li> Love this toothpaste.  Received a free tube as a trial, and loved it.  it leaves your teeth squeaky clean, and light mint flavor isn&#x27;t overpowering.  My dental technician has little work to do on my cleanings because this works so great.  Will keep on buying it.  Too bad I can&#x27;t find it in the grocery store isle.</li>
    <li> Take it for what its worth but after switching to this toothpaste, I had 2 cavities on my next dentist visit.  I go every 6  months, never had a problem before.  Could be coincidence, could be the toothpaste.  My tooth sensitivity also went up for 2 days after switching, then subsided. Ive gone back to my sensodyne.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s actually &amp;#34;restoring&amp;#34; but it works well as my everyday toothpaste.  I am going to continue to use.</li>
    <li> Like toothpaste but not sure I will purchase a second time</li>
    <li> I used to have terrible discomfort with hot and cold foods and thought there was nothing I could do. I tried a bunch of sensitive tooth products and nothing helped long term and most tasted awful. I found the Restore and won&#x27;t use anything else. All of the discomfort in my mouth is gone. My teeth feel healthier than they ever have! I highly recommend doing the subscribe and save on this so you don&#x27;t even have to think about replacement tubes - they just show up!</li>
    <li> The toothpaste is very effective to cure sensitive tooth.  Thumbs Up.  The downfall is the expiry date is too near  ie. July 2013 and I bought in May 2013 for 4 tubes.</li>
    <li> The use of any toothpaste is a good thing, this one just has the ability to restore the enamel loset from normal ware... (according to Dr. Collins).</li>
    <li> I have been using Dr. Collins Restore toothpaste for over a year now, and I have noticed a definite reduction in the sensitivity of my teeth. At my last checkup and cleaning even the hygienist mentioned my teeth seemed less sensitive. When I talked to my dentist he said that the Nova-Min additive in Dr. Collins Restore is a patented ingredient and really does work and I should continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;My method for use is this: At bedtime 1. brush with regular toothpaste and rinse mouth thoroughly. 2. Brush again with a very small amount of Dr. Collins Restore and spit out but do not rinse. Do not eat or drink anything. Go to bed.</li>
    <li> I bought a 4-pack of Crest Pro Health toothpaste at Costco.  I normally buy regular Crest paste but thought&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d try it. After the first use I was so disgusted by how gritty and junky is tasted (it was like sand in my mouth)as well as by the artificial color. I tossed all four tubes.  So much for my savings.  Thus began my quest for a better, healthier, more natural toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After some research online I narrowed to Restore, Sensodyne, and Squigle.  I got a sample of Sensodyne from my dentist and like the taste and effectiveness of it but thought I&#x27;d order something different to try another brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the taste (fresh but not overwhelming - it doesn&#x27;t taste artificial) and how clean my teeth feel after using Restore.  It gets really foamy which I&#x27;m not too sure how I feel about.  I&#x27;ll check back in with a follow up soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like this SO MUCH better than regular national brand toothpastes.  I&#x27;m going to try Squigle when this runs out but I&#x27;m glad I decided to stop using the junky ones.</li>
    <li> Restore Toothpaste, for me, seems to work fine--no painful brushing and a nice fresh taste. The real test is when I go to my six-month check-up next month. I&#x27;ll update my review afterwards. . . .</li>
    <li> Used this toothpaste for a year, went to dentist and had 6 cavities after the year.  I would not recommend going without fluoride.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this since my sensitive teeth aren&#x27;t being helped by using sensodyne and colgate sensitive and other toothpastes that say they can relieve pain and help you teeth. I wasn&#x27;t disappointed, while it is a little pricey, it does actually help ease the pain and while still too early to tell, my teeth feel much better than just before I started using it. It seems to be working so far, hopefully it will continue to protect and reduce the sensitivity on my teeth so I can eat normally and not worry about the pain anymore.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to use instead of the discontinued \\&quot;enamel-on\\&quot; toothpaste, as I understand this is basically the replacement for it.  I had purchased some a few years ago, and it was made in China, so I let the company know I would not be purchasing any more unless it was an American made product, and I didn&#x27;t.  They now do make it in the USA, so and I am back as a customer. This is supposed to build up instead of wear down the enamel, and it is fluoride free.</li>
    <li> This tastes fine, I cant tell if it is helping my teeth or not. I bought MI Paste for immediate results and I guess Im kind of using this stuff as a maintainance product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this toothpast because my dental hygienist said I am losing Calcium from some of my teeth.  I have just had the past for a week now so, I don&#x27;t know if it is helping.  I do know that it has a nice flavor and consistency.  I will continue to use it until my next 6 month checkup.  If, there has been no change, I will definitely write another review with that information.</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste! It tastes great and has much more benefits than over the counter brands. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is a good product. My teeth feel great and I highly recommend this to someone with sensitive teeth. I read comments of it being runny, which concerned me though I purchased anyway. Well, it wasn&#x27;t runny at all so I&#x27;m not sure why people would say it is. It was just as thick as any other toothpaste out there.</li>
    <li> Hopefully my review will help at least one person out that is confused about what to buy.  I divided this into two parts, my opinion &amp; then the more informative part..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been lazy about my teeth for awhile now, &amp; it&#x27;s definitely starting to show.  So I searched information on remineralizing teeth which led me to Dr. Collins Restore toothpaste.  First off I love the intensity of the mint because it&#x27;s not over powering.  At first I thought it was strange (not in a bad way) because I was use to my crest toothpaste.  Recently I was at a friend&#x27;s &amp; used her toothpaste (crest) &amp; I noticed that afterwards I felt like there was a disgusting coating covering my teeth.  When my teeth rubbed together it gave me that nails on the chalkboard kind of feeling.  I love that Dr. Collins doesn&#x27;t give me that coating, I had never noticed a coating when I was using crest but now that I&#x27;ve switched I won&#x27;t go back. I have also read reviews complaining about the consistancey of this toothpaste but I think it&#x27;s the same as any other toothpaste.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this toothpaste is that it&#x27;s not sold in stores.  When my Dr. Collins toothpaste runs out I&#x27;m going to try Burt&#x27;s Bees Natural toothpaste ([[ASIN:B003FWQ0JA Toothpaste - Whitening Fluoride Free - 4 oz - Paste]])I&#x27;ve read pretty good things about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I researched for about 3 hours information on teeth, saliva, enzymes, &amp; tarter... everything.  I found that calcium &amp; phosphate are natural building blocks of teeth &amp; bone &amp; would be crucial to remineralize teeth. Saliva is also a critical factor in protecting teeth because of the ions &amp; enzymes it contains to ward off bacteria &amp; tarter. &#x27;Our bodies support remineralizing teeth as long as there are minerals available to send as needed.  Saliva carries calcium and phosphates to the sites of demineralization naturally.  But the mouth can only compensate so much when it&#x27;s over taken with bacteria and plaque for too long.&#x27;*  I found two things to aid in the remineralization of teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1)  Recaldent - Also known as:  Amorphous calcium phosphate (CPP-ACP)&lt;br /&gt;  Recaldent contains calcium, phosphate, &amp; fluoride ions which combined with water make these ions bioavailable (Becomes available for your body to use). - I couldn&#x27;t find too much info on how recaldent works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2)  NovaMin - Also known as:  Calcium sodium phosphosilicate&lt;br /&gt;  NovaMin particles combine with water and saliva (when one brushes their teeth) to form calcium &amp; phosphorus ions.  The silica then helps the calcium and phosphorus ions adhere to the surface of the teeth to form a crystalized layer (it puts the missing minerals back into the teeth).  When in contact with saliva, these ions continue to be released for hours even after brushing.  Dr. Collins toothpaste also has a high alkaline level, which makes a suitable environment for NovaMin, and combats corrosive acids from demineralizing teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also found that chewing gum that contains xylitol is also beneficial.  Bacteria in the mouth cannot ferment xylitol or use it as an energy source; stopping the growth &amp; production of new bacteria.  When xylitol is in the mouth it starves the bacteria allowing the mouth to remineralize teeth with less interruption.  When picking out a xylitol gum make sure xylitol is the first ingredient listed, or one of the first few ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Products containing Recaldent&lt;br /&gt;- Trident XTRA Care&lt;br /&gt;- Tooth Mousse&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Products containing NovaMin:&lt;br /&gt;- Topex Renew Toothpaste&lt;br /&gt;- Nupro NUsolutions&lt;br /&gt;- Dr. Collins Restore&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Xylitol&lt;br /&gt;- Mentos Pure White Chewing Gum&lt;br /&gt;- Peelu Chewing Gum with Xylitol&lt;br /&gt;- Trident Sugar Free GumMentos Pure White Chewing Gum&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~&lt;br /&gt;Ihope my review helped you guys out, if you have any questions feel free to ask :)&lt;br /&gt;~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(the link below is an awesome article I found that helped me out alot)&lt;br /&gt;* [...]~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~    (the link below is an awesome article I found that helped me out alot)  * [...]</li>
    <li> I like this toothpaste.  I didn&#x27;t really notice any whitening, but I like the idea of what this product does and I would purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I bought this after having a pretty severe case of sensitive teeth. I also have these tiny white spots on my teeth. After checking the web, I learned that fluoride isn&#x27;t necessarily the best way to reminerarlize your teeth, and that Novamin is a great alternative (some say better) for people with sensitive teeth. Although I&#x27;m only a week into it&#x27;s use, I&#x27;m please with the taste and cleaning power.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a shame this is available state side anymore but novamin is the best stuff out there</li>
    <li> Toothpaste tastes great.  Looking at it long term to see how things change.  I will report back after a month.</li>
    <li> Really good toothpaste. The whitening and polishing was a surprise. I&#x27;ll buy this product again. Not sure about the restore part as its too early to tell.</li>
    <li> Well, I have only had this for a few days now but I must say it does have a nice minty taste. Not too strong. My teeth feel wonderful after brushing with this too. I even have my 15 yr old son using this. When it comes to whitening it&#x27;s too soon to say. As for the reduced sensitivity, I can tell a difference in my 1 tooth that has been acting up lately so that&#x27;s another plus. I will buy another tube soon since there are 2 of us using this 2-3 times a day. I&#x27;m going to browse the other items by this guy and see what other teeth stuff I might try.</li>
    <li> This is a great tooth paste.  It cleans teeth and freshens breath which protecting the enamel of the teeth.  I have now switched to Sqiggle because of issues with my mouth.</li>
    <li> When I bought this product it came with a trial size tube of Dr. Collins Whitening toothpaste as well. I&#x27;ve been using the two of them together and my teeth are whiter after 3 uses</li>
    <li> i got this toothpaste after reading all the good reviews.  i just finished invisilign, and my teeth are sensitive after having plastic over them for a year.  they also felt rough.  this toothpaste made my teeth feel so smooth, i think they look whiter too.  i just get a little nervous about the no fluoride, so i rinse with some afterwards</li>
    <li> I just got mine today in the mail and have only used it once so far and honestly my teeth actually look whiter than they were before I brushed. I wouldn&#x27;t have believed it myself if I hadn&#x27;t of seen it, but it&#x27;s true! My gums feel better also, so this toothpaste is definately going to be a \\&quot;keeper\\&quot; for me.</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste!!! I always have several different good brands of toothpaste which I rotate. Restore is one of my favorite! It cleans teeth really well, it has a pleasant taste, it doesn&#x27;t burn your mouth, plus my teeth became much whiter and healthier. Great ingredients. I recommend it to everybody!!!</li>
    <li> This was a great toothpaste then Dr. Collins stopped making it. Per Dr. Collins website they are reformulating this toothpaste. I just hope the new paste has novamin.</li>
    <li> I switch between this one and a xylitol toothpaste. This eliminates sensitivity and I&#x27;ve seen small holes close up after a few weeks. My teeth are also less transparent. I only with they would combine this with the xylitol one and I wouldn&#x27;t have to switch so much. This one has a lot of soapy stuff in it and really builds up in your mouth. Best to leave it on your teeth for a few minutes before spitting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other comments have given ways to make this stuff work better or faster, but I&#x27;ve found that with time it works really well. As a caution, it will cause more tonsil stones if that is a problem you have, so be prepared. It has additional calcium and that is why.</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading a thread on reddit about how the only real working ingredient proven to whiten teeth was novamin. Purchased this and discovered that it did a good job of helping my teeth lose its hypersensitivity. Fantastic.</li>
    <li> I need more time to evaluate the full efficiency of this product. contact me at a later stage for a full review</li>
    <li> It is hard to say how much better it is than other pastes but this feels good, it is not spicy (good for kids) and gives a good sensation of cleaniness</li>
    <li> It was the best there was in a fluoride-free toothpaste that mimicked the consistency and flavor of popular fluoride toothpastes.  It&#x27;s flaw was that it was expensive.  It was pulled from production with a fishy story, and the company claimed it was reformulating with a different ingredient and would be available a year ago, then delivery adjusted to 6 months ago, but that time came and went.  Does it take two years to come to market with a new product with one switched out ingredient? I don&#x27;t think they want to be in the fluoride-free toothpaste business anymore.  Sad.</li>
    <li> The mint taste is mild and not overbearing like commercial toothpaste.  The only thing I did not like is that it contains glycerin.  I want my teeth to absorb minerals, not seal them.</li>
    <li> My teeth have become more sensitive as I reached my mid-twenties, so I began searching for the best sensitive toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still use Sensodyne Pronamel at night, but this is my go-to morning toothpaste.  I initially planned to ease off of Sensodyne into a new toothpaste, but I have decided this combination is the best since they protect and strengthen sensitive teeth in different ways. (And, when I stopped using Sensodyne, the sensitivity came back in force - I do not recommend rapidly switching from one sensitive toothpaste to another.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr Collins Restore has a nice minty flavor with a gritty texture.  It really makes my teeth feel clean and my mouth smell fresh :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I experimented briefly with Squiggle Tooth Builder: [[ASIN:B00206DXQ0 Squigle Tooth Builder Sensitive Toothpaste (4.4 oz]], but I almost get the feeling that I am brushing with just water and saliva - gross.  I am trying to finish off that tube because it is too expensive to waste - definitely switching back to my Sensodyne / Dr. Collins routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I like the toothpaste so much, I decided to also go for the Dr. Collins toothbrush  [[ASIN:B0036ZA40W Dr. Collins  Perio Toothbrush,  (colors vary) (Pack of 3)]]. This definitely gets between my teeth better than my standard Oral-B, but it irritates my gums from time to time - I may be too rough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short - give this paste a try - refreshing and gritty!</li>
    <li> AS OF JULY 2013, THIS PRODUCT WAS PULLED FROM SHELVES TO BE \\&quot;REFORMULATED.\\&quot; IT WILL NO LONGER CONTAINS NOVAMIN.     ----------------------------------------------------------    I didn&#x27;t have really bad teeth in the first place; I guess they&#x27;re pretty average- just a few fillings, all in the first molars you get when you&#x27;re a child and don&#x27;t know how to brush correctly. No other dental work, no other problems. But everyone was raving DR. COLLINS WHITENED MY TEETH! DR. COLLINS CHANGED MY LIFE! DR. COLLINS PULLED ME FROM A BURNING CAR! So I thought I&#x27;d try it out. Now, at the end of a 6 month trial, I&#x27;m reporting back my results.    On the one hand:  --I know about the research done on Novamin and its ability to rebuild enamel and even bone, and I like that this toothpaste is one of the only ones on the market to feature it.  --It&#x27;s got a really good taste- a mild, sweet wintermint, like those puffy pastel-colored soft round mints sitting in the basket at the hostess podium in a fancy restaurant.  --It does reduce sensitivity, after just one or two uses.  --Yes, it&#x27;s made in America.    On the other hand:  --I also know that to really take full advantage of the enamel- and bone-building benefits of Novamin (calcium phosphosilicate), you need to use a much higher percentage/ stronger concentrate of it than is available in this toothpaste. There are some products which feature a higher amount, but they are for sale to dental professionals only.    --As at least one other reviewer has mentioned: It leaves a weird crusty white buildup in the small crevices between my teeth. I am assuming this is the Novamin crystals, but it looks like albino plaque. I kept scraping it off. So this stuff WILL accumulate and build up in little crevices. Unfortunately, that means it probably does not build up on the flat surfaces of teeth where it would easily be rinsed away. This makes me doubtful this paste would have much impact on thinning enamel on the front teeth.    --After using thestuff religiously, 2-3 times a day, for 6 months, sometimes not rinsing immediately afterward, just so my teeth could have even more exposure to the Novamin magic, I had the following results:  1. Nothing was noticeably whiter. This does not produce results similar to a whitening toothpaste.  2. Nothing was noticeably shinier.  3. Nothing was less transparent.  4. The dentist told me I had several \\&quot;rough spots\\&quot; where cavities were forming on the chewing surfaces of back molars.  5. I noticed this toothpaste seems somewhat more abrasive than my usual Crest or Colgate, and definitely more abrasive than Sensodyne.    Number 4 there concerns me. I faithfully brush, floss, fluoridate, and use xylitol daily. This has worked very well for me, and I&#x27;ve had no cavities in decades. The only thing that changed in my routine was the switch to this toothpaste. I&#x27;m hoping the dentist was simply trying to pad his daughter&#x27;s college fund, or that the rough spots were maybe a buildup of that above-mentioned Novamin crusty stuff.    Bottom line: I put my remaining unused Dr. Collins into storage, bought some plain old Crest, Listerine, ACT, and Closys, and started following Dr. Phillips&#x27; system for eradicating cavity-causing bacteria and remineralizing teeth, which is explained in [[ASIN:1929774672 Kiss Your Dentist Goodbye: A Do-It-Yourself Mouth Care System for Healthy, Clean Gums and Teeth]]. I have read that people have gotten good results from this regimen. Perhaps some of you out there might wish to do the same.     * Update *  I&#x27;ve been more or less following Dr. Phillips&#x27; system for over 2 years. I stopped using the Closys after a year because it&#x27;s very expensive, sometimes I skip the Listerine, and I use whatever toothpaste I&#x27;ve got around (she recommends using nothing but Crest, which makes no logical sense to me). She also says it&#x27;s fine to stop flossing on her regimen. I think that&#x27;s incredibly foolish, and floss daily. I have had no cavities. I believe it&#x27;s the xylitol and fluoride combination that works so well. The rough spots disappeared (or never existed), as confirmed by two other dentists. I have very little plaque build-up because the xylitol keeps it from adhering to your teeth, and the only major sensitivity I have is in the couple molars with amalgam fillings, which conduct hot and cold. My regular dentist noticed less plaque and asked what I was doing differently.    I still do use my Dr. Collins on occasion (I bought several tubes before it was discontinued). It really does taste good, and it does help with minor sensitivity from receding gums. I did read in a medical journal, though, that NovaMin works better in the presence of fluoride, so I either squirt a little [[ASIN:B0013TXFFY Gel Kam]] onto the brush or dip the brush in [[ASIN:B00GB9JE9C ACT]] along with the Dr. Collins and brush with that.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately I cannot find it at this time. When they bring it back I would love to order it again. Hope they don&#x27;t change the formula too much.</li>
    <li> I am a smoker and most whitening products make my teeth sensitive, but this doesn&#x27;t. It also isn&#x27;t an overnight whitener but slow and steady is working well for me and I will continue to purchase this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tube kind of sucks though. It&#x27;s not convenient, but I don&#x27;t really are - others may. It won&#x27;t distract me from buying again though.</li>
    <li> My teeth are noticeably whiter, and it leaves my mouth feeling fresh after brushing.  I am not really sure if it has done anything to help my enamel just yet.</li>
    <li> Have used this for years and it eliminates tooth sensitivity to hot and cold. Plus it whitens the teeth very well. It has Novamin to remineralize the teeth. The most important thing is that it does not have flouride.</li>
    <li> I love this toothpast! Helps my teeth and gums feel better and stay strong. I would recomend! recomended by my periodontist</li>
    <li> I had very bad pain from a tooth that had recently had a deep cavity filled.  I think I will eventually need a root canal.  But in the meantime I used Restore for just 3 days and my pain was gone.  I use it once a day now and I have no pain.</li>
    <li> I know I have several teeth where the old fillings have dissolved away, I have had 2 root canals in the past 5 years. This toothpaste along with Crest Pro Health purple mouthwash have eliminated any sensation from eating an occasional sweet thing or two. As long as my tooth does not hurt and worry me all day I am happy. It sure is doing something I am not imagining it. I know I will eventually need fillings but for now there is no pain and I feel ok. Thanks Dr. Collins</li>
    <li> It is nearly impossible to say with any certainty that this product does what it says. I also have to accept the manufacturers word that it does not contain fluoride or other toxic chemicals, and that this product performs as suggested.&lt;br /&gt;That being said it tastes great.&lt;br /&gt;I do not have any tooth sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;I do not see a dentist. I do use a sonic care and this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long term I hope this product will help me keep all my teeth. I can not speak to that though. I have been using this toothpaste exclusively for over 6 months and I&#x27;m happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did I mention NO FLUORIDE!!!  YAAAAHHHHH!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive teeth and can&#x27;t use many toothpastes due to the ingredients, but this toothpaste is fantastic. It is smooth and not gritty, it makes my teeth feel extremely clean, and I can tell a difference in my teeth after using it for just a couple of weeks..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a dark spot on one of my front teeth. After using this toothpaste for about a month, it was getting less noticable. After 2 months, the dark spot was gone!  It also helps with other tooth sensitivities I&#x27;ve had with hot and cold and sugars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> very gentle and effective in restoring enamel i had scraped off; would recommend this product to someone who needs to get enamel back on their teeth</li>
    <li> People need to catch on to toothpastes that contain Novamin.  This substance will bring an end to tooth decay, so I think the powers that be in the dental profession are trying hard to keep people from finding out about it.</li>
    <li> Tired of flouride toothpaste that doesn&#x27;t help with you tooth sensitivity?  This stuff works and with out flouride.  I only wish it didn&#x27;t have titanium dioxide in it, but I swish after I brush, then rinse well.  The best working with the least harmful ingredients that I have found.</li>
    <li> Why is there this stuff in toothpaste!! Bad enough we have to put it on our bodies, now IN our bodies?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOT GOOD!!</li>
    <li> Teeth sensitivity has not changed, I see no changes in teeth whiteness. I have been brushing two to three times a day and flossing and no change can be seen.</li>
    <li> Reduces Sensitivity. Numbed my tooth pain from my broken back tooth. Only downfall is that my teeth seemed extra sensitive when I stopped using this product.</li>
    <li> Ad didn&#x27;t mention this toothpaste had artificial sweetener added and no xylitol.  Not pleased with this brand.  Dr. Collins toothbrush is great, but not the toothpaste.  Squigle brand Tooth Builder (without flouride) is superior!</li>
    <li> I like the flavor and the texture, but I can&#x27;t really speak for any &amp;#34;restorative&amp;#34; qualities of this toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had some spots where I didn&#x27;t have cavities, but my dentist said his instruments were sticking a little and would turn into cavities. Those are still there after months of using this. I think using a traditional toothpaste like Crest would be as effective and then you&#x27;d get Whitening or different flavors. So while I like it, I don&#x27;t think I will be purchasing a second tube.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Novamin is the ingredient why I purchased Restore toothpaste .  I prefer novamin to recaldent.  I have had terrific results from novamin and plan on using it long term</li>
    <li> I bought this for the Novamin in it which is supposedly really good for restoring your teeth. I expected it to taste like chalk or just plain terrible but, to my surprise, it tastes great to me. Of course your taste-buds may say otherwise but for me, I enjoy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also feel great after brushing with it, almost like I can feel it restoring my teeth. (but that could just be a pseudo effect)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside I can think about is it doesn&#x27;t foam like most brand name toothpaste, but it&#x27;s not a big deal in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also doesn&#x27;t have fluoride, this could be bad or good. I&#x27;ve heard many different things on how fluoride and be bad for you and some on how it&#x27;s good for you. Just know that this product doesn&#x27;t have it.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste works better than any I&#x27;ve tried.  It&#x27;s expensive, that&#x27;s the downside.  I wish it came in 12-packs at the big box stores.</li>
    <li> My teeth were so sensitive it hurt to breathe in warm weather. This is the only toothpaste that ameliorates that issue. It is the only toothpaste I will use.</li>
    <li> I think that I did give this product a fair trial (about a year).  Perhaps I have a particularly intractable case of tooth sensitivity; but Restore toothpaste did not help to relieve my tooth pain.  Also, I did some research on this product, and discovered that it works by &amp;#34;occluding the dentin tubules.&amp;#34;  My research has taught me that we have those microscopic tubules in our teeth for a reason; and I question the advisability of chemically &amp;#34;occluding&amp;#34; them.  I do appreciate the fluoride-free aspect of this product, as fluoride provides a toxic, poor-quality solution to dental caries.  My progressive dentist has suggested that I try using MI Paste as a dentifrice.  So far, that seems to be working better for me.  MI Paste makes a very expensive solution to the problem of tooth sensitivity; but, if it works, then I will willingly pay for that relief.  In either case, I think that a person with tooth sensitivity needs to spend a 𝙡o𝙣𝘨 time brushing, in order to allow the dentifrice to work.</li>
    <li> My teeth are whiter and feel great. I can&#x27;t believe I have been using name brand tooth paste for all these years when something as great as restore is on the market! Thanks amazon for bringing this amazing product to my attention. I strongly advise picking up the Dr. Collins Perio toothbrush as well. The combination is unbeatable. The biggest problem is that your teeth feel so clean you can&#x27;t wait to brush them again after the day is over.</li>
    <li> Not really as good as plain old baking soda with peroxide or castor oil.</li>
    <li> I really like this product, it does what it says it will do. My teeth are whiter, and there is no fluoride which is way I bought it.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t tried this paste yet, but it&#x27;s 1 star rating is that all 3 tubes expire in July 13. I just got them a few days ago. That&#x27;s just not right.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if this toothpaste will restore my teeth to any degree, but it isn&#x27;t cloying, the flavor is gone quickly, and it feels good in the mouth. A keeper.</li>
    <li> This has the research behind it for healthier teeth.&lt;br /&gt;We haven&#x27;t had x-rays to prove its effectiveness,&lt;br /&gt;so I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;It can&#x27;t hurt using healthy toothpaste with the&lt;br /&gt;potential for some restoration!  We like to do all we can for our&lt;br /&gt;children, and need/get to take care of ourselves too.&lt;br /&gt;It tastes great and a little seems to work great!</li>
    <li> To claim to be of benefit and then learn this toothpaste contained a known hormone disruptor - sodium lauryl sulfate made me unhappy. I wish I had never ordered it. It lathered way too much and even though I rinsed repeatedly my mouth never felt free of toothpaste residue.</li>
    <li> I have used every toothpaste on the market, seriously.  I researched a lot about teeth and oral care.  Recently I read the importance of remineralization and came across this product. I&#x27;m almost done with my first tube and I have to say I am impressed.  My teeth look the best in years.  They look how they did when I was very young, when my teeth were real white and shiny.  I am getting a lot of compliments and I know that this product is not only helping with sensitivity, but the overall health of my teeth.  My wife and kids are using this as well and their teeth look great.  I highly recommend this to anyone.  I will continue to use this!</li>
    <li> My teeth are Very Sensitive.  The tooth paste I use to use no longer helped.  Restore is fantastic because it has no Flouride.  I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> I got my braces off and my teeth were suddenly so sensitive and transparent looking. I had been using toothpaste for sensitive teeth (colgate) but it wasn&#x27;t enough. I wasnt able to chew anything on my right side. I started  using this paste and within a couple days my teeth started feeling better. Now about a month later ( almost gone through the whole tube) I am able to eat without my teeth hurting. Definitely love this toothpaste I just ordered more.</li>
    <li> This product is very good, have only been using two weeks, but I can feel the difference already. I have ordered four more. I have tried many other toothpastes that claim to restore tooth enamel, however none of the other products have made any difference. I am looking forward to seeing the results after several months of using this product.</li>
    <li> This product reduces painful sensitivity.  No complaints from me.  (Flossing after every meal will also help reduce pain).  A little expensive but worth it to me.</li>
    <li> This product contains something that really strengthens and desensitizes.  Works better for me than Sensodyne.  It also has a mild, but pleasant taste, that doesn&#x27;t interfere with the taste of my morning coffee :-)</li>
    <li> After having a lot of dental issues I switched toothpastes and tried Dr. Collins Restore Toothpaste. It worked well, but didn&#x27;t notice anything wow about it. Didn&#x27;t feel like it left my teeth super clean.I also bought a tooth powder (dr. christopher&#x27;s tooth powder) around the same time and I switched to see what one was superior and by far Dr. Christopher took Dr. Collins down!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your trying to restore your teeth you can give Dr. Collins a try, but look around at other options too. There is better products.</li>
    <li> Only regret that I didn&#x27;t discover this toothbrush sooner. Would have saved my gum, and brushing more fun. Go for it.</li>
    <li> even though It is very recent to see if can prevent cavities, I see my teet whiter, something i did not expected</li>
    <li> Nothing beats Dr. Collins vanilla mint toothpaste, but they were out of stock online at the time, so I ordered this.  It&#x27;s not bad, and I&#x27;m sure the whitening power is still there, but nothing beats the taste of vanilla mint on your gums.  I would recommend Dr. Collins brand, but not so much this as the flavour is not quite there.  If you&#x27;re picky about the taste of the toothpaste, and still want cleaning/whitening power, I&#x27;d try the Dr. Collins Vanilla Mint toothpaste.</li>
