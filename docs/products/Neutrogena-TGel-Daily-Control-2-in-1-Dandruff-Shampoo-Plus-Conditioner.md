      <li>Works great.  </li>
      <li>Works great smells good.</li>
      <li>(My scalp was not in a good condition.)</li>
      <li>Bought it more to control hair loss which it seems really effective at doing.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok, but</li>
      <li>This stuff is more like Head &amp; Shoulders competition.  </li>
      <li>Having multiple anti- dandruff shampoos and using them alternatively is the best way to control your dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The smell is okay</li>
      <li>okay.  </li>
      <li>Ordered this depending on the reviews and I am in love with it.</li>
      <li>love this shampoo and there is a reason that its recommended by many dermatologists: It gets the work done what it meant to do.</li>
      <li>It does not prevent dandruff but causes more hair loss to me.</li>
      <li>, it makes the hair more stronger and shiny and pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This product does everything it is supposed to, it smells pretty good too.</li>
      <li>Better than any other dandruff shampoo honestly my hair is better now with no dandruff and smells great.</li>
      <li>And the vitamin E keeps the hair strong and provide moisture to the scalp.</li>
      <li>though I haven&#x27;t used it that long, I would recommend this as a good anti dandruff hair product!</li>
      <li>almost half in the stores, I was sure where to buy it from !!!</li>
      <li>Pyrithione zinc (1%) keeps your hair itch free and dandruff free.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Being from Neutrogena, a trusted brand in the field of cosmetic products, I never had any doubts about this product and the fact that it was available on Amazon for a price</li>
      <li>Leaves hair clean and smells</li>
      <li>It cleans seems to really clean my scalp and relieves the itch.</li>

      <li>This has worked amazingly, used a 5 times the first week now twice a week and same results, no dandruff.</li>
      <li>The smell is actually quite pleasant especially when combined with another conditioner.</li>
      <li>arrived earlier than expected and really effective</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m on the hunt to replace the daily shampoo Neutrogena unfortunately abandoned (best shampoo ever!!!).  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not as dry as it has been recently, and it&#x27;s more manageable as well.</li>
      <li>Did not dry my hair out too much either.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d say after almost 2 weeks of using it twice a week, I have noticed a real difference in my hair, especially the texture.</li>
      <li>I have been using a sulfate free shampoo and conditioner (Colorproof) for the last year and a half and washing my hair about once a week.</li>
      <li>My old shampoo cost anywhere from $20-$25, and the bottle was much smaller.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Wanted something mild for my dandruff prone hairs. Tried other products but they are all very harsh on my hair. Ordered this depending on the reviews and I am in love with it. I am using it from last 3 years and I haven&#x27;t found any comparable shampoo.</li>
    <li> As advertised. Will order again!</li>
    <li> Great purchase! Shipped in time &amp; is truly helping my scalp!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve got dandruff, I would recommend this shampoo.  I had been using a medication strength shampoo for a long time, as regular shampoo like Head and Shoulders did not work.  My old shampoo cost anywhere from $20-$25, and the bottle was much smaller.  This works just like the more expensive stuff.  It is a life saver!</li>
    <li> I have been using a sulfate free shampoo and conditioner (Colorproof) for the last year and a half and washing my hair about once a week. I recently made the switch to this anti dandruff 2-in-1 because of my dandruff (some people noticed the dandruff and I did when I brushed my hair) and a lot of people online were saying it&#x27;s the best for dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say after almost 2 weeks of using it twice a week, I have noticed a real difference in my hair, especially the texture. It&#x27;s not as dry as it has been recently, and it&#x27;s more manageable as well. Plus it&#x27;s a 2-in-1 so I can shorten the time I take in the shower by a lot. Another plus is that my local grocery store sells this product in case I need to repurchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though I haven&#x27;t used it that long, I would recommend this as a good anti dandruff hair product!</li>
    <li> arrived earlier than expected and really effective</li>
    <li> Having multiple anti- dandruff shampoos and using them alternatively is the best way to control your dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have learned this over the past few years of fighting to keep dandruff away. One this I have learnt is that it never goes, you can just contain it by using different shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;I never knew about this until, I came across this in a pharmacy a couple weeks ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being from Neutrogena, a trusted brand in the field of cosmetic products, I never had any doubts about this product and the fact that it was available on Amazon for a price almost half in the stores, I was sure where to buy it from !!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this shampoo and there is a reason that its recommended by many dermatologists: It gets the work done what it meant to do. Pyrithione zinc (1%) keeps your hair itch free and dandruff free. And the vitamin E keeps the hair strong and provide moisture to the scalp. The wheat proteins in the shampoo strengthen the hair further.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say that this shampoo not only gets rid of the itching and dandruff, it makes the hair more stronger and shiny and pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;!!!! I dont regret buying this and i am sure even you wont !!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Leaves hair clean and smells okay.  Works well at keeping dandruff from returning, but not at getting rid of flakes and itch.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on the hunt to replace the daily shampoo Neutrogena unfortunately abandoned (best shampoo ever!!!).  This stuff is more like Head &amp; Shoulders competition.  It&#x27;s ok, but no Clean Body.  Still on the hunt.</li>
    <li> Bottle received did not match bottle ordered.  It does not state &amp;#34;safe on color treated hair&amp;#34; as it does on the order.</li>
    <li> It does not prevent dandruff but causes more hair loss to me. (My scalp was not in a good condition.) I guess it&#x27;s not silicon-free. I cannot understand why it&#x27;s recommended by dermatologists according to the ad. Even though this was not very expensive, it was a total waste of money.</li>
    <li> This actually worked!&lt;br /&gt;I have always noticed dandruff before on my darker clothes but I always thought a holistic treatment was the only way to fix things, maybe trying a few brands before research. This has worked amazingly, used a 5 times the first week now twice a week and same results, no dandruff.</li>
    <li> This product does everything it is supposed to, it smells pretty good too. It also doesn&#x27;t smell like chemicals, nor does it leave that smell behind after use.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Reduces itching and flakes and leaves my hair soft and nice.  I prefer this to other dandruff/anti-itch shampoos I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> It is very good ! Better than any other dandruff shampoo honestly my hair is better now with no dandruff and smells great.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is like a miracle for me. This os the best shampoo if you have dandruff</li>
    <li> Not a good product for people who have oily hair. The smell is okay but this doesn&#x27;t work for dandruff. Also, it makes my hair completely disgusting the next day. My hair has never been so oily.</li>
    <li> Works great smells good. Bought it more to control hair loss which it seems really effective at doing. I also use it as a face n body wash to control acne n dry skin. In the winter when is real dry out.</li>
    <li> This shampoo works well. It cleans seems to really clean my scalp and relieves the itch. The smell is actually quite pleasant especially when combined with another conditioner. Did not dry my hair out too much either.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for dandruff.</li>
