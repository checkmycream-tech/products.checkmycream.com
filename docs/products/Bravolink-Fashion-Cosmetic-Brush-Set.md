<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> The clutch is beautiful. The brushes are amazing. I would buy this again in a heartbeat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first brush set and I was nervous in purchasing it. I&#x27;ve read hundreds of reviews from several brands, including Bravolink, EcoTools, Real Techniques and Sonia Kushiak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality of the clutch is really beyond nice. It&#x27;s sleek, smooth, and the stitching is without flaw. Each brush is individually wrapped in a clear, plastic protective sleeve. None of the bristles are misshapen or shooting off in weird directions. The bristles are also heavenly soft. They do have a light scent of something odd, but I think it&#x27;s from the inside of the clutch. Washing the brushes lightly (which I would have done anyway) solves the issue. I also received a pink facial sponge with a Hello Kitty picture etched on the top. It&#x27;s very, very soft. Like insanely soft and spongy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are a wooden handle with a metal black tip. For sizing reference, the eye shadow brush is 5 inches, 1/2 an inch shorter than a Pilot G gel pen. However, the lengths of the brushes vary from what is pictured. The eye shadow and eye contour brushes are identical in length, but the eye brow and lip brushes are a tad shorter (1/4&#x27;&#x27;). Also, the eye contour brush bristles aren&#x27;t as slanted as they look in the pictures. I have no idea if that will make a difference in using the brush. The loose paint brush bristles are longer than pictured (6.5&#x27;&#x27;), so the brush as a whole is 1/2&#x27;&#x27; taller than the honey paint brush. There is a very nice, heavy plastic cover for the loose foundation brush that I will probably keep.</li>
    <li> Very cute and soft brushes. I wish they were a little heavier though.</li>
    <li> Bravolink Cosmetic Brush Set,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a great cosmetic brush set! This set comes with seven brushes, not only that they are all labeled letting you know what each brush is for. It comes in an elegant burgundy clutch with each brush fitting neatly and securely in its own slot. It&#x27;s slim size makes it easy to carry in your purse/bag without adding any extra weight. I am not sure what synthetic blend the  bristles are made out of, but it is very nice, the handles are made out of a shallow which makes it light to handle and easy to manage when applying your make up. I recommend this product to all the ladies and make-up artist, this is a must have, I suggest purchasing more than one so you can have a set for yourself.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t even used it yet but I love it so much! The bag is so elegant and makes it so easy to store all the brushes. The brushes are very soft and appear to be sturdy. For the price, I could not ask for anything more!</li>
    <li> Wow, what a difference! I have never used any type of cosmetic brushes before and I will NEVER use my hands again to apply foundation or blush. I&#x27;ve noticed that as I get older, my foundation looks odd, my pores show, my skin looks tired. It is depressing! I was sent these lovely brushes but passed them to my 3 daughters to use as i didnt think i needed them. Boy oh boy was I wrong. One of my daughters  insisted I try the stipple brush for my liquid foundation and goodness what a difference! It covers better,looks lighter, sets into pores better. What have I been missing all these years? ...and the blush brush is thick,soft and indulgent! LOVE LOVE LOVE  these brushes. So much so that I took them back from my daughters and am having fun looking fresh! Ha ha, sorry girls!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with them</li>
    <li> Poor quality. Keep looking and save your money.</li>
    <li> Great brushes but they stink like paint at first!?</li>
    <li> It smells a little funky, but if you air it out it goes away. Otherwise it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> Really nice set. Smells a little funny at first because of the clutch its in, but the quality of the brushes are good. I used them with no fly always and the application was smooth. Didn&#x27;t leave any harsh brush lines. I even got a bonus hello kitty sponge, which is so adorable.</li>
    <li> The clutch is cute. With the exception of the &amp;quot;bronzer brush&amp;quot; I found it too flimsy and it wouldn&#x27;t pick up enough product and it deposited the make up kind of patchy...the rest of the brushes seemed OK. I&#x27;ll still have to play with them more.</li>
    <li> I decided to treat myself &amp; get myself a new set a make up brushes. Now I didn&#x27;t spend a ton of money on them because I really don&#x27;t have it to spend. However, I think these are a great deal for the price. It comes with just the basics, which is what I needed, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with them. I recently bought new foundation and the lady at the make up counter used a brush to blend my foundation. I cannot believe I have been using my fingers all these years! Do you how much less make up you need when you put it on using a brush? You loose considerably less! Now my make up will probably last me twice as long and has that smooth air brushed look instead of being heavier in some spots and lighter in others. I think this set is a great starter kit for someone like me who is learning how to apply make up all over again. Plus these brushes are synthetic and antibacterial, perfect for me. And they all fit nicely in the stylish clutch. Very happy with these!</li>
    <li> These are beautiful brushes. Made well. Very soft.</li>
    <li> Beautiful brushes and clutch.  Very soft.  Quality product. Thank you!</li>
    <li> product is good for someone starting with makeup. i needed some new brushes fast and saw these and thought what the heck why not. the brushes eat up all of the product! the only one i can use it the second largest one thats angled and fluffy for bronzer and sometimes blush. the brushes arent thick enough for any makeup that i use. good for beginners but not if you are really into makeup</li>
    <li> I love it, the brushes do not shed and that&#x27;s # 1 in my book!</li>
    <li> Smells like chemicals . Came early tho</li>
    <li> Complete set! Absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> The brushes are super soft i loved how they feel on my skin and the clutch is a plus 👍</li>
    <li> Really soft they do smell funny at first but then it goes away :)</li>
    <li> Nice set, I love the carrying case. The brushes just aren&#x27;t very sturdy, the concealer brush started to detach from the base after first use &amp; wash.</li>
    <li> absolutely love them, super soft.</li>
    <li> Love them !!! This was a good buy!!!!!😊</li>
    <li> The face brushes are not so good but the eye brushes are great</li>
    <li> This set I tested well and have honestly found this to be the BEST set of travel makeup brushes that I have used for these reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Love the travel case - I place this in my large cosmetic bag that I keep with me under my bathroom sink. Then when I travel, it is ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) BRUSHES - SIX - There is a powder (finishing brush and blending brush), Blush on brush that works perfectly with my Cover Girl Blush On,Countour Brush - I use with with my highlighter, 4 different eye brushes. The narrowest eye brush I use after I apply my eyebrow pencil. What this does is to tone down my eyebrows to a softer look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall the set I like the only thing I found a little odd was at first it had a slight off odor to the set. So I just sprayed some Ferbrzye on it and let it air out overnight and it now smells great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set provided for testing and reviewing purposes.&lt;br /&gt;The good news is that I am very impressed with this set and rate it 4.7 stars.</li>
    <li> We got this makeup Brushes- set and are very satisfied!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are very well made and fit comfortably in your hand. So far, the matching brush was for every makeup need my wife here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;pocket&amp;#34; in which they are is also very good verarbeitet- and I must say that we have put some time on the balcony to air out because They had but a little smell but now everything is great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those looking for good and cheap cosmetic brushes can look at this in more detail here!</li>
    <li> I love collecting makeup brushes. Although I am no makeup artist, it&#x27;s a well known fact that your makeup prowess is entirely dependent on the quality of brushes. I have a couple of MAC brushes, some Sonia Kashuk brushes, some from The Body Shop, also EcoTools, Sephora and Ulta brushes, some finds from places like Walmart, Fred Meyer, Walgreens, CVS, Rite-Aid and even from eBay. After all the brushes I&#x27;ve used I&#x27;d say that these brushes are a great value for their price (around $20).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will be hard-pressed to find this quality in this price range, especially as they come with a relatively nice clutch bag with inserts for the brushes. The handles of the brushes are well made and just the right length for ease of application. The black metal part looks secure and hopefully won&#x27;t detach over time from the wooden part as has happened with a few other brushes I&#x27;ve owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest powder brush is not as thick as my best economy powder brushes purchased for $8-12 from pharmacies and Target but it&#x27;s better than other similar brushes I&#x27;ve purchased in sets. It&#x27;s way better than those brushes that typically come in sets as this brush does not shed. The top fibers are supersoft and are really required for blending in mineral foundations or mineral makeup. I probably won&#x27;t recommend it for compact powder, as you need a thicker brush for it but you could definitely use it if needed for some lighter contouring application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The angled brush is a little gem as it&#x27;s soft and blends in a blush or bronzer really well. This brush alone is worth the price of the set, as it&#x27;s tough to get a really good bronzer brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a 3rd tapered brush that you can use with liquid foundation, but I don&#x27;t really advise it, as it can get messy over time as the fibers are toward the softer side. I would not spoil it with oily foundation, rather keep it for fine contouring applications. For oily foundations I find that slightly stiffer bristle brushes do better and you can get good ones from EcoTools or Target collection for a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eyeshadow angled brush, shadow brush, brow brush and lip liner are all very nice and do not fray like cheaper brushes. Softness is important as you have to blend shadow into the crease of your eye, and these brushes do the job. I do love my MAC 217 brush in combination to get the first coat of shadow in and then use the brushes in this set for the fine lining and layering and then finish up the blending with the #217 if needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended if you can get for under $20. For anything more, I would recommend only if you need a whole set. If you already have another good set, it&#x27;s best to buy just the one you need and spend a little extra!ones from EcoTools or Target collection for a reasonable price.

    <li> When I saw this clutch, it was just so pretty.  I couldn&#x27;t have guessed it was full of makeup brushes.  What lovely brushes they are.  I have been in need of a good set for some time, which I&#x27;ve been putting off because I don&#x27;t wear makeup often enough.  Just seeing the brushes made me want to go throw some on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are soft and they don&#x27;t fall out.  We get all different sizes, but I would like to have one a little bit larger than the largest brush.  I had very good control of my powder with these brushes.  They&#x27;ve made me very happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was provided for review by Bravolink.</li>
    <li> The red clutch looks lovely in a deep red color with magnetic poppers so is easy to open and close. There is an individual deep pocket for each brush that fits securely around each brush- which is very nice because it makes it easier when carrying them. There is also a flap that covers the bristles which is an extra bonus because it protects my purse from any leftover residue on the bristles and makes this set an easy, stress free for transit. The brushes inside are very soft and I found that they apply make up very well and disperse the makeup evenly on my face. The one brush that was slightly off for me was the eye contour brush because I needed to use more product to get my make up on. The other brushes were excellent and I am in love with the perfection they create. They are lightweight and I love that each brush was labeled in neat black letters to tell you what it should be used for.&lt;br /&gt;Review from my wife: I love that the set makes makeup less messy because once you’re done you pop your brush right back into the pocket, close the clutch and you have a clean looking dressing table or purse. The faux crocodile material that the clutch is made from is easy to wipe down if you spill anything on it (for me it was an accident with foundation).&lt;br /&gt;The drawbacks for me were the initial smell that was similar to turpentine or paint when I first opened up the clutch. It’s been wearing off so that’s not too bad now. The other brush I’d like to see is the eye lash/eye brow type of brush because I like to brush my very eyelashes before I apply my mascara. I would recommend this product to a friend because it’s easy to use, the brushes are excellent, the clutch looks nice, the brushes are labeled, and it’s easy to carry with you anywhere. A very practical and easy to use product.</li>
    <li> This set is a must have to have the flawless perfect makeup.  From work to play they will help you blend and build dramatic or natural looks, you can create professional looking results quickly and easily.  The soft antibacterial synthetic brush hair feels and looks just like the animal hair brushes that sell for ridiculous prices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each brush has a nice thick handle that feels comfortable in your hand. From foundation, bronzer and cheek blush, to liquids and cream products they will be easy to apply with minimal effort.  Best of all the brushes are washable.  To wash dampen bristles with warm water and lather gently with mild soap or shampoo. Rinse under warm water and blot the brush well with a clean dry cloth and gently reshape.  Allow your brush to air-dry laying flat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember the bristles are synthetic and sensitive to heat so keep away from heat sources.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comes with a perfect case for traveling and storing.  I also got a cute Hello Kitty makeup sponge as an added bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review sample.</li>
    <li> First, a small note: As the brush set is sent by Bravo link from China, you have to plan longer delivery times. My brush was a good two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;You get the seven cosmetic brushes come in a dark red leatherette case. The pencil case is very handy because it each brush has its own slot, so getting all the parts are in place and you do not have to look far. In addition, a protective flap is mounted above, which prevents the brush can fall out or be damaged. The pencil case is closed by means of two magnetic snaps. It smells at first somewhat synthetic, but that is within a few days in the air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The following brushes are included:&lt;br /&gt;1 large powder brush,&lt;br /&gt;1 tapered blush brush,&lt;br /&gt;1 flat brush, for applying Foundation,&lt;br /&gt;1 flat, rounded top eyeshadow brush,&lt;br /&gt;1 slanted eye liner brush,&lt;br /&gt;1 narrow eyebrow brush (I use preferred for uniform, thin coating of cream eyeliner) and&lt;br /&gt;1 lip brush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All brushes are very well made. So far I could not notice any hair loss, and that the brush hairs are synthetic, I find particularly good, both for animal welfare and hygienic reasons. Each brush is matched by the strength of the hair just on his task. Thus, powder and blush brush are very soft and fluffy, while foundation brush, eyebrow brush or lip brush rather have a solid consistency. I have it now for about two weeks in use and am very pleased with the handling and quality. In addition, the brush also look good. The brush handles are painted in a dark metallic red and have a black metal clamp that holds the brush hair. Along with the glossy case looks the whole set of very beautiful and noble. Also, it takes up little space, so that you also may have to travel while his cosmetic brushes always.&lt;br /&gt;As a bonus, I&#x27;ve got a good cosmetic sponge, which is well suited for uniform application of makeup. It comes packed and humid in the pack. When you open it smells slightly of disinfectant, and I recommend to rinse it before use once thoroughly with clean water. Dried in the air it is hard, but gains its suppleness back immediately if it comes back in contact with water.ghly with clean water.

    <li> The Bravolink Fashion Cosmetic Brush Set is a hit – both aesthetically and functionally. It looks like a professional kit used by makeup artists, and it provides superior versatility to cosmetic brush sets twice its size. And with its bonus facial sponge and double snap closure crocodile-embossed jacket, the Bravolink is an awesome value. My wife loves the quality of this brush set and has commented that she would not be reluctant to use this beautiful set in a public restroom. On initial usage there doesn’t seem to be any shedding of brush hair. And each brush holds cosmetic product very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those interested, PU Leather is a bi-cast or split leather that is, in this case, covered with a layer of polyurethane (PU) that is applied to the surface and then embossed with a croc design. In other words, no crocodiles were harmed in the making of this case. This cosmetic set is manufactured in China to what appears to be a high standard of approval. My wife recommends the Bravolink Fashion Cosmetic Brush Set. A sample product was provided for this review.</li>
    <li> Seven make-up brushes for practically any facial application you can think of.  Some of the same brushes are of approximately the same bristle length, but are cut differently for a variety of application purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles on the larger brushes feel very soft and the smaller ones, while the very edges are soft, are somewhat stiffer due to their shorter length.  That makes them good for more precise application, especially around the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case itself is PU Leather with a shiny coating that makes it feel like plastic although it looks nice.  But it appears to be durable and has a double magnetic clasp closure.  Closed, it fits easily in a purse or tote.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One brush I wish had been included would be for applying a cake eyeliner.  None of these brushes are small enough for that.  But I’ll definitely be getting a lot of use out of these.  Brush set was provided for testing and review.</li>
    <li> This is a complete and nice set of makeup brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The set had a bit of vinyl or adhesive smell to it that went away after a day. The pouch is artificial alligator with red nylon fabric on the inside. Oddly, the brushes and case colors clashed. These are really the only things my wife could find wrong with the set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The facial sponge is kind of funny. It is baby blue with Hello Kitty embossed on it. I guess in a strange way, it leaves you with a smile on your face. It&#x27;s so strange it is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each brush has a thick handle. The ferrules are all tight and well clamped on the handles and bristles. The bristles are soft and hold powder extremely well. It seemed like makeup would mess up the nice case. In fact, because the bristles hold powder so well, there is no mess in the case. Each brush is labeled in small type with its intended use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eyeliner brush makes clear sharp lines using dark eye shadow to outline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lip brush is good for eye shadow, it applies powder so nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Foundation brush is excellent for concealer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bronzer brush used for blush, it picked up the powder so well and was easy to blend in the blush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Blush brush was good for face powder on the T zone for humid weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flap in the case forces you to be neat and organized. It does a good job protecting the bristles of the brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case is excellent for travel - it is compact. It looks like a wallet when folded up, so it fits in a purse nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a review sample.</li>
    <li> Exactly what i wanted, as described, and delivered quickly.</li>
    <li> This is a great selection of brushes. The  antibacterial  brushes are thick, soft, and don&#x27;t shed. The handles are long &amp; easy to hold. Every style of brush I use is included in this set. The faux crocodile case is one of the nicest cases I&#x27;ve used. Each brush has its own pocket &amp; there&#x27;s a flap that pulls down to cover the brush &#x27;heads&#x27;. The flap performs double duty. It prevents makeup from messing up the case &amp; also helps the brushes retain their shape.  A large makeup sponge is included with this set too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brushes included in the set include:&lt;br /&gt;Blush Brush&lt;br /&gt;Contoured Brush for use with blush or contouring powder&lt;br /&gt;Foundation Brush&lt;br /&gt;Eye Shadow Brush&lt;br /&gt;Contoured Eye Shadow Brush&lt;br /&gt;Eyebrow Brush&lt;br /&gt;Lip Brush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hover your mouse over Amazon&#x27;s Product Photos to see these brushes &amp; the inside of the clutch style case  up close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great cosmetic brush set &amp; it comes with an elegant, functional clutch style case &amp; makeup sponge too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;review sample provided</li>
    <li> This brush set is very nice and handy. I love the beautiful case . The case even has a nice flap to help keep the brushes from falling out of the case. The brushes included are: Blush, foundation, bronzer, eye shadow, eye contour, lip and eye brow. Perfect for a set of brushes to carry in your purse. This would make a great gift.</li>
    <li> so so soft brushes which are nice but just not what i was looking for personally</li>
    <li> This seven piece makeup brush set comes in a burgundy red faux crocodile magnetic snap closure case.  It has a flap that covers the bushes after you insert the handles into the pockets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are brown in color with white tips.  The large ones are soft for powder or blush and the smaller ones are stiff enough to use for correction of makeup where you don’t want it or to apply to a smaller specific area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also comes with an oval facial sponge embossed with Hello Kitty on it.  Mine was light blue in color.  This is great for removing makeup after a long day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush set would make a nice gift to your favorite gal or just get one for yourself.</li>
    <li> I was surprised by the quality of these brushes. The clutch case is super cute and the brushes versatile with no fallout. The only complaint was a slight paint smell which was solved with a quick wash with some baby shampoo :)</li>
    <li> Okay, first up, I should mention that I am a bloke and not into wearing make-up, although I have nothing against those of a more feminine nature! That said, I was offered a free trial of these brushes, for an honest review, so accepted, knowing it was my wife&#x27;s birthday coming up. The immediate impression I had, of the brushes, was how soft they were, as they really do feel lovely on the skin. It comes with seven brushes, of varying length and thickness, so most bases should be covered. I must say, I was also impressed by the red bag they came in, although it had a &#x27;paint&#x27; kind of smell to it. In addition, you also get a lovely hello Kitty sponge, useful for removing make-up - I guess! Lastly, my wife did indeed try out the brushes and she can confirm that they are &#x27;top notch&#x27; and well worth the money. Thanks again to Betty Zou and their wonderful customer service.</li>
    <li> These brushes were offered to me in exchange for posting an honest review of them, but since I do not wear makeup and with the agreement of the supplier, I have deferred to my adult stepdaughter, who does wear makeup.  She has provided her unbiased opinion which follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I am not a makeup artist. Therefore the scattered knowledge I have of beauty comes from the occasional articles that I read from a Glamour or Cosmopolitan magazine or from instructions in department stores, grocery stores or the lobby of the doctors office. However the thrill and ease which came from first opening this case of beauty brushes has inspired me to think like a makeup artist and feel like I&#x27;m stepping out onto the red carpet each morning I walk out the door. The best part of these brushes is that I don&#x27;t need to be a make-up artist to get that natural, uniform coverage that one strives for when getting in front of the mirror. These brushes make it easy to highlight what I like and conceal what I don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;The most essential brush I feel is the largest angled-tapered brush (the second brush when going left to right). Although all of these brushes serve a vital purposeful role one can achieve from a get-glam routine, this blush-bronzer brush is fantastic for contouring, as we&#x27;ll as highlighting cheeks, jawline, shoulders and collarbone. It does the jobs of the brushes to the left and right of it. I like to use the smaller brushes in the palette for powder and gel eye shadows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Dampen the ends with a little water for more coverage and definition. The smallest two (last two in line on the far right) are sturdy yet soft enough to give precision when shaping lips and brows. I would recommend using the smallest square-angled-tapered brush for liquid cream, even powdered eyeliners. The smallest, more rounded tapered brush works great for concealing blemishes and dark spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;These brushes are a steal as they do a superior job to anything you would expect to find in a department store, for which I would pay at least thirty bucks.&amp;#34;you would expect to find in a department store, for which I would pay at least thirty bucks.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t believe this anti bacterial brushes are so cheap. Kinds smelt funny like chemicals when I got them but I left it out and obviously washed the brushes before I used them and I love them. I really only use the foundation powder only brush and the blush brushes though.</li>
    <li> These brushes are beautiful and soft! BUT the smell is just so unappealing. I never thought new brushes would have a gross paint job smell to them and these ones did. The clutch is soooo gorgeous! If it wasn&#x27;t made specially for the brushes, I would use it as an everyday clutch. Another downside is that every brush is labeled its purpose (foundation, concealer, etc) and two of them were mixed up between concealer and eye brow. I would recommend these brushes for personal use, not for presents or giveaways.</li>
    <li> Get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Excellent quaility for the price! Brushes are super soft and I haven&#x27;t had any fallout yet. The case is cute and of nice quality as well! Would definitely recommend for someone who wants nice brushes without paying a fortune. Would buy again in a heartbeat.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo12NVKLD89SJG]]This is a gorgeous set of professional-quality make-up brushes, luxuriously housed in a lovely faux-crocodile skin clutch-shaped bag.  It arrives simply packaged in clear plastic, but still makes a great first impression.  The top flap is secured by two magnetic stud closures that are very easy to pull open and fasten again.  Inside, seven brushes (each enclosed in its clear plastic sleeve) are arranged in individual fabric pockets and there is a protective fabric flap that folds down over the tops to keep the brushes flat and organised.  I really like the burgundy colour, it&#x27;s elegant and edgy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The selection provides all you need to apply basic make-up to your face, on the go or at home.  A cute touch:  each brush is labelled in black lettering, with a hint about suggested use.  I go through each one in my video but, briefly, from largest to smallest, they are: blush (also good for loose powder), bronzer, foundation (for under-eye area), eye shadow, eye contour, eyebrow and lips.  The brushes have wooden handles finished in dark red paint, and are made of incredibly soft synthetic material.  As usual, it is best to wash the brushes before your first use, which will remove any lingering chemical odour.  Just work a drop of mild liquid soap into the bristles, rinse well under the tap and allow to dry away from heat, bristle side up, to keep the shape.  A weekly wash will keep these lovely brushes in top condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, after several weeks in daily use, the painted finish is holding up well with no visible flaking and I haven&#x27;t noticed any hairs coming off.  These brushes are a pleasure to use.  The handles give a great feel and make it easy to be precise.  The synthetic bristles are silky soft, they distribute powered products evenly and work well with creamy stuff, too, like under-eye concealer.  Because the bag is such a neat shape and size, it&#x27;s easy to slip it in your handbag or hold-all ensuring that you have a full selection of applicators without having to chase around for individual items or relying on the awful ones that are sometimes provided with the product.  The big sponge is a nice little bonus.  It works well to remove make-up with a soap-type remover and water and it&#x27;s easy to wash and dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is incredibly modest for such quality and I love the excellent results I&#x27;ve been getting with my everyday products. I once paid half the price of this set of seven for just one long-handled eye powder applicator!  These gorgeous brushes would make a beautiful gift, or just treat yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;N.B.: I received this item for free with a request to fully test and evaluate it.

    <li> I received my brushes about a month ago i wanted to makes sure I really tried them out in order to gove u a good review.After a month of using them I cant tell you that these a great brushes! They are so soft and do well with hand washing them I didnt have much fall out of they kept there shape well. I love how convenient it is with the case and all. Its weighs very little and is seriously the perfect size make up brush set to keep in your purse for day time touch ups. Overall amazing quality!</li>
    <li> Bravolink has created the most elegant set of makeup brushes I&#x27;ve seen.  Seven brushes in a variety of sizes are housed in a gorgeous red crocodile case.  But pretty brushes aren&#x27;t really the point.  How well they work is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These brushes are slightly different from the ones I&#x27;ve always used because they all have white tips.  These white tips pick up color easily.  In fact, they pick up more color than I expected, so I&#x27;m going to have to get used to handling them very gently so that I don&#x27;t end up looking like a circus clown.  The color glides on very smoothly -- no blobs or splotches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need new brushes or if you need a gift for a favorite friend, I suggest these.  Beautifully packaged, work well with smooth application -- who could ask for more in a makeup brush.  I&#x27;m saying goodbye to my old brushes now that I own such a lovely new set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FIVE STARS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review</li>
    <li> Nice set. First thing that pops in is the case. Wonderful design, The brushes themselves are very good. Great for drama makeups/performances. Is soft and good quality. Was provided a sample in exchange of a fair review.</li>
    <li> The Bravolink Cosmetic Brush set is a high quality set of seven brushes, a smart carrying case and a facial sponge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The carrying case measures 3.5” X 8” and is a tri-fold case.  It snaps shut with magnetic snaps.  The case is burgundy in color and resembles alligator hide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inside are seven different brushes that cover every possible application, from blush to eye-liner.  The bristles are contoured for the different applications. The bristles are very soft and appear to be very firmly attached.  We did not find any incidents of shedding bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is an oval shaped facial sponge that measures approximately 3.5” X 4.5” X .375”.  It is soft blue and has the impression of two kittens on the front, with the inscription of “Hello Kitty”.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As many other reviewers have noted, when you first open the case, there is the smell of vinyl but left in the open air, the smell quickly fades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handles are all lacquered finished and are appropriate in size to the application.  The large brush tips have large round handles, the delicate tips have small handles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very nice set of cosmetic brushes.  It is extremely handy for travel.  It also makes an excellent gift.  My niece actually did the testing of the brushes and she loved them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for testing/review purposes</li>
    <li> The brushes worked ok, not as good as my other brushes, but these would be good for beginners.</li>
    <li> This is a compact makeup brush set. It comes with 7 soft, synthetic brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have gotten the most use out of the eyeshadow brushes - a round one and a slated brush. These both do a great job of picking up shadow without dusting it all over the place. The colour went on my lid instead of clinging to the hairs, and I was very happy with the performance of them overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that there are no firm brushes included. I&#x27;m just an average mom who doesn&#x27;t wear a lot of makeup, so perhaps someone who was more professional about their cosmetics would know that this is absolutely a-okay.  I just expected one, small, firm brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case itself seems quite sturdy, and I&#x27;m happy with the loops that hold each brush in place. I would have liked a small mirror as well, just to cut down on items to pack, but overall everything seems to be pretty high quality, particularly at this price point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, the brushes have performed very well. They don&#x27;t lose bristles, I&#x27;ve found them to be excellent for application and I am quite satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product from the company in exchange for an honest review.</li>
    <li> What soft and wonderful brushes...no shedding.  I will enjoy using these for a long time.</li>
    <li> Very soft and strong bristles. works just as good as the more expensive brushes.  Prefer this over my $60 sefora brush set. Great deal. And shipped fast.</li>
    <li> OK, so no I do not use these.  My wife does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. she loves the case and the ability to carry these with her&lt;br /&gt;2..she says that the brushes are high quality and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; She said she wished she had had something like this years ago.&lt;br /&gt;A set of high quality brushes in their won case</li>
    <li> Bought this for the brush holder, not the brushes. I have had the hardest time finding a case for my make up brushes. This is working out great!</li>
    <li> These brushes look and feel great! They did arrive smelling of chemicals, a quick rinse using a bit of baby shampoo or dish soap takes care of that quick enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 7 brushes in this set feel great on my skin, very soft, unlike some of the older brushes I use. Eye shadow applicators never last long, they turn brittle and fall apart long before you run out of shadow. The shadow brush and the eyebrow brush work perfectly for applying my eye makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set comes in a pretty, imitation crocodile case. The color is a rich burgundy,... this looks very nice! Each brush has its own place inside the case and it all snaps closed with two magnetic snaps. Great size for purse or overnight bag! The company also included a cute Hello Kitty facial sponge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This really is a nice set of make up brushes. This set would  make a nice gift or stocking stuffer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided, honest opinion given.</li>
    <li> The brushes are super soft. The lower portion is somewhat harder. The upper centimeter is so snug and soft like Angora-Rabbit-Fur. All are beautifully fanned out evenly and not pressed nowhere or kinked. All are individually wrapped again. The largest with extra thick Plastic-Dome. So far no one has even moult.&lt;br /&gt;The bag is high gloss and in the color pictured. A dried blood red. Looks good and feels OK. No hard plastic feeling. The brushes have here every single pocket and a top case over it, as protection again, a large rollover case (the one over works on all brushes). 2 push buttons close the bag.&lt;br /&gt;Separately, I got a super soft Hello Kitty sponge to.&lt;br /&gt;Here the price and the Performance are agreed.</li>
    <li> Yes indeed.&lt;br /&gt;No, they aren&#x27;t the quality of MAC or even Sephora&#x27;s line, but they are very reasonable for a full set of make up brushes in a travel case.&lt;br /&gt;There was slight shedding with one brush. I used liquid foundation and then vigorously cleaned it with soapy water, and a few hairs came out.&lt;br /&gt;These would be great for a teen or someone experimenting with make up and brushes. You can later decide to invest in better...or you might find that this value set is perfect for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review</li>
    <li> It was a present for my mother and she is very glad with it! The brush set is very good and useful. The bag which contains the brushes is very elegant. My mother says that the brushes are very soft and their quality is high!</li>
    <li> My girls love these......great brushes at very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> As per title description, the product is of good workmanship Chinese arrived in about 20 days, with 7 different brushes utility co the specific use of the brush itself, all meticulously wrapped by plastic bag and protect bristles when necessary and clutch to hold all buttoned magnetized. To the touch, the brushes are very nice and the bristles are very soft brushes in larger and a bit &#x27;harder for smaller brushes precision. A good value for money.</li>
    <li> Great brushes to add to my set! Very soft, doesnt shed, inexpensive, picks up product well. Blends smooth.</li>
    <li> Very nice product for the price...working nice... does not shed even after wash</li>
    <li> I was REALLY worried about buying these after one of my favorite brushes broke but boy am I glad I did!!!!! They are soft as silk and seem to be of very nice quality. I didn&#x27;t have any smell that other reviewers are saying but mine was packaged openly with just a thin film around it along with another thing I purchased. I was shocked that zero hairs have fallen out so far, even on my old favorite name brand (Revlon) brush EVERY SINGLE TIME I used it I was wiping hair away. I haven&#x27;t used the eye brushes yet but they seem much better than the ones I own now so im excited to use them. I&#x27;m going to buy maybe 3 more of these as presents!</li>
    <li> Great! Super soft brushes,  does the work!</li>
    <li> The brushes are great and I like the convenience of having them all in the clutch. Can grab it and go!!!!</li>
    <li> It came how it shows in the picture. the brushes are SOOO SOFT!!! and they added a nice powder puff with the set too...for Free! I love and i Think this was a good investment for such a low price.</li>
    <li> The product worked well for me...it looks same as the picture and description... I like this product...</li>
    <li> The presentation is nice... The pouch is really cute and the brush quality seems pretty good, but the strong chemcial smell as soon as I open the package... YIKES.</li>
    <li> *Disclosure: I was contacted by a rep for Bravolink and provided a free sample for the purposes of giving my thoughts on it.*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over half a year back, these samples came along.  Now, I could have put together a review back then after a few uses, but thought it would be better to see what happens with them over an extended period of time.  So, I gave them to the lady of the house, set a reminder alarm, and ignored them.  As of today, she&#x27;s as in love with the brushes as she was when she first got them.  They&#x27;ve held up really well, without the bristle loss she&#x27;s experienced with other brushes and brush kits.  To her, they are very well made items, and the collection is handy to have.  While she has used the snot out the brushes, the case has seen little use.  Pretty, and she likes that it zips up, but somehow actually using it for something other than collecting dust hasn&#x27;t been in the cards.  Either way, given the cost of ten beans for the whole kit, it&#x27;s money well spent in her mind.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 sets of these. I bought one as a gift for my sister and was so impressed with them that I bought myself a set. Great brush set, especially for the price!!!</li>
    <li> So far I love them they are very soft and it came in less then a week</li>
    <li> Love these brushes! I would give them a five star, but for my personal taste I like my brushes as bit firmer...but these brushes are very well made, super soft, do not shed and they hold makeup well.</li>
    <li> I received this as a gift. It is beautiful. It is made very well and the brushes are very good quality. It is well worth the price!!</li>
    <li> Love these brushes and the bag is super compact.</li>
    <li> Perfect for a beginner. I love the case that came with it, brushes are soft as well. I am just expanding with my makeup collection so I don&#x27;t have any critical reviews.</li>
    <li> I loved these brushes, the only thing is that I had to air them out for about 2 days because they had a ordor to them , but now they don&#x27;t. I really like the way they are soft and feathery and easy to clean, will purchase again when needed.</li>
    <li> Tucked into this clutch pouch is a great set of brushes. Each one is individually wrapped and the larger ones have protective plastic that you can reuse for storage. The bristles are super soft and all the tips, except for one, are rounded. The handles are comfortable to hold and just long enough for easy use. The brushes come in a nice variety of sizes and shapes, perfect for just about any make-up application. The kit does have a glue smell when you first open it but it dissipates over time. The case has a flip over piece to keep the brushes in and snaps closed in two places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for testing.</li>
    <li> I love the brush set! The brush hairs are very soft and do not shed. The hairs are firmly secured in place and the handles are sturdy. The brushes had a chemical smell and lots of powder in the hairs when they first arrived, but after one wash they were odor free and work very well. Blending is easy with these brushes. I received these as a sample for review.</li>
    <li> The Bravolink Fashion Cosmetic Brush Set would make a lovely gift for the lady in your life.  The alligator look polyurethane case has individual pockets for each of the 7 high quality brushes.  These brushes vary in size as well as the style of the brush to facilitate the application of beauty products on different areas of the face.  The case I received was in a deep rich burgundy color which I found to be very attractive.  Brush handles are a deep red with a black accent color.  The brush hairs are soft brown with lighter gray tips.  The case folds neatly over the brushes and is secured by 2 magnet button closures.  The brush hairs are excellent quality and no hairs fell out during usage.  The brushes are soft and glide easily across the skin for the even application of make up.  Great product!  It also came with an &amp;#34;Hello Kitty&amp;#34; Make up Sponge as a gift.</li>
    <li> Note: The supplier provided me with a review sample, no attempt was made to influence my opinion of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off as I&#x27;ve almost no experience of make up brushes (bar school drama/plays) I gave the set to a lady who would have some idea of what the product performs like and to give me some feedback on the brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set comes with 7 brushes in total from a bigger blusher brush down to the eye shadow/liner brushes pretty much a kit that meets most needs. It&#x27;s enclosed in a &amp;#34;pretend crocodile skin&amp;#34; case with a magnetic closing mechanism, each brush has a varnished handle and seems to be well finished during manufacturing. There is a covering on each brush and handle from the factory, you remove this and you can see the brush type printed on the handle. Little to complain about here, you also get a &amp;#34;hello kitty&amp;#34; soft sponge for make up removal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of how good the brushes are the feedback I got was &amp;#34;a solid 7 out of 10&amp;#34; ie good for the bracket they are positioned in. The bristles are well made and of the appropriate softness (ie the blusher is nice and soft as required) Make up brush kits vary wildly in price (so I am informed) from the ultra bargain level right up to the top tier products (which can be quite expensive for a single brush)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This kit seems to do well for the segment it&#x27;s aimed at. I delayed the review a few weeks so I could get some longer term feedback from the person I gave them to, and they seem to feel they are a decent set overall, not top level but better than many lower end offerings. It&#x27;s down to taste if you like the &amp;#34;crocodile effect&amp;#34; case it seems to be well made and does the job of housing the brushes and protecting them from damage, also handy to carry them around in one package rather than brushes moving around a bag. Like another reviewer I noticed a fairly strong plastic type smell which I assume is from manufacturing of the case this dropped off though after a while. Overall a decent little set of brushes and worth checking out.hough after a while. Overall a decent little set of brushes and worth checking out.</li>
    <li> The brushes are great! The clutch smelled absolutely terrible like some chemical. I threw it out. The brushes were not affected. Now I&#x27;m left with half of what i paid for...</li>
    <li> Really cute pouch. Brushes work good. Did have a faint smell but nothing a quick wash didnt fix.</li>
    <li> this were great brushes i LOVED THEM!!!</li>
    <li> Great quality and very soft just wish the brushes were a little bigger</li>
    <li> Awesome Set  !!!!  Love them !!!</li>
    <li> Looks exactly as pictured! Attractive brushes, practical case.</li>
    <li> 😍😍😍 perfect n fast shipping</li>
    <li> Sheds like crazy and the brushes are actually too soft/flimsy to work properly. Spend an extra 10 and get a better set.</li>
    <li> If you prefer using a brush over sponges for makeup application, this is the perfect set.  It contains 7 brushes of varying sizes and uses, everything from a tiny lipliner brush up to a big poufy loose powder brush.  Mine also came with a nice little makeup sponge with a Hello Kitty design on it.  I have two teen daughters so I was barely able to test this set before it disappeared.  However, both daughters loved these brushes and said to give them five stars when I write my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried one of the smaller brushes for applying lipstick, and was pleased with the just-firm enough synthetic bristles.  One of the larger brushes worked perfectly for applying blush, and I even splurged and tried some eyeshadow with one of the medium brushes.  I didn&#x27;t find one loose bristle, and the handles are well made and comfortable to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with was the patent leather crocodile storage case.  It had a noticeable smell of plastic, which mostly faded when I aired it out.  The case makes it easy to store or travel with the brushes without messing up the bristles, and would make this collection into a nice gift too.  My daughters have the brushes in a makeup organizer, standing on their handle ends, and I&#x27;m not sure where the case went.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a complimentary Bravolink cosmetic brush set for testing and review purposes.  I wasn&#x27;t asked to give a positive review, and this review is my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> This brush set is very beautiful and useful, as well.  The synthetic sable fibers are hygienic and cruelty-free.  They have just the right amount of stiffness for applying makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes range in overall length from 6 3/8 to 4 5/8 inches.  The metal ferrules are finished in a glossy black and the handles are carmine with a smooth lacquer-like finish for an elegant look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trifold case is a faux patent crocodile with a nylon interior and double snaps.  It does a good job protecting the brushes for storage, although I doubt I will be using it everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a variety of shapes for different purposes.  Seven brushes are included for blush, foundation, eye contour, eye shadow, bronzer, lipstick, and eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handles are comfortable in the hand, the bristles are easy to wash, and there is no noticeable shedding, so they are truly a pleasure to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bravolink provided a brush set for evaluation and review.</li>
    <li> This seven brush cosmetics brush set from Bravolink is very good for the price, and is very portable given the stylish clutch-style case that comes with it. The brushes have a nice edge that allows easy application, and they have long, comfortable handles that help keep your hand from fatiguing quickly. If you are in the market for a nice travel case like this, give this one a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mother works for Clinique and her favorite Clinique brushes cost $16 to $30 each... this entire set can be had for less than the cost of one of her brushes. In comparison to the brushes she likes, these are almost as soft, also made of anti-bacterial material, and have nice edges. Her more expensive brushes seem fuller, but a set of seven of her brushes would cost at least $150.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a nice, affordable set of brushes (and sponges) that can be taken with your wherever you go, and will not break your piggy bank. I like this set and it is in my purse as I type; this five star rating would be good up to about twice what the set is currently selling for - it has a very good price-to-sales ratio right now. I did receive this set gratis from the manufacturer and put it to use objectively find out how well the brushes performed. My statements here reflect this testing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a good set of basic cosmetics brushes that are portable and affordable, for use as I have described above, them I would recommend that you give these Bravolink brushes a try. There are better brushes out there, at much higher price points, but if you are looking for a good travel kit that is going to get bounced around a bit anyway... why worry?  At this price get two sets, and bring the others into play as these need replacing. They seem to be a very good deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go for it.</li>
    <li> Received these in a very nice stylish case, all the brushes fit snuggly in the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quality of the brushes is very good, there are 7 in total&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You get a good variety, a large brush, a tapered brush, rounded brush, flat brush, slanted, narrow and even one for your lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product at a very good price, didn’t think the quality would be this good at the price.</li>
    <li> I bought these brushes because the ones I had were old and I wanted to get ones that were clearly presented as cruelty free. These brushes are REALLY nice especially for the price. They are nice and soft and clean well. I also like that they come in a clutch so they don&#x27;t get lost.</li>
    <li> I love the clutch and the brushes well made for what I paid they feel great</li>
