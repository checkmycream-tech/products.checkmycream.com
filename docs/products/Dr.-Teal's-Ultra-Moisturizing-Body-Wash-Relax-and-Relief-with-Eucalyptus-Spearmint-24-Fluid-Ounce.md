    <li> Found this in Walgren&#x27;s and went back to pick it up again and they weren&#x27;t carrying the body wash any longer. I came home got on Amazon and there it was; a few dollars more in price, but worth it. I love the fresh clean scent it leaves.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Dr. Teal&#x27;s Epsom Salts for a lil while and I love them. But sometimes there&#x27;s just no time to take a bath and you want the same effect so this Body Wash is a great substitute! This Eucalyptus Spearmint scent is really refreshing and invigorates you. It lathers up well and also has Epsom Salt ingredients as well so it&#x27;s almost like taking a bath. The only thing is, I wish they didn&#x27;t use SLS.</li>
    <li> Leaves skin looking and feeling healthy, soft and smelling great!</li>
