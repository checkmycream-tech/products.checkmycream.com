      <li>I get highlights, and if they end up in the &amp;#34;orange range&amp;#34; for whatever reason I get a great tone using this product.  </li>
      <li>It seems to have taken care of the problem very nicely.  </li>
      <li>It smells very nice too.  </li>
      <li>I love it because it makes her hair sparkly and sexy!!!!</li>
      <li>The texture and smell were pleasant and it seemed to do what it promised</li>
      <li>Good stuff.</li>
      <li>Use a couple times a week to keep your blond hair gorgeous.</li>
      <li>so I would suggest getting a good conditioner</li>
      <li>I was happy and relieved to find it available on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>Amazing product.</li>
      <li>smells nice though</li>
      <li>Nice scent, too.  </li>
      <li>It lathers super great.  </li>
      <li>This stuff has a better smell and lathers nice.</li>
      <li>is a beautiful bright white</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t know if it was any better than my Sally&#x27;s beauty brand.</li>
      <li>I like this better than the Shimmer Lights I was using.</li>
      <li>and I enjoyed the look of my salt-and-pepper hair.  </li>
      <li>OK, I do</li>
      <li>When my hairdresser stopped selling it, I was urged to buy a replacement product that she said was better than So Silver.  </li>
      <li>I just love this shampoo.</li>
      <li>It is THE most heavenly smelling shampoo I have ever smelt....</li>
      <li>I love So Silver.</li>
      <li>It is a BRIGHT PURPLE color, goes on nicely, lathers up well and make your hair very soft.  </li>
      <li>No unpleasant smell and nice lathering.</li>
      <li>Excellent product; hair shiny, not dull, and very manageable</li>
      <li>Be sure and have a rich conditioner on hand or use it when you can oil your hair up afterward and not leave the house.</li>
      <li>I am a HUGE fan of this shampoo.  </li>
      <li>A worth while purchase!</li>
      <li>I wish it were foamy and soapy, but the purple color is really the most important part of the shampoo.</li>
      <li>Love this shampoo Thanks for the prompt service</li>
      <li>My hair started to turn white many, many years ago</li>
      <li>/&gt;Jhirmack Silver Brightening Shampoo would really turn my hair bright white like a light.</li>
      <li>Good for dry or problem hair, too.  </li>
      <li>I was astounded with the results after just the first use!</li>
      <li>I also add my own highlights and occasionally they get brassy.  </li>
      <li>Not as good as I expected, and the smell was not inviting.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fairly powerful stuff</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for keeping highlights looking fresh (&amp; not brassy!), but recently I tried doing my own highlights at home &amp; didn&#x27;t leave the bleach on long enough, which resulted in orangey streaks.</li>
      <li>So Silver covers any yellow that sometimes happens with white hair, and it gives a gloss that is beautiful.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really &amp;#34;love it&amp;#34; as it is not something special or handmade......it is shampoo manufactured by a known company.</li>
      <li>It has a lot of purple pigment in it, so it does a great job of toning out brassy or yellow tones from blonde and silver hair.</li>
      <li>Smell is a little strong and it tends to leave my hair stiff, but I follow up with WEN and comes out great!</li>
      <li>like to know what exactly it is that gives these shampoos their brightening power?</li>
      <li>I have never encountered this problem when getting my hair lightened before and was pretty bummed,  until I remembered this product.  </li>
      <li>My hair also became oily more quickly than with other shampoos.  </li>
      <li>This shampoo majorly toned the brassy color down &amp; made the highlights very nice.</li>
      <li>After going to the hairdresser and her turning my hair a nice orange colour, this product has worked well to tone it all down.</li>
      <li>It makes my grey to white hair look gorgeous.</li>
      <li>even after rinsing endlessly, it was overwhelming.</li>
      <li>it makes my blonde look fresh, brighter and shinier!</li>
      <li>It makes my grey hair look great by taking out the dreaded yellow tinge that grey hair often develops.  </li>
      <li>My hair looks vibrant after I wash it with So Silver.  </li>
      <li>Even when it had turned completely white, it continued to be shiny and bright until a few months ago when it developed a yellowy tinge in one spot.  </li>
      <li>I live this product.</li>
      <li>No more brassiness in my hair :)</li>
      <li>It keeps my hair looking healthy and shiny and gets me quite a few compliments!</li>
      <li>First off, I will say that there is the BIGGEST disclaimer on the back about allergies, and testing , and danger....</li>
      <li>After just a couple uses the yellow started toning down and within a couple of weeks my hair looked 100% better</li>
      <li>I have used this shampoo for a long time, but recently I have only been able to find it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Needs improving as far as the smell and end results.</li>
      <li>Wife loves it as she is going for the natural look as she ages.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it at least once a week since and love it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this shampoo for over 10 years on my naturally gray hair.  </li>
      <li>Hair is also manageable and soft; I do not use a conditioner with it.</li>
      <li>I finally ran out of Jhirmack Silver Brightening Shampoo (i have very little hair left, shampoo lasts a loooog time :o) ) and could not find it at my local stores (so far), so I picked up this Matrix Total Results Color Care</li>
      <li>I had been looking for something to brighten my dull grey hair and chose this product because some of the reviews I read seemed to find it effective.</li>
      <li>You only need a tiny amount as this shampoo as is very concentrated.  </li>
      <li>Now I use a regular shampoo for the first wash and rinse, then I use a smaller amount of the So Silver for the second wash and rinse.</li>
      <li>It does a great job and it doesn&#x27;t smell bad</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m growing out my dyed hair and letting it get to its natural shade of brown mixed in with lots of gray.  </li>
      <li>My only caution is that the shampoo does seem to leave my hair somewhat dry and lacking body, so I have added conditioner to my hair-washing routine, with very satisfactory results.</li>
      <li>I went grey early and this product helps make my greys sparkle!</li>
      <li>Recently went to a new stylist and left with yellow hair!  </li>
      <li>Really overpowering - kind of a cross between bad perfume and man&#x27;s cologne.  </li>
      <li>Was left with exactly the same old dull, color challenged hair.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Have been using this for several years so my hair stays silver without any yellowing.  It&#x27;s fairly powerful stuff and now that my hair is thinning I only use it once every couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> Smell is a little strong and it tends to leave my hair stiff, but I follow up with WEN and comes out great!</li>
    <li> I was worried this product would be harsh on my hair from other reviews i read but i havent had any problems.  Keeps the brass out of my blonde</li>
    <li> Keeps my silver hair from yellowing. I use it twice a week, and never have a problem with dull or yellowing hair!</li>
    <li> Took the yellow out of my hair.  Great product</li>
    <li> It has definitely brightened my silvers and isn&#x27;t overly drying to my hair so long as I use conditioner with it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo for over 10 years on my naturally gray hair.  If you are a first time user, don&#x27;t be shocked by the purple color---it helps balance the tone of your gray. Hair is also manageable and soft; I do not use a conditioner with it.</li>
    <li> Not as good as I expected, and the smell was not inviting. Needs improving as far as the smell and end results. Will try a cheaper brand next time.</li>
    <li> The best purple shampoo for the price! It has a lot of purple pigment in it, so it does a great job of toning out brassy or yellow tones from blonde and silver hair.</li>
    <li> ...is the fragrance.  Really overpowering - kind of a cross between bad perfume and man&#x27;s cologne.  And it lasts...even after rinsing endlessly, it was overwhelming.</li>
    <li> I was astounded with the results after just the first use! My hair had gotten quite brassy and I needed an at home fix to bring back my brighter, whiter blonde highlights. I use this shampoo once a week now to keep my highlights from getting brassy. I bought the small bottle as a trial, but I will definitely be buying the large bottle next time!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years now and find it is the only one that works for my hair.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for three weeks now, once a week and do not see the yellow leaving my hair. A little disappointed.</li>
    <li> If you have yellowing or greenish color to your grey hair this shampoo does tone that down.  I&#x27;d recommend to&lt;br /&gt;Anyone who has grey hair.</li>
    <li> I have used this shampoo for a long time, but recently I have only been able to find it on Amazon. It makes my grey to white hair look gorgeous.</li>
    <li> I bought this not because I have gray hair...OK, I do but I color the gray away.  I also add my own highlights and occasionally they get brassy.  I bought this hoping to neutralize the highlights and make the blonde less yellow.  First off, I will say that there is the BIGGEST disclaimer on the back about allergies, and testing , and danger....another reviewer said it spooked her from even using the product.  Use gloves to apply shampoo??  I was planning to use it in the shower for Pete&#x27;s sake.  I didn&#x27;t test it ahead of time, or use gloves.  It didn&#x27;t make my head melt and I didn&#x27;t grow a third eye.  I had no allergic reaction.  It is THE most heavenly smelling shampoo I have ever smelt....I would buy this as perfume if they sold it.  It is a BRIGHT PURPLE color, goes on nicely, lathers up well and make your hair very soft.  And it worked to tone down the brassiness.....not perfect.....it&#x27;s not a miracle worker.  But my brassy highlights were less brassy.</li>
    <li> I had been looking for something to brighten my dull grey hair and chose this product because some of the reviews I read seemed to find it effective. After having used it, I feel I simply paid for an expensive and ordinary  shampoo. There was no brightening, zilch. Was left with exactly the same old dull, color challenged hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m growing out my dyed hair and letting it get to its natural shade of brown mixed in with lots of gray.  This shampoo is keeping the white hair white, now yellow.  No unpleasant smell and nice lathering.</li>
    <li> Best purple shampoo I&#x27;ve tried but still not that amazing. smells nice though</li>
    <li> This is the second time I ordered this shampoo.  I get highlights, and if they end up in the &amp;#34;orange range&amp;#34; for whatever reason I get a great tone using this product.  It lathers super great.  A little goes a long way.  It smells very nice too.  A worth while purchase!</li>
    <li> My hair looks vibrant after I wash it with So Silver.  But only use it once a week to avoid blue hair.</li>
    <li> I just love this shampoo. It&#x27;s great for keeping highlights looking fresh (&amp; not brassy!), but recently I tried doing my own highlights at home &amp; didn&#x27;t leave the bleach on long enough, which resulted in orangey streaks. This shampoo majorly toned the brassy color down &amp; made the highlights very nice.</li>
    <li> I wish it were foamy and soapy, but the purple color is really the most important part of the shampoo.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really &amp;#34;love it&amp;#34; as it is not something special or handmade......it is shampoo manufactured by a known company. But I don&#x27;t think I should ding the supplier here with a lower rating as they sold and delivered what was advertised.</li>
    <li> You only need a tiny amount as this shampoo as is very concentrated.  Use a couple times a week to keep your blond hair gorgeous.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years on my snow white hair.  When my hairdresser stopped selling it, I was urged to buy a replacement product that she said was better than So Silver.  It didn&#x27;t even come close to the results I was used to.  I was happy and relieved to find it available on Amazon.  So Silver covers any yellow that sometimes happens with white hair, and it gives a gloss that is beautiful.  Your hair will shine and almost glow, and I get compliments everywhere I go.  As long as I can buy this product, I will never use any other.  I love So Silver.</li>
    <li> Good stuff. Keeps hair a beautiful silvery color.</li>
    <li> when you have white hair like me, it tends to get a yellow tinge! this shampoo is awesome!!! i get compliments all the time!!!</li>
    <li> Great product. I have black hair and red undertones are always prevalent when I try to go lighter. I left it on for 5 minutes. You will need a deep conditioner afterwards since it drys the hair initially</li>
    <li> seriously! someone told me about this product so I tried it! it makes my blonde look fresh, brighter and shinier! It only last for about 2 days though but I have greasy hair so I have to wash it every other day anyway! It does dry out your hair some so I would suggest getting a good conditioner I believe they make a conditioner but I havent tried it! I just use regular conditioner and than an oil on my hair when Im done in the shower, it seems to help!</li>
    <li> Ive never used shampoo like this one.The shampoo is purple and it leaves your hair shiny.I tried this couple years ago and found it recently at a hair salon</li>
    <li> I read other reviews that warned this product would be drying and boy was it ever. Be sure and have a rich conditioner on hand or use it when you can oil your hair up afterward and not leave the house.The texture and smell were pleasant and it seemed to do what it promised but I don&#x27;t know if it was any better than my Sally&#x27;s beauty brand.</li>
    <li> I am a HUGE fan of this shampoo.  Recalled using it in the past to enhance my highlights as recommended by my stylist at the time.  Recently went to a new stylist and left with yellow hair!  I have never encountered this problem when getting my hair lightened before and was pretty bummed,  until I remembered this product.  What a lifesaver!  After just a couple uses the yellow started toning down and within a couple of weeks my hair looked 100% better and I did not have to go in for a color correction.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo Thanks for the prompt service</li>
    <li> Wowzers this stuff is purple!  I like this better than the Shimmer Lights I was using. This stuff has a better smell and lathers nice. It can be a little drying so I use the Joico Violet conditioner. No more brassiness in my hair :)</li>
    <li> After going to the hairdresser and her turning my hair a nice orange colour, this product has worked well to tone it all down. I would definitely recommend it. It does seem to be a bit drying, so I recommend applying conditioner after you use the shampoo</li>
    <li> Very happy with product</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the results. A couple uses and i can already see results. Amazing product. Arrived on time, and amazing product!!</li>
    <li> My hair started to turn white many, many years ago and I enjoyed the look of my salt-and-pepper hair.  Even when it had turned completely white, it continued to be shiny and bright until a few months ago when it developed a yellowy tinge in one spot.  When the  yellow began to look as if it was going to be a permanent addition, I started to use the So Silver shampoo.  It seems to have taken care of the problem very nicely.  My only caution is that the shampoo does seem to leave my hair somewhat dry and lacking body, so I have added conditioner to my hair-washing routine, with very satisfactory results.</li>
    <li> The product is what I ordered, however I can&#x27;t read the instructions as they are not in English.</li>
    <li> Everything came as expected.</li>
    <li> This was recommended a couple of years ago to take the brassiness for my white hair.  I&#x27;ve been using it at least once a week since and love it.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t know I could use this for blonde hair!</li>
    <li> It makes my grey hair look great by taking out the dreaded yellow tinge that grey hair often develops.  One needs to be careful since it contains a purple dye to mask the yellow. After it has been used several times ones hair can become too purple looking. When my hair began to look purplish I didn&#x27;t use it as often, alternating it with another shampoo. Now I use a regular shampoo for the first wash and rinse, then I use a smaller amount of the So Silver for the second wash and rinse. It keeps my hair looking healthy and shiny and gets me quite a few compliments!</li>
    <li> It helps conditioning and makes it shiny as well.  Nice scent, too.  Good for dry or problem hair, too.  Try this.</li>
    <li> I totally trust Matrix/Biolage products. Its all i&#x27;ve used for a long time now. This product takes the dull grey hairs and whitens them. Im told it also takes the brassy-ness out of blonde hair. I went grey early and this product helps make my greys sparkle!</li>
    <li> Wife loves it as she is going for the natural look as she ages.  I love it because it makes her hair sparkly and sexy!!!!</li>
    <li> It does the job but I was hoping it would start lighting the rest of my hair front is a beautiful bright white the back is still blackish.</li>
    <li> This shampoo removed the brassiness but left my hair somewhat weighed down. My hair also became oily more quickly than with other shampoos.  I have very thick straight hair.</li>
    <li> I live this product. It does a great job and it doesn&#x27;t smell bad</li>
    <li> Only purple shampoo I use to achieve my platinum hair.</li>
    <li> Used for years so a replacement.  Excellent product; hair shiny, not dull, and very manageable</li>
    <li> I finally ran out of Jhirmack Silver Brightening Shampoo (i have very little hair left, shampoo lasts a loooog time :o) ) and could not find it at my local stores (so far), so I picked up this Matrix Total Results Color Care So Silver Shampoo. NOTHING. No brightening AT ALL. Not even a glimmer, shimmer or shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jhirmack Silver Brightening Shampoo would really turn my hair bright white like a light. So I came to amazon to see if I could purchase it online. And yeah it&#x27;s here but I read in the reviews that it no longer has the brightening punch that it use to. :o(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d like to know what exactly it is that gives these shampoos their brightening power? Anyone know?&lt;br /&gt;And can anyone recommend another brightening shampoo?</li>
    <li> It helps gray hair from turning yellow/gold.</li>
