    <li> Great and I love it.  Works good.</li>
    <li> was great paid less money for a great product...Thanks. My daughter curly hair  is happy.and my wallet too Ha ha....</li>
    <li> I have been using several Ouidad products but when I started using this shampoo my scalp became irritated, my hair didn&#x27;t feel clean and then my hair started falling out. Luckily I have very thick hair! By process of elimination the shampoo was the culprit. I stopped using it and my head feels much better.</li>
    <li> This product really makes wavy,  color treated hair soft and very workable without a lot of product afterwards. Get the conditioner also.</li>
    <li> If your hair is thin, limp and also frizzy in humidity, you may like this shampoo as much as I do. I find it very easy to blow dry into shiny waves that last in most weather.</li>
    <li> Dissatisfied ...made my Curley hair fuzzy.  B &amp; B, though more expensive, much better results.  Curley Girl also much better.</li>
    <li> love it. it keeps your hair from frizzing the smell is ok they should come out with better smelling products</li>
    <li> This is a great shampoo for anyone with frizzy or dry hair.  It really works!  Keeps hair manageable and soft.</li>
    <li> I have a terrible frizz problem and was recommended ouidad from my friend that has gorgeous curls. I use this in conjunction with the ouidad humidity and climate control gel. After a week I started noticing a change in my hair while also using a satin pillow case. For once I dont wake up or walk around with puffy and frizzy hair! A little goes a long way with their products. My regimen for hair: Ouidad shampoo once a week, cowash using devacurl every 3 days and too shea conditioner in between. The gel I use daily to restyle my curls. Routine has been working perfectly so far but nothing would work without ouidad &#x3D;]</li>
    <li> We lost our power for eight days and had no hot water. We drove to my sister-in-law&#x27;s house to shower since she had power. I used her shampoo and the conditioner! Wow! She has very curly hair. I don&#x27;t, but with age, my hair tends to frizz with the slightest humidity. This shampoo and conditioner helped my hair considerably.</li>
    <li> I really wish this had a better smell!  Can&#x27;t use it due to the lingering, horrible smell!  The conditioner smells the same.</li>
    <li> I have 4b/4c hair and this totally made my hair feel dry and tangled. It seems to strip your hair of all oils.</li>
    <li> Great for fine thin hair. Thickens.</li>
    <li> Always a fan of ouidad. Make sure u read the directions. It works when you listen.</li>
    <li> And unlike the other two reviewers I L-O-V-E the smell! It smells like you&#x27;re in the salon. It really does help if you follow the directions on the back exactly. Even if you two scrub and scrunch your shampoo in your hair, it comes out shiny; but if you just gently massage it in it will totally show when your hair dries. You won&#x27;t be frizzy!</li>
    <li> This stuff is the only product that controls my hair without making it hard. My favorite product thus far. Came quickly as well</li>
    <li> Great Shampoo!  Made hair soft and shiny.  Didn&#x27;t need gel. Better than I expected-will definitely buy again.  Wish bottle was larger.</li>
    <li> I find that Trader Joe&#x27;s $3 salon shampoo does just as well as this.</li>
    <li> works great for tight kinky curly hair. does not cause drying out or breakage. great for everyday use. I recommend Ouidad for everyone with curly hair.</li>
