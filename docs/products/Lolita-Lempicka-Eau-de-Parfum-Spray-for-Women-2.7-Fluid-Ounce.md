      <li>Using your hands will blend with your own chemistry.</li>

      <li>It is difficult to find a perfect perfume for my wife&#x60;s taste, this one attends perfectly her desire for a good perfume.</li>
      <li>Great deal for such an amazing scent!</li>
      <li>and I haven&#x27;t smelled a better cinnamon vanilla that isn&#x27;t too foody.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely LOVE this perfume.  </li>
      <li>My all time favorite perfume.</li>
      <li>:}</li>
      <li>LOVE it.  </li>
      <li>Every time I have it sprayed on I get many compliments.</li>
      <li>It smells like baby powder, vanilla and cinnamon - LOVE this scent.</li>
      <li>:)  </li>
      <li>we love it.</li>
      <li>I love having a signature fragrance</li>
      <li>Either way, although I am devastated not to be able to buy it in stores, I won&#x27;t purchase from here again.</li>
      <li>I am really enjoying this scent</li>
      <li>This is my favorite scent.  </li>
      <li>and I get so many compliments.</li>
      <li>This scent is so unique it changes with the person who wears it!  </li>
      <li>review said it&#x27;s too strong, but perfume needs to be on your skin not your clothes.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s strong without being overpowering</li>
      <li>This is one sexy sweet perfume, smells like a sweaty salty day at the beach with chocolate and a burning fire.</li>
      <li>so if you are looking for the great romance of your life, it might be this perfume, as it smells slightly different on everyone.</li>
      <li>and right now it&#x27;s L, with sometimes the original Lolita blended on top for night.</li>
      <li>Although the perfume was sealed in its original box...</li>
      <li>The bottle is a unique shape.</li>
      <li>Stick with the original Lolita Lempicka perfume, trust me.</li>
      <li>This rendition is an oriental scent that is a bit spicy, with rich musky overtones.</li>
      <li>At any other time of the year, I would say this perfume is too strong for day wear, but I think it is a great winter perfume.</li>
      <li>I loved the sample and ordered the big bottle.</li>
      <li>And if you really have to have it in your hair, spray it on your hands, rub together and rub through damp hair, more toward the scalp</li>
      <li>I think I was looking for fresh scents at the time.</li>
      <li>On your skin it can blend with your own chemistry to give off your uniquely own subtle scent.</li>
      <li>nearly as much as the original Lolita Lempicka fragrance.</li>
      <li>Has a funny smell to it.</li>
      <li>Will most def buy from this vendor in the future!!!!!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s like being in a bakery during winter, where it&#x27;s warm and cozy and full of life giving smells.</li>
      <li>This fragrance is hard to find in this larger size, so I jumped on it when I saw it and the best part was the price.  </li>
      <li>I smelled this perfume a while back when it first came out and thought it was too strong.</li>
      <li>I hardly ever get near my fiance that he doesn&#x27;t say you smell good!</li>
      <li>Even though I describe it as sweet its not cloying and definitely not a little girl&#x27;s scent.</li>
      <li>I love it enough to have a full bottle, my second time purchasing it from Sephora where it cost me a hefty $80, just for the bottle.</li>
      <li>It had been some time since I purchased the first bottle, so I had forgotten that the perfume color is suppose to be blue, but once I found the original I had bought yrs ago..</li>
      <li>I noticed the perfume was BROWN not the Light Blue color it is SUPPOSE to be..</li>
      <li>two important male reactions to L..</li>
      <li>It would also be nice as just an evening perfume for year round.  </li>
      <li>However, this particular bottle that I ordered leaked, and then the perfume leached holes onto things that it touched.  </li>
      <li>my favorite male and a recommendation from someone without an emotional attachment!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been with him a long time and this is the first perfume that really gets attention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>a bit old lady smelling.</li>
      <li>(beauty industry in my old</li>
      <li>This perfume was old when I received it.  </li>
      <li>I noticed the color difference,as with this perfume as it ages (Gets OLD)</li>
      <li>Sells OLD product..</li>
      <li>As soon as you&#x27;re out of the shower, toweled off but skin still damp and warm, spray lightly (or liberally if you have a least an hour before you dress) on your whole body, even behind your knees.</li>
      <li>I love how deep and complex the scent is.  </li>
      <li>I typically put it on first thing in the morning and by early evening may receive a compliment or two.  </li>
      <li>Quite frankly, I think it&#x27;s a bit masculine, which is obviously a turnoff.</li>

<li> Filed a claim, but it has been over 14 days, so I am now stuck with this OLD perfume..40.00+ down the drain..</li>
<li> Someone taught me this long ago.</li>
<li> It lasts all day long</li>
<li> For example, I left the bottle sitting on my solid wood dresser, and the small amount of liquid accumulating under the bottom of the bottle actually leached the finish off of the wood in just one day.  </li>
<li> One hot summer when I had just come from outside, a co-worker, much younger said Can I say something and don&#x27;t take this the wrong way?</li>
<li> The notes include gomphrena, bergamot, bitter orange, cinnamon, vanilla and musk.</li>
<li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
<li> I received it as a sample with a beauty supply order and spent no time at all tracking it down through Amazon.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve purchased almost 5 bottles of this over the last few years and usually at a department store.</li>
<li> I am a perfume fanatic, always trying different scents.</li>
<li> I tend to wear it manly in the winter since it&#x27;s heavy.  </li>
<li> But it&#x27;s a touch complex on me</li>
<li> If you like your perfume subtle, this probably isn&#x27;t it.</li>
<li> Only thing I was disappointed about was when I opened the box I ordered on-line</li>
<li> NOT HAPPY.</li>
<li> but I can see that some people may be uncomfortable with it at work although not me.</li>
<li> it was brown and had turned bad.</li>
<li> Highly Disappointed!</li>
<li> Very disappointed about the seller but will forever be looking for this in stores</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this scent since 2007.  I continue to get compliments from both guys and gals on a regular basis.  A little goes a long way.  My last 2.7 oz bottle lasted for almost a year and I spray it on daily.  The sent also lasts throughout the day.  I typically put it on first thing in the morning and by early evening may receive a compliment or two.  I love this perfume and hope you will too!!!</li>
    <li> I loved the sample and ordered the big bottle. Its does not smell the same as the sample did. Highly Disappointed!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful oriental floral loud perfume created by famous nose Maurice Roucel which creations include the unforgettable tocade and musk ravageur. The notes include gomphrena, bergamot, bitter orange, cinnamon, vanilla and musk. The seller store 123 had it for the best price and shipped very quickly this item in mint condition.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like \\&quot;L\\&quot; nearly as much as the original Lolita Lempicka fragrance. This rendition is an oriental scent that is a bit spicy, with rich musky overtones. Quite frankly, I think it&#x27;s a bit masculine, which is obviously a turnoff. Stick with the original Lolita Lempicka perfume, trust me.</li>
    <li> I am a perfume fanatic, always trying different scents. I smelled this perfume a while back when it first came out and thought it was too strong. I think I was looking for fresh scents at the time. :)  This is a wonderful spicy cinnamon vanilla. At any other time of the year, I would say this perfume is too strong for day wear, but I think it is a great winter perfume. It would also be nice as just an evening perfume for year round.  I am really enjoying this scent and I haven&#x27;t smelled a better cinnamon vanilla that isn&#x27;t too foody.  If you like your perfume subtle, this probably isn&#x27;t it. If you don&#x27;t mind a warm, spicy scent, then enjoy!!</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful!  The bottle is a unique shape. Every time I have it sprayed on I get many compliments. It lasts all day long</li>
    <li> Smells delicious, not quite as strong as I thought it would be, though. All my guy friends have complimented me on it.</li>
    <li> I got this product as a sample and searched awhile before finding this.  It smells wonderful! So good I even got the lotion</li>
    <li> This perfume was old when I received it.  Has a funny smell to it.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite scent.  It stays on all day and I get so many compliments. The bottle is beautiful and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> A smell that is totally different than I expected...not like the regular Lolita parfume.&lt;br /&gt;Not pleasing to my my standards...a bit old lady smelling.</li>
    <li> This scent is so unique it changes with the person who wears it!  I received it as a sample with a beauty supply order and spent no time at all tracking it down through Amazon.  Great deal for such an amazing scent!</li>
    <li> This is yummy, deliciously happy. Cinnamon plus vanilla, it&#x27;s like being in a bakery during winter, where it&#x27;s warm and cozy and full of life giving smells. It&#x27;s strong without being overpowering but I can see that some people may be uncomfortable with it at work although not me. Even though I describe it as sweet its not cloying and definitely not a little girl&#x27;s scent. But it&#x27;s a touch complex on me so if you are looking for the great romance of your life, it might be this perfume, as it smells slightly different on everyone. I love it enough to have a full bottle, my second time purchasing it from Sephora where it cost me a hefty $80, just for the bottle. Worth a try at least. Go for it!</li>
    <li> I love how deep and complex the scent is.  I tend to wear it manly in the winter since it&#x27;s heavy.  I love it!</li>
    <li> This is one sexy sweet perfume, smells like a sweaty salty day at the beach with chocolate and a burning fire. Maybe a tiny \\&quot;hippy\\&quot; note. My all time favorite perfume.</li>
    <li> It is difficult to find a perfect perfume for my wife&#x60;s taste, this one attends perfectly her desire for a good perfume. we love it.</li>
    <li> Purchased this perfume, THINKING, I would be getting what I bought sometime back..which was a Beautiful Bottle with BLUE perfume inside of the beautiful bottle..NOT the case with this seller..Although the perfume was sealed in its original box...once taking it out of the box...I noticed the perfume was BROWN not the Light Blue color it is SUPPOSE to be..It had been some time since I purchased the first bottle, so I had forgotten that the perfume color is suppose to be blue, but once I found the original I had bought yrs ago..I noticed the color difference,as with this perfume as it ages (Gets OLD) it turns an amber color..as my once blue one was starting to do also..BEWARE of this seller..Sells OLD product..Filed a claim, but it has been over 14 days, so I am now stuck with this OLD perfume..40.00+ down the drain..NOT HAPPY. will not buy from this seller again</li>
    <li> This fragrance is hard to find in this larger size, so I jumped on it when I saw it and the best part was the price.  Will most def buy from this vendor in the future!!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased almost 5 bottles of this over the last few years and usually at a department store. It smells like baby powder, vanilla and cinnamon - LOVE this scent. Only thing I was disappointed about was when I opened the box I ordered on-line it was brown and had turned bad. Very disappointed about the seller but will forever be looking for this in stores so I know I&#x27;m getting useable product.</li>
    <li> I love having a signature fragrance and right now it&#x27;s L, with sometimes the original Lolita blended on top for night. I hardly ever get near my fiance that he doesn&#x27;t say you smell good! I&#x27;ve been with him a long time and this is the first perfume that really gets attention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One review said it&#x27;s too strong, but perfume needs to be on your skin not your clothes. On your skin it can blend with your own chemistry to give off your uniquely own subtle scent. Someone taught me this long ago. As soon as you&#x27;re out of the shower, toweled off but skin still damp and warm, spray lightly (or liberally if you have a least an hour before you dress) on your whole body, even behind your knees. And if you really have to have it in your hair, spray it on your hands, rub together and rub through damp hair, more toward the scalp so when you get warm, it warms with you. Using your hands will blend with your own chemistry. (beauty industry in my old life)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my current profession I&#x27;m outside often. One hot summer when I had just come from outside, a co-worker, much younger said Can I say something and don&#x27;t take this the wrong way? I said sure, and he said You smell so good! :} kind of embarrassed, but he Loved this perfume and asked what it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So two important male reactions to L..my favorite male and a recommendation from someone without an emotional attachment!</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this perfume.  LOVE it.  I am heartbroken that Lolita Lempicka no longer seems to make it.  However, this particular bottle that I ordered leaked, and then the perfume leached holes onto things that it touched.  For example, I left the bottle sitting on my solid wood dresser, and the small amount of liquid accumulating under the bottom of the bottle actually leached the finish off of the wood in just one day.  I ordered this for years from Sephora and never had any problems.  I don&#x27;t know if it was just that bottle, or if this was from an overstock supply that had defective bottles or something.  Either way, although I am devastated not to be able to buy it in stores, I won&#x27;t purchase from here again.</li>
