      <li>i LOVED it</li>
      <li>i loved my results.</li>
      <li>The two step process is worth the excellent result.</li>

      <li>, this dye was great, it is a two step process and each process lasts about an hour, just do some house work and the time will go by fast.  </li>
      <li>Make sure you follow the directions they give you except for the tap water.</li>
      <li>While this is not in Henna Hut&#x27;s instructions, some people might experience satisfying results by mixing the henna and indigo together all at once (instead of two separate applications as Henna Hut recommends) and then applying.</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s a lot easier to use then most chemical free products.</li>
      <li>and i am glad it is herbal because i am a health concerned person and Thanks for going HERBAL the way of THE CREATOR and Shalom!!!</li>

      <li>There is no chemical smell and my hair turned out perfect, it is jet black</li>
      <li>I used henna huts Harvest Moon hair dye black and it worked perfectly.</li>

      <li>Overall it&#x27;s a great alternative to dye without chemicals</li>
      <li>This product is fantastic.</li>
      <li>I was so impressed by this Jet Black color!</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t use actual product, but the folks at Henna Hut are very nice.</li>
      <li>the indigo was very grainy and had a very strong \\&quot;too earthy\\</li>
      <li>with all the good reviews it&#x27;s possible my beard hair is just unique??</li>
      <li>You can use this product on your eye brow and beard and it will look natural, it also makes your hair grow really nice.</li>
      <li>First off I will say the henna was SOOOO easy to apply.</li>
      <li>I recommend following Henna Hut&#x27;s instructions to the letter for your first application, so you can be fully impressed with how well it can work... and then experiment with combining them next time to see if that works just as well for you.  </li>
      <li>Keep from damaging your hair and go natural! :)</li>
      <li>I was very careful to follow instructions to the T.  Reddish/brown is better then bright silvery gray, although black would have been better!</li>
      <li>Just keep a deep conditioner and a moisturizer handy.</li>
      <li>We had so much fun visiting</li>
      <li>Once again great black, and once again even with no washing it faded within 4 days!</li>
      <li>I have used all the different \\&quot;henna\\&quot; hair dyes and can say Harvest Moon is the best hands down.</li>
      <li>Well it looked great after I was done, the whole process took a few hours.</li>
      <li>Then I put on the Indigo and my hair became jet black and so soft and beautiful.  </li>
      <li>Perfect black color on my grey goatee.</li>
      <li>I did the two step method recommended on the packages because it was my first time.  </li>
      <li>This is the first time I have used the herbal products.</li>
      <li>I applied it (mostly with my hands) and then put on a shower cap and left it on for about an hour.</li>
      <li>, I hadn&#x27;t washed my hair in the first 48 hours but it still faded.  </li>
      <li>Will be back to get more.</li>
      <li>Thank you so much!</li>
      <li>Just avoid any hair products for the first 24 to 48 hours as this can make your hair turn purple.</li>
      <li>followed directions exactly, nothing happened at all.</li>
      <li>if for some reason it does not work, call them they will figure out what you are doing wrong, the customer service is awesome.</li>
      <li>In fact is was lighter from the first application of henna.</li>
      <li>went on first</li>
      <li>My original  hair was silky smooth , with 30% grey.  </li>
      <li>I think God for a natural product - chemical free that really works.</li>
      <li>The texture was great and it was thick and worked really well.</li>
      <li>Most of the others (started with cheap ones) worked very little if at all.</li>
      <li>i know my hair grows out fast.</li>
      <li>I really like the way my hair looks and feels.</li>
      <li>I washed her hair twice prior with cheap shampoo.</li>

      <li>This is for real.      </li>

      <li>Her hair was super soft as soon as she shampooed it 24 hours later.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Sadly the Brown turned my beard red.. and this made my beard look purple outside in the sun .. with all the good reviews it&#x27;s possible my beard hair is just unique??</li>
    <li> turned some parts of my hair red and took almost 4 hours</li>
    <li> I have used all the different \\&quot;henna\\&quot; hair dyes and can say Harvest Moon is the best hands down. Most of the others (started with cheap ones) worked very little if at all. This one gave me a permanent black and I am so happy I bought a case. Do not let the cover fool you. The cheap ones look good but work horrible. I did not have to boil water, or microwave anything. Just added water and applied. AAAAA+!</li>
    <li> I do not see how this could not work. I used it on my mother and WOW! It is a two step process and the first step turned her extreme red. So the other 2 bad reviews must have very dirty hair. I washed her hair twice prior with cheap shampoo. Mixed the pure henna red orange and let it sit out for 1 hour(started this while we washed her hair). Applied and left on one hour and wow was it red/orange super bright! Then rinsed it and mixed the indigo and immediately applied and left it on again for a little over an hour. We had so much fun visiting I did not notice the time.  Rinsed it out and it was already very dark. The next day it was jet black. She is ecstatic! Her hair was super soft as soon as she shampooed it 24 hours later. I recommend this to anyone and many of my friends are using it. it is super cost effective and very easy to use.    if for some reason it does not work, call them they will figure out what you are doing wrong, the customer service is awesome.</li>
    <li> Used this product on gray hair and it doesn&#x27;t cover the grays fully. Hair is left with a brownish tone.</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic. To hell with Just For Men! Perfect black color on my grey goatee. And now irritation and bumps like when I used Just For Men. Those idiots changed the formula and now people are looking for alternative means. Love Henna Hut.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product because it is all natural and will not damage ones hair.  It came in about 3 days and I applied it as according to the instructions on the pink sheet they give you.  Well it looked great after I was done, the whole process took a few hours. The instructions say not to wash hair for 48 hours, so I did not but within 2 days the black color I had gotten for that first day had pretty much faded back to my normal brown, except now I had reddish highlights from the henna.  I thought maybe the indigo didn&#x27;t stick and so reapplied it and this time left it on for 3 hours ( the max time they say). Once again it looked great... for about 3 days which it again faded to my normal brown, I hadn&#x27;t washed my hair in the first 48 hours but it still faded.  So I decided to give it one last go and this time left it on for 4 hours and added salt as I researched adding salt will help the indigo stick to your hair better.  Once again great black, and once again even with no washing it faded within 4 days! This product was a lot of trouble and a waste of time, please don&#x27;t waste yours</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have used color on my natural 4b hair type. I did not want the chemical hair dye that damages your hair. I read upon the henna coloring and was impressed. It is a conditioner none the less. I tried it nand my color is beautiful. My hair is black and not just black ebony black and is very healthy. It brought life to my hair. Thnak you. Will purchase again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m allergic to hair dye so a friend suggested I try harvest moon henna. I have dark brown hair and the jet black covers the gray totally. I use a shower cap to cover my hair while the color is in. Works wonderful!!!</li>
    <li> Followed the directions it came with, and my hair was not colored one bit. In fact is was lighter from the first application of henna. Waste of money, had to buy black hair dye at the store to cover whatever this product was trying to do.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m about 10% gray on black and am allergic to store bought hair dye. This was a 2 step process, after the 1st step, my bright silvery gray hairs were reddish/brown.  The 2nd step didn&#x27;t seem to do anything to the color. I was very careful to follow instructions to the T.  Reddish/brown is better then bright silvery gray, although black would have been better!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t use actual product, but the folks at Henna Hut are very nice. If I&#x27;m ever going to use it, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll be premium and meet my needs...sold by an outstanding operation.</li>
    <li> I have a severe allergy to traditional hair dye and started using Henna about 6 months ago. I have even gone to a salon to achieve best results. I ordered this because i read great reviews and it was very well priced. I also have very dark brown to black hair and other products didn&#x27;t achieve the color i wanted.   I was so impressed by this Jet Black color! I did do the allergy test just because it was something new and i wasn&#x27;t taking any chances. I had no allergic reaction so i proceeded to use it. I did however have to go to the website to get better directions as to which went on first but other then that it was very easy and very worth it!  The process i used was this: I used distilled water instead of tap just because tap water has so many added things in it that i didn&#x27;t want it messing with the color. I warmed up the water and added it to the henna in a plastic bowl and stirred with a plastic spoon. I applied it (mostly with my hands) and then put on a shower cap and left it on for about an hour. I then rinsed it out with just water and after towel drying my hair i did the same application process with the Indigo but left it on for about 2 hours. The indigo was a bit messier because my hair was damp but a towel to stop dripping works just fine. I rinsed out the indigo with just water and styled it. It is about a week in and my hair is still jet black and awesome! I would suggest not washing your hair for about 3 days after coloring it with henna, just condition it.  I love this product and will continue to order it and use it on my hair!!!</li>
    <li> I used henna huts Harvest Moon hair dye black and it worked perfectly. I washed my hair first, applied the henna and rinsed, then towel dried my hair, mixed the indigo and applied it. I left the indigo for on hour and now all of my gray is gone and my hair is jet black! It looks so natural I could not be any more pleased! Once you do it, you need to remember it is permanent. It has been 6 weeks and all I do is touch up my roots. This was a life saver for me because I am allergic to chemical hair dye.   THANK YOU! for a wonderful product!    Christina</li>
    <li> There was a little mix-up &amp; they fixed it and then some. Thank you so much! Very good quality product, also.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m allergic to the chemicals in just for men (actually blisters my skin!) so have been using mascara for the past few years to cover the gray (heck, pure white not gray).  So, I started thinking that there must have been some advancement in men&#x27;s hair color in the past few years so I researched and came across henna.  Decided to go with the jet black.  A little bit cumbersome to apply the red henna then the indigo, but what the heck.  Followed the directions, left each mixture on for an hour each and rinsed out.  Now on my third week and the grey is finally starting to reappear from the roots - as to be expected.  You can also tell the indigo is starting to wear out and the red starting to show now.  Overall very satisfied that I can ditch the mascara!</li>
    <li> I did the two step method recommended on the packages because it was my first time.  The Henna turned my off-black hair a little lighter and all the gray hairs red.  Then I put on the Indigo and my hair became jet black and so soft and beautiful.  I can see some red highlights a little on the grays still and it looks awesome.  I was so afraid it would be a horrible experience but even putting it on wasn&#x27;t bad.  I put saran wrap around my head while I waited for the color to set in.  I have tight curls that fall a little below my shoulder and my hair is a little past my bra strap when straight.  My hair looks amazing and healthy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been one to dye my hair, and last summer I overdid it. I attempted a perm this spring and my hair was too damaged to take it. So now, my hair is in this terrible condition of frizz, dryness and breakage. I have been wanting to go darker but I couldn&#x27;t with chemical dyes anymore. My first try with henna failed (a bad brand). But then I searched for a better brand. I read great things about Henna Hut so why not? I bought some black henna so I received a packet of red henna as well as indigo. First off I will say the henna was SOOOO easy to apply. The texture was great and it was thick and worked really well. My roots were really hot red after that. However, the indigo was super messy. It reminded me of my last batch of henna: clumps that fell to the floor, on the counter, everywhere!! It was a mess and stained a few towels as well as my tub. Haha but anyways, the indigo actually stuck. I was so happy! It&#x27;s about 3 hours after washing it out as of now. My hair is super black! Hopefully, it won&#x27;t oxidate and fade. Keep from damaging your hair and go natural! :)</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe this product works! I tried a lot of natural chemical free products that was a waste of time but, this products in great. My brother didn&#x27;t believe it was my hair. He question me over and over until his wife touch my hair and then he believe. The price is a little high but, the stuff works. The secret to this product is to not use tap water to rinse your hair after having the henna dye in your hair for an hour. The tap water has a lot of chemicals in it and chlorine that can hurt the process. Don&#x27;t wash your hair in the 1st 48hrs with shampoo. Most shampoos have to much bad stuff in it that might strip your hair of the henna. Make sure you follow the directions they give you except for the tap water. Your hair looks so natural and real. It doesn&#x27;t look like my hair has been dyed. You can use this product on your eye brow and beard and it will look natural, it also makes your hair grow really nice. It&#x27;s a lot easier to use then most chemical free products. Your hair grows thick and strong. I think God for a natural product - chemical free that really works. Trust me, leave all the other stuff along, you will be very happy if you do everything the way I explained. If you see me writng a review, you better believe it works because I don&#x27;t like writng reviews. I don&#x27;t like scams either, so don&#x27;t think this is scam. This is for real.      ++.</li>
    <li> Would recommend this to anyone looking for a chemical replacement hair and beard dye.</li>
    <li> I bought this dye a few months ago and I just used it today.  It did a great job, I normally dye my hair with a chemical dye but I decided to give the henna dye a chance after doing some research on natural dyes, this dye was great, it is a two step process and each process lasts about an hour, just do some house work and the time will go by fast.  There is no chemical smell and my hair turned out perfect, it is jet black just like I wanted, I will definitely keep using this product.</li>
    <li> I bleached my hair about 4 months ago and I was ready to go back to the natural black color. However my hair was extremely damaged and breaking so I figured it would be a bad idea to use harsh chemical dye so I opted for the natural henna dye.  The dye does work.  I don&#x27;t know why but they sent me a pack for red hair labeled &#x27;step one&#x27; and a pack of indigo dye for black hair labeled &#x27;step two&#x27; so I ended up using the red dye then the black dye second. I&#x27;m not sure if both were necessary but I figured better safe then sorry. The only reservations I have about the product was it was really really hard to rinse all of the residue out because my hair is so thick and curly there were little black flakes everywhere even after I rinsed it like 10 times, but eventually with combing and blowdrying they all came out.  Also this product instructs you not to put any product in your hair before or after you dye it so the dye will stick. This is impossible for me because my hair is so thick and curly I had to deep condition it immediately after I dyed it to detangle my hair.  Even with all of this I am happy with the over all outcome.  My hair went from blonde, to black with dark brown hi-lights.  Overall it&#x27;s a great alternative to dye without chemicals so I would recommend it and use it again. Just keep a deep conditioner and a moisturizer handy.</li>
    <li> this is the product I&#x27;ve been looking for so many times, that i&#x27;ll recommend to all who have a skin  allergy specially beard &amp; mustache.</li>
    <li> This product is the best henna ever. I tried other henna brands a few years ago; they took a long time to prepare, were messy, and washed out with the first shampoo. Henna Hut&#x27;s henna &amp; indigo are very simple to prepare (just add hot water to both), are of a consistency that is easy to apply, and last quite a bit longer than my previous henna attempts, even on a few greys! I am so glad to find an all natural hair coloring that WORKS, is easy to apply, and is healthy for my body, I (literally) just bought 10 more boxes! A few helpful hints:  1. Apply with an application brush to keep neat. Putting slightly less water in with the indigo mix reduces drip issues.  2. Instructions say to apply within five minutes of mixing. I recommend mixing small portions with water at a time as you apply, so you can take your time, which reduces spills/misapplications.   3. While this is not in Henna Hut&#x27;s instructions, some people might experience satisfying results by mixing the henna and indigo together all at once (instead of two separate applications as Henna Hut recommends) and then applying. I recommend following Henna Hut&#x27;s instructions to the letter for your first application, so you can be fully impressed with how well it can work... and then experiment with combining them next time to see if that works just as well for you.  4. Use conditioner after rinsing out the indigo to seal in the color.  5. Use a few drops of a fragrant natural essential oil in hair afterwards to blend the earthy henna scent into a more feminine one until you wash your hair again. (Be careful to use only a small amount; and always check with a doctor on any essential oil you use if you are pregnant. Some essential oils are NOT recommended during pregnancy, and should be avoided, such as peppermint oil.)</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t last long enough</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have used the herbal products. I really like the way my hair looks and feels. I will use them again in the future</li>
    <li> This by far is the best henna I&#x27;ve bought. I&#x27;ve tried a few other brands and within a few days the color would fade. This product lasted me a couple of weeks. I will purchase from them again.</li>
    <li> Does a great job and does not harm my hair but gives great luster and fullness to the hair.  Will be back to get more.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this if you wish to dye brown or blonde hair black. followed directions exactly, nothing happened at all. no color change whatsoever</li>
    <li> I have uses henna in the past when my hair was relaxed and it was horrible my hair was fried maybe it was all natural as the company stated it was. Well I decided to give this henna try I have natural hair not collar bone length a year later yea i know my hair grows out fast. But anyway in the beginning i was afraid of using this product because i really didn&#x27;t want to do something to my hair and mess it up but i didn&#x27;t research before and after i brought the product. After receiving this product i didn&#x27;t use it right away by the way I used the one for jet black hair i went on the actual website. I followed the instructions that came with the henna, i washed my hair the day before the application afterwards i let my hair air dry, there are two steps for the process i applied the first step which was for the natural red henna let it sit for an hour application process was not messy the rinsing part definitely was but after using the red henna. my hair was orange which i was not happy with but it wasn&#x27;t a big after rinsing out the red henna, i applied the indigo this is what will actually make your hair jet black the indigo was very grainy and had a very strong \\&quot;too earthy\\&quot; smell that gave me a headache i left that on for an hour as well rinsed out and my hair was completely jet black i LOVED it my hair feels stronger and well conditioned and the best part is that its permanent color my hair was not green or discolored i loved my results.Just avoid any hair products for the first 24 to 48 hours as this can make your hair turn purple. This product is great but i think its a bit on the pricey side for the amount of henna that you get.Remember to DEEP CONDITION you hair well prior to using this or your hair will feel like fried hay afterwards.</li>
    <li> I used to be a JFM users, and it went bad on me with the allergic reactions. I tried other things similar with the same results but I couldn&#x27;t stand not having facial hair or having grays every where on my face (I only use it on my beard and goatee)  and then I stubble across this stuff here, and said why not. I followed the instruction and it actually worked. It can be a bit messy, but you can get around that. I don&#x27;t like waiting an hr for for both applications that you have to use but hey it beats having an allergic reaction and it beats having gray. Just make sure you follow the instruction and you won&#x27;t have a problem. OOOH make sure you don&#x27;t wash your face with hard soaps, this stuff will last you about a week and then you will have to reapply, but still it works.</li>
    <li> Shalom!!! This is Isarick about the product Henna Black...Yes it works and u were correct u have to use it correctly and it does work and i am glad it is herbal because i am a health concerned person and Thanks for going HERBAL the way of THE CREATOR and Shalom!!!</li>
    <li> It is a process to try out products and find one that works. It is a frustration to go through the time to apply henna with poor or little result. Harvest Moon Jet Black hair dye is all the good and none of the bad. It covers the gray, even on coarse hair, and saved me from the red stripey bits. I am allergic to black hair dye, even the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; ones, so all I can use is henna. Thanks you so much for getting me back in black! The two step process is worth the excellent result.</li>
    <li> one of the only dye products that I&#x27;m not allergic to.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve black hair. Applied it as per instructions. Henna turned my GREY hair brown color but INDIGO didn&#x27;t do anything... It didn&#x27;t change to BLACK at all. waste of money :-(</li>
    <li> This is a great dye, the color came out great. but, to warn people of color use a deep conditioner because it does change the texture of your hair. but, my hair is a lot stronger now then it has been for a while.</li>
    <li> This product not only caused permanent damage to my hair, it also failed to cover my grey hair.  My original  hair was silky smooth , with 30% grey.  I faithfully followed the instructions printed on the label for both steps.  It was a very messy process but I persevered.  I ended up with extremely dry, frizzy hair.  The grey turned into light yellow ( the intended color was black).  So I now have 70% black (original hair) and 30% light yellow (due to this product), dry and frizzy hair.  I will never use this product again.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, excellent product.</li>
    <li> ITS THE BEST HAIR COLORING PRODUCT OUT THERE.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this produce for one year now and I would have to say that I&#x27;m very very happy with it.p</li>
    <li> I gave it  a 4 because I wish it lasted a little longer. The color turn red to way fast.</li>
