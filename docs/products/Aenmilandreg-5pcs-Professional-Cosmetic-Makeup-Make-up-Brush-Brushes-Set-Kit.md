<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This smoothed out my makeup so well! However, I couldn&#x27;t find a cleaning solution that worked well. Shipping &amp; ordering was quick &amp; simple</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like this at all. It had a weird smells and after a little while of using it it started to break apart.</li>
    <li> I really love the way this product applies my foundation. It&#x27;s simple and easy to use and allows for a more natural finish!</li>
    <li> Its ok but I would like if it was better quality, and I want to try the beauty blender this is nothing like the beauty blender because it doesn&#x27;t expand</li>
    <li> I LOVE this blender. I would never ever pay the $20-$30 for the real BeautyBlender. This is an amazing dupe for just a few dollars. It comes from China so shipping takes a while. But I love this sponge. It works just as it should, it&#x27;s a good size, and it&#x27;s really soft. Others have complained that it is too small or too big, that it&#x27;s really hard or doesn&#x27;t work. But seriously, I love it.</li>
    <li> Blends make-up well. My first sponge,so I can&#x27;t compare it to any other sponge but love it.</li>
    <li> Love the price! Works great with blending in my makeup. Easy to use and there&#x27;s different colors to pick from</li>
    <li> This is excellent with putting the foundation on your skin but it is impossible to clean entirely! I have tried hot scalding water with soap and it still seems to leave a light coloring on the sponge and I have soaked it in hot scalding water with soap and still the same which makes me concerned about germs. If that doesn&#x27;t bother you it is great for putting the foundation on even if you use it after that because my daughter said she didn&#x27;t care and I gave it to her. I warned her not to use it near her eyes so she wouldn&#x27;t have any problems but I just can&#x27;t take the thought of having old makeup on the sponge.</li>
    <li> The day after I started using this to apply my foundation I had 3 people ask me what I was doing because my skin looked amazing.  Basically I think it gave a MUCH more flawless look then using fingers or even my foundation brush (which tends to get streaky)  Plan on buying a few more!</li>
    <li> HELPS BLEND IN FOUNDATION AND OTHER MAKUP MESS FREE. I WOULD BUY MORE, I WASN&#x27;T SURE NEVER HAD ONE, I DON&#x27;T REGEAT THIS PURSUCE...</li>
    <li> I love these Bottle Gourd Sponge Flawless Smooth Pro Beauty Makeup Powder Puff&#x27;s, they do the trick when needing to blend in foundation and concealer.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice size for concealer under the eyes! You may want to buy a larger one if you intend on using it for foundation b/c this one doesn&#x27;t cover much surface area.&lt;br /&gt;It blends makeup pretty well when dry, but it has a very cheap, rubbery feel to it when I wet it and try to blend. It makes the foundation look really spotty and uneven.&lt;br /&gt;It is best to use this one dry!&lt;br /&gt;I expected this to do the same thing as my Beauty Blender except for a cheaper price, but I definitely recommend taking the splurge on the originial. It&#x27;s best to just go with high end when it comes to blending sponges.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this, it&#x27;s stupid. I much prefer foundation brushes.</li>
    <li> Sponge works great on concealer and foundation. I use it dry unlike some others here. Very easy to clean. Gives my skin a nice looking finish!</li>
    <li> I love using this beauty blender in applying primer and liquid foundation on my face. It makes my face look really radiant and it blends my make up well. I have a little complain about the quality though but I guess I just have to buy something more expensive next time. At eleast this one&#x27;s a good try out deal.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what the fuss is about. This gourd sponge is as good or as bad as the triangle-shaped sponges I bought from Target a while back. With the triangle sponges I rubbed the foundation in, while with this I blot the foundation. The blotting is a lot of work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I don&#x27;t hate it, but I don&#x27;t love it either. Its just an applicator I use to put foundation on, now that I bought it.</li>
    <li> My makeup look better.</li>
    <li> Make up sponge by Caetle, do not use this sponge DRY, it does not work well dry and it will most definitely leave you with a horrible impression. Soak it in water.Once moist it will yield great results! Great for contouring the face and getting under the eyes.Covers blemishes great! The tip end serves as a great point to aide in that section. I would most definitely recommend this to all of you who are just starting out and really want to achieve that flawless finish.</li>
    <li> I had higher hopes for this. When I got it it was hard. It held the make up product really well but applying it to your face was like pushing on a big rubber ball instead the sponge like material it was supposed to be. I used it for months hoping it would soften up over time. No. So I had to toss it.</li>
    <li> very hard sponge, you can&#x27;t even soak it with water, it&#x27;ll just run off of it, invest in a good beauty blender. you&#x27;ll be happy you did! however, i do use this as a cute decoration in a pretty jar with my makeup collection so it&#x27;s serving some type of purpose now at least!</li>
    <li> Took so long to arrive! And isn&#x27;t that great, anyway.</li>
    <li> Took a month to receive but so far so good.</li>
    <li> eh, i bought the orange one from ulta, a couple bucks more, but way worth it.</li>
    <li> It worked ok, I just say get the real deal it try Target and Sallys for an alternanive that&#x27;s almost as good as the real beauty blender sold in Sephora</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not usually one to complain, but the one I bought had a bad smell and when I washed it the soap turned pink...like the color was coming out of it...?</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t get this at all!</li>
    <li> A lot softer than the one I paid $5 for at my work. My sister even asked me to order her one.</li>
    <li> Loved this make-up blender! It was on sale for an excellent price!</li>
    <li> I bought this as I have seen girls starting to use this to blend in foundation. I would expect the sponge to be a bit softer since you are rubbing it against your skin, but it just seemed to irritate my skin when I used it to blend foundation in.</li>
    <li> good, it was baby blue.</li>
    <li> I really love this blender. I can&#x27;t bring myself to spend $20 on a sponge for the real beauty blender so I was really excited to receive this product in exchange for an honest review. It holds up through washings, and works great. It seems to be high quality, and it very soft!</li>
    <li> Works nicely but took forever to get. So by the time I got it I had already purchased another one</li>
    <li> This sponge is to small to apply makeup</li>
    <li> Tricks people into believing I have no pores, causing my skin to look photoshopped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s about the size of 2 inches, sort of thick and not very &amp;#34;spongey and soft&amp;#34; but once you soak it with water and squeeze out a decent amount of it, applying make up has become wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticeably large pores on my nose which I hate, but this does a really great job at smoothing out my skin and HIGHLY minimizing my pores!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For this price, I DEFINITELY recommend it!</li>
    <li> This makeup sponge is ridiculously hard and dense, and doesn&#x27;t expand at all when damp... if you&#x27;re looking for a Beauty Blender dupe, this is not the thing for you. Shipping also took forever.</li>
    <li> love this little thing. its soft and perfect for blotting my face when its oily or just applying my liquid foundation. love love ..</li>
    <li> it was okay. it worked for makeup but was hard and did not move easily which mad it unpleasant to use. but when used worked very well</li>
    <li> Soft and wasy to use to blend!</li>
    <li> Blends foundation in well, easy to clean.</li>
    <li> This is not what I expected. It was a lot smaller than what I thought I was getting. Even dampened it still is hard to work with.</li>
    <li> At first i liked it but now i think its just okay. it blends alright. I like the pointy end for blending more.</li>
    <li> Horrible.! This sponge is the worst i have ever used...try the real techniques just ordered one seen great reviews on youtube</li>
    <li> Loved it but is very small</li>
    <li> Do not buy this junk. The material is very rough on my skin &amp; it doesn&#x27;t do any good at blending. It was so bad I threw it away.</li>
    <li> This is NOT as good as the original Beauty Blender but it does the job. When you wet it, don&#x27;t completely submerge it in water or your foundation will look runny, whereas the original Beauty Blender works fine when completely submerged in water.</li>
    <li> it was okay. I went ahead and invested in a BB</li>
    <li> This is a great sponge for the price. Gets the job done with out paying all that money for a beauty blender. I have already repurchased this twice.</li>
    <li> Spend a little more the material doesn&#x27;t blend makeup</li>
    <li> I had order this product back in December and i had made a small error on my address but thank the lords that it came because i was worried that it wasn&#x27;t going to show up but anyways i had looked in my mail box and i was surprise that it came early because it wasn&#x27;t suppose to arrive until next week but i am totally fine with that! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very small but when i wet it it sorta kinda expanded i wasn&#x27;t so sure but when you squeeze the water out of the sponge the texture feels a lot thicker when its wet more then when it&#x27;s dry but overall i really like it, i was hoping it would be blue instead of pink but i just now read the summary that it doesn&#x27;t select the color that you click the picture on for it to be the one that you want they just randomly picked whatever color and ship it to you.</li>
    <li> I love this sponge. It&#x27;s so useable and cute, chunky? It&#x27;s doable. A bit hard but it&#x27;s lovely when using for foundation. :)</li>
    <li> Its okay, easy to clean.... I clean mine with laundry detergent under running water in a sink. And squeezing while you scrub works great because youre cleaning the inside of the sponge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it for applying concealer and foundation, and sometime tinted moisturizer..... Im sure the beauty blender is better but this works great as welll...</li>
    <li> Slow shipping but love the sponge</li>
    <li> Over all the product did what i bought it for for a cheap and easy price.</li>
    <li> They do the job but its worth investing in the original beauty blender for the flawless airbrushed look</li>
    <li> Love these things! This one is great because its big!</li>
    <li> Love it.  flawless application and easily handled.  Smoothly applies your foundation beautifully.  Easily washable, just throw them in the dishwasher when you do all you makeup brushes ect.</li>
    <li> I used this with my concealer and idk I felt like the sponge soaked in more makeup than it put on my face but is still a good product don&#x27;t get me wrong.. It had a nice settling look to it!</li>
    <li> For the price, it is AMAZING...blends well, and each sponge last anywhere from 3 - 6 months depending on how often it is used.  I would definitely buy it again!!</li>
    <li> Quite too porous for me. Didn&#x27;t want to use it again after the first time.</li>
    <li> I like the product, just wish it came a lot sooner then it did.</li>
    <li> I love it ,but it&#x27;s a little smaller than what I expected it to be.</li>
    <li> Hard as a rock. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend it</li>
    <li> Love it! Blends foundation and concealer in very well I&#x27;d recommend it if you like to use blenders like this</li>
    <li> Works pretty well. No complaints.</li>
    <li> Not my fav, extremely hard and doesn&#x27;t even work if not wet and by hard I mean not squishy and very firm.</li>
    <li> This thing was very stiff and hard does not put makeup on very well, had to throw away after first use the item would not get clean no matter how much I washed it.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY! i was supposed to get my sponge a week ago and i havent gotten anything yet. waste of money</li>
    <li> My daughter who is so into beauty products told me that I needed a blending sponge and showed me what she had. So I naïvely ordered what I thought she had on Amazon. Not the same quality. Sponges from Amazon much harder and do not expand are not as soft as hers.</li>
    <li> Too hard of material. Works okay but not great.</li>
    <li> This is a strange little device, but I love it. I use it to apply my powder bronzer. It applies so much more evenly than with a brush. Never going back!</li>
    <li> to hard wish it was softer. maybe it will soften up after it breakit in. althought i dont wear makeup everyday.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get what the big trend with these are but I&#x27;m not a fan. Worse then regular foam sponges suck up all my makeup and leave me not lookin cute.</li>
    <li> This is the smaller size i thought it was going to be a regular big size but ended up being a mini. It was still a good product i havent tried it yet.</li>
    <li> they look exactly like the picture. small cute cant wait ti use them. i wont use them regualry like alot of make up artist so that fine by me</li>
    <li> it is way smaller than I pictured..doesn&#x27;t even get bigger when it&#x27;s damp. I mean it is very cheap so you get what you pay for. the picture is the sponge compared to a nail polish.</li>
    <li> They were great for the price except they were a little hard to me.  I&#x27;d repurchase if i could get it for that price again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s was okay I mean it was smaller then what I imaged it to be. but all in all they all work the same way.</li>
    <li> Its Been over A Month And Im Still Waiting , i got because It Had Really Good Comments About It , but now I Regret It</li>
    <li> I love this sponge, can&#x27;t beat the price. Blends just as well as the more expensive sponges. I use it a lot to blend/blot my concealer.</li>
    <li> i really needed a blending sponge because my brushes would sometimes leave streaks which is not cute, but with this it blends my foundation perfectly and only for 1.05! I&#x27;ve seen blending sponges for 30 dollars so i recommend this better.</li>
    <li> Looks like quality sponge. Cannot wait to try it out. Feels nice and not cheap. A steal for the cost!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s does a nice job .. Leave your make up nice an blend I do want to buy this spong works the besttt</li>
    <li> This came soon, I love it. However I find it works best with a liquid foundation. I use it with true match.</li>
    <li> Shipping was a bet slow but its a cute little sponge to carry to go. Not so great in application.  When washing the sponge the pink color was in runny water.But I guess you get what u paid for. To I guess its an ok product.</li>
    <li> I used this sponge great experience</li>
    <li> Nice&lt;br /&gt;But i get different color</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s sooooo small. But it is good for hard to reach places and really leaves a flawless finish. Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> It applies makeup well, without caking it or absorbing too much of it into the sponge itself. I like my makeup very light and natural, so this thing really helps clear up any excess layering. While my makeup still comes off by the end of the day, it no longer looks like I&#x27;m melting and it shines less because the foundation levels is distributed better.&lt;br /&gt; A downside of course, is that it can remove too much foundation and make your makeup too light; but it all depends on how much pressure you put on, and whether you&#x27;re gently swiping, dotting, or both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for durability, my current one lasted me for way over a year, and has only a few tears in the middle. The only reason I&#x27;m looking to buy a new one is purely for hygienic purposes, haha. I think you you just be careful when you wash it, you&#x27;ll make it a good investment.</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 of these and they are awful. They are very small and do not expand in the least. It&#x27;s almost like they repel water and remain dry, even after wetting them thoroughly. Not worth even the small amount I paid for them. Do not recommend!</li>
    <li> When this came in the mail, I was very surprised at how small it was; it&#x27;s still very useful though, just big enough for your hand. This works wonders for my undereye concealer. It blends really nicely and smooth, no more clumps or other splotches of concealer. I can&#x27;t really tell if it has the same effect on my bb cream but it&#x27;s fun to use. I noticed it doesn&#x27;t absorb water well. This is probably a good thing; it won&#x27;t soak up all of your makeup product up. I&#x27;m glad I was able to buy this cheaper beauty blender and still be satisfied with the results.</li>
    <li> For less than a dollar you get practically the same product that is probably made by the same factory.&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great product. It really blends makeup smoothly and is easy to clean with soap and water.</li>
    <li> I thought I would be softer than what it was, Didn&#x27;t come in plastic or anything ( Which PERSONALLY I thought wasn&#x27;t very sanitary, But I washed it out). I also thought It was supposed to come with two sponges and It only came with 1. The Product Details Said &amp;#34;Package include: 2 x Sponge Blending Powder&amp;#34; But After I washed it, It softened up but still not what I expected. But works ok with applying makeup. So it wasn&#x27;t that bad for the price! Just not what I expected.</li>
    <li> Definitely worth the price. Especially compared to others on the market. Does a great job smoothing out foundation. Smells a bit odd when you first get it but washed right out.</li>
    <li> Cute &amp; Good for make up application! I personally like it and would buy it again and recommend to buy</li>
    <li> I do not have the original beauty blender but didn&#x27;t think I wanted to spend $20 on one sponge. I usually apply foundation with a round sponge from Ulta, but wanted to give the beauty blender a try since I don&#x27;t like using brushes for foundation. I did my research and the biggest issue with off brand &#x27;beauty blenders&#x27; was that either they absorbed all the product or when they were moistened they weren&#x27;t as firm. While I have not used the beauty blender I am extremely happy with my purchase. I think it absorbs a little product but nothing too noticeable. It is soft and keeps it&#x27;s firm shape when moistened. I do think this applies my foundation slightly better than the normal round sponges I normally use. For the price (even if it were $10!) it is completely worth it!</li>
    <li> This is THE miracle sponge! It blends everything in so smoothly, and is very soft. A great buy, especially for the price.&lt;br /&gt;However, this particular seller is ran out of China, and it took over a month and a half since ordering for it to arrive.&lt;br /&gt;Therefor, 5 stars for the product, -1 for the horrible shipping time.</li>
    <li> it worked so perfectly i have to order another one because once my dog got a hold of it it was a goner i was so mad</li>
    <li> LOVE IT! Everyone should own a makeup sponge like this. It blends my concealer perfectly and is great all around. MUST use this product damp in order for it to blend makeup correctly.</li>
    <li> Definetly worth buying this it&#x27;s inexpensive and it&#x27;s good quality for what you get! Definetly a good purchase! I d</li>
    <li> I think this product is good but not great ! I onky got if for a $1 so I guess I cant really complain.. but it took forever to get here &amp; its REALLY REALLY firm ! I just wet it a little w/ my setting spray &amp; it blends good... but I just wasnt expecting it to be so firm ! So I guess thats the only downfall..</li>
    <li> This sponge is a nice and cute tool for apply make up, it doesnt expand when wet like the orginal beauty blender, but over all excellent product.</li>
    <li> this item really blends make up well.  I like it, and it was cheap.  I only bought it because it was so cheap and i wanted to try it out.  So if it&#x27;s still a buck I recommend it even if its anywhere between a buck and 3 bucks, you should get it.</li>
    <li> i so love love this and it works amazing this is my go to item when i do my makeup !</li>
    <li> I finally received my beauty sponge and I love it! I got the pink color that I wanted and it&#x27;s soooo soft! I can&#x27;t wait to use it.</li>
    <li> After spending good amount of money on foundation brushes I wanted to try the beauty blender. It was so expensive and I was looking for a really cheap product.It arrived today. After trying it I am in love with this product. It really helps spreading foundation evenly on skin leaving a flawless coverage. I loved loved loved this product. I have ordered another one for me.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> just received this today and i should i say the quality is pretty good, although this is my first beauty sponge therefore i could not really compare it to other beauty blenders. i&#x27;m going to test it out and update this review once i&#x27;ve done so. this is a small blender. fits my palm with a lot of room to spare. i would recommend it for the affordable price alone. i hope it does work good.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very hard to use. Very stiff (even when wet) and it&#x27;s very tiny. I just assumed it would be bigger</li>
    <li> this was a super hard sponge. it was like one layer of sponge and the rest was hard rubber. awful.</li>
    <li> I have no idea what the rage is about with these...it&#x27;s useless in my opinion.  It&#x27;s not very soft, it doesn&#x27;t blend makeup well..i have no idea what to do with it other than give it to the dogs to play with...&lt;br /&gt;it took about a month to arrive...had i have known it was coming from another country, i wouldn&#x27;t have bought it due to the time factor....but i guess it doesn&#x27;t matter since i don&#x27;t like it...maybe i can clean/polish my shoes with it...hmmm</li>
    <li> Its ok for the price doesnt work amazingly</li>
    <li> Great price for an amazing product. This is a steal!!! :)</li>
    <li> The sponges took a long time to arrive, but once I tried them, I was pleasantly surprised.  They are firmer than my old makeup sponges.  They are larger than my old sponges, and that takes getting use to.</li>
    <li> I ordered mine in February and now its one more day to April. Every Item I purchased on Amazon only takes about 3-5 days to come in. I been checking my mailbox for a month hoping that its in there,  but its not. When I contacted the seller all that was said to me is &amp;#34;wait for the due date&amp;#34; -__- I guess I don&#x27;t have patience but of coarse I wont, I have to wait a month to get a little sponge? ugh. Im giving it two stars for the shipping process, it doesn&#x27;t even come with tracking info!</li>
    <li> This sponge soaked up my foundation and barely put anything on my face when I tried to apply it. Pretty disappointed but it was only a dollar.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy another one! I own many makeup sponges and YES I know how to use them and YES I know to get it damp!! It&#x27;s wayyyy too hard and dense!! Doesn&#x27;t blend out good and it&#x27;s just useless! I only gave it one star because it&#x27;s actually cute to set out on my vanity but that&#x27;s it&#x27;s only good use!!</li>
    <li> I used this make-up sponge for the first time today and it does a great job putting on your make-up.  I will probably be buying a few more of these,  it works so much better I think than the sponge wedge.  Thanks so much.</li>
    <li> you really get what you pay for. this sponge is crap and nothing compared to the original beauty blender. I wanted to know if it would work as well but honestly it doesn&#x27;t even stand a chance. The real beauty blender enlarges when wet and applies makeup so well. This on the other hand does not enlarge in the slightest and ATE all my makeup. I had to use three pumps of makeup instead of the usual one and this was to only cover HALF my face. What a waste of makeup. I eventually gave up and switched to my brush because this was such a waste of time.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. It took years to finally arrive. It&#x27;s way too hard and doesn&#x27;t do as good of a job as a beauty blender.</li>
    <li> This bottle gourd sponge was decent. However if u want a beauty blender knock off this isnt for you. It os very different, but it does blend makeup well on the edges of my face and under the eyes. Also it works great for cleansing your face too.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t even bother waiting your money on this just get the regular beauty blender this one sucks way to hard</li>
    <li> It was a great sponge a lot smaller then what I expected but works just as well it hard to clean though</li>
    <li> Pretty good, the only thing is that they came in the envelope without been rapped like in a case or a plastic bag.</li>
    <li> For the price I guess you get what you paid for , it is a little stiff only used it a couple of times</li>
    <li> I love it! i actually wanna buy some more!! it blends by foundation in so well to match my skin complexion</li>
    <li> Its smaller than I expected, but sometimes good things come in tiny packages... ladies! Good for doing dishes, cleaning the tub, washing the dog... Great household item to have. Also good product to wipe away tears. I cry almost hourly, and nothing absorbs tears like this thing. Make sure you rinse with water after using for cleaning because the left over bleach really stings the eyes.</li>
    <li> This sponge is definitely not a dupe for the beauty blender or similar sponges but for the price it&#x27;s an okay way to get makeup on your face. The blending is alright. This sponge is just a way to get the job done, in my opinion. You have to wet it/damp it or it stays hard but other than that this sponge is alright. I use it in a pinch but it doesn&#x27;t really replace anything that I own already. Great cheap intro sponge though. For the price I can&#x27;t complain too much, it&#x27;s a cool little sponge.</li>
    <li> Like the beauty blender. I usually dampen mine with water and great for applying foundation and blending concealer that&#x27;s hard to blend.</li>
    <li> Just a hard sponges. Either buy the real deal beauty blender or the less expensive Real Techniques version. This one has gone straight into the garbage.</li>
    <li> First time using a sponge/puff to apply my foundation and it&#x27;s not as mind blowing as I thought it to be...I soaked it in water first and it does make my foundation apply a little more smoothly and I have more control since it is so small&lt;br /&gt;Got a purple sponge and it&#x27;s nice</li>
    <li> I ordered it a month ago, but other than that it&#x27;s really cute. It&#x27;s rather small, not expected but it works. Mine is blue</li>
    <li> I had waited over a month for what I thought was going to be a full sized bottle sponge. Yet it is the size of my thumb. Ding Dong Feng I will no longer order from you also it should be listed that these products are coming from china. Net time I want a bottle sponge I am going to go to Target.</li>
    <li> Great for price point. I recommend using a Branded Beauty Blender for expensive products because all knock offs have a habit of absorbing a bit more product for application, so its great if you applied to much, it leaves what you need. Its great to use if applied with a brush for a more blended finish as well. I quite love it!</li>
    <li> I really like it, it&#x27;s soft &amp; all that. I just feel as if the sponge puts foundation on just as well as my hands do! But other than that it&#x27;s a really nice sponge!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s like a regular sponge very versatile  bought two and I only have one now because my dog demolished the other....</li>
    <li> Great prouduct works well does what it says it will do. love the pink color. Blends and corrects mistakes as well.</li>
    <li> It came WAY sooner than expected! Said it wouldn&#x27;t come for two weeks but came in a matter of days (: Glad it was pink as well since it said they chose the color. Haven&#x27;t used it yet, but hopefully it works the way its supposed to (I mean, how difficult can a sponge applicant be?)</li>
    <li> Got rid of it got the real beauty blender</li>
    <li> It is excellent! It blends my concealer beautifully! I do wish it was a little softer( the sponge itsself) but it it&#x27;s awesome!</li>
    <li> 9 times out of 10, you get what you pay for. Considering that the name brand blenders are pretty pricey for what they are, I was skeptical about how well this product would perform. I was proven wrong. This is a great product, and for the price, it can&#x27;t be beat. I have used the name brand blender, and this is right up there with it.&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking to try out a blender, this is the way to go! You can&#x27;t go wrong with this one. Highly recommend. Don&#x27;t waste your money on the more expensive ones- This one gets the job done just the same.&lt;br /&gt;Also- I got the pink one, and it is much more vibrant than the pictures show. They don&#x27;t do it justice.</li>
    <li> Wish I would have ordered more than 1.  It shipped from China so did take a little longer however it was clear in the description it would take the amount of time it did so no problems there. The quality is fantastic and I love the product for blending makeup.</li>
    <li> Good ! All natural little hard to clean but what do you expect? Make sure to wet it before use.</li>
    <li> I loved the sponge it worked very well with my liquid, powder &amp; cream makeup i remind it. There is only one small thing i didn&#x27;t like and that is if you rub the sponge after washing it out it begins to leave traces of the sponge on your makeup. So with that begin said I&#x27;ve learned to just squeeze the sponge instead of rubbing it.</li>
    <li> What can I say cab out a makeup sponge except that it works....lol. The tip gets in the corners of your eyes and face well and it does aide in the blending of foundation and blush. My makeup has looked flawless lately and I&#x27;m sure that it&#x27;s with the help of the &amp;#34;Bottle Gourd Sponge&amp;#34;. The product did arrive when promised and with no transaction problems. I will order more of these cosmetic sponges and I definitely recommend to all women......Bernadette Ostrawski.</li>
    <li> This is a cute little powder puff just great for a granddaughter that&#x27;s a little princess that likes to copy off of her mother, when she is  putting on her make up!  I would gladly suggest these too.</li>
    <li> I got this because I heard good things about BeautyBlender and other makeup sponges. I didn&#x27;t want to shell out $17 for the real BeautyBlender, and I figured how special can a sponge be, so I ordered this. Well, after ordering it, I realized it was going to take a MONTH to arrive--shipped from China--so I caved and ordered the real BeautyBlender in the meantime. Well, once I had the real thing, there was no going back to the cheap stuff. Once it FINALLY arrived (and by the way, I don&#x27;t recall being &amp;#34;warned&amp;#34; of the extremely long shipping when I ordered it), I could tell it was much more dense and cheap than the real thing. Even filled with water, it was harder. I thought I wouldn&#x27;t care because it&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m a makeup maven, but this just didn&#x27;t work as well as the real BeautyBlender. And who wants to buy something and wait a month for it to arrive? I&#x27;d rather spend the money and get a quality product. It says BeautyBlender should last 3 months, but I&#x27;m making mine last much longer by cleaning it weekly (with the BeautyBlender cleanser) and using care with it. Maybe I could have lived with this sponge if I hadn&#x27;t used the BeautyBlender, but I can&#x27;t go back. That and the fact that it seemed less spongy and more dense...which defeats the point!</li>
    <li> Very cute sponge and I received it in the color as its pictures. (Even though they said it might vary). It spreads my concealer evenly and looks flawless!</li>
    <li> I really love this bottle gourd sponge, it blends really well with my foundation and powder !!! Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> This product works flawlessly, my make up looks so good whenever I use it after wetting it. I highly recommend it!!!</li>
    <li> This sponge is ok. not as smooth as i thought it would be. it has a rough texture, but it does blend well. i still like it.</li>
    <li> Terrible sponge would never repurchase</li>
    <li> Not what I expected , but hey you get what you pay for, its not as soft as I thought it would be, a little too rough for my face, I have sensitive skin</li>
    <li> It was pretty hard til i got it wet but it works great and is easy to store I enjoy how it apply&#x27;s makeup</li>
    <li> Great Price and good quality product ive been using it for about a month or two now and its still in greatttt condition no tearing or anything. Love how it evens out the foundation on the skin so it doesn&#x27;t cake on. Shipping took awhile but heyy for what I paid for it not bad.</li>
    <li> Purchased from S***O. Item much smaller and does not expand when wet. Will not buy again, you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like this product or not, but after using it a few times I have come to love it. I think it would be great for anyone who uses makeup on a daily basis</li>
    <li> Smelled very badly of chemicals when I opened it. Had to throw it straight in the trash! Not very happy.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t go into this expecting Beauty Blender quality, but yikes! The sponge was really dense and absorbed about 90% of the liquid foundation when I tried doing my makeup with it (regardless if wet or dry). I tried using it in different ways and with different products as well, but it just didn&#x27;t work out for me.</li>
    <li> This beauty sponge is your everyday sling. There is nothing special about. The are three color options. You can get blue, yellow, or pink. I got pink, the color I despise, but why does it matter with a beauty blender? Overall it worked well and I recommend it.</li>
    <li> These things are great and you really can&#x27;t beat the price. I find they&#x27;re easy to use and clean. I would recommend to a friend and will be purchasing more in the future.</li>
    <li> perfect lasts a long time</li>
    <li> Great customer care and I can&#x27;t wait to enjoy your product. Thank you</li>
    <li> Worth buying, soft and its good for blending, love it would recommend it to others and friends. Need more color sponge</li>
    <li> I like this sponge. I haven&#x27;t used it yet but it was a great price and it didn&#x27;t feel cheap. I can&#x27;t wait to use it with my clients!</li>
    <li> This product was very hard even after i wet it. So it can really be a sponge. Does not blend out product well.</li>
    <li> you get what you pay for and then some. the product arrived today June 12th, 2014. it was not in a wrapper at all. it was just put into a bubble pouch and shipped like that. how unsanitary is that. ive bought from this seller before for a bottle sponge but it came in a seal plastic wrapper inside a bubble pouch. just horrible I cannot believe the quality of this product its tiny as ever. no more then 1.5 inch in size from end to end. the smell my goodness the smell is horrible. it smells like burnt latex. simple warning DO NOT BUY this at all</li>
    <li> It was alot smalller than expected, not the normal size sponges!! So I think I&#x27;m just going to us them around my eyes.</li>
    <li> I had to wait awhile for these to be shipped, but I got so many that now I don&#x27;t know what to do with them all. I ended up getting a light blue color, and that doesn&#x27;t really matter to me at all. They were so inexpensive and the quality is decent. I&#x27;m constantly struggling with myself NOT to throw them out and use them as disposables, because they were so inexpensive. The whole reason for me buying them is so that I would reuse them, but I have so many I&#x27;ll end up having these in a bag under my sink forever. I may give some away.</li>
    <li> Easy to blend all of my face even the sponge a little bit rough but it&#x27;s worth for money tho :)</li>
    <li> A little smaller than what I expected but it works well, very soft and its not awkward to hold in my hand</li>
    <li> First of all, it&#x27;s hard a rock and second even when I tried to run it under water it was still hard a rock, and third when I tried applying my foundation with it, it still absorbed the product even though I ran it under water and i could barely get my foundation onto my face. I&#x27;ve bought a dupe of the beauty blender and never had an issue with it, until I bought this dup. I do not recommend that anyone buys this. It&#x27;s a waste of month</li>
    <li> Not worth your $2 and six weeks it takes to ship. It is very stiff and doesn&#x27;t blend for me.</li>
    <li> Blends foundation in seamlessly. A little product goes a long way. Took a little long to get here but that&#x27;s ok it came a long way.</li>
    <li> This sponge is small but ok to work with. I think it&#x27;s ok and I am just not used to using a sponge. Even though I wet it down, squeeze excess water out, I find that I use alot of makeup. Maybe I should apply with fingers then go back with sponge?</li>
    <li> My gf just kept going on and on about how great this thing is. She said she found out about it on some youtube channel and decided to get it. So i guess for the price, you cant really go wrong.</li>
    <li> I decided to be cheap and purchase this sponge instead of the beauty blender. I did not know any difference when it arrived as I have never owned a true beauty blender. The sponge is hard, it soaks up almost all your makeup even when wetting. I bit the bullet and purchased 2 beauty blenders and they are amazing!! Totally worth the price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s alittle small but hey they are NOT meant to be big unless your face is huge !! It&#x27;s super Easy to clean and is portable also cute</li>
    <li> This is the first sponge that I&#x27;ve used.  It is easy to apply my make with it.  It makes for smooth coverage.</li>
    <li> Works the same, if not better than more expensive makeup applicators! It&#x27;s a steal and will be purchasing more. Came earlier than expected, but do order with time.</li>
    <li> This sponge doesn&#x27;t give you a thick application. It&#x27;s a nice way to lightly put on foundation. I&#x27;d recommend a brush over this personally. My recommendation has nothing to do with the seller it&#x27;s just the idea of a sponge.. It applies really sheer. I use MAC&#x27;s Pro Longwear Foundation. I mean you tell me but im fairly sure its not my foundation. Bottom line sponges apply foundation thinly.</li>
    <li> I cannot apply a drop of makeup with this sponge. It&#x27;s very hard and not flexible, like a regular blender sponge. I use the real techniques beauty blender, it&#x27;s cheap and it works great with any foundation.</li>
    <li> This product is way better at blending foundation and concealer than my foundation brush.  Is not perfect but worth the price.</li>
    <li> I actually loved this. It works very well when used damp and it&#x27;s very cute. I lived the quality and it made my makeup glide on with a smooth application, I need to repurchase because unfortunately my dog go to it.. I would recommend this!!</li>
    <li> It wastes liquid foundation and MAC isn&#x27;t cheap, I winded up getting a MAC brush to apply my foundation, glides on perfect</li>
    <li> I bought a few of these beauty sponges and they were fine to use for a while and then one day as I was using Neautrogeana foundation (Which I have used for months before and was fine) I started getting these rashes on my face that itched horribly. I couldn&#x27;t tell if it was my foundation or the sponge but the sponge was disintegrating. I threw away both foundation and sponges and went with the professional beauty blender at the planet beauty for $18 and my face has been normal since. The professional beauty blender was way more soft and expanded when wet. Blended a lot better.</li>
    <li> I wet the sponge prior to use as per the instructions but it did not perform well. Mostly just picked up my makeup instead of blending it. I thought this would be an easy cheap substitute for an actual beauty blender but it is not. I had better luck just using my fingers blending out my makeup.</li>
    <li> It has been holding up really well after months of usage! I received a green one.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know it works so well when my best friend gifted me one of these after her holiday in Hong Kong. I thought it just a kind of cute stuff that won&#x27;t have much actual usage. But I was wrong. It blends my foundation so well that now I also can do a nude makeup! I&#x27;m ordering more as backups.</li>
    <li> It arrived on time and it blends in your makeup perfectly. My sponge was soft when I received it and wasn&#x27;t hard at all.</li>
    <li> It is awesome and makes blending very easy. Makeup application goes on flawless and it is not hard at all very soft</li>
    <li> Gets the job done, but too small for maxim blending. It takes a while to get everything blended. For the price though it&#x27;s ok.</li>
    <li> sooo soft i want more ... love it i never new this product</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this sponge!! I have seen a lot of bad reviews saying stuff like &amp;#34;first time using&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;harder than expected&amp;#34; and I think those people might not be wetting it.... It is hard to get the water to soak in but after a few uses its easier. All I have to do is run water over it while kinda squeezing it and bam its damped. I love this I&#x27;ve never used the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; beauty blender but I just don&#x27;t feel like spending 20 plus dollars on a piece of sponge. Make sure to clean it everyday after use it starts to soak up more product. Love it got 4-6 months of use out of my last one and have another on the way. Only problem is shipping was terrible. Came after the last day estimated. So I would order it not expecting to get it by any certain day. Overall love it.</li>
    <li> Its defiantly not like the beauty blender but it&#x27;s good for it&#x27;s price.</li>
    <li> This sponge looks and acts exactly like the more expensive beauty sponges at half the price! Will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> Very nice, I would buy this product again. I love the way it blends the makeup- flawless! Happy I purchsed the product.</li>
    <li> I thought the blender  actually worked really well.  I did wet it a bit before I used it. I put different types/colors of makeup on my face for contouring, but this worked well for blending, instead of just smearing it all over.  However, since I usually just apply makeup with my fingers, I&#x27;m having a hard time getting used to keeping this tool clean.</li>
    <li> Finger tips still work better.  Only advantage I can see is the cone tip to blend in the inner eye area, if that is an issue for you.</li>
    <li> I love it! I would definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> This product is tiny!  It&#x27;s this size of an eraser. ..I do not recommend it. I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> This is a great blender but it took over a month to arrive. Just to keep in mind before ordering</li>
    <li> The size of  the sponge is a lot smaller than I though it was going to be. I still plan on using it though. K</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like it &amp; perhaps it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m not a professional but for what they cost I don&#x27;t feel bad about my purchase.</li>
    <li> its not a bad broduct it work ok very soft i got them on time but they are wayyyyyyyy smaller than the actual beauty blender and they where dirty and i didnt use them smh not cool but for the price tw texture is not bad but i would not get it again or tell anyone to get it unless its for a one day use and if you dont mind putting a already dirty sponge on your face with out even using it so yeah</li>
    <li> Its extremely little. Took for ever to arrive and it sucks</li>
    <li> Great product and much much less expensive than the brand name ones. I would highly recommend this to my friends.</li>
    <li> Blends my makeup really good just that it&#x27;s a bit hard .. Other than that it&#x27;s a good product .</li>
    <li> Just got my order. It took almost 30 days to get. But I&#x27;m not going to complain about that. I will however complain about the smell of the material used. It smells like the spongy stuff on  bike handle bars (grips). Even after handling them I can smell the scent on my hands. I can&#x27;t imagine using it on my face.</li>
    <li> Great sponge for make-up uses. I use it to put on mine everyday. Although i do not like the color of mine (red) the sponge itself is fine. Although, it is not soft or smushy like i had imagined. Which is kinda disappointing .</li>
    <li> I just received it by mail today and I should say I had to try it and I am happy and satisfied with it, it blends very well with my foundation I use and very easy to wash off the foundation from it.</li>
    <li> It was tiny when I recieved it . I expected it to be normal size , not really happy about it</li>
    <li> This sponge helps so much. It easy to use, plenty of tutorials online. It really does give a flawless finish.</li>
    <li> This is absolutely horrendous! It is stiff, and does not blend at all! I would compare this product to a rock!</li>
    <li> Easy to handle.  Make my applying makeup in no time.  Will buy more!!</li>
    <li> This sponge is a lot smaller than I thought so I can&#x27;t use it as much as I&#x27;d like but its good for blending and very good quality. So for the price its not bad.</li>
    <li> BOO. vey disappointed. I think the positive reviewiers didn&#x27;t get the same thing in the mail that I just got. This sponge could be ain a tsunami and still not get any bigger, it did not expand the way it supposed to... its a tiny hard piece of crap.. :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s. came in a tiny envelope.. not sanitary at all. gee, can&#x27;t wait to use this on my face! (not) grr...</li>
    <li> Good product ! Would order again !</li>
    <li> Does not blend as good as I hoped, but good for the price. Need a lot of cleaning.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a hit or a miss, but overall great. The trick is to use it with foundation that isn&#x27;t completely liquid or cream, or else the sponge will soak up your foundation, or not blend at all for the latter. I ordered 2 of these, and while the first one was a complete disaster, that was on my part for first trying with Mary Kay liquid foundation. However, upon trying with a more consistent foundation and concealer with the second sponge, my make up looked better than when I used with a brush.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the cons being not exactly as absorbent as the original beauty blender, and the pros being just as close for such a lower price, it&#x27;s a great deal.&lt;br /&gt;Besides, being roughly $2, what would you have to lose?</li>
    <li> Best sponge I have used. Why waste $20 on a sponge at Sephora when you can buy this cheap sponge that works exactly the same! Trust me, I have a sponge I have that I bought at Sephora that&#x27;s exactly the same as this sponge and they work exactly the same, their both AMAZING! :)</li>
    <li> There is a famous beauty blender out there that sells for $20. This Powder puff is almost as good as that beauty blender and way cheaper. It works well when wet. Remember to always wet your sponges before using it so it doesn&#x27;t absorb your make up product. I use it to blend my concealers and foundations and it works faster and better than fingers or foundations brushes. It gets the product well distributed on the skin.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for an alternative to the beauty blender, do not buy this. It doesn&#x27;t double in size when wet like most makeup sponges due to water absorption, so it absorbs all the makeup I apply to it. More of it was in the sponge than on my face. It also took like three weeks to a month to be delivered. So spend a couple more bucks and buy a quality sponge.</li>
    <li> I Used To Blend With My Fingers But Once I Tried This Sponge, It Gives Such A Smooth Even Look. Very Inexpensive, And Works With All foundations.</li>
    <li> Too hard even when wet</li>
    <li> Why spend a fortune on the beauty blender when this is just as good ? Its actually surprisingly good quality .</li>
    <li> Love Love Love so much cheaper than others that do the same exact thing Definetly recommend using to blend makeup</li>
    <li> When I got this I was so surprised it wasn&#x27;t in pink. I don&#x27;t remember even being able to select a color but because it was pink in most of the images I assumed it would be pink...oh well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did smell very weird though and I&#x27;d definitely wash it before using it on your face if I were you!</li>
    <li> It took quite a while to get it but I did recieve it. I was the same color as the one above. I really just like to use it to brush over my forehead and cheeks...not to apply any make up....but to just remove excess oils, etc. Glad to have it.</li>
    <li> I was hoping to get a different color but I got the pink one. Either way, it&#x27;s really cute! And I&#x27;m very satisfied with how it blends. I use it to blend my foundation and concealer.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the sponge yet, as I just got it today, but so far it looks great, came exactly how it said it would, other than the fact that it took literally forever to arrive and was way over how long it said it would take.</li>
    <li> This product does work pretty well. I do find that it sometimes wipes of your makeup if you apply too much pressure. I have never used it with powder yet, but I have tried it with foundation and blending blush. This is definitely good to use if you accidentally apply too much blush and need to blend it.</li>
    <li> I love the feeling of this sponge and the cover it gives me and control of how I place my foundation works so well. All together just a good foundation sponge that will last a while. :)</li>
    <li> I like it, I just got it so I can&#x27;t really say.  I did apply some of my makeup using the sponge and I didn&#x27;t find a problem.  Overall I just wanted a beauty blender. It applies my foundation evenly.  Whats not to like</li>
    <li> Its been 2 months since i ordered this and i still havent got mine i dont even know if its going to be good quality when it gets here, if it gets here</li>
    <li> Not comfortable to hold. I ended up slicing it in half and making two sponges out of it. That works.</li>
    <li> Smaller than expected, but perfect for applying makeup! Easy to clean, too. Shipping took a while long than expected, but when it&#x27;s coming from China what can you ask for!</li>
    <li> Because its really hard and doesnt blend well!!! I thght it was gna be good but f it! It was only like a dollar.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product February 5th and it&#x27;s still not here.. why is it taking a month and a half basically to be delivered. .I hope the product is well worth the wait..</li>
    <li> I thought it was nice. They are good material. I prefer a brush over a beauty blender though. Overall good.</li>
    <li> A little smaller than I would&#x27;ve thought, but I like it! It feels firm and like it will last a while. It&#x27;s a great bargain.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s super nice and cheap.</li>
    <li> It is ok but it wears out easily. Oh and hear is a tip of the week soak it with water and then ring it out so your makeup doesn&#x27;t get absorbed by the sponge</li>
    <li> I went to clean this thing and it fell apart, like it legit started to break apart. I&#x27;m currently missing a big chunk of the thing, but other than that its a decent product-- you get what you pay for, so what the hay !!!</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it claims to do. It blends to perfection.</li>
    <li> hard, doesnt even soften up or get bigger when you soak it in water. i would not repurchase</li>
    <li> Its a little small but its cute and it works!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this enough to know if I prefer this method of application.  It tends to depend upon the face foundation I&#x27;m using it with.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great sponge, although a LOT smaller than I thought! It&#x27;s less than half the size of a regular sponge you find in beauty stores.&lt;br /&gt;It does apply well, and since it&#x27;s small, it&#x27;s great for eye areas.</li>
    <li> Shipping takes forever but I mean it&#x27;s only a few dollars but good product</li>
    <li> So good. Tip: works even better if you damp it</li>
    <li> It was wayyyy smaller than I thought..but what do u expect with that price.</li>
    <li> This is terrible. My came today and it it&#x27;s very very small. I hate it. I got ripped off and I would like my money back or a normal sized sponge.</li>
    <li> I have to say, I&#x27;m impressed. This is the first Knock-off Beauty Blender I&#x27;ve bought simply because my first one ripped. It came two weeks ahead of schedule and worked perfectly the first time. Hopeful it will stay nice!</li>
    <li> A pieace of crap it smells and takes all the product. I asked for a replacement and never got one yet.</li>
    <li> Arrived late but workss really good for under eye area veryy small than what I expected it but hey u get what u paid for other than that verry good.</li>
    <li> Too hard. Sponge doesn&#x27;t get soft enough.</li>
    <li> At first its a littlr hard to use on ir skin but after awhile of using it its pretty good</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t happy at all with tbis product it was very small and it doesn&#x27;t blend my makeup well it&#x27;s to hard</li>
    <li> This is absolutely my favorite thing in the world! I am super pale so when my concealer and foundation isn&#x27;t blended in well it is very obvious, but with the help of this sponge I get a flawless finish!!!</li>
    <li> I have never used an actual beauty blender sponge so keep in mind that I can&#x27;t accurately compare this sponge to the designer brand. I did buy this sponge because I heard so much about the beauty blender sponge and wanted to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This did not work for me. I tried to multiple ways (with the sponge dry, with the sponge wet, etc). Nothing worked for me. The sponge was really stiff and didn&#x27;t work my make-up in at all. The sponge is also very hard and rubbery and smells. I eventually had to throw it out because it was making my entire bathroom stink.</li>
    <li> Hard to clean (well, I&#x27;m sure it is clean, but it doesn&#x27;t LOOK clean because my makeup apparently stains it--but then, I&#x27;ve never cleaned it with actual makeup remover, just soap and water...hmmm...). But that is the only con.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it because I have sensitive skin that is prone to both breakouts AND redness (lucky me) and am in my 30s, so I&#x27;m more conscious about how much I use my fingers and  how it tugs at my skin. This spongy thing works just as well as my fingers but reduces streaks and fingerprints--so I guess you could say it works BETTER than your fingers and with a lighter touch. You can use it wet or dry (they say wetting it first prevents it from absorbing too much makeup--but I use it dry usually. Anyway, I love that I can apply my wet makeup well without rubbing my own oils into my pores or accidentally tugging at or rubbing my skin.  A good buy!</li>
    <li> I love this sponge! even though it took forever to get to me it really helps me blend my makeup together :)</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t work at all. I wet it like I was supposed to and it still didn&#x27;t soak up the makeup so blending didn&#x27;t work at all. Wouldn&#x27;t reccomend this product at all.</li>
    <li> I find this to work great for me,why pay more when u can get the same results by paying less</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t spread as good as I thought, absorbs more than anything but that may also be the liquid foundation I use. But you get what you pay for..</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE! I&#x27;ve been wanting to try one of these forever and I was too cheap to buy one from ulta. Found this one on here and for under $2 plus free shipping I decided to order it. It came earlier than expected, which was awesome. Opened the package, was kinda disappointed that it was pink only for the fact that it said random color. I was hoping for something different than what I saw. Anyways. It is great! My foundation and concealer are way better blended and my face looks flawless. Hey girl hey! Going to order another one soon!</li>
    <li> This was super cheap but is really good quality. This is as good of a product than the expensive ones at Ulta. Came in decent time. Definitely a good buy.</li>
    <li> With this cheap price, that’s really amazing for the effects. It really does make my make up look flawless. People keep saying that it doesn&#x27;t work, but it will give you smooth finish if you use it right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You need to soak the sponge in to water, then squeeze it out, bottle makeup, then dip the sponge in foundation, pad it all over to your face. Then your skin will look perfect. Another good thing is that these sponges are suitable for wet or dry cosmetics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another good thing is that it won’t irritate my skin, and it’s very gentle. With this price, and the effect that came out, I will recommend to everyone, it really makes my foundation looks smooth and silky, it works as good as other expensive beauty blender and I love this.</li>
    <li> Have been using everyday.  Love the shape mucher easier to hold with better control.  Makes applying foundation and concealers flawless.</li>
    <li> It works decent enough, but it has a terrible rubber smell. I had to soak the sponge for a bout two days to LESSEN the smell... But it&#x27;s still there :(  .</li>
    <li> Its perfect n cheap. I love it. Just didnt like that it took for ever to recieve it. But other than that is amazing.</li>
    <li> love the look and works very well.  love it!  use it everyday</li>
    <li> Somebody else probably knows how to use this more than I do, I just didn&#x27;t see any difference when I used this in my foundation routine... I went back to my Sephora brushes because I searched YouTube on tutorials on how to use the sponge, and I did everything step by step and it still does nothing for me. I buy expensive makeup too..</li>
    <li> I absolutely fell in love with this product.  It blends your foundation so great and doesn&#x27;t absorb it.  Haven&#x27;t tried real beauty blender but I&#x27;m positive this is just as good.  The only problem is it looks more like the actual beauty blender&#x27;s egg shape and doesn&#x27;t have the curve, which doesn&#x27;t bother me.  The color wasn&#x27;t the best but that doesn&#x27;t matter!  Love it!!</li>
    <li> i did not like it, i gave it to my friend for christmas and she said it didnt soak up the water very well and took away the makeup instead of blend it.</li>
    <li> Thank you for the sponge, it works well in blending my foundation. The cost was excellent so I bought two, one to give as a gift.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy having this blend my makeup will&lt;br /&gt;Definitely repurchase!!!! :) it works really nicely and it didnt take too long to arrive to me.</li>
    <li> Cute, but they work great, helps to apply the makeup with minimum muss and fuss, works great on crevices.  Cleans great</li>
    <li> This sponge is awesome. From the picture though, I thought it would be bigger and when I received this product it was quite small. Should&#x27;ve read the description a bit further. All in all this product is great and will buy from this company again.</li>
    <li> really helps smooth out makeup</li>
    <li> Its very hard to remove foundation that&#x27;s inside of the sponge. one time I  ripped this trying to clean it so I bought another one cause the target at my county doesn&#x27;t have it. I recommend buying the one at target.</li>
    <li> This beauty blender blends my makeup amazingly it really works wonders the only problem is it is a lot smaller than expected but love it!</li>
    <li> Great Buy!!!Great Price!! Fast Shipping!! Excellent Product!! Will recommend to others I am a very happy customer.</li>
    <li> I was extremely angry because this product took FOREVER TO SHIP. It took approximately 1 and a half months to arrive. When i finally received my product, i opened the packaging and found a slight tear. I&#x27;m fine with it. It&#x27;s slightly harder than i expected from a sponge but after rinsing it with water, it was okay. Product worked okay dry, probably works better damp. I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase especially for the price but extremely disappointed by the shipping time.</li>
    <li> just don&#x27;t use very much and don&#x27;t know what all the hype is about. I could be missing something here, but I doubt it!</li>
    <li> So if you&#x27;re looking for a beauty blender similar sponge, this isn&#x27;t it. Also it takes FOR EVER to get to you. And smells pretty weird.</li>
    <li> I thought it was gonna b bigger but its not.. its tiny ... like the size of my thumb maybe less but I havnt used it for makeup yet so ya we will see</li>
    <li> I give it four stars because I haven&#x27;t used it yet. The packaging was a little weird but the sponge itself is so cute and soft. I got a baby blue one.&lt;br /&gt;So far so good :)</li>
    <li> This blender sponge is extremely inexpensive and actually delivers. It&#x27;s really simple to use; just get the sponge damp. Then dip it in your foundation and pad it all over your face. Then roll the sponge when you&#x27;re ready to blend it out. You will surely see the difference if you use it correctly. I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love it blends my makeup very nicely</li>
    <li> Had to wait a while but thank god it came before the date it was expected to come. wish I would of ordered more but it works wonders</li>
    <li> This takes off your makeup instead of blending it in. Horrible and I rather use my fingers to be honest</li>
    <li> This sponge is a joke-it does NOT expand when wet like others, it is actually quite hard and does NOT work to blend makeup.  It is RUBBER, probably latex.  Instead of absorbing water it beads up and repels it.  If you are looking for an inexpensive Knock off of the original, go with the Wistonia Product, which I have used.  It is quite nice.  I am going to try the Real Technologies product available here or at ULTA as it has gotten rave reviews and is cheaper (after shipping costs) than the Wistonia product.  But I really liked the Wistonia (but have never used the original either).</li>
    <li> It works awesome, i use it on days that i want the extra moisture that the sponge gives for foundation and i use it everyday for my concealer! It blends perfectly. I love it</li>
    <li> Seems legit, can&#x27;t wait to try it out. I&#x27;ll come back with full results on how it worked out for me</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t come in any sort of bag or packaging which was a disappointment to me because i like my products sealed away from bacteria. It&#x27;s quite tough, even when damp, unlike the beauty blender. It feels as though i&#x27;m beating my face. I had high hopes purchasing this, thinking it might be a dupe for the beauty blender. I was wrong. You should just splurge the $20 for the bb instead of wasting dollars on dupes that won&#x27;t compare. It does blend out my concealer and foundation, I&#x27;ll give it that, and for the price i guess it&#x27;s not so bad. Try it out, see if it works for you. However if you really want something to give you a flawless finish like the bb this won&#x27;t be for you.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good but not as good as the reall ones... Oh and this one doesn&#x27;t expand with water it stays the same size -.-</li>
    <li> They blend my make up beautifully but they aren&#x27;t very soft textured. Makes blotting around the eyes a little painful when eyes are tired,swollen and puffy.</li>
    <li> I was supried by how tiny this was.... i thought it was going to be a regular big size but ended up being a mini. I havent tried it yet.</li>
    <li> Absolutely loved this product. So worth it, especially if you are all about blending, contouring, etc. It&#x27;s AMAZING! Self explanatory.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a replacement for my beautyblender and it served the purpose, but it wasn&#x27;t nearly as good as the other sponge.  Considering the price I paid, though, I was happy with its performance.  It is much denser than other sponges I&#x27;ve used, but it applied my makeup smoothly.  It started to smell, even with regular cleanings, after about two months so I ended up throwing it out.  If you&#x27;re looking for a decent sponge for the short term, this would be a good fit.</li>
    <li> Make it damp first then its great. Be sure to rinse it off after you are through with it.  Bye</li>
    <li> It took forever to get to me but I&#x27;m happy I got it offline for this price rather than getting it from the store for 2-4 dollars. Perfect and cute! I got Red ^_^</li>
    <li> Still do not kow how to use</li>
    <li> Smells really bad. Is really hard. I wondered what it would be like to try one of the cheap sponges. It was not good. It took almost one month to arrive. No packaging at all, just an envelope. It made my fingers, hands, purse, everything it came into contact with smell really bad. When I attempted to wash it, just rinsing it at first made it bleed color for minutes. It was bad. I contacted the seller to complain. They asked me to send them pictures. I didn&#x27;t waste more time trying to debate the issue.</li>
    <li> Earlier, I used to apply the makeup powder with hand, but when I came across this product, I thought to give a try. Once I started using it, I felt very comfortable and able to gain a smooth makeover.This sponge can be used on cosmetics that are wet or dry. One end of it rounded and is used on large areas and one end is pointy to reach into corners. Just make sure you get the sponge wet before you soak it with makeup or it will just absorb the makeup! It is made out of non-latex polymer, it feel spongy and resilient, and the finish reminded me of suede.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is exactly same as the one that I am looking for and over-exceeded my expectations. This sponge works great for stippling on foundation.  This is the best face sponge I&#x27;ve ever used. I would definitely recommend this reasonable and affordable product. A must try for the best makeover!</li>
    <li> I personally do not like this so called beauty sponge. It was very hard even after I had damped it in water it was still hard, and it didn&#x27;t even blend well.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t think it was so small it&#x27;s so cute it must be the smaller version of the beauty blender I will try it tonight</li>
    <li> So I thought these would be the normal size .. But they&#x27;re so tiny they don&#x27;t even work properly. I&#x27;ve had the large ones and they work wonders. These don&#x27;t even grow when wet like the others.</li>
    <li> Just as awesome as the expensive ones out there. It is literally the same thing. Makeup goes on easily, and I save money on foundation. Awesome sponge for makeup. It took a long time to ship, because it comes from out of the country. Plan ahead. You will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Awesome products for applying foundation! Love love it will purchase again in the near future! a plas all the way</li>
    <li> This is smaller than you think, but it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Thought it was full sized.. its only an inch tall</li>
    <li> Very small strange material</li>
    <li> I laughed when this product arrived. The picture looks big but the sponge is ridiculously small. Cheap price but the product is worthless.</li>
    <li> Too stiff hard to work with</li>
    <li> Not what I expected. Doesn&#x27;t work for me. It&#x27;s cheap for a reason.</li>
    <li> Took a lifetime to receive.  I wound up just going to rite aid and buying other ones because I got tired of waiting for these</li>
    <li> Hard and not even usable. Honastly just using in to hold my mirror from falling back on my vanity right now. Not one bit comparable to the original BB™  Wouldn&#x27;t even spend 10 cents on it.</li>
    <li> First things first- this sponge absorbs too much product. My skin has various types of blemishes scattered across and very large pores in certain areas as well. This sponge does not stipple on the product evenly like I thought it would but more in unnatural blotches.</li>
    <li> Good!And Cheap!!&lt;br /&gt;It is really cheap and useful for makeup.Thought shipment was a little slow.But still Love it.&lt;br /&gt;Strongly recommended.</li>
    <li> not worth the 7 dollars I paid for ONE sponge !!!!!!</li>
    <li> Despite dampening it prior to use, it basically just sucks up all your foundation.</li>
    <li> Not even close to a beauty blender.  Its a weird stuff foam.</li>
    <li> ive ordered these before, they are amazing. I love them. I&#x27;ve bought 2 more after buying my first because I loved it. They are hard but I&#x27;ve never used any other brand so i wouldn&#x27;t know the difference. They still are squishable. They make my foundation blend natural and I don&#x27;t get it all over my hands trying to blend it.</li>
    <li> Its hard even when I spray it with my Mac fix +, it even has a bad smell to it. I guess I will have to breakdown and get a real beautyblender.</li>
    <li> Waste of time and money. Hard puff, did not blend foundation at all.</li>
    <li> Was expecting a pink one but didn&#x27;t realize it was a random color, I got blue better than yellow anyway works well!💁</li>
    <li> Works great, just like the beauty blender..soak the blender, dab your foundation on your face with your fingers, the squeeze the liquid out of the sponge and bounce it all over your face, this will automatically blend your make up for a flawless fresh look. ONLY thing i dislike is that the price went up from $3 each to $6 in less than one month!!!!</li>
    <li> This sponge blends foundation and concealer like no brush. The finish is air brushed almost. Use slightly damp and bounce over cream products.</li>
    <li> Love this beauty blender it&#x27;s perfect I use it for foundation and it leavse no streaks or spots or blotches clean up is a breeze and it let&#x27;s go of all the make up when u wash it out no mess while applying the make up it does it&#x27;s job perfectly</li>
    <li> First off I would like to let you know I have beauty blender...have tried few other brands. I bought this because sometimes I run a little late as my husband takes me to physical therapy so I end up doing my makeup in the truck. I bought this so I would have a spare in the truck.  I absolutely love it. I wet mine and usually throw It in a Ziploc as I head out t the door. I see no difference in it and beauty sponge. When I use it my face looks Airbushed. So many people compliment how great my makeup looks.  .  I got it alot faster than I thought and like I said really love it. I never noticed a funny smell. No different snell than original. Have ordered more!</li>
    <li> They never send it all they did is to tell me to keep waiting ! -.- i waited a month but they did charge it</li>
    <li> Okay, so if the product wasn&#x27;t so cheap and didn&#x27;t take me forever to actually get, I might put the effort it takes to return it but I figured what&#x27;s the point? It was smaller in size than the name brand product and the thing that really bothers  me is it just arrived in an envelope from the other side of the world unpack-aged! A beauty product for use on your face not packaged ill! I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s unsanitary. If I had paid more attention I &#x27;d realize this company does not specialize in carrying beauty products but I was only concerned with the cheap price-lesson learned.</li>
    <li> Theses are just as good as the high dollar ones perfect will be ordering more! And they got here sooner than stated!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a hard material. I would not waste money on it</li>
    <li> The little sponges at dollar stores work better for me. Too forever to get here and smells bad, But hey it was cheap!</li>
    <li> To be honest I have yet to use this sponge! But I always wanted to and heard great reviews about it!!! Delivery was great price was better!! Looking forward to making it part of my makeup routine!!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a replacement RT sponge until I could buy another one. It&#x27;s way to stiff, it&#x27;s more like foam than a sponge. When it arrived it had hair on it that I would compare to a rat&#x27;s, and no matter how many times I washed it it had an over powering burnt rubber smell. Definitely would not recommend.</li>
    <li> does not blend very well</li>
    <li> The unique shape of this sponge makes it a perfect applicator for liquid foundation. It gets into the corners of the eyes and around the nose really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For this price, I highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleans easily with warm water.</li>
    <li> On TIME! GREAT PRODUCT</li>
    <li> I really like my sponge It&#x27;s the perfect size to blend under my eyes. :)</li>
    <li> Cute litte sponge.  Not too hard or soft. Blends makeup well!!!  Good deal for the money!</li>
    <li> I love it came in a week verry fast</li>
    <li> Just no. Don&#x27;t bother.</li>
    <li> Nice fot blending corners</li>
    <li> I got this sponge in the mail bare inside of the envelope. (if that makes sense) It&#x27;s kind of a health concern for me because the purpose of this sponge (for me) is to use with foundation for my face. I don&#x27;t want to use a sponge that&#x27;s shoved into an envelope without being in some sort of plastic wrap or something.</li>
    <li> I actually prefer this one. The shape is easier to hold on to. I use it with MAC mineralize compact. Wet the sponge, squeeze it out, and it&#x27;s ready to go. I gently twist the sponge on the compact then bounce it on my face. Gives a super flawless finish. I plan on ordering several more. As an esthetician/makeup artist, I would love to have lots of these on hand. I haven&#x27;t tried it with loose powders, but it&#x27;s supposed to work well for that too. There are a handful of videos on YouTube on how to use this (the brand doesn&#x27;t matter, they all work the same). I just stress that you clean it daily. Dirty makeup applicators are a big cause of acne that won&#x27;t clear up. Wash your brushes ladies!! You&#x27;d be amazed at the difference it makes.</li>
    <li> These are much like the other cosmetic sponges found in drug stores...same texture and density, just a different shape.  They&#x27;re difficult to rinse clean because the sponge is dense.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see why everyone else is raving, I&#x27;ve seen many reviews for the original beauty blender and that product appears very flexible and malleable and like a sponge soaks up water, this dupe was definitely not soft like that. I&#x27;m an avid amazon consumer and have never written a review, because I was often impressed with the products I&#x27;ve bought from here, but I honestly can&#x27;t say this is comparable to it&#x27;s more expensive counterpart. It didn&#x27;t expand when wet, and it soaked up more of my liquid foundation than blend out. It was also impossible to clean, I just ended up with a lot of wasted product in the sponge itself.</li>
    <li> First time trying this sponge, feels nice when applying foundation, so smooth and easy to clean you must try !!</li>
    <li> My foundation looks so much smoother with the sponge</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this sponge. It makes my makeup look flawless.  I will order another one to keep on hand for when I wear this one out.</li>
    <li> Works just as well as any expensive version</li>
    <li> not as big as I expected but it works pretty good for a 1$ beauty blender satisfied with my order</li>
    <li> Does not expand like you&#x27;d like it to, but overall it does work. The foundation does observe a lot into the sponge.</li>
    <li> Great product for a even better price</li>
    <li> It works but very small !!!</li>
    <li> ilove it and i love it . its a great product for a great price , since they are 10 - 15 $ at the stores . and well its really kinda the same quality or even better , it works on any type of skin with any type of foundation makeup . i don&#x27;t use powder so i wont know if it also works for that but i do know this item works better than any type of makeup brush , it wont leave brush lines or brush hair , it gives you a good smooth look and not a layerly look? like when you try to cover the places the brush cant and it turns to give you kind of a makeup layer + layer and doesn&#x27;t look right , well this sponge leaves your face and neck flawless . i swear .</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t wait to receive this item , I always make a mess trying to apply my makeup . Hopefully this will help ! Only problem is it takes so long to come .</li>
    <li> Not nearly as big as I thought it would be but works great and is soft!!</li>
    <li> Great product. Very easy to use and all the different angles and surfaces really get that foundation blended!!</li>
    <li> Great little sponge! Such a great multitasker, and the material holds up well to use and washing. Can&#x27;t beat the price, either</li>
    <li> smaller than they look</li>
    <li> Love this sponge it is very smooth. It doesn&#x27;t hurt my face.</li>
    <li> I got this and I really like it. As a usual sponge, it does its job when I apply my liquid foundation. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Usually when you place these in water they get larger. This one did not. It was very hard and small. It took me more time to use this sponge than any of the others I have purchased in the past. I will not be repurchasing this again.</li>
    <li> i like it its not to tough and it blends well with my foundation and it doent leave any residue</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing!! It gives me more coverage than when I use a foundation brush I definitely recommend this product and the price is a plus</li>
    <li> That is what I call fast shipping from Asia. The packaging was neat and the sponges work. If you want to buy the expensive go ahead but don&#x27;&#x27;t be afraid to try this one because it work just as well. One thing though that is the same for this kind of sponges. When being washed, make sure that your nails don&#x27;t touch it because they will rip it apart. But flawless application for foundation, concealer and other. I use it everyday.</li>
    <li> I ordered this sponge and it took so long to receive I forgot that I had even ordered it.  I do love it now and wonder how I ever got along with out one of these.  I saw a sponge like this in Walgreens for $10 I paid a fraction of the price and it is the exact same thing.  I have always used makeup sponges but this blends so much better and does not suck up the makeup like regular sponges do.  I use a foundation brush to apply foundation and then use this to buff and blend it in....and it comes out perfect.  I am going to order more.</li>
    <li> I love these little sponges. they are soft and strong enough not to fall apart. great item for the price.</li>
    <li> Sponge works great I love it! The only thing is that after a week it started to tear in three different spots. I would have expected it to last a little longer than a week. I was even extra careful with it cuz I know that digging into it with your nails cause that problem.</li>
    <li> MADE IN CHINA! Smells of chemicals &amp; made of terrible material.</li>
    <li> This is my first experience with this type of sponge. I have just switched over from the disposabe wedge sponges. When you wet the sponge it gets significantly bigger. It is very soft and does not absorb a lot of product if used damp which is good. I personally would like something smaller to use for blending concealer under my eye. This proved to large to get into the corner and I ended up getting prodcut on the side of my nose. Perhaps I will get better with continued use. Overall this is a good quality sponge. It blends well and is very soft. Great for the price if you are looking for a beauty blender alternative. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> It feels a little stiff, but for the price isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
    <li> blends foundation well...a little small but works just the same as any expensive beauty blender...good for those hard to reach corners near the eye...great price</li>
    <li> I would recommend buying the gourd sponge to anyone who really enjoys make up! I bought this for myself to even out my make up, and it works perfectly! The shipping took a little bit longer than anticipated, but that didn&#x27;t really bother me since I&#x27;m a patient person. Anyways five stars! :)</li>
    <li> This sponge works great for stippling on foundation. Just make sure you get the sponge wet before you soak it with makeup or it will just absorb the makeup!</li>
    <li> Super hard!!! Worst blender ever!! Hate it!</li>
    <li> Awesome beauty blender</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd purchase, they really make make-up look flawless.</li>
    <li> It does not really work for me.</li>
    <li> this is a amazing tool to help me apply my makeup throught the day and will buy alot more in the future thank you for you wondurful service</li>
    <li> Works really well! Super happy with this!</li>
    <li> feels harsh around my under eye area</li>
    <li> Not recommended , cheap material, west of money.</li>
    <li> This helps foundation go on so much smoother</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s worthless.  Get the real techniques one.</li>
    <li> The texture and shape of this sponge make it ideal for a variety of uses.  Very slightly dampened, I use the point to tamp on concealer, the side of the top to blend eyeshadows, and the base is good for blending liquid foundation, although I prefer to apply foundation with a brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The four star rating comes from my opinion that I find the sponge a little difficult to clean and dry.  Otherwise, I am glad to have this tool.</li>
    <li> I wanted a pink one :( lol i expected them bigger too</li>
    <li> Not what&#x27;s on the picture.</li>
    <li> This thing sucks big time. Dont waste a dime on it. It feels like putting make up on with a brick.</li>
    <li> This beauty blender sponge is exactly what I was looking for. It&#x27;s extremely inexpensive and it does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to. I think some people are using it incorrectly and that is why they are having negative experiences. It&#x27;s really simple to use, but if you don&#x27;t get the sponge wet first it WILL soak up all of your makeup and wont blend anything. You have to get the sponge damp, to the point that it swells to almost twice it&#x27;s original size. That&#x27;s when its good to go. After that you dip the sponge in your foundation and pad it all over your face. Then when you&#x27;re ready to blend it out, you roll the sponge. If you don&#x27;t roll the sponge when you&#x27;re done I personally think it leaves an unfinished appearance. After you roll out the edges though, it&#x27;s perfection. You really can&#x27;t ask for anything more for such a great price. I would recommend this product highly.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see lines in my liquid foundation as I do with the wedges. It came before promised due date.</li>
    <li> It  was awsome for applications of makeup and sanitary..less breakouts! I need more now! I will be ordering more soon...it&#x27;s worth it.great value.</li>
    <li> whats not to love! perfect for blending and the point helps you get in places around your eye! i love it</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice size and it does what it&#x27;s suppose to do. It fits perfectly into my hands. . .</li>
    <li> How did I ever apply make-up without it?? Once I figured out how to use it I use it daily.</li>
    <li> I was in between and betwixt whether to shell out $20 bucks on the real deal.  I decided to roll the dice and take my chances on the Bottle Gourd. The product gets the job done but it seems that it really soaks up my foundation.  I don&#x27;t like that aspect.  Also, no matter how much shampooing, it remains stained from the products I use.  So that is why I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars instead of 4 stars.</li>
    <li> The original Beauty Blender is much softer and blends make up much better than this one. Pay for the original.</li>
    <li> Still using it and it&#x27;s almost been a year!</li>
    <li> feels more like rubber.</li>
    <li> Great price, fast shipping, about two weeks early. I&#x27;m going to use it for face painting at our frozen party , very easy to hold, and squeeze, so that I can put the paint on it without getting it all over my fingers and so it&#x27;s smaller to fit in the tiny round paint containers. Seems like a memory foam material, it returns to original shape immediately. I will find tons of uses for this item.</li>
    <li> Do you get all 3 of them? Or just a random color?</li>
    <li> Works good although I thought it would be a flat one and a lil bigger. But it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> I love these sponges, they are so versatile!  You can use the tips for under eye concealer, and liners etc.</li>
    <li> Great price but unbelievable difficult to use. Probably good shape but it&#x27;s to hard to blend. Save the money for higher price but nicer product.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t expand and is pretty dense, but it still does a good job of blending out foundation and making it very skin-like.</li>
    <li> It works really good I was surprised by how well it works</li>
    <li> Exactly as seen. Good but shipping was a while. However, the price is right and the product is perfect thank you!! Just make sure and order ahead of time if you want it for a specific occasion.</li>
    <li> It finally arrived!  Its small but it works</li>
    <li> I do really like this sponge, I just feel like sometimes its better if I just use my finger to pat in the bb cream instead of the sponge. I think my problem is that after I wet the sponge I try using it too fast and its too wet still and then it kinda takes the makeup off, so I think if you let it dry a little more then it will work better!</li>
    <li> blends makeup very well</li>
    <li> So hard! Difficult to clean and it feels like I&#x27;m pounding my face everyotime I use it. Not even similar to the beauty blender. It doesn&#x27;t get softer or expand when wet.</li>
    <li> I ordered 3 of this item. It works well as it should.&lt;br /&gt;I expected to receive 3 different colors since the title says random colors. However, I only got&lt;br /&gt;three pink colors. I wanted to be able to distinguish which one I used for primer, foundation, and etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of cleaning, this sponge traps water quite well so you will need to dry it for at least 2 days until&lt;br /&gt;it is completely dry. I wish that it drys by the next day.</li>
    <li> Horrible. Not as big as the picture makes it look. About an inch tall. Took over a month to receive.</li>
    <li> It helps me apply my foundation smoothly with an even natural finish. It&#x27;s a great beauty applicator to keep in your makeup bag when traveling too!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s very very firm and not easy to use. also it&#x27;s hard to clean. not recommended to anyone with sensitive skins.</li>
    <li> This worked fine. It didn&#x27;t really give me the airbrush affect I was hoping for, but maybe it is because I don&#x27;t use a full coverage foundation.</li>
    <li> ive tried everything to soften this sponge out like the real beauty blender but this thing is just hard it doesnt bend at all!!</li>
    <li> This product is very Soft and nice but can&#x27;t compare to the original. Would buy again. Good for the price and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> This make you makeup look so flawless.&lt;br /&gt;I thin you should get this.&lt;br /&gt;This is amazing for its price. 😍😘</li>
    <li> I love my beauty blender 😍😍😍</li>
    <li> Completely awesome for a flawless finish! !!  It blends your make up perfectly. I used it for a pageant I was in and everyone talked about how natural I looked. I recommend this to everyone!!!</li>
    <li> Still waiting on my item!!! It&#x27;s been a whole month!!  I am disappointed I give one start because they won&#x27;t allow me not to give any at all</li>
    <li> This is NOT remotely close to Sephora&#x27;s &amp;#34;beauty blender,&amp;#34; ($20). It feels like hard rubber. I even dipped it in WATER and it stood there. This is NOT a sponge at all. Beware.</li>
    <li> Good and smooth makeup sponge as describe..</li>
    <li> This product came when it was suppose to and the product quality is great! This product helps me blend in my foundation so my skin looks natural looking!</li>
    <li> So I FINALLY received this sponge only to be disappointed. Not only is the sponge WAY smaller than I anticipated, it won&#x27;t absorb any water and enlarge in size. Its not squishy and doesn&#x27;t blend my make up at all. I couldn&#x27;t be more disappointed...</li>
    <li> I think this tool is very useful, it also meet all my demands when applying foundation especially liquid foundation. Good</li>
    <li> It smells weird, I&#x27;ve not could use it yet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need to wash it before to use it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will see</li>
    <li> Ordered two of these for applying foundation. Took 19 days to arrive. A pink and a blue one came. Make sure to wet the sponges with water, then wring out before applying foundation.</li>
    <li> This is much denser and less flexible than its expensive counterpart. It does leave streaks if not careful, and it is also harder to wash out. I like it better than a brush for foundation, but I still find myself having to use my finger to blend more.</li>
    <li> This make up sponge is better quality than what you would find in Sephora. It&#x27;s shaped perfectly and has lasted me a very long time. I&#x27;ve actually purchased another one from this seller because I want a separate sponge for my mineral make up and my foundation. I would recommend buying a few for this reason. I got the pink one and it is exactly like it&#x27;s pictured.</li>
    <li> Expected a bigger size. Size is a bit too small and awkward to work with. Texture is nice though.</li>
    <li> Skip it. Not worth it.</li>
    <li> Worked really weel, but broke down sone than desired.</li>
    <li> Great just like the original and it came as expected since it its coming from China it took a while to come.</li>
    <li> I really love this product. I&#x27;m a makeup artist and noticed how easy is to apply foundation with this sponge. What I love the most is that you can apply product close to your eyes and won&#x27;t let the product to get into your eyes because of the shape of the sponge. Lali Lopez</li>
    <li> Giving it a 4 because it wasn&#x27;t as soft as I expected it to be but it works right and well the price was good reasonable for this quality item, It did took a little longer for shipping but I got it which is what matters.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my makeup.</li>
    <li> Cheap, not even blend able.</li>
    <li> So, I got this product due to all of the hype associated with the \\&quot;brand name\\&quot; version of this Beauty Blender.  I am so happy I got this product.  It allows me to apply my makeup and control the coverage.  I can apply additional foundation where needed, but it blends almost flawlessly.  Why did I not give it 5 stars, I wish that it applied my foundation flawlessly.</li>
    <li> Long time to receive, but great deal</li>
    <li> work just as good as any other</li>
    <li> Makeup application looks more natural with the use of a moistened sponge. Tends to take the makeup off while rolling it across your face. If you are trying to cover up blemishes, you will have to reapply makeup on the area several times.</li>
    <li> Just like the beauty blender! It was just what I was looking for and exactly what I wanted! Very Happy!</li>
    <li> I am ordering more this is comparable to the $20 big name blenders! My daughter is in high school and uses it everyday! Ordering many more! If you like a great deal you will love this!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t do any thing it&#x27;s not spongy enough plus it doesn&#x27;t blend any thing any you have to wait like 1 month and a half with is ridiculous</li>
    <li> I found this product really useful for contouring and it actually works better if you make the sponge a bit damp before using it.</li>
    <li> VERY similar to the little sponges you can get from Wally World. But it does seem to get in those little places around my inner eyes better. Super cheap. Shipping was easy and took a couple of weeks... can&#x27;t say I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again as it is too easy to click the buy now button and have it shipped to me, and not have to try and remember to purchase one from somewhere else later. ;)</li>
    <li> THIS Is Nothing like the original!  I purchased  because the price, well you get what you pay for! Sponge was hard, does not expand, not even worth the few bucks I paid for it!! Do not buy! You will be disappointed!</li>
    <li> do not waste your money spending $20 at sephora and ulta. i normally do splurge when it comes to cosmetics to ensure it won&#x27;t mess with my face but i figured a sponge is a sponge regardless of who makes it. so i bought 4 of these wonderful little things! they work so good especially wet</li>
    <li> Took forever to get here but I kind of expected that coming from China. I just received it today and let me tell you the smell is terrible! I&#x27;m afraid to put it on my face,and the package was dirty! Never again ill just stick to the real beauty blender</li>
    <li> It took a little bit practice and a youtube video , showing how to use it by slightly wetting the sponge&lt;br /&gt;just spray a little water on it , from a cheap water bottle spray nozzle works best. You can also hold it under the faucet for a few seconds and then squeeze it out.&lt;br /&gt;I like how it give me the option to apply the foundation in a flawless way, and it does not leave the make up caked on. I do have some acne blemishes that need more coverage, for those I just dab the foundation on, let it dry a bit and then blend once again with the sponge. I like how I can keep it i my purse without much fuss, hold it under any faucet and re apply some foundation for touch ups.&lt;br /&gt;I currentlyl use the Bobbi Brown luninous foundation which gives your skin a nice light glow. I am light skinned and use the 4.25 shade, together with the sponge it provides a nice dewey fresh coverage for my mid 40 skin that became a bit dry .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more coverage, I recommend a stipple brush ! Elf makes one for just $ 3, works just as great as the high doller onces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps. I also did not find the sponge cheaper in the store, so this was a GREAT deal</li>
    <li> I got a white sponge, washed it before I used it, when I applied my makeup with it it didn&#x27;t feel heavy, or made face chalky or cakey. It left a nice glow to my skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this sponge....Was a very low price &amp; washes beautifully after applying my liquid foundation. It came earlier than promised.</li>
    <li> I love this for liquid foundation. Especially to use under my eyes to cover black circles. So glad I got 2 of these I love them.</li>
    <li> The product came much faster than expected in a small envelope with bubble wrap and packaged inside a sealed bag (purchased from seller KeyBargains). It does not gain very much in volume when moist, but it becomes reasonably soft and blends in face products nicely. I use it for my under-eye concealer and it offers me enough pigmentation to cover the dark circles, without leaving too much product on (typically, it would crease on me when I smiled, gathering in my fine lines - not after blending it in with this sponge). I like it very much and the price is great. It also washes easily. I would repurchase this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: This has become my favorite applicator for concealer and liquid foundation - it gives the most natural finish with good coverage (I always use it moistened). Depending on how gentle/harsh you are when washing it, it can get a bit damaged, but that doesn&#x27;t make it unusable and, for the price, no complaints about that. This has quickly become a makeup essential for me!</li>
    <li> Using this sponge has made a huge difference in how my makeup looks and how long it lasts! This sponge is easy to use and I love the size. A must for your beauty bag!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why I bought this. I realized I can create the same effect of the real beauty blender brush using a disposable cotton wedge. But this sponge, did nothing. It did not change in side and it was very hard and stiff. But that&#x27;s probably why it&#x27;s so cheap</li>
    <li> i did not learn how top use it but when i did learn how to use it was great to  use and i love it so far</li>
    <li> Does an OK job, but nothing compares to the original Beauty Blender. Try one and you&#x27;ll see what I mean</li>
    <li> I love this sponge, makeup goes on so smooth. At Sephora these sponges are so over priced, I am so glad that I found this on Amazon!</li>
    <li> This little sponge works wonders! I was thoroughly impressed!! It helped my foundation look flawless and my face beat! Definitely worth the money!</li>
    <li> SO AWESOME LIKE SERIOUSLY MY FAVORITE MAKEUP SPONGE THAT IVE EVER USED LIKE HOLY BALLS THEY ARE SO AWESOME! YAAAY</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t the most dense sponge I have used. If used damp, and I mean soaking it then sqeezing out the excess, it works. Love the shape. Not the best beauty blender dupe, but it gets the job done. I prefer the sponge from Soho Beauty. That one is much squishier and expands when wet, just like the real beauty blender.</li>
    <li> These little puffs are a godsend. It applies your make up evenly and smoothly. I love this applicator. It&#x27;s like a little swiss army make up applicator. Can&#x27;t go wrong for the price too.</li>
    <li> just like the ones in the store but way way way way cheaper. you cant get a better deal then this !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> like it , works perfectly fine to me , just took forever to get , it takes up alot of product .</li>
    <li> I really wanted to score yoU stars because i never revived tje product!!!! To everyone Shoping DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY on this.</li>
    <li> This little device makes my makeup go on so smooth and i love it! mine came in blue!! Couldn&#x27;t be happier</li>
    <li> I just got my sponges in the mail today, and first off I was really surprised to see that I was sent 2 sponges!&lt;br /&gt;the other day I caved and bought an authentic beauty blender, and these really do suck in comparison. they&#x27;re hard and it feels like you&#x27;re beating your face. they also soak up a lot of foundation. but hey, for $2, its doable. I&#x27;ll use them for emergency backup sponges.</li>
    <li> I got this just last night and I received two of them instead of one! It absorbs the water really well and also, it actually makes my make up look flawless. ordering two more for my friends!</li>
    <li> Not the color I wanted. I simply asked for pink like that picture, not blue. I even sent a message.</li>
    <li> I thought this was going to be a little spongy-er and softer-- i find it a little firm and it seems to absorb more so- i was expecting maybe the consistency of a softer sponge- like a clowns nose!?  LOL ok that was funny-- i was just meaning the consistancy/feeling- anyways it was ok-- i have only used it 2x. :/</li>
    <li> If you like streak free makeup and a smooth blend, then this is your product. It costs way less than the other blender, and does the same job.</li>
    <li> I really like this product it helps my make up go on more smoothly I cant stop using it my make up look so natural and flawless Im glad I tried it.</li>
    <li> Love it. Blends perfect. Wet or dry. And much cheaper then the original. Best dupe for the money. Exceeded my expectations.</li>
    <li> I usually use a finger to apply foundation or concealer. I bought this sponge in a local store because it was on sale and I decided to try it. I suspected it might be just a gimmick and likely not to work any better than a finger. But I was surprised by how well this thing worked. When I apply make up with my finger it often leaves a somewhat uneven finish especially if what I am trying to conceal has an uneven surface, like a pimple. I can see this unevenness in my make-up magnifying mirror, and I used to tell myself that no one else can see it without a magnifying glass (not sure if it is true or not). However using a sponge blender the foundation is totally smooth even if my skin has an uneven surface. Even in my magnifying mirror I cannot see anything but a smooth finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am attaching a couple of photos of the sponge before and after use as the sponge surprised my by growing. The photo collage can be located by following &#x27;customer photos&#x27; link. The first photo is the sponge in its container when I just purchased it, the second photo is the same sponge on top of the container (as it no longer fits into the previous shape). The sponge has not gone back to its original size even when it dried between uses. The third photo is the sponge in my hand for relative size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sponge can be used on cosmetics that are wet or dry. One end of it rounded and is used on large areas and one end is pointy to reach into corners (around the hose or eyes). It is made out of non-latex polymer, it feel spongy and resilient, and the finish reminded me of suede.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To use it you need to wet the sponge in warm water until totally saturated. Then squeeze excess water until it is just slightly damp. The sponge expanded as it became wet. The instructions said to put makeup on the sponge and then apply. I also tried putting on the face first and then using the sponge. Both approaches work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sponge picks up the color of your make up. The color does not come off even after I washed it. So if you want to use the sponge for both foundation and blush, I would recommend buying more than one sponge and dedicating each to a specific color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sponge over-exceeded my expectations, I recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ali Julia reviewor does not come off even after I washed it.

    <li> I use it every day and I love it. It helps me distribute the foundation better and more evenly. :)</li>
    <li> If you go to a makeup store and buy these. Your going to spend at least 15$. I have had mine for over a year and I use mine everyday. This makes my makeup look so good. I use it for my concealer. This is a steal. It may be small but it&#x27;s great for the price. Unless you want to spend 15$ instead of 3$</li>
    <li> Small but durable and does it job</li>
    <li> This was literally the worst make up sponge I&#x27;ve ever used. It was incredibly stiff and unyielding. I tried it with several different types of foundation and it was awful. After a couple weeks I ended up just chucking it. I don&#x27;t know if there is a &#x27;right&#x27; way to use it but given how stiff it is, I doubt my mind would be changed by a new technique.</li>
    <li> Not as good as the original makeup blender and does not inflate, but it does help set the makeup. Was not a bad dupe.</li>
    <li> Nothing special. Works. thats about it.</li>
    <li> Its really Awesome ! I like it. Go try it out your self. Buy if now its cool yay lol ok</li>
    <li> This product arrived timely and I use it everyday to blend my make-up. No matter how many times I use it, it never wears down, and gives me the results that I need.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tested it out but it&#x27;s much harder to squeeze then the $20 foundation sponges at sephora but I don&#x27;t really care this is temporary use. Anyways, it shipped extremely fast.</li>
    <li> I was impressed with this it makes my foundation look flawless ! I got the pink it one it was a nice color (:</li>
    <li> Took about a month to get to me which I was expecting and I didn&#x27;t realize that I would be getting two sponges which was a nice surprise for me. I love this so much especially to apply my under eye concealer with the pointed tip. Tried to use it for my foundation but did not like it for that. I usually use it dry. Tried it wet only one time but it didn&#x27;t seem to make much of a difference. Definitely a great beauty product to stock up on. The price is great too and really don&#x27;t see how the very expensive Beauty Blender could be better than this.</li>
    <li> I have owned a few of the pricier name brand blender sponges and this one is pretty comparable. Dense foam that expands nicely when damp. I will definitely order more of these sponges since they are a way better value.</li>
    <li> It was dirty and used it wasn&#x27;t even wraped in plastic or anything it was disgusting never again am buying from them.</li>
    <li> Very good price and good quality. I honestly cannot tell the differences from other sponges that can cost you $10 or more! Will order more to stock up! Highly recommended! The shipping will take about a month cuz it is shipped from China. However, it totally worth the wait! * Plz do wash it before use.</li>
    <li> It was much smaller than I expected, it&#x27;s only slightly bigger than the photo on the screen! But, it&#x27;s still pretty good considering I only payed a dollar. It is not super soft, but not unbearably hard either and.  I&#x27;m sure it softens up over time. It arrived in two weeks. I only give it 4 starts because I was expecting it to be a bit bigger.</li>
    <li> So i bought this one and the other round one, i lime both but this one was my favorite love it and for the price it works great, both work the same this one is a little bit bigger.</li>
    <li> Love this better than my beauty blender!</li>
    <li> Not a soft material at all, an I added water</li>
    <li> Seriously the same as the $7 ones I got in store. Wet it first before you use it! Or else it doesn&#x27;t blend it absorbs the make up.</li>
    <li> This product worked just as good as the more expensive ones I have purchased in that past. I got two of them in my package and one had a smoother texture than the other.</li>
    <li> i love this sponge, but it sucks in most of the foundation, although it gives you the most natural look ever</li>
    <li> I ordered this March 14th and it came in March 31st so I guess I got lucky mine didn&#x27;t take too long to arrive. It&#x27;s a good for its price but it&#x27;s not smooth or soft it&#x27;s more like thick memory foam and it came a little sorta ripped but I mean like I said it&#x27;s good for its price</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used makeup sponges before and they hold water in it and become larger in size but this one really did the opposite. It didn&#x27;t soak up the water I had it sitting in and when I went to use it, it was very hard to the touch and putting foundation on like that does not work too well.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRIZE ! GOOD CONDITION! &amp; WORKS AMAZING ! ill be buying many more im am not at all disappointed.</li>
    <li> I Love this sponge! Cheap and great alternate to the beautyblender! The product shipped quick and it fit right into my mailbox because it is small.</li>
    <li> This little strange looking sponge has saved me so much money on foundation! With this little gourd all you need is a small amount to do your whole face. You must wet it first and squeeze out excess water.  I place small dots of foundation on my trouble areas and work from their patting the rest of my face with the remainder left on sponge.</li>
    <li> This sponge is just like the beauty blender. It is light, and very good quality. I use a full coverage foundation and it gives me a flawless result. I am so happy with this sponge. I stopped using brushes for my foundation, I will definitely continue to purchase these.</li>
    <li> Not a beauty blender dupe, and it smells weird, like rube&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy it if your expect beauty blender effect.</li>
    <li> I DIDNT GET MY ITEM. I WAITED FOR A REALLY LONG TIME. I EVEN COMPLAINED ABOUT NOT GETTING IT. STILL DIDNT GET ONE</li>
    <li> This thing is amazing I&#x27;ve never tried the actually beauty blender but I love this one so much and it&#x27;s only $1</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m no makeup guru and don&#x27;t wear a crazy amount of makeup but this thing did the job perfectly, I already have some more on order.</li>
    <li> Theses sponges are great! &amp; the price was great too! Remember ladies: use them damp to get the best results!</li>
    <li> I love this Blender!  I heard about the original one Beauty Blender but it&#x27;s a bit expensive and I didn&#x27;t want to take a chance on that one.  So I bought this one and it was really good it blends my makeup really good and no lines are patches.  I love it!!!!</li>
    <li> i will never ever buy this again, it took about 3 months to get here.. and when I got it it smelled like gross plastic...I was dissapointed</li>
    <li> It is not a good sponge its so hard and has a weird smell. It fells like a stress ball instead of a makeup sponge. Save your money don&#x27;t buy it!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cheap and it works really well. I just wet it a little squeeze the excess water off so it&#x27;s moist and use on any of my foundations and it&#x27;s as good as the more expensive makeup applicators. Also came fairly faster than I thought it would. Recommend!</li>
    <li> I love my sponge it came fast and allows me to put makeup on without the hastle of a round or square sponge, it has versatility.</li>
    <li> Works exactly how it should and nothing to complain about except it took more than a month to get here but worth the wait.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deducting a star for time.</li>
    <li> Love my sponge great for  blending my foundation. Can&#x27;t imagine how I got along without it.</li>
    <li> I love it and its such a good deal. .shipping is very fast. ..exactly what i was looking for,  i seen this in stores go for $7-9 dollars</li>
    <li> great at blending foundation! makes skin tone even! i saw this in sophra for like 15 bucks! found it on here for pretty cheap! defintly a must buy!!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really give a review, I believed this came from china somewhere. When I received the package I was excited seeing how I waited almost a month for this one little item to arrive. Long story short I all received was a dirty small open package with nothing in it. It was only less than a dollar so I didn&#x27;t waste my time filing a complaint. I wish I could give a review on the package but instead I&#x27;m saying in the simplest words. The packaging sucks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve wanted to try these for a very long time. The price was good for this one, so I bought it. It took a little over a month &amp; a half to get to me, &amp; it just isn&#x27;t what I need. The product is great, but maybe for someone else.</li>
    <li> it will take a little longer for this product to arrives&lt;br /&gt;but it works perfect, good product and cheap..love it!</li>
    <li> After about, forever waiting to get this item in the mail. I did notice when I opened and smelled it, the item wasn&#x27;t so bad. So to figure out what the deal was I went ahead and used it. Got it wet squeezed excess out and used it on my face, I now know why there were so many complaints on the smell. It&#x27;s when you use it on your face the smell just sits there, and after awhile it is pretty bad. And my face felt a bit itchy. I even washed the item with my own soap, so I am not sure how I feel about this. It still worked great for application but yeah the smell can be a bit unbearable. So proceed buying in caution if your face is sensitive to products.</li>
    <li> These work great! Just like the beauty blender at a price you just cant pass up!</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this but I&#x27;d stick with the original Beauty Blender. Even while it&#x27;s moist this thing just sucks up product and it takes so much to get on my face. The first time I washed it all my wasted product went down the drain and I had a &amp;#34;what the hell man&amp;#34; moment haha. Don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
    <li> This is the best shape for blending.</li>
    <li> It does what it supposed to do but a bit to small for me</li>
    <li> It does what it says it does, I like it</li>
    <li> My  wife enjoyed the sponge so she could put her makeup on or whatever she is using it for send you coupons So can shop again</li>
    <li> When I ordered this, I was excited to finally use a sponge for my foundation application.  The package came ruined and the sponge was dirtied with some black dust/dirt thing on it.  I would be wary of getting this.  I&#x27;ve since been using the beauty blender and it&#x27;s great quality compared to this hunkajunk.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this sponge!  I received the pink one.  I use it with both liquid and cream foundation.  I put the foundation on my face first with my finger tips or a stipple brush and then use this to blend it perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan on ordering another one to have on hand. I&#x27;d like to have a dry on to use just for powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had it now for a couple weeks and it has held up perfectly.  I haven&#x27;t had any tears.  I use it almost everyday.  I wash it with some shampoo and let it air dry.  The color of my foundation does stain it but that is normal as far as I can tell.  I do notice when I squeeze it the &amp;#34;pink&amp;#34; dye does release each time I squeeze it.  I&#x27;d prefer it not to be colored if I had a choice.  I&#x27;m still very gentle each time I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best deal ever.  I think I got mine under a $1.  Much better then the &amp;#34;named&amp;#34; brand version.</li>
    <li> I love this sponge, however after every day washings for a couple of months it has begun to tear a little bit. But cheap so I cant complain.</li>
    <li> I would&#x27;ve given a four but it took about a month which I expected and also it works alright.. I feel like it soaks up to much of the makeup and doesn&#x27;t spread it to evenly. It&#x27;s fine for blush and creams but not foundation. Very soft though. :)</li>
    <li> I recommend this product to every lady who uses liquid foundation! blends amazing! It is a must buy, better than the original beauty blenders!</li>
    <li> I love this sponge, because it blends my makeup very well. I would recommend this to others and I will probably purchase more in the future!</li>
    <li> This thing is tiny... it is not the size of regular face sponges like the Sonia Kashuk or beauty blender, way smaller. It&#x27;s smaller than the size of a kid&#x27;s nose (for reference).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s not very pliable either so I dont feel like I can really work foundation into my face... I tried using it the other day and ended up using a face brush instead. It wasn&#x27;t expensive so it is what it is... may work for eye concealer but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
    <li> loooove it, is small like my thumb but is made of ruber like so its great for make up, thank you :D</li>
    <li> Even though it&#x27;s a lot smaller than I thought it would be it (which is why I gave it 4 stars) works great. I have tried the more expensive ones and they work the same as this one. The price is also super great and I will definitely be buying it again.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t as big as I hoped it would be but it really does blend well</li>
    <li> I was pretty disappointed with this product  I looked forward to getting it but when  I got it it was more like a rock than a sponge it was very hard and dense and didn&#x27;t absorb like a sponge is supposed to it kind of works but I wouldn&#x27;t repurchase</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t expecting to receive such a small sponge but I guess you can say it was worth the price .. Only 2 bucks. It is a good blending sponge &amp; gets job done where you need it to.</li>
    <li> good product, shipped fast, got here as expected, does get into places brushes just can&#x27;t im glad i ordered it i would recommend to friends</li>
    <li> Smaller than I expected. But worth the price I paid for. Thanks! Does what it&#x27;s suppose to.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a lot smaller than I thought it would be. The original beauty blender is twice the size. It  gets the job done but I could have probably just used a regular cosmetic sponge.</li>
    <li> I ordered 5 of these. They are so much more durable than the more pricier equivalent. They look awhile to get here, but I believe the shipping time is noted. They work great for blending liquid foundation and concealer. Best sponge ever! It is soft and durable. I wish I had ordered more of them when I did.</li>
    <li> I did not receive the shape I ordered. The picture and title has a &amp;#34;gourd&amp;#34; sponge listed, but I received an almond shaped sponge. It took so long to get to me that I had forgotten that I ordered it. Also be wary of the term &amp;#34;sponge&amp;#34; because this little puff has super absorbent powers. It eats most of the foundation that I put on it. I would not recommend this sponge unless you need a tiny stress-ball for your fingers.</li>
    <li> Not horrible. Beauty blender is better though</li>
    <li> This is okay it just don&#x27;t blend as well as I hoped.</li>
    <li> It is pretty much what I paid for. I&#x27;m not purchasing another one though.</li>
    <li> Have seen this product on countless beauty tutorials so I had to try it, and was not disappointed! Amazing product that blends your makeup to give you a flawless face!</li>
    <li> Seriously love it. A little smaller than I thought,  but for the price. Great quality! Bought 2.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good. Really spongy. Very good product. It does absorb the makeup and goes good on your skin. Very soft.</li>
    <li> I like the sponge especially for under my eyes and my nose. It blends it all  good. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this beauty blender! I use it to blend out my under eye concealer!!! It arrived very quickly..i would recommend this product 100x</li>
    <li> This sponge is amazing and the best thing I have used to apply my face make up! You can use it for absolutely everything! Concealer, blush, powder and foundation</li>
    <li> received the sponge expecting to be the same size as other makeup sponges (or like the BeautyBlender which expands when wet).&lt;br /&gt;This sponge was ALOT smaller than usual and does not expand when I wet it. Not satisfied with this item.</li>
    <li> Great sponge! I used to be a makeup artist and have tried several different sponge applicators for foundation and this would be at the top of my list. If you wet it and ring it out first, it won&#x27;t absorb as much product and it will help a little bit to go a long way. For the price, you can&#x27;t beat it. I recommend it. :)</li>
    <li> i love this sponge i use it everyday it came on time and i cant get enough</li>
    <li> So I got this product in and I already have one of these blenders from ulta this one looks exactly the same as my ulta blender but they do feel different this one is a little harder material and doesn&#x27;t expand when you wet it I feel it is good for the price I would consider this a good alternative I would purchase it again</li>
    <li> Not as good as I thought and took over a month to get here !! Leaves strikes on my face I rather use my hand then this !! Waste of money but was a good try I guess</li>
    <li> Smaller than I thought. Works well though!</li>
    <li> Ah took too long to come and the sponge was just awful !</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s way smaller than I expected it to be. You get what you pay for</li>
    <li> Loved the sponge blend well when damped!!!!....</li>
    <li> amazing, had it for over a year now. still in perf condition.</li>
    <li> Great for around the eye foundation</li>
    <li> I think it took almost a month from when I ordered it for me to receive it. So long so that I actually forgot I had even ordered it. Its also way smaller than I thought (maybe the size is in the description but I honestly didn&#x27;t look). It works okay just as long as its clean. I ended up using it just for concealer. Next time I&#x27;ll just go to Marshalls, they have good doupes there for the beauty blender!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this sponge for a longggg time now. A couple of months. &amp; it&#x27;s still in good shape for the price you pay which is wayyyy better than spending $20-$30 on the original beauty sponges. But I love this sponge.!. Going to order another one.</li>
    <li> On time as stated in description.  Everything disclosed was spot on. Only mistake.. should have ordered more. Thanks</li>
    <li> It is very firm and does not soften or expand like the Beauty Blender.  I bought this as a dupe and was hoping to have found a cheaper alternative to the costly BB.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy this sponge.  It has an attractive price but does not compare to the BB at all.</li>
    <li> Amazing little product. Very good quality. I got a blue one lol</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading rave reviews of the Beauty Blender tool that runs about $15/each. Unwilling to spend that much, I opted for this tool, hoping it would be an inexpensive alternative. I used it, and it&#x27;s nothing special. I can&#x27;t really tell a difference between using this, and applying the foundation with clean fingers. I would have continued using it, but it is a pain to clean. Glad I didn&#x27;t pay too much to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe the real deal Beauty Blender is way better, but I can&#x27;t imagine the difference is worth $15. Just my opinion.</li>
    <li> Just go with the original Beauty Blender, this product doesn&#x27;t get bigger when you damp it and doesn&#x27;t blend well at all.  Not worth it, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t een use it I think it&#x27;s a waste of money just to buy one of these and it leaves a stain after you wash the make up out of it and it take a lot of washing to get the make up out.</li>
    <li> this is ok. I find my brushes do a lot better than this, but I will keep it and add to my collection of things I don&#x27;t use lol</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s works good but it also leaves a odor</li>
    <li> They are much smaller than the ones I buy at Ulta or Walgreens.  I personally didn&#x27;t like as much.  But good price</li>
    <li> I was swayed by the five star reviews and thought I would try this, since it is the same shape as the expensive makeup sponge. I can&#x27;t speak for the expensive one, but this one doesn&#x27;t cut it. Wet or dry, it doesn&#x27;t blend particularly well, especially around the eyes. I still have to use my fingers to get the makeup to be truly blended. The plain old circle sponges are far better.</li>
    <li> i loved this blending sponge!!!!!! It works perfect. I would so buy more. I really recommend buying the sponge. Loved it</li>
    <li> Well when I ordered this, I ordered 2 because I thought it was only the one pictured.. came with 2 sponges and 3 egg shaped ones in each order. So that was really good for the price.&lt;br /&gt;But.. The sponge itself I wasn&#x27;t too pleased with.. It was really rough and didn&#x27;t blend as well as I would&#x27;ve thought. I guess that&#x27;s what you get for a couple dollars but I really wasn&#x27;t too happy.. I don&#x27;t use mine for makeup.. I do use for sponging nail art so I&#x27;m still giving 3 stars</li>
    <li> The sponge is very firm. Ideally it would be a bit softer. This review supposes the product is a cream/lotion, it is not. It is very firm sponge.</li>
    <li> So this was my first time trying a &amp;#34;sponge beauty blender&amp;#34; type product and I really like it for blending concealer (under my eyes\cheeks) but as for applying foundation I just didn&#x27;t like it, I noticed that my foundation didn&#x27;t stay on as long and it wore off faster and I even tested that by using my foundation brush and then my beauty blender and sure enough the beauty blender was the problem but I still like this product because it is good for blending concealers.</li>
    <li> Save your money! This is a horrible product that is NOTHING like the beauty blender. It is made from extremely cheap materials and it smells awful. You can&#x27;t apply your makeup with it because it&#x27;s so plasticey that the product just slides right off. Yuck</li>
    <li> I only used this one time because I just can not get into the sponge thing. I love my brushes. The first time I tried this my foundation looked great...not so great the second time though. I wouldn&#x27;t blame the sponge, just the user. I have to practice more and find a use for sponges because at the moment I have worked so hard to become a pro at using brushes.</li>
    <li> This beauty blender dupe did just as was expected! I&#x27;m confused by those who gave this product a bad rating, unless you did not soak this first in water.  It gets twice as large when you soak it, and it works great with liquid foundation and gives an airbrushed look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom(flat part) is used for patting your foundation throughout your face and the small tip is used to get in areas mostly around your eyes or nose.  The only downside to using a sponge versus a brush is that the sponge will soak up a little of the foundation, but its totally worth it when the end result is a flawless airbrushed finished.  You honestly look as though your not wearing makeup(at least for myself).  :) I&#x27;m going to purchase a second one.</li>
    <li> Product is great, but the seller I purchased from took literally over a month to ship to me. It didnt seem worth it to complain (I only paid a couple of dollars), but then randomly it just turned up in the mail. Works great now that I have it, though!</li>
    <li> The RealTechniques blender sponge is where it&#x27;s at, this thing was a joke.</li>
    <li> Loved them!! Work great and they arrive sooner than I was told!!</li>
    <li> Every time I try to order me a nifty item to try, my youngest daughter justs takes over my new products before I get a chance to use them. Will probably have to order another one. Or better yet in my case, a few... Thanks.</li>
    <li> Love it ! Soft &amp; effective</li>
    <li> I ordered it wanting to test it out without spending 20$ on a sponge. So I got this one. I noticed there was a defect in the sponge leaving me only one side to use. Other than that its pretty ok.</li>
    <li> its super hard... i don&#x27;t like this...</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  it&#x27;s perfect for filling in lines and cleaning up under the eyes... for whatever reason, I am a master at under eye catastrophe&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> not worth the price really. another sponge like the ones In CVS except they&#x27;re wedges</li>
    <li> this most def gives that flawless airbrushed finish w/o spending the money on an airbrush machine, A little misting of a setting spray before facial application and VOILA there you have a gflawless face. Def would recommend for makeup lovers like myself</li>
    <li> love this little amazing thing take it every where dont use my makeup brushes when im in a rush love it</li>
    <li> even though it was cheap i really hate buying a product and never receiveing it . Waist of money</li>
    <li> Nice product use it all the time</li>
    <li> Great shipping, super fast.  Can&#x27;t wait to use these, got similar ones and loved them!</li>
    <li> I am not sure why so many people are saying these are so hard.  They feel plenty soft to me.  Keep in mind that I have never used the beauty blender, though.  They are very good for blending in my under eye concealer, as well as blending in concealer on blemishes/spots.  I am quite satisfied with these.  For $1 a piece, these are definitely worth a try.</li>
    <li> I actually really loved this it is really nice only problem is I like to exchange my sponges every few months or so and it could be a hassle to have to order them. also took quite some time to get here. other ten that the functionality is great.</li>
    <li> These suck and are nowhere  near being like the beautyblenders!</li>
    <li> brush depending on what sort of finish I want.  I like the triangle sponge better than this one simply because, for me, it gets into the eye area better.  I like the Stippling brush best because I can make my pours disappear with it.  Still, there&#x27;s nothing wrong with the Gourd, it&#x27;s good to have in ones arsenal of tools, really, wouldn&#x27;t be without it, and it&#x27;s much less expensive then a Beauty Blender which does the same thing.  This is a very nice product, it washes nicely and feels good in your hand and on your face.  At least IMHO.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> No bueno. Buy the beauty blender.</li>
    <li> very stiff, didn&#x27;t expand when soaked in water, you get what you pay for I guess</li>
    <li> One of the best things I ever got</li>
    <li> Makes my foundation blend out flawlessly when damp ! I have the original beauty blender and there is a bit of a difference in quality but there&#x27;s also a big difference in price so it&#x27;s kind of personal preference but i definitely like it !</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s soft nice. Only problem is it takes up a ton on product</li>
    <li> You can pay $20 for this at Sephora or you can buy it online. This baby makes applying wet foundation a breeze.</li>
    <li> This works great! I soaked it in water, squeezed it out, blotted some makeup on it and it made my face look airbrushed which is the point of all blenders! This is so SOFT too! It does not irritate my skin at all, very gentle! The down side (of all blenders) is it soaks up so much product! Other than that, I would say this is just as good as the more expensive Beauty Blender. I will be buying this again as soon as mine wears out!!!</li>
    <li> I was a little confused by how small the sponges were when I got them then I realized they are best when used wet. So after wetting it, I towel dried it a little bit and it was ready for use. I don&#x27;t normally use foundation but I do use bb cream. The sponge applied the bb cream effortlessly. I can&#x27;t wait to use it for concealer. I didn&#x27;t give it five stars because I felt the packaging could have been better. Great for anyone who wants to try an inexpensive blender.</li>
    <li> Love this! I use it everyday</li>
    <li> Its ok a little denser than some other ones I have purchased that are the same shape and size.</li>
    <li> It is easy to use and especially good when I use it wet. The foundation become more smooth and light when I spread it with&lt;br /&gt;the wet sponge.</li>
    <li> This did not work for me, the sponge is too rough</li>
    <li> I have a Bella beauty gourd and I love it. This gourd is horrible. It soaks up all your makeup and doesn&#x27;t spread it evenly and flawlessly like its supposed to.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use this often as I thought I would... Its surface eats up most of the BB that I put on.</li>
    <li> does not blend nicely</li>
    <li> Sent me the wrong item,&lt;br /&gt;offered to exchange it if I shipped it back,&lt;br /&gt;but it wasn&#x27;t worth the $3 I spent on it.&lt;br /&gt;Plus if it were to take as long as it did the first time ill have moved by then.</li>
    <li> they are not real beauty blenders, they are still and collect to much product even when dampened. waste of money</li>
    <li> This sponge rocks!! It makes my make-up look FLAWLESS!!! And is an amazing alternative the beauty blunder and is way cheaper!!! I totally recommend this to anyone who loves doing makeup!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. It kind of smells like chemicals.</li>
    <li> I wet it a little and use my liquid foundation... when I&#x27;m done my skin looks flawless so I&#x27;m a happy camper.  Great for doing under eye concealing as well.  Overall I&#x27;m happy with this product &#x3D;)  Product arrived on time and was packaged nicely</li>
    <li> the shape does not conform to a natural face line.&lt;br /&gt;the product texture is way too hard/firm, non-flexible.&lt;br /&gt;in fact, i am going to use is as a bottle gourd instead of a facial sponge!</li>
    <li> I have done make up for the last couple years, and after learning new techniques of foundation application I figured my next endeavor would be this &amp;#34;blender sponge&amp;#34; trend.&lt;br /&gt;It really is an art,  you have to know how to use this to evenly disperse your foundation, and it just takes practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it is also alot small in person than what it looks like in the photos.</li>
