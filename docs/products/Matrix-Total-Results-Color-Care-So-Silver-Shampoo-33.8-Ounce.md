<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> i noticed my bangs and underside of my hair were brassy from bed tanning. i was using joico and that i had to use EVERY DAY!! with ok results. after using this once it got rid of all yellow and brassy tones. amazing results and they last one or two shamoos (i wash every other day) use it again and back to almost white hair again. so happy w this product!</li>
    <li> I would have given it a 5 if it weren&#x27;t for the&lt;br /&gt;terrible sweet fragrance that I could not wash out after&lt;br /&gt;10 days. I simply couldn&#x27;t use it again. $27 dollars down the drain.</li>
    <li> Keeps white hair from looking yellow.</li>
    <li> I was recommended to use the So Silver by one of my daughters who is a hairdresser and whose opinion I value when it comes to hair. I have white hair but it had started to turn a bit &amp;#34;brassy&amp;#34; and yellowed. This shampoo did help brighten my hair. I have not been coloring my hair so I did not find the shampoo dried or fried it, as some have complained about. Perhaps it is not for colored or &amp;#34;treated&amp;#34; hair. I have been using it twice a week with conditioner and my regular agave shampoo with conditioner once a week. I&#x27;m getting good results and my hair is really soft.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best silver shampoos. Better than Shimmer Lights. Its thicker and a deeper purple than any of the silver shampoos too. My colorist used Matrix&#x27;s colors to dye my hair silver-ash blonde and I use this daily to keep my platinum hair bright and not brassy. Once a week I use it on my dry hair and keep it on for about 20 minutes for an extra boost in color.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo, mostly because it smells so good, because you can only use once every 3 or 4 shampoos or my silver hair turns purple...</li>
    <li> Yes it does take the yellowish tints from silver gray hair. But it also took the shine away and made my hair dry and took the natural curl out. Use it once in a while and give your hair a good conditioner after using shampoo.</li>
    <li> Looking for a great shampoo fpr gray hair? Look no further. matrix Total Results Care So Silver makes even coarse gray hair shiny and manageable. No more fly away frizzy hair or weighted down look lost-styling.</li>
    <li> My husband has been using this product for quite a few years.  His hair is all grey and thinning.  This product keeps his hair a great shade of grey and from turning yellow.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and was delighted to be able to purchase a much larger size finally.</li>
    <li> I bleach my hair a lot and I use this stuff to pull out the brassy tones so I can get white hair. I like to dye my hair pastel colors which pretty much requires you to have a really light blonde underneath for the color to show. I got this huge bottle and I still have so much. A few washes after bleaching with using this turns my hair playboy bunny blonde! lol Really though, it&#x27;s amazing for pulling out the brass.</li>
    <li> I bought this on my stylist&#x27;s recommendation to counter iron in well water...works well for toning down brassiness. Leave it on for about ten minutes and then CONDITION  (industrial strength)  as it is rather drying</li>
    <li> Excellent product and great service!</li>
    <li> Matrix Total Results Color Care So Silver was the first silver shampoo brand that I tried. Originally my hair color was blond (various shades from platinum to honey blond) and the color always seemed to go more brass than I wanted after a few shampoos when I used regular kind. Using the silver shampoo (provided you actually massage the hair/scalp while shampooing for at least 1 minute) worked wonders to neutralize brassiness and giving my hair color a more naturally cool sheen. I use the shampoo and follow up with Pantene Silver Expressions Daily Color Conditioner to soften my strands. Overall I am very happy with the shampoo (although it is very purple out of the bottle, it doesn&#x27;t stain anything).</li>
    <li> I have natural silver streaks in my hair and this shampoo does seem to make them somewhat lighter, intensifying the look.  You might want to wear protective gloves as it does turn your nails a bit purple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My friend, who has hair (OTC colored - Coleur Expert 8.2) very, very light blond, tried some of this shampoo and it did not remove every last hint of yellow.  However, it did create a lovely, somewhat platinum blond effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our results were subtle and were best noticed in natural sunlight.</li>
    <li> Keeps yellow hair gone. Workweek with a small amount weekly with my regular shampoo. Wish it was easier to find in the store</li>
    <li> This bottle sure has lasted a long time.  Works great and gets my hair squeaky clean.</li>
    <li> I received the shampoo today, we usually buy it from my beautician, but this is a cheaper price and a larger bottle. I don&#x27;t use it, my husband does. My beautician recommended it for my husband, his hair is completely white. He usually had a yellowish tone to his hair. After starting this shampoo, his hair is a beautiful white. He only uses it 3 times a week. It&#x27;s a must have shampoo. Thank you so much.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo for eliminating the gold or brashness in my blonde hair.</li>
    <li> My fav!!.. it works wonders for my gray hair</li>
    <li> My hair is naturally jet black but has recently been highlighted to brown and blonde. I&#x27;ve had Matrix Total Results So Silver for a month and used it maybe 5 times. I notice a significant difference in color and brightness when I left it on for 20 to 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;Makes my hair feel super coarse/dry immediately after rinsing it out. However,  once my hair is towel dried/slightly damp I apply Organix Argan Penetrating Oil and then blow dry. My hair looks noticeably brighter and feels luxuriously soft like salon quality!! (The oil is a definite recommend pick up as well)</li>
    <li> Definitely helps tone out the brassiness. My hair is super brassy atm so it&#x27;s not like an &#x27;overnight&#x27; amazing fix, but it&#x27;s definitely helping! There were a lot of reviews about it being really drying. It definitely dries out your hair, but if you&#x27;re like me who went from Asian black hair to very light blonde, you most likely have to use conditioner every time you wash your hair anyways. I feel it&#x27;s not as bad when you do an all over conditioner!</li>
    <li> this shampoo is great for my white hair which has a tendency to yellow-but using this keeps it looking whitest</li>
    <li> It keeps my hair from getting dull and yellow. Love it. No need to let it soak into your hair. Just wash as you normally would.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and true to description</li>
    <li> Worked great on my &amp;#34;bronde&amp;#34; hair to keep it from getting rusty.  It is a little drying by itself, but my normal routine is to use a deep conditioner so it wasn&#x27;t an issue.  I had zero staining to my hair, but I did have minor staining under and around my nails (I have natural nails and they&#x27;re short), so I started using disposable gloves when applying and it solved the problem.  I really like this product and will keep using it.  Because my hair is naturally dark and I went much lighter, I found I preferred to use this shampoo every other wash to keep my hair where I wanted it.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo. I use it every day and my gray hair shines.</li>
    <li> It makes ur hair stick together and all hard after rincing it out! I prefer my Goldwell Rich Repair, its not a purple shampoo but at least when I rinse that one out my hair is soft like if i had just rinced out conditioner!</li>
    <li> Fantastic results I will recommend this product to a friend...!</li>
    <li> I have naturally light blonde hair and I don&#x27;t feel like this has helped keep my hair light or tone down the brasiness.  I also feel like this Matrix Total Results shampoo dries out my hair VERY much and causes it to break.  I have since stopped using it.</li>
    <li> Full of sulfates. Did not expect that with a color shampoo.</li>
    <li> Made my hair lavender.</li>
    <li> Perfect transaction. Very happy</li>
    <li> I had been coloring my hair then decided to stop and let it be its natural grey.  It was a salt and pepper grey, but after a few months some parts had a gold cast.  My stylist recommended I try this and it now looks great.  I do not use it everyday, but a couple times a week or whenever the grey starts to look very drab.</li>
    <li> I have this product before and I do like it that&#x27;s why I ordered it.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo.  I have natural blond hair with some highlights added.  I have received a number of compliments on my hair color since I started using this shampoo.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with results. My hair was red. With age it turned blond, but with a brassy look. This product took out the brassiness. Use it about once a week.</li>
    <li> Used it twice so far, but it leaves my hair very soft.  I haven&#x27;t noticed a big difference yet in the color, though.</li>
    <li> Huge bottle,  is drying.  Use conditioner</li>
    <li> Works great on my highlights!</li>
    <li> Best tinted shampoo for keeping silver hair from going dingy, but remove all residue once a week with Bumble &amp; bumble Sunday Shampoo for best results.  Do not leave it on too long to avoid bluish or lavender tints.  Rinse out well.</li>
    <li> Amazon is the only place I was able to find this amazing product that wdoes really bring out the silver in my hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m surprised how much people have noticed the difference! I didn&#x27;t think it would be a big dealio - but judging from comments I receive it is quite an improvement. The 5 stars are what others say about it on me. :-)</li>
    <li> It works better to keep the yellow out than anything else I have used. It also serves well as a shampoo.</li>
    <li> Great product at a good price.</li>
    <li> I always use this shampoo.  My hair color is silver/white. I have thick hair and wear it in a long bob.  I also smoke which is &amp;#34;death&amp;#34; to white hair.  This shampoo works wonders.  I get compliments all the time on my beautiful hair color.  Would never be without this shampoo and would recommend it to people with gray hair and also people who color their hair.  Great product.</li>
    <li> It smells so bad that I will not use it and it did nothing for my hair.  It made it dryer than usual and couldn&#x27;t get the smell out!</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo for gray hair that I have tried. It is very thick and rich and you can tell the difference when you use it . It does not turn the hair blue if used properly.</li>
    <li> waited so long to find this again, glad to use it.</li>
    <li> I have tried many drugstore &amp;#34;purple&amp;#34; shampoos in the past and none have worked as well as this product.  To me it seems more concentrated and gets rid of the red/gold tones I tend to have perfectly.  I will purchase again!</li>
    <li> Amazing for blond hair</li>
    <li> This shampoo really does get the brassiness our of blonde hair, the purple color may be a little shocking at first but it really works. Others have mentioned that it is drying, but this isn&#x27;t something I have experienced. I highlight my hair about 4 times a year so perhaps that is why. Good price, good product.</li>
    <li> Excellent shampoo , been using it for yrs !</li>
    <li> This seems to work well. The size is large and the formula is thick. It turns your hands, scalp and shower purple. The shampoo is a very bright purple color. There is NO mention of this in the listing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I picked this up for my 88 year old father-in-law who lived in assisted living (he has now passed away) and the nurses wouldn&#x27;t use it. I spent a lot on it and didn&#x27;t want to throw it out. So I started using it for my (light brown) hair. I figured it would atleast get it clean. It did seem to add another dimension to my light brown hair. However, my white shower now has purple drip marks all over it. I&#x27;m going to need to scrub the shower to clean them. It is getting thrown out. PLEASE mention that it is bright purple and may stain.</li>
    <li> I have really white hair and this helps to keep it white instead of yellowish.</li>
    <li> Leaves gray shiny and bright, but somewhat drying.  Be sure to use conditioner after washing.  Would recommend for shiny, gray hair.  Good price.</li>
    <li> An excellent shampoo for white/silver hair. I wash my hair in the shower, put the shampoo on my hair immediately and rinse it out last thing. I believe having it on my hair the extra five minutes or so helps. I appreciate finding it in the large economy refill size. It is more economical. I would like to see it available in the Subscribe and Save department.</li>
    <li> This is my third purchase and I would not try anything else. I have pure white hair and I go swimming in the pool once in a while. What happens? If the chlorine can do strange things color yellow, light green dull and dry out hair. This shampoo keeps hair looking super and I get occasional compliments. I&#x27;m happy!</li>
    <li> Claire Leone Skody&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Matrix Total Results Color Care So Silver Shampoo For Blonde/Silver/White is great. I&#x27;ve been using it 2-3 times a week &amp; love the results.</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair really silky and whitens the dull white.</li>
    <li> Have been using it for many years i find it the best for silver hair keeps it from getting dule</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE you can notice a difference in your hair at the 2nd use! found my go-to blonde shampoo!</li>
    <li> This product removed all the orange tint from my salt and pepper hair. I shampoo and  rinse it out after 1 minute or less. If you leave it in longer than that, a faint purple tint will be evident on your dried hair.</li>
    <li> i HAD TROUBLE FINDING THIS IN THE BEAUTY SUPPLY STORES SO WAS HAPPY TO FIND IT ON LINE.  IT REALLY PUTS A GLOW TO GRAY HAIR.</li>
    <li> This is the second bottle of this shampoo I&#x27;ve ordered.  I love what it does to my naturally gray hair.  So soft and shiny.  I don&#x27;t even use conditioner anymore.  I ran out of this product and bought some other quality shampoo for gray hair from the local drug store (Jhirmack to be exact) and was very disappointed.  I promptly gave it to one of my blond nieces.  This giant bottle bottle last me almost a year.  You don&#x27;t need to use much.  I hope they never change the formula because this stuff is perfect!</li>
    <li> For blonde or silver hair and hard water, this is the product!!!  Takes away any yellowing every time, but don&#x27;t use as a daily shampoo! Once or twice a week works for me !!!! You will love it!!!!</li>
    <li> Have only used a couple of times, and haven&#x27;t seen much difference.</li>
    <li> First, this shampoo is not for the faint of heart. It&#x27;s intense color can be intimidating at first but it truly proves to work as described. You wont see any &amp;#34;incredible&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;magical&amp;#34; results the first time you use it, but the more you do the better. After two weeks of using it, my hair has turned from rusty brown to a beautiful platinum blonde color. A dab will do you, so the 33 oz will last you for quite some time.Only downside, is this shampoo is not moistorizing in the least bit. But you can avoid drying out your hair by only using product once or twice a week and with a deep conditioner. Don&#x27;t worry though, the reults are still great even when using once or twice a week.  Overall excellent product!!!</li>
    <li> I love the way it strips the dullness and leaves my hair soft and looking great! I highly recommend this for gray hair.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo...get comments ALL the time how my hair shines and has blue tinges...It make me feel younger and the blue is sooo much better then the yellowing my grey hair was experiencing.  I live in Florida and the sun and heat do a number on your hair here.</li>
    <li> I, having very gray hair, love this product.  This shampoo makes gray hair look silvery and shiny.  Have used this for years - love it!</li>
    <li> A nice big bottle and they shampoo is great for my white hair.</li>
    <li> Works as it says. It pulls the brassy out and leaves the wonderful blonde and very shiny. Been using this for over a year now love the results it gives</li>
    <li> I have used this shampoo for YEARS and my hair is snow white.  Don&#x27;t be scared if you are a first time user like I was.  It is dark purple out of the bottle but does not turn your hair purple.  I don&#x27;t use it every day, but several times a week to keep my white hair white.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have used this for a long time. I find it works best for me, without darkening my hair, to use one shampoo of Matrix So Silver and another of a regular shampoo. My hair is white and it keeps it from yellowing.</li>
    <li> This shampoo really works for blonde hair or highlights.  Works really good on the hair makes it darker brings down the yellowish / orangey tones.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before, so I knew what I was buying. I have gray hair that will get yellow streaks in it from the water. This product takes the yellow out. pam marshburn</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo! I get my hair highlighted every 6-8 weeks and I have hard well water.  This shampoo really keeps my blonde white and bright like I like.  This item was shipped to me in just two days.  Awesome service!</li>
    <li> this is a great product for removing any yellow, dull tinge in grey hair. It adds back that shiny silver look.</li>
    <li> This is very concentrated and maybe should be diluted for use.  It seems to have turned my white hair a tone of gray which was not what I wanted.  Maybe should be recommended for gray hair and specify it is not for white hair.</li>
    <li> Everything came as expected.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Have been using this product for several years</li>
    <li> Product arrived fast as lightning!  Very pleased. A friend who is a hairdresser had recommended this shampoo and gave me a bottle. I loved it right away and knew I would want to use it regularly. This seller had the best price out there.</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have found for shiny gray hair.  It makes my hair more manageable.  I am always complimented on my hair.  They all agree not to color it.</li>
    <li> i bleach my hair platinum and use this shampoo to keep out the yellow tones between colorings.  it is a great product that does exactly as advertised.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome. It definitely helped get rid of the yellow tones in my hair. Although I love this product I would only recommend using it a couple times a week. It helped so much my highlights started turning white. So I would advise how much it is being used but other than that its a great product. I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have tried lots of purple shampoos to keep the gold out of my hair. This is it. I have finally found the one I love. It works great. My color looks much better and this is a good shampoo.</li>
    <li> This took the yellow out of my hair.  I really like it.  The only drawback is it seems to dry my hair somewhat.</li>
    <li> Needs no words to describe. It is perfect for my silver hair.  I Would reccomend for any light colored hair.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years i have silver hair,and this is the only shampoo that I will use,it keeps my hair soft and silky and keeps the brassiness away,at least i have never seen any brassiness since my hair turned silver and i started using it.....i recommend it!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite shampoo! I have natural and color-treated blonde hair, but live in a location with mineral-rich tap water. Typically my blonde turns brassy pretty quickly because of the water type, but this shampoo instantly brightens it and keeps it yellow-free. Careful not to use on a daily basis or hair can change a purplish-tint (not permanently!)</li>
    <li> This shampoo is good for gray hair and the pump makes it easy and neat to use.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo because it does not dry my hair and helps eliminate brassy tones.  Product ships fast, which is a great help.</li>
    <li> the shampoo is a must for anyone wanting bright,shiney ,sexy highlights! makes my hair more managable and leaves it feeling so soft! the best  shampoo for anyone wanting to rid those brassy tones. worth the money! Love it, Love it, Love it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  jenjames</li>
    <li> Obsessed with this stuff! I have long bleached hair and am always looking for ways to brighten/whiten it. Purple shampoos usually stink and I was so excited to find one that smells so yummy! And, every time I use it (once every 3 washes) someone I know will ask if I&#x27;ve colored my hair or they will compliment me on the color/shine :)</li>
    <li> Same exact shampoo that I buy at the store/salon but with my Prime Membership, it costs me less and it arrives right at my front door. If you are a blond of any shade, you have to get this. I love it.</li>
    <li> A favorite product at a reasonable price. I did need to pour it into a smaller pump bottle for more convenient use.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t use it every day. It will make your hair blue.</li>
    <li> works well on my silver hair</li>
    <li> My husband has white hair and this keeps his hair beautifully silver white.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of years, now, and it&#x27;s a GREAT product. Gets rid of unwanted yellow so YES it works. Love the scent as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, been trying to find it in my homeland for months and, someone in a hair salon, told me the company was bankrupt and that&#x27;s why they didn&#x27;t have it for sale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thrilled you DO have it. Hope the company is up and running without difficulty because Matrix&#x27; products (I&#x27;ve used several others as well) are, IMHO, a must!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for many years. I love it!</li>
    <li> I swear by this wonderful purple shampoo! It gets rid of brassy tones in your hair! I shampoo one time and the second I leave sitting on my hair for several minutes. Suggestion~~use a really good conditioner after~~</li>
    <li> One of the best shampoos on the market for grey/silver hair and color treated hair.  With this product you never have to deal with yellowing silver hair, it&#x27;s amazing!!</li>
    <li> Great product for blond hair</li>
    <li> Works wonders on eliminating the yellow tones in my grey hair. A small amount goes a long way, so this will last me a while.</li>
    <li> I was frightened off when I read cautions on the container including,\\&quot;Wear disposable gloves when applying\\&quot; and other strong cautions. Should be stated in product description.</li>
    <li> I used it twice and once on my mother who is full of silver and it looks great</li>
    <li> I think this is knock off and not the real stuff. I have been using this many years now and this is not the same. I believe the real stuff has to be purchased in a salon.</li>
    <li> I was really hoping this would live up to it,s reviews. I have white hair that has a yellow cast on the crown. The Matrix has made no difference at all. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have not used. Warning on label-Not to be used for dyeing eyelashes or eyebrows. May cause blindness (thought it was a shampoo - Color Care) Avoid contact with eye and skin. Rinse thoroughly with water. Wear disposable gloves. Wash hands thoroughly after use.(After wearing gloves?) Guaranteed only when sold in salons</li>
    <li> 1 liter of this shampoo here on Amazon for less than what the 10 oz. size costs in stores.  This is great shampoo--gets the yellow out of grey hair and keeps it a nice, shiny silver.  Buy here and stock up.</li>
    <li> Aaahhhhhhhh! Says shampoo BUT REQUIRED A 2 DAY SKIN PATCH TEST BEFORE USE!!!!! Sounds scary to me- didn&#x27;t use! More of a dye? I don&#x27;t know but wasn&#x27;t interested I losing all of my hair or worse from some unknown reaction I was 2-day testing for! Yikes! Serious stuff in this bottle apparently!!</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed in this product.  I didn&#x27;t purchase the Matrix condition and unfortunately after using the shampoo alone my hair was like straw and until I found the proper amount to use, had a bluish-purple tint to it.  I have been using different shampoos design specifically for blonde/silver/white hair for years and never experienced the the extreme drying and straw-like texture.  I gave it a week or two, but ended up giving the product away to a friend. Disappointed and shocked as I&#x27;ve used other Matrix products in the past with very positive results.</li>
    <li> I have well water and since cancer, have left my hair natural color of salt and pepper. this shampoo gives your hair a beautiful shine, and highlights the gray/silver tones making my hair almost sparkle. It does not give you the undesirable &amp;#34;blue hair&amp;#34; look. It also makes my daughters light brown hair softer, taking out brassy tones. Great product and Amazon offers the best value I have found</li>
    <li> This shampoo is used to shampoo horses.  It is an excellent product that I swear by.  It must also be good on humans but I have never tried it.  I buy it in bulk and look for great prices and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> After seeing a picture of myself where my blonde hair looked super orange and brassy, I purchased this shampoo, the Joico violet conditioner, and a Sprite water filter for my shower. In ONE WASH my hair felt and looked a billion times better. Now that I&#x27;ve been using all three for a week, my hair looks completely different. Blonder and way softer. I don&#x27;t know how much of the improvement is attributable to each, but altogether I spent less than a trip to the salon and I&#x27;m so happy with all three.</li>
    <li> My hair is actually bright silver rather than gray so decided to find if this will make it shine.  It does.</li>
    <li> I love this product! Gets the yellow tones out fast! Much cheaper on amazon also! I use about 2x a week and it keeps my bright blonde from yellowing.</li>
    <li> I have platinum hair so I use this once a week to keep brassiness away. But the 4 stars is because I don&#x27;t care for the smell, and it doesn&#x27;t lather that much. But it WORKS great. I actually use this as toner now by leaving it lathered on my hair for 8 minutes instead of going through that whole process with toner/developer, ugh. So..I guess it has saved me a lot of money! But definitely brightens hair. You don&#x27;t need to use it every day, you will wind up with grey-ish hair if you do that!</li>
    <li> Love the way this shampoo makes my hair look and feel - My hair shines !!!!  Excellent price - shipped quickly</li>
    <li> This shampoo is SO expensive in stores, but it is a must for blonde hair in southern California with super hard water.  It keeps my blonde blonde and not yellowy.  The only warning is it will stain your tub if it drips.  I bought a pump also and use it all the time!!!  LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
    <li> I bought this based on recommendations for an effective shampoo to reduce yellowing in my grey hair. It is great for toning down my dark blonde coloring on the ends as I am in transition going grey. I saw a difference with first use and yse it ince a week.</li>
    <li> great product for keeping your grey hair from yellowing.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Smells good, not overpowering. What I like most is it does not make my silver hair purple. Keeps it silver, white. No yellow at all.</li>
    <li> My hair is very white. This shampoo keeps all the yellow from the away. It is great!</li>
    <li> Great color shampoo..</li>
    <li> This shampoo is very gentle and perfect for white hair. The friend I buy it for highly recommends it. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok not worth the money</li>
    <li> I am an African American woman with natural hair that is bleached blonde and highlighted. I originally bought the smaller bottle of this shampoo from my hair salon I go to because my stylist recommended it. I like it so much that I came on Amazon to find a bigger bottle and at a much cheaper price. This shampoo keeps my blonde from looking yellow or &amp;#34;brassy&amp;#34;. My hair does not look dingy or dull. The shampoo itself is a deep purple color and it really does an effective job at keeping my hair bright. Its also really good for Gray hair.</li>
    <li> It is a good product  not for everyday use.</li>
    <li> I started using it and saw my bath towel change color because of some product used in this shampoo. I then realize that those same products were going on my head and immediately throw it away.</li>
    <li> Just the best one ever!</li>
    <li> Love the shampoo. I purchased this as a refill for a smaller bottle. Matrix makes it hard to get the cap off but it can be done with a butter knife.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised.  Gets hair clean, reduces the yellow, and doesn&#x27;t leave the feeling residue like some purple shampoos do.  This is my favorite.</li>
    <li> it does all as expected keeps my hair from turning yellow&lt;br /&gt;and my hair feel great after a Matrix shampoo</li>
    <li> This product works well and keeps yellow gone, but it seems a bit harsh after a shampoo and I use a conditioner afterwards.  I have silver hair with very little yellow.  I bought this to keep it shiny and to keep any yellowing out.  It does a good job with the yellow, but not as good a job with keeping my hair shiny.</li>
    <li> This shampoo has SAVED my hair! I&#x27;ve been using this for a little over two years now. From going through numerous ombre&#x27;s and baylage&#x27;s, all while further processing and bleaching my hair, I often struggle with the brassy and yellow undertones. I use this shampoo every other day followed by my Ogx Morroccan Argan Oil Conditoner (my favorite) and my hair looks wonderfully light, bleached and healthy. This shampoo can dry out your hair so make sure to use a good hydrating conditioner and/or leave in product or mask! So worth the money. A similar shampoo by Pantene (SoSilver) works well, but this really gets the job done and a big bottle like this should last months on end.</li>
    <li> It is great!!  I order if over and over.</li>
    <li> I recently went blond from a brunette. My hair got really brassy after a week. I bought this stuff and it is amazing. It is a very intense purple. I saw a change immediately, the only downside is it doesn&#x27;t lather well. But this is worth it. Make sure to wear gloves, my fingernails got a little stained.</li>
    <li> For the most part, this has eliminated some of the brassiness of my platinum hair.  My stylist suggested it, so I sought it out in a larger size like this.  It&#x27;s purple, since the violet tone will help tone down the yellow in platinum hair.  It smells a bit like grape bubblegum.  It&#x27;s pleasant.  I notice that when I go to rinse it out, it does feel like my hair is quite dry.  I&#x27;m not sure if that is how it&#x27;s supposed to feel or not--it could be something with the toner.  I follow it up with a color care conditioner and my hair feels like normal again, so I&#x27;m not so worried about it.  This is perfect if you only wash your hair a few times a week.  I wouldn&#x27;t suggest it for daily use because I&#x27;ve heard tales of the violet depositing too heavily and giving hair a purple tone.</li>
    <li> This is some good stuff, and the price was right!</li>
    <li> shampoo works great.  is the same shampoo that I have used in the past It left my hair shining  and no iron in my hair.</li>
    <li> Makes your hair platinum blond!</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t brighten my gray hair as much as I expected, but it&#x27;s passable I guess.</li>
    <li> Amazing stuff really helps to reduce the yellow tones and gives your hair silver tone. Don&#x27;t use every day - it may make hoot hair lil bit purple</li>
    <li> Keeps the yellow out of grey hair.</li>
    <li> a great shampoo, it does keep the yellow  out of my beautful silver hair, and it makes my hair soft and shiny. the only cons are it does not soap up. im 46 yr. old and the print on the bottle is to small to read, do not use more than 3 days a week because it will&lt;br /&gt;turn your silver white.</li>
    <li> This is the greatest thing every for white hair, which never yellows with weekly use.</li>
    <li> This Matrix shampoo last a long time. My husband has silver hair this shampoo will also work on blond or grey streaked hair. Ver mild. We always keep a supply through Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have been buying different brands over the last few years and had not  tried the Matrix brand .  I like it so far. I use a lot less than with the other brands. A little bit goes a long way. It really gets rid of the brassiness in my hair after repeated use. I will stick with the Matrix brand for a while.</li>
