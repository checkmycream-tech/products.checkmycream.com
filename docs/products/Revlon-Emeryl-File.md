### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Excellent Product and Service.</li>
      <li>I checked at Amazon and was very happy to see I could order them here; ordered 3.</li>
      <li>This is still the best.</li>
      <li>My wife loved it so that is GREAT for me!!</li>
      <li>They arrived in great time and were just what I expected.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>The emery board is great.  </li>
      <li>Good product at a good price.</li>
      <li>Nice product</li>
      <li>Very happy to have found it here at such a great price.</li>
      <li>It does a great job really quickly.</li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t been able to find in stores, Can always count on Amazon to find what I like</li>
      <li>I bought this because the picture showed the 12.4 cm tortoiseshell handle file, which I haven&#x27;t been able to find in stores for years.  </li>
      <li>This five inch diamond cut is ok</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad to have discovered it on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>This is my all time favorite nail file.</li>
      <li>The blunt end makes product handling easy.</li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;just as easy to use another tool for cleaning&lt;br</li>
      <li>It works well and is easy to hold.  </li>
      <li>however they aren&#x27;t available in the stores sooooooo</li>
      <li>I had been using this model file for years, and then it no longer was available in the stores.</li>
      <li>The file is great, it is long, durable and easy to use.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not like the original one pictured.  </li>
      <li>Although this new one does not have the tortoise shell looking handle, it is the same length, the \\&quot;shaping\\&quot; and \\&quot;finishing\\&quot; sides are the same as on the original and the rounded tip is perfect for smoothing the ragged underside of the nail after you file it into the desired shape.  </li>
      <li>Its higher mass (due to its longer length) provides more inertia and, for me, balances much better.  </li>
      <li>It is nice to have a new file, I have had the old one for years.</li>
      <li>Nothing special, $5 is too much for this item</li>
      <li>tried many other kinds of nail files -- at the behest of the drugstore staff when this version wasn&#x27;t available.</li>
      <li>Been looking for this exact file for years, just what I wanted.</li>
      <li>i wish i could, IF I WERE SENT A REAL REVLON FILE!</li>
      <li>I have had this file and have found it to be the best, I was unable to locate it in any drug store or places like Target.</li>
      <li>A standard 10 cent emery board works much better.  </li>
      <li>It is made by Revlon and it may be that I&#x27;m just stuck on the original, but I don&#x27;t believe that it files as well as as my old one does.</li>
      <li>Many thanks to amazon and the third party seller for offering this hard-to-find but worth-the trouble-searching product!</li>
      <li>and though I&#x27;ve bought a few of the compact version, I&#x27;m very glad to have found this online</li>
      <li>So much safer than using a clipper where I might have difficulty seeing exactly up to which part</li>
      <li>I was first introduced to this particular file by Revlon in college, back in the mid 1970s, and loved it.  </li>
      <li>This one mostly fits the bill - metal, different &amp;#34;grit&amp;#34; levels on each side, decent length.  </li>
      <li>Thanks for the product.</li>
      <li>It is also very sturdy.  </li>
      <li>(Thanks, Amazon.</li>
      <li>I wanted a back-up for travelling, and have had the hardest time trying to find one similar to my original.  </li>
      <li>I love this metal file for filing down my baby&#x27;s nails.</li>
      <li>Later ordered 3 more from same vender and wouldn&#x27;t think twice about ordering from this vender again</li>
      <li>BUT the cost is too high.........</li>
      <li>with the sharp points as you can just&lt;br /&gt;get poked and stabbed to easily.  </li>
      <li>I use the \\&quot;finishing\\&quot; side to smooth the rough edges after.</li>
      <li>I have a few of both this file and the compact version (linked below), and this one balances much better.  </li>
      <li>Those extra 2 cm make for a better file, and I&#x27;m annoyed that they are apparently nowhere to be found any more.</li>
      <li>As others have mentioned, they were not, they were black handled and they cannot file even what the &amp;#34;finishing&amp;#34; side of the original one could.  </li>
      <li>B0015HPTR6 Revlon Compact Emery File with Soft Touch Handle - 1 ea]]</li>
      <li>Needless to say, I was delighted to find it on amazon.com.  </li>
      <li>I ordered two of the small versions of the Revlon files and made sure the source was different.</li>
      <li>I have used these Revlon Emeryl Files for many years, but lately had difficulty finding them in my local stores.</li>
      <li>enough, I&#x27;m just warning you that there seems to be at least one seller that is trying to pass off a 2 cent piece of cheap metal with soft nibs as a real REVLON nail file, and sell it for several dollars!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My wife loved it so that is GREAT for me!! Thanks for the product. Amazon is THE place to do your shopping!!!</li>
    <li> Nothing special, $5 is too much for this item (It was 5$ When I bought it). I&#x27;m not happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I have a few of both this file and the compact version (linked below), and this one balances much better.  Its higher mass (due to its longer length) provides more inertia and, for me, balances much better.  Walmart stopped carrying this one locally and though I&#x27;ve bought a few of the compact version, I&#x27;m very glad to have found this online and I&#x27;m ordering some.    [[ASIN:B0015HPTR6 Revlon Compact Emery File with Soft Touch Handle - 1 ea]]</li>
    <li> I bought this because the picture showed the 12.4 cm tortoiseshell handle file, which I haven&#x27;t been able to find in stores for years.  What came in the mail was the 10.3 cm black handle file.  Those extra 2 cm make for a better file, and I&#x27;m annoyed that they are apparently nowhere to be found any more.</li>
    <li> I love this metal file for filing down my baby&#x27;s nails. It does a great job really quickly. The \\&quot;shaping\\&quot; side is rougher and takes down her nails in seconds. I use the \\&quot;finishing\\&quot; side to smooth the rough edges after. So much safer than using a clipper where I might have difficulty seeing exactly up to which part I&#x27;m cutting and if she squirms, there&#x27;s no worry about accidentally hurting her! AND, it&#x27;s a tool I can use for both baby and myself!</li>
    <li> The file is great, it is long, durable and easy to use. But what is advertised is not what you get, instead you end up with a plain black plastic handled version of what is pictured.</li>
    <li> In July I purchased 8 of these thinking I had found a few remaining tortoise shell handled files, as pictured.  As others have mentioned, they were not, they were black handled and they cannot file even what the &amp;#34;finishing&amp;#34; side of the original one could.  I paid $8.99 for each one and should have demanded my money back.  They are indeed worthless.</li>
    <li> I had been using this model file for years, and then it no longer was available in the stores. I&#x27;m so glad to have discovered it on Amazon.  It works well and is easy to hold.  Because it&#x27;s longer than the norm, it can last longer if you use both ends of the same side.  Just reverse that same side by holding the handle in your non-dominant hand and using your dominant hand to hold the other end.  Then, file away.</li>
    <li> Been looking for this exact file for years, just what I wanted. Later ordered 3 more from same vender and wouldn&#x27;t think twice about ordering from this vender again and yes would recommend them to family and friends.  Cherie Radley</li>
    <li> This is my all time favorite nail file. And they&#x27;re becoming quite difficult to find in retail drug stores. (Thanks, Amazon. I was getting desperate.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why? It works, files nails well. It is durable. You can use it for ages; the surfaces hold up. And it doesn&#x27;t break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also doesn&#x27;t have sharp edges which create painful cuts below the nail (nail beds) or on the sides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have tried many other kinds of nail files -- at the behest of the drugstore staff when this version wasn&#x27;t available. There is just no comparison. This is still the best.</li>
    <li> If this file was two inches longer you would have a file that would sell. This five inch diamond cut is ok</li>
    <li> The emery board is great.  The blunt end makes product handling easy. It is also very sturdy.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> This file with the rounded tip is my favorite&lt;br /&gt;ever.  Been using it for 20 years.  I don&#x27;t like the&lt;br /&gt;ones with the sharp points as you can just&lt;br /&gt;get poked and stabbed to easily.  And it&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;just as easy to use another tool for cleaning&lt;br /&gt;nails etc.  Highy recommend....</li>
    <li> I was first introduced to this particular file by Revlon in college, back in the mid 1970s, and loved it.  I lost it about 15 years later and rushed out to buy a replacement because life (my nails) just were not the same without it.  About 4 months ago, I misplaced it and was not happy to discover that it was nowhere to be found.  There is a shorter version, with a pointy tip, that pales in comparison.  Needless to say, I was delighted to find it on amazon.com.  Although this new one does not have the tortoise shell looking handle, it is the same length, the \\&quot;shaping\\&quot; and \\&quot;finishing\\&quot; sides are the same as on the original and the rounded tip is perfect for smoothing the ragged underside of the nail after you file it into the desired shape.  Many thanks to amazon and the third party seller for offering this hard-to-find but worth-the trouble-searching product!</li>
    <li> I have used these Revlon Emeryl Files for many years, but lately had difficulty finding them in my local stores. I checked at Amazon and was very happy to see I could order them here; ordered 3. What arrived did not look at all like the same files, and worse yet, they were completely worthless in terms of using them as a file. The three that arrived had NO NAME imprinted, both sides were the same, different shaped black plastic with a worthless file that had a tip on the end. Same on both sides, equally useless. I&#x27;m tossing them. I ordered two of the small versions of the Revlon files and made sure the source was different. We&#x27;ll see how that goes. My suggestion is to save your money, don&#x27;t trust what you see here. Not worth sending back, but what a waste!</li>
    <li> After I cut my nails, I like to take off the sharp edges (a desire stemming from the time in high school when one of my classmates managed to accidentally gouge a three-inch furrow down my wrist that, quite literally, scarred me for life, all because he&#x27;d just cut his nails).  I prefer a metal emery board/file, and I&#x27;ve been using the same one for about twenty years now. I wanted a back-up for travelling, and have had the hardest time trying to find one similar to my original.  This one mostly fits the bill - metal, different &amp;#34;grit&amp;#34; levels on each side, decent length.  But the metal &amp;#34;grit&amp;#34; has several spots where multiple bits of &amp;#34;grit&amp;#34; were mal-formed in the creation process, leaving semi-smooth wrinkles on the blade that do nothing to my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, this is definitely a first-world problem... I&#x27;ll show myself out.</li>
    <li> It is nice to have a new file, I have had the old one for years. Its too bad they quit making them.</li>
    <li> Nice product and I&#x27;ll likely use it BUT the cost is too high.........however they aren&#x27;t available in the stores sooooooo</li>
    <li> NOT REVLON.  This is my 3rd attempt at reviewing this product, and Amazon keeps blocking it.  Maybe because i was trying to warn you of a specific seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good enough, I&#x27;m just warning you that there seems to be at least one seller that is trying to pass off a 2 cent piece of cheap metal with soft nibs as a real REVLON nail file, and sell it for several dollars!  I don&#x27;t usually post reviews, but felt that this was blatant bait and switch. Just look carefully at the seller&#x27;s profile and feedback before buying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or, maybe Amazon feels that I should be reviewing the Revlon file shown in the picture?  i wish i could, IF I WERE SENT A REAL REVLON FILE!</li>
    <li> Perfect--just what I wanted.  Haven&#x27;t been able to find in stores, Can always count on Amazon to find what I like</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not like the original one pictured.  It is made by Revlon and it may be that I&#x27;m just stuck on the original, but I don&#x27;t believe that it files as well as as my old one does.</li>
    <li> I have had this file and have found it to be the best, I was unable to locate it in any drug store or places like Target.</li>
    <li> Excellent Product and Service.</li>
    <li> Good product at a good price.</li>
    <li> Total Disappointment.  It looks like one of the many diamond files that I have used for the last 30 years, but he cutting surface barely removes any material.  It is a failure in my opinion.  A standard 10 cent emery board works much better.  I like the size.  It doesn&#x27;t have the Tortoise shell handle shown in the photo, as others have complained.  I don&#x27;t care.  It just doesn&#x27;t do the job it is supposed to.  The shipping was over $5. for the ten cent item.  If it filed nails, I would be happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary:  It is so pathetically dull it will end up in the trash after one use.</li>
    <li> They arrived in great time and were just what I expected.&lt;br /&gt;This style has been discontinued and have become almost impossible to find.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m grateful to have them and will use them for some time to come!</li>
    <li> This is the only nail file my mother in law will  use. Very happy to have found it here at such a great price. I received my order within a week. Couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
