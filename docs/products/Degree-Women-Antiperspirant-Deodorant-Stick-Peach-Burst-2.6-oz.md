      <li>Favorite deoderant.</li>
      <li>I do LOVE Unilever products...</li>
      <li>I really need clinical protection A-P, but thought I&#x27;d try this since it was recommended by a friend and was a good deal, plus I liked the motion sense aspect of it.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not awful, but it just doesn&#x27;t have that peach scent</li>
      <li>I have always used degree deodorant and my favorite is sexy intrigue</li>
      <li>Love it .</li>
      <li>Love Degree and this product.</li>
      <li>Degree is actually my favorite deodorant.</li>
      <li>favorite Degree is still Sexy Intrigue.</li>
      <li>love its smell, works all day</li>
      <li>I do have my favorite scents.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Problem is, I don&#x27;t love the scent.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s strong but gentle and very effective.  </li>
      <li>If I can smell it more than 18 inches away, it is too strong).</li>
      <li>so it comes out in the wash, but I&#x27;m pretty sure I would have to do this with most any antiperspirant.</li>
      <li>It is a light, fruity non-descript scent.  </li>
      <li>I really enjoy the scent</li>
      <li>At some point your old deodorant stops doing its job try this one it smells good and works well.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a dancer, so it&#x27;s really important for myself and everyone around me that I smell fresh!</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re an avid runner, walker or enjoy active outdoor activities, this is ideal for you.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s too sweet for me but its all about preference.</li>
      <li>And true, you can smell it every time you move.  </li>
      <li>Not only does it smell good, it holds up to its 48 hour guarantee.</li>
      <li>Nice smell, not too overpowering, but strong enough to detect.</li>
      <li>I can use it all day and not smell like BO, and the scent itself is mild</li>
      <li>I really, really love peach scent normally, but not crazy about this scent once it was on.  </li>
      <li>I like this scent and the Fresh Burst.  </li>
      <li>but this new fragrance of peach burst is very nice and lasts all day long!</li>
      <li>But I will certainly use this one up.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t think it lasts through much work though.</li>
      <li>I have to treat fabric very carfully</li>
      <li>Degree motionsense does really work .</li>
      <li>I also really like this scent.</li>
      <li>I really like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really like the pech smell</li>
      <li>I think this fragrance reminds me so much of the orange cranberry version released by degree .</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t really smell like peaches.</li>
      <li>It actually seems to be more effective than any other product with the same claim.  </li>
      <li>It is really effective as an antiperspirant and deodorant, but it gave me a rash when I left it on for too long.</li>
      <li>Weirdly enough, the Peach Burst scent is the only one that really works consistently for me - but it lasts the full amount of time as described.</li>
      <li>It smelled just ok from the container, but for me personally, a little nauseating smelling it all day.  </li>
      <li>Smells good, took a long time to get here, and it expires in a few months.</li>
      <li>I am from the states and now live in AU</li>
      <li>I feel dry for the  full day after running around with a 10 month old and doing my retail job.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m glad that this one smells the same since they discontinued the other one.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s protects me from morning to night even when I work outside in hot summer days .</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t work as well as I was hoping (a full 24 hour day), but it does work extremely well for 12-14 hours depending on your activity level.</li>
      <li>Could be stronger like other degree deodorants but not bad.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and have been using this product for years, alternating scents.  </li>
      <li>And it is already failing me as far as controlling perspiration odor.  </li>
      <li>After a few hours of summer yard work it has pretty much worn off.</li>
      <li>The price is a little higher than my local walmart (.75 to be exact)</li>
      <li>My only concern with this deodorant is that I don&#x27;t always feel dry (but better than other brands) and it does leave residue on clothes.</li>
      <li>It goes on white but is clear on your skin.  </li>

    <li> I feel dry for the  full day after running around with a 10 month old and doing my retail job.  I also really like this scent.</li>
    <li> I love this deodorant! First off, it smells so good! Who wouldn&#x27;t want their armpits smelling like a juicy peach!? Not only does it smell good, it holds up to its 48 hour guarantee. I rarely, rarely, go 48 hours without a shower but situations come up where taking a shower at the time (sick kid, hospital, etc) wasn&#x27;t an option so it definitely works for 48 hours. The price is a little higher than my local walmart (.75 to be exact) but I was already ordering some things on here and decided to throw a couple sticks in my cart while I was at it.</li>
    <li> It is really effective as an antiperspirant and deodorant, but it gave me a rash when I left it on for too long.</li>
    <li> Works well. I put on in the morning and it still works and smells good when I undress at night. I&#x27;ll buy again.</li>
    <li> Smells good, took a long time to get here, and it expires in a few months. Won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
    <li> I really need clinical protection A-P, but thought I&#x27;d try this since it was recommended by a friend and was a good deal, plus I liked the motion sense aspect of it.  And true, you can smell it every time you move.  I really, really love peach scent normally, but not crazy about this scent once it was on.  It smelled just ok from the container, but for me personally, a little nauseating smelling it all day.  And it is already failing me as far as controlling perspiration odor.  I do LOVE Unilever products...all of them, except Degree products.</li>
    <li> Smells great. Great product.</li>
    <li> Smells nothing like peaches, in fact it smells like a mans deodorant.</li>
    <li> I like this scent and the Fresh Burst.  I have sensitive skin and have been using this product for years, alternating scents.  It&#x27;s strong but gentle and very effective.  I can&#x27;t imagine switching.</li>
    <li> Love this deodorant, have been using Degree for years. I especially love the smell of the peach. My only concern with this deodorant is that I don&#x27;t always feel dry (but better than other brands) and it does leave residue on clothes.</li>
    <li> Degree motionsense does really work . It&#x27;s protects me from morning to night even when I work outside in hot summer days . I don&#x27;t really like the pech smell it&#x27;s too sweet for me but its all about preference.</li>
    <li> I think this fragrance reminds me so much of the orange cranberry version released by degree . I really enjoy the scent and I&#x27;m glad that this one smells the same since they discontinued the other one.</li>
    <li> Degree is actually my favorite deodorant. Performance-wise I have no complaints. It works great! I can use it all day and not smell like BO, and the scent itself is mild it will not attract attention (I hate odorous personal care products. If I can smell it more than 18 inches away, it is too strong). In this case, you can&#x27;t even smell this 18 inches away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Problem is, I don&#x27;t love the scent. It doesn&#x27;t really smell like peaches. I&#x27;m honestly not sure what it smells like. When I asked my mom to smell it, she said... Vanilla. I don&#x27;t agree. It is a light, fruity non-descript scent.  It&#x27;s not awful, but it just doesn&#x27;t have that peach scent I really like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite Degree is still Sexy Intrigue. But I will certainly use this one up.</li>
    <li> At some point your old deodorant stops doing its job try this one it smells good and works well.</li>
    <li> A great deodorant.  Pleasant fragrance and works!</li>
    <li> I have always used degree deodorant and my favorite is sexy intrigue but this new fragrance of peach burst is very nice and lasts all day long! I would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> it works, scent is very subtle, not sure I like smelling like a peach</li>
    <li> Favorite deoderant. Never have any issues with this at all. If you allow it to dry before dressing it won&#x27;t leave white marks, but if you are in a hurry it will definitely be visible on your clothes. I have to treat fabric very carfully so it comes out in the wash, but I&#x27;m pretty sure I would have to do this with most any antiperspirant. I trust this deoderant, and I sweat a lot.</li>
    <li> Love the scent and it lasts like it says it should</li>
    <li> Love it . Smell so good.</li>
    <li> Smells good and works well. Unfortunately it makes my pits itch and burn.</li>
    <li> Could be stronger like other degree deodorants but not bad.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as I was hoping (a full 24 hour day), but it does work extremely well for 12-14 hours depending on your activity level.</li>
    <li> love its smell, works all day</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn degree deodorant since 2000. I&#x27;m a truck driver and at that time I had to unload my trailer at the stops I delivered too. The other deodorant I would have to keep applying thru out the day. So i tried degree and I put it on in the morning and it holds me all day. I never have to re-apply it. Through out the years I&#x27;ve tried their different scents. But they all work for me. I do have my favorite scents.</li>
    <li> Always a great product. It is so good I have it shipped to Australia. I am from the states and now live in AU and this is the one item I have to get from the states. &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Nice smell, not too overpowering, but strong enough to detect. Don&#x27;t think it lasts through much work though. After a few hours of summer yard work it has pretty much worn off.</li>
    <li> this stuff is great! the smell lasts for hours and it is a great antiperspriant in the hot summer months.</li>
    <li> Love Degree and this product. I&#x27;m a dancer, so it&#x27;s really important for myself and everyone around me that I smell fresh! Weirdly enough, the Peach Burst scent is the only one that really works consistently for me - but it lasts the full amount of time as described. Great scent. I&#x27;d buy again, every time!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an excellent product.  I purchased this for my wife and she loves the lite scent as well as the durability.  It goes on white but is clear on your skin.  No more white streaks on black shirts or dresses.  It&#x27;s motion sense promise is no joke.  It actually seems to be more effective than any other product with the same claim.  If you&#x27;re an avid runner, walker or enjoy active outdoor activities, this is ideal for you.</li>
    <li> Great product that performs very well! Definately my go-to deodorant!</li>
    <li> Smells nice. Lasts long.</li>
    <li> Awesome scent. Works.</li>
