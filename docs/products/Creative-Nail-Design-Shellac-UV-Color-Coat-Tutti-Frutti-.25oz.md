<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was not thrilled with this color.  Shellac normally lasts for 3 weeks, but this one had chips within 5 days.  It is a funky color, and changes in different light.  In sunlight, it looks almost violet.  Fluorescent lighting gives it a hot pink look.  It has a sort of irridescent shimmer in the sunlight, but it is subtle.  There is no sparkle under indoor lighting.  I will keep looking for a sparkly, non-glitter deep pink - this wasn&#x27;t it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m normally into the natural look and the shellac negligee is my favorite, but this color is so beautiful especially now in the Easter and Spring time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who are new to shellac - this is NOT a regular polish!  It&#x27;s a system and requires a base, top coat and uv lamp to cure the color.</li>
    <li> again, fabulous product.  it&#x27;s just a great bright pink, love it. the shine and staying power are amazing.  CDC is the only shellac i use because it&#x27;s the easiest to remove.</li>
    <li> Received my CND Shellac UV Color Coat Tutti Frutti polish in less than 4 days. Very quick shipping.  It was packaged well and appeared new and unopened.  I have just used it on my pedicure and the color is beautiful! Very vibrant, almost neon.  It is a blend of hot pink/fuschia with a fine pearlized lavender reflectivity that almost appears holographic! Very bright, very vivid.  Both my husband and college-age son like it, too.  My son said the color was \\&quot;sassy\\&quot;.  With the CND clear top coat, this polish is so glossy and brilliant.  I&#x27;m really enjoying it.  I think this color would probably look good on just about any skin tone and it is equally good for winter as it would be for spring or summer.  Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> What a beautiful color!  Tutti Frutti is perfect for spring, summer or anytime you want a pretty and fun color.  CND Shellac is the Cadillac of gel manicure products and this color is one of their prettiest.  A beautiful shade of pink that shines a pretty shade of an iridescent blue in certain light.  You&#x27;ll love it!</li>
    <li> I love this color. Very girly, fun, spring/summer. I use it often.</li>
    <li> I love gel nail polish, and CND is my favorite brand.  OPI has a much better selection of colors, but they don&#x27;t come with a brush, and they are SO thick.  You have to stir and stir.  Hopefully, CND will catch up and offer more colors.</li>
    <li> Love the finished product.  It really lasts for about 3 weeks.  The removal method takes longer to do than normal polish remover; however, if you plan ahead and don&#x27;t rush it, it comes off easily after the full 10 minutes.  The only complaint I have is there is not enough variety in color selections at this time.  Hope eventually there will be more to choose from.</li>
    <li> When I got the bottle, I was disappointed seeing it because it appeared to be NEON pink!  However, when I opened the bottle to give it a thorough look, I saw how beautiful it is!  It&#x27;s my favorite!  As another has commented already, it&#x27;s a brighter pink with a purple pearlized into it...  Very beautiful!</li>
    <li> I chose this and Tropix as my summer pedicure colors and could not be more pleased.  I love the Shellac process and do it myself.  This is really a bold bright summertime pink!</li>
    <li> I love this color.  It&#x27;s a fun Spring-Summer color and I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of complements on how pretty it is.  The best way to describe the color is fuchsia.  It&#x27;s a pink with a purple undertone.  So pretty.  I use to use OPI soak off but I&#x27;m switching.  With OPI I have to file the color off, it doesn&#x27;t come off easy just by soaking your hands in acetone.  With the Shellac, I do minimal soaking and it just peels off, and it doesn&#x27;t harm my nail bed like OPI.  I wish they had as many colors as OPI but I&#x27;m sure eventually they will; they&#x27;re popular right now.</li>
    <li> tutti fruiti is a great summer polish ! The color is fun and sort of a bright magenta pink with violet highlites. I have been wanting this color for a while, and sorry I waited so long to buy it. Best color yet from CND.</li>
    <li> I like this color a lot. My fave is Hollywood (red) but this mixes things up a bit. I am pretty pale skin so this pops in a good way. Like all shellac gel polishes it is super shiny and looks wet all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did find this color to \\&quot;shrink\\&quot; a touch, but it&#x27;s certainly workable (unlike Fedora, a color I adored, but a polish I could not work with at all).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s eerything the name implies - fun and bubbly! I would repurchase for sure!</li>
    <li> Fantastic color. Very Springy and shiny. Goes on smooth and the LED light cures the color well. Only use two thin coats</li>
    <li> It was exactly what my daughter-in-law wanted for Christmas. I was unable to purchase it anywhere else without a cosmetic license.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product. And this is one of my favorite colors. It really pops and looks nice on almost any skin color.</li>
    <li> Its hard to tell on the internet just what color your going to get, but this one is beautiful. Its a bright hot pink with a little purple irradescense to it. You wil be pleased.</li>
    <li> This color looks great on.  Looks good for most of the twi weeks. Makes hands look great. Will huy agsin.</li>
    <li> Tutti Frutti is one of the best colors made by CND. It has great coverage; no more than 2 coats needed, unlike the disappointing transparent colors where you can still see nail imperfections even after 3 coats. I wish CND would offer better descriptions of their nail colors so buyers know the transparency level prior to purchase. Tutti Frutti is a bright pink, but not neon or hot pink. It&#x27;s also very shiny and easy to work with. I rarely purchase the same color twice, but this will be an exception.</li>
    <li> I love this color, it is not too neon but is so bright and fun.  It was delivered to my house within 5 days too.</li>
    <li> The color is amazing!  Perfect for all seasons. It has an irridesant look to it. The exact look I was looking for. Many people have asked me where I get my polish colors and I tell them Amazon!</li>
    <li> Great summer color, as pictured ! Love Shellac, last for at least 2 weeks if applied properly! I will definitely get other colors</li>
    <li> i got this color done at a nail place it looks perfect it looks perfect for the beach you could do anything like soak your nails but it won&#x27;t do any harm tto the color&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S  use alcohol swabs to shine your nails when wearing</li>
    <li> I love this color! It&#x27;s very vibrant and is my favorite color to wear. CND shellacs go on so smoothly and evenly, I love them. The color is intense, but looks best with 2 - 3 coats.</li>
    <li> Very nice color with a little iridescent that looks simply beautiful!  Nail enamel lasts 2 weeks as offered by CND.</li>
    <li> Best Shellac color ever.  It makes my nails look like I have acrylic on!  Love it!</li>
    <li> Love this color , got million compliments on it</li>
    <li> Arrived on time in new condition. Great price on a product of the highest quality. I love CND!</li>
    <li> At first I thought the color was going to be too neon bright, but when I put it on the color was just right. A beautiful pink that really looks fantastic on the hand.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this color.  I have been using Harmony Gelish, but CND lasts soooo much longer and no lifting or chipping and it has been on 2 weeks.  The color is exactly as it is shown here. I am a new fan of CND!</li>
    <li> Love the color but it doesn&#x27;t work well with the UV LIGHT for me</li>
    <li> While I like this color it&#x27;s very, very bright and pigmented and it also has a slight glittery sheen to the polish. It&#x27;s a beautiful color but more appropriate for vacation or weekends and not the professional workplace. Otherwise I do like the color.</li>
    <li> This brand seems to work much better than others you can purchase at department stores. It&#x27;s my all time favorite color!</li>
    <li> Highly recommend this color to anyone.  It changes color in different light, sort of radiates hues of pink and purple.  The product was received promptly and was priced well.</li>
    <li> I love the Shellac gels, and this color is beautiful!  Very bright pink with a bit of a purple shimmer to it in certain lights.  Similar to OPI&#x27;s Pompeii Purple.</li>
    <li> I received this very quickly. I LOVE the color, and it seems to stay on the best out of any CND color I have used. It&#x27;s such a beautiful color! I bought it to wear in the summer but this may just be a year-round favorite now!</li>
    <li> Right color and arrived ahead of schedule. Color stands out and there is more then enough for both hands and toes.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> This color seems accurate to the sample shown here. I love this happy color. It is a very bright pink.</li>
    <li> Great color and it lasts for two weeks. Would order similar products again. It definitely saves money versus having your nails done at the salon.</li>
    <li> I received this Cnd Shellac UV Color Coat Tutti Frutti nail polish in a very prompt and timely manner from this seller.  The color was as I expected for a nice bright hot pink.  I haven&#x27;t used it yet but am not disappointed at all.  Thank you again for another great polish I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get a lot of use out of!</li>
    <li> I purchased this polish in TuttiFrutti and it is a wow pink with a sort of subtle fuschia purplish hue. It&#x27;s a fun color.</li>
    <li> Beautiful color. The perfect summer color. I love it.</li>
    <li> If you love hot pinks, you&#x27;ll love this color!&lt;br /&gt;Try a French manicure with this color instead of white tips. Super cute!!</li>
    <li> ...MAC NW45 and I love this color. It really complements my skin tone! There&#x27;s nothing much to it, simply love it!</li>
    <li> This is a good product. It is a nice shade and works great. Although it does take a while to set even with the UV light turned up, that is to be expected with a strong setting nail polish.</li>
    <li> I ordered this bottle to replace a bottle I had purchased back in 2011.  Love this color!  One of my summer staples!</li>
    <li> Bottle is small as advertised but to not have to rely on the salon all the time for nails is nice</li>
    <li> This polish is the absolute perfect uv color polish the color is true what you see is what it drys as. I want to order all the colors from CND my clients and my entire nail salon love them. I&#x27;m gonna buy all of them for sure thank you</li>
    <li> I love CND Shellac Tutti Frutti.  It could have lasted more than two weeks but I like changing colors often.  I bought my UV Light in my local Sallys Beauty Supply store.  It doesn&#x27;t have to be the CND one.  Will continue buying CND Shellac  UV Color Coats.  LOVE THEM ALL!!!</li>
    <li> I take care of my Aunt and one of our treats are to do manicures, this looked like a fun color&lt;br /&gt;So we ordered and the polish came very promptly, knot knowing I rejected the unopened box containing the polish and a prompt refund was given so now i have to reorder and hope the kind vendor will forgive me</li>
    <li> Very pretty, funky girly color. Lots of compliments with this color. I do nails and this color is often requested, even for people who are not too crazy about pink. Try it.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST shade of pink out there!  Very bright but not &amp;#34;neon&amp;#34;.  I have had the most compliments on my nails when whearing this color.  Last night I tried Tutti Frutti as the first coat and Baroness Red on top.  SO pretty!  It&#x27;s great how you can change it up just a little by mixing the color layers.</li>
    <li> I love this Hot Pink color! It is bold and commands attention!&lt;br /&gt;This is our signature color for our Relay For Life Team!&lt;br /&gt;Try it ~~you will like it!</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t go back to regular polish again.  I love doing my nails and it lasting for two weeks.  Great product!</li>
    <li> This color goes on beautifully. It looks like it does at the salon. I can&#x27;t say that about all of the CND colors, but this one is one I would purchase again. Used w/ the CND base and top coat.</li>
    <li> Fits a little snug on my husbands narrow head but we expect it to stretch a bit. Overall it&#x27;s great and fun!!</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and was exactly as described.</li>
    <li> Love Love this color, I am not even a pink freek, but is the perfect pink with a hint of purple at certain angles. Such an awesome color!!! Even my husbend likes the color!</li>
    <li> Bright color as the picture</li>
    <li> This is my favorite color.  I like the fact that i can now save money by doing my own nails at home with the same product as in the nail salon.</li>
    <li> This is a great summer color. Hot pink is one of my favorite summer colors &amp; this one doesn&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
    <li> Great color!  Everyone loves it.</li>
    <li> Can tend to wrinkle up if you put it on too thick. First coast SUPER thin and the next coat can be slightly thicker.</li>
    <li> I really loved this color. Originally went for a mani/pedi and picked the same color out. Now I can just fix my chips with my own color.  It&#x27;s a nice vacation, summer color. Hope the weather warms up so I can use it again.</li>
    <li> This is totally my favorite color now. Looks great on, stayed put. Reminds me of a few of my favorite China Glaze polishes that I have. Perfect for summer. I got so many compliments at stores and around town from people who liked the color also.</li>
    <li> And the LED light I have does not dry these.  I even replaced the 5 bulbs, maybe because it is 6 watts x 5 bulbs, and they are a white LED black light. I had a state license for being a professional manicurist.&lt;br /&gt;So my light is a good light but was for drying regular polish, I maybe need a little fan hooked up to it.</li>
    <li> I play finger style guitar and no nail polish, hardener or base and top coat worked to protect my nails while playing. I switched to shellac with great results. I take it off and replace every two weeks. Fewer chipped, split, peeling, broken nails than with anything else I&#x27;ve tried at home. Big initial investment to buy a good light, selection of top, base and color, acetone, 99% alcohol, Scrub Fresh, lint-free wipes, a soaking tray. But it all pays off after about six applications or so of applying at home. Then you still have all your supplies which last a very long time. I like that I get to file perfectly smooth and shape for guitar playing. I could not get a profession manicurist to do it as I wanted for guitar. Plus, I like doing it at my convenience at home. No appointment necessary! Keep it all away from young kids and flame.</li>
    <li> This color reminds me of OPI Pompei Purple - but a little brighter.  It looks so pretty on!  I will be wearing this color a lot!</li>
    <li> This is the most amazing product.  The color and shine is equal to that you would receive from a professional.  I will be buying more colors of this product.</li>
    <li> Love this colour Tuti Fruiti</li>
    <li> great summer color.  CND shellac lasts about 10 days for me but that is 8 days longer than other products.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite summer shellac color!!  As all the shellac products, it will last at least two weeks.  I describe this color as \\&quot;fuschia.\\&quot;  I wear this color plain, or jazz it up with nail art.  Have some fun and wear Tutti Frutti!</li>
    <li> Great summer color with a lasting finish</li>
    <li> I chose this color for my wedding after at first going along with the program and planning on a french manicure or maybe a very soft pink.... WOW this color did the trick!!! My wedding ring popped and it was just enough of the wild side to express my personality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be reaching for this color when I wanna add a little swag to my style ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with any of the CND shellacs, this one held up perfectly for 14 days...YAY!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent product and seller!</li>
    <li> No issues with the purchase or delivery, Very satisified with the product. Same quality as what is used in the salon. Color is stunning</li>
    <li> Easy to use - beautiful - true to the color displayed.  I get lots of compliments and it really stays on for two to three weeks!!</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorites!  It has a irradesecent purple undertome and the hot pink go so well together.  If ever you were a pompei purple fan this is it in the CND line!</li>
    <li> fast shipping, item was exactly as described.</li>
    <li> This is a super fun summer color, goes on smooth and wears well. I will keep this one in stock....a definite reorder</li>
    <li> It was fast and good. I am happy with what I bought and to who I bought it. I would do it again.</li>
    <li> This color is much brighter than expected - its closer to hot pink than it is to the fuchsia color expected.  Shellac brand is great!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite Creative Nail Design Shellac color!  It is great for any time of year, and is fun and cheerful.</li>
    <li> This is by far one of my favorite shellac colors.  It has a very nice shimmer to it.  CND is the best brand.</li>
    <li> I am no nail technician, I work on and around cars all the time. This color is perfect for summertime. And this product is great! I can save money and do my own nails and they will look as good as a salon did it, once I get some practice in! I only suggest, dont put it on too thick, the heat from the curing lamp will make it bubble up, that happened on one nail that I did accidently put too much color on. OH well!! I love it!</li>
    <li> Good Spring/Summer Color.  Please be aware that this polish is part of the CND Shellac system and requires the CND Shellac Top and Base Coats to work properly.  Also you will need the UV lamp to cure the polish.  I don&#x27;t usually get 2 full weeks from this polish but that could be because my technique is faulty.  I still love that the polish doesn&#x27;t chip as easily as regular polish and I get about a week of wear before I feel the need to do it all over.  I can&#x27;t stand chips or wear on the tips so if you aren&#x27;t as picky, you might get the full two weeks.</li>
    <li> I get compliments daily on my nails</li>
    <li> This is a color you want if your like the bright pinks that make your nails pop. Don&#x27;t get me wrong it&#x27;s not a neon, but a suttle, but bright pink that is very pretty.</li>
    <li> The color is hot and vibrant with a touch of pearl look. Definitely one of my favourites. Color in the picture reflects pretty close the true color.</li>
    <li> Perfect for summer nails and a great color. I have used this multiple times and love it more every time I use it.</li>
    <li> This shade is very pretty...i call it &amp;#34;barbie pink&amp;#34; its bright and has a hint of sparkle in it too, nothing against the product, but I realized I have WAY too many pinks in my polish arsenal....this is a great color for summer, however!</li>
    <li> love the color and love the product</li>
    <li> This color is great - but I wish the detail had mentioned that when applied the color is \\&quot;iridescent\\&quot;.  I get a lot of compliments on the color - but iridescent is not for me.  I am trying to \\&quot;get used to it\\&quot;....</li>
    <li> This one is my favorite color! Even the name is fun, use the new powders to get cool new colors.</li>
    <li> This may be my favorite color yet!  Not too bright.  Love the iridescent tint to it.  Beautiful pink for any time of the year!</li>
