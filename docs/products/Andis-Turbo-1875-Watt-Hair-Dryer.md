      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>I love this hair dryer.  </li>
      <li>Whenever I used my old hair dryer, my hair never looked that great</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and handle.</li>
      <li>It dries my hair very quickly, and leaves it smooth and shiny.</li>
      <li>was excited when I saw it on Amazon do cheap.</li>
      <li>I love it so much that I tell almost everyone</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t tangle her hair like all of the others and leaves it shiny &amp; full.</li>
      <li>cool shot button doesn&#x27;t work at all, maybe it is the one i received.</li>
      <li>Hands down, this is the ABSOLUTE BEST hair dryer I have ever used!!!!  </li>
      <li>Marriott courtyard furnishes their rooms with this dryer, doesn&#x27;t look too impressive to me, but I noticed how fast the light weight dryer blew my whole head of hair dry in 3 minutes!</li>
      <li>Hyatt furnishes their rooms with this dryer, doesn&#x27;t look too impressive, but I noticed how fast the light weight dryer blew my whole head of hair dry in 3 minutes!</li>
      <li>It drys my hair so quickly and is so inexpensive.  </li>
      <li>Product was out of the &amp;#34;Amazon Return Policy&amp;#34; but luckily customer service made a one time exception to allow it to be returned.  </li>
      <li>Luckily there is an 800 number on the box.</li>
      <li>Luckily, I paid with a credit card.</li>
      <li>Used one of these in a hotel a few years ago loved it so much I came straight home and ordered my own.</li>
      <li>I was looking for a powerful hair dryer and this did the job.  </li>
      <li>Exactly what I was hoping for... Dries my hair quickly</li>
      <li>Ordered it, received it quickly and the first time I used</li>
      <li>I returned it right away.</li>
      <li>It drys my hair super fast.  </li>
      <li>I loved this hair dryer when I first purchased it but after less than 3 months of use it overheats and turns off within 2 minutes.  </li>
      <li>there&#x27;s more of the same shipping charge.  </li>
      <li>I really like the powerful burst of air the Andis hairdryers have.</li>
      <li>I first used one at a Marriott Hotel.  </li>
      <li>The first one lasted 2 yrs.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s one week over the time to return it to amazon and even tho there is warranty on it to send it back is almost as much as another one and besides that if you don&#x27;t have an order of $35.00 or more</li>
      <li>It does dry much more quickly than my old dryer did, which saves me time when styling my hair.  </li>
      <li>I wish it had a cooler setting at full power, but it does dry your hair quickly.</li>
      <li>so much I bought it again.</li>
      <li>A real lemon.</li>
      <li>and I would have to flat iron it to smooth it out.      </li>
      <li>It then takes about 5 minutes of blowing into the end of it to cool it off before it will turn back on</li>
      <li>i must say if it wasnt for it shutting down, i&#x27;d buy more...</li>
      <li>This fit the bill perfectly, dry and go...</li>
      <li>This is a classic case of you get what you pay for.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t bother with this dryer - on European voltage, it&#x27;s super hot and burns your hair; on top of which it doesn&#x27;t work in the UK, or at least it didn&#x27;t for me; it wouldn&#x27;t turn on at all.</li>
      <li>Bought new.</li>
      <li>the first one went a while before it would quit in the middle of drying until it cooled off and then would start again.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s cheap, not worth my time to make a return.</li>
      <li>and wow what a difference it makes!</li>
      <li>and then would cool down and restart.</li>
      <li>had to blow into the nozzel to cool it down and reset the plug it took about 2mns to turn back on...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a little noisy, but worth it.</li>
      <li>My friend and I both thought it not only could dry our hair in just a few minutes (my old hair dryer took over 10 minutes to blow dry my hair), but it left our hair silky and smooth.  </li>
      <li>My daughter has shoulder length, really fine, really thin hair.</li>

<li> this dryer has a lot of power, was thrilled when i could dry my long thick, thick hair in under 15mns..</li>
<li> The on/off switch is almost completely flat.  </li>
<li> Not a happy buyer right now.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m on my second one in about a year and a half...</li>
<li> And I have fairly thick long hair that goes down to the middle of my back.</li>
<li> Plus the air that comes out is not hot, so I am not covered in sweat like all the rest of the dryers I&#x27;ve tried over the years.</li>
<li> This is different from other models of blow dryers I have used in the past, so it took some getting used to.  </li>
<li> I was puzzled to read some of the negative feedback on this hair dryer, because I have had a much different experience with it.  </li>
<li> I had used it on vaca a couple times and had to hunt it down to buy for my home.  </li>
<li> It drys my hair in half the time.</li>
<li> On the 4th time using it, even though treated tenderly and gently, some part inside came loose &amp; now it makes a horrible very loud noise of grinding metal when you turn it on.</li>
<li> Not worth it!</li>
<li> had the switch been a little easier to grip and maneuver.</li>
<li> Although it does have a few small bumps for traction, the switch is hard to slide if my hands are wet, which they usually are whenever I am in the process of styling my wet hair.  </li>
<li> After using this model of hair dryer in a hotel and seeing how quickly it dried my hair, I went home and ordered one for myself.  </li>
<li> I also was disappointed that it did not come with any attachments - luckily I didn&#x27;t buy them or I would be out that $ now.</li>
<li> I usually spend over 50.00 on a hair dryer from the beauty supply store.  </li>
<li> Unbelievable.</li>
<li> got disappointed when it wouldnt turn back on after i shut it off for about less than a min.</li>
<li> Ridiculous.</li>
<li> How ridiculous is that to order some as backups?  </li>
<li> I have very thick hair and</li>
<li> Got worse as the week wore on and at the end of the week, it wouldn&#x27;t even stay on.  </li>
<li> But if all you want is a dryer that blows hard and doesn&#x27;t overheat, buy this one!!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was staying at the Royal Pacific Hotel in Orlando Florida and they had these blow dryers in the rooms.  I&#x27;m so glad I was able to find this on Amazon!  I love it.  Great power</li>
    <li> Hyatt furnishes their rooms with this dryer, doesn&#x27;t look too impressive, but I noticed how fast the light weight dryer blew my whole head of hair dry in 3 minutes! And I have fairly thick long hair that goes down to the middle of my back. Plus the air that comes out is not hot, so I am not covered in sweat like all the rest of the dryers I&#x27;ve tried over the years. Excellent product as an excellent price!</li>
    <li> On the 4th time using it, even though treated tenderly and gently, some part inside came loose &amp; now it makes a horrible very loud noise of grinding metal when you turn it on. Only used it 4 times! Unbelievable.But what do you expect for 12.50 ?  Sadly, Amazon has a 1 month return policy. Luckily there is an 800 number on the box. I called &amp; left a message after hours at manufacturer office but they never called back. Sad. Guess I should not have waited a month or 2 to open this lemon. Luckily, I paid with a credit card. I should let Chase, who makes Amazon visa cards, fight it out with Amazon. Ridiculous. A real lemon. Bought new. Might as well have said &#x27;&#x27;toy&#x27;&#x27; if it tears up after 4 uses. Never buy an Andis brand anything ever again. Made in China, of course. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I was puzzled to read some of the negative feedback on this hair dryer, because I have had a much different experience with it.  Hands down, this is the ABSOLUTE BEST hair dryer I have ever used!!!!  I love it so much that I tell almost everyone I know about it and I ordered 10 more (some for my friends and some for me as \\&quot;backups\\&quot;).  How ridiculous is that to order some as backups?  That&#x27;s how much I love it!  I&#x27;m telling you...you won&#x27;t be disappointed.      I stayed at the Westin in Cancun recently and they had it in the room.  I tried to buy it when I was there, but they wouldn&#x27;t sell it, so I looked online and found it for $12.99 on Amazon.  My friend and I both thought it not only could dry our hair in just a few minutes (my old hair dryer took over 10 minutes to blow dry my hair), but it left our hair silky and smooth.  Whenever I used my old hair dryer, my hair never looked that great and I would have to flat iron it to smooth it out.      My friend and I laugh about this being a \\&quot;magical\\&quot; hair dryer, because I have never felt so great about my hair like I do when I use it.  A couple of my friends &amp; family members have used it, and they say the same thing!!!  I don&#x27;t have a Twitter account, but I have thought about opening one just to tell the world about how great this product is.  Definitely buy it!  It is awesome!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Product was used and scratched. Motor died within seconds of turning it on. Overheated and smelled like burnt batteries. The packaging wasn&#x27;t even all there. Not worth it!</li>
    <li> Do not buy this hair dryer.  This started smoking / burning smell while I was drying my hair.  It only lasted one week and now I can&#x27;t return it bc the return window has passed.</li>
    <li> Great value for the price, I needed something for company. This fit the bill perfectly, dry and go... Would recommend the buy...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my second one in about a year and a half... the first one went a while before it would quit in the middle of drying until it cooled off and then would start again. it finally just quit..  I like some of the features so well I ordered another..  This one lasted 5 weeks.  Same thing quit while drying and then would cool down and restart. Then one morning began to smell like it was burning inside and finally popped inside, smoked and quit forever.  It&#x27;s one week over the time to return it to amazon and even tho there is warranty on it to send it back is almost as much as another one and besides that if you don&#x27;t have an order of $35.00 or more there&#x27;s more of the same shipping charge.  once again, almost as much as half the price of the stupid dryer. I&#x27;m done with this product  and am disappointed there is no way to communicate with Amazon to get any resolution. Not a happy buyer right now.</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer.  I first used one at a Marriott Hotel.  It drys my hair super fast.  It is great.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was hoping for... Dries my hair quickly</li>
    <li> I was looking for a powerful hair dryer and this did the job.  I wish it had a cooler setting at full power, but it does dry your hair quickly.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t bother with this dryer - on European voltage, it&#x27;s super hot and burns your hair; on top of which it doesn&#x27;t work in the UK, or at least it didn&#x27;t for me; it wouldn&#x27;t turn on at all.</li>
    <li> The dryer worked great for the one time I got to use it. When I tried using it the second day it simply stopped working. The reset button didn&#x27;t reset it and it just never worked again.</li>
    <li> this dryer has a lot of power, was thrilled when i could dry my long thick, thick hair in under 15mns.. got disappointed when it wouldnt turn back on after i shut it off for about less than a min. and had only been using it for 10mns .. had to blow into the nozzel to cool it down and reset the plug it took about 2mns to turn back on... it is very light weight with lots of power... i must say if it wasnt for it shutting down, i&#x27;d buy more...</li>
    <li> I tried this blow dryer while staying at an Embassy Suitres Hotel and loved it&#x27;s power.  Went home, went on line, found it, bought it and I am thrilled with price, quality and power.  Great blow dryer.</li>
    <li> DRIES MY HAIR QUICK BEST BLOW DRYER EVER!</li>
    <li> Used this hairdryer at a hotel and fell in love.  Ordered it, received it quickly and the first time I used it was GREAT!  After that, it kept shutting off about 30-45 seconds into using it.  Got worse as the week wore on and at the end of the week, it wouldn&#x27;t even stay on.  Had to return it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and handle. Perfect.</li>
    <li> I ordered this hair dryer after I used it in a hotel.  It dries my hair very quickly, and leaves it smooth and shiny.</li>
    <li> I usually spend over 50.00 on a hair dryer from the beauty supply store.  Never again!  This dryer is awesome!  If you require attachments, look elsewhere.  But if all you want is a dryer that blows hard and doesn&#x27;t overheat, buy this one!!  I had used it on vaca a couple times and had to hunt it down to buy for my home.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I discovered this hair dryer at a hotel and loved how strong it was, so was excited when I saw it on Amazon do cheap. This is a classic case of you get what you pay for. Literally on the third use, it just stopped working. I returned it right away.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect hairdryer if you just need something simple. I really like the powerful burst of air the Andis hairdryers have.</li>
    <li> cool shot button doesn&#x27;t work at all, maybe it is the one i received. Good thing it&#x27;s cheap, not worth my time to make a return. The low heat setting is enough for me.</li>
    <li> I loved this hair dryer when I first purchased it but after less than 3 months of use it overheats and turns off within 2 minutes.  It then takes about 5 minutes of blowing into the end of it to cool it off before it will turn back on and then the same thing happens.  Product was out of the &amp;#34;Amazon Return Policy&amp;#34; but luckily customer service made a one time exception to allow it to be returned.  I will not be purchasing this product again.  I also was disappointed that it did not come with any attachments - luckily I didn&#x27;t buy them or I would be out that $ now.</li>
    <li> Used one of these in a hotel a few years ago loved it so much I came straight home and ordered my own. My daughter has shoulder length, really fine, really thin hair. I finally talked her into trying mine and wow what a difference it makes! It didn&#x27;t tangle her hair like all of the others and leaves it shiny &amp; full. I am back to order one for her now.</li>
    <li> I used this dryer at many Hyatt Hotels and decided I wanted one for home.  It drys my hair so quickly and is so inexpensive.  Love it!</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd time I have bought this hair dryer. The first one lasted 2 yrs. I like it so much I bought it again. I have very thick hair and this hair dryer does a wonderful job.</li>
    <li> Marriott courtyard furnishes their rooms with this dryer, doesn&#x27;t look too impressive to me, but I noticed how fast the light weight dryer blew my whole head of hair dry in 3 minutes! My husband notcie that too and we both love it.</li>
    <li> After using this model of hair dryer in a hotel and seeing how quickly it dried my hair, I went home and ordered one for myself.  It does dry much more quickly than my old dryer did, which saves me time when styling my hair.  The switch slides in one direction for &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; and the opposite direction for &amp;#34;low,&amp;#34; with the &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; position in the middle.  This is different from other models of blow dryers I have used in the past, so it took some getting used to.  There is no separate temperature control.  The on/off switch is almost completely flat.  Although it does have a few small bumps for traction, the switch is hard to slide if my hands are wet, which they usually are whenever I am in the process of styling my wet hair.  I would have given it 5 stars had the switch been a little easier to grip and maneuver.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this hairdryer!  It drys my hair in half the time. It&#x27;s a little noisy, but worth it. Like others, I used this brand in a hotel and had to have one.</li>
