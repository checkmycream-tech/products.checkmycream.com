<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I found it to be lacking in the ability to really clean my bottom. I now use it to rinse my bottom after a shower.</li>
    <li> BUT it leaks if you press to hard! So be careful! The wide mouth makes it easy to fill with water. Good Buy!</li>
    <li> Being Muslims cleaning myself with water is something I have to do. Not having anything built in I had to find something. This things works well. I dont think the pressure is too low. I think it is just right and Ive never had to add water, its the right amount.</li>
    <li> Ordered Wednesday night, received Saturday morning!  The packing box was taped neatly and squarely.  I&#x27;ve used it several times today and it is a GREAT product!  Works as advertised.  If you like to be clean and fresh, or conscious of the environment, get it!  I will buy another for myself and more for gifts.  U.S. stores should have something like this readily available.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, and it does exactly what it is designed to do with no mess at all.  It comes with a discreet carrying pouch and is small enough to slip into my purse so that I have my little \\&quot;mini\\&quot; shower at all times.  Great product!</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I&#x27;m from Egypt and I&#x27;m used to using bidet. I bought this product as a &#x27;temporary&#x27; solution till I get a permanent bidet. To my surprise, this bidet did the job and is very simple to use. I bought another one for my second bathroom and I&#x27;m intending to buy a permanent bidet. I LOVE this product.</li>
    <li> So simple. Hope it works</li>
    <li> Washmate works as well as having a bidet or bidet attachment without the high cost or leaking connections.  I had been depending on a toilet bidet attachment until I couldn&#x27;t stop a control valve leak.  Replacement would have been $200.    For $17 you get the same usefulness of getting clean with a bidet that you can use anywhere.</li>
    <li> This is a great little piece of equipment.  It does exactly what it is supposed to do and is quite easy to use and to pack.  Make sure the top is screwed on really really tightly before using - if not, only about 1/2 of the water comes out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy, but suffice it to say, if you want to clean some part of your body, you should use soap and water. Crazy idea here in the states, pretty much standard everywhere else in the \\&quot;civilized\\&quot; world.   This little bottle is spendy considering what it is (just a plastic bottle with an angled nozzle). But it works, and it&#x27;s a lot cheaper than buying a special toilet.</li>
    <li> I had a regular cleansing bottle I got from the hospital years ago from giving birth to my eldest son.  I love this better, it&#x27;s angled and I love putting hot water in it.  I feel much cleaner with this and as a woman, I use more toilet paper than my husband and boys...so this has significantly cut down that expense.  I&#x27;m think of placing this in all the bathrooms to cut down more on toilet paper expense (we have 3).  I give it four stars because I think the price should be lower, much lower.</li>
    <li> There is a metal plug on the bottom of the travel bidet bottle. It leaks water. You could never travel with water in the bottle and it leaks from filling it at the sink to using it at the toilet at home. I am returning it :(</li>
    <li> It holds about a cup and a half of water.   It&#x27;s perfect for travel or even just day to day not at home use.   A friend bought a portable bidet that was battery-powered and doesn&#x27;t hold as much water.   She was very disappointed.   This is a much better idea.</li>
    <li> Bought it for the hubby and he loves it. Great solution for a bidet without the hassle and cost of a more permanent installation.</li>
    <li> All indications are that this is useful for women. I am bothered by messy bowel movements abd I thought that this might solve my problem. It didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I bought this portable bidet to use at home, at first to get used to it. I have found that when it is full, you have to stand it on its side or it leaks. Consequently, to avoid leaking, you have to fill it immediately before using, and empty it completely during use. I would prefer to be able to fill it after using to be ready for the next use and to allow the water to come to room temperature, but because of the leak factor this is not possible. I have also used the Panasonic portable bidet, and that only lasted for about a month before it quit working altogether. I guess it&#x27;s back to the drawing board for me.</li>
    <li> This product is very useful and small enough to be discreet when used with the accompanying bag.</li>
    <li> I had been using a battery-powered bidet for hygienic cleansing on my travels.  It is made by a major manufacturer.  The battery-powered unit is fine, but it adds weight to my luggage, and, of course, it needs periodic battery replacement.  This Washmate Portable Travel Bidet turns out to be every bit as effective, and it weighs next-to-nothing and requires no batteries.  I used it on a recent cruise, and found that it does the job admirably--strong stream of cleansing water where you want it. I am a male, by the way.  Highly recommended for home or travel.</li>
    <li> this is perfect, my back is bad and I need help getting clean. you can take this with you cause its so small but it holds enough water to rinse really good.  the best part about this kind is you can go close or farther away from your bottom or wash off your private area too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d say that I&#x27;m an enthusiastic bidet convert. Smearing with toilet paper is just uncivilized. I&#x27;ve installed numerous Astor and Luxe bidets for family and friends, and I&#x27;d recommend the Luxe. However, I wanted a portable unit for when I&#x27;m traveling. This Washmate is okay, but the Lavette Bottle - Perineal Irrigation Bottle Model DYND70125H is $2.50 and more effective in my book. The upward spray of the Washmate is unnecessary. A lavette bottle closes tight and is easier to use.</li>
    <li> i got two more one for my daughter and one for my wife and it is so great ,squeeze it as you demand pressure, the higher the pressure needed the  harder the squeeze required, once my friends see it,it will be out of stock</li>
    <li> I bought this to clean our family on camp outs and it works great!!!</li>
    <li> It works and can be discretely carried in your purse.</li>
    <li> Love . Gets the job done . Do not travel without it</li>
    <li> Easy, affordable and does the trick.</li>
    <li> Maybe I&#x27;m doing it wrong; but it takes 3 bottles to clean; but it&#x27;s still better than the old TP way.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> Just had arm surgury, where reach is a real problem.  This little item is a real jem!!  It works as advertised and has made a painful recovery much easier with personal cleanliness.  A real personal problem solved an a way that truely works and is convienient and easy to use.  Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I bought this little portable bidet especially to take with me on a trip out of the country, and I could not be more pleased.  I had been looking for something portable, but other products I found were really not quite small enough to be carried in my purse, and were also expensive.  When I saw this product, I decided to try it because it is both small as well as affordable.  And, although small, it holds more than enough water to do a thorough cleansing with just a gentle squeeze of the bottle, and when warm water is available, that is an added bonus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always liked the concept of a bidet and this little gem stays discreetly tucked inside its own bag, in my purse, so that I can always be assured of feeling fresh and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not hesitate to recommend this product to anyone for work or for travel!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really like this.  The idea is great, but the execution kind of sucks. There is a little air hole thing at the bottom, which you have to put your finger on squarely. This is very difficult to do while also holding the bottle and then trying to invert it and get it into the correct position. I honestly don&#x27;t know how anyone does it.  The hole is just in an awkward place or my hands are too small or something.</li>
    <li> This was delivered a day early yesterday to my mail box.  After filling the blue bottle as full as I could get without any spilling out, I then poured it into a glass Pyrex measuring cup and this blue bottle holds exactly 11 ounces, not one ounce more; so one ounce less than one and one-half cups of water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using a few times, I find that I should have purchased at least two.  I still end up (no pun intended) using toilet paper and a wash cloth or small towel to clean up the water on toilet and my behind.  Never does any part touch your bottom but you can still spray clean the wand with bleach if you&#x27;re unsure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked to see if a \\&quot;large portable bidet\\&quot; was available and found none.  My water source is either in the bathtub in front of me, meaning I would have to get up and step over to tub to refill, or purchase two and have another on hand as the sinks are separated in another room/section of the bathroom.  The top with the squirt wand is well designed with five holes on each side of a very small plastic bar and perfect sending a good sprinkle stream of water that you control and the wand inverts to fit into the bottle itself and if you wish, you can keep it in the little nylon bag that comes with it to keep out of site.  With the nylon bag and the wand not fitting tight or closed, there is very little chance of mold developing if not used for a while.  Simply rinse it out before the next use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7-16-13:  I came back to Amazon and purchased another one today.  I like it.</li>
    <li> What you get for $17 is just a little plastic bottle with a spout to aim upward from below.  The stream is not strong enough to do much real cleaning.  I think a spray bottle from Dollar Tree would work as well if not better.  Update:  My spray bottle from Dollar Tree does work better - I tried it.</li>
    <li> I recommend this squeeze bottle to help in personal cleansing. It has come in handy since I suffered a shoulder injury and had limited use of my arm.  Also, you can&#x27;t buy this squeeze bottle in any drugstore which is too bad because it really does the job. Thank you Amazon.com for bringing so many useful products to the consumer. The squeeze bottle is made well and the design is very clever. It is very effective with the final clean-up. Also, the squeeze bottle is small enough that it can be packed in a purse for travel or office. I recommend this product as well as the seller who shipped it out very promptly.</li>
    <li> This is a great little item for anyone who suffers from loose bowels.  For years I&#x27;ve had to buy and carry moist towelettes for when my colitis flared up...but even then you still have the wiping action and \\&quot;did I get everything\\&quot; to aggravate already hurting tissue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NO MORE.  Though the bottle itself looks small, there is plenty of water for full rinsing/cleaning, and the nozzle is easily repositioned for full coverage of your bum.  This is a huge relief for irritated mucous membranes.  This will be going into my purse!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a metal &#x27;plug&#x27; in the base of the bottle; cover that with one finger to prevent spraying yourself with water while getting into position.  :)</li>
    <li> Bought this as a back-up/travel-bag one. Great as the first one. If you have issues with external hemorrhoids or other issues in this area, definitely worth the small price.</li>
    <li> I bought this portable bidet for traveling and I am very pleased with it. Not only is it very light-weight and discreet, I am able to control the amount of water pressure by how hard I squeeze the bottle. It does not take a lot of effort, and has great results.</li>
    <li> This required refills too often and the pressure depends on how hard your squeeze besides the fact that water sprayed all over.  Not worth it.</li>
    <li> This looks like its too small and won&#x27;t take care of all it&#x27;s supposed to, in fact my sister thinks that and won&#x27;t have one.  Oddly enough, it does take care of it all plus some. Another bonus about this bottle, I have issues getting up the stairs to take a shower, and sometimes have to take hospital-style pan baths. I put a little squirt of no rinse body bath at times.</li>
    <li> I guess you get what you pay for.  This product is barely good enough to wet your bottom, let alone for any real cleansing.  The bottle doesn&#x27;t hold enough water nor does it have enough \\&quot;squeeze power\\&quot; to do much good otherwise.  I don&#x27;t know what I expected, but that maybe the water pressure when one squeezed the bottle would be more substantial.</li>
    <li> Small enough to fit into a medium sized purse, but big enough to hold about two cups of water and do a good clean-up job. The body of this product is very soft rubber, and the nozzle comes off (to fill and to store), so both fit into a little water resistant draw-string bag. Very discrete.     Fill with water, aim, and squeeze. If more clean up needed, refill, and repeat.     This thing really is a great product and inexpensive.     I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> nice product and fast shipping</li>
    <li> I purchased this primarily because of the price.  I have always been curious about bidets, but since I grew up in the U.S. we have so little experience with them it was difficult to know what to expect.  I have been pleased with this so far, I try to keep it with me as much as I can and I find it useful in the office most of all since the paper we have here is pretty harsh.  Seems to do a decent job and it isn&#x27;t very complicated at all.  I think I will now graduate to a permanent one at my home, but this one will still be useful away from the house.</li>
    <li> It is embarrasing to order this product, talk about it ,and review it,but it is really good. My daughter and I have increased our comfort level and saved time and money by not buying so much toilet tissue. So easy to use..so good for the environment and budget. Must try.&lt;br /&gt;A great little secret..spread the word.</li>
    <li> very very very very very bad product</li>
    <li> This has a clever design with its curved spray head and air valve on the bottom.  It works good for what it is.</li>
    <li> I am happy to own this product as in the past when I traveled, I have had to improvise.  I wish all homes would install a bidet in their bathrooms.   I have always used a bidet and am at a loss when I go away from home.   The only fault I would find, is that I think the bottle should be a little larger as it would save having to refill.</li>
    <li> Funny Dirty Santa Gift for a Christmas party.</li>
    <li> It works so well, I&#x27;ve just ordered another one!    When it arrived, I was disappointed because it seems small.  But then I used it.  It gently but thoroughly cleans the entire area!  And it is so easy to use.  This would have been great after childbirth!    I&#x27;m a grandmother.  Severe outbreak of horrible pain in my arm and shoulder made \\&quot;wiping\\&quot; myself not possible.  I dared not \\&quot;have to go\\&quot; when out shopping, so I was severely limited in where I could go.    This little bidet bottle provides plenty of warm water to get the job done.  It is easy to squeeze because the plastic bottle itself is quite soft, yet the long angled tip is strong and easily reaches both back and front areas.    It is true that you have to fill it just before using it because it would leak.  But you can carry a small bottle of water with you, or do what I do: fill it at the sink in the public washroom before you enter the stall.    I am very pleased with it.  I have ordered another one so I can keep one at home and one ready to go in my purse.    Thanks for a lifesaver of a product!</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Excellent service!</li>
    <li> After surgery this bottle was quite handy when trying to wash my \\&quot;nether regions.\\&quot; I&#x27;ll even admit that it&#x27;s been useful for a quick clean up after a day at the beach, a workout etc.  The long stem makes it possible to reach areas that a regular squirt bottle couldn&#x27;t get to. It&#x27;s easy to squeeze and the body does not get slippery. Any woman could benefit from this tool.</li>
    <li> Easy to use does what its supposed to do. Best part no hoses to hook up. no worry about plumbing problems.</li>
    <li> It was quite by accident that I found that these things existed. I&#x27;m an American who never saw much in the way of bidets, but I had reservations about the models I saw for home use. Especially the ones that are part of the toilet seat with the jet right in the back. I don&#x27;t think that that would have worked well for me as it was.. errr... \\&quot;in the line of fire.\\&quot; On top of that most of the models approached $100 if not much more.    This thing is *EASY*!. Soft squishable rubber that will probably last for years and enough force in the little jets to do the job.    Yes it leaks a little. WHO CARES! You&#x27;re on the pot! Expect a slightly wet fanny and toilet seat. That being said it&#x27;s nothing a little toilet paper won&#x27;t handle. In that vein, overall you&#x27;ll be using MUCH LESS toilet paper and have a shower-clean butt. Not the \\&quot;wipe until you get tired of wiping and still have a crusty anus that burns with the left-over digestive enzymes your body cheerfully produces that specializes in digesting meat\\&quot; butt.     Good product. Inexpensive, and a great solution!    (AHhhhhhhh cool water.....)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a professional comedian and have traveled all over the world, and when it comes to toilets, I&#x27;ve seen everything, from the cup of water (disgusting, I&#x27;ll never use that), to garden hoses, to the fantastically advanced space age Japanese toilets and everything in between.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you think about it, it&#x27;s so backwards to use toilet paper, not really that much more sanitary than the cup of water. I was seriously considering getting a Japanese-style toilet with all of the nozzles and dryers and all that, but the problem is not only the expense but the cost of installation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally found this - this is amazing. This is probably one of the best products of any type I have ever used. I ordered it, and I have to tell you, I was extremely skeptical when I opened the box. But let me tell you something, this is freaking awesome. It provides all the benefits of the Japanese toilets, without any of the expense. Plus you can take it with you, which is wonderful - I carry it whenever I go on the road. It comes with a convenient pouch for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s totally sanitary - nothing ever touches any part of your body. I wish everyone would adopt it - it would truly be a revolution, and it would save something like 90 percent of toilet paper and help the environment immeasurably. I give it my most enthusiastic recommendation.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just what I need.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what you would expect from the picture. Impressively, it has the same type of jet stream as a real bidet. Perfect for the road. My wife and I use it when we travel. It&#x27;s nice that even on the road you don&#x27;t have to settle for toilet paper.</li>
    <li> After shoulder surgery...on dominant arm...had a little difficulty feeling really cleaned after toileting.  Doesn&#x27;t drip until you let go of the air release on the bottom...and holds plenty of water for a quick shower of the area...force of flow depends on how hard you squeeze the bottle.</li>
    <li> The Bidet works very well.  It holds enough water to provide cleaning (I use a moist wipe with a dab of liquid soap on it) then the Bidet to finnish the job.  After surgery the Bidet and my pillow were with me all the time, when I was not at home.  I cleaned them with soap and water, then rinsed with rubbing alcohol to help insure it was clean and dry.  I have a travel pack in my car with Clorox wipes, Toilet paper, moist wipes, hand wipes, liquid soap, Lysol spray and my Bidet, for anytime I am not at home.  I would recommend this to anyone who needs to stay clean, on wants to stay clean.</li>
    <li> When I can&#x27;t plumb in a real bidet, this little bottle serves the purpose very nicely. And much, much less expensive. I may get a second one, as this isn&#x27;t really enough water to wash thoroughly, though.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;This is great for what I bought it for. I got this for my grand daughter and boy! did she get a kick out of it. It definitely gives her little six year old area a clean feeling and save us rolls in toilet paper that she attempts to wet before using or handfull of wet wipes each time. The plastic is soft and easy for her to squeeze and she likes getting it ready with the &#x27;perfect&#x27; water temperature before she uses the Loo. CUTE! When she is done, it goes into the bag and she hangs it on a command hook I placed for her just close to the toilet paper hanger so its within her reach. She calls it her own Bidet since she is not allowed upstairs to use my own BB-3000 BIDET for safety.Thank you for such much needed and useful product. Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> love this little gadget for a truly clean feeling.  I only wish the bottle/container were slightly larger but I guess it is smaller to be portable.</li>
    <li> This thing isn&#x27;t as nice as a heated water bidet, but it does the job discreetly and with little noise or fuss.  Flexible plastic lets it squeeze into travel bags and suitcases well.  Haven&#x27;t had any problems keeping it clean and usable.</li>
    <li> Very nice product, easy to use, I feel so fresh and clean after using it every time, the water amount is good enough, highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This item is ok.....I wish the neck were a bit longer and it must be filled to the top in order to get any pressure from the nozzle. I can&#x27;t help but think it might be better to cough up the big bucks and purchase a real bidet,.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B001BYV3J6 Badimo Washmate Portable Handheld Bidet]]    While in Indonesia, I learned to appreciate a bidet.  At present, I am renting, and I did not want to do anything involving changing pipes, washers..., so I purchased this portable version.  I was so pleased with it, I bought another.  I keep one at the office, and one at home.  I travel by public transportation, and I don&#x27;t want to carry it back and forth.  I use wet-wipes in public facilities.  Bidets are refreshing, and a way to ensure personal hygiene.  I think when Americans learn more about them, it will become popular here in the USA as well.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive, simple, and it does the job. I did not grow up using a bidet but now I want a plumbed bidet installed in my bathroom. I feel so much cleaner. In addition, we had a problem with the sewer backing up this spring and were told by the plumber that old drain pipes like ours are prone to clogging if people use thick, cushiony toilet paper like Charmin or Cottonelle -- oops, that&#x27;s me. To avoid such problems, we were told to use single-ply paper that disintegrates quickly. The only way I can tolerate fast-disintegrating TP without using giant wads of the stuff is to use the bidet.</li>
    <li> Easy to use.  Beats spending hundreds of dollars on a built in bidet in one&#x27;s bathroom!  I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I purchased this a month ago, and I LOVE this thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a recent surgery, I had a drain sticking out of my left side and was instructed to avoid taking a shower until the drain was removed (6 days). My belly was so sore I couldn&#x27;t bend or turn anyway. How&#x27;s a girl supposed to stay clean? Enter this little beauty. Don&#x27;t worry about all the Japanese on the packaging and the pamphlet-you&#x27;ll instinctively figure out how to use it. It fits comfortably in one hand, and it holds more than enough water to clean you up very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The angled nozzle is what makes the bottle. The bottle itself is made of a plastic that is not only very flexible (easy to squeeze) but seems durable as well. It also comes with its own opaque Ziplock-type baggie to store the bottle in your gym bag. The bottle can be collapsed by unscrewing the nozzle and inverting the tip into the bottle. I think it&#x27;s a little cumbersome to put in a gym bag or purse; if you need it, though, you&#x27;ll be happy to have it handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may seem pricey for a plastic bottle, but it makes washing up at the commode SO EASY, especially if your abdominal mobility is jeopardized. This is super helpful!</li>
    <li> My anatomy must be different from everybody else&#x27;s. I used it properly several times from different angles and got the full force of all the water each time, but it just didn&#x27;t do the job for me. I tried this one and also the Lavette Perineal Irrigation Bottle - same results. Won&#x27;t be using either.</li>
    <li> Product is great. It was a blessing. With my back problems I can be more independent and able to take care of my own needs.</li>
    <li> In a lot of Muslim countries, rinse themselves after using restrooms. This habit is however, not completely religious. It is cultural, even non-Muslims who live in these countries do the same because it is a very good habit for hygiene reasons. However, when living and traveling in non-Muslim countries, it becomes impossible. A couple of years ago, I found this portable bidet and that was the solution. It is lightweight, very durable, and easy to use. I have been carrying it everywhere and I still have it. This is the second set I&#x27;m buying to leave it at my work place. If you have been familiar with the use of water in restroom, this is the best. if not, you can give it a try using this bidet as it is very cheap and not a big waste of money if you don&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> I had been thinking about installing one of those do-it-yourself bidets in each of my bathrooms, but I travel around a lot, and move rather frequently, so the job just kept getting put off.  Well, I had no idea they made inexpensive portable ones small enough to carry in a suitcase.  This one even came with a cute little carrying case.  Just fill it with warm water and you get to be clean.  I love it.</li>
    <li> We were looking for a good bidet in a bottle for our daily use and were hoping we had found the perfect solution.  The stream is weak at best.  Water leaks all over the place and makes a giant mess.  A regular solution bottle works better.</li>
    <li> I use this only at home.  Bottle holds sufficient amount of water to get oneself clean without having to refill.  Bottle squeezes easily to provide the pressure necessary to dispense the water.  I take it apart after using so it can air-dry.</li>
    <li> This is convenient, easy to use and great for both home and travel. Well worth the cost and works very well.</li>
    <li> it works, not very exciting to write about.  I could go into details but no one really wants to read that.  So, yes I would order it again.</li>
    <li> Someday when I make it big I&#x27;ll have a bathroom with its own bidet.  But, until then...there&#x27;s this ingenious and simple way to keep my bottom happy!  People have left negative comments on how it \\&quot;leaks.\\&quot;  If you read the directions, you should not have this problem, at least not after a little trial and error.  I&#x27;ve been using mine for almost a month and think its great!</li>
    <li> Was very useful with the bottom buddy stem could have been a little longer in reach. All in all diring my injury it served it&#x27;s purpose.&lt;br /&gt;If needed I will use again. No Butt&#x27;s about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joseph</li>
    <li> Used it for first week and a half back from hospital.  I healed quickly, others might use for longer.  Totally worth it as the flow from squirt bottle could not be easily directed.  I do wish it didn&#x27;t leak from the lid, but it&#x27;s still better than squirt bottle.</li>
    <li> its very small you&#x27;ll need to keep refilling it with water.</li>
    <li> bought this with the hope of cutting down &amp;#34;cleaning&amp;#34; time. multiple trips to refill. concept is promising but its ineffective with a small bottle, might try the inline model, but these are unfortunately a no go.</li>
    <li> Just doesn&#x27;t work. Not enough water or force&lt;br /&gt;It was $10.00 so I gave it a try. Used it once.</li>
    <li> I love this!  I like feeling fresh and clean.  I wish I had grown up using a bidet.  Better late than never.</li>
    <li> Why doesn&#x27;t the US adopt the European custom of the bidet. I&#x27;m guessing the paper industry must have very strong lobbyists.</li>
    <li> The need for a product like this is usually due to a special need that is of a delicate and personal nature.  The Washmate gave me the freedom to be able to attend work without worrying about the need to return home to &amp;#34;take care of business&amp;#34;.  In addition to the cap and bottle, there is a nylon bag for carrying everything unobtrusively. Keep in mind, though, it is essentially a squirt bottle so it isn&#x27;t as quiet as you might hope, but I think it is great.&lt;br /&gt;If wiping is painful due to surgery, hemorrhoids, fistulas, yeast infections, or if you just like feeling a little cleaner but don&#x27;t have the time or means to take a full shower, this is a great alternative.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s perfect but it&#x27;s too small try to make it bigger or taller anything but try to make the watcher anything very much</li>
    <li> Product arrived one day late. However, it does what is is suppose to do. Fill it with warm water and let it do it&#x27;s job.</li>
    <li> This product works okay, but stopped working after I had it awhile.</li>
    <li> Purchased this before our more permanent bidet.  Worked well for travelling.</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t felt this fresh and clean in years.  Carry mine in a drawstring bag in my purse.  Taking a tip of another reviewer, I actually always carry a little bottle of water with me.  I bought one of those &amp;#34;mini&amp;#34; bottles of ozarka etc. and carry it in the drawstring bag.  I can fill up the bottle in the privacy of the stall, and then just refill the bottle in the sink as I leave so it&#x27;s ready for next time.  it&#x27;s the perfect volume.  Seriously changed my life!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Completely useless. Too small, difficult to hold and a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;You might want to save it to water bonsai plants.</li>
    <li> As a portable bidet it works far better than my expensive, battery-powered one.  My battery one only delivers a small, weak stream.  But the Washmate allows you to squeeze out a powerful volume of water.  Plus it&#x27;s much lighter than my electric model.  My first experience with this bidet was less than satisfactory because I only tried about half the bottle.  I found using a full bottle much better for me.  That allows me to deliver several full &amp;#34;blasts&amp;#34;.  Even then, it was still gentle enough not to cause irritation.  FYI, I have an actual bidet in my home, and this works almost as well.</li>
    <li> This product will work, but not perfectly.  I fill it twice and use it on my butt when my back hurts due to back surgery.  It cleans pretty well, but not perfectly.  If a person used toilet paper with it and this to finish the job, it may work well, but for me, it just didn&#x27;t cut the &amp;#34;bidet&amp;#34; standard. I&#x27;m a big guy.  Maybe no product would be big enough for me?????  I&#x27;m glad I have the product.  I wouldn&#x27;t trade it, but it doesn&#x27;t quite get the job done for me.</li>
    <li> The angle of the tip makes it hard to use.  I just wanted it for outside cleaning, as it&#x27;s not a good idea to douche and disturb the natural balance in the vagina.  A flexible and  longer tube might help.</li>
    <li> I like this  until I found the bottle with the longer nozzle. This one comes up too short. Not as good as the longer ones.</li>
    <li> I have used this for travel and it&#x27;s great. I AM MALE AND HAVE A BIDET IN MY HOME AND WOULD NOT BE WITHOUT EITHER ONE.</li>
    <li> This is a good product, works as described. If you have bladder problems this is a great help.  Will be ordering more</li>
    <li> It looks exactly like what i want, but it has a very week sprinkle and does not do what it is supposed to do.&lt;br /&gt;Sorry.</li>
    <li> This portable bidet will allow a person with limited arm reach to clean her/himself while sitting on the commode. The plastic bottle is large enough, the curve on the dispenser allows for the water to reach the area you are wanting to clean.</li>
    <li> I had another batt. powered bidet that pumped water through a small tube, but this one has more pressure and is so easy to carry, use, and keep clean / about 3 squeezes empties the canister /&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it for a while and have no complaints, only praise !!!</li>
    <li> This little bottle works like a charm for quick wash ups.  Great for freshening up on quick stops to the restroom while traveling too.  A few drops of body wash shaken together with the water makes a nice freshener.</li>
    <li> This is a cool item if you&#x27;re interested in a portable bidet without paying out the \\&quot;bum\\&quot;. Seriously though, I was fascinated with other options as to cleanliness and in general just trying not to \\&quot;re-aggro\\&quot; my rear end everyday, as paper was beginning to do to me. This practically priced, modestly sized item makes it easier to deal with and makes me feel fresh, clean and \\&quot;aggro\\&quot; free. I would definately recommend this item for anyone with an interest in a bidet - especially if a first time user, as it won&#x27;t break your bank.</li>
    <li> Have sensitivity issues. Bought two of these. Use them both for refreshing relief. Cannot live without them now. Seller is excellent. Would buy from them again.</li>
    <li> My wife is so used to a bidet or at least a bidet shower.  She feels cleaner washing.  Most countries don&#x27;t have a bidet shower.  When we travel, i bring this along.  Fill it up, use it and then pack it back in.  It has just enough water.  Nothing to breakdown.  How easy is that?</li>
    <li> I have been using this bidet at home everyday for several weeks now. You can be clean with less noise or mess caused by squeezing the bottle, the plastic bottle is flexible and there&#x27;s a valve in the bottom of the bottle to let the air flow to push the water when you squeeze it. Small enough to carry with you inside its bag but can contain enough water to keep you clean. I like this product and might get another one to use it in the office too.</li>
    <li> seems cheap havent dared to use it</li>
    <li> Use this on camping trips when showers are few and far between. I would recommend it for any travel situation.</li>
    <li> IT IS NOT A DEPENDABLE PRODUCT. LEAKS NO MATTER HOW HARD YOU PUT YOUR FINGER OVER THE HOLE.  BUY THE LAVETTE BOTTLE INSTEAD.</li>
    <li> The idea never appealed to me but I decided to give it a try and this is such a good product, which I had this years ago.</li>
    <li> I had one of these last year but it broke at the screw cap.  I hope this lasts better.  Essential for places where there is no toilet paper.</li>
    <li> got the job done! no leaking. easy to use until my hand surgery was performed. I would recommend this item.</li>
    <li> If you are used to using a bidet at home you&#x27;ll be a little disappointed with this one.  It&#x27;s not as efficient because the spray is not as intent as your home model.  Also, it seems that $17.00 is a bit pricey for nothing more than a plastic spray bottle from Japan.  Just buy a squeeze bottle at Walmart---you&#x27;ll have the same thing &amp; you&#x27;ll save a few bucks.</li>
    <li> Useful for females.  Rather expensive but might be enticing if offered for $20.00 for two. One can be used by the buyer and the other a gift to a relative or friend.</li>
    <li> This worked OK. I had surgery on hands and found this did help with cleaning. The plastic bottle is thin which actually makes it easier to squeeze.</li>
    <li> Have only had a few days, but this is just what I have been looking for.  Easy to hold, tip is angled just right, even though my hands are arthritic the Graf product is easy to squeeze.</li>
    <li> Use less toilet paper and stay fresh! Should&#x27;ve purchased long a go.  1 for home use &amp; one on the go</li>
    <li> This is a very useful, well-designed product for keeping our nether regions clean!  We keep it full and handy, then refill after use.  It never leaks.</li>
    <li> Cool idea but it doesn&#x27;t hold enough water.</li>
    <li> My friend wanted a bidet. I bought her this for hundreds less. Did it as a joke at first but she says she loves it more than a bidet because it is portable. Thanks</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great. But it drips a little when you hold it back upright. because there&#x27;s a hole on it for air to go through it , that&#x27;s the only thing I don&#x27;t like about it.</li>
    <li> This is a simple way to bring a bidet with you when you travel.  It&#x27;s not as good as a real bidet installed on the toilet, but it beats having your sensitive rear sandpapered by the terrible toilet papers that hotels provide.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think the idea of using a portable bidet will ever catch on in America.  We like our toilet paper.</li>
    <li> great travel washer or for all those locations that don&#x27;t have one handy&lt;br /&gt;works perfectly for all your hygiene needs and easy to carry (with pouch)</li>
    <li> my husband uses this for travel and its very useful . He has radiation burns on his bottom and it cleans a lot better than toilet paper.He uses the Luxe Bidet MB110 at home also . I hope this review helps others that go through radiation on that part of the body</li>
    <li> easy to store in the car emergency bag...you know with all the sunglasses, Kleenex etc.?  Easy to use, easy to keep you and it clean.  Just do it...what is the worse that could happen?  A clean butt or stinky TP?   Dry off &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; water with paper towel or cloth</li>
    <li> Take care of hygiene in a quick an convenient way....especially on trip, boat, or camping.  Nice gift.  Lightweight.</li>
    <li> I really, REALLY wanted to love this.  Looks like it would be great, but it LEAKS.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to keep it and just use it at home.  I just deal with the leaking.&lt;br /&gt;Would not use it if I were dressed up and did not want to drip water on my clothes.</li>
    <li> It was smaller than I thought</li>
    <li> This product is simple and easy to use and makes staying clean very easy.  It is good value for the dollar.</li>
    <li> I wanted a bidet but was not sure if it was really for me so tried this product. Loved it. I felt so much cleaner. This product was my answer to how to make family clothes work for me. Will never be without one. I was concerned about leaking but did not have that issue at all. This product was worth it for me.</li>
    <li> Poor design -- the air-hole is placed at the bottom of the reservoir jar, but in use, you have to hold the jar in the middle to squeeze it, while somehow managing to keep a finger over the air-hole.  A physical impossibility.  So aside from struggling with this item, you will have water in many places where it was not intended.  I would suggest taping over the air-hole, and let it breathe through the spray holes..</li>
    <li> I bought this product 6 months ago. This is really use full for hygiene wash. I use it when I am at work(ofcourse using toilet at work), also really use full when I go for outdoor activities. I like the carrying case and it is really handy.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold enough water, and doesn&#x27;t generate enough water pressure, to be useful for me.  I&#x27;ve given up on it.</li>
    <li> My arm just does not reach far enough to be able to tend to the necessary duty of wiping anymore......    My youngest daughter had been staying with me as I recovered from breast-reduction surgery and was wiping me.    She has gone home now and I was having to \\&quot;hold\\&quot; till she came by each day to change my dressing.  \\&quot;Well, this has got to stop.\\&quot;  So, went searching on Google for an answer to my plight.    Found this \\&quot;portable Bidet\\&quot; at Amazon....      O M G ! !  What a blessing.  Length of tube just  the right length to make me \\&quot;clean as a whistle\\&quot;  :)  And with warm water, aaaaahhhhh.    Strongly recommend this item for anyone having this problem, and being female, it works for front also.......[[ASIN:B001BYV3J6 Washmate Portable Bidet in a Bottle (300 ml)]]</li>
    <li> Are you a man?  A woman?  Do you use the toilet?  This item is for you.  I really love this bidet more than I thought I would.&lt;br /&gt;Because of a serious back injury and osteoarthritis, it is increasingly difficult for me to bend and twist.  I thought this bidet would be nice to have - just in case.  Well, I tried it out to see what it would be like and now I am hooked.  It is a great feeling to be &amp;#34;just out of the shower&amp;#34; fresh.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I wanted to find a bidet in bottle form and this is perfect&lt;br /&gt;for my needs.&lt;br /&gt;No batteries to replace, nothing to wear out...&lt;br /&gt;Simple solutions are the best.</li>
    <li> I travel a great deal and find myself on long plane rides and in many third world nations. This product is handy, discreet, and easy to use. It is well designed and made. I always carry it in my hand carry bag when traveling now. It certainly beats the battery operated portable bidets. So simple and convenient. Thumbs up.</li>
    <li> Works well and does what it is supposed to do. What more is there that can I say about it?</li>
    <li> It does the job,just what I was looking for.I wish it was bigger,you get four to five good shots.It work for me.</li>
    <li> I found this product to be exactly what stated. Filled with warm water,it is prefect to refresh for people who-lets just say it -cant reach for some reason or another.Filling it twice is even better,more then enough to wet,wash and rinse.If it was any bigger it would be to hard to hold and too heavy,so to me,its worth the effort to refill. It even came with a handy decreet carry bag to carry in a tote.</li>
    <li> love it. use it everyday in the office.</li>
    <li> Works as it should. It&#x27;s a reasonable substitute when a real bidet is not available. II continue with usual hygiene and use the portable bidet at the end.  It certainly assists with hygiene.  NOTE:  be sure to have your finger covering the metal spot on the bottom before you tip it upside-down,</li>
    <li> This product performed as described and has been very useful when traveling.</li>
    <li> Since purchasing this product, I use it daily. I also have taken it with me on trips. Now that I have one, I would not be without it. It&#x27;s cut down on paper usage. It has also helped heal and prevent further irritation. I think it&#x27;s such a great product that I purchased one for each of my daughters.</li>
    <li> After reading other reviews, I&#x27;m assuming I received a defective Bidet.  The bottle lid leaks, even when not in use.  The \\&quot;spray\\&quot; end leaks.  The first time I used it, most of the water leaked on the floor.  The second time I put water in it, I set it on the counter and it leaked standing upright, soaking papers I had on the counter.  I know I cannot return a product such as this, but I would not recommend it with the experience I had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;J. Michaels</li>
    <li> excellent!! just what i expected. fast shipping. thank you</li>
    <li> the flow of the washer is good the problem is with the volume of the bottle as it is very small so it should be filled at least twice inorder to get a good result</li>
    <li> Difficult to use when turning and angle are an issue.</li>
    <li> It leaks. so it&#x27;s useless and defeats its purpose. A hair color applicator bottle would probably accomplish the same purpose.</li>
    <li> THIS IS A GREAT HYGIEN PRODUCT  RAELLY EASY TO USE AND CLEAN !&lt;br /&gt;GAVE AS GIFTS TO GIRLFRIENDS  . THIS IS A GREAT RAVEL ADJUNCT</li>
    <li> I have been using a battery operated Toto portable washlet till recently. By cpmparison this washlet is much lighter and a lot less complicated. The squeeze action provides the same steam of water as the batery operated. If I had one improvement wish, I would like to see a slightly larger bottle capacity. Otherwise I am very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this bidet quite a while ago, i loved it so much that i am ordering my second one , one for home and one for on the go in the purse , I am allergic to bathroom tissues, even the best ones , and this has helped me a great deal. it hold enough water to do the job and the bottle is very good quality silicon so squeezes easily , i thought about just getting a water bottle but regular water bottles are not soft enough to squeeze a steady stream of water like this one dose, plus the bent nasal direct the water just right, specially good for large size person , get it you will love it.&lt;br /&gt;Up  date :I have some of my friends to get this , and they are happy too.</li>
    <li> this product is very helpful in personel cleaning. And it is portable when needed.I am glad i got it. m</li>
    <li> Product leaks a little, but I can manage. Perfect for people with mobility problems. Size is perfect for traveling, can carry it in your handbag, is has a carry bag.</li>
    <li> Thick, quality paper towel with warm water is better to use as a wipe to gently freshen up. Feminine wipes are too fragranced and chemically for my tastes. Even the sensitive and unscented kinds.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product and intend to buy a couple more.  Please read carefully about the product before purchasing because it may or may not suit your needs.  I keep this bottle empty and sitting on a shelf between the sink and the toilet. I fill it up on an &amp;#34;as-needed&amp;#34; basis with cold or warm water.  The bottle is soft and squeezes water out very easily, the nozzle is long enough to reach from the front to any area needing rinsed, and is also angled properly.  With the bottle full to the top, there is plenty of water to cleanse well.  You can adjust how hard the water comes out by how hard you squeeze the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note:  There is a metal hole with a metal ball in the bottom of the bottle to allow for air flow when it is upside down.  I would never keep water in this when not in use, and never travel with water in it.  If you take it someplace, be sure to fill it up before going into a bathroom stall.  There is a nice carry pouch, but you have to take the lid off and tuck it down inside the bottle to fit it inside all the way.  Don&#x27;t assume the pouch will keep the water in the bottle or keep it from dripping, it isn&#x27;t designed for that.  Also, there is a plastic ring (washer) inside the lid, don&#x27;t lose it...it doesn&#x27;t work well without it.  You will need to take the ring out and wash it...how often depends on the quality of water you are using in the bottle.</li>
    <li> I purchased this portable bidet as I have always enjoyed the ones in Europe.  Not sure why we here in the US never introduced bidets as part of the standard practices when building bathrooms.  Anyway,  I had already purchased a similar product from Amazon at a much higher price from a different maker.  It worked very well and I took it on my trip to Canada.  However,  I left it with my family there since they really liked it.  So after coming back home,  I went to buy another one.  They were sold out of the one that I had purchased before my trip.  But then I found this one.  It was cheaper and looked exactly the same.  It arrived promptly and I have been using it for about 2 weeks now.  I like it just as much as the other one and it works great.  The leaking that people are speaking of is there is a little metal \\&quot;button\\&quot; on the bottom that is there to allow the flow of the water when you turn it upside down to use it.  The leak comes not when you are sitting it down initially, but AFTER you use it and the button moves a little to allow the free flow of the water!  Then when you turn it back upside down (depending on how quickly you turn it right side up),  a little water will get on the bottom.  But while it is sitting down between uses,  it does not leak.  The reason I know this is that I tested it before I used it the first time.  So,  I am getting ready to purchase another one today.  I highly, highly, recommend this product.  (PS:  In fact I may by 2 more - 1 as a backup)  Thanks!</li>
    <li> It works well-what can I say? It serves the purpose when traveling.</li>
    <li> Okay, but as soon as you turn it upside down to use it, it squirts all over the place and soaks your clothes and the floor.  It would be better if it held in the water better until one is ready to use it.</li>
    <li> The water container is too small and not convenient at all to clean. The head is confusing as the part in the middle is useless, they should get rid of it and make the shower head a little smaller to provide more pressure.</li>
    <li> As a Concept and Effectiveness &amp;#34;YES its the right choice in the critical moments&amp;#34;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;for future i wish if the factory give it more time to think how it can make it easier for carrying, I am sure you can come out with a new edition it can be tied or something better than the bottle maybe like the thick balloon or something like that!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far its my new friend now :)</li>
    <li> This product is a good idea, but that&#x27;s as far as it goes.  The screw top detaches and comes off and falls into the toilet when you put even the least amount of pressure on the bottle to push water out the spigot.  No amount of tightening the cap works.</li>
    <li> This item gets the job down. I like the fact that it has a carry case and it gives the water enough pressure to clean all areas that need cleaner.</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking that it might not work, but it really is pretty darn good. First, it reduces the quantity of TP used. Second, it feels fresher.</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t be beat for the price ,great for travel for anyone with hemorrhoids.&lt;br /&gt;or for a bathroom without a bidet . the only reason for not giving five&lt;br /&gt;stars is the awkward placement of the air valve on the bottom ,and&lt;br /&gt;the way you have to put a finger over it when first turning it over.</li>
    <li> Best idea for me since I live in an apartment and cannot change the plumbing around. Besides, it&#x27;s portable and can go with me wherever I go on a daily basis if I choose. It&#x27;s handy and always leaves me with a just washed feeling. I just love this item.</li>
    <li> Just right for travel or home.  Especially handy is the carrying case.  I will order another.</li>
    <li> What a godsend! I&#x27;m elderly and somewhat obese and have fibromyalgia so I have trouble reaching where needed to be clean. This works for me. For a long time I have wished for a bidet in the bathroom but since i rent that has not been feasible. Voila! I now have a bidet that I can take anywhere not just in my own bathroom. It consists of a soft, flexible bottle with a screw on cap that has an elongated spout that is bent at the tip, just as shown in the picture. The bottle is easy to squeeze. It seems to be well made and (hopefully) durable. However, if for some reason I need another, the price is reasonably low. One of the best purchases I have ever made. Thank you Giraf!</li>
    <li> Physical limitations brought on by too many rodeos have caused me to seek alternate methods of performing some of the most mundane tasks. For a while I was even enlisting the aid of my devoted life partner to perform what this Washmate Portable Bidet in a Bottle allows me to do in private, as the Good Lord intended I&#x27;m sure. But bless her heart anyway. Thank you dear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found a feeling of complete rearward cleanliness to arrive usually after 3 fillings of the bottle. So before I begin the elimination, I make sure that there is a faucet or some bottled water within arm&#x27;s reach. Even with my arthritic wrist and fingers I don&#x27;t find it difficult to squeeze the bottle sufficient for a powerful and accurate jet of water. Afterward, a drip-dry session of a minute or two is all that&#x27;s needed before I re-emerge into the world no one the wiser for what all that water gushing noise in the stall was. I mean what the heck... worse noises do come from public restroom stalls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product description says, \\&quot;Washmate also comes with an attractive pouch. You can discreetly walk down the hallway with it\\&quot;. Since the Washmate logo is prominently printed on the bag, I&#x27;m not sure how true that statement is. I can envision the pouch even evoking unwanted hallway conversation enroute to the privy. I threw the pouch away and carry the Washmate in a plastic Piggly Wiggly bag along with a bottle of Dasani for the sake of  surreptitiousness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before discovering this product I was a proponent of Self-Wipe Bathroom Toilet Aid, also available from Amazon. I promise you that the Washmate Portable Bidet in a Bottle, with just a little preparation, is easier and cleaner.</li>
    <li> Soothing and less irritating than dry toilet paper.  Portable and discreet in it&#x27;s carry bag .&lt;br /&gt;One for each bathroom.  Little valve on the bottom lets in air so the spray isn&#x27;t slowed down.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a handy device every traveler like me should have.</li>
    <li> After reading some of the negative reviews on this I had to try to help. This is the best travel bidet I have ever used. The battery powered ones I&#x27;ve tried have all been anemic at best. I&#x27;m not sure people know how to use it properly and hence the negatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First.  It&#x27;s not meant to hold water during traveling. You leave it in its carry case and fill it in the restroom before using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second.  It has a small valve on the bottom to allow air into the bidet to replace the water you squeeze out. This is necessary and yes it does leak slightly till you put the top on, then it stops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some advice.  After using mine for awhile I got to learn a trick or two. It&#x27;s best to use short firm squeezes rather than trying to slowly squeeze out the contents in one long squeeze. This way you get 4-5 good strong sprays and u should be good and clean after that. This is my second one ( I lost the first one at Disneyland ). I may order another just so I have a spare. This really is a life saver when I&#x27;m away from home.</li>
    <li> At certain times of the month a bidet would be so helpful,  but that&#x27;s more space and money than I have.  I bought this on a whim,  but am very glad I did,  it leaves me feeling far fresher and cleaner than I thought it would,  it&#x27;s incredibly easy to use and I found no leakage problems.  I don&#x27;t travel with it,  but for home use it&#x27;s excellent and I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Living in Asia for years and with some old hemorrhoids, I am very used to and rely on a bidet at home and elsewhere. Bought this to help in other locations and it is pretty good. Easy to use, easy bring along, and much better than nothing.  Only wish the water came in more of a stream and less of a spray.  However, I am getting another.</li>
    <li> Handy product, but the air valve to keep water from spilling when inverting it for use is a little tricky. I need two hands to manipulate it. Also, watch the clear silicon gasket inside threaded cap. It has a tendency to fall out...un-noticed in sink. Warm water and portability are nice features. Beats installed sprayers that are always cold.</li>
    <li> This is a extremely handy little item. Easy to use, easy to use for traveling; it will be a great addition to the camping gear!</li>
    <li> If you are prone to a sore tush, this thing is gonna be your new best friend. If toilet paper or even wipes are too painful, use this and you will be super clean. Just dab with TP when you&#x27;re done to dry off.</li>
    <li> When I bought this I also bought two other models of these traveling units. This one fails because the lid doesn&#x27;t fit anything else. The 3 star I wish could be 3½). Works fine, but it&#x27;s not a large enough capacity, and it&#x27;s purple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the others I&#x27;ve bought slides into the mouth of a standard drinking water bottle, and also many soda bottles making it more flexible, and publicly friendly for a guy to carry around. The tip fits in my pocket, and the bottle of water isn&#x27;t so medical looking. The other screw on type has a lid which fits many small thin soda bottles (the tall thin 16.9oz size bottles). Again, friendly for public use, and the tip disperses a better pattern than this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downfalls of this unit for me was the bottle is smaller capacity, and the lid not fitting other bottles means you have to carry around a purple bottle everywhere. I&#x27;m a man with no purse, so the purple bottle at restaurants, museums etc is out.</li>
    <li> very small a doesn&#x27;t look like it will work with heavier person</li>
    <li> Does an excellent job of cleaning.  Some water squeaks out but does the job!  I am very pleased with this!</li>
    <li> Very useful during travel. Saves bottom from chaff and itch. Keeps one feeling clean all day.&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t regret this purchase.</li>
    <li> As a muslim , water is mandatory for cleaning up after going to the bathroom. And since im studying in the US they don&#x27;t have water next to the toilet. So I searched the web and this product is exactly what i need.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> love this item  when I am sore this does the job it cleans very well and helps me  to stay cleaner</li>
    <li> When you turn the bottle upside down to use it, water leaks out all around the cap.  Buy a squirt bottle instead.</li>
    <li> As an American expat living is SE Asia I had grown accustomed to the bidets that are in evidence everywhere for hygienic purposes. This product imitates such bidets quite effectively. Recommended.</li>
    <li> Would recommend if one is searching for this product.  I use it and it is a good substitute for proper bidet</li>
    <li> This thing is my all time favorite purchase. I love the extra comfort and cleanliness that this little bottle provides. Buy it, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> Nothing bad to say about this little gem, just love it, and it&#x27;s just so easy to use. Wish that I had bought more than just one. Makes me feel squeaky clean.</li>
    <li> Works great! The nozzle is long enough that it has a good reach for cleaning.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure glad I have this thing. Works as advertised. Plenty of water comes out of it to do the job. If you&#x27;re expecting a roman fountain type of stream then you should reset your expectations. But for having something on the road... it&#x27;s a godsend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it leak a little when you&#x27;re squeezing it? sure, but it&#x27;s over the toilet at that point so it really doesn&#x27;t matter.</li>
    <li> Great product. Plastic bottle is so easy to squeeze, not a hard plastic like most bottles. Great to take along on a trip.</li>
    <li> I researched this item on various sites and then decided to purchase it at Amazon because it had the best reviews, features and price.  Especially with Prime Shipping included it was totally reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bidet itself is a blessing in disguise.  I had no idea it would allow me to feel that clean and refreshed.  I was initially concerned that the flow of the water wouldn&#x27;t be sufficient enough but it is strong enough and accomplishes the task very well.  I would never be without one now that I have experienced this.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Works very well, recommend it</li>
    <li> I bought this to help cleanse after I had a baby. It did the job perfectly, and I will be making this purchase for all of my friends if and when they have babies.</li>
    <li> I like it so much and I think it&#x27;s a very useful however, I wish if it was 400ml instead of 300ml</li>
    <li> A reviewer writes &amp;#34; so it leaks a little, so what&amp;#34;. No, it leaks a lot!  By the sink.And over your clothes as you get to the toilet.  The&amp;#34;washer&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t prevent the water from leaking because it&#x27;s what stops the the bottle from leaking. I regret not reading the reviews. Sadly, the product has great potential if smartly engineered.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think it was that bad originally, but here I am still using it (I need something) with water everywhere.  I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s gotten worse or I&#x27;m less tolerant.  It&#x27;s a mess.  I wish I knew how others don&#x27;t have the same problem.  So, I&#x27;m continuing my search for something better that doesn&#x27;t require a bathroom remodel....</li>
    <li> Just my opinion, but this item won&#x27;t wash anything. The stream of water is too weak to wash someone&#x27;s butt, it may get it wet but getting it clean I don&#x27;t think so. Also it has a tendency to dribble even when your finger or thumb is over the hole which to me is aggravating. I agree with another poster who said a spray bottle would do a better job.</li>
    <li> I had been looking for something like this for quite awhile.  Looked at various possibilities like the hair coloring bottles with the tapered tip...awkward.  Even thought about the catsup and mustart picnic type dispensers...nope.  Then I saw this with the angled tip and thought VOILA...&lt;br /&gt;It works perfectly for personal cleanliness.  I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> this works wonderfully well. I was so happy to find a product that works just right. the head leaks a tad, but when you know that, you just shake it over the sink, so it is no problem. I&#x27;m planning to buy another one for travel. I love that it helps me feel so clean. highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I recently had a below the right knew amputation! My mobility was very limited, let a lone trying to take care of myself after using the camode! This portable bidet helped greatly!!</li>
    <li> I would like a larger bottle capacity and slightly larger spray head but this is a very useful product.  Also a flexible tube with a shut-off clamp would improve it, though these changes would make it less portable.</li>
    <li> Nice little gadget to have in places where no bidet is available.</li>
    <li> This is a great little portable bidet. Holds plenty of water to do your cleanup, very handy for cleaning intimate areas thoroughly.</li>
    <li> I had surgery and afterwards it was painful using the bathroom.  This made it so much better.  You can fill it with warm water and not irritate your skin.  Works upside down!</li>
    <li> This is a great little product,especially if you travel a lot as I do.My son and daughter in law just bought us a bidet to put in our house and this was a totally new concept for us we liked it so well we decided to have one wherever we go and this little portable bidet fit the bill nicely, also it is easier to use than some other models.</li>
    <li> Great little gadget. Life saver</li>
    <li> This is perfect for my needs. I like the way it is made and may buy one to keep with me when I go out. I am having trouble with my hands and wrists now so I don&#x27;t feel as clean as I like at times. This solves the problem completely.</li>
    <li> The perfect portable bidet for home &amp; travel.  This is our third so we are very happy with this product.  :-D</li>
    <li> I am a nurse, and also deal with the elderly when it is dangerous for our elderly population to get into a bathtub on a daily basis.  This is very good for cleaning those private areas of your body without getting a full bath.  It is easy to use, and a very good personal cleaning tool.  Not only good for the elderly it is also good for anyone who wants to keep clean after going to the bathroom without the irritation of wiping after wiping.  You clean with this and then pat dry.  As a nurse, and a woman I can&#x27;t recommend this item enough for safety, cleanliness and personal hygiene.  If not for yourself, and, if you are the caregiver of a elderly parent, or a physically limited loved one, this is more than useful!</li>
    <li> and now it is an often asked &amp;#34;Where did you find that?!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I keep it in my locker at work and one in my car for when traveling.&lt;br /&gt;like I said in another review, It is a personal, Hygienic choice. I can not imagine walking around all day , nuff said,&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t even type it out. Just say, I chose to be shower fresh! and this little wonderful device makes it happen discretely.</li>
    <li> very convenient and the design was well thought out.  Easy to wash.  The top flips and stores in the bottle.</li>
    <li> This is my second order of this particular bidet, and I have tried other squeeze bidets.  The bend in the nozzle makes it comfortable and easy to aim the water flow. For me the straight nozzle requires body contortions--or arm length I simply don&#x27;t have--and ends up being too much trouble altogether.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use, very good for people with dry skin,  and it is also easy to take with you when you are traveling.</li>
    <li> Not really impressed. Had to keep refilling just to get enough water</li>
    <li> I got tired of using water bottles.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for a while. I take it with me everywhere. easy to clean. and the oneway valve function makes it perfect</li>
    <li> A must have for seniors who take multiple medications.&lt;br /&gt;Great for teens to be educated in hygiene matters, especially females in puberty.</li>
    <li> This product does what I wanted but I didn&#x27;t expect it to start leaking water as soon as it was turned upside down. You have to get used to holding it where the leaking won&#x27;t be a problem.</li>
    <li> A must have if you need help cleaning.  I have a bidet at home and this is wonderful when I&#x27;m traveling.</li>
    <li> This little bottle is perfect.  It gets the job done and is so small and easy to use.  Never leaked.  The little bag is nice too for storage.  I hang it on the bathroom doorknob.  I put a few drops of tea tree oil in it for extra freshness and health.</li>
    <li> Might be okay for normal sized people but for a fat guy like me, this is useless.</li>
    <li> One of the better purchases I have made; convenient and practical. What did I ever do without it?</li>
    <li> This does exactly what it says it will do. Nothing fancy, it just works. It would be nice if it came in a larger size. But for travel you wouldn&#x27;t want anything larger than this.</li>
    <li> I never used this method before but I have been pleasantly surprised. I find that leakage is not an issue, just hold your finger over the hole when filling, and it doesn&#x27;t leak when the cap is screwed on. It holds the right among of water when full, is made of soft easy to squeeze plastic, and has the right angle on the spout to hit the right spots. It&#x27;s affordable. If you&#x27;re looking for a method that is easier on the button than course toilet paper (especially in public restrooms) then I have found that this product works as advertised.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my parents and they used it and loved it. Very simple but useful product..  good quality</li>
    <li> Oh I loved this for my postpartum vaginal care.  The hospital gave me a bidet but the curve on this one did a better job.</li>
    <li> Last year when I broke my arm (and I mean to the point where I had to have plates, screws and a cadaver bone implanted), I found the most basic of tasks to be impossible.  This little wonder device was AWESOME -- kept me feeling fresh in between showers.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great to use and very helpful.  I gave it 4 stars because the container is bit small and needs to be refiled which is not easy when you&#x27;re on the go.&lt;br /&gt;All in all,  I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I really would like to stay away from specific details, but this does work. I use it with Cottenelle wipes and it makes me feel clean. You control the pressure so if you are sensitive like me, that is definetly a plus.</li>
    <li> I bought it for travel and while it obviously can&#x27;t compete with a home unit, I would not travel without it. I bought 2 because the size is small enough to require a refill and sometimes that can be difficult.  Overall I am pleased.</li>
    <li> unfortunately leaks terribly.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this in the event of a hurricane and would have on hand if we ran out of toilet paper. It does the job, although (maybe too much info) for a &amp;#34;messy&amp;#34; job, it should be re-filled and fully used again. Still, it solves the problem. Of course, now you are all wet and well, sort of inclined to dry off with toilet paper!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical but was happy that it did what it was suppose to do. I have used it without much difficulty.</li>
    <li> Great product and works as stated, having no leaking problem but it&#x27;s still new.  Don&#x27;t really have a need to sit down before use, just fill and use, so I don&#x27;t understand why people are having the leaking problem. Works good for what you need it for, I will buy again, and you won&#x27;t regret.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I had a toilet bidet at home, but I wanted to have that clean feeling on the go.  I just purchased my third one so I would have one at work and both vehicles.  My only complaint is that it leaks some, but the trade-off is well worth it.  I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I was tired of feeling sore from too rough toilet tissue, this was perfect.  After only using twice, I love this thing.  It also gives you a great feeling of knowing you are clean and fresh.  Small enough to keep in a purse.  The quantity of water is adequate. BTW, to make it small and portable you invert the head into the bottle by squeezing the top of the bottle making it oblong to fit the head/spray. Don&#x27;t leave home without this one!</li>
    <li> Clean your bum on the go!</li>
    <li> Having the inconvenience of untimely needed bladder control, this product gives me moment to moment sanitary freshness throughtout the day. I find it useful not solely as a travel convenience, but useful in managing the daily sanitary needs of day to day existence. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I have for years wanted a bidet. I live in an apartment so this was not possible.&lt;br /&gt;Then I saw this little beauty on Amazon. I bought two. One is for home the other is for travel.&lt;br /&gt;I no longer use the primitive, uncomfortable and unsanitary toilet paper.&lt;br /&gt;It works flawlessly and I am clean.&lt;br /&gt;The little bag that comes with it is great for the one used away from home.&lt;br /&gt;Great for camping too.</li>
    <li> I use it constantly because of incontinence. Wish it were a little larger. I would recommend it to everyone because it is soft and easy to squeeze. I bought a larger one and the plastic was so hard I could not use it.</li>
    <li> This item is the exact the same as the Blue Bidet BB-20 model. I ordered both just to find out. The only difference is the brand name printed on the carrying case. Otherwise, everything else is the same. The Blue Bidet is selling for 12.50 or $2.50 cheaper. Don&#x27;t over pay. Get the Blue Bidet for cheaper! I&#x27;ll upgrade this item to 5 star after the seller reduces the price to match the Blue Bidet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update May 22, 2013, it was brought to my attention that Washmate is now priced lower than Blue Bidet. I&#x27;d dump Blue Bidet and buy Washmate for the new comers. 5 star now. Good luck.</li>
    <li> and portablility this can&#x27;t be beat.  Actually a little larger size would be very nice, but this does the trick.</li>
    <li> This is a good little hand bidet for the price. The angled neck really does help, and a steady stream of water comes out of the bidet during use (squeezing the bottle creates a stronger spray, but even if you don&#x27;t squeeze it, a nice light stream of water comes out). Others have mentioned leakiness; the bottle doesn&#x27;t really leak as long as you cover the little hole in the bottom with your finger. This little hole is necessary in order to help the water come out when the bidet is upside-down and in use. I think this is definitely a handy little device and would recommend.</li>
