      <li>The product is great.</li>
      <li>This shampoo is really good for dandruff and itching.</li>
      <li>out of the bottle, very pleasant and light ginger scent.</li>
      <li>And is amazing for the scalp.  </li>
      <li>Nice lather.</li>
      <li>really nice shampoo, even for my scalp eczema</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also very light and can be used every day.</li>
      <li>An excellent product, much more efficient AND safer than regular drugstore brands and deoRtment store end.</li>
      <li>My hair stylist (at one of the top salons in San Francisco) recommended this shampoo.</li>
      <li>Also leaves the scalp and hair very clean.</li>
      <li>Sachajuan gave me great expectations because an online review I saw on a Chinese website.</li>
      <li>Very much enjoy using it.</li>
      <li>Imagine my surprise when a FLY fell into my hand with the last pump.</li>
      <li>I love this shampoo as much as Aveda!  </li>
      <li>It leaves my hair so clean I can actually go 3 days without washing and the best part is not have to constantly scratch my head like I have lice or something.  </li>
      <li>Sometimes it leaves my hair a bit dry if I don&#x27;t use a good conditioner after.</li>
      <li>Worth the money.</li>
      <li>It does not smell fantastic however I have noticed new baby hair growth and am dandruff-free!</li>
      <li>And it doesn&#x27;t take much to get your hair clean.</li>
      <li>The 2 main ingredients in Sachajuan Scalp Shampoo - Piroctone Olamine and Climbazole are not only effective against dandruff, they also inhibit hair loss and also may provide some regrowth which is what led me to this product.</li>

      <li>It leaves my so nice and moist, not drying like some other scalp shampoos.</li>

      <li>I really like the smell</li>
      <li>but it really didn&#x27;t help with the itching.</li>
      <li>The other ingredients - Rosemary oil, menthol, salicylic acid and ginger extract are also touted as having anti hair loss properties as well as beneficial for a healthy scalp.</li>
      <li>It did clean &amp; shine it, but no big difference to justify the cost.</li>
      <li>I am not one to write many reviews but just want to let other potential buyers know that this particular scalp shampoo does wonders!</li>
      <li>I have been very surprised &amp; happy!&lt;br</li>
      <li>This shampoo is clear (no dyes!)</li>
      <li>Many times a simple shampoo such as Suave or Pantene Pro-V would leave my scalp itchy, red and irritated.</li>
      <li>My dandruff isn&#x27;t severe, just comes here and there but this has kept away the itchiness and flakes completely!</li>
      <li>This completely resolved the issue, and does so without drying out my hair.</li>
      <li>Natural oil production has completely rebalanced.</li>
      <li>I have fine, thin, brown hair, and I have been very picky on my choice of shampoo.</li>
      <li>Slightly drying, but has really helped with itchy scalp.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The 2 main ingredients in Sachajuan Scalp Shampoo - Piroctone Olamine and Climbazole are not only effective against dandruff, they also inhibit hair loss and also may provide some regrowth which is what led me to this product. Google these ingredients and do some research. The other ingredients - Rosemary oil, menthol, salicylic acid and ginger extract are also touted as having anti hair loss properties as well as beneficial for a healthy scalp. The shampoo soothes my scalp, leaving it refreshed. I lather and leave it on for the remainder of my shower so it can do it&#x27;s job. I&#x27;ve always had itchy scalp, so even if this doesn&#x27;t contribute to hair growth, I&#x27;m happy that I&#x27;m not scratching. It&#x27;s also very light and can be used every day.</li>
    <li> After using some hair masks I noticed I began getting dandruff.  Thank God this product got rid of my dandruff!  Sometimes it leaves my hair a bit dry if I don&#x27;t use a good conditioner after.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is really good for dandruff and itching. Also leaves the scalp and hair very clean.</li>
    <li> Slightly drying, but has really helped with itchy scalp.  The dry hair conditioner helps, but I need an extra deep conditioning treatment at least once a week to keep my hair from getting brittle.</li>
    <li> I use this shampoo 2-3 times a week, and it really does sooth my itchy scalp.  I will definitely be purchasing this product again.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is clear (no dyes!) out of the bottle, very pleasant and light ginger scent. Nice lather. Very much enjoy using it.</li>
    <li> My hair stylist (at one of the top salons in San Francisco) recommended this shampoo. It does not smell fantastic however I have noticed new baby hair growth and am dandruff-free! My dandruff isn&#x27;t severe, just comes here and there but this has kept away the itchiness and flakes completely! Worth the money.</li>
    <li> really nice shampoo, even for my scalp eczema</li>
    <li> My hair dresser recommended this shampoo after I began battling with some scalp issues (dandruff/flaking). This completely resolved the issue, and does so without drying out my hair. Great product!</li>
    <li> This product works wonder on itchy scalp. It leaves my hair so clean I can actually go 3 days without washing and the best part is not have to constantly scratch my head like I have lice or something.  It leaves my so nice and moist, not drying like some other scalp shampoos. It&#x27;s worth every penny and even better than the more expensive line like Aveda and Shu Uemura which does really nothing for my hair.</li>
    <li> Like a growing majority of people, I have serious skin allergies. Many times a simple shampoo such as Suave or Pantene Pro-V would leave my scalp itchy, red and irritated. It would even cause me to break out. I tried several over the counter products such as Head and Shoulders, Neutrogena T-gels, etc. with no relief for the symptoms. When I found out about Sachajuan Scalp Shampoo I was skeptical because of my past experience and it was also pretty expensive compared to what I&#x27;m used to spending. However, within a week all of my symptoms cleared up! And it doesn&#x27;t take much to get your hair clean. I use a nickel sized amount and it usually does the trick.</li>
    <li> Does not work, very small bottle for such large price.</li>
    <li> The product is great. However when I got it , it only has half bottle</li>
    <li> It did what it says. An excellent product, much more efficient AND safer than regular drugstore brands and deoRtment store end.</li>
    <li> This product is very expensive, but I thought I would try it based on the reviews. It made no difference in my hair. It did clean &amp; shine it, but no big difference to justify the cost. Also, leaked into the back it was shipped in. Shipper needs to tape the lid. This stuff is expensive!</li>
    <li> I really like the smell and I have noticed a decrease in flakes but it really didn&#x27;t help with the itching.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo as much as Aveda!  Sachajuan scalp takes care of numerous problems, e.g. frizzy hair, dry hair, color-treated, etc.  And is amazing for the scalp.  I have been very surprised &amp; happy!&lt;br /&gt;PS it smells &amp;#34;normal,&amp;#34; unlike other Sachajuan products.</li>
    <li> Very good for itchy scalp</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure why this is described as a scalp shampoo - did not help at all with my itchy scalp. I get the same results with a regular drug store shampoo for far less money. I would not buy again.</li>
    <li> Dermatologists need to prescribe this product for seborrheic dermatitis. In 20 years of trying every product promoted for this condition, Sachajuan is the only alternative to steroidal solutions that has ever provided relief to my scalp. Results were instant. I have been using this shampoo with the dry hair conditioner and hair repair too for 6 months. The suppleness and shine have been restored. Natural oil production has completely rebalanced. This truly is a miracle product.</li>
    <li> I like the shampoo as it helped the dandruff (seborrhea) that I suffered from. It should be followed by a conditioner cause it makes hair dry.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product and I recently finished the bottle. Imagine my surprise when a FLY fell into my hand with the last pump. Who knows, maybe that was the secret ingredient, but it grossed me out. Will not buy again. Beyond that, there was no noticeable improvement in my hair.</li>
    <li> This is one of the worst shampoo I have ever used. I have fine, thin, brown hair, and I have been very picky on my choice of shampoo. Sachajuan gave me great expectations because an online review I saw on a Chinese website. However, even when I shower in the morning, this shampoo gives no volume at all. My hair is flat, and my scalp is itchy. I&#x27;m going to try Ryoe next.</li>
    <li> I am not one to write many reviews but just want to let other potential buyers know that this particular scalp shampoo does wonders! My dry scalp and flakes that came with it is gone after just a couple weeks of use and shampoo leaves my hair feeling smooth and tangle free. 👍</li>
