      <li>Cute item and the gloss is great!</li>
      <li>Very smooth on my lips and smells very good.</li>
      <li>It feels amazing and looks great over lip stain​.</li>
      <li>but since I save it, it has lasted me a good six months or so</li>
      <li>Delicious, shiny and smooth.  </li>
      <li>but I wish more pot lipglosses came with their own applicator!  </li>
      <li>This product is so cute!</li>
      <li>you&#x27;re tempted to try it because it&#x27;s cute, go for it!  </li>
      <li>Works nice, and has a nice shine.</li>
      <li>It is just a cute lip gloss that feels so good.</li>
      <li>Although the gloss isn&#x27;t portable (if you want to use the applicator to apply), I&#x27;m super happy with it.  </li>
      <li>I must admit I first purchased this because of the way it looked, but after using it I have to say it feels great on my lips and gets the job done.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>ALL OK.</li>
      <li>The gloss itself had a more elastic quality.  </li>
      <li>SURELY, I WILL CONTACT YOU AGAIN.</li>
      <li>So if you try it and love</li>
      <li>I love the packaging of this lip balm.</li>
      <li>I love the container</li>
      <li>looks cute sitting out by the mirror</li>
      <li>Cute pot and love the gloss</li>
      <li>I like to keep gloss/lip balm next to my bedside so this was perfect for what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>Super cute and tasty!</li>
      <li>Overall great brand and love the balm.</li>
      <li>It looks great by itself but also looks great on top of lipstick, and since the only downside is the price I tend to save it for when I dress up and actually wear lipstick.  </li>
      <li>But overall happy</li>
      <li>The cute packaging is a plus and, like most skinfood products, it&#x27;s really well made.  </li>
      <li>It has a very mild flowery flavor with a hint of sweet honey</li>
      <li>It will surprise you and become your new favorite lip gloss!</li>
      <li>Wonderful product but very small amount for the cost.  </li>
      <li>This is a nice gloss that is not thick and sticky, but very shiny.  </li>
      <li>The manufactured date on the bottom of the jar was two months ago, so I know this is fresh.  </li>
      <li>This little honey pot not only tastes  delicious</li>
      <li>Only the bottle is cute.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s in a cute little jar and the applicator keeps my fingers clean - another</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s plastic, but it doesn&#x27;t feel cheap; Even the photos look cheaper than the actual product!  </li>
      <li>Worked really well</li>
      <li>so I highly recommend it.  </li>
      <li>so really, it&#x27;s not a complaint at all.  </li>
      <li>and I love them both 😊 not sticky or thick and its really shiny.</li>
      <li>This was the product that got me interested in the skinfood brand (which I now use as my regular skin care regime)</li>
      <li>this review is about the original product (#3 Honey), but I can&#x27;t wait until I get to try the other flavors and tints!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s in cute but very small jar.</li>
      <li>and you can barely smell it (a plus in my book).  </li>
      <li>There is barely any color or flavor, which is something I like.  </li>
      <li>It was Maxx Factor, (I think), and came in a white container like the old rouge containers back then and was made of a resin like substance.  </li>
      <li>It smells good and doesn&#x27;t taste too bad either.</li>

    <li> Super cute and tasty! Not sticky!</li>
    <li> Cute pot and love the gloss</li>
    <li> Jelly texture, shiny gloss but no Mandarin flavor.</li>
    <li> Cute item and the gloss is great! I must admit I first purchased this because of the way it looked, but after using it I have to say it feels great on my lips and gets the job done. It even has a little plastic attachment to keep the stick in place. I like to keep gloss/lip balm next to my bedside so this was perfect for what I was looking for. I would not put it in your purse if you don&#x27;t want the stick to get dirty from purse excess. Overall great brand and love the balm.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  Put it on before I go to bed and my lips feel great in the morning, no skin flakes.  Am just discovering skin food products and I am finding I like what I am trying.</li>
    <li> THANK YOU FOR SHOWING ME THIS GOD. SURELY, I WILL CONTACT YOU AGAIN. ALL OK. THE PRODUCT IS DELICIOUS</li>
    <li> I ordered the honey pot gloss in mandarin.  This is a nice gloss that is not thick and sticky, but very shiny.  There is barely any color or flavor, which is something I like.  It&#x27;s in a cute little jar and the applicator keeps my fingers clean - another plus!  Once applied, my lips feel moisturized for hours.  Although the gloss isn&#x27;t portable (if you want to use the applicator to apply), I&#x27;m super happy with it.  I only need a tiny amount each time, so this little pot is going to last forever!  The manufactured date on the bottom of the jar was two months ago, so I know this is fresh.  I&#x27;m so happy I tried this!</li>
    <li> This lip balm stays on and actually keeps my lips from feeling dry and chapped. I would buy it again and plan to purchase it once I run out.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s in cute but very small jar. It smells good and doesn&#x27;t taste too bad either. It is very sticky and a little dab goes a very long way on your lips. It doesn&#x27;t give your lips any color enhancement or change.</li>
    <li> I got the yellow one too and I love them both 😊 not sticky or thick and its really shiny. I love the container looks cute sitting out by the mirror</li>
    <li> Wonderful product but very small amount for the cost.  But overall happy</li>
    <li> I typically hate lip glosses because they tend to go sticky, taste like flavored cosmetics, or don&#x27;t pull through on their advertised glossiness.  This little honey pot not only tastes  delicious it gives you an amazing &#x27;that-has-to-be-photoshopped&#x27; shine!  It has a very mild flowery flavor with a hint of sweet honey and you can barely smell it (a plus in my book).  There is absolutely no stickiness, it really just feels like your lips are wet.  It doesn&#x27;t get sticky even when you&#x27;ve been wearing it for hours, and while it lasts just as long as all glosses, I wish it lasted longer!  It looks great by itself but also looks great on top of lipstick, and since the only downside is the price I tend to save it for when I dress up and actually wear lipstick.  It will last about a month if you use it two to three times a day but since I save it, it has lasted me a good six months or so (still have a bit left).  The cute packaging is a plus and, like most skinfood products, it&#x27;s really well made.  It&#x27;s plastic, but it doesn&#x27;t feel cheap; Even the photos look cheaper than the actual product!  The plastic piece that holds the applicator is the only complaint (it&#x27;s slightly annoying),  but I wish more pot lipglosses came with their own applicator!  I dislike getting lipgloss all over my fingers though so really, it&#x27;s not a complaint at all.  This was the product that got me interested in the skinfood brand (which I now use as my regular skin care regime) so I highly recommend it.  Delicious, shiny and smooth.  FYI this review is about the original product (#3 Honey), but I can&#x27;t wait until I get to try the other flavors and tints!  So if you try it and love it let me know, or just review it yourself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re tempted to try it because it&#x27;s cute, go for it!  It will surprise you and become your new favorite lip gloss!</li>
    <li> I searched for pot of gloss like the one I used to buy in the 60&#x27;s.  It was Maxx Factor, (I think), and came in a white container like the old rouge containers back then and was made of a resin like substance.  The wider opening made it easier to apply.  The gloss itself had a more elastic quality.  This one will do, but is lighter and thinner than the one I am searching for.  Also the pot of gloss had no fragrance and although it looks like the same color, it was colorless.</li>
    <li> Very smooth on my lips and smells very good. It came a lot smaller than I expected</li>
    <li> This product is so cute! It emproved the look of my lips too. I love it.</li>
    <li> This palm is not a treatment. It is just a cute lip gloss that feels so good. It took a long time until I received it, but it worths the waiting.</li>
    <li> I love the packaging of this lip balm. It is also very nice. I like the brand, and have no complaints about the product. Works nice, and has a nice shine.</li>
    <li> Although the container is very small, you only need a tiny dab to cover your lips. It feels amazing and looks great over lip stain​.</li>
    <li> Worked really well but i ordered three different &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34; and couldn&#x27;t tell them apart.</li>
    <li> This was the worst lipgloss I have ever used. Only the bottle is cute.</li>
