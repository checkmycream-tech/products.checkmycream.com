### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>But...the sellers are way too proud of it!</li>
      <li>you do a great job.</li>
      <li>Alberta VO5 hairdressing is a great product.</li>
      <li>But, the product still works great just as it did before.</li>
      <li>This is one of the best hair products for Fine Hair.  </li>
      <li>but this formula is also good for chapped hands, and for use on your leather (not suede) products to keep them from cracking and well oiled.  </li>
      <li>Yep...many have laughed at me...</li>
      <li>I love this stuff!</li>
      <li>I was so happy to find Alberto V05 for Fine Hair.</li>
      <li>does not make your hair greasy, and is great for fine hair.</li>
      <li>When I proceeded to squeeze the tube the contents oozed out abundantly with sporadic \\&quot;nothingness!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>My mother had her own beauty salon and taught me to use quality products on my hair.</li>
      <li>I have used this product for many years and have always liked what it does for my hair.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know why it is not stocked in stores anymore, but have&lt;br /&gt;not been able to find it in stores for years.</li>
      <li>I also love the smell..</li>
      <li>Of course i was thrilled to find the product available again.  </li>
      <li>I was glad to find it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>So excited when I found it again, so stock up!</li>
      <li>The young, and very good stylist used to laugh at my using my VO5 vs their salon products.  </li>
      <li>Love this product, great with my long, fine hair.</li>
      <li>The Extra body for Fine Hair formula works great on my hair.  </li>
      <li>Unruly hair quickly becomes manageable.</li>
      <li>NOW, you will laugh...</li>
      <li>Not crazy about this one.  </li>
      <li>This light, creamy conditioner is just right for providing a daily hairdressing to fine hair.  </li>
      <li>Wonderful product but expensive ordered this way.</li>
      <li>I read many reviews stating the same thing.  </li>
      <li>I love this product and can&#x27;t find it locally.  </li>
      <li>I have also tried the Grey VO5 and the one that is more like a gel...</li>
      <li>I take my tube of Alberto VO5 for Extra Body for Fine Hair with me.  </li>
      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>I really appreciate the fast response</li>
      <li>Looks natural, is NON GREASY, NON STICKY and keeps my drying hair (due to age guys) from being brittle and it keeps my hair laying nicely.  </li>
      <li>Just a tiny dab of this non-greasy, non-sticky hairdressing does a lot to make my fine hair look shiny and natural, and it has virtually no odor.  </li>
      <li>Price was way too high for one (1) tube of VO5.</li>
      <li>When this product was sold by Alberto Culver it was  less expensive, however, it was great discovering it again  even though the price was almost three times more.  </li>
      <li>It is totally old school, but it does wonders for my hair.</li>
      <li>Then for some unknown reason this product for fine hair disappeared from stores while two of their other varieties remained for sale.  </li>
      <li>but the last laugh is mine because this hair product is a little miracle in a tube.</li>
      <li>I had a hard time finding it in any chain store and tried other formulations, e.g., original and the one for blonde or silver hair, but this is the one I really wanted.  </li>

<li> Compared to the other products of the same line it has lightness not viscosity, neutral smell not heavy &amp; pungent &amp; resistant as the others.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately it has been discontinued and the item purchased was sold at 4 times the regular price</li>
<li> It leaves shine, enhances natural highlights, does not discolor, and adds the extra bounce other heavy, greasy products lack.  </li>
<li> i had used VO5 Conditioning Hairdressing for a very long time years ago.  </li>
<li> I used to use it years ago as the regular V05 was so heavy for my hair and made it greasy.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ll need to think very carefully to decide if I will order it again.</li>
<li> There was a limited quantity available and the price was outrageous - five times the normal price.</li>
<li> From a few dollars, which i might add, the other two varieties still cost,to over $40.00 seems like &amp;#34;highway robbery&amp;#34;.  </li>
<li> My concern is that it is just too expensive in comparison to other similar products.  </li>
<li> but when I opened the package, the tube of VO5  appeared to be hard and inflated  while the retail packaging was flattened through the shipping process.  </li>
<li> I am not thrilled however at the price.  </li>
<li> This seriously isnt for 1 case, I am assuming 12 (unit)</li>
<li> As I also read from others, upon opening the tube, the cream began gushing out all over loosing much of my expensive product.  </li>
<li> It was very disappointing.</li>
<li> Price is outrageous.</li>

    <li> Price was way too high for one (1) tube of VO5.</li>

    <li> When this product was sold by Alberto Culver it was  less expensive, however, it was great discovering it again  even though the price was almost three times more.  I received the product on time but when I opened the package, the tube of VO5  appeared to be hard and inflated  while the retail packaging was flattened through the shipping process.  When I proceeded to squeeze the tube the contents oozed out abundantly with sporadic \\&quot;nothingness!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;I rest my case!!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product but expensive ordered this way.</li>
    <li> Love this product, great with my long, fine hair. But...the sellers are way too proud of it! Price is outrageous. I will be looking for something else, since I can&#x27;t find a store that carries it.</li>
    <li> Not crazy about this one.  Cause frizz.</li>
    <li> i had used VO5 Conditioning Hairdressing for a very long time years ago.  Then for some unknown reason this product for fine hair disappeared from stores while two of their other varieties remained for sale.  I read many reviews stating the same thing.  Of course i was thrilled to find the product available again.  I am not thrilled however at the price.  From a few dollars, which i might add, the other two varieties still cost,to over $40.00 seems like &amp;#34;highway robbery&amp;#34;.

    <li> I love this stuff! It is totally old school, but it does wonders for my hair.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best hair products for Fine Hair.  I CAN NOT FIND IT ON AMAZON AND IF I COULD, I WOULD ORDER SEVERAL CASES.  I CAN NOT FIND IT IN STORES EITHER.  CAN YOU GET ME ANY?</li>
    <li> Alberta VO5 hairdressing is a great product. does not make your hair greasy, and is great for fine hair. I don&#x27;t know why it is not stocked in stores anymore, but have&lt;br /&gt;not been able to find it in stores for years. I really appreciate the fast response&lt;br /&gt;and receiving of this product. you do a great job. thanks</li>
    <li> There was a limited quantity available and the price was outrageous - five times the normal price. It was very disappointing.</li>
    <li> My mother had her own beauty salon and taught me to use quality products on my hair. I am a 65+ male with thinning hair.  Each time I get a haircut I take my tube of Alberto VO5 for Extra Body for Fine Hair with me.  The young, and very good stylist used to laugh at my using my VO5 vs their salon products.  Not any longer.  I have also tried the Grey VO5 and the one that is more like a gel...both are too sticky for my preference.  The Extra body for Fine Hair formula works great on my hair.  Looks natural, is NON GREASY, NON STICKY and keeps my drying hair (due to age guys) from being brittle and it keeps my hair laying nicely.  NOW, you will laugh...but this formula is also good for chapped hands, and for use on your leather (not suede) products to keep them from cracking and well oiled.  Yep...many have laughed at me...but the last laugh is mine because this hair product is a little miracle in a tube.</li>
    <li> This seriously isnt for 1 case, I am assuming 12 (unit)</li>
    <li> This light, creamy conditioner is just right for providing a daily hairdressing to fine hair.  It leaves shine, enhances natural highlights, does not discolor, and adds the extra bounce other heavy, greasy products lack.  So excited when I found it again, so stock up!</li>
    <li> Are you kidding me???  One tube for $27.00?  This should have been for a multi pack.  This is robbery.  Last time I ever buy this through Amazon and will tell everyone I know.</li>
    <li> Compared to the other products of the same line it has lightness not viscosity, neutral smell not heavy &amp; pungent &amp; resistant as the others.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately it has been discontinued and the item purchased was sold at 4 times the regular price</li>
    <li> I love this product and can&#x27;t find it locally.  My concern is that it is just too expensive in comparison to other similar products.  Add the delivery charges, and the cost is way out of line.  I&#x27;ll need to think very carefully to decide if I will order it again.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years and have always liked what it does for my hair. Unruly hair quickly becomes manageable. What I look for when purchasing it is price and service and I find both at Amazon.</li>
    <li> I was so happy to find Alberto V05 for Fine Hair. I used to use it years ago as the regular V05 was so heavy for my hair and made it greasy. I also love the smell.. My daughter told me to try Amazon, and will remember to use them again. Thank you. drw</li>
