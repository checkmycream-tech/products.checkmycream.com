    <li> Love it!  Just wish we could buy it in the UK.</li>
    <li> Amazing scent. I received a sample when I ordered through Thymes, otherwise I probably would not have tried the body wash. I am not a fan of olives and could not imagine this would be a flattering scent. Boy was I wrong. Light fresh fragrance with a definite feminine appeal.&lt;br /&gt;Love, love, love!!!</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic shower gel, leaves your skin feeling soft with a hint of fragrance.  As others have stated the fragrance is perfect for women and men alike.  Will continue to use this product thank you for the helpful reviews.</li>
    <li> When I use this people actually comment and ask me what it is.&lt;br /&gt;It is a fairly strong smell, but I think it&#x27;s clean.  It&#x27;s not olive-y at all.</li>
    <li> Smells awesome without being overpowering. This is one of my favorite little shower luxuries!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion and body wash. It smells so clean and refreshing! I would recommend this product to anyone</li>
    <li> Nice scent and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin!</li>
    <li> Body wash smell different than the lotion. Smells more like something a man would wear. Love the lotion but may pass on teh wash next time.</li>
    <li> It does the job very well with a clean fragrance and a wonderful lather.  I have tried over the counter body washes and have been dissatisfied.  I am so glad I am able to purchase this from Amazon.</li>
    <li> but wish the fragrance was a bit longer lasting. Still a nice smelling body wash in my favorite fragrance. Perfect for daytime!</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance helps eliminate the tips of fingers cracking</li>

    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE it!  Wish it came in bigger bottles!</li>
    <li> I love the silkiness in the rich, creamy lather. Smells so fresh and clean too.&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels moisturized and smooth, not dry and scaly. Great product. I will buy it again.</li>

    <li> This is an amazing scent! Love it! I think I need to buy the body lotion to make the scent last longer. But I like that it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out and smells so fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product.  I have it my shower &amp; in my guest bathroom too.  The botanical scent is appropriate for both men &amp; women.  It has a long lasting, very pleasant scent.  I first started using it after finding it at a local, high end gift shop.  The price was so much better on Amazon.  You might also want to buy the body lotion in this scent!</li>
