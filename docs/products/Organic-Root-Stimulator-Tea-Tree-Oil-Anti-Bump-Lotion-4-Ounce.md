### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Works great!</li>
      <li>For me this is the best for use to prevent ingrown hairs after epilating.</li>
      <li>I havent experienced not one ingrown hair since ive been using this after my epilation sessions.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell great.</li>
      <li>This worked great to get away razor bumps on my legs and groin are.</li>
      <li>great moisturizing lotion, also very effective if you apply it before shaving.  </li>
      <li>The smell is pleasant, and it works fairly well.</li>
      <li>Love it great product.</li>
      <li>It allowed me to grow an awesome beard (which I did to give my face a rest from shaving) without any itching whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it for 6 months straight!</li>
      <li>I honestly cannot say that the problem is gone</li>
      <li>Great Product specially for males.</li>
      <li>This is the best product, of its nature, that I&#x27;ve EVER used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it, in particular, to prevent ingrown hairs and razor bumps... as well as to keep the skin beneath my beard healthy and well-moisturized.</li>
      <li>I thought of going to a dermatologist but when you research this kind of problem online, you can see advice given by many dermatologists and this is one problem that seems to be close to untreatable.</li>
      <li>but IT SEEMS TO BE much better than it</li>
      <li>I love the product...</li>
      <li>Helps prevent more bumps, but doesn&#x27;t prevent them 100%.</li>
      <li>Love the feeling of this after shaving.  </li>
      <li>I can confidently recommend this product.</li>
      <li>This isn&#x27;t as smooth as advertised.  </li>
      <li>and at first, I didn&#x27;t use it much because, frankly, the smell of tee tree is very strong and I am not fond of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I use it as a regular face lotion and it mixes amazingly well with foundation which I then apply with a kabuki make-up brush.</li>
      <li>I also think the smell is nice, definitely has tea tree oil in it</li>
      <li>This is not my first time using this product.  </li>
      <li>but if it helps as much as I think it might be helping, I&#x27;ll deal with it.</li>
      <li>though I don&#x27;t fancy the scent that much.</li>
      <li>but really works.</li>
      <li>This is only after a week or so, however and I will try and be sure to update this review later.</li>
      <li>and if you shave your head even better was once sold buy local stores like Wal green and beauty shops but not carried any more at least not in my neck of the woods glad to find them..</li>
      <li>The product was really disappointing and it does have a pleasant smell.</li>
      <li>I had/have been using other lotions over time but most of them seem to do very little for my skin, often leave a greasy residue that hangs around for hours and some of them burn my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <li> The smell is pleasant, and it works fairly well.</li>
    <li> Hard to find item ,makes your face feel like butter and if you shave your head even better was once sold buy local stores like Wal green and beauty shops but not carried any more at least not in my neck of the woods glad to find them.. Must try I stand by this product for fighting bumps..</li>
    <li> Seems to work well for the hubs</li>
    <li> This is the best product, of its nature, that I&#x27;ve EVER used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it, in particular, to prevent ingrown hairs and razor bumps... as well as to keep the skin beneath my beard healthy and well-moisturized. It allowed me to grow an awesome beard (which I did to give my face a rest from shaving) without any itching whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it for 6 months straight!</li>
    <li> great moisturizing lotion, also very effective if you apply it before shaving.  basically follow the directions on the bottle</li>
    <li> I love the product...</li>
    <li> This is not my first time using this product.  It gives me a closer shave and it keeps me from bumping up and has no irritation.</li>
    <li> not a fan of the scent.</li>
    <li> I never got the chance to see whether this product helped with my razor bumps. The product didn&#x27;t mesh well with my skin - my neck grew very red and irritated upon application.</li>
    <li> I like the smell but it does have a medium/ faint tea tree oil smell. I use it as a regular face lotion and it mixes amazingly well with foundation which I then apply with a kabuki make-up brush. With this lotion I have no more ingrown hairs or breakouts!</li>
    <li> I can confidently recommend this product. I have a tough skin and have been using very expensive products to keep my razor bumps away.&lt;br /&gt;I tried this product for 2 weeks and it works as well as my costly aftershave though I don&#x27;t fancy the scent that much.</li>
    <li> Love it great product.</li>
    <li> no results.  I used it every night and in the morning after shaving.  I still have bumps.</li>
    <li> Disclosure - I did not buy this here. I don&#x27;t remember where I bought it but I might end up having to buy it here next time if I can&#x27;t find it again anywhere else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Over the last few years I have had a maddening problem with rashes and itching on my face and scalp. The magnitude of this problem is really difficult for me to put into words, as I have tried just about everything I could think of with limited (or no) results whatsoever. My doctor was no help at all. I thought of going to a dermatologist but when you research this kind of problem online, you can see advice given by many dermatologists and this is one problem that seems to be close to untreatable. They all give the same advice and while it might work for some people, it is useless for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; My mother bought this product for me a while back and at first, I didn&#x27;t use it much because, frankly, the smell of tee tree is very strong and I am not fond of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I guess I let it sit for probably six months and out of frustration I started aggressively using it on my face and scalp after shaving both. I honestly cannot say that the problem is gone but IT SEEMS TO BE much better than it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I had/have been using other lotions over time but most of them seem to do very little for my skin, often leave a greasy residue that hangs around for hours and some of them burn my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This is only after a week or so, however and I will try and be sure to update this review later. I still do not like the smell but if it helps as much as I think it might be helping, I&#x27;ll deal with it. I just hope I can find it somewhere local.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband who has been using it for several years and loves it!</li>
    <li> Love the feeling of this after shaving.  Def, works on razor bumps.  Have to shave every other day to keep them under control, use this product plus the spray!</li>
    <li> This worked great to get away razor bumps on my legs and groin are. It also worked on razor bumps on my boyfriends face. I also think the smell is nice, definitely has tea tree oil in it</li>
    <li> Dont work like it should</li>
    <li> The product was really disappointing and it does have a pleasant smell. I used it twice and stopped. Never buying this again!</li>
    <li> This does soften beard hair but the chemical smell bothers me. I&#x27;m over sensitive to odors and this stuff is hard for me to take. It does the job though. I just can&#x27;t wear it all day for bump protection like others can.</li>
    <li> Great Product specially for males. Stinks but really works. I would order again.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t as smooth as advertised.  The shaving quality is not what I would have expected.  I will stick to other forms of lubricant.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell great. Helps prevent more bumps, but doesn&#x27;t prevent them 100%.</li>
    <li> For me this is the best for use to prevent ingrown hairs after epilating. I havent experienced not one ingrown hair since ive been using this after my epilation sessions. They make a follow up tea tree spray that i use after i apply this cream. Works great!</li>
