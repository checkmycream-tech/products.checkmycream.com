      <li>Loved my oils.</li>
      <li>Can always count on Edens Garden to make a good product.</li>
      <li>Great product, superb price, fast shipping.....</li>
      <li>This is another oil I have purchased through Edens Gardens and have been very pleased with.</li>
      <li>I love this blend!</li>
      <li>This is one of my favorite oils from Eden&#x27;s Garden!</li>
      <li>and I cant wait to order more!</li>
      <li>I was very please with this product, the speed that it was received, and wonderful fragrance of this blend.</li>
      <li>This is the kind of aroma that grows on you.  </li>
      <li>Smells nice</li>
      <li>Great product, quick shipping.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very strong, though.</li>
      <li>I bought it because of the good reviews but am not all that excited about it.</li>
      <li>It smells more like sage and oranges.</li>
      <li>/&gt;You&#x27;ll appreciate the scent and peace of mind this oil brings, I&#x27;m sure of it.</li>
      <li>a bit of conflicting fragrances, maybe too many notes put together?</li>
      <li>This was better than the aphrodisiac blend</li>
      <li>One of my favorite smelling oil blends.  </li>
      <li>A luscious scent and leaves a lovely lingering aroma in the room.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite oil.</li>
      <li>but this also has a strong woody almost medicinal like aroma that I didn&#x27;t care for, it might be interesting as a mic but alone is not that appealing.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a pretty good price, too.</li>
      <li>When I open the door, the scent kind of welcome&#x27;s me home from the work day.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very refreshing and truly does put me in a more peaceful mood.  </li>
      <li>This has a unique but really great smell, it really smells like what I want to smell while I&#x27;m meditating.</li>
      <li>She likes it very much and says it is a nice, relaxing fragrance.</li>
      <li>We have also used virtually every MLM essential oil brand known to man, and this is right up there with the best of them in quality and purity, at a fraction of the price.</li>
      <li>The orange balances out the Patchouli which can be strong and it really has a nice relaxing / herbal smell.</li>
      <li>I say this because for most essential oil users, quality and purity is a concern, and many are under the impression that you can only get the best by joining an MLM.</li>
      <li>I can get enough of it, works great for relaxation.</li>
      <li>The 100% therapeutic grades as well as the Synergy Blends are fabulous.</li>
      <li>Definitely will buy again, very nice blend.</li>
      <li>The smell was overwhelming at first</li>
      <li>good!&lt;br /&gt;Order arrived early &amp; Edens Garden is very reputable -</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very mellow spicy, sexy fragrance that relax&#x27;s me immediately.</li>
      <li>essential oils are good, and not everyone will like every combination.</li>
      <li>That is why many former MLM essential oil distributors who still want to use a great product yet can’t afford the network marketing prices and aren’t making any money with them have tried and like Eden’s Garden.</li>
      <li>I am pleased so far with Eden&#x27;s Garden oils</li>
      <li>, I find it stress relieving, relaxing, and useful in cultivating a state of mindfulness in my meditation practice.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m the kind of person who likes a bit of a punch in the scent of my essential oils</li>
      <li>and I think this is my favorite so far.</li>
      <li>For the price you pay is well worth every penny in beneficial results.</li>
      <li>Anyways I LOVE using this oil (and the many other synergy blends I purchased from Eden&#x27;s Garden on Amazon)</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this seller!!</li>
      <li>Walking into the room the next day after using this oil is a lovely and yummy experience.</li>
      <li>Only a few drops make the whole room smell wonderful.</li>
      <li>Thanks for not selling junk!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve learned one can always trust Edens Garden for quality products that are reasonably priced!.</li>
      <li>This is a little strong on patchouli when you sniff it in the bottle, but that quickly fades out and the other scents come forward, makes the house smell great and really is calming.</li>
      <li>Nice scent to use in my lotion and other body products.</li>
      <li>This is a lovely blend of fragrance which I have successfully used for my \\&quot;quiet time\\&quot; ... helpful for meditation or just grabbing a few minutes respite from a busy or hectic day.</li>
      <li>I have not had dreams in a very long time, and as interesting as it is</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok but not as consistent as other therapeutic grade myrrh</li>
      <li>After a hard day at work it works good with my spa mist.will purchase this product again .</li>
      <li>I added 10 drops into my oil warmer &amp; it smells really</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very calming.</li>
      <li>I really like this blend.</li>
      <li>Very pungent.</li>
      <li>and I do enjoy a lot of the different notes, but I just can&#x27;t get around the patchouli.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a blend that for me is very calming.</li>
      <li>Works really well for me.</li>
      <li>I really enjoy smelling this blend of essential oils during meditation and yoga.</li>
      <li>The scent has good enough staying power for meditation, but isn&#x27;t lingering and allows me to easily settle back into the mundane world.</li>
      <li>This is product is overwhelmingly patchouli even though there are other oils blended.</li>
      <li>Many of the praises for Eden’s Garden come from current and / or former DT, Melaleuca, and YL customers.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend them for both quality &amp; service!&lt;br</li>
      <li>Before long you&#x27;ll have a shelf full of multi-colored bottles and your friends will probably start referring to you as, &amp;</li>
      <li>but I still wish it was more orange and less patchouli (old thrift shop smell).</li>
      <li>The scent was a little pungent, but overall is pleasant enough to burn in my oil burner.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m new to meditating &amp; was looking for something to enhance the experience.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think I can live without.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m excited to try other blends from this company.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re on the fence about trying an essential oil, try this or one of their peppermint oils to begin with and gauge whether or not you&#x27;d like to continue down the slippery slope that is building your own essential oil collection.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s strong stuff - so you only need very little.</li>
      <li>I usually dab a few drops onto my hands and massage them into my neck before I sit down for a session of meditation, I immediately noticed a difference in how quickly I was able to quiet my mind and begin to focus on my breathing.</li>

    <li> This is another oil I have purchased through Edens Gardens and have been very pleased with. The price was very fair, quality is excellent and shipping was very quick. This is a lovely blend of fragrance which I have successfully used for my \\&quot;quiet time\\&quot; ... helpful for meditation or just grabbing a few minutes respite from a busy or hectic day. It&#x27;s a blend that for me is very calming. I would recommend it to anyone who uses oils and fragrance to supplement their various interests. I will buy again and plan on trying their other products as well.</li>
    <li> I tried this blend not knowing what to expect. The smell was overwhelming at first but I am addicted now.  I can get enough of it, works great for relaxation. Definitely will buy again, very nice blend.</li>
    <li> a bit of conflicting fragrances, maybe too many notes put together? would have been preferably to have fewer fragrances mixed in this blend.</li>
    <li> Love it!!! Pleasant,calm and relaxing scent-smells great! After a hard day at work it works good with my spa mist.will purchase this product again .</li>
    <li> A luscious scent and leaves a lovely lingering aroma in the room. Walking into the room the next day after using this oil is a lovely and yummy experience.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite oil. I take it with me everywhere and diffuse it at home. I am pleased so far with Eden&#x27;s Garden oils</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a new comer to the world of essential oils, late to the party as usual I suppose. Anyways I LOVE using this oil (and the many other synergy blends I purchased from Eden&#x27;s Garden on Amazon), I find it stress relieving, relaxing, and useful in cultivating a state of mindfulness in my meditation practice. I usually dab a few drops onto my hands and massage them into my neck before I sit down for a session of meditation, I immediately noticed a difference in how quickly I was able to quiet my mind and begin to focus on my breathing. I&#x27;d recommend this to any student of meditation or anyone looking to indulge their Olfactory lobe with some high-quality scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll appreciate the scent and peace of mind this oil brings, I&#x27;m sure of it. If you&#x27;re on the fence about trying an essential oil, try this or one of their peppermint oils to begin with and gauge whether or not you&#x27;d like to continue down the slippery slope that is building your own essential oil collection. Before long you&#x27;ll have a shelf full of multi-colored bottles and your friends will probably start referring to you as, &amp;#34;That Guy,&amp;#34; or maybe that&#x27;s just me.</li>
    <li> Best in quality, benefit, and cost. The 100% therapeutic grades as well as the Synergy Blends are fabulous. For the price you pay is well worth every penny in beneficial results.</li>
    <li> This blend is perfect for meditation.  I find myself pausing often to inhale the scent and it truly does help me deepen my meditative state.  A great blend.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed in this smell. I bought three oils from Edens Garden and threw two of them away because they gave me a headache. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend meditating with this smell.</li>
    <li> Great product, superb price, fast shipping.....TERRIBLE dropper bottles that waste the product and no way to precisely dispense the correct drops needed. At this time, will not buy again unless the dropper orifice is changed and slowly drops one drop at a time.</li>
    <li> I gave this to a stressed out person who needs to relax after work. She likes it very much and says it is a nice, relaxing fragrance.</li>
    <li> I wish Edens gardens would send small samples of different aromas, so customers don&#x27;t have to wait for the product to arrive only to realize the aroma is not personally compatible.&lt;br /&gt;All Edens Gardens essential oils are good, and not everyone will like every combination. The company is also very good about allowing returns.&lt;br /&gt;I personally don&#x27;t have the time or energy to continually return packages.</li>
    <li> I expected it to smell somewhat like Frankincense but it doesn&#x27;t at all. It smells more like sage and oranges. I bought it because of the good reviews but am not all that excited about it.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite oils from Eden&#x27;s Garden! It&#x27;s very calming. I use it every day!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product bc I&#x27;m new to meditating &amp; was looking for something to enhance the experience. This product is great! I added 10 drops into my oil warmer &amp; it smells really good!&lt;br /&gt;Order arrived early &amp; Edens Garden is very reputable - I would highly recommend them for both quality &amp; service!&lt;br /&gt;YOU ROCK EDENS GARDEN! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I was very please with this product, the speed that it was received, and wonderful fragrance of this blend. I look forward to using this item. Thank you also for the catalog enclosed. and 101 ways to use the essential oils.</li>
    <li> I love this blend! It helps me get focused and calm when I&#x27;ve had a bad day or know it will be a stressful one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve learned one can always trust Edens Garden for quality products that are reasonably priced!. Thanks for not selling junk! This was part of a Valentines gift.</li>
    <li> This is a little strong on patchouli when you sniff it in the bottle, but that quickly fades out and the other scents come forward, makes the house smell great and really is calming.</li>
    <li> I just don&#x27;t care for the scent. Very pungent.</li>
    <li> I have not had dreams in a very long time, and as interesting as it is I use this before I turn in for the night an I dream..&lt;br /&gt;at least I can remember dreaming. I find that if I close my eyes then open and it&#x27;s morning already and it seems like a split second went by and no dreams to remember, it was not a good night of rest... perhaps that is just me, I will buy again before I run out. I don&#x27;t think I can live without. This is just my opinion with this product.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my wife for her meditation time. She loves it. Used each day it helps put her in the frame of mind to settle down and meditate. It&#x27;s strong stuff - so you only need very little. She still has a lot left even after a few months.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a big fan of Patchouli but typically don&#x27;t mind it when it is blended with other scents.  This is product is overwhelmingly patchouli even though there are other oils blended.</li>
    <li> Nice scent to use in my lotion and other body products.Can always count on Edens Garden to make a good product.</li>
    <li> Tried it based on reviews and limited knowledge of some of the oils in this blend. I was slightly hesitant but turned out to be pleasantly surprised.  The orange balances out the Patchouli which can be strong and it really has a nice relaxing / herbal smell. I like it and found myself breathing deeply - (heavy sigh - smile).&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy - try it!</li>
    <li> really disappointed in the scent, not as I expected,  not very strong and must use a lot when mixed into creams</li>
    <li> I have lots of EG&#x27;s synergy blends and I think this is my favorite so far. I don&#x27;t meditate, but I diffuse it in my bedroom. When I open the door, the scent kind of welcome&#x27;s me home from the work day. It&#x27;s a very mellow spicy, sexy fragrance that relax&#x27;s me immediately.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite smelling oil blends.  I use this as a perfume as well as in my diffuser</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m the kind of person who likes a bit of a punch in the scent of my essential oils and I found this one to have a subtle and mild scent that almost disappointed me at first, but now I&#x27;m just about addicted.  This is the kind of aroma that grows on you.  It&#x27;s very refreshing and truly does put me in a more peaceful mood.  I have been difusing it at night to relax, and I&#x27;ve also found a use for it that has not yet been described:  This blend is INCREDIBLE at easing morning sickness.  One or two whiffs and nausea is gone.</li>
    <li> The orange smell is very nice and I do enjoy a lot of the different notes, but I just can&#x27;t get around the patchouli. Its growing on me I guess but I still wish it was more orange and less patchouli (old thrift shop smell).</li>
    <li> I really like this blend. It&#x27;s very strong, though. I definitely cut it with another oil, but that&#x27;s just me. Great product, quick shipping. I&#x27;m excited to try other blends from this company.</li>
    <li> The scent was a little pungent, but overall is pleasant enough to burn in my oil burner.</li>
    <li> Only a few drops make the whole room smell wonderful. I really enjoy smelling this blend of essential oils during meditation and yoga.</li>
    <li> Musky smell. Smells nice</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok but not as consistent as other therapeutic grade myrrh</li>
    <li> Smells so good and used in a diffuser makes my meditation sessions wonderful</li>
    <li> These oils by Eden&#x27;s Garden are not the least bit inferior to doTerra, Melaleuca, or Young Living. I say this because for most essential oil users, quality and purity is a concern, and many are under the impression that you can only get the best by joining an MLM. Many of the praises for Eden’s Garden come from current and / or former DT, Melaleuca, and YL customers. We have also used virtually every MLM essential oil brand known to man, and this is right up there with the best of them in quality and purity, at a fraction of the price. The reason it is a fraction of the price is because it does not have about 3 to 5 levels of compensations for its representatives built into the margins, which drastically reduces the overhead. That is why many former MLM essential oil distributors who still want to use a great product yet can’t afford the network marketing prices and aren’t making any money with them have tried and like Eden’s Garden. From my experience, and countless other essential oil enthusiasts who have also used doTerra, YL, and Melaleuca, there is no difference in quality, purity or smell with Eden’s Garden. If you are one of the 1 - 5% making great money with an MLM, more power to you! But for everyone else, this oil matches up well with the best of them.</li>
    <li> Great oils at a great price. Seller is prompt with shipping and everything is as promised. Loved my oils. The scent is just wonderful and I cant wait to order more! Highly recommend this seller!!</li>
    <li> it is a gift - so haven&#x27;t any comment</li>
    <li> Perfect blend for tranquility!  and meditation!</li>
