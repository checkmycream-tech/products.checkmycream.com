<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great shampoo, great natural smell.  I have very fine hair, and this shampoo gives me much more body than most shampoos.  My grocery store stopped carrying it, so after a few tries of other shampoos, I&#x27;m back to this from Amazon!</li>
    <li> I love the smell. And by using it my hair is shiney and beautiful .</li>
    <li> I love love love this shampoo. It makes my hair shimmer and shine without drying it out (like so many organic shampoos tend to do). And I can&#x27;t even describe how good it smells. I use this shampoo with the pure &amp; natural rosemary mint body wash, so im like a walking herb garden.</li>
    <li> I have to say the product is wonderful...it smells great and is gentle. It does volumize...but I have very thin, damaged, dry hair...and it gives me softness, and more body. But I still have to use the frizz ease (the extra strenght formula) to ease the frizz. While it doesn&#x27;t cure the frizz...it does soften and give body. Which is good.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s good for your hair.It can prevent hair loss and make hair more shine.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo. Smell is great. Packaging is the only problem. Twice it has happened that the bottles leak in the box because the bottle caps are not sealed correctly.</li>
    <li> The strong rosemary perks me up and works well to counteract the chlorine after swimming.</li>
    <li> This might be my least favorite shampoo/conditioner combo ever... Yes, I suppose there was volume added, but it made my hair feel gummy and heavy and didn&#x27;t really move naturally anymore. I couldn&#x27;t even make it to half the bottle and just got rid of it cause it felt so blah. I do have thicker hair so i don&#x27;t really need this added volume anyhow, but still I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product if you or anyone else is going to be running your fingers through your hair. Plus, don&#x27;t be fooled by the name Organics, this is by no means an organic product.</li>
    <li> Very little soap required to clean hair. Nice fragrance, great price for buying two. Happy to recommend it. I have long hair, so appreciate a soap that rinses out easily.</li>
    <li> I did not buy this from Amazon instead I got it from my local supermarket. But it&#x27;s still the same product. First I would like to say that I bought this product because of the good reviews I saw for it on amazon. But unfortunately I was led to disappoint as this product definitely did not work for me. The shampoo left my hair feeling okay, it wasn&#x27;t soft but not super dry or stripped either. Then I put the conditioner in my hair and that&#x27;s when it all went down hill. My hair instantly became stiff and rough. The conditioner is not moisturizing or detangling at all. I could barely run my fingers through my hair so after about 5mins I rinsed the conditioner out and put a pea size amount of my Shea moisture coconut and hibiscus style milk in my hair and it really helped to loosen it up so I could at least detangle. When I woke up the next morning my hair was slightly soft but also felt slightly stiff but not super dry. I am giving 2 stars because it did give me some thickness and little volume. Also the shampoo contains sodium coco-sulfate. Which is none the less a sulfate. I have fine Caucasian hair that&#x27;s about a 2b (wavy.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tl;dr&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does not work for everyone, it can potentially dry your hair out and give little to no volume. contains a sulfate.</li>
    <li> I have ALOT of very fine hair.  Most shampoos really weigh my hair down and make it look flat and dull.  This shampoo is awesome.  My absolute favortie.  I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the conditioner and instead use natures gate henna conditioner.  The combination makes my hair look great.  The smell is amazing as well.  Great to wake up to in the morning.</li>
    <li> This shampoo has become my favorite.  After washing my hair feels \\&quot;soooo\\&quot; clean and smells wonderful.  Avalon Organics is the best shampoo I have ever used.</li>
    <li> In an effort to become healthy and to help the planet, I have gone organic.  I had planned to ditch my chemically laden shampoo for the organic replacement.  This is definitely not a replacement.  I have fine, but very curly hair. I used the Avalon Shampoo last night and let my hair dry.  The next morning I had flat hair with no curl, whatsoever.  Sorry planet, but I have to go back to my old shampoo, in order to be seen in public.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is a great find for us.  I struggle with Seborrhea Dermatitis and this shampoo is so very helpful!</li>
    <li> Pretty good stuff and animal safe. Smell is inoffensive.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of short curly grey hair.  It is not coarse but it is thick.  It is fine in texture.  This is unusual for curly hair. Thus, a volumizing shampoo helps me a great deal because it overcomes  the fineness tendency to just lay there.  Good as the result is, the smell of Avalon Organic Rosemary is just fantastic in the shower.  It is a real treat to inhale this odor throughout your shower, almost like aromatherapy.  Your hair feels wonderful after shampooing with this shampoo and it does add the promised volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com). Friday&#x27;s entry will always be weekend entertainment recs from my 5 star Amazon reviews in film, tv, books and music. These are very heavy on buried treasures and hidden gems. My blogspot is published on Monday, Wednesday &amp; Friday.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really feel that it&#x27;s volumizing my hair and I also must shampoo daily because it does leave my hair oily. The smell is kind of strong as well and takes some getting use to! Amazon also shipped it loose in a box and the bottle had opened and half of it had spilled all over-ugh!!!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the product yet, but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s good because I&#x27;ve tried other Avalon Organics products and they are absolutely wonderful. But when these bottles arrived they were packaged well, but still leaking inside the separate package amazon wrapped them in! I mean I lost a 1/4 of 1 bottle and a 1/3 of the 2nd bottle! It was hard getting it out of the pkg. with it a drippy mess and then I had to rinse the bottles &amp; my counter &amp; hands because it was a shampoo mess. Avalon Organics has to come up with a better, tighter cap fit. Thought others should know. I can count on 1 hand the problems that I have had with Amazon, so this surprised me. But I think its Avalon Organics problem.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo (along with the conidtioner) and it is lovely. I love the smell of Rosemary, so I had to try this stuff. I also love Avalon Organics.&lt;br /&gt;I have thick, long hair so I had to use a bit more then most people probably do. The shampoo kind of takes a few minutes to lather up on me, but once it got going it created a nice thick lather. It rinsed easily, and if it weren&#x27;t for the conditioner my hair would have been hard to comb out. The Shampoo isn&#x27;t enough for us long haired gals and you definetly need to use a conditioner. After using the conditioner, my hair was much more manageable. The scent is great, and even my already thick hair turned out even thicker after using these products. Also got some good shine from this. Very gentle on the scalp, and leaves your hair feeling clean and fresh. Will be buying again.</li>
    <li> It is an ok shampoo. Made my hair feel dry. For some reason, my hsir, a dark blonde, came out looking dark brown! Don&#x27;t like that</li>
    <li> The shipping was fast. But when I got my shipment both of the bottles had poured out, the package was wet. Don&#x27;t know why! 😒</li>
    <li> This shampoo gives my hair a clean feel, no frizz and no residue.  I don&#x27;t need an extra conditioner even in the winter.  The scent is an added bonus.</li>
    <li> Love the shampoo !! We bought a bottle at TJ Maxx, and you know they rarely have the same products twice, so when I went back to try and purchase more, they were out. Was pleasantly surprised to find it on Amazon !! Bought 4 bottles and am very happy. The items were shipped very fast !!</li>
    <li> I like all the Avalon products and this is my favorite one, if you use it for a long time you can see the different. I feel like my hair&#x27;s natural forms comes back, I had a normal hair type (teenager years) after using chemicals for long time,  My hair had change to dry bush type of looking hair. I have fine straight hair, after using Avalon products, my hair gets her normal form silky. I really happy with this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this shampoo. I am not normally a fan of scented products but this smells good. But, this shampoo caused me to get red splotches all around my face where the shampoo had touched it. At first  I didn&#x27;t realize the shampoo was causing it. I have sensitive skin, but have never had any other product cause a reaction. Will try to post pictures. I would steer clear of this product.</li>
    <li> I have tried lots and lots of shampoos for my fairly fine hair. This one really does the job.&lt;br /&gt;It does have a strong rosemary scent which can be a bit overwhelming at first. I like the very clean scent.&lt;br /&gt;Good price. I buy mine at a local health food store and get a discount there. If you can&#x27;t find it locally, then buy it through Amazon.</li>
    <li> Though it smells lovely and I honor the ethos of the company and have been happy with other Avalon shampoos in the past, I thought this shampoo was awful. It left my hair &amp;#34;volumized&amp;#34; which in my case means hair that felt like waxed straw.</li>
    <li> I like the scent of this shampoo, but sometimes it leaves my hair feeling squeaky. I prefer the lemon for function, the Rosemary for scent. Lately I&#x27;ve been alternating them.</li>
    <li> I like how it cleans and makes my hair feel. Didn&#x27;t take it in vacation and miss it. No more nonorganic shampoo for me.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff. I used it every day for about 6 months, and then recently switched to something with more moisture as my ends were getting dry. Maybe if this shampoo had an added moisturizer it would be better for permanent use</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried tons of other shampoos but I always come back to this one. I actually mix in organic oils to make my own 2-1 conditioning shampoo, and my hair looks great--this stuff is so much gentler than alot of regular chemical-laden shampoos, and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue on my hair. It does take some getting used to if you aren&#x27;t used to natural hair products, and it can take a little while for your scalp to adjust, but once it does, it&#x27;s well worth it in my opinion. Totally recommend.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo! The rosemary is an excellent scent.  I was reading that rosemary helps with memory, so I decided to try it and its definately a great deal!</li>
    <li> I first found this item while visiting in Texas. The shampoo is very rich and makes my hair feel great. Hard to find here, and then I discovered I could buy it through Amazon. Received it quickly and it is very affordable. I would definitely recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> Product does what it says it will do. very satisfied with the body this shampoo gives my hair. I have very little hair on top of my head, but what hair i do have, this shampoo is great for extra body.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful , leaves my hair glossy and gets me many compliments.&lt;br /&gt;I really love it! My hair looks visibly healthier in a few days.</li>
    <li> not as fragrant as expected</li>
    <li> Like the product, but am unable to use it all the time.</li>
    <li> I often have difficulty finding this product near my home so this is a convenient option. Product is very good, packaging leaked a little bit.</li>
    <li> Great scent, but doesn&#x27;t really lather.  After 3-4 days....hair felt heavy.  Perhaps if you had excessively dry hair this would be ideal; not for me.</li>
    <li> The brand alone sold me.  I wanted to try something different than what I previously used (different brand).  I love natural products, but they do tend to cost more than the well known brands that you can get from the super market.  So the price and rating of this rosemary shampoo caught my eye.  Great lather.  Great smell.  Good results.  Not anything dramatic.  My hair was healthy before... and it remained in great health after switching to this one.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this shampoo-and teenagers know everything!&lt;br /&gt; Seriously it makes her hair silky and smell nice.  I have to admit I use it too.</li>
    <li> it is hard to find organic and i love the smell. I like how it feels after shampoo. the price is cheaper than wholefood.</li>
    <li> My wife often laughs at me for purchasing a more expensive shampoo to cleanse what little is left of the hair on my head. I explain that this is not only for the hair, but to keep my scalp in good condition as well. Many other products clogged the pores in my scalp or irritated it. This product does not. It leaves me with a clean, invigorated feeling every time. I highly recommend it for men in a similar situation.</li>
    <li> My husband developed an allergy to ammonium sulfate in other, cheaper shampoos.  This works great, no sensitivity to the product and his hair looks great.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Have used it for years.  Good shampoo for thin hair.</li>
    <li> Not every product is right for every person.  Personally, I won&#x27;t buy this one again.  It makes my hair so flat, it&#x27;s awful.  It also dries out my hair and takes the shine out of it, making the gray more obvious.  And I personally dislike the smell.    I was really distressed about how my hair looked for the past six weeks and nearly had six inches cut off my hair last week because I thought the length was what was making it look so bad.  I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t.  Just a single wash with my old shampoo yesterday and when I walked past the mirror last night I did a double-take.  My hair looked brown and shiny again.  And not quite as flat.  I guess a few more shampoos with the old one and it will start looking fuller again.  Apparently this shampoo dries my normally very oily hair and the light doesn&#x27;t reflect off it as well, thereby making the gray more obvious.    I&#x27;m glad other people are happy with it, but this one just didn&#x27;t work for me. Rosemary oil may be a great product for hair in general, but there is at least one other ingredient in this particular shampoo that definitely doesn&#x27;t do my hair any favors.  And \\&quot;organic\\&quot; or not, if a shampoo says it amplifies or volumizes, it should do that--at least a little!  This product helps some people, but didn&#x27;t benefit mine.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is wonderful. It leaves my hair clean, soft and very shiny. I just use a tiny amount and it does a great job.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband that needed a little help thickening his hair in the front and he loves that it doesn&#x27;t make him itch.</li>
    <li> Really like this shampoo a lot...will order it again!</li>
    <li> This is a mostly organic product, but truthfully I didn&#x27;t notice that until after I got it. I got it because it smells great and it is not a scent that I am allergic too. Found that it works great too when combined with the conditioner. So I bought several more.</li>
    <li> Meijer&#x27;s discontinued this, so I now order it by the multi-pack via Amazon.  This is the best shampoo I have ever used!  I wash it at night, and go to bed with my hair wet.  In the morning, my hair is luscious and fluffy, and smells amazing.  My hair&#x27;s body has never been this perfect.  My hair tends to get greasy very quickly, and this shampoo actually lets me go longer between washes without my hair looking and feeling disgusting.  Even people who tell me they can&#x27;t stand rosemary tell me my hair smells great.&lt;br /&gt;Do you know how hard it is to find rosemary-scented body care products that don&#x27;t also contain mint? It&#x27;s obnoxious! This is straight up rosemary, and I love it.</li>
    <li> Smells great and keep my dad hair looking young again.</li>
    <li> Smells good and does what it&#x27;s suppose to do.</li>
    <li> 4 stars because product is great but they don&#x27;t seal the caps. When I got my shipment one of the bottles had poured out all over my other products. That was a bummer!!!</li>
    <li> Leaves hair soft and the smell is nice and not overpowering.</li>
