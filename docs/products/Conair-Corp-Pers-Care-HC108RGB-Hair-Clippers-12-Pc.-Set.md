      <li>Good product of good quality, highly recommend.</li>
      <li>i think it should have some type of case or bag that wounld be alot better to have</li>
      <li>So this was what we got, and it more than suffices.</li>
      <li>most parts of the U.S.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m satisfied with the results.</li>
      <li>, I like it:)</li>
      <li>It will do the job but dont expect a top notch machine.</li>
      <li>I am on here researching a better product.</li>
      <li>Make sure you are getting what is in the picture</li>
      <li>Spend alittle more and get better clippers</li>
      <li>[but I had to buy an additional #8/one-inch guide, which doesn&#x27;t come with most sets].</li>
      <li>Buy more oil!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great accessories.</li>
      <li>Saves me money thats for sure.  </li>
      <li>satisfied with w/purchase</li>
      <li>Love all the conair products.</li>
      <li>Extra attachments are perfect  size.</li>
      <li>its ok...</li>
      <li>I will return it to Amazon and if I won&#x27;t be able to, it will be thrown to the trash.</li>
      <li>i have an older con-air that works great, and i just needed the attachments for it.</li>
      <li>giving 5 stars for a hair clipper is not that easy as it means that &amp;#34;I LOVE it&amp;#34;  ....how can one LOVE a hair clipper?????.....</li>
      <li>Very loud compared to others but cuts great.</li>
      <li>so if the fancier one lasts you 4 years it will be worth it - plus you can expect better performance!</li>
      <li>Comfortable to hold and cuts evenly, what more could you ask for?</li>
      <li>The pieces fit nicely and the clean up is easy.</li>
      <li>low price, easy to use, good!</li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d have bought a different one, and happily paid more, if I could have found another that not manufactured there.</li>
      <li>this is easy to use ....</li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a pretty great product and as long as it gets the job done, I&#x27;m good.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty much just the newer model of mine and it works great.</li>
      <li>It works just fine.</li>
      <li>When I tried it, it worked just fine.</li>
      <li>Totally fine.</li>
      <li>and when I am finished I have huge patches of un cut hair, so I then have to take my fingers and hold up the hair</li>
      <li>The summer is when these come into their own, and I can just about do the whole haircut myself</li>
      <li>Has a cheap feel to it.</li>
      <li>Feels kinda cheap, because it is.</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t fit these.</li>
      <li>Gives great, simple hair cuts.</li>
      <li>This is probably just a cheap model.</li>
      <li>I have used clippers that have an extendable blade to give you a precise length, but these clippers do not have that feature.</li>
      <li>Great for the low price!</li>
      <li>Great value for money -- would definitely recommend it.</li>
      <li>I would make the point to how important is to lubricate the blades before use it, it comes with the oil, so there&#x27;s no excuses.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a great deal - even if you are not a professional</li>
      <li>The old one was fancier and thus cost a lot more than my latest purchase.</li>
      <li>I use them to give myself an edge up every 2 to 3 weeks or so &amp; a clean shave.</li>
      <li>I follow up with a razor for a Mr. Clean finish.</li>
      <li>Also, I don&#x27;t see a way to clean the hair in some areas because it gets stuck on the sticky surface.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> They work great but the attachments are not accurate to length I cut my sons hair and selected a 1/2 inch and it was more like a 1/4 inch and other attachments from our other conair clippers don&#x27;t fit these.</li>
    <li> excellent hair cut and fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Love all the conair products. Great value for money -- would definitely recommend it. The 1 star lost is for the power adjustment screw.. have not figured that one out --- aka not sure what the optimal setting is...but works good.</li>
    <li> Not good for precision work. Don&#x27;t like it.  Motor not powerful at all.  Doesn&#x27;t cut thick hair well.</li>
    <li> Pure garbage. Extremely noisy. Can&#x27;t adjust the trimmers. Have tried this for 1 minute, woke up all the house and straight to the garbage can.</li>
    <li> well worth the money...  cheaper than anything in the stores around here</li>
    <li> Broke within a week. Not much else to say.</li>
    <li> I am happy with this hair clipper. It gets the job done as far as I&#x27;m concerned. I would recommend it especially at this low price.</li>
    <li> For the price it&#x27;s just what we were looking for to keep our hair trimmed.</li>
    <li> It works very well for me. I don&#x27;t need any of the attachments as I clip my hair as short as possible.</li>
    <li> This is one of the worst clippers I have every bought. I could not even use it to cut hair due the exessive noise that the motor makes and not including the unecssary vibration. I guess I got for what I paid for. Spend alittle more and get better clippers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good thing is that Amazon was greatful to refund my charge.</li>
    <li> Simple and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Decent quality, simple hair trimmer.</li>
    <li> Gives great, simple hair cuts. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> A little noisier than my previous one, but if you follow the directions and adjust power screw these clippers work very well.</li>
    <li> clogs constantly. i have an older con-air that works great, and i just needed the attachments for it. i bought this model for the attachments, but tried o ut the razor anyway. this razor sucks. dont buy this if  you have more than about 10 hairs to sheer.</li>
    <li> Fairly basic electric shaver, but meets all the criteria, and very much worth the price.  I&#x27;ve been using a few weeks now, no problems thus far!</li>
    <li> What a pain.  It doesn&#x27;t work, and when I plug it in and turn it on and off it throws the breaker on the outlet.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Extra attachments are perfect  size.</li>
    <li> I like it. And got it on time.. thank you</li>
    <li> I bought four of these as gifts for clients at a mens homeless shelter. They fit nicely into the mens backpacks, and the men say that, they are great for beards and hair.</li>
    <li> I have used it twice, it works very smooth and very well. Hope it can be used for a long time, I like it:)</li>
    <li> Easy, cheap, great. No complaints, it does the work properly. I would make the point to how important is to lubricate the blades before use it, it comes with the oil, so there&#x27;s no excuses. If you don&#x27;t do this then is going to be a bit hard to cut your hair, and is going to pull a bit.</li>
    <li> I have cut my hair a dozen times with this budget Conair clipper. It never worked well from the start. First I use the product like one should and when I am finished I have huge patches of un cut hair, so I then have to take my fingers and hold up the hair like I am pulling on it tightly and take the Conair through the hair, with my fingers in the way it doesn&#x27;t cut as short and the hair that was cut normally, but trust me this product will not cut a lot of your hair without doing this. I am on here researching a better product. Will never buy any Conair product again.</li>
    <li> It works just fine. It&#x27;s not fancy, but it is functional. It is just what I needed for the price.</li>
    <li> Not happy with the way it cuts. Pulls hair, and have to go over the same area a few times just to get a even shave.</li>
    <li> I use this to shave my head when it gets too long to shave it with a razor easily. I follow up with a razor for a Mr. Clean finish. I can&#x27;t attest to its performance with longer hair since I haven&#x27;t had a full head of hair in a long time. It&#x27;s not very noisy and it doesn&#x27;t vibrate that badly.</li>
    <li> Buy a new computer. And they sent me a used one. The machine heats up and can not do their job.</li>
    <li> My last Conair haircutter lasted over 10 years, when it blew up I got this substitute. I knew Conair products are trustable and that&#x27;s why I got a unit made by the same manufacturer. The old one was fancier and thus cost a lot more than my latest purchase. In the long run both do the job and I&#x27;m satisfied with the results.</li>
    <li> This was inexpensive it does the job. I have been cutting my own hair for years. I also cut my sons hair.</li>
    <li> First time buying this brand. I thought it strange that it needed prep work before using it. I wasn&#x27;t sure if I turn that key to the correct position, which made me a bit nervous. Not a fan of having to oil the blades every so often and not sure where to get the oil once it runs out (because you can&#x27;t use just any type). Also, I don&#x27;t see a way to clean the hair in some areas because it gets stuck on the sticky surface. When I tried it, it worked just fine. Not sure I&#x27;ll buy this again.</li>
    <li> Very basic clippers. Quality seems consistent with the price.&lt;br /&gt;Couldn&#x27;t cut my thick hair-would get jammed instantly. Maybe my hair was too thick. Had to go to a barber-so much for saving money.&lt;br /&gt;Could possibly still be good for touch ups.</li>
    <li> Arrive early, worked just as expected. I actually bought this for my cat. Great for the low price! I do recommended for young boys or men who doesn&#x27;t want to spend 300 on shavers!</li>
    <li> this product is not good.</li>
    <li> I love it! Its good for trimming the mustache and beard to cutting hair. I truly love this product! Great Price!</li>
    <li> I was on line looking at trimmers to see about adding some additional attachments to the ones I currently have - saw this one review and thought it worthy to give kuddos to where kuddos are due (since the one other review gave it such a poor review)...   I have had this since the fall of 2005 --- to present October 2011 --- Same blades --- never had had to replace anything --- even haircuts... and blown away to see how little it costs to pay for this --- HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
    <li> I have world&#x27;s most disgusting cat...really, she&#x27;s terrible. She was in desperate need of a shave, so we purchased this. I didn&#x27;t want to make a big investment. We had no issues with the shaver. Now we have a less hairy, sort of less disgusting cat. Yay.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re someone who is looking to shave their hair down, this is a great product. I have been maintaining my mohawk with it for about six months now, and I really like it! Comfortable to hold and cuts evenly, what more could you ask for?</li>
    <li> Stopped working after 3 trims.... It locked up and ripped hair out</li>
    <li> Got this for my husband who cuts his hair about every 2-3 weeks!! Good price it will save us money on haircuts for sure!!</li>
    <li> I never expected I would get so many pieces for this less money. Definitely a money saver n it works awesome..</li>
    <li> When you or someone you know keeps a buzz cut, this is an extremely useful item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In most parts of the U.S. it costs less than one haircut at a barber&#x27;s shop. So, even assuming you get only two or three uses from the item, it would be worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the fact is, the buzzer lasts longer than that, despite the complaints of others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For anyone on a tight budget, and wanting a buzz, this will more than do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its major disadvantage is the fact that the item is made in China. I&#x27;d have bought a different one, and happily paid more, if I could have found another that not manufactured there. Alas, I didn&#x27;t have hours to search. So this was what we got, and it more than suffices.</li>
    <li> I just needed some clippers to cut my sons hair and shave the side of my daughter and my head and it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my husband. He seems to like it. When I asked him how he liked it, he replied &amp;#34;it cuts.&amp;#34; Enough said.</li>
    <li> I didnt expect much when I ordered this, I got what I paid for.&lt;br /&gt;First one died after about ten uses. Second one barely works right out of the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didnt even bother to return it, I bought a new one from another brand.</li>
    <li> Nice item. Good price.</li>
    <li> After a few uses, the Conair started skipping and despite oiling the machine it continued to do so.  Do not buy if you have normal or thick hair as it wouldn&#x27;t cut despite being on the highest power setting.  Look for another that is better made and actually cuts hair without the pain :(</li>
    <li> Good value for the money.</li>
    <li> Good buy compared to blade replacement costs. But the &amp;#34;self-sharpening blade&amp;#34; was not my experience -- mine became dull.</li>
    <li> I got what I expected</li>
    <li> Clipper blades did not work properly. Attached is an image of how it cut. I am unable to return it, but will be getting different clippers.</li>
    <li> These clippers stopped working on first try</li>
    <li> This tine sounds like a train is coming at you and doesn&#x27;t work at all and it&#x27;s going to cost me more to send it back than its original cost</li>
    <li> Considering I pay 20$ each time I see the barber, and these clippers lasted a whole 3 haircuts...i guess i got my money&#x27;s worth out of them. However I would never purchase them again. If you need a 7$ 1 size haircut these are for you.</li>
    <li> Simple and inexpensive clippers. They serve their purpose well.</li>
    <li> great product for its price, does exactly what i want, totally recommended</li>
    <li> Good for short thin hair. If your like me and have thick hair, be weary, it likes to jam alot and rip out your hair</li>
    <li> Works great, quitter than my previous clippers.</li>
    <li> Used it once, and the blades seized when went to use it 5 days later. Had a Remington that was unable to find blades for anymore and decided to buy this. But, used it once and now it does not work after buzzed my head once. Terrible product, thoroughly disappointed with Conair, used to make good products.</li>
    <li> I do my own hair cuts.  I have purchased 3 razors in the last 2 years because the blades get too dull.  This one cost just a bit more, but, so far, the blades have remained just as sharp as when I bought the unit.</li>
    <li> Excellent haircut..... easy to handle, very good quality that has always characterized Conair....very professional. . . . 100% recommended.. Ty</li>
    <li> Great product fast shipping, but was missing the soft pouch it stated it came with, that is A big pet peeve of mine send everything in the ad, false advertisement smh.</li>
    <li> The produce is perfect.  However, I could not find the soft storage pouch. Could you send me a storage pouch? Thanks!</li>
    <li> good. while the plug is not as good as I think</li>
    <li> Very good machine, but a little big.</li>
    <li> Great product. Definitely got my money&#x27;s worth</li>
    <li> This hire cutter makes a large noise. It&#x27;s very annoying to have something like a motor engine besides your ear.&lt;br /&gt;This is why I have used it for only once.</li>
    <li> The razor shaved the left side of my head and then clogged up. I walked around for the rest of the day with half a head of hair. Don&#x27;t get this...</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t heavy duty enough, my son&#x27;s hair is really thick and it just stopped the blades, couldn&#x27;t use them.</li>
    <li> This should last forever, just make sure to oil it. Buy more oil!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great accessories. Cant go wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it daily.</li>
    <li> love it so much ,i can haircut my self</li>
    <li> Booty, broke using it the first try</li>
    <li> Great product.... excellent</li>
    <li> Feels kinda cheap, because it is. It&#x27;ll do the job, but I knew the first time I turned it on that it&#x27;s not going to last 10 years like my old $40 one. I&#x27;ve been buzzing my head for close to 20 years.</li>
    <li> This clipper gave me mediocre performance and conked out after a year and a half of light use - regular beard trimming but never haircuts. I might upgrade to the ~$25 price-point clippers (Conair, Wahl) if you&#x27;re gonna use one of these regularly.  $9.99/1.5 &#x3D; $25/3.75 so if the fancier one lasts you 4 years it will be worth it - plus you can expect better performance!</li>
    <li> Works great, comes with sizes #1-#5, scissors, and other accessories. It&#x27;s a pretty great product and as long as it gets the job done, I&#x27;m good.</li>
    <li> Stalls a little when cutting thicker hair but as long as you take your time they work great.</li>
    <li> First, this is the second cutter that I bought here. Conair makes a great product but when I opened up the item it was not the same cutter as in the picture. I kept it only because it worked fine and I didn&#x27;t have the time to exchange it as I had to use it as soon as it came.  Make sure you are getting what is in the picture</li>
    <li> Receive these clippers on time and blades are sharp. Great deal</li>
    <li> Did not come with Cape or case as specified- was the reason I ordered this set.</li>
    <li> Good product of good quality, highly recommend. Very good price as well.</li>
    <li> it was fear you get what you pay for</li>
    <li> very dull . can&#x27;t even use them</li>
    <li> I got a pair of these in 2013. And they still work like a charm! I use them to give myself an edge up every 2 to 3 weeks or so &amp; a clean shave. Idk how good they are for more use then that. But I haven&#x27;t had one problem outta mine. Plus u don&#x27;t need batteries!  Plug them in &amp; go! I recommend this one someone who just wants some clippers for a little shave or edge up.</li>
    <li> clippers would jam, pull hair, and make a very loud noise I adjusted them but they just quit working. Spend a little more and get a better pair.</li>
    <li> Exactly what it says on the tin. Excellent quality for the price.</li>
    <li> Did the job, good quality!</li>
    <li> worst hair clipper ever. there is a strange Screw that you have to turn to operate, trips the breaker( others don&#x27;t) and the WORST part is it is extremely loud</li>
    <li> A great deal for the price chippers are light weight easy to handle the set was half the price of one hair cut I will not be going to barber anytime soon...</li>
    <li> Great clippers for the price. This is my third pair in 15 years, and I use them all the time. Why pay more for extra do-dads and fancy packaging?</li>
    <li> Not very powerful. a  lot smaller than I thought they would be.</li>
    <li> These clippers are awful. I barely even used them because they were SO deafening. They&#x27;re huge and heavy. I can&#x27;t imagine navigating near ears or small spots that need detail or nuance. Save your money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my hair for over 10 years. I have also cut about 10 friends&#x27; hair. These clippers are a great value. They are quiet, and the set includes enough size attachments to fit your trimming needs. I have used clippers that have an extendable blade to give you a precise length, but these clippers do not have that feature. Instead, using the included comb to blend the residual lines works just as well.</li>
    <li> for the price you cant beat it. this is my second. first lasted 4 years.</li>
    <li> Nice low price, and did the job equally well; with light blades that cut low and under normal circumstances very even cutting with minimal pulling for longer and diverse hair types!</li>
    <li> this is a very good product</li>
    <li> Unable to find proper power screw adjustment.  I am a balding man and use clippers without guards to cut my hair. These clippers snag and pull my hair.</li>
    <li> Although I rarely write a product review, I had to come to the defense of this little Conair clipper. I&#x27;ve used mine with satisfaction for years, and mainly for trims between barbershop haircuts. They work very well IF YOU KEEP THEM OILED. I suspect the reviewer who was so harshly critical did not keep the blades lightly oiled. If you don&#x27;t they will indeed push through the hair and do little cutting. If well-oiled, they glide through and clip neatly. FYI--my regular haircut is about three inhces on top, an inch on the sides in winter, but clipped to an inch on top and a half inch on the sides in summer. The summer is when these come into their own, and I can just about do the whole haircut myself [but I had to buy an additional #8/one-inch guide, which doesn&#x27;t come with most sets].</li>
    <li> The listing says it comes with a barber cape and soft case, which it does not. If I had know this I would not have ordered it! Very unsatisfied!</li>
    <li> not a sharp blade at all</li>
    <li> Need to be more powerful, but does the job if you take the time to go over and over several times.</li>
    <li> Not the best clipper. Has a cheap feel to it. It will do the job but dont expect a top notch machine.</li>
    <li> BOUGHT IT FOR MY DOG, OTHERWISE IS VERY MEDIOCRE, THE CUTTING IS SO SO, I WILL NOT BUY IT FOR PEOPLE&lt;br /&gt;BECAUSE IT IS NOT GOOD FOR THEM.</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t really the kinda I thought it was, but I haven&#x27;t tried yet so I can&#x27;t tell how good it is.</li>
    <li> CUTS HAIR WITH EASE!!!</li>
    <li> Cheap material, hard, blades adjusting not easy, small blades, poor finishing, just ok for the price $10.00 , not heavy duty .</li>
    <li> Pulls hair, broke after 3 uses</li>
    <li> It worked as expected, only reason I returned as i wanted cord less one.</li>
    <li> I thought I was ordering a cordless clipper.</li>
    <li> I have thin hair and the cutter some times got stuck mid cut.  When trimming my beard with a #1, it also would occasionally get caught up and pull at the hair as opposed to cutting it.  Needless to say I have taken the guards and put them back on my old trimmer which is also a Conair.  This is probably just a cheap model.</li>
    <li> i like it i think it should have some type of case or bag that wounld be alot better to have</li>
    <li> PESIMO ABRI EL PAQUETE Y VINO DAÑADA NO ENCIENDE</li>
    <li> I should have known by the price. This has a really hard time cutting through hair.</li>
    <li> This machine, although being very cheap, just don&#x27;t do the job. Not even close!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The machine just don&#x27;t cut well (understatement). I ended up with not satisfying results. Absolutely disastrous!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moreover, It is very noisy and it vibrates while you hold it in a very disturbing manner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have any use for that kind of junk. I will return it to Amazon and if I won&#x27;t be able to, it will be thrown to the trash. As simple as that.</li>
    <li> Not a great tool, but it delivers as promised and cuts hair. Not a purchase I would repeat, will probably spend another$10 to get the next step up.</li>
    <li> Broke during first hair cut. Most awful experience ever. It breaks half way in. On start it sounded like it was going to break. First one didn&#x27;t even work, but they sent me a new one free, at no extra cost. Good company, bad product</li>
    <li> Very loud compared to others but cuts great.</li>
    <li> Got it from a local store. The blade stopped moving half way of the hair cut....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It obviously can&#x27;t handle fine hair.</li>
    <li> cheap, but totally worth the price, i use this extensively and have had no issues. i was very surprised with this purchase, buy.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really terrible. If you have slightly thick hair, it just won&#x27;t cut it. Unless you go really slow, and then it&#x27;ll feel like it&#x27;s pulling your hair out. Maybe I should have known because of the price. Still, it&#x27;ll be worth it to you to spend the little bit of extra money on something nicer.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly when cutting my hair.  Saves me money thats for sure.  The pieces fit nicely and the clean up is easy.</li>
    <li> Got this for my husband, as a back up cause we packed his up my mistake, its ok... but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> It will cut your hair, but very under powered. At $10 I think it&#x27;s over priced.</li>
    <li> I liked the price of this hair clipper and the fact that I received it the day after ordering but during the first haircut, it starting making a really loud sound that only went away by banging it on the counter. This happened with my previous hair cutter but only after 2 years of use.</li>
    <li> Best clippers for the cash! Five stars!</li>
    <li> The thing sounds and feels like like a jack hammer!!! I am almost afraid to use it. Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> This is a piece of junk.  I&#x27;m not happy with it at all.  It pulls the hair and literally leaves red streaks on the skin and welts too.  I bought this for my husband and he can&#x27;t even use it.  I wasted money on this purchase.  I&#x27;ve never had an issue with Conair until now.  Very upset.</li>
    <li> These clippers are nothing special.  It comes with the necessary attachments, I consider it reliable, but it is a little noisy.  I&#x27;ve owned them for 2 months now.</li>
    <li> giving 5 stars for a hair clipper is not that easy as it means that &amp;#34;I LOVE it&amp;#34;  ....how can one LOVE a hair clipper?????.....but it works great, easy to use , so it&#x27;s a great deal - even if you are not a professional this is easy to use .... Buzz cuts... here we go</li>
    <li> When I cut my hair I use a clipper like this with no guard so almost all the hair is gone but a stubble. I can&#x27;t speak to how good of a haircutting kit this is if you&#x27;re attempting more to achieve a more difficult style. But I personally couldn&#x27;t be happier with a Con-Air brand clipper for only $10. All the money I will save on haircuts will pay for it dozens of times over. A five star value.</li>
    <li> Ok at best.  I&#x27;ve have owned this clipper model for several years and recently had to replace it.  I figured why not get the same one but it seems the quality is going downhill.  A quick trim now requires multiple trips to catch missed hairs.  I question its long term quality.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT FOR THE PRICE AND BRAND NAME YOU CAN TRUST.</li>
    <li> It was good produce for price.</li>
    <li> Very good for the price.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this crappy thing, 10 dollars on the trash can.</li>
    <li> The product ceased functioning halfway through my haircut, forcing me to pay for a 3rd party to finish the job.</li>
    <li> Great clipper for grooming small dog with ease</li>
    <li> The motor is not very strong so this  does not work well for thick hair.</li>
    <li> Great clippers. Gets the job done. They heat up a little bit, but they work. And they come with good accessories</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once so far but it worked great and the product itself is half the cost of getting a haircut so it&#x27;s already paid for itself.</li>
    <li> It is just like all other Conair trimmers. It has a hard time shaving thru think hair. It gets the job done but it takes a little longer to use than barber grade trimmer.</li>
    <li> Still use it a year later! no issues! take good care of your products and theyll take good care of you!</li>
    <li> It works very well for cutting your hair,but is quite inefective  if you try to shave with it.</li>
    <li> I have used a Conair trimmer for years and bought this since the price was so low. It&#x27;s pretty much just the newer model of mine and it works great. I&#x27;m pretty sad I waited this long, it cuts like butter!</li>
    <li> low price, easy to use, good!</li>
    <li> My other cutter&#x27;s blades were getting dull so it was time for a new one and since I use it on my mini Schnauzer I did not want to spend a lot of money.  WOW!!!  Was I impressed how this cuts!  Great product, great price!</li>
    <li> Good product. satisfied with w/purchase</li>
    <li> Totally fine. Gets the job done. Cheap, but still totally sufficient. However, it&#x27;s worth noting that I don&#x27;t care much about my appearance, so if you are a real fashionista, you may feel differently.</li>
    <li> If i could put a zero i would this product is not go at all stay away barbers...my husband was not happy at all</li>
    <li> Good value. It vibrates quite a bit. I&#x27;ve done 3 buzz cuts so far, no issues.</li>
