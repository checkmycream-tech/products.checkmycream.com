      <li>Love the sulcabrush though.</li>
      <li>While shipping was more than the holder itself, even my dentist who gave me the brush had never seen the holder.</li>
      <li>Better than trying to wrap it in something else since it is a custom fit.</li>
      <li>Very useful for traveling.</li>

      <li>I found the travel pouch hard to open the first time but other than that it is a good accessory to have.</li>
      <li>They clearly didn&#x27;t look at their product before they shipped it out.</li>
      <li>Check out also Shift Network Living Libations woman for super-dental helpfulness beyond old paradigm 20th century ways</li>
      <li>I order 2 and one never closed properly and therfore is not usable.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;--The PRICE certainly reflects the combination as well.&lt;br /&gt;--$4+ for just a cheap flimsy case is ridiculous and excessive</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice and handy but I couldn&#x27;t quite fit my sulcabrush in without taking one of the heads off first.</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use to daily!  Sometimes twice a day.  If can be used instead of a regular toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Cheap GARBAGE, flimsy plastic, could not stay closed, not wort the return postage.</li>
    <li> I find this carry case just what I was looking for. It keeps the Sulcabrush in perfect condition for traveling.</li>
    <li> I order 2 and one never closed properly and therfore is not usable.  It&#x27;s not worth to send back, (the hassle) but I will not order from them again.  They clearly didn&#x27;t look at their product before they shipped it out.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed for traveling !! Its is sturdy, keeps brush clean.. Every one should have one it you have implants</li>
    <li> I purchased two travel pouches.  One closed properly the other one did not stay closed.  I have to use a rubber band to keep it closed.  Quality control should test these pouches to assure they close properly.  The one that is defective is not worth returning.</li>
    <li> This is such a good idea but not very well constructed😑</li>
    <li> The Sulcabrush itself is excellent.  his is a travel container for it.  The seller was contacted because I could not close it.  S response, but no helpful feedback, was received.  The plastic case is a clamshell that refused to stay shut.  Destination:  waste can.</li>
    <li> I was surprised to see the other reviews that say the pouch does not close. Mines closes alright, it&#x27;s just hard to open and I find myself struggling to open it every time. Overall it does the job and I like that it has little holes to let some ventilation get in and allow it to dry.</li>
    <li> Brush keeps hygienically clean in this case.  Better than trying to wrap it in something else since it is a custom fit.</li>
    <li> The pouch does not stay closed--I have to wrap a rubber band around it.  Other than that it&#x27;s fine--does what it is supposed to do--store the Sulcabrush.</li>
    <li> Used the product for years and this is so handy.</li>
    <li> If you want to keep your gums and teeth healthy you must have a sulcabrush.  It is nice to have the travel pouch too.  I found the travel pouch hard to open the first time but other than that it is a good accessory to have.</li>
    <li> I thought this came with the brush shown in the picture, but I am happy with it anyway.  Very useful for traveling.</li>
    <li> Great container for travel and for cleanliness. The vent holes allow for drying. Plus there is enough space to store extra tips and other oral hygiene equipment.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t work properly from the start. Though a relatively inexpensive item, it&#x27;s still disappointing. The plastic clasps simply don&#x27;t hold the case together.</li>
    <li> While shipping was more than the holder itself, even my dentist who gave me the brush had never seen the holder. I take it in my purse whenever I am going to eat out. The end result: well worth the price!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay closed. It just keeps popping open. Need a rubber band to keep it closed. Love the sulcabrush though.</li>
    <li> --This ad is deceptive -appears to be selling the travel pouch PLUS the brush and two tips.&lt;br /&gt;--The PRICE certainly reflects the combination as well.&lt;br /&gt;--$4+ for just a cheap flimsy case is ridiculous and excessive&lt;br /&gt;--Alternative ways to transport: regular toothbrush case from $1 store&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--NOTE: SULCA brush itself - a great, great invention that saves teeth and gums.</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;r care for orange - looks like it was left over from halloween! why is blue shown in the picture?</li>
    <li> Been using the sulca brush for years due to my dental work.  This will keep it clean in the suitcase.</li>
    <li> I received the case which was difficult to open.  They need better quality control on this item.  Figure out a better way to open it and secure it as well.</li>
    <li> Sulca brushes are great for people with gum disease. Recommended by laser gum surgeon. The results in this brush instead of floss has been great.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand what the problem was for some of the other reviewers. This case is great and serves the purpose. I&#x27;ve used the sulcabrush for years and always wished there was a better way to store it...and low and behold someone is a genius and came up with this simple idea to protect both ends of the brush.</li>
    <li> The case is great protection for the sulcabrush. keeps it tucked away and clean. great protection</li>
    <li> just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Awesome - Love this tool.  Will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good concept, but it was harder than heck to get it open initially, and now it won&#x27;t stay shut...</li>
    <li> This was suggested by my Dental Hygienist i had never heard of this. She said they aren&#x27;t advertised. But I love it. And the case is great!!.</li>
