<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Like this item this is my second one</li>
    <li> It looks cordless from the pics. I wish it was cordless, still a great pair of clippers, though.</li>
    <li> best clippers... conair is the best</li>
    <li> This trimmer is my favorite.  This is my 3rd one I&#x27;ve had over the last 6 years. I&#x27;ve tried other trimmers but nothing compares to this conair. As long as this one is made,  I&#x27;ll buy it</li>
    <li> it was my first time using a product like this at home and it is very easy to use, now I am my husband personal barber!</li>
    <li> I just finished using this clipper for a perfect 1/4 inch haircut. Wow I am impressed. Prior to buying this I had another pair of Conair clippers (Conair 19-pc. Pro Haircut Kit) with that cheap plastic lever to adjust the blade. The lever broke so believe me I was very skeptical on buying Conair clippers again especially any clippers that used the side lever to adjust how far back or forward the clipper part goes. I chose this set because they use a slide button instead which is in my opinion so much better and practical. The various comb attachments actually snap on instead of the slide on type which always stretch or one end snaps apart resulting in the attachment falling off and then you end up zipping yourself a chunk of hair out (yep didn&#x27;t realize I lost the attachment until it was too late). Thank God somebody at Conair did some research finally. I give the Chopper 2in1 clippers a perfect score for now. We&#x27;ll see how they hold up as they age. If you are like me looking for a set of clippers that are far above and beyond for product design then these are for you. I plan on leaving the 1/4 inch attachment on knowing that with any plastic parts the more you keep popping it on and off the more likeky you are to warp or break the attachment. I never write any reviews unless I am either very pleased with a product or very upset with the product. The Chopper clippers are by far the best made clippers I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
    <li> I have had this for about a year. It has several pieces that can clip over the blades to adjust the length of hair cut. It works as expected. No problems or disappointments. Cuts well.</li>
    <li> COMPLETELY PERFECT...Bst one online. I&#x27;d buy AGAIN, For SURE :-)</li>
    <li> I really love these clippers, it&#x27;s multi functionality was great.  Though I guess build quality might be a little shabby.  On a move the main clippers got smashed somehow, it was in the middle of my suitcase, and the attachment clips broke, so I am left only with the smaller trimmer attachment, which I use all the time with no complaints.</li>
    <li> I have owned this clipper for a couple of years. I use it primarily to keep my beard trimmed up. Because I don&#x27;t use it every day, I appreciate being able to put it away without worrying about a battery running low. My old one was forever going dead on me just when I needed it. THe biggest downside is changing between a beard trimmer and a hair trimmer. FOr me, changing the blade is a real pain. I find it very hard to detach the head. Otherwise, a great product.</li>
    <li> Good product well built, only negative is the poor attachment of the lifting combs to the groomer. Poor design not providing sufficient holding power. A metal clip should have been molded in the combs.    Otherwise the groomer performs well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought 4 or 5 sets of clippers over my years of home haircuts.  I am quite happy with the performance of this brand and would buy them again.  They are comfortable to hold, have lots of different sizes of blade guards and plently of motor power.  I recommend them.</li>
    <li> Not Great, Not Amazing, but Simply Convienent. And to me for the price &amp; for the equipment it was well worth it. This is for someone that wants to do it all themselves, but if you&#x27;re a professional or want professional clippers, look elsewhere. This simply just gets the job done and well.</li>
    <li> Hello! I totally surprised because i didn&#x27;t expected it was so good.&lt;br /&gt;I recomended. and I think its a great price - Value-&lt;br /&gt;and actually you save a lot of money in barber store.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with the machine.&lt;br /&gt;and the shipping was perfect,arrived the correct day</li>
    <li> This is a cool piece of equipment, but it&#x27;s low price is not an accident.  There&#x27;s really only one problem with this device.  The plastic parts to attach to the clippers to determine the length of hair you want at too small and don&#x27;t sit on the clippers properly.  This seems like a minor issue, but it did slightly hurt the usability of the product.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful. I bought this one as a gift. I had originally bought mine in a store but my father borrowed it and fell in love. This is the only set of clippers that has held up for me and the price cant be beat.</li>
    <li> I bought these clippers to shave my head.  I figured they would be perfect since the package indicated that these were perfect for shaving heads, even going so far as to show a cleanly shaved bald guy on the front.  But these clippers leave long stubble, and the instructions actually tell you to follow up with a traditional razor to get a closer shave.  Ridiculous, because if you use a razor to get a close shave on a regular basis, then you don&#x27;t need to bother with clippers.</li>
    <li> I used to have a Conair cordless beard trimmer I bought at a drugstore. It was OK, cheaply made but passable performance, but I hated the recharging. I live in NYC and don&#x27;t have room for things to be set out and charging all the time, so I&#x27;d have to plan my beard trimming a day ahead of time, to get the thing out and charging. So, when it finally fell apart (literally) I went back to the drugstore and picked up the Chopper.    Problem A: It&#x27;s meant to also cut hair, which I don&#x27;t want or need, but because it plugs into an outlet, I bought it thinking it was easy to switch it to a beard trimmer. So, I only need to switch the hair-trimming head with the beard-trimming head. You&#x27;d think this would be less of a task than it turned out to be, but it is the reason why I feel compelled to write this review.    Problem B: The instructions are terrible and written by an automatic Chinese translation machine. There are no diagrams or guides as to how to switch the heads. It says \\&quot;just push the blade with your thumb and forefingers\\&quot;. WHAT!? IT&#x27;S SCREWED ON THERE. HOW THE HECK IS THAT SUPPOSED TO WORK!? There is NOTHING in the manual about needing a Phillips-head screwdriver or having to expose the insides of this thing.    So, to switch the heads, you need a Philips head screwdriver. You have to remove the existing blade, the inner blade and the black plastic wire-thing that holds the inner blade inside. You will probably think you destroyed this product when little parts go flying everywhere. This is not intuitive or user-friendly at all. You should have five (5) parts in your hand after you disassemble your Chopper: two Phillips-head screws, the large outer-blade, the smaller inner blade, and the black plastic piece. Also, you will have some kind of oil/grease on your fingers. I didn&#x27;t realize I needed to be in mechanic garb when using a beard trimmer.    Then you have get the beard-trimmer head into the same gaping electronics-exposing hole in your Chopper. I can only say,be gentle and put the two black plastic tips that stick out from the sides, into the \\&quot;base\\&quot; of the hole. If you hold the trimmer with the hole pointed towards the ceiling and the cord towards the floor, the part of the hole closest to the cord is where you place the black plastic tips end of the head. Then push the head forward and gently, GENTLY push the head into place until it fits properly. This took a good five minutes for me to finally get it to pop in the right way. I threw away all the hair-trimming plastic junk that came with the Chopper, and swore never to buy another Conair product ever again.    Why should it take 30-45 minutes to figure out how to switch the heads? It&#x27;s not even that I fault them for making the product that way. I fault them for NOT EVEN MENTIONING IT IN THE MANUAL!!!! It&#x27;s laziness on the part of the technical writers and the executives at Conair.     Once I got the damn thing put back together, I turned it on and it worked! Much better than that cordless, rechargeable junk, the Chopper made quick work of the scrags on my face. In fact, it took about 1-2 minutes to trim the beard, as opposed to the near hour it took me to figure out how I was supposed to swap heads on this thing without breaking it. I&#x27;m good at breaking things when I touch them ... I&#x27;ve broken off several keys in locks, pull door knobs off, accidentally taken doors off hinges, so I tend to be skittish about taking things apart, right after I paid for them.    So, two stars, because my beard did get trimmed. The manual and the Conair organization in general, NO STARS for you lazy bums.</li>
    <li> Best chopper I&#x27;ve used for manscrapping. It really works!</li>
    <li> Perfect for my purposes.</li>
    <li> These are pure garbage. Stay away! Do yourself a favor and go to the next product. I&#x27;m confused how anyone could rate this item with more than 2 stars. You have to hold down  button to get the blades to move fast enough.</li>
    <li> I purchased this  a couple of months ago for my 17 year old son, who has been using my Remington MB-200 to trim his hair. I didn&#x27;t really care for sharing like this so I thought I&#x27;d buy him his own trimmer. He was delighted at first, but now he refuses to use it, claiming that it pulls the hairs and is painful to use. Since he&#x27;s been sneaking my Remington again, I broke down and bought him his own Remington. Not sure what to do with the Conair.   Anybody want to buy it? lol</li>
    <li> REALLY quiet motor on this thing....my husband was trimming his beard and I didn&#x27;t even know it until he was finished! He loves it. He also uses it to shave his head.</li>
    <li> This hair clipper comes with all the attachments for hair and beard trimming and works great!</li>
    <li> I really love these clippers. It does not take me nearly as long to cut my hair. I like the turbo boost button as well. It really gets the job done. I shave my head twice a week &amp; look forward to it. I had wahl clippers in the past &amp; they nick my scalp. These don&#x27;t. As a matter of fact before I bought these I bought some wahl chrome pro clippers &amp; they chewed my scalp up. It left blood all over my scalp. I also bought the wahl balder &amp; it snagged &amp; pulled the back of my scalp. I finally went back to the conair chopper clippers. They glide on my scalp like butter. Really nice grip as well. You have to try these clippers you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this trimmer back in October of 2009, when it was selling as $30.  I bought it because my partner was spending $10/per haircut at a military barber, just for a simple buzzcut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lasted us until 2013, when, from storing the clipper with the wire wrapped around it too tightly, we noticed that it wasn&#x27;t working properly.  Now when it&#x27;s on, it only actually turns on and functions/clips when you hold the wire closer to the base.  Obviously the wire got dislodged by his poor wire-wrapping technique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all, this was a great pair of introduction clippers.  We saved hundreds of dollars by investing in this item.  Though, I believe that we&#x27;re going to upgrade to something finer now that we know how often we use this thing.</li>
    <li> I have bought three of these razors and I am buying 2 more right now. NO...I do not run a barbershop! Actually, I cut my hair every week to bring my head &amp;#34;close to&amp;#34; bald. I have to replace the this razor every three months. Now I know you are saying &amp;#34;You are wasting money buying a new razor every three month.&amp;#34; Actually, I use to spend $20 every two weeks to have my haircut and about an hour each time to wait for someone to cut my hair. So I wasted 6 hours and $120 of my time and money. Now I buy this razor every three months and it cost me $19.00 and I can cut my hair anytime I want to. After three months, the retiring haircut razor becomes my beard razor. So I get a full six months out of this razor. Then it is retired to my traveling kit. So I get almost a full year out of this razor in various ways. I love this razor and I hope that they do not retire it.</li>
    <li> Very cheaply built. The shaver head falls off and is hard to clean.  I&#x27;ve had a beard for over 20years and I have owned a few shavers and this one is not so great.  I&#x27;ve had it for a few months and it&#x27;s time for a better one.</li>
    <li> This is the third hair trimmer I&#x27;ve owned. Prior to purchasing this one I owned a Wahl and before that a Remington. The Remington I liked best, the Wahl was good. This one by Conair is a blatant rip-off.    This Conair thing feels like a kids&#x27; toy. Hollow cheap plastic with a weak little motor inside. It takes much longer to cut my hair because I have to keep going over the same parts over and over again. My old Wahl felt heavy, solid, and substantial. When the Wahl cut thru my hair the hair fell down in clumps and one swipe was all it took.    Just to further make the point, on the Conair trimmer there is a \\&quot;Made in China\\&quot; logo stamped on everything that comes out of the box. Wahl still makes trimmers here in America and they are about the same price. Just much higher quality...    The only reason I bought this Conair thing was because I dropped the Wahl on the floor a couple times which broke off small parts of the blade, and lost a couple of the attachments to it. I&#x27;m going to go dig it out of the trash, buy replacement blades and attachments for it, and throw this Conair in the trash.    Shame on Conair for selling a piece of junk like this in the first place!    Also many of the Amazon reviews of this product seem mention it being cordless/having a battery. That is nonsense; this product does NOT have a battery and will NOT work unless it is plugged into an electrical outlet. I don&#x27;t know what product those reviews refer to but it is definitely NOT this one!</li>
    <li> Good product, I recommend it .</li>
    <li> My son use it more then I if a 19 old said it work good .that mean great of adult.</li>
    <li> THESE ARE SOME OF THE BEST CLIPPERS THAT I HAVE BOUGHT AND USED ON MY BOYFRIENDS HAIR. MAKES ME GLAD TO KNOW THAT I DONT HAVE TO BUY THE HIGH PRICED ONES.</li>
    <li> 5minutes after I pulled it out of the package....it broke....and I couldn&#x27;t fix it so I had to go back to my old one. I would reccommend getting the 7 dollar set of clippers at walmart!</li>
    <li> I have very short hair that is normally cut with the lowest guard.  I have always used cheap $10 clippers that they sell at the grocery store but decided to upgrade to something a bit nicer.  With the new clippers it takes 3 times as long to cut my hair and leaves lots of uncut patches that I need to go over many times.  I only used these a couple times before going back to the cheap kind.  I do not recommend these to anyone with short hair.  Perhaps they do better with longer hair.  On a good note they are fairly quiet.</li>
    <li> Love this machine... i&#x27;ve bought it over and over again... love the fact that it has two machines in one.</li>
    <li> I oil this once a year and it&#x27;s been working great since 2008! Can&#x27;t complain. I only use it to trim my facial hair; haven&#x27;t dealt with shaving cream or cuts or blades in years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Still using and works great in 2017...</li>
    <li> I usually never bother to write reviews, but this product angers me so much I feel I must.  This is not only the worst beard trimmer I have ever had, it is the worst purchasable item I have ever been in the proximity of.  First of all, at normal power it rips my beard hair out and barely cuts it, on \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; it is slightly better.  If it can be more powerful, why not just make it that powerful when you turn it on?  No, instead they make you hold down a button the whole time, ridiculous.  Also, the blade heats up so much it feels like the thing is short-circuiting the whole time.  This piece of crap is not worthy of touching my beard or anyone else&#x27;s.  DO NOT BUY THIS UNLESS YOU HATE YOURSELF.</li>
    <li> Just received the clippers. Not happy the package it came in was duct taped together. The clippers and guards have dandruff on them and the clippers don&#x27;t work</li>
    <li> I am back on here ordering a new one. it does plug in which i prefer instead f having to replace batteries or find your charger. I shave my head 1-2 times a week nd this gets very close its easy to maintain and dont need to apply oil. its great and for $19 its cheaper than going to a barber. i use it to shave my heard and sometimes trim my facial hair when i am to lazy to actually shave. thats what i use it for and would recommend it o anyone. ordering me a new one today.</li>
    <li> i just owned mine but before i purchased this clippers,i had used them a couple of times before and the outcome impressed me so much that i decided to own a unit.if u like to be good looking and want something to do the job for you,i will recommend you get one for yourself.for the price its more than killing.</li>
    <li> Conair should be ashamed of themselves for putting this product on the market. I received this product this afternoon around 5pm and it was broken as of 8pm. It cut pretty decent at first, I was impressed and figured the bad experiences and ratings I read on here regarding this product were isolated incidents. I was sadly mistaken. After running the machine for 15 minutes, I was cut when one the inner blade shot out at me while the machine was running because a high pressured spring within the machine broke which made the sharp inner blade lunge forward and make a nice deep cut in my forehead (so much for a bargain.) Conair should have recalled this product day 1 off the factory line, I am so disappointed I can&#x27;t even begin to express my disdain for this company. The bigwigs are just as much responsible at conair as the below par engineers they have developing this junk. You can&#x27;t expect too much for $20 but for $10 I could have gotten a \\&quot;full\\&quot; haircut and still had my forehead in tact. A product that didn&#x27;t last for 3 hours, only one of which was it ever out of the packaging! I hope this company goes bankrupt, there is no way they didn&#x27;t know this was trash.</li>
    <li> Very well-made clippers.  The handle is very easy to hold in both size and texture.  The rubberized grip keeps it from slipping even when wet in a steamy bathroom. It does not vibrate much at all and that is a big plus compared to other clippers I&#x27;ve had that make my hands go numb! The attachment combs clip on very easily and securely...with other clippers we have had to struggle to get these on and have had them fall off during use, not so with these.  There is an assortment of sizes that fit every need in our household and all work very well.  We have used these on thin, fine, straight hair and thick, course, curly hair - on the top of the head and neck trimming/shaving as-well-as facial/beard shaving and have had no problems with hair pulling or razor rash from having to go over an area excessively.  The included cape is okay for its intended purpose,  but I don&#x27;t expect it to last very long as it is very thin/flimsy. Not why I bought it anyway so however long it lasts is okay with me.  The case to store the items in is a bit on the small side and you really have to carefully arrange the items inside to get it zipped closed but it can be done.  The scissors are sharp enough and operate smoothly but are not the best hair-cutting scissors I have ever owned - I would advise buying a pair separately for actual hair-cutting as these are really only good for beard trimming prior to use of the clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would purchase these again.  The price is very reasonable even if it were for just the clippers and attachment combs,  and I consider the other items bonus throw-ins that make this all the more a value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:  Easy to hold,  cuts very precisely,  large assortment of attachment comb sizes, works on a variety of hair types and textures, good for hair and  beard trimming and back of neck shaving&lt;br /&gt;CONS:  None</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a great shaver and read the reviews on the chopper and decided to try it out and it is really a great product. I don&#x27;t like clean shaving my head and this product gets my hair down to almost a clean shave. I ahve had no knicks or scrapes from it or any pulling and works great in the beard area also.</li>
    <li> I had a Conair HCT475 for years and I loved it.  Lately the blades had become too dull, so I decided to replace it with another Conair product.  The store only had the HCT423 so I bought it.  What a mistake!  The blades are very dull, it clogs way too easily, requires disassembly to clean, and the wider head makes it harder to get an even buzz cut.  I used it a few times but it takes much longer to cut my hair since I have to make so many passes over each section, and even then it doesn&#x27;t really look even.  I&#x27;m throwing it away and buying another HCT475.  [Update: the 475 is even better than I remember.  Buy that instead!]</li>
    <li> I have these clippers.  They chewed 3&#x27;&#x27;  off of my beard without a problem.  They did not lose power like my old rechargable clippers.  I plan to start cutting my own hair now.  It has a number of guides for both cutting beards and hair.  Well worth the $20.  It also made work happy for me to look more professional.</li>
    <li> We would like to return this but did not realize we only had 30 days to do so. Our mistake. My husband has used this type of trimmer for a &amp;#34;buzz&amp;#34;/short cut for years - but this one could not handle hair less than 1/2 inch long, and made his hair look like a huge moth had eaten clumps of it here and there. The clipper did not sound like it had enough power maybe? Anyway, we won&#x27;t be purchasing any CONAIR products. This product looks sharp, and comes in a nice case with accessories, but does not work. We&#x27;ve used REMINGTON successfully and now have a WAHL which is great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d really stay away from this. The clippers hardly work, are poorly packaged, and nothing seems to fit well. I sent them back pronto.</li>
    <li> WOW, I have owned my share of these Clippers and I can say this one by far is the very best so far. I havn&#x27;t owned it long but I can tell you straight off the back it&#x27;s really close to the skin not like a Razor but close enough without the razor bumps. lol Any How, What I love about these Clippers is that they are Very Light Weight so my arm don&#x27;t get tired while I shaping up my head. I can even do designs and so much more because they are not heavy and it adjust to about 2-3 different levels with out attachments, thats what I really like about this machine aswell. Any way Don&#x27;t take it from me, get one and if it don&#x27;t impress you return it. What you got to lose?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charlie</li>
    <li> I bought these with high hopes. My last pair of clippers were conair and lasted quite a few years. The first thing I noticed is that they felt cheap. When I bought it I didn&#x27;t know it had two interchangable heads. So I thought I would try to change them out. After trying for a few minutes I managed to get the head changed out. When I went to change them back I could not get the original head back in. I tried every which way I could think of to get the head back in and could not get it. So I returned them. I ordered a Wahl trimmer, I heard they are very good. They have to be better than this set.</li>
    <li> This trimmer seemed to work fine for giving yourself a buzzcut however was horrible when used on face. The trimmer seemed to pull facial hair as much as it actually trimmed it.&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy this if you are looking form something to use on your face as well as your head.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a conair rechargable clipper before and I was very happy.  I broke it by dropping it and decided to try this one due to the reviews I read here.  Its a very clean, powerful cut.  the shape and weight of it are a good combo.  It feels much more durable than the previous one I had and I doubt that this will break if I drop it.      Loudness is not a factor for me, but it was not loud.</li>
    <li> What an amazing trimmer kit. I had gotten a more expensive one for my husband two years ago for Christmas and a few months ago it started ging out. You could tell by the sound that it was just losing power. So I bought this because I love the brand and they always have good products. It works wonderfully. Much better than any other set I&#x27;ve purchased. Goes straight through his thick hair without pulling or snagging.</li>
    <li> Bought these hair clipper because i had some just like this that i had pickup from Walmart used them for one night and then they started skipping like it had a short in it. But i came to Amazon and found these they work grate no skips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 4/21/2013:&lt;br /&gt;They started doing the same thing my old ones were doing after a wile of using them.</li>
    <li> Great hair clippers we use them all the time they don&#x27;t get hot or break.</li>
    <li> At the same time I bought this clipper, I bought an Andis MC-2 clipper. Initially, I liked the Andis better because it had a Number 1 clipper comb. After about three months, I started having trouble with the Andis, it keeps turning off and the clipper combs won&#x27;t stay attached. The Conair is MUCH BETTER. The Conair is light, easy to use, it does not have a really short attachment but you don&#x27;t need it I found. If you adjust the blade with the lever, you can get just as close a buzz cut. The Conair DOES have a cord, don&#x27;t let the photos fool you. It is not battery operated.</li>
    <li> Like many others who purchased these here, i too was fooled into thinking these were cordless. The add shows a cordless trimmer and says nothing about it having a cord..This is very misleading and for some a disappointment..I have no use for corded trimmers, these were nothing but a waste of money for me!!!!</li>
    <li> Great features and accessories for this trimmer, and it works well until the battery reaches the end of its (very short) life. Would be better if the battery could be replaced.</li>
    <li> Very nice and light weight.  It cuts the hair with out pulling and has many attachments.  I would use a larger setting and work down if I were you.  It cuts so clean that short hair is short hair.</li>
    <li> When I removed  the large blade to fit the smaller ones my hands got smothered by a white paste. I noticed that the paste came from the inside of the machine exactly from the cylinder that make the blades move. Contacted Conair to find if this paste toxic or safe to handle with bare hands but only got a response telling me it was a motor lubricant, but they didn&#x27;t know if it was toxic.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, is very lightweight, have a great hold, easy to clean and maintain, and of course works perfectly!</li>
    <li> My whiskers are not dissimilar from barbed wire. I have used other trimmers with mixed success. This Conair cut through my beard like a hot knife through butter. It was much more effective than I could have imagined. The large number of combs offer many length options. There are a thoughtful array of tools offered as well as a handy storage bag.The device feels very solid and well built.&lt;br /&gt;Update: Nearly four years of use and not a hiccup. This product has truly exceeded my expectations.</li>
    <li> Good product as shown in the page for a very good price !! I recommend, and hope you enjoy like me !</li>
    <li> As a hairstylist, it&#x27;s hard to find clippers and trimmer that aren&#x27;t a lot of money but also work great. A stylist I work with got these at Ross for this price. On the conair website they are 45$. I tried them out on a few haircuts today and I loved them. They are light weight. Easy to use. Easy to clean. I love that you can just pop the blades off. And the two speeds really help when going over thick hair. I thought the cut was a very clean cut. I will be buying these clippers too use behind the chair.</li>
    <li> These were total garbage,  I tried cutting my sons hair and also one of his friends the blades were so dull it pulled their hair instead. Could not find any information regarding returning so I threw them in the garbage.  Would not recommend to anyone</li>
    <li> This electric razor was good at first when using it. It was excellent for military hair cuts ... until the motor burned out after 3 months of owning it.</li>
    <li> yes and very fast delivery</li>
    <li> great product fast shipping. i have had these clippers for about 3 years now. No issues as of yet!</li>
    <li> Works well.  Comes with lots of extras.  Not loud.  Hopefully it lasts a few years at least.        ***Update 2010***  Reducing the rating because the attachments don&#x27;t snap in tight enough and if you&#x27;re a do-it-yourselfer, you&#x27;ll find the attachment popping off when you&#x27;re trying to get the backside done which is quite a PITA.  The little tab on the attachment just isn&#x27;t big enough and its ability to snap in will worsen over time due to just a tiny bit of wear. The tines on the attachments are also a bit too flimsy and don&#x27;t keep straight.</li>
    <li> Excellent settings and great attachments catering to ease of handling and precision in cutting. Very durable and the button for an extra boost make this my favorite hair cutting tool.</li>
    <li> Best ever gotten for the hubby. Came in quick and great packaging. Great gift</li>
    <li> It works okay,but my hubby has only had it for a few months and I tried using it and it pulled on my hair.</li>
    <li> Feels like I&#x27;m getting my hair cut by duct tape because it pulls so many. Who would want this? Seriously, keep looking.</li>
    <li> I had an earlier model of this trimmer which worked reliably for years until a few weeks ago when, traveling abroad, I stuck the plug in a 250v socket only to hear its death cry. My fault for sure. I liked them so much I immediately reordered without thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design has changed very little. The buttons are a slight bit different... a screwhole on the back that wasn&#x27;t there before... unless you look closely they&#x27;re fairly identical. The one big difference is the color. Whereas the old pair were a deep, somewhat dark orange, the new one is more of a lighter metallic orange. One other thing is that the underside of the two heads changed in design, so my old ones won&#x27;t work with the new one. Note that the one difficulty in using this is that while it&#x27;s easy to pull the heads off, it&#x27;s fairly difficult to put them on. You&#x27;ll be struggling with it a bit each time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first use proved that it worked the same as the old one. They trim well and I like the ability to switch between clipper and trimmer heads. They do get a bit warm if you use them for too long, but it&#x27;s never caused any issues. The turbo buttons seems to work the same but, to tell the truth, I&#x27;ve never used it. What exactly am I &amp;#34;turboing&amp;#34;? While the head does move faster, I cannot imagine that anything short of a buffalo actually needs this button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest change is the accessories. The original only came with 3 cover pieces for the trimmers (low, medium, high). The new one comes with 9, which gives you much more versatility. The trimmer comes with one adjustable and three fixed covers which work well. The new one comes with some combs and scissors which the older model didn&#x27;t, and some oil. The old trimmer came with a third head for nose/ears... but I never thought it worked that well and thus never used it, so it wasn&#x27;t missed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest change is the storage bag. My old version came with what I thought was a cheap vinyl zippered bag. That cheap vinyl bag seems amazing nowcompared to the new drawstring cheesecloth sack they sent along. It&#x27;s almost comical that this is the storage bag they included with this nice metallic trimmer. The trimmer doesn&#x27;t fit into the bag directly horizontal or vertical, so you have to put it in at an angle and dump everything else around it. The bag isn&#x27;t really big enough to fit all the accessories in without considerable arrangement. Luckily I have the old bag to use, but you&#x27;ll likely need something else to store this in because that thing won&#x27;t cut it for long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is a solid and reliable clipper/trimmer set that I do recommend. They are easy to hold and work well. Find a new bag and these things are golden.vinyl bag seems amazing nowcompared to the new drawstring cheesecloth sack they sent along.

    <li> I am an African-American woman with a short cut, very close cut in the back and on the sides, and I&#x27;ve used this several times with great results! The result is very professional looking! I&#x27;ve gotten several compliments. And it is super easy! As long as you pick the right size comb attachmentand remember to put it on, you can&#x27;t mess up! I love it! Glad I went with Conair! Now I will admit, I haven&#x27;t used the actual trimmer part of this, just the clipper, but I am more than satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> We purchased this as we have another conair clipper that looks exactly like this one. We had lost some of the trimmer pieces and hoped they would be interchangable between the two clippers. They are not. My husbands reports this  clipper pulls at his beard more.</li>
    <li> I got this because it said pet clipper &amp; I thought it had lots OF COMBS  for lots of uses but it is NOT FOR PETS RETURNED</li>
    <li> Works great.  Love not having to pay for simple haircuts anymore!</li>
    <li> this was a x-mas gift for my son and he loved them and was happy they have everything in one</li>
    <li> This clipper is not quite what I&#x27;d hoped for.  It has way too many attachments that seem to be designed for quantity and not quality.  Many don&#x27;t seem to do anything at all.  It&#x27;s not bad, but I would not purchase it again.  I find it&#x27;s not much better than the clipper it was supposed to replace (which I kept and still use).  If they got rid of about 18 of the 24 pieces and improved the quality a bit, they&#x27;d be way ahead.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for these clippers:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* A sleek design&lt;br /&gt;* Cool color&lt;br /&gt;* Easy grip&lt;br /&gt;* Plenty of attachments&lt;br /&gt;* Good reviews&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, there is one major flaw.  The clipper provides no cover towards the front, causing hear to get caught up in the gears and innards of the device.  Furthermore, there&#x27;s no good way of cleaning it, so the clippers are always full of dirty decaying hair.  A simple plastic guard would have gone a long way to make this a much better product.</li>
    <li> Does just what I wanted it to! If you got hair, it will cut it and it doesn&#x27;t pull like some I&#x27;ve had.</li>
    <li> Works great for beard and hair trimming.</li>
    <li> I give this a three because I had originally had the yellow version of this one. The orange pair just didn&#x27;t seem to function as well or be as sharp. Don&#x27;t know if they skimped when they change to orange or I just got a bad luck pair. Luckily they were stolen from me and I went back to my yellow one that lasted 3 more years (6.5 total.) Just bought a brand new pair of the yellow ones and works great. As I see of right now, on amazon the old yellow version is more expensive than the new orange version.......... Hmm?????? Plus the yellow comes with and actual bag with a zipper. See my full 5 star review of the yellow version.</li>
    <li> East to use, and I like a plug in, not a battery trimmer. I&#x27;m very satisfied with it and the price is right.</li>
    <li> Use this all the time, haven&#x27;t been to a barber in a while.  Trims my beard, mustache and hair.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have much to say. I purchased the product. I opened it and attempted to use it and it didn&#x27;t cut my beard so I returned it. Instead I purchased this: [[ASIN:B002C741MM Philips Norelco QT4021 Stubble Trimmer]]   It works great.</li>
    <li> Great clipper. My husband got it as a gift from his sister. Now we use it both for the husband and our dog. Works great on both. Our dog has hair, not fur, as it is a yorkshire terrier. I bet it wouldn&#x27;t work on double-coated dogs.  And it&#x27;s been over a year now and it is still very sharp. Great buy!</li>
    <li> It worked great for the first few sessions.  Now I have to use the turbo button. During normal speed, it barely runs...sigh   I&#x27;ve had it with cheap electronic products.  I will begin paying top dollar and mailing the warranty in.</li>
    <li> awesome clippers. very satisfied</li>
    <li> had it for a while...works great</li>
    <li> The bread trimmer head doesn&#x27;t get as close as my old Wahls did, otherwise it would be a 4 star rating.</li>
    <li> is good for shaving down head for sleekheads, also is gentle enough to cut a child head, also good for gruff facial hair</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work right out of the box!</li>
    <li> Good brand at a reasonable price. I&#x27;ve been using Conair for 17 years and have no intention of switching.  I can&#x27;t think of anything wrong with this item.</li>
    <li> and that is simply because while it does a very good job, changing between heads is a major struggle. I am seriously thinking of chucking it and buying something else.</li>
    <li> Bought these as a gift and they work great! The attachments all fit perfect and it isn&#x27;t hard to change like on some other brands.</li>
    <li> Amazing for that price !!!! :) super happy thanks!!</li>
    <li> My dad has the same kit he bought at Kmart for $45 and was surprised to see them here for half the price! I love this buzzer, it cuts quickly and accurately without even needing the turbo on. Def worth it. Came in retail packaging which is a huge plus.</li>
    <li> This was a replacement purchase. Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Great for keeping my hair and beard well groomed</li>
    <li> this is my second clipper and i see how much of an upgrade it was from my old pair. its not noisy, doesnt pull your hair, and the turbo feature is handy for thick hair. its easy to switch between the hair clipper and beard trimmer another handy feature. its two in one, comm&#x27;on what a deal. i love it</li>
    <li> This should cost $60 or more easy.  It works alot better than I was expecting.  Comes with a trimmer acccessory that I find unneccessary, but it looks quality. Super light weight, easy to use, attractive carrying case and multitude of grooming attachments.  I use it to trim my beard and (other body hair) to a nice short length to keep it neat.  I honestly bought this one to try a cheap one and plan on throwing it away after I hated it, to justify buying a new $100 clipper...  Thank God, I found this one.  I use it every other day and it does everything I need, and it saved me from spending much more cash than I needed to.</li>
    <li> If you trim and cut mustache, scalp. Than this Tool is for you. I replaced my older Conair beard trimmer that I was also using for my hair and really liked it, worked well and for 4 years.  This is a Great Replacement at a VALUE PRICE. And I did compare heavily with the competitors before choosing for and ALL in ONE as Conair calls it The CHOPPER. It does the job well !!!</li>
    <li> This is for a grandson and looks like it will do the job.  He will be getting it for christmas and we will write a review at a later time.</li>
    <li> I bought these to replace some Conair clippers that lasted for about 8 years and worked great. Granted, my old set were a professional model and cost about $60, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting the same level of quality but my god these sucked. You have to go over the same area OVER AND OVER again, to the point where your scalp starts to hurt. The \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; button is a joke, and only slightly helps. What normally took about 5-10 minutes took at least a half hour to complete. Don&#x27;t buy these.</li>
    <li> I have had this for 2 years now and it still works like new, I use this for facial hair as well as do my own haircuts. It doesn&#x27;t replace a true close shave on your face but it can be used to trim and shape perfectly, the turbo button is nice but even with thick hair honestly i have not needed it, this thing is sharp enough and powerful enough to do 4-5 haircuts and countless face trimming in a year, great product!</li>
    <li> Its functional. I would have given it 4 stars, but I think the pictures are misleading because they make it look cordless when it isn&#x27;t!!!</li>
    <li> Could not use no outlet for power cord..</li>
    <li> This item has an adjustable blade which is great. The issue is, with this item, the blade sometimes will not stay locked into position. It will unexpectedly pop back to the #1 position. Doesn&#x27;t happen all of the time but it is frustrating. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this item to anyone.</li>
    <li> I like this chopper.. It suits me.. I recommend it to my friends..</li>
    <li> Not like the original. This thing cuts hair but doesn&#x27;t run or cut like the one I got three years ago.. Oh well!</li>
    <li> Perfect for buzzing my own head, works great and blades are sharp. Always cuts and doest rip out my hair. Never really used the turbo button works fine when using on normal. Great for the price.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I bought this.  I have 2 sons and this is everything I need.  It came very fast and it is a very great product!</li>
    <li> I am pretty wild with my hair...I let it grow out to long whether if its on top of my head or on my face...this product definitely does the job if I want to be clean cut for special occasions..a must buy!!</li>
    <li> The clippers are great! nice grip and very smooth action. guards for everything you will want to do and then some!</li>
    <li> Awesome clippers! I&#x27;ve been looking all over for theses clippers and found them on Amazon. I had the first versions of these that lasted a long time, until, they had to be replaced with these. Great close cutting and has a removable blade. It comes with different plastic cutting guides accessories.</li>
    <li> Litterally the worst piece of crap we have ever spent money on. The clippers are dull and cut chunks out of my husbands hair. It took several times through the same spot to get it even. Even on the &amp;#34;turbo&amp;#34; feature it wouldn&#x27;t work. I used this to cut my husbands hair and it is so terrible I will have to go buy new clippers tomorrow to cut his hair again. The scissors that come with it are about as dull as the scissors a child would use. If the clippers and the scissors weren&#x27;t bad enough, even the comb sucks! How do you screw up a comb?! It&#x27;s angled and makes it very difficult to trim around the ears. Do not waste your money on this product!</li>
    <li> I searches coreless razors and this came up, I was caught by the color.  Got it and it had a cord.  Returned.</li>
    <li> These clippers are a great value.  They work quite well (though you may have to go over the same spot once or twice to make sure all the hairs are trimmed).  The little plastic bag the whole apparatus comes in is a bit chintzy, and you really have to work to get everything to squeeze in there.  But, considering that you can buy the whole set for approximately the price of ONE haircut, the slight drawbacks are pretty minuscule.</li>
    <li> The clippers come in what looks to be a teenager ... young hot rod type of box... which I found very corny.. but whatever, it&#x27;s just packaging.    The clippers when turned on are very quiet.. This was one of the most important things for me to know when reading a review...     Seem to clip well the few times I&#x27;ve used it, I haven&#x27;t really broken them in yet.</li>
    <li> Durable and smooth, this a perfect for getting rid of unwanted body hair or giving yourself a haircut.  Well balanced and durable.</li>
    <li> Be aware of the misleading picture. This is NOT a cordless trimmer.  The picture is completely deceiving as this is a corded trimmer.</li>
    <li> So far it&#x27;s great! I&#x27;ve used it a couple times to cut my hair and it does a great job! Haven&#x27;t used it on my beard yet but it seems like it would work just fine. Plenty of attachments to get a nice blend as well as long as you know what your doing</li>
    <li> Great razor. It is the second one I bought. I only bought another because I brought it overseas and shorted it out from the different wattage.</li>
    <li> This is the only clipper I&#x27;ve had that cuts my head perfectly bald without having to modify the metal clipping plates! As long as these are available to buy, I will continue to use them!</li>
    <li> it was a lot bigger then I thought and I thought it was just a beard trimmer it is a full size hair trimmer with two different size heads  one for hair and  one for beard  and it plugs in not batterie  I have to stop at walmart to picup a batterie beard trimmer now so I know what I&#x27;m getting. I did use to do hair cut I liketo get  #2  buzz  it works good but I need someone to do the neck line. I just wished I did not use that way I could return fun fun</li>
    <li> Bought this for my son, he&#x27;s very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Big and good quality ,,many parts for different types off cuts, bought for my boyfriend and he likes it, bye.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for years and recently the power supply for my old trimmer broke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After shopping around I decided to purchase this new trimmer and it is fantastic. It cuts clean, fast and doesn&#x27;t not pull on your hair as it trims. (I&#x27;m mentioning this because I tried a different brand and the other brand pulled as it cut, ouch!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer has a normal speed and a high speed button which does come in handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also it has a separate smaller trimming blade and smaller attachments for that blade as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I was not 100% satisfied about was the storage bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set comes with a small bag to hold the trimming accessories but the trimmer doesn&#x27;t fit in the bag, only the accessories. My old Conair trimmer came with a hard case to hold everything which is nice, it kept everything together and kept things clean. But I&#x27;m sure a small Tupperware or box would work just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
    <li> Conair HCT425GBV The Chopper 2 in 1 Custom Styler 24 Piece Complete...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this sell was on time, fast, would buy again.</li>
    <li> It runs very quiet. Easy to use. It gives smooth hair cut and trimming. It is as good look as the picture.</li>
    <li> Great product,I chose this rating,because the ergonomics are great it fits well in your hand.I would highly recommend this clipper.It works great.</li>
    <li> Absolutely horrible!!!  I&#x27;ve been cutting hair for family and friends since 2000.  I couldn&#x27;t get these to cut any hair!!!  All it did was get tangled in the hair.  I tried it without a guide on my arm hairs (which are really sparse); and it wouldn&#x27;t even cut those!!!  The worst clippers ever.  I tried going over the same section on his hair over and over again.  15 times! And I still couldn&#x27;t get it all cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted Conair for a refund and no response.  They don&#x27;t even have the respect to give customers&#x27; their money back when they realize what a pathetic product they&#x27;ve just purchased.</li>
    <li> Great buy. My boyfriend loves it lol i got as a christmas gift because he was dying to have his own. I actually enjoy cutting his hair with. However i just wish the power cord was a bit longer or that it was able to charge or something but otherwise it was a great buy.</li>
    <li> Should have read the description closer. Thought it was a cordless.</li>
    <li> We bought this buzzer a short while ago. My husband used it 8 times to cut his very fine hair. He decide he wanted to change out the optional head piece only to discover it was broker/defective. The item has never been dropped and is always stored securely. Cuts hair great but stinks we only got to use 8 times.</li>
    <li> I really like this clipper, there light sharp and compact.. it&#x27;s a good product i like it, it works great.</li>
    <li> keep it oiled and this is an amazing buy saved me a ton of money on haircuts. ill prolly need a new one soon and would def buy this one again.</li>
    <li> Beautiful set that when my husband saw it, he immediately ordered him a set. Brand new in excellent shape and package and a great price too. I love the double attachments that will help someone like myself who know little about cutting hair more confident. Its easy to use and I can&#x27;t wait to get the most use out of it!</li>
    <li> With a name like \\&quot;The Chopper\\&quot; and a picture of a bald guy on the box, I expected a little more.  Especially with this being a corded clipper.  I expected this to replace my 3 year old Norelco QC5170.  Unfortunately, even after going over my head with \\&quot;the Chopper,\\&quot; my old faithful Norelco was still able to trim closer and more evenly.  The Chopper is headed back to the store.&lt;br /&gt;Very under-impressed with this product and I would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> Works better then My $10.00 conair bought from walmart 3 years ago that one work well too but this has more options. Only con its not a weed wacker for hair</li>
    <li> The worse shave machine!!!! I will never recommend this machine!!! Dont cut anything!!! If i can return this conair i will do it , but i already used!!!</li>
    <li> A must have for the ones who prefer to have their beard as a afternoon shadow</li>
    <li> on the box it showed a guy shaving his head clean as a whistle with it but when you read the instructions packed inside it tells you to complete the process you have to shave with a razor, It is false advertising as it said bald on the box, also it is bulky. If you want a trimmer for your beard buy the cordless one Conair sells, it is tiny compared to this and works better. If you want to shave your head use a razor</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my Fiance for Christmas. Came in time, in original package, all parts. I personally have not used it, but he loves it!</li>
    <li> wonderful product, I used it immediately when it arrived and it worked perfectly for me. Please buy this product you will be amazed by its perfection.</li>
    <li> The clippers are very decent after just trying them, however the description, the images and the details are deceptive. The \\&quot;bag\\&quot; they show in the picture is like a shaving kit/man&#x27;s travel bag. But that&#x27;s not what you get. Instead its a pouch very thin, flimsy &amp; pull string ? Lol... Then the search engine words used were cordless. No where in the images does it show a cord? However, its corded. The picture also depicts orange &amp; black product, yet description says yellow? Wow.. If your looking for decent corded clippers, good buy. If like myself you want cordless, it is not. And don&#x27;t expect cool looking bag either.</li>
    <li> I just got this and actually got delivered in a day so that was great. I shaved my head the fastest I&#x27;ve ever shaven my head and the turbo mode is great on it. Anyone that is complaining about is obviously a newbie and doesn&#x27;t know how to work clippers especially at this price it is a steal. Thanks again.</li>
    <li> This gives me a great haircuts and can be adjusted for the level that I need. So far it seem very powerful, I just wish it was wireless.</li>
    <li> Really good trimmer works great in any type of hair I got it for my brothers and they like it.</li>
    <li> I love them! Very easy to use. I used them to cut my husbands hair and my little dogs hair. I didn&#x27;t know they were corded when ordered them, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
    <li> This thing is great, makes cutting your own hair very easy.  Also, the pouch is a nice touch, to keep all the pieces neat.</li>
    <li> This trimmer not only does it terrific job, it does it quietly. Such a wonderful surprise.</li>
    <li> warning appears to be cordless, NOT! read the description.</li>
    <li> Very bad product. Pulled my hair when it was working and then wire short circuited after a year. Threw it away.</li>
    <li> This is a nice clipper/trimmer.  Lightweight, fairly quiet, and suitably balanced.  I cut my own hair so a cautious control is necessary.  After cutting I discovered the clipper head is removable for placement of the trimmer head.</li>
    <li> Bought for personal use to replace older model that has worn out. Has a lighter, more flexible power cord than the older model and retains the slide button to adjust depth of cut (much more accurate and reliable than the side lever on other makes). Otherwise it has all the excellent features that made the earlier model a standout.</li>
    <li> Our son-in-law was very happy to receive this. He loves this shaver since he has had one like this before.</li>
    <li> Well packaged, ready for retail or resale. Quality clippers made from aluminum. Every crack and crevice is a perfect fit, so hair wont ever get stuck in those hard to clean places. First use went through a 1&amp;#34; beard with no effort, first pass. Very impressive piece of engineering.  Follow up: So it&#x27;s been six months since I bought these clippers. They work like a champ and still sharp as the day I bought them. I&#x27;m still disappointed that the picture appears to show cordless clippers but they are corded. To me that misrepresents the product. However, the cord is long enough that I can sit on the toilet and mow the lawn. Cmon, ya&#x27;ll know that&#x27;s what you do too. Hey, at least that&#x27;s an honest review. : P</li>
    <li> It has many uses that I&#x27;m not interested in.  The one thing I wanted, a side burn trimmer, works pretty well.</li>
    <li> easy to use and change from beard hair trimmer. every attachment you can need.</li>
    <li> I had another Conair clipper al,ost identical to this one. Except it was yellow. I had the yellow one for at least 6 years. The motor still worked great and most of the pieces had held together. But, I had to replace it due to that at the bottom of the clipper where the power cord comes out, it was loosing contact or was not receiving power to keep the clipper on when plugged in. I figured I got my monies worth after years of service, so buying another Conair was not a question. I came. I saw, I purchased. Well not a month later the very same thing that happened to my old clipper happened to this brand new one. I had to hold the power cord firmly against the side of the clippers for it to stay on. Enough is enough. I got tired of that rather quickly and went to a local barber shop and got some recommendations and ended buying a new set from a barber there. Do not recommend.</li>
    <li> i ordered this and it worked great for a month and then stoppped working i ended up throwing it away and buying a diffrent brand</li>
    <li> 5star performance 3star quality. I really love it so I bought a second one invade I drop this one. I don&#x27;t think it will survive a fall. But it works so well . I hope they make one the same but more rugeed.</li>
