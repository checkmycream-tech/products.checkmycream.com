    <li> This was an excellent gift for my 5 year old who requested strawberry perfume from Santa this year! When I saw strawberry perfume her letter to Santa I immediately thought, &amp;#34;Where can I buy such a think appropriate for a kid.&amp;#34; While I did find some strawberry scented body sprays, I knew she wanted a real glass bottle of perfume like mom has. This did it! Its not too mature in look or scent. It&#x27;s also not overbearing when she sprays it 100 times a day. It&#x27;s a nice pleasant scent and it works well for tweens and even adults who like to smell fruity. Nice job.</li>

    <li> I purchased this product because I love Hello Kitty and it was cheap. I was only planning to use it for body spray because I figured it would be cheap perfume because of the price. When I first smelled the perfume I could not believe it. It smells wonderful and doesnt smell cheap at all.!! the bottle is beautiful as well. It is a very large bottle to be perfume and the price is unbeleivable!! I am very satisfied.
