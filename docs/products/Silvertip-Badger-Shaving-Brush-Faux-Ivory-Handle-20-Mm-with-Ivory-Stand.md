      <li>Thanks again.</li>

<li> I&#x27;ve switched back to wet shaving after years with my electric shaver.  </li>
<li> This brush costs much less than the most expensive silver-tip badger shaving brushes.  </li>
<li> Other than that, I would definitely recommend this brush.</li>
<li> Other reviewers are experiencing the same problem-you would think Amazon and seller would do something for their customers</li>
<li> I owned a standard Boar hair brush and within two years the epoxy broke down</li>

<li> The only complaint I have is that the handle gets a bit slippery when my hands are wet, so I occasionally drop the brush.</li>
<li> The stand is a joke as it is not tall enough to let the brush hang free of the base when inverted to dry.  </li>
<li> Any silver-tip badger makes any other material or lower grade badger brush feel like brillo.</li>
<li> I guess that may be why the price was less.  </li>
<li> they are priced a little lower there than Amazon.  </li>
<li> It comes with a matching stand, cleaning instructions, and a nifty little cloth.</li>
<li> You&#x27;ll have to be 100 dollar plus range to improve any on the quality, I&#x27;ve been useing now a few weeks, I think 1 hair has fallin out.</li>
<li> Well let me tell you, I ues this brush everyday.  </li>
<li> I have very little if any hair loss.</li>
<li> not good.</li>
<li> Absolutely NO hair loss,NO bad smells.</li>
<li> Crap brush, bristles falling out after 2 months moderate (2-3 times per week) use.</li>
<li> Guess it was a bad choice and waste of money.</li>
<li> Only problem is that it sheds terribly.</li>
<li> You can not have your brush spread eagle on the bottom of the stand because the manufactured fail to make it taller.</li>

    <li> I owned a standard Boar hair brush and within two years the epoxy broke down and I started loosing hair every time I shaved.  This Silvertip Badger brush is so nice and soft, produces a much better fluffy cream, and no hair loss.  REALLY happy with this new brush!</li>
    <li> Thought I had reviewed this brush. Well let me tell you, I ues this brush everyday.  I have very little if any hair loss. Holds heat well and blooms nicely. This is one great brush and well worth twice the price. I will buy more and the price is great and is a silver tip. Thanks again.</li>
    <li> After hunting for a while for a quality shaving brush, I purchased a  Frank&#x27;s Shaving silvertip brush, 24mm from ebay-they are priced a little lower there than Amazon.  It arrived today, I opened the box and I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes- this brush is awesome!  I checked out the brushes at  Art of Shaving a few weeks ago before ordering from Frank&#x27;s and was tempted to fork out the big bucks for one of their brushes.  Good thing I didn&#x27;t because the quality of my Frank&#x27;s brush is about equal to AOS, but only a fifth of the cost!  Don&#x27;t buy into the Art of Shaving shtick- a good brush is a good brush regardless of the insignia on the handle.  Great communication with this company as well.  If you&#x27;re on the fence, go for it!</li>
    <li> If you read the shaving forums Frank&#x27;s is reviewed inconsistent on quality. I won&#x27;t sell mine for triple the price. If the one you receive is&lt;br /&gt;bad quality, ask for a replacement. Just get one.</li>
    <li> I could not have made a better choice. For the price, you cant beat this brush.  Very soft, holds a ton of water, does not shed, and has virtually no animal smell. The only complaint I have is that the handle gets a bit slippery when my hands are wet, so I occasionally drop the brush. Other than that, I would definitely recommend this brush.</li>
    <li> Very soft brush that holds water well.  Probably one of the best for the price.  The stand is just a little plastic thing but works pretty well and I&#x27;m happy with it</li>
    <li> good Price but sheds like crazy the Hairs seem like good quality been using for about 2 months now i detest the shedding</li>
    <li> I have to give it a 5+. It&#x27;s the best brush I&#x27;ve ever had. Absolutely NO hair loss,NO bad smells. It was delivered in a timely manner as well. I will definately be back. ******* ;-)</li>
    <li> No bristles came out at first. After about three weeks of use, it started. The brush is rinsed and hangs in the holder in open air each day. Now losing 15 to 20 bristles/day! Many get caught in the razor,not good! Tried to contact the seller w/no luck, beyond Amazon return date, tried to contact seller phone-no luck there either. Guess it was a bad choice and waste of money. Other reviewers are experiencing the same problem-you would think Amazon and seller would do something for their customers</li>
    <li> Crap brush, bristles falling out after 2 months moderate (2-3 times per week) use. Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> you can spend a ton more for a similar brush, but this is best deal going for silver-tip badger. Any silver-tip badger makes any other material or lower grade badger brush feel like brillo. Buy one (or two) and relegate your old brush to the travel kit.</li>
    <li> Been using this Frank shaving silvertip badger hair brush.. It&#x27;s soft, holds plenty of water and keeps lather warm.  Brush is more medium size then small. My large hands fit comfortable around it. Makes plenty of lather, enough to hold 3 passes worth and a little more..this brush is nice, it looks better then these pictures show and works great..You&#x27;ll have to be 100 dollar plus range to improve any on the quality, I&#x27;ve been useing now a few weeks, I think 1 hair has fallin out. It&#x27;s maintained its shape really well.Packaging is very up scale and the included color matched holder fits perfect. Great choice for beginners or replacing an old one like I am ( I had an old boars hair ) when your being budget minded. This is a big improvement, I highly recommend it..</li>
    <li> cheap but loses bristles fast.  you will find them in your scuttle by the dozens.  not good.</li>
    <li> Very soft. Lathers well. Feels good in the hand. Only problem is that it sheds terribly. Do all brushes shed like this? I am losing 5-10 hairs every shave.</li>
    <li> This is definetly one of the best brushes you can purchase at this price. It comes with a matching stand, cleaning instructions, and a nifty little cloth. A real must have for any shaving kit that is legit.</li>
    <li> What a fantastic brush! A bit soft for building lather in a bowl, but it works well enough. I use soap sticks so I am a face latherer. It&#x27;s HUGE! It took a bit of getting used to slathering this monster all over my face, but it holds a ton of lather. It feels fantastic and lathers up well, though I had to use the old trick of leaving the lather on the bristles for a couple of days when I first got it. The handle looks a bit cheesy, and the stand is a joke, but the bristles are so nice, I recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve switched back to wet shaving after years with my electric shaver.  Did my homework to ensure I got the right tools.  This product provides outstanding performance at vastly reduced price compared to many &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34; shaving lines.  The brush is soft, holds water well and lathers nicely either in the soap dish or on my face.  The stand is a joke as it is not tall enough to let the brush hang free of the base when inverted to dry.  Get the COL Conk brush/shaver stand and kill two birds with one stone.</li>
    <li> The brush is very well and great. The stand is a piece of junk. You can not have your brush spread eagle on the bottom of the stand because the manufactured fail to make it taller. If you but this junk the stand and you will be fine.</li>
    <li> Just switched from gel to brush and shaving soap.  I can&#x27;t imagine how the more expensive brushes could be any better than this one. I&#x27;ve not seen a single hair fall out, and it whips the soap into a really good lather.</li>
    <li> This brush costs much less than the most expensive silver-tip badger shaving brushes.  It works very well, but each time I use it, it seems to lose a bristle or two.  I&#x27;m wondering how much longer this can go on before all the bristles fall out.  I guess that may be why the price was less.  The most expensive ones seem to be in the range of $80 or more.  Maybe the more expensive ones don&#x27;t lose bristles like mine is doing.</li>
    <li> I have had this brush for three weeks. At first, it would lose a bristle here or there. However, last night about 10 came out and tonight I counted twenty. If this trend doesn&#x27;t reverse itself soon, I will be asking for a refund.</li>
    <li> I love this brush , it&#x27;s easy to hold on to and doesn&#x27;t shed . It holds soap great. Very well worth the money.</li>
    <li> This is a very high quality Badger brush, but it is not a silvertip. I have used a silvertip for years and it is much softer than this one. This is equivalent to the Parker Badger I got, as well as to an off-shore knock-off. If it had been advertised as a fine badger I&#x27;d be giving it 5 stars as it appears to be excellent quality. But, like the headline says, Silvertip it ain&#x27;t.</li>
