    <li> Rich Sable is the only color that accurately matches my eyebrows. I can fill them in with it,without looking like I filled them in. I bought an extra one of these as a spare, since they&#x27;ve been discontinued.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for this! It&#x27;s no longer in the stores. But I won&#x27;t pay $31.99 for something I paid $3.50 for. I&#x27;ll stop wearing make-up first. I&#x27;ll just keep looking for a good hilighter.</li>
    <li> Great price and quick delivery.  I love this product for eyebrow fill in, it doesn&#x27;t flake and goes on smoothly and has just the right amount of darkness, looks natural on the brows.</li>
    <li> Good value for the money</li>
    <li> I go out of my way to purchase this discontinued product. I don&#x27;t use it for my lids, but rather for filling in my brows. The color works perfect for me, it stays put, and obviously matte is needed for my purpose.</li>
