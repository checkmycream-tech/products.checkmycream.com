### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Still looking for the perfect one though.</li>
      <li>GREAT PRODUCT.</li>
      <li>The shades aren&#x27;t great.  </li>
      <li>These are great for color correction.  </li>
      <li>It has worked great for me.  </li>
      <li>BUT its a great deal for people who don&#x27;t do makeup</li>
      <li>These blend right into my skin and match perfectly!</li>
      <li>They are small bottles, but it worked great for what I needed - great price too!</li>
      <li>I also have very light skin and many types of makeup look orange or smear brown on me.  </li>
      <li>It is light weight and goes on nice.</li>
      <li>Maybelline is much more better than this one.</li>
      <li>But I have had better coverage make up.  </li>
      <li>but it could be better.</li>
      <li>It cakes on my skin and makes it look like I have more wrinkles.  </li>
      <li>They are light weight, and if you learn how to use them they work like magic.  </li>
      <li>I recommend this to all ladies with fine lines and redness on the cheeks, under the eyes and the forehead.  </li>
      <li>Yellow is great for under eyes.  </li>
      <li>They do not go on smoothly nor do the hide the imperfections and do use the highlighter from time to time.</li>
      <li>In case you were wondering I am latin with an almond tone and light to medium skin tone.</li>
      <li>I use the beige concealer on top, if not I apply the Almay Smart Shade Smart Balance foundation and looks really good and natural, it deffinitely helps me feel better and confident.  </li>
      <li>I really liked this product, I have sensitive skin, hormonal acne is one of my problems</li>
      <li>In all other instances when I use #2, it&#x27;s great.</li>
      <li>Still trying to figure out the correct application of the green to get the promised affect but very happy with steps 2 and 3, they work very well.</li>
      <li>I bought the tan and pink colors in a set of other make-up and loved them so much that I had to buy more!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never bought a product exactly like this, I&#x27;ll buy it again.  </li>
      <li>Since I have too many red blotches it doesn&#x27;t give me the coverage I need.</li>
      <li>It does a great job covering al my other prob areas so unless its for under eye only I would recomend</li>
      <li>If you have an dry skin around those target areas, this stuff immediately picks up on it, and will even flake the skin more.</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t like this product.  </li>
      <li>I would describe the bottle sizes as \\&quot;sample\\&quot; sizes because you don&#x27;t get soo much</li>
      <li>I do really like this conceler</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t need to apply too much.</li>
      <li>These cover better than any other foundation, primer, cover, etc.</li>
      <li>often or only want to cover parts as needed vs the whole</li>
      <li>This takes the redness out of my complexion completely.</li>
      <li>I use the green and yellow most often.  </li>
      <li>The highlighter sometimes make my dark circles more obvious and I feel like the concealer is a tad bit dry and cakey.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s ok, at least for people who only need medium coverage.</li>
      <li>A good mix to hide angry red blemishes and spots.</li>
      <li>some reason, when I ordered these online, the concealers were pretty dried out and there wasn&#x27;t a ton in the bottle.</li>
      <li>It really tones down the redness.  </li>

<li> It really tones down the redness.  </li>
<li> NOT last long...  </li>
<li> Usually one of these at normal size will last me a month or two.</li>
<li> The green doesn&#x27;t actually negate red spots on Caucasian faces.  </li>
<li> I ordered this online for ease but would usually pick up the #2 color concealer (pictured here) directly from the store.</li>
<li> I usually apply a tiny green dot on the area I need to cover the red, then I blend it and if the área is too big</li>
<li> Never really used #1 or #3.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used the green to minimize red cheeks and noses before applying foundation.  </li>
<li> Each of the different liquids was very thick and gooey in consistency and dried to a very cakey mess after application.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve never had a problem with Physicians Formula products in the past; however the mineral wear correcting concealer is not at all what I had expected from such a well known and trusted brand.</li>
<li> The quality is so poor, the price is high.</li>
<li> The highlighter is actually closer to my skin tone, so I would try to use that as concealer, but the dry, cakey appearance quickly turned me off.  :(</li>
<li> I&#x27;ll have to try other products.</li>
<li> The green and yellow go on thick and once blended, leave a dry, cakey appearance.</li>
<li> This product is not worth buying.</li>
<li> and I&#x27;m not real sure why.  </li>
<li> I saw some people complaining about how the green concealer leaves a greyish hue</li>
<li> too small and little substance</li>
<li> THERE WAS HARDLY IN ANY THE BOTTLES, I USED IT 2 TIMES</li>
<li> I am not thrilled with them</li>
<li> Not good for people who want all over coverage..</li>
<li> My daughter had actually told me that it looked awful.</li>
<li> but it dosent cover my horrible dark circles as well as I would like</li>
<li> The highlighter isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
<li> But, not to say they&#x27;re bad... just not for me..</li>
<li> So disappointed with this product.</li>
<li> and I was looking for a product that would help on my worst days.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The bottles are smaller than I thought and the product doesn&#x27;t blend well at all one bit. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend the product to friends and family or even strangers. I&#x27;ll have to try other products.</li>
    <li> This product is not worth buying. I used it once since i got them and never used them again. They do not go on smoothly nor do the hide the imperfections and do use the highlighter from time to time.</li>
    <li> I like these... I am not thrilled with them and I&#x27;m not real sure why.  But I have had better coverage make up.  Tiny bottles that&lt;br /&gt;do NOT last long...  I wil not purchase them again...  But, not to say they&#x27;re bad... just not for me..</li>
    <li> The green and yellow go on thick and once blended, leave a dry, cakey appearance. Not a fan at all. If you have an dry skin around those target areas, this stuff immediately picks up on it, and will even flake the skin more. The highlighter isn&#x27;t bad. It is light weight and goes on nice. Don&#x27;t need to apply too much. Still looking for the perfect one though.</li>
    <li> Not good for people who want all over coverage.. I would describe the bottle sizes as \\&quot;sample\\&quot; sizes because you don&#x27;t get soo much BUT its a great deal for people who don&#x27;t do makeup often or only want to cover parts as needed vs the whole face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The applicator looks like the type on lip-gloss (not a \\&quot;brush\\&quot; head)... I don&#x27;t care for it aside from using it to put spots of the concealer on areas I want to cover and then using my fingers or a makeup brush to cover and blend.</li>
    <li> I bought the tan and pink colors in a set of other make-up and loved them so much that I had to buy more!  These cover better than any other foundation, primer, cover, etc. that I have ever tried!  I also have very light skin and many types of makeup look orange or smear brown on me.  These blend right into my skin and match perfectly!</li>
    <li> THERE WAS HARDLY IN ANY THE BOTTLES, I USED IT 2 TIMES AND THEY WERE ALL GONE</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had a problem with Physicians Formula products in the past; however the mineral wear correcting concealer is not at all what I had expected from such a well known and trusted brand. Each of the different liquids was very thick and gooey in consistency and dried to a very cakey mess after application. My daughter had actually told me that it looked awful. So disappointed with this product. Buyer beware.</li>
    <li> I really liked this product, I have sensitive skin, hormonal acne is one of my problems and I get 2 to 3 zits-like from time to time which leave my skin red and I was looking for a product that would help on my worst days.  These concealers have helped a lot.  They are light weight, and if you learn how to use them they work like magic.  I usually apply a tiny green dot on the area I need to cover the red, then I blend it and if the área is too big I use the beige concealer on top, if not I apply the Almay Smart Shade Smart Balance foundation and looks really good and natural, it deffinitely helps me feel better and confident.  It has worked great for me.  In case you were wondering I am latin with an almond tone and light to medium skin tone.</li>
    <li> These are great for color correction.  I use the green and yellow most often.  I&#x27;ve used the green to minimize red cheeks and noses before applying foundation.  It really tones down the redness.  Yellow is great for under eyes.  The key is to use these correctly.  They need to be used PRIOR to your foundation because you need to neutralize your redness, blotchiness, marks, scars, etc before you apply foundation to cover.</li>
    <li> A Must Have and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin oily at all. A good mix to hide angry red blemishes and spots. Works well and we recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This takes the redness out of my complexion completely. I use the concealer to over the puffiness under my eyes. I&#x27;ve never bought a product exactly like this, I&#x27;ll buy it again.  I recommend this to all ladies with fine lines and redness on the cheeks, under the eyes and the forehead.  GREAT PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> Not maximum coverage but it&#x27;s ok, at least for people who only need medium coverage. I saw some people complaining about how the green concealer leaves a greyish hue but that&#x27;s all green concealers regardless of brand, the trick is not to use too much. Since I have too many red blotches it doesn&#x27;t give me the coverage I need. The highlighter sometimes make my dark circles more obvious and I feel like the concealer is a tad bit dry and cakey. I don&#x27;t dislike it but it could be better.</li>
    <li> Still trying to figure out the correct application of the green to get the promised affect but very happy with steps 2 and 3, they work very well.</li>
    <li> They are small bottles, but it worked great for what I needed - great price too!</li>
    <li> I do really like this conceler but it dosent cover my horrible dark circles as well as I would like but then again nothing does! It does a great job covering al my other prob areas so unless its for under eye only I would recomend</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t like this product.  It cakes on my skin and makes it look like I have more wrinkles.  The shades aren&#x27;t great.  The green doesn&#x27;t actually negate red spots on Caucasian faces.

    <li> I ordered this online for ease but would usually pick up the #2 color concealer (pictured here) directly from the store. Never really used #1 or #3. In all other instances when I use #2, it&#x27;s great. You don&#x27;t need a ton of it and it lasts all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For some reason, when I ordered these online, the concealers were pretty dried out and there wasn&#x27;t a ton in the bottle. Usually one of these at normal size will last me a month or two. This one only lasted 2 weeks max, and that&#x27;s with me rationing it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I ordered this again, I would head to the store and pick it up in person and only get the color I need.</li>
    <li> The quality is so poor, the price is high. I won&#x27;t buy any product from this brand. Maybelline is much more better than this one.</li>
    <li> too small and little substance</li>
