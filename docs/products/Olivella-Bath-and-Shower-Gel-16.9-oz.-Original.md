<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The Olivella shower gel and facial cleanser don&#x27;t leave my skin dry.  Other soaps left my skin dry and itchy.  I would definitely recommend this and especially in the fall and winter months.</li>
    <li> Very good for dry skin.  If you want bubbles this is not the one.</li>
    <li> These products are wonderful. Skin feels softer &amp; I feel less itchy because of the Oliveira products  use. Love the shampoo &amp; conditioner as well. Leaves hair really soft</li>
    <li> This product delivered for me... the fresh scent and softness, was wonderful... olive oil will do that for&lt;br /&gt;your skin.</li>
    <li> This product does not lather, probably because it&#x27;s mostly natural. On the plus side, it does leave the skin soft and fragrant. It has a lovely clean smell and doesn&#x27;t dry or leave a stretched-skin like most soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also a little bit on the runny side; I end up using too much of the product because of this.</li>
    <li> Fresh scent, great product!</li>
    <li> The Good: smells great, cleans well, all natural, and great feel after use.&lt;br /&gt;The Bad: lathers well but doesn&#x27;t last long, I have to reapply to my loofah so two semi-liberal uses every shower means it goes fast; product packaging isn&#x27;t too great, my bottle leaked a bit during shipping and made a mess, nothing too bad though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s the long and the short of it. It&#x27;s a great product but I&#x27;ll try another before I buy again. It&#x27;s my first foray into all natural hygiene products and I&#x27;ve noticed my body is trying to get used to it. I have a very slight itch on my arms and upper back after using but it fades quickly, usually about 30 seconds or so. Other than that I do recommend you try this product, I actually like it a lot but want to try others before sticking to one.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Really helps my African American skin with the dryness. I use it every other day. It is a must have for me</li>
    <li> Love this bath gel - particularly like it for cleansing my face and chafed areas.  It doesn&#x27;t suds but does remove oils and makeup.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> great service very good product</li>
    <li> This is a great body wash!  I started using it when I had huge skin issues.... unknown cause of eczema - and it resolved my issue and has my skin in the best condition ever!</li>
    <li> WORKS FANTASTIC ON MY DRY WINTER SKIN&lt;br /&gt;EASY TO USE AND DOES NOT LEAVE MY SKIN FEELING GREASY. LOVE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> The product has absolutely no lather as one would expect from a soap, and coverage is not great.  Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> I have used this soap for years. As an senior citizen my skin is getting dryer every year. Even though this soap is made from olive oil, it does not leave the skin feeling greasy.  Somehow the olive oil helps to keep the moisture in your skin and I don&#x27;t need as much moisturizer.  I use it with one of those plastic scruffy to make it lather.  I have also used the shower and bath gel but I prefer the soap bars--it works better for me.</li>
    <li> No frills, affordable shower gel that leaves your skin soft without  lot of fragrance. Keeps skin from drying out.  Have used repeatedly and am very pleased.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product while I was working at Ross Dress for Less stores and have fell in love with it.  I&#x27;m down to my last few drops of the bottle and can&#x27;t be without it.  I use it in the shower and in the bath.  I love the crisp clean scent and it feels so moisturizing on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d definitely recommend it to a friend and will purchase it as long as they have it in stock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a must item for my spa bath.</li>
    <li> I purchased this by mistake, I wanted the face and body gel but to my surprise it was&lt;br /&gt;even better than I could have imagined.  I now have a new product to add to my list&lt;br /&gt;of favorites.  The scent is so fresh as well as the gel leaves your skin soft and smooth&lt;br /&gt;for hours.  Sometimes, mistakes can be good.</li>
    <li> clean product and I recommend it for all skin types. my skin stays clear and radiant due to olive oil</li>
    <li> I really like olive oil containing soaps and lotions.  The product has a lovely scent and moisturizes as it cleans.  Fabulous stuff!</li>
    <li> Works ok. I guess I must have very dry skin.</li>
    <li> It performs well as shower soap for face and body, olive oil is amazing given your skin a good daily protection.</li>
