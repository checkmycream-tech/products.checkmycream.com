<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> great lotion! tingle isn&#x27;t too intense and color is immediate.</li>
    <li> Excellent tingle/bronzer lotion, could tell a difference after just one use!! Recommend to any tanner wanting to get past their tanning plateau!! Super fast shipping and product was sealed, will order from this seller again!! Thanks:-)</li>
    <li> Love this lotion, it is very hot though so use with caution. Fast shipping great experience, thanks All American Tanning!</li>
    <li> This product does tingle to a small degree, (there are better ones to chose from) however if you don&#x27;t like the &amp;#34;streaked orange&amp;#34; effect, I would suggest you continue your search for the &amp;#34;Mega Extreme XXX Sizzling Tingle&amp;#34; lotion.</li>
    <li> I am an experienced tanner, I love the trinity 3 lotion but have been having difficulty finding it in stock places... so I thought I would try this. I am very pleased with the results, I wouldn&#x27;t say it is the most hottest tingle lotion I have experienced but it is most definitely has a warming effect. it does not leave me feeling greasy and I enjoy the scent. I also have it doesn&#x27;t leave you red for too long after your session. I would but this product again. it also shipped very fast</li>
    <li> Tingle is not overpoweing but great bronzer overall - Lotion is not as thick as original Trinity the bottle last longer</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  Only downside is the smell.  However you get amazing results that is an actual tan versus just a wash off bronzer.  Not for someone who doesnt like tinglers.</li>
    <li> Super Fast. I Always buy this lotion. Pleased once again :)</li>
    <li> I used to use tingle indoor tanning lotion all the time until I had my kids noticing that after I would touch them they would turn red in the spot I touched them.  When I realized it&#x27;s transferable to them, I stopped using Tingle. I was having a difficult time tanning the bottoms of my ankles and feet so I thought I would use some tingle just on my lower leg by my ankles and the tops of my feet. During my tanning I felt no tingle, even after I was done tanning I still felt no tingling.  About 5 hours later, we were at a cookout for this past 4th of July and my ankles and feet literally felt like they were on fire and burning!!!  I could not take it...it kept getting worse and it hurt soo bad!  BY this time that part of my body was red and swollen; I couldn&#x27;t even wear my flip-flops. It was ONLY in the areas I put this tingle...Trinity XS...I had my fiancée take me to the ER because I could not take it!  The doctor&#x27;s told me I had 2nd degree burns on my ankles and feet!! Burn blisters formed all over my ankles and feet and I had to keep them wrapped up for 2 weeks. It&#x27;s STILL healing to this day!  I would NOT recommended this product to anyone!  It doesn&#x27;t tell you it can give you 2nd degree burns on the bottle.</li>
    <li> This product is &amp;#34;OK.&amp;#34;  I&#x27;ve been using tingle lotions for years and I bought this based on the reviews stating that it was intensely hot and the results were supposedly phenomenal.  I don&#x27;t agree.  It&#x27;s not hot at all. In fact, the original Trinity gives better results. I am sticking to Ed Hardy&#x27;s &amp;#34;Body Shots&amp;#34; as it is very hot and gives incredible color.</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I wanted and a pretty fast delivery:).</li>
    <li> I tried this lotion for the first time the other day and LOVED it. I am experienced with tingle lotions. I just recently started using an intensifier again; I had been using tingles for a year now. This lotion is by far the best tingle lotion I have ever used. I usually use the Pauly D tingle, the OC tingle and Ed hardys obnoxious and they are all great tingles but this was over the top. I did stay red longer than I do with the other tingles and it was more intense than any tingle I&#x27;ve ever used. The bronzer in it is excellent. Be careful when applying though because I have some stains on my hands from applying the lotion. I can see results from this lotion already and I have only used it once. It is $75 at my salon so I would def buy it off of here.</li>
    <li> Great love it hot as hell!!!</li>
    <li> I have worked at a tanning salon for over 3 years. So I look at ingredients when I am choosing lotions. Benzyl Nicotinate is the tingle ingredient and its the 2nd ingredient listed on the bottle. DHA which is the delayed Bronzer that stays on after you shower is the 4th ingredient (dihydroxyacetone). Aloe is the first ingredient and that is why this position surpasses in quality above many tingles currently on the market. It is extremely hot so I would not use it unless you are experienced with tingles. The lady that got 2nd degree burns I would want to know if you used the whole packet of lotion on those spots that you got the burns and also if you have sensitive skin as well as how long your stayed in the bed. There are many factors that play into how well a lotion works or doesn&#x27;t work. If you don&#x27;t know how a tingle works and want to know this is how... The active ingredient in a tingle causes blood to circulate towards the uppermost layer of the skin. Blood carries hemoglobin and hemoglobin carries oxygen, oxygen stimulates your melanin cells and your melanin cells produce your tan. If you excite them with oxygen they darken. All a tan is is melanocytes that darken around your cell nucleus to protect the DNA in the nucleus from sun damage. Your natural defense against the sun.</li>
    <li> I love love love this tanning lotion! If you want to get super dark in 2 days and are an experienced tanner and can handle a tingle...you need to be using this. Best stuff ever. No problems with delivery or anything!</li>
    <li> Very hot! I could tell a difference after the first use. I highly recommend this lotion for people who like HOT tingle and bonzers!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. It does burn like a sunburn as you tan and you look pretty red for a short time after tanning. BUT! nothing tans like this stuff. I only tan twice a week and I stay with the color I like.  Not orange but a nice bronze. I do have to warn you though it will not act well as a base tan to keep you from bruning at the beach.</li>
    <li> I bought this after being a huge fan of Trinity 3! I was just thinking I would try the XS this time around.  I wish I had just stuck to Trinity 3 as it IMO tingled better, was a &amp;#34;hotter&amp;#34; lotion and I got a MEGA tan using it.  Next bottle I buy will be the original Trinity 3 like I had used before.  This lotion is just OK, but I just can&#x27;t give it a better review because IMO it is just not as good as Trinity 3.</li>
    <li> After using MOOD for years, my body seemed to have built a tolerance to it. I tried this as a sample at the tanning salon I worked for and fell in love. I felt so much darker after one visit. I used it again with the same results. I finally bought the full-sized bottle and I am so happy I did! It&#x27;s a pretty strong tingle, so beware of holding children or touching others after use. I actually like the scent of this lotion. I recommend it for experienced tingle users! :) Not recommended for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This is the best suntan lotion I have ever used !  I have been using this kind for years, I have wasted my money on several different  kinds trying them and I always come back to this one. It leaves you with a pretty color after laying out. If you are sensitive to lotions that have that tingle you will not like it. I love the tingle but my husband doesn&#x27;t..</li>
    <li> Was so hot it literally burnt my skin off I had to sit in an oatmeal bath for two hours.</li>
    <li> I really liked the tingle factor it does go away after short time. I was very satisfied with it I will use again..</li>
    <li> Love this...! Bronzer is darkening</li>
    <li> Excellent lotion! Must have a base tan to use since it has a strong tingler. Even the bronzer is great! Received so many compliments on my tan this summer after using this product!</li>
    <li> I have been a faithful user of Trinity tanning lotion and love the tingle factor and the heat.  This one didn&#x27;t bring either to the table.  I don&#x27;t know if the product was old or a knock off but I was disappointed with the results.  For a product with a title &amp;#34;Mega Extreme&amp;#34;.. it was a &amp;#34;mega flop&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try a lotion with tingle so, I did some research online and read a lot of reviews about trinity xs. This Is the first time I have ever used this product, I have got to say this lotion is super hot!I felt like I was on fire and I had to pass out. I am an experienced tanner and I wasn&#x27;t prepared for the heat from trinity xs. I could feel the tingle all day , even after I went to bed. I have been at a plateau and I read tingle lotion will do the trick. I have got to say after the first use I could tell a huge difference and I am so tan. I love this lotion and I will definitely buy it again. This is my new favorite tingle lotion. I am dying to try trinity 3.if you want a good tingle and a dark tan definitely buy this but only if you are ready for the heat. I would suggest this to only experienced tanners, and anyone who can tolerate a little sting. I give this lotion a 10!</li>
    <li> I tried this lotion from my salon I didn&#x27;t get a huge tingle from using this and I only have my out of winter base right now... How ever it did give me a more dramatic tan after 1 use. Here is the but.... You must rub this in all over EVENLY or it will leave you splotchy... When I tingle I sweat so it may have been just that making the lotion rub off in areas who knows. But it does not make you orange it is a pretty Bronze color for sure. Almost like spray tanning if they miss a spot but other than that worth the try!</li>
    <li> Best tingle ever!!! Very strong, great instant ab andd lasting color. Definitely for an experienced tingle tanner</li>
    <li> I received this product in 2 days and used it right away. It works very well, I have used many tanning lotions and this is my first time use Devoted Creations, and I was impressed. Is a good hot lotion, with amazing bronzers. Just make sure to wipe off your hands the bronzer in the lotion.</li>
    <li> I purchased Trinity XS recently and was extremely happy to do so given the excellent feedback I had seen online for it. Granted, the reviews were few and far between, but all were good and the negative few just complained about how hot the lotion was. And that was just what I wanted. So, perfect, I thought. Wrong. The lotion smells AWFUL!! So bad that I won&#x27;t use it without mixing it with a more pleasant scented lotion unless ill be going straight home. My very first time using this lotion alone I got what was easily described as my most intense sizzle ever, but, it happened just that one time. Time and time after that, with or without the use of other notions to mask the funk, I got a decent at best sizzle. I think I would be more satisfied with the quality of the sizzle if it just didn&#x27;t smell so bad. Ladies beware: I AM AN EXPERIENCED TANNER. WHAT I REFER TO AS A DECENT TINGLE MAY JUST AS WELL BE AN EXTREMELY HARSH SIZZLE TO YOU. THIS INFO INTENDED FOR EXPERIENCED MANNERS ONLY.</li>
    <li> Great tingle great product super fast shipping will buy from this company again</li>
    <li> Love this tingle lotion</li>
    <li> i have no doubt this is a quality lotion. The scent is too &amp;#34;flowery&amp;#34; and way over powering. This might be  the lotion for you. As for me, this product is going to be returned.</li>
    <li> This is a great lotion if you like a Tingle factor--it&#x27;s hot, so if you&#x27;ve never used a tanning lotion with a tingle factor I suggest you try something else first.  Love the silicone base and the way it feels on my skin.  The bronzing factor is nice as well, but just make sure you wash your hands after applying so you don&#x27;t get the bronzing effect between your fingers and that you don&#x27;t apply any \\&quot;tingle factor\\&quot; to any sensitive body parts.  Great deal on this lotion, especially if you don&#x27;t like the \\&quot;retail\\&quot; prices in your tanning salon.</li>
    <li> I LIKE THE SMELL,LOTION GOES ON SKIN LIKE SILK I WILL REORDER.GREAT PRICE ON THIS LOTION.RECIEVED MY ORDER AS PROMISED.</li>
    <li> Ive tanned for years and it wasn&#x27;t until about 3 years ago that i started getting into (trying out) these types of lotions. I personally love them; however if you don&#x27;t like the feel of being \\&quot;hot\\&quot; i wouldn&#x27;t recommend it. The best way for a \\&quot;newbie\\&quot; to understand a tingle is...chewing on a piece on Cinnamon gum. its hot but its not. and its only at first, but it wheres off as you chew. lotions work the same way. now, as far as this particular product: has a great tingle, works great! i loved it. i initially tried a sample at my local salon first then ordered it here when she told me it was 75 dollars. Thanks Amazon!  the only negative thing about this tanning lotion is it turned my hands orange. (this caught me off guard as i usually don&#x27;t have this issue ) so make sure you wash your hands well after you apply the lotion. some lotions do this and some don&#x27;t. do not use this lotion if you haven&#x27;t tanned in a while or haven&#x27;t established a tan or you will burn. this applies to almost all tanning lotions with a tingle. especially the extreme tingle lotions. i would recommend this lotion, but i cant .worked great, loved the great tingle, and definitely works. you will see the difference in your tan. i gave it one  star due to making my hands orange which lasted about 4 days)and it doesnt keep u orange its a nice brown tan. so make sure you wash after you apply. i thought i was fine with the product after that; but i wasnt. (i know you should wash after applying but usually i dont need to) after that incident i continued to use this product with caution of course but every time i turn around im orange in some way, no matter how evenly i apply this lotion!!!! now the corner of my ankle is orange. ahhh . it is a shame with what could be such a good product this is the result! i would honestly NOT recommend. it isnt worth the hassle or what the savings are on amazon.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t ordered this off Amazon YET, however, I will be very soon! This is my all time favorite tanning lotion. I absolutely love the intense tingle this lotion has. It is hard to find a hot tingle when your body gets used to it because of continuous use. I love this lotion:)</li>
    <li> I have used a lot of different tingle tanning lotions and this one is my favorite by far. I would rate the tingle factor and 8 out a 10. The lotion is really hot after you apply it on your skin, but then calms down a little bit. It leaves a golden bronze color when the redness wears off. My past favorite was Play Boy&#x27;s Oh La La La and Ed Hardy&#x27;s Body Shots, but I like this one a little bit better than the other two. I will purchase again!!!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best tingle lotion on the market. Great bronzers, deep color and fabulous fragrance. Nothing not to love!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used trinity a lot and the stuff I got wasn&#x27;t the right lotion it is in the bottle but isn&#x27;t the correct lotion the coloring is off and so is the smell very disappointed. I only bought offline because it is a little cheaper but I&#x27;m contacting amazon about this situation</li>
    <li> Absolutely Amazing! Best I ever used and I am an experienced tanner! Highly recommend!! there is No lotion better than this one</li>
    <li> love it, great color,  tingle is not bad, your skin gets used to it, believe me , i love this product.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion.&lt;br /&gt;I also have it doesn&#x27;t leave you red for too long after your session.&lt;br /&gt;burn like a sunburn as you tan and you look pretty red for a short time after tanning.</li>
    <li> Looove this stuff.But u have to be VERY careful.It will leave streaks.But it also does give u an actual tan.Just alot of added bronzer.So I gave it a whopping 4 :-)</li>
    <li> She likes to use one then the other and daddy has the credit card! Anything for daddy&#x27;s little girl, truly!</li>
    <li> The hottest tingle Ive tried by far!! Highly recommend this to a tanner that wants to break that plateau! The smell is generous and the bronzers give me a deep rich brown.</li>
    <li> I purchased this lotion and i have been using ed hardy body shots and i wanted to find something that was hotter or equal to it. when i got it i didnt have any tingle. and it smelled like baby powder. so i returned it where i go tanning ordered this and i tried some in a cup and it smelled just like the trinity 3 packet i bought and didnt smell like baby powder. when i used the trinity xs they put in the cup for me. I went in and i instantly felt my tingle. and i loveee tingle. so i am going to buy it from there. i do not recommend buying online from fusion. what i got was not the trinity xs. i generally order my lotions on here. and they have always been wonderful but when i ordered this one it just didnt work</li>
    <li> Great lotion... superrrrr hot! I use it indoor and outdoors! I do recommend an after tan hydrating lotion though as my skin feels a little dry.</li>
    <li> As an experienced tanner, this and Ed Hardy Body Shots are my most favorite intense sizzle lotions.</li>
    <li> Great product! Order came quick. Very happy.</li>
