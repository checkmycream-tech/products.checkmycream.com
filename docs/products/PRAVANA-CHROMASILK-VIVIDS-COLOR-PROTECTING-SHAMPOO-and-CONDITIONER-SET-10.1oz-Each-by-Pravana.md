      <li>Great product look forward in purchasing it again!</li>
      <li>This product is awesome.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>Both the shampoo and conditioner smell great.</li>
      <li>So great</li>
      <li>The conditioner is great too, it does not feel greasy</li>
      <li>Smells good and keeps the color in.</li>
      <li>Protects color like advertised, a good product.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery and great product!</li>
      <li>love the product leaves your hair real smooth</li>
      <li>Great quality, and has done a good job of preserving my hair color, which is bright blue.</li>
      <li>Great packaging and fast shipping!</li>
      <li>Kept my hair purple for over 3 weeks:)</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I wish the quantity was more</li>
      <li>I have access to a lot of color safe stuff.</li>
      <li>Smell is fabulous.</li>
      <li>It smells fabulous and my color has lasted longer.</li>
      <li>Fantastic shampoo and Conditioner.</li>
      <li>This truly helps my hair color last longer and stay bright.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping and love this shampoo and conditioner combo.</li>
      <li>I might actually be able to go 5 more extra days without coloring it again because the fadding in my hair color is minimal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>so I need to use more than normal.</li>
      <li>have used it 3 times now and have had minimal fade in my bright purple hair.</li>
      <li>Shampoo and conditioner felt luxurious, but I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference between this  product and drugstore sulfate free color protect formulas.</li>
      <li>Well worth the cost.</li>
      <li>I reccomend this product to everyone who enjoys fun colors</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s still vibrant!!</li>
      <li>Shampoo smells funny and doesn&#x27;t work into a lather.  </li>
      <li>This is the only one that truly seemed color safe.</li>
      <li>It takes a bit of work to get the shampoo to lather up, so my hair doesn&#x27;t always feel totally clean like it would with normal shampoos, but I can trade off having absolute squeaky clean to keep my vivid hair color</li>
      <li>It fades fast.</li>
      <li>The conditioner wasn&#x27;t very moisturizing and the shampoo still stripped some of the color off my hair.</li>
      <li>your hair smells really good!&amp;#34</li>
      <li>would highly reccomend this product to anyone who colors their hair ANY color, weather your color is Natural or a Fun color.  </li>
      <li>So I have always stayed away from color safe shampoo made for colored hair because it would weigh it down and only stay clean for a day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The shampoo and conditioner instantly absorb into your wet hair, so to get a good lather note that you will need a little more shampoo than you normally use.</li>
      <li>am definitely going to purchase more in the future.</li>
      <li>One thing I did notice is it takes a little more shampoo or product to use in your hair.  </li>
      <li>So i again used a little more than I normally do.</li>
      <li>I use pravana violet hair dye and this makes it last soooo much longer!</li>
      <li>Helps my vivid purple color stay in my hair longer.</li>
      <li>My experience with Pravana products, both color and after care, was a huge waste of money.</li>
      <li>Leaves my hair soft and doesnt fade color</li>
      <li>I am a professional.  </li>
      <li>This product really extends the life of my blue hair.</li>
      <li>hair is soft, bouncy, lightweight and shiney.</li>
      <li>But this set has helped keep my hair color last a week or so longer than normal.</li>
      <li>These products did nothing to protect my lavender hair, which faded completely away after only 10 days.  </li>
      <li>My color looks vivid for a long time.</li>
      <li>The hair color still fades but that&#x27;s expected from the vivid color line.</li>

    <li> Both the shampoo and conditioner smell great. The shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather well so I need to use more than normal. The conditioner does work well, as long as I leave it in for a few minutes, it does make my hair soft. As far as keeping colors brighter longer, I&#x27;m not sure yet. I colored the tip of my hair pink over my bleached hair. I was my hair twice a week and its been about three weeks and the pink is still there but is fading.</li>
    <li> I received the products within the time frame given. I don&#x27;t think I will purchasing these products again. The conditioner wasn&#x27;t very moisturizing and the shampoo still stripped some of the color off my hair.</li>
    <li> Helps retain my Pravana Violet color (I think!)</li>
    <li> It smells fabulous and my color has lasted longer. I wish the quantity was more I&#x27;m already running out. Need to reorder ASAP.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and great product! Kept my hair purple for over 3 weeks:) I reccomend this product to everyone who enjoys fun colors</li>
    <li> This product is awesome. I currently have purple pravana vivids hair color. I noticed a big difference in the amount of color that bleeds into your suds. I would say with this shampoo it was less than 1/2 of what I normally see with other salon brand shampoos. This truly helps my hair color last longer and stay bright.</li>
    <li> Great product! Leaves my hair soft and doesnt fade color</li>

    <li> Is you use pravana hair dye, this is a must!! Well worth the cost. I haven&#x27;t re dyed my hair in over a month and it&#x27;s still vibrant!!</li>
    <li> Smell is fabulous. This product really extends the life of my blue hair. So great</li>
    <li> I have the vivids red. It fades fast. All reds do. I am a professional.  I have access to a lot of color safe stuff. Tried them all. Rusk, matrix, Paul Mitchell,  etc. This is the only one that truly seemed color safe. My color looks vivid for a long time.</li>
    <li> love the product leaves your hair real smooth</li>
    <li> Fantastic shampoo and Conditioner. Even though I bleach my hair and color it blue or purple every other week my hair still gets greasy.

Not to mention the shampoo and conditioner smell sublime. Even my husband walked up to me and sniffed my head and said, &amp;#34;wow your hair smells really good!&amp;#34; I guess he kept walking past me and couldn&#x27;t figure out if I was wearing a new lotion or perfume and was shocked that it was the shampoo and conditioner I used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly reccomend this product to anyone who colors their hair ANY color, weather your color is Natural or a Fun color.

So i again used a little more than I normally do.

Great packaging and fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Only shampoo/conditioner my daughter will use on her blue hair.</li>
