      <li>I strongly suggest you purchase the right thread to sew the clips on or they eventually fall apart.  </li>
      <li>Maybe if you have straight hair, these would work okay</li>
      <li>They are great for extended wear because they are secure but not overly tight ( which can cause head aches).  </li>
      <li>very sturdy and fit comfortably in my hair.</li>
      <li>These clips are great quality, affordable and overall much better than anything I could find at the local beauty supply store.</li>
      <li>The clips themselves are easy to use for hair extensions and are very sturdy.</li>

      <li>The little clips feel secure and strong!</li>
      <li>I made my own set of clip ins, and 1 of the clips does not like to stay closed.</li>
      <li>/&gt;These were exactly as described,</li>
      <li>I will be ordering more in the future and telling others about them.  </li>
      <li>Other than that , the clips are nice</li>

      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>i have not used it om my hair but its very duarble</li>
      <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that my curved needle doesnt fit through the holes-</li>
      <li>These were perfect for my needs as I only wanted a few as spares for my wig but the local store didn’t have any in stock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I got them 3 weeks before the estimated delivery date and there were more in  the bag than expected.</li>
      <li>the delivery wasnt so fast ..</li>
      <li>it arrived fast and i have no complaints</li>
      <li>These were pretty much what I expected, and they arrived very quick.  </li>
      <li>WAY BETTER THAN I EXPECTED!</li>
      <li>They seem to be more like plastic than metal and snap pretty stiff, but they hold and were inexpensive.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>worked and snapped in place very well thus far, would buy again.</li>
      <li>actually they should be a little more!</li>
      <li>I grabbed these because I needed to replace a couple and they are sturdy, tight clip fit.</li>
      <li>I like them a lot since I am a natural and sweat a lot.  </li>
      <li>Came in 3 weeks early then suppose to.</li>
      <li>I have natural kinky hair</li>
      <li>but it arrived early, November 27.</li>
      <li>These clips arrived very quickly (probably a month earlier than amazons expected delivery!)!</li>
      <li>However, I think they&#x27;ve changed sellers and clips recently purchased have little grip.&lt;br /&gt;The grip on these are strong.</li>
      <li>they are really small &amp; so i couldn&#x27;t use them for sewing but they will come in handy for other things</li>
      <li>They only took 10 days to arrive, well over 2 weeks early (these were shipped from China).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Upon testing them out on my hair with other brands, these had a tighter grip and held up very well.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have recently discovered halfwigs. Never been a wig person but now I find myself almost addicted to them. I don&#x27;t like the comb that is attached to the wigs because it pulls the hair out but these hair clips work great. They are easy to sew in. They are very comfortable and easy to clip and un-clip.</li>
    <li> These are well made snap clips. They opened and closed easily and hold my wig on securely without slipping or snagging my fine hair.</li>
    <li> Arrived so quickly and so perfectly :)</li>
    <li> I was expecting this arrive on Dec 15 as it states but it arrived early, November 27. So that was a nice surprise. The little clips feel secure and strong! And they actually gave me 11 pieces, so that was nice as well. I haven&#x27;t sewn my wear into just yet but the pieces feel very secure</li>
    <li> The clips are bigger than I thought. After I attach a string of hair extension to it, and when clips it on my hair, the two holes snap my hair. I took some time to take it off. I hope that the size should be smaller and the two holes should be tight.</li>
    <li> I use these to make Clip In Extensions. They are great for extended wear because they are secure but not overly tight ( which can cause head aches).  Really loving these clips</li>
    <li> i did buy these items because i wanted to do some hair extensions clips in look alike , and for 10psc it find it a great deal/price. the product itself looks great, i didnt try them yet, but they look great. my only problem with these clips are that they are a little bit small but again they are okay and they price also. the delivery wasnt so fast ..i did take some time....</li>
    <li> Received in mail pretty quickly. made my own clip-ins next day. very sturdy and fit comfortably in my hair. will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I attached these to a wig cap I made and they were just too small to clip into my hair. I have natural kinky hair and they just didn&#x27;t work even with a small perimeter braid. Maybe if you have straight hair, these would work okay</li>
    <li> There awesome! Came in 3 weeks early then suppose to.</li>
    <li> These were perfect for my needs as I only wanted a few as spares for my wig but the local store didn’t have any in stock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These were exactly as described, good quality and arrived well packaged.  Reading the reviews I was expecting a long wait but I went ahead and ordered them as I didn’t need them in a hurry.  They only took 10 days to arrive, well over 2 weeks early (these were shipped from China).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with them, I would order from this seller again.</li>
    <li> This clips are absolutely excellent for securing my lace front wigs in place.  Also, they are price  reasonable  and  great for the number of clips that come in the packet.  I will order them again and have been telling my other diva friends where to buy them.</li>
    <li> They seem to be more like plastic than metal and snap pretty stiff, but they hold and were inexpensive. I&#x27;m happy with them.</li>
    <li> The work well &amp; clip tightly. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that my curved needle doesnt fit through the holes- BUT I expected that and worked around it.</li>
    <li> They are good to use with clip on extensions and u-part wigs too. They hold hair very good and don&amp;#34;t pinch.</li>
    <li> The price is reasonable, they have a good grasp, are reusable,  but paint falls off with head sweat. I guess it&#x27;s ok for the Price.</li>
    <li> Well constructed clips in a variety of sizes. I will be ordering more in the future and telling others about them.  Thanks</li>
    <li> I used these when I was making my u-part wig.  I like them a lot since I am a natural and sweat a lot.  It was easy for me to take the wig off and on. Great.</li>
    <li> These are a must have if you own extensions, plan on wearing them or want to DIY. I grabbed these because I needed to replace a couple and they are sturdy, tight clip fit.</li>
    <li> Buying more. Sewed these to hair pieces and love them.</li>
    <li> I needed clips for some extensions and I got these because of the price. Upon testing them out on my hair with other brands, these had a tighter grip and held up very well. And that&#x27;s what I wanted. I didn&#x27;t think they were going to be as effective as they were, but it was a nice surprise they are so great to work with. Just what I was looking for. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> The clip were too big.  I was looking for the small version of these clips.  Other than that , the clips are nice</li>
    <li> I have two sets of extensions and use them all sometimes.  I bought these clips so I could layer two wefts together.  I strongly suggest you purchase the right thread to sew the clips on or they eventually fall apart.  The clips are of good quality so no worries there.  Shipped on time and well packaged.</li>
    <li> worked well for the most part. I made my own set of clip ins, and 1 of the clips does not like to stay closed.</li>
    <li> worked and snapped in place very well thus far, would buy again.</li>
    <li> my friend who I got these for  love them they held up great in her hair.  she plans to order more</li>
    <li> Clips are great but the service wasn&#x27;t I ordered these on dec.27 and received them jan.28 with a stamp on the package saying it was mis sent to canada, I live in the US..that&#x27;s crazy</li>
    <li> These are the best clips ever. They take forever to arrive, but are worth the wait.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is thin at the crown and temple from genetics and medication. I wear a clip on closure that I can remove to wash, massage and treat my scalp. I had been using Sally&#x27;s clips. However, I think they&#x27;ve changed sellers and clips recently purchased have little grip.&lt;br /&gt;The grip on these are strong. I do not have to tease and plaster my hair with hairspray to make the clip grip. They grip and stay in place. I also find these to be comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;Since these are metal, I&#x27;m not sure if these will go through metal detectors. Does anyone know?  For this reason, I have ordered the steel ones. Since steel is an alloy, I&#x27;m hoping these will go through metal detectors.&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, these are great clips. I compared the size to the small clips I purchased from Sally&#x27;s. These are larger. So, I would say these are the medium size clips.</li>
    <li> These clips are great. I used them to make clip in extensions and they work perfectly. The only thing keeping me from giving them 5 stars is how long they took to get to my house. Other than that the clips are perfect !!</li>
    <li> I was happy with the product very nice and high quality, the only downside is that shipping was a little on the long side, overall great product!</li>
    <li> These were pretty much what I expected, and they arrived very quick.  I just found the holes are a little small when trying to get a hair sewing needle through them, if you&#x27;re making a wig.</li>
    <li> Was perfect and easy to swing</li>
    <li> Thisis my second time using these clips! Well made and worth the price actually they should be a little more!</li>
    <li> Took a million years to get here, then when it did, found that they are flimsy and not user friendly.</li>
    <li> I got them 3 weeks before the estimated delivery date and there were more in  the bag than expected. They are very strong and they stay in my hair all day even when brushing/combing.</li>
    <li> These clips are really small and if you don&#x27;t clip it in carefully you can break off your edges on you hairline.</li>
    <li> they are really small &amp; so i couldn&#x27;t use them for sewing but they will come in handy for other things</li>
    <li> These clips arrived very quickly (probably a month earlier than amazons expected delivery!)! The clips themselves are easy to use for hair extensions and are very sturdy. So sturdy in fact that they can be a bit difficult to open the first time. This is great if you want a nice hold! They also arrived in nice packaging and I even got a few extra clips. For the price, they cannot be beat! I would definitely recommend these.</li>
    <li> I received the order on time. The clips are larger than I expected. That&#x27;s all I can say. I have not used them yet, but I&#x27;ll repost something abt their quality if I remember to do so.</li>
    <li> WAY BETTER THAN I EXPECTED! Very happy with these clips, they were incredibly sturdy and held amazing.</li>
    <li> great quality. the price is nice too.</li>
    <li> These clips are great quality, affordable and overall much better than anything I could find at the local beauty supply store. Delivery time was accurate and the clips arrived in a cute pouch! If I need more clips I will be buying from this seller!</li>
    <li> Great. Some didn&#x27;t close quite as well after continued use but great buy overall.</li>
    <li> i just received these yesterday. i have not used it om my hair but its very duarble and i can tell i will have thee for a long while...it arrived fast and i have no complaints</li>
    <li> I purchased these to replace the clips in a set of &amp;#34;high end&amp;#34; extensions that came with terrible clips that slipped down my hair (my hair isn&#x27;t even silky!). But these clips do their job perfectly well. I can run my fingers through my hair when my extensions are in and everything stays put.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the product, shipment came early which is wonderful. I went to a few stores n my neighborhood to buy clips like these with no success but thankfully I found them here on Amazon at a great price when compared to othwer website will be ordering some more soon. ^-^</li>
    <li> It is what it is, good deal for amount of clips received.</li>
    <li> This product is indispensable for  who uses hair extension to  make adjustments!&lt;br /&gt;The price is excellent, high quality and very pratice and easy to use!!!!!</li>
    <li> These clips are inexpensive and sturdy, yet comfortable. I&#x27;ve been using them daily for 7 months and have not had issues with the paint peeling or the clips losing their grip.</li>
