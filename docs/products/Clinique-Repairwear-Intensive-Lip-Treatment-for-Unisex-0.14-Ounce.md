### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Very happy with this lip treatment.</li>
      <li>Wonderful product!!!!</li>
      <li>This isn&#x27;t an impressive product.  </li>
      <li>Apply at bedtime - wake up to beautiful lips.  </li>
      <li>I thought that for this price I would be getting a great lip balm.</li>
      <li>This product is superior to anything else out there.  </li>
      <li>in all, I love Clinique!</li>
      <li>It sounded good but didn&#x27;t work any better than Chapstick.  </li>
      <li>If you want nice, smooth, healthy lips, then buy one or two tubes of this great product.  </li>
      <li>This works better than anything else I have tried.</li>
      <li>love this product, been buying it for years.</li>
      <li>One of my all-time favorite cosmetics.</li>
      <li>but when I do it&#x27;s usually Clinique, (hypoallergenic), and this Lip Treatment is wonderful alone or on top of lip stain.  </li>
      <li>and so far so good.</li>
      <li>I bought and used this lip treatment many times and loved it all the same.</li>
      <li>My lips certainly feel and look better.</li>
      <li>Sometimes it&#x27;ll cost you a little more money to get the good stuff for the results you want.</li>
      <li>First, I am a huge fan of everything Clinique.</li>
      <li>This is my new favorite.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s goes on very easily and is not &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; like many other lip treatments.</li>
      <li>Anyway, I&#x27;ll know if its worth buying again once the product runs out.</li>
      <li>Yes, it&#x27;s a bit pricy, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>This item worked real well on my lips!</li>
      <li>and then when I put on my morning makeup and it keeps my lips from getting chapped and keeps them healthy looking all year long.</li>
      <li>that are normally dry - feel so much better.</li>
      <li>My lips stay very moist when I use this product, and the packaging is very fashionable.</li>
      <li>Also, apply a thin layer under lipstick and your lips will feel great all day.</li>
      <li>very versatile.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other lip products and nothing compares!</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for years and would highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I am in my sixties so I definitely need help keeping my lips from becoming dry.</li>
      <li>But the price is pretty high given the fact that it only would last me 1-2 months at a time.</li>
      <li>In a few days, lips are smooth and soft.  </li>
      <li>HOWEVER, I gave the Repairwear Lip Treatment only 3 stars for a very valid reason.</li>
      <li>My lips were so chapped, and I had tried many cheaper treatments with poor results.</li>
      <li>I live in a dry climate and am over 40.  </li>

<li> Lips dry, chapped?  </li>
<li> On a whim, I later  bought a small tube of Nivea, A Kiss of Smoothness for my purse and then behold - it worked and felt just like the Clinique lip treatment.</li>
<li> Lately I have been noticing that my lipstick will bleed into tiny verticle lines around my lips.  </li>
<li> And the Nivea is less than $3 a tube.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
<li> It&#x27;s especially helpful during those long Maine winters which can be extremely cold, dry and harsh on skin and lips.</li>
<li> I ran out for a few days and wondered why I had chapped lips</li>
<li> It helps a little bit, but not more than another lip treatment that costs half the price.</li>
<li> My lips are usually chapped.  </li>
<li> I had to keep scrubbing dead skin (sorry if TMI).</li>
<li> I was wrong.  </li>

    <li> If you want nice, smooth, healthy lips, then buy one or two tubes of this great product.  Apply at bedtime - wake up to beautiful lips.  Also, apply a thin layer under lipstick and your lips will feel great all day.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for almost a week and so far so good. My lips certainly feel and look better. I had excessive peeling the first 2 days, but that&#x27;s how chapped my lips are. I had to keep scrubbing dead skin (sorry if TMI). Anyway, I&#x27;ll know if its worth buying again once the product runs out. Sometimes it&#x27;ll cost you a little more money to get the good stuff for the results you want.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t wear a lot of makeup but when I do it&#x27;s usually Clinique, (hypoallergenic), and this Lip Treatment is wonderful alone or on top of lip stain.  It&#x27;s especially helpful during those long Maine winters which can be extremely cold, dry and harsh on skin and lips. I put it on before I go to bed and then when I put on my morning makeup and it keeps my lips from getting chapped and keeps them healthy looking all year long. I even have a second one which I carry in my pocketbook.  One of my all-time favorite cosmetics.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this lip treatment. Yes, it&#x27;s a bit pricy, but it&#x27;s worth it. My lips were so chapped, and I had tried many cheaper treatments with poor results. This one helps soften and repair! It&#x27;s a \\&quot;must have\\&quot; for the winter season.</li>
    <li> Lips dry, chapped?  Have you tried everything to heal them?  Try this Clinique Lip Treatment and feel the difference. In a few days, lips are smooth and soft.  Can be used under lipstick or without.  I ran out for a few days and wondered why I had chapped lips - I won&#x27;t run out again!</li>
    <li> It helps a little bit, but not more than another lip treatment that costs half the price. I thought that for this price I would be getting a great lip balm. I was wrong.  Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> This product is superior to anything else out there.  My lips stay very moist when I use this product, and the packaging is very fashionable.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product!!!!</li>
    <li> I am in my sixties so I definitely need help keeping my lips from becoming dry. This works better than anything else I have tried. It&#x27;s goes on very easily and is not &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; like many other lip treatments. I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and would highly recommend. It feels luxurious on your lips and prevents any lip issues. I&#x27;ve tried many other lip products and nothing compares!</li>
    <li> My lips are usually chapped.  I live in a dry climate and am over 40.  Lately I have been noticing that my lipstick will bleed into tiny verticle lines around my lips.  I tried this for two days and have already noticed a difference in how hydrated my lips are.  It wears like a lip gloss/lip balm and is not greasy, oily, or waxy.  This is my new favorite. Goodbye Bonnie Bell lip smacker, I&#x27;m all grown up now!</li>
    <li> Buenisimo, he probado un monton de protectores labiales y con este me quede, lo llevo siempre en mi bolsa. Deja los labios suaves y sin ningun sabor raro o fuerte.</li>
    <li> I adore this product.</li>
    <li> Product was recommended to me by a friend. It is soothing and non sticky.  I have purchased this product several times for myself and for my two daughters. It has now become an ongoing &#x27;can&#x27;t be without&#x27; extra gift at Xmas and Birthdays.</li>
    <li> love this product, been buying it for years. very versatile.</li>
    <li> its ok.....not greasy or cakey like all the others.</li>
    <li> First, I am a huge fan of everything Clinique. I have to admit, while their products are a bit pricey, you truly do get what you paid for. HOWEVER, I gave the Repairwear Lip Treatment only 3 stars for a very valid reason. I bought and used this lip treatment many times and loved it all the same. I usually used it only in the morning and at night and it really did make my lips - that are normally dry - feel so much better. But the price is pretty high given the fact that it only would last me 1-2 months at a time. On a whim, I later  bought a small tube of Nivea, A Kiss of Smoothness for my purse and then behold - it worked and felt just like the Clinique lip treatment. And the Nivea is less than $3 a tube.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I love Clinique! But the price is a little too much when there is other things on the market that work the same.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t an impressive product.  It sounded good but didn&#x27;t work any better than Chapstick.  Just thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  Wish I hadn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> This item worked real well on my lips!</li>
