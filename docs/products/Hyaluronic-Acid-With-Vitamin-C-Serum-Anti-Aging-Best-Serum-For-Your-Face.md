<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great buy, my skin feels fantastic after using it. I have been mostly using it on my neck as that&#x27;s where most of my wrinkles are and my skin instantly looks a feels better after using. Seriously people, look up ferulic acid, its no joke.</li>
    <li> I love skincare products, however they do not all love me. Over the past year I have been trying to find the best products that work for me, this Hyalurnonic Acid Serum works great for me. Ever since I started using this my skin appears to be smoother, and brighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to use this right before my foundation to give me a smooth cover, without using primers with bad products in them. I have not experienced and breakouts of any issues while using this serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband loves the product, I have noticed the most changes with his skin while using the serum. He used to have redness in his skin tone, and larger pores. Now the pores are smooth enough you can&#x27;t see them, and his skin tone is even and a nice bright color. I noticed dramatic changes in 1 month on him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was glad to receive a bottle of this from the company to test out and purchase at an extreme discount, or free. This is my honest opinion of the product.</li>
    <li> Your skin needs natural products that the skin has its affinity to. This Hyaluronic Acid Serum is one of the best in the market.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used a few products by this company and have nothing, but positive experience.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is very sensitive. This  serum is a beautiful addition to my daily routine.&lt;br /&gt;• AM &amp; PM Use&lt;br /&gt;• Great Alone or Under Makeup&lt;br /&gt;• Non-greasy&lt;br /&gt;• No Artificial Fillers or Additives of any kind!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, this serum contains Vitamin C to feed our skin and add antioxidant value to the skincare routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a week, my skin had an improved texture: silky to the touch. My overall complexion is brighter. And I just love looking at my face. What I see puts a smile on and makes feel joyful. Yes, such good products can make me feel happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was provided to me for review and testing by the company. However my personal results and opinions are totally mine.</li>
    <li> I received this complimentary for review purposes. I am in no way affiliated with this company and this review is 100% my opinion. I am always in search of new vitamin C serums because of my addiction to tanning. I get recurring dark spots on my face and on my body that I get very self conscious of. I’ve looked up and down for different natural remedies and treatments that would work for me. I started using this and I was amazed with the results. It’s super easy to use all I do is apply a drop to my face and I massage it in gently. I then use light moisturizer after. I know this says it is a face serum but I use it on my arms as well and it works just as good. It’s in the making of some big miracles. My dark spots aren’t gone yet but they will sure be on their way in a few more weeks or months because I can already see a difference. My skin color is starting to even out and it is leaving my face looking healthy and supple. I love this serum!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife along with the othrr serums and so far so good! 5 stars for being as described and working properly. Will buy more.</li>
    <li> another fantastic serum by Ultimate Smile. this has the same quality as the pure hyaluronic serum but with the inhansed benefits of Vitamin C. Snce using such a serum I have noticed improvements in my skin. No miracle worker as any serum out therebut a must have if you want your skin looking it&#x27;s best. Highly recommend and to top it off it is very affordable especially consitering the quality of the product and the fact that it is formulated without: parabens, sulfates, synthetic fragraces, synthetic dyes, petrochemicals, phalates or GMO&#x27;s which to me is so very important in any skin care I choose to use.</li>
    <li> After getting a lot of sun I applied this serum and it turned my dry skin super soft. It made my face feel smooth and refreshed. I have been only using it for a couple of weeks, so while I can&#x27;t see any big changes, my skin feels incredible. I&#x27;ve even put a few drops on my hands to help with smoothing.</li>
    <li> Approximately thirty days ago I received CSCS Advanced Face Serum Hyaluronic Serum with Vitamin C for free from the company in exchange for my unbiased feedback. The product claims to moisturize the skin and repair skin cells while also improving wrinkles, roughness, and overall skin appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main interest in testing this product was to see how effective it was at evening my skin tone and texture. Thankfully, wrinkles are not something I have to worry about yet so I cannot offer any feedback about that aspect of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the thirty day period I applied the product twice daily- once in the morning after cleansing my skin and once in the evening, again after cleansing my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum is smooth and light to the touch and a little goes a long way. A small bit (maybe the size of a pea for me) did the trick. As I said, because the formula is light it doesn’t clog the pores or feel thick or greasy once it dries. I also liked that it didn’t have a smell so people wouldn’t know I was wearing a facial product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took about two to three weeks before I noticed any significant results; those results being a slight evening of my skin tone where some discoloration faded and my skin had I had an overall more even appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say that I did notice that I had significantly more breakouts on my face when I used this product. However, I cannot solely say that use of this product is the cause of all of those breakouts though I am certain use of this product is linked in some way. And it should be noted that I have incredibly sensitive skin, so what irritates me and causes me to break out of course may not necessarily be the experience of someone else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think the product was effective in doing what it said it would do. I did see my skin tone become more even, and as I said before because I don’t have wrinkles I was unable to observe its effectiveness in that area.</li>
    <li> This item didn&#x27;t do anything for me. The smell wast very good either.</li>
    <li> I have bought similar Vitamin C serums and they all work for me very well. This one from CSCS is no different. It is basically the same serums for a fraction of the cost. This is the best value I have seen for Vitamin C Serums. Will buy more.</li>
    <li> Love this product! I have combination skin,i have been looking for while for a Serum to fit my skin complex.i was Never really happy with other products that were very pricey with no results.. I got this product for free for my unbiased honest truth and i love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once so far, so it&#x27;s too soon to tell if it&#x27;s a keeper, but I like the concept.   Thank you.  Respectfully, Marie Gray</li>
    <li> This serum is virtually scentless, and soaks into my skin so quickly leaving it soft and smooth. It is great to apply under makeup, or to use with other oils and moisturizes because it soaks in so fast. I love the ingredients and the packaging as well!</li>
    <li> I have combination skin,i have been looking  for while  for a Serum to fit my skin complex.i was  Never really happy with other products that were very pricey with no results  . This product leaves my skin look fresh and lively I use it on a daily basis.highly recommend .</li>
    <li> This product is not sticky, soaks into the skin quickly and is a great serum for the cost.  I think it will be a good alternative to many who are looking for Hyaluronic Acid but don&#x27;t want to spend the cost of many on the market today.  The price point is great, the scent is nice - not too strong and I love how it feels on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sent this product for review and consideration - I was not paid to provide my thoughts.</li>
    <li> I received the product on time. It was packaged well and very protected as the bottle is glass and not even a scratch was on it. It&#x27;s easy to use with a dropper cap. You just apply a dime size drop, a little goes a long way. Apply it on your face and it&#x27;s just that simple. I use it after a shower or in the morning after washing my face. I like that the face serum doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell. It&#x27;s soft and pleasant. The serum dries fast and it doesn&#x27;t leave your face feeling sticky. It absorbs right into your face like nothing is on. I feel my face feeling fresh and hydrated with the help of this serum. I see my wrinkles and my roughness becoming smoother with this vitamin C serum. I also like to use it under my make-up. I like that this product is made in the USA and is not made with any animal ingredients and is cruelty free plus no parabens and no gmos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received Hyaluronic Acid With Vitamin C Serum Anti-Aging Best Serum For Your Face for free in exchange for sharing my honest &amp; unbiased opinion of the product.

    <li> I have used this a little over a week now. I haven&#x27;t noticed any huge changes when it comes to wrinkles, but I like that it goes on smooth and absorbs quickly. It left my skin feeling soft without any sticky residue, and it didn&#x27;t cause any redness or irritation.I also like that this product is also formulated and produced in the United States, and that  It is 100% natural, vegan, and cruelty free. I did receive this product for free however all opinions are 100% my own.</li>
    <li> Left my skin feeling smoother and younger! I love this product line and will definitely be ordering more for friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Awesome!</li>
    <li> I love using this product morning and night...layered with some of the creams and serums that I use on a daily basis. It is great for all seasons, as it is lightweight. I use it under a morning SPF infused moisturizer and makeup. I love doing so, because it is a great agent for moisture retention and I don&#x27;t get dry patches on my face that sometimes get accentuated by foundation and the different powders that I use. I also use it layered under a treatment cream/serum before bedtime. It has been a great help in eradicating my fine lines and most importantly, it has helped me combat skin dryness!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for others. I refuse to review or endorse products that I have not or will not personally try. Needless to say, I may be a product reviewer but my thoughts are real and none of the things I say on my reviews are made up or fake - they are all based on my experience/s with whatever product I am reviewing. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.

    <li> This serum was thick and clear with not much of a scent.  It was easy to apply with just a few drops on your fingers smoothed over your face after washing.  It made my face smoother and helped with some of the acne spots.  It helped to even out my skin tone and diminish fine lines and wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.”</li>
    <li> I want to start by saying I received this product free or heavily discounted, for testing purposes. The findings and statements you are about to read are my own! I have tried several of these face serums, I used to be an indoor tanner, so my skin is begging for them. The truth is, they are great products and all seem to work in similar ways. But this one seems to give your skin more moisture. The texture of this particular serum is a little thicker than others. must be why it is a great source of moisture. No harsh smells. No peeling or burning. I do recommend this product, and it is a lot cheaper than the others...</li>
    <li> I absolutely  love this stuff. Not only does it have hyaluronic acid, but it contains vitamin  c. I&#x27;m very  huge on skincare  and I always love adding some sort of beneficial  serum into my regimen. With 2 weeks of use my skin because  more plump and hydrated, smooth in texture and overall  appearance  looks radiant  and youthful. I love the way my makeup  has been applying  to my face after using this. I have dry skin and after using this, I don&#x27;t feel that tightness  on my skin as I normally  do. My skin is also sensitive  and it didn&#x27;t bother  my skin in any way&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received  this item for free/heavily  discounted  for review purposes. All my opinions  are 100% honest and unbiased.</li>
    <li> This serum is really good to prevent wrinkles. The Hyaluronic Acid and the Vitamin C really works to combat wrinkles. I highly recommend you to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can be used day and night. It is lightweight good for oily skin. It comes with a dropper. I use only two drops for all my face. This serum repairs skin cells and hydrates the skin. It comes in 30ml - 1 FL oz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I received this product in exchange of my opinion&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;@MakeupByOne</li>
