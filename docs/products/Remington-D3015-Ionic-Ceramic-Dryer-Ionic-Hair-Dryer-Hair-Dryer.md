      <li>I loved the Remington iconic ceramic hair dryer.</li>
      <li>I also love the color, not as bright as it shows in the picture, more of a burnt orange.</li>

      <li>I absolutely love the settings on this thing.</li>

      <li>and I love the blast of cool air which, by the way, is much better for your hair.  </li>
      <li>worth the money to own</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s easy to turn on, easy to adjust speed and heat settings.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> great for the price. i needed a slightly more powerful dryer for my thick hair but no complaints.</li>
    <li> This is the best hairdryer I&#x27;ve ever had!  The switches work great and I love the blast of cool air which, by the way, is much better for your hair.  I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied!</li>
    <li> Light weight and works great, once you get it turned on. The on/off switch does not have enough traction, especially with damp hands.  I have to wedge my thumb nail at the end in order to turn it on.  Otherwise its a great little hair dryer.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat the $10 price! I was looking for a new hair dryer, and this was one of the 3 choices I had. The other one was also Remington ($30), and the third was from another brand for around $60. I&#x27;m not a fan of yellow color, so this was one thing keeping me from getting this hair dryer (when I was looking at it, it cost around $20). However, next day the price went to $10, and I didn&#x27;t have to think much as the specifications were exactly as what I was looking for. After trying the hair dryer, I can only say the best things - it works perfectly!</li>
    <li> A year or more ago I bought this Remington model in a Walmart to replace a Conair, more compact dryer and to get the new Ion Ceramic technology. It is an excellent dryer, light &amp; easy to handle (I&#x27;m 71, don&#x27;t need heavy) though full size &amp; easy to clean out the filter. Only complaint is the stiff control switch, but that is minor. My short/medium length thick but fine hair worn usually in a &#x27;bob&#x27; cut is slick but not dead straight, has very loose, often contrary wave in back &amp; on left front &amp; if not properly blown dry, refuses to fall in place. The right round brush &amp; dryer are needed &amp; Remington does a nice job. I left the dryer at a son&#x27;s mountain cabin we often visit, deciding to order (via Amazon Prime) a new Remington to use at home, upgrading a bit to the newest Pearl Ion Ceramic technology. Conair used to be the dryers I used &amp; traveled with for 20+ years of overseas living...I wore out 2 or 3, but they are great for dual power usage in other countries &amp; compact size + often a folding handle. I am very happy to have switched to Remington and hope they continue to produce quality, easy to handle dryers.</li>
    <li> I bought this one to replace my stolen one. It&#x27;s great. I love the color and it was a great price.</li>
    <li> fast transaction ! Good product !!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> It works fine and very easy to control but this size is a little big and would like it smaller. &amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Pretty good.  The buttons make it hard to not shut it off when you&#x27;re trying to manipulate the dryer to dry your hair.  Especially if you have long hair or use it to create a more labor intense style.</li>
    <li> good enough for price</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had a hair dryer for a very long time, and the one I had was pretty old. So I&#x27;m probably not hard to please, but boy am I pleased! This thing works so much better than I remember hair dryers being. Easy to handle, not too hot, perfect, versatile settings, and unique, eye-popping color. I don&#x27;t know how to use the cool shot; it&#x27;s kind of useless to me. I pressed the button while blowdrying, and nothing noticeable happened, but I don&#x27;t need it, so it doesn&#x27;t bother me. Also, the concentrator pops off accidentally a little too easily.</li>
    <li> My Wife loves this blow dryer, she sometimes makes excuses to do her hair just so she can use it!! The &amp;#34;Cold Shot&amp;#34; feature is pretty Awesome, but the ergonomics and power is unbeatable for the price!!</li>
    <li> Very good quality ! I love it!</li>
    <li> very great power, but buttons really hard to operate</li>
    <li> Great hair dryer! It&#x27;s the perfect size and drys your hair quickly!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this dryer for a few weeks, but so far so good. I have long thick hair and only need to use medium speed on medium heat to get everything dry in 10 minutes. The ongoing polar vortex combined with my own bleary negligence every morning is a pretty good litmus test for any product, but I&#x27;ve only gotten my hair stuck in it once and it&#x27;s not so hot I&#x27;ve damaged my hair. When all is said and done, I&#x27;m fairly impressed. With the dryer; not myself.</li>
    <li> works perfectly as described</li>
    <li> Much less &amp;#34;frizz&amp;#34; on my ends since I have been using this hair dryer.  I wish they made it in a travel size!</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer because of all the settings..  It is nice and light to use.  so glad i bought it.</li>
    <li> It does the job, just takes a little longer then normal to dry my hair. Its not too hot, which I&#x27;m kind of disappointed about, and it feels kind of cheap, but it works.</li>
    <li> Lightweight and gets the job done. Love the cool touch button as well. Just what I was looking for. :)</li>
    <li> Nothing spectacular, but it does the job.  The one problem I have with it is that the switch is so tight that I have to practically use some sort of tool just to turn it on.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s just ok.</li>
    <li> This dryer works great and has a lot of power. For $10.00?!? You can&#x27;t beat that!  It&#x27;s also a  bit smaller than most dryers so it&#x27;s easy to hold and maneuver.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is powerful, not so noisy, and it looks very nice.I like is very much.Hoping it can meet your requirement too.</li>
    <li> Great hair dryer! Shipping was very fast!</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loves it more than her $30 dryer with a fancy name that pooped just after the warranty expired, of course. This one seems built to last.  ~Pegleg~</li>
    <li> arrived quickly. Works great and has all the features I need. Amazing how cheap you can get a good hair dryer these days. Great seller and product.</li>
    <li> This has replaced my nine year old Remington ....which I got for the small size and three temp settings.  This one also has the three temperature settings and is just a tad bigger.  If this one last as long as the last, I&#x27;ll be thrilled with it as I was the old one.  The length of the barrel from exhaust to vent, is 7 1/2 inches...a lot shorter and easier to use than some of the biggies.  $5.00 less expensive at WalMart...I&#x27;m so disappointed in Amazon&#x27;s price increases.</li>
    <li> I got this dryer at Walmart for like $14? About a year ago if that. I use it daily because I have short hair &amp; wash &amp; dry my hair nearly every day. It is now starting to make a wired noise? Almost like something is loose in there? I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s about to go up at any time which is why I am on here looking for another dryer just in case.</li>
    <li> This is a nice hair dryer that does the job quick and well.  I didn&#x27;t know what a Ionic Ceramic hair dryer was when I bought it, but it really does dry my hair quicker than my last hair dryer.  And it really does leave it fuller and shinier.  I wouldn&#x27;t have believed it if I hadn&#x27;t experienced it myself, but I&#x27;ve been very pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As mentioned elsewhere, the switch/button design makes it a little difficult to adjust the settings as you&#x27;re drying.  But the chosen settings do stay in place once set, and the design of the sliding switches does make the handle easy and comfortable to grip.  So there is both good and bad points with this sliding switch design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the three heat and two speed settings give me more options than my last hair dryer did, which is very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;m happy with this purchase.  It&#x27;s a good hair dryer that gets the job done.</li>
    <li> The heat did not last for long, just cold air blows.  The dryer is stylish and the attachment does not fall off.  It is sad the heat stopped within a week.</li>
    <li> Small, sleek, efficient, easy to use, light-weight, super cheap and solid. Do we need anything else in a hair dryer?</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my wife.  It has worked flawlessly for months now.  Great product.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer actually works really well.  Great size, great price, great product, EXCEPT it sucks your hair in the back and it hurts.  My last dryer never did this, but this one does it all the time, several times while I&#x27;m drying it.  It&#x27;s so annoying and hurts.  I actually have to hold my hair back with my hand so it won&#x27;t get sucked into the vortex of pain.  I would never buy this dryer again.</li>
    <li> Hair dryer works well.  It was inexpensive but still offered three speeds and three heat settimgs.  Would recommend purchase of this product.</li>
    <li> Gets pretty hot, love the multiple settings and the cool air blast. I only wish the convenient hanger opening was a little bit wider.</li>
    <li> Reckon I have had this about a year now, at least 7 months. Works great, I use it 5 days a week, blows hot air, doesnt overheat, isnt to big, came quick, didnt cost much. Get you one, you will like it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this hair dryer for almost 2 months, and it&#x27;s my favorite one ever.  It&#x27;s a great size and color and is easy to use, and the price was fabulous.  I hope it&#x27;s still available when I need to replace it someday.</li>
    <li> Like it. Simple, with strong wind power that could dry my hair in a short time, and the price is terrific!</li>
    <li> We have boarding students living with us and needed a hair dryer for our guest bathroom. This works great for that!</li>
    <li> Bought for my daughter. Liked so much that when my blow dryer died, I bought one for myself. Like the option of the dryer speeds and heat levels.  Also like that it is easy to clean out the dust so that it doesn&#x27;t burn out like my last blow dryer.</li>
    <li> Its a good blow dryer for the price but it doesn&#x27;t get as warm as many others I&#x27;ve owned. It&#x27;s not too loud and seems well made.</li>
    <li> Not as much power as expected; cool-shot button is same temp as lowest heat setting. Thought it would be cooler like it was on my previous hair-dryer.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use, good quality for the price. Some wrote that the switches turn hard, well..it was not my case. Everything runs great! Recommend this seller and this product.</li>
    <li> Very good air flow and nice having separate control of heat and fan speed.  A little large and a little heavy compared to others I have had.</li>
    <li> worth the money to own</li>
    <li> has more uses than drying hair, especially after washing your pets.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer definitely can do the work. It&#x27;s enough for me who has short hair. I can dry my hair within 3 mins. Hope it lasts long.</li>
    <li> Cheap, but powerful enough to get the job done! It is smaller than a regular-sized hair dryer that most people use at home, but it is larger than those super-compact travel hair dryers. However, I will be using this on my travels instead of those compact ones because of its power and multiple settings.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t get too warm, though it does include a button to push to stop the heating element from heating for a while, which normally is a good feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had wanted a dryer to possibly do light duty as a heat gun too, but this model will get no where close to doing that.  Though, it does dry my hair eventually, just wish the output was better than slightly warm.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my sunny powder room!</li>
    <li> I bought it because of the low price and beautiful color, but tne item&#x27;s color is so different from the picture. The most feature that diappointed me is my hair always roll into the back of it and the dryer broke my hair a lot, I strongly recommended people do not buy this product. I just don&#x27;t want bother to return it, this is the only reason I keep it.</li>
    <li> I love how quiet this blow dryer is. It has a comfortable grip on it and does a beautiful job of drying my hair without any frizz.</li>
    <li> Grand budget buy plenty of power and heat and nice and compact too.</li>
    <li> I loved the Remington iconic ceramic hair dryer.</li>
    <li> Great especially for the price</li>
    <li> This blow dryer is great. I had a Remington I bought about 6 years ago and it finally died a couple weeks ago. I wanted a replacement that was low energy but just as good at drying. This thing is even better than the last Remington I had. Blows faster, dries quicker, uses less electricity, and is WAY lighter and smaller. Very impressed.</li>
    <li> Switches are difficult to slide.  Not bad and not great.</li>
    <li> I like it, meets my expectations.</li>
    <li> I trialed this hair dryer at a rental cabin and loved it, it&#x27;s powerful, yet lightweight.</li>
    <li> The box to the dryer was open it was missing the coupon that it was supposed to include. It might have been used. It was definitely opened...</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the settings on this thing. Very adjustable and not as noisy as expected. On top of that it has a very beautiful color, and it also has heat settings for those days that you don&#x27;t feel like damaging your hair. Very good!</li>
    <li> Had this dryer for about a year; still works well.  A bit bigger than I expected.</li>
    <li> Works perfect &amp; works wonders. :)</li>
    <li> This was a definite Christmas favorite...great color, works great, has the cool styling attachment which was a hit!!!  My daughter loves it!</li>
    <li> Received my order right away.  The dryer was a butterscotch orange instead of the gold pictured on the box.  Color doesn&#x27;t matter as much as how well it works.  This dryer works great.  Has different heat and blower settings.  For the price you can not beat this little hair dryer.  You could pay a lot more for a hair dryer but it is not going to dry your hair any better.  If it lasts as long as my last hair dryer (20+ yrs) I could not be happier.</li>
    <li> This is exactly the hair dryer I wanted - light and comfortable enough to grip and operate with one hand while steadying a wet dog in the other.  It produces the perfect temperature to dry doggy fur. And it&#x27;s got an easy-to-use heat-release button that&#x27;s very handy if you worry you might be crisping your dog and want a moment of cooler air. I&#x27;m sure it would be great for people, too. but I&#x27;ve never tried it so can&#x27;t comment on that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One bit of advice - the appliance comes with a safety feature on the cord.  Until certain steps are taken, the hair dryer won&#x27;t work.  Don&#x27;t try to figure it out on your own, just read the instructions that come in the box.  Once you&#x27;ve followed them, you&#x27;ll be able to turn on your appliance.  It isn&#x27;t necessary to do this EVERY time, just the first time, and I&#x27;m glad to have the extra safety feature.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair dryer on a whim because all the review complain about how the switches are difficult to move. I received it very quickly and was playing around with it. The switches are stiff, but easy to use. It drys hair very quickly and I love the three speeds with the three temps of heat plus the cold blast button, mostly because I dry my hair with cold air unless styling it. I also love the color, not as bright as it shows in the picture, more of a burnt orange. My only complaint is that my hair is too damn long that it will get caught in the back part where the fan sucks air (and hair) into, but not that big of a deal to dock a star.</li>
    <li> lasted for a few months and then crapped out would not be worth buying again only used it 4-5 times a month.</li>
    <li> serve its function well</li>
    <li> For the money, this hairdryer is hard to beat. I use it for other purposes than drying hair. It&#x27;s easy to turn on, easy to adjust speed and heat settings. The cord is just the right length, the color is nice, it&#x27;s just right. I can recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I needed a new dryer &amp; specifically wanted wanted one with more than just low &amp; high settings. This one has 3 heat settings &amp; two speeds for multiple combinations. Also very lightweight. My only complaint might be that the sliding switches aren&#x27;t as easy to adjust as some, especially if you have some sort of hair product or lotion on your hands. But having more \\&quot;traditional\\&quot; switches would make the handle less comfortable, so it&#x27;s a trade off. Overall I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
    <li> Works great especially for the price. I am very satisfied. Works well with my flat iron. Would reccomend to a friend</li>
    <li> The quality is really good. The price excellent and I love the color.</li>
    <li> Wonderful hair dryer.  I bought this one for my camper and after using it I put my more expensive one in the camper and brought this one in the house. It dries my long hair much faster and somehow leaves it less frizzy.  I was skeptical of the ionic feature but after using it I will not use anything else.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I love remington!!! great quality, perfect customer service IF you need them and this little dryer works just great :) THANK #Remingtone!!!</li>
    <li> Inexpensive and does exactly what you need it to...my hair is about shoulder length and it dries it within about five minutes which is great! It can be loud on the higher setting but most hair dryers are. I recommend it!</li>
    <li> I honestly purchase this hair dryer for the sole purchase to heat the plastic wrap that&#x27;s over my window. I would say its a medium heat. I wish it was hotter</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy so I don&#x27;t quite have the hair to contend with that some of the ladies may. It is the perfect size, not too big, not too small.  Comes with one of those optional tips for the end that I didn&#x27;t know it came with so that was a nice surprise. For the 1 minute a day I use it -- it&#x27;s absolutely perfect.</li>
    <li> The product works fine, it just has a broken ring on the end of the drier so if you wanted to use the defuser, you can&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Blow-dries in half the time of my old, dinosaur of a hair dryer!  I have used it for about a month now, with no problems at all!  Would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Its a great hairdryer, it blows hot air, at 3 speeds with a cold air setting. I can&#x27;t imagine what else a hair dryer needs to do? and at $10 amazing value ;)</li>
    <li> Is the perfect size for my teenage niece.  She loved the color, settings and temperatures.  Would be a good hairdryer for any non-professional.</li>
    <li> I use it to dry my hair 2x faster than with my old dryer, a lot of volume. love it!</li>
    <li> Perfect !&lt;br /&gt;Temperature adjustments, blow dry option are completely satisfactory.&lt;br /&gt;Color looked different in picture but,  in real it looks very good.</li>
    <li> Been using this for about three months now and i use it about twice a week. Has served me well so far. Not very heavy duty, so don&#x27;t keep it blowing for five minutes straight on your hair. Like the fact that it has cool and hot air adjustments.</li>
    <li> Great price, dries hair fast, great for winter days, lots of speed and heat options. Only the bilious orange color might be an issue.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair dryer as spare. You don&#x27;t know when the old one will stop working. I didn&#x27;t use it yet but I hope it will be good because I had good experience with Remington products.</li>
    <li> Great product for the price</li>
    <li> Use it to dry my dog.</li>
    <li> Bought for my wife. She says she loves it. No ten paragraph review needed here.</li>
    <li> good for the price. came back for the second one.</li>
    <li> Satisfied from the performance</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s very big and have three press. it seems more useful and safer</li>
