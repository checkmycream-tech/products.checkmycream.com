      <li>Loved it....</li>

      <li>I love this stuff!</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t experience any smudging or running, so that was nice.</li>
      <li>I liked this mascara a lot.</li>
      <li>Nice mascara.  </li>
      <li>i love this mascara is a good price for what it does.</li>
      <li>Bright packaging is easy to find in a bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:</li>
      <li>Over all I think this mascara is a excellent choice for people who have sensitive eyes like my ex who can not use waterproof mascara&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>Anyways, this did not clump on my lashes, which are clump-prone, and lengthened them soo much, they look so beautiful.  </li>
      <li>, this is a pretty great mascara.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It goes on very smoothly</li>
      <li>The model used in their photoshoot had gorgeous eyelashes, and I&#x27;m pleased to see that this mascara really delivers!!</li>
      <li>I still love this mascara, but I have discovered that you can&#x27;t sleep with it on.</li>
      <li>Perfect every day formula and definitely the lowest pricing here on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I should have known better, but being a seasonal allergy and sinusitis sufferer, I did not immediately attribute the irritation and itchiness to the mascara.</li>
      <li>Love that this has a curved brush and doesn&#x27;t clump.  </li>
      <li>Overall, a great buy!</li>
      <li>Do not hesitate to order it :)</li>
      <li>Sure can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
      <li>Would recommend this product :)</li>
      <li>Love this mascara.</li>
      <li>Also, it was the cheapest mascara in the makeup section, and I&#x27;m sure all of you know</li>
      <li>but it is a good mascara &amp; worth a try if you&#x27;ve had problems with clumping.</li>
      <li>Now I just  hope Cover Girl doesn&#x27;t retire it, as makeup companies do with so many products after a year or two on the market.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite mascara ever.</li>
      <li>Better than the CoverGirl in the orange tube.</li>
      <li>I am in LOVE with this mascara.</li>
      <li>but I LOVE how truly clump-free it is</li>
      <li>Still looking for that miracle mascara, and this sure was not it.</li>
      <li>i love it</li>
      <li>It seemed to make me look more awake and alert.</li>
      <li>This one is ok, but when this runs out</li>
      <li>but does add a bit more staying power.</li>
      <li>I have been allergic to mascara most of my life.</li>
      <li>and I needed to check the mirror a couple of times to make sure I didn&#x27;t have any flakes on my under-eyes or cheeks.</li>
      <li>I love this Cover Girl Mascara....</li>
      <li>I have worn mascara for about 40 years and have tried many products.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many kinds of mascara, and have been sticking with this one for awhile now.</li>
      <li>I have started using this more and more as my drugstore Mascara for me and people</li>
      <li>LOVE this mascara.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many, many mascaras and this one is one of my favorites.</li>
      <li>I gave it to my two daughters (twenty-somethings) and they also love it.</li>
      <li>This mascara is really good at NOT clumping right out of the bottle.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a fair one for the price, nothing spectacular, but decent</li>
      <li>I prefer my cat-eye mascara for night time, but this is great for normal day-wear.</li>
      <li>This mascara is actually a pretty good one.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like spending more than $10 or so on mascara, and am a fan of stuff you can easily get in drug stores, so</li>
      <li>I can apply more than one coat to my thinning eyelashes and it looks fabulous.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The first time I used it, I could tell I would need more than 1 layer if I wanted to add a bit of volume, but I tried one, two, then three layers... and no clumps at all!</li>
      <li>This mascara is easy for me to apply.  </li>
      <li>Stays on all day, but comes off easily.</li>
      <li>I want a no-clump mascara that doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes and is easy to remove.</li>
      <li>The brush is the key and it works beautifully.</li>
      <li>You can easily apply more coats to get a fuller look, or if you are like me, I like a quick dash &amp; go.</li>
      <li>Very happy with this mascara and would recommend this product to all women who are fed up with the clump of other products!</li>
      <li>Exactly as described, great price, thanks.</li>
      <li>At first I thought it was a wonderful product and bought several tubes.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Tube dries out before I use it all which causes it to flake on my eyes.</li>
    <li> Otherwise - it&#x27;s a good mascara for the price, I like the &#x27;add-on&#x27; feature, which brings the price down even lower.</li>
    <li> This mascara is just what I was looking for: it&#x27;s light-weight and natural looking with little to no clumps. Bought this based on good reviews and very happy I did!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many, many mascaras and this one is one of my favorites.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s a reason this one won the Allure &amp;#34;Best of..&amp;#34; award. It&#x27;s smooth, truly clump-free, and fast drying without getting spike-y. I got black and the colour is not too harsh or artificial. Great purchase.</li>
    <li> i accidentally ordered two tubes, but it turned out to be a good investment. I like this mascara--it does what it claims to and doesn&#x27;t clump. my only complaint is that it lacks much volume. but it does look good and I recommend it if you are annoyed by mascara that gives the appearance of only having four eyelashes.</li>
    <li> This mascara is a bit on the dry side ....that&#x27;s probably why it doesn&#x27;t clump..it&#x27;s easy to remove which is a real plus, it lasts all day without flaking.Sure can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> Still get some tiny clumps, but not as bad or noticeable as most other mascaras.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many brands of mascara, both expensive and cheap, over the years. I just adore this stuff! It doesn&#x27;t clump, flake, or smudge. It combs out perfectly and truly makes my lashes appear longer. I apply this after setting my makeup with [[ASIN:B004QLRW82 Skindinavia Makeup Finishing Spray, 2 Ounce]], so that I don&#x27;t lose the curl after crimping. After putting a coat of this on for length, I then apply several coats of [[ASIN:B0043P0G0C Covergirl Lashblast Fusion Water Resistant Mascara Very Black 885, 0.44-Ounce]]. These two work beautifully together, and I&#x27;ve even been asked if I was wearing fake lashes. I believe the tools you use can make all the difference, so immediately after I&#x27;ve applied my mascara, I&#x27;ll comb through my lashes with [[ASIN:B001OZZTII Tweezerman Folding Lash Comb]]. My lashes turn out perfectly every time. *Note: if you do use this type of *needle* comb for your lashes, you must be extremely careful not to poke your eye out.</li>
    <li> I usually buy CoverGirl mascara and gave this one a try.  The mascara seems dryer than others and does not have as much product in the tube. The curved brush is slightly awkward.</li>
    <li> I like a natural look, so this is good 4 me&lt;br /&gt;doesnt flake either or make raccoon eyes on my oily skin</li>
    <li> Ive tried just about every drug store mascara on the market, and this is one of my favorites. It adds great length and volume without clumping, I love the applicator on this one.</li>
    <li> I bought Cover Girl Clump Crusher mascara last week, after seeing a recommendation in \\&quot;Vogue\\&quot; magazine.  The model used in their photoshoot had gorgeous eyelashes, and I&#x27;m pleased to see that this mascara really delivers!! You&#x27;ll get your own runway-worthy eyes with the long, thickly emphasized lashes this product delivers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a number of other mascara products, and this one is my favorite by far.  I&#x27;ve also got sensitive eyes and skin, and need cosmetics that don&#x27;t cause an allergic reaction.  This is a gentle formula and I&#x27;ve experienced no flaking, so contact lens wearers don&#x27;t need to worry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t smear much even if you have to rub your eyes, and washes off easily at the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also enjoy Million Lashes by L&#x27;Oreal, but Clump Crusher beats it. The price was a little lower than L&#x27;oreal here as well. Try it and love it!</li>
    <li> As promised, absolutely no clumps.  Goes on easily and quickly.  Stays on all day with no flaking or smudging.  I&#x27;ve tried many kinds of mascara, and have been sticking with this one for awhile now.</li>
    <li> This works beautifully.  It doesn&#x27;t clump, and gives you long lashes.  I am on my third one and will continue to use this one.  It also last a very long time.</li>
    <li> WILL NOT USE THIS PROIDUCT AGAIN THE BRUSH HURTS  DURING APLLLICATION OF MASCARA AND HARD TO GET OFF  WON&#x27;T PURCHASE AGAIN</li>
    <li> The best mascara I have used to date!  Very happy with this mascara and would recommend this product to all women who are fed up with the clump of other products!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my 60s and never had great lashes until I bought Rapid Lash on Amazon. Now I have great lashes but the trouble I&#x27;ve had was finding the right mascara. I bought expensive ones and cheap ones and this one by far beats them all!!  No clumping!!!  Fantastic!!!</li>
    <li> A lot of other &amp;#34;clump-free&amp;#34; mascaras don&#x27;t seem to live up to their promise, but this one does. I do find it sometimes rubs off a bit prematurely but I LOVE how truly clump-free it is and it does a great job of lengthening too. Great value for the price.</li>
    <li> I use to use nothing but Esteelauder untill I Ifound this! finally a great none clumping at a great price!</li>
    <li> I dont need expensive mascara....I love this Cover Girl Mascara....I have tried all them in the 59 years I have been here....this one is the best for the money</li>
    <li> I have bounced from one mascara to another over the years in search of the holy grail: a mascara that lengthens, volumizes, and doesn&#x27;t clump up my lashes.  I have finally found it in Clump Crusher.  This product truly lives up to its name and remains clump-free as it lengthens and thickens.  Only one caveat: the waterproof formula actually isn&#x27;t waterproof.</li>
    <li> LOVE this mascara. No clumps!</li>
    <li> I have tried every mascara out there, expensive and drug store brands. I really do like this one. It&#x27;s very easy to use, and I definitely have noticed it&#x27;s not as clumpy as so many others are. I like the applicator, it does not glob on the mascara, it&#x27;s a great layering mascara. You can easily apply more coats to get a fuller look, or if you are like me, I like a quick dash &amp; go. It goes on very clean, it does not leave little specks of mascara around your eyes like some of the other brands do. Great cheap mascara!</li>
    <li> No clumps and last long without smearing. A lot of expensive brands I tried doesn&#x27;t even match up. Affordable and great result.</li>
    <li> Love this mascara. It lengthens my lashes and doesn&#x27;t clump them together. My favorite mascara that I&#x27;ve tried so far!</li>
    <li> Pros: this is the best mascara I&#x27;ve found for eliminating clumps.  It gives you a pretty natural look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: My eyes water from coughing or yawing, I blot my eyes and find my mascara is coming off.  I don&#x27;t know how  they dare to even call this \\&quot;water-resistant.\\&quot;  Doesn&#x27;t really add volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: I&#x27;m still looking for the right mascara - one that is inexpensive, doesn&#x27;t clump, and is actually waterproof.</li>
    <li> I am in LOVE with this mascara. I like crazy long and dark eyelashes, and I have fine eyelashes which can&#x27;t take a lot of weight so every bit of mascara needs to be utilized so clumping is a real problem for me. I have tried a lot of mascara and so many failed. This is perfect. I got this as a stocking stuffer from my husband, and I have used it ever since. Even as I apply the mascara, it is seperating the eyelashes and getting rid of grouped eyelashes, so it comes out every time. It makes my eyes look awesome.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for an exact dupe of Benefit&#x27;s &amp;#34;Yes, They&#x27;re Real&amp;#34; mascara -- this is it! Identical brush and indistinguishable formula from Benefit&#x27;s flagship mascara make this my favorite mascara hands down.</li>
    <li> I have been allergic to mascara most of my life. This is one of two that does not cause me irritation. I love the feel of it - not chalky and heavy like many.</li>
    <li> This is my go to mascara so I decided to give to my mother for birthday. She loved it and said that it was the least clumpy mascara she ever used. This product gets 2 thumbs up from both my mother and I.</li>
    <li> I have worn mascara for about 40 years and have tried many products.  This is one of the best.  It goes on thickly without clumps which is amazing.  I can apply more than one coat to my thinning eyelashes and it looks fabulous. I do not have problems with it flaking off during the day but then again I am very cautious not to rub my eyes.  I gave it to my two daughters (twenty-somethings) and they also love it.</li>
    <li> Loved it....no clumps and my lashes look like they&#x27;re fake...beautiful so happy i bought it</li>
    <li> This is the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used. With a great eyelash curler, your eyelashes will look like unrealistic (:</li>
    <li> This mascara is great for everyday use. It doesn&#x27;t go on too heavy and can be built up for a more dramatic look in the evening. I have had zero problems with clumping, so it does what it says its does! You&#x27;ll definitely want to pair this with your lash curler though, it didn&#x27;t do too well on its own. That&#x27;s why I give it 4 out of 5, if I don&#x27;t use my lash curler, they just stick out straight and look strange. I prefer my cat-eye mascara for night time, but this is great for normal day-wear.</li>
    <li> Not quite as fantastic as the discontinued CoverGirl Lash Perfection mascara which was my go-to, but closer to Lash Perfection than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  The brush is probably the best part of this product - makes application easy with few, if any, clumps.  No feathering and little smudging.</li>
    <li> It does what it says no clumps! But as for volume and bigness or thickness of lashes it doesn&#x27;t have that aspect , I recently strted using rimmel London flex mascara and love it so much more because it adds a ton of volume ! And I have naturally super curly lashes so it defines them well</li>
    <li> This is my favorite mascara ever. Super long lashes and no clumps! It also separates the lashes</li>
    <li> This mascara is easy for me to apply.  I am quite shaky, and I like that I can go over and over my eyelashes til they are all evenly covered and separated without the mascara getting too clumpy.  Then, the mascara holds up well.  I do prefer the water-resistant formula for staying power, but that&#x27;s personal preference.</li>
    <li> Best every day mascara ever. Stays on all day, but comes off easily. This mascara won&#x27;t clump. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 years and will continue to wear it. I&#x27;ve tried dozens of brands, but this is my go-to mascara.</li>
    <li> I bought this mascara after seeing rave reviews of it all around the Internet. I don&#x27;t like spending more than $10 or so on mascara, and am a fan of stuff you can easily get in drug stores, so I tried this out when I saw a display of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right away, you can see what you&#x27;re getting through the packaging. The wand is separate from the actual (sealed) bottle, so you can see its length and width and the fact that it is curved slightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it, I could tell I would need more than 1 layer if I wanted to add a bit of volume, but I tried one, two, then three layers... and no clumps at all! Even the eyelashes that were starting to stick together from my somewhat disorganized liquid eyeliner application separated easily with the included applicator. This mascara definitely made my lashes look longer without adding gross clumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, and the accessibility, AND the end result, this is a pretty great mascara.</li>
    <li> Nice mascara.  Goes on smoothly and truly doesn&#x27;t clump.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described, great price, thanks.</li>
    <li> Over the years I&#x27;ve tried a number of mascaras, and I never liked any of them because they all clump my eyelashes. For a while I didn&#x27;t like mascara at all, until I discovered this one. What caught my eye was the name of the product \\&quot;Clump Crusher\\&quot; , and it does exactly what is says, it does not clump my eyelashes. It makes them look very long, and neat. I also like that the applicator brush is slightly slanted making it easy to apply the mascara. There is nothing I dislike about this product. I plan to make this a staple product in my makeup kit. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have ordered a few different mascaras from Amazon. This one so far is one of the best, my other favorite is Maybelline Illegal Lengths mascara. It does eliminate clumps. I love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had a problem with mascara clumping. A trick I learned from a makeup artist is to very gently roll the wand in a tissue before applying; it works. This mascara is really good at NOT clumping right out of the bottle. However, it doesn&#x27;t seem to build &amp; lengthen my lashes as much as my L&#x27;Oreal Voluminous mascara. I needed to apply 2 coats to get my lashes thick looking (like the L&#x27;Oreal does in one coat) and after doing that, my lashes were mostly uncurled. I&#x27;ve always felt that the CoverGirl mascaras are too wet/thin. They tend to make my eyelashes \\&quot;uncurl\\&quot;/straighten out after curling &amp; applying the mascara. This new formula is better than others but still uncurls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The positive part is this mascara did not clump even with 2 coats. But, my nicely curled lashes were no longer very curled. It does wear well; minimal flaking &amp; no smudge after a long day. So I guess if you prefer minimal thickening/lengthening of your eyelashes, this would be a good product for you. I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll keep using it because I prefer a thicker looking lash but it is a good mascara &amp; worth a try if you&#x27;ve had problems with clumping.</li>
    <li> Been wearing mascara for 40 years. Have used everything from 5-buck Great Lash by Maybelline to top-shelf Prescriptives, Clinique, Estee Lauder, etc. Experience shows that for me, good &#x27;ol inexpensive Maybelline remains my reliable go-to brand for mascara. I do experiment with different formulas, (Define-A-Lash, Classic Volume Express, among others) but for years, have stuck with Maybelline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As good fortune would have it, I was blessed with long, thick, dark lashes ... been \\&quot;accused\\&quot; of wearing false eyelashes many times (have never worn them in my life), and never found the need to use an eyelash curler (ever). However, as time marches on, lashes, (among other things), begin to show the effects of age, and require quite a bit more \\&quot;help\\&quot; to bring out their previous beauty. Sadly now, 3-4 coats of mascara are required to achieve what 1-2 coats achieved a few decades ago! And with extra coats comes extra gunk and lots of clump!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hence, I decided to try Cover Girl&#x27;s Clump Crusher by Lashblast. (Washable formula; I have also never worn waterproof mascaras ... except on my wedding day ... too \\&quot;industrial\\&quot; for my taste! I sometimes think my abstention from waterproof mascaras and eyelash curlers is what kept my lashes so long and healthy for all these years.) At first I thought it might be just what I was hoping for, (although I quickly found the brush a tad unwieldy; it somehow applies the mascara in the oddest fashion ... I found myself holding the wand in a variety of positions and angles that I had never employed before), as I did find that despite several coats, there really was minimal clumping!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, within hours of using it, I found my eyes began to feel irritated and itchy. I also noticed fairly quickly that particles of the mascara were flaking off my eyelashes (it seems to be a very \\&quot;dry\\&quot; formula, which I suppose is what helps minimize clumping, but then allows for all this awful flaking). I should have known better, but being a seasonal allergy and sinusitis sufferer, I did not immediately attribute the irritation and itchiness to the mascara. And since I had never in 40 years of using mascara ever had a bad reaction to one, I didn&#x27;t really beleve I could be having an allergic reaction to the mascara itself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the mascara one or two more times, always with the same results (nowadays, I do not use mascara on a daily basis, but only when going out for an evening or special event). Then I had a weekend with two back-to-back functions, and ended up using it for two nights in a row, and by the second night, I was in agony. By the time I returned home, my eyelids were on fire with itching, burning, irritation and discomfort. I couldn&#x27;t even restrain myself from rubbing my eyes like crazy before I could take the stuff off. The next day, the skin around my eyes felt like it had suffered chemical burns. And shockingly, I had developed two raised, puffy, painful, red lumps beneath my eyes on the top of my cheekbones! (And I don&#x27;t even apply mascara to my bottom lashes any longer, as it just makes you look older past a certain age.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was no denying this: I was clearly severely allergic to the mascara. What a nightmare! Antihistamines, Benadryl topical cream, Aveeno baby oatmeal moisturizer (as my skin had become too irritated to use my regular moisturizer), and for several days having that red, puffy, \\&quot;you&#x27;ve been crying\\&quot; look on my face (literally: two days later my daughter asked me what had happened and why had I been crying), or worse, that \\&quot;you&#x27;ve been drinking\\&quot; look (and I don&#x27;t even drink!), and my eyes feeling like they had grains of sand in them (most likely tiny bits of mascara that had flaked off right into my eyeballs).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: Will avoid this ... and all other Cover Girl mascaras ... like the plague!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lesson learned: Will stick with my trusty Maybelline, and keep manually separating the clumps on my lashes!!</li>
    <li> Still looking for that miracle mascara, and this sure was not it. Puts out a lot but I can&#x27;t use it on my bottom lashes without getting it all over the place. A bit cumbersome. Would not recommend</li>
    <li> No clumps, so that&#x27;s good, not a lot of volume but it does define the lashes. It&#x27;s a fair one for the price, nothing spectacular, but decent</li>
    <li> Does what said on the packaging. No clumps. Would recommend this product :) Do not hesitate to order it :)</li>
    <li> very good it is works i love it</li>
    <li> It does not clump, makes lashes look very natural and it washes off with soap and water. The price and shipping were excellent . . .  the CVS price was double the amount with additional tax.</li>
    <li> This mascara offers great lash separation, as well as moderate lengthening and thickening. Because the brush uses rubber like bristles, it grabbed onto lashes and coated from root to tip, without clumps - as promised. Application was a bit annoying.  The handle of the wand is fat and clumsy, so it was hard to be really precise. And because the end of the brush is flat and has no bristles, reaching the tiny lashes at the corner of my eye was tricky at best.  Also, you&#x27;ll still need to use a lash curler, because the curved brush does nothing at all to curl them, as the commercials would have you believe.&lt;br /&gt;Once applied, it looked great.  It gave me fat, separated lashes without looking too flashy, dramatic, or super glam.  It was a relatively natural and casual look, so I decided to test it out for a day at the office. The first half of the day I got a lot of compliments on my eyes.  It seemed to make me look more awake and alert. However, by the end of the day, it had flaked quite a bit and I needed to check the mirror a couple of times to make sure I didn&#x27;t have any flakes on my under-eyes or cheeks. I didn&#x27;t experience any smudging or running, so that was nice. But the formula was so dry that it just seemed to crumble off by the end of the day. This was disappointing, as well as irritating to my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I found it to be pretty good. As far as drug store mascaras go, it gave me better than average volume and looked great. I don&#x27;t know that I would want to use it daily, and certainly not all day long.  The flakes were a turn off and the brush and tube just weren&#x27;t ideal for application. Unfortunately, despite the compliments, those were deal breakers for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve spent my entire life looking for a mascara like this! I have thick, medium-length lashes, so I need a bit of a boost in the length department without insane, clumpy thickening. Every mascara I&#x27;ve tried that claims to define lashes without clumping has ended in one thing: clumping. I wind up having to go through my lashes with a metal eyelash comb in order to avoid looking like a drag queen. I&#x27;ve tried so, so, SO many mascaras (I can&#x27;t even guess how many), from high-end lines to drugstore brands, with no real luck. But the second I put on this mascara, I realized it was time to dump every other tube in my collection. If they discontinue this line, I&#x27;ll be heartbroken, because I already know this is my mascara holy grail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 4/24/13: I still love this mascara, but I have discovered that you can&#x27;t sleep with it on. Whenever I do, I wake up with black smudges under my eyes. Yes, I know I shouldn&#x27;t sleep in mascara--I&#x27;m not reducing my rating based on this, but merely pointing it out since I used to sleep in [[ASIN:B001ESN2M0 CoverGirl Lash Exact Mascara: Black Brown #910]] all the time with no problem. That being said, it&#x27;s still my favorite mascara!!</li>
    <li> ok, there is limited clumpiness, but I still found myself pulling out my handy dandy lash separating tool, which is fine, i don&#x27;t mind the extra effort but I did not find any Wow factor with this mascara. Personally I think the LashBlast Volume (orange tube) is much more clump crushing, I NEVER have clumps or any lashes sticking together even after applying layer on top of layer, and it fans it out perfectly enough where I don&#x27;t even need my separating tool. This one is ok, but when this runs out im sticking with last blast volume.</li>
    <li> Pros: dry and won&#x27;t smudge. Bright packaging is easy to find in a bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: This mascara flakes so much that within a few hours, there&#x27;s hardly a trace of it on your lashes at all. It doesn&#x27;t go on very strong to begin with either, so if you&#x27;re looking for a dramatic mascara, keep looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I consider it a waste.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if this dried out or I have high expectations.  This mascara was awful.  My eyelashes did not look fuller or longer.  It looked like I put all my makeup on, and forgot to apply mascara.  I will not buy again.</li>
    <li> I really like this mascara! It&#x27;s not kidding about crushing clumps. I hate clumps and spidery lashes, if you want a nice natural look, this mascara is the way to go! Also, it barely flakes and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.</li>
    <li> Clump free, good color, doesn&#x27;t seem to create a raccoon effect, last for a long time, comes off with makeup remover. Would recommend to someone needing a mascara that&#x27;s clump free and defines each lash.</li>
    <li> I hate the brush. Very stiff and sharp. It goes on gloppy and clumpy and it takes me forever to separate my stick straight lashes. Despite being a long time user of Latisse,  I&#x27;ve been losing lashes left and right while using this. I won&#x27;t use this again. Vey disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have started using this more and more as my drugstore Mascara for me and people I do makeup on. I did notice some flakes but no more than other popular choices. I am still debating on if I will start using this over [[ASIN:B0043P0G0C Covergirl Lashblast Fusion Water Resistant Mascara Very Black 885, 0.44-Ounce]] which is currently my favorite drugstore mascara. I am big on waterproof the fusion lasts better and gives a bit more volume and is water resistant, which is not up to my holy grail mascara [[ASIN:B000FBF5BI Benefit Cosmetics BADgal Lash Mascara]] but does add a bit more staying power. clump crusher will stay well, but don&#x27;t get caught in the rain. Over all I think this mascara is a excellent choice for people who have sensitive eyes like my ex who can not use waterproof mascara&#x27;s. Definitely worth a serious look and consideration.</li>
    <li> I bet I&#x27;ve tried a dozen different mascaras, including Cover Girl&#x27;s regular Lash Blaster. My lashes aren&#x27;t as full as they used to be, and I wanted to add volume, but every other mascara, including the ones promising \\&quot;No clumps!\\&quot; left me with about ten clumps instead of a lot of lashes. I tried the kinds that came with tiny combs, but my lashes would separate and then immediately clump together like Rob Pattinson and Kristin Stewart. Yuck. I had almost no expectations Clump Crusher would be different but for some reason bought it anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was shocked to see this stuff really works! ZERO clumps! My lashes have noticeably more volume AND stay separate! They&#x27;re natural-looking, even with two coats (which I don&#x27;t really need). I was a little wary that the formula wasn&#x27;t waterproof, but it actually stayed on--no raccoon eyes by the end of the day. I love this stuff! It&#x27;s my new favorite mascara. Now I just  hope Cover Girl doesn&#x27;t retire it, as makeup companies do with so many products after a year or two on the market.</li>
    <li> No clumps for the first month or so, but it is clumping now, time for a new one.</li>
    <li> Decided to try it out due to the rave reviews on Reddit&#x27;s /MakeupAddiction. It does not deserve the hype. I didn&#x27;t like it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gave me very stiff, clumpy lashes. After a short period of wear it began to flake off and my lash-line became irritated and itchy. This is when I decided it had to go, and I took it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never had an allergic reaction to a mascara so I&#x27;m guessing it was due to this product and not an overall sensitivity. I have full lashes, maybe it would be better for somebody with thin lashes, I kinda doubt it though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a product named clump crusher, and then produced clumps, I mean come on. 1 star. I can&#x27;t think of a mascara I&#x27;ve liked less.</li>
    <li> Another find from Allure Magazine, I was tired of trying brand after brand of mascara only to find that it, too, was prone to clumping. The brush is the key and it works beautifully.</li>
    <li> At first I thought it was a wonderful product and bought several tubes.  Over time, I noticed my eyelashes thinning.  I switched back to a more expensive, high quality brand.  My eyelashes stopped thinning.  I went back to this product again and my eyelashes began thinning out again (falling out!)!!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t clump...like the name, but it also doesn&#x27;t give me the length I&#x27;m looking for.  I&#x27;m not sure why, but several times when using this item, I&#x27;ve ended up poking myself in the eye with it too.  I think it&#x27;s the shape of the wand.  It&#x27;s not awful...just not great.  I am using it in my &amp;#34;travel&amp;#34; makeup bag now.</li>
    <li> Love that this has a curved brush and doesn&#x27;t clump.  My favorite inexpensive mascara for daily use.  I use the regular (not waterproof) and even through working out, it stays on and doesn&#x27;t run.  (yes, I will wear mascara to work out if I go directly after work...) :-)  Great product.  Better than the CoverGirl in the orange tube.</li>
    <li> I liked this mascara a lot. It lets me build length without a bunch of clumps. The only bad thing is that it is tough to get off. I use facial cleanser at night, wash my face again in the shower in the morning, and still have a little residue from it under my eyes that I remove with a damp cotton swab.</li>
    <li> This is my current favorite Mascara and I try a lot of them. Great coverage, no clumps. Perfect every day formula and definitely the lowest pricing here on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This mascara is actually a pretty good one. It does not clump or dry out like most. It lasts for quite a long period of time too. I have long eye lashes already and always worry about lashes falling out. This mascara provides strength to my lashes and they do not fall out. Plus my lashes are thicker as well. I absolutely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying this is my favorite mascara I&#x27;ve tried so far! I thought I wouldn&#x27;t find anything I liked more than my Estee Lauder Double Wear mascara, but I was wrong! I&#x27;m always wary of trying a new mascara, but I liked the curve of the brush, and saw the good reviews, so I bought it. Needless to say, I am SO PLEASED! I&#x27;ve been using it everyday for a month now, and the results are just wonderful. There&#x27;s no clumping, unlike other mascaras that claim the same, and the volume you get is wonderful. I have thin, short lashes, so I usually apply 2 coats for everyday wear, and instantly, my lashes are fuller. Another reviewer said this didn&#x27;t do much for them in lengthening their lashes, but for me, my lashes are definitely longer. Application is simple despite the brush being a bit thicker than what I&#x27;m used to, and I love the curve of the brush. Overall, a great buy!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very impressed with Clump Crusher...it&#x27;s probably the best Cover Girl mascara I&#x27;ve ever tried. It definitely gives me great volume, without flaking or clumping at all. I like a more dramatic eye, and I need at least three coats of this mascara to do the job, but my eyes look great after three coats, and again, no clumps. Love it, especially for the price!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand the good reviews for this mascara, maybe I was sent an old product. A toothbrush did as much for my lashes as this mascara did, will never buy it again.</li>
    <li> i love this mascara is a good price for what it does. no clumps at all. i will buy it again in the future.</li>
    <li> I often feel like my life is a search for the perfect mascara. I want a no-clump mascara that doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes and is easy to remove. This one comes pretty darn close to perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on very smoothly and I haven&#x27;t had a clump yet. My eyes don&#x27;t seem to be allergic. And it comes off like a dream. My lashes look good, although not quite as thick as the clumpier kinds of mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is, I feel like I have to put on 2 or 3 coats for my lashes to look thick at all. And I have a terrible time getting my lower lashes to show up. It takes me longer to put on this mascara than other ones like L&#x27;Oreal Volumizer and Cover GIrl Professional Mascara, which seem to show up nice and thick right away. But those bother my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I would recommend this mascara. I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Clump crusher?  Not really.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try this mascara because I can always tell when a mascara brush looks clumpy, and this was not it! Also, it was the cheapest mascara in the makeup section, and I&#x27;m sure all of you know just how expensive makeup is getting. :( Anyways, this did not clump on my lashes, which are clump-prone, and lengthened them soo much, they look so beautiful.  I will definitely stick with this mascara, because of its quality and price. :)</li>
