<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Best trimmer so far i have used. Easy to clean and wash.</li>
    <li> does the job pretty well.</li>
    <li> does exactly what it says it does.</li>
    <li> Awesome product to use!</li>
    <li> Excellent littke trimmer. The battery lasts a very long time.</li>
    <li> Met expectations. I have been using it for 2-3 weeks now.</li>
    <li> not good for ear hair, not large enough to use as primary trimmer</li>
    <li> wish it had a stand with a charger.</li>
    <li> This inexpensive unit works as well or better than any other electric razor/groomer I have ever had (and I&#x27;ve been using them for 35 years).  My son found the unit initially, then when I tried his I fell in love and had to get my own.  This is one of those rare cases of a product that makes fairly modest promises, but overdelivers in terms of performance.</li>
    <li> ...excellent product for me. It&#x27;s works absolutely properly. I was surprised, when i&#x27;m begined use it. I thinked, thats it&#x27;s will be low quality for low price, but no.... Great multigroom for this price. I&#x27;m recommended for all...</li>
    <li> Although it did not come with a stand like the description and some of the photos suggest it is everything I needed from a personal grooming tool.</li>
    <li> Great trimer at that price</li>
    <li> This trimmer is awesome. I use it to trim my beard and my eyebrows and the adjustable guard is perfect for choosing the length you want and keeping it uniform. This is so much more convenient than trying to use scissors or using regular clippers and trying to keep things uniform.&lt;br /&gt;The unit came charged and I have been using it about every other day for a couple of weeks now and have not had to recharge it yet.&lt;br /&gt;The heads are very easy to change and the all the blades I have used work nicely.&lt;br /&gt;The construction seems solid and the motor seems fairly strong.&lt;br /&gt;This unit is supposed to be washable, but I have not attempted that yet. I simply brush it off after every use and dab a little oil on it occasionally.&lt;br /&gt;It did not come with any oil, but I use a small bit that came with another set of clippers I own to try and keep the blades fresh.&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint that I have is that it did not come with any sort of storage. No bag, no case, nothing. If they had included even a cheap zipper bag I would have definitely given this 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Very good and easy to use</li>
    <li> Gifted this for Christmas and the recipient seemed happy with it. So far no issues as of yet.</li>
    <li> the trimmer is good so far it works very well and it came it all the accessory not too much power but it works fine</li>
    <li> Works great for trimming beard</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace an older Phillips Norelco trimmer I had for 4+ years. The quality of the attachments is great and the unit feels much more solid than the trimmer its replacing. I expect this one to last quite a while.</li>
    <li> Good product! Cordless is the best. I hope the batteries will last for a while.</li>
    <li> Works great, charges quickly</li>
    <li> Good price and works well. Would recommend as it does the job. .</li>
    <li> Works great... Doesn&#x27;t hurt my boyfriends skin...</li>
    <li> Very powerful and with an amazing array of fine tuning. So much better than my previous one. A must buy.   Update: I wrote this review a month or so ago, but now I had to downgrade it from 5 to 4 stars. The product still good but I discover that the cleaning process is not as simple as the one I had it before. The little think upfront, that contains the razor get very clogged with your facial hair. Every time you trim your beard, you gotta dismantle it and clean it inside. And it&#x27;s pretty narrow! You gotta knocking it in any surface to get rid of the hair you can&#x27;t reach with your brush. I&#x27;m glad Philips include a little cleaning one for you to help.   Still recommend you to buy it, especially with this price, but I think the manufacturer gotta work on the design for the next one. Sort of difficult to clean this one.</li>
    <li> it comes with two size razors, and two adjustable guard trimmers for different lengths of shave. for those with ear/nose hairs that they&#x27;d like to trim, this product also comes with a trimmer for them. the trimmer is powerful and doesn&#x27;t pull at hairs, rather it cuts them. good purchase, pretty good price.</li>
    <li> Everything works but has drawn blood a few times when trimming neck hair in front .</li>
    <li> i bougt lasth month and so far so good, very nice shave for a electronic shaver, the battery so far good, hold well the charge and very nice tools for the price</li>
    <li> Maybe I don&#x27;t know how to trim my beard by using it,I can&#x27;t trim the beard shape I want.</li>
    <li> We just use it when doing haircuts to cut my neckline and around my ears.  It&#x27;s pretty light and nice you can use it while its plugged in.  You can forget to charge it before and still use it.</li>
    <li> It does exactly what I need. I only trim my facial hair with it. I wish there was some kind of functional holder that came with it, but for the price, it is worth it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very surprised to see any bad reviews for this trimmer. I ran across this a few days ago at Walmart for 14.88, what more can you ask for?  I got a nice trimmer that brought my beard very quickly to the almost stubble look I  like, it may be a tad longer than that \\&quot;Hollywood\\&quot; stubble look, but it&#x27;s the shortest I&#x27;ve gotten it using any trimmer.  In fact the day I&#x27;d bought it, that morning I had used my Wahl trimmer cutting my beard as low as it would let me.  That same afternoon I used the new Multigroom, straight out of the package with no charging. I put on the guard with the lowest setting and was amazed at the amount and length of hairs the new trimmer cut off. I had to stop and make sure I wasn&#x27;t scalping my face, I wasn&#x27;t going for the clean shaven look.  You also get a precision trimmer head and a nose and ear trimmer  Both of which work very well. I was especially impressed with the nose trimmer, it quickly dispatched those obnoxious little hairs.  My wife will be impressed!  You can rinse everything under hot water to clean it up.  I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to comment on battery life. I do like that if the battery is dead, you can use it as a corded trimmer. So eventually when the battery refuses to charge, you can continue to use your trimmer.    Cons:  Very hard to open clam shell packaging. Almost dangerous, come on Norelco, you are selling these to adults, not everything needs to be childproof.  No bag or storage for parts and charger.    I would have liked to seen a foil trimmer head included, they had one with the older model of their Multigroom trimmer, and it worked nicely.    I give this Norelco trimmer 5 stars. For less than 15 dollars you are getting a really nice little trimmer.  I don&#x27;t think you can go wrong.</li>
    <li> This product gets the job done. It is a great value and I would suggest it to anyone who is looking for a cheap trimmer for average to minimal use.</li>
    <li> Awesome.. I didn&#x27;t expect this quality for such a cheap price..!</li>
    <li> works very well on my stach</li>
    <li> It came on time and the product is according to was is described!</li>
    <li> My old Remington (6 years old) shaved a lot better. Also, this one vibrates very strongly, so it&#x27;s quite unpleasant to shave with it.</li>
    <li> Really good value and it shaves perfectly.</li>
    <li> Items was as described</li>
    <li> Terrible build quality.  Noisy cheap and ineffective.  Its obviously a stocking stuffer gift for someone you hate.</li>
    <li> Excellent product at a excellent price. So easy to use. I was nervous at first but once I started it is so easy and does a great job.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my 12 year old Norelco groomer, which was excellent but whose battery had finally died.  The current version looks better but is much less functional.  One of the tools broke (locked up, completely failed to move) after about two months but the warranty was only 30 days.  Changing tools is non-intuitive and tricky.  Every time you change a tool - no matter how well you clean it beforehand - loose hair clippings fall into the grease that is in each tool head.  Also, unlike the original, there is no convenient stand to hold the whole setup and tools, and I couldn&#x27;t find one online as a separate add-on, so they just sit in a pile on the countertop.  Only decent part is the battery which seems to hold a charge very well.  Not sure when Phillips acquired Norelco, but this smacks of a &amp;#34;cash in on the name&amp;#34; ploy.</li>
    <li> Best groomer I have used.&lt;br /&gt;The clips are very sturdy and as long as you are not pressing down like a madman they will stay in the desired position. I&#x27;ve tried other groomers in the past but they never seem to have enough cutting power. This has enough power and then some.</li>
    <li> Trimmer is good, but nose and ear trimmer is not working, it is not adjustable to the trimmer.Rest all is fine</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s previous multi groom died after about three years and I was looking for a cost-efficient replacement. He does not have any facial hair most of the time, but uses this to quickly trim sideburns and shave neck hair. The trimmer accessories have bizarre numbers on them that don&#x27;t correlate with regular clipper numbers and ultimately I knocked a star off because it doesn&#x27;t have any kind of storage bag or holder for all the accessories. For the price, I&#x27;m very happy though.</li>
    <li> :) I bought this for my husband and he is happy, different attachments for different parts of his body - keeps it all clean and manageable...</li>
    <li> Perfect gift for bearded son. Amazing price for high quality Name brand that does the job perfectly. 2 day delivery via Prime.</li>
    <li> Not much to say. The item is as described and I like it because it&#x27;s waterproof which makes it super easy to clean by just placing it under some running water.</li>
    <li> I had one of these that was  purchased at a big box store a couple of years ago, an  it&#x27;s been a great unit, and a worthwhile purchase. Finding it on Amazon saved me 50% over buying local.</li>
    <li> It feels really great in my hands. I bought it to groom my beard, and it works great for that. I am a bit skeptical on how well it would do for hair - since its smaller than most trimmers I&#x27;ve used - but for my purposes, it works great, and is very satisfying.</li>
    <li> I had the previous make and model of this shaver for over 6 years before it gave out on me.  Updated with this one.  As a guy who uses this more than once a week every week I would say the following are my biggest pros for this unit/model:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Click-In attachments for ease of use.  The model I had it was easy to break the guards off their tracks and/or break them.&lt;br /&gt;2) Holds a charge longer than the previous model.&lt;br /&gt;3) More control and precise settings.&lt;br /&gt;4) Portable and durable.&lt;br /&gt;5) Inexpensive</li>
    <li> Got this for my boyfriend and he really likes it! The adjustable settings are really nice.</li>
    <li> Great but wish it came with something to hold the attachments or a dock to charge it. Husband likes it though. works good. Great for the price!</li>
    <li> Mine sits in my trash can because for the second time it has come out of adjustment; I gaze down at the sink in horror, realizing that I just shaved my confidence off. Seriously, it regularly loses two places simply sitting in my cabinet and rocking back and fourth every time I close the door. I live alone and don&#x27;t use it for anything other body part, so it should stay on the same setting all the time. The new style of adjustable guard is poorly designed if you have more than a passing preference about your beard length. If you value your facial hair and don&#x27;t want to &amp;#34;accidentally&amp;#34; go clean shaven periodically spend a little extra money on something else.</li>
    <li> Good and cheap. Works great.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and maintain.  Does the job more than adequately.</li>
    <li> Great for personal grooming without excess pain and cuts.</li>
    <li> Good product, good price</li>
    <li> Great product no complaint everything is exactly as advertised and tat this price it makes a great gift! looks and feels much more expensive then what it is.</li>
    <li> Does decent job, but hard to use.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t work with the AC adapter when battery is low..</li>
    <li> it is not working without battry</li>
    <li> good buy for the price a lot of settings</li>
    <li> low price and fast shipping</li>
    <li> The tool itself is fine and well constructed.  The beard trimming plastic attachments are sub par though.  The poor design of the beard trimmer guard makes it easy to gouge your beard producing splotches.</li>
    <li> This products are the Best for easy to handling and the Cheapest one that I ever had one.</li>
    <li> Awesome trimmer at a great price. I have tested all the attachments and they are working great. It arrived on time in good packaging safe and sound.</li>
    <li> Battery lasts forever without a charge!</li>
    <li> this little clipper is great</li>
    <li> good product for the money...works great</li>
    <li> It works well for the price. I am happy I bought it. This is a handy tool for any male.</li>
    <li> O K , but the older model I replaced was better functionally</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had it very long, but works great so far. I had a more expensive for about a year and replaced it with this one, and its actually a better product.  It holds a charge for a long time when not in use, and over all feel is pretty solid. Worth the money!</li>
    <li> Works well. Only problem is that it comes with no carrying case.</li>
    <li> I used to use the trimmer attachment on my electric shaver, but after using this, I&#x27;ll never go back.  It does a great job at cleaning up the beard, and the attachments are handy.</li>
    <li> it was working fine for 3 weeks. And then it didn&#x27;t. I have returned the product</li>
    <li> works good, light weight, but there is no small carrying case included</li>
    <li> I bought this product just over a year ago and it&#x27;s starting to fall apart, but considering the ease of use and the price, it definitely deserves it&#x27;s 4 stars</li>
    <li> Awesome product..So many features in such a low price!&lt;br /&gt;Battery life is amazing...Would recommend this product for beard lovers!</li>
    <li> Pretty decent trimmer that I wish came with a way to store the different combs. Overall it&#x27;s not bad and does a good job trimming plus it had a lot of settings. Not bad for the price but no way to store this with the accessories you get which is a minus.</li>
    <li> Fantastic all around trimmer. I use it to buzz my hair and trim my beard. Works 100%, even 6 months later, I have no complaints! Best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever had!</li>
    <li> this is a very good quality trimmer! the inter-changable heads are really easy to use,</li>
    <li> a good product, it arrived on time. Very usefull</li>
    <li> Pro&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;- price&lt;br /&gt;- number of length settings&lt;br /&gt;- sharp razors&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;- Messes around too much by scattering whiskers all around (sink and around). Needs too much cleaning after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;- Difficult to clean the groomer. Beard gets stuck inside the razor head.</li>
    <li> Good at the price range the product is offered. It does spray your hair all over the place.  Cleaning is thus a task of its own. Not recommended for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Nice compact trimmer, good battery life, clips hair with ease!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s all I expected to be, and just what I needed to keep my beard trimmed nicely. The complaints I read of cheap plastic trim guards and how they don&#x27;t fit correctly is silly to me. If you read the enclosed instructions and remove/install the trim guards as directed there is no problem. I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase!</li>
    <li> You know why the bad review?  Try to get it out of it&#x27;s plastic case!  It&#x27;s all sound welded so you can&#x27;t steal parts of it.  Try to open it.  After you do the quick reference guide gets torn up.  Try using it.  Stupid, stupid packaging.  I&#x27;d like to met the &amp;#34;team&amp;#34; who designed it.  A baseball bat would come in handy.  Unless you leave it out all the time, find a drawer or plastic bag for storage.  Now to find if it works!  Badly, badly designed.&lt;br /&gt;PS:  I&#x27;m a design engineer for 36 years.</li>
    <li> This grooming kit is used for my dogs. It is the perfect hand size, but my son stole the other one I had. I had to purchase this as a replacement.</li>
    <li> Its awsome. The most important and coolest thing is the battery lasts for more than two months. I  just put into charge only once and i am using it for more than two months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the quality i was always expecting from them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drawback: Nose trimmer is not as great as i expected.</li>
    <li> Very good item. Works perfectly.</li>
    <li> not as tough and sturdy as I expected.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, 100% recommended!</li>
    <li> First time I used it I found it to be not as good as the reviews, I guess it was cause I always used my electric trimmer. But I do love it now, very practical and simple to use. I just would like it to have a little bag for the accessories so you don&#x27;t have them loose but for the price is still a great value and works good. Can&#x27;t go wrong for that price.</li>
    <li> I got this for my boyfriend and he loves it!</li>
    <li> Not quite as good on beard trimming as my old Panasonic but half the price. Does what it needs to do for a great price, recharges quickly and runs quite a while.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, works GREAT - good price, shipped on time ............................... 5 Stars</li>
    <li> All the attachments for anything you&#x27;d like to do, and charge lasts for a good while with decent power</li>
    <li> Broke my last unit after 3 years, it just works!</li>
    <li> This is a good trimmer but I can not use it when it&#x27;s plugged in and charging. Thats the reason I got one that was battery less is because I hate when I have to replace batteries. It has to be fully charged or it&#x27;ll keep dying out when using it. Won&#x27;t be buying any similar trimmers again from P.N</li>
    <li> Was very hard to open</li>
    <li> Works perfect for the price</li>
    <li> have not had this item very long, but what time i have used it, i loved it. very nice for the money.</li>
    <li> It cant get any better.&lt;br /&gt;Battery is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;Its been more than a month since i bought this. Couldnt get a single con so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> you do get what you pay for, watch out for the settings for how close the shave will be.  The settings are easy to change.  Decent razor though.</li>
    <li> The duration of the battery is very low. Expected a much longer battery life.</li>
    <li> Good price and good product. No complains.</li>
    <li> I got it a week before, so far so good..&amp; it is cheep compare to store.</li>
    <li> This is a great find for this price. Bought as Christmas present for my boyfriend and he loves using it, the only downsides are that the trimmer doesn&#x27;t go do low enough and there is no bag to keep the attachments in.</li>
    <li> Nice product works well.</li>
    <li> Works great boyfriend and grandpa approved</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband, who needed a new trimmer to keep up with all his manscaping needs! It does a great job as a face trimmer from nose, to eyebrows, to beard. I like that it takes him just minutes to trim up his beard when it starts to get scruffy. It obviously doesn&#x27;t get as close as a razor for shaving, but for everyday grooming, it&#x27;s great. We also like that it has an AC charger, rather than having to go through a bunch of batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing this trimmer needs is a stand or case to keep all the different heads and attachments stored neatly and to store the actual trimmer unit. It&#x27;s a bit inconvenient keeping all the parts scattered in a drawer or on the bathroom counter. All in all, though, having tried many different trimmers from different brands, this has been his favorite. Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> If you like to try different facial hair styles or don&#x27;t do it because it is difficult to maintain, this product is for you. At this cost, this would be a perfect gift for anyone. I haven&#x27;t used all the attachments, but am sure they would be perfect. I can&#x27;t yet comment on the quality of the product (have had it for just a day), but I would trust the quality norelco lines always produce</li>
    <li> Seems to work well. The nose hair trimmer works, as well as the beard trimmer. I haven&#x27;t tried the hair trimmer and those attachments but I assume they also work well. There is some white gunk that may be confusing on the inside of the trimmer heads, I think it is a lubricant.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> Perfect for the money. Cuts better and smoother than most equipment that cost 3 times the price. Only feeling is very cheap and one single drop could be the end of the whole equipment. Battery indicator would be around 10cent - why they didn&#x27;t add one?</li>
    <li> Worked for about 8 months before the motor gave out.</li>
    <li> Works great...one of the attachments is a little weird because it attaches backwards compared to the other attachments which was a little confusing.</li>
    <li> Attachments are useless, it only cuts the lowest length anyway. Old design was my standby for years but this redesign stinks.</li>
    <li> Best electric trimmer I&#x27;ve owned--perfect.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted!</li>
    <li> So many accessories no need for multiple types of razors, plus its rechargeable. My husband loves it!</li>
    <li> Love it.  My husband has never let his beard grow out.  He is finding it so easy to trim and manage with this trimmer.  He loves it.</li>
    <li> misses quite a few hairs, some attachments dont work...you get what you pay for</li>
    <li> Excellent value..Works great ...quality product...trusted name....</li>
    <li> Does not stay charged for even 5 mins -_-</li>
    <li> Shows extra pieces that you dont get. Battery life 30 min charger dont tell you its fully charged its all guess work oh and it takes ten hours to charge fully. Dont shave your head unless your fast.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Holds a charge for many days of use.  No problems at all, and quite inexpensive.</li>
    <li> WILL NOT POWER THROUGH THICK HAIR JOBS, VERY DISAPPOINTING!</li>
    <li> great motor, way stronger than hose little nosehair only ones they sell at discount stores.  This actually has a good adjustable length guard as well which was unexpected, a fine work buzzer, and a nose/ear insert.</li>
    <li> Bought 2 as gifts for my men family members. You can never go wrong with a Norelco! I liked the attachments, and the fact that it is sturdy.</li>
    <li> this has good power gets close trim head I could not be happier with how well it worked</li>
    <li> Not too quality, 10 hour charging very bad. Overall not good not bad.</li>
    <li> It is ok, it doesn&#x27;t seem to cut very well. I have to go over it a number of times and it still seems to leave some stragglers up. This is my first &amp;#34;beard trimmer&amp;#34;, before I used a Wahl hair trimmer, worked great but not on the mustache. Battery life seems great so far.</li>
    <li> Hey this is quite the surprise. I thought the purchase of a cheap trimmer for my goatee would be a dissapointment. I am very pleased so far. BUT it is still early yet. Ten dollars cheaper than my Remington and far better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure it would have been a great groomer, but it only lasted a week. It won&#x27;t even power on at this point.</li>
    <li> Works great, good price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good machine. I had no trouble to use it and met all my expectations for this device and also for the price.</li>
    <li> Mine arrived without any of the attachments.  My wife gave to me as a gift.  Overall disappointment with this product&#x27;s packaging.  If i had the attachments i would be able to accurately rate this product.</li>
    <li> The thing just works. Nose hair trimmer requires good angles. Overall its solid and great for my travel bag.</li>
    <li> I use this on my bikini area and it works GREAT! love the &amp;#34;precision trimmer head&amp;#34; No ingrown hairs, irritation, no fuss!</li>
    <li> Actually I ordered new trimmer but I got used trimmer and that to I didn&#x27;t get the precision trimmer. It&#x27;s better to buy products in eBay.</li>
    <li> Life saver, Perfect for what I need! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Very good and battery last long.</li>
    <li> Great shave without attachments but it is not easy to figure out attachments for an 18 year old.  Does give a beautiful shave, but the longer pieces are made of plastic and not easy to understand how they are supposed to be used. The shave ended up too short so won&#x27;t be able to try again for a week or so.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is the best value you can get. I just wish that Philips sold the heads separately since they have a tendency to snap if you take them on trips.</li>
    <li> A little hard to put the guard on, it otherwise great.  Nice weight so you can easily shape beard.</li>
    <li> BEST THING I&#x27;VE BBOUGHT</li>
    <li> My husband really likes this.</li>
    <li> Great product and its waterproof big plus. love it</li>
    <li> Works great at a great price.</li>
    <li> Great trimmer. No issues at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shaver for a little over a month to keep my beard trimmed and seems to hold a good charge - I have yet to recharge it even once!  It is very light weight compared to older corded trimmers, but the build quality, fit and finish seems to be quite good.  No complaints, does everything and more than I need it for and all at a very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Just love this one. For the price we pay this is a excellent package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this a lot with extra items works perfectly well. Cant comment on battery as havent used much to know how long it stays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I trimmed my scalp hair(with help from my wife) and it worked like a charm tough not meant to be a head trimmer</li>
    <li> I have a Philips Norelco G370 that I think is way better. It came with a bag/case to put everything in. The QG3330 doesn&#x27;t have any of that and using the attachments are rather tricky. It doesn&#x27;t do as nice of a job as what I had hoped for.</li>
    <li> hard to set for different lenth</li>
    <li> excellent product, good results thanks</li>
    <li> A shaver I would recommend to my father. Multifunction, easy to use, and low price. But, I prefer a li-ion batter instead of NiMH.</li>
    <li> For the price, its pretty nice. works great</li>
    <li> Works really nice. No complains so far. Really well built !</li>
    <li> Performs well and holds a charge. It would have been helpful if there had been a stand to hold all accessories.</li>
    <li> Great product ... charged it overnight and it lasted more than a month without charging...</li>
    <li> I ordered the product with high expectation, it didnt turn out to be what i saw in video&#x27;s. Its too difficult to bring my beards in shape by this product. I used the nose hair trimmer and it gave me bruises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;not happy at all</li>
    <li> Everything works ok. Not bad for the price. Only issue, the sizable trimmer brackets slip so try not to use too much pressure or you&#x27;ll mess up your dew.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best beard trimmers that I&#x27;ve had! There are two minor issues I have with this groomer. The Charging. It takes very long for only about 30 min of use. Now 30 min on a beard trimmer lasts while but it&#x27;s just a bit of an annoyance. The good thing is though you can use it while it is charging. The other minor annoyance is that this trimmer does not always cut evenly so you really have to take your time if you want a good even trim on your beard, especially if you have not used it in a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all for this price this beard trimmer is excellent!</li>
    <li> Works great, all the little attachments are nice.</li>
    <li> For the price, you cannot beat this Philips Norelco model. I is infinitely adjustable and keeps a charge for weeks and weeks.</li>
    <li> Very Nice groomer/trimmer for the price</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how awesome this is! It was so cheap I thought it would be lower quality. It blew away all my expectations. It has all the attachments, is easy to clean, and it is one of the smoothest trims I&#x27;ve ever experienced. I&#x27;ve been using it every other day for almost 2 weeks now and the battery level seems good still. 2 Thumbs way up!</li>
    <li> good quality happy with way it works</li>
    <li> the product is released and arrived in perfect condition. thank you very much.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband and loves it. Very good value. Feels more expensive than it costs.</li>
    <li> I liked these so much that I bought these even more and gifted on Christmas</li>
    <li> Arrived at specified.  Have used it twice, so far, so good.  Head usage can be confusing, but with time, that will become easier to understand</li>
    <li> it keeps me looking semi-human at reasonable cost</li>
    <li> Poor Battery Life!!!!!!! Everything else works great. Only lasted about 1 year with minimal use.....</li>
    <li> Perfect for trimming everything.  Description was accurate.</li>
    <li> Great personal trimmer. Ive used it three times weekly for over a month and havent had to charge it.</li>
    <li> Its good than any other trimmer, multinational and water resistance. Super.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using really expensive trimmers for years, including Phillips Norelco branded ones. They always work great out of the box then degrade pretty quickly (I&#x27;m a very hairy dude and shave my corse head weekly or biweekly; beard daily). Even with regular cleaning, my trimmers dull out and die after short periods of time. After my expensive Norelco trimmer kicked the bucket a couple months ago, I switched to this. I have to say, this works exactly as good as my Wahl and Norelco trimmers did a few months in. And if this one kicks the bucket, it&#x27;s not at a price point where I&#x27;ll belly-ache about it like my previous trimmers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re &#x27;no frills&#x27; with your trimmers, this one&#x27;s pretty good. The battery last a couple of shaves between charging. I don&#x27;t shave in the shower, so I can&#x27;t speak to the consistency of the trimmer in water conditions.</li>
    <li> Great product with more than enough attachments for my needs. I haven&#x27;t paid for a haircut in years since I first got a Norelco!</li>
    <li> this shaver is just ok if you like the 5 o&#x27;clock look then this does a fine job with that but anything closer you should look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Nothing like the previous Model G370 which we purchased twice before - the &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; version was much easier to use (smoother and easier to change heads and guards), was very versatile and held up well to lots of use.  This new version may go to Goodwill after two uses!</li>
    <li> Works good for the price</li>
    <li> Does the job as expected. What else can you want from it?</li>
    <li> Great for its price only problem I had was opening it.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t cut my hair on my face low enough.</li>
    <li> Product arrived in opened retail box. Product wasn&#x27;t clean.</li>
    <li> seems to be made up of solid design, does pull on the nose hair a little, but a good value for the money.</li>
    <li> Works well, multi-purpose, which is nice.  Ample length settings for both hair and beard/mustache.</li>
    <li> So far so good.  Just be careful before you put it on your face. If the guard has mistakenly been pushed all the way down, you may lose a part of your beard or mustache before you realize what happened</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work for a stubble look. The angle of the guards against the trimmer is really awkward and difficult at the shortest lengths. I end up with a patchy, uneven look.</li>
    <li> Worth the price, and good for first time users, before proceeding to higher and sophisticated models. Has all the parts, only concern I have is it I am not able to get a very close shave.</li>
    <li> It arrived on time and in good condition, it was exactly what I was looking for and have had no problems with it at all.</li>
    <li> This was as expeded....</li>
    <li> Nice trimmer for the money</li>
    <li> Nice trimmer with useful attachments - great deal for the money.</li>
    <li> nice and it does its job very good!</li>
    <li> I use it for my beard, my nose, and my nether regions. Precise and smooth cutting, a year after I bought it.</li>
    <li> very good machine. my husband liked it.</li>
    <li> Perfect for what I needed</li>
    <li> Good product. Worth of each penny.</li>
    <li> I HATE this product.  I used the G370 for years and, in fact, bought the same thing several times when an attachment broke.  This time I was forced to buy the 3100.  First of all, the power button is on the wrong side .  The old one was so easy to turn on with my thumb.  This one I have to flip over and it&#x27;s super annoying.  The attachments don&#x27;t snap on easily.  It doesn&#x27;t feel good in my hand.  The worst thing was that the number three setting was much shorter than the old one and I nearly turned my son into a skinhead.  I do not understand why they have to redesign a perfectly good product into a piece of crap.  I will not buy this one again.  Whatdyaknow, Phillips website complaint page doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I ordered 5 pieces in a month. The trimmer is too good. Its very  good for the price. we can use it anywhere(120V-220V) I love it a lot..</li>
    <li> for the price its good .but next time around I m going to spend a little more you get what you pay for</li>
    <li> The head on this is really small but it performs exceptionally well. And it can keep its charge for quite some time.</li>
    <li> Bang for your buck trimmer gift right here</li>
    <li> I had the older version for about 8 years until one day lost it after the wife washed the dog &#x3D;( Got this new version for xmas. Runs great and has a better battery charge; However, the old one came with a mount that held everything in it including the charger. It would charge while it was stored away. This kit does not come with a mount, in fact all of the stuff is just laying around. All soon to be lost again. No complaints of operation though.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s alright for those who want to have a low cut but it&#x27;s not good for trimming clean. For low cuts i&#x27;ll give it a 5 on 5 but for clean cuts i&#x27;ll give it a 3 on 5</li>
    <li> I have a beard, full face. This has quickly become my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; trimmer and clean up tool.  Battery has a long life, but needs to be charged when low.&lt;br /&gt;The attachments are useful, especially the nose hair trimmer. Should come with a box that you can store all the parts in so they don&#x27;t get lost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works great!!</li>
    <li> works well holds charge looks sharp talks dirty runs quiet fits the hand nicely whistles music gives hugs rubs face</li>
    <li> This is the third one of these units I have purchased over the years.  This design is a little different than the past 2 I have had and I haven&#x27;t used this one yet as it was purchased as a replacement when my current one no longer works.  These units are excellent for beard trimming (that is what I use them for) and the best that I have found over the years.  Since using this model I don&#x27;t even try to look for others when it needs replacing.  They will usually last me around 7 or 8 years before needing to be replaced.</li>
    <li> Love my trimmer. Battery lasts forever. My beard never looked better</li>
    <li> great grooming tool.  second one of Norelco&#x27;s I have owned, use it a lot</li>
    <li> Any look with one tool...</li>
    <li> Wish it had a bag to keep all the parts together, but otherwise it worked well.</li>
    <li> Good product at a good price</li>
    <li> It does the job as far as casual trimming goes. I&#x27;m a little disappointed with the nose trimmer not using actual blades because it does a mediocre job getting all the nose hairs. Overall though, considering the price, I&#x27;d say this is the best facial trimmer available.</li>
    <li> Pay attention to parts included. Does not include 2 important pieces- beard &amp; stubble comb or detail comb!! Pieces definitely needed.</li>
    <li> so far so good. The larger range of guard lengths in comparison to other options is a huge plus imo.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Works very well. A steal for the price!</li>
    <li> I use it on my balls and it works on my balls. Nobody is saying anything about that in these reviews but I&#x27;ll be the one, it works on your balls</li>
    <li> Cheap and best..liked it</li>
    <li> Nice trimmer for the price you can not go wrong. Holds a charge for a very long time. No bag to put the accessories in is the only downfall.</li>
    <li> The razor itself seems to work fine, but the length guide attachments are useless. At $15 it still deserves a solid 4 stars, but if you actually plan on trimming beards and using the length guides you should look somewhere else.</li>
    <li> Arrived in a package whish was almost open</li>
    <li> Great value for this product and it produces good grooming.  I use it to trim my hair every 3-4 days.</li>
    <li> what good is a unit that you can not recharge because the plug is for some country that has a two pin socket as in England we have a three pin so that is why it went back and also it cost me 12£  to send it back but was only reimbursed with just over 5£ not to bad for sum well that is why it cost me over 7£ and I got nothing for my money NOT AGAIN WILL I DEAL WITH THEM</li>
    <li> Love that it functions while charging!</li>
    <li> Got this for my husband for christmas. So far so good. He likes to grow a beard in the winter and its so thick that it needs constant grooming. We burned through a smaller one quickly and he started using my professional hair trimmers, and now the blades are getting dull. Which I can&#x27;t have. We&#x27;ll see how this one last. Hoping for a good little while.</li>
    <li> Cannot be beat for the money. The beard trimmer is a bit slow but this is a great deal despite that.</li>
    <li> Very good value for the price. Groomer feels sturdy and comes with a lot of accessories. So far have used it to:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Buzz my son&#x27;s hair&lt;br /&gt;2. Remove nose and ear hair&lt;br /&gt;3. Trim my sideburns&lt;br /&gt;4. Trim my eyebrows&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love that it is water proof so I can just wash it off when done.</li>
    <li> My son loved this gift.</li>
    <li> it doesn&#x27;t cut hair at all</li>
    <li> For the price on this guy, its pretty good stuff. Here&#x27;s a breakdown of my experience, spaghetti western style:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE GOOD:&lt;br /&gt;-The ear and nose trimmer works very well, which was my main concern in getting this in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;-The trimmer length attachments also work well, as long as you start longer than you think you&#x27;ll need. I cleaned up my sideburns and armpits quite effectively with the trimmer and its length attachment. My previous method of doing so was to use a tiny scissors and it took so much longer!&lt;br /&gt;-The cord you charge it with also powers the unit. The thing with these cheaper groomers (same goes for cheaper electric razors) is the batteries aren&#x27;t that high quality and will eventually stop holding a charge. Depending on how they&#x27;re made, the cord you plug it in with works as either an AC power adapter or only a battery charger. If its only a battery charger, you now have a useless trimmer. If its like an AC adapter, you can continue to use the trimmer even after the b... Read more</li>
    <li> This thing is great. I think this is the 4th trimmer I&#x27;ve owned in my life. This is the first that I&#x27;ve been able to make a good horizontal cut with. Usually I make a cut, have to pick up the trimmer to get the hair off, place it again, repeat. Not this one! It glides along.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nose hair trimmer is a major bonus. Works very well. Very safe.</li>
    <li> I always used to shave with a razor blade. Decided to go with a beard for a while and got this to trim it. I don&#x27;t do any special design or cuts. I&#x27;m trimming my beard every few days to make it look clean. It&#x27;s a quick shave, battery life is great and the additional items look like they&#x27;d come handy one day thought to be honest I haven&#x27;t used any of them.&lt;br /&gt;it would probably be great for extra use but I can&#x27;t comment on that. For trimming it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> It was an OK purchase. I just don&#x27;t like the fact that there are many parts to keep track of. At least it was cheap and does the job.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my boyfriend. I was looking for a product for a mustache but it leaves stubbles. It&#x27;s not for a clean looking mustache look. The other attachable parts worked fine.</li>
    <li> Nice product. Unfortunately I broke the ear and nose head, while trying to change it.</li>
    <li> I love this trimmer had my last one about 10 years.</li>
    <li> Got this for Father&#x27;s Day for my dad and husband and they both loved it!! It works really good!!</li>
    <li> grat trimmer like feet for trimming lots of levels beard never looked so good</li>
    <li> Work&#x27;s well I&#x27;ve charged it once and have used it several times. Great price as well.</li>
    <li> This was a gift to my husband. and he loves it. I only wish it cut closer.</li>
    <li> It works great for manscaping. Battery last long time&lt;br /&gt;Only had it for a month or so, i&#x27;ll have to see how long&lt;br /&gt;it goes at a like new rate.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. For the price, I shouldn&#x27;t really complain, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy again. It feels cheap (again, you get what you pay for) but the worst part is the guides. Very cheap and I don&#x27;t feel comfortable using them. I purchased this mainly for cutting hair. I don&#x27;t use it for the bulk of the cut, but mostly for the trimming around the ears and cleaning up. If that is the reason for your purchase, I would choose a different product. If you&#x27;re mainly using for beard and mustache trimming, it would likely be ok.</li>
    <li> Nice pocket shaver, throw it in a bag and take it where you need it, My skin is sensitive, so I love this as it prevent razor bumps, Haven&#x27;t had any issued with it so far.</li>
    <li> Okay, it&#x27;s not for people who want a tight crew cut or just stubble. And otherwise you can ignore those beginners and &amp;#34;just got it&amp;#34; critics who found something they didn&#x27;t understand, as well as the people who obviously don&#x27;t know how to trim their own hair. This is a great little beard and sideburn trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been trimming my beard for 20 years now, and I&#x27;ve been using this little beauty for two and a half months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today is the first day I had to charge it. It held the charge that long. Why would someone say it needs a stand? Just drop it in the drawer or in your big trimmer case. It doesn&#x27;t need to charge for months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have all the miscellaneous crap that some manufacturers add to the package to drive the price up to $100 or more. It&#x27;s a simple kit that does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works just fine. Just do like the professional barbers and don&#x27;t push the clipper too fast. Amateurs try to rush the cut and it pulls their hair, or cut really close with a $20 machine. Duh! Give the machine a chance to do what it&#x27;s intended to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and the &amp;#34;white gunk&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;glue&amp;#34; inside, that&#x27;s standard lithium grease that keeps things INSIDE moving the way they&#x27;re supposed to. What are you doing inside the machine anyway?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s basic, but doesn&#x27;t seem cheap, and it&#x27;s not to be compared with stainless steel professional gear. It&#x27;s just a good, reliable device that you throw away in a year or two and get a new one with freshly sharp blades ... for $20. It&#x27;s a can&#x27;t miss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The experience man says, I love it.</li>
    <li> Product as advertised....  Had a similar product many years ago...  It worked very well and this one has several improvements...  Battery much better for one....</li>
    <li> The item arrived fast and as advertised.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t want to be forced to write a review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As advertised</li>
    <li> I was hesitant at the beginning, but it is actually very easy to use and the result is quite good even for a first time user.&lt;br /&gt;Did not try the hair trimmer, I will stick to my barber shop for that!</li>
    <li> Could not get the beard attachments to fit.</li>
    <li> Love it!&lt;br /&gt;The best clipper I&#x27;ve ever bought in a long time. Great price for such high performance piece of sofiaticated eiquipment!</li>
    <li> This trimmer is great for touch ups of the beard, mustache and sideburns. It has an ear and nose hair trimmer as well. the only downside is it doesn&#x27;t have a little caddy to keep all the different heads in. Other than that it works great!</li>
    <li> very good, everything on time. I recommend</li>
    <li> Great for the price, though others may have different needs than mine. For me, I need this shaver for maintaining light stubble (which I do without the attachments) and for trimming sideburns. I don&#x27;t rely on this for a clean shave--that I do with a regular razor. So if that&#x27;s a concern for you, I don&#x27;t think this is your product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some cons:&lt;br /&gt;--when using the attachments, you have to aim the head at the same exact angle all over in order to get an even cut. This can be hard.&lt;br /&gt;--the attachments feel like they would break very easily.&lt;br /&gt;--no stand for the shaver or attachments, but at $15, I guess that&#x27;s fair.&lt;br /&gt;--no light on the razor itself indicating when it&#x27;s charged or running low or etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;--solid for the price&lt;br /&gt;--if you want it for simple grooming and stubble, it should meet your needs, but it doesn&#x27;t cut close enough for a clean shave.</li>
    <li> Nice product, works perfectly,  lots of options,  no complaints. But Philips should give a thought about making the package customer friendly. It took me half a day to open the hard plastic case.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. My husband loves everything about this. Holds a charge for a long time.</li>
    <li> I got this at a great price and it has a lot of different functions and the battery life is unbelievable. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve charged it once in the past month!</li>
    <li> I had another one for fifteen years, this new model is even better. I like that this one will hold a charge for a few days. The old one would lose charge after a few hours off the charger.</li>
    <li> Like it so much as i cant get this model at my county. Hopefully it will last for few years.</li>
    <li> As imprecise as it is cheap.</li>
    <li> No hassles, easy to use.</li>
    <li> Best multigroom I&#x27;ve ever bought...one can style the way he wants with the help of multiple blades..</li>
    <li> It&#x60;s very easy to use! The Multigroom is very useful to cut the hear near the neck, the beard and also the hair in some places non specified, like the chest! VERY SATISFIED</li>
    <li> 10 hours to fully  charge. But otherwise a great buy for the price.</li>
    <li> This product worked very well right out of the package. It can be used wireless or connected to the cord. It&#x27;s powerful for its small size. All attachments came sharp, and greased on the inside (white stuff inside of attachment, not harmful, NOT glue). Very quiet and compact. It does not come with a case to hold it, but we found that an old dishwasher bottle nipple holder works very well for holding everything, lol. definitely worth the price. We are buying one for our son next.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Easy to use.</li>
    <li> Head, face, pits, taint; this thing gets it all with only one pass and optionally an alcohol wipe.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s powerfull and do a great job. Only thing I dislike is the nose trimmer, I prefer the other stile.</li>
    <li> Not a real close trimmer like it&#x27;s predecessor.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver based on the reviews here. It does the job. I used it 3-4 times now and did not charge it yet. So I assume the charge lasts quite long. It is not very good for close shaving but for trimming it works well.</li>
    <li> Worked really great, but I didn&#x27;t know that the attachable heads were made so weird. Really felt like I was getting a good shave</li>
    <li> it did not come with a shaver attachment but it dose come with all the rest of the  attachments Philips Norelco QG3330/42 Multigroom</li>
    <li> So far it does the job fairly well for the price.</li>
    <li> inexpensive, but good quality</li>
    <li> The nose/ear trimmer is completely useless - doesn&#x27;t cut AT ALL. The main razor works OK, but be careful to monitor the charging closely; the motor will refuse to start if you overcharge it! Overall, a very cheap product that does a very few limited things when it works.</li>
    <li> I gave this as a gift and did not get a feedback about the product.</li>
    <li> Using this for around 4 months. So far no problems what so ever. Use to trim beard and hair. Worth for the price</li>
    <li> works good but very expensive!</li>
    <li> very good, works as expected</li>
    <li> Yup the product was as expected and works fine too</li>
    <li> best ever thing ,, i shave with it normally ,,</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it much but it does seem to work fine and do the basic things that I wanted it to perform.</li>
    <li> I recently grew a goatee.  This trimmer is doing a good job of keeping it looking neat.  The adjustment on the beard trimmer is great for maintaining the length I want, which in my case is quite short.</li>
    <li> Works as promised. Good price.</li>
    <li> This Philips is worth more than its price. It shaves smoothly and it is better than more expensive wahl trimmers.&lt;br /&gt;It is very well made and some of the heads are made with durable plastic which makes the possibility of rust effecting them way less than other trimmers. I highly recommend this machine.&lt;br /&gt;The only bad thing about it is that it does not come with a carrying case or bag which kind of make it hard to store since it comes with 5 heads and a charger. Also the battery life is very minimal (45 minutes after a 10 hours charge) so if you are planning to use it on a trip of somewhere where it is hard to reach and plug it then I do not recommend this product. Other than that perfect!</li>
    <li> Good product and quick delivery. I like the various attachments and I found that there are some nice uses - nose and ear hair trimmer as well as eyebrows. If grooming is a priority for you, this is a great tool for you!</li>
    <li> Cuts great, fast easy cleanup. The only drawback is 10 hours charge time for 45 mins of cut time.</li>
    <li> Head and ... chins above the rest. Due to this not being quite as heavy of a metal blade as the more expensive models, less nicks occur. But, more importantly, there are more levels in the lower settings than in the &amp;#34;higher quality&amp;#34; options, as well. Overall, after trying the &amp;#34;better&amp;#34; models, I went straight back to this one. Where this was originally advertised, some years ago, for both facial and scalp grooming, it is now being marketed for just the face (likely, just an attempt to sell the more expensive models). However, I still use it for both, as it works wonderfully for this (just clean the blade well after use - and I would always lead with the chin before the scalp).</li>
    <li> This is my second Philips men&#x27;s grooming kit. My earlier one I used for almost 7 years and just because I moved from Europe to US I am not able to operate in US power standard. So I thought of upgrading with latest model in US. This is a very Nice product, works as described. I am completely impressed.</li>
    <li> Garbage! Garbage! Garbage! poor design the guards don&#x27;t go long enough to trim a beard that is longer the 1/2 of an inch.</li>
    <li> Awesome price point for a groomer that does the trick.</li>
    <li> Does everything it says it will do</li>
    <li> Wow. I was skeptical becaus this was so cheap but it works like a dream. Lots of power, easy to clean, very precise attachments. .</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a nose hair trimmer I had that had died after about a year of occasional use - was looking for something a bit more robust that would last a lot longer. This is great - does the job and comes with several attachments.</li>
    <li> shipped fast, works great</li>
    <li> My husband loves this razor and we saved about 50% off of a razor that Costco was selling with more attachments that he doesn&#x27;t need!</li>
    <li> I somehow thought this was inferior to the full-function clippers at $50. This does the trick just fine. It trims.</li>
    <li> So far so good. Thank you for providing this item.</li>
    <li> Great for a quick trim. easily worth the price very durable. I wish it had a longer battery life but all in all a great trimmer for the price</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this item. Great price, the product is solid. Many usable functions.</li>
    <li> Like it.  To many attachments though</li>
    <li> does what it said and fast</li>
    <li> This is great for my beard triming. I rarely have to charge it. One charge does last me a while. The price is good and overall brand quality is great.</li>
    <li> The package arrived before the EDD. The groomer is well made, angled correctly for the correct trim &amp; the various heads interlocks well.</li>
    <li> I replaced my old Phillips with this new model. I use this model for shaving my head. The one big note I would say is that this model really shaves close, I mean almost razor close. I like it though the toggle for the length is a little tricky and at times, I feel like I will break it when I change the setting. All in All, I am happy with the purchase. If it lasts for 8 years like my last Phillips razor, I will be very happy.</li>
    <li> Main issues.  I had to replace this immediately.  Waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  I need to spend 30 seconds shaving the same area to get a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  The attachments are very difficult to clean and get little hairs stuck inside.</li>
    <li> The number settings are so small they are difficult to read. The setting adjustment and on/off switch are on the opposite sides of each other. The previous model I purchased is much more easy to use because the switches are on the same side of the handle.</li>
    <li> Happy that I purchased this great deal. I can now have different textures for my beard and sideburns. A great buy indeed.</li>
    <li> Product was not worth buying. It included everything as advertised but quickly malfunctioned and I ended up purchasing a different brand. Luckily that one worked.</li>
    <li> It works great. I bought it for the sole purpose of a nose hair trimmer but have come to realize how handy the guards are for facial hair trimming.</li>
    <li> Works great...&amp; I love the 2 day, prime member, shipping!!</li>
    <li> It truly is a &amp;#34; multigroom&amp;#34; device. This was an update for me as I had an earlier model but the attachments broke.</li>
    <li> Works great, no problems so far</li>
    <li> Does a good job. Calibration numbers of beard trimmer are hard to see.</li>
    <li> Trimmed my walnuts perfectly.</li>
    <li> Based on other reviews, maybe I got a lemon. Mine lasted through TWO uses. Today, with the full trimmer or detailed trimmer attached, it does not run. With the nose trimmer attached, it runs fine. But, I didn&#x27;t buy just a nose trimmer. Guess I&#x27;ll be going through the hassle of returning this piece of junk.</li>
    <li> Great value for a great product.</li>
    <li> With lots of accessories, this trimmer is great all around!</li>
    <li> Excellent value. I didn&#x27;t look any further once I saw the price and was happy I didn&#x27;t waste time looking for a better deal because it comes with everything you need.</li>
    <li> My son had this set awhile back and liked it so much he wanted another one. He bought the All in One Multigroom by Norelco. He uses all the tools and likes that it is interchangeable. It comes with 5 attachments for complete trimming and styling of facial hair including a full trimmer, detail trimmer, nose trimmer, beard and mustache trimmer and stubble comb. It works excellent and for the price it is awesome. He highly recommends this set to anyone who wants an All in Tool Set to trim facial hair.</li>
    <li> It does the job in a great way</li>
    <li> Bougth it for a friend and now im getting it for me</li>
    <li> good build quality, attachments are nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main gripe is that it doesnt trim hair short enough. I rock the 5 oclock shadow look and use this to trim things down, I wish it cut hairs just a tad bit shorter.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t have this long before it ceased retaining a charge in the battery. Maybe a month tops. More unfortunately, it can&#x27;t be used at the same time that it is charging. So even trying to use it while plugged in is of no avail. Dies within seconds of use, even when plugged in, making it essentially useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Philips replaced this for free when I contacted them about it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a woman, and use this for underarms, etc. This is probably the first trimmer I&#x27;ve had that doesn&#x27;t cause underarm bumps.</li>
    <li> Excellent trimmer for the price</li>
    <li> Battery backup is very less&lt;br /&gt;Cant trim smoothly, get rashes on face after trimming&lt;br /&gt;Will take time to trim beard</li>
    <li> worked better than i exspeted</li>
    <li> very bad battery just 5 minutes and discharged</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend and he really likes it. I&#x27;ve seen this same one in store for 4-5$ more. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Love the clipper guards. They don&#x27;t accidentally fall off when pressing down on your face like other kinds of clippers</li>
    <li> Works very well, comfortable and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I saw is that the battery doesn&#x27;t last much, only 35 min with a 10 hrs charge and 45 min with a 16 hrs charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend you to keep it fully charged, in order to prevent to run out of battery in that middle of the shaving.</li>
    <li> This does a great job trimming my beard and mustache. And, as a bonus, one of the three attachments eliminates the anoint hairs growing in my ears and nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had it for two months and haven&#x27;t had any problems. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Met my expectations with the price that was on offer. Many attachments, therefore can be used at diff. lengths of hair.</li>
    <li> I cant say enough. This handheld portable has got all your problems solved. Charge it &amp; go! Im new to a groomed beard... but this guy has been my go-to the past few months. Super clean shaving.  And cleaning of the mechanical parts is just a wash under the water . If I saw this at a friends house I&#x27;d ask &amp;#34;Where can I buy one?&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Great value.  The trimmers work wonderfully. Best set I have had so far.</li>
    <li> The razor, while using the guard, is quite uncomfortable. Feels like it&#x27;s scraping off skin. It&#x27;s a pain to switch between attachments. The razor itself feels quite durable, but it&#x27;s not worth it. I missed the return policy so looks like I&#x27;m stuck with it. My fault!</li>
    <li> Recommend it for every smooth clean with no pain. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Better than I thought</li>
    <li> Works fairly well for the price.</li>
    <li> Its good. I haven&#x27;t used all the functionality as yet.</li>
    <li> Good trimmer.  I hope it lasts for a long time.</li>
    <li> Thanks, it was a wedding gift.</li>
    <li> I had a Norelco beard trimmer before and loved it, but I am loving the multigroom tool. I received it earlier this week - it&#x27;s powerful, easy to switch functions, and the parts can be rinsed. It would get a five star rating, but I really enjoyed the &amp;#34;self cleaning&amp;#34; aspect of my beard trimmer. The multigroom works well and I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Had another one for fifteen years, this new model is even better. I like that this one will hold a charge for a few days, they old one would lose charge after a few hours off the charger.</li>
    <li> Decent, but the indicator to see how close the cut will be is very tiny and hard to see. I had to put my reading glasses on to see it!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a replacement to a previous model that lasted about 10 years. Good product for a good price. It is worth noting this does not come with a storage stand or any sort of bag to hold the various attachments. The best upgrade for this model is that you can clean with water.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been through many trimmers over the years and conclude none of them are spectacular. In my arsenal of shaving equipment I have an electric Braun Pulsonic and Panasonic ESLUV61 each are exceptional for face, neck and in my particular circumstance head shaving however the trimmers are inadequate for goatee styling and not mention impossible for ear &amp; nose trimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best of lot was the Panasonic Multigroomer Pro Q63280 which I still have although at 5 years of age it&#x27;s certainly served me well and is hanging on by a thread. I paid around $25 for this marvel which is long out of production but you can still get them that is if you&#x27;re willing to pay $125-$150 from Amazon 3rd party sellers and eBay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mention this because at half power the Panny in a side by side comparison is more powerful than the This trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, the design is sleek and the price can&#x27;t be beat at 15 bucks but the trimmer disappoints on several levels:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Weak Motor at Full Charge&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Catches and pulls hairs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Charging Light stays Green&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Accessories are average for these types of trimmers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Not even a storage bag let alone a stand is included&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;ve done a lot that&#x27;s right here by reducing the number of cutting guards you need as the Facial one snaps on allowing you to click up or down to adjust closeness without having to pop another one on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is that despite the weak points this trimmer is a very good value for the price and performs better than expected at this price range.</li>
    <li> Great Quality and has held up for a long time now! The charge holds for just about a month and is noticeable when it is about to die so that you don&#x27;t end up with a half shaven face... Which is not fun... I haven&#x27;t used the nose trimming part, but thats because I don&#x27;t have the nose hair thats out-of-control at this point in my life. The thought of putting something in my nose that cuts hair is scary, so I stick to keeping my beard nice and pretty and that is all!</li>
    <li> Great to keep my Yetti ass under control, and face, and nose hairs, and everywhere else. Takes a few full charges to get the job done but there&#x27;s a price for beauty.</li>
    <li> Good quality product! 5 stars!</li>
    <li> Aside from it missing a foil trimmer head attachment, this is a perfect multigroom tool for me. I&#x27;ll keep my old one in tandem with this for buzzing down facial hair around the nose and lips.</li>
    <li> very nice piece of equipment.  versatility is great and it seems pretty powerful compared to an older one I have.  I have not tried using on my hair, beard and mustache.  It does a great job</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. The beard guard (or whatever they call it) has settings that in my opinion are difficult to adjust. I don&#x27;t wear glasses but almost feel like I need to in order to see the trimmer setting numbers. For what it accomplishes and how little it costs it&#x27;s not a bad deal, but older models of razors were easier to use than this one is.</li>
    <li> Came in perfect time, works great!!</li>
    <li> So far it does what it says it will. The nose clipper feels like it pulls the hairs out. Ouch.</li>
    <li> Packaged arrived in perfect condition thanks</li>
    <li> This product is super easy to use. It is not high-end (you are getting what you pay for) but I don&#x27;t need anything very fancy. I use it because the hair on my chin and neck grow much faster than on my jawline to even things out and it is perfect. My one complaint is that the different heads can be tough to change. Other than that I would recommend to someone in my position (cheap college student trying to maintain presentable facial hair)</li>
    <li> Reccieve it on time and good product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a licensed hair stylist and purchased one of these for my husband about a year ago. Recently my very expensive trimmer broke and I decided to get one for myself to use on my clients at the salon. I&#x27;m very happy with all of the attachments and their results. It was shipped quickly and I  would definitely buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Works Great So Far!! I have always bought Philips Norelco products.</li>
    <li> Nicks a bit at the &amp;#34;1&amp;#34; setting, but otherwise works like a charm.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t trim evenly on my beard. I had it on an average length and the attachment bends, that&#x27;s probably why it wasn&#x27;t even. And now I had to shave the whole thing off because it looks kinda patchy. I&#x27;m just disappointed...</li>
    <li> good for the low price</li>
    <li> I only got to use this trimmer a few times since the charger that came with it was defective. It seemed to work fine until it ran out of charge. I would have exchanged for a new one, but I bought the Norelco HairClipper 7100 (Model HC7452) from Walmart since I was in need of a haircut and didn&#x27;t want to wait.</li>
    <li> Works good for me. Feels like a good quality tool. Easy to charge, easy to use and clean. Would buy again!</li>
    <li> I just use this to trim my face when I&#x27;m feeling lazy and don&#x27;t want to bust out the razor.. actually.. I&#x27;m always lazy and never wanna bust out the razor lol. It gets the job done and the battery lasts for quite awhile.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Works great.  Numerous accessories for all of your shaving needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The beard trimmer has 18 settings.  I was a little skeptical assuming there would be no discernible difference between two adjacent setting.  But it turns out not to be the case.  I find setting number 8 too long, 6 too short, and 7 just right.  My older trimmer had only four setting and I found my perfect length to be between two of the settings.  I do find the numbers are hard to read.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charge lasts forever.  I have had it for over a month and have yet to charge it (after the initial charge).  My biggest complaint is the lack of a stand to hold the razor and accessories.  Basically I keep everything in the original box under the sink, which is less than optimal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great value for the price.</li>
    <li> I have had used Remington Products all my life, but this time i decided to get Philips, since it was cheap and on a deal. I decided to give this a shot. My two star comes from the fact that this trimmer pulled my beard hairs and when I used it without a guard to cut close.  I will be returning this product back to Amazon.</li>
    <li> Gets the job done.  Although I would have preferred an indicator light for charging status.</li>
    <li> Pulls &amp; nicks every chance it gets.&lt;br /&gt;Had a white &#x27;goo&#x27; on the part where the attachments go-no idea what that&#x27;s about.&lt;br /&gt;Felt too big for female hands &amp; the attachments are hard to change.&lt;br /&gt;Dislike overall...will keep &amp; pass it down. Search for the perfect trimmer continues...</li>
    <li> I look around and found this Norelco qg3330/42 online for way less than it would be in store...easy to clean, nice sleek style and great trimming attachments would recommend this bread trimmer ...fast shipping to California A++</li>
    <li> Great price and product! Thank you</li>
    <li> really handy product, also really good quality product, it is soft with the skin and doesn&#x27;t leave any marks. .</li>
    <li> Bought this for my Hubby and he was very happy with it.  So much better than the overly expensive brands.  Does a great job!</li>
    <li> Great replacement shaver for my husband! Easy to use attachments.</li>
    <li> This is a great all in one product... Keeps my beard and head looking great.</li>
    <li> A little flimsy on the adjuster side and its hard to get an exact measurement on the size but the machine works great!</li>
    <li> Work as expected!... Great!</li>
    <li> Great product affordable and easy to use. Comes with its own battery plus the cable. The add ons are not hard plastic so I doubt that they will last but work just as good</li>
    <li> Used a few times and then it became defective. Even if it is connected to the wall charger it doesn&#x27;t works.</li>
    <li> I love it. works great , and the price is very reasonable. would highly recommend itl</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. Good product.</li>
    <li> works good and good price</li>
    <li> My husband loves this!  Very good price .</li>
    <li> Philips norelco never ceases to amaze me.gives you a close shave and the great thing about it is it has a built in battery and also it has guards.for now on this is my go to.for the price i believe it should cost more.</li>
    <li> I enjoyed the product.  It is diverse and kept a battery charge for about a month when using once a week for about 15 minutes at a time.  However, 3 months after purchasing it will no longer turn on.  I would not recommend the product due to that despite being a life-long Philips Norelco user.</li>
    <li> Exactly what you would expect a shared to be, it does that and more.</li>
    <li> Great grooming device</li>
    <li> This charger came with a sub charge on it which I used right out of the box. it has done a very nice job trimming my new beard up and is very easy to use.</li>
    <li> Nicely designed, compact. Accessories twist on/off. Professional trim...</li>
    <li> I really like it. it is very useful  to cut hair or beard. it&#x27;s easy to clean it. and the price is also very good.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical that a rechargeable groomer this inexpensive could be any good, but after a couple weeks of using this, I&#x27;m very happy with it. Unless you do a lot of heavy duty grooming every day, I see no reason to spend any more than this.</li>
    <li> As a Professional Stylist and barber; These are my favorite trimmer for face and body. Can&#x27;t beat em... I had one pair last nearly 10 years. Good stuff!</li>
    <li> It works similar to my old Norelco Maveric.  It has more cutting head attachments than the old one.  My only squawk is that the whiskers build up inside the cavity of the cutter and are held by the manufacturers grease.  The head cannot be opened to clean it out but is only accessed through about a 3/8&amp;#34; hole in the bottom.  Other than that, it is great.</li>
    <li> I have used this for about a month now and I still have not had to charge the batter. All of the attachments work great. I am very happy I made this purchase.</li>
    <li> Has a very disconnected feel to it. When I tried to trim my beard it felt awkward, and unnatural. The only thing I use it for anymore is to trim me nose hairs. There are many better options out there. I personally like the Remington MB-200.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my fiancé as one of his bday gifts. He absolutely loves it (and he&#x27;s extremely picky). Works so well, so happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> Stays charged for a long time, charges quickly, and has a lot of attachments.</li>
    <li> Battery lasts a long time (have yet to have to recharge yet) and the different guards and blades are great.  Word of caution - nose hair trimmers can be rough on the nose - have several cuts that are healing (OUCH).  The only other &amp;#34;con&amp;#34; is that the hair does seem to fly all over compared to my old trimmer.  Having just grown a beard its nice to trim it down with the multi blades.</li>
    <li> not what I was looking for</li>
    <li> Simple and does what it is supposed to do.</li>
    <li> These clippers have allowed me to get rid of my razor and nose clippers. Best all in one ever. Quick delivery and have had it for a few months with no issues.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately I forgot electrical goods from the USA would be 120v while in Australia we use 240v. A converter so I can use the trimmer will cost around AUD50 so I have to decide if the USD20 item will be worth the extra. Ah me...</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> A good product, although it takes a while to load for my taste, and I did not like is that you can not see when the battery is charged, it must be calculated.</li>
    <li> Great price, and it seems to be a pretty good product. The on-off switch can be hard to toggle with wet hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest complaint though is the battery. It only lasts 5-10 minutes on a charge. This is fine if i just want to trim up the beard, but really annoying if you decide you want to groom other areas of the face / head / body. But as a beard trimmer,  it works great.</li>
    <li> it is given that the trimmer can work with corded use as well but it is not. We have to charge the trimmer each nd every time.And the stubble combs are not good too.hate it.</li>
    <li> Works great and is affordable</li>
    <li> Works great, good alternative for what I had and great price.</li>
    <li> A good quality product. But when you split the head part you see that your hair is accumulated there. And it doesn&#x27;t seem to clean up. Being cordless is a plus.I see lately that having a wide headed machine could be better. Shaving is not as fast as I expected.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use and change grooming heads. Different size trimming heads make it easier to shape and trim the way you want.</li>
    <li> Seems Ok. First one of these I have ever owned, so don&#x27;t have a lot to compare it to....  Depth guide on facial hair was a little tricky...That side of my mustache will grow back... ;)</li>
    <li> I mainly use this product to maintain my stubble. It works great and I have no real complaints. Cheap too.</li>
    <li> pile of crap. the guards are awkward, and just a bad idea all around</li>
    <li> These items are good... Thank you</li>
    <li> Great trimmer. Excellent value. Replaced two other brands with this one. So far so good.</li>
    <li> Good item and it work as it advertised, just as I want it... Nothing bad to say as I get it with a great price... Just that it would be good if it include pouch also...</li>
    <li> Does a Very Nice Job, Can&amp;#34;t go wrong with it !!!</li>
    <li> I chose this product for reviews and price. It works great. The charge lasts a good amount of time and the razor works well. I&#x27;m very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I owned this thing for about 6 months, which sounds like a long time, but I rarely used it. It lasted through three (THREE!) charges of the battery before it would no longer hold any charge. Since this piece of junk can&#x27;t be used while plugged in (CONTRARY TO THE ITEM DESCRIPTION!), it&#x27;s now in my garbage, and I&#x27;ll probably never buy another P-N groomer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the flimsy plastic guards don&#x27;t stay in place when subjected to even moderate pressure, which is fun when you&#x27;re trying to take your sideburns down a little and end up snapping the guard down to its shortest setting because you pressed a little too hard, and then have a nice big patch shaved into the side of your face, and end up having to trim your entire beard down to Miami Vice status because you cheaped out on your beard trimmer and thought all the &amp;#34;helpful attachments&amp;#34; made this any less of a total piece of crap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two stars because, without any of the attachments or guards equipped, it actually did a fine job of trimming my mustache and jawline, that is until the battery stopped batterying.</li>
    <li> Very nice, easy to clean, easy to change heads. This trimmer is easier to use and trims as effective as any more expensive trimmers I have used in the past.</li>
    <li> I tried all of them ..for me this is the best  .You set the length and forget it .And the battery charge lasts forever on one charge . This was the best price also .</li>
    <li> I had an older model of this trimmer and this one is so much better. Works well. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> The guide numbers seem to be radically different than the standard.  Went to trim a beard and ended up having to go clean shaven.  If you buy this experiment carefully with the settings.</li>
    <li> Good and affordable. My wife likes to trims my hair with it.</li>
    <li> Great little trimmer. Time will tell about its battery life and longevity, but the instructions are clear on how to best take care of it.</li>
    <li> Works great, lots of attachments but is sort of loud and annoying. Great product for the price.</li>
    <li> Been getting a great trim using this shaver.  It&#x27;s quite powerful and so far I haven&#x27;t even had to charge it, it&#x27;s battery life seems to be quite solid.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve found that I just don&#x27;t like the design of this. I have an older Conair trimmer that has guards like a large barber hair trimmer. It also has a control over the built-in guard of the razor itself. It makes it impossible to cut below the desired distance. With the Norelco, the cut length changes depending on the angle, making it much more prone to uneven patches and bloody nicks.</li>
    <li> only complaint I have is that you can&#x27;t get a close shave other wise works great.</li>
    <li> I could use this just once before the battery died! This is a piece of scrap! My recommendation? Don&#x27;t buy it! Put a little more money and get a better one!</li>
    <li> Awesome! Holds a charge for a long time and is powerful with many adjustable settings.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best one I&#x27;ve bought so far.</li>
    <li> Decent set of accessories, we&#x27;ll see how it holds up over time. So far I&#x27;m happy though.</li>
    <li> This product does its intended job with good results.</li>
    <li> Good value, great trimmer</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT PRICE&lt;br /&gt;I LOVED IT&lt;br /&gt;CHEAP PRICE</li>
    <li> Good product at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know, I have not found this product that amazing as other reviewers are hyping it. It does cut ok, but not perfect.&lt;br /&gt;The adapters are not properly marked, so you need to compare them to the picture to see which is which. A color differentiation would be better then small letters and judging by the picture. The steps between the length seem to be a big jump, would need a more settle adjustment to get that &amp;#34;in between&amp;#34; length. The worst thing is the battery life, it&#x27;s not nearly up to the standards that Phillips has been delivering in prior years. I have to have this on the charger all the time. Probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. I would spend an extra 15-20 and go with a different brand.</li>
    <li> Purchasing a second one since the first is about done for.  It lasted a good while and found the price good for the quality.</li>
    <li> Its really Good one ...Firstly I didn&#x27;t like the item because i came through my friends rumors.but finally I liked it very much ..</li>
    <li> nice clippers, holds a charge for a very long time</li>
    <li> Hold a charge and is very easy to clean.  Comes with plenty of accessories and is lightweight, so carrying it on trip is easy.</li>
    <li> Moving up from a Remington, this feels good to hold and retains good charge. Did not have very high expectations from a basic grooming kit, which I use only to trim and shape a beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are few issues which bother me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This comes with multiple accessories, which is good. But does not include any pouch to keep them together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trim size adjuster is not too user friendly. You really have to pay attention to adjust the setting you want to keep. This becomes more of an issue, since the trim guide needs to be pushed up or down to select trim size. This would not have been such a bother if... which brings me to the third issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &#x27;trim guide&#x27; collects all the trimmed out hair within its curves and notches. To clean it all out properly, you need to slide out the trim guide. After cleaning it all out, you need to adjust the trim size again every time. For those with reading prescription glasses, it is not too easy to read the setting numbers. You also have to be very precise with the pressure applied to slide so that you stop just so, at the right setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There you have it...</li>
    <li> Easy to use and comfortable.</li>
    <li> It worked very well. Its very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;You can see all stuffs which comes with it in the pictures.</li>
    <li> the best beard trimmer I have owned. This thing runs really smooth and the adjustments on the clips are fantastic!</li>
    <li> Great product for a bargain!</li>
    <li> The best trimmer ever. I used it from 2 years. I bought 2 for my friends.</li>
    <li> It is very good. It holds vharge for very long time. I have had it or 3 weeks now and I have not have any problems with it.</li>
    <li> This product is awful! After over a month of use, it doesnt cut or trim effectively at all. The blades seem to struggle to even trim a neckline. It&#x27;s a shame Norelco puts its name on such a poor product. I shouldve known that the price was too good to be true. My advice would be to look elsewhere. This is truly an example of you get what you pay for.....</li>
    <li> Having tried a few trimmers/clippers/etc I can say there&#x27;s not really anything better in the pricerange</li>
    <li> Great groomer exceeded expectations.</li>
    <li> Clipper works well, but the head exchange is a bit fussy. The older model featured exchangeable heads, but the clipper guard remained in place attached to the head.. This model requires that you remove the clipper guard which attached to the clipper body and must be removed before removing the clipper head. The clipper guard length indicator (numerical) is very hard to read. There is no colored index marker on the clipper head and clipper body to align the two when attaching the heads. Therefore, you have a fuss around to get the attachment correct.</li>
    <li> Amazing Raze for the price!!!!!</li>
    <li> Works great. holds a good charge</li>
    <li> My husband loves this thing, and keeps himself looking respectable with it, which is good enough for me. One star taken off for the construction, he says it feels a little cheap, but it&#x27;s worked just fine so far.</li>
    <li> Quality review for the money.</li>
    <li> Great product for the price.</li>
    <li> Just bought this so the jury is still out... but the smart money is on a guilty verdict.  First impressions are not good.  I just about had to destroy the thing to get it out of the @#&amp;* packaging.  Ridiculous.  I guess it is for anti-theft purposes for units sold in stores, but the company would do well to think about where things are headed in this world with on line sales.  Why make it so hard for your CUSTOMER???  Then when I flicked it on for the first time it was like &amp;#34;wow, that&#x27;s really loud&amp;#34;.  I used to own a cheaper one of these things manufactured by a Philips Norelco competitor (Conair) which was MUCH quieter.</li>
    <li> I had a previous model of Norelco Grooming Kit and it was great.  There was a button you pressed to change heads and it was efficient and easy to do.  The trimmer was easy to clean after using as all areas were accessible to remove hair.  The new model is a cheap and I am not satisfied with it.  There are little plastic heads that have to be placed correctly in the handle and manually turned.  The different heads do not accurately reflect the length of hair trimming.  It is difficult to clean since hair remains in the greased holder that holds the heads; certainly not very sanitary.  I wish I could still purchase the older model since it worked great for many years.</li>
    <li> Very good product and priced right.</li>
    <li> Terrible won&#x27;t charge at all</li>
    <li> I had the older model and trimming my beard was much quicker on the more powerful model.  This one takes a little longer to get the job done(Not too long though) I like the attachments and it&#x27;s much quieter than the older one (which is great if you live with people.)</li>
    <li> Great product and service! Great trimmer  with many attachments.</li>
    <li> This product is very much better than any product in its range and the best I have ever used before</li>
    <li> Works Great! Great Value! This is a low end model but works great for the price!</li>
    <li> works great and good assortment of attachments.  the charger some folks are complaining about is fine - maybe i have a newer version of it?  there&#x27;s no mount just a plug adapter which works best for me</li>
    <li> Nice up grade from my Norelco that&#x27;s over ten years old.</li>
    <li> long life battery........woks perfect ..&lt;br /&gt;It works better than expected .&lt;br /&gt;This is my first Philips trimmer and believe me its best.</li>
    <li> I had lost the charger and it was cheaper for me to just buy the whole thing all over again. Great product.  Does the job right and a full charge last for months! But i only use it once a week.</li>
    <li> Clean the blade is difficult, shaving is not clean</li>
    <li> Not your high end salon trimmer but works well for simple things. Batteries last long and design is stylish. Would recommend it.</li>
    <li> This trimmer has served every purpose it has advertised. The battery lasts significantly longer than my past trimmers, and all attachments work well. The only reason to restrict from giving this item a perfect 5 stars is the lack of a head hair attachment. Due to it&#x27;s name, multigroom, I slightly long for a head hair attachment to keep my haircut as spiffy as possible! Other than head grooming, this trimmer will suit all of your needs!</li>
    <li> really good quality !!</li>
    <li> It was exactly as it stated and arrived on time with perfect packaging that was sealed and brand-new.  After having used the product for about a month I have found that it works fantastic and even does a better job than I thought it would seeing how it isn&#x27;t the highest-end or most expensive groomer.  In fact I think it is even a little bit on the cheap end but you wouldn&#x27;t know it from its performance.  The charge lasts longer for me than the stated time I&#x27;ve noticed which is great, usually they always last less than what they say when using the battery but it lasts longer for sure.  Now if I had to say anything negative about it.......which mind you is actually hard to do here.......I would say that I was hoping for better performance out of the nose trimmer.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong it works and I would even say that it works fine but it takes a little bit more time and focus than I&#x27;ve experienced before with some of the higher-end models.  Again it works fine but if I could change anything I would make the nose trimmer a little bit more effective but it gets the job done.  Not the best most detailed review on here I&#x27;m sure but I hope it helps someone out there.  I was looking for an inexpensive groomer that does it all and basically just works and does what it is supposed to and this completely met all of my needs and saved me a few bucks at the same time. I recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a replacement for another Phillips product, I like this one better. The tool for his ears and the trimmer for behind his head.</li>
    <li> This seems great. Got this in order to prepare myself for a date with someone.</li>
    <li> A great, well-priced product for cleaning up your sideburns or trimming around the ears.  Good for facial hair work too.</li>
    <li> I ordered this as a replacement for my last trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;This works great and is nice and quite.&lt;br /&gt;I only gave it 4 stars because like the other reviews state there is no charging and accessory base to house everything.&lt;br /&gt;I thought about sending it back but don&#x27;t want to go through that hassle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ROCK ON</li>
    <li> It is a huge shame it does not have a foil shaver. Other than that, it is great: waterproof, quality blades and multiple heads to use for anything from hair trimming to body shaving although the latter can not be quite safe.</li>
    <li> So far i am liking it and it has great combination of tools but there was one missing in the combination.</li>
    <li> Not impressed. Doesn&#x27;t get close to skin. Leaves pretty long hair even without the guard. I wouldn&#x27;t waist your time with this unit.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t figure out how to change the &amp;#34;guard&amp;#34; setting</li>
    <li> Works really well. FYI Gentlemen, be careful when grooming</li>
    <li> works well, nice for the price</li>
    <li> Replaced an older version. Like this set.  Guards are a big odd.</li>
    <li> best groomer I have ever had.  works well, low noise and low vibration.  easy to remove and install the heads, works with battery and if that will no longer hold a charge, I can use it corded.  good product.</li>
    <li> amazing quality, very good battery duration.</li>
    <li> Amazing product, it does a professionals&#x27; job</li>
    <li> The item is great, however the packaging was terrible and there is no way the packaging tray can be used for storage.</li>
    <li> Came in way earlier than expected. Charged it as instructed, trimmed my mustache and goatee to perfection. (Well my face left a lot to be desired, but my goatee and mustache rocked!) I was so impressed, I talked my wife into cutting my hair with it, which had grown really long. We decided to go short.&lt;br /&gt;We set the guard and cut my hair. There were no pulls or pain and it gave a really great cut. I took a lot of hair off and it compares favorably to a lot of hair trimmers I&#x27;ve had.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a great value. If it went through that God awful mop I grew on my head and made it look good, it will handle whatever you can throw at it.</li>
    <li> Works great! Hubby loves it!!!</li>
    <li> Nice trimmer but the power button seems to be on the wrong side of the trimmer.?</li>
    <li> What a joke. You do get what you pay for in this case. First of all, this thing is tiny, the attachments are cheap plastic, the guide numbers aren&#x27;t standard, the nose / ear trimmer does a terrible job and hurts and on top of all that this thing is pretty loud. Bad experience overall. I&#x27;m going to keep using my 7yo basic Conair trimmer.</li>
    <li> Works great on the whole body besides the face.</li>
    <li> So far so good. I had a similar one by another manufacturer for years and used it every few days to trim beard, nose, and ear hairs. So far its done the job just as well as that one, and time will tell as to the reliability and longevity, but so far so good. It would have been nice if it came with a charging  stand but the old one never had one either so not a downgrade just not neat laying on the counter instead of in a stand like my toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;I still would buy and think I got a great value</li>
    <li> This arrived at my house earlier than they said it would.  The multigroom works great, I used right out of the box as it was charged already.  It did not yank at some of the hairs like my old one did.  Overall its a great multigroom for the price.</li>
    <li> It loses its charge in less than 10 minutes. It pulls the hairs instead of cuts.&lt;br /&gt;Charlie Mann&lt;br /&gt;Gaithersburg, MD</li>
    <li> I bought this groomer to replace my previous Norelco G370 after the batteries died. I use the groomer to trim the hair around my ears and to trim my sideburns. Although the QG3330 works well, I find it difficult to install the various attachments, and find it frustrating that I need to not only replace the detail trimmer with the larger trimmer head, then I need to install and adjust the comb after that is installed - far too many tedious steps, IMO. And to top it off, the cutters on the detail trimmer face one way, and cutters on the larger head faces the other way - really?!!!! The G370 allowed a simple and quick change from one attachment to the other. If you use a single attachment, this will serve you well - but for those of us that use the various attachments, it is a pain - I guess I&#x27;ll get used to it, but I don&#x27;t consider the QG3330 to be a stellar example of industrial design!</li>
    <li> Nice update on the product, very adjustable and easy to clean.  Does a great job, very satisfied with the improvements.</li>
    <li> Seriously I want my money back, to my understanding philips has a satisfaction guarantee for its products and I am not satisfied. I am baffled how people can ranks this more than one, the shave is uneven and is terrible for trimming. You can get cheaper philips kinds better than this one.</li>
    <li> The trimmers do not cut close enough.  The only thing that does work good if the nose and ear trimmer</li>
    <li> Ita a good product. I like too much, because its easy to use and help me a lot. I love this product</li>
    <li> He&#x27;s head over heels in love with this product. I am head over heels in seeing a &amp;#34;Hair Free&amp;#34; sink and neat trim..Must buy!</li>
    <li> All I wanted was a shaver/trimmer to replace my G370 which unfortunately had a piece fall out of the beard trimmer after 2 years of use. I ended up getting this Multigroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is, for all intents and purposes, a far inferior product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s beard trimmer, or comb, is atrocious. I used it once and I ended up having an incredibly patchy beard with holes in it. It shaves very unevenly because of its &amp;#34;modern&amp;#34; design where you clip the comb behind the base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The precision trimmer barely works. It still leaves a lot of leftover stubble. Again, far inferior to the G370&#x27;s precision trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s impossible to do anything resembling a clean shaven look with this product as well. It simply does not cut enough hair with any of the attachments on any setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor and do not buy this. You will be disappointed and end up buying another one.</li>
    <li> For the money, exactly what i needed and works well overall. As others have mentioned, doesnt come with carry case but for the price it didnt matter. Good choice</li>
    <li> This is a great product with good battery backup and ease of use. It has all the adjustments that a grooming kit requires.</li>
    <li> great piece of travel kit.</li>
    <li> Great multigroomer, when i use it on my face it gives me the perfect amount of rugged but shaved</li>
    <li> My Husband loves his Philips Norelco QG3330 Multigroom---It has every attachment that you would need and they all work great !!&lt;br /&gt;The service was great !!&lt;br /&gt;Thank You Again,&lt;br /&gt;ML</li>
    <li> Find something else. Poor at trimming. Doesn&#x27;t hold a charge.</li>
    <li> I love this razor, and I hope that it lasts for a very long time. I will admit that I was concerned about some of the attachments but they all work flawlessly! It seems that about every 12 to 18mo I have to get a new razor because the one I currently use craps out on me. I did a nice run down through about at least 75 razors or so before I noticed this one and put it on my wishlist with a couple of others to compare. I am extremely glad I chose this one. very smart purchase!</li>
    <li> Works just fine and better than the groomer I had before.</li>
    <li> So far so good! I purchased it a couple of weeks. I really like all the attachments. The battery life is ok. It is also washable so an added advantage.</li>
    <li> Works great and cost is reasonable.</li>
    <li> Most difficult package I&#x27;ve ever opened. Insanely tough plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ironically, the trimmer shields feel like the cheapest and most fragile possible plastic. I&#x27;m sure it will shatter if I happen to drop the trimmer on the floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, would be nice for some sort of pouch or zip-lock bag for the attachments.</li>
    <li> This solved my problem last fathers&#x27; day.  My dad is so happy when he opened the box.  Priceless!</li>
    <li> not as close trim as I would like. my old one did a better job...its ok...</li>
    <li> Good quality  and arrived on time</li>
    <li> Best beard trimmers and multi goom product on the market! highly recommended</li>
    <li> it works but not great and not bad either. i would rather purchase this product because the higher end stuff usually goes bad within like 2-4 years anyway. i&#x27;ve had two of them that cost $100+ stop working inside a 2 year window. so it makes sense to buy a cheap one that will last just as long and works almost as good.</li>
    <li> Good quality trimmer, sturdy, fast and easy to use. haven&#x27;t faced any problems with it yet. What I like about the product is that you can rinse it without having to worry about the water damaging the inner motor or anything. But keep in mind that its a trimmer, so if you your are looking for something that gives you a close shave, this one is not gonna do that. Even the precision trimmer top would get you a little visible stubble not a completely clean face, some people have asked about this in the question segment, so I thought I should mention it here. For the price, it is the best trimmer available out there.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what other people are looking for in a groomer but this thing does everything I need at a price much better than the rest.  A very good value.</li>
    <li> Highly recommending this if you want to get rid of the money that you spending in barber also save time etc... I start to cut my hair and beard since 3 month with this and so happy that the machine can do whatever you want nicely. Still works amazingly.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it much, but it is built with high quality.  Easy to clean up after use.</li>
    <li> Like it . Just wish it had a case</li>
    <li> Works very well to date. I use it for beard, nose and...nether regions and it performs well in all catagories. I wouldn&#x27;t use it to shave &amp;#34;down town&amp;#34; as it might bite, but it works plenty good at getting close and general manscaping.</li>
    <li> Works as Described; I love this product; And it finish of the product is great.. Feels good in your hands</li>
    <li> Does the job.. Nothing fancy but works well</li>
    <li> Best product for students.&lt;br /&gt;I have gifted two such for my friends and&lt;br /&gt;suggested to four more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, recently I&#x27;ve heard that if the hair isn&#x27;t cleaned&lt;br /&gt;regularly, there are chances of allergies to develop</li>
    <li> You do not have the power to shave, leaves no reason you the beard is only for routing, although the price is high quality shaver.</li>
    <li> great tool for a great price</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and he seems to really like it. It has all the features that he needs for trimming. Plus it seems extremely sturdy and reliable.</li>
    <li> Amazing!!! Just simply amazing. Great build and quality!!</li>
    <li> grooms great and battery last a long time .. the extra attachments are great.. make it worth the money. frot hose of us that don&#x27;t want to spend alot for the same result</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s be honest....some of us bought this for our ...um...yeah. It works for that. Works well, even. Recommend this for trimming the nether regions.</li>
    <li> Hubby loves it. Was worried about getting the cheaper one compared to the more expensive model, but works just fine. No complaints from him yet.</li>
    <li> Great product. Does its job pretty well</li>
    <li> my first trimmer (not norelco) slowly lost its ability to hold a charge, and i finally had to replace it. this is a much better unit, very easy to use, trims my beard nicely, wife has even used it to give me an interim haircut. have used it multiple times and haven&#x27;t had to recharge it yet. overall very happy with this product and would not hesitate to recommend</li>
    <li> I like it but the prevous one was better</li>
    <li> But be careful before you get crazy trimming anything. You need to practice carefully unless you want to look like a 2 year old did the job!</li>
    <li> Gifted to my friend and he loves it. Serves all the purpose and he can make different shapes and designs.</li>
    <li> A very good multigroom tool</li>
    <li> Got this to replace the one that I lost (but found again a few weeks ago). This is better model then the older one easier to trim and seems like it is better quality then the older model - which worked pretty good on its own. I like that it can get wet without destroying the thing. Cheap and works, well worth the buy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for a couple months and have used it to trim my beard. It works well and the battery last a long time.</li>
    <li> I finally replaced my old Norelco trimmer because the guard on it broke... for this price you really can&#x27;t ask for anything better than this product.</li>
    <li> Great product my husband love&#x27;s it works really well, was definitely a good buy!</li>
    <li> Keeping my beard from becoming too bushy, and being able to trim mustache are no longer hard to do (scissors are not the right tool!).  Comes with three twist-on trimmer blades (narrow, wide, nose) and two combs, one for narrow, one for wide.  The combs attach to the trimmer body, and have a scale that lets you adjust the cutting length so you can get it just right and repeat it from shave to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The on/off switch is a little hard to slide - so at first I was confused how to turn it on.  Push the slide forward towards the trimmer head, and with some pressure, it&#x27;ll turn on.  It is rechargeable, so you have freedom to charge it and take it with you on short trips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really like!</li>
    <li> it is easy to shave and good quality.&lt;br /&gt;design is very comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;i like the way how it shaves.&lt;br /&gt;thank u</li>
    <li> Pretty good trimmer! Work as expected!</li>
    <li> The battery doesn&#x27;t last 1 minute with 3 months of use!</li>
    <li> Great Product. Great Price.</li>
    <li> Shaves those &amp;#34;hard to get&amp;#34; areas with ease! *but be very careful* ;-)</li>
    <li> Great for beard maintenance and doesn&#x27;t require daily charging. I regularly get over 30 mins of use before having to charge it.</li>
    <li> Worked well until it broke. And they won&#x27;t replace it because of the return policy</li>
    <li> Excellent, easy and cut. All I want . . . works.</li>
    <li> The size guide is not accurate.  Intended to use a size 3 to cut my hair and ended up being more like a size 1.</li>
    <li> This is my second Norelco beard trimmer as the first one just died after a few years of good use. for $20ish bucks I could live with 2-3 years of use. This one has more attachments, as my first just had a simple plastic head that went from 0.5mm to something like 20mm. The addition of a smaller trimmer head which makes it easier to use around the nose, and a nose hair trimmer is nice.    Can&#x27;t speak much to the battery use but I really don&#x27;t know why anyone would truly need a wireless beard trimmer. You are almost definitely using this thing in a bathroom with an outlet 99.99% of the time.  ***update*** You cannot use this product plugged in if the battery is dead which is terrible. You have to let it charge. My last beard trimmer always worked at full strength if it was plugged in. This is a huge design flaw!</li>
    <li> Just bought one. I can&#x27;t wait to shave my balls. One of the length heads is really hard to use.</li>
    <li> All was good, just excellent product right now.</li>
    <li> Thank&#x27;s for best supply!!!!</li>
    <li> Very useful, for the price.</li>
    <li> I would have really Really appreciated a fine shaving head like my last unit had but for the money this is a good deal. Only negative is the guard must be removed before exchanging the head...</li>
    <li> Great Trimer,,,, last a long time on charge also</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe the price!  I got 2-one for my husband and one for my son. There is no carrying case or little plastic holder. I got an old large coffee cup and put everything in there. It works great and looks cute in the bathroom.</li>
    <li> Really good staff :))</li>
    <li> already knew how product worked before i bought it just wanted one of my own the only thing missing is the charging bse but other than that its a great product and works very well</li>
    <li> I got it for my boyfriend and he likes it.</li>
    <li> This is a good one. It has a great nose hair trimmer.</li>
    <li> Very good, is strong,</li>
    <li> Great Product...Awesome features for less money..Works well, Looks Good, Lot of adjustments with it. I will recommend this to everyone</li>
    <li> Perfect product..perfect price</li>
    <li> The attachments have a tendency to get hairs inside them and I&#x27;m not talking about the blade parts.  The attachments inside have a white lubricant that the hairs tend to stick to.  It works, it clips and trims - no issues there.  I do wish it had a better carrying tray or even just a nylon bag to put everything in.</li>
    <li> This is a great product!!!! It is the second Philips Norelco buzzer i have owned and they both have performed beyond expectations.  The charge holds well over multiple uses and haircuts and the blades cut great.  It is light and easy to handle vs another cordless buzzer i own and actually cuts hair better than the bigger bulkier one. I love the adjustable clipper so you don&#x27;t need a bunch of different attachments for different lengths only draw back its that on the closest setting it hums a little. I haven&amp;#34;t tried the nose hair trimmer or the beard trimmer attachments so i wont comment on those but everything else works great.</li>
    <li> This trimmer works. I needed one that would work on 220 volts, and this does.</li>
    <li> Met all my needs with all the attachments.  Cuts smoothly with no drag and trims closer than my previous trimmer</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and a great shaver.</li>
    <li> I replaced old one with new one. Liked the old one and the new one works better, cause it&#x27;s NEW</li>
    <li> Bought this to make an effort to keep my facial hair short but even and it works fine at that, does exactly what I need it to do.</li>
    <li> The charger didn&#x27;t work my second time using it. However, aside from that one time, it&#x27;s been working fine ever since for some reason. So the device itself works well, but the jury is out on the charger&#x27;s reliability.</li>
    <li> this is a long lasting , i had the same one before and it lasted for 7 yrs or more i think. Thats why i get a the same brand again..</li>
    <li> An excellent unit and now I can trim the nose and ear hairs...</li>
    <li> My son is very happy with this and I was happy with the price and packaging.</li>
    <li> This groomer does the job it was designed to do. Love the many attachments! This one groomer can perform many grooming tasks. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> my hubby loves this shaver, we had one before like this finally wore out.  he has sensitive skin and this really does the job</li>
    <li> This is really nice.  Arrived on time.</li>
    <li> The item arrived with no damage.  Initial use reveals that the unit performs as advertised. My only complaint was that it was extremely difficult to get it out of its plastic packaging.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver around september, I charged it once and have yet to charge again. It is still holding a charge and shaving my beard like a champ. Hall of fame shaver</li>
    <li> This trimmer has a pretty powerful motor comsidering the price plus it came with very useful parts. Overall it&#x27;s a good buy.</li>
    <li> The battery died on mine after 4 months and is completely useless now. I used it maybe 10 times.  I fully charge it and it only stays on for about 1 minute. Enough to shave only half of my face. I also bought this because it has a cord attached to it. I thought that would mean that you can use it while it&#x27;s plugged in even if your battery isn&#x27;t charged but that&#x27;s not true. It has to be charged and have a working battery to run.</li>
    <li> Missing regular shaver attachment for close work.</li>
    <li> I went almost four months after receiving this trimmer without having to plug it in. All of the attachments work great, and I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for an easier method of shaping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Battery lasts months with everyday use&lt;br /&gt;Many adapters that all work together for different purposes&lt;br /&gt;Only requires one or two passes for full trim&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;None</li>
    <li> Effective at doing what you need it to do, i only wish it came with some kind of holder/stand for the groomer and its attachments. My previous Norelco served me several years and I hope this one holds up as well.</li>
    <li> The best EVER for the price. Non-negotiable. Get this without hesitation. Good for ALL parts of the body. I trim my beard with it at level 5.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and no negative comments from me. Battery lasts long enough to not charge it regularly and once battery is dying, I plug the cable in and keep using.</li>
    <li> Broke after ONE MONTH! the thing just stopped charging. I recommend just spending an extra 20.00 for something tht lasts. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> this philips norleco is a one of the best norleco product, great item.looks well, works well. overall 9.5/10 not 10/10 :))</li>
    <li> Love this product. Very fast shipping....</li>
    <li> The product is very nice and battery backup is very good. The every aspect of this product is very good.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Cuts like a blade of titanium. Good quality (not excellent) materials used. Looks like i wont be buying another trimmer for quite a while.</li>
    <li> This machine is a great value. The motor is strong and the blade sharp. Worth the money.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Price&lt;br /&gt;Accessories&lt;br /&gt;decent quality&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Pulled facial hair when I tried going too fast.&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t feel &amp;#34;smooth&amp;#34; on my skin like high end trimmers have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary:&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for an upgrade to an $8 trimmer than just wasn&#x27;t good enough. I have used this trimmer 2 times and with a little patients it doesn&#x27;t pull hairs, and it didn&#x27;t feel too rough / abrasive on my skin. It came in good packaging and had a boat load of accessories if you are into that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this as a inexpensive or mid-level trimmer.</li>
    <li> This is no good for trimming a beard.. maybe maintaining a 5 o clock shadow, but when trimming a beard it is inconsistent and left my face looking patchy. Had to shave my beard completely off and now I have to figure out how to return this gift without a receipt and an open package :(</li>
    <li> This is a great little groomer that seems to do it all...and quickly too  ! It&#x27;s easy to change attachments also.</li>
    <li> This is everything it should be. I bought a Wahl trimmer on Amazon which rusted within a week and the motor slowly died out over four months. A week in, this is a great product. It&#x27;s gentle to the skin and can be used on other areas of the body as well.</li>
    <li> Its just the trimmer. You get another precision trimmer with this and also nose hair remover. It works fine. Charge actually lasts for 35 mins. Its the best product in this price range</li>
    <li> This is a amazing product. I gor it for 11 dollars and its worth it. Amazing options and performance wise just too good. Serves its purpose</li>
    <li> I had a Philips Norelco T980 Turbo Vacuum Trimmer. I purchased it on October 14, 2008 and it became my first beard trimmer and it performed marvelously. Until recently I had been using this particular trimmer and, like I said, it had no problems and I enjoyed using it. Then, due to my mistake of dropping it on an angle, the &amp;#34;clearview hair chamber&amp;#34; broke into 2. Woe is me. I didn&#x27;t necessarily need to buy a new hair trimmer, all the function of the device still performed well - hair just manages to get all over the place now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now this new Philips Norelco QG3330/42 Multigroom came along and frankly.. it kinda sucked in comparison.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s got a smaller head for cutting. All these attachments and nowhere to put them. The Vacuum Trimmer came with a nice little convenience bag. Hair kinda sticks in the blades for the multigroom. So, at least for me, I kinda have to shake it out after each pass with the trimmer - an annoyance. Charge time of 10 hours for 35 minutes of charge?? Are you kidding me? That&#x27;s terrible. With the no-longer available vacuum trimmer, I could use it; take a shower; and it would be back to full charge relatively soon thereafter. This new multigroom cannot shave with 0% battery power whilst being plugged in - the vacuum trimmer was shaving like a champion while it was plugged in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, I&#x27;m just generally disappointed with what I had versus a few years later, what is now available.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m probably reluctantly going to keep it. It wasn&#x27;t terribly expensive. But what does Philips care, they have my money now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try something different.</li>
    <li> Needed a new multigroom kit after my last one died.  After reading some of the reviews here I was a little hesitant about buying this one.  I&#x27;m glad I purchased this one.  Let me say that I have not had any trouble with this one at all.  I have never been cut or &amp;#34;bitten&amp;#34; by it once.  I use it to trim my goatee and to cut my children&#x27;s hair.  Love all the attachments, especially the beard trimmer guide that allows me to decide how long I want my goatee to be.  Don&#x27;t hesitate on purchasing this item it has been a wonderful groomer for me.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product for the money. This product makes beard grooming much easier.</li>
    <li> when you charge it it stay for a very long time.</li>
    <li> Came quickly, liked all the attachments, quality is up to par , as its a known company to me for years , love it ,!  A fair price as well ,five stars .</li>
    <li> avg making more noise</li>
    <li> You have to be careful with this one, it can clip you and make you bleed easily.</li>
    <li> Not bad...but if you want the best http://amzn.to/1K8KQ4B</li>
    <li> Of all the trimmers that I have ever used , this one is the easiest to clean. It&#x27;s so well designed that there isn&#x27;t any space for hair to get stuck!</li>
    <li> Excellent service. My ítem good the only thing I may observe is that  previous  model included a base for all pieces.</li>
    <li> Does the job nicely. I&#x27;d give 5 star if it had a sleeve.</li>
    <li> I have finally found the right trimmer for me.</li>
    <li> Shaves clean, nice unit.</li>
    <li> My husband seems to like it and he is super picky when it comes to electronics and tools.  I am only giving it a 4 instead of 5 because I wish the heads went on a little more smoothly.  It&#x27;s not bad but could be nicer. No issues with the seller or delivery.</li>
    <li> Watta great product for unbelievable price</li>
    <li> I bought this exclusively for my beard. I used it for the first time the other day and it works great, kept my beard a consistent length all over. Never grabbed any of my hairs instead of cutting, cuts very well. It did loose one star for no carrying bag for the parts and for a semi-cheap plastic used on the depth adjustment. If you are careful with this I am sure it will last for many years.</li>
    <li> Cheaply made design looks good but not easy to use</li>
    <li> A great product for the price. For $15 I really did not expect much of the product. I currently have a battery operated trimmer that does not have the attachment for nose/ear trimming. That trimmer uses AA batteries and seems to eat through them very quickly. There is also a very quick power loss on the battery operated unit. I was figuring this product would be similar in regard to power drop, but I would save in the cost of not having to buy batteries. I was wrong. This unit does not experience a power drop after trimming my beard, chest, and arm pits all in one go. I like to trim my arm pits as it helps my deodorant not to clump up. Due to the unique shape of you arm pit this can sometimes be tricky and painful! This trimmer did it all without any issues. I felt perfectly safe and was not worried and catching some skin in the guard.&lt;br /&gt;The multiple heads make this a nice package. There are many more length settings than what I was expecting. It is very easy to dial in the exact length you want since there are so many options. I&#x27;m really impressed with the run time and lack of a power drop even after the unit has been on and running for several minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only reservations are those that have already been addressed. With all the extra parts a drawstring bag would have been nice. I ended up putting the attachments I don&#x27;t use in a small Rubbermaid along with my old trimmer and its attachments, and refill blades for my razor. So not a big deal for me in the end. The other would be it isn&#x27;t that aesthetic without a base lying on your counter charging, but it was $15 so not that upset in that regard.  Overall great product. Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Okay so come on this ain&#x27;t a beard trimmer.  Let&#x27;s all be honest and say what it&#x27;s amazing at.  Manscaping.  This thing is awesome.  If your going for really short, or just a decent trim it works wonders.  I&#x27;m rocking a awesome batman logo right now and my girl loves it.  Just be careful around the family jewels.  Otherwise your in for a bloodbath.  Happy trimming.</li>
    <li> Better than expected. Way better than your 20$ trimmer you can buy at your local store. The guide are a little bit difficult to use since it&#x27;s not a actual guide you have to  move it to the correct measurement you want, but if you want to keep your beard short, this is the best you can get for the price. No oil needed, self sharp blades. smooth and easy  To shave beard. Recommend this to anyone who just ones to zero or keep your beard short</li>
    <li> This is a neat little item that I suggest every guy keep in their restroom. Cheap and simple, it&#x27;s an easy &amp;#34;all-in-one&amp;#34; groomer for the entire body. With the added length heads, one can use this item to trim EVERYTHING they&#x27;d need to a desired length. I could also see how someone might use this to perhaps even cut their hair, though I&#x27;ve never done so myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very light, but solid in terms of performance. It seems to hold charge nicely- I&#x27;ve yet to have to recharge it since the first time(though I don&#x27;t have a beard that needs trimming, so it&#x27;s use isn&#x27;t nearly that frequent).</li>
    <li> Great little set of Clippers!! Great Price Too!! Definitely recommend this Seller!!</li>
    <li> Serves the purpose well. I hope it lasts.</li>
    <li> works Perfectly and the price I got it at was fantastic to say the least worth every penny</li>
    <li> Best beard trimmer my husband has ever had.  Light, easy to use.  Will have to see if it holds up.  Says it takes 10hrs to fully charge but it will do a quick job with less.</li>
    <li> Looks decent... a bit dangerous though</li>
    <li> not so good and the blade is not that smooth on skin and i cant make a close trim. not met</li>
    <li> My previous two trimmers were both Remington.  The battery failed on my last unit after just a year, so I bought this Norelco.  It has more power than my old Remington, but does not cut very close.  It leaves so much stubble that it is practically useless.  I needed to use the small precision trimmer to get a clean line, but it takes three times as long. I will probably end up buying another Remington, and hoping that it lasts longer than the last one.</li>
    <li> Works fine, does what its supposed to. The only problem is that it can not be used while charging. .</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully! Easy to clean, lots of useful attachments. Easy to store and use. Wonderful product with a wonderful price!</li>
    <li> it has everthing that I needed &amp; more</li>
    <li> Good product and can&#x27;t be beat for the price. A bag or pouch should be included like some of the older Norelco&#x27;s had, even for a couple of bucks more.  Amazon&#x27;s shipping is the best.</li>
    <li> This trimmer - for the price - is a great deal! Easy to use and does a great job keeping my husband&#x27;s gotee looking nice.</li>
    <li> This time i have to mention this product. Saw the rewiew it was good. The trimmer really works fine. But one item does not fit to it.. I don&#x27;t know how to rectify it..</li>
    <li> excellent product! I use it to trim everything including the eyebrows!</li>
    <li> Works well. Good for full body grooming. Had to charge battery several times during grooming, even after I initially charged it for 8+ hours.</li>
    <li> the button that is supposed to adjust it does not work and the Norelco Co gave me the run around.</li>
    <li> This particular model does not come with the attachment designed for hair trimming on your head, but the included beard trimmer attachment set on number 8 has works perfectly on my hair for a nice, even buzz cut that is not too short.  I like the fact that with this trimmer and the included attachments I never really need to pay for hair cuts anymore- and can even do the whole thing myself in less than 5 minutes.  If you can deal with a buzz cut, this is a very economical, and practical solution to personal grooming.  Also, you can keep your hair nicely buzzed on a weekly or even daily basis if you so choose.  This Norelco holds its charge very well and is quite simple to use- with very useful attachments.</li>
    <li> Had the earlier model before, g370&lt;br /&gt;Its better built, but less combinations&lt;br /&gt;Also it would have not pinched Norelco to add a pouch/carry bag with this thing!</li>
    <li> The guards on this trimmer are more comfortable on my face (with rounded corners at the tip instead of a pointy edge), and I like all the different level available, but one major qualm is the battery. That is, I could live with the fact that the battery doesn&#x27;t last more than 5 or so shaves (10 tops), except for the fact that I have no idea when it&#x27;s going to die. And when it dies, it DIES...almost instantly, and let me tell you, you do NOT want it to die while it&#x27;s in the middle of trimming your facial hair. Creiky! So c&#x27;mon guys, gimme a little warning!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What adds to this is the fact that the instructions say not to leave it plugged in, and that you&#x27;re supposed to wait until it dies before charging it, but yet at the same time, you can&#x27;t just run it while plugged in (another downfall) - it has to actually charge. So.....unless you&#x27;re good at laying out a game plan for ending your shave exactly when the battery is about to die, it makes things difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For these reasons, I think 3 stars is a generous rating, but when it&#x27;s running, I like it, and the nose/ear attachment is a welcomed addition.</li>
    <li> Great product. My only gripe is that hair gets inside of the head of the device, and while it doesn&#x27;t impede the functionality of the device, it&#x27;s kind of annoying to me.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend purchasing it just beacuse it&#x27;s so bulky and does not trim well</li>
    <li> Cheapest and totally long lasting worthy product.</li>
    <li> GOOD PRODUCT, GOOD SELLLER!!</li>
    <li> Met expectations, enough said.</li>
    <li> trimmer works great on anything you&#x27;d like to trim the only issue I have you have to take off the guard to  do close trim around mouth or use any of the other trimmer parts. Since this has so many trimmer levels the setting numbers are very big so its easy to set the trimmer on the wrong level - if you&#x27;re normal setting is 4 its easy to be on 3 or 2 with just a quick glance at the setting numbers. Also to change the guard settings al you do is pull or push on the guard so it would be easy to have the guard move if it was bump hard in drawer.</li>
    <li> Been using this for several months, very pleased.  The charge lasts a long time, I mean a really long time.  I don&#x27;t always shave daily but pretty close.  All the attachments work great and are easy to switch out.  I could see where the 2 clear plastic beard guides could break if you were rough with them but under normal use it&#x27;s great.  I am really surprised at the value for my money on this.  I bought a basic little shave bag and now everything is all in once place ready to groom.  Very happy customer.</li>
    <li> Nice product, and cost is reasonable. Shipping is in time. They delivered to india exactly the date what they mentioned.</li>
    <li> I try to maintain a somewhat complicated pattern to my beard.  I have been using another Norelco model for ten years or so and am very pleased with its performance.  So far, this new Norelco is performing very well.  The length-settings are easy to set. The price is great.</li>
    <li> The adjustable guide is hard to adjust/hard to see.  The older model I replaced was of better quality.</li>
    <li> battery lasts for 5 mins even after 10 plus hour of charging</li>
    <li> has 2 cutting heads that fit on opposite sides. The smaller head for precise shaving does not get nearly as close as you would like and same for the large head which makes it hard to have a clean line on my beard using an electric foil shaver. Easy to clean and change attachments is the only plus</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had it for about a year now and it&#x27;s still going strong. I only had to recharge once about 6 months ago. I use it about 3 times a week. It has several heads for different jobs. The nose-hair one is better than my previous one. All the buzzers are fine for face and upper body, but be careful around yer uhhh sensitive areas. It&#x27;ll bite. I&#x27;m still on the lookout for the buzzer that works best &amp;#34;down there&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described and a good delivery time</li>
    <li> This trimmer works great for EVERYTHING! worked well for styling facial hair. It does take a while to charge it and if you run down the battery it won&#x27;t run while plugged in to the wall right away. You will need to leave it charging for a while before you can use it. As long as it is not dead when you need it you can trim right away and it doesn&#x27;t pull any hair, not even on body or sensitive areas but of course always be cautious. I am highly satisfied, I have had this trimmer for about 6 months now and no problems.</li>
    <li> This is a good, but pretty standard trimmer. The product is easy to use it&#x27;s simple to change heads or use the attachments. I needed this mostly for trimming up hair at the back of the neck/sideburns, which requires the precision grooming head. And I a little disappointed in the performance of this attachment. Also, the lack of storage pouch is just annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positives:&lt;br /&gt;Ease of Use&lt;br /&gt;Lots of uses&lt;br /&gt;Nice attachments&lt;br /&gt;Light weight&lt;br /&gt;Good battery life&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives:&lt;br /&gt;Precision grooming head required multiple passes&lt;br /&gt;lack of storage pouch</li>
    <li> Does a great job for trimming after a hair cut or just plucking nose hair.</li>
    <li> VERY GOOD COMAPRING PRICE  WORTH</li>
    <li> replaced my old model and this is better...</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t write many reviews but this is literally the best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever owned. I&#x27;ve owned at least a half dozen of these things in the last 10 years hoping to stumble across a decent one and this is perfect! Have used it everyday for 1 month and the battery is still going strong off of one charge....</li>
    <li> Wonderful Christmas presents.</li>
    <li> Love it so much that I bout my father in law one for Christmas!</li>
    <li> great product....charge holds longer than expected. have had it for over a year without complaints.</li>
    <li> Works like it should.</li>
    <li> Perfect timings for shipping, They said it was boxed and packed(new one), but i found it open. It is really good device though</li>
    <li> This product works great, Also works in the shower really well.Only issue is that it should have a couple more heads.</li>
    <li> Great product works well. Fast delivery I would recommend this product the price is great and the razor works like a champ.</li>
    <li> Great product works well. Fast delivery I would recommend this product the price is great and the razor works like a champ.</li>
    <li> Had a more expensive norelco shaver from walmart and it got a much closer trim, this one isn&#x27;t really satisfactory - but not bad enough to go to trouble of returning it.  If you don&#x27;t care about how close the trim is, no big deal i guess.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my boyfriend as a gift. It looks great for the price and has great results. How long do you keep a shaver anyway, why spend more?</li>
    <li> Everything looks good and works as fine. This is perfect for this pricing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons:- It cuts your skin when you try to trim using it from the base level. So need to be careful when you do that.</li>
    <li> I use this multigroom as a beard trimmer. I really like the guard and 18 different settings it has available for it, which makes it quite easy to fine tune the length you need. I don&#x27;t have particularly dense or thick hair, so I can&#x27;t speak to the robustness of the multigroom, but it works quite well for me.</li>
    <li> Heads hard to change.</li>
    <li> This machine is awesome, it does an excellent job with medium to long beard hairs, I still haven&#x27;t used yet the accessory for head hair but I assume it will be just as good.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I am giving it 4 starts and not 5 is because of its lack of efficiency when it comes to short hairs and the nose hair accessory.&lt;br /&gt;Overall a good buy price/benefit.</li>
    <li> Really good. Works well for what I needed.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, shipping was excellent and I love it.</li>
    <li> Cuts great. Best electric grooming kit I have owned.</li>
    <li> I purchased this just for the purpose of trimming the back of my neck and it works perfectly for that. The charge holds up pretty long and the item is water resistant.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good trimmer that does it&#x27;s job. Seems to hold a charge a long time so far. It would have been nice if they would have designed the package to be used as a stand for all the attachments to sit in.</li>
    <li> I bought this electric razor to replace my husbands favorite razor, that had been broken by our children. He was satisfied with the quality but says that it pulls his hair a little.</li>
    <li> Low price, great product. Arrived as described.</li>
    <li> This item is exactly what I needed. The battery last as long as I need it. It has the power and attachments to do what it says it does. What else can you say, it&#x27;s not magic, it just does what it supposed to do!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just received this product. Best choice for the price. I use it for beard triming and it&#x27;s excelent, fast and powerfull enough. Also, the lenght settings are really precise and give you several options. About battery life, it lasts enough for a beard trimming, nose, etc. It exceeded my expectations.  Update: After using it for two months it still holds the initial charge. I trim my beard twice a week.</li>
    <li> Does the Work Perfectly...</li>
    <li> Delivered fast and is exactly as what description says.</li>
    <li> Strong buzzer and good all-around trimmer.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s like that Guiness commercial. BRILLIANT! Trimmer works wonders on whisker woes and worrisome waves of startling stubble. Just be careful when using it on delicate areas (wink wink). Packaging was nice, battery lasts long, adjuster adjusts and I look at least 44.09856% less homeless. Do recommend highly.</li>
    <li> Works great and I love all of the fittings!  I especially love the nose-hair clipper; this baby is truly pain-free!  It doesn&#x27;t pull on the hairs at all!</li>
    <li> I use this mostly for trimming (but also bought my son one for his beard).  Nice unit, very much worth the price.</li>
    <li> I ended up buying another for dad, since I loved my groomer so much. The unit has great battery life, and cleans up easily with a brush. There is a technique to using the groomer, that you have to find the right angle to go at the hair. But, it is definitely worth the asking price.</li>
    <li> Been using it to shave my face, arms, other places, trim sideburns, the works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works flawlessly in the shower. Multiple heads make it convenient to shape facial hair such as sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charges easy and quick.</li>
    <li> Fair Price, Perfect Performance</li>
    <li> Pretty good item. I use it for below the belt. Just be sure to use the guard, otherwise you&#x27;ll catch skin.</li>
    <li> The clips break soon after a months use</li>
    <li> After a few weeks, it no longer holds a charge.</li>
    <li> I bought this on a whim, intending to use it to keep the hair around and in my ears trimmed.  I liked it so much that I ended up growing a beard so that I could use it more regularly.  Without any experience, I was able to carve out a decent Van Dyke.  It seems to be well made and will probably outlive me.  I can give a hearty recommendation for this trimmer.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have a beard, so I asked my husband what he thought. \\&quot;How many stars should I give it?\\&quot; I asked. \\&quot;Five,\\&quot; he said. \\&quot;Why? I replied. \\&quot;Can&#x27;t see anything wrong with it,\\&quot; said he.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I told him I&#x27;d ordered this contraption, and at first he was skeptical. \\&quot;It only keeps a charge for 35 minutes,\\&quot; he told me. He also expressed reticence about sticking a device with blades inside his nose, which seemed reasonable to me (the reticence, that is).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two days later, he was singing another tune. He loves it. Here&#x27;s some of the other virtues I managed to extract from him: Fits well in the hand. He&#x27;s a lefty, so that&#x27;s something. Lightweight. Make shaving easier. Did a more even and quicker job than any other razor he&#x27;s used. Did a particularly good job of shaving a closely trimmed beard. And lastly, made his nose feel \\&quot;clean.\\&quot; No more nose tweezers for this fellow!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just read this to him and he told me he&#x27;d given me way more details. Oops! Here they are, and they&#x27;re important: \\&quot;The beard trimming length adjustor slides easily with a flick of a thumb and locks into place. One doesn&#x27;t have to change the heads like with barber-style shavers. It&#x27;s much more convenient. The adjustment increments are smaller which makes it versatile.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sounds like six stars to me!</li>
    <li> No problems using it so far. Easy to operate and change functions. Very affordable and better that others I&#x27;ve tried at the same price category.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it for long so I can&#x27;t vouch for the battery life..&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, feels sturdy and it comes with a lot of attachments including a regular trimmer, a detailer, a cover to keep your beard the same length all around, and a nose/ear hair trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;Great buy and very cheap!&lt;br /&gt;Why are you still reading this? Go and order it! You&#x27;re not gonna find a better product for a better price</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for... This thing started off great, then suddenly after 90 days it stopped working. Charging light went on, but nothing... dead.  I&#x27;ve read other reviews with mirrored experiences to mine. Too bad, it was awesome till it quit.  And no, I don&#x27;t have the receipt even though it was only 3 months ago. I guess I don&#x27;t often hang onto a receipt for something if it&#x27;s under $25 or so... just too much hassle for the investment of time to return it.  Plus the frustration of dealing with the interrogation and inferences that you dropped it, or you took it scuba diving - but yes, lesson learned here.  I hope the higher priced units represent higher quality and better value. They do make a good razor for the money... and as with any product, you really do get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Multi Groom is the right word for this little machine. Not only does it do a great job at trimming beards and moustaches, but with the attachments provided I was even able to give myself a very good haircut as well.&lt;br /&gt;The only negative point I have found with it is that you need to wear a barber&#x27;s cloth because the hair flies EVERYWHERE! It is like a hair blizzard, particularly when trimming beards because the clippings are so fine. Most o9 the attachments have a large range of length adjustment so you can cut your hairs to just the length you want them to be, no matter where on your body you are doing it. Ladies can shav their legs and underarms and men can shave hair anyplace on their bodies it grows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing it won&#x27;t do is completely cut the hair so after you trim down your beard, you still nead a shaver to get a smooth skin with no stubble. If it could do that last thing you would be able to do away with all other hair cutting equipment.</li>
    <li> I fretted over which razer to get for a while, I&#x27;m so glad I got this one. It&#x27;s great for the face and sensitive areas with guards and doesn&#x27;t leave my neck with little bumps. I&#x27;d highly recommend it. I haven&#x27;t used the nose trimmer yet, but other than that I can say it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had it for about a year now and it&#x27;s still going strong.  I only had to recharge once about 6 months ago.  I use it about 3 times a week.  It has several heads for different jobs.  The nose-hair one is better than my previous one.  All the buzzers are fine for face and upper body, but be careful around yer...  uhhh...  sensitive areas.  It&#x27;ll bite.  I&#x27;m still on the lookout for the buzzer that works best &amp;#34;down there&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this razor.  It&#x27;s lightweight yet sturdy for trimming my scruff and buzzing my head.  I&#x27;m tempted to buy another one as a back up.</li>
    <li> Leaves patches. Seems like the blades are too springlike and how matter how hard I push against my skin, spots of near baldness appear</li>
    <li> works great, but can&#x27;t use plugged in. Have to remember to charge it before use, annoying some days that it can&#x27;t be plugged in to finish grooming. Otherwise I would give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Not for everyone, should be used in a doctors office to draw blood for an exam. Returned after first use.</li>
    <li> Works well.  It cost a little bit more than a trimmer operated by a single AA battery but it has much more power.  The attachments are all useful.  It&#x27;s a little difficult to set the length when using the guards but it appears to be secure and reproducible.  I&#x27;ve reached an age where hair appears in places I never imagined hair could grow.  I hate to admit needing a device like this, but there it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  Can&#x27;t use it on ac power when the batteries are dead.  The charger doesn&#x27;t shut off automatically.  It doesn&#x27;t have a case so I dug up a small drawer bin we had around the house to hold the trimmer and attachments.  At this price I&#x27;m willing to make sacrifices.</li>
    <li> Lots of versatility in a very affordable trimmer.</li>
    <li> I very much like this trimmer so far. Only complain is that the trimmer guards are kind of flimsy. I can see these breaking easy. Everything else is performing as advertised so far. Holds a good charge. Water proof. All attachments go on and off easily.</li>
    <li> Makes for great gift.</li>
    <li> Plenty of power, easy to use and clean.  All at a discount price.  I love it.</li>
    <li> if you use the trimmer attachment and don&#x27;t use it at the right angle it will take all the hair off your bears, first time I used it I looked like i had radiation burns on my face with all the bald spots.</li>
    <li> great trimmer especially for the price!</li>
    <li> Four stars cause it doesn&#x27;t shave very clean</li>
    <li> So far so good. Many options for beard length which I like. Cuts very efficiently. Have only used a few times so I can&#x27;t comment on reliability but hope it holds up because I like the trimmer.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use, very efficient, very good instructions. Don&#x27;t know why I ever bought anything but Philips Norelco ?</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good in waterproof  and quality。&lt;br /&gt;I like it very much。&lt;br /&gt;Moreover，it&#x27;s cheap than that in China.&lt;br /&gt;and I have introduced it to my friends.</li>
    <li> We got this to replace his old one that broke.  Good product and timely shipping.  Attachments very helpful and good for keeping the beard tidy.</li>
    <li> Bought it because it resembled my Phillips Arcitect shaver. Considering the price, I was amazed at the quality and performance of this groomer. Having had a beard and mustache for more than 50 years, it is the most versatile grromer I have owned.</li>
    <li> A Good one. The only problem is that the charging time is too large compared to the working time</li>
    <li> Amazing for the price! Device and accessories feel high quality. I charged mine as the instructions asked, and haven&#x27;t had to charge since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind that the &amp;#34;case&amp;#34; that it comes in can be what you sit the trimmer and accessories inside of. And it&#x27;s a nice red!</li>
    <li> Great product for the price. Has very dynamic blades that are incredibly smooth. Definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a grooming kit!</li>
    <li> Already lost most of the pieces. Started nicking me pretty bad after just a few weeks of use. To be fair, I am an alligator.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t give many 5 star reviews but this item nearly got the 5th star. Everything about this trimmer is exactly what I was looking for. The battery life is excellent. The motor is powerful enough. And the price is nearly unbeatable.</li>
    <li> Great price fast delivery</li>
    <li> Works as intended. No snagging or pulling of hair. Keeps charge for a very long time.</li>
    <li> Its Ok,  it cuts and trims hair.  I will use it until I need another.  But I will probably not buy this model again.  The trimmer guards are a bit flimsy.</li>
    <li> At 1st I thought this trimmer was amazing. I used it 3x and then decided to shave my beard off. I stored the trimmer back in box it came in and put it away. Well I decided I hated the shaved face look and decided to grow the beard back. I took out the trimmers again to used them. I let them charge really well before using them and it doesn&#x27;t even stay charged for 10 secs. At 1st I thought it was the outlet in my bathroom so I charged it in other outlets in the house. This trimmer still doesn&#x27;t stay on for more than 10 secs. Not happy at all.  Update: 5/15/2015: I was also upset because I thought this vendor sold me a defected product. So I went on Walmart&#x27;s website and bought the same trimmer because I did like it when it worked. Low and behold it&#x27;s doing it too... So I guess it wasn&#x27;t the vender on Amazon that sold this crap!! It was Philips Norelco... Highly Upset!!!</li>
    <li> Great machine for the price.</li>
    <li> Summary: Given a second chance, I would probably choose something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Battery holds good charge&lt;br /&gt;Reliable Philips brand&lt;br /&gt;Well constructed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The attachments are completely useless. I never find them to cut as much as I&#x27;d like despite starting with the largest number and slowly tapering down. It always seems to give me an uneven trim on my beard. I generally use it on my face and a few times now I was so unhappy with the uneven result that I ended up just shaving. I used it once to give myself a buzz cut and the result was no different - uneven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a bad product, just wish the attachments were better. I liked the attachments on my old ConAir better but it had the worst battery life.</li>
    <li> The attachments work well, but the guards are garbage.  I don&#x27;t use them at all, ever.  I still keep it around for the nose trimmer.</li>
    <li> Easy to use.  Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had other trimmers that would change lengths way too easily.  This trimmer doesn&#x27;t change while using it, so it&#x27;s great.  The trimmer can be used while plugged in, which others can&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nose trimmer (yeah, I&#x27;m an old man), doesn&#x27;t work as well as I had hoped.. or, I don&#x27;t use it right (huh?), but, all in all, it&#x27;s a great trimmer</li>
    <li> The nose trimmer was okay.</li>
    <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to and I shaved money by ordering it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Very love. In terms of price or use are very good</li>
    <li> This is a very good trimmer for hair and body hair (if that&#x27;s what you need). The nose/ear trimmer seems pretty good, although it&#x27;s hard to tell. The build quality is good and better than other trimmers I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
    <li> this is a good kit. our son has real thick hair and it works good.</li>
    <li> This model doesn&#x27;t work for head it&#x27;s only for grooming.</li>
    <li> does the job but here are the downfalls:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;does not have a charge indicator&lt;br /&gt;--you cannot tell when it&#x27;s charged or running low&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;has a crappy &#x27;length&#x27; indicator&lt;br /&gt;--the movement of the guard up or down, which dictates the length of cut, is really microscopic and pointless.&lt;br /&gt;--sometimes I have eyebrows.  sometimes I don&#x27;t.  I&#x27;m kidding but you get what I mean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;otherwise, it&#x27;s cool.  just barely.&lt;br /&gt;get one with a charge indicator and a proper (easy to set) length indicator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and you won&#x27;t run around without eyebrows like I did.&lt;br /&gt;j/k.  sounded good!</li>
    <li> very basic trimmer that could be used for acceptable (not great nor easy) buzz cuts, defines hair lines well and trims stubble very neatly. battery life is great.</li>
    <li> I DID NOT ORDER THE SYLVANIA BULBS , I DID NOT THEM. VBS</li>
    <li> Will work fine for beards, but doesn&#x27;t include a close-shaving tool. The various heads are hard to put on correctly but only go on one way. Doesn&#x27;t come with any way to organize the included equipment (tray / bag / etc).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, the battery seems to last a very long time</li>
    <li> No complaints, Good product.</li>
    <li> Great value,better than I expected.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t ask for a better product. I&#x27;ve owned this thing for over a year and have put it through heavy use. I live overseas and it has handled every unstable voltage surge and drop that Africa has thrown at it. I use it about 2 times a week to trim my face, and about once a week to shave my entire head. It will go insanely long on a single charge incase you forget your charger at home on a vacation. Fantastic little thing - when this one dies, I&#x27;ll simply buy another one.</li>
    <li> I will be returning this soon. It was bought to help my 16 year old son, but the shaving blade is dull. I had to try several times.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm. 10 bucks cheaper here than the stores.</li>
    <li> For sure! This product arrived before my expectations.</li>
    <li> moves with my face  many diff settings and price was way better than store</li>
    <li> A+ Great product and package and i will buy again soon in best condition thanks for all my friend  :DGreat product  and i will buy again soon :D</li>
    <li> Amazing product. Does what it specifies. The battery easily lasts for more than 30min.&lt;br /&gt;However am not able to use this while i plug in at zer battery charge but a great product nevertheless</li>
    <li> its working very well and its very economical, infact it has every thing you needed like the battery and the cord if you want to use through electricity and best of all it takes very less to charge &amp; its very fast in trimming, thank you philips</li>
    <li> The Philips Norelco Multigroom is a very good value.  It fills my needs very well and has my recommendation.</li>
    <li> the machine works perfect and of good quality thanks seller</li>
    <li> An easy to use good product which is slick and sturdy at the same time. Great price as well! Will recommend buying if you are looking for a trimmer.</li>
    <li> Works great! It&#x27;s just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Nice razor for what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I love it, cheap, effective or the same: a very great item</li>
    <li> Shaver was supposed to be a Christmas present, but several items were missing from the box, including one of the shaver attachments, and the bag itself that keeps all of the attachments together. While the shaver does the job, its a disappointment not having a complete set.</li>
    <li> Is actually better than I expected. Well constructed and the heads interchange easily. Battery lasts for a couple weeks at least of me  beard trimming daily.Wish it had a storage bag but a $2 large pencil case works fine.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband  for christmas , and he is very happy with it.</li>
    <li> This trimmer works exactly as described.  My only complaint is the way the attachments go onto and off of the trimmer.  I sometimes need to fiddle with it because they basically thread on but I usually don&#x27;t get it oriented correctly the first time. Also it seems like a lot of hair gets stuck inside the trimmer.  So far though there have been no issues with its function and the trimmer head adjustment works great.  I trim my beard once a week and I have only charged it twice in four months.</li>
    <li> Good product for the price</li>
    <li> Just wish it would have a battery charge indicator on the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m always wondering how much charge is left, but it hasn&#x27;t been a problem.</li>
    <li> Just as described in product description. Wish it had a stand or case to keep all the loose pieces.</li>
    <li> Its a good item but not for me. Its a gift for my best friend. Hope it works well and he likes it.</li>
    <li> It&#x60;s so good and work perfectly, easy to use  also you can wash in to water. Norecolo has 5 different headset And all thes only 18 $ with shipping, I dont know whay people spent mor money with other machine.&lt;br /&gt;PS. Sorry for my bad english ;) ;) ;)</li>
    <li> i bought this product as one of the guards on my norelco g370 had broken and figured THIS multigroom would be their new, comparable model. so my review will be a comparison of the g370 vs qg3330.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- qg33330 is lighter weight than the g370, thus giving it that cheap feel that some people have mentioned&lt;br /&gt;- qg33330 has no foil razor like the g370, but you know this when buying the product&lt;br /&gt;- qg33330 has more length settings than g370, which i liked&lt;br /&gt;- qg33330 head tilts the opposite way of the g370, position in your hand when trimming will take some getting used to&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;not a comparison&lt;br /&gt;- stubble guard on qg3330 is different than any guard i have used before as it does not going around the trimmer all the may, therefore making it very easy to mess up and cut way too close. you&#x27;ll need to hold it a certain way and it took me some time to get used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;havent had the qg3330 all that long and it will take some getting used to as i have been using g370s for a very long time, but seems like a very comparable product.</li>
    <li> The plastic head on this is made with thinker material to prevent breaking. My old groomer had the plastic comb attachment break.</li>
    <li> has all the accessories you need. Can use cordless or plugged in. Quality is much better than a more expensive one (forget the brand but it was a big name razor company) that I bought to replace it. For the money, I wasn&#x27;t expecting something decent.</li>
    <li> Works very well. Perfect for sculpting beards,stache, and stubble. Great for man scaling of any kind. Worth the money and it is a great price</li>
    <li> Got this for a good price and it has been able to work whenever I need to use it. I have not charged this product since I bought it and it is still working well.</li>
    <li> Works great and is very versatile.  Good to keep you hair cut spruced up in between  hair cuts.  The unit is very loud!</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Got it for hubby after no shave November, he liked it but not the idea of shaving....</li>
    <li> Excelente producto !!!</li>
    <li> Perfectly designed and superb comfort in using must take this</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like it at first but I actually like it and find myself trimming once a week. Still going strong and I bought this a while ago.</li>
    <li> Good battery life, and precise trimmer!</li>
    <li> This thing is sweet!!! And the price is unbeatable!</li>
    <li> For the price, it&#x27;s great, however the closer shave add-on doesn&#x27;t seem to shave off the hair as much as I&#x27;d have to go over the spot over and over again. It nicked one of the very sensitive parts on my body and had a very minor cut with a splotch of blood, so next time I&#x27;m using a different shaver for those areas. The other extensions were great so far though for a great trim and for the price it&#x27;s completely worth it.</li>
    <li> Excellent Product better than I imagined.  Very Useful</li>
    <li> Nice shave! it&#x27;s easy to used and very helpful in keeping the beard cleanly trimmed!</li>
    <li> Have used the trimmer for two months now. Trims neat and close, cutting the mustache hair instead of my upper lip like my previous Wahl 9916!</li>
    <li> Tight, well-fitting design.  It does everything advertised.  A good buy.</li>
    <li> Not a fan of this at all, the plastic guards do not completely cover the blade as shown in the pictures so it makes beard grooming or hair cutting impossible. besides that guards i do like the quality, the charge time, and the power of this. i now only use this as a shaver with no guard on it to get the back of my neck</li>
    <li> My new favorite beard trimmer! Phillips never seems to disappoint! Its sharp, versatile, and exactly what I needed. The 4 attachments are very convenient. The only thing i&#x27;m worried about is the durability of the 2 trimming attachments. They are very flexible and don&#x27;t look like they will last very long. They sound like they&#x27;re gonna break when adjusting the length. And another thing is that the plastic packaging was extremely difficult to open. But overall great product.</li>
    <li> Pretty powerfull.Cuts fast and thorough.</li>
    <li> Product as described and works very well!!</li>
    <li> The product is pretty good,not as sharp as expected but worth the money.</li>
    <li> Excellent multi Purpose Trimmer with sturdy Built.</li>
    <li> Works great. I used it straight out of the box. I shaved of my beard,shaped my mustache then I trimmed of all my arm pit hair away. :D you should get this if your watching this review.</li>
    <li> I was looking to replace my old norelco that lasted me more than 10 years, but whose battery was going. I bought two other brands lured by the fancy accessories or features, but none cut like the norelco. The attachments stay in place and it looks like it can be rinsed off without frying the battery.</li>
    <li> It is compact, but it is powerful. It really works.</li>
    <li> Works perfect for beard. Hair cutting lacks power. Even so, excellent product.</li>
    <li> excellent product and delivery on time</li>
    <li> This is a piece of junk. Not built to last</li>
    <li> This thing is awesome. Going from razors and razor burn to this beauty is quite literally life changing. And for the majority of you looking for a beard (pube) trimmer, i wouldnt do it any other way. It even has its only little attachment for &amp;#34;precision&amp;#34;. Well worth the fee.</li>
    <li> Good shaver for the price. Works well above the waist and below and doesn&#x27;t grab or rip out any hairs.. will update later if battery is an issue.</li>
    <li> a steal at this price - works better than expected</li>
    <li> This thing works great.  Just be wary, one of the guards is kind of flimsy and if you&#x27;re not careful, you&#x27;ll shave your hair alot shorter than you mean to!  Use it mainly as a beard trimmer</li>
    <li> The groomer is of good quality and feels solid in my hand.  There is one attachment that was not included that I need, a trimmer for getting under the nose and for close up on ears too.  Shhh, I&#x27;m getting old I&#x27;ve got hair in bizarre places..</li>
    <li> easy to use and a good value</li>
    <li> does everything I need it to do. good price for a good trimmer.</li>
    <li> excellent trimmer got it for my brother for xmas..he loved it.</li>
    <li> Takes 10 hours to charge, but I was in no rush. It&#x27;s supposed last some 35 minutes; I&#x27;m rather new to clippers and these clippers still had juice by the time I finished figuring out a full head/beard trim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Product paid itself off with the first haircut / beard trim I gave.&lt;br /&gt;- Very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;- Attachments clearly numbered for hair and beard length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- A little difficult to clean hair from inside two of the attachments.&lt;br /&gt;- Motor sounded funny a few times during cut - easily shook out some of the hair and it was fine.</li>
    <li> Bought two of them, one for husband and one for son, both of them like very much</li>
    <li> Husband loves this.  Great price, too!</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s really not much to say, it works great, all of the different attachments are great for different styles. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> By far the worst beard trimmer I have ever owned.</li>
    <li> The groomer+attachments works great but the trimmer doesn&#x27;t cut at all, I have to use my electric shaver to trim.  If you&#x27;re expecting super-close stubble you won&#x27;t get it here but for a nice manageable beard this was worth the price.  Nose hair trimmer works pretty well.</li>
    <li> This Norelco groomer meets the needs of my husband.  It is easy for me to use and not complicated at all to assemble.&lt;br /&gt;I like it&#x27;s size and very easy to hold. I am anticipating many years of service.  I would recommend this to others.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a Philips beard trimmer I had before (a Philips G370) that I loved and was extremely reliable.  I was disappointed that this one was designed so poorly in comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main grip I have is that whoever designed the 12-setting stubble guard for this thing needs to go back to engineering school.  The guard does NOT completely cover and wrap around the blade head.  This causes two enormous problems.  One, if you apply too much pressure while using it, the guard flexes, temporarily allowing it to get closer to your face and causing patchiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second problem, however, is just mind-boggling in its stupidity.  Because the stubble guard doesn&#x27;t completely wrap around the blade head and leaves it exposed, if you tilt it at the wrong angle, the full unguarded blade head can easily come into contact with your face, essentially shaving you at a 0 according to the blade settings.  Unless you have the hands of world class surgeon, you&#x27;re GOING to occasionally tilt the trimmer a little, causing the unguarded blade to come into contact with your face and ruining whatever length your were trying for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t speak to the beard guard, because I don&#x27;t keep my beard long enough to utilize it.  But if you&#x27;re planning on using this thing for any kind of short beard or stubble work, don&#x27;t bother.  It cannot be used that way because of the poorly designed stubble guard.  You WILL simply end up with a patchy face.</li>
    <li> Great for the price. Can get a little clogged with curly long beards, but a few goes and it works like a charm. The nose hair trimmer and detail trimmer are a nice touch, enough to get prepped for an amateur beard competition ;)</li>
    <li> As far as beards go, a ten dollar Wahl without guards gets much closer than this trimmer.  Because of its gentle appearance and the previous statistic, I thought it safe to use on the more tender regions of my body.  DO NOT buy this with the intention of using it anywhere other than your face, it was a bloodbath.</li>
    <li> Closer shave than the previous model, definitely an improvement.  Battery output seems more consistent also.</li>
    <li> Update 6/22/2015 I liked this product. It stopped charging after 8 months. I only used to lightly trim my beard. I was hoping it would last longer. I had it at 5 stars and I am reducing to 4. Eight months seems like a short life span with very light use.   Easy to use and trims the beard quickly and effeciently. The number of acessories is perfect for guys just wanting to get the job done. I hope it lasts a long time because I like the way it works. The different clips are easy to put on and take off so you can get the trim you want.</li>
    <li> Terrible product, cheap quality, bad service</li>
    <li> This product came in excellent conditions, but it didn&#x27;t came with the nose shaver.</li>
    <li> It is a must to have grooming kit for men. I had one for almost 3 years now and purchasing this for my dad. Also does a far better job for the cost.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this purchase. I bought it for my chest hair removal</li>
    <li> Not as powerful as I would like, I used to have the older model, and it seemed to do a much better job.</li>
    <li> not as good as the older model I had, but it works OK.</li>
    <li> kind of clunky and the attachements are not easy to use.... it also does not come with a base to place all the attachments and the main electric razor... made a mistake on this buy.</li>
    <li> Nice trimmer for the price. I had another Philips earlier, which was with much better quality, but I guess this is a good one for the price you pay. Simply it does the joob.</li>
    <li> My body hair has never been more well-manicured! Doesn&#x27;t work well on the face, though. Seems to charge quickly and stay charged for a long while. For the money, it was a great purchase!</li>
    <li> didnt like the nose trim didnt do the job</li>
    <li> This works really well.</li>
    <li> We use it for hair cut, and keep under control my husband&#x27;s eyebrows and body hair. So far, so good.</li>
    <li> Cheap. Spend a bit more for a better product!</li>
    <li> This product worked as I expected it to. Doesn&#x27;t appear cheap and is a fairly sturdy design. For the price, this is certainly a good buy.</li>
    <li> Great value I use it for Neck and Body trimming, side-burn trimming and for nose hairs. It was about the same cost as dedicated nose hair trimmers with a lot of extra features. I rarely charge it but have never run the battery down. I was very surprised that this worked so well for such a low price. I have been using it daily for about a year.  If it broke I would buy another one right away  Update   I have been using the spray on the blades especially the Nose Hair trimmer and it seems to keep them moving well I have also used 3-1 oil in the past just a very small amount.  http://www.amazon.com/Norelco-Philips-HQ110-Cleaner-Lubricant/dp/B001DFVJU6/ref&#x3D;sr_1_cc_1?s&#x3D;aps&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1426331782&amp;sr&#x3D;1-1-catcorr&amp;keywords&#x3D;norelco+spray</li>
    <li> Best thing I bought in Amazon</li>
    <li> Long battery life nice shaving , I love it</li>
    <li> Worth alot more than price !!</li>
    <li> Works like a charm. too bad it doesn&#x27;t come with a case of some sort.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband and he loves it!!!!</li>
    <li> It did job for two three cuts but later charging cord was broke.</li>
    <li> great value for money!&lt;br /&gt;Works well</li>
    <li> My husband really likes this, is well worth the cost.</li>
    <li> Christmas gift for my son and he loves it.</li>
    <li> Does the job! Great product.</li>
    <li> Cheap, affordable grooming kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t believe I went this long without purchasing a personal one.</li>
    <li> For this price this is a good product. The plastic feels a bit cheap but the instrument serves the purpose to a certain level. Good enough for me and value for money.</li>
    <li> A lot of flexibility for varying lengths. Comfortable in the hand. Bought one for both me and my college age son. He uses it instead of shaving. Strong cutting power. Ear and nose trimmer works well.</li>
    <li> Works well, easy to use, holds a charge.  Good value for the money.</li>
    <li> Admittedly I have a few devices that help me contain the forest of hair growing on my body.  This is just one of them.  I needed something to help trim eyebrows, nose hair, ear hair, etc.  You get the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works great.  I&#x27;ve used it 15-20 times already and recharged it only once.  This thing fits a need that my other trimmers don&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s not meant to remove tons of hair all at once.  It&#x27;s a more precision based trimmer.  Frankly, it&#x27;s a major upgrade to my el cheapo one I bought at CVS in a hurry.</li>
    <li> Should have a stand like the old model</li>
    <li> useless after you go through the first charge.  After an entire night of charging, it can&#x27;t run longer than 5 seconds. And you cant use it while plugged in either.  Never again</li>
    <li> I was using a Remington full body trimmer and groomer and with the default attachment on this Norelco I was able to cut my shave time down. It came charged enough for me to get a nice lengthy 5 to 10 minute shave in. I did not like that there was no stand or bag to stow the accessories in. My old Remington would pinch me quite a bit and this norelco is much superior, it literally just glided over my face smoothly. The nose trimmer worked much better than I had expected. For the price on this model, somewhere around 16 to 20 dollars, you really can&#x27;t beat it. You can definitely tell that it was built and designed better than other trimmer and groomer models in the same price range. The motor seems faster and more powerful than my previous remington, however, the hair does seem to fly everywhere and there is no capture area on these style of trimmers that have the interchangeable heads.</li>
    <li> Very good quality and with excellent price. it comes with all the accessories which is great for all the different requirements.&lt;br /&gt;The battery is also good, I have already used more than 5 times without charging.</li>
    <li> great value for money.&lt;br /&gt;would be cool if had a bag or something to store the combs and pieces ...</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, it&#x27;s mostly cons on this one:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&lt;br /&gt;Inexpensive&lt;br /&gt;Gets the job done&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&lt;br /&gt;Battery life is bad.&lt;br /&gt;Hair gets everywhere including inside the detachables&lt;br /&gt;The combs/guards don&#x27;t snap on very smoothly to the trimmer&lt;br /&gt;Loud&lt;br /&gt;Shaky</li>
    <li> Works great does a great job on my beard and trimming it</li>
    <li> Quit working after the third use. Kind of expected more from Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;Was fine the first two times; third time it just slowly ran out of power despite being plugged in and the blades clear, and then stopped. And now does the same thing every time I plug it in. What a waste &#x3D;/</li>
    <li> Excelente product, powerful, useful, but shave perfect skintop</li>
    <li> Great item, fast shipping.</li>
    <li> The shaver worked fine as it should...thank you</li>
    <li> Was a replacement for one that we damaged.  Good as ever.</li>
    <li> Small battery capacity, constantly recharging</li>
    <li> great product for hair and beard.</li>
    <li> Like it.....👍👍👌👌 it was actually something he was able to useI had gotten him something else and he wasn&#x27;t able to use and it was too late to returnso we just sit under my drawer</li>
    <li> Perfect Beard and Mustache trimmer with an ear and nostril hair trimmer attachment</li>
    <li> buy it now!!!!don&#x27;t waste your time or money looking for another one! just buy !!!</li>
    <li> The Norelco model I had before I had for like 10 years before the battery finally stopped charging. Unfortunately you can only use the charger while not plugged in like the previous model I owned but this one has a lot more options for length and a nose trimmer. This does exactly what I need it to for the frequency with which I use it. Would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> efficient and easy to use</li>
    <li> Good quality thank you I like it</li>
    <li> Very handy and useful. It is compact and easy to take when travelling, so I can stay well groomed abroad too. It works on head hair, facial hair, nose hair... just about any hair!</li>
    <li> Works well.  Son says it is easy to use and much better than what came with his razor. Anything that gets my teen son to shave on a regular basis is worth 5 stars in my book!</li>
    <li> Not quite as good as some of the older Norelco trimers i have owned.  This one has fewer adapters and the mechanism to change them is also a bit awkward...</li>
    <li> Great battery life - I&#x27;ve had this for almost a year and I think I&#x27;ve only charged it 3 or 4 times (I use on my beard once a week and &amp;#34;other places&amp;#34; every few weeks - cleaned in between!). The attachments are good and it feels comfortable to use.</li>
    <li> excellent, very cheap for what it is.</li>
    <li> The pouch and brush was missing.</li>
    <li> Great product... I bought one more for my brother !!!</li>
    <li> This is a great trimmer for a great price.  It&#x27;s also versatile.  Here are my favorite features:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*  You can use it either cordless (up to 35 minutes they say) or by plugging in.  The latter option is actually a good feature.  Some other cordless trimmers of this kind CANNOT be used plugged in, which is really annoying when you find your trimmer out of batteries and need it in a pinch.  So kudos to Philips for thinking it through and allowing use while it&#x27;s plugged in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*  The extra blades work well.  I mainly use the standard width blade, but the wider one works for shaving the head (believe it or not) and the thinner one is good for detailing.  Used the nose trimmer once and it was fine (I hate nose trimmers).  The blades are easy to remove and attach; the only problem is that you have to find a place to store them without creating clutter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*  The plastic attachments (which determine blade height) work as advertised, but you need to make sure you don&#x27;t accidentally compress the button that lets it slide to a different setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*  It&#x27;s pretty quiet overall and seems to charge fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*  It works on the head.  I know I said this briefly above, but it deserves a bit more mention.  I took an older version of this same trimmer on a trip with me to England because my normal hair clippers could not operate on British power outlets.  (Yes, I cut my own hair; yes, I&#x27;m damn good at it.)  This Philips Norelco is compatible with the full range of voltage and thus can be used in Europe or Asia as well as North America without problems; all you need is an outlet adapter (*not* converter).  In short, this thing did a great job on my hair.  And if a multi-groomer can give a white-collar guy a passable haircut, it must be pretty good.</li>
    <li> Awesome quality for the price. Highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only complaint would be that it is for precision not for speed. So when you are doing your neck line, it takes a couple more strokes to make sure you get all the straggler hairs. But for shaping and touch ups: amazing job.</li>
    <li> The trimmer is very well worth it for the price. It comes with multiple attachments which are good for trimming,shaping or lining up. Definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> Worth buying.Loved it.Has all kinda uses.&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping from amazon.</li>
    <li> It is hard to believe the Philips could offer a high quality and versatile trimmer at such a low price point but the Philips Norelco QQ3330/42 Multi-Groom does the trick.  It comes with a full size trimmer with attachments for nose ear &amp; eyebrow trimmer, beard and mustache comb, stubble comb, and precision trimmer.  All work well with the only downside the lack of a bag for the attachments.  You can wash it with water (unplugged, of course) and when powered with a cord, it also charges the trimmer for cordless use.  Yes I am sure there are better trimmers out there if you would like to spend much more money, but this does just about everything you need at a lower price than less capable devices.  For efficiency, versatility, and price, the Philips Norelco QQ3330/42 Multi-Groom is hard to beat.</li>
    <li> Good product at this price. I&#x27;m satisfied!!</li>
    <li> The exchangeable heads are not easy to put on. This is bad, especially when I am short on time in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to resort back to the old model I much preferred: the Norelco G370. The QG3330 was a waste.</li>
    <li> its very weak and it doesnt give a close trim, i promise its the worst trmmer ive ever had , used it once and put it away, i didnt want to go threw the proccess of returnng it.</li>
    <li> Well i got this to replace a g370 model that i think is pretty good and would buy it again even though it lacks in a few areas.&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion I think the build quality is better on this compared to the g370. the heads are locked down better and the beard combs also connect better unlike the g370 combs which had tiny bit of play. The only thing missing is the Micro shaver which i kind of miss. The power switch feels sturdy you just slide it up. I handled the plus model of this and the button doesn&#x27;t feel as sturdy which in general makes the unit feel less.  Its just a perception i think but none the less it happens. This one seems sturdier just on the fact the switch has no play and feels solid when you slide it up to power on the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I would buy this again if i had to but i would rather the g370 at the same price point just because of the micro shaver being included and the hair comb. i am going to pick up the higher end model of this though which has it. I would also like to point out the Precision trimmer is a bit awkward at first but you pick up on it quick. The precision trimmer head points in the opposite direction of the regular trimmer head. I don&#x27;t know why they did that and i feel like it wasn&#x27;t really necessary and a poor engineering choice. So this thing is missing the Micro shaver and little bag or something to hold all the pieces. Also doesn&#x27;t feature a hair comb. Just the beard and goatee comb.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just the trimmer/shaver for men that any facial hair.  I change the way I trim my beard often and this shaver makes that easy to do.</li>
    <li> My gf boutght me this and it has been really great , fits my needs and now i save time,, recommended</li>
    <li> I like to trim my spider monkey with it, but he likes to throw bananas at me when I do</li>
    <li> Nice for Hair Styling&lt;br /&gt;Handy and compact</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used really cheap electric shavers in the past and they&#x27;re usually awful. I have a more expensive shaver, but it doesn&#x27;t have any trim length options. I got this just for that, and it works incredibly well. Compares to the trimmer on my ~$150 shaver, but with more trim options.</li>
    <li> Decent trimmer at a decent price. Holds a charge well.</li>
    <li> fast delivery--accurate product</li>
    <li> Plastic pieces are worthless and don&#x27;t fit.</li>
    <li> I bought 3 of them as gifts. All of my frnds love it. Working fine till now.</li>
    <li> Especially guys sometimes go too long without a haircut because of money or time, or maybe we just haven&#x27;t found a barber we like, and if we already have short hair there&#x27;s really no regret in trying to give ourselves haircuts because it will grow back in a very short time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this especially between haircuts, when I&#x27;m not ready for the pro, but the hair around my ears is making me look ragged.  Of course, I can also hand it over to my wife just to give me a quick trim and neaten me up a bit. It&#x27;s also really great with the attachments that allow you to trim one, consistant length or height.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, so why four instead of five stars.  Comfort.  This is a fairly powerful piece of hardware.  It wont cut you, but without the attachments you definitely feel like you&#x27;re using an old disposable shaving razor which should have been displosed of long ago.  You also would be making a mistake if you thought this was a good trimmer to use on body hair for the same reason, but Norelco does make really excellent electric body shavers--one of which I own and use regularly because I&#x27;m a cyclist.</li>
    <li> It is difficult to clean it, as the product does not have any additional item that cleans off hair particles which appear on the machine.</li>
    <li> Possibly the worst groomer I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this product twice, the teeth jammed up and I had to clean, scrub and oil it as if I had used it for months. I don&#x27;t know why, but it took chunks out of the skin on my chin as well, on more than one occasion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The grooming guards are awkward and when I trimmed my beard, it was extremely uneven and i had to buy another groomer to correct the problem. The nose trimmer doesn&#x27;t work well at all either. In short, I threw this product in the garbage after a week of trying to make it work. Do not waste your money.</li>
    <li> Works great. Not crazy about how you have to take off the shield to swap out the trimmer.</li>
    <li> Works well and, thus far, holds a charge great. The only bad thing is that one of the guards is basically useless but the other ones work great.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my ancient G270.  I&#x27;m more than impressed..</li>
    <li> -does not trim all the hair&lt;br /&gt;-works only 1 hour continuously&lt;br /&gt;-no low battery warning- just slows down and suddenly stops&lt;br /&gt;-you cannot open it to clean it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+price&lt;br /&gt;+it works&lt;br /&gt;+different heads&lt;br /&gt;+water resistant: during shower</li>
    <li> this is the perfect one for men, no need to hundreds of dollars on trimmers, i suggest this as the perfect one.</li>
    <li> Best grooming set ever!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve needed a new trimmer for awhile now, and this one works great. I love the nose hair attachment because I&#x27;ve been having some issues in that department. I also like the way the trimmer cuts my facial hair without any razor burn. Plus, this model has a charger, so I no longer have to buy batteries.</li>
    <li> Wish it had a case or bag</li>
    <li> This works good and holds a charge for many days</li>
    <li> I use this almost every time I need to shave my beard. Easy to use and the charge stays for a while.</li>
    <li> My husband was very disappointed with the performance of this groomer. One of his major concerns was that he could not achieve a smooth look using one or more of the various attachments. He had to keep reverting back to his old groomer make corrections (if possible). Thankfully he chose to experiment with this product during an extended vacation at home and so there were no embarrassing encounters at work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other problem with this product is that if you did have a favorable experience, there are all of these various attachments laying all over the place when it would have been just as easy to provide a small, faux leather pouch to put everything inside. Certainly would make it more convenient for men who travel.</li>
    <li> Best product i have ever used. No issues till now. I recommend this.</li>
    <li> Great product for the money.  Lots of attachments and does the job! I highly recommend</li>
    <li> Works great and easy to figure out.  Charge last a long time after initial charge.</li>
    <li> fewer trips to barber</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work after few weeks. I have returned and taken same piece still having issue. Not recommend this</li>
    <li> Wish it had some means of keeping all the attachments in one place. Also would like a stand to set the handle in while charging like my last one had.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for me a Month ago and now I bought one for my brother, the quality is good, and it has a good price.</li>
    <li> Aside from it missing a foil trimmer head attachment, this is a perfect multigroom tool for me. I&#x27;ll keep my old one in tandem with this for buzzing down facial hair around the nose and lips.</li>
    <li> Not quite the right attachments I wanted but its usable.</li>
    <li> Nice device for the price, perfect size and not to large like some of the others that are on the market. This comes with many attachments for whatever the requirement might be for grooming.</li>
    <li> I bought this June 5th and it has already broken!  Two of the attachments already have broke and the trimmers (either one of them) do a horrible job giving clown edges.  Piece of junk!</li>
    <li> Good product,actually came early then schedule.&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with this purchase from this seller.&lt;br /&gt;i recommend this to everyone who&#x27;s looking for a good trimmer.</li>
    <li> Works well, but seems like it is fragile.&lt;br /&gt;Worth a try</li>
    <li> Great shaver and trimmer would suggest it to anyone</li>
    <li> for awhile, i was trying to decide if a trimmer was worth it. i had already purchased a set of clippers with a variety of guards, but found it very hard to get to the edges near the ear. this was a game changer.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and a great product.</li>
    <li> more power ...better cutting...multiple heads.....good buy</li>
    <li> No issues. Works great, just remember to pop the head off and clean the inside of the trimmers. Hair will build up in the head but this is preventative maintenance. Overall it works great!!!</li>
    <li> Very impressed with the power.  Makes trimming my beard EASY.  I would give 5 stars, but it likes to send trimmings all over the place.</li>
    <li> Well made and easy to use.  The heads are very easy to change and clean.</li>
    <li> this is not of good quality, very cheap.  Very loud.  Have to go over and over same area to get it to actually cut.  It doesn&#x27;t appear that it will last very long and it does not perform well, I guess you get what you pay for.  Spend a little more and get something better.</li>
    <li> Packaging was terrible. It took two days to open it, and peices went flying all over the place.  And its extremely loud, louder than my conair.  but its cheap, cheaper than Wal Mart.  Gets the job done.</li>
    <li> works great! The height is adjustable so it trims to the exact height you want. I&#x27;ve charged it once when I bought it and it&#x27;s still going strong 6 weeks later!  **Update 3/27/17 Still works!</li>
    <li> Works great, has all the stuff a man needs to do the beard etc. One thing that could make it 5 stars would be a bag to hold all the pieces in. Overall great product for the price.</li>
    <li> Great trimmer. Compared to other Norelco ones, this one works great and is powerful. It doesnt snag hairs as much either</li>
    <li> Very nice trimmer... easy to clean and it&#x27;s so smooth to trim without snagging hairs. Overall this has been one of the best ones, I recommend it.</li>
    <li> A Real Nice Product That Really Meets Almost All Males Hair Grooming Needs. The fact that product has a nose and ear trimmer attachment is a rare attachment for a product like this to find. I am extremely pleased with this product. I used this product on all my facial hair needs, nose hair, and ear hair needs. I have a long thick beard and I was able to trim my beard just as I wanted no troubles. I like keeping my beard with different thickness and length. With all the attachments I was able to keep my beard with different thickness and length the way I like to.  I was able to trim my lip muscle (mustache area) really well because of the smaller trimming head attachment made it very easy. The nose hair attachment work well just makes sure to get up all up there and get the nooks and crannies  The nose attachment doesn&#x27;t pull and tear the nose hair it cuts the nose hairs just as smooth as it does with the facial hair. With the nose being a sensitive area the vibration of the trimmer doesn&#x27;t tickle or irritate the nose. It also works really well on side burns. It is a really good all around trimmer set.</li>
    <li> ITS JUNK AND DOESNT WORK</li>
    <li> Great quality for the price.</li>
    <li> For the price on this guy, its pretty good stuff.  Here&#x27;s a breakdown of my experience, spaghetti western style:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE GOOD:&lt;br /&gt;-The ear and nose trimmer works very well, which was my main concern in getting this in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;-The trimmer length attachments also work well, as long as you start longer than you think you&#x27;ll need.  I cleaned up my sideburns and armpits quite effectively with the trimmer and its length attachment.  My previous method of doing so was to use a tiny scissors and it took so much longer!&lt;br /&gt;-Its cheap!  Its less than twenty bucks!  So if it busts or whatever, big deal, go buy another!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE BAD:&lt;br /&gt;-No bag to put the accessories in.  This thing has 5 heads and 2 trimmer guards, so its a lot of small things to keep track of.  The packaging includes no case or bag to house the unit and attachments.  I put mine in a quart size ziploc bag, which works well, but it wouldn&#x27;t have ran the price up that much to include a cheap cotton sack with a drawstring to house it all in.&lt;br /&gt;-The cord only charges it, it doesn&#x27;t power the unit independantly.  Eventually the battery will go bad and you will then have to replace the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE UGLY:&lt;br /&gt;-Be vary careful when using this on anything besides your face.  The trimmers get very bitey without the guard on them.  It will hurt, and there will be blood.  You&#x27;ve been warned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, not a bad little trimmer for the price.  There are better out there, but for what this costs I&#x27;m largely satisfied.I&#x27;m largely satisfied.</li>
    <li> Multi-use product that works well.  The on/off switch is cumbersome to turn on.  It&#x27;s also located on the opposite side to the head adjuster.  This is the first one that I&#x27;ve owned where the switch and adjuster are on opposite sides. If you need more than one height adjustment per use, it is clumsy to use.  Sounds minor but believe me it isn&#x27;t.  It does appear to be solidly constructed.</li>
    <li> great for trimming every part of your body</li>
    <li> i got this trimmer a few days back.it looks good apparently when i use it for trimmiming my nose and ear ,it didnt give me close result as i was expecting .i m sorry this is my experience.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, and the battery it&#x27;s amazing since I got It I charged just twice; and Its been more than a year</li>
    <li> Wow Great Product, and Fast shipping</li>
    <li> Great product, no issues so far</li>
    <li> IMHO this is the best beard/mustache/body hair trimmer out there under $20. I have nothing to support this claim but my own experience with this and three other groomers I&#x27;ve owned, but I still think its the best one out there for the bargain shoppers. I bought this to replace another Phillips Norelco Multigroom that I got 10 years ago that died, and although I was wary that it would be an inferior product it was actually pretty much the same machine with a different design. So far I love it and if battery lasts as long as the last one I will be quite pleased.  Edit: my one gripe is the on/off switch is designed poorly. the slightly raised white &amp;#34;power icon&amp;#34; and the four grooves are not raised enough to provide thumb resistance, so turning it on is sometimes a little tricky.</li>
    <li> Pretty nice shaver for 12 bucks...</li>
    <li> Impossible to fully clean the cutting heads.</li>
    <li> Hubby is very happy with this trimmer.  Less expensive than the last trimmer we had, and so far is working very well.  Our last trimmer (different brand) had to be thrown away because it turned on by itself, and we couldn&#x27;t get it to turn off without completely disassembling it and removing the battery.</li>
    <li> Great Product. Definitely worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Parts are kind of annoying to put away away after use, doesn&#x27;t come with anything to store the attachments other than the bulky box it came in.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for over 2 months now. The battery life is of about 35 minutes but thats is good enough for about 6 runs before needing a recharge. The beard Trimmer and other attachements work very well. Considering the price it seems a steal . Some other trimmer may come with more attachments, but practically I never felt the need for any other attachments. Its a product which will fulfill your routine needs and more.   excellent purchase at this price.I am completely satisfied with it and would recommend it strongly.</li>
    <li> Works well so far. Have only used it once so far.</li>
    <li> Nice, handy little trimmer, easy to control and maintain. Attachments let me trim my whiskers down to an even, uniform length.</li>
    <li> Just got this in the mail today and opened it. I&#x27;m going to assume the white gunk inside the pieces is glue..  Looks like Elmer&#x27;s Glue is holding the stuff together and when I swapped the heads out it got all over the inside of the main device. Never seen this before and not sure what to make of it, but the heads seem to function ok.</li>
    <li> I just used it once so far. Looks good. Cuts just fine. Only time will tell before I can give it a more knowledgeable review.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s simply the best!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product!</li>
    <li> Works well at a nice price.</li>
    <li> My old norelco finally died after 7 years and I bought this as a replacement. The method of changing the heads is a little awkward at first but battery life between charges is great.</li>
    <li> after 1 month of use the battery wont charge even when plugged in the charger...</li>
    <li> Lasts forever on a charge.  Very versitile as well.&lt;br /&gt;Great solution for all trimming needs.</li>
    <li> I am not sure if this is true only with the piece that was shipped to me, but the comb does not move smoothly on the groove. Furthermore, it does not go through all the 20 markings! Not just that - the precision trimmer does not seem to be as precise as they make it out to be. I would be happier using a razor blade than use this cheap piece of technology.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s reasonably priced and works pretty well. No complaints. It would have been a mistake for me to spring for a more expensive model.</li>
    <li> Works very well. Has all the options I would need for grooming beard, sideburns, mustache, etc.. Different attachments are easily attached/detached and easily cleaned.</li>
    <li> Attachments are not that great. One of them you have to be careful or if you go to fast at a certain angle and you can say bye bye to your mustache. Battery lasts a decent amount of time on a full charge so that&#x27;s nice.</li>
    <li> The price is right .. But ,I guess you get what you pay for !!</li>
    <li> Serves my purpose. WOrth the price!</li>
    <li> In general this is a nice trimmer; however, the attachments for the beard and mustache are a little questionable.  Basically, it fits over the clipper head and you move it up or down to adjust the height.  If you are not careful, you can cut off more than you want, and be alert as to which side of the beard/mustache attachment you are using.  One will cut very close.  Not as straight forth as having one attachment over the blade that you slide up and down.  My other trimmer gave you a full charge light, but this one doesn&#x27;t...or at least I have seen it...and there is nothing in the pamphlet that came with it.  In relation to the price...it&#x27;s not bad and therefore, I give it a 4.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my aging trimmer from roughly a decade ago. There is a lot to like about this new trimmer, including the service and support. When I tried to charge my trimmer for the first time, it would not take a charge. Norelco support was very helpful, however and immediately send a new unit to me and provided a box for me to send back my old charger and trimmer. The new charger and trimmer work great, and it has a variety of heads which seem to work better than the heads from my old trimmer. Overall it does what I need to do and I&#x27;m happy with it and the price I paid.</li>
    <li> great buy for the money!</li>
    <li> Good Price and It just works</li>
    <li> it didnt work as expected</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t beat the price and multi-functionality of the item. Ordered one, tried it out and ordered a second one for a gift right away!</li>
    <li> Good product at a fair price</li>
    <li> Know review, it was a gift, don&#x27;t know what he&#x27;ll say yet.</li>
    <li> This is the second one of these I&#x27;ve had. I used the first one until I wore it out. Great groomer for the price.</li>
    <li> Great little kit that works well for the money.  Battery seems to hold up  very well to this point.</li>
    <li> The first thing that I noticed is this unit doesn&#x27;t come with any kind of holder/organizer for all the various attachments and guards.  Pretty close to a deal-breaker right there, but I decided if it shaves well then it&#x27;s worth a little inconvenience.  What a mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The poorly designed guards, made of some kind of brittle plastic that doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;ll last, don&#x27;t shave evenly.  As others have stated here, the angle at which you hold the unit to your face makes a huge difference in the depth of the cut.  While any shaver with a guard will vary a bit based on the angle it&#x27;s held to your face, this thing is ridiculous.  I can&#x27;t shave my beard anywhere close to evenly, which is a definite deal-breaker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On top of that, the blade will cut you quite easily.  If I want to risk getting cut, I&#x27;ll simply use a straight razor, which, while difficult, is at least a proper cutting device.  This thing is just an electric menace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If that weren&#x27;t enough, it doesn&#x27;t have a charging base, just a charger with a plug.  I guess you&#x27;re expected to just lay the thing down next to your sink or on a shelf to charge.  Another deal-breaker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And good luck telling if it&#x27;s charging or not.  There is no indicator light of any kind anywhere on this unit to let you know if it&#x27;s charging, charged, dead, not getting power, nothing at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spend a little more and get a Wahl.  I am so incredibly disappointed in Philips, having owned many of their products over the years.  This is a huge step backward for them and has completely eroded my respect for their brand.  Besides my Sonicare toothbrush, I will never again bother spending money on a Philips product and will seriously consider other brands of toothbrushes when my Sonicare needs replacing, which, by the looks of where the company is headed, will be much sooner than I&#x27;d like.</li>
    <li> Trims hair well, but feels small and kind of fragile in my hands.  No pouch to hold all the parts.</li>
    <li> Good buy for under 20 bucks.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t expect outstanding result.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price. Works good too.</li>
    <li> I like it cause its rechargeable, no batteries required.</li>
    <li> The guards on this grooming set are not stable and give an uneven cut. The shaper doesn&#x27;t even give a clean cut. I had expeted better from Norelco.</li>
    <li> The clip broke in 2 months during regular usage, really poor quality from Philips.</li>
    <li> Nice to have all your trimming needs in just one device that is cordless.</li>
    <li> Kind of clumsy and the edges of the plastic trimmer guides are sharp.</li>
    <li> Works great. like others, I wish it had a storage bag or a stand to hold the parts.</li>
    <li> Love it. Great at getting those hard to reach places!</li>
    <li> No problems. Took me a bit to get the hang of changing the cutting heads. Does a great job. Glad I purchased this.</li>
    <li> I have an older version of this product that had a charging stand, a bag, a brush, and the stand could hold all the various heads. In addition, it had even a small shaver for close shaving. This product was disappointing. It doesn&#x27;t have a bag, a charging stand, a brush, or even a place to put all the accessories. Not to mention it doesn&#x27;t have the close shaver head for those who don&#x27;t want any bristles, which is what my husband uses the most. This product appears to target users that want to maintain their facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the parts I did use. I&#x27;ve used it on bikini lines w/ some good success. The plastics heads on the groomer are a bit irritating but you get used to them, I like the way you can change the depth of the shave. The battery also lasts pretty good. The nose trimmer is probably the best of the batch of head accessories. It trims the nose hairs well enought that it doesn&#x27;t pinch and yank out the hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rated it low because compared to my old one which I bought for the same price is still so much more useful than this product which I have the parts lying around in my drawer.</li>
    <li> I bought this one as it provides more levels or more adjustment to the length of your stubble. My older one offered 1mm and 3mm while not 2mm. Also, unlike the other shaver that I used this one was cheaper so I was skeptical. After a couple of months of use I have to say that I do enjoy the more precise height adjustment, but unlike my older and more expensive shaver, this one seems to require more passes to get it done. So considering that this one is fairly inexpensive, I am giving it 4 stars.</li>
    <li> Excellent on time delivery and for now It&#x27;s been 6 months now and no problems ever.</li>
    <li> they are cheap but they work</li>
    <li> I had problems with some of the attachments, I have had several different makes of this style of  groomer and this one is the worst.</li>
    <li> If you plan on using this on your precious cargo you are going to have a bad time. Also it feels kinda cheap in your hand and can be rather difficult to clean.</li>
    <li> Works well. Its washable with water. Esp the nose hair trimmer is really good. Also, very affordable price. Can&#x27;t ask for now for the same price.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my older Norelco trimmer.  I was initially attracted to this because of its advertised versatility.  And it is versatile, but the quality of the trim is not great.  Probably worth it to spend $10 more and get a better kit.</li>
    <li> A nice counter top cradle with charger would be very nice.&lt;br /&gt;But you just get a very thin molded plastic holder with no way to charge it other than leaving it laying on the counter.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried MANY different options for a inexpensive beard trimmer and this one seems to be holding up better than any of the others. I don&#x27;t know how long it will go, but for now it is my go to beard trimmer.</li>
    <li> First day review: opened within an hour or two of delivery and took a 15 minute trim&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;results: pretty even trim using the longest preset and a nice level of stubble around the cheeks and neck using the 5mm setting&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;one minor downside is that I just had to hold my thumb near the bottom of the comb length adjustor because it clicked down by 1mm, while I luckily just finished one half of my face&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the click down happened when I set it to 5mm but at 18mm it did wonderfully and really neatened up my scraggly beard&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;great value for the price&lt;br /&gt;would recommend</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good for the price, no problem so far. It&#x27;s average</li>
    <li> Well pleased with different settings and attachments. Item was shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> I used the older G370 for a few years, and got this for a replacement.  It&#x27;s more powerful, and works great.</li>
    <li> This was disappointing.  The convoluted design of the trimmer guides makes using them cumbersome - and completely impossible to use for my mustache.  ( And that was the main reason I bought it.)</li>
    <li> No pouch, no stand, nowhere to store parts. I&#x27;m using a quart sized ziploc baggie. Charged overnight after receiving it, works well. For $15 I&#x27;m not complaining. I had a Panasonic trimmer for over 8 yrs that just stopped working, so this one will do.</li>
    <li> For the money, this is a decent beard trimmer. It is able to cut off a pretty substantial beard without difficulty, and the attachments all work as advertised. However, unless you charge this, the shaver will not work (even when plugged in). This means that I can have the shahver plugged in and be unable to shave. I would expect any corded shaver to be able to work indefinitely when it is plugged in, and this represents the biggest downside to the device. Also, don&#x27;t expect this trimmer to be able to shave too closely -- you&#x27;ll need a separate device to become clean-shaven.</li>
    <li> This is my second Norelco trimmer.  The first one lasted five years.  The only reason I purchased new is the blades started getting dull and would snag on my beard when edging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You cannot beat the price for this trimmer.  It does a better job that some that cost five times or more.</li>
    <li> For $12 you can&#x27;t beat it</li>
    <li> Blades could be a little sharper, but for the money compared to others, this is an excellent product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a descent trimmer. Mine completely died after about a month and would not charge.</li>
    <li> great shipper works well as described</li>
    <li> Gets the job done but the quality isn&#x27;t that great. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Bought this as my first trimmer, and with nothing else to compare it too, I have been content. It does everything I need it too and holds a good charge. I wish there were an indicator to see how much charge it has left though!</li>
    <li> Works great. No complaints.</li>
    <li> This was bought in anticipation of culminating the &#x27;no-shave november&#x27; using this device. I&#x27;ll update this review when I actually use. Ah, first world problems.</li>
    <li> The price of this trimmer made me wary of it...but it has done a pretty good job on my son&#x27;s beard/mustache.  He tells me the guide attachment is a little clumsy and catches and pulls his whiskers a little...but not too much trouble.  For the price, I don&#x27;t see how you could do much better...and it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
    <li> works great! well made!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it much but it has done a nice job so far. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Precise trim and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Works very well, but look for the model that includes the hair clipping guard for added versatility. Part of the packaging can be used as a holder for it all when not in use, but it&#x27;s rather bulky. Still my favorite trimmer.</li>
    <li> Works well and seems like good quality. Hope it holds up a while.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality and value for money. I&#x27;d definitely recommend</li>
    <li> I wanted a lite, simple, inexpensive groomer. This one is perfect. It also holds a charge for a pretty long time.  Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> I had a older version of this ,they improved the heads, work real well for trimming</li>
    <li> Not great but withing this price - GOOD !</li>
    <li> Used once. So far great product. Being cheap I don&#x27;t expect it to last an extremely long time but it does what is advertised without any issue.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know if I got a dud or what, but the trimmer works fine by itself - however the adjustable combs do NOT work. There is a huge gap between the cutting edge and comb. This leads to uneven shaving and defeats the purpose of the combs. Returning after a month and looking for something else. I would avoid unless you will only use the unguarded razor or the lowest setting.</li>
    <li> There is no pouch to keep all the attachments and no concise label for what does what. But a great groomer otherwise.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used Philips grooming kits and this one is better than most i&#x27;ve used. I would&#x27;ve loved a better case for the attachments though. All in all, worth the money.</li>
    <li> I do not like this product. It has several negative points as:&lt;br /&gt;- Trimmer Blades are not really sharp.&lt;br /&gt;- Noisy&lt;br /&gt;- The vibration can bother after a few minutes on your hand&lt;br /&gt;- Device and main trimmer have not a flat surface. There are several groves that difficult to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a Panasonic similar device, older than this, and it is much better. The blade is really sharp, the device surface is completely flat, It is more silence and less vibration that Philips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only two advantage that this Philips has over Panasonic are: the nose trimmer and can be used during charging.</li>
    <li> He had one before and love it</li>
    <li> Very good quality trimmer. I like how it is easy to adjust and to clean. It charges pretty fast too. Overall it is a very good quality basic trimmer. I use it for my face and eyebrows. It delivers that &amp;#34;stubbly&amp;#34; look very well.</li>
    <li> This works really well, especially considering the price. My husband is really happy with it. Charge is decent, and it stays fairly clean.</li>
    <li> Great grooming kit, thanks!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good for multiple function and give me a good hair styling with the help of MY colleague</li>
    <li> a great product. I totally recommend it :-)</li>
    <li> Great unit for the price. Lots of features.</li>
    <li> Its a fair product for the price and does the job well.</li>
    <li> Razor was exactly what I was anticipating. It&#x27;s updated feature are nice.</li>
    <li> great stocking stuffer</li>
    <li> Works exceedingly well</li>
    <li> Excellant and speedy delivery!</li>
    <li> This shaver is very awkward to use on the face. The design is not very comfortable to hold and it pulls hair instead of smoothly cutting it off like the previous model. I&#x27;m a bit disappointed about this.</li>
    <li> Gave this as a Christmas gift to my 19 yr. old son and he is very happy with it, very pleased with trimmer.</li>
    <li> As described, on time and works fine</li>
    <li> Works very well, holds a charge for a long time. My only problem with it is the plastic attachments are a bit too thick and ften times my it will just run over my facial hair, rather than getting my facial hair to get into it and get shaved. I have to go over certain areas of y face several times for it to get every hair. But it causes little to no irritation to my face.</li>
    <li> The performance of this trimmer is great, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> Well, sometimes you lose a charging cord, as was the case with me.  After checking out Amazon to see how much I&#x27;d pay for a new charging cord, I realized that the price was only $2 less than this multigroom kit.  Well, I figured having some spare heads, combs, and a new groomer body wasn&#x27;t a bad idea, considering I was paying only $2 more for the entire kit rather than just the cord.  Speaking to the kit, it is pretty good, especially considering the price.  I use it almost daily to keep my mustache and goatee in check, and it makes the process fast and painless.  It&#x27;s far easier to maintain my look with this than using scissors and a razor.  5 stars.  The price is good, and for what you are paying for, the product is solid.</li>
    <li> Using this trimmer, I managed to trim my gosh darn beard without messing it up and having to shave, which was a first. Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> This does a great job and am very pleased with the product,&lt;br /&gt;My old one needed a new battery, so it was cheaper just to buy&lt;br /&gt;a new trimmer.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. Kudos to Phillips.</li>
    <li> I counted on the brand and maybe expected a little more. It does the job, feels cheap, not very comfortable. I would rather pay extra 10-20 bucks to get something better.</li>
    <li> It did a really good job on the beard and hair!!</li>
    <li> great and strong and sharp.</li>
    <li> Great Piece...Works and keeps charged great!</li>
    <li> The precision trimmer did not work as I expected. It is to coarse and cannot remove tiny hairs on the face.</li>
    <li> I bought this trimmer to replace my purple Panasonic that I dropped in the toilet. I really don&#x27;t like it. It constantly nicks my skin and draws blood. Not fun! If you plan on using it on your face, legs, arms etc then it&#x27;ll to the job.</li>
    <li> its very useful for small changes on your hair, its very handy and useful. comparing to price it could be good deal</li>
    <li> After about 18 months of light use (twice a week), it is still working perfect. I was not expecting the battery and the blades to last more than a year for such a low price! I love it cuz it is light and it has never pulled out of my hair. I have even used it twice to cut my hair! Worked well in that matter too.</li>
    <li> Good beard trimmer. Battery life is awesome. I have charged it once since I got it a month ago and haven&#x27;t had to plug it in since.</li>
    <li> I was using the Norelco G370 model before and bought this to replace it. First of all as other reviewers had mentioned, this item does not come with a carry case or a comb, but all the items that it does come with, works perfectly well. I&#x27;ve been buying multigroom products from different manufacturers over the last few years and usually the Nose trimmer does not work in other products.&lt;br /&gt;The QG3330&#x27;s trimmers work perfectly well, and don&#x27;t pull on the hair. They are a bit more powerful than the G370 but still safe to use all around the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with my purchase well within $20 dollars, but worth a lot more.&lt;br /&gt;Another positive for people who travel to Europe, this comes with a worldwide voltage capability which can be charged and used in EU nations as well as USA.</li>
    <li> I like the small size of this little clipper and with all the attachments it does everything you could ask for.  Battery last a good while on each charge.</li>
    <li> For the price, this is an unbelievable deal, Love this trimmer</li>
    <li> 3 stars BC it did not come with body groomer. I thought it did... Which is my fault.</li>
    <li> I currently shave twice a week and I&#x27;m in my 30s.  I wanted a product that I could use fix mistakes made by the person cutting my hair (Great Clips).  It doest happen often but I usually have a few spots that I like a certain way and this product fit the bill.  Things I don&#x27;t:  When you plug mine in after the battery has drained the light is green  then turns to red, instead of the usual red to green.  Great product for basic maintenance.</li>
    <li> Holds a charge for weeks .. since I&#x27;ve had it.. Its not the best but well worth the price, No regrets</li>
    <li> works wonderfully well</li>
    <li> This really does a good job keeping my beard and mustache short and trim. The attachment for nose and ear trimming is also great. I don&#x27;t know how many times I cut myself using scissors. I also like that I can just run it under the faucet to clean it. My only issue is that it didn&#x27;t come in a case, but I used an old case from a trimmer that didn&#x27;t work out. And I haven&#x27;t had to recharge the battery yet.</li>
    <li> Coming off a few battery powered wahl products I was a bit skeptical. This has cleared all doubt I ever had and the best part is I don&#x27;t need to travel with the charger if i&#x27;m not travelling for too long.</li>
    <li> Good one&lt;br /&gt;only caveat is, there is no light that tells device is being charged.</li>
    <li> A great little trimmer!</li>
    <li> Quick delivery to wrong house but got delivered to me and very handy for quick touch ups.</li>
    <li> The Price of 18$ is very good&lt;br /&gt;Levels control is very good&lt;br /&gt;Accessories are useful&lt;br /&gt;Very handy, size is good&lt;br /&gt;Battery life is very good&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this again for someone.</li>
    <li> Purchased to replace a lower end groomer that just didn&#x27;t have the guts to keep up with a families needs. This one will!</li>
    <li> Very cheap! The plastic guards broke after 1 week of use. It&#x27;s not worth the money.  Look for something better.</li>
    <li> THIS IS A SMART LITTLE MACHINE IT&#x27;S PRETTY STURDY THE ATTACHMENTS ALLOW IT TO DO MORE THEN I EXPECTED AND I WAS PLEASENTLY SURPRISED AT ITS VERSITALITY. THE ONLY DOWNER IS THER&#x27;S  NO CASE OR STAND FOR IT. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN PERFECT IF IT INCLUDED A STAND FOR THE GOOMER WHILE CHARGING OR A CASE FOR THE ACCESSORIES WHEN NOT IN USE.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s like that Guiness commercial. BRILLIANT! Trimmer works wonders on whisker woes and worrisome waves of startling stubble. Just be careful when using it on delicate areas (wink wink). Packaging was nice, battery lasts long, adjuster adjusts and I look at least 44.09856% less homeless. Do recommend highly.</li>
    <li> I am happy with this product and for the price, its definitely worth it!!! it is light and handy to use, comfortable grip.</li>
    <li> I bought this item from Amazon.com LLC. Not sure it&#x27;s the issue with the actual product or the ones sold by this particular seller.&lt;br /&gt;It stopped working in 1 month. I can no longer use it now. It&#x27;s not broken or damaged, but simply stopped working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend not to buy this product. It looks cheap from money perspective, but it&#x27;s actually a cheap product and you will lose your money.</li>
    <li> Husband really likes it...great buy!</li>
    <li> Great product. It works very well. I love it. Its the best one i have had in years.</li>
    <li> Its just OK.  Different attachments fit well.  Blades are not all that sharp, even when new.  If you can afford better or need better then you may want to shell out a few extra bucks for a better model.  For the price its okay, everything works.</li>
    <li> Good product for price. Works well and is easy to use</li>
    <li> Not worth the money, buy a Wahl trimmer instead. I wanted to use this trimmer for a close stubble look, what I got was a spotty/patch stubble look that took 3 times as long to get as my old Wahl trimmer. On the positive side, I was able to  get a refund.</li>
    <li> Terrific razor.  Very powerful for a small rechargeable razor.  Perfect for what I needed it for, at a very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> The razor worked great for about a month, but then the battery died and it will not recharge. I have left it charging for days and still it does not work. What a waste of 20 dollars.</li>
    <li> I just got this today.. Comes pre-charged! I have had one before I bought from wal-mart. very high quality trimmer for the price, i used it for 4 months in the backwoods running on only gas generators for power and no running water/toilet/etc. It held up out there in the rough. I say that was and is the ultimate test. I would buy this again, and again,... (:</li>
    <li> The trimmer itself is absolutely fine. This is my second: I travel a lot and I have used one for a few months in the UK. While the guard design of the beard trimmer isn&#x27;t perfect, it&#x27;s open at the leading edge, it works fine and I&#x27;ve not had any problems. I&#x27;d give it four stars in isolation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why one star then? The packaging. It just took a 20 minute fight, with a sharp knife and scissors, to get into the plastic packaging it ships with. Honestly, it seems like it&#x27;s made of industrial grade kevlar or something? Honestly, do yourself a favour and get something else rather than risk losing a finger or a hand trying to get into this.</li>
    <li> This little trimmer/groomer does everything it says it will do.  I used it to trim and spruce up my husbands out of control goatee.  With a variety of combs, you can have as little or as much facial hair as you want.  And I&#x27;ll admit, neither of us wanted to try the nose/ear hair trimmer, so I can&#x27;t comment on that feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed as I removed this from the packaging was there wasn&#x27;t a bag to store it and all the small parts (I think 7 of them, including the unit and the charger).  Upon reading the product description, I see where the more expensive models do have a pouch.  But I suppose the manufacturer felt that even a cheap cloth bag was too much to offer.  Guess we&#x27;ll use a zipper lock bag when we travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first charge took 10 hours to get the groomer up to speed.  It worked well for the entire time we used it - which was about an hour - before it needed recharging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Better half did make the comment that it did seem to pull and sting a bit in the sensitive areas of his face, and while he&#x27;ll still have me trim the straight lines using the groomer - he has gone back to a regular manual razor for the rest of his face.</li>
    <li> I like this type of trimmer. Its basic, but comes from a brand I like to purchase from. Not only is it durable, but the heads snap on easily and they change out easily as well. The way they mount also allows you to make sure you will not have issues with an uneven trim. You can understand it right out of the box, without all the bells and whistles many of today&#x27;s shavers try to add.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For this price, its a really great buy.</li>
    <li> Best mustache and beard trimmer that I have used. Would recommend highly.</li>
    <li> My husband loves his shaver combo.</li>
    <li> Works well and reasonable price</li>
    <li> Works like a charm, I love the attachments, and the fact that its rechargeable, portable, and cordless.</li>
    <li> The overall feel of this shaver isn&#x27;t that sturdy. But for the price you can&#x27;t beat it. Especially the fact that you can rinse it with water makes keeping it clean a breeze. The size is small and makes it easy to travel. For the price it&#x27;s definitely recommended.</li>
    <li> Good value at 1st I wasn&#x27;t sure I liked the product but after I used it a few times I found it worked better than I had anticipated.</li>
    <li> Trimmer is good, but it has terrible battery. Can&#x27;t operate on low battery level even when it&#x27;s connected to a charger.</li>
    <li> Very good, worth the money.</li>
    <li> It meets all the requirements and it is very smooth and easy to clean.no of options for trimming and shaving</li>
    <li> This shaver arrives charged and ready to go with a variety of attachments that are easy to switch out and easy to use. It makes quick work of maintaining short haircuts and I am sure is a breeze for beards, noses, and ears (and more sensitive areas), though we have only used it on one head so far. Easy to clean, since all parts are able to be rinsed with water. Seems to be a very good deal so far. Would love if it came with a storage case for all the little parts. The tray is a disposable thin plastic thing, and we&#x27;ll not be using that long term.</li>
    <li> Great trimmer but was hoping it would do more detail in the beard.</li>
    <li> Just a great product.</li>
    <li> Pretty simple electric razor. I had one before and it never worked and never charged and the battery life was even worse. This one seems to work. It pinches though so be careful when working down there. I can&#x27;t stress it enough or you&#x27;re going to cut some skin in the worst part. The very worst part to cut it. Just be careful. It cuts hair pretty good and I am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Very nice used once and found to be very good regarding service that was excellent&lt;br /&gt;got it before i expected thanks keep up the good work</li>
    <li> What can I say.No more unsightly nose or ear hair scarring my grandchildren.I look 10 years younger.Works great.Great price.Good buy.</li>
    <li> I really like this trimmer. I bought it to replace a really cheap one that lasted about two years. This one is way more powerful and trims my beard in minutes. It is easy to set and clean too.</li>
    <li> Took 20 minutes to cut through the packaging and another 15 minutes to figure out how to use the attachments. The illustrations are not very good. That said, this is a fine trimmer. Works very well. Glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> I got the clippers thinking that the guards would be better quality plastic but they seemed cheap and thin. Also, just using the blade to shave it doesn&#x27;t seem to cut as close as my old Whal clippers. It&#x27;s easier on the skin though. I do like that you can rinse it under the faucet when.done as my old ones got all gunked up with hair. So good for the price but I&#x27;d gladly pay a bit more for better quality.</li>
    <li> Works great. This was the first time I tried a something like this. I was skeptical because of the low price but it works great.</li>
    <li> I cant believe that I have not owned a personal groomer. Let&#x27;s just say things are much more &amp;#34;tidy&amp;#34; and it is so easy to use. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I use this for things other than what the recommend, everything is great. I&#x27;m scared to use the nose trimmer in fear that it my rip out my brain.</li>
    <li> Everything you need to manscape. What a great value. I shave with a razor and needed this electric trimmer to trim hairs a razor couldn&#x27;t handle. Sometimes I grow a goatee and this trimmer should definitely do a much better job than my other larger hair trimmer which I used a #2 guard to trim my goatee with. Unfortunately my other trimmer was kind of big and lacked the ability to really select varying trimming heights. This product should take care of those issues without a problem. It also is a great size that fits in my hand perfectly and is easy to maneuver and control for precise trimming around the ears.</li>
    <li> Very nice, love the different attachments.</li>
    <li> OK, I&#x27;ll get right to the point: I was looking for a multi-groom trimmer, because I&#x27;m a guy and I like to keep everything trimmed &amp;#34;down under&amp;#34;.  The trimmers I have had in the past did not do the job adequately, or really hurt being used in the sensitive areas.  This trimmer works perfectly: with the adjustable blade guards on, you can remove as much of the hair as you want, and there is absolutely no pain or pulling or pinching in the very sensitive areas on a man (I&#x27;m sure the men reading this, know of what I speak!).  I have not used the trimmer for grooming my hair, nor do I have any facial hair, so I can&#x27;t comment on those aspects, but for body trimming, for a guy, this trimmer works perfectly.  And the price is amazing!</li>
    <li> Useless product. Very poor quality. It promised works for eyebrowns grooming but it is very uncomfortable to used there. I am very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Good Price &amp; Gets The Job Done, only negative was opening it from the sealed plastic.</li>
    <li> seems pretty decent so far for the price cant argue</li>
    <li> Easy to use and just what I needed.  I have one already and gifted this to someone for Christmas.  They were just as happy with the trimmer as I was.  Awesome Trimmer!</li>
    <li> Really like this so far, I got this because you can use it when it is plugged in. Unlike the other two that I had to get rid of after the battery went dead in six months. Not this brand name though.</li>
    <li> I had the previous model for several years and liked it just as much. I use it to keep a beard at about 3/8 inch. Works great.</li>
    <li> Excellent assortment of shaving requirements and good value.</li>
    <li> I have bought 2 of these now and they are really good quality trimmers. The first 1 I bought I have had for over a year and it still works great. It does not hold a charge like the new one which is why I gave 4 stars. All in all would buy again and again. Accessories are also good.</li>
    <li> This is an update of the philips trimmer that sells around $20. The clip attachments dont work as well and the trimmer overall is a disappointment.</li>
    <li> For the price, I find it very good even that I didn&#x27;t know, it was made of plastic, but don&#x27;t worry, It doesn&#x27;t look that cheap at all. The attachments are very good for you beard, trims very fast too. Giving it 4 stars because I didn&#x27;t know that it wasn&#x27;t water resistant.</li>
    <li> Great product! Showed up quick.</li>
    <li> This is a smaller, less expensive, lighter version of salon trimmers.  I cut my husband&#x27;s hair and use it on his neck and sideburns.  It works very well for both applications.  It cleanly removes unwanted hair. It&#x27;s not professional quality, but for what I need it is fine.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m thinking about using it on my wired hair dog for a trim here and there, but haven&#x27;t had the nerve yet.  I&#x27;ll let you know if I try it.&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;  I have been using this every time I cut my husband&#x27;s hair.  So far it&#x27;s still on its first charge.  It is a great addition to my traditional scissor cut.  Still haven&#x27;t tried on the dog.  Stay tuned.&lt;br /&gt;Still using this in Aug. 2015.  They have been used monthly on my husband and on my dog.  They are still sharp and work great.  The charge lasts a LONG time.</li>
    <li> The problem that others have stated with this groomer cutting uneven and even cutting your skin is that the guard is set too far back from the edge of the razor head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This makes it incredibly difficult to get an even shave because if you tilt it at the wrong angle then you may as well not have a guard on it at all. keeping it at the right angle while shaving is almost impossible since your face isn&#x27;t flat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had many different groomers and I have never had one do so poorly before. This is a complete waste of money because of this one major defect.</li>
    <li> A good shaver for the money.</li>
    <li> My one star comes from the fact that this trimmer pulled my beard hairs and when I used it without a guard to cut close, it cut my face. I took it back promptly.&lt;br /&gt;Since I&#x27;m here, here&#x27;s what&#x27;s good about it. It doesn&#x27;t feel cheap, the foil shaver isn&#x27;t have bad if you like that kind of thing. It has the nose, ear trimmer and they work well.&lt;br /&gt;Whats bad: cut me, pulled hair, guide levels didn&#x27;t exactly give me what I wanted. I think the turbo button is so stupid. I can&#x27;t think of any reason I would want to make it run slow and risk pulling hair more than it already does.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still looking for the right trimmer, my next attempt will be Remington.</li>
    <li> for what this is I like it, multi functional and its sharp enough to cut your hair without cutting your skin.</li>
    <li> Bought this to shave my 3yr old sons head.  Anyone that has ever tried to shave the head of moving target knows how difficult it can be!! The guards on this are great! My little wiggler is safe getting his head shaved...trust me he could have lost an ear due to his inability to sit still for more than 3 seconds!!</li>
    <li> easy to clip my beard.</li>
    <li> Great multi trimmer, comes with a 2 year warranty, multi attachments, incredible.  it is rechargeable but incase you run out of juice you just plug it in and use it via the power cord, that is fantastic.  Great product at a great price.</li>
    <li> So far works well. Its small and convenient for travel.</li>
    <li> works like it should and it does what i want! I wish the spacer thing was a little better tho</li>
    <li> This is our second Phillips Norelco trimmer we have bought.  We had a G380 for about four years and did numerous haircuts for ourselves and even friends.  After four years, the battery started to get weak and the blades dulled a bit.  But it still works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bear in mind that during those four years, we probably saved close to $2000 in haircut fees (the local barbershop wants $15 plus tip just to run the trimmer over my head).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So we thought about getting another G380.  Sadly, it is no longer available, but the G370 model is very similar - but costs $50 or more (!!!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The QG3330/42 Multigroom was under $20 and we got free shipping.  The battery is powerful, and it is very sharp.  It does not have an electric razor attachment, however (so I&#x27;ll keep the G380 for that).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALSO, the number settings go from 1-12 on one attachment and 1-18 on another.  They are NOT the same measurements as the old G380.  A five or six on the G380 is probably a 10 or 12 on this machine.  I found this out the hard way, but oh, well, I need short hair for summer, anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that being said, I have to say it is a great product, and if you are spending $20 at a babershop, think about how much that adds up to, over a year, even if you get your hair cut only once a month.</li>
    <li> OKAY for the price, but does not provide a smooth finish. Not at all designed to groom the privates, hurts a lot.&lt;br /&gt;While buying I thought I would be using this product quite often, guess I was not thinking straight looking at the price.</li>
    <li> A hair guard should be add to the unit to complete this package.</li>
    <li> As good if not better than the $80 ones. Great price and I feel like I got a really good value for what this comes with.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. No issues. Feels sturdy. Only improvement I&#x27;d suggest is for Norelco to include a bag to hold everything.</li>
    <li> This was an amazing purchase. I clears out all the mess in just 5 minutes. I am loving it.  :)</li>
    <li> Got this a few months ago. I have pretty coarse body hair and it works perfectly for my needs. I hate shaving so I just buzz my face every couple days. I will say the nose hair trimmer isn&#x27;t perfect but just gotta use kind of vigorously.</li>
    <li> This groomer is nice it came already chargerd up... had it for a week still doesn&#x27;t need a charge after multiple uses..</li>
    <li> I wish I could give this product zero stars!&lt;br /&gt;The guide clips used to determine the hair length are flimsy pieces of plastic! The blades claim that the rounded blade teeth make for a more comfortable shave, the teeth bit on the first shave! I could go on but it&#x27;s a waste of money! I should have just bought my old style Remington !!</li>
    <li> 30 to 40 min of battery is the average I&#x27;ve already encountered for this kind of appliance. The battery lasts the sufficient time to use it for what I need. Waterproof and very easy to clean it.</li>
    <li> This item is exactly what I needed. The battery last as long as I need it. It has the power and attachments to do what it says it does. What else can you say, it&#x27;s not magic, it just does what it supposed to do!</li>
    <li> I like the light weight of the razor. I have only used the razor twice so I think I need more time to evaluate. I like it so far!</li>
    <li> works well enough for this quality</li>
    <li> Lots of attachments and it works as expected... All you need to know. No problems at all!!</li>
    <li> A multi-tool for personal use.  Good price and good build quality.</li>
    <li> First beard, first time I ever purchased anything like this.  After looking and finally reading the English version of I instructions, wish you could just get get an easy to read English version rather than a map size set folded liked some secret file from WW2.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway works get, good battery length, takes time to master the trimming. Good Value.</li>
    <li> Work fine,  the battery is just perfect, 1 charge and a lots of shapes.</li>
    <li> The battery life is impressive, and it&#x27;s very good for trimming.</li>
    <li> as described works great</li>
    <li> Sheer GARBAGE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this to replace a discontinued model that had been my go-to for about 8 yrs. This one is a disaster, the &amp;#34;guide&amp;#34; is a plastic guard that slips over the top and has to be removed each time for cleaning. Also it does not have adjustment features that lend it to multiple trim areas. I&#x27;ve stabbed myself in the face so many times trying to get close but to no avail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally; the Multi-function part of this tool is a JOKE! Every time you remove a head and replace it, nose to groom, groom to shave, etc. hair gets clogged up in the grease that is used to lubricate the shaft that makes the thing spin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now about the battery life, again a JOKE, you need to use this thing on the &amp;#34;turbo&amp;#34; setting at all times or it will not cut/trim or in any way cut anything. My beard is not like wire so I don&#x27;t understand this issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, I had LOVED my old Norelco trimmer with changeable heads, this replacement is not even close to the quality or build of my old one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today, I order the Whal trimmer</li>
    <li> Works well.  I&#x27;ve only charged it once, and used it probably 7 or 8 times so far, about 5 minutes each time.  No signs of slowing down yet (haven&#x27;t had any pulling/grabbing of my hair).  I&#x27;ve seen a lot of reviews about the the adjustable guards breaking.  They are made of plastic, so of course you have to be careful with them.  For the price you&#x27;re paying, you can&#x27;t expect something indestructible.  Overall: Good product, great price.</li>
    <li> love the new groomer, works terrific</li>
    <li> I like it&lt;br /&gt;Is good</li>
    <li> My husband is using it to trim his beard and he seems pleased!</li>
    <li> Just ok. I do not like the trimmer adjustment its hard to use</li>
    <li> Works great for beards but not too great on head hair (you gotta go through your hair over and over again to properly cut it) this is why I took 1 star off.</li>
    <li> Philips Norelco is a very useful electric shaver. With multiple applications and easy interchangeable depth adjustments. Electric razors have come a long way and Philips provides a close shave of the sideburns without the hassles.</li>
    <li> Perfect for keeping my beard at 3mm. Best feature is that it can be powered by the charger - so when the battery goes completely ( they do ) - it will still work plugged in.</li>
    <li> I have always liked a little bit of the stubble-look, but in the past I achieved this look by shaving every third or fourth day.  With the multi-groom tool I can maintain a slightly rough look with ease.  It also works great as a ear/nose hair clipper.  The various heads and lengths would support a wide variety of facial hair styles. I also like the trimmer can shape along the neck line to provide a clean and professional shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It runs quietly, and I particularly appreciate this device is rechargeable. Easy to use with many applications. 5-star product all the way</li>
    <li> A great groomer for the money. Love the positioning when shaping ur beard. Makes it really easy to see that all important line. I use it to shave my head also. Works good. Doesn&#x27;t come with a foil attachment tho so it doesn&#x27;t get very close.</li>
    <li> Great product, exactly what I was looking for. Afforable, quality build, and great battery life.</li>
    <li> Recently got this product and so far I like the quality. This thing is a steal at such a low price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used the beard trimmer, the hair comb, the precision head, and the ear/nose head and all work great. This product also does a good job as a eyebrow trimmer.</li>
    <li> I was originally using the older model (G370/60) and I didn&#x27;t realize this newer model existed!  I was using my G370 unit, the trimmer was starting to get too abrasive, even after treating the blades with oil.  I decided to update my model to this one and it works great!  Been using it for a few weeks now and the trimmer is more pleasant to use. The revised shape allows for a closer trim.  Still takes a little bit to figure out the screw on attachments.  The one thing I miss is the foil shaver - I guess I&#x27;ll have to do with it.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately my 93-year old father did not find it user friendly and was very disappointed with it--especially with all the unnecessary attachments.</li>
    <li> This work very well, and is very handy.</li>
    <li> For everyday touch ups, etc...this does the trick. Its weird, it seems to never require charging. All the extra attachments were a nice bonus.</li>
    <li> its real good , i like it , the accessory that come with is very helpful to shave , thank you</li>
    <li> Does the job well. I am pleased with the value for money.</li>
    <li> This was the fastest order to reach my doorstep. It works perfectly. Love that it&#x27;s cordless &amp; gives you a choice on how much or low little you want your hair (or fur for most of us men) trimmed. It doesn&#x27;t bite your skin while cutting... easily handles your situation in seconds. A little quick shape up? No problem. This is by far the best present I&#x27;ve ever bought myself.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Phillips so it does what it says. But the head design is rather flimsy, on second use the nose trimmer one stopped working, apparently the whole mechanism of rotation is held by a very weak small plastic piece. Not sexy.&lt;br /&gt;I had to buy another separate nose trimmer (fixed head this time) from Panasonic, which funnily enough costs more than this whole thing.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Ergnomic design&lt;br /&gt;Strong and cuts properly&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Very flimsy head pieces that break easily, careful when you switch them.</li>
    <li> Definitely perfect trimmer for private parts. Easy to use and has wide varieties of fittings.</li>
    <li> Very useful, good price.</li>
    <li> Would of gotten 5 stars if it came with a travel case or a stand. Great product.</li>
    <li> Plastic glide is weak and bends.  As a result, uneven ...... (wherever you trim)</li>
    <li> Works really well for me. It&#x27;s great value for money. Unlike other reviewers, I find the beard comb cuts more evenly than my previous trimmer.  Edit: it&#x27;s been 6 months since I bought this, and the nostril trimmer (which I rarely use) broke on me. The little plastic tab which attaches to the rotor fell apart. Downgraded rating because of this.</li>
    <li> Compact in size and the attachments are very useful .its an excellent buy for the price .</li>
    <li> It does what it is supposed to do. But there is one serious flaw. There is a part that adjusts how high you want the guide. I want it at three to create a stubble. So you push it with your thumb to the height you want. Well, that thing you push, moves really easily. So as you&#x27;re shaving, if you accidentally push into your chin too hard, it will just push the guide down and you have this little section with no hair LOL. Other than that it does the job really well and the batter lasts forever. I lost the charger and haven&#x27;t charged it for a year now and it still works.</li>
    <li> Good product and decent cost!</li>
    <li> You can definitely find a better quality product at the same price. This razor barley cuts the hair, very disapointing</li>
    <li> excellent choice, works very well, good price too</li>
    <li> I got this because I seemed to have misplaced my old one when moving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing works wonderful. It&#x27;s rechargeable and gets the job done. I work a lot on the road and the battery life lasts forever. Love it.</li>
    <li> great price fast shipping</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco products for last few years. They discontinued (or may be amazon just doesn&#x27;t sell it anymore) the Norelco I usually buy, so I bought this one. Its ok, you have to be VERY careful at the angle you hold the trimmer; slight mishap and bye bye that patch of hair. The other product I use to buy didn&#x27;t have that problem.</li>
    <li> Great overall trimmer, it&#x27;s only getting 4 stars because you cannot use it in the shower but I knew that in advance.  Good for body parts, easy to change out attachments.</li>
    <li> This is a great groomer.  I use it mainly for sideburns and body hair, and it excels in those departments.  I like how I can use a single spacer that moves up and down, as opposed to having a cumbersome collection of various spacers.  I haven&#x27;t tried the nose trimmer, so sorry I can&#x27;t speak to that.  I personally find it healthier for the nose hair follicles to use a scissor, but that&#x27;s just me.</li>
    <li> The mini-trimmer will not attach to the base. I can&#x27;t see anything obvious, but it just won&#x27;t twist on. The settings were hugely different than my previous Phillips Norelco trimmer, so the first trim was a little shorter than I like. Other than that, it works well. No pulling of hair or other problems normally associated with inexpensive models.</li>
    <li> Excellent trimmer package..I paid 13.00 and change out the door, Now the price is doubled. I scored</li>
    <li> Very good !! Simple, practical and really does it all! Cleans up the bag!</li>
    <li> My husband had the original of this product that was old so I&#x27;ve replaced it more than once and hewas never happy. I finally googled the old one and found this at Amazon. He&#x27;s happy as can be! Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> Pretty decent, especially for the price, but jesus christ what the hell kind of battery system are they using where you can&#x27;t use the thing when it&#x27;s plugged in after it dies. It died one morning and I thought &amp;#34;no biggie, I&#x27;ll just plug it in and finish&amp;#34; but nope, you have to wait like 10-30 mins till it charges to a point where it&#x27;ll last more than a few seconds. Otherwise I quiet like it, it has a big size for the adjustments and I use it to trim my hair sometimes too.</li>
    <li> works well if a little underpowered</li>
    <li> for the price you just cant beat. I was skeptical at firs because it was so cheap. But it works very well and is easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Maintaining a beard can become tedious. Owning a quality beard trimmer/groomer will help keep your beard looking well groomed and trimmed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having a goatee and mustache means constant trimming and contouring. The Philips Norelco QQ3330/42 Multi-Groom Precision Trimmer attachment helps create the fine lines, curves and detailing when shaping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comes with 4 beard and mustache attachments and one nose and ear trimmer. Battery life is average, but one very nice feature is that you are able to use the trimmer while it is plugged in and charging. Feels comfortable to hold and extremely easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A mighty beard trimmer that trims evenly, consistently and works great with any beard style. Whether you are trimming stubble, goatee or a full length beard, this trimmer performs effortlessly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative comment is that should of come with some kind of attachment bag to keep all the items and pieces together.</li>
    <li> Great product, this is the best trimmer I have used.</li>
    <li> Needed to replace my old trimmer.  Changing the heads is counter-intuitive at first.  Performance is very good though.</li>
    <li> They say that nothing is nicer than a well groomed man, well if you have facial hair, and want something quick, easy to use and adaptable this is for you.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t use it anywhere other than your face, as it does pull and tweak the longer hairs in the beard, and make you wince - I don&#x27;t personally shave anywhere other than my face, but for those who do I would recommend something else.&lt;br /&gt;This is a nice unit, with all the attachments it&#x27;s easy to get some nice trimming and shaping, without the problems of a single straight clipper edge.&lt;br /&gt;As some other reviewer noted, a bag would have been nice to store the attachments, but this is reasonably priced so a trade off I guess.&lt;br /&gt;Cordless, but limited to about half an hour between charges.&lt;br /&gt;I liked the ability to wash it off as well, as it is waterproof.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 4 stars, for looks, ease of use and price.</li>
    <li> Works well, arrived quickly.  Very happy.</li>
    <li> Excellent trimmer.  Shipped well.</li>
    <li> Works well for my son who is always using this.  Handy size for traveling.</li>
    <li> works good, no complaints.</li>
    <li> It was kind of hard to figure out all of the attachments &amp; their uses using the GIANT instruction sheet. Other than literature that&#x27;s not clear, the trimmer itself seems to do a fine job for a very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> The trimmer is powerful and does not snag on hairs.  It had kept my sideburns, back of the neck, and nose hairs well-groomed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The standard trimmer attachment is not meant to completely shave private areas, but I found that it will manicure the lawn and help keep your significant other out of the jungle.  You should not touch the blades to any soft, hanging skin areas, as they will cut and cause bleeding.  On normal skin, it is perfectly safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lack of a storage stand/bag is a major negative. but for the price, it really can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> Keeps my beard well trimmed and has a long battery life</li>
    <li> Decent for facial hair but not so great for chest or arms. I would recommend to go for a Panasonic model.</li>
    <li> This is a good, but pretty standard trimmer. The product is easy to use... it&#x27;s simple to change heads or use the attachments. I needed this mostly for trimming up hair at the back of the neck/sideburns, which requires the precision grooming head. And I a little disappointed in the performance of this attachment. Also, the lack of storage pouch is just annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positives:&lt;br /&gt;Ease of Use&lt;br /&gt;Lots of uses&lt;br /&gt;Nice attachments&lt;br /&gt;Light weight&lt;br /&gt;Good battery life&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives:&lt;br /&gt;Precision grooming head required multiple passes&lt;br /&gt;lack of storage pouch</li>
    <li> Pretty good for stubble. Would recommend If on sale.</li>
    <li> Not quite as high quality as expected. Didn&#x27;t arrive when prime said it would. Bought better one locally. Kept this one as backup.</li>
    <li> Totally does the Job intended I mean it started out all bushy and with one whack of this trimmer is down with my hedge!!!</li>
    <li> Nice product works as advertise Three stars because no case for parts..Cheaper at WalMart....</li>
    <li> Purchased this to replace an older Phillips Norelco that I&#x27;ve finally worn the attachments out on.  So far it holds a charge very well, and the attachments work quite well.  My old trimmer had an &amp;#34;electric shaver&amp;#34; attachment and this one does not, which is my only real gripe (I have a minor problem with the lack of a shaver stand that would hold/charge the shaver like my old one had, but for the price I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a fair problem).  Overall very happy with the purchase, and would buy one again.</li>
    <li> Works so well why spend more. This is an incredible value. It&#x27;s also super compact, the unit and the charger. And water resistant so you can rinse under the sink. Only downside is there&#x27;s no full charge indicator so you just kind of have to guess.</li>
    <li> Works as expected.  Not particularly sturdy, but does the job.</li>
    <li> yep thats what it all boils down to. it works though! decent product for under 20 bucks! maybe if it wasnt so ugly now.....</li>
    <li> Seems to be working great.....  good size, easy to use and clean.</li>
    <li> as it is described by the seller, the product is excellent</li>
    <li> The only negative point so far is that the product does not come with a bag or something to put it on.</li>
    <li> Good product, easy to use. Good price.</li>
    <li> Item is great works perfect recharges great with many atachments. And cheaper then you can buy at walmart for exact same item. And ships fast  got the product within 6 days worth the wait!!</li>
    <li> no complaints, does the job</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift, my husband loves the ease and different settings</li>
    <li> No complaints. It does what it needs to do!</li>
    <li> Works great! Love the different attachments.</li>
    <li> I love it Defriend tip best thing they&#x27;ve been</li>
    <li> Very nice.  Holds a charge for a long time.</li>
    <li> So far so good. It trims my beard.</li>
    <li> I have another groomer which is a twenty dollar special from one of the local box stores, and it functions okay. My biggest complaint is that the edges of the blade weren&#x27;t properly protected. All to frequently, when gliding over your skin, the edge would grab, with the blades running and make quite a mess. Sometimes the skin grab was robust enough to stop the blades, other times it just cut you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None of those problems have been exhibited yet with this Norelco groomer. The attachments move freely over your skin and the adjustment depth makes sense, as it reads the cut length in millimeters. One of my complaints is that it does have the five attachments. These attachments are hard to keep track of. At the very least give us a bag to keep everything in, the charger, the five attachments and the device itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ability to rinse the head off under running water is a nice touch to remove all the loose hairs before putting it into storage. I would recommend this groomer to anyone.</li>
    <li> I am a female and bought it because I have sensitive skin and get ingrown hairs a lot, so I switched to this and have been very please, gets hair close and easy to clean! way better than what&#x27;s available for females!</li>
    <li> So far, so good.  Been using this for a few weeks and it&#x27;s what I expected.  The attachments are nice and the price was great. I&#x27;m sure there are much higher quality ones out there, but this price quality combination is very good.</li>
    <li> A tad TOO well. I have not quite mastered the deft touch necessary, as this little powerhouse will buzz through about anything. But it does a great job, quickly and efficiently churning through a thick wiry beard and mustache. Does precisely what you want, in a nice all-in-one package. And no batteries to decompose!</li>
    <li> Works exceptionally well. I figured I&#x27;d buy this one really quick till I could get my husband a better one, but he loves it. It has more than enough settings an attachments.</li>
    <li> Kool shaver not bad at all</li>
    <li> Works Good, would have been better if there was a base to put all the attachments on.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. i like it :)</li>
    <li> not sure about all the low star reviews. for 20 bucks you get all in one unit and it works like it should. charge it for 10-16 hours and you got 30-45 minutes of use. plenty of setting for the perfect trim.</li>
    <li> Works great, easy to use.</li>
    <li> Works good and has good attachments. Kinda cheap but overall have no complaints.. Cant beat it for the price that&#x27;s for sure!</li>
    <li> A good value for multiple functions</li>
    <li> Not the best, but I got it for $15, which is a steal. Works fine, but it doesn&#x27;t contain a bag to hold all the accessories. Definitely a buy if you can get it for cheap.</li>
    <li> Great product. I wish I could buy the one with more options and trimmer heads though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m working on it.  I think I&#x27;ll like it when I learn how to use it.</li>
    <li> As others have already written about the major features and limitations of this trimmer, I am only adding that the current (7/2014) product sold directly from amazon comes with a charger that accepts 100-240v. I use this now as a cheap travel trimmer when I travel abroad and leave my more expensive one at home. The previous g370 that was in a similar price range came with an US only power adapter.</li>
    <li> Great deal for the money ! I have the same in Europe - but there for this money package are not include extra stuff inside the box.&lt;br /&gt;I like it</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s what you don&#x27;t get. When it said beard and head trimmer with ear and nose attachment that was what I wanted and I didn&#x27;t really study the photos in detail. Besides, they&#x27;re not in scale so it wouldn&#x27;t have done much good. I already have a small battery trimmer that I&#x27;ve been using for years on my mustache but that&#x27;s all it can do and is dying so it was time to replace it. I also needed something for my ears and nose so this kit seemed to be what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WRONG. This kit is for hair only with the separate ear and nose attachment. It has two separate clipper attachments but only the large one has any plastic adjustable length combs. The small one. which would be the one you&#x27;d want for beard, mustache, sideburns and any other small precision jobs has no length attachments which makes it useless except for edging unless you want to try to trim your beard or mustache with a comb in one hand, the trimmer in the other while working from a mirror image.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What really makes me boiling mad is that the missing attachments are shown on the instruction sheet but only for model QG3331. Two combs and a draw string carry bag. Absolutely not a dollars worth of plastic and fabric. The indestructible blister pack that the whole kit was packaged in cost more than that. I need the two missing combs to make this kit useful to me and there is no way to get them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless your intent is to cut your own hair, buy a different kit. It won&#x27;t be useful for your beard, mustache, chest, pits or any other hair on your body that you&#x27;d like to keep trimmed. And I&#x27;d stay away from Norelco products just because they&#x27;re dumb enough to market this useless kit when for another dollar it really could have been an all in one. What idiots.</li>
    <li> Very happy with it, holding charge for me has been no issue (I followed manufacturer guidelines). Quality is good and price was great!</li>
    <li> This is the best bang for your  buck.  It does exactly what  the trimmer is suppose to do precisely and effortlessly.</li>
    <li> Still getting use to the length adjustment, close trim, battery last weeks.</li>
    <li> I was expecting it Friday and it came Tuesday. So the shipping was incredibly fast. Can&#x27;t wait to try it out</li>
    <li> Great groomer, just would have liked a case for all the parts.  I had to order one separately.  My son uses it mostly for trimming his beard and nose and ear hairs.  Haven&#x27;t heard any complaints, so it must be doing the job it was intended!  I use it for trimming the short hairs on the back of my neck because I have a short hair style.  Works great for me too!</li>
    <li> He is so delighted with all it&#x27;s utilities.  He is at that stage where grooming is part of his &#x60;cool&#x27; - lol.  This razor he finds very easy to use whether he is shaving his cheeks or working on styling his sideburns or grooming his neckline to the precise length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anything that can make a teenager take an interest in his appearance is good. Getting a hug and a kiss and a big smile make this a keeper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Norelco!</li>
    <li> Works great. Charge lasts a long time. I lost electric while buzzing my head with a regular trimmer and I was able to finish with this trimmer with plenty of juice left. I was able to make the fundraiser on time.</li>
    <li> DiD everything it promised</li>
    <li> Bought for my son to trim his beard and it was so easy to use he gave himself a buzz cut. Looked great</li>
    <li> Tried tested and true.&lt;br /&gt;I used the grooming shears to shave my entire head to test its durability and it cut right through better than actual hair clippers I&#x27;ve owned before.&lt;br /&gt;The trimmers are great for various facial hair lengths, but the way they&#x27;re built hair can get trapped inside some and you have to take it off periodically to clean it out to trim right.&lt;br /&gt;The nose and ear hair trimmers are really nice.&lt;br /&gt;It holds a charge good (so far) and doesn&#x27;t take long to charge up after being used. Even when used to shave my head it did not die out, dull down, or slow down from prolonged use. I did my whole head, then my facial hair, cleaned it up, and it was still kicking before I plugged it up to charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ONLY downside is that it does NOT come with a stand or a bag. Just the box and plastic bin. So you might want to buy a bag for this if you&#x27;ve ordered it or want to.</li>
    <li> Works very well but the blade guides are springy</li>
    <li> Used quite a few times till now. Working as expected. As usual delivery is awesome.</li>
    <li> Item description said this was made in the USA.  Important to me.  Got it and it&#x27;s actually made in Indonesia.  I felt like I was lied to.  Back it goes.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my sons new overgrown beard. He uses it daily works great. Another one of those unexpected items for the price. Heavy duty little unit</li>
    <li> Good quality product with all accessories.</li>
    <li> Well, this worked just fine, but,... by the time we went to charge it, we realized the charger did not work and our 30 day window to return it had run out. I cant believe he wants to try it again! But this time we will just have to run it out of charge and try recharging it before our 30 day window runs out. I tried to get a response to this from the company by posting a question on the Amazon page fore the product, but I did not get an answer. I do have to say that Amazon itself really stepped up, and provided EXCELLENT customer service.</li>
    <li> Great product, reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Very comfortable even when I shave my face using the  bare cutting head.  Really light and surprisingly plenty of power for a rechargeable.</li>
    <li> Love all the attachments and has a good battery life.</li>
    <li> great trimmer for a great price. Gives an up close and personal trim. Very easy to use.</li>
    <li> work well, everything is fine</li>
    <li> Awesome attachments, easy to use. Be a bit careful with the nose trimmer if you&#x27;re a beginner - I was careless and banged it around in there and gave myself some nice swelling. Love it so far though!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my grandfather and he liked that it has so many different attachments.</li>
    <li> all that for low price .. perfect :)</li>
    <li> Trimmer has many attachments and does a good job, the motor sound fluctuates but the performance is the same. Good trimmer for the price.</li>
    <li> not too powerfull, gets the job done, could shave a little closer on shortest setting</li>
    <li> Effective at doing what you need it to do, i only wish it came with some kind of holder/stand for the groomer and its attachments. My previous Norelco served me several years and I hope this one holds up as well.</li>
    <li> The Philips Norelco has been the best trimmer that I have ever purchased!</li>
    <li> Does its job easy to clean</li>
    <li> Nice item, it works ok</li>
    <li> Its a descent trimmer don&#x27;t like the cheap plastic settings on this though.</li>
    <li> It was everything I hoped it would be (except there is no case to hold the accessories etc). Other than that, it just what I needed and I&#x27;ve used it many times - with the precision I was hoping for. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> works great and hold a long charge</li>
    <li> Keeping the beard nice.</li>
    <li> Simple and cheap, gets the job done. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> A great shaver for its price. Can use it plugged or have it charged overnight and use it the next day for around 30 mins. (I don&#x27;t shave that long but just an estimate for the times I use it before I charge it again.) And if you want to use it down under. well, you can use the trimmers depending on the length you want. Just use it slowly and carefully to avoid any cuts. For a good grooming for its value, this is a great product.</li>
    <li> Excelent Product! I would by again and again!</li>
    <li> Poor design. The comb cap that fits over the blades to adjust the height of cut has teeth as sharp as needles. I suffered a large puncture wound as a result. Don&#x27;t waste your money. Remington makes a far better product for a very similar price.</li>
    <li> Great for trimming even without attachments. Doesn&#x27;t scratch my skin.</li>
    <li> I agree with the other one star reviewer that I can&#x27;t believe how many high ratings this product has! I had another base model Norelco groomer that worked fine, but the head comb broke, so I thought I&#x27;d give this new model a try. This model honestly felt like it was pulling and chewing on my face. Where my previous model cut a clean row and left hair trimmings, this groomer just gnaws at the hair leaving fine powder-like hair mulch. With just a few passes, you look terrible with uneven patches everywhere, so you have to make around 25 passes before it is even close to uniform. 25 passes is bad enough from a time standpoint, but add the fact that this is terribly painful and you&#x27;re in for a real treat.</li>
    <li> Use every week works great every attachment</li>
    <li> I wish I ordered this years ago. I was trimming with scissors like a savage</li>
    <li> I would have liked a stand for all the bits and pieces but it gives a very smooth touch and works like a marvel.</li>
    <li> This is really one great trimmer.</li>
    <li> Nice and powerful.  Getting the shield right is going to be a challenge.  The first trimming was almost a disaster!  The instructions weren&#x27;t as clear as I might have hoped.  But I&#x27;ll figure it out.  The price, of course, is the best feature!</li>
    <li> My husband has used a few different trimmers to manage his signature \\&quot;chin strap\\&quot; but I have never heard so many positive comments about one before I gave him this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He has told me his favorite feature are the included \\&quot;style guards\\&quot; that allow him to make his beard look \\&quot;longer than stubbley\\&quot; but still neat. He has also used the attached guards on his sideburns and eyebrows to keep them trimmed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He has also reported that \\&quot;for the first time\\&quot; he has had the guts to put a rotary nose hair trimmer up his nose. To his surprise it did not yank or pull any of his nose hair and now he uses it all the time to trim his nose hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This trimmer comes with a few guards that stay in the drawer, but I can tell by the mess he leaves on our bathroom sink that he really likes this product and uses it regularly.</li>
    <li> Great price love the product .</li>
    <li> This shaver is amazing it feels so good using it and when on is so silent. Great product</li>
    <li> very nice but I have thought wrong that dedication of this item kkk&lt;br /&gt;i don&#x27;t need gala shaving machine . Indeed I need only shaver because of my too much shave,&lt;br /&gt;its my mistake . I have to read the description completely .</li>
    <li> NO BASE TO STORE PARTS  THE PLASTIC LINNER IS FOR THAT PURPOSE BUT REQUIRES A BIT OF SPACE I DONT HAVE THAT MUCH SPACE  AS FAR AS PERFORMANCE  ITS OK</li>
    <li> love it can shave and leave stubble which i do prefer  easy handling</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your Money</li>
    <li> Great for ear and nose hairs, really does a great job.</li>
    <li> Product runs smoothly, set up process is easy. I use it for facial hair, body hair and the trimmers work pretty well on my head  well for a good close shave or fade. Comes in good packaging and includes charger.</li>
    <li> Seems pretty good, just learning the adjustments and lengths - but seems like a good product, cuts pretty well.</li>
    <li> It is a pretty good product and it is quite worth the price.</li>
    <li> Only used it a couple of times, but it is exactly what I wanted.  I had a full beard, over an inch.  The lowest setting took it down to a five o&#x27;clock shadow.  Didn&#x27;t expect it to work that well.  Used the precision trimmer to sculpt a goatee.  Worked great.  Did not pull on the hair one bit.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m more well-groomed than I&#x27;ve ever been before, thanks to this.</li>
    <li> This is a Great Trimmer, Battery works well, Satisfied customer...</li>
    <li> I have a Wahl trimmer and the biggest issue with that is that their blades are some sort of metal and the biggest issue with that is after three uses it begins to rust. This one has nothing like that. Great design. Great product. For $15 you can&#x27;t really get any better of a trimmer product.</li>
    <li> Prefect trimmer with better replaceable heads. The one thing would be nice if it came with a &#x27;box&#x27; instead to have to keep the packing as box.</li>
    <li> Very good product.  I like it for my beard.  Many cutting options and it holds it charge very well.  When I get my neck trimmed there is no red irritating marks.  For the price, this is a great choice.  100% recommend.  4 stars because it thought it came with a case.</li>
    <li> I suggest basically always using the larger plastic guard as tilting too much with the other will go shorter than the intended length. It is also better if you take the clipper a bit south as it will make it easier to keep a consistent length.</li>
    <li> great stuff... works awesome...</li>
    <li> I love these trimmers. They are inexpensive, durable and don&#x27;t need oil. I&#x27;ve turned my friends onto them and they love it too. I ordered two of these in this order, one for travel and one to keep at home. The previous one I had lasted two years before the blades got a little dull and I travelled all over the world with them. Inexpensive enough to drop and break if it happened. Also, the battery life on these is amazing.</li>
    <li> Bought this to shave my head it works great. I like all the different settings.</li>
    <li> Keeps my pubs nice and trim</li>
    <li> the charging wire is totally burnt in the package.</li>
    <li> Bought this mainly for the stubble attachment as I like to take a break from shaving every once and a while and it&#x27;s a pain to shave after growing half a beard.  Works great and hold a charge well.</li>
    <li> its a good product but sent with a defective nose trimmer part its not even working at all...</li>
    <li> Bought one of these from Amazon, used it 3 times, then it quit. Would not work at all. Thought I just got a bad one, as I don&#x27;t need a heavy use one. Bought another on sale from a local store and I used it twice. Twice and it will not even turn on. I have no idea how some of these people are getting this POS to work for more  than a week.</li>
    <li> works.  good battery life.</li>
    <li> It is an awesome product at the price it is offered.</li>
    <li> I had that cheap 14$ wahl razor before and it would always pull my hair and was a pain to clean. This thing is much better for a few bucks more. Trims pretty well. Im not sure how all the extra pieces would work at actually cutting your hair if you&#x27;re using it for that though. It doesn&#x27;t seem like it&#x27;s that powerful for a full haircut. To shave some underhair or facial hair it gets the job done pretty well though,</li>
    <li> Trim head, armpits, pubes, it&#x27;s all good!</li>
    <li> The trimmer came charged. It has ample power and nice attachments. I hope it lasts as most of the trimmers I&#x27;ve bought didn&#x27;t last more than a couple of months.</li>
    <li> Great product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pretty good, but cant be used wired, and dont bring a bag or something to carry it, beyond that its pretty nice (:</li>
    <li> This shaver is perfect...the charge lasts forever and allows for exact trim lengths to the mm...</li>
    <li> Trimmer was delivered when promised &amp; works well.</li>
    <li> It does what it is supposed to do. Doesn&#x27;t look super sturdy and I the battery usually runs out on the cheaper trimmers. Value for the price I paid for it for sure.</li>
    <li> Absolute piece of garbage.  Received this item in early November 2014.  It&#x27;s Mid-January 2015 and it&#x27;s already dead.  I used it maybe 3-4 times tops.</li>
    <li> Great product, battery last surprisingly long and cuts great. Definitely a must buy.</li>
    <li> This works perfectly and you can&#x27;t beat the price. The length adjuster is easy to use and is a good design.</li>
    <li> I play trumpet and like my moustache trimmed back on my upper lip. Trying to do that with a normal shaver was very difficult, but with this one it is easy.  Great product for trimming a moustache or beard.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> My other half likes this a lot. Uses it to trim his beard before a wet shave. And I trim the edges after a haircut with it.</li>
    <li> loved it.&lt;br /&gt;be careful down there though.</li>
    <li> Battery doesnt drain off soon.Easy to use.Liked it.</li>
    <li> What I expected. Works perfectly well. Battery lasts me a week or two. Good purchase!</li>
    <li> The device is OK but its box is too thin to actually keep the various components together.</li>
    <li> It works, but is a very poor design.  To remove hair from under the comb, you have to slide off the clear plastic comb and length assembly, blow it out, then carefully align and slide it back into the little slots, making sure to set it on the same length setting as before.  Had I known they designed it this way, I never would have bought it.  The last Norelco I owned had a comb on a pop-up hinge, so it took only a couple of seconds to blow out the hair and continue using it.  And I didn&#x27;t have to worry about the length setting each time I cleaned it.  I assumed this product would be the same, but noooooooo!  This thing is a pain in the backside by comparison!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more thing, the clear plastic comb/adjustment has a little \\&quot;ratchet\\&quot; on it for the length adjustment, which I think will wear out quickly because of constantly sliding the thing on and off.  That is to say, a little piece of plastic which makes a \\&quot;riiiiiiiip!\\&quot; sound when sliding it on or off.  Oh, and the length indicators are tiny and hard to see.  Even though I&#x27;m nearsighted (making close-up work easier), I have to look carefully at it each time I slide it back on.  Slide it too far, and ruin your beard--WHOOPS!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just learned it will not run plugged-in when the battery is dead.  To me this is the last straw.  1-Star!</li>
    <li> Pros: Can control trimming length in mms. Blade seems very sharp and cuts almost perfectly on the first pass. Battery is rechargable and battery life seems good (about 1 charge every month for me). Great value for the price.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Switching attachments is a little tricky, but becomes easier after a few tries. Cannot leave plugged in for over 12 hrs (con!) otherwise the battery life will suffer - so you have to remember to unplug it after charging, which is a little annoying.&lt;br /&gt;Overall: Blade is very sharp (pro and con if not careful!), the perfectionist inside me loves the control over trim length, but its a little annoying to have to remember to unplug it after charging, overall great trimmer for the money</li>
    <li> This Philips Norelco rechargeable grooming kit came my way at a good time, because I was trying to grow a short beard for the first time in my life (not just a goatee). Overall, it&#x27;s a well-rounded shaving kit that does a good job. Just remember, the \\&quot;all-in-one\\&quot; kit doesn&#x27;t contain an everyday razor that you can use for a general shave (though the included precision trimmer does a passable job of clearing off the stubble en masse).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, the biggest thing about this kit was learning how to use all the pieces -- it takes a while, especially if you&#x27;re like me and skim the directions. Interchanging the pieces can be a bit of a hassle when you&#x27;re trying to get ready in the morning, but it&#x27;s worth changing them out because each one does a solid job at what it&#x27;s designed to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like keeping my beard very short, so the \\&quot;stubble comb\\&quot; and \\&quot;beard trimmer\\&quot; pieces are the ones I often use. The stubble comb slides into a groove on the back of the razor and offers lengths of one through 12, with one being the closest shave. You&#x27;ll want to angle the comber on your face so that it cuts to the length you selected, something I didn&#x27;t figure out right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you with lengthier beards, the \\&quot;beard and mustache comb\\&quot;/\\&quot;beard trimmer\\&quot; combo is the one you&#x27;ll want to use. The latter piece slides into the aforementioned grooves on the shaver in the same way as the stubble comb, offering shaving lengths of one through 18. Using this piece at level one gives my beard and sideburns the stubble length I like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smaller precision trimmer does an excellent job of outlining your facial hair and tidying up those outlying areas. Be careful with this piece; it&#x27;s sharp and I cut myself with it a few times. You can also use the full-size trimmer for the same purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kit also includes a \\&quot;nose/ear hair trimmer\\&quot; attachment that works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The waterproof feature is a nice touch that helps prevent too much hair accumulation on the pieces. Be sure to rinse off the attachments before you take them off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver holds its charge for 35 minutes after charging for 10 hours, and it isn&#x27;t overly loud. Overall, when I compare this grooming kit to the clunky, battery-operated Wahl stubble trimmer I own, there really is no comparison. The most important advice I can offer regarding this kit is to use all of the included components to see what works best for you. After getting used to the various functions, you&#x27;ll see that this is a well-rounded grooming kit that accommodates a multitude of facial hair styles.lation on the pieces.

    <li> Phillips Norelco Multigroom Trimmer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have owned two older models of a Norelco trimmer (model G370). Neither one had as powerful a motor as the Multigroom. It also seems as if the Multigroom holds on to its charge longer too ... even taking into account the fact the my existing G370 is about 2 to 3 years old. I can still remember how long one charge would last and the Multigroom is far superior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can keep my beard even and neat which should be a given for any serviceable trimmer. The Multigroom&#x27;s nose hair trimmer is great. Must have something to do with the motor spinning faster because it seems to work faster and more efficiently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There ARE a few criticisms -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The G370 came with a comb - the Multigroom does not&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The G370 has a nice stand for each attachment as well as the ability to stand the unit up and charge it right in the stand. The Multigroom has some thin plastic stand that looks like colored blister wrap. There IS a place for each attachment but you can not charge the trimmer while it is in the stand. The stand just looks like an afterthought or like someone decided to cut corners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros -&lt;br /&gt;- holds on to a charge a long time&lt;br /&gt;- easy to change out attachments&lt;br /&gt;- easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;- faster and more powerful motor&lt;br /&gt;- comfortable and solid feel (it doesn&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re using a toy)&lt;br /&gt;- feels like I can do a more professional-looking job now&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons -&lt;br /&gt;- No comb with the attachments&lt;br /&gt;- Stand for the trimmer and attachments looks cheap and like an afterthought&lt;br /&gt;- Can not easily charge the trimmer in the stand.</li>
    <li> For the money, it&#x27;s good enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I docked a star because the build quality and the add/remove procedure for the facial hair comb is kinda flimsy. The adjustment mechanism is great. But it&#x27;s kinda flimsy.</li>
    <li> Easy to change out attachments, easy to clean, multi groom, perfect trimmer.</li>
    <li> It works good but accessories suck... :(</li>
    <li> I got this for my boyfriend.  He absolutely loves it and now grooms himself way more often.  I love it.  He said it works great with all the adapters.  I would strongly recommend this for your men, ladies.</li>
    <li> I bought this item for my boyfriend and he loves it.</li>
    <li> Was a little leery of the product because of the price. Thought it would be a throw away product, but it has lasted and the battery life is pretty incredible.</li>
    <li> Very well made and a great value. It takes a little time to figure out which settings tirm to the desired length, but does a great job. The various attachments are excellent.</li>
    <li> Awsome.  Buy it.  I did a lot of research and this one was the best for not very much money.  It turns out it is!</li>
    <li> How is everyone rating this POS in the positive? I picked up this waste of plastic on the road because I left my good one at home. I felt like it was ripping my face off. Stubble on my face all came out different lengths (same setting: 6) and finally had to clean shave. BS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor and drop the few extra bucks for a higher end model. This isn&#x27;t worth the $20 I spent.</li>
    <li> For the price, this is a terrific buy.</li>
    <li> Good value for money. You wont get a clean shave but if you are looking for a economical way to groom your beard and hair then this is the way to go.</li>
    <li> excellent product for the price</li>
    <li> Fantastic Value!! Does the job brilliantly - Just need to be a bit more careful that usual when it comes to tricky areas since the attachments aren&#x27;t the greatest. Aside from that no complaints at all</li>
    <li> Works great.  Good value.</li>
    <li> Feels relatively cheap but it does its job without a problem...my onli con is they coulda at least include a pouch or somethin to store it but for the price i cant complain</li>
    <li> This is pretty straight forward. It&#x27;s a decent trimmer at a good price.</li>
    <li> OK so I read the reviews before purchasing. and frankly thee were other products that were rated a bit higher but those were much more expensive.&lt;br /&gt;I took a chance. I&#x27;m glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;My old, cheap, $10 AA battery trimmer had worn out. I&#x27;m pretty cheap and if something simply works and is low cost I usually stick with it.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what got into me and made me step up to the plate and spend $17 this time.&lt;br /&gt;But I must emphatically say this product is infinitely better than my old cheap, battery operated trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;It is powerful, rechargeable, and has an attachment for all my needs. The battery charge lasts me at least 30 days between charging.&lt;br /&gt;It seems solid and well made. BTW the white stuff inside the attachment that another reviewer thought was glue is actually white grease. That is the spot where the motor arm contacts the blade holder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just struggled for a couple hours figuring out how to attach the depth adjustment. I&#x27;m not stupid. I operate and troubleshoot a complicated $50 million machine at work. But could I figure out how to attach the depth adjuster on a $17 machine? Nope.&lt;br /&gt;So after some frustration I sat it aside for a week. It sat on the vanity taunting and reminding me just how unbearably arrogant at work I must be.&lt;br /&gt;Eventually when I felt like I could handle failing a task. One that everyone else on Amazon.com who purchased this accomplished.  Fearful of having an emotional meltdown, I bravely decided to go into that small dark, windowless room and confront my newest nemesis.  In a short period of time I won the battle. I rode that wild stallion until it finally succumbed to my superior intellect and mechanical skills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, with humility I will be generous and share the knowledge for free that I so dearly suffered for. Are you ready?&lt;br /&gt;OK, move in close. Can you read this clearly? I am only gonna say this once.&lt;br /&gt;You hold the shaver in one hand. Then you grasp the depth adjustment plasticpiece in the other hand. Now you slide the edges of the plastic piece into the corresponding slots in the shaver.... You&#x27;re welcome.</li>
