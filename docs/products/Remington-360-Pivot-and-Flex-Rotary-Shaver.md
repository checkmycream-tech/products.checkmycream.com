      <li>The shave I got with this razor was acceptable, but not that good.  </li>
      <li>This was good.</li>
      <li>Good value.</li>
      <li>I wanted to get one that was a good one.</li>
      <li>good shaver.</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t know how it works, but it&#x27;s good.</li>
      <li>Maybe would be good for using to get rid of weeds in your garden.  </li>
      <li>He has been needing a cordless razor for awhile now and this one fit the bill perfectly.</li>
      <li>Still, it is a good buy for the price.</li>
      <li>I just float it over the beard and it works better!</li>
      <li>Great product for a cheap price.</li>
      <li>Nothing too fancy here but perfectly serviceable electric razor for a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>Seems to be a well made shaver and produces a nice, close shave.  </li>
      <li>He&#x27;s so thrilled with this unit he asked me to provide him with the link for it</li>
      <li>The pop up trimmer gives you a nice finish as well just that you have to trim downwards.</li>
      <li>but after that this is the best i have ever owned, it gets in close and does it very well</li>
      <li>He likes it as well and said it gave him a nice close shave.  </li>
      <li>Very nice, It gives you a smooth finish.</li>
      <li>It is ideal as a first shaver given its value.</li>
      <li>This razor is super great.</li>
      <li>He loves it and I would recommend it as a great first razor!</li>
      <li>Very comfortable shave.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know for sure what the difference is</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t get as close as a disposable, but seems to take more time to get all the stubbles.</li>
      <li>Love Remington products.</li>
      <li>Great razor, I really like it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s</li>
      <li>and I love</li>
      <li>He loves it and we love that it&#x27;s safer for him.</li>
      <li>For the price I can&#x27;t imagine a better electric razor.  </li>
      <li>Even at this &#x27;bargain&#x27; price point, I think there are better razors available.</li>
      <li>The battery life is superb, its lightweight, and gives me (I have a fairly light facial hair growth) a smooth shave.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so easy to use.</li>
      <li>How easy you ask?</li>
      <li>So, it was important that it works, he can hold it comfortably, and most important he can turn it on and off with his arthritic and Parkinsons hands.  </li>
      <li>seems to work fine, but very noisy, it would have been nice if you could use it cordless AND corded</li>
      <li>easy to clean as well.</li>
      <li>The charging cord light does not go off, so you can&#x27;t tell when the razor is fully charged.</li>
      <li>kinda cool having such a great razor.</li>
      <li>first, the shave was smooth and pain free.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t work as a corded shaver when the battery is drained, but it seems to recharge quickly.</li>
      <li>All I know is the battery is junk, I&#x27;m lucky to get a 5 minute shave off of one</li>
      <li>Good blades, easy to clean and isn&#x27;t heavy.</li>
      <li>He said it was fast and easy and for work it was find</li>
      <li>If you miss a day shaving, this machine will exact its revenge!  </li>
      <li>Great little cordless razor.</li>
      <li>Thanks to the manual not even including any details at all about the charging light, I have no idea what it means.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s light, so it feels very flimsy.</li>
      <li>I spent many, many hours pouring over the internet looking for a razor that had a slide on/off switch that was also inexpensive.  </li>
      <li>The trimmer is OK too, a bit too wide for my uses but others may find it OK.</li>
      <li>My husband helped him set it up and give it that first initial charge and he&#x27;s been using it on his own since.</li>
      <li>I enjoy the cordless aspect of this shaver, but it does seem to be made more cheaply than the previous Remington shaver I used.  </li>
      <li>I love the hand ergonomics and the general feel.</li>
      <li>They are affordable, easy to use and clean, and last for years.</li>
      <li>the good side, the internal battery charges quickly and holds a charge for over a week with daily shaving.  </li>
      <li>But I would not use it more then a week without recharging and there are plenty of choices for extra blades &amp; cleaning supplies on the web site for Remington</li>
      <li>It makes smooth my old , weather beaten face and neck.</li>
      <li>Working very well for me and worth the money</li>
      <li>The most hair-pulling was on the 1-day&#x27;s growth, for some reason, but again, not a big problem for me.</li>
      <li>Works best with minimal pressure, heavy pressure seems to make it less effective.</li>
      <li>It holds a charge well and gives you a good shave without having to push hard against your skin like some others.</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t know how well</li>
      <li>Unpaid plug for Remington</li>
      <li>He absolutely loves it.  </li>
      <li>I am blonde with a light beard.  </li>
      <li>This is a no frills shaver that performs very well.</li>
      <li>however, it cuts very well, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
      <li>It does feel light and plasticy but, after all, it&#x27;s practically a throw-away shaver at these low prices.</li>
      <li>I bought this for my hubby for Christmas and he really loves it.</li>
      <li>I really like the shave and the convenience of being able to walk around or use it in the shower for even a closed shave.  </li>
      <li>If you live by electric razors and can do without the minor irritation, then skip and get a better shaver.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m getting more out of this budget razor than I expected!</li>
      <li>The replacement blades for it  cost almost as much as this new razor.  </li>
      <li>I replaced an older Norelco 725RL with this unit.  </li>
      <li>A very light touch the first few passes seems to mow it down fine without irritation and pulling.</li>
      <li>It had a few perks, it cuts fairly close, and you don&#x27;t have to go over the same place more than a few</li>
      <li>After trying my dad&#x27;s razor at home, I was surprised by how much easier (and faster)</li>
      <li>I get a much closer shave with my old razor than this new one.  </li>
      <li>- I just buy new shavers.  </li>
      <li>I do not buy new blades</li>
      <li>Perhaps that is why no guard is supplied as Remington hopes to make its profit from your purchasing a new head.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>The flex of the head seems like a cheap imitation of the face-following articulation of higher-quality razors.  </li>
      <li>The shaver cuts better than its price would imply and it is easy enough to replace should it get broken.</li>
      <li>his last Remington shaver finally saw its last days after daily use for last 7 years so when I saw this shaver almost exactly what he had before I was thrilled yet sceptical...</li>
      <li>I bought one for my sixteen year old \\&quot;new shaver\\&quot; son to get him started.  </li>
      <li>I have a new set of HQ-55 heads for the old Norelco on order now, which is what prompted me to write this review.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s hard to get much more from a sixteen year old boy</li>
      <li>I waited until after three months to complete my review.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
      <li>but when he takes me out on dinner dates and to church he will use is old razor</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Hubby likes it, no problems, works extremely well. No more 5 o clock shadow.</li>
    <li> Looks better on the pictures, poor quality / performance.</li>
    <li> This is a recurring lesson in &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34;.  This cheapie gives a marginal shave and the on off switch is difficult to work with one hand.  You can&#x27;t tell when the charge is getting low except if you notice the power has lessened while you are shaving.  There is no indicator that lets you know when it is fully charged.</li>
    <li> Got this for my Dad as a &amp;#34;backup&amp;#34;.  Turns out by &amp;#34;backup&amp;#34; he meant every other day.  So, it was important that it works, he can hold it comfortably, and most important he can turn it on and off with his arthritic and Parkinsons hands.  I spent many, many hours pouring over the internet looking for a razor that had a slide on/off switch that was also inexpensive.  This is it!</li>
    <li> This razor is super great. It&#x27;s so easy to use. How easy you ask? Easy enough for my legally blind 92 year old grandfather to use every day. We bought this for him as a Christmas gift when he started having trouble with his safety razor. He was knicking his face and missing sections of beard but was too independent to let us help him so we decided to get this razor. My husband helped him set it up and give it that first initial charge and he&#x27;s been using it on his own since. He loves it and we love that it&#x27;s safer for him. We got it for a great price to boot.</li>
    <li> As usual Remington have come up trumps</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ll see how it holds up but, for the money, this is the best electric I&#x27;ve ever had. A great value.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s light, so it feels very flimsy. however, it cuts very well, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. easy to clean as well.</li>
    <li> I ordered this razor to replace a ten year old Norelco that will no longer hold a charge.  The replacement blades for it  cost almost as much as this new razor.  Now I know why.  Since this isn&#x27;t horseshoes or hand grenades, close does count.  I get a much closer shave with my old razor than this new one.  I followed all of the cleaning and lubrication instructions but still had stubble after two hours and needed to shave again by noon.  I am blonde with a light beard.  I sent it back to the manufacturer for a refund and will write the cost of mailing off as a lesson learned.</li>
    <li> It good for me, however it cut me a few times and gave me a few bumps on my legs</li>
    <li> Bought this electric shaver to replace my ancient old one. It had a few perks, it cuts fairly close, and you don&#x27;t have to go over the same place more than a few times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It pulls. Bad. Like, real bad. No matter how slow I go or how short the hairs are, it ALWAYS PULLS. Really freaking annoying. The pop-out part BARELY works, it doesn&#x27;t cut close at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, it broke after a mere month and a half of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Terrible, don&#x27;t buy.</li>
    <li> I bought it for friend&#x27;s birthday gift, packaging is very delicate, and he also was like, Easy to use thanks!</li>
    <li> For the price I can&#x27;t imagine a better electric razor.  The battery life is superb, its lightweight, and gives me (I have a fairly light facial hair growth) a smooth shave.</li>
    <li> Great little cordless razor. It pulls the hairs a little, so go slowly and don&#x27;t put a lot of pressure on it.</li>
    <li> The shave I got with this razor was acceptable, but not that good.  The flex of the head seems like a cheap imitation of the face-following articulation of higher-quality razors.  After trying my dad&#x27;s razor at home, I was surprised by how much easier (and faster) it was to shave with his $70 Norelco, so I went out and bought myself one of those.  Even at this &#x27;bargain&#x27; price point, I think there are better razors available.</li>
    <li> Seems to be a well made shaver and produces a nice, close shave.  It works well on my beard, which is on the heavy side.  It doesn&#x27;t work as a corded shaver when the battery is drained, but it seems to recharge quickly.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this product. It is easy to use and works well with his thick hair. It works great!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t think any shaver on market can compare with all the requirements of good shaving. It makes smooth my old , weather beaten face and neck.</li>
    <li> Love Remington products. They are affordable, easy to use and clean, and last for years. I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a Remington shaver for the last 15 or so years.  I was happy with the shave I got from it so when I finally got tired of shaving with the cord I bought another Remington (the battery wore out on my old one during the last 6 months).  I kept my  old one and use it in my motorhome when camping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I shave every day or other day I get very little pull.  If I go a week, I do get some pull but by using a shave powder, it lessens it to a minimum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this shaver to others.</li>
    <li> I waited until after three months to complete my review.&lt;br /&gt;At first, the shave was smooth and pain free.  I replaced an older Norelco 725RL with this unit.  After pricing the replacement head for the Norelco, this shaver seemed like a bargain.  Well, after just two months the shaver head seems to have gotten very dull.  In fact, it is worse than the older shaver it replaced - with 20 year old heads (but only really used for about five years).  This razor makes me dread waking up in the morning knowing that I have to shave.  It pulls and yanks hairs out and leaves my face bumpy in some places.  If you miss a day shaving, this machine will exact its revenge!  Longer hairs will leave bloody spots where they were yanked out by the roots.  I was thinking that there was a reason why I was a little apprehensive about buying a Remington, and then I remembered why - there was an older Remington R 830 in our bathroom, hidden way in a back shelf, and it had tortured me the same way in the past, but due to the coping functions of the brain I must have forgotten that horrid experience.&lt;br /&gt;On the good side, the internal battery charges quickly and holds a charge for over a week with daily shaving.  it&#x27;s almost like it enjoys tearing your face up and keeps going, and going, while you are wincing in pain.&lt;br /&gt;Lesson learned - I have a new set of HQ-55 heads for the old Norelco on order now, which is what prompted me to write this review.  In fact, I also bought two of those little two-head Norelco travel razors (battery operated) which I use at work and in the RV.  They shave closer, they&#x27;re quieter,  and I&#x27;ll probably not need any transfusions after shaving either. (Philips Norelco PQ208/40 Travel Electric )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remington?  Never again.  Even if Victor Kiam were to appear at my door and try to convince me of the error of my ways!</li>
    <li> good shaver. poor design.  needs a stand to set it down.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend never used this before so I figure I would buy it for him. He said the shave was close just not as close as the regular throw away razors. He said it was fast and easy and for work it was find but when he takes me out on dinner dates and to church he will use is old razor</li>
    <li> This razor cut no better than the two-year old one which I wanted to replace. A real disappointment. I would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my hubby for Christmas and he really loves it. He has been needing a cordless razor for awhile now and this one fit the bill perfectly.</li>
    <li> Great razor, I really like it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s kinda cool having such a great razor. 10/10</li>
    <li> This is an inexpensive version of the Remington rotary shaving system.  I have used electric shavers for over 50 years and have used all the various types, from all the various manufacturers.  This shaver was poor, even for its low price.  I could only give it two stars for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;- It took twice as long to shave with this shaver than with others I have used recently and it gave only a mediocre shave, with quite a bit of irritation.  In fact I have put it in my discarded pile of shavers after only a week or so of use.&lt;br /&gt;- It does not come with a plastic cover to protect the shaving head.  This is not an expensive shaver, but it should have come with a cover, which might have added one or two cents to the cost.  Without it the heads can become scratched, causing them to cut and become useless.  Perhaps that is why no guard is supplied as Remington hopes to make its profit from your purchasing a new head.&lt;br /&gt;- The instruction book says to detach the head assembly for a complete cleaning, but does not explain how to do so.  There is a button open the assembly for daily, but no release button for the assembly as a whole.&lt;br /&gt;- There is no charging stand to facilitate charging.&lt;br /&gt;- I found the pivoting head to be a useless gimmick as I have a wrist that pivots and twists.  In fact I feel that the loose fitting rotary heads and loose assembly that are required to allow this pivoting and twisting waste power and may be the reason why the shaver does such a poor job.</li>
    <li> I bought the Remington R3-4110 from a different store five months ago and already the battery will not hold a charge. I always take care to fully discharge the battery before recharging in case they are NI-CAD and in this case it did not help. My charging light is green and just constantly pulses, whether it&#x27;s been charging for 1 minute or 18 hours. Thanks to the manual not even including any details at all about the charging light, I have no idea what it means. All I know is the battery is junk, I&#x27;m lucky to get a 5 minute shave off of one charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the quality of shave, I am not the finicky type but I must say after using several other rotary shavers, this one has to rank last in smoothness and I also find myself going over and over the same spots on my face to get it all shaved down evenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The warranty is a waste of time since I would have to pay to ship this jalopy back. Not worth it.</li>
    <li> Working very well for me and worth the money</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t know how well this works but it is a Remington which is the brand my husband uses and likes.  I got this for a tag on the Salvation Army Christmas tree for a teenage boy.  I wanted to get one that was a good one. I hope it is.</li>
    <li> This replaced an older Norelco which I never had any problems with until it finally gave up the ghost after about 5 years.  The blades on this are rough and uncomfortable causing irritation.  It&#x27;s made of really cheap plastic and has the worst AC charger connector of any electric device I have ever seen. Every time I use it or plug it in I am annoyed and reminded how cheap this is.</li>
    <li> seems to work fine, but very noisy, it would have been nice if you could use it cordless AND corded</li>
    <li> I enjoy the cordless aspect of this shaver, but it does seem to be made more cheaply than the previous Remington shaver I used.  Still, it is a good buy for the price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s  o k, but I think next time, I&#x27;m going to go with a different brand. I don&#x27;t think Remington is quite what it used to be.</li>
    <li> Very comfortable shave. Works best with minimal pressure, heavy pressure seems to make it less effective. I&#x27;m extremely happy with mine.</li>
    <li> I want to repeat my purchase.  I dropped it. What else can I sa.  I like the ravzor. I dropped it bit broke. I want t get another one</li>
    <li> Great shaver!!! Great Price!!! This is a no frills shaver that performs very well.</li>
    <li> it took a little getting used to but after that this is the best i have ever owned, it gets in close and does it very well</li>
    <li> Very nice, It gives you a smooth finish. I love the hand ergonomics and the general feel. The pop up trimmer gives you a nice finish as well just that you have to trim downwards. I do recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not very efficient to shave</li>
    <li> Nothing too fancy here but perfectly serviceable electric razor for a reasonable price. I like this product  understanding what I was purchasing and not expecting heavy duty or super high quality. Recommended!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my son who has started shaving. It is ideal as a first shaver given its value. The shaver cuts better than its price would imply and it is easy enough to replace should it get broken. He has been using it for the past couple of months with no complaints.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these two to  three years ago and it is still working and working well with only two blade cartridge changes.  It holds a charge well and gives you a good shave without having to push hard against your skin like some others. It cuts well even with a couple days growth and cuts rather than pulls if you are familiar with using an electric shaver when the hair is thick and long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on my like for this brand and model I bought one for my sixteen year old \\&quot;new shaver\\&quot; son to get him started.  He likes it as well and said it gave him a nice close shave.  It&#x27;s hard to get much more from a sixteen year old boy so this is a combo review between he and I.  I have chosen Remington products over others for years and like their quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy another razor like or very similar to this in the future and definitely a Remington.</li>
    <li> This was good. no problems</li>
    <li> Ok...purchased this as a Christmas gift for my roommate. He has problems with electric razors because he&#x27;s an african american with very coarse facial hair and most razors left him with long stubble or razor burn. I purchased this and he was skeptical but used it and said he had no razor burn and no stubble that he could feel...he said he had to apply no pressure and just let it glide over his skin...He&#x27;s so thrilled with this unit he asked me to provide him with the link for it so he could send one to all the men in his family...I played with it and the quality is very good..I recommend it to anyone...</li>
    <li> But I would not use it more then a week without recharging and there are plenty of choices for extra blades &amp; cleaning supplies on the web site for Remington</li>
    <li> came in with out problems</li>
    <li> My husbands beard grows thick and fast... his last Remington shaver finally saw its last days after daily use for last 7 years so when I saw this shaver almost exactly what he had before I was thrilled yet sceptical... well as usually it paid off... he loves then and I love the Snoop Dog look he gets when he&#x27;s done in the morning!!! Mmmm mmmm</li>
    <li> Great product for a cheap price. Good blades, easy to clean and isn&#x27;t heavy. Good to use in the shower!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have personal experience with this product because I bought it for my 14 year old son who needed to start shaving. He loves it and I would recommend it as a great first razor!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my grandfather so he could quit nicking himself while trying to shave with a regular razor.  He absolutely loves it.  It does take him a little longer but at least he&#x27;s not cutting up his face.</li>
    <li> I had a similar razor a decade ago and have been using disposables since. Returning to electric has a little adjusting period. It doesn&#x27;t get as close as a disposable, but seems to take more time to get all the stubbles. I anticipate my learning curve to reduce that time. No complaints. Wasn&#x27;t expecting a Ferrari for Dodge pricing.</li>
    <li> Good value. Good quality. Just what I was looking to replace an 8 year old Reminton.</li>
    <li> The charging cord light does not go off, so you can&#x27;t tell when the razor is fully charged.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t cut a single hair, just pulled them all out.  Maybe would be good for using to get rid of weeds in your garden.  If I could punch the creator of this in the face I would</li>
    <li> I have been buying these shavers for years now.  I really like the shave and the convenience of being able to walk around or use it in the shower for even a closed shave.  I do not buy new blades - I just buy new shavers.  It is actually less expensive to do it that way.</li>
    <li> I got the R-4110 at another store not the R-4110A listed here. I don&#x27;t know for sure what the difference is but it appears that the R-4110A has no built-in trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 Stars for price/performance. One star off for minor shaving irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the R-4110: I have a coarse, bristly beard. I tried it on 1,2, and 3-day&#x27;s growth. It does pull hairs slightly, but almost unnoticable for me. I assume that lighter beards would not feel anything at all. The most hair-pulling was on the 1-day&#x27;s growth, for some reason, but again, not a big problem for me. It cuts close, and for the price (mid-20&#x27;s) I can&#x27;t complain. The trimmer is OK too, a bit too wide for my uses but others may find it OK. If you live by electric razors and can do without the minor irritation, then skip and get a better shaver. It does feel light and plasticy but, after all, it&#x27;s practically a throw-away shaver at these low prices. If I get a few years out of it, I&#x27;ll have no compliants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: June 12, 2013&lt;br /&gt;The hair-pulling is gone! I was too aggressivly attacking my beard, pressing hard and scrubbing away with the shaver like I was cleaning tile. A very light touch the first few passes seems to mow it down fine without irritation and pulling. I just float it over the beard and it works better! After that I can press a little harder, but not very much.  I&#x27;m getting more out of this budget razor than I expected! 5 stars now due to price/performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: June 19, 2013&lt;br /&gt;The Remington Face Saver powder stick seems to help speed the cutting too, maybe even a closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how it works, but it&#x27;s good. Unpaid plug for Remington products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B002SO8IMS Pre-Shave Stick]]&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Remington-SP5-Pre-Shave-Stick/dp/B002SO8IMS/ref&#x3D;sr_1_2?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1371654437&amp;sr&#x3D;8-2&amp;keywords&#x3D;remington+face+saver</li>
