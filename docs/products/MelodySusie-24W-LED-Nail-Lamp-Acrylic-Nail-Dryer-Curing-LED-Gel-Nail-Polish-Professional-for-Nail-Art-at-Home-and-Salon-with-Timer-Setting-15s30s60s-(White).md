      <li>My nails look amazing</li>
      <li>Although I wanted something that looked nice</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m THRILLED with this purchase.</li>
      <li>Now when I chip and now I can repair it on my own and not have to make a trip to a salon.</li>
      <li>The timers worked perfectly and being able to do a whole hand at once, awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>So far it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
      <li>Excellent light, work fast to cure gel.</li>
      <li>I think they&#x27;d both be suitable for travel, but this 24W more so.</li>
      <li>I also have the MelodySusie 12W LED lamp, which honestly works fine too.  </li>
      <li>It has already saved me well more than my purchase price.</li>
      <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE.</li>
      <li>Really does a great job, you&#x27;ll need to alcohol wipe the tackiness away when you&#x27;re done, and you are left with that perfect, self leveling, glassy, glossy finish!</li>
      <li>When adding top coat to finish my mani, I see NO color transfer onto the brush.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  </li>
      <li>I love this curing light!</li>
      <li>My nails dry perfectly and to my surprise</li>
      <li>I am saving so much money doing my own gel mani at home. :)</li>
      <li>I was using a dark polish, and this lamp cured each coat perfectly!  </li>
      <li>I thank that is a huge indicator if the color is fully cured.</li>
      <li>The price was already great for the value, but I got a further discount with a code posted on chickettes.com blog.</li>
      <li>It fits my whole hand perfectly and had double the LED lights</li>
      <li>Due to the size and light weight, I&#x27;m sure it will be great for travel.  </li>
      <li>, it is fast and easy to use!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been doing my own gel nails (mostly with Gelish) for over a year now, first using the Gelish branded 6 watt lamp (which lasted me maybe 6 months, so only around 10 uses)</li>
      <li>Well this meets all that criteria and was delivered quickly as well.</li>
      <li>Fast and easy.</li>
      <li>I can easily fit my whole hand in to cure.</li>
      <li>If you really wanted them I&#x27;d imagine you could get some small ones froma craft store and glue them in there, I opted to get the white lamp assuming it would reflect light the best....</li>
      <li>I was not disappointed and highly recommend it.  </li>
      <li>Thanks MelodySusie!</li>
      <li>Doing my nails is soooo much quicker with this lamp!</li>
      <li>It is exactly as described.</li>
      <li>It has three settings and your whole hand fits in!</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t need a lot of bells and whistles as this is my first lamp.</li>
      <li>and I used it for the first time.</li>
      <li>I was wanting to get away from the large UV unit I have and after reading the reviews I decided to give this LED unit a try.  </li>
      <li>so when I saw how affordable this one was, and that I could actually fit my whole hand (seriously, this alone is enough to make it great...</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t want something that was &amp;#34;cutesy&amp;#34;, I wanted an LED that was powerful enough to get the job done quickly.</li>
      <li>I love the three different cure times, as I have products with different times listed, and this makes it quick and easy to follow different manufacturer&#x27;s instructions.</li>
      <li>top coat that is 60 sec cure.  </li>
      <li>I got it really fast and like the product</li>
      <li>Whole hand fits in and has indicators where to put your fingers on the bottom where you place your hand.</li>
      <li>Cured whole hand at a time.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure when I&#x27;m ready to upgrade and get a few of those upgrades I will be purchasing from MelodySusie.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only had the opportunity to use the machine twice, but it certainly cures gel products exactly as directed on the gel products&#x27; packaging.  </li>
      <li>then I purchased a twin for it here on Amazon (another little 6 watt) which is still working fine but never seemed to really cure all the way</li>
      <li>Beep on/off are quick and not loud at all.</li>
      <li>I LOVE this little, lightweight powerhouse!  </li>
      <li>but it isn&#x27;t overly loud.</li>
      <li>I have used Gelish/RCM, LeChat, INK, Gel II, Kiara Sky, and IBD all with this lamp so far and no issues.</li>
      <li>size, it is small enough to slip into my suitcase without taking up too much room and is very lightweight.</li>

    <li> I love this curing light! Works perfectly on OPI gel products. It is big enough for hands and feet, and doesn&#x27;t cost the earth! Really does a great job, you&#x27;ll need to alcohol wipe the tackiness away when you&#x27;re done, and you are left with that perfect, self leveling, glassy, glossy finish! Voila!</li>
    <li> Excellent light, work fast to cure gel. Whole hand fits in and has indicators where to put your fingers on the bottom where you place your hand. Nice design and good quality.</li>
    <li> This is and update ... I purchased a white lamp that I&#x27;m guessing was defective (did not turn on) so I send it back got my refund and purchase another one (silver one) that works perfectly. I&#x27;m so happy with the customer service and all their support. Have used the machine 3 times already and works like a charm. I&#x27;m really happy.</li>
    <li> Works amazing! I am saving so much money doing my own gel mani at home. :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had the opportunity to use the machine twice, but it certainly cures gel products exactly as directed on the gel products&#x27; packaging.  I love the three different cure times, as I have products with different times listed, and this makes it quick and easy to follow different manufacturer&#x27;s instructions.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m THRILLED with this purchase. I&#x27;ve been doing my own gel nails (mostly with Gelish) for over a year now, first using the Gelish branded 6 watt lamp (which lasted me maybe 6 months, so only around 10 uses) then I purchased a twin for it here on Amazon (another little 6 watt) which is still working fine but never seemed to really cure all the way (I&#x27;d have a bit of color on the wipe after curing sometimes) so when I saw how affordable this one was, and that I could actually fit my whole hand (seriously, this alone is enough to make it great... I was sick of having to do my thumbs separately from my other 4 fingers) I jumped at the chance to buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived yesterday and I used it for the first time. LOVE LOVE LOVE. I used a dark turquoise and had no color transfer at all after curing. I was a bit worried about the beep (I do my nails after my little one is in bed) but it isn&#x27;t overly loud. The timers worked perfectly and being able to do a whole hand at once, awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My nails look great, I have no doubt they are fully cured. I&#x27;ve seen some concern about the lack of mirrors inside however given the number of leds and their placement I don&#x27;t think mirrors are going to make a difference. If you really wanted them I&#x27;d imagine you could get some small ones froma craft store and glue them in there, I opted to get the white lamp assuming it would reflect light the best.... so that&#x27;s something else that may or may not make a difference vs getting the black version.</li>
    <li> No need to buy the more expensive products. This product has great reviews and they are correct.&lt;br /&gt;My wife is very pleased with this.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this little, lightweight powerhouse!  It has three settings and your whole hand fits in! I&#x27;d been using a UV lamp and decided to switch to the LED and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  Doing my nails is soooo much quicker with this lamp!</li>
    <li> My nails look amazing, it is fast and easy to use! A great buy</li>
    <li> I researched for quite some time before deciding on which nail curing lamp to purchase. There are so many poorly made lamps out there I didn&#x27;t want to waste my money. Although I wanted something that looked nice I didn&#x27;t want something that was &amp;#34;cutesy&amp;#34;, I wanted an LED that was powerful enough to get the job done quickly. I didn&#x27;t need a lot of bells and whistles as this is my first lamp. Well this meets all that criteria and was delivered quickly as well. I&#x27;m sure when I&#x27;m ready to upgrade and get a few of those upgrades I will be purchasing from MelodySusie.</li>
    <li> I love it! I am use to a mini light so this is awesome! Works great for me! Love it!</li>
    <li> I was wanting to get away from the large UV unit I have and after reading the reviews I decided to give this LED unit a try.  I was not disappointed and highly recommend it.  While it&#x27;s not a &amp;#34;travel&amp;#34; size, it is small enough to slip into my suitcase without taking up too much room and is very lightweight. It drys all nails on one hand at a time which some units don&#x27;t do.  My nails dry perfectly and to my surprise I&#x27;m going longer between manicures.</li>
    <li> I got it really fast and like the product</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the purchase experience and also with this item. It exceeds my expectations and couldn&#x27;t be happier. It has already saved me well more than my purchase price. Now when I chip and now I can repair it on my own and not have to make a trip to a salon.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife and she loves it. A lot faster than the previous one she used. Price is also great.</li>
    <li> Great light. It is exactly as described. I can easily fit my whole hand in to cure. Fast and easy.</li>
    <li> After doing a ton of research, I returned the 12W LED lamp I had purchased and upgraded to this 24W LED lamp.  I&#x27;m SO glad that I did, this lamp is awesome!! It fits my whole hand perfectly and had double the LED lights so it hits all of your nails perfectly, even your thumb.  I was using a dark polish, and this lamp cured each coat perfectly!  If you have the extra to upgrade to this lamp, I definitely would...it&#x27;s really a great lamp.  Thanks MelodySusie!</li>
    <li> So far it&#x27;s perfect! The only flaw I can think of is the inside of the lamp is not mirrored.....but I suppose if there are enough bulbs and they are placed well enough then there is no need for that?? I have used Gelish/RCM, LeChat, INK, Gel II, Kiara Sky, and IBD all with this lamp so far and no issues. I like how compact it is. Beep on/off are quick and not loud at all. Timers of 15-30-60 seconds are perfect. I have a &amp;#34;no wipe&amp;#34; top coat that is 60 sec cure.  I&#x27;ll be back for an update after a few rounds of manicures.  Chickettes (the gel blogger) should be having a review on her blog soon.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 4/10/15: still loving this lamp! When adding top coat to finish my mani, I see NO color transfer onto the brush. I thank that is a huge indicator if the color is fully cured. Hope this lasts me a long time. Great lamp. P.s. no issues with the underside of my nails, so I guess mirrors are not really necessary. Just follow the little &amp;#34;divots/markers&amp;#34; inside for finger placement.</li>
    <li> This nail dryer is amazing. It works just as promised. Cured whole hand at a time.  3 settings. Very very satisfied!</li>
    <li> This LED lamp does the trick!  Due to the size and light weight, I&#x27;m sure it will be great for travel.  No curing issues whatsoever.  I also have the MelodySusie 12W LED lamp, which honestly works fine too.  I think they&#x27;d both be suitable for travel, but this 24W more so. The price was already great for the value, but I got a further discount with a code posted on chickettes.com blog.</li>
    <li> Great lamp. Works well with Shellac.</li>
