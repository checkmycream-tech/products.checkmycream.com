<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have used this product for several years. I found it on a cruise that gave a demo for it. I have tried many bronzers but this is the best I have ever found.</li>
    <li> It gives my face and neck a glowing subtle color without having to sit in the sun to get a suntan.  I love it and have been using it for several years.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over 25 yrs. First discovered it on a cruise ship. I use it everyday. I could not live without it..... seriously love this product. Key is to not use too much.</li>
    <li> Great and lightweight to wear during spring and summer months. It is a bit reddish/orange on my skin, but a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product. Looks extremely natural.</li>
    <li> This is my second jar of California Sun Glow.  I paid $26 for this one and $70 for the first one; however, it lasted me 5 years.  I love the bronzing effect this gives your skin without looking overly made up.  In face sometimes it is the only make up I put on at all and I don&#x27;t even look dead without the rest of the stuff.</li>
    <li> It covers very well.  This one I just purchased I seem to be allergic to.&lt;br /&gt;Is it possible to send back?</li>
    <li> I have used this product before and I really love it!  It makes me look like I have a tan without being out in the sun. It can also be used on my neck and shoulders if I am wearing a low-cut top.</li>
    <li> Love, introduced on cruise.  Cork too far down in container, in attempting to remove, cork pushed in jar causing much powder to be expelled.  Contacted Amazon-time spa.  Time spa is sending replacement at no extra charge!!!!</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this product on a cruise around Italy.  The cruise was fabulous but learning about California Sun Glow introduced me to a product that I will never be without.  So easy to use, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this stuff. Originally bought on a cruise ship 15 years ago.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product that can be used as cover all make up, blush, lip gloss, and eye shadow.  Mix it with lotion, vaseline to etc. to darken or lighten depending on what you are using it for.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I have been using it for over 15 years</li>
    <li> I love this stuff -- gives me a nice glow all over. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I saw this first on a cruise ship which i believe is the case with most people, but it doesnt seem to go on very evenly so I dont wear it as much as I thought I would</li>
    <li> I, too, was introduced to this product on a cruise and love it, love it, love it.  I&#x27;m a child of the 60s, so I don&#x27;t like to wear a lot of makeup, so this is perfect.  It can be worn alone or as a finishing touch.  It&#x27;s amazing this little pot would last so long, but mine lasts almost a year!!  This is a great buy and a quality product!</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  I always bought it while on a cruise ship but prefer to order it through Amazon.</li>
    <li> I love it. Started using on one of my Cruises, years ago. Now I get it on line. My very favorite</li>
    <li> I have fair skin and light eyes. Many blushes look weird on me, especially bronzer types. I LOVE this mineral blush. Mix a TINY amount with moisturizer, or put it on a clean lightly oiled face. Blend it in. It makes pale skin glow healthy and stays on all day. Does not clog pores. I&#x27;m pretty sure it would look great on any skin tone. I use this every day without fail and the jar will probably last more than a year. This is a great buy, especially if you are careful about what you put on your face. I have not been tempted to buy any other blush since I got it.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  it&#x27;s great as a bronzer and also as a blush.  It lasts a long time as well.</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s a little overpriced, but it&#x27;s a great bronzer.</li>
    <li> I found this bronzer on  CRUISE  some  years ago. I have told many people about this stuff. it is great for any color skin and I am olive and my daughter is light with red hair and it works for both of us. she just uses it sparingly . I use more and it gives you a wonderful glow. so happy i found this product. it is also very reasonable .</li>
    <li> It is just what I ordered - a great product.</li>
    <li> I found out about this product about 10 years ago in a spa on a cruise ship. It&#x27;s wonderful! I gives you fully consistent coverage without looking like clown make-up. The bronzing powder looks so natural that I wear this day and night. It has a light feel and doesn&#x27;t streak or look blotchy. It covers up skin tone to look smooth and radiant. A plus for me - it doesn&#x27;t have a glittery or shimmery look. I used to always make sure I bought one of these each time when went on a cruise, now I just order it on line and save a couple of dollars.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  Have been using it for many years, ever since I was introduced to it on a cruise.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using another similar product called &amp;#34;Indian Earth&amp;#34;, but California Sun Glow is even better. Highly recommend it. I use it on on eyes as an eye shadow and my checks and face. Makes me look tan all year!</li>
    <li> I purchased this on a cruise a couple of times and loved it. Was glad I finally found it here. I love it. Makes you look natural.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  Living in New York I love using this product throughout the winter.  People have asked if I went on vacation based on my &amp;#34;sun-kissed&amp;#34; look!</li>
    <li> I have always had a hard time finding bronzer that was &amp;#34;just right.&amp;#34; Usually they were too orange or turned orange as the day went on (ex., Laura Geller) or too muddy for my complexion (ex., Bare Minerals Warmth).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased California Sun Glow strictly based on reviews after searching Amazon for something new to try. And this one is Just Right. I&#x27;m 60 years old with natural &amp;#34;silver&amp;#34; hair, and this bronzer is perfect for me. I&#x27;ve been using a smaller brush to lightly apply it as blush and contour. In the summer, I&#x27;ll use a larger brush for an all-over bronze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way. It&#x27;s very easy to use too much. I tap the brush against the sink before applying it, then blend with a cosmetic sponge.</li>
    <li> I have been sing this product for some time now  I think it is the best powder  it glows all day long</li>
    <li> I bought 3 California Sun Glow, as I originally bought the first one on a cruise with friends.  We all liked it very much.  That is why I purchased 3 more.  One for myself and two for friends.  All seems fine with the Amazon purchase and we are all happy with them.</li>
    <li> Great product for the summer.  We were introduced to it in Europe and really liked it.  You need to understand how to use -- Shake gently, remove cork top and gently shake excess powder off top and then swipe a very large brush across the top.  If you apply correctly, it will give you a soft bronze glow.  If you do not follow those steps, you will look like a bronze clown.  Also, be very careful when handling clay pot as I dropped my first one and it shattered everywhere.  Not a travel-friendly receptacle</li>
    <li> heard this was a good bronzer but was a bit skeptical.&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased to say that I was very happy with it. It goes on smoothly and&lt;br /&gt;is not orange at all, it is more on the pinkish side.It is a bit messy but I do&lt;br /&gt;recommend it.</li>
    <li> Use it as an all in one makeup.  Makes me look tan and very natural.</li>
    <li> I have used the California Sun Glow for many years and have loved it.  Thanks for a good product!</li>
    <li> This powdery makeup is contained in a terra cotta little  pot (cute, but totally impractical).  Since most women apply makeup in a bathroom, breakable containers are indeed problematic. It should be contained in a compact or suitable makeup packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I called to return the item, and was told the company would charge me a percentage (can&#x27;t remember how much) and shipping to return the item.  I am a dissatisfied customer and will not shop with this company again.</li>
    <li> The best bronzer on the market today. Very light and blends well!! The only bronzer I will buy!! Luv it!</li>
    <li> The product arrived so quickly and was EXACTLY what I wanted!! I am so pleased this product is AMAZING! I bought it on a cruise ship and I broke it so I was so happy I found it on Amazon!!</li>
    <li> Found this originally on a cruise and have loved it ever since.</li>
    <li> Would recommend this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for several years now.  Gives you the look of a nice soft sun tan effect.</li>
    <li> This is the exact powder I got on a cruise years ago and I just love it. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with this Sun Glow.</li>
    <li> Great price and love the bronzer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used nothing else for 12 years!  Just learned I could buy it on the internet.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this product on a Celebrity cruise and love it. It gives my very pale skin a nice glow. I use it over moisturizer so it is very bare. Only problem is the container isn&#x27;t best for travel. I take it in original box plus a brush.</li>
    <li> This powder is easy to apply and just enough color to give off a natural glow. Been using this product for several years.</li>
    <li> I also started using this after a cruise, but when I went on Celebrity this past June they didn&#x27;t have it!  I was glad to find it here because it really is a wonderful product.  The container is not very practical however.  I always put mine in a plastic, 4oz Gladware (or similar) container with a snap on lid.  You can still tip the container and tap the lid to get the right amount of powder, and it&#x27;s safe in the bathroom or for travel.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for 20 yrs and still love it.  It doesn&#x27;t streak or leave funny color on your face like so many other bronzers do.</li>
    <li> Love it; this is my third order for this product.</li>
    <li> Really enhances my coloring and very easy to use.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  It does exactly what I have loved about Sun Glow.</li>
    <li> you turn container upside down so powder is on the cork , then tap cork over container to remove excess. then sweep large makeup brush over the cork and lightly apply powder over entire face.  Repeat same procedure over places you want to highlight or contour.  I use a eyeshadow brush to put more on my eyelid  as an eyeshadow.  The powder enhances natural beauty without looking like makeup .  I am a lighter toned black woman who would wear Beige 4 in Mary Kay in Winter and Bronze .5 in summer just to give you idea of how this powder work for me summer and winter.  I recommend you try it if you want to enhance your appearance without looking like  you have on makeup.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 15 years now.  It is easy to apply and just gives your face a nice &#x27;finished glow&#x27;.</li>
    <li> I love this product. it is a very high quality bronzer. I wear it alone, with mascara, it gives me a natural glow. I purchased an ecotools sheer finish brush to apply it! its a necessity to my makeup bag must-haves</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this California Sun Glow by Steiner on a cruise in 2005.  I have used other bronzers but nothing compares to the natural youthful glow this gives my face...I&#x27;m 65!  It is absolutely the best bronzer in the world.  It cost me $40 seven years ago, today Amazon is selling it for $8 cheaper!&lt;br /&gt;It is so worth every penny and then some. A little bit of this bronzer goes a long way. I can promise you, you will be thrilled with this bronzer.</li>
    <li> good service, quality merchandise</li>
    <li> I have used this product previously.  I do like it.  When it was delivered via mail to me there was spillage in the package.  It is rather expensive so hated to see some wasted.  Otherwise, I was pleased with my order.&lt;br /&gt;4 *</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd order and I just love it.  Works best on med skin tone.  My skin is a little lighter but works fine anyway.  Not orange or anything just a really nice color you can use all over your face for color.  It does last forever probably a year.</li>
    <li> After my moisturizer is absorbed, I dust on some of this with a brush, with some extra on my cheek apples, and it&#x27;s all I wear for facial color for the rest of the day.  Over the years, I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on this gold-toned glow.  I use a piece of folded parchment paper under the jar when I&#x27;m removing the cork and running my brush over the cork to get the color.  Then I wipe the brush across the parchment and pick up the left over flakes and use that on my cheek apples.  Beautiful glow! TIP:  I saved the cork from an older bottle of this product and it works better because it sticks further out of the jar so that one doesn&#x27;t need to use a knife to get the cork out.</li>
    <li> I really do like California Sun Glow so much.  It just gives that extra little sparkle.  I was on a cruise and had a facial.  This was one of the products used. I had purchased it and had used it all.  Couldn&#x27;t find the product til I found it online.  Happy to have it.</li>
    <li> Wife first purchased this product on a cruise. It lasts a long time. This is only our third purchase in ten years yet wife uses product all the time and loves it.</li>
    <li> Very happy with it.  Will reorder it again.</li>
    <li> This bronzer is so much nicer to use than thick clogging makeup. Just brush it on gently,starting with the cheekbones, and build up to the color you require. Then brush lightly over the rest of your moisturized face to remove shine and add a hint of tone. It lasts for years as you need so little. This is one of my beauty staples for sure!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using California Sun Flow for a number of years because it gives me a healthy look.  It is easy to use and can be brushed on over a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> i have been looking for this product for years, its wonderful.</li>
    <li> I used to use this years ago, but had no luck finding it for a long time. So happy for Amazon AS USUAL !!! Love the product, love the price and LOVE being a prime member !</li>
    <li> I first tried this on a cruise and ordered it when I got home.  I love this product because you can control the amount of color and it is never orange.  I get compliments on my great tan all the time and it gives my skin a nice glow as well.  The little pot lasts a long time, up to two years, so it&#x27;s a great value.</li>
    <li> California Sun is great.  I was introduced to this product back in the nineties and have been using this since then.  When I was younger did not need it as often, but as I have grown older, find that this product is just the frosting on the cake!  The youthful glow it gives you is priceless!!!  I definitely recommend this product to everyone for that beautiful bronze glow.</li>
    <li> This is a product for all types of skin.  No need for a lot of make-up.  A few swipes with the brush and the powder gives you the &amp;#34;Glow&amp;#34; for all day!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product many years and I love it. I will continue to use this product. Thank you</li>
    <li> This product is great. It adds a nice glow to my skin type &amp; lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> For the person who had one star.  Apparently the were never shown how to use it.. You shake it to get powder on the cork and tap excess off back into the container. You can use this on your whole face and get an even look. Had this applied on a cruise and everyone loved it.  Lasts for six months if used properly. Just glad I a could find it again. Used this for 6 years.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years and have loved it.</li>
    <li> I bought this on a cruise years ago.... ran out. Found it on Amazon.... Best stuff ever. Use in place of makeup in the summer and in winter you get a nice glow with just a dab. It will last a very long time.</li>
    <li> I had purchased this product because I ran out of mine. I was very pleased that it was the color I wanted and there is no damage to my skin. This is a product that I will continue using for a long time.</li>
    <li> I still have some product left from my time on the cruise where I originally purchased it....the new product copied the packaging, well but the blush is dull and does not contain any of the minerals in my original product, a total rip off of a wonderful product.....I wish I could get my money back!
