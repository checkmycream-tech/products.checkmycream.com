<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> When I received the pens they expire in two months.  When you follow the directions they should last a lot longer than that so I would have to throw 2 pens away.  I tried one pen for a short period of time and it did seem to brighten my teeth but again I would have to throw 2 pens away because they expired.</li>
    <li> Total waste of money.  Does not work for crowns, bridges, caps. And on real teeth it takes 2 to 3 weeks to barely work.</li>
    <li> ...thats about it. I have tried crest whitening strips which did work more effectively but if you dont have patience and/or perfectly straight teeth, its a pain to work with. With these whitening pens, its easy to apply but it does take longer (about 3x longer) to get the same results as you would get with strips. My suggestion is get professional whitening treatment, then use these pens for touchups. Remember teeth are like white shirts. Anything you throw at it, will stain it so having these pens handy help alot. I keep a pen in my car for when im out, or after lunch break at work, ill rinse my mouth and use this pen. If you decide to go this route, i suggest getting their toothpast or some sort of whitening pre-rinse mouthwash. Because its good to have your front teeth white but you should also worry about the other parts of your teeth getting white too.</li>
    <li> This product is very good and my teeth showed great results in using this product, I would recommend this product and the ordering was quick and easy. Thank you</li>
    <li> This product has helped whiten my teeth somewhat, but it is not a miracle whitener.  It is easy to use, but the taste is unpleasant.  Maybe if you have your teeth professionaly whitened, and then use this to keep them white.</li>
    <li> Received 3 pens labeled &amp;#34;whitening pen&amp;#34; in a Manila envelope (not even wrapped/boxed, just loose and leaky!) with NO &amp;#34;instruction sheet&amp;#34;. These are clearly NOT BriteSmile pens -- Fakes I&#x27;d be afraid to use. Happy AMAZON gladly refunded however, very concerned with what is being shipped (ie copyright infringement by 3rd party).</li>
    <li> This is the best whitening tool I have found.  It is so easy to put into your morning routine.  I work in the medical field and have gotten so many compliments on how white my teeth are.  I originally purchased this product through QVC and was so disappointed that I could not get anymore.  Thank goodness for Amazon!  Love, Love, Love this product. Shipping on this item came very quickly.  Thank you for an amazing product.</li>
    <li> These pens work like a charm. Easy to use on the go and they last a long time. My teeth were brighter and whiter within the first week. Great after dining-out to brighten up your smile. So much better than more expensive brands-and I&#x27;ve tried them all. This is my favorite!</li>
    <li> These are great unique gifts for brides, bridesmaids and even grooms and groomsmen! They don&#x27;t work to whiten teeth as well as your dentist or even brushing with whitening toothpaste over time, of course, but they do tend to remove wine stains easy enough! Just a nice little gift at a great price!</li>
    <li> Great idea, but does not deliver any results. The one positive is that it taste pretty good, so maybe after a spicy lunch, this will freshen your breath. It won&#x27;t whiten your teeth. Go the professional route.</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT IS EASY, CONVENIENT, AND, MOST IMPORTANTLY, EFFECTIVE. ONE OF THE LEAST ATTRACTIVE SIGNS OF AGING IS YELLOW TEETH AND THIS PRODUCT INSURES THAT MY SMILE IS SPARKLING. I HAVE USED A NUMBER OF OTHER WHITENING AGENTS. THIS IS THE ONE I WON&#x27;T BE WITHOUT!</li>
    <li> My mom and I are both coffee and red wine drinkers and notice a difference while using this product.  Neither of us have had any sensitivity issues like with some other whitening products.  Very easy to use, I&#x27;m a fan.</li>
    <li> This produce is guaranteed to whiten your teeth.  I applied it and let is stay on my teeth for 30 mins.  Nothing happened.  I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> This product works very well and is very convenient. LOVE BrightSmile, big fan. It lasts a long time to this kit.</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Nice and small. Easy to carry in purse or traveling.&lt;br /&gt;Does a great job. See results quickly.</li>
    <li> product is convenient. But it did not do much to whiten my teeth and i used it every morning and evening.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was working because I see my teeth every day when I brush. They looked the same to me. Then my friends would ask, \\&quot;How did you get your teeth so white?\\&quot; and \\&quot;What are you using?\\&quot; Yes, it is easy to use and it really does work! TRY IT!</li>
    <li> i love these pens. i  first got  them from QVC and then they didnt have them when i went to reorder.. so glad i found them on amazon.com they keep  my teeth looking fresh and white..just brush it on whenever. on the go or whatever.I used crest whitestrips for a long time but this is like 100% more effective and SOO easy!If you want  whiter teeth get it. :)</li>
    <li> my teeth are even more whiter then before</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had an in-home whitening gel work as well. After two days, I noticed my teeth were whiter. I&#x27;m not noticing any tooth sensitivity either. I believe this gel works, and I believe it has a professional-strength level of power. When I run-out, I&#x27;m buying more!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a year, I originally bought it from QVC and too bad they don&#x27;t carry it anymore because they had a better price.  Anyway it does work for me and convenient.  I only gave it four stars because it is overpriced and overpackaged.</li>
    <li> EXP DATE  2013-08 printed on each box (3).  Not sure if that date will affect the use of the product.</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT DID NOTHING FOR ME.. MY TEETH ARE THE SAME AS THEY WERE. GLAD IT WAS ONLY 1.33.I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE, IT SEEMED AS IF I WAS JUST PUTTING WATER ON MY TEETH.</li>
    <li> Brite Smile is by far the most superior product out there!  After years of spending money foolishly on products that either were too painful to endure or far too nasty tasting and annoying to deal with (sitting for 30 minutes sucking your teeth dry is such a delight)  I decided to invest in the professional Brite Smile treatment.  Invest first in the professional treatment and then maintain it with the Brite Smile Pen and an over the counter brightening tooth paste.  This is honestly the only way to achieve the goal of that brilliant white smile.  I highly recommend this product as maintenance and would imagine that even if you didn&#x27;t have the professional treatment done you would see more results than the other products available out there over the counter.</li>
    <li> Ireally like the convenience of having 3 tubes of this product so I can use it as often as I can remember.  Not a bad taste &amp; easy to use. Really works too!</li>
    <li> Like other reviewers I have to share that my pens expired the month I received them in - that&#x27;s not cool!  BUT, I can see whitening from the pens. It&#x27;s just annoying to spend money on expired products and not even be alerted that it&#x27;s expired.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. It made my teeth two shades lighter in just one week. It surely beats Colgate crap that sells everywhere for 10 dollars that doesn&#x27;t work! These 3 pens will last you for 3 months! You only need to use it initially for 2 weeks and then as you feel needed. Great product overall! And it&#x27;s not messy and easy to carry with you anywhere you go.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years and it truly is the best product out there. In a matter of days I get compliments from people saying how white my teeth are. The most impressive feature is that it does not cause tooth sensitivity on my teeth. I have tried every other product out there to whiten teeth and I always ended up with such a sensitivity from the product. Not with Brite Smile though. It&#x27;s the best and as long as they keep making it, I will keep buying it. Its so easy to use, doesn&#x27;t burn your gums or lips and leaves a fresh minty aftertaste which is better than all the other products out there.</li>
    <li> As usual the whitening pens are great and you can see the teeth as lighter immediately.  The reasonable price now will keep me coming back</li>
    <li> I used product according to directions.  I did not see any change in the color of my teeth.  Still yellow.</li>
    <li> I have used these pens for several years they work for me. I like how it feels and whitens my teeth.</li>
    <li> I am disappointed in the product.  Maybe it&#x27;s me but I didn&#x27;t really notice any change in the appearance of my teeth having used the product.</li>
    <li> I was told by my dentist&#x27;s office that the peroxide in these pens expires. The last pens I purchased had an expiration date. These, however, do not! They could be 5 years expired, who knows? I don&#x27;t think these are doing much as opposed to the last ones that worked well. A BIG expense for uncertainty.</li>
    <li> Does a pretty good job for the price!  It whitens probably a shade or two.  I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had yellow teeth for 60 years. I was told it was a medicine my mother took when she was pregnant. I&#x27;ve never been in a financial situation that allowed for cosmetic fixes of any kind, so every couple years I give these products a try, only to be disappointed. I suppose it would work on teeth that are stained, but for those of us with naturally off-colored teeth, they will not whiten. So short of winning the lottery or marrying the Donald I&#x27;ll have to live with the teeth I was born with. Actually I&#x27;d rather live with these teeth than marry the Donald.</li>
    <li> These whitening pens really work! Excellent results and the price was extremely low. Good quality! I highly recommend these pens.</li>
    <li> I hae used this product in the psat an just love it!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s convenient, easy to use at anytime of the day or night.  I even carry one with me in my purse for a quick touchup.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly rcommend thi priduct to anyone out htere who wants a quick and easy way to a brighter smile!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used yet, but came fast and looks like the legitimate item! Very pleased!</li>
    <li> works great.  no bad taste or gooey gel.  I use it a couple times a week and I&#x27;m still on my first pen.</li>
    <li> I really like this product, easy to use and carry with you</li>
    <li> Both my husband and I use this product and it works. I will purchase again from your web site it is great</li>
    <li> This is so easy to use and really helps to remove stains. I am a coffee and tea drinker, so it really helps to have something to remove the stains. Once in the morning and once in the evening. An added benefit is that it helps to reduce tartar build-up... my dentist can&#x27;t believe how clean and healthy my teeth are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would and do recommend this product to my friends.</li>
    <li> Much better than crest whitestrips. I hated having to put the strips on, having them on, and taking them off. The pen i can apply quickly whenever i think of it and then go about my day with no after effects. Plus it is gratifying because you start to see results after just the first couple of days.</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd time buying Brite Smile over the years.  I Love this product.  It hasn&#x27;t made my teeth whiter than white but....  it has improved my smile by more than 75%. If you have sensitive teeth you don&#x27;t have to worry with this product.  I would recommend this product and let people know that this isn&#x27;t one of those teeth whiteners that promises something that it \\&quot;can&#x27;t\\&quot; deliver.  It actually and realistically works.</li>
    <li> This is an expired product which can be dangerous do not buy from here I would recommend paying a little more and getting a product that won&#x27;t make you sick- they really shouldn&#x27;t be selling this</li>
    <li> amazing---and i have it all---everything from crest to trays from dentist. i probably  overuse this stuff--- but well, i have rock star whaite teeth!!!!!</li>
    <li> Product came exactly as described.  I had previously ordered this product through QVC, but since it is no longer available there I will continue to purchase through amazon.  I definitely noticed that my teeth were whiter after only a few uses.  Easy to apply and does not taste bad, much better than any whitestrips I have used.</li>
    <li> i like this a lot i have tried many other kinds of teeth whitening pens but it is kind of hard to compare which works better. i think this poduct works because people have told me my teeth look brighter and shinier. i would recommend this product</li>
    <li> I love this product. The BriteSmile To GO whitening Pen is a very cost effective way to whiten your teeth. Follow the instructions and you will have great results. I have sensitive teeth, so I was a little worried that I would not be able to use this product, but actually, it doesn&#x27;t bother my teeth at all and my teeth are nice and white now.</li>
    <li> Love this reordering today. Would recommend it to my best friend and all of her friends. Love this product!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for faithfully for over a month and there has been absolutely no chance in the color of my teeth.  And, to top that off, I tried to return it the other day and was told it was too late.  I thought there was at least a 90 day return, especially for a product that has made no change.  I wanted to use it a decent amount of time before I made the determination that it was not goint to work for me.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Works ok, but expensive</li>
    <li> Brightened my teeth and doesn&#x27;t hurt my exposed roots or gums.</li>
    <li> This was my first time trying a teeth whitener. I bought these pens after the reviews of no sensitivity. Of course, I was skeptical if it would work given the great price. But wow! It has been two weeks and I can see a noticeable difference! I drink lots of coffee and red wine. I thought maybe these habits would compromise the process, but they haven&#x27;t. No pain. Easy to use. Minty. And they truly whiten! Teeth whitening just might become another daily habit of mine.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Really works and so convenient to use.  Shared with my 16 year old Grandaughter.  She was excited to get this and started using right away.  She just got her braces off and needed a little help getting her teeth whiter!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my friend, but after I received it, I realized it will expire on Sep. 2013.. I think sellers should include this information in product description.</li>
    <li> So far so good. I still using the first pen but I did see a difference within the first couple of days.</li>
    <li> Quick way to whiten your teeth after each wash.  I recommend it to those that have whiten their teeth... it keeps mine white after each application.</li>
    <li> I see some difference in the whiteness of my teeth.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have purchased BriteSmile pens in the past from my dentist for $100 for a 3-pack, so when I saw this I thought, \\&quot;what a great deal\\&quot;! I received 3 pens labeled \\&quot;whitening pen\\&quot; in a Manila envelope with a typed \\&quot;instruction sheet\\&quot;. These are clearly NOT BriteSmile pens. When I contacted the seller they assured me the pens were \\&quot;just as good if not better than BriteSmile\\&quot; and to \\&quot;give one a try\\&quot;. She did offer to refund me if I wasn&#x27;t satisfied. I have absolutely no idea what&#x27;s in the pens and I&#x27;m certainly not putting the unknown substance in my mouth! If it&#x27;s not BriteSmile, a reputable brand, don&#x27;t label it as such! I&#x27;ve contemplated contacting BriteSmile directly to inform them of copyright infringement.</li>
    <li> I have one handy in the car and put it on the front of my teeth before lipstick.  It works great.</li>
    <li> Not too much of a difference, should have used the money towards the dentist&#x27;s treatmnet - which I undergo next month</li>
    <li> I used these for weeks and noticed no whitening at all.&lt;br /&gt;Tastes and feels like other whiteners I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m keeping at 3 stars since other whiteners didn&#x27;t so do much for me either.</li>
    <li> Keep these coming!  BriteSmile is the answer to whiter, brighter teeth as long as you use the pen twice a day.</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me at all!!! No results, none. Good luck for anyone buying this one product..</li>
    <li> I love it! I carry  it with me in my purse for after meals! Keeps my teeth white &amp; Brite! It also helps with built up tartar and is twice as good as dental floss!</li>
    <li> It is a great product. I am a returning customer. My dentist commented on the whiteness of my teeth since using Brite Smile</li>
    <li> I have been using it for years and keep using it. Very easy to use, convenient, tastes good (minty). Just click on the pen one or two or three times and apply to the teeth. Works very well at whitening. I prefer this pen other any method.</li>
    <li> Maybe it was completely a coincidence, but one of my molars developed resorption shortly after I started using this product. I used it again months later (had to have that molar pulled and had a dental implant placed), and my teeth become very sensitive and hurt if I use this product for a couple of days. It does whiten teeth, but I don&#x27;t want to take any chances with my teeth.</li>
    <li> after using this is sometimes a noticeable change and whiter teeth if they are but you have to use it frequently</li>
    <li> The first time I purchased these, I got them from an online shopping site  (for some reason my kindle won&#x27; t let me type in the 3 letters...it always changes them to something else...Christmas present). loved them then and was shocked that they no longer sold them. I saw them here but at a higher price. I waited until they dropped down to 30 bucks and went into action. They did not come with directions but I remember them from before. Do not use immediately after brushing, once you use them, do not eat for an hour and a half. these pens do not get your teeth snow blinding white. I believe you use them twice a day. I only use mine once a day. I am a coffee drinker. my teeth are pretty decent but I can definitely tell the difference when I use them. when I first got them I used them per directions for a week. there was definitely a difference. I am sorry to say that I don&#x27; t know how long they last. After my first week I used them as needed and always noticed a difference. One shade change with my usual once a day use, two shades with my twice a day usage. also, very very easy to use. Click them a few times.and a clear gel comes out. Take the brush across your teeth. I . usually have to expel some saliva and foam (small amount like brushing your teeth) and go about my day. They&#x27; &#x27;re convenient, fit my lifestyle and are compact. I hope this helps!</li>
    <li> I used this product but could see not difference in my teeth shade. Maybe good for someone but not for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these pens for years and I&#x27;m very happy with the product. Easy to use and the taste is great too.</li>
    <li> very good product that i use with confidence.</li>
    <li> I LOVE these pens! I was skeptic at first but I wanted to give them a try because of the reviews and I trust reviews over anything else. I will be purchasing more.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t be happier!! I really like these and have been using them for years ! I have told so many ppl about these pens because I get asked all the time what I use. I can&#x27;t say that this will take you from brown to bling white but it sure is the best you&#x27;ll find on the market for whitening and with NO sensitivity. I almost cried during zoom and couldn&#x27;t complete first round...and the white strips send zingers that hurt so bad I would rather get veneers than use those things. These pens are amazing and I will ALWAYS keep them around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tastes great and if you do follow directions and use twice a day for 2 weeks you will notice improvement...and likely so will others around you! This is a great deal!!</li>
    <li> These pens are great. I use them for 2 or 3 days in a row 2 or 3 times a day and my teeth are really white. Mind you, I am 60 years young and these pens work good on me The price is excellent and they last a long time. I see me son took one so if my son likes it, it must be good  slek53</li>
    <li> Used religiously and saw absolutely no difference whatsoever</li>
    <li> Very good price -- nice service!  ;)</li>
    <li> Great product &amp; SO handy</li>
    <li> It does work! I like it and tell other people about this product.I&#x27;ve tried some from a dentist, but not as good.. way to go BriteSmile!!</li>
