      <li>/&gt;Great products from ASDM, fast shipping, and all for a great price.</li>
      <li>I absolutely LOVE this peel.  </li>
      <li>I started doing it that way to determine if it would be okay.</li>
      <li>hands looked sooo much better.</li>
      <li>Could not be more satisfied.</li>
      <li>but the more stubborn whiteheads are gone while those remaining are reduced in size.</li>
      <li>(The brush holds more product than a cotton pad.)</li>
      <li>I am pleased with the results and am using it twice a week now.</li>
      <li>plus it&#x27;s safe to use once a week.</li>
      <li>(don&#x27;t use this more than once per week) and again my skin gets better and better...</li>
      <li>In a matter of 2 days my skin exfoliates itself and brighter more clearer skin is revealed underneath, I wait a week and try it again</li>
      <li>which is all you need, and I&#x27;ve used this twice already and have seen glorious results, I love it....</li>
      <li>I am able to use with no problems as there is ZERO fragrance!&lt;br /&gt;Did</li>
      <li>Love - love love this product.</li>
      <li>also purchased ASDM&#x27;s Tepezcohuite Serum, which I LOVE</li>
      <li>w the right use , skin peels gently and after it looks beautiful!!  </li>
      <li>I will use this again but maybe not so close to my eyes, although under my eyes look really good right now.</li>
      <li>And I had pretty good skin to start with.  </li>
      <li>I missed a spot under my jawline and got a pretty good burn.</li>
      <li>.. excited to see how my face will look after using it a lot!</li>
      <li>I love this stuff so much!!!</li>
      <li>but I will purchase a stronger percentage as this is very mild</li>
      <li>It does exactly what it claims to do and my product arrived in nicely boxed and sealed.</li>
      <li>Be prepared with a neutralizing solution (baking soda &amp; water works just fine).</li>
      <li>They respond quickly!</li>
      <li>Thank you for making this product available for home use.</li>
      <li>it  makes it  smooth.</li>
      <li>Thought it was suppose to be a light peel...</li>
      <li>So far so good</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s absolute best, and this will definitely get me there....</li>
      <li>It is very effective in keeping  the brown spots from coming back without burning or stinging.  </li>
      <li>I used the 40% Lactic Acid kit from Makeup Artist Choice with good results but since becoming a Prime member thought I would try out a different brand just to try something new.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is easy to apply, quick to use and no side effects.</li>
      <li>I did get burned fairly well between the folds of my nose and mouth and ended up with some scabbing, but nothing too major.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m still baby-ing my skin with rich moisturizers and Moroccan argan oil at night before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m excited for the flaking to stop</li>
      <li>I finally decided a chemical peel was my best option and ordered this product after seeing the prices of a professional treatment.</li>
      <li>I figured one layer was good enough.</li>
      <li>I am really liking the ASDM line of products and I plan on ordering more from their skincare line.</li>
      <li>Also, I think this product is a good value because you only need 1-2ml of product if applying with a fan brush so you can get 15-30 applications out of one bottle.</li>
      <li>with cool or tepid water</li>
      <li>I added some to my body lotion and after showering and towel drying and applying more lotion, skin on my legs were peeling and legs are really soft and smooth now.</li>
      <li>Im pregnant and have chronically dull/flaky skin.</li>
      <li>then I came upon this peel, which is excellent, clean ingredients, nothing toxic or chemical or unnecessary inside, just lactic acid...</li>
      <li>I apply pure Rose hip oil to help nourish my new skin after each session.</li>
      <li>very well packaged and thank you for free gift.appreciated.</li>
      <li>I LOVE that there are not a bunch of unnecessary ingredients, but it would be nice if it could have a more serum or gel-like texture.</li>
      <li>The peel I was using prior to this one was from a different company and was only a 15% fruit peel, which wasn&#x27;t that strong but good as a starter, I wanted something more intense that would leave me with greater results....</li>
      <li>it is just right for my skin</li>
      <li>Also, ASDM has this post-peel &amp;#34;T&amp;#34; cream that can really help your skin recover quickly.</li>
      <li>You can do this once about every 20 days, and your skin will look better and better after each application, as each application will rid another layer of dead skin.</li>
      <li>And enjoy your new face ;)</li>
      <li>Easy to use is my first time but do far no problem with.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have dark brown skin (think NW43) and suffered from acne since my preteen years up until maybe 6 months ago. The biggest reason why my acne and hyper-pigmentation is much milder than it used to be is because of lactic acid chemical peels. I discovered them on youtube and have been doing them monthly for a few years now. After stopping because of basic combat training, I wanted to start back up doing peels because they not only help with acne, but with loosening blackheads, brightening my skin tone and reducing oiliness, believe it or not. I used the 40% Lactic Acid kit from Makeup Artist Choice with good results but since becoming a Prime member thought I would try out a different brand just to try something new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t remember how I stumbled upon this brand but the price looked alright as well as the reviews. When I used it for the first time, I washed my skin with an oil-free cleanser, went back over it with witch hazel and applied a thin layer of the peel with a cotton ball. Since I haven&#x27;t done peels in a while I figured one layer was good enough. It started itching immediately but didn&#x27;t burn except for a few spots on my cheekbones and around my mouth. Unfortunately, I had forgotten that those were my sensitive spots so they started to scab up. It&#x27;s been almost 3 days and my dark skin is no longer red and the scabs have fallen off but I&#x27;m still baby-ing my skin with rich moisturizers and Moroccan argan oil at night before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this peel is pretty awesome. It makes your skin soft, smooth and help get rid of blackheads. Your skin will be bright after using this. Just be careful and follow the instructions. If you are new or haven&#x27;t done one in a while you might want to do a patch test a day or two before. I also suggest only doing your forehead, nose, chin and maybe your cheeks (away from underneath the eye) the first couple times until you know your skin can handle it. Other than that, go for it! And enjoy your new face ;)</li>
    <li> Lactic acid 40% is a great buy. Its very easy to use when reading the directions. great price too.&#x3D;)</li>
    <li> product works as described. comes with instruction. very well packaged and thank you for free gift.appreciated. have been using for 2wks now and results are apparent. its not magic so one use will not clear every issue up.</li>
    <li> This is very potent stuff, I left on for only five minutes and it was too long.  Great product, does what it says it will do.</li>
    <li> This is the Best! I have used platinum skin care tca peel for discoloration and it came right back I use this and it really works..&lt;br /&gt;This is what I apply on my face&lt;br /&gt;This is my Regimen:&lt;br /&gt;Wash with: Simple foaming wash&lt;br /&gt;Cetaphil Sunblock Spf 30..&lt;br /&gt;Drink plenty water&lt;br /&gt;Before the peel prep your skin with a fade cream for 2/weeks&lt;br /&gt;1..Wash Face thoroughly&lt;br /&gt;2..Use cotton ball to cleanse with 90% alcohol.over entire face let dry..&lt;br /&gt;3..Apply ASM all over evenly.Sit for 3/mins&lt;br /&gt;4.Rinse with cool or tepid water&lt;br /&gt;5..Pat dry &amp;#34;DO NOT SCRUB FACE&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;6.Apply ointment I use Dr.Sheffield&#x27;s .Triple  Antibiotic Oitment&lt;br /&gt;7..Repeat next 3/ days .. Repeat steps 1 and 5 and 6</li>
    <li> Made me break out every time I used it. I will be sticking with glycolic acid.</li>
    <li> Just did my first peel and I am proud of myself.  I am a 31 year old female.  I have discoloration from acne and a little bit of a scar from a depilatory cream ( Nair.  Never ever rub it in people... EVER!! ).  I am hoping this will help fade the redness and even out the texture of my skin.  This product was easy to use but I will tell you it did sting a little bit.  Its not as intense as putting alcohol on a wound but its probably around 30% of what that pain feels like.  My face is a bit red and its been about 4 hours since I did it and I planned it so I could sleep afterwards because you have to avoid sun exposure.  I am really liking the ASDM line of products and I plan on ordering more from their skincare line.</li>
    <li> burns if you use too much but works</li>
    <li> Great product will buy again just make sure you use sun screen after use avoid the sun while using this or it will have adverse effects</li>
    <li> Flawless! Buy now! FLAWLESS!</li>
    <li> w the right use , skin peels gently and after it looks beautiful!!  Love - love love this product.</li>
    <li> Great product. Does what it is intended to do. But fast shipping (less than a week)</li>
    <li> Fabulous product for do it yourself! and did receive a sample of moisturizing cream that&#x27;s like fluff, will purchase this brand again.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff it is not too strong but not too weak it is just right for my skin I use it  2 times a week it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin like some others and it  makes it  smooth.</li>
    <li> Watch out!!!!!!  Follow instructions to a T.  If you don&#x27;t it will leave dark marks because it works. was peeling like a banana.... And I&#x27;m African American.</li>
    <li> This is a great lactic acid to start with. Im pregnant and have chronically dull/flaky skin. No amount of moisturizer or exfoliation helps. My makeup looks terrible because of the flaky patches. I used this and it really helped.  I put it on for 1-2 min the first time. PLEASE have some baking soda and water to neutralize it! Then rinse it wash your face thoroughly. I missed a spot under my jawline and got a pretty good burn. So yes you can do this on your own but please be careful. You can do this once about every 20 days, and your skin will look better and better after each application, as each application will rid another layer of dead skin.</li>
    <li> Easy to use is my first time but do far no problem with.I believe is very safe to use.</li>
    <li> I am in the process of trying to address some serious skin issues. Acne, scarred pores, ice pick scars, congested skin, etc. I have tried 20% salicylic acid peels before, but had no visible results, so I decided to try a 40% lactic acid peel since I felt I needed something a little stronger. I left the peel on for a total of 4 min for my first time. I did get burned fairly well between the folds of my nose and mouth and ended up with some scabbing, but nothing too major. I think I&#x27;m sensitive in those areas. I used a brush to apply it to my face and next time I will use a cotton pad around that area since it is more sensitive and use the brush for the rest of my face. (The brush holds more product than a cotton pad.) I am currently 3 days post peel and I am still dry and flaking. I can cover most of it up with tinted moisturizer (with SPF!)  I can already notice a difference in depth on two scars and my skin tone seems more even. I&#x27;m excited for the flaking to stop so I can continue with my glycolic/retinol creams. I plan on doing this peel every 4-6 weeks. Some people do them weekly, but I don&#x27;t want to risk damaging my skin or making it worse. I didn&#x27;t get bad skin over night, so I can&#x27;t expect it to be fixed over night either. I think I can expect reasonable improvements in about 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also purchased ASDM&#x27;s Tepezcohuite Serum, which I LOVE and they included a free sample of their 30% glycolic cream, which I will eventually buy a full size of once I run out of my current cream. I am very impressed with this company&#x27;s use of natural/herbal ingredients, their competitive prices and speedy delivery.I didn&#x27;t purchase these from Amazon, I ordered from the company direct. I just wanted to leave a review here so others who have not heard of this company can get some great, affordable products too!</li>
    <li> I have used this one time on my face, left it on for 2 minutes, had tightening and red skin most of the night, next couple of days skin turned darker, then saw very minor peeling on cheeks. Used a face brush with soap and scrubbed face and got dead skin off. My sun spots are much lighter after one use and face looks firmer. Used on my hands and feet too. Hands look a little smoother. I added some to my body lotion and after showering and towel drying and applying more lotion, skin on my legs were peeling and legs are really soft and smooth now. Sun spots on arms are getting lighter too, so gonna keep it up and pile on the sunscreen. I plan on doing face peel once a week for a few months to try and get rid of all the sun spots and small wrinkles.</li>
    <li> This helped aid with the hyperpigmentation on my lips. It has made helpt them peel and become pink.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this peel.  The peel I was using prior to this one was from a different company and was only a 15% fruit peel, which wasn&#x27;t that strong but good as a starter, I wanted something more intense that would leave me with greater results....then I came upon this peel, which is excellent, clean ingredients, nothing toxic or chemical or unnecessary inside, just lactic acid...which is all you need, and I&#x27;ve used this twice already and have seen glorious results, I love it....I&#x27;m due to attend my sister&#x27;s wedding next year and want to prepare my skin to look it&#x27;s absolute best, and this will definitely get me there....I love this stuff so much!!! works incredibly well without the obvious peeling of the skin, so for those who hate that and can&#x27;t afford going to work with skin peeling off their faces - this alternative is the one you want. In a matter of 2 days my skin exfoliates itself and brighter more clearer skin is revealed underneath, I wait a week and try it again (don&#x27;t use this more than once per week) and again my skin gets better and better...even my husband complimented me on my complexion recently so that&#x27;s saying a lot, he always notices when my skin goes through something.....all in all, this lactic acid peel is top notch! :)</li>
    <li> Have been using this several weeks without any discomfort. It is easy to apply, quick to use and no side effects. I am pleased with the results and am using it twice a week now.</li>
    <li> it gave me a light peel my skin feels great it was easy on my face great peel.</li>
    <li> So far so good but I will purchase a stronger percentage as this is very mild completed one 1 oz bottle but no peeling and flaking as yet but skin is brighter and radiant I must say the results are great, Please note the bottles are very small so I suggest getting at least 3 or 4.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! I can use this twice a week with proper preparation and post-peel care. Please note that I am a veteran peeler, so I don&#x27;t suggest doing that for first-timers or those new to peels. Also, you can burn yourself putting this on thick (like with a brush). Be prepared with a neutralizing solution (baking soda &amp; water works just fine). Also, ASDM has this post-peel &amp;#34;T&amp;#34; cream that can really help your skin recover quickly. They gave me a sample, which was a great gesture (thank you!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great products from ASDM, fast shipping, and all for a great price. I definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Worst peel ever! Left my skin super broken out and blotchy. I&#x27;m so mad I have so much acne to deal with now. Thought it was suppose to be a light peel...but they were really nice in refunding me without any issues. The staff for the company is super nice too!! Maybe something else would work for me</li>
    <li> Worked very well. I advise look up a YouTube on how to apply it</li>
    <li> Great, the strength is just about right for me...not too strong at all, yet I still peel quite a bit. My skin looks better after 3 weeks on and a month off. Now I am starting again and will go longer. Applied thicker or left on longer, I think it would be a bit stronger. My only issue with this is the runny watery texture. This is just straight lactic acid diluted to the desired strength with distilled water. I LOVE that there are not a bunch of unnecessary ingredients, but it would be nice if it could have a more serum or gel-like texture. I think it makes it easier to get even coverage that way.</li>
    <li> Absolutely fascinated by this lactic acid.I waited some time before writing my review because I didn&#x27;t see any difference on my skin until I kept the acid on my skin for more than 4 minutes and boom my skin responded wonderfully. I have a sun spot on my forehead that is gradually disappearing,thanks to this awesome potion. Baking soda is a must have since after 2 minutes my face felt a slight burning sensation that  intensifies until I removed the acid and then BANG, my skin glows. I apply pure Rose hip oil to help nourish my new skin after each session.I give ADSM 5 stars! It does exactly what it claims to do and my product arrived in nicely boxed and sealed. I highly recommend this product and will continue to use their products in the future.</li>
    <li> Works well. Saw visible brightness and face felt softer.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I used it on my hands, left it on for a few minutes and rinsed it off. It stung a little bit but nothing bad.&lt;br /&gt;My hands looked sooo much better. Better than they have in a long time. I will use this once a week.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried it on my face yet but if it works like it did on my hands I will be happy. Also, this is very inexpensive.</li>
    <li> Does what it says!! Needing to peel some skin on my face and Yup!! it did, I follwed the directions and it worked like described!</li>
    <li> Works great. They tell you to only leave it on for a very short time. I started doing it that way to determine if it would be okay. It definitely makes it tingle - particularly around the nose. However, I found that I needed to leave it on a while longer and it didn&#x27;t cause a problem for me. You just have to determine what is best for you. My mom tried it and had to leave it on longer than the instructions indicated as well. Either way, I like the stuff and it gives you a nice peel once you figure out the timing.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for something with same day results! ? Well this is it! ! I use this product because it works best for ingrown hairs, it also gives you moisture with less burns.the shipping is speedy and if you have questions or concerns tue customer service is excellent they help you with any concerns! They respond quickly! This and other products I&#x27;ve used by ASDM BEVERLY HILLS actually brought back my confidence I don&#x27;t have to wear make up anymore plus it&#x27;s safe to use once a week. .please try all there product yourself! You want be disappointed! ! I promise! !</li>
    <li> How much does this chemical peel help to lighten dark knees?</li>
    <li> I love lactic acid since I am an AA woman and this works wonders on my skin !</li>
    <li> Been using it for 2 months. It&#x27;s not a miracle product but it will slowly even out the skin.</li>
    <li> This is the ONLY one I could find on Amazon that did not contain unnecessary, harmful chemicals. It&#x27;s also the only company that seems to be completely forthright in their formulas. Beware of those selling &#x27;pure&#x27; lactic acid. Run like hell to search them elsewhere and get the actual ingredient list. Then ask why they didn&#x27;t list it- up front.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually order with Prime but because of reasons mentioned, I placed the order with this company. Could not be more satisfied. Immediate acknowledgement of order. Followed by timely shipping, tracking, etc. (Timely is not truly fair...I ordered on Friday and received on Monday!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My order came well packaged. The product is in dark GLASS bottles with batch date. I am able to use with no problems as there is ZERO fragrance!&lt;br /&gt;Did I mention they are also very competitively priced, if not, cheaper?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will gradually replace all of my lotions, creams, etc. with this company&#x27;s products. Very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I read many reviews stating that they had started with the 85% peel or that they couldn&#x27;t feel anything from the lower percentage items, so they upgraded. I very much feel the tingling/burning of this 40% and I&#x27;m glad I decided to gradually work my way up.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted. A simple ingredient lactic acid peel. READ and follow the directions. Your experience may differ based on your skin type and needs. But I have great luck with lactic acid.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product for some very annoying whiteheads and light acne on my chin and around the mouth that I&#x27;ve had since switching my birth control last year. I&#x27;ve tried several different washes and products over the past year and none seemed to help as I keep getting whiteheads that want to hang around for months at a time. I finally decided a chemical peel was my best option and ordered this product after seeing the prices of a professional treatment. I wasn&#x27;t in any particular hurry to get any acid burns on my face, though. So as a nervous first-time user, I diluted it to 20% strength, allowed it to sit for about 90 seconds, and washed it off under the shower for 30 seconds. While the product is working, there is a slight burning sensation and a &amp;#34;thick&amp;#34; texture that you feel on your skin while washing it off. After blotting with a towel, your skin will feel much smoother and have a &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34;. At 20% strength, there was no redness and no downtime. I actually followed up with a emollient wrinkle cream that has a much lower lactic acid content (Pond&#x27;s brand) and a generous spread of Acnomel (sulfur and resorcinol). I&#x27;ve done this once a week for the past two weeks and it has made a significant difference in lessening my acne and improving the texture of my skin. Zits are healing and all but the more stubborn whiteheads are gone while those remaining are reduced in size. I think I will continue this for another two weeks and then use it once a month for maintenance. Also, I think this product is a good value because you only need 1-2ml of product if applying with a fan brush so you can get 15-30 applications out of one bottle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it around 4 times.  And I can see a difference .. excited to see how my face will look after using it a lot!</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, has not done anything for my skin at all and I use it full strength, I ordered this because I used it last year and it worked well for me, guess I got a bad bottle.  Will not order this brand again.</li>
    <li> I use the 40% after I used the 88% peel to remove the sun spots for maintenance.  It is very effective in keeping  the brown spots from coming back without burning or stinging.  These peels keep me from forming any new spots. After I apply the peel, usually about once a week or so, I put on 50SPF sun screen. This protects my skin from burning and the Ultra violet rays. It also helps with the peeling process of the 88% peel. If you are new to peels, start low and work up to a higher percentage.  Also have the neutralizer to stop the peel after the allotted time is up. I would definitely recommend this to friends and family If you are plagued with brown spots this is the peel to use.</li>
    <li> Great product and it&#x27;s really &amp;#34;medical strength&amp;#34; so be very careful.  I had been using a 40% lactic acid peel from another company for a while and thought I would try ASDM.  Left it on for 2 minutes (that&#x27;s all I could stand) and the next morning I had blisters under my eyes and got really nervous.  But kept using neosporin throughout the day and the next morning my face looked &amp;#34;softer&amp;#34;.  A week after the peel my skin looks amazing!!!  And I had pretty good skin to start with.  I will use this again but maybe not so close to my eyes, although under my eyes look really good right now.</li>
    <li> Thank you for making this product available for home use.</li>
    <li> I tried it but did really notice  anything but I&#x27;ll keep using it since I bought it</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS AT 70% SOLUTION. 40% NOT STRONG ENOUGH FOR ME, BUT IF YOU HAVE NEVER DONE PEELS BEFORE, MAY WORK GREAT. USE AT 70% 2X&#x27;S PER MONTH WILL GIVE DEEPER PEEL FOR WRINKLES, SCAR IMPROVEMENTS.</li>
    <li> Knock off .. it&#x27;s not even the same item as in the picture</li>
    <li> Ordered Lactic acid in the past.. so am I missing something ? This seems like just water in the bottle. Maybe the percentage was not high enough but I highly doubt so. Amlactin has 12% and you can slightly feel it when put on. I have used 30 % and up to 88% Lactic acid peels so I know how it should feel on MY skin. It might work on someone else skin but not MINE. $10 wasn&#x27;t a waste of money so not freaking out about it. I have been eyeing this company for a while so just really disappointed this happened. Also the bottle I got was not like the picture.</li>
