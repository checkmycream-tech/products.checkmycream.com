      <li>They buy lower to resell &amp; set the prices higher because they paid for that education and earned it and thats how hairdressers make some of there money, commission on products!!!</li>
      <li>I have baby fine, highlighted hair and the top of my head had been over processed.  </li>
      <li>Seems to soften and smooth my hair better than those found in supermarkets.</li>
      <li>As an experienced and well educated Eufora user and salon professional, I think it is important for all buyers to know that when you purchase this product online, that you are *</li>
      <li>lol Also I only wash my hair 2x a week!!!  </li>
      <li>Smooth &#x27;N</li>
      <li>Illuminate Shine Mist - to finish off a look with a light gloss&lt;br /&gt; 8.</li>
      <li>They have Curl, Nourish, Smooth, Volume..</li>
      <li>This product is fantastic for color treated hair.  </li>
      <li>The men and women who legally sell Eufora work closely with Eufora to insure that only the best ingredients are put into your product.  </li>
      <li>Urgent Repair - on occasion as special treatment&lt;</li>
      <li>The important thing is to consult with a knowledgeable hairdresser who can recommend the right products for your hair.</li>
      <li>the product line Eufora has 4 lines of products that do different things but all the same great products!!</li>
      <li>Arrived in quick time frame.</li>
      <li>Eufora Urgent Repair Replenishing Treatment 6oz is a Super Product.  </li>
      <li>LIKE I HAVE A BRAND NEW SET OF HAIR USING EUFORA PRODUCTS:)</li>
      <li>The price is STILL NOT EVEN $65 in my salon &amp;  IT IS ACTUALLY $26 FREE SHIPPING ON AMAZON PRIME FOR THE NEW STYLE!!</li>
      <li>The price is STILL NOT EVEN $65 in my salon &amp;  IT IS ACTUALLY $26 FREE SHIPPING ON AMAZON PRIME FOR THE NEW STYLE!!</li>
      <li>Sites like Amazon and others will NEVER be able to guarantee your product, and most certainly will never teach you how to properly use them.</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s not supposed to be an everyday conditioner, and I consider it a treat--it just feels great on your scalp, especially if you have the luxury of combining the experience with a soak in a nice bubble bath.</li>
      <li>it is a deep conditioning treatment that has a nice minty feeling to the scalp.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff--makes my hair soft.</li>
      <li>These ppl are trying to sell you old products for more money at first</li>
      <li>I first tried Eufora&#x27;s volume fusion spray because a friend recommended it.  </li>
      <li>I was first introduced to this product at my hairdresser&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>I FIRST BOUGHT THIS</li>
      <li>But its still the same just Blue pretty more elegant bottles</li>
      <li>/&gt;It reminds me of just a light natural scent you might get if you walked by a flower stand.  </li>
      <li>It really is!</li>
      <li>My hair had been pretty much destroyed by a hairdresser.  </li>
      <li>I love how it soothes my scalp with the mint, I have irritated scalp, dry and flaky and it helps.  </li>
      <li>Pure Polish</li>
      <li>My hair is so much softer after I use it.</li>
      <li>Not overwhelming or sweet or musky but just light and fresh.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;In fact one of the reasons I got so hooked on trying this stuff was because my hair dresser uses them along with many other products</li>
      <li>and it holds down the static in the winter.</li>
      <li>It is common knowledge that these products can not be trusted as genuine Eufora Product and are often altered and watered down to make more available.  </li>
      <li>It also left the many tangles/knots in my hair from the shampoo use (same brand).  </li>
      <li>When a product like this is diverted to online retailer the only purpose is to make a quick profit.  </li>
      <li>, I had high hopes to go along with the high price.  </li>
      <li>It also leaves my hair so soft and silky!!  </li>
      <li>real* eufora please visit a salon near you and request it.  </li>
      <li>And unlike the other reviewer, I felt it did a fine job of detangling.</li>
      <li>This is the secret to haveing long healthy hair that has been processed so much!!!!</li>
      <li>Fixation Styling Wax - Tame the baby hairs around the face, the little fly aways with this</li>
      <li>it makes my hair feel very soft and revitalized.</li>
      <li>HAVE BOTH THE OLD AND NEW BOTTLES OF SPRAY IN FRONT OF ME</li>
      <li>HAVE BOTH THE OLD AND NEW BOTTLES OF SPRAY IN FRONT OF ME</li>
      <li>Honestly, as a conditioner, there are other products that will do the job just as well for less money, as another reviewer noted.</li>
      <li>Professional SALONS</li>
      <li>Save you money and go see a PROFESSIONAL Stylist, certified in Eufora.</li>
      <li>Eufora products are SALON PROFESSIONAL products for a reason.</li>
      <li>Go to the Eufora site click on products, SEE YOURSELF!&lt;br /&gt;People who ARE TRYING TO INFLATE PRICES ON OLD BOTTLES</li>
      <li>I swim and surf, and I have longish baby-fine hair that is frequently in knots from these activities.</li>
      <li>Professional SALONS</li>
      <li>I even have people come up to me and touch my hair, because it looks so soft.  </li>
      <li>My hair is naturally somewhat curly but frizzy if I have no product in it.  </li>
      <li>My hair combs easily with no more breakage.  </li>
      <li>Eufora works great for me, and as expensive as it is, it&#x27;s cheaper than a trip to the spa!</li>
      <li>ITS THE SAME product so the ppl jacking the price of the older bottles  on this</li>
      <li>ITS EXACTLY THE SAME SMELLS THE SAME WORKS</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product is fantastic for color treated hair.  Appy after shampoo, apply product, cover hair with shower cap for 1/2 hr and you will not believe the shine and fullness of your hair</li>
    <li> Or at least thats what i think. came dirty and product did not work as it is suppose to I spoke with my hair dresser and she asked if i got it online and I said yes. I was expecting the same results as when she had used this on my hair before and this was just a yucky yucky product...whatever it was</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t help my hair but rather left the ends very dry.  It also left the many tangles/knots in my hair from the shampoo use (same brand).  I went back to Rusk for half the price and am much happier.  This 6 oz. tube doesn&#x27;t last very long, either; you have to use a lot, even for medium-length hair.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product line to anyone.</li>
    <li> I was first introduced to this product at my hairdresser&#x27;s. She used it after the companion shampoo, which I also really liked. I had a bad headache that morning, and the peppermint scalp massage worked wonders. Honestly, as a conditioner, there are other products that will do the job just as well for less money, as another reviewer noted. But it&#x27;s not supposed to be an everyday conditioner, and I consider it a treat--it just feels great on your scalp, especially if you have the luxury of combining the experience with a soak in a nice bubble bath. I&#x27;ve been out of it for months, and I miss it. And unlike the other reviewer, I felt it did a fine job of detangling. I swim and surf, and I have longish baby-fine hair that is frequently in knots from these activities. Eufora works great for me, and as expensive as it is, it&#x27;s cheaper than a trip to the spa!</li>
    <li> I am a total convert to Eufora products.  My hair had been pretty much destroyed by a hairdresser.  I have baby fine, highlighted hair and the top of my head had been over processed.  When I washed my hair, I&#x27;d come out of the shower with what appeared to be a haystack on top.  Combing it was awful, it just broke more and more.  I switched hairdressers and was put on Eufora.  I use the Hydrating Shampoo and wash my hair carefully.  I use only a small amount of the Urgent Repair, let it sit in my hair for a few minutes while I finish my shower, and then rinse.  No more straw.  My hair combs easily with no more breakage.  I am very happy with this product and highly recommend it.  In fact, there isn&#x27;t a Eufora product that I&#x27;ve used that I haven&#x27;t liked.  The important thing is to consult with a knowledgeable hairdresser who can recommend the right products for your hair.</li>
    <li> I LOVE the Eufora Urgent Repair Replenishing Treatment.  My hairdresser suggested I use it as a leave-in conditioner as my color treated hair was very dry.  I started using it as she suggested and just let my hair air dry naturally so as not to dry it out.  My hair is naturally somewhat curly but frizzy if I have no product in it.  Even with product, it still has some frizz.  Not so with the Replenishing Treatment!  This is the ONLY stuff I use now.  NO FRIZZ and it conditions my hair at the same time.  I LOVE THIS STUFF!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Eufora products are SALON PROFESSIONAL products for a reason. It is hurting our industry and all the time and money we invest in education, so we can educate our clients, for sites like this and, sleekhair.com to \\&quot;bootleg\\&quot; Eufora products. Sites like Amazon and others will NEVER be able to guarantee your product, and most certainly will never teach you how to properly use them. Save you money and go see a PROFESSIONAL Stylist, certified in Eufora.</li>
    <li> I have baby fine fly away hair.  I was looking for a conditioner that did not have a lot of silicones in it.  This was recommended by a salon.  I bought it at the salon, I had high hopes to go along with the high price.  I thought it would help me with tangles, did nothing.</li>
    <li> so I bought it to use at home - not so great for the price - the Loreal 5 repair is much better and 1/3 the cost</li>
    <li> love love love it!!!!! The best conditioner I have ever tried!!!!!  I even have people come up to me and touch my hair, because it looks so soft.  It really is! and it holds down the static in the winter.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product!! My salon uses eufora products and whenever I get my hair done my stylist always massages this into my hair. it is a deep conditioning treatment that has a nice minty feeling to the scalp. the key is to massage this deep into your hair. also, the longer you leasve this product on, the better it works. it makes my hair feel very soft and revitalized. I like it alot.</li>
    <li> Happy to find these online so I don&#x27;t have to search for a salon that carries the brand.</li>
    <li> My doctor recommend this product.  I am not sure if this is the product as she just told me it would help stimulate and stop hair loss. Was this the correct product.  She just called it Eufora Urgent Repair.&lt;br /&gt;Please let me know if their is a better product.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;Peggy</li>
    <li> Love this treatment.  Adds moisture and hair is soft/smooth after treatment.</li>
    <li> Hello.  As an experienced and well educated Eufora user and salon professional, I think it is important for all buyers to know that when you purchase this product online, that you are *NOT* getting what you pay for.  Eufora is a professional product that should only be purchased in a salon.  The men and women who legally sell Eufora work closely with Eufora to insure that only the best ingredients are put into your product.  When a product like this is diverted to online retailer the only purpose is to make a quick profit.  It is common knowledge that these products can not be trusted as genuine Eufora Product and are often altered and watered down to make more available.  This product is an ALOE based product and should not contain a single drop of water in it.  Water compromises the integrity of this product and it *WILL NOT* work as intended.  If you would like to use *real* eufora please visit a salon near you and request it.  Good Luck!</li>
    <li> I SO..SO..SO LOVE THIS PRODUCT! BEST HAIR CARE PRODUCT THAT I&#x27;VE EVER USED! FEELS LIKE I HAVE A BRAND NEW SET OF HAIR USING EUFORA PRODUCTS:) SO HAPPY I FOUND ON AMAZON...CAUSE IT COST $30 AT MY HAIR SALON! I&#x27;VE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR ALMOST A YEAR NOW! I&#x27;M IN LOVE WITH \\&quot;EUFORA PRODUCTS\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I first tried Eufora&#x27;s volume fusion spray because a friend recommended it.  I have fine, thin hair and the spray gave me some volume. Next I tried the thickening serum and the sculpture glaze. So why not try their shampoo and conditioner. The shampoo leaves my hair shiny and the conditioner helps dry ends from using the hair dryer.  Great products!</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this product by my hair stylist to improve the condition of my hair. I use it every time I wash myhair and often as a deeper conditioner. Seems to soften and smooth my hair better than those found in supermarkets. I&#x27;ll keep using it until I find something better.</li>
    <li> My wife has been buying this from her hairdresser and paying over $30 for it.  I found it here on Amazon for almost half that.  She uses it about once a week where she leaves it in for about 15 minutes and the protein leaves her hair feeling stronger and healthier.</li>
    <li> Eufora Urgent Repair Replenishing Treatment 6oz is a Super Product.  These products speak for themselves.  All I can say is BUY it.</li>
    <li> This product arrived on time and met my expectations.  It is great for my hair.  I would recommend this product to a friend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Eufora products for maybe 10 years or more now?  I love all of the products I have used. I have naturally curly hair which can be prone to being frizzy or dry, and these products really help.  Some I use regularly and others on occasion.  The scent on this stuff is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact one of the reasons I got so hooked on trying this stuff was because my hair dresser uses them along with many other products and I was always going around smelling how good she smelled and wondering what perfum she was wearing.  However this is the type of scent that doesn&#x27;t interfere with regular perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It reminds me of just a light natural scent you might get if you walked by a flower stand.  Not overwhelming or sweet or musky but just light and fresh.  I get a lot of comments on my hair smelling nice as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use these products:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 1. Moisture solution conditioner - regular conditioner&lt;br /&gt; 2. Moisture cleanse shampoo - regular shampoo&lt;br /&gt; 3. Hydration leave in conditioner - leave-in conditioner&lt;br /&gt; 4. Urgent Repair - on occasion as special treatment&lt;br /&gt; 5. Beautifying serum - to tame frizz and dead ends daily&lt;br /&gt; 6. Sculpture Styling Glaze - when I need some hold on occasion&lt;br /&gt; 7. Illuminate Shine Mist - to finish off a look with a light gloss&lt;br /&gt; 8. Fortifi Strength Spray - daily to enhance strength of hair&lt;br /&gt; 9. Pure Polish Finishing Drops - Works the same as the beautifying serum, except I was say for situations when you have especially course, curly or dry hair.  Beautifying serum is a little lighter.&lt;br /&gt;10. Curl &#x27;N Defining Solution - when I need some hold on occasion&lt;br /&gt;11. Curl Revitalizer and Spray - when I don&#x27;t have time to wash my hair and just want to plump up and freshen the scent of my curls&lt;br /&gt;12. Smooth &#x27;N Straightening Balm - on the occasions when I want to straighten my hair&lt;br /&gt;13. Fixation Styling Wax - Tame the baby hairs around the face, the little fly aways with this</li>
    <li> Smells good, works well</li>
    <li> This is a great repair conditioner - has to be used sparingly</li>
    <li> Love the product. Arrived in quick time frame.</li>
    <li> This repair treatment is excellent.  I love how it soothes my scalp with the mint, I have irritated scalp, dry and flaky and it helps.  It also leaves my hair so soft and silky!!  One of the best repair treatments I have tried.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years, it really is great. Expensive but you can use a lot less than other conditioners.</li>
    <li> I love this product. My hair is so much softer after I use it. I know it is supposed to be a once a week product but I replaced my regular conditioner with it and use it every time I wash my hair.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff--makes my hair soft. It has mint in it so it&#x27;s soothing as well.</li>
    <li> I love it! I have been using it for a while now.</li>
    <li> If your hair is damaged especially from bleach YOU NEED THIS PRODUCT!!! I am a licensed Cosmetologist but practicing Makeup artist my back is too bad for hair!! but my friend at my salon took classes with Eufora and raves and started selling them for our salon and omg!! I cant say enough will never use regular conditioner AGAIN!!! This is the secret to haveing long healthy hair that has been processed so much!!!! People are always touching it they never believe its &amp;#34;real&amp;#34;? lol Also I only wash my hair 2x a week!!!  You cant wash every day  it strips it of natural oils if you feel you must at least cut it down to every other and use this with the Spray!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOW LETS DISCUSS THIS INFLATION OF PRICE!!! I FIRST BOUGHT THIS ON AMAZON JUNE 25TH 2014 FOR $18.75 &amp; I NEEDED MORE ONLY TO SEE THE PRICE WAS NOW $50!!! NOW ITS $65?? This HAS new packaging but ITS NO DIFFERENT?? ITS THE SAME product so the ppl jacking the price of the older bottles  on this and the FORTIFI spray  cuz the spray now has keratin in the title, PPL THINK ITS DIFFERENT!!! But its still the same just Blue pretty more elegant bottles YEA THE SPRAY HAS 8.4oz now and the other had 10oz WORTH DOUBLE THE PRICE NO!!! These ppl are trying to sell you old products for more money at first I thought it was different but I obviously asked my friend who has her PhD licence by Eufora (Professional Hair Dresser) Which just means you continue education with them and you have a licence to distribute so by law you need this to sell Eufora? Google it? Go to there website!! GUESS WHAT EUFORA revamped there image making updates with PACKAGE AND CHANGED UP THE NAMES A BIT adding NOURISH to the repair treatment because thats the product line Eufora has 4 lines of products that do different things but all the same great products!! They have Curl, Nourish, Smooth, Volume..Go to the Eufora site click on products, SEE YOURSELF!&lt;br /&gt;People who ARE TRYING TO INFLATE PRICES ON OLD BOTTLES do you have hair salons? I dont know how you sell but if you dont have a PhD by Eufora but you know the rules and cant be selling on these sites! Professional SALONS ONLY, SO GET OUT OF HERE!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I HAVE BOTH THE OLD AND NEW BOTTLES OF SPRAY IN FRONT OF ME ALL INGREDIENTS ARE EXACTLY THE SAME IN THE SAME ORDER EXCEPT THE NEW BOTTLES HAVE 2 EXTRA BENEFICIAL INGREDIENTS AT THE END of the Nourish Fortifi Keratin Repair Spray!!! AS FOR THIS EUFORA NOURISH URGENT REPAIR TREATMENT ITS EXACTLY THE SAME SMELLS THE SAME WORKS THE SAME &amp; is the SAME 6OZ!!! Now its JUST A PRETTIER BOTTLE!!!&lt;br /&gt; Dont be FOOLED...Salons who sell Eufora have a PhD or a Hair Dresser who DOES!!! They buy lower to resell &amp; set the prices higher because they paid for that education and earned it and thats how hairdressers make some of there money, commission on products!!!
