<li> HOWEVER it is not good for cosplay.</li>
<li> It isn&#x27;t uncomfortable or anything.</li>
<li> But it&#x27;s not too bad.</li>

    <li> I got this for my cosplay, I bought two so my friend could be outer moka and I can be inner moka. Its actual metal and the material is good. Great for cosplay, nothing wrong with it at all. I love iiiit &amp;#60;3333</li>
