      <li>My daughter is 8 years old</li>
      <li>It works really well to detangle wet hair without pulling.</li>
      <li>The bristles aren&#x27;t soft, so you have to be very gentle near the scalp with the little ones, but that didn&#x27;t make us like it any less.</li>

    <li> My daughter used to flinch when she got her hair brushed, and she wanted to try this. It works really well to detangle wet hair without pulling. I tried it out to see if it was as great as she claimed, and it got through my wet hair very easily, without pulling, in about half the time as a regular brush. She will sit and brush her hair for a long time with this brush!</li>
    <li> As advertised, and good quality.</li>
    <li> My daughters love the brush--but do not use a hair dryer with it!  I made this mistake and melted the bristles and my daughters are mad at me ;) the product info does say not to use a hairdryer ... Good detangler :)</li>
    <li> My daughter has long, thick, straight brunette hair. She is eight years old and her hair is healthy. We needed a brush that could detangle her hair from bedtime tangles. This brush was not the answer. The bristles are flimsy. The brush is hard. It didn&#x27;t even detangle as well as a regular paddle brush. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Helped with my niece&#x27;s natural curly hair- no more tears!</li>
    <li> Only brushes top portion of hair while matting the underlayers.</li>
    <li> quick delivery and Quality</li>
    <li> My daughter used to take 30 minutes to brush her hair each night because of the tangles.  This brush is a miracle brush.  As soon as we received it she tried it. It combed right through her hair, no problem.  I can&#x27;t say enough about how great this brush is!!!</li>
    <li> My daughter is 8 years old we finally found a brush that detangles pain free. LOVE IT</li>
    <li> Little girl always complains about her mom brushing her hair and it hurting a lot. So she got this as an early holiday gift. She doesn&#x27;t mind getting her hair brushed anymore.    Here is her review by the girl who got it: THIS IS THE BEST BRUSH I&#x27;VE USED IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.    Does it hurt anymore when she brushes it?  Nope!    UPDATE ON REVIEW:     Her statements on it: The brush is horrible! It hurts! I noticed that in the commercial her hair was already fine. Now that I look at it it seems like they just wanted to make it look perfect. They probably just wanted to take money.    My mom bought a different brush and it works better! It&#x27;s like 1 and a half of a star.    Her mom found a better brush at Marshall&#x27;s and it works better.</li>
    <li> Brushing my daughters hair is so much easier with this. She has curly hair that tangles easily. With or without detangling spray, I can get the job done quickly and easily with this brush. She loves it when her dad brushes her hair. The bristles aren&#x27;t soft, so you have to be very gentle near the scalp with the little ones, but that didn&#x27;t make us like it any less. Brought another one for my son whose hair is thicker and curlier. He loves his too and is brushing his hair more now.</li>
    <li> Nothing else worked to detangle my daughter&#x27;s fine textured, medium volume hair. Now there is no pain or crying when brushing through her hair. Great product. Thank you.!</li>
    <li> We bought one in Japan and loved it, glad Amazon has it now !!</li>
    <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!&lt;br /&gt;I got this for my daughter because she has problems with tangles. We got this and she was SO excited, but when I tried to use it she SCREAMED. She said it hurt more than the regular brush. Her hair gets brushed on a daily basis, so its not like she had some huge know that the brush couldn&#x27;t get through. The Bristles are HORRIBLE. I thought they would be sort of soft, but they are very unforgiving. I tried it in my hair and it didn&#x27;t smooth it, it looked like I brushed it with a cheap dollar store brush. I have curly hair, so my tangles can be intense. It added an extra five minutes to my brushing time. Most expensive dog brush I&#x27;ve ever bought, he loves it!</li>
    <li> The tines aren&#x27;t deep enough.</li>
    <li> Very good brush! My daughters favorite.</li>
    <li> amazing!  No tears from my daughter!</li>
    <li> this brush is amazing! i run ot through my daughters hair once and it is tangle free and beautiful. no more crying. shes actually excited when its time to brush her hair now</li>
    <li> My daughter has wanted this brush for a couple years and was so excited to get it</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work at all. Big disappointment.....</li>
    <li> When I saw this on TV, I immediately ordered one. But when I actually tested it out myself, it didn&#x27;t do anything. after a few days the bristles were bent and it started pulling my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now have the Wet Brush and it is soo much better</li>
    <li> this is such a great hair brush! So worth your money!!!!!</li>
    <li> Ouch!  The tangle teaser is a much better product for detangling hair.  Neither of my daughters like this brush.  They say it hurts and pulls their hair.  Would not recommend.</li>
