      <li>Plus, you just use with your own floss</li>

      <li>makes flossing very easy and a delight.  </li>
      <li>perfect so far.</li>
      <li>Good product and quick shipment.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this type flossing tool before, and after many years of use, it broke.  </li>
      <li>but for me, I don&#x27;t know how they could make it any better.</li>
      <li>and I absolutely love it.  </li>
      <li>They make a lot more money that way.</li>
      <li>they&#x27;re going to insist on a bunch more words here before they&#x27;ll accept my review.)</li>
      <li>but what can you do?&lt;br /&gt;Pretty sure this was advertised by the seller as being a two pack</li>
      <li>This seems like a better design.</li>
      <li>this flosser sure does beat trying to use my fingers.</li>
      <li>and I now get rave reviews after every check up!&lt;br /&gt;Since then, I have bought many more for kids, grandkids and friends - they all thank me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t seen anything better in all these years.</li>
      <li>After many years of use (5 to 10 years?)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this device for many years after my dentist gave me one.</li>
      <li>This one is more durable than the one I used before</li>
      <li>/&gt;Fourth point, squeeze the tines of the handle together while you are installing the floss, for more tension.</li>
      <li>Shouldn&#x27;t most people?</li>
      <li>please try it, you will love it.</li>
      <li>The Butler Gum Flossmate Handle works much better than trying to floss with it</li>
      <li>Great item, so much easier to floss.  </li>
      <li>Assuming you floss once a day, thats almost $12 every month, way more than what you would otherwise spend on floss!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The difference is that the gap between the button and the handle is much greater on this Flossmate than on the original one I own.</li>
      <li>very clean to use as compared to putting your hands inside your mouth.  </li>
      <li>The first Butler version used a rigid plastic that held up fairly well. . .</li>
      <li>Wish I had found something like this so many years ago to keep my gums and Chicklets clean and healthy.</li>
      <li>After using one for quite sometime for flossing my teeth, I was pleased to find out the Flossmate Handle was exactly what I needed!!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s too strong for dental floss.</li>
      <li>The one star it deserves from me is for the seemingly strong and flexible material  it is made of.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice to know that the Butler flosser that I first bought and used decades ago is still being sold.</li>
      <li>The most important part to clean is the button and the gap under it.</li>
      <li>It is too large to be really nice to use.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really great as a &amp;#34;back teeth toothpick&amp;#34; when I get something stuck between my back teeth</li>
      <li>Luckily, mine is still going strong.</li>
      <li>the original Butler Co.?</li>
      <li>Works as well as the original one I lost.</li>
      <li>Would still like them to use the original material</li>
      <li>I have one of the original Flossmates made by Butler.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Third point, after you use the handle, CLEAN IT.</li>
      <li>and then I wash it in the dishwasher (silverware tray) to clean it.</li>
      <li>Your dentist will be happy with you and will think you spent hours on your teeth.</li>
      <li>My husband loved his, but I&#x27;m getting the Butlfer GUM Flosbrush for myself and my son because we have smaller mouths.</li>
      <li>Oh, a couple more things... a rubber band or top of a disposable latex glove works well for an emergency flosser and plastic cut from trays cookies and such come in work as emergency toothpicks!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>cheaper plastic is way too flexible: bending &amp; deforming quickly - requiring you to soon repurchase a stiffer/newer replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I suspect that some handles dont get as much glue as others, so thats why some people complain that theirs broke easily.</li>
      <li>It is durable and strong so if you need to really &amp;#34;work&amp;#34; the dental floss, you can.</li>
      <li>Moisture will lubricate the floss and prevent the button from getting a good grip on it, leading to the floss getting loose halfway through your flossing.</li>
      <li>I have been using these for most of my adult life.</li>
      <li>This is one of those items that you come across through life that become worth far more than their price.</li>
      <li>Just put a drop of krazy glue in there, press the button on it, and you&#x27;re golden</li>
      <li>those are straight and not near as easy to use or as effective...</li>
      <li>USE FOR FLOSSING, GREAT QUALITY, EASY TO USE, WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ALL AGES TO ENCOURAGE GOOD DENTAL HEALTH - UNABLE TO FIND THEM ON THE OPEN MARKET...</li>
      <li>You choose the floss that&#x27;s right for you.</li>
      <li>Wrapped very well, no damage;  was as advertised; arrived quickly.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Second point, make sure the handle, the floss, and your hands are completely clean and dry when you install the floss on it.</li>
      <li>Exactly as ordered.</li>
      <li>By the time my first one broke</li>
      <li>My first one didn&#x27;t break: I lost it about a year ago.</li>
      <li>I bought my first one at a drugstore, when they were still being sold in retail stores.</li>
      <li>The first one I had lasted 13 years.  </li>
      <li>This works exactly as designed and is durable, too.  </li>
      <li>It is at least 25 years old and works perfectly with either normal dental floss or the newer wider floss tapes.</li>
      <li>The distance between the fingers is too large, and the arms are too flexible.  </li>
      <li>If I could not find one of these, I would probably pay $30 or more to have one if I could find one new on ebay or similar, I like it that much.</li>
      <li>And it doesnt really break, it just falls off, because it is glued on.</li>
      <li>I have been using the Butler brand for year and agree with others that the Flossmate works really well.</li>
      <li>Works very well.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really have to use THAT much floss</li>
      <li>Delevery was within a couple days of ordering, which is much appreciated.</li>
      <li>Just get the proper poundage to fit the diameter needed.</li>
      <li>Lost mine on a trip and finally found it available here.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know why it was taken off the market in stores, but I&#x27;m grateful to Amazon that they have it at a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>Works very well.  </li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>I swear this thing makes flossing so much easier.</li>
      <li>- this is much easier than reloading every day.  </li>
      <li>I suspect that these things stopped being sold in retail stores because the manufacturer wants you to buy their plastic floss toothpicks with preinstalled floss instead.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I&#x27;ve had to hold the floss in my fingers since my last floss holder broke, and it&#x27;s a blessing to have a floss holder again! I don&#x27;t know why it was taken off the market in stores, but I&#x27;m grateful to Amazon that they have it at a reasonable price. Delevery was within a couple days of ordering, which is much appreciated. Thank you!</li>
    <li> This is exactly what we were looking for and unable to find in any of the stores.</li>
    <li> Great item, so much easier to floss.  The first one I had lasted 13 years.  Hoping the next one will last as long.</li>
    <li> This is a good flosser. My only gripe is that it does not store floss in the handle. To use a new piece of floss you have to unstring the thing, cut a new piece of floss, then restring the handle. Tedious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish they made a flosser that can hold a spool of floss, like my old Dr. Flosser, a discontinued product by a now-defunct company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I notice that the floss does not wrap around the individual tooth so I can only floss the sides of the tooth, not in back or in front of the tooth below the gumline. I will ask my dentist about the usefulness of this on my next visit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this flosser sure does beat trying to use my fingers.</li>
    <li> I recently lost one of these and had to mail order it since none of my local stores had them.  Basically, I would never floss if it was not for this device.  For me, it is a must have!</li>
    <li> I got my first Flossmate several years ago and didn&#x27;t like it.  The floss kept shredding or breaking and I would have to scroll to a new spot several times or start with a new piece and that just made the whole process take longer.    Once I discovered the ribbon-style floss, I decided to give the Flossmate another try and I absolutely love it.  What I always hated about flossing was the floss tightening around my fingers (my teeth are too close together so it&#x27;s difficult to get the floss between some of them) and actually hurting just a bit by the time I was done.  I also have long-ish fingernails and if I had a snag in the wrong nail in the wrong place, the floss would catch and make it worse.  The Flossmate takes care of both of these issues.    My process is to squeeze the prongs together when I load the Flossmate.  I do 1 quadrant then, leaving the floss in the same place, I retighten by squeezing the prongs again and do another quadrant.  I scroll to a new spot and repeat for the remaining quadrants.  Works like a charm.</li>
    <li> This flossmate is different from the one that I have and am using as the material is harder for the new one. I feel that if the new one was to be dropped it may crack or break. I have dropped the one that I have had for years and nothing happened to it. My teenage daughter is using one of the new one&#x27;s that I purchased. I purchased 3 since I am unable to find them in any stores and the internet was the only place that I did find them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this type flossing tool before, and after many years of use, it broke.  So, I&#x27;m very satisfied with the replacement.</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t keep floss like &#x27;glide&#x27; on this device.</li>
    <li> If you are not currently flossing and want to start. Or wrapping floss around you fingers the old fashion way...you MUST try this product. I think I&#x27;ve been using this product for at least 15 years and just bought six of them because the drug chains have discontinued it. (I&#x27;m 70 so they just might outlast my teeth). You choose the floss that&#x27;s right for you. It&#x27;s easy to use. And it lasts a long, long time.</li>
    <li> Works as well as the original one I lost. Would still like them to use the original material but I expect it to last a long time.</li>
    <li> floss slips out of the groves,poor product,i only used it a couple of times and had trouble each time</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for years. I have a very small mouth so getting my hands way in the back to floss is impossible. You load this baby up and off you go. The other great thing about it is that is ISN&#x27;T those disposable daily floss holders, which are a waste of resources and an unnecessary load on landfills.</li>
    <li> A great product that is easy to use &amp; dependable.</li>
    <li> Stringing and continually re-adjusting the floss through the device to get enough tension is not very easy. Not happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> This flossmate handle did not work out for me, my boyfriend, or his dad. The floss just gets really loose and does not do the job.</li>
    <li> The first Butler version used a rigid plastic that held up fairly well. . . .BUT then the company &amp;#34;new &amp; improved&amp;#34; it!&lt;br /&gt;This cheaper plastic is way too flexible: bending &amp; deforming quickly - requiring you to soon repurchase a stiffer/newer replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend the Flossaid brand, I discovered it 20 years ago and I now get rave reviews after every check up!&lt;br /&gt;Since then, I have bought many more for kids, grandkids and friends - they all thank me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I found Flossaid, my gums bled a lot because my fingers were just too big for manual flossing.&lt;br /&gt;This device EASILY reached waaay back to my crooked morals and roots. I was sold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried every other brand but none worked as well. Flossaid is stronger, wider, more rigid (the Butler flosser bends/warps quickly &amp; does not allow enough room to move the floss up &amp; down below my gum line).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This device also allows me to dip floss into an antibacterial solution (prescription) that helps my gums a lot.&lt;br /&gt;It also helps me apply a prescription 1.1% fluoride solution to help my exposed/receding roots.  (I was born with bad teeth)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy several Flossmates, you won&#x27;t regret it.  . . . . .  dave in austin, texas&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
    <li> Works very well. I like using it.</li>
    <li> I was never able to floss regularly thanks to large hands and a tremor. Some years ago the VA gave me the Butler Flossmate and I was hooked. The Flossmate makes flossing easier than the brushing itself and has greatly improved my dental hygiene.</li>
    <li> Best flosser i&#x27;ve ever used. The thread stays tight, and is replaceable!</li>
    <li> This did not help me floss at all, the floss popped off the tips constantly.  I threw it in the garbage.</li>
    <li> I swear this thing makes flossing so much easier. By joe! Oh golly oh jee it sure is swell! bhk</li>
    <li> It is too large to be really nice to use.  That aside it works well and if it lasts, will be an excellent buy</li>
    <li> USE FOR FLOSSING, GREAT QUALITY, EASY TO USE, WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ALL AGES TO ENCOURAGE GOOD DENTAL HEALTH - UNABLE TO FIND THEM ON THE OPEN MARKET...THANK GOODNESS FOR AMAZON</li>
    <li> Only the length and shape of the handle are different. Also, if you skip reading the directions, you won&#x27;t know to squeeze the prongs together a bit when wrapping the dental floss in order to get a tight fit. It works great with all kinds of floss. My husband loved his, but I&#x27;m getting the Butlfer GUM Flosbrush for myself and my son because we have smaller mouths.</li>
    <li> I have a small mouth and its hard to get the dental floss into my back teeth but with the flossmate handle it&#x27;s a breeze.</li>
    <li> Works very well.  Wish I had found something like this so many years ago to keep my gums and Chicklets clean and healthy.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for over 10 years.My old one was in need of replacement, but could not find one anywhere locally. Was very happy to find this product on this web site, in fact after ordering the first oe, I ordered 2 more, in case they are ever discontinued.</li>
    <li> Too expensive and too large for small mouth persons. I was also very disappointed that this item couldn&#x27;t be better explained as to size so I could have better judged whether it was worthwhile paying such a high price for such a small product. Adding to the enormous Flossmate Handle cost was the cost of shipping.  The one star it deserves from me is for the seemingly strong and flexible material  it is made of.</li>
    <li> This review is from: Butler Floss Mate Handle - 845R - Pack of 1 - Assorted colors (Blue or Red) (Health and Beauty)&lt;br /&gt;I just want to add my praise for a great product... Many of my teeth, especially when I was younger were so tight together even dental hygienist&#x27;s would shred floss trying to get between them. I found it annoying and cumbersome to try and floss properly with my fingers holding the floss and I hated getting my fingers all full of saliva, besides, even though some people might say that I have a big mouth, my mouth doesn&#x27;t open all that wide compared to others, and my fingers may be a little bigger than most, so for all these reasons I hated to floss. I still don&#x27;t like to floss, but if it weren&#x27;t for the Butler Floss Mate, I wouldn&#x27;t floss as often as I do. It&#x27;s really great as a &amp;#34;back teeth toothpick&amp;#34; when I get something stuck between my back teeth and it absolutely has to be removed before it drives me crazy, this thing saves the day. This is the best thing I have ever found to do the job easily, cleanly and well. I still have some teeth that are hard to get between, and find that when you apply floss to the floss mate if you squeeze the prongs together when applying the floss it will be tighter and not flex as much when trying to work the floss between tight teeth, but it will give less &amp;#34;working&amp;#34; space to &amp;#34;saw&amp;#34; the floss between the teeth. This is one of those items that you come across through life that become worth far more than their price. If I could not find one of these, I would probably pay $30 or more to have one if I could find one new on ebay or similar, I like it that much. Luckily, mine is still going strong. I could be wrong, but I think I have had it for at least 22 years. I am only here on Amazon looking for this product because I have often wanted to have at least one spare, in case mine ever breaks, and to have one for travel, but also to be able to give to friends and family, though I never seem to getaround to buying them. I have read a review here that mentioned the newer models don&#x27;t have as deep a channel for the floss and so I suppose I will have to order just one first to see if the quality is still there as I often add two layers of floss at a time, depending on the floss used and also sometimes &amp;#34;flex&amp;#34; the prongs for a tighter floss, as the sawing motion used to get between tight teeth can flex the prongs and the floss can come loose and some flosses can stretch a bit as well, but one quickly learns how to adjust the tension for their personal needs. They should have multiple colors so each member of the family could have their own color for obvious reasons. I haven&#x27;t seen anything better in all these years. I hope they don&#x27;t go out of business or quit manufacturing this product as you only need to buy one for a lifetime, if mine and some other reviewers results are any indication, so once everyone in the country has one sales really diminish. I know this sounds like I have something to gain by promoting this product so highly, but I merely want to contribute to the review process, as I always use them to help me make decisions before making a purchase, and I also want to promote a fine product. Of course, you may be able to open your mouth large enough to park a truck in, with long, slender fingers and gaps between your teeth large enough that a pipe cleaner would better suit you,so you have to try one for yourself to see.. but for me, I don&#x27;t know how they could make it any better. Now all I need is to find some great floss... I have tried them all. Toothpaste floss, woven, plastic, high shred resistant name brands and store brands, but they either leave fibers between the tight teeth or feel like they want to cut my gums or just break too easily. I just had an Idea... I was thinking of describing a great floss as being able to work like a rope between your teeth but feel like a piece of yarn and yet be thin enough to get between tight teeth without shredding, and the thought of using one of the super fishing lines came to mind and may work well. Just get the proper poundage to fit the diameter needed. Could be expensive to discover the right combination though. Oh, a couple more things... a rubber band or top of a disposable latex glove works well for an emergency flosser and plastic cut from trays cookies and such come in work as emergency toothpicks!&lt;br /&gt;I posted this review years ago but for someone else selling it... I just now see that it is being sold by Butler themselves... the original Butler Co.? I dont  know... but I am copying and pasting it here now as well... I see where some have said the button is glued on and the newer models have a wider gap that makes it hard to keep the floss tight... I hope that is not the case... if it is I suppose I would saw the button off and re-glue it... and for those that keep comparing these to those throwaway flossers is senseless... these are nothing like those... these are like a wishbone .. those are straight and not near as easy to use or as effective...</li>
    <li> This handle works well with tight fitting contacts.  It is durable and strong so if you need to really &amp;#34;work&amp;#34; the dental floss, you can.</li>
    <li> I have been using these for years. They work really well and last quite a long time. The only problem I have had with these is that the little knob that you wrap the floss around breaks off after a while. To stop this I have been drilling a small hole through the middle of the knob and putting in a brass screw and nut before I use it the first time. This makes it last about twice as long.    Recently I found another product (Flossaid) [[ASIN:B000UQ9OGK Flossaid Dental Floss Holder - 3 Pack]] that is very similar, but comes with a rivet already in it. This seems like a better design. I have been using this one for about three months now and it works just as well as the Flossmate. I haven&#x27;t been been using it long enough to say if it is better than the Flossmate or not, but it seems like it will be.</li>
    <li> This flossmate Handle is great.  Everyone should have one.  I would never floss my teeth without thei handle.  By one and you will be happy.  Your dentist will be happy with you and will think you spent hours on your teeth.</li>
    <li> Does what the dentist expects me to do.  Remove food and plaque between my teeth, especially the lower front teeth.</li>
    <li> Exactly as ordered. Works great. Wish it were a little smaller to make using with a child easier.</li>
    <li> This was my favorite before I tried the Flossaid, but I find the Flossaid holds the floss with less slipping.&lt;br /&gt;(Now they&#x27;re going to insist on a bunch more words here before they&#x27;ll accept my review.)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this device for many years after my dentist gave me one. (I have a bad hand so normal flossing was difficult and time-consuming - so I didn&#x27;t floss prior to using this).  After many years of use (5 to 10 years?) mine finally broke and I couldn&#x27;t find a replacement locally in stores.  I found this - the identical device - and it works as well as my previous one.</li>
    <li> Been using this for at least twenty years.  Can&#x27;t find it in stores.</li>
    <li> A must have for flossing. I had a dentist forced me to use it or come back for teeth pulling. Use this for the front of your grill to the vampire teeth. Clean the upper wisdom teeth. Nothing else will clean that upper wisdom tooth that a brush does not reach.</li>
    <li> So simple and exactly what I was looking for to facilitate flossing for my kids.  I hate things that aren&#x27;t reusable.  Wind the floss around the knob twice, push tines in a little for floss tension, wind floss around knob again. Remove &amp; repeat.  perfect so far.</li>
    <li> Like this flosser.  It&#x27;s sturdy and does the job.  I wish the handle was a bit longer but what can you do?&lt;br /&gt;Pretty sure this was advertised by the seller as being a two pack and I only got one.  So if you order this you might want to do a screen capture so you&#x27;ll know what you ordered.</li>
    <li> Looked for 2 years for one and then bam it was here.</li>
    <li> kinda slippery, and a little flimsy.</li>
    <li> Works really great to do a great job in flossing teeth.  My friends also use it and are very pleased.</li>
    <li> I picked this up after a dentist told me I had to floss ALL my teeth, not just the ones I could reach!  This works exactly as designed and is durable, too.  Plus, you just use with your own floss so you don&#x27;t have to keep buying those disposable flosser tools.  I&#x27;ve had mine for probably 5 years and ended up getting a second so that I could keep one for travel.  Every now and then I wash it in the dishwasher (silverware tray) to clean it. Works like a charm.</li>
    <li> I have used a flossmate for 20 years and it broke.  I couldn&#x27;t find a replacement anywhere until now.  I love these since I have such a small mouth.  I purchased 3 in case they disappear over the next 20 years.</li>
    <li> If I could give this 0 stars.  The floss comes off every time I floss one or two teeth.  It doesn&#x27;t matter how many times I wrap around or how tight I wrap it.  I get the same results.  Am I doing something wrong???  I know I have a really tight space between the teeth but dang.  Shouldn&#x27;t most people?</li>
    <li> The distance between the fingers is too large, and the arms are too flexible.  When you push the floss between your teeth, you &amp;#34;load&amp;#34; the arms and flex the floss.  When the floss breaks into the space between the teeth that &amp;#34;load&amp;#34; is released and it slams into your gums.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe the gaps between my teeth are small and tight, but isn&#x27;t that why we floss?</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s not to like?  This gets me to perform a necessary chore and I&#x27;m all for anything that makes this easier.</li>
    <li> After using one for quite sometime for flossing my teeth, I was pleased to find out the Flossmate Handle was exactly what I needed!!  The Butler Gum Flossmate Handle works much better than trying to floss with it tied around your fingers.  Also, there is much less floss used!! It&#x27;s the only way to floss!</li>
    <li> makes flossing very easy and a delight.  very clean to use as compared to putting your hands inside your mouth.  please try it, you will love it.</li>
    <li> Wrapped very well, no damage;  was as advertised; arrived quickly.  Thanks</li>
    <li> These are awesome. This one is more durable than the one I used before... I&#x27;ve been using this one for about a year now.</li>
    <li> I have been using these for most of my adult life. I bought my first one at a drugstore, when they were still being sold in retail stores. By the time my first one broke (in the late 1990&#x27;s), they were no longer sold in stores. I searched everywhere. Then I looked at the brand name stamped on the handle, and did an internet search, and voila, found that Butler was selling them directly online! Since they were no longer sold in stores, and I checked really hard, I thought it may be just a matter of time before Butler simply stopped making them. Sometimes corporate decisions dont always make sense, like why would McDonalds offer McRibs only occasionally instead of all the time. To safeguard against Butler doing the unspeakable, I decided to buy a WHOLE BUNCH (12) in both blue and red colors. Luckily, since then I&#x27;ve only broken one more, so I may have a lifetime supply on my hands. And I want to offer some advice to everyone here, as a longtime experienced user of this fine product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the part that breaks is the button. And it doesnt really break, it just falls off, because it is glued on. I suspect that some handles dont get as much glue as others, so thats why some people complain that theirs broke easily. I just thought of something, which I will try if my current one breaks again. I could just krazy-glue the button back on. The place where it goes has a little dimple to match up with the button&#x27;s conical shape. Just put a drop of krazy glue in there, press the button on it, and you&#x27;re golden (hopefully).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second point, make sure the handle, the floss, and your hands are completely clean and dry when you install the floss on it. Moisture will lubricate the floss and prevent the button from getting a good grip on it, leading to the floss getting loose halfway through your flossing. Moisture can get in there if the handle is wet, or if your hands are wet, causing the floss to be wet. I also suspect that some people wind the floss really really tightly to compensate for the lack of grip. This helps a little bit, but at the expense of causing the button to break off sooner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third point, after you use the handle, CLEAN IT. Either rinse it really well with hot water or actually use some liquid soap. The most important part to clean is the button and the gap under it. This cleaning is necessary because while you floss, your drool can run down the handle and coat the area under the button. Then next time you use it, the dried drool will lubricate the floss, causing slippage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fourth point, squeeze the tines of the handle together while you are installing the floss, for more tension. I think several other people have mentioned this too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And last point (not really advice, but I wanted to say this). I suspect that these things stopped being sold in retail stores because the manufacturer wants you to buy their plastic floss toothpicks with preinstalled floss instead. They make a lot more money that way. I just checked on amazon and found that you can by 36 of those floss toothpicks for about $12. Assuming you floss once a day, thats almost $12 every month, way more than what you would otherwise spend on floss!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this is helpful!</li>
    <li> I have been using the Butler brand for year and agree with others that the Flossmate works really well. To solve the problem of no floss storage I tie one end of the floss onto the knob, then wrap a bunch of floss around the handle.  With each use I unwrap a little bit of floss and use that section - this is much easier than reloading every day.  Once a week or so I cut off the lengthening tail of used floss.</li>
    <li> Although I followed the directions like they say, the floss keeps coming loose (not undone... just loose) and makes quick flossing a bit of a pain in the butt.  Slack forms in the floss going from one side of the head to the other.  That&#x27;s all.</li>
    <li> I had surgery on my left hand and my entire hand and fingers were immobilized for six weeks.  This little gadget has allowed me to keep up my regular flossing routine one-handed!  Reviewers who said the floss can become loose should use a longer piece of floss, wrap it around the knob tightly six times, wrap around the head, then squeeze the head together hard while doing the final wrap of about six times tight,  the floss will stay taut and work perfectly!</li>
    <li> I bought 6 of these to last the rest of my life.  I can&#x27;t find them in any local stores, drugstores, or big box stores.  These are the handiest items.  I tried all the little plastic pick with floss thingies and don&#x27;t care for them.</li>
    <li> I have one of the original Flossmates made by Butler. It is at least 25 years old and works perfectly with either normal dental floss or the newer wider floss tapes. Unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t look too good these days (I tried washing it once in the dishwasher and it got badly stained) so I decided to order a new one. They&#x27;re very difficult to find in drug stores, so I turned to Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the newer one has a different button design that doesn&#x27;t hold the floss tightly in place. The difference is that the gap between the button and the handle is much greater on this Flossmate than on the original one I own. That means that there is no way to get the floss to stay on tightly. It just loosens immediately and the floss handle becomes useless. I returned it and tried another one, hoping it was just a manufacturing error, but discovered that the new one was just as bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t understand why Butler would change something that is so well designed, but they have. I can only hope that my old one doesn&#x27;t break. I&#x27;ll just have to put up with the discoloration. In any case, don&#x27;t purchase this floss handle as it&#x27;s useless.</li>
    <li> Good product and quick shipment.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find these in stores.  Keeps your fingers dry and reaches back between molars well.  Lost mine on a trip and finally found it available here.  The cheaper brands break, but this brand is durable and dishwasher washable.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice to know that the Butler flosser that I first bought and used decades ago is still being sold. My first one didn&#x27;t break: I lost it about a year ago.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality. Need to fiddle with getting the floss to not slip. Using a rubber O-ring!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s too strong for dental floss. Floss keeps breaking.I might have to send back. I am trying. it might take some time before I find out.</li>
    <li> I used one of these for years (I have a very small mouth and have a hard time flossing without this); my old one broke a while back and I couldn&#x27;t find one anywhere in-stores.  Another win for Amazon though!</li>
    <li> Much better than every other flossing tool available at the major pharmaceutical retailers who don&#x27;t stock this for some unknown reason!!! They have the real cheap ones that are very difficult to use and can&#x27;t apply any pressure whatsoever without collapsing.</li>
    <li> I used to have one like this about 10 years ago then they suddenly stopped carrying these refillable floss handles and just selling those super crappy and wasteful disposable ones. I can&#x27;t stand those. NEVERTHELESS, sticking my fingers in my mouth grosses me out and is hard to reach the very back teeth. I don&#x27;t really have to use THAT much floss considering I wrap a ton around my fingers anyways. But I wrap it about 3 times around the little knob thing then loop it over, pulling it very tight, then wrap it another  3 times around the knob. And then after the uppers I&#x27;ll move the floss over a bit and wrap wrap floss floss. Then I rinse off the handle with soap or mouthwash. I won&#x27;t floss without one from now on. Highly recommend</li>
