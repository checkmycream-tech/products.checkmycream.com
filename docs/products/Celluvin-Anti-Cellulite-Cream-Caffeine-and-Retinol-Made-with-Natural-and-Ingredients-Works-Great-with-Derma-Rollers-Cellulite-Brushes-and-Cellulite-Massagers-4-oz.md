      <li>I saw results right away!!  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It dries very quickly and does not leave a greasy feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It smells strong and it acts stronger.</li>

      <li>Not seen a huge change, will keep using and see what happens.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about, but I think having noticeable results is more important than any scent it might have.</li>
      <li>So far, so good.</li>
      <li>you can feel the cool sensation, I have a lot of cellulite in my thighs</li>
      <li>I have been looking for a good cellulite cream that actually works.</li>
      <li>, the smell is not bad</li>
      <li>Because of all the oils and ingredients the scent is pretty much unavoidable, but this one has the better scent.</li>

      <li>I am not affiliated in any way with any company or product for which I leave a review, nor am I compensated in any way for leaving a product review, and a positive review is never guaranteed, only an honest one.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to be able to see a noticeable difference, but I don&#x27;t expect miracles from these kind of products.</li>
      <li>The first thing I noticed was the smell.</li>
      <li>I will continue using this and am willing to update this review if I see visible results.</li>
      <li>and it is making my thighs and arms feel much firmer!</li>
      <li>I was lucky enough to receive a free trial of thos cream</li>
      <li>so it is not applied near my face, and the smell disappears quickly once it is applied.</li>
      <li>and I really like it.</li>
      <li>the size of the tube is very generous</li>
      <li>I REALLY wanted this to work.</li>

      <li>Too early to tell if it&#x27;s working to reduce cellulite</li>
      <li>It leaves my skin feeling soft.</li>
      <li>My first thought is that it&#x27;s much bigger than I expected.</li>
      <li>Thick cream goes on smooth.</li>
      <li>I like that this cream is pain free and doesn&#x27;t burn like some other cellulite creams I have tried in the past.</li>
      <li>This could help standardize the results people receive and prevent customers from using too much or too little of the product and not having the desired results.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> So far, so good. While nothing will ACTUALLY get rid of cellulite short of exercise and good genes (or jeans ;) ), this does reduce the appearance within the first 2-3 applications, and I assume will get better with time. I debated on this being a 4 or 5 star review because it has a smell I&#x27;m not crazy about, but I think having noticeable results is more important than any scent it might have.</li>
    <li> I bought this Cream because of the key ingredients: Caffeine and Retinol. In the past a cosmetologist suggested for me to try a cream with those 2 ingredients. Right now I use it on my noticeably double chin and neck, after my &amp;#34;chin exercises&amp;#34;. I noticed that my appearance improved on my pictures! And it is only after a week of using it! I am going to continue until all of the cream is gone. Then, if it works I am planning to buy some more and use it on my abdomen. Then thighs. One part of my body at the time and I can do it!</li>
    <li> I got this in return for a review and this product is a little sticky but I can tell you that I do see an instant difference...it doesn&#x27;t last all day but its good for when you&#x27;re out for a few hours!</li>
    <li> Used for two weeks, did not see ANY difference at all. I REALLY wanted this to work. They have a 120 day money back guarantee, so I am returning it. If I needed to use it longer to see result, I would not know as the product came with no information or instructions at all. Will not waste my money on magic creams and will Perdue non surgical procedure at plastic surgeon&#x27;s office</li>
    <li> This Celluvin cellulite cream comes in a decent size tube. I like that it was not only safety sealed with foil, but then with another plastic cover underneath that. This assures me that it was not tampered with and also preventing any kind of leakage in transit. I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to be able to see a noticeable difference, but I don&#x27;t expect miracles from these kind of products. I expect the results will be gradual and I will use it for a month before making up my mind. So far I can tell you it goes on smoothly and rubs in quickly. It leaves my skin feeling soft. I&#x27;m not a big fan of the scent, but that&#x27;s just me and it may be the combination of ingredients, so that&#x27;s fine. It&#x27;s only on my lower body anyway, so I don&#x27;t smell it once I&#x27;ve washed my hands. I will continue using this and am willing to update this review if I see visible results. I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I try very hard to write reviews that contain information that I would want to know when considering purchasing a product and that I would find helpful in making a purchasing decision. I believe reviews should be honest regardless of whether an item was received free, at a discount, or purchased at full price.

    <li> I got this product in an exchange for a review Before I got this product I read some reviews about it, and there nothing but good ones, well I wanted to try for my self and I tell you, I&#x27;m in love the minute I put it in you can feel it working you can feel the cool sensation, I have a lot of cellulite in my thighs and I&#x27;m noticing a difference, the smell is not bad it&#x27;s minty and the size of the tube is very generous thank you I will be buying more and recommend this to my friends</li>
    <li> I am loving this cream! I&#x27;ve been using it morning and night for a week now and it is making my thighs and arms feel much firmer! There isn&#x27;t a strong odor and the best part is that it doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling sticky or greasy! It does leave me skin feeling hydrated. I was lucky enough to receive a free trial of thos cream and I am honestly very impressed with the results!</li>
    <li> Thick cream goes on smooth. Unscented. I like that this cream is pain free and doesn&#x27;t burn like some other cellulite creams I have tried in the past. Too early to tell if it&#x27;s working to reduce cellulite but I will update post after I&#x27;ve had more time to use it!&lt;br /&gt;Full disclosure: I received a discount for reviewing this product.</li>
    <li> Not seen a huge change, will keep using and see what happens.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for just a few days and I&#x27;ve already seen results. I&#x27;ve applied it to my abdomen, hips, and thighs. My skin in that area felt firmer after a few hours and my skin has smoothed out substantially. My only complaint is that the directions appear to be rather vague. It doesn&#x27;t tell you an approximate amount to use per area, how often to use it, and whether it should be applied before a moisturizer. This could help standardize the results people receive and prevent customers from using too much or too little of the product and not having the desired results. Or maybe I&#x27;m just too nit-picky. Although I did receive this item for a review, if things keep improving I&#x27;ll purchase a few tubes for maintenance and to give to a few friends. I&#x27;ll update this review in a month or so if the results appear to be long lasting.</li>
    <li> I got this product from Amazon Reviewer and I really like it. The texture is nice and it seems to be helping</li>
    <li> I was able to get this product with an AMAZING discount through AMZ review trader and it works GREAT!!! buy it you will be happy you did!!</li>
    <li> I was offered this to review. My first thought is that it&#x27;s much bigger than I expected. I thought it was going to be this small fake looking tube. It smells really good. I&#x27;m hoping it works as well as it smells!</li>
    <li> I saw results right away!!  And after a few days my husband took notice! I will be reordering soon. Definitely would recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a week and I can see a slight difference. I&#x27;m going to continue using it and I&#x27;m sure I will see significant changes!</li>
    <li> Works well. Would highly recommend. Tightens and firms skin.</li>
    <li> The cream is has a kind of an unpleasant smell to it but I am currently still testing out the cream. I will write a much more detailed review once I have been using it constantly for about a month to document my results!</li>
    <li> I am not very active or fit, so  I&#x27;m pretty skeptical when it comes to magic solutions,  I&#x27;ve stayed away from them and just deal with my cellulite.&lt;br /&gt;I recently started experimenting with cellulite creams because I am tired of staying from shorts or opting for longer shorts or 3/4 length to try and hide it.&lt;br /&gt; I figured it can&#x27;t hurt to try. I have to admit this is one of the better creams I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;With the tube you can control the amount that comes out. The scent is much better than other creams I&#x27;ve tried. Because of all the oils and ingredients the scent is pretty much unavoidable, but this one has the better scent. It&#x27;s kind of minty.&lt;br /&gt;It dries very quickly and does not leave a greasy feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I received a discount for my unbiased</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a good cellulite cream that actually works. I will admit I was a little skeptical on the whole idea. When this Celluvin by Senvie arrived in the mail I was eager to try it out. The first thing I noticed was the smell. It has a very strong, chemical odor. It is not a some fruity lotion, this lotion means business! It smells strong and it acts stronger. Luckily it is only for my thighs so it is not applied near my face, and the smell disappears quickly once it is applied. Oh, and so does my cellulite! I don&#x27;t know what they used to create such a magic lotion, but I like it! I will post a picture of my leg before I used Culluvin, and another picture taken just ONE HOUR later. I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review, but I will be buying it for years to come. See for yourself, this product is fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;Here are my before and after pictures, as well as a picture of the Celluvin next to a Dr. Pepper for comparison.</li>
    <li> I saw this on amazon trader aND have wanted to try the only down side to this product is the sent is little weird. A little minty so I use super thin layers. Nice rubs on nicely not greasy. Leave little tingle like the product alot</li>
