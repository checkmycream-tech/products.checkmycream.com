      <li>The scent was nice and not too overbearing.  </li>

      <li>However, his scalp continues to be in perfect shape and his hair always looks very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>H&amp;S is the best shampoo for my hair, so far.</li>
      <li>So I took to the Internet for an answer, and there it was -- apparently this product now includes a &amp;#34;water-activated fragrance boost&amp;#34; which works best in the shower.  </li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s a very light pink/mauve sort of smell that would be feminine but the berries predominate</li>
      <li>I always use it, and I love this one too.</li>
      <li>That is a good thing because I have a rare autoimmune skin disease that makes my scalp itch.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re a Head and Shoulders fan, you&#x27;ll love this.  </li>
      <li>Not quite sure how to describe the scent.  </li>
      <li>Head and Shoulders is one of the more trusted brands in the shampoo industry.  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t used it in many years.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great to find a product that does so much.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a flip top lid that takes a bit of effort.  </li>
      <li>and Shoulders 2 in 1 Extra Volume is another excellent product.  </li>
      <li>He also likes that it doesn&#x27;t have an overwhelming scent.</li>
      <li>It controls his hair well and gives his hair more volume.  </li>
      <li>It was perhaps more volumizing, but at the expense of being drying.</li>
      <li>He feels like he has nicer, more conditioned hair.  </li>
      <li>The icing on an already delicious cake was the revelation that Head and Shoulders also has formulas for different hair types including mine,</li>
      <li>I normally love Head and Shoulders for my dandruff prone hair.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, though, my hair came out nice and clean and did have volume, as the product described.</li>
      <li>Controls dandruff and has a super nice smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s been many, many years since using the familiar Head and Shoulders brand of shampoo.</li>
      <li>AND SHOULDERS has been around for a long time and with the good and efficient job it does, while at the same time, resulting in beautiful hair, I believe it will be around for many, many more years.  </li>
      <li>It smelled fresh and clean, not too strong but just nice.</li>
      <li>His hair looked fantastic.  </li>
      <li>Hair was clean and did have volume, but didn&#x27;t seem to be easy to comb.  </li>
      <li>and I enjoy the scent.  </li>
      <li>It does not dry out my hair, smells pleasant and is easy to apply and wash off.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t put any kind of product in my hair, and thus I rely upon a strong shampoo/conditioner to keep my hair clean, dandruff-free, soft, and manageable.  </li>
      <li>Overall, I found that this product is pretty good!  </li>
      <li>It leaves my scalp feeling clean and ..</li>
      <li>Either way, this is a fine 2-in-1and worth your time.</li>
      <li>Extra Volume 2-in 1 Dandruff Shampoo + Conditioner does a good job on increasing volume.</li>
      <li>Maybe light and fresh and a bit floral.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t really say that this gives it more volume but will update the review if it does after continued use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have long, fine, blonde hair that gets greasy at the roots after 3 days; if that helps you know it will work well for you too :D</li>
      <li>far as the volume claim, it didn&#x27;t flatten my fine hair the way most 2-in-1 combination shampoo/conditioner products do.</li>
      <li>This Head &amp; Shoulders Extra Volume Conditioner and Dandruff Shampoo does a great job in both respects: making my hair thicker while still being very manageable and in controlling dandruff after shampooing.</li>
      <li>The cap is pretty secure.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The aroma is crisp, clean, and pleasing.  </li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t notice any scent, which is fine by me.</li>
      <li>My modified Bob haircut gives my hair great shape and volume and this Head and Shoulders and the plain 2 in 1</li>
      <li>The conditioner is lacking a bit for the ends of our very long hair, but it should be FINE for most people with all but the driest and longest of hair</li>
      <li>I feel like I am getting a good clean with it, there is a definite effect from the extra volume.</li>
      <li>I love its masculine scent, it lathers very well</li>
      <li>It felt silky smooth, and having the &amp;#34;all in one&amp;#34; product really saves time when I&#x27;m getting ready to go to work in the morning.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Lastly, some combination shampoo and condition products tend to leave one&#x27;s hair still kind of dry and in need of conditioner.</li>
      <li>The only thing preventing me from giving this particular variety a five-star rating is the fragrance, which is a bit &amp;#34;sweeter&amp;#34; than the others I&#x27;ve tried, which generally have a clean, pleasant, and neutral fragrance.</li>
      <li>Also, it is very reasonably priced!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>In the summer I find that it&#x27;s too hot to use a blow dryer</li>
      <li>pretty attractive.&lt;br</li>
      <li>His thinning hair actually looks thicker with more curl in it.  </li>
      <li>I was absolutely thrilled when I discovered that one of my old, faithful friends, Head and Shoulders Dandruff Shampoo, now had a conditioner mixed in with it.  </li>
      <li>I sometimes conduct wine tastings and it is important to be fragrance free so as not to interfere with the enjoyment of the wine, The fragrance is not bad, just very potent on wet and damp hair and still present on dry hair.</li>
      <li>/&gt;There are so many different varieties available and this is the first time he has tried the shampoo, plus conditioner, with extra volume.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a fairly potent fragrance that fades to &#x27;a bit more than subtle, definitely present if you get close&#x27; when dry.&lt;br /&gt;The suds are loose and easy on very wet hair, and it&#x27;s pleasant to use as it soaps up and rinses easily.  </li>
      <li>If you have long hair that tangles a lot, you better comb out the knots and tangles before using this.  </li>
      <li>The funny thing is that I don&#x27;t have much of a dandruff problem.  </li>
      <li>product boasts new fresh scent technology that is supposed to give an improved in-shower experience.</li>
      <li>The lid is easy to open and snaps shut</li>
      <li>- the shampoo certainly does what it should.</li>
      <li>Eh, it smells a lot like regular old Head &amp; Shoulders,  maybe a little more potent and sweet in the shower but</li>
      <li>I am pleased to say that it was very well packaged by Amazon, arriving sealed in a plastic bag without a single drop leaking out.  </li>
      <li>This two-in-one, like so many, leaves your hair Very dry.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It may make your hair look fuller, but you gain that dirty feeling like there&#x27;s a ton of hair product like hair spray in your hair.  Even after brushing, the hair still fees like it&#x27;s tangled and matted.</li>
    <li> H&amp;S is the best shampoo for my hair, so far. I always use it, and I love this one too. Recommend!</li>
    <li> A decent shampoo from Head &amp; Shoulders. I&#x27;ve finally gone from extremely long hair which I wouldn&#x27;t trust 2-in-1 shampoos to take care of to a much more manageable hair length and can take advantage of the dual care product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product boasts new fresh scent technology that is supposed to give an improved in-shower experience. Eh, it smells a lot like regular old Head &amp; Shoulders,  maybe a little more potent and sweet in the shower but nothing that would make you stand up and shout &amp;#34;Wow!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been using a competitor&#x27;s anti dandruff product for a while and it was losing its effectiveness. After using this Head &amp; Shoulders product for a week now the returning flakes are just about completely gone and the scalp itchiness has drastically decreased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although my hair&#x27;s fairly short right now I can see a definite volume increase in the hair I have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely get this product again. It works well. Head &amp; Shoulders has always been a good, go to product for dandruff and itch control.</li>
    <li> I have used Head and Shoulders regularly since high school, so this brand has been a part of my everyday life for more than two decades.  These days I typically buy the 2-in-1 shampoo and conditioner, because I like the way my hair feels after my morning shower.  I don&#x27;t put any kind of product in my hair, and thus I rely upon a strong shampoo/conditioner to keep my hair clean, dandruff-free, soft, and manageable.  I have experimented with other shampoos, but I always come back to Head and Shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More than anything, I was concerned about a shampoo bottle arriving at my Texas home in August heat. I am pleased to say that it was very well packaged by Amazon, arriving sealed in a plastic bag without a single drop leaking out.  The bottle was hot, as one would expect, but I put it in my cabinet and it felt perfectly normal by the next morning when I used it for the first time.  This Extra Volume 2-in-1 is, as always, a terrific product and easily and highly recommended to anyone, regardless of whether you deal with dandruff or not.  My dandruff issues really stopped in college (perhaps because of Head and Shoulders), and yet I continue to use it because it&#x27;s just a solid product, all the way around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only difference between this bottle from Amazon and another one that I purchased a few weeks ago is a notation near the cap advertising &amp;#34;new Fresh Scent Technology.&amp;#34;  I had no idea what this meant, nor did the bottle offer any elaboration.  So I took to the Internet for an answer, and there it was -- apparently this product now includes a &amp;#34;water-activated fragrance boost&amp;#34; which works best in the shower.  While that sounds cool, I can&#x27;t say that it really changed or even improved my daily routine at all.  I suppose, upon reflection, there is a slightly stronger smell there, not unpleasant at all, but it did not occur to me until I looked up the meaning of &amp;#34;Fresh Scent Technology&amp;#34; online.  Either way, this is a fine 2-in-1and worth your time.</li>
    <li> Pew! This stuff stinks and it lingers in the hair. I normally love Head and Shoulders for my dandruff prone hair. I was using the 2-in-1 Dry Scalp Care with Almond Oil (very subtle clean scent that doesn&#x27;t linger) from them prior to trying this and hoped the volume boost would be a nice perk. Wrong! The smell is extremely unpleasant, kind of like when I used to perm my hair way back when. And the smell clings to the hair for a long time. I was still getting whiffs the next day. Really unpleasant. It was perhaps more volumizing, but at the expense of being drying. It still took care of my dandruff, but I&#x27;m definitely going back to the Dry Scalp Care formula because the smell is terrible..</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband.  He usually uses the original Head &amp; Shoulders and I didn&#x27;t know how he&#x27;d like the combination.  He reports that he really likes it.  It controls his hair well and gives his hair more volume.  He has straight, fine, not super thin hair and it works well for him.</li>
    <li> Head and Shoulders Extra Volume 2-in 1 Dandruff Shampoo + Conditioner does a good job on increasing volume. I compared it to another volumizing shampoo that I use. My hair is shiny and silky. The only bad thing is that it burned my eyes. Probably this shampoo is too acidic for my eyes. That was my only disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My scalp does not itch at all. That is a good thing because I have a rare autoimmune skin disease that makes my scalp itch. I don&#x27;t have any dandruff but I think I will close my eyes tight next time and use it for treating my itchy scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price can&#x27;t be beat. So it is a great buy, just be sure to close your eyes when you use it. If you don&#x27;t have dandruff but have crazy itchy scapl like I do, use this shampoo!</li>
    <li> Head and Shoulders has long had a corner on the dandruff shampoo market and this formula is no exception! It&#x27;s great! The smell is nicer than many of the other products and it is dependability you can count on.  The 2-in-1 formula leaves your hair feeling clean and soft without added weight from a second product. If you&#x27;re a Head and Shoulders fan, you&#x27;ll love this.  If you&#x27;re not, you soon will be. This is a great product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not usually into  2 in 1 products like this.  However, I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot.  Head and Shoulders is one of the more trusted brands in the shampoo industry.  Overall, I found that this product is pretty good!  This product didn&#x27;t condition as well as I thought it would for wavy hair.  Hair was clean and did have volume, but didn&#x27;t seem to be easy to comb.  The scent was nice and not too overbearing.  I am weary of this one bottle lasting as long as I&#x27;d like, due to the fact that to condition my hair type properly, I will most likely have to use this twice per wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, though, my hair came out nice and clean and did have volume, as the product described.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not always a fan of shampoo and conditioner combos, because they tend to weigh down my hair.  Head and Shoulders Extra Volume has not, however; my hair is just as fluffy as ever.  It&#x27;s also nicely shiny and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo has the usual Head and Shoulders smell.  (That is, not much smell at all.)  I wish it had a bit more smell, but I&#x27;ll certainly take very light smell over a bad or overpowering smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My scalp is happy and my hair looks nice - the shampoo certainly does what it should.</li>
    <li> My husband has tried a few of these new Head and Shoulders Fresh scent products.  He loves the fragrance of all of them but the 2 in 2 shampoo conditions are the ones he likes the best.  This product actually delivers on the extra volume promise in the title.  His thinning hair actually looks thicker with more curl in it.  As with all other Head and Shoulders products, it keeps his dandruff under control.</li>
    <li> This two-in-one, like so many, leaves your hair Very dry. I had to condition afterwards because I couldn&#x27;t brush it out in the shower like I normally do without breaking and tearing at it; it felt the way hair does after using a harsh shampoo. As for the scent, if you like the candy-like smell of artificial aroma, this is the product for you (alongside a conditioner, of course), but that is among my least favorites, so I won&#x27;t be using this again.</li>
    <li> I have matured over the years and so has Head and Shoulders.  I haven&#x27;t used it in many years.  When I was young, the beauticians who cut my hair warned me that Head and Shoulders Dandruff Shampoo had harsh \\&quot;detergents\\&quot; that would cause my hair to fall out.  Well, it was Male Pattern Baldness (MPB) that did that to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  For the past few years, hair care companies have become more proactive and have been mixing their shampoos and conditioners together and putting them into one bottle.  This is extremely convenient, especially for those who travel extensively or who, like me, need to use a conditioner every day.  Also, not only do I have MPB, but I also have extremely thin, fine hair.  Double whammy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I was absolutely thrilled when I discovered that one of my old, faithful friends, Head and Shoulders Dandruff Shampoo, now had a conditioner mixed in with it.  The icing on an already delicious cake was the revelation that Head and Shoulders also has formulas for different hair types including mine, thinning hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Head and Shoulders Extra Volume 2-In-1 Dandruff Shampoo + Conditioner lives up to its name.  I love its masculine scent, it lathers very well, it rinses easily and it doesn&#x27;t leave an oily, slick or greasy residue in my hair.  Neither have I experienced any allergic reactions.  Most importantly, at least to me, is that it does give my hair the appearance of being thicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I highly recommend the Head and Shoulders Extra Volume 2-In-1 Dandruff Shampoo + Conditioner for men, like me, who suffer the double curse of dandruff and MPB.  It is affordable, masculine shampoo and conditioner that actually works.  Because Head and Shoulders has been around longer than I have, I have faith that it is made of the highest quality ingredients and won&#x27;t damage my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joseph B.

    <li> Excellent shampoo. Doesn&#x27;t leave much smell behind but cleans very well and leaves hair with a nice volume boost, even the day after. I really liked this stuff!</li>
    <li> HEAD AND SHOULDERS EXTRA VOLUME 2-in-1 DANDRUFF SHAMPOO &amp; CONDITIONER&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband has been using HEAD AND SHOULDERS shampoo forever.  He prefers to use it over other shampoos to keep dandruff and scalp issues away.  He has always been pleased and happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are so many different varieties available and this is the first time he has tried the shampoo, plus conditioner, with extra volume.  His hair is very short so regarding volume -- ?  We will never know!  However, his scalp continues to be in perfect shape and his hair always looks very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The aroma is crisp, clean, and pleasing.  Not at all medicinal smelling.  The lid is easy to open and snaps shut well just in case you would drop in the shower thus causing no spillage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I color my hair so am a little hesitant to use this product only due to that fact.  However, I do believe that no harm would come of my using it as it seems gentle enough while fighting dandruff and other irritations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HEAD AND SHOULDERS has been around for a long time and with the good and efficient job it does, while at the same time, resulting in beautiful hair, I believe it will be around for many, many more years.  Also, it is very reasonably priced!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is great. It does not dry out my hair, smells pleasant and is easy to apply and wash off.  My hair does not have the typical limp or brittle \\&quot;dandruff shampoo\\&quot; look after using it. If you have mild dandruff issues, but want full bodied hair and desire a shampoo that doesn&#x27;t smell awful, give Head and Shoulders Extra Volume a try.</li>
    <li> You know how they say &amp;#34;Wash, Rinse, Repeat&amp;#34;? I prefer the Shampoo + Conditioner for the repeat part. And since Head &amp; Shoulders is my preferred shampoo, I thought I would give this one a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like it. I feel like I am getting a good clean with it, there is a definite effect from the extra volume. My hair tends to go flat and oily real fast, but it has not since I started using this shampoo. And we are currently in the hottest part of the year. I really don&#x27;t notice any scent, which is fine by me. I really don&#x27;t want to smell my hair.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this shampoo and conditioner combo! He tends to have dandruff and a dry scalp. He loves that it hasn&#x27;t continued to dry out his scalp. He also likes that it doesn&#x27;t have an overwhelming scent. This will be a staple in our household from now on.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Head and Shoulders shampoos for years.  The funny thing is that I don&#x27;t have much of a dandruff problem.  But I like the scent, the way it makes my hair feel and usually the price is pretty attractive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last Head and Shoulders product I purchased was Green Apple, which is one of my favorites.  Controls dandruff and has a super nice smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Head and Shoulders 2 in 1 Extra Volume is another excellent product.  It does leave my hair feeling very nice and I enjoy the scent.  Not quite sure how to describe the scent.  Maybe light and fresh and a bit floral.  But it&#x27;s fine for guys to use, although I prefer the smell of the Green Apple version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As mentioned in the caption, it&#x27;s great shampoo whether or not you have dandruff.  5 stars.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this product and he says that it seems to work great.  He feels like he has nicer, more conditioned hair.  Dandruff is still controlled.</li>
    <li> This worked great on my scalp and smelled wonderful like all PG shampoos tend to do. I has to use additional conditioner since my hair felt a little dry and tangly afterwards, but the matching conditioner worked well to quench my hair and leave it smooth without buildup. I have long, fine, blonde hair that gets greasy at the roots after 3 days; if that helps you know it will work well for you too :D</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been many, many years since using the familiar Head and Shoulders brand of shampoo. Never liked the scent, and found the shampoo itself it to be rather ordinary...not exceptionally good, not exceptionally bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This version is enough to bring me back to the fold!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a creamy white (I seem to remember the old one being blue?) with a thick lotion consistency. The scent is a gender neutral &#x27;fresh&#x27;, and thankfully not that typical &#x27;sport fresh&#x27;, either.&lt;br /&gt;One thing I find quite annoying, is the ingredient &#x27;fragrance&#x27;. Why not disclose what chemical is being used as fragrance?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the volume claim, it didn&#x27;t flatten my fine hair the way most 2-in-1 combination shampoo/conditioner products do. But I didn&#x27;t get 1980s big hair either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually, that&#x27;s probably a good thing.</li>
    <li> Shampoo and cosmetic manufacturers routinely make claims that make me roll my eyes, and that was my initial reaction to the idea that a shampoo can make hair look noticeably fuller. So I tried out this iteration of Head &amp; Shoulders expecting nothing on that front, and not planning to judge the product harshly as a result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But truth be told--it actually delivered on the fullness promise. I have curly hair that has gotten thinner in front over the years, and this product actually does make my hair look a little fuller in the thinner area. This was definitely a welcome and pleasant surprise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beyond that--I&#x27;ve used Head and Shoulders for many years as my regular shampoo, and it works as promised to prevent dandruff when used regularly. The only thing preventing me from giving this particular variety a five-star rating is the fragrance, which is a bit &amp;#34;sweeter&amp;#34; than the others I&#x27;ve tried, which generally have a clean, pleasant, and neutral fragrance.</li>
    <li> You can count on Head and Shoulders to deliver a quality oitem and they have done so again.  That is If this is a  new item, and I think it is.  I like the fact that this is shampoo and conditioner in one product.  This makes life so much easier.  Smells really good and leaves my hair smelling so good.  In the olden days this brand of shampoo smelled like medicine.</li>
    <li> For Heras a Was looping for a Shampoo the y giveme. Real volumen, I round I&#x27;m so happy wthit tris product and  I can fin no place ,thanks a the compañía Still have it,  jeep up Guy&#x27;s , great Job. A happy custumer</li>
    <li> For a dandruff shampoo, this is great.  It smells a bit - to me- like plumeria and berries, it&#x27;s a very light pink/mauve sort of smell that would be feminine but the berries predominate so the overall effect is just &#x27;fresh&#x27; and fruity.  It&#x27;s a fairly potent fragrance that fades to &#x27;a bit more than subtle, definitely present if you get close&#x27; when dry.&lt;br /&gt;The suds are loose and easy on very wet hair, and it&#x27;s pleasant to use as it soaps up and rinses easily.  The cap is pretty secure.  It&#x27;s a flip top lid that takes a bit of effort.  It might frustrate a toddler long enough to catch him before he squirts it all out.  If closed it SHOULD keep it safe from leaking all in the floor when the cat knocks it off the side of the tub.  It is easy to open and close with tightly shut eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works as I&#x27;d expect from Head and Shoulders to stop itching and address dandruff.  It leaves my scalp feeling clean and ..that&#x27;s it.  No itch.  No dryness.  Just comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner in this 2 and 1 formula make it great to take to the gym.  The conditioner is lacking a bit for the ends of our very long hair, but it should be FINE for most people with all but the driest and longest of hair so I&#x27;m not going to take off anything for that- that&#x27;s typical and easily solved with a bit of leave in conditioner.  It does not weigh hair down.</li>
    <li> I have been using Head and Shoulders Shampoo since the 1960&#x27;s when the original shampoo was a blue green color. I wash my hair at least every other day and sometimes everyday using assorted shampoos and in the warmer weather I might choose Head and Shoulders only a couple times a month but in the winter when dandruff is more likely I might use it daily. My current Head and Shoulders is a 2in1 version with conditioner and I really like it  This product touts the added benefit of Extra Volume and I don&#x27;t know if it really delivered. My modified Bob haircut gives my hair great shape and volume and this Head and Shoulders and the plain 2 in 1 both keep my hair looking good. I can&#x27;t really say that this gives it more volume but will update the review if it does after continued use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like about this Head and Shoulders is the extra dose of fragrance. I sometimes conduct wine tastings and it is important to be fragrance free so as not to interfere with the enjoyment of the wine, The fragrance is not bad, just very potent on wet and damp hair and still present on dry hair.</li>
    <li> I’ve never been a fan of shampoo/conditioner combos, but I guess I was wrong.  Really gets me out of the shower fast when I’m in a hurry.  This product was excellent for flakey scalps.  It didn’t make my hair oily and it gave it real bounce. I have only a small caveat.  If you have long hair that tangles a lot, you better comb out the knots and tangles before using this.  It doesn’t de-tangle your hair as well as separate conditioners do.  On the other hand, my hair usually gets so oily from conditioners that it has to be washed every other day or more often.  Not so with this product.  I can go an extra day.  As far as volume, it gives my hair as much or more volume than all the high-end conditioners I usually use.  Great stuff.</li>
    <li> I have color treated hair.  I felt this shampoo was a little to harsh for me.  My hair had a ton of volume, but it was kind of dry and a little frizzy.  I would give this three stars for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My son&#x27;s hair is natural.  He used this with great results.  His hair looked fantastic.  It was soft and had a lot of volume.  It&#x27;s 5 stars for him.</li>
    <li> This Head &amp; Shoulders Extra Volume Conditioner and Dandruff Shampoo does a great job in both respects: making my hair thicker while still being very manageable and in controlling dandruff after shampooing. I cannot address &#x27;extra&#x27; volume, but all of my hair is noticeably thicker in volume on the top, sides, and back to some extent as compared to the way it was before. In addition, it has a nice-smelling fragrance that apparently does not radiate beyond the personal space of the user and only lasts a few hours. Even though I stopped using this shampoo after a couple of weeks of testing this product in order to move on to another shampoo, the increased volume is still there, proving it has lasting effects for a period of days. Highly Recommended. Five MANAGEABLE Stars! (Head &amp; Shoulders Extra Volume Conditioner and Dandruff Shampoo in a 14.2 fluid ounce plastic squeeze bottle.)</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of dandruff, but my hair tends to lack volume.  After washing, it&#x27;s distressingly flat.  I usually require mousse or some other hair gel to make it puff up more.  After using this Head and Shoulders combo shampoo and conditioner, I have to say that my hair has a nice body and lift to it.  In the summer I find that it&#x27;s too hot to use a blow dryer and so I left my hair dry naturally. Even so, the results were great.  My hair had a really attractive bounce and thickness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like the fact that the smell is subtle and pleasant, not overly chemical like other Head and Shoulders products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, some combination shampoo and condition products tend to leave one&#x27;s hair still kind of dry and in need of conditioner. I&#x27;m happy to say this product works fine for my hair.  It felt silky smooth, and having the &amp;#34;all in one&amp;#34; product really saves time when I&#x27;m getting ready to go to work in the morning.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great to find a product that does so much. It&#x27;s a two in one shampoo and conditioner so for those of you in the rush, you don&#x27;t have to worry about putting in an extra conditioner into your hair. It reduces dandruff. I found that it worked well in this. To top it off, it also adds volume to your hair, which is a great added bonus. I thought it did a good job with this as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was happy with the smell of the product. It smelled fresh and clean, not too strong but just nice. I felt like it did everything it said it would. People spend a fortune on these expensive products, but this works great instead. I would recommend it.</li>
