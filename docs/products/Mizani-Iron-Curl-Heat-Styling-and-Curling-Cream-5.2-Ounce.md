    <li> Great product, fast shipping!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s the best I have used other products and the Mizani is the best so far</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It&#x27;s great for my hair.</li>
    <li> Decent product, but I have sensitive skin and noticed my ears and crown were itching.  But it is good support for curling hair with heat.  Brush in well before applying heat tool.</li>
    <li> First time I used this I applied more than needed and it weighed my hair down. The amount depends on thickness of hair. It gave my hair a great shine and helped create that slip in the flat iron. Hair looked so good and really straight. I have 4c relaxed hair and used heat at 300 degrees. Will try going cooler next time. I&#x27;m new to flat ironing, but was happy this product allowed me to get a straight style without major heat.</li>
    <li> Not the creme I was looking for.  Made my hair dry out and had to wash it out the same day.</li>
    <li> Works well but its been so hot my curls don&#x27;t stay!</li>
    <li> Not a fan of the smell. Gave it to my mom and she loves it.</li>
    <li> Used this after i used Mizani foam wrap. Defined my curls made my hair soft &amp; shiny. The curls lasted all day. Great for curling pixie cuts like mine.</li>
    <li> Great hair product!  Treated my hair as expected! Will recommend to anyone. A little will go a long way. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I love this, I have used it twice already and it has a nice smell. I plan to buy more when I run out !</li>
    <li> great for curly hair. helps to keep from frying your hair when you blow dry.&lt;br /&gt;only downside it doesnt smell good. dont stink either.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair feel silky.  Good for using with a hot curling iron.</li>
    <li> I have very coarse hair and this did nothing for my heat style.  I do not recommend it for coarse hair.  I will not order this again.</li>
    <li> This made my hair crunchy and dry as well.  I still use other Mizani products.  The shampoo and conditioner softens my hair.</li>
    <li> I am an African American and transitioning back to my natural hair. This product provides great protection for my hair when I flat iron it and helps it to last longer. Typically, I wash my hair and let it air dry. Then, apply this product after my hair is completely dry when I am flat ironing it.</li>
    <li> One of my all time favorite products. The best you&#x27;ll ever find out there for heat and curling iron use.</li>
    <li> the BEST hair creme I&#x27;ve ever found. I use it to straighten my hair and not only does it protect it, my hair comes out looking silky and shiny. I have naturally curly but I&#x27;m mixed Italian/Mexican with thick hair. Not sure how to classify my hair type. A little goes a LONG way, I only put some on the ends of my hair, brush it through and then straighten it, never put it near my roots because it&#x27;ll look greasy. So this small tub will last quite a long time.</li>
    <li> The item received looked horrible, it was cracked and had taping all around it, very unprofessional and shady. I threw it out.</li>
    <li> I &amp;#34;accidentally&amp;#34; purchased this product thinking it was one I had previously used and liked.  I like this better for curling and flat ironing.  It&#x27;s creamy and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m natural &amp; this helps to keep my hair straight. I love it! I will definitely be a repeat customer.</li>
    <li> I have a relaxer and this does nothing for my hair. A waste of money.</li>
    <li> my curls usually fall by mid day. this stuff will help them hold all day long and sometimes they will even last a few days. it does have a slight smell but my good smelling hairspray covers that up. also is no match for humidity, but in texas nothing really is. great product i&#x27;ve shared with many of my friends.</li>
