<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor now for 6 months and never been thrilled with it.  I shave my head daily and found the manual stating this is for face only.  It leaks razor dust all over the place.  It&#x27;s definitely not as comfortable as previous Norelco razors I&#x27;ve had.  I didn&#x27;t notice any gain from the Teflon coatings.  One of the combs is already missing a rib.  The battery life, quick recharge and LCD are the only great parts of this razor.  The shaver heads removal is easy.  Getting them back on is tougher once your hands get wet.  I now have to clean the razor heads with the brush after each shave otherwise I can&#x27;t get a close shave.  This shaver definitely left me less than satisfied.  I will most likely go back to Norelco next time around.    *** June 8, 2011 UPDATE  - I recently ordered the redesigned razor head where the shavers are removed from the inside instead of from the outside.  This greatly reduces the razor dust and eliminates problems with the shavers popping off.  With the new razor head (Remington Sprcdn Universal Rotary Replacement Shaver Head) I would now recommend this product.  ***You may need to inquire about which shaver head will come with your unit.</li>
    <li> I have just (Nov, 2010) received the newest improved version of the R7130, which now has Remington&#x27;s redesign of the heads. This solves all the problems of the old model, which previous reviews here are based on. It is now simply a better product.     The previous R7130&#x27;s heads were removable from the front with a tricky twist that required to be reinstalled just right, or the blades could fall out. The redesign now fixes this by making the cutters removable from the back, only after you open up the shaver. Remington also told me that the new heads now also give a better/closer shave than before, and that all R7130 stock going forward will be equipped with them.     I can wholeheartedly recommend it now.   And Remington customer service is indeed very good, as has been written around the web.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my boyfriend and I get to enjoy its benefits! This is the smoothest I have ever felt his face! and HE agrees! He loves it! I love it too! ;)</li>
    <li> A much better shave than my old electric shaver.  I can actually get a smooth close shave without bleeding!  And it has about as many features as one can possibly get in an electric shaver but for a lot less money than comparable models by other brands.</li>
    <li> I have an older rechargeable Remington shaver which has given great shaves for several years but the trimmer blade quit functioning. Thus I decided to upgrade to this shaver. Perhaps I just got a bad one but it will not give a close shave. It leaves very visible stubble no matter how hard I press or how many times I pass over my face. So now I&#x27;m back to using my old shaver and can only use this one for the trimmer. Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver because it had a time remaining display, but as soon as I took it out of the box, it fell apart in my hands.  I read several reviews before buying this shaver that the \\&quot;heads pop off\\&quot; and sure enough, they do.  There isn&#x27;t a whole lot holding them in, and this appears to be a case of just poor design.  After spending 10 minutes attempting to put my brand new razor back together, I asked myself why am I doing this, and I bought a Norelco.  This is their top-of-the0line model, I hate to see their cheaper ones.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor for 4 months. The longer I have it the more the heads fall out. They fall out everytime I shave. What a major inconvenience. Since I had it for 4 months they won&#x27;t take it back so now I have an $80 paper weight. Find a better design...</li>
    <li> I have been using this Remington shaver for ten months as a replacement for a Norelco rotary razor. I should have returned it within the 30-day trial period, but stubbornly held on to it in hopes my face would adjust to the new razor and I would get a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Problems:&lt;br /&gt;1) The rotary heads unlock and pop off the razor while shaving.&lt;br /&gt;2) The edge trimmer dulled quickly and now no longer cuts.&lt;br /&gt;3) It has never given me a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot recommend this shaver to anyone.</li>
    <li> I Bought this shaver a few months ago and I am constantly having to put the heads back on when I shave. It is shocking,the first time it happened I did not notice and I lost one of the cutters, It cost me 26 euro to replace  the heads. I thought the new foils and heads would fix the problen.It stil the same,the heads keep falling off. Another problem is trying to fit the shaver cover on, its next to impossible. This piece of crap is heading  for the bin. No more Remington products for me.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used an electric rotary razor in a long time, and after trying this one I remembered why.  I&#x27;m not sure what it is, but after running this thing all over even the flattest parts of my face, I still had stubble.  I was convinced I was doing something wrong or that I forgot to take of a cover or something.  After reading the manual and trying again the results were no different.  I opened it to clean and there was some hair in there so it was clearly cutting, but it wasn&#x27;t anywhere near close enough.  I had recently tried out the WAHL all in one trimmer and it has a foil shaver attachment and in my opinion this does a far better job.  After giving up on the Remington, I then switched to the WAHL and was greeted by the buzzing sound of actual cutting.  I quick feel confirmed that the WAHL was able to smooth down the stubs, so what&#x27;s the Remington&#x27;s problem?  I guess rotary shavers just don&#x27;t work for me.  I wasted almost 10 minutes and in the end still had to shave with something else.    If you already use a rotary shaver and they work well for you, then I assume this would be a good model.  It&#x27;s solidly build and well-made.  The trimmer works okay, but again I think the WAHL even works better for side burns.  The floating heads seem to confirm to the skin well and it&#x27;s easy to clean.  I&#x27;m just a bit perplexed how it could perform so poorly for me with all the positive reviews it&#x27;s gotten.    Update:  I gave this shaver another chance after 3 days of growth.  Surprisingly it did a better job this time around.  Perhaps the trick (at least for me) was to let my stubble get a little longer.  This did result in some \\&quot;tugging\\&quot; on the neck hairs but it was minor.  Still not convinced I&#x27;m going to use it full time but the second go around was more impressive so I&#x27;d bump it to 3 stars if I could.</li>
    <li> The Remington R-7130 is an electric shaver that does the main thing it&#x27;s designed to do well.  It shaves close, as close or closer, than my previous Norelco shaver.  Additionally it leaves very little redness and irritation afterwards, possibly because of the Teflon coating.  The shaver head pivots and flexes nicely, and works well on the neck and under the nose.  It is also comfortable to hold.  Lastly, the shaver has a pop-up trimmer on the back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Remington has a digital display that counts down the minutes remaining of the battery&#x27;s charge, a nice touch.  It can run corded or cordless, and the charger is compact.  A full charge lasts 60 minutes and takes 90 minutes to charge, with a 5 minute quick charge available if needed.  The shaver is also water resistant and can be rinsed out under the sink after every use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, it shaves well, which is why it got 4 stars, but compared to the Norelco the details suffer.  It&#x27;s quite a bit bigger than the Norelco, which makes it harder to pack for traveling (see pic above).  It&#x27;s also noisy compared to the Norelco, noting dramatic, just more noticeable.  The materials are put together well, but seem to be of low quality, with flimsy feeling plastics.  The last nuisance is that the top is not spring loaded, so it does not stay open unless you lay it on its side.  The Norelco has a spring-loaded top, and comes with a base, so you can leave the top open and the shaver upright to dry out after it&#x27;s been rinsed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all... Gives a fast, close, and comfortable shave, just needs some attention to detail.</li>
    <li> My Norelco was getting a bit worn and I wanted a new rotary shaver. I bought a Remington with a similar action. First impression was that it gave me a very good shave. After a few uses, like any shaver, it needed a clean out. Problems only come to light after a little use, of course.    Taking it apart was just a bit fiddly. But putting the thing together again is a whole different story. It has been designed so it all comes to bits, with no simple reassembly protocol. It takes about 10 minutes of constant trying before finally managing it and needing to hold it up-side-down! I thought at first that it was perhaps me. But each time I experienced the same difficulties. This is quite the opposite to the simple reassembly of a Norelco for instance.    I imagine the chief executive tried out the razor, thought \\&quot;hey, this is a good shave\\&quot; and handed the prototype back and said \\&quot;go make them\\&quot;. Of course, in his position, he didn&#x27;t need to try and clean the thing.    What I do now is still struggle on with my old Norelco for the basic shave, because it is simple to clean out. Then occasionally I finish up with the Remington for a final clean shave. I will just have to bin it when it gets full of shavings rather than jump thru hoops trying to reassemble again. So before you buy one, take the shaving heads to pieces and try and put it all back together again. I&#x27;ll wager 9 out of 10 of you will walk away without buying.</li>
    <li> I had  a older remington, it was time for   new, I bought this Rotary Remington Pivot &amp; Flex.  It cuts clean, good slave, just alittle to   noisy, than the older one.    Joe     San Jose.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver about a year ago and it was a disaster from the very  beginning.  The parts don&#x27;t stay together!  The rotator blades are extremely unstable and very difficult to reassemble. Today I had a new low and decided to warn others about this product.  I can&#x27;t believe it got any good review at all. WARNING: DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!</li>
    <li> I echo the problems of a few others.  The damned heads keep falling off.  It got to the point where I was happy if one stayed in place for use; of course, it took three times as long to shave.  A waste of money (including the extra set of blades I bought) since it&#x27;s heading for the trash soon.</li>
    <li> I own an expensive (~$200) PHILIPS shaver that I bought 15 years ago and that stopped holding a charge just a few months later after I purchased it, but I kept using it anyway by charging it every time I needed to shave. It takes about 30 minutes to shave with it though. The PHILIPS have refused to send me replacement parts, so 15 years years later, hoping the technology and quality has improved I purchased REMINGTON R7130 360 degree Pivot &amp; Flex shaver for ~$70 which was the most expensive with all the necessary features that I needed.    Within the first minute of shaving with Remington R7130 one of the the rolling heads fell off and I managed to step on it and injure my foot.    Since I only used it for about 2 minutes I&#x27;m only going to post my experience with this brand new shaver.    PROS:     1. While it&#x27;s new it shaves fast.  2. The design is fine (the quality of the head is not).    CONS:    1. The individual shaving heads removable from the outside are an engineering blunder. If you shave with a circular motion the heads are going to come right off. When you open the head to clean it, it is quite flimsy and I had a tough time getting it screwed back into its track.    2. Poor build quality, flimsy, cheap plastic and metal parts. It looks and feels cheap. The headpiece seems to be made of thin low quality plastic, so I&#x27;m not sure how durable it is. I&#x27;m afraid it won&#x27;t last long and it&#x27;s very easy to break the head cover that opens, - one wrong move and you need a new shaver. If this is their top of the line model, I would not like to experience the less expensive ones.    3. Not a close shave; flexible head makes it hard to shave - the razor doesn&#x27;t glide very well over the skin. One head on my face at a time - it is not easy to get a straight line due to its three rotating shavers.    4. The plastic cover for the shaver head does not hold on the head.    5. There is no charger stand.    6. There is no case.    7. The only accessory is a brush.    8. Havinghad experience with shavers that were \\&quot;Made in USSR\\&quot;, it reminds me of one and even has some parts market with cyrillic letters.    How could it perform so poorly for me with all the positive reviews it&#x27;s gotten?     Conclusion: It would make a good, recyclable $10 shaver. If it was a $20 I would still keep it, but at ~$70 I&#x27;m returning it to the store. The only problem is, they don&#x27;t have anything else here apart from PHILIPS-NORELCO and REMINGTON and I don&#x27;t like linear shavers. I&#x27;d gladly give a try to a Japanese brand that has all parts made in Japan.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this razor.  I shaved with it for the first time today and the heads popped off.  I couldn&#x27;t keep them attached to the razor.  I&#x27;ve contacted the company and I hope they will refund my money.  This was a terrible design.  I hope they take this back to the drawing boards.</li>
    <li> Been using it about a month or two now.  I think my wife and daughter probably spent twice as much on a fancier one for my birthday a few years back.  The trimmer on that other one broke after about 4 months, time will tell on this new one, but so far I can&#x27;t tell the difference in the quality of the shave (other than this one has newer blades and so shaves better, as one would expect of a new razor).  I would buy this one again, assuming it lasts me another year or two.  I don&#x27;t do five stars unless I am uncommonly surprised by some benefit I wasn&#x27;t expecting, but this does everything I expected.  Comfortable to hold, gets to all the face/neck places and surfaces I need it for.</li>
    <li> I already own a Philips/Norelco 7240XL and I was curious to see how the Remington R 7130 would be, especially when it claims a super-smooth close shave thanks to its teflon coated surfaces.&lt;br /&gt;The result is a bit of a mixed bag; the biggest surprise was that the two razors are very similar, to the point that it&#x27;s clear they&#x27;re designed and made by the same company despite their different brand names.&lt;br /&gt;The Remington seems to spin faster than the Philips; it&#x27;s definitely noisier, although still not noisy enough to be an annoyance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of shaving results, I honestly can&#x27;t say that I see a difference with the Philips. Everybody&#x27;s face is different, but I definitely won&#x27;t be getting a close shave with either. The teflon coating did not seem to make much of a difference, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a fancy LCD display to let you know the remaining battery life. It may seem silly at first, but it&#x27;s actually really convenient, although I didn&#x27;t perform any tests to see how accurate it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like the Philips, this cordless razor can be use in corded mode by simply plugging it in. The charger is world-compatible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest complaint I have with the Remington is that cleaning it is a bit of a chore. Each head cover grille must be removed individually, because hair collects in the blade wells. I think the Philips is much faster, easier and less cumbersome to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, this is a nice electric razor, but not quite the shaving revolution...</li>
    <li> I have never used an electric shaver before this one. It gives a nice close shave, though I&#x27;ve been having problems with getting a close shave on my neck and it seems to be irritating my skin on my neck. I&#x27;m not sure if this is normal. I wish this came with a stand, but it&#x27;s not a big deal. This shaver is very easy to clean and does the job.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving for over 20 plus years now... and not once have I purchased an electric razor.  I received this one for free, so I figured why not.  This electric razor gets the job done!  It gets all the stubble and then some.  My face feels almost as smooth as a razor and cream shave.  Easy to use, easy to clean, and I would definitely consider this as my electric razor of choice.  As I stated in the title though... this unit would not make me change the way I&#x27;ve been shaving.  I am happy with traditional shaving cream and razor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had several different shavers over the year, and for the most part they have been foil shavers.  I figured since it worked well, why change?  When presented with the opportunity to try a rotary shaver, I was a bit skeptical, but jumped at it.    I shave perhaps once every 4-7 days, allowing the hair to grow out a little bit.  My foil shaver would take several pass throughs to do the trick, but occasionally left me with razor burn.  In my experience, it usually takes a few uses to adapt to a razor. The irritation usually decreases with more uses.  The R-7130 rotary was more efficient, and left me with no razor burn.      Pros:  - Quick!  - Smooth shave &amp; no razor burn. The teflon-rotary blades coupled with the pivot feature seems to work very well.    - Charge indicator -- most indicators give a scale of 1-5 (Low-High) how much battery is left.  This one breaks it down to minutes, much more useful!  - Can use water to clean  - Seems well-built    Cons:  - A dry shaver.  Would be nice if it was a wet/dry shaver.  - Lacks a cleaning station (though most shavers at this price range don&#x27;t include one either)  - Lacks a carrying case.  - No charging station (Though a cord suits my purposes fine)    Though I&#x27;ve been a user of foil shavers for many years, I believe I&#x27;m ready to switch.  I would not hesitate to recommend this shaver to anyone.</li>
    <li> The Remington Flex 360 Model  is a rechargeable dry shave razor. It has three shaving heads that rotate in all directions adjusting to the contours of the face and neck. The razor has a large digital LCD that shows the remaining minutes of shave time and a pop-up trimmer. The packaging includes a charging system and cleaning brush, however disappointingly, there is no storage stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dad:  \\&quot;Using the Remington Flex 360, for the first time, is surprisingly fast and easy, after an initial 24 hour charge. The handle grip, for control, is very comfortable. This razor achieves a quality shave after several passes. In my opinion, using an electric razor pre-shave helps achieve a smoother and quicker shave. The shaving head can be cleaned with the brush or under running water. The plastic, protective head cover seems to be on the flimsy side -- as it is difficult to align and snap in place.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...as usual, Dad, you look Fabulous!  --Katharena Eiermann, 2008</li>
    <li> Just got this a few days ago.  The first shave was uneven and it left a face with a brning sensation.  Used my old Norelco to finish what this junk left behind.  It is going back to the store.  As many reviewers have said, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.  The reason I tried this brand for the first time, was the 60% off the list price.</li>
    <li> Great shaver; great customer service; great charging system. Also, great design. I&#x27;ve never had the heads pop off. It&#x27;s possible that some people don&#x27;t know how to reinstall them correctly after cleaning. Once you know how, it&#x27;s very easy. In any case, I understand Remington has changed that part of the design anyway.      To get the most out this shaver: Wash your face with soap &amp; warm water, dry thorougly, wait 10 minutes(while you do other things). Run your hand against the whiskers, then stretch your skin slightly with your free hand, shave against the grain. Don&#x27;t press hard! Shave every day (I don&#x27;t think electrics work well on long hairs). Use the trimmer for stubborn hairs. Tap or blow or brush hairs out of the shaver. Once a month: remove the whole head &amp; remove individual cutters and heads (try not to mix up the pairs). Wash with dish soap and warm water. Allow to dry. Put a drop or two of oil onto your finger &amp; gently smear onto all the metal parts (including the cutters the best you can). You&#x27;re good for another month.</li>
    <li> I bought this unit as a possible replacement for my Norelco, and it was going great until I tried to charge it for the third time.  It will no longer take a charge, and since my return window closed after 30 days, I&#x27;m stuck with this piece of crap, which will no doubt be in the recycle bin before the end of the day.  I suppose I could have gotten a \\&quot;lemon\\&quot;, but not likely to take a chance on Remington again.  I&#x27;m also aware of the inherent risk that goes with buying online, so if you feel lucky....go for it!  You could be as lucky as the other reviewers, or you could get burnt as I did.    Update.  After a short &#x27;cooling off period&#x27;, I recalled the manufacturer&#x27;s warranty (d&#x27;oh!) and gave them a call. They told me to send it in for inspection, which I did, and 3 days later received a replacement in the mail. (That was easy!!)  The new one works fine, so far, and the customer service was commendable, encouraging me to sing a slightly different tune....  This shaver works fine and is very easy to clean.  Try it, you may like it.    Update No.2  After using this shaver for a few months now, I&#x27;m back to my original opinion of the product itself, irregardless of customer service. Making the individual shaving heads removable from the outside, with a simple 1/8th turn has proven to be an engineering blunder!  If you shave with a circular motion of the shaver, with any amount of drag the heads are going to come right off!!! They would probably send me another one, but I&#x27;ve had all I can take from this product.  Recycled!    \\&quot;Final\\&quot; update. June 2010. I should have recycled this shaver as I originally intended! However, I continued to use it being careful HOW I used it. Last night when it hit the bottom of the trash can, it shattered into 7 or 8 pieces! That&#x27;s how angry it made me!  I will NEVER own another Remington shaver!  End of story.</li>
    <li> I bought the original version of this razor a year or 2 ago.  The heads fall off each time I shave.  Also, stubble continuously falls out making a mess.  I cannot believe that Remington released this product with its faults.  I understand this this version is supposed to fix these problems.  But after having released a very poor razor when they must have known of its issues, how can I trust them ever again?</li>
    <li> Keeps a good charge, cuts close without cutting, or irritation, good price. I had certain spots, just could not shave close, this razor does it for me.</li>
    <li> The Remington Flex360 family of electric razors includes the R-4130, R-5130, and the R-7130.  The high-end R-7130 sells for around $80 on Amazon, the R-5130 for $55, while the low-end model, R-4130, goes for $44 on Amazon.  The difference among the models is the charging system. There is also a charging stand available for $10.  These are all competitive prices.  However, the true test of a razor is how well it shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the years, I have used electric razors manufactured by Remington, Braun, and Norelco.  I have found that the Flex360 gives me a close uniform shave which is the equal of the best that I have had.  It also does this in about three minutes, half the time of that of my previous razor, a rotary of Norelco of similar design.  So, I can get to work a few minutes earlier, or maybe better, sleep a few minutes later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The total cost over the life of an electric razor must include that of replacement cutting heads.  The SP-5161 head for the R-5130 and the R-7130 sells for $27 on Amazon, while the SP-3141 head for the R-4130 is $21.  These are equal to or lower than the prices of replacement heads for other razors.  The instruction booklet suggests replacing the heads every twelve months.  That may be optimistic since I have had to buy replacement heads for other razors after around six months.  However, it could work out to twelve months since the time per shave is only three minutes, much lower than for the others that I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: I have been using the Remington shaver for almost one year and have not had to replace the cutting heads.</li>
    <li> I used to use Remington for years and have always thought they were top quality. There have been some improvements since I used one last. Now, the three round shaver heads flex (a little) more independently from each other than before. And the entire shaving pad has kind of a shock absorber effect to it. Overall, I&#x27;d say these are great improvements to the older models I used to use. Aside from that, it&#x27;s still the same tried and true Remington design, form and function. They didn&#x27;t reinvent the wheel, but fans of Remington probably wouldn&#x27;t want them to either. But I think that might be what keeps me from switching back to this razor and using it on a regular basis again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular model is quite frugal. Just a rechargeable shaver and a power cord. The razor is rinseable, which possibly means it could also be used in the shower, though I didn&#x27;t see that listed specifically anywhere. But the problem for me is the Braun Pulsonic beats this thing to a pulp in every respect. The most important difference being the closeness of the shave. This one doesn&#x27;t even come close to the Braun Pulsonic when it comes to closeness and quality of shave. Also, I can tell the Remington would irritate my skin over time. I actually got a bit of a razor burn mark on my skin with it. The Pulsonic has never done that, in fact, it&#x27;s always given a remarkably close shave with no irritation ever. I had to press harder and shave longer to get near the quality of shave I did with the Braun Pulsonic; which is so fine tuned, one need not press the razor into the skin at all and still it gets closer and a better shave. It&#x27;d also be hard to go back to self- cleaning, or even rinsing under a tap, after being spoiled with the Braun Pulsonic&#x27;s cleaning base. It&#x27;s true, the Braun Pulsonic is far more expensive than this one. But you do get what you pay for. And a razor is something that most people use on a daily basis, so getting the best isn&#x27;t a luxury, but a necessity, especially if appearance is important for you personally or for your job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So overall, I&#x27;d say this Remington is okay, though if you&#x27;re an avid fan, I&#x27;d go for one of their higher end models. Definitely wouldn&#x27;t buy this one unless your old Remington broke and this is the best you can afford. But if your old one is still running fine, there&#x27;s no reason to spend money on this one. And if you&#x27;re not a 100% solid Remington fan, then I say go with the Braun Pulsonic. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!appearance is important for you personally or for your job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So overall, I&#x27;d say this Remington is okay, though if you&#x27;re an avid fan, I&#x27;d go for one of their higher end models.

    <li> After a month of daily use I am returning to using my Braun Foil Shaver. This Razor does a decent job of shaving the cheeks but it is advertised as being great6 on the neck. In my opinion it falls very far short of a consumers expectation. After shaving my neck it was definetly in need of good after shave. Battery life was decent and it is easy to clean the blades.</li>
    <li> A long, long time ago, when I was fresh out of college, my cousin sold Remington shavers and got me one for insider price. It was the old-fashioned straight-line kind. I tried it once and it irritated my skin so much that I never tried it again. I&#x27;ve stuck with sensitive-skin products like Edge and the various generations of Gillette multiblade hand razors since.    When I read about this new Remington, with its Teflon coating, I decided to try electric shaving again. I was a little hesitant at first, but when the Remington got here I decided to go for it. First of all, it&#x27;s a good size and weight for my hand, which is maybe a little larger than normal. It balances well and so it&#x27;s easy to control its movement.    Surprisingly, the shaver came charged for 60 minutes of use (even though they tell you to charge it for 24 hours before using). I really like the LCD readout that shows you how many minutes of charge are left.    I have to admit I was a little nervous about putting it to my face, after the bad experience from decades ago. I took my first shave very gently and wasn&#x27;t concerned with how close a shave I could get. This really helped me get a feel for how to move the rotary blades around my face and neck. Two days later I tried it again, and this time I tried to go for a gentle but close shave. I got a better feel for the circular motion and found that I didn&#x27;t have to press nearly as hard as I thought to get a decent shave. It helped a lot to do as they advised: pull your skin tight as you move along so that your hairs stand up as much as possible.    Bottom line: By my third try I got a good close shave and only the slightest irritation--and that was around the moustache area where it is indeed much more difficult to maneuver. I have to agree with other posters here that this is one area that needs improvement. The Teflon seems to make the shave palatable even for my sensitive skin. I felt no hair pulling at all and a fairly smooth ride across my face. I still have a ways to go in my \\&quot;technique\\&quot; to get a quick, smooth shave, but I really think this newfangled gadget is going to do the trick.    Updated March 23, 2009: After a few more weeks, I got tired of using this and went back to my trusty old manual razor. Then about a month after that, I ran out of shaving cream and pulled out the Remington. I kind of liked the shave, so I tried it again a couple days later. Went well again. I started using it regularly. The only negative I felt was that the blades kind of dragged over my face, even after I dried my face thoroughly after a shower. So I ordered the Remington preshave powder stick thingy and now the razor just glides over my face and gives me a perfect shave every time. No irritation. Highly recommended, especially with the preshave.</li>
    <li> Pros:  -----  Battery lasts a long time  Easy to use and clean  Feels good in my hands  Price is fair    Cons:  -----  Simply not as close of a shave compared to my 7 year old Norelco      After years of using a top of the line Norelco, I decided to switch to a different brand. The top of the line Norelco was not perfect (battery) and way over priced, but gave me a closer shave.   The Remington is nice and easy to use and clean. The battery lasts longer than on the Norelco. But it simply does not shave close enough.    Summary:  --------  Great midrange shaver with long battery life, if you are not too picky about a close shave.</li>
    <li> This shaver is a poor example of what a shaver should be. I shaved with it the first time and the blade and the housing fell out on the floor and keeps doing it because they made the shaver that you insert the blade from the front not like the older model with the lock ring inside. I have to always put the blade back in. real junk</li>
    <li> I am a confirmed blade shaver. I have had nothing but bad experiences with electric shavers in the past; irritation, poor shave, missing spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor is a vast improvement. The &#x27;flex&#x27; really does work. The whole head swivels which helps in hard to reach places. And the shaving is extremely comfortable, no bad after effects at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alas not quite as close as my blade. Now part of that might be a learning curve or part of the nature of electric shavers. However I am overall quite pleased with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a thoughtful design that it will allow you to use current up to 240 volts and it has an LCD display showing how many minutes of shaving time you have left. Both very handy. It also includes a pop-up trimmer. Overall, pain-free, gets to hard to reach places, close but not as close as a blade shave. Vast improvement over my previous attempts to like electric razors.</li>
    <li> The Remington R7130 gives the best shave I have ever seen from a rotary electric razor. I work in a hospital and shave many people, so I have used a wide array of razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this to someone looking for a rotary electric razor. No, it will not give you as good of a shave as a blade, or a foil shaver, but it is gentler on sensitive skin, and faster and easier than shaving with a razor blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first impression was that it looks cool, and it was comfortable to hold. The body is lightweight, but sturdy, and the rubber grips on the side are a nice touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To test it, I shaved half of my husbands face, and then I had him shave the other half to get his opinion, as well. He has sensitive skin, and can grow a beard while you watch.  After shaving with this, his skin felt smooth, and he was surprised by the lack of irritation to his skin. We were both happy with the closeness of the shave, and the ease of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived charged, so I was able to use it right out of the box. The LED readout shows how many minutes of shaving time you have left on the battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The three heads are flexible and move around, plus the piece that they sit on pivots in all directions, facilitating very good contact to your skin, even on rounded areas of your face. I think this improved contact is what makes for a closer and consistently better shave, than I&#x27;ve seen with other three head rotary razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Teflon coating seems to really work. My husband&#x27;s skin gets irritated very easily and he had no problems from this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved that you can rinse it out to clean it, and that it isn&#x27;t as noisy as similar razors that I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The heads are easy to remove and replace. You just hold them down and twist to the right to remove them. To replace them, a small dot shows you where to line them up to twist them back into place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pop-up trimmer on the back is handy, too.</li>
    <li> I always like to start off a review with a little background info on my experience with common products, so the customer knows were I am coming from. Well I myself am a very loyal customer to the Braun 8595. It has no drawbacks other than the cost of the cartridges, but other than that, it is perfect in execution. Now on the Remington!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me delineate what kind of face I will be shaving on today. I am early 20&#x27;s and a fair-dry skinned individual, I have a tumultuous dark beard that is almost impossible to completely shave off without having a little black show on my skin (Yea it&#x27;s like wearing steel wool), and I do have a propensity for skin irritation. I have about 5 days growth on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, here is what I liked about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.It is an attractive little razor,&lt;br /&gt;2.It is extremely quiet while shaving (smooth, calming sound if you ask me)&lt;br /&gt;3. Baby smooth shave&lt;br /&gt;.. and well that&#x27;s about it really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are my distastes:&lt;br /&gt;1. Got caught in my hairs, which is extremely annoying, because frankly it hurts. (Don&#x27;t know if this is because of the newness)&lt;br /&gt;2. Left the skin on my neck irritated and caused redness (Every rotary I&#x27;ve had has done this, so maybe it&#x27;s relative)&lt;br /&gt;3. Although I said it was a baby smooth shave, it did however leave just a vestige more of visible hair on my face than my original Braun. (still baby smooth like I earlier said)&lt;br /&gt;4. Was hard, and pretty much impossible, for me to shave my upper lip, maybe it&#x27;s because Im not handy with a rotary, still It was very difficult to shave my upper lip, so I didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t very pleased with the product, probably because of my facial traits, who knows? Maybe somebody with less obtrusive facial hair would fair better than I. Un-dubiously, I&#x27;m sticking with my Braun.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Remington shavers for over twenty years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one has replaced my last Remington shaver I bought five years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros are many and I&#x27;ll just mention a few important improvements which I consider great advances in shaving technology : three flexing heads getting a closer grip on the neck and other harder-to-shave areas, the teflon coating which protects your skin and the ninety minute recharge which should last for nearly three weeks with average use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With all these improvements, I definitely recommend this shaver highly.</li>
    <li> There is a lot to like about this razor.  It&#x27;s easy to use, easy to store, easy to charge, easy to clean (just run through water) -- I like the fact that it tells me how many minutes of charge remain.  It works as well for me as much more expensive electric razors that I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only gripe is that I don&#x27;t find the key feature on this one -- the flexible razor heads -- to be much of an advantage.  It gives a slightly more comfortable shave, and works as well on my upper face, but when it comes to shaving below my chin I find that the \\&quot;wiggle room\\&quot; means it sometimes doesn&#x27;t cut so well in hard to reach spots -- above my adam&#x27;s apple, for example.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried lots of electric razors and this one seems about as good as most but I can&#x27;t detect any significant improvement.  In general I find that electric razors only work for me if you shave very often -- morning and night.  As soon as I begin to develop any serious stubble, electric razors seem to miss quite a bit and I have to finish the job with a disposable plastic razor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned a number of razors over the years, but so far this one seems to be one of the best available in its price range on the market.    No problems or annoyances to report, and much better than the Braun I used for three years before it for actual closeness of shave and ability to hold a charge.    My only worry is that the replacement shaver heads I bought to go with it, in preparation for that time down the road when the originals wear out, are of a lower quality (Teflon coated) than the titanium ones that come with it. Experience has shown that replacement heads never hold up as well as originals on these razors, usually only having about half the lifespan of the original.</li>
    <li> I just received this razor in the mail after calling Remington to order a replacement cord for an older model. I told them I lost the old cord. They didn&#x27;t carry my razor anymore so they were not able to send a new cord. Ordinarily this would have upset me quite a bit but - without any prodding by me - they sent me a brand new razor that is 3 steps higher model than my old one. Customer service is king and they went far beyond what I would have ever expected. They have a lifetime customer in me!!</li>
    <li> I let my very macho &amp; rugged brother test this razor for me.  He gave it an \\&quot;I love it; it&#x27;s great!\\&quot; rating, and the only criticism he had is that it doesn&#x27;t get quite as close as a manual shaver, but not far from it.  He tested it for a week, and gave the following report:&lt;br /&gt;--have to charge for 24 hours before 1st use&lt;br /&gt;--has 60 minute counter that tells you when it&#x27;s time to recharge&lt;br /&gt;--easy to shave under the nose&lt;br /&gt;--handy for shaving back of the neck, which you can&#x27;t do with a manual shaver&lt;br /&gt;--easy to open and clean&lt;br /&gt;--quiet&lt;br /&gt;--does as excellent a job on 3-day growth as on 4 o&#x27;clock shadow&lt;br /&gt;--didn&#x27;t tug or pinch hairs (noted &amp; appreciated on that 3-day growth)&lt;br /&gt;--easy to hold; good size grip&lt;br /&gt;--needed no directions; just plugged in and shaved&lt;br /&gt;--sideburn attachment worked very well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My brother has been looking for a girlfriend after his recent divorce, so thank you Remington for one nice clean-shaven face!</li>
    <li> The Remington R-7130 Flex 360 LCD cordless razor has a head made of Teflon so it feels smoother and it also pivots, so you can shave anywhere around your face very easily. You even get great results around the neck area.  The final result is a smooth, close cut and this is remarkable considering you don&#x27;t feel like you just had a shave.   My mother-in-law was very pleased to see her son looking so clean shaven!    This is a rechargeable dry shave razor with three shaving heads that rotate in all directions adjusting to the contours of the face and neck. There is a large digital LCD that shows the remaining minutes of shave time - really handy and an improvement on the razor this replaced.     The sleek design makes it easy to hold, and it is very quiet.  Oh, and it is also easy to clean (just rinse the head assembly with warm water).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a Braun linear style razor for the last 10 years, and have always been happy with the results.  That, paired with the easy cleaning and portability (they&#x27;ve all included travel cases) have been the key reasons I&#x27;ve stuck with the brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the foil on my current Braun finally wore through, and instead of purchasing another expensive foil, I thought I&#x27;d give the rotary style razor a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Remington looked like a good quality product, with good reviews, so we ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first think I noticed was how bulky the razor is.  There&#x27;s no travel case, and it wouldn&#x27;t fit in my travel bag.  Next I noted that the razor felt a bit cheap.  Light weight is good, but there is a fine line between something that feels lightweight because of quality, and something that just feels like it&#x27;s light because it&#x27;s not made well.  This razor feels cheap to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few passes with the Remington on one side of my face, I was ready to throw in the towel.  I&#x27;m sure there are faces out there that are very happy with the large head on the Remington, but I guess mine&#x27;s not one of them.  I have a relatively lean and I guess small face compared to many men, so the big three-head design only had one head on my face at a time.  The shave felt awkward and just not very comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, for guys with larger faces and maybe some issues with shaver irritation, this may be the perfect tool for daily shaving.  For guys with smaller faces, or who do lots of travelling, the Linear razors just seem to fit the bill better.</li>
    <li> I am not a fan of electric razors, but I am always willing to try a new one, hopeful that one day I will find an electric razor that shaves nearly as close as a manual, and doesn&#x27;t rip up my face.  The Remington R-7130 comes close, but still doesn&#x27;t beat my $10 Gillette Fusion, although i realize I can&#x27;t really compare the two.  The first thing I noticed is that the razor feels cheap.  It is mainly plastic, which is okay because it makes the razor lighter, but for the price, I expected it to be made of stronger materials.  I can&#x27;t really fault it for that though, because it doesn&#x27;t seem to affect its performance.  The good thing about the razor, is that the Flex 360 system really does work pretty well.  I could feel it contour to my neck much more so than other electric razors I&#x27;ve used recently.  This may be due to the flex in the blade handle in addition to the individual flex built into the three blades. It felt great and irritated my face less than what I&#x27;ve used in the past. Unfortunately though, it still caused me irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results were fairly typical for an electric razor.  I couldn&#x27;t get nearly as close as I could with a manual razor, which I expected, but it also took longer to shave than with a manual razor, because I kept trying to angle it to get hard to reach areas, like the upper lip.  The LCD screen was a nice addition and it really does clean very easily under the faucet.</li>
    <li> The Remington R-7130 Flex 360 LCD Cord/Cordless Rotary Shaver provides a very close and comfortable shave and cleaning it is a snap!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt;&gt; Comfort&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Shaving -&lt;br /&gt;The shaver provided a very comfortable shave the very first time I used it. Unlike some electric shavers, I did not feel pinching or pulling on my hair during shaving and my skin did not feel irritated after the shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Holding the Shaver -&lt;br /&gt;The shaver is fairly lightweight. I only have one complaint: The rubber ridges on the sides of the shaver are supposed to help you maintain a firm grip on the shaver but the rubber feels more like hard plastic, which makes holding the shaver a little uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt;&gt; Performance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Rotary Shaver -&lt;br /&gt;The Remington R-7130 gives a very close shave. In fact, it does as good a job as my  [[ASIN:B000Q6SU3C Braun Series 7- 790cc (9595) Pulsonic Shaver]] shaver, which costs considerably more. I was unable to see or feel any stuble after a shave. The shaver also did not leave any patches of hair, which is a problem a lot of rotary-type shavers are reputed to have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Pop-up Trimmer -&lt;br /&gt;The pop-up trimmer does as good a job as the best dedicated trimmer you can find out there! The width of the trimmer is \\&quot;full-sized\\&quot;, and not scaled down like it is on my Braun. It was delightfully quick and easy to trim my sideburns to keep them looking kempt. The shaving compartment is deactivated while the pop-up trimmer is in use so the shaver won&#x27;t inadvertently take off any hair, which is a problem I have with my Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt;&gt; Ease of cleaning&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning is easy: The hinged comparment holding the rotary blades pops right open and you can rinse the blades under running water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt;&gt; Looks&lt;br /&gt;Despite the shaver being constructed almost entirely of plastic, it looks rather elegant and sophisticated. The shaver does not come with a charging stand, so the front and back plastic might incur some unsightly wear over time if you&#x27;re not careful to lay it on either of its rubberized sides after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt;&gt; The Verdict&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I really prefer a foil-type over a rotary-type shaver because I find that I&#x27;m able finish the job much more quickly with the former - but that&#x27;s only because I lack practice with a rotary-type shaver. With that said, I will not penalize the Remington R-7130 Rotary Shaver based on my personal bias. In fact, I am very impressed with the outstanding shave/trim the Remington R-7130 Rotary Shaver delivers -- it definitely deserves five stars!after use.      &gt;&gt; The Verdict  Personally, I really prefer a foil-type over a rotary-type shaver because I find that I&#x27;m able finish the job much more quickly with the former - but that&#x27;s only because I lack practice with a rotary-type shaver.

    <li> i charge the first time for 8 hours.. then i use it for at least a month before charging again... I was so happy but when the battery get discharged, i charge it again and doesn&#x27;t function again, they didn&#x27;t get charget again.&lt;br /&gt;When i leave it connected for at least 12 hours , it function for 1 or 2 minuts and turn of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The screen continuosly show the picture that need to connect, inclusive when this is connected .</li>
    <li> This brand has not failed me yet,owned one for 10 years and never had any problems with it.This new one is holding up to it&#x27;s name,battery life last,cleaning is easy and most important gives a great shave!</li>
    <li> I have had several of these, and this is the nicest one so far. Good price and it works well. No more Trac-II razors for me!</li>
    <li> Husband- First off this thing is really cool looking, but the whole head unit twists and pivots with my face, there&#x27;s something over these blades because I can&#x27;t even feel them on my face and my face is free of hair, so it must be doing something. It isn&#x27;t as close as my disposable, but with more practice using an electric razor I could get this thing to work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The heads all move and pivot individually and the master head is flexible. The silicone protectant over the blade cartridges is I assume what is making it not feel like the blades are on his skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor can be plugged in, it has a digital read out about the length of the batttery life, the battery is rechargeable, it comes with a little cleaning brush, and the power cord is supposedly universally adaptable. You can rinse the shaving heads under the faucet, the blades are easy to replace. There is a trimmer on the handle of the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Father-in-law - The blade heads are too big and I have to do more goofing around under my nose and above my lip to shave. The plastic protector cap goes on only one way, it&#x27;s hard for me to do and the darn thing is a pain to get off, maybe that&#x27;s me, I don&#x27;t know. The shave is smooth but it isn&#x27;t close, I get a better shave from my $35.00 jobbie. The read out is fine, but I don&#x27;t need that crap, I don&#x27;t use trimmers. My final problem is that it&#x27;s bigger than my old one and harder for me to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Wife - I used it on my legs. The size of the heads didn&#x27;t bother me at all, it pivots nicely around the knees. Smooth shave, not close and I would definately use it again in a pinch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this product for several weeks it seems that the springs behind the replacement heads have broken.  I&#x27;m also sure that the plastic that supports the blade heads has to be plastic, but at this price it sure feels and looks cheap.</li>
    <li> Before I get into how this shaver is, let us to the basics of electric shavers since there would be many newbies shifting to electric shavers from Mach-3/Sensor excel. Experienced folks, skip this section.     Let us get to the basics : Electric shavers basically come in 2 forms - Foil shavers and Rotary shavers     Rotaries are much good at cutting longer hairs, like for example around the neck, if you let us say skip shaving over the weekend and then start shaving on Monday morning. Foil shavers will simply fail in this situation. There are 2 more items where I do not like foils - foils are difficult to clean since the hair gets trapped in the inner chamber and foil shavers give you more burn compared to rotary blades.     To me looks like Rotary is the clear winner, and also more first time users are likely to stick to rotary blades compared to foils.     Irrespective of what you want, try to ask for these features: (Hmm, most atleast 80% of them include these anyway !)   -&gt; Rechargeable   -&gt; Charge level Indicator   -&gt; Check prices of replacing foils/heads     Remington R-7130:   - It is an excellent shaver, gives a smooth close shave   - Absolutely no razor burns - the teflon thing makes it glide smooth   (Make sure not to shave on dry skin, use some moisturizer)   - The rotary blades are a bit faster compared to the norelco like what the other reviewer has mentioned   - Charge indicator is very helpful to know when you need to charge     If there is one thing in this shaver which I really like - I would have to say that the teflon makes it smooth</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying a lot of shavers lately and I have to say that the R-7130 gives a really nice close comfortable shave. I was surprised how much I liked it. It&#x27;s a very easy shave and I didn&#x27;t get any razor burn at all. The digital charge indicator is very nice. I don&#x27;t think I could be without one anymore. I like to know the minutes of charge time left so I don&#x27;t have to pack the cord when going away. It is a very solid well build unit. It has some weight so it feels good in your hand. The one thing that I did find lacking was a case and charging stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to other shavers I&#x27;ve tried:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Philips Norelco Arcitec 1090 (Comes with cool accessories)  -- Sleeker, cooler, and a little bit better shave than the R-7130 but twice the price.&lt;br /&gt;Philips Norelco 8240XL (Comes with a case) --  not quite as nice of a shave as the R-7130&lt;br /&gt;Philips Norelco 8040X Moisturizing Shaver (Comes with case and stand)  -- Hard to compare since this is a wet shaver that you can use in the shower and the R-7130 is not. I like having them both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- LCD digital charge indicator. Tells you how many minutes of charge are left. Mine started at 60 minutes after the first charge. That&#x27;s almost a month of shaves.&lt;br /&gt;- Very close smooth shave. It handled a 3 day growth with no problem. No razor burn at all.&lt;br /&gt;- You can rinse it clean with water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- No Case. It would be nice to have a case to protect it. It has to lay in the drawer now.&lt;br /&gt;- No stand. It has to lay there and charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion &#x3D;&#x3D;&gt; A very nice shave for the price, but the lack of accessories is a bit disappointing.</li>
    <li> I gave this one to my husband to use because he has been looking at getting a replacement for his Braun. He was really excited to use this one and promised that he would give a review after a few shaves since according to him it takes a while for your face to adjust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well it&#x27;s been almost a month of use and according to him it&#x27;s not as good as he would have liked it to be. It&#x27;s also a little noisy but he can deal with the noise. Also left his neck irritated. He did love the digital read of the battery life but for the price of $80 thinks that it could have been built stronger. Seems a bit cheap/filmsy and just a little bulky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still give a 3 star rating but we&#x27;re still looking for that one razor that will replace his manual.</li>
    <li> Hey, it does what it needs to do.  I would buy it again, but I am a bit disappointed in the battery capacity.  When the readout gets to around 30, the motor starts to lose power, and when it his 28 or 27 at the lowest...game over, man.  I tried a couple deep discharge cycles to see if this would help, nope.  When it gets down to 28, it&#x27;s dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, this is easily enough to go a couple weeks between charges, so it isn&#x27;t really THAT impacting, it just bugs my OCD.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as an upgrade a couple years back and since then I can tell you this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you keep the blades oiled and clean they will last you a while. It is small enough to travel with and the battery has lasted a long time for the amount of use it goes through. What is disappointing is this: the trim blade on the back broke 3-4 months after I bought it so I have not had that function in a super long time.</li>
    <li> It does a good job at shaving, and it is very easy to  clean.  It is also reliable and durable.  Many  razors I bought in the past didn&#x27;t last more than a year or so.  You can change the blades easily - sold at Walmart.</li>
    <li> works fine if I shave every other day but pulls a bit when my beard gets longer( 1/4&amp;#34;) it&#x27;s ok</li>
    <li> After going through multiple versions of a competitor&#x27;s product, I decided to try a Remington. I&#x27;m very happy with it: very sharp blades, a nice close shave, everything I want in a shaver. An excellent choice!</li>
    <li> Got this for Christmas and used it for about 30 seconds before repacking it and taking it back. It was supposed to replace my old Phillishave that still worked but the battery wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge long after about 6 years of use. I tend to shave when my hair gets pretty long and that could have a lot to do with it pulling but my old razor didn&#x27;t even after 6 years (with original blades)I went and traded it for a Philips Norelco which works great. The Remington was heavier and louder too..</li>
    <li> Remington R6130 Diamond Flex 360 LCD Cord/Cordless Rechargeable Men&#x27;s Rotary Shaver     Needing a new razor I checked online user reviews for foil and rotary shavers.  I chose the Remington R6130 Diamond Corded/Cordless model, touted as having much longer wearing heads, even though some purchaser reviews had negative comments about the 130 series.     I&#x27;ve used electric shavers for 45 yrs.  Real blades cut too close for me, resulting in ingrown facial hair and skin irritation.  Normally I shave first thing in the morning, face unwashed.      I&#x27;ve used the 6130 for a month now and after a couple of disappointing learning experiences decided to keep it.     Pro: Wonderfully smooth, quick, close, comfortable shave in 90 seconds or less.  A lighter touch, without pulling skin tight, is better for me as it eliminates ingrown hairs and skin irritation around corners of the mouth.    Con: If at all possible, when cleaning do not remove individual cutter heads/blades from the hairpocket.  They&#x27;re unbelievably difficult to reinstall.  Use caution if vacuuming hair from the driver base cup (below the hairpocket), because the individual, spring loaded drive shafts pop out easily from their retainers.      Any good fortune in finding the tiny spring(s) will likely necessitate the taking of a spiritual vow of some sort.  Failing that, you&#x27;ll need to contact the manufacturer and order replacement springs.  By the time they arrive you&#x27;ll have the start of a great beard and may decide you don&#x27;t need the shaver after all.    My daily (?) cleaning routine: Rinse (do not immerse) under hot water tap, place razor in charging stand w/hairpocket-cutter assembly raised (facilitates drying), and later wonder where I put the protective head cover when I go back to close it.    I&#x27;ve decided to keep the shaver, hoping it will perform admirably when cleaned as designed by merely rinsing under the hot water tap.      Opinion: A more \\&quot;hands-on, old school\\&quot; approach to cleaning will likely resultin extreme dissatisfaction with this razor.       PS: I find shaving with an electric razor goes better for me if I do not wash my face or shower first.  The unwashed beard \\&quot;stands up\\&quot; better and natural skin oils seem to give just enough lubrication for a smooth shave.</li>
    <li> After having bought and returned over a dozen electric razors, all with the SAME promise of \\&quot;it shaves as close as a razor!\\&quot;, I finally found one that shaves ALMOST as close as a razor. Let&#x27;s face it, NO electric razor will do that. It&#x27;s not gonna happen. I know, I tried every maker on the market from Panasonic to Braun who ALL claim that their electric razor shaves \\&quot;as close as a razor\\&quot;. I bought them all and returned them all because of false advertising. But, THIS razor, the Remington R-170 Flex 360, while not shaving \\&quot;as close as a razor\\&quot; comes pretty darn close...AND it was the best out of all the others I&#x27;ve bought, tried, and tested. I use it not only for my face but also for my bald head as well! Simple, flexible, and it cuts clean and smooth. Still, not as clean and smooth as a regular razor blade &amp; shaving cream...but it&#x27;ll do in a pinch. Nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 10/29/13&lt;br /&gt;After a year and a half the battery has dwindled and NOW it only holds a 60-second charge!</li>
    <li> I was hoping that Remington had developed a razor that bested Norelco&#x27;s rotary razor.     While they have made some good steps, they have a little way to go yet.     First the Pluses -      -The Remington has a much larger clippings capacity. While the Norelco rotaries require cleaning after every shave (and sometimes halfway through a shave if your beard is thick enough or the cutting efficiency drops like a rock) unless you have very short whiskers, the Remington can hold several shavings worth of clippings because the space is so large beneath the razor heads.     -Cleaning is easier in that you can clean the razor heads under running water instead of taking the heads apart. This is a very tedious task with the Norelco, since it is difficult to reassemble the parts when you have them all dusted off. With the Remington, you can just pop the head from the body with the release button, remove the head from the body completely since it is held by a small clip and then run the heads under a stream of water. When done, ensure they are dry and then slip the clip back in place and close the head, after brushing out any loose whiskers in the space below the heads of course.     - The pop up trimmer is better than the one on the Norelco. It has a more powerful clipping motion so it more easily clips mustaches, sideburns, around beards, etc. A small negative is that it does seem to want to close more easily than the Norelco&#x27;s, which seems to have a stronger spring to maintain its position. But the Norelco doesn&#x27;t have half the power that the Remington trimmer has. So once you get used to using the Remington, you will like it much more than the Norelco for trimming.     -The remaining time until recharge LCD display is great. It lets you know how many minutes of power are left before you have to recharge the shaver. The maximum running time is one hour and it counts down the remaining minutes in dark grey numerals on a medium grey display just below the power button. It is about 1/2 inch high by 3/4 inch wide so the numerals are easily read even without glasses for those with vision problems.    -Powerful cutting. This razor cuts my beard much more quickly than my Norelco does. Where my Norelco takes four or five strokes across my cheeks to get all of the whiskers cut off, this does it in one or two strokes, three at most. The Norelco is severely underpowered, which may be why it is so much quieter than the Remington is.      Now for the Negative points:     - The charging is via a simple cord that plugs into the bottom of the shaver. My Norelco shaver has a charging stand, so just setting the razor into the stand begins the recharging process. It has two LEDs, a green one telling you it is charging and a red one telling you that it needs to be recharged. But it doesn&#x27;t give you clue about how much remaining time there is before you need to recharge it. While this isn&#x27;t a major negative point against the Remington, it is a bit irritating unless you travel a lot, where the charging stand would then be a negative point for the Norelco.      - Noisy. This razor sounds like a grinder. When shaving, sometimes it sounds like the razor is grinding its own blades and maybe it is. I haven&#x27;t removed the blades from the head to find out if it is doing so or not. Because it is new, maybe it is grinding away high spots on the cutting blades but after a number of shaves using it, the sound is getting worse, not better.     - The \\&quot;Teflon\\&quot; coating on the heads hasn&#x27;t made the razor any less irritating to my skin. With my Norelco, after one or two shaves, the irritation was virtually gone while with the Remington it seems to be getting worse the more times I have used the shaver.     - The \\&quot;Floating\\&quot; heads are not floating enough. The Remington uses a concept where the entire platform the heads are mounted upon floats. So all three heads are still on the same plane, but the plane itself tilts to adjust to the angles of your face. The problem with thisis that it works for wide planes like your cheeks and your throat areas. But when you get to your chin and jaw line, the angles are too sharp to allow the floating heads to effectively work.  The Norelco, on the other hand uses an individual head floating system where each head tilts independent of the other two. In addition, each head has its own individual platform that also tilts independently of the other two head platforms. This allows for an even greater float angle that if only the heads themselves floated. What this does is make for much better and closer cutting along the jaw line and the chin areas, while still performing fairly well on broad areas like the cheeks and neck (though not as well as the Remington if you have fairly flat cheeks).  So while the Norelco doesn&#x27;t do as good of a job on those areas as the Remington does, it is far superior to the Remington on the chin and jaw areas.  The best of both worlds would be to incorporate the two concepts together, with the entire head mount tilting like it does with the Remington and yet having the individual heads and their individual platforms to independently tilt to allow for better and closer coverage of angular areas like the chin and jaw areas.   The Remington is closer to achieving this since it has the broad head platform already floating and the heads floating within that broad head platform. All that is needed is for them to make the last step of making the heads sit on individual head platforms set into the broad head platform they already have and they would end up with a better system than Norelco&#x27;s.      -Quality. I couldn&#x27;t believe it but in the middle of shaving, a drive shaft for one of the floating heads actually fell off! They are plastic drive shafts and they are mounted in thin plastic mounts. I don&#x27;t know for sure what happened but I assume that when the platform tilted too far in one direction it put enough side force on the shaft to dislodge it from its setting. It may not have been completely aligned after the last time I cleaned it, but because the shafts are so long because of the larger capacity for clippings the shafts mat not have seated correctly in all three heads. It was very easy to put in back into the setting, but if you were doing your shaving over the sink you have to hope the shaft foesn&#x27;t fall down the drain! Too easy, which is probably why it threw the shaft in the first place. Either the plastic is too soft or too thin to tolerate much side force before dislodging.   This has never happened in well over 20 years of using Norelco rotary razors. Norelco uses drive shafts that are about three times as thick as the ones Remington uses and are not easy to remove at all. This bothers me in that we are talking about shafts that are about 1/2 to 5/8 inch long and about 3/8 inch thick on the Norelco and about 1/8 (or perhaps 3/16 or maybe 5/32) inch thick in the Remington, while the Remington shafts are twice as long which allows for more distortion since the whole platform the heads sit on is so flexible. That is the trade off for having a higher capacity to store clippings. So Remington should not have decreased the diameter of the shafts so they are so much thinner than those that Norelco uses. I believe if Remington used shafts as wide as Norelco&#x27;s, this problem wouldn&#x27;t occur.</li>
    <li> My husband has tried all kinds of electric Razors (Shick &amp; Norelco), but this one is the best of all.  He get a smooth close shave with Reminton R-7130 Flex 360, and it does not leave his face irritated. The Rem hugs every curve of his face.  He had me order another one for his co-worker as a present.</li>
    <li> I shave about every 2-3 days and after the 3rd day I usually have a 5:00 shadow.  I wanted to try an electric razor since Amazon vine send me one I decided to give it a try.  When I took the R-7130 out of the box I noticed it was all the plastic.  OK...now I&#x27;m skeptical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comfortable:  Pretty close shave including neck (not as close as a razor but I figure everyone would know this) The shaving head is flexible to fit the contour of your face and neck. This is a very comfortable razor so be careful of how much pressure you put on the razor while you shave if you have sensitive skin.  It also has pretty powerful cutting blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning:  Piece of cake, you don&#x27;t have to take anything apart.  I just ran it under some water and that&#x27;s all it took.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The LCD display is GREAT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn&#x27;t like&lt;br /&gt;TOO NOISEY, too much plastic and needs a charging stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, not a bad shaver if you can get it for free.</li>
    <li> Is not a very good quality, its horrible to find this blades. I am very pleased to have made ​​this purchase, good price and value relationship</li>
    <li> Excelente eleccion! Es tremenda Shaver! Recomendada 100%. He tenido otras Remington y esta es la mejor que he tenido, la bateria dura bastante.</li>
    <li> My husband really loves this shaver., it gives a close shave, is very comfortable to use and great for travel.</li>
    <li> did not hold a charge bought as a Christmas gift&lt;br /&gt;My son was very disappointed. warranty over before he opened the gift.</li>
    <li> I bought two of these. One for my husband who uses it not only on his face but on his bold head. He has a tough beard and the hair on his head is thick also. This shaver works great for him. He has no complaints whatsoever and truly enjoys it. The other for my son who has sensitive skin and fine hair on his face. This shaver also works great for him and he also has no complaints. These items arrived sooner then I expected. Quick service.</li>
    <li> The shaver mechanically works well; charges quickly and holds a charge for a long time.  However, the supplied shaving heads barely cut anything.  It was not useable as supplied.  I ended up ordering the Remington universal replacement head which worked okay.  See that review.</li>
    <li> I have been using Remington Razors for about 15 years. R-7130 is by far the best.  I have had two earlier models, and even they gave smoother more comfortable shave than the competition.</li>
    <li> This replaced a ten year old Remington, so I was a bit put off by the price, but it works.&lt;br /&gt;First off, could use a stand, that said it does what it should. Gives a nice shave, trimmer works and it really holds a charge. Like most of this style, the head covers are thin flimsy mesh screens, one had a sliver bent inward that stopped the rotor from moving the blades, bent it back and no issues since.</li>
    <li> Is seems to shave well. I actually like it better than the razor I bought at Costco for way over $100. You can get quote a few shaves before you need to recharge &amp; the display with battery time is a plus</li>
    <li> I purchased this &amp;#34;Remington R-7130 Flex 360 LCD Cord/Cordless Rechargeable&amp;#34; for gift to my husband and he LOVES IT! He still using it. :)</li>
    <li> After trying for a couple of weeks, I found it ripped my face to shreds. I returned it. Never again!</li>
    <li> After about  two moths I gave up tore my neck up and not that close of a shave  got a Norelco wet shave. I have always used electric razors I have a medium beard. Not happy with this product  wasted my money.</li>
    <li> Let me say up front, I like to shave with manual razors. I love to shave with manual razors. I&#x27;ve used electric razors in the past and I&#x27;ve never been too happy with them. The Remington Flex 360 is an exception. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few days now, and I&#x27;m very happy with the results. Oh, it still doesn&#x27;t shave as closely as my Fusion, but it gives a very close shave. Best of all, it&#x27;s not at all painful, as I&#x27;ve found electrics to be in the past. The heads and the piece that they&#x27;re mounted on all pivot, independently. It makes it very easy to maintain good contact with the skin without needing to press in real hard. The unit cleaned up well and it charged up easily. One hour of shaving after a full charge means that I will be taking this on business trips since I can throw it in a carry-on, unlike the precious Fusion.</li>
    <li> Here&#x27;s my experience with the Remington Flex 360 Titanium Razor:  First, I have to say I have pretty much never had any success with electric razors - probably more of a personal thing, as the grain of my beard never seemed to be properly handled by anything other than shaving cream and a manual razor, and I tended to get a lot of ingrown hairs when I used electric razors.  So I was interested in trying the floating heads and face-hugging action on the Remington.  Overall, it did a pretty good job, better than others I&#x27;ve tried; however, it did miss a few hairs and I don&#x27;t think I got quite as close a shave as I&#x27;d have gotten using a manual razor, but the shave was acceptable for everyday situations.  If you&#x27;re not used to an electric/rechargeable razor, it takes a bit of getting used to, in order to get your technique down.  After a few days of use, though, I got the hang of doing the circular-motion thing to get the shaving coverage I needed to get a decent shave.  Here are the pros and cons, as I see it, of the Remington:    Pros:  1) Speed - seemed to give me a somewhat faster shave than if I had to do the whole shaving cream and manual razor thing.  This would be a pretty good advantage, if I was somewhat pressed for time.  Once you get your technique down, it&#x27;s a relatively quick shave (maybe like 3 minutes)  2) The &#x60;time left&#x27; indicator is a good feature, letting you know how many minutes of charge are left.  3) The flip-top on the head of the shaver makes it pretty easy to clean - everyday stubble actually comes out as almost fine, dustlike shavings, when I shook the razor out.  4) Convenience - since the shavings pretty much end up inside the flip top, this would probably be a good shaver to keep at the office, or for travel - it gets the job done without making a mess.    Cons:   1) It didn&#x27;t seem to handle my sideburns and moustache area well.  The head of the shaver is somewhat bulky, and isn&#x27;t really useful for handling these areas (at least, not without leaving an uneven shave or potentially shaving parts you don&#x27;t want cut, like around your sideburns).  And I didn&#x27;t think the pop-out trimmer worked too well - it started to fold up on me at one point while I was trying to do my sideburns.   2) The shaver left a few stray hairs that I ended up having to clear out with a manual razor.  While the overall shave was fast, if I had an event/occasion that was really important, requiring a close shave, I&#x27;d probably still go with a cream-and-razor shave.  But for everyday situations, the razor was good.  3) the headpiece seems to be made of light/thin plastic, so I&#x27;m not sure how durable it is.  Also, I unscrewed one of the heads, to clean it out, and had a tough time getting it screwed back into its track.    Overall, I&#x27;d give it a solid 3-star rating - it was more than adequate for an everyday shave, but still not as good as a manual shave, especially if I needed to ensure my shave was completely even and addressed sideburns/moustache.</li>
    <li> We bought this after going on a serious Razor hunt after the battery finally died on my husband&#x27;s old Norelco.  First was the new Norelco Arcitec[...] - this razor cut OK but had this horrible high pitched whine that made my husband&#x27;s ears ring for hours.  Then came another Norelco in the old bodystyle [...] .  We discovered that new Speed XL shaving system doesn&#x27;t work well for him, it just rips his hairs out.  That&#x27;s never happened before.  Fed up with Norelco we decided to try a new brand.  This razor seems to work very well, and very fast.  It&#x27;s at least as good if not better than his older Norelco that we replaced.  My only complaint was that it doesn&#x27;t come with any sort of charging stand, which we really wanted.  I was able to order one here on Amazon for[...].  That was the deciding point between this Remington and the R825.  All else between the 2 seems fairly equal, but the R series does not appear to have a charging stand available for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:&lt;br /&gt;-LCD display w/remaining battery.  Who knew that feature was getting so scarce?&lt;br /&gt;-Good battery life.  We&#x27;re over a month in now and still have over half the battery.  He doesn&#x27;t shave every day.&lt;br /&gt;-Build quality seems OK to fair.  Nothing exciting to report&lt;br /&gt;-Seems to perform same or slightly better than the 6+ yr old Norelco we&#x27;re replacing&lt;br /&gt;-Wish a charging stand and carry case were standard&lt;br /&gt;-Price is excellent for the feature set vs. performance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Update 4/22/2013 - this razor is still going strong, no issues with battery, charging, etc.</li>
    <li> I was replacing a Norelco razor that I liked, but that was getting old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros - Number one by far is great battery life of 60 minutes! Looks good, battery life LED display nice, very comfortable in the hand, easy cleaning process with water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So So - Larger than the Norelco, but not hugely so. Shaves as good as, but not better than the Norelco which is a bit disappointing with all those cool technological touts regarding pivoting heads, titanium blades, teflon coating. LOL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons - Plug blades do not flip recess for travel (minor), no stand (I use the one that came with the Norelco), the pop up shaver flips open and requires two hands or greater dexterity to close than the Norelco that opened and shut with the slide/button one finger action and because the slide/button does not \\&quot;keep\\&quot; it open it is a bit whimpier to use in comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it for a couple of months I used my old Norelco on a whim (battery pretty much dead) and found I loved both the feel/action of the Norelco and the result far better than the Remington and ended up buying a refurbished unit of my old one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the Remington is not a bad razor, it simply does not do as good a job as my old Norelco, nor does it feel as effective while actually shaving so it has been relegated to the draw of no return.</li>
    <li> I have owned this shaver for about a month, and it has performed well. The initial charge lasted more than the expected 20 days, averaging about 3 minutes per shave. When I tried to drain the battery to prep for a full recharge after the time indicated zero, it continued to run for more than 15 minutes. The razor shaves as close or closer than previous ones I have owned. Overall, so far, I am pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought 4 shavers, each of them has slight damage on the back.&lt;br /&gt;All boxes are not broken nor opened. Thus I strongly suspect that these items are not brand new but refurbished.</li>
    <li> Excelente vendedor, la entrega se realizo en el tiempo estipulado y el producto llego en excelentes condiciones, recomendado muy agradecido.</li>
