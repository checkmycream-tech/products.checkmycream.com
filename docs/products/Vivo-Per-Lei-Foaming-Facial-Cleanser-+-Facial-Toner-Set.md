<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love the mildness of the cleanser so I know its not overly stripping my skin of its oils&lt;br /&gt;I was worried when i heard witch hazel was an astringent which drys the skin but this toner leaves my face feeling soft and supple&lt;br /&gt;a great set</li>
    <li> Item was damaged and bottle was broken ..</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good at removing make up, but doesn&#x27;t lather up.</li>
    <li> Vivo Per Lei product is excellent for all.  I Love this mark.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and I will continue to use this products and will re-order.  Thank you for a great product and good customer services.</li>
    <li> Sense I have started using the Milk Cleanser + Facial Toner I really see improvement on my face. I really love them both, and also the day and night cream. My next order I want to order two products for age spots and eye cream. I&#x27;m 60 years old and I wish I had started these products  much sooner.</li>
    <li> Great cleanser for my face and my friends love it.</li>
    <li> Two thumbs up so far!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how small of amt. 2.7 oz is, would like larger bottle. No fragrance, but would like a small amt.</li>
    <li> All the Vivo Per Lei are great</li>
    <li> Im not a big fan of the milk clenser. I followed the directions, but my face felt a bit oily after I used it, so I ended up re-washing my face.  I dont think I will be using that one any more.</li>
    <li> Your face feels so clean and soft</li>
    <li> The facial toner is very good.  I have been using this brand for a few years.  The cleanser is too mild for me, but both have a nice fragrance. The cleanser would be good for someone with very sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I started using these products about a year ago and my skin has never been better.  My friends and family have noticed how even and smooth my skin looks.  I use it along with the day moisturizer, renewing night cream, and facial peeling.  My mother recently started using it because of what it has done for my skin.  The milk cleanser is a wonderful make up remover!</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t clean well, I love other products from the company but was disappointed in this</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feel better than it does when I pay way more for a professional facial.  Highly recommend it</li>
    <li> I love the way these products make my skin look and feel!</li>
    <li> Fragrance free and wonderful consistancy.</li>
    <li> I love these products.</li>
    <li> Excellent products, I used them for a while and I really like the way it feel on my skin. its light, smooth and penetrate fast without been greasy. Highly recommended. Thank you</li>
    <li> I bought it as a gift to a friend whose feedback was good. I think this brand itself has quite impressive products. i&#x27;d like to buy their products again.</li>
    <li> Great product for a great price compare at retail stores. Shipped super fast.</li>
    <li> Awesome.. luxury cream.</li>
    <li> Love it!  I highly recommend these products.</li>
    <li> This line of cosmetic cleansers, toners, lotions, eye creams, etc are my absolute favorite.  I can&#x27;t sleep without the beautiful scent of the night cream!  I&#x27;ve been using these products for 2 years and I am very satisfied..</li>
    <li> After using the milk and cleanser, my skin feel smooth and clean. I will purchase again and recommend the products!</li>
    <li> I tried it and i&#x27;m happy with it, my skin was dry and using this product i can tell that my skin looks softer and the wrinkles somehow diminished, i used this product on the whole face and neck and maybe it&#x27;s mental but i see a change.  i&#x27;m ready to reorder.  This product is great on sensitive  skin.  This is what i do,  clean the face, use the toner, then use a serum,  then use the creams( day or night creams)  I did this in the morning and before going to bed.</li>
    <li> This item is an all around amazing buy! I remember being at the mall and being sold on buying this product for $40+ dollars cause what it did to my skin was amazing!! However, imagine my surprise after finding these products on amazing for MUCH cheaper!!! These Dead Sea products make your skin glow. The smell isn&#x27;t too pleasant, but it isn&#x27;t awful. Just not as fresh smelling as other items.</li>
    <li> Works nice - If you need a soapy feel for a cleanser, this isn&#x27;t for you.  Cleans my skin without stripping all the oils away.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a good face cleaner at a fair price.  This is what I think I have.  Time will tell.  So far so good.  Shipped quick and packaged well.</li>
    <li> Love it!!!  it was in plastic so I know it was new . Great product, makes my skin so soft. Will buy from this seller again!!!</li>
    <li> This is the best facial duo ever.  The milk cleanser is gentle on the skin and does a thorough job of cleaning your skin without stripping the moisture in it.  The toner is like good old fashioned witch hazel.  It too does the trick on tightening the skin after the milk cleanser.  This is a quality product for a very very reasonable price.  I bought this set and shared it with my daughter and daughter in law.  They must start now to keep there skin radiant in their older years. :).</li>
    <li> The cleanser is very thin and does not foam up much. I will say that after washing my face it leaves it feeling very soft. Not much smell to it, if any. I do like products that have a nice scent. Good value though.</li>
    <li> Love it ! Skin is amazing and no blemishes since I have been using it</li>
