      <li>I love the color!</li>
      <li>so you&#x27;ll need to do atleast 3 coats to get a real nice color, but this color stays very well</li>
      <li>it is firmer than the others allowing you to apply very smooth even layers.</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s my favorite spring/summer color.</li>

      <li>It is actually a fun and vibrant color which is great for the spring or summer months.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Didn&#x27;t fit my needs</li>
      <li>Cures in 2 minutes with a 32 watt UV light.</li>
      <li>My 10 year old daughter chose this color which appeared bright on the website.  </li>
      <li>Sephora is my second favorite Gel polish, wish they would offer more colors!</li>
      <li>Thanks! :)</li>
      <li>I am wearing it much more frequently than I had originally anticipated</li>
      <li>It would be a great Summer color that would compliment a dark tan.  </li>
      <li>But for Winter - be prepared for your fingers to be the first thing people notice about you!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been satisfied with every ibd gel I&#x27;ve purchased so far.</li>
      <li>IBD just gel is by far my favorite.</li>
      <li>You can get right up to your cuticle without extra polish globbing up and touching it.</li>
      <li>and I love that IBD sells regular nail polish that matches the gel</li>
      <li>It is more sheer than creamy color</li>
      <li>People are so silly :D</li>
      <li>Definitely recommend, I got many compliments with this color.</li>
      <li>Shipping was fast!</li>
      <li>First time I have tried this brand....</li>
      <li>for nails the tips rub off a bit, not exactly a chip but not as nice as gelish and opi brands.</li>
      <li>and is lasting longer so far of any kind I have tried..... Will be repurchased.</li>
      <li>I like it, but it&#x27;s a bit much for just any day wear.</li>
      <li>/&gt;2 coats covers very well.  </li>
      <li>If you are looking for a neon orange, this is very neon orange.</li>
      <li>Shows off a tan really well.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s very easy to aply and it really is a long lasting and shiny mail polish.&lt;br /&gt;Dont</li>
      <li>But covered decent with two coats.</li>
      <li>Glows in black light.</li>
      <li>Goes on kind of thin, watery.</li>
      <li>The color is a little on the sheer side and required extra coats for full opacity.  </li>
      <li>Polished clumped up and ran all over never buy this product hard to work with its true</li>

<li> definitely a summer or spring color it does glow under blue lights or black loghts.</li>
<li> I use 3 coats of this polish when I want a solid finish, and 2 coats if I want a slightly transparent look.</li>
<li> Having to apply several coats makes the polish thick and then causes it to remove from nail easier and not last as long.</li>
<li> The bad review on this saying it was clumpy obviously didn&#x27;t understand you have to cure this polish with a light.</li>
<li> Infinitely Curious is a creamy neon orange.</li>
<li> Just the way I expected.  </li>
<li> Color was brighter than I expected.</li>
<li> Just Gel applies, wears, and removes as well as other UV/LED gel polish brands.</li>
<li> IBD Gel can be used with led or uv nail dryers and is half the price of other gels.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s about the color of a safety vest that glows in the dark when headlights hit it at night - -</li>
<li> Only thing I wish is that the polish was a little thicker because two thick coats and you can still see your nail a bit under neath.</li>
<li> I have used almost every brand of Gel Polish..drug store brands, Sephora, OPI, Gelish, and Shellac to name a few.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of orange but this color exceeded my expectations.  </li>
<li> Product is very thin.</li>

    <li> Product is very thin. Having to apply several coats makes the polish thick and then causes it to remove from nail easier and not last as long.</li>
    <li> Polished clumped up and ran all over never buy this product hard to work with its true you get what you pay for</li>
    <li> IBD just Gel works great and this is so bright and perfect for tanned toes :) If you are looking for a bright fun color this is for you!!!</li>
    <li> I knew this was going to be bright, but it&#x27;s obnoxiously orange. I like it, but it&#x27;s a bit much for just any day wear. It has a tendency to peal up too.</li>
    <li> My 10 year old daughter chose this color which appeared bright on the website.  The color is even brighter in person.  It is actually a fun and vibrant color which is great for the spring or summer months.  I would recommend for anyone who likes bright colors.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a  preschool teacher, so I have to wash my hands several times, That makes my manicure awful in two days; so I decided to buy this brand of gel nail polish to do it by myself, I&#x27;m very happy beause it&#x27;s very easy to aply and it really is a long lasting and shiny mail polish.&lt;br /&gt;Dont think about it and just buy it!!! I use it with the Royal UV lamp.</li>
    <li> Very bright orange definitely a summer or spring color it does glow under blue lights or black loghts. It is more sheer than creamy color so you&#x27;ll need to do atleast 3 coats to get a real nice color, but this color stays very well I didn&#x27;t chip some of the paint until day 12 and I pick at a lot things(wrappers, cans etc.) Which all can cause chipping and peeling prematurely. Definitely recommend, I got many compliments with this color.</li>
    <li> Love it. Is the same as on the pic. Extremely bright and soo perfect.  Just the way I expected.  If you have doubts listen my advice. :)</li>
    <li> Love the color! Shipping was fast! Would def buy from seller again! Thanks! :)</li>
    <li> Very bright, very cute!</li>
    <li> This color is a bright, bright orange!  It would be a great Summer color that would compliment a dark tan.  But for Winter - be prepared for your fingers to be the first thing people notice about you!  LOL  Say psychedelic orange! It&#x27;s about the color of a safety vest that glows in the dark when headlights hit it at night - - I kid you not!  But I had to give it 5 stars because it is a beautiful color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 coats covers very well.  IBD Gel can be used with led or uv nail dryers and is half the price of other gels.</li>
    <li> SO bright!  I love it!</li>
    <li> Glows in black light. Would be great for ravers. ...&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t fit my needs but I can see using for nail art on my niece&#x27;s</li>
    <li> I used this last night to do my nails and I love it! This color is so bright it glows in the LED machine. I bought it so that when I went go clubs my nails would glow under blacklight. Only thing I wish is that the polish was a little thicker because two thick coats and you can still see your nail a bit under neath. Still a gorgeous color though!!</li>
    <li> This is a great gel polish... First time I have tried this brand.... Great color and is lasting longer so far of any kind I have tried..... Will be repurchased.</li>
    <li> I never heard of this brand but it worked well and I received many complements on the color.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of orange but this color exceeded my expectations.  The color is almost neon and looks great during the warmer months.  I am wearing it much more frequently than I had originally anticipated</li>
    <li> Looks like construction orange. Nice and bright. Tons of compliments. Shows off a tan really well. Product is GREAT!!! Applies well. Cures in 2 minutes with a 32 watt UV light.</li>
    <li> I have used almost every brand of Gel Polish..drug store brands, Sephora, OPI, Gelish, and Shellac to name a few. IBD just gel is by far my favorite.

    <li> Awesome Bright orange. Perfect for Summer</li>
    <li> Infinitely Curious is a creamy neon orange. The color is a little on the sheer side and required extra coats for full opacity.  IBD Just Gel applies, wears, and removes as well as other UV/LED gel polish brands. This is my go-to brand for gel polish and I love that IBD sells regular nail polish that matches the gel colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cured using Salon Edge 36W Nail UV Lamp.</li>
    <li> Color was brighter than I expected.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a neon orange, this is very neon orange. I didn&#x27;t love it on, but it will be a perfect color once Halloween rolls around.</li>
    <li> Great product!  This works just as well for me as the more expensive gel polishes.  I cannot tell any difference in wear when applied properly.</li>
    <li> Goes on kind of thin, watery. But covered decent with two coats. Could probably use a third coat, but wasn&#x27;t necessary! Would recommend this product to others</li>
    <li> for toes, this polish is great. for nails the tips rub off a bit, not exactly a chip but not as nice as gelish and opi brands.</li>
