    <li> These eyeliners are really great. They are pencil, but the color goes on very smoothly. I don&#x27;t have to burn the tip with a lighter, like you often have to with pencils. They are black and have not irritated my skin at all. Overall great quality and great price.</li>
    <li> Nice product...easy to use but only used them for a performance in a school play.  I needed this many for many characters.  So I did not use the pencil personally but my daughter says hers worked good.  I thought it was good quality and a decent price for the 12 pieces...I recommend!</li>
