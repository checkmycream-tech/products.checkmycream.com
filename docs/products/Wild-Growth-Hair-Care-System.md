<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product line for about 3 years now, and I have to say, I really enjoy it. For those who haven&#x27;t seen any difference in it, you have to give it time. Like any hair care product (dealing with growth) you&#x27;re not going to see results instantly. I didn&#x27;t see a difference until about 2 months of usage, and I&#x27;ve got some pretty crazy hair. When I decided to stop using it, other products either broke my face out or were a lot heavier than the wild growth formula. I switched back, and am glad I did. I am currently in the middle of transitioning from relaxed to natural hair, and am very glad I will not have to change hair care products in the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A note to new users:&lt;br /&gt;Wild growth hair oil was originally made for women with coarse or dry hair. It comes down to trial and error with using too much or too little. While I have very dry hair, I use this product 3-4 times a week, while others probably should use it only once every other week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells bad?&lt;br /&gt;I was reading through a few reviews and noticed that many had something to say about the smell of it. Personally, I have never noticed a smell after using it, only when opening the top of the bottle. If you do have an issue, I would suggest adding the oil to a leave-in conditioner that you already like to use. That way you are still using it after you have wet or washed your hair, and the conditioner kind of masks the smell of the oil. Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> I ordered with the intention of growing my hair longer and stronger. Firstly, I believe that the kit is offered at a pretty decent price seeing that the oils are all natural.  My favorite oil out of the two would be the lighter version, hence I use that one everyday just about. The ligh ter version had a faint peppermint smell opposed to the other one, which  honestly....stinks to me. I only use the heavy version for deep treatments, because it smells that bad to me. I would never put the heavy version in my hair to wearoutside. If yelpyou buy this product for the intention of growing your hair long, I&#x27;d say go ahead and purchase it to add in your arsenal....if you follow the exact instructions....which advise you to not use that much....this may be a decent product for you. I however, will only purchase the  lighter version next though; since I am pretty much out of that one. The full strength version....ill have for a long long time.</li>
    <li> This is a excellent product to help promote hair growth. It is really designed for African American and biracial hair textures. It is an oily product. I have just finished chemo treatments and this product is really helping my hair grow back. I used to have very thick hair and used Wild Growth regularly which contributed to my thick long hair. So I started using it again. It is doing wonders for my New Hair.</li>
    <li> I received this product fast.  Plus it was life saver with me being in Iraq it was right on time.  My hair was coming out due to the dry heat and hard water.  But within the week my hair had stop shedding.  I was so happy.  Thank you for the great service.</li>
    <li> Did anyone else purchase this and only recieve the white bottle?! I thought I was ordering both of the oils.</li>
    <li> I thought I was getting the Wild Growth Hair Care System. All I received was (1) bottle of the white container. I was not satisfied. I will go to the neighborhood beauty supply store and make my purchases.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m bi racial. Which means I have a combination of two types of hairs. With this product after using it for almost 2 months it made my hair grow about 3 inches so far. I can feel the new growth from my root of my hair. The only thing is it does smell funny..but I wouldn&#x27;t trade it for anything in the world. It works and I will keep using the product. Just apply a little bit.. Not too much because they your hair is really oily... and can be quite uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> I brought this product because the good reviews I read here in this website. However for my hair type it doesn&#x27;t work at all. I have dry hair and because I leave in Las Vegas (desert) it makes worse. This product is very, very oily and even the light oil is heavy. If you apply just a little after you washed your hair looks like you didn&#x27;t washed for weeks because gives you that limp looking.  Besides that, I have been using it for about a month and didn&#x27;t notice any difference in the growth of my hair. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product off and on for maybe 5-6 yrs. With continued use it helped strengthen my hair, have more bounce and life. I must admit it does have a slight smell that not too appealing but it wears off.</li>
    <li> I love wild growth and I recommend the product to other woman with hair problems. My hair was breaking in the back due to sweater and  turtlenecks, my beautian told me about the product and I purchase it about a month ago. I use the product three times aweek and I see the results from using this product. I had new growth after three weeks but a deep conditioner help me from getting a relaxer. The only  negative thing I have to mention about the product is the smell. The smell is strong, due to olive oil and other oils combine and I think you should use it at night.</li>
    <li> I loved this product, it was what I wanted and it was also much cheaper buying through amazon then getting it at stores, only except the shipping cost was a little pricey, This product I have been using for over 2 months now because over the summer I suffer from dry scalp, so  I mix this product with EMU Oil or (Isoplus-Oil Moisturizer). Its pure oil which helps moisturize the scalp.  I also use as a hot-oil treatment. During the summer I wear braids and I noticed that my hair grew 1 inch long wearing braids.  I had to take my hair down because my hair grew within a matter of 2 months. It works.</li>
    <li> This is a great product I have used it several years and it is a great product you can use it as a hot oil treatment I would highly recommend this product and it is also for braids.</li>
    <li> the bottle that makes your hair straighter really does work! i havent been using the product long enough to notice growth but i have my fingers crossed! the smell isnt so bad.. smells like tea tree oil, which is a fine smell to me. but i have mixed it with a little bit of leave in conditioner and you cant smell it after that</li>
    <li> Just looking at the ingredients on the side of the bottle, I would have never thought that it would make my hair feel as nice as it does.  Mind you, you can&#x27;t just throw it in willy-nilly  and expect your hair to grow a foot overnight.  I have to moisten my hair a little bit with a mixture of glycerin, aloe, and water, then apply the Wild Hair Growth to my scalp and rub it in.  I have to take my time and apply it evenly and with care, or else I risk putting too much and it can build up really easily.  If I&#x27;m in a rush I just put in the light version and keep going.  I&#x27;ve been natural for more than a year and this product does assist in strengthening and softening the hair.  Even my sister who has likened my hair to steel wool, noticed that my hair is much softer than it was before.  I also noticed that it seemed like my hair grew faster, but I can&#x27;t really say because I wasn&#x27;t measuring.  All I know is that before using it, I grabbed a hair from my crown and tried to put it in my mouth (don&#x27;t judge me!), it didn&#x27;t reach.  I used this product for perhaps almost a month, and it reached with ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people say that the product has a gross smell.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a huge deal; it&#x27;s like a...herbal smell, and it seems to dissipate well enough (or I think it does), and no one looks at me odd when I use it, so I&#x27;ll deal with it.  It&#x27;s not as if it smells like sewage or anything!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is amazing, but you have to give yourself and your hair the time and patience to work it though your scalp, and be sure to not use too much.  If your hair is kinkier (which mine is), you can get away with using more, but you can still put too much, and that&#x27;s no good.</li>
    <li> I use this oil three times weekly, twice when I go swimmin under my swimming cap and over night once a week, and I dont wash it completly off, I mean I clean my scalp thoroughly but leave some traces of it at the end of my hair, I noticed it make my hair softer and easier to manage which and it also smells nice :)</li>
    <li> Wild growth hair products work well to maintain think ethnic hair. This product made my think wavy hair manageable, straighter and sickly without the need of a blow dryer or flat iron. I follow the directions on the bottle, then wrap my hair around my head or in a bun and place a hair scarf on my head before bed.</li>
    <li> I always use this product to make my 4C hair manageable. I use the moisturizer daily and the oil weekly, so i want get a lot of build up</li>
    <li> The first time I bought the twins they weren&#x27;t in a package. Now they are in a nicely boxed package. I keep buying Wild Growth because it really makes my hair grow. Persons are surprised by the growth spurts and are asking where it can be purchased. I like to buy it before the current bottles go empty.</li>
    <li> I love this Oil, I&#x27;ve been using it for a year now and I can see great results with my hair. I had bold spots that are feeling in after using this care system. I have also been eating a healthy diet &amp; taking my vitamins too. Looking forward to ordering more once this bottles run out!</li>
    <li> This stuff smells horrible, and made my hair break off extremely easy. I did not notice any significant hair growth after a month of using this product. I have 4c natural hair  and it weighed my hair down making it extremely fragile.</li>
    <li> Hello everyone, my name is Marilyn Smith, I live in the Bahamas. I have been using this product now for the past 5 years. I am really amazed where wild growth has taken my hair. It is unbelievable. My hail is so long, lustrous, soft and simply beautiful. So many people admire my hair. My hair really was never this long and beautiful. I advise them of where to buy the product. I do not just apply the product 2-3 times per week, but I also message my scalp moderately when I oil it. I love this oil because in delivers and has exceeded my expectations. Try it!</li>
    <li> Really havent used it much but it is extra greasy and smell isnt the best,not sure bout rapid hair growth havent seen it</li>
    <li> Ive only been using this product for about 2 weeks now I havent seen any growth yet cause I have braids which ill be taking out within the next two or three weeks but other than that it does moisturize my scalp and it doesnt dry it out. Another thing about this product is the smell isnt that great but I can deal with it but I dont think other people can it smell like cinnamon and ginger, people would be like what is that smell</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t believe in miracle but I was hoping this product would prove me wrong. It may works for other but has not done anything particular for me. At one point after use I was noticed small bumps on my scalp. I will give to my daughter and hope she has good use for it. Not for me</li>
    <li> i just recieved my oils today and first of all the smell is not bad at all!!! i cant believe all the people who made such a big deal about the smell...it smells a little like medicine but nothing stinky, loud or bad. anyway i will try to remember to update this review in about a month, i am really determined to grow my hair so i will let you guys know how this stuff is working for me...but i like it so far staying positive!!!</li>
    <li> This oil has made my hair grow. After about 3 months of using this oil on my scalp every other day (and taking daily vitamins including Biotin), I started to notice some growth. This was very helpful since my hair started thinning after I had my baby. I have been using these oils for 6+ months now and I&#x27;m very pleased. The oil in the white bottle is kinda thick so beware of build up in your hair. Be sure to do some clarifying every few weeks or so.</li>
    <li> Oil is to heavy and thick to leave on hair for more than 1-2 days. Does not have a \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; smell as advertised. Just another rip-off product targeting the many who suffer from thinning hair due to health or genetic factors.</li>
    <li> The absolute only reason im giving this product 3 stars right now is because I havent seen progress yet. 3 stars is still good in my eyes. It gave my hair a great soft feeling and made my scalp tingle which gave me the reassurance that the product is working. Of course no progress yet but I will surely update for the women looking to grow longer stronger hair.</li>
    <li> works wonders been using this item for a long time and i love it !!!</li>
    <li> wild growth is wonderful i&#x27;ve been using this stuff for over two years and my hair is shoulder length.this is my first time using the two oils together. i love it and i will keep using.</li>
    <li> Today is my first time using it.....and I love it.....I was looking for a product that would make my hair grow super fast and healthier!! my hair looks like its a 1000 times healthier after just this one use.....The only thing is it makes my hair look a little oily but I think I used to much.....The smell is not even noticeable I don&#x27;t know why everybody complains so much about it!!! SO far this product is amazing to me.....Just order it....</li>
    <li> I used it for 120 days and no new hair grew in the areas I was putting it on - What a waste of money - I wrote to&lt;br /&gt;company that made it and told them how unhappy I was but never heard anything back from them - I guess I am&lt;br /&gt;a sucker for trying various products that claim to regrow new hair and make you hair fuller and thicker. Well, this&lt;br /&gt;is more money down the drain on products that claim to regrow hair thicker and fuller in areas that were very thin&lt;br /&gt;or balding spots -</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. The price is great I use it every other day and I love that it&#x27;s all natural. If the event is an issue I always mix it with pure shea  butter, with lavender oil. But the smell doesn&#x27;t last long if used alone. Either way I love the stuff.</li>
    <li> Takes about a month before you see results. Does not help thinning edges</li>
    <li> The package got here right on time and although the book was missing, I still give it four stars. I read that the scent was terrible but I like it, it kind of smells like nutmeg. It does all that it says it would do but its too early for growth results. Will update after I&#x27;ve used it for longer.</li>
    <li> love the moisturizing product what not to fond of  smell</li>
    <li> the smell isn&#x27;t as bad as everyone makes it seem. I had to stop using it because the it made my scalp itch so bad. I only use it on my hair now and not on my scalp. but what doesn&#x27;t work for me may work for you.</li>
    <li> Loved it, will be using it more.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It was shipped on time and packaged good. So the wild growth hair care system made my hair grow wild!  Literally!!! I had hair thinning out on my hairline and wild growth has made it look thicker, longer and healthier! I will order in the future when I start running slow.  It&#x27;s that good!</li>
    <li> I am now on my second bottle (yellow one) I mainly use it at night before bedtime because of the scent, But it is working where my hair was thinning . I plan to order more</li>
    <li> I bought this a couple of days ago and I got it super quick! The smell is noooot as bad as people say. Its a very herbal smell, I said it kind of smelled like bubble gum. I&#x27;m a white female and I slept with it in my hair, I washed it twice like people said and styled it as normal but my hair was still oily. It wasn&#x27;t oily as in looked terrible, but I could tell. It was very soft and smooth though!! I hope it grows since this is my first use, I&#x27;m excited! I&#x27;d definitely get it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this in combination with the fast growth shampoo and conditioner. I&#x27;ve only been using them for about 2 weeks and I&#x27;ve already seen growth. My hair was horribly damaged from several things. I started wearing extensions for a while because I was convinced that my hair was just screwed. After reading reviews I decided to take out my extensions and give it a go. I do use these oils at night. My hair is very thin and brittle and they do make it look very oily. Which is why I use them at night, then use the shampoo in the mornings. My hair is still very dry, but I&#x27;m hoping after time that will work itself out. After 2 weeks of use I already have some growth, and I&#x27;m also seeing about 75% less breakage. My hair isn&#x27;t shedding throughout the day anymore. The only time I see any shedding at all now is when I do brush it.</li>
    <li> The other reviews scared me... But my hairs been falling out something terrible so I had to get it anyway...&lt;br /&gt;It just smells like tea tree oil, or your essential oils. most products today smell like that anyway&lt;br /&gt;I actually enjoy the tea tree oil smell, it&#x27;s a good product for dry hair,&lt;br /&gt;This is my first day of using so I don&#x27;t know about long lasting results yet, but it did hydrate my dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;And it doesn&#x27;t smell.. Plus u wana put it in at night, wrap ur hair up, and wash it out in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE&lt;br /&gt;I have never had an allergic reaction to anything in my life, nor have I ever had this problem...&lt;br /&gt;After the second time of using this after a shower, I used it to detangle and treat my scalp&lt;br /&gt;I have broken out in a bad painfull burning rash in a few patches on my scalp....this product is to Blaim, if anyone else has had this problem plz comment below</li>
    <li> i have to order some more great results in a short period of time worth it&lt;br /&gt;10 stars if i could</li>
    <li> My hair had been shedding alot and broke of back in 2004 my mom had brought a bottle and this was when the bottle came BIGGER. she would part my hair and put it on my scalp every night what i can believe is i started using it in  august 2004 ( i was  15 ) by like  like December 2005 my hair was really long seriously i can remmber cuz 2005 was the first time i met my ex and my hair was longggg back then. i am starting to use this again cuz my hair is short and was damaged im gonna give it a try again ! but they say when u are young your hair is still growing i dont know if it was that or this stuff but my hair grewwwwwwwwwwwww if my hair doesnt grow this time im conviced my hair has stop growin or i have cancer or something cuz my hair is much thinner now smfh</li>
    <li> I ordered the Wild Growth Hair care system but when I opened my package I discovered that I only received the White bottle of hair oil. I did not get the yellow bottle of oil or the book. Im very disappointed. I would appreciate for the company to contact me if they see this. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Its great! Made my hair so soft n nice and healthy  looking. Has a shine and has a nice bounce.  My hair also has been growing&lt;br /&gt; I give it 4stars!!</li>
    <li> Been using this product for 2 years. This product  has help with thickening and growing my hair. I&#x27;ve  been natural for 2 yrs and this is my go to product when it comes to oils i favor</li>
    <li> I mix them both, same quantities and I add pure Jojoba oil to lighten the mix and also because I love jojoba oil on my hair. I get fabulous results: softness, moisture, shine, minus the smell of the green bottled one because the yellow bottle is actually meant to deodorize the hair.&lt;br /&gt;I use it  generously (well just six, seven drops) every evening on my hair and scalp before two strands twists, I use a little in the morning when I undo them and fluff them out. Little goes a long way and it&#x27;s already not expensive.&lt;br /&gt;I just LOVE my hair: Bouncy, healthy, thick, natural black 4a type!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so in love with this product, I am planning on using it as long as they make it. Over time, you hair gets softer and softer when using this mix of both oil. I remember there was a time my hair was so dry I noticed the skin on my fingers peeled from doing two strand twists. I check my hair from time to time, especially my ends and I see no split ends ( although I blow dry my natural hair one a week with medium heat), no porosity problem  either ( tip: you can check porosity by dropping a hair strand in a glass of water and if it floats, you&#x27;re OK:)). I truly encourage you to try the mix:)</li>
    <li> Got My order in a timely matter.  I just ran out of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a week now and I do see a difference.  It is oily if you use a lot of it and the smell takes a bit getting use to but it is a good product.</li>
    <li> The smell is a very strong pine smell when you first put it on (I could have dealt with that).  But after a day or two, your hair has a very foul odor.  Like you have not washed it in about 3 or 4 months (maybe longer).  The smell is very bad!!!  I can&#x27;t walk around like that! It did make my hair soft and manageable.  but that still was not enough to keep me using it.  I tried it when I first got it.  After the first two days the bad odor came, so I washed and clarified my hair.  Waited a week and try it again.  SAME THING HAPPEN!!! I couldn&#x27;t get this stuff out my hair fast enough.  It&#x27;s not for me, I will not walk around stinking. :(</li>
    <li> My hair has shown growth and is consistently oiled and moisturized-I keep my hair cut short and this system is great for keeping my hair healthy looking</li>
    <li> I did the big chop in March 2012. This oil has been a significant part of my hair growth regiment. I&#x27;m telling you girlfriend just buy it lol! It smells like something our grandmothers would have cooked up in a southern kitchen, bit I&#x27;m game for anything that works!</li>
    <li> Make hair dull, sticky is the worst product that I buy for my curly hair. I will not recommend this product to no one.</li>
    <li> I have healthy 3C4A hair. I just needed to comment on this oil! This oil was used by my mother when I was growing up in two countries! Every time I see it I think of her and my childhood in the 90s. She hasn&#x27;t used it since then, so I haven&#x27;t seen it in more than a decade. Imagine my surprise when I see it on the shelves at Sally Beauty! I knew I had to get some and try it out right away. It&#x27;s just too classic to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff smells very herbally and minty, and I love it! I don&#x27;t have a problem at all with the scent. It&#x27;s very relaxing. The relaxing part may be because of the memories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this all over my scalp after washing, conditioning, and detangling. I also put a TINY extra on hair/ends. It is too thick for my ends, though. This product is best for scalp, not as a prepoo or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is thick, but not as viscous as jamaican black castor oil. It is the viscosity of olive oil. It&#x27;s dark orange in color. Very easy to spread. I only used a small thin line of oil on the tip of my finger and smoothed it on my scalp while parting my hair all over. Then I massaged it all in gently. I flat twisted my hair down and tied it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I really like it because the next day my hair was soft and appeared healthy with a nice sheen/shine to it. By night time, my scalp and hair really \\&quot;drank\\&quot; all the oil, so I applied some of the Wild Growth Oil Light Moisturizer (yellow bottle) to the scalp. For my flat twists I used BRX Braid Spray (amazing stuff too). I think this is a good regimen for me in braided styles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No reports for \\&quot;advanced growth\\&quot;. My hair grows pretty fast naturally thanks to genetics. I wanted something to keep my scalp and hair lubricated, that doesn&#x27;t just \\&quot;sit\\&quot;, to help avoid those annoying single strand knots!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really surprised my scalp and hair just soak up this stuff, since my hair is very picky and doesn&#x27;t like oils that much. I see why my mother used it on me growing up. I hope this review helps!his review helps!</li>
    <li> Even when I only use a little bit!  It has a slightly mint/unpleasant odor, and it the green/white bottle is very thick and viscous for hair oil.  I like the ingredients and chose to use it at night every couple of days, because I have to wash it out in the am.  Otherwise my hair looks oily and unkept.  It&#x27;s been about 4 weeks and I haven&#x27;t noticed any additional hair growth :  (&lt;br /&gt;Will continue to use it longer, but not happy with results so far.</li>
    <li> it very heavy but it gives your hair a great feel ..just wash your hair every week thou.. im gonna give it 3 more months to really see what it can really do. so far i have notice some thickness in places where there was some thinning going on..hummm we&#x27;ll see. but it shipped on time and product was sealed and in tact.</li>
    <li> not greasy, very light on the hair.</li>
    <li> Well it didn&#x27;t do any magical growing of my hair...you can&#x27;t leave it in for too long..it&#x27;ll give you this horrible funk on top of your head...I am finding it really useful as a pre wash product...slap an old bleached out towel around me &amp; faded shirt..saturate my hair with it &amp; using hair mayonnaise with some profectiv as a hair mask of sorts..it&#x27;s made my tresses quite soft..been using it since March/April no big changes in my hair length or thickness..it&#x27;s just nice to use but beware as I have serve allergies this product is NOT HYPOALLERGENIC!...don&#x27;t experience allergic reactions to it but others definitely can...Well that&#x27;s my 2 cents...</li>
    <li> This did nothing for me. The order is not bad at all. Will not order again.</li>
    <li> I love this product, works fast and is not super thick or oily. Read ALL instructions before using. Be careful not to use too much (trust me you wont need too). Im on my 2nd set and will order again once im out.&lt;br /&gt;It did make my scalp a bit sensitive so only apply about 3to 4days a week.</li>
    <li> It works.  This stuff grows hair and continues to thicken the COMPLETE BALD SPOT I had before...most products only claim to do what this one ACTUALLY DOES!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I am not sure if you hair will grow any longer because of its use, because I have lengthy hair already.  However, I love how your scalp feel afterwards.  To some the smell is standoffish, however, for me it ok.  I love this product and will keep purchasing it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since 2010 on and off, it has a strong odor but works well. It&#x27;s pretty oily and may require for you to wash your hair more because of the thickness of the oil. However it does make your hair grow longer, faster if you combine it with Allure Fast Grow Vitamins. I wear a sew in weave and oil my hair with it every other day along with Liquid Gold Hair Oil. If you want your hair to grow fast use this product,Liquid Gold Hair Oil, Allure Fast Grow Hair Vitamins, Flax seed oil pills, and omega oils pills. You can also take biotin 5000mg with prenatal vitamins. I know it sounds like a lot to take but using oil alone will not grow out your hair healthy and long or keep it from breaking off. I&#x27;ve tried every product and the ones I&#x27;ve listed above will work! I guarantee it.</li>
    <li> Was losing my hair. Have used this treatment for 6 months and hair is thicker and shiny. I use the full treatment .</li>
    <li> Love it . Been using this for years works wonders. Makes your hair soft and if you have thinning hair or bold spot will help make your hair grow.</li>
    <li> I just got this stuff and used it for the first time yesterday. Now I&#x27;d be more than happy if I get &amp;#34;wild growth&amp;#34; within 2 months as the directions suggest, but what its done so far is amazing!! I have 3c/4a/4b that means curly/kinky, hard to manage and frizzy. After I washed and DC my hair as per my usual regimen I applied as directed, 80 drops, 20 to each section, then I parted small sections and greased my scalp then brushed through with my denman brush. My hair did things I  didn&#x27;t know it could, it was soft, manageable, totally moisturized, absolutely no frizz and my styling process was easier because of less hassels. I will definately continue to use this, and add it to my regimen.  I will also check the length in 2 months to confirm the claims, but so far very satisfied.</li>
    <li> This really works...  has an odor but it works</li>
    <li> The smell is actually not bad, but I&#x27;ve been using for about 3 weeks now and no results. It&#x27;s not like I put it on everyday or anything but no new growth or anything yet.  Also, it kinda makes the scalp itch</li>
    <li> The smell was bad my hair started to fall out never again</li>
    <li> IT DOES AS IT SAYS. AM AFR AMERICAN N HAVE RELAXED HAIR. IT MAKES MY NEW GROWTH EASIER TO MANAGE AND I STAYED 7 WEEKS BEFORE I RELAXED MY HAIR AGAIN. HOPEFULLY THIS TIME IT HELPS ME TO ACHIEVE THE 8 WEEKS FOR THE NEXT TOUCH UP WHILE HAVING ... WILD GROWTH</li>
    <li> Nothing grow wild using this.;{</li>
    <li> perhaps i haven&#x27;t used it long enought, only three weeks but i&#x27;ve seen no difference in the amount  of hair I&#x27;m losing. the smell does take some time to get used to as it smells like food grease. I&#x27;ll try it for an additional month but im not holding my breath.</li>
    <li> I have not been consistent in recent years as I am a product junkie and am constantly plundering my way through massive amounts of products. HOWEVER, the first time I used this was during the summer. Within ONE MONTH my hair had grown enough that other people who knew me stopped and noticed. I would estimate that in that entire 3 month timespan my hair grew 3-4 inches.&lt;br /&gt;It is an amazing product. Might take some getting used to but I will definitely revist.</li>
    <li> Dont,t  like the smell got no results and will not use this product agian . I think it was a waste of time</li>
</ol>
