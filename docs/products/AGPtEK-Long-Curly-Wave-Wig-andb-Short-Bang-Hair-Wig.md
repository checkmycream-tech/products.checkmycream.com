      <li>This wig is amazing!</li>
      <li>It feels nice and lays well too!</li>
      <li>I give them two stars just because it got delivered within 4 days and arrived in good condition.</li>

      <li>My daughter loved this item.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
      <li>won&#x27;t buy this kind of hair anymore....</li>
      <li>Looks nice for it&#x27;s price.</li>
      <li>Nice, inexpensive wig.</li>
      <li>I love this brand of wigs.</li>
      <li>Was better than I could have imagined.</li>
      <li>looks fantastic!</li>
      <li>Love it and use it to cosplay Mikasa and Toudou Jinpachi.</li>
      <li>I bought it for my mannequin, it was a nice fit.  </li>
      <li>That is okay</li>
      <li>This is my very first wig and I love it!</li>
      <li>Over all great natural look and very comfortable.</li>
      <li>Fit is strangely big but otherwise great.</li>
      <li>But it just barely fit, so that was a plus.</li>
      <li>It even comes with a free head cap.</li>
      <li>Hair is cheap as price</li>
      <li>It will fit a child&#x27;s head,</li>
      <li>Fabulous for the price.</li>
      <li>the end of the day, I love it and despite what I&#x27;ve mentioned above, it is a good wig for the price.</li>
      <li>love the color very well made.</li>
      <li>So many people thought it was my real hair...</li>
      <li>It has this very soft, buttery texture and is very easy to style.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a pretty wig!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never worn such  a lovely, well made and Imported!</li>
      <li>super soft and was able to brush it without it splitting or going frizzy.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
      <li>It is was so much fun to wear it.</li>
      <li>Although the wig is beautiful I ended up having to give it to my kids as a play wig because it was way to small for my head...</li>
      <li>I would have given it a 5/5 stars IF the wig I received matched the one shown in the picture exactly.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>I was able to use hairspray to keep them back.</li>
      <li>Also, it falls all over my face and just to be able to see, I had to clip it back on both sides.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have a large head, so I was expecting to struggle with the size.</li>
      <li>The wig is super soft and didn&#x27;t shead too much.</li>
      <li>So kudos for realistic looking synthetic hair!</li>
      <li>It ended up not working for what I bought it for, but I can&#x27;t complain since the price really does reflect the quality.</li>
      <li>I was still happy with it because I was going to cut the bangs similarly anyways, but it&#x27;s strange that it&#x27;s not the same as the picture</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s much longer than it looks in the pictures, and also has full bangs that are too short to be tucked to the sides like the model has done.</li>
      <li>The hair is super soft and looks natural.</li>
      <li>so if you brush the bangs to the side like in the picture, you have to make sure to tame the shorter hairs underneath, but I don&#x27;t imagine it&#x27;ll be too much of an issue.</li>
      <li>I love how it looks, but it was a bit tight on my head.</li>
      <li>I highly  recommend this company&#x27;s wigs.</li>
      <li>As pictured and soft!</li>
      <li>It is somewhat shiny but nothing that can&#x27;t be easily fixed.</li>
      <li>I put it on and my family thought I just got my natural hair cut and style.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so soft to the touch.</li>
      <li>I have an extra large head and very thick natural African American hair, and it fits nicely!</li>
      <li>Easy to style and very soft and slow to tangle.</li>
      <li>for quality, I&#x27;ve had a couple of pieces fall out when I handled it a bit roughly when I first got it.</li>
      <li>It did shine a dark brown, but it was for sure black.</li>
      <li>It has sort of an odd super short layer at the front (underneath the longer layer)</li>
      <li>I was not able to fit it over my flat hair bun (in a wig cap) at the nape of my neck, but the wig hair in the back covered it</li>
      <li>However, the wig I received actually has short swept bangs that fall right at the eyebrow level - give or take a few.</li>

<li> /&gt;It does have a couple redeeming qualities, so I would try to work with that.&lt;br /&gt;But, over all this wig was a disappointment.</li>
<li> The bangs are really long</li>
<li> Will totally use this seller for other wigs.</li>
<li> only for tiny small head like kid&#x27;s size.</li>
<li> I can&#x27;t return it because I cut the bangs across and spent a while trying to make it work</li>
<li> The front is a little long and comes in my face, but with a Bobby pin it took care of that.</li>
<li> When I finally put it on it was way too small for my head.  </li>
<li> A little shiny, sheds a lot.</li>
<li> so I cut them a little.</li>
<li> It is so round and has a ton of layers.</li>
<li> Not the type to write bad reviews, but seeing this was supposed to be my moms first ever wig</li>
<li> I was planning on just cutting the bangs and being Mia Wallace from Pulp Fiction because no other wigs on amazon would come before halloween.</li>
<li> Weirdly shaped strange wig.</li>
<li> The wig was hard to place on my head.  </li>
<li> This wig was tiny and as a result awkward.</li>
<li> Shipment arrived late.</li>
<li> Also, the front where the &amp;#34;bangs&amp;#34; part has these weird short hairs that look well, weird.</li>
<li> But just about everything else was a disappointment.  </li>
<li> A real disappointment</li>
<li> it was horrible!</li>

    <li> The wig looked nothing like it does in the picture. It is so round and has a ton of layers. I was planning on just cutting the bangs and being Mia Wallace from Pulp Fiction because no other wigs on amazon would come before halloween. I give them two stars just because it got delivered within 4 days and arrived in good condition. It&#x27;s just not the wig I ordered. I can&#x27;t return it because I cut the bangs across and spent a while trying to make it work but it is still way to chunky and poofy. If it was the wig in the picture it would have worked.</li>
    <li> Was better than I could have imagined. So many people thought it was my real hair... super soft and was able to brush it without it splitting or going frizzy. Fabulous for the price. Will totally use this seller for other wigs.</li>
    <li> Its okei,do the job!!</li>
    <li> I have a large head, so I was expecting to struggle with the size. But it just barely fit, so that was a plus. Although, it may be 12in in the front, but the back of the wig is wicked short. Also, the front where the &amp;#34;bangs&amp;#34; part has these weird short hairs that look well, weird. I was able to use hairspray to keep them back. The wig is super soft and didn&#x27;t shead too much. And it didn&#x27;t come all dented either, it arrived very nicely shaped and hasn&#x27;t lost its shape either. Everyone thought I had actually cut and dyed my hair. So kudos for realistic looking synthetic hair! It did shine a dark brown, but it was for sure black. Definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> This is my very first wig and I love it! I put it on and my family thought I just got my natural hair cut and style. The hair is super soft and looks natural. The back is kinda shorter then I would though. That is okay it still looks good. The front is a little long and comes in my face, but with a Bobby pin it took care of that. I will definitely buy another one. Great wig for the price!</li>
    <li> Weirdly shaped strange wig. The back closure sticks waaaay out! Not the type to write bad reviews, but seeing this was supposed to be my moms first ever wig it was horrible!</li>
    <li> love the color very well made. looks and fits great. im very happy with my purchase</li>
    <li> Nice, inexpensive wig.</li>
    <li> Fit is strangely big but otherwise great. It is somewhat shiny but nothing that can&#x27;t be easily fixed. Over all great natural look and very comfortable.</li>
    <li> I love this brand of wigs. It&#x27;s so soft to the touch. Feels, looks, and has body just like human hair. It even comes with a free head cap. I&#x27;ve never worn such  a lovely, well made and Imported! wig for such a low price. I highly  recommend this company&#x27;s wigs. Thanks! Amazon.com</li>
    <li> Best wig I&#x27;ve ever owned. Easy to style and very soft and slow to tangle. Will be buying again. Love it and use it to cosplay Mikasa and Toudou Jinpachi.</li>
    <li> Perfect for Nana Cosplay!</li>
    <li> Looks nice for it&#x27;s price. A little shiny, sheds a lot. The bangs are really long so I cut them a little.</li>
    <li> This wig is amazing! It feels nice and lays well too! It is was so much fun to wear it. I used it for my Halloween Costume since I have long blonde hair and I went as a silent film star.</li>
    <li> Really great wig for the price! It has sort of an odd super short layer at the front (underneath the longer layer) so if you brush the bangs to the side like in the picture, you have to make sure to tame the shorter hairs underneath, but I don&#x27;t imagine it&#x27;ll be too much of an issue. Very cute and comfy!</li>
    <li> looks fantastic! I used it for Kanaya Maryam cosplay and it is bEAUTIFUL</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a pretty wig! I bought it for my mannequin, it was a nice fit.  Trendy style!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s much longer than it looks in the pictures, and also has full bangs that are too short to be tucked to the sides like the model has done. It sheds like hell, too. I guess you get what you&#x27;re paying for. It ended up not working for what I bought it for, but I can&#x27;t complain since the price really does reflect the quality.</li>
    <li> only for tiny small head like kid&#x27;s size. doesnt go with me at all.</li>
    <li> won&#x27;t buy this kind of hair anymore.... Hair is cheap as price</li>
    <li> Beautiful wig! I just received it today, and I must say that I&#x27;m very impressed. It has this very soft, buttery texture and is very easy to style. I have an extra large head and very thick natural African American hair, and it fits nicely! I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> Good quality. Shipment arrived late.</li>
    <li> This wig was tiny and as a result awkward. A real disappointment</li>
    <li> Although the wig is beautiful I ended up having to give it to my kids as a play wig because it was way to small for my head...</li>
    <li> My daughter loved this item.</li>
    <li> I received the wig in a timely fashion.  It arrived neat and orderly.  But just about everything else was a disappointment.  The wig was hard to place on my head.  When I finally put it on it was way too small for my head.  It will fit a child&#x27;s head,c it seems.  A piece of hair fell out even before I got it on my head.  The hair is too shiny.  It just does not look real.&lt;br /&gt;I was so looking forward to this wig.  I chose it because it had a four star rating.  But I would only give it one star.  Also, it falls all over my face and just to be able to see, I had to clip it back on both sides.&lt;br /&gt;It does have a couple redeeming qualities, so I would try to work with that.&lt;br /&gt;But, over all this wig was a disappointment.</li>
    <li> For the price, I think the wig is great! I would have given it a 5/5 stars IF the wig I received matched the one shown in the picture exactly. In the pictures, her short hair/bob is shown to have chin-length bangs. However, the wig I received actually has short swept bangs that fall right at the eyebrow level - give or take a few. I was still happy with it because I was going to cut the bangs similarly anyways, but it&#x27;s strange that it&#x27;s not the same as the picture shown.&lt;br /&gt;As for quality, I&#x27;ve had a couple of pieces fall out when I handled it a bit roughly when I first got it. I wore it for a day with a costume though and did not have any problems with hair falling out. I love how it looks, but it was a bit tight on my head. I&#x27;m not sure if this is due to my long hair that it had to fit over or because I&#x27;m a noobie to wigs and may not have put it on properly. I was not able to fit it over my flat hair bun (in a wig cap) at the nape of my neck, but the wig hair in the back covered it fine.&lt;br /&gt;At the end of the day, I love it and despite what I&#x27;ve mentioned above, it is a good wig for the price.</li>
    <li> As pictured and soft!</li>
