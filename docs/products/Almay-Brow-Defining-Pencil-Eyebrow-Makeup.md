      <li>One of my all time favorite brow pencils.</li>
      <li>I have tried so many over the years</li>
      <li>discontinued in most stores.  </li>
      <li>Like all almay&#x27;s products has a great quality, don&#x27;t hurt your skin and have a very affordable price this is my favorite brow defining</li>
      <li>I feel like it would work for many brown/brunette colors.</li>
      <li>I just bought 4 more just in case.</li>
      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>Best one I could find at a regular drug store.</li>
      <li>I suffer from trichotillomania which means most of the time, I don&#x27;t have eyebrows.</li>
      <li>I have used the Almay Brow Defining Pencil for many years...</li>
      <li>so I have used many brow pencils &amp; tried many brands.</li>
      <li>Love this eyebrow pencil.</li>
      <li>Although the brow wiz one is denser and better imo&lt;</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very good product except that it breaks very easily other than that a good purchase.</li>
      <li>the brush on the end is great for brushing your eyebrows before you fill them in as well as blending the pencil into brows to complete the look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
      <li>I love this brow pencil and the brow brush is the primary reason I use it.  </li>
      <li>Wow, this is a great brow pencil.</li>
      <li>but it broke rather easily in my bag.</li>
      <li>Also, the spoolie on this product is easily detatched.  </li>
      <li>I find the stick comes apart quite easily though.</li>
      <li>Easy to apply.  </li>
      <li>so far good i really love this product .</li>
      <li>Perfect brown color and the pencil goes on smooth and easy to make little brush marks.  </li>
      <li>goes on smoothly and with my oily skin it still stays put all day into the night.</li>
      <li>Looking at me, most people wouldn&#x27;t notice this right away, instead they sort of sense a &amp;#34;wrongness&amp;#34; about my face that they just can&#x27;t put their finger on.</li>
      <li>I have been searching for a dupe for my beloved Anastasia Brow Wiz and this pretty much fits the bill.</li>
      <li>When I use this pencil I can create the illusion of fine hairs as well as fill in areas for full coverage.</li>
      <li>My new favorite eyebrow pencil!</li>
      <li>I can usually find great prices too!</li>
      <li>So much better than some higher name brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>Love it and love Almay products in general.</li>
      <li>I love it so much</li>
      <li>I wish there were more color options available, but it is 1/5 the price of a similar product by Anastasia which does have more color options.  </li>
      <li>, I&#x27;m 77 years old, fills in nicely.  </li>
      <li>These are my favorite pencils... so easy to use and looks natural.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried about every eyebrow pencil on the market and this one has so far been the best in terms of creating realistic looking natural eyebrows.</li>
      <li>My favorite by far.</li>
      <li>Always come back to it &amp; so glad it&#x27;s available for auto shipping at the frequency I need</li>
      <li>I get quick, consistent results using this pencil</li>
      <li>and I couldn&#x27;t get the right color and quality combo.</li>
      <li>This is easy to apply and looks very natural.  </li>
      <li>The pencil is super fine, making it very easy to draw little hair-like lines when I fill in my brows</li>
      <li>This is the only brow pencil I recommend, goes on easily and stays on!</li>
      <li>This is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend!!</li>
      <li>The first one broke when I tried to twist it to get the pencil out.</li>
      <li>There are definitely more quality options out there for a similar price.</li>
      <li>Also, it&#x27;s kind of long (as are most eyebrow pencils)... if you&#x27;re planning to carry it in your makeup pouch/purse, be sure that&#x27;s long enough!</li>
      <li>A brow pencil that looks totally natural, blends in, doesn&#x27;t smudge, lasts all day, and is affordable!!!!</li>
      <li>The color of this particular one is what I would call a true brunette; a very medium brown.</li>
      <li>The only eyebrow pencil I&#x27;ve used and really liked so far.</li>
      <li>I have dark, dark brown hair and this is the perfect shade for my eyebrows.</li>
      <li>My only complaint would be the color, which is more of a warm brown than a cool brown</li>
      <li>The dark brown color blends nicely with my eyebrows.</li>
      <li>I have bought this in the past and loved it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;1) They both have fine tips and that make it easy to define little hairs and the shape of your brow&lt;</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used department store products as well as Maybelline and Lash Smart.  </li>
      <li>The automatic twist up tip doesn&#x27;t need sharpening and is so fine that you can draw individual hairs but just as easily fill in bigger spaces.</li>
      <li>I really like the color of this brow pencil.</li>
      <li>Really like the product.</li>
      <li>Really like this product.</li>
      <li>Not so much outdoors in the tropical heat.  </li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much for the price.</li>
      <li>Both went straight in the trash.</li>
      <li>I never had much eyebrows</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m definitely going to order a few more to stock up because I&#x27;m in love.</li>
      <li>The tiny stiff bristled spooley works great to brush brows and distribute color evenly.</li>
      <li>So much better than other brands I&#x27;ve used like Maybelline.  </li>
      <li>Nice and thin, good color for my almost black eyebrows.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Like this pencil but the brush end doesn&#x27;t stay attached after a few uses though.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! Easy to apply.  So much better than some higher name brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Love it! This is the only brow pencil I recommend, goes on easily and stays on!</li>
    <li> Great product. A fine enough pencil that gives natural results.  Had tried Diors that I loved, but the price was outrageous.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the drawn on fake look of eyebrows but do need something to fill in a few spots and this works wonders and looks natural</li>
    <li> I love the color and the thinness of the pencil, but not happy with the price or how the pencil tip breaks off.</li>
    <li> so far good i really love this product .</li>
    <li> I have used the Almay Brow Defining Pencil for many years...I do not know what has changed, however, the last two orders that I received have had an issue with the &amp;#34;lead&amp;#34; in the pencil breaking...in the latest purchase I cannot even begin to define my brows without the &amp;#34;lead&amp;#34; breaking off...very frustrating and expensive to boot...has something changed in the manufacture of this formerly wonderful product?</li>
    <li> the best brow pencil EVER.  discontinued in most stores.  i had to subscribe to it here on amazon.  price fluctuates for &amp;#34;brunette&amp;#34; shade.  MUST HAVE!</li>
    <li> Eliminated allergic reaction to other brow defining pencils</li>
    <li> This is easy to apply and looks very natural.  I find the stick comes apart quite easily though.</li>
    <li> Working well to fill in thinning eyebrows.</li>
    <li> I have been buying this product from a local drugstore, but sometimes it is out of stock.  The Subscribe &amp; Save price is the same as the sale price I had been paying at the drugstore, but I now have the peace of mind of knowing that I will receive the product on a regular basis without having to keep track of the sales and pray the item is in stock.  This is the only drugstore product that seems to work for drawing on my eyebrows.  It is an automatic pencil that draws a thin line.  The color generally lasts all day if I am in my air-conditioned office.  Not so much outdoors in the tropical heat.  The product lasts me maybe two months with daily use.  It has a spoolie on the end which you can use to help shape your brows.  My only complaint would be the color, which is more of a warm brown than a cool brown so looks a bit reddish on my skin tone.  I wish there were more color options available, but it is 1/5 the price of a similar product by Anastasia which does have more color options.  I use this product to draw a bottom line on my brows, and then fill with Anastasia Dipbrow Pomade in Medium Brown, which is a cooler color.  I then go over the bottom line with this pencil since I can&#x27;t seem to get a sharp line with my Anastasia brow brush.  Also, the spoolie on this product is easily detatched.  Perhaps a drop of glue may help.</li>
    <li> Not dark enough for my skin tone. Will have to keep searching for a better priced Maybelline define a line that has been discontinued. :(</li>
    <li> Like all almay&#x27;s products has a great quality, don&#x27;t hurt your skin and have a very affordable price this is my favorite brow defining</li>
    <li> Nice color goes on nice to</li>
    <li> Thank you ..... Liked it!</li>
    <li> Finally!!!! A brow pencil that looks totally natural, blends in, doesn&#x27;t smudge, lasts all day, and is affordable!!!! I feel like I&#x27;ve searched my entire adult life for this brow pencil. I have tried so many over the years and I couldn&#x27;t get the right color and quality combo. The color of this particular one is what I would call a true brunette; a very medium brown. I feel like it would work for many brown/brunette colors.I hope they never discontinue this one. I just bought 4 more just in case.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  I used to buy a similar one from sephora that cost me over $20.  Best one I could find at a regular drug store.</li>
    <li> the pencil itself is quit small so you can get defined lines, but because of the design it has support and won&#x27;t break even though it is small. It it also self sharpening so there is NO messy pencil shavings. great product.</li>
    <li> I usually hate retractable pencils because the &amp;#34;lead&amp;#34; breaks easily. I tried the Anastasia and I had that problem but I really this one especially for the cost. It hasn&#x27;t broken since I&#x27;be been using it.</li>
    <li> I have used brow powders and pencils. This is by far the most natural looking brow pencil I have used, plus the groomer tip at the other end is useful as well. I alternate between powder and pencil; too much pencil can sometimes cause one to lose eyebrow hairs!</li>
    <li> Been using this for weeks &amp; am happy with how it applies. Has a thin tip, which is perfect for detailing small brows. The brush is so useful &amp; actually works, unlike other brushes I&#x27;ve tried. Product isn&#x27;t too waxy, but does have a somewhat waxy feel. I&#x27;ve used comparable brands, relatively same in price, &amp; must say this one&#x27;s in the lead.</li>
    <li> Wow, this is a great brow pencil. I wasn&#x27;t expecting much for the price. I just tried it on a whim since I dyed my hair darker and my taupe pencils and powders no longer match. The color is great. dark brown without weird hits of red or brassiness I find in a lot of other brands. The formula is great. Dry enough to deliver natural results but goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t leave flecks. The automatic twist up tip doesn&#x27;t need sharpening and is so fine that you can draw individual hairs but just as easily fill in bigger spaces. The tiny stiff bristled spooley works great to brush brows and distribute color evenly. I think I paid $4 or 5 dollars for this pencil. I&#x27;ve never seen it in stores so I&#x27;m definitely going to order a few more to stock up because I&#x27;m in love.</li>
    <li> Really like the product. It only gets 3 stars because there is so little of it.</li>
    <li> wont last a week at his rate. do not waste your money.  maybe old? Never had anything so bad for eyebrows__not even $1.00 pencils</li>
    <li> I was looking for a new eyebrow pencil since they discontinued the one I used to use. I tried it and love this eyebrow pencil! I will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> Been using this pencil for years.....my &amp;#34;lack&amp;#34; of brow hair, I&#x27;m 77 years old, fills in nicely.  Highly recommend this brow pencil.</li>
    <li> Once I figured out the hang of it, I got it to work, but the brush end arrived broken. Fixed it with a little tape. There are definitely more quality options out there for a similar price.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like it. Ended up throwing it away. Way to soft and went on so dark even with the lightest application. And then the darn spooly brush kept falling off whenever I used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I moved on and bought a waterproof Dipbrow Pomade from Anastasia Beverly Hills and a Ardell Duo Brow Brush</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a dupe for my beloved Anastasia Brow Wiz and this pretty much fits the bill. I&#x27;ve tried other products, but done were as dark or pigmented. The formulation of this product is similar and different from the brown wiz in a couple ways:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Similarities:&lt;br /&gt;1) They both have fine tips and that make it easy to define little hairs and the shape of your brow&lt;br /&gt;2) It&#x27;s slightly creamier than the brow wiz, but I like it better. Makes it easier to apply in the morning&lt;br /&gt;3) They both can be used as standalone products for brows. I am very lazy and have little time in the mornings to use more than one brow product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Differences:&lt;br /&gt;1) It&#x27;s darker than my brow wiz in medium brown. I would swatch the comparison but I ran out of the brow whiz&lt;br /&gt;2) They booth have spooleys at the end! Although the brow wiz one is denser and better imo&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, the differences are minor and make this product less of a guilt trip to me than the brow whiz. I&#x27;ve attached a cruddy picture, but maybe this will be a little bit more helpful in discerning the color and payoff.</li>
    <li> Best brow pencil I&#x27;ve found so far.  Nice and thin, good color for my almost black eyebrows.  Some other dark brown brow pencils are too warm toned and wind up looking unnatural.  This one is a true dark brown so it looks natural.  If I could improve it in any way, the pencil would be a little firmer - it&#x27;s a tiny bit too soft.</li>
    <li> Perfect brown color and the pencil goes on smooth and easy to make little brush marks.  Stays on all day.  And it makes such a difference that never I knew, since without the product the outside edges of my brows are much lighter and this evens out the whole brow.  Love it and love Almay products in general.</li>
    <li> These are my favorite pencils... so easy to use and looks natural.  I can never find these at Walmart... sometimes they&#x27;re at Walgreens, but never at Walmart</li>
    <li> Almay is one of my favorite makeup brands, and this eyebrow pencil works great!  It goes on nicely and lasts.  I buy items like this on Amazon instead of going to the store for convenience.  I can usually find great prices too!</li>
    <li> Actual product inside was about 1/8th inch lone, rip off.</li>
    <li> Really like this product. It lasts for a good amount of time and is easy to work with!</li>
    <li> My new favorite eyebrow pencil! It doesn&#x27;t break off in pieces like the brand I used to buy. Goes on easily and smoothly, then I run the brush end over my brows to give them a great finish. I get quick, consistent results using this pencil</li>
    <li> I have dark, dark brown hair and this is the perfect shade for my eyebrows. Stays put too.</li>
    <li> Too fragile, so the end with the brush broke off after one day! Needless to say I couldn&#x27;t exactly use it for the purpose of which it was intended (my eyebrows!) with no brush!!! Also, it&#x27;s kind of long (as are most eyebrow pencils)... if you&#x27;re planning to carry it in your makeup pouch/purse, be sure that&#x27;s long enough!</li>
    <li> Love this eyebrow pencil. Always come back to it &amp; so glad it&#x27;s available for auto shipping at the frequency I need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s long lasting &amp; the brush on the end is great for brushing your eyebrows before you fill them in as well as blending the pencil into brows to complete the look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Amazon &amp; Almay!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t figure out how to use it.  I see the pencil part, but I can&#x27;t get it OUT.  Very frustrating.</li>
    <li> One of my all time favorite brow pencils. The tip is very skinny, which allows me to create very natural brows. It&#x27;s also inexpensive</li>
    <li> I have bought this in the past and loved it. This particular pencil seems to crumble. Maybe it was not stored properly somewhere along the line?</li>
    <li> My wife seems to like the pencil for whatever it is for lol. She uses it all the time and it has lasted longer than she thought it would.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best eyebrow pencil I have tried. It is a very thin crayon style pencil that blends beautifully with your brows. It looks very natural and not &amp;#34;painted on&amp;#34;.  I highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> Stays on all day and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.  So much better than other brands I&#x27;ve used like Maybelline.  Very natural looking and makes your brows look thicker</li>
    <li> Really good one... I can compare it to the anastacia one... The only thing is that does not come back in after you pull the pencil out.. Dont know why. But besides that really good</li>
    <li> I suffer from trichotillomania which means most of the time, I don&#x27;t have eyebrows. Looking at me, most people wouldn&#x27;t notice this right away, instead they sort of sense a &amp;#34;wrongness&amp;#34; about my face that they just can&#x27;t put their finger on. I notice though, and it makes me unhappy. I&#x27;ve tried about every eyebrow pencil on the market and this one has so far been the best in terms of creating realistic looking natural eyebrows. When I use this pencil I can create the illusion of fine hairs as well as fill in areas for full coverage. It does not need to be sharpened. It comes to a very fine point for excellent control and self sharpens with use. It&#x27;s long lasting and easily removed with a small bit of eye makeup remover, or soap and water. I feel very confident when I walk out the door wearing my Almay Eyebrows and dread the day these become discontinued. I already can no longer find them in stores and am very glad that Amazon still carries them.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very good product except that it breaks very easily other than that a good purchase.</li>
    <li> The only eyebrow pencil I&#x27;ve used and really liked so far. My eyebrows are nearly black but sparse on the ends. The dark brown is a perfect shade, dark but not too harsh. The pencil is super fine, making it very easy to draw little hair-like lines when I fill in my brows and they always look very natural.</li>
    <li> I really like the color of this brow pencil. It&#x27;s a nice shade of brown, without any redness in it. But I&#x27;m not able to draw hairstrokes with it; despite it being a slim pencil.</li>
    <li> its inexpensive and its a perfect color. goes on smoothly and with my oily skin it still stays put all day into the night. I have no brows and have to basically draw them on and then to soften the look I take the eyebrow brow brush and go over it lightly and voila! perfect.</li>
    <li> love the thin lead. color is perfect for my hair. I&#x27;m asian with dark hair and i bought the brunette color. It can definitely replace anastasia brow wiz, at least for me.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. I got two. The first one broke when I tried to twist it to get the pencil out. The second one didn&#x27;t even twist and I couldn&#x27;t get the pencil out at all. Both went straight in the trash.</li>
    <li> the brush part of the product broke off within a week because it cracked at the base while gently brushing my brows upwards.  I&#x27;ve never had that happen with any other brow product.  I&#x27;ve used department store products as well as Maybelline and Lash Smart.  For the price, I will buy something else next time.</li>
    <li> My favorite by far. I love it so much that if I am just around the house I use a different one as to not use this one all up! There&#x27;s not a ton in the pencil and its a little pricey so I reserve it.</li>
    <li> I love this brow pencil and the brow brush is the primary reason I use it.  Application is very nice and easy.  Very little is required so the pencil lasts at least a couple months with every day use.  I do not have thick eye brows, however, so if you do it may not last quite as long as it does for me.  Technically this is not a pencil.  You twist the end to advance the color stick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reasons for 4 stars:&lt;br /&gt;1.  Sometimes the pencil tip will break off with little pressure being applied.&lt;br /&gt;2.  After prolonged use the end with the brush tends to crack and break off.  Usually the brush still slips in the slot, however, it no longer stays securely in place.</li>
    <li> This eyebrow pencil is very thin and so when you use it it looks like you&#x27;re drawing little hairs.  Very natural looking!  The company made a poor decision and replaced it with a much fatter triangle tip. Bad move</li>
    <li> This is a great brow pencil! I never had much eyebrows so I have used many brow pencils &amp; tried many brands. This is one of the best! I have dark brown hair &amp; it matches well. If you have lighter hair this may not work well for you, it would be too dark.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I was looking for. I was using a high end pencil but it broke rather easily in my bag. Not wanting to spend another $22 on it, I looked for a less expensive version. This pencil is even better than the expensive one I was using. Won&#x27;t go back now! The dark brown color blends nicely with my eyebrows.</li>
