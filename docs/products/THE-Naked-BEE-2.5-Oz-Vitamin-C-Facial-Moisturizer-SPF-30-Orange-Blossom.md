      <li>amazing citrus scent, and</li>
      <li>AMAZING.  </li>
      <li>It absorbs nicely.</li>
      <li>Also nice smell and thicker for the winter.</li>
      <li>but that&#x27;s my own fault for not reapplying it after being out in the sun all day.  </li>
      <li>It has a nice scent.</li>
      <li>Works nicely for all the reasons it claims it does.</li>
      <li>I honestly don&#x27;t think there is another product out there that comes close to having all my preferences  in one product.</li>
      <li>This product smells wonderful and moisturizes very well.  </li>
      <li>the orange is nice too.  </li>
      <li>and she liked it.</li>
      <li>I give them props though because it smells good and because of the fact that they were able to make a product which had everything I was looking for.</li>
      <li>For a third the price of what you would pay in the retail stores, it works great, absorbs well, and makes my face feel wonderful!  </li>
      <li>The scents are so nice.  </li>
      <li>It has great ingredients, high spf &amp; also a great moisturizer.</li>
      <li>The first thing I noticed was that this is a VERY GOOD moisturizer</li>
      <li>this is a good choice and at 70% organic I can overlook the strong odor of honey/oranges.  </li>
      <li>I love this product; great price for great product; protects skin; nice natural citrusy fragrance</li>
      <li>It is by far the best product that I have used to hold moisture.  </li>
      <li>It includes some of my favorite moisturizing ingredients like hyaluronic acid and rose hip oil (rosa carina fruit oil is on the ingredients list).  </li>
      <li>It doesnt make my face break out into pimples, I think it might be because the texture is very light</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been hopping from moisturizer to moisturizer for more than a year now.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love the smell. Feels good on the skin. Uses it after my peels. Overall a good product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been hopping from moisturizer to moisturizer for more than a year now. I look for products that don&#x27;t test on animals, contain at least SPF 30, and cost less than about $15.00. I have used quite a few different things that meet those criteria, but The Naked Bee is the first one I&#x27;ve used that also works perfectly with my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, I think the smell is gorgeous, but it&#x27;s also pretty strong. Whether or not you&#x27;ll like it is just a matter of personal taste. The texture is thicker than I&#x27;m used to, but that&#x27;s no problem. It goes on smoothly and absorbs well, without leaving a greasy mess or a whitish cast. My skin is prone to acne, and this moisturizer doesn&#x27;t seem to make it break out. Overall, I&#x27;m extremely pleased with this product, and I will be buying it again.</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t particularly like the smell and its too overpriced to use as a moisturizer or as a sunscreen....so i&#x27;m just using it on my face for the sun for now until its gone and then back to something to else</li>
    <li> So far I love this product. I had been using Murad&#x27;s Vitamin C sunscreen but couldn&#x27;t justify the price with my tight budget. Glad to find a cheaper alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do warn though, if you don&#x27;t like fragrant products steer clear. This definitely has a scent to it. It&#x27;s called Orange Blossom for a reason :). I don&#x27;t mind it as it&#x27;s not overly flowery or cheap smelling.</li>
    <li> Good &amp; thick, lasts a long time</li>
    <li> Again- The Naked Bee cannot be compared to any other products! Quality and no parabens and preservatives etc. The scent and&lt;br /&gt;benefits are fantastic.  Great sellers.</li>
    <li> This product is definitely better than most sunscreens and moisturizers on the market, better ingredients, better quality. However, I can&#x27;t get past the smell. Most people seem to enjoy it, I frankly cannot stand it. Reviewers say it smells like honey, to me it smells like artificial grapes mixed with something else I can&#x27;t quite figure out. The smell is so overpowering it literally makes me nauseous. This is just me and should not deter anyone from buying this product, but just wanted to warn anyone who may have a sensitive sniffer. I will continue my search elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I love the smell and it keeps my face moisturized all day even snowy winter days. Very happy :)</li>
    <li> Very nice but difficult to get out of tube because of thickness of lotion. Love the smell.</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed this product. I need something to handle the elevation, wind and sun on our trip to Ecuador and this was perfect.  It has a slight pleasant smell and it simply glides on.  I loved it.</li>
    <li> This product is great as a wintertime SPF 30 face moisturizer.  It has vitamin C which may be the single best ingredient in skin care.  It also has honey and hylauronic acid which are two of the best moisturizers.  It goes on thick yet absorbent, which no greasy finish.  All wonderful.  The smell is terrible, unless you like smelling a constant stream of sweetness.  I personally don&#x27;t like fragrances (especially on my face where I can smell it constantly!) in general and sweet smelling fragrances in particular.  It is completely overwhelming and kills an otherwise great product.  Because it&#x27;s on your face, you will smell it ALL.DAY.LONG.  If they came out with an unscented version, this would be a 5 star product hands down.</li>
    <li> This is a trial run for the SPF 30 product. It would be better if it went further so I could use it on my legs. It doesn&#x27;t seem to spread very far and the tube is half gone already after using it everyday for about a week. That seems to make it quite expensive. I do like what it is doing to my skin with softening lines and doing it&#x27;s job. I would recommend it but only as a facial moisturizer, not as a sunscreen.</li>
    <li> Nice texture, smells delicious.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using this lotion. It has great ingredients, high spf &amp; also a great moisturizer. I a,so really like the smell. I use this every day in the morning &amp; I haven&#x27;t gotten sunburned at all! Works nicely for all the reasons it claims it does. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> I really do like this moisturizer but it is very heavy so I find it best for winter use.  I have combination skin so this would not work for me in the warmer months.  The smell wasn&#x27;t bad at all.  Great on your hands as well.</li>
    <li> It smells terrible. I don&#x27;t like it on my skin, it broke me out. Though I hate to waste things so I&#x27;ll have to find some use for it. Maybe put it on the back of my hands. Too bad, I wish I could&#x27;ve liked it.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the product yet but the condition of the package was just gross. There is hair, dust &amp; dirt stuck to the bottle and sticker label, and scuff marks all over the bottle. Looks like it&#x27;s been lying around on a dirty floor. Ew! Really makes me not even want to open the bottle. Also, the description isn&#x27;t entirely accurate, there are far more than 3 ingredients in this product.</li>
    <li> I really like the smell and feel of this product on my skin.  I am super happy with the purchase and will be buying again!</li>
    <li> I am OK with the smell, although I must add that the other products like the hand lotion and especially the thick body cream smell much more like the honey and orange blossom they are supposed to smell like. I am thinking that all the added ingredients like plant botanicals, anti-oxidents and wrinkle reducer, may have changed the smell profile a little. It still smells like orange and honey but not as much as the other products, The added honey is hygroscopic, that is, it attracts and holds water which if of course the best moisturizing effect. The hyaluronic acid can be a problem for some people and it did cause a bit of a sting and slight rash for me in some other products I&#x27;ve tried, but it didn&#x27;t do that with this cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Paraben and PABA free is a good thing plus it does not contain propylene glycol (antifreeze!) or mineral oil that can be greasy and clog pores. The best thing about this is that it does not just sit on top of my face like most other products. It absorbs very quickly and is not at all greasy, and I can apply makeup almost immediately after putting this on. The added SPF is a big plus. I will be ordering this again.</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE this product! It smells and amazing and feels great on my face. I&#x27;ll definitely be using this face moisturizer from now on.</li>
    <li> I was really looking forward to using this product.  I was happy with the ingredients and that it provided an SPF of 30.  I put some on the back of my hand and it has a nice texture.  Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t get past the fragrance.  My daughter says it smells like an &amp;#34;old lady&#x27;s perfume&amp;#34; and I have to agree.  I was hoping it would dissipate over time, but I soon had to wash it off. I&#x27;m very sensitive to scents, so it probably won&#x27;t be an issue for most, but it gave me a headache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please, Naked Bee people, make an unscented version.  I will be the first to buy it!</li>
    <li> I am not sensitive to smells and the fragrance in this gave me a horrible headache and I couldn&#x27;t breath through my nose. I wore it to work and could smell it all day and it was just too strong. I ended up throwing it out.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is creamy and very moisturizing without being greasy. It smells nice, but doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive, acne-prone skin. It doesn&#x27;t ball or flake up even when I apply my primer or makeup. It doesn&#x27;t turn my tan skin ashy gray like many other SPF 30s out there. Best of all, it doesn&#x27;t have parabens or other nasty chemicals.</li>
    <li> This stuff is really nice, the smell reminds me of a freshly squeezed orange mixed with a bit of sugar and the consistency isn&#x27;t too thick. It&#x27;s great for an everyday sunscreen under makeup or without.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure that this product is great for the skin, and would probably have positive effects if I used it on a regular basis. But I just can&#x27;t get past the sickly-sweet baby-powder-ish smell. I don&#x27;t want that on my face. I had to wash it off the first time I applied it. Oh well.</li>
    <li> This product smells great (and as a bonus is 70% organic). Unlike other moisturizers with sunscreens, this one doesn&#x27;t leave a white pallor and absorbs into the skin easily and quickly. It has become my go-to daily moisturizer and I will continue to stock up!</li>
    <li> love all naked bee prods</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this product. I use it under my makeup if I have a dry spot on my face. I hate how foundation looks caked on if you have dry skin patches. I get dry skin on my chin and sides of my nose. This product really helps. Plus it has some spf protection.</li>
    <li> Love this! I purchased it for the first time when I needed a sunblock for my face.  I used it everyday when I was in the Bahamas and it did it&#x27;s job I would say.  I used it under my makeup.  I got a little burnt on my nose and forehead but that&#x27;s my own fault for not reapplying it after being out in the sun all day.  I also actually love the honey vitamin C smell that it has.  I hate greasy lotion and this was not greasy at all!  I would recommend!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff and you can&#x27;t beat the price. Also nice smell and thicker for the winter. Love it!</li>
    <li> I like this facial lotion but it&#x27;s a tad too thick and is hard to smear on your skin. It&#x27;s a little over priced for the size so i&#x27;ll probably go back to the 40 carrots brand. However the hand and body lotion is great and i use it ever day,,and will never go back to my old body lotion.&lt;br /&gt;Naked Bee should think of doing some &amp;#34;Baby Bee&amp;#34; products for small children. And maybe start doing some face wash products for adults.</li>
    <li> All Summer Use...smells great, works great w/SPF 30</li>
    <li> It has a gentle smell and smooth consistency. I have combination skin and use it during the summer time. I love the spf aspect and apply it underneath my makeup. It did not create an orange undertone as long as you don&#x27;t cake on your makeup. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Has a nice natural fragrance and a great consistency.  Very good daily sunscreen.</li>
    <li> When I first found this product, I was ecstatic. I had been looking for a daily moisturizer which had vitamin C, SPF 30, paraben free, and mostly organic/all natural. I honestly don&#x27;t think there is another product out there that comes close to having all my preferences  in one product. Unfortunately, it makes me break out and my skin shiny/oily. I only get surface pimples, which are relatively easy to take care of, but it&#x27;s still too much of a hassle. I&#x27;ve tried using only the very smallest amount possible to cover my face but, alas, it still doesn&#x27;t meet my expectations. I give them props though because it smells good and because of the fact that they were able to make a product which had everything I was looking for. That&#x27;s the thing about skin products though..what works for one may not work for all. It&#x27;s definitely worth a try if you are thinking about buying it because (to my knowledge) no other company makes a similar product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many facial moisturizers with SPF 30, and this is my favorite by far. Light, not greasy, absorbs quickly, and I love the fragrance!</li>
    <li> This product works fine and has a good texture, but the smell is very pungent!  Will use this more often in the summer when I need a higher spf and I don&#x27;t have to sit inside smelling it all day.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer has a very thick consistency, and it feels more like body lotion, not a face moisturizer. This could have been the way the product was made or several factors could have played into such as sitting on a shelf for too long or maybe it was expired (though I didn&#x27;t check that), I don&#x27;t know. I really wanted to like it, but it broke out my face after several uses. I know certain products work differently on everyone&#x27;s skin, as for me, I did not like it and I returned it.</li>
    <li> I love this facial moisturizer.  It not only protects you from the sun rays but feels calming and nice, not greasy, on your skin.  Smells delightful and easy on the pocketbook too!</li>
    <li> Not sure why but I break out every time I use this...I mean EVERY time.  I have a mixed complexion...some oily some dry skin and it doesn&#x27;t matter I can break out where it&#x27;s dry or oily.</li>
    <li> I actually like the smell, it&#x27;s interesting. I think the sunscreen ingredients are what makes it strange but its worth it for the protection. Makes my skin feel soooo good and pores smaller. Only drawback is the slight oiliness after application. Quick fix: just dab around face with a tissue. Overall I like this lotion a lot and will probably buy again.</li>
    <li> Smells good and protects me! No burn!</li>
    <li> love having moisturizer with out all the paba and other stuff in it, this is great, and love the smell</li>
    <li> Great smell and thick consistency, but made me break out. Will use for &#x27;active&#x27; sunscreen only rather than daily use.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this! I use it on my face under make-up and it works well for me. Makes my skin feel soft.</li>
    <li> the smell was so intense it followed me the entire day. Pity because it feels good on the skin. but just can&#x27;t use it because of the cloying smell.</li>
    <li> Mine arrived with the opening blocked due to the fact that the part of the lid that keeps it closed had broken off into the tube. I had to remove it with tweezers. I am allergic to oxybenzone and this doesn&#x27;t contain it - but it is a chemical vs mineral sunscreen. I had high hopes for the scent. Unfortunately, it is much more floral than fresh. And it&#x27;s strong, only slowly dissipating. It reminded me of something my mother might wear. Not that there&#x27;s anything wrong with that... Guess I&#x27;ll have to get used to it!</li>
    <li> Wonderful lotion.  I really think it is making my age spots lighter.  Not greasy.  Great price.  My only complaint is the smell.  While it smells great at first, I&#x27;m tired of it.  And it&#x27;s a strong smell.  I wish they had products without it.  I definitely recommend buying it.</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this! Makes my face a bit shiney but dissipates after awhile. I use this in the morning and as far as i can tell it provides good protection from the sun.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of moisturizers with spf but this is by far my favorite. It doesn&#x27;t sit on the skin and there is no white cast . If you&#x27;re looking for a new facial moisturizer, give this one a try. It really does smell like oranges.</li>
    <li> I love honey - if you don&#x27;t, this probably isn&#x27;t for you. Still, I love the ingredients, the feel, and the look of this moisturizer. It works perfectly with my combination skin. I use this in the morning before putting on makeup and my face feels great all day.</li>
    <li> The delivery was on time as promised. I loved this product ver much. I used it everyda.</li>
    <li> Product is a little on the heavy side, makes face shiny.</li>
    <li> I LOVE naked bee moisturizer.  I don&#x27;t think the SPF is compatible works</li>
    <li> The product is a little thick, I usually lightly moisten my fingers in water before applying.  I think the scent is great.  My first Naked Bee product, and now I&#x27;d try others.</li>
    <li> A little thicker and waxier than their flagship moisturizer.  Scent isn&#x27;t as strong in this formulation.  A little goes a long way.  It includes some of my favorite moisturizing ingredients like hyaluronic acid and rose hip oil (rosa carina fruit oil is on the ingredients list).  I have been using a little Neutrogena oil-free moisture for sensitive skin and then using this for sunscreen.  I&#x27;m not sure yet if it is pore-clogging or not, but a friend actually asked what I was wearing on my skin and remarked how wonderful it looks.  Also, the company sells at many small stores (I discovered it in a country market while getting u-pick fruit) and I like supporting a small company!  Try the lip gloss!  I&#x27;ve been a long-time fan of their flagship moisturizer and lip gloss and have been pleased with this new addition.</li>
    <li> Discovered this stuff at a little ghost town gift store in Arizona.  AMAZING.  It smells heavenly, protects very well from the sun, and you can really feel the moisture get into your skin.  I have combination skin and am very dry on my of my face and prone to break-outs on my chin, and this does the best job of moisturizing without any greasiness.  You can literally *feel* this stuff, and it feels fresh and healthy.  I have spent fortunes on creams from Sephora, and while some were decent, nothing can compare to Naked Bee.</li>
    <li> I put it on every morning and in a minute or two its soaked in enough to put on makeup without a problem. Personally, I love the smell. I don&#x27;t think the aroma is too strong and is not overpowering at all, but just might be a personal preference. If you don&#x27;t like the smell of orange and honey/beeswax this isn&#x27;t for you. I do wish they had a stronger spf as with very fair skin I have to put on a stronger spf if I know I&#x27;m going to be outdoors a long time. Since Aveda discontinued their moisturizer with spf, this is my new go-to for daily use.</li>
    <li> I like this product. I use it every morning before I put on my makeup. It absorbs nicely. You can smell the orange or vitamin C in it. My only issue or concern was that when I received it there was no seal any where! Not on the cap not under then cap there was no sealed box. So that kinda was odd. I almost sent it back but didnt want to hassle it I was completely out of moisturizer so I took the risk and trusted it had not been tampered with or that it wasn&#x27;t a tester from some store shelf. Would I order again.. if I new it would come with a saftey seal on it I totally would.</li>
    <li> I love the Naked Bee products!  They are the best I have used to date, you can feel the product working within minutes and see the results within a couple of days!  No more winter cracking and totally smooth and soft hands and arms!</li>
    <li> When I first tried this product I was a bit taken aback by the strong smell. But now I rather like it, and my kids tell me I smell like Sweet Tarts when I use it.</li>
    <li> a little goes a long way, smells great, makes my skin feel and look good</li>
    <li> I bought this stuff as a facial sunscreen, something I could use under my makeup every day. I did that for about two months before I couldn&#x27;t take the greasy look anymore. My face was always greasy. My pores seemed to get bigger too and now they won&#x27;t go down. It&#x27;s a fine sunscreen but maybe only use it on days when you plan to be outdoors. I&#x27;ll need to keep looking for a nongreasy sunscreen to wear daily.</li>
    <li> Let me first say I LOVE the smell and texture of this product! Oh, how I wish it worked better in our ever-sun drenched climate, but it doesn&#x27;t provide enough protection when I&#x27;m working in the garden and sweating. The product is otherwise quite heavenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I&#x27;ve come back to add and edit my comment, because here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve discovered: I absolutely love this stuff. My skin loves this stuff. I wear it at night - nothing I&#x27;ve ever done before with a &#x27;sunscreen.&#x27; But it&#x27;s so hydrating and does not break my skin out like some heavier botanical products. So now I&#x27;m hooked. And what I&#x27;ve taken to doing is simply reapplying small amounts, especially to my face, throughout the day if I&#x27;m outside a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe some people have commented that they don&#x27;t like the smell. But no accounting for personal taste, I guess. Mmmmmm. Love it.</li>
    <li> I borrowed some of this from friend when needed moisturizer/sunscreen...love it! It is by far the best product that I have used to hold moisture.  Also, I love the aroma! It is just slightly  honey.</li>
    <li> This is just okay. It smells alot of honey, a little too strong. I have sensitive skin and this is a little stingy over my cheeks and eyes. It does appear to provide a good SPF.</li>
    <li> My Husband uses this Moisturizer and really seems to like it ,he is trying to use natural products something he has been wanting to do but waited now he took a step in the right direction, I have used this myself it goes on a little thick but absorbs right into face, doesn&#x27;t leave you with that oily feeling he uses this every morning and at night ,I will say he is 100 percent Irish and has super sensitive skin and with other products he has used caused irritation to skin but not this .This is a 2.5 oz tube Vitamin C enriched,70 percent organic with SPF 30 Broad Spectrum with UVA&amp;UVB protection this is Paraben and Paba free with no propylene glycol or mineral oil and is Phthalate-FREE and a BIG PLUS NOT TESTED ON ANIMALS! The active ingredients are Avobenzone 3% Octycrylene3% and Octisalate 5% .Apply 15 minutes before sun exposure and Re-apply every two hours also says use a water resistant sunscreen if swimming or sweating.He really likes the Naked Bee products and the orange scent is unbelievable .This tube has lasted for a while know but will be ordering more for him very soon.I do recommend this this product.</li>
    <li> It feels great and I love the SPF 30 protection!</li>
    <li> I live in Florida and need daily UV protection.  I had used the regular Naked Bee Hand and Body Lotion and loved it so I knew this would also be a winner.  I love the way it feels on my skin and it allows my makeup to go on smoothly as well.  I love this product and will continue to buy it on Amazon because it&#x27;s hard to find in stores.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this moisturizer because of the natural ingredient list and the SPF protection.  I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell, which reminds me of baby aspirin. LOL  It absorbs into my skin well enough.  I&#x27;m not totally sold mainly because of the smell so I&#x27;m still shopping to find a better fit.</li>
    <li> I have the whole line and love it. Works great on eczema skin.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite everyday lotion; I hope they never discontinue it. Unlike many sunscreens, this is not sticky or overly smelly and leaves my face feeling soft to the touch. Also, unlike many facial lotions, this actually has SPF 30. I was previously using Eucerin&#x27;s daily moisturizing lotion with SPF, and that stung my eyes if I sweat or misapplied; this product does not. I am also acne-prone and this product was so gentle and non-aggravating to my skin that I actually went to buy the Naked Bee bar soap which I also love!</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this since it is 70% organic, but it broke out my face and made my pores look larger than normal. Other reviewers have commented on the scent and it smells like my grandma&#x27;s cheap perfume. The scent goes away after a while and it wasn&#x27;t bothersome to me after about 10 minutes. I will use it on other parts of my body, but not my face. :(</li>
    <li> I love this product! It&#x27;s a great moisturizer and it is the best smell ever! I can&#x27;t get enough! I highly recommend it</li>
    <li> wonderful!!! my face feels so great whenever i use this. my tip: do not put on before bed at night! i got blackheads when i did that, but get no such thing when i put it on in the daytime! it&#x27;s probably something i did wrong, and have only had excellent results since i stopped!</li>
    <li> I like the fragrance and feel.</li>
    <li> Makes my face look oily.</li>
    <li> I love this product; great price for great product; protects skin; nice natural citrusy fragrance</li>
    <li> This is specifically for the face, it is thicker than the regular formula. i am pretty sure so it doesn&#x27;t run into your eyes and mouth, which is the problem I have had with the other if used on the face. This formula is great, it smells wonderful like honeysuckle, its mostly organic too. Love this company, I no longer use traditional sunscreen there is just too much unnatural ingredients in them. I hope you will give it a try, as it is a good price for what you get. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer woks really well, but the smell is horribly overpowering!! It doesn&#x27;t smell like orange blossom, it smells more like cloves. :( I definitely won&#x27;t be purchasing this item again.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I have dry skin and I like to use oily lotions in the cold months to protect my face from the cold wind outside and the moisture sucking heater inside the house. It&#x27;s also great that the moisturizer has 30 SPF, much higher than many other brands, natural or not. Its smell seems a bit fake, but it&#x27;s pleasant and not overwhelming. I probably would not use it in hot weather because my face gets really sweaty in the heat, but for now, with the cold weather, it&#x27;s awesome. It&#x27;s also a decent price, especially with Amazon super saver shipping. Glad I bought it. Cheers!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and this face lotion has not caused any irritation plus it&#x27;s not greasy. It does smell really good as well which is nice. So far I&#x27;m a big fan of naked bees products.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this face cream and use it every morning.  I first purchased it at a hospital gift shop and now have to search high and low for it.  Luckily Amazon has it!  I am 48 years old, have dry skin and use it every morning.  It keeps my face moisturized throughout the day!  Lightweight, non-greasy and after a few minutes of allowing it to soak in, I apply powder makeup.  (Pleasant smelling too!)  A friend gave me the gift pack for my birthday so I could try more of the product and I love ALL of them.  Naked Bee is a MUCH better product than Burt&#x27;s Bees (which I don&#x27;t care for.)  Wonderful product.  Highly recommend.  The price is right too!!!!!</li>
    <li> I am very aware of the ingredients in my personal care products.  I was using Mario Bedescu 30 SPF moisturizer and comparing the two this one is thicker and more stinky, however, I feel like for the price this is a good choice and at 70% organic I can overlook the strong odor of honey/oranges.  Still need to taste its effectiveness against the sun but so far I like it for winter as I have oily skin.  it does leave a shine when applied but for winter this will do!</li>
    <li> I have been using the Body Shop&#x27;s Vitamin C Daily Moisturizer - SPF 30, which is pretty expensive for 1.69 fl ounces. On top of that, the Body Shop brand has a greasy, sunblock feel. Plus the citrus smell/flavor was so intense that my boyfriend would refuse to kiss me after I&#x27;d applied it! This, to the contrary, is the LEAST greasy-feeling facial cream I&#x27;ve ever used. It feels thick, almost waxy, and has a really pleasant smell. It also spreads like a wax in that it takes more of the product to reach the same surface area of  your face. I have the feeling that I will go through this about as quickly as is Body Shop counterpart so cost-wise I suspect it will be about the same, or slightly cheaper. However, it is still less greasy feeling and smells nicer. Plus, I prefer the Naked Bee all natural philosophy over random preservatives/additives you get with the Body Shop. All in all, I approve!</li>
    <li> I have mentioned before that I am trying out new spf moisturizers; the spf alluding to the fact that its for use during the day when the sun is out.  This stuff is greasy and smelly.  Maybe good for your feet.</li>
    <li> The only face sunscreen that I use</li>
    <li> Love how this feels. Best of all, it&#x27;s cruelty free.</li>
    <li> I had used the body lotion before for my toddler and she liked it. So I tried the face sunscreen for me and I love it too!</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is ok but smells awful. I&#x27;m not very sensitive and never care about other peoples reviews if they tell about smell,  but this product, I couldn&#x27;t stand it, I just throw it away (was too cheap to return).</li>
    <li> After trying The Naked Bee sunscreen products last summer I decided to try this moisturizer since I am very fair and need spf 30 in a moisturizer.  it feels so amazing to use this ...amazing citrus scent, and I know I am not slathering on chemicals.  It is a thick cream, not very lightweight but it does absorb nicely.  My face feels very hydrated as well.</li>
    <li> All of the Naked Bee products are great.  I use this one daily, all year long.  Gives good protection from the sun plus moisturizes my skin.  The scents are so nice.  Wish this one came in Chai but the orange is nice too.  I am seeing this more in stores but the price and having it delivered are a plus in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I am 31 with oily acne prone skin. Love it... evens ny skin tone and leaves it matte. This is all I wear now...no more makeup. It absorbs easily...no OILY residue which I hate. Best spf and moisturizer</li>
    <li> Really like this product. First time trying it, but has a decent smell and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.</li>
    <li> I am not sure what ingredients in this product have had such a good effect on my skin, but I&#x27;m sticking with this stuff! You can&#x27;t imagine how many abandoned experimental tubes and jars of gunk I have in my bathroom cabinet. I bought this for a daily SPF, but at the time I was also looking for a moisturizer.. trying to get off the parabens. The first thing I noticed was that this is a VERY GOOD moisturizer AND I can stand it! I can&#x27;t stand greasy (like soooo many of them.) I can&#x27;t stand perfumed (like the rest of them.) In fact, since high school I could only stand Vaseline Intensive Care on my face and since their formula change that was also not so great. So to find that Naked Bee was this great moisturizer....first miracle. It feels very good going on. I also found I could put my other more highly rated SPF on top of this one when planning to be outside a lot. I had stopped using that one because it was too drying, but Naked Bee really soaks into your skin and stays there and the next layer doesn&#x27;t cause drying any more. I didn&#x27;t particularly like the sweetness of the Naked Bee smell, but I&#x27;ve decided I can stand it. That says a lot, because I have an extremely particular nose and had to wake up in the night to wash off the L&#x27;Oreal cream I once tried. Nix on perfume please. But as I keep using this product, I&#x27;ve noticed actual improvement with several skin issues on my 50+ skin. I am sold!</li>
    <li> I cannot use it on my hands her neck because I&#x27;m allergic to it.  I thought it was organic but it still has chemicals in it.  Fortunately, I can use it on my face and I love the smell.</li>
    <li> i love it... it makes my face skins soft and moist. I have a moderate dry skins, this product is really good with dry skin people. and I love the smells also.. definitely a good product.</li>
    <li> Love it! Love the smell, love the feel, love how it makes my skin look. I have oily skin and it does not make my skin extra oily like a lot of moisturizers</li>
    <li> Love the way this lotion feels on my face.  And it has the smell of honey!</li>
    <li> Dr Oz recommends daily use of SPF30 or higher. Love that this us 70% organic. It is not greasy at all, and it has a smell, but I think it is vitamin c-ish and I don&#x27;t mind it at all. Love this and will be ordering regularly!!!</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer!  It&#x27;s light and absorbs quickly but also effective.  I use it on my face and arms,  it never leaves a greasy feel . This moisturizer also has a very pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> I was intent on purchasing a sunscreen moisturizer for this season that wouldn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling worse than when I put it on. I did some sleuthing and decided on this one, and I&#x27;m glad I gave it a try! So far it seems to work well with my VERY combo skin -- it can be oily under the dryness, but when I use this I don&#x27;t notice any oiliness OR dryness... it feels balanced. So far the sun protection aspect seems to be good, too. I&#x27;ll be better able to judge that when I&#x27;ve been out in the harsh high desert sun for any period of time! The scent is also very nice and has a floral/citrusy thing going on.</li>
    <li> really love this stuff. smells good and works good. even my husband likes it.</li>
    <li> What a great product! The ingredients aren&#x27;t too scary and it doesn&#x27;t make my face super shiny like most SPF moisturizers. The orange/honey smell might be a bit too strong for some but it really is not that bad and you only smell it for a few seconds during application.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a bit early to give a full report.  Have been using product for only about 1 week.  However, I like how the product makes my skin look, which is more balanced and less ruddy.  I also like the consistency of the cream.  It&#x27;s not overly heavy, nor is it watery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read the reviews prior to buying the cream.  People have said good and bad things.  Some have commented on the smell.  I actually think this has a light orange-y scent, which I like.  I appreciate the SPF in it and it so far doesn&#x27;t make me want to scratch my face off.  Yeaiiiii!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will report further on cream when I&#x27;ve used for a longer time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> This smelled sooooooo weird. Really just don&#x27;t buy it! I hated it and returned it. If you want something better than just make something yourself, that&#x27;s what I do now.</li>
    <li> not greasy, dosen&#x27;t get in/sting eyes, smells really good...works and feels like heavy moisturizer but not &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; on.  i love this stuff....just found it but know will be lifelong customer....mostly organic and for the price: awesome</li>
    <li> I am not overly thrilled with this product because I really don&#x27;t care for the fragrance of it. The texture seems good, not greasy at all and it goes well under makeup. I am getting used to the fragrance, but that was why I only gave 4 stars.</li>
    <li> For the first time I can wear sunscreen daily on my face with this product. It doesnt make my face break out into pimples, I think it might be because the texture is very light and it doesnt clog the pores. About the smell, it is very pleasant, it feels like a beach summer breeze in my face, and it is not persistent, so after a few minutes of applying it, you wont feel the smell !! Therefore, it make no sense to complain about it, because if you dont like the smell (which only a crazy person would do) it will fade away quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it ! It is a great product.</li>
    <li> Love this product. A bit on the thick side but smells great and I use another thinner product if I feel my skin get too moist for a couple days then switch back because it feels so good.</li>
    <li> I started by searching for &amp;#34;mens face cream.&amp;#34; This face cream fits the bill!!! It dries fast, stays on long, protects me from UV rays, and has a mild scent that&#x27;s refreshing. I give this a man&#x27;s A rating! I would also add that my wife loves the product, so a Woman&#x27;s A rating works as well! I&#x27;ll be purchasing this often!</li>
    <li> I got the lotion at a store on a whim and loved it so much I looked up where to get more. I found this face lotion and I absolutely love it, my skin has actually brightened too since using it. The smell is fantastic, it doesn&#x27;t leave you greasy and it feels wonderful.</li>
    <li> Luv this.  First time I am able to wear a sunscreen.  I have allergies to all that I have tried in the past.  Light with a nice scent.  Will definitely try other Naked Bee products and buy this again</li>
    <li> This was only okay since it proved to be not the best for sensitive skin.  I did notice some tearing from the SPF skin protection that was unexpected.</li>
    <li> After learning about the useless and even harmful additives in most OTC moisturizers, soaps, lotions, etc I discovered the Naked Bee products.  They all smell great,  stay on the skin without stickiness or oilyness or other potentially dangerous or useless side effects.  The sun protection of this product is good and long-lasting as well.</li>
    <li> I am a 35 year old Caucasian.  I have been using Oil of Olay SPF 15 since I was 15. When I was 32, I got on this natural kick and primarily use (and still use) Spectrum Organic Coconut Oil SPF 4.  Since my skin is changing again, I wanted a product to use 2x a day with higher SPF.  This was perfect!  Stumbled upon it on accident, as I had never heard of this Brand before.  Read a few reviews and decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;First off, it SMELLS fantastic!  It&#x27;s nice and light (I tend to have naturally oily skin), this does not make my face feel oily.  I am now using it morning and night. LOVE LOVE LOVE it.  Will be buying more once I run out.</li>
    <li> I take this on vacation as all purpose moisturizer and sun screen.  Meets airline restrictions.  It has a nice scent.</li>
    <li> This stuff is pretty amazing. Makes my face smell great and doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out. I have extremely sensitive and acne-prone skin (I always have pimples), and it&#x27;s nearly impossible for me to find lotion, especially with SPF, that doesn&#x27;t make my acne worse.</li>
    <li> I tried the Naked Bee&#x27;s Daily Facial Moisturizer because my go-to - Jean Charles&#x27;s Lanolin Day Crème with Sunscreen - was out of stock.  My skin musts include natural ingredients and UV ray blocking, so it can be hard to find products meeting my standards.  The fact that this is 70% organic and made in Tennessee makes this moisturizer especially appealing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though I like and recommend this product, it remains my second choice for a daily facial moisturizer.  The scent is nice, but it is strong enough that I store the tube in a zippered cosmetic bag.  The creamy texture feels more like a sunscreen than a moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is an excellent product for sensitive skin, and a good value due to the high quality ingredients.  Based on my overall satisfaction with this moisturizer, I&#x27;m trying the Naked Bee&#x27;s Hand and Cuticle Healing Salve next.</li>
    <li> I love how this feels on the face.</li>
    <li> I LOVE the way this stuff feels on my skin. I would give it 5 stars but seeing as though its supposed to be eco-friendly and organic, its disappointing the company doesn&#x27;t use recycled plastic for its bottle. It uses (4) plastic which is one of the most harmful for the environment.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this for a few days, but I love it so far. It is super moisturizing, but still light. I haven&#x27;t found it to be greasy at all. I love that the ingredients are natural, especially compared to conventional spf moisturizers. I find the smell to be really pleasant. It is noticeable, but not overtly strong, and it does fade after a while.</li>
    <li> This facial moisturizer by Naked Bee is unreal!  For a third the price of what you would pay in the retail stores, it works great, absorbs well, and makes my face feel wonderful!  And it smells amazing!</li>
    <li> I have been using Burt&#x27;s Bees for years but decided to give this a try.  Apparently I have too much estrogen and need to use products without certain estrogen mimicking chemicals. Hard finding my Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s face cream around here.  Like the tube, higher SPF and price much better.  Still getting used to the orange blossom smell. It is OK - but guess I prefer unscented. The smell disappears fairly quickly.  Plus I noticed this product is from TN - my home state. So guess I&#x27;m going Naked from now on.</li>
    <li> This product smells wonderful and moisturizes very well.  I also love that it is organic.I will definitely be buying this again.</li>
    <li> With the exception of a few experiments, I have used Oil of Olay for 30 years, and it has done the job, as I am 62 and have no facial wrinkles.  Still, over the last year, I have been bothered by how it seems to get into my eyes during the day and cause terrible stinging.  So I was looking for something better.  Aveno was a no go for long term use (way too expensive).  Then I tried Naked Bee.  I love it!  The smell is rather intense, but not bad, and it does fade.  The creme is thick, but seems to liquify a bit when it hits your face, so a little goes a long way.  Best of all, if keeps my face soft and comfortable all day and never &amp;#34;melts&amp;#34; into my eyes, even on hot days in Texas.  I have had no break outs.  There have been no negatives to me.  I would prefer for it to be in a pump bottle.</li>
    <li> This product smells great, provides sun protection and has quality ingedients. Sadly it is to oily for me so I cannot use it on my face as was intended but it works well on my neck, chest and arms. I would buy again because of the spf and ingredients but would not use on my face.</li>
    <li> I love the fresh smell that has a snap to the honey flavor.  It soaks in fast and works well on my skin.  I am hooked and pleased to find it easily available on Amazon.  I got the hand and body lotion, lip gloss and face cream.</li>
    <li> Love this. Works great!</li>
    <li> The Vitamin C works wonders on my skin, as far as a daily moisturizer it just is not hydrating enough. I actually pair this with cetaphil moisturizer 1:1 and it works really well!</li>
    <li> a little too heavy and makes my face burn and turn bright red as soon as I apply it. I have used it several times and it does it every time. It may be an allergy but I am not generally a sensitive skin allergic person. It&#x27;s just not right for me.</li>
