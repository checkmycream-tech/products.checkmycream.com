    <li> While I like this product, I was sent old product. I ordered via Primetime Deals. It arrived today and expires in 6 months even though it&#x27;s good for 12mo after opening. I bought the larger 400mL bottle. There is no way I&#x27;ll use it all before it reaches the expiration date. I&#x27;m really frustrated!</li>
    <li> I have been using this leave on conditioner for years. It helps manage frizzy hair. Great quality for a great price.</li>
    <li> This moisture spray does exactly what it says, I have been using it for a few years.</li>
    <li> My 5 yo daugther has curly hair.  I use this every morning to moisturize and brush out tangles.  Works every time!  And smells great!</li>
    <li> I think the product is ok but the packaging could have been better. By the time I received the product, a quarter of the bottle has already leaked out.</li>
    <li> Delivered very fast and the product is wonderful for my hair</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved using this product</li>
    <li> This stuff is great, even if you have fine hair! This is the first product that hasn&#x27;t weighed my hair down. It also adds shine.</li>
    <li> Have used this for years, adds moisture and manageability to my course hair.  Also makes it much more soft than when I do not use it regularly.  Recommend instead of standard conditioners.</li>
    <li> Great product - i have been using this for over 5 years now and it definitely does a great job at keeping my hair soft &amp; silky.</li>
    <li> I opened the cardboard box the bottle was safely packed in.  I then removed the plastic wrap from around the top and nozzle of bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I then put the bottle in my overnight bag.  Once I got to my son&#x27;s home, about 32 miles from mine I sat my bag down on the floor in my grandson&#x27;s room.  Later that night I retrieved the bag to unpack my items.  Everything in my bag was soaked and my newly bought bottle of Conditioner was empty.  I never checked to make sure that the top was screwed down tight.  I just never thought to do it!  That was a huge mistake.  I was so very disappointed.  If you order this, please make sure you check the top to make sure it is secure.  Don&#x27;t trust that the clear plastic is tight, therefore the lid is also.  Good Luck!!</li>
    <li> This product is great!  It smells good and helps with my dry hair.  I will definitely be buying this product again.</li>
    <li> Love this product!!  Have used it for years now.  Buy a few at a time.  I have waist long hair and use the conditioner after washing hair and also when it is dry.  The smell is wonderful.</li>
    <li> The product is really good, though it arrived damaged. I think that it should have a cover on top in order to prevent the spill of the liquid.</li>
    <li> After wasting money on conditioners that didn&#x27;t work- I found this one and it really helps my dry, highlighted, hair.  I am active (including swimming), and wash my hair every day.  This product is great, smell is not too intense.</li>
    <li> If you need to get your hair wet to refresh the look after waking up, this is amazing! It moisturizes and smells great.</li>
    <li> Just bought this product...been using it for about a week now. Luv the smell...works well as a leave in and detangler. will buy again.</li>
    <li> Not a 1st time user for Schwarzkopf hair products and I actually have this leave-in conditioner for many years. This is one of their best leave in conditioners and after prolong use, you will notice the change in your hair. Great for dry weathers, I keep a small bottle of this spray in my bag.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years, I couldn&#x27;t live without it! Was used on my hair at my salon and loved it.</li>
    <li> Cannot say enough about how great this product is!  I have very easily tanlged hair and this product has saved my hair from being ruined!!</li>
    <li> I generally use higher end products in my hair to begin with because of the things I do to it. My stylist actually used this on me when I went in for a trim. I had already washed my hair in the morning and didn&#x27;t put any product in so she could just wet it and trim it. Instead of using water to wet my hair, she used this and it was amazing. Didn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy at all, but soft, I mean really soft, like that of a child. One of my favorite things about this is the sprayer, so easy to use. Some of the leave in conditioners are so hard to handle when your hands are wet, but the way this sprays, it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
    <li> A really good leave in conditioner with just the slightest bit of hold built in.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work like the one I bought at the Salon.  It smells nice, but even the smell is different. It should make combing your hair easy, but it still tangles.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this product for a few years now. This time around, I was very disappointed when using it.  This bottle was not the product that it says it is. Didn&#x27;t smell like the normal product that comes in this bottle. Very disappointed 😔</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hair product. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Best product ever. This is the only product that meltz away my tangles and knots. I use this directly after I shampoo&#x27;d my hair. I have relaxed hair and my hair tangles on a massive scale to the point where I want to cut it off. No conditioner can detangle my hair fast and effectively like this spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please do not take this product of the market and do not change the product in any way. It works like magic on my new growth and enables me to stretch my relaxer for 4-6 months. It actually brings my natural curl out beautifully in my new growth. It obviously won&#x27;t curl your relaxed hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this product for a year a more than a year and loving it. I&#x27;ve tried so many other products to detangle and soften my hair but they just don&#x27;t work as perfect as this product</li>
    <li> Smells great!  It repairs damaged hair.  Don&#x27;t spray too much on your hair or your hair will get greasy.</li>
    <li> This product did not smell or look like it was supposed to. The bottle came dirty and even had hair stuck in the nozzle. Disgusting!!!!</li>
    <li> Great light-weight spray conditioner.  I use it on my granddaughter&#x27;s hair and it works wonderfully and smells soooo good!</li>
    <li> I think the Schwarzkopf products are the best for my hair!&lt;br /&gt;leaves the hair smooth and soft.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It allows my baby fine curly and high-volume hair to behave. The result is always soft curls, no &amp;#34;crunching&amp;#34;, and it smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> Love this for my daughter and my hair, been using it for 2 plus years now and have no complaints.</li>
    <li> My hairstylist uses this on my hair.  I loved how it smelt and took knots out so easily.  Bought it at hair store for 3xs the price.</li>
    <li> I had read that others had gotten this product and the nozzle broke in transit - same thing happened to me. The product is good I suppose, I&#x27;ve been pouring the product in my hand and then trying to distribute it in my hair, so I don&#x27;t get the uniform spray to really tell if the product is good. It was sent loose in a cardboard box with one other product with craft paper wrapped around the bottle, nothing to protect the long nozzle from breaking. I was so busy with Christmas and other things I just didn&#x27;t have time to send it back. I will look for a cheap spray bottle to pour it into.</li>
    <li> Great leave-on conditioner.  Leaves hair shiny and feeling perfectly clean.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hair detangler. I love it because it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;leave-in&amp;#34; product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years to untangle my fine and curly hair.  Someone mentioned it leaves a residue which I hadn&#x27;t noticed before their review.  Since then, I can tell there is a slight residue but it helps in my case by giving my fine hair a bit more body.  I take it with me when I travel.</li>
    <li> Very good, received on time.</li>
    <li> Awesome product for a great price! It smells great and does not weigh down my hair!  I highly recommend this! the product arrived in great packaging no leaks!</li>
    <li> Smells good, not sticky.</li>
    <li> Love the high quality &amp; feel of this product. I am a huge Schwarzkopf fan.</li>
