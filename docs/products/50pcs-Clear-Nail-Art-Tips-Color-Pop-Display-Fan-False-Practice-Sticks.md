      <li>I was looking for a good way to display my nail polish colors and looked at a few options.</li>
      <li>Every other place I&#x27;ve ordered these from comes with the full sized bolt, but now I have to go and buy more bolts.</li>
      <li>Then it’s easy to hold a glitter over the solid color to see what it will look like.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been meaning to get a binder ring type thing for it instead, but it hasn&#x27;t been a very high priority.</li>

      <li>Some plastic nails is broken, but it&#x27;s fine, I liked</li>
      <li>I do a lot of gel polish and it&#x27;s hard to get a good idea of the colors through the bottles.</li>

      <li>with gel: I was really worried that they wouldn&#x27;t work with gel nails.</li>
      <li>Great product, but 6 of mine did come broken</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.  </li>
      <li>a few of mine came broken, and not as nice as I had hoped, but they&#x27;re still great for practice.</li>

      <li>The hole to put these sticks on a ring are nice and large and fit nicely on the larger 3.5&amp;#34; rings I recently purchased while the other swatch sticks I had previously bought had smaller holes and did not fit without forcing them on</li>
      <li>A tad smaller than I expected, but quite nice for the low price.</li>
      <li>They also make it easier to see how a glitter topcoat will look over a certain polish without actually painting your nail.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> These are great! All the sticks are good quality, uniform size, and the polish goes on nice and smoothly. The picture attached here has 50 sticks (I counted) on the included screw.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied; shipping was faster than expected.  Quality item</li>
    <li> Nice product. Have re-ordered twice now as my polish collection just keeps growing! The hole to put these sticks on a ring are nice and large and fit nicely on the larger 3.5&amp;#34; rings I recently purchased while the other swatch sticks I had previously bought had smaller holes and did not fit without forcing them on and then they would not move on their own. These sticks did not have that problem and that&#x27;s why I am giving them 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Arrived with a lot of them cracked and broken.</li>
    <li> I read several reviews that they came broken or with jagged pieces.  Must be luck of the draw, and my luck was bueno.  My product arrived in perfect condition.  Was able to quickly paint my gel colors for display with extra to spare.  Now I just need to purchase more gels...</li>
    <li> I love these clear swatch sticks for my polish collection. It helps me organize them and find the perfect color. I like that they&#x27;re clear so you can place the ones with glitter toppers, etc, over other colors to see how they would look together. I like to keep them organized by color on binder rings. They&#x27;re great to have when you have that growing collection and don&#x27;t want to forget any of the colors you have when they are all packed away and not on display. It is the perfect way to show clients or friends whose nails you&#x27;re going to do what colors you have without having to pull out ALL the bottles. And you really can&#x27;t beat the price! These are a steal and i have ordered quite a few for the ever growing collection!</li>

    <li> These work great for displaying my nail wraps.</li>
    <li> I love these I have these up showing my colors in polish and with gels. they look really great highly recommend these.</li>
    <li> I love these nail swatching sticks for testing polish. These are easy to use and I received these with out any issues and no broken sticks. The nice thing is that you can write on these with a sharpie or permanent marker or like I do use a label maker and label tape to label them. Also you can put these on binder rings or on the little bolt to keep them all together.  All in all a great buy for any nail fanatic , I always make sure to keep some of these on hand.</li>
    <li> They came quickly, quicker than other sellers. But the downside is, I don&#x27;t like using the binder rings to hold these nails together I like using the bolt that comes with it. Well the bolts that come with these only hold about 35 nail sticks not 50 as advertised, and that&#x27;s only if you really squeeze them on. Every other place I&#x27;ve ordered these from comes with the full sized bolt, but now I have to go and buy more bolts.</li>
    <li> I have ordered these before and will continue to order them. They are easy to assemble and very convenient. I work in a nail/hair salon, and with ever changing polish trends its very easy to switch old colors out and bring new colors in.</li>
    <li> worked well for swatching.</li>
    <li> Great product. Just what was said for it to be.</li>
    <li> I loved this nail wheel that i re-bought another one. Best nail wheel ever!</li>

    <li> These are great, thank you! Ordered 3 sets of 50. Most for my current collection and the rest for the polishes I&#x27;ll be making. Arrived pretty quickly even though they came from overseas!</li>
    <li> Okay but shipping took forever and it is VERY cheap quality.</li>
    <li> Some plastic nails is broken, but it&#x27;s fine, I liked</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t wait to start practicing with these! Just got them today!</li>
    <li> I am attempting to organize my my nail polish collection and use swatch sticks like this to keep track of what colors I own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I order this set along with a similar, slightly more expensive set. While I prefer the other set, overall this set is a good product. The plastic is sturdy and none of them were damaged or broken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main complaint is that almost every swatch stick had small, jagged pieces of plastic attached to the &amp;#34;tips&amp;#34;; I suppose left over from manufacturing. I was able to easily file them off with a regular nail file, but it was a bit time consuming. The more expensive set I purchased did not have this issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set came with a long bolt and nut to hold the sticks together, but I prefer to use large binder rings (purchased separately) instead. I order this set from a seller in California and received it in under a week.</li>
    <li> a few of mine came broken, and not as nice as I had hoped, but they&#x27;re still great for practice.</li>
    <li> These are as expected and will help me display my nail wraps from Jamberry</li>
    <li> they came earlier then I thought they would ! also a bit smaller then I thought it&#x27;d be but it&#x27;s great for the price and great for practice .</li>
    <li> Great product, very cheap</li>
    <li> These work great! I use them for my powder pigments so I can tell if they are translucent or opaque.</li>
    <li> If you own a nail laquer salon or a collection that is very much like a salon - that&#x27;s a must. Happy but wondering - maybe 4 packs are not enough.</li>
    <li> Not as sturdy as I thought but they do the job.</li>
    <li> these work great for display and practice. great product</li>
    <li> Love these exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat it for the price! Will really help display my nail wraps perfectly!</li>
    <li> A tad smaller than I expected, but quite nice for the low price. Will order again.</li>
    <li> Love it! Now I don&#x27;t have to have all of my polishes on display.</li>
    <li> Would have given 5 stars if there wasn&#x27;t the screw and bolt missing from one of the sets- otherwise GREAT!</li>
    <li> fast delivery!! perfect for me to display my gel nail colors to my clients!!</li>
    <li> I purchased 1 but 50 came with and ten was completely broken and i was highly upset that I couldn&#x27;t use them and I do a lot of swatches buy they still work find and come in handy.</li>
    <li> I feel like the plastic will break easily but all in all they are a great deal and make for a professional display.</li>
    <li> Love them easy to polish and hold for nail art. Glitter polish shows its true color. Will order again. Fast shipping.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> These are awesome! Great product, but 6 of mine did come broken but hey I&#x27;m not complaining especially for the price! :)</li>

    <li> I was looking for a good way to display my nail polish colors and looked at a few options. I finally settled on this due to price and how easy it is to use. I’m so happy I got this, here’s why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Works with gel: I was really worried that they wouldn&#x27;t work with gel nails. I didn&#x27;t see any reviews saying whether or not they would, but I figured for the price it’s worth a try . Rest assured, they work perfectly with gels. I did it just like I would my own nails, I used a Gelish base, then my color, then a top coat. I did 3 colors at a time to make it go faster. I would say with my Gelish LED light I spent about 1-2 hours total doing them all. Not bad!&lt;br /&gt;-Easy to chose color: I wanted this for two main reasons. When I go to the beauty supply store to buy new colors I often get colors too similar because I forget what’s in my collection. I just take this with me now so I can see easily what I need. Second, when I do my own nails or friends nails, we usually have to open the bottle to look at the colors. The swatch on the outside of the bottle usually isn&#x27;t a good representation. Now we can see at a quick glance all the colors. The name is on the stick part, a Sharpie works fine.  Then it’s easy to hold a glitter over the solid color to see what it will look like. On my glitters I do half with one coat on the plastic nail, ¼ with two coats and ¼ with 3 coats of glitter, so I can see the covers.&lt;br /&gt;- Adding: I have 28 colors on my fan now. I obviously will be adding and taking off over time. In fact, I bought 2 fans just to have extras (and to practice nail art on). This system makes it easy to do that. Some of the other options I was looking at, like a wheel style, aren&#x27;t as flexible. I also plan to do my regular polish colors, but that will take longer for drying time.&lt;br /&gt;-Price: I can’t believe I organized my whole gel collection for less than $3. When I took it to the beauty supply store I had 3 people ask me where I got it and how much. They were surprised that it was so reasonable. It would also be good just to practice designs on for that price. Since I will have quite a few nails left over I plan to do them with various designs I can do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only minor issue is the screw it comes on. Since I’m only using roughly half of the nails there is a lot of extra room. I&#x27;ve been meaning to get a binder ring type thing for it instead, but it hasn&#x27;t been a very high priority. I was debating between white and clear, but am so happy I went with clear. I think it shows the color more realistically how it will look on my nails. Some of the light colors might really look brighter on the white. Overall it is definitely worth the few bucks and I can honestly say “I love it”!!!prised that it was so reasonable. It would also be good just to practice designs on for that price. Since I will have quite a few nails left over I plan to do them with various designs I can do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only minor issue is the screw it comes on. Since I’m only using roughly half of the nails there is a lot of extra room. I&#x27;ve been meaning to get a binder ring type thing for it instead, but it hasn&#x27;t been a very high priority. I was debating between white and clear, but am so happy I went with clear. I think it shows the color more realistically how it will look on my nails. Some of the light colors might really look brighter on the white. Overall it is definitely worth the few bucks and I can honestly say “I love it”!!!</li>
    <li> Bought these for my wife, she likes them she filled her first set in colors and needed more, she placed then on a snap ring and has all sorts of colors easy to put over your nail to see how it looks</li>
