      <li>I&#x27;m glad some are happy with it, but it&#x27;s seems a stretch to call it a \\&quot;foot</li>
      <li>Love It!</li>
      <li>still works amazing.  </li>
      <li>so its nice to relax and have a foot and leg massage when I come home.</li>

      <li>/&gt;Original review, which is curiously no longer posted:&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;arrived today as promised. seems great!</li>
      <li>We both use it every night and we love it.  </li>
      <li>and you&#x27;ll be enjoying the massage.&lt;br /&gt;Keep</li>
      <li>So if you&#x27;re heavy-set, better off getting a foot massager without a calf massager component.</li>
      <li>most are better.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve done the research on many of these products.  </li>
      <li>it was okay while it worked, but after a year of use it broke, and I triedto get parts for it.  </li>
      <li>I bought this And Love it.</li>
      <li>and they love it as do I.  </li>
      <li>we love the Brookstone version much better.  </li>
      <li>My Calves is what aches and hurts the most.</li>
      <li>Hence the soles are what need the most attention.</li>
      <li>nothing more.</li>
      <li>I believe it would help me  more if it went farther up the legs.</li>
      <li>Your mileage may vary but I AM ONE SATISFIED CUSTOMER.</li>
      <li>Massager was ok.</li>
      <li>Next best thing to heaven.  </li>
      <li>I also love the that I can lay in bed with this unit.  </li>
      <li>\\&quot;We commit to provide excellent customer support and will respond to your inquiries as quickly as possible.  </li>
      <li>I work standing up for many hours every day.</li>
      <li>The 3Q MG-C11 Foot &amp; Calf Massager might be one of the most important purchases in my life.  </li>
      <li>Ordered and received very quickly.  </li>
      <li>This is a great product but if you have big calves, you won&#x27;t be able to fit into the massager as intended.</li>
      <li>and once I tried it out and determined it caused more pain than it did a true massage, he emailed the company asking to return it (their policy).  </li>
      <li>It arrived even more quickly than anticipated, allowing for a christmas gift in the stretch...</li>
      <li>It is great for deep muscle pains.</li>
      <li>Got a great deal on this compared to what you&#x27;d get at the mall at Brookstone or something similar.</li>
      <li>I can barely fit my fat calves in this unit but that is not a deterrent.</li>
      <li>It is also very relaxing after a day at work!!!</li>
      <li>Now if I could get my kids to stop enjoying it so much!</li>
      <li>We just got it today and were soo excited to try it.  </li>
      <li>UPDATE to my original review on 2/25/08 (copied below):&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>though I do have to say that the seller was pleasant in taking the item back and was prompt to refund the charges.</li>
      <li>It has yet to be seen if they will offer a full refund given the box already has a corner dented from the shipping out.</li>
      <li>She&#x27;s told me at least once a day since that this was the best gift I&#x27;ve ever got her.</li>
      <li>Not so good on the upper calf</li>
      <li>(it worked for my neighbor who has much shorter legs: I measured the distance from the bottom of my foot to the top of the machine and its 11in.)  </li>
      <li>Mine smelled very strong of new materials.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really big and a person might think it&#x27;s going to work great, but it doesn&#x27;t do much.</li>
      <li>Since I purchased the unit I found many more reviews that echoed the same points I made, as well as a number of complaints regarding the units failing.</li>
      <li>but since we both have arthritic hands and can&#x27;t afford a daily therapist this is the next best thing.    </li>
      <li>Luckily, the delivery got to my house on the day of my husband&#x27;s birthday.</li>
      <li>A quick review below..</li>
      <li>and I am very aware of the difference of the pain levels without the aid of the machine.     </li>
      <li>I give it freely and willingly.</li>
      <li>Overall I am very glad I bought it - worth the miney.</li>
      <li>I can not begin to tell you how much my first session with this unit HURT!</li>
      <li>I sent this as a gift (using the wish list) and it was very well received!!</li>
      <li>I hope you all enjoy it as much as I do.    </li>
      <li>the price was definitely worth it.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s worth the dollar amount.&lt;br /&gt;There</li>
      <li>(smile)  </li>
      <li>I hope someone will be kind enough to let me know.  </li>
      <li>I felt like some of the parts were not inthe right place or got messed up in the shipping.</li>
      <li>Then this is just right for you.</li>
      <li>I am an average size woman with fairly slender feet and ankles.  </li>
      <li>calf and foot massager feel really nice after a long day.</li>
      <li>She can use it laying in bed at the end of the day, and it does twice as good of a foot rub as I used to do in half the time.</li>
      <li>The unit provides a lot of pressure in the calf and foot region as it should but be prepared the grip is very intense.  </li>
      <li>This BEAST has been in my home for one week now (Very fast shipping).</li>
      <li>However: today I ordered another one just exactly like the one I had and am awaiting its arrival.  </li>
      <li>I personally like the smell, but suggest leaving this in your garage or somewhere safe to air out 2-3 days&lt;</li>
      <li>The first time there were tears in my eyes from the pain</li>
      <li>HOWEVER, in the directions they say that in order to recieve a higher calf message you just take your foot out of the bottom and extend them forward allowing your calves to rest inbetween the kneeding</li>
      <li>Of course I&#x27;d love to have it all messaged at the same time</li>
      <li>And will be more careful when buying something like this&lt;br /&gt;Before trying it out first in a store.&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY THIS!</li>
      <li>My husband bought this for me for Christmas based on all the positive reviews.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This company was great, the first shipment came in literally broken and they immediately sent a new one to replace it. It works great, I would like it to be a bit stronger but it serves it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
    <li> I have tired feet and decided that I was in the market for one of these foot massagers.  I had done a ton of research on them before deciding to pull the trigger.  I figured I may as well try one of the lower priced ones first and haven&#x27;t looked back since.  I also love the that I can lay in bed with this unit.  Not all will allow you to do that.  Like I said, stop procrastinating and just order it.</li>
    <li> Got this for my wife for her birthday - she&#x27;s also in her second trimester. She&#x27;s told me at least once a day since that this was the best gift I&#x27;ve ever got her. She can use it laying in bed at the end of the day, and it does twice as good of a foot rub as I used to do in half the time. Everyone loves using it, and the buttons are simple to use. Got a great deal on this compared to what you&#x27;d get at the mall at Brookstone or something similar.</li>
    <li> UPDATE to my original review on 2/25/08 (copied below):&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this Foot and Calf Massager on 2/18/08.  It quit working on 11/22/08, which was nine months after the one-year warranty expired. As per the instruction manual, I tried to contact the Service Centre. The 3Q website [...] states: \\&quot;We commit to provide excellent customer support and will respond to your inquiries as quickly as possible.  All emails will be responded within 24-48 hours expect holidays and weekends.\\&quot;  I emailed them on 11/15/09, but despite their promise of 24-48 hours response time, it has been 12 days (now 11/27/09) and they have not responded.  They also do not answer their telephone, despite the fact that in my message I said I was inquiring about servicing or BUYING a new Foot and Calf Massager.  Bottom line: this Foot and Calf Massager worked fine during the warranty period, but when it broke down after the warranty expired 3Q would not respond to communication attempts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original review, which is curiously no longer posted:&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;arrived today as promised. seems great! like other comments, there was no warranty info included.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000YMVB7K Brand New 3Q MG-C11 Foot &amp; Calf Massager Leg Ankle Massage]]</li>
    <li> I purchased this calf and foot messager after trying one out just like it at the mall for $400!  I was skeptical because of the difference in price and because of the review that mentioned not messaging the calves enough (or high enough).  After recieving the device I tried it out, I too was disapointed the rollers didn&#x27;t go all the way up my calves (it worked for my neighbor who has much shorter legs: I measured the distance from the bottom of my foot to the top of the machine and its 11in.)  HOWEVER, in the directions they say that in order to recieve a higher calf message you just take your foot out of the bottom and extend them forward allowing your calves to rest inbetween the kneeding rollers- and this works GREAT!  I went back to the mall to compare and found that I had to do the same with the $400 one in order the get all of my calf messaged.  Of course I&#x27;d love to have it all messaged at the same time but until they come out with one that has an adjustable height this one works just great!  PS My mom did think it squeezed too hard but her friend liked it.  My suggestion is to find a store (Brookstone?) and see if you can try one out so you don&#x27;t have to deal with returns...</li>
    <li> My feet get painful and my legs heavy by the end of the day so I was looking forward to some relief with this machine.  The calf massager really did not hit the calf muscles well and the foot vibrator did little or nothing for the foot pain.  If I had to do it all over again I would not spend the money as it did not work as well as it was advertised, at least for me.  I have no medical condition, just getting older and foot sore.  I was hoping this could help but the usefullness was minimal compared to the price.</li>
    <li> Works fine but its too big and bulky. It ended up staying in the closet simply because there is no good place to put it.</li>
    <li> The whole family really like it from dad to 7 year old.  only problem is if you are short you have to work to position legs correctly. could do with longer on the up and down calf mode.  recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I use this thing every day after work for an hour and my feet and legs have never felt better!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my husband&#x27;s birthday and it was a hit! The customer service was excellent! I sent an e-mail asking for faster shipping and received a reply right away advising me that the shipping would cost almost as much as the item and they would be shipping first thing the next day. Luckily, the delivery got to my house on the day of my husband&#x27;s birthday. Now if I could get my kids to stop enjoying it so much!</li>
    <li> OMG! This BEAST has been in my home for one week now (Very fast shipping). This MONSTER is big, ugly and smells BAD (Ozone). I can not begin to tell you how much my first session with this unit HURT! This is a reflection of how BAD my feet WERE, I could barely make it through my local market, not even a \\&quot;supermarket\\&quot;, without bad foot pain. If I went to the local Wally-world I would stop at the shoe department and pretend to be trying on shoes just to rest my feet. A 62 year old male with Type II diabetes and considerable nerve damage to my lower spine from a 2005 auto accident, I was not in good shape. Now I want to LIVE in this unit! If it dies one day before or after the warranty I will not hesitate to order another. I can barely fit my fat calves in this unit but that is not a deterrent. I just finished 2 cycles (30 minutes) in it and I had to tear myself away to get on with the day&#x27;s activities. The first time there were tears in my eyes from the pain and now there are tears in my eyes from the joy that it brings me. Thank you 3Q! When I first started researching this type of unit I could barely walk and now I have no problems. No, I was NOT paid for this endorsement. I give it freely and willingly. Your mileage may vary but I AM ONE SATISFIED CUSTOMER.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband for christmas, and let me just say the whole family loves it.  It is so relaxing and calming.  Is very quiet so does not disturb anyone and has multiple settings for viberate and massage and that can be used together or independently.  You will feel like you have new feet!  I would recomend this product to anyone who is on there feet alot, has leg cramps, or just wants a completely relaxing experience at the end of the day.  Love It!</li>
    <li> Got this 3Q MGC11 massager for wife for xmas work for less than 2 months from xmas to early feb. and broke down while she was using. It sqeezed her feet and then stopped working so her feet was stuck in there, had to pry it out.</li>
    <li> Yea.  We just got it today and were soo excited to try it.  The squeezing motion is much much weaker than the Brookstone version... This machine is very average.  You get what you paid for.  At the end of the day it is nice to have something instead of nothing.  This machine is just \\&quot;okay.\\&quot;  PS we love the Brookstone version much better.  We might still go back and get that one.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed in the 3Q Foot/Calf Massager because the kneading discs do not go up the calf, as advertised.  When I asked how to return the product, I was told I had only 7 days and there could not be any damage done to the shipping box, which arrived with a tear on it.  I would be responsible for their $45.00 shipping cost but it only cost me $17.00 to return it in the same manner that it was shipped. I would not recommend this product or the 3Q company and I doubt that only 1 massager is available.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my husband who has arthritis and is always complaining of painful feet.  He hasn&#x27;t complained since the 3Q showed up.  We both use it every night and we love it.  If they made one for shoulders it&#x27;d be really wonderful.      It is relaxing and it does make the aching disappear.  It&#x27;s not the same as a real massage but since we both have arthritic hands and can&#x27;t afford a daily therapist this is the next best thing.    I couldn&#x27;t find a difference between this and the Brookstone--feels the same for half the price.  Definitely recommended.</li>
    <li> I have used this foot and calf massager every day since I purchased it.  It feels really great.  It may squeeze a little too much for some folks.  I purchased it because I have a lot of trouble with my feet and legs.  I can stand for only a very short period of time before I have bad leg  pain.  The foot and calf massager helps.  I believe it would help me  more if it went farther up the legs.</li>
    <li> I bought this And Love it. The one at brookstones may have been a little more comfortable on the bottom of the feet as far as pading. But this was half the price. If this thing last a year or two I will never be without one. Warranty info is on the last page of the user guide. Beware thou if you send it back for warranty work you will have to pay shipping both ways. I thought that was a lame way to stand behind your product. Only had this a few weeks. Will see how long this lasts. I hope this info helps. T</li>
    <li> Ordered and received very quickly.  This was a birthday present for my wife.  Unit is very heavy and the quality appears to be very high end.  My wife loves it and uses it nightly to help releive leg cramps.  The unit provides a lot of pressure in the calf and foot region as it should but be prepared the grip is very intense.  My suggestion is to ware a par of heavy socks or better yet try wrapping leg area with a light towel to give you a little cushion from the rollers as they do their job.  Over all, I would give it a thumbs up.</li>
    <li> Gave the foot massage product to my wife for her birthday present.  It hurt her leg so much that I returned it to 3 Q International, Inc.</li>
    <li> I sent this as a gift (using the wish list) and it was very well received!! It arrived even more quickly than anticipated, allowing for a christmas gift in the stretch...</li>
    <li> I have purchased 3 now, two were gifts for my parents and they love it as do I.  Some may complain that it grips the foot too tightly, but for us, we can&#x27;t get enough of that!  Foot size isn&#x27;t a problem, I&#x27;m a size 12-1/2 and my foot fits in there well.</li>
    <li> Looked at this product type at Brookstone......$399.  Took a chance on this one at about 1/2 the price and works every bit as well.  Very pleased with it&#x27;s performance.  Only question was no warranty came with it.  Had to call the factory to get warranty info.  They should include warranty info with the item.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t believe their hype. Read the real, less favorable reviews. Don&#x27; t make the mi$$take I did. I would assume I&#x27;m not alone in why I purchased this product. At the end of the day the soles of my feet the forefoot, arches and heals are knotted and sore from standing and working. Hence the soles are what need the most attention. This machine in no way addresses this. It&#x27;s pressure nods and vibration are useless for this. It&#x27;s foot massaging action basically knead&#x27;s / smashes your feet from the sides and that&#x27;s it. My feet actually hurt after a few minutes. Maybe they would get stronger or used to it in time, but this shouldn&#x27;t even be an issue. They charge over $40.00 for shipping and if you don&#x27;t like it you have to pay shipping both directions plus they say that packaging has to be perfect even if it got damaged on the way out. I don&#x27;t think this product would have a chance of surviving if it were sold locally where it could be tried out prior to purchase. Much less offer a hassle free return policy. So to be clear if you are looking for a massager that works the reflexology points or the sole, arch and heal area&#x27;s stay far away from this unit, it&#x27;s all but useless for this. This is going to be an $80.00 lesson in what not to buy. I don&#x27;t like to write negative reviews for products, and I tried to work with the company, but I am going to have to eat the shipping in both directions. It has yet to be seen if they will offer a full refund given the box already has a corner dented from the shipping out. I&#x27;m glad some are happy with it, but it&#x27;s seems a stretch to call it a \\&quot;foot massager\\&quot; when it fails to address the most critical area&#x27;s of the foot. PS: Thinking Amazon will get involved in the customer satisfaction process, think again. since it is shipped from the manufacturer all they do is send the letters back and forth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just an update, it cost $53.00 to ship the unit back to 3Q so that will make my loss about $95.00 a lot of money given the situation.Again I would warn people read all the reviews carefully before buying this, The companies description of what to expect is at best optimistic and at worst misleading and inaccurate. Since I purchased the unit I found many more reviews that echoed the same points I made, as well as a number of complaints regarding the units failing.</li>
    <li> This is a great product but if you have big calves, you won&#x27;t be able to fit into the massager as intended. If you&#x27;re heavy-set (like me) you can still use the massager, but you&#x27;ll need to turn it 180 degrees and use the foot massage part. So if you&#x27;re heavy-set, better off getting a foot massager without a calf massager component.</li>
    <li> I bought this massager for my husband for Christmas and he loves it.  I went to Brookstone and the same one was $399, so the price was definitely worth it.  It came in excellent condition and continues to work great to this day.  It is great for deep muscle pains.</li>
    <li> it was okay while it worked, but after a year of use it broke, and I triedto get parts for it.  The manufacture refused to respond to my inquiry regarding parts.  I guess a good rule of thumb is to try to communicate with the manufacture before buying anything, and if that proves difficult, (which it is with 3Q), then you should think twice about purchasing their product.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t get the bottom of your foot as much as I hoped. It is just average and for the price it should be better.</li>
    <li> It was painful. I felt like some of the parts were not inthe right place or got messed up in the shipping. It is an off-brand I believe, and I gave it away to Goodwill. Maybe they can fix it.</li>
    <li> My husband bought this for me for Christmas based on all the positive reviews.  I am an average size woman with fairly slender feet and ankles.  This machine squeezes me so tight, it makes me wince in pain.  After using this for fifteen minutes, I hobble the next day, as if my feet are bruised.  My husband experiences the same pain.  I have tried every setting and different positions and there is no comfort zone with product. I called customer service to see if there was some kind of adjustment to loosen the squeeze and was told \\&quot;no\\&quot;.  My only option is to send it back for a refund... Well, it cost over $45. shipping to get it here and would cost another $45. to return it... After a heated discussion with customer service, the CSR will ask her supervisor to refund my purchase price PLUS my return shipping fee.  I will agree to this, but have to wait for her to email me with their decision.  If they are not agreeable to this, I will enter a claim with my credit card company.  I don&#x27;t know if this is a defective item or not, but I can&#x27;t use it.    UPDATE:  3Q will not even allow me to return this item at all,with OR without shipping. It was purchased on Nov 18 and 3Q has a 30 day return policy.... It doesn&#x27;t matter that this was a Christmas gift and not opened until Dec 25.  My husband is making a claim on his credit card and was told that their return policy doesn&#x27;t matter. The credit card company will send us paperwork and intervene on our behalf to get our return.  BEWARE OF THIS COMPANY !!!!</li>
    <li> My wife loved it but I thought it was to hard on my feet so I guess if you like your feet massaged it is great.&lt;br /&gt;The vibration feels good.</li>
    <li> The 3Q MG-C11 Foot &amp; Calf Massager might be one of the most important purchases in my life.  Both my chiropractor and my podiatrist agree.  With diabetes and circulation problems it will help immensely. When I use it I can feel the massaging and vibrations push the blood.  With numb feet I am hoping it will restore some feeling and improve nerve issues.</li>
    <li> Very nice.  Massages the feet and lower calves excellent.  Not so good on the upper calf - even when you use it as shown/recommended to get the access tot he machine.  Overall I am very glad I bought it - worth the miney.</li>
    <li> I work standing up for many hours every day. This product is just excellent to get the relief I need.</li>
    <li> Nothing beats hands but this one  gets the job done despite being heavy and noisy.&lt;br /&gt;we have had it for almost a year now, and it appears to be durable.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about the quality of this machine.  Next best thing to heaven.  Husband was extatic after being on feet all day he used and loved.</li>
    <li> The description is misleading. The bottom just vibrates, nothing more. I expected my feet to be massaged. The calf massager kind of hurt too. I just wouldn&#x27;t have spent more than $50 for this if I had tried it first.</li>
    <li> When my massager arrived it was cracked very badly. The box had zero damage. The Styrofoam that surrounds the massager is 3 inches thick and had zero damage. This leads me to believe thst I was sent a used item but the shipper blames UPS. If the box and Styrofoam were sent into a forensic scientist&#x27;s lab they would find the same thing I did. It appears that this was previously shipped to someone else that dropped it and then put the broken massager back in the box and returned it, but the returns dept. did not check it and just sold it again. Still waiting for a new one and will let you know how it works.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this foot &amp; calf massager!&lt;br /&gt;We have only had this for about 9 months!&lt;br /&gt;The kneeding part has stopped working although the vibrating part still works.&lt;br /&gt;For the price we paid the whole thing should still work!&lt;br /&gt;We are very disappointed! And will be more careful when buying something like this&lt;br /&gt;Before trying it out first in a store.&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY THIS!</li>
    <li> I bought this product after reading reviews. The product reached me with shipping damage. I contacted the seller and he replaced the product within a week. It is really good product. The only thing I was worried about was its height, but it is sufficient enough to cover your calves. Tall people can adjust by taking toes outside. Overall it gives you the same satisfaction with less price if we compare the expensive ones from Brookstone.</li>
    <li> This product is great!! I am a diabetic and it really does help with my circulation. It is also very relaxing after a day at work!!! I would recommend this product to anyone!! The only problem with it , is that it is heavy and hard to move around.</li>
    <li> I bought this product from 3Q international in November. I had a problem with the machine when I got it, and they immediately shipped me another machine that worked. They even paid for me to ship the product back. Since then whenever I have had a question with the machine they have been very helpful in answering me in a timely manner. The product itself works just as well as the one from Brookstone. I hope you all enjoy it as much as I do.    Jason G.</li>
    <li> I love this product and use it almost everyday. I just wish that it had heat too. I&#x27;m a cashier and am on my feet all day long so its nice to relax and have a foot and leg massage when I come home.</li>
    <li> I purchased this model about 5 years ago and it has worked well since the purchase.  Then the small cord that takes the electricity into the machine pulled out and to my dismay could not find any instructions on repair of the electrical outlet.  I myself checked the machine over and over and there is no way one can repair if something goes wrong.  However: today I ordered another one just exactly like the one I had and am awaiting its arrival.  I am a very brittle diabetic and my feet and lower legs are in constant pain and I take pain medictions around the clock.  However with the use of this machine twice a day while (resting with coffee) the action of the machine reduses the pain in my feet and legs.  When the other one stopped working I could notice a very big difference in my pain levels without the benefit of the massage and was/am taking twice the amount of Vicoden and Lyrica just in order to be able to walk around the house..  I have been without my old one for a week now and I am very aware of the difference of the pain levels without the aid of the machine.     My main complaint is that there is no way that repair on the electrical cord going into the machine cannot be repaired as there is no entrance in the skeleton of the machine to so inside and work on it.  That is bad and the companies should be making this machine with an opening so it can be repaired.  ...75j year old female  Merced California    If I am wrong and the machines can be opened up and the electrical wireing can be repaired I hope someone will be kind enough to let me know.  Then I can have two operating machines.

    <li> I had bought this for my mom as a gift and she enjoyed it for a little over 2 years before the kneading function stopped working. This was a big dissappointment considering the fact that it was used very moderately and the fact that it was fairly expensive. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this thing, you can probably find cheaper and more reliable foot massager out there. And don&#x27;t waste your money on the 2 year warranty because the product is designed to last over 2 years and under 3. I won&#x27;t buy from this manufacturer again nor will I recommend anybody.</li>
    <li> i have had this now for about 4 years. still works amazing.  my wife uses it almost every day.  great buy</li>
    <li> Older folks have less muscle and thinner skin.  The massage was strong enough to make my mom go wide eyed even though it was on the low setting.  though I do have to say that the seller was pleasant in taking the item back and was prompt to refund the charges.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve done the research on many of these products.  most are better.&lt;br /&gt;However none are as inexpensive.  it&#x27;s worth the dollar amount.&lt;br /&gt;There are no bells and whistles but it does what it&#x27;s supposed to.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a bit rough at first but give it 5 minutes and you&#x27;ll be enjoying the massage.&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind, We&#x27;ve only owned it for 30 days.  I&#x27;ll be updating again in 3 months.</li>
    <li> Makes feet feel great I use it twice a day .</li>
    <li> it works well for people will smaller feet and calves.  My feet are size 11 and it squishes/hurts my toes when it massages.</li>
    <li> *Purchased about 1-2 years ago*&lt;br /&gt;The calf and foot massager feel really nice after a long day. Before buying this product, I would recommend trying a calf and foot massager of a family or friend to see if you like it. That&#x27;s how we bought this one. These machines usually give you a THOROUGH rub and might make you feel a little uncomfortable at first. A quick review below.. Cheers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;+ Excellent packaging when it arrived&lt;br /&gt;+ Image exactly fits the physical product&lt;br /&gt;+ Never had any mechanical issues&lt;br /&gt;+ This machine isn&#x27;t afraid to work your sore feet and calves&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Mine smelled very strong of new materials. I personally like the smell, but suggest leaving this in your garage or somewhere safe to air out 2-3 days&lt;br /&gt;- Small fit: If your legs and feet are on the wider side, avoid purchasing this product. I have a thin build and it definitely gives a rough squeeze to the calves</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my mom who is 85. I thought she might like it because her legs tend to hurt. She said she really liked it and it made her feet feel much better.</li>
    <li> Broke down after 2 weeks of use, returned it for refund. Maybe it was just a defective one. Customer service was great, they issued a full refund including shipping. I am very satisfied with there service.</li>
    <li> My husband ordered this product for me and I was highly disappointed, not only in the product, but also with the company.  He bought it as a Christmas present and once I tried it out and determined it caused more pain than it did a true massage, he emailed the company asking to return it (their policy).  Even though he emailed 30 days within the date of receipt and we could have returned it to them within that time period, they said you only have 30 days from date purchased, which is terrible customer service!  I would never do business with this company again!</li>
    <li> Broke down way too soon.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t really do much actually.  It&#x27;s really big and a person might think it&#x27;s going to work great, but it doesn&#x27;t do much.</li>
    <li> Massager was ok. It is a really heavy massager so it doesn&#x27;t slide across the floor which I did like. But what I didn&#x27;t like is, It didn&#x27;t go as high up on my legs as I had hoped. My Calves is what aches and hurts the most. But again, If you need something for your feet... Then this is just right for you.</li>
