      <li>Not wonderful, not the best thing ever, but</li>
      <li>i didn&#x27;t see much change i have tried this product 5 times it isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>

      <li>I researched several products for removing age spots and this one ranked high.  </li>
      <li>It is a slow removing process which is absolutely fine with me.  </li>
      <li>As a facial cream it&#x27;s pretty good, but no effect yet on the spots :(</li>
      <li>Seems a little much to use all the time.</li>

    <li> I am not quite sure how good this product is. I have researched online to find that it works, however, I have not used it long enough to know for sure.</li>
    <li> It did not do anything but moisturize, no skin brightening, no spot fading. I would never use any of their products again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for 1 month exactly (twice/day) and I see absolutedly no difference in my sun spots. As a facial cream it&#x27;s pretty good, but no effect yet on the spots :( I&#x27;ve had them for 6 months and they still look the same. I&#x27;ll finish the tube and see what happens...</li>
    <li> You could use this stuff til the cows come home and it won&#x27;t make a bit of difference in ligntening pigment areas on your face. If anything, it lightens the areas around the pigment spots, so the spots look darker!!&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money. I wish I didn&#x27;t!!</li>
    <li> i didn&#x27;t see much change i have tried this product 5 times it isn&#x27;t worth it. it is over priced, i suggest customers try orgins</li>

    <li> Don not buy this.. it is  a waste of money and it has a very distinct smell that makes me want to throw up.. It does not work at all...</li>
    <li> It works great, could see results almost instantly.</li>
    <li> the product arrived in good condition and complete. The results of their effectiveness have not see them, but I will take weeks to make my skin look even and white.</li>
    <li> not need to wait for a couple of weeks, the results appears in a couple of days, i like it</li>
