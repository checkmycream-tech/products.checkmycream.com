<li> It&#x27;s very subtle yet pretty</li>
<li> It lookers like you have spent a million dollars on your nails.  </li>
<li> I was very disappointed in Silver Sands, because there was practically no glitter in it, but Champagne was exactly what I was looking for - very glittery and shimmery, with glitter that covers the entire nail.</li>
<li> Such a subtle glitter polish.  </li>
<li> I don&#x27;t know if this is a random occurrence, but the bottle leaks all over, I&#x27;ve never had problems with the Gelish brand, just this particular color.</li>
<li> They preform just as well, if not better, than the Gelish polishes.  </li>
<li> Stays on way past 14 days.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not glaring glittery, but a subtle glitter.  </li>
<li> Takes some practice always remember thin coats!</li>
<li> I use it as an accent color to offset a plain base to add some sparkle.</li>
<li> I use the Gelish base and topcoat (IBD is not as durable).  </li>

    <li> Gelish is the best gel on the market for us professionals. Love, love, love!!</li>
    <li> I thought this glitter would be silver but was surprised to find it was gold/yellow when i opened it. The plus it that it goes over any color looking just sparkly which is what i wanted.</li>

    <li> I really like this but the color looks more gold than champagne. I have yet to actually use this but I am very excited about be able to do my gel nails at home. Will save me time and money</li>
    <li> I gave this polish a five star because it is just so pretty.  Just enough sparkle.  You can wear this over another color or wear it alone.  Goes on very nicely.  I would highly recommend this polish for your gel collection.  A must have!!!!</li>
    <li> I love that Gelish is now making gel polish, the colors are awesome and compliment the colors of CND.  This color is great for layering.</li>
    <li> I love this nail polish.  It lookers like you have spent a million dollars on your nails.  I always get a lot of comments when I wear any of the Gelish nail polish.</li>
    <li> Elegant and incredible!!! I use it as an accent color to offset a plain base to add some sparkle. It is a clear, elegant and very small heavily packed sparkle coat. Love it, and happy to have it in a .5cc bottle not the .25 which is all I can get at the store near my home.</li>
    <li> used it once, pretty happy</li>
    <li> I love all the gelish products...I have been getting gel manicures for a while and figured I might want to go ahead and take the plunge and buy some stuff to do it myself. Easy to use...Takes some practice always remember thin coats! This product is a little thinner and does like to pool in the side wall, but nothing a little touching up cant fix. If you are unsure about any of these gelish products, don&#x27;t be! A great way to save money! I got the USPICEY 36watt UV lamp works perfectly cured for 120 seconds for each coat and worked perfect!</li>

    <li> I love this color!  In my opinion Gelish is the best brand out there and this color did not disappoint.</li>
    <li> probably wont be wearing this. thought it would be a prettier champagne color but tis pretty yellow. wouldnt buy.</li>
    <li> This color is amazing, the perfect casual yet fancy sparkle for any occasion. I don&#x27;t know if this is a random occurrence, but the bottle leaks all over, I&#x27;ve never had problems with the Gelish brand, just this particular color. Also, it looks really yellow in the bottle, don&#x27;t worry, it dries silver-white.</li>
    <li> Love the color! Best friend is getting married and her color scheme is champagne, black and pink. Color will go great with outfit</li>
    <li> Such a subtle glitter polish.  Absolutely beautiful.  I use it as an overcoat on a darker color.  It&#x27;s not glaring glittery, but a subtle glitter.  I adore this polish.</li>
    <li> Closer to silver glitter, beautiful color!</li>
    <li> GREAT QUALITY, A+,item as described.</li>
