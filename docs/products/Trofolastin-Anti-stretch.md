### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I&#x27;m one happy mother.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t do anything to existing marks, but it felt good to be &amp;#34;doing something&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>Genetics are also not on my side as my fair skinned mother was covered in stretch marks after having 2 kids.</li>
      <li>I also liked that it was from Novartis and not the drug store.</li>
      <li>It smells good and it is easy to use it.</li>
      <li>had I not used this product I am sure of it.</li>
      <li>:) This stuff works and it&#x27;s studies have been scientifically peer reviewed and confirmed that it is effective.</li>
      <li>I wish it were better known and more readily available in the US.</li>
      <li>I looked up all the ingredients on EWG and they are clean and safe to use.</li>
      <li>It is very consistent and its price is OK.</li>
      <li>I have used this product through 2 pregnancies and managed to come out of them almost stretch-marks free, except for one week when I went on vacation and forgot to take the cream with me.</li>
      <li>the primary endpoint was a decrease in stretch mark formation.</li>
      <li>so I was fearfull of the heridity factor, but so far so good.</li>
      <li>I have very fair, tight skin</li>
      <li>Below is a citation from EWG website about parabens and the full ingredient list...</li>
      <li>However, to be fair, we do not know if parabens cross the placenta.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend, but make sure to reorder BEFORE you start running out.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It goes on quickly and is easily absorbed and has not caused my skin to breakout.</li>
      <li>I also believe that a healthy diet and normal weight gain throughout pregnancy is also a must for success.</li>
      <li>I used this with my first pregnancy from the time I was about 7 months pregnant until my son was born.  </li>
      <li>right.  </li>
      <li>( i did not use the postpartum creme after my first baby).</li>
      <li>I used this cream throughout my pregnancy and it absolutely worked!</li>
      <li>It did keep my skin soft and itch free.</li>
      <li>It worked for my wife on the first pregnancy.</li>
      <li>and i definetly feel its firmer that it was 7 weeks after my first baby.</li>
      <li>I wish it didn&#x27;t have such a strong fragrance, but if it works I&#x27;m willing to forget that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s positive research.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how much faith I put into any of these creams, but I did have higher hopes for this one</li>
      <li>That is how I know this stuff really worked.  </li>
      <li>There is much that scientists DON&#x27;T know about how the body reacts to parabens.</li>
      <li>I bought this item because it was the only one that shows statistically significant clinical outcomes for preventing stretch marks.</li>
      <li>I am currently 39 weeks pregnant with my first child and so far no signs stretch  marks.</li>
      <li>I advise all pregnant women to thoroughly research products especially ones coming from another country before using it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Update: second child  3-4-2013 I also used this cream with and remain stretch mark free at 35 years old</li>
      <li>I read a ton of research and this product came highly recommended.  </li>
      <li>(f my first pregnancy) once daily and got NO stretch marks.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t get any stretch marks with my first pregnancy, and started getting them at the start of my second trimester with this baby.  </li>
      <li>I ordered this because It worked during my first pregnancy and has been working so far during my second one!</li>
      <li>Public health experts have been particularly concerned about the longer chain parabens -- butylparaben, isopropylparaben, isobutylparaben and propylparaben -- because studies have shown that they can mimic the hormone estrogen and disrupt normal function of the hormone system.  </li>
      <li>This review is solely based on my professional opinion as a Pharmacist.</li>
      <li>Sure enough, that week I did get a couple of small marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was sold on this product after finding out that it&#x27;s made by Novartis (a real drug company) and is the only product that has been proven to PREVENT stretch marks in actual pharmaceutical studies.  </li>
      <li>I continued to use it once a day after delivery and it readily got rid of the tiny stretch marks I got that last day.</li>
      <li>My second baby is 7 weeks old and i am currently using the postpartum creme on my belly</li>
      <li>and I have only 1 tiny stretch mark near my belly button.</li>

<li> This stuff is the only stretch mark cream with double blinded placebo controlled research behind it.  </li>
<li> Used this everyday day during pregnancy and don&#x27;t have one single stretch mark.</li>
<li> Previous studies have found that parabens can cause skin irritation, allergic reactions, reproductive health problems and cancer, depending on the form of paraben.</li>
<li> I have written out the ingredient list as a reference for others as it is not available anywhere online, even on the spain novartis website.</li>
<li> I recommend it, though it is too soon to talk about resoults, because I bought it a few days ago.</li>
<li> (Sad!)  </li>
<li> \\&quot;What&#x27;s so bad about parabens?  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have used this product through 2 pregnancies and managed to come out of them almost stretch-marks free, except for one week when I went on vacation and forgot to take the cream with me. Sure enough, that week I did get a couple of small marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend using it from your second trimester on an extended area (not only belly, but also hips, thighs and breasts) and continuing through lactation period (if breast feeding) on breast area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend switching to the specific product for breasts after delivery, since concentration of active principle is lower and it does not work as well.</li>
    <li> This product works. i used it during my two pregnancies and i did not get a single stretch mark. it might be due to genettics as my mum did not have stretch marks though my two sisters did. My second baby is 7 weeks old and i am currently using the postpartum creme on my belly and i definetly feel its firmer that it was 7 weeks after my first baby. ( i did not use the postpartum creme after my first baby).</li>
    <li> I am currently 39 weeks pregnant with my first child and so far no signs stretch  marks. I bought this product because it is the only product that has actual research behind it, and its even in the Chochran Review for research. I was convinced based off the research alone. I also believe that a healthy diet and normal weight gain throughout pregnancy is also a must for success. My mother has stretch marks so I was fearfull of the heridity factor, but so far so good. I have one week to go so I will update if things change. I would buy it again because not getting stretch marks is priceless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I had my baby 7 days ago and still streatch mark free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: second child  3-4-2013 I also used this cream with and remain stretch mark free at 35 years old</li>
    <li> The number one brand to take care you skin. My sister also used this product when she was expecting twins 2 years ago, she recommended me this cream, is no sticky and it works!!</li>
    <li> I used this with my first pregnancy from the time I was about 7 months pregnant until my son was born.  I&#x27;m now ordering it again for baby number two.  I had not stretch marks at all and I was worried I would get them since my mother and grandmother did...Anyway, I&#x27;m hoping for the same result with baby number two!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I used it from my second trimester (f my first pregnancy) once daily and got NO stretch marks. Maybe it&#x27;s genetic, maybe it&#x27;s Trofolastin. Not going to find out! My belly looks like before I had kids, whereas my friends ones the skin looks saggy and stretch mark rippled.</li>
    <li> Currently 33 weeks without any stretchmarks. I wish it didn&#x27;t have such a strong fragrance, but if it works I&#x27;m willing to forget that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on quickly and is easily absorbed and has not caused my skin to breakout. Will continue to use and cross my fingers.</li>
    <li> I was sold on this product after finding out that it&#x27;s made by Novartis (a real drug company) and is the only product that has been proven to PREVENT stretch marks in actual pharmaceutical studies.  I&#x27;ve used it all through my 2nd and 3rd trimester.  I have very fair, tight skin and I have only 1 tiny stretch mark near my belly button. This stretch mark showed up when the seller was out of stock, so I only used a minimal amount of product until I received another shipment.  Genetics are also not on my side as my fair skinned mother was covered in stretch marks after having 2 kids. Highly recommend, but make sure to reorder BEFORE you start running out.</li>
    <li> I used this starting in my first trimester.  and put it all over my stomach except for one small area at the bottom right.  Even though I have stretch marks other places on my body I didn&#x27;t get one stretch mark through my entire pregnancy. However, after I had the baby and stopped using this product.  I did get a stretch mark in the area that I did not put the cream.  That is how I know this stuff really worked.  I would have had stretch marks all over my stomach had I not used this product I am sure of it.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get any stretch marks with my first pregnancy, and started getting them at the start of my second trimester with this baby.  I read a ton of research and this product came highly recommended.  I&#x27;ve been using the cream twice a day for a month and have quite a few new marks.  (Sad!)  I don&#x27;t know how much faith I put into any of these creams, but I did have higher hopes for this one and it&#x27;s positive research.</li>
    <li> It smells good and it is easy to use it. It is very consistent and its price is OK. I recommend it, though it is too soon to talk about resoults, because I bought it a few days ago.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years on my face ! No wrinkles !!!</li>
    <li> I lived in Madrid for 7 years... Some spanish friends told me about this product and I couldn´t be happier! I used this cream during two pregnancies and no stretch marks at all!! (Tip: Use it also in breasts!)</li>
    <li> Used this everyday day during pregnancy and don&#x27;t have one single stretch mark.</li>
    <li> Do not hesitate buying this.. I gained 45 lbs in my pregnancy. One tiny stretch mark..  I&#x27;m one happy mother.</li>
    <li> This review is solely based on my professional opinion as a Pharmacist. I have not used this product so I cannot speak for its effectiveness.  I bought this item because it was the only one that shows statistically significant clinical outcomes for preventing stretch marks. The cochrane review did not evaluate the safety and long term effects of Trofolastin. the primary endpoint was a decrease in stretch mark formation. This product contains 2 concerning long chain parabens, buytlparaben and propylparaben, that MAY do harm to the fetus. However, to be fair, we do not know if parabens cross the placenta. There is a proposed study but it is not completed as of yet... funding issue maybe. Also, Trofolastin is considered a cosmetic item (even though its made by novartis) and is not regulated by the FDA. I have written out the ingredient list as a reference for others as it is not available anywhere online, even on the spain novartis website. I advise all pregnant women to thoroughly research products especially ones coming from another country before using it. Below is a citation from EWG website about parabens and the full ingredient list... the things in parenthesis are my additions.    \\&quot;What&#x27;s so bad about parabens?  Previous studies have found that parabens can cause skin irritation, allergic reactions, reproductive health problems and cancer, depending on the form of paraben. Public health experts have been particularly concerned about the longer chain parabens -- butylparaben, isopropylparaben, isobutylparaben and propylparaben -- because studies have shown that they can mimic the hormone estrogen and disrupt normal function of the hormone system.  There is much that scientists DON&#x27;T know about how the body reacts to parabens. But consumers don&#x27;t need to wait for definitive conclusions  you can (and should!) read labels carefully and vote with your pocketbook. That way, you&#x27;ll protect your family and help shift the market towards safer products.\\&quot;  ttp://www.ewg.org/enviroblog/2010/11/common-cosmetics-ingredient-can-harm-sperm    INGREDIENTS:  water, triticum vulgare (wheat oil), sorbitol, caprylic/capric triglyceride,cetearyl alcohol, sodium cetearyl sulphate, propylene glycol, lanolin, centella asiatica (gotu kola), hydrolized collagen, hydrolized elastin, asiaticoside (stimulates collagen), asiatic acid (another form of gotu kola), madecassic acid (stimulates collagen synthesis), phenoxyethanol, methylparaben, butylparaben, ethylparaben, propylparaben, propylene glycol, B.H.T.

    <li> I ordered this because It worked during my first pregnancy and has been working so far during my second one!</li>
    <li> I used this cream throughout my pregnancy and it absolutely worked! I literally got only a couple tiny stretch marks on the day I was in labor. Up until then I had none. I continued to use it once a day after delivery and it readily got rid of the tiny stretch marks I got that last day. :) This stuff works and it&#x27;s studies have been scientifically peer reviewed and confirmed that it is effective. It is the only one that has that. I looked up all the ingredients on EWG and they are clean and safe to use. I wish it were better known and more readily available in the US.</li>
    <li> I mean, do any of these creams really work? It did keep my skin soft and itch free. It didn&#x27;t do anything to existing marks, but it felt good to be &amp;#34;doing something&amp;#34;.

    <li> This stuff is the only stretch mark cream with double blinded placebo controlled research behind it.  It worked for my wife on the first pregnancy.</li>
