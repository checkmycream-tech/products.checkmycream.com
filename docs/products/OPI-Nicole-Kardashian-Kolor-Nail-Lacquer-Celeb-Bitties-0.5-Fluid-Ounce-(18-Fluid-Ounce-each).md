    <li> I would highly recommend this product. The polish lasts long and is very pretty when applied. I love the smaller bottles so that I don&#x27;t waste any.</li>
    <li> Ended up loving this polish so much it is now my go to first nail polish. Drys fast and polish lasts for almost a week.</li>
    <li> Just received this today. Delivery on time. I bought this for my daughter&#x60;s birthday and she loves it. She loves OPI and Kardashians. I tried on Sealed with a Kris and it is really pretty.  I&#x27;m glad I bought this. Bottles are very tiny, very tiny. I have never seen bottles so tiny. I recently bought the Muppets mini set and these bottles are tinier then the Muppets set. Otherwise reading would have been five stars.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my daughter for the holidays and she loved the colors.  They stayed on and didn&#x27;t peel off. Great price point also.</li>
    <li> The size works: just enough to enjoy a shade before boredom sets in. It&#x27;s the quality that sucks. Way too sheer. Who has time to do three layers JUST to start looking like you&#x27;ve got nail polish on. OPI needs to thicken up their polishes. It&#x27;s like cheap perfume you have to spray 5 times a day just to keep smelling good. Nope.</li>
    <li> Very nice colors. They apply decently despite horrible brush! I can&#x27;t really recommend because it is not easy to apply.</li>
    <li> Although they are so small, I like the colors so much</li>
    <li> Is mini size, the colors are great for anny ocassion.&lt;br /&gt;The prouct arrived in perfect conditions, its a good product.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted thanks!! Very beautiful colors and it was exactly what I was looking for !! Can&#x27;t wait to use them</li>
    <li> I loved them, at first. But all of the colors seem to chip off really easy and quick. I like the colors...but the bottles are so small, you can really only get 3 nail paintings out of each bottle. I guess they are really just SAMPLE sizes, so that you can decide if you really want to spend $8 on the full size bottle. Personally, I don&#x27;t think I would spend $8 for a nail polish that chips off after one day of wearing it.</li>
    <li> Shipment arrived much sooner than I expected and in excellent choice condition! Pretty good bundle and reasonably priced. I underestimated the size of each bottle, but my niece had no complaints. Great buying experience without a doubt.</li>
    <li> GREAT COMBINATION OF SHADES OF POLISH.  HER GIFT HASN&#x27;T BEEN GIVEN YET, BUT SHE LIKES VASRIETY AND MANY OF THE SAME THINGS AS HER SISTERS-IN-LAW.</li>
    <li> i liked these very cute and work very good ... just what i wanted thank you!!!! cant wait to order again</li>
    <li> This collection is young, flirty and fun. The wear on it is great with just two coats and a topcoat. No problems with chipping, very happy with all of them!</li>
    <li> The friend I got this for is a big Kardashian fan and loves doing her nails! You could say I nailed it!</li>
    <li> Nice classic colors with a modern touch! Would recommend it to all. Love all the colors in this beautiful package!</li>
    <li> Nice combo of colors!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these minis! The colores are great as well as the quality! My fav is the Seal it with a Kriss!</li>
    <li> Well I really love this four mini bottle set but its not quite enough nail polish to last me. And I really don&#x27;t doo my nails a lot ................ ok I do :-)</li>
    <li> I was very happy with this product! I had seen it in stores and couldn&#x27;t find it and wanted to get it as a gift for someone and managed to find it here! The packaging was on and in tact unlike most sellers who sell these opi minis. All the colors were in the correct order and the price wasn&#x27;t bad for this product. It also arrived in a timely fashion. I was very happy with it!</li>
    <li> Well I seen this product, I had to have it begin I love pink , beautiful colors the down side it does stay long on ur nails I love nail polish that last weeks not hours. :(</li>
    <li> Great colors and surprised how pigmented these little nail polishes are. I keep one at work for chipped nail polish.</li>
