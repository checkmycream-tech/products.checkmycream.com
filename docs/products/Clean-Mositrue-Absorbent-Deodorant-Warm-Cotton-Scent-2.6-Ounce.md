### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great scent!  </li>
      <li>It does not provide very good protection.</li>
      <li>Everyone says , you smell so good !</li>
      <li>I read good reviews for this item and decided to give it a shot,but I wasn&#x27;t too impressed.</li>
      <li>It smells great putting it on but it does not work as a deodorant.</li>
      <li>The seller was great.  </li>
      <li>Scent is great, does not overwhelm you.  </li>
      <li>Yes, the scent is nice, for a bit, but when it wears off, it is not too pleasant.</li>
      <li>Product is authentic and as described!</li>
      <li>nice smell</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t mind applying something that is better for me a couple of times a day, instead of something that is not so good just once.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping, great value!</li>
      <li>It smells so clean , it is amazing !</li>
      <li>At first you think, oh this stuff smells great.  </li>
      <li>Love the smell wish the fragrance was stronger</li>
      <li>Smells great but doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
      <li>Fell in love with the scent while using the perfume.</li>
      <li>but this works better than anything else I have tried.</li>
      <li>When I got the product, I fell in love with the scent.</li>
      <li>smells great and works well for days that I&#x27;m not expecting to sweat much.</li>
      <li>The cotton scent was very strong, but when I did a quick funk check (hey, don&#x27;t act like you don&#x27;t do it too!)</li>
      <li>There are a lot of aluminum free deodorants out there</li>
      <li>so I can use it and match my perfume, so as for now I am not wearing the perfume or the deodorant until it can be applied smoothly.</li>
      <li>Was excited to see a deodorant however it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>I was so excited to try this deodorant when I read the reviews.</li>
      <li>Stick to lotions and perfumes for the Clean line, don&#x27;t buy the deodorant.</li>
      <li>I have been looking for an effective natural deodorant for quite some time.  </li>
      <li>I also felt lots of wetness--almost more than normal!</li>
      <li>After trying many natural deodorants, I finally found one they smells good and does the job.  </li>
      <li>I was very excited to find this stick deodorant WITHOUT aluminum (a rare find) as it&#x27;s main ingredient.  </li>
      <li>Since I am a big fan of the Clean&#x27;s Warm Cotton scent, it is nice to have deodorant with the same scent.</li>
      <li>The cotton scent smells like freshly washed laundry.</li>
      <li>At the end off a 9 hr work day noone smells fresh</li>
      <li>The idea of cottonseed absorbing sweat seemed really cool.</li>
      <li>I really like that it does not contain aluminum, and it seems to work as good as any other that I have tried...</li>
      <li>Really don&#x27;t want aluminum in my deodorant!  </li>
      <li>Overall I am really pleased with this product.</li>
      <li>It feels and smells exactly like drier sheets infused into some sort of oil.</li>
      <li>Not sure if it would work in a humid area but to have no aluminum is good for your body.</li>
      <li>I live in Southeast Texas where the weather is very tropical and often very hot.  </li>
      <li>I was very self-conscious all day.</li>
      <li>It really does smell like cotton.  </li>
      <li>but you have to really scub with it to get it on</li>
      <li>Really wanted it to.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sorry that this product didn&#x27;t work out for me because it smells so darn good!</li>
      <li>I am a big &#x27;Clean&#x27; customer.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of natural deodorants, and this is the first one that has truly worked.</li>
      <li>Many other natural deodorants fail short but Clean Moisture Absorbent Deodorant works great.  </li>
      <li>I had high hopes for this product</li>
      <li>I normally don&#x27;t want to use those products though, so</li>
      <li>It smells like clean clothes right out of the dryer, which can be a little strange at first.  </li>
      <li>I have only had it a couple of weeks, and thus have not tried it in hot weather; but having done some vigorous workouts</li>
      <li>however it seriously smells exactly like Clorox Disinfectant Wipes, which I do love for cleaning by the way, but definitely not for a body scent!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve decided that natural deodorant just doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>I definitely paid too much for this.</li>
      <li>I tried the deodorant a few more times and got the same result.</li>
      <li>This product doesn&#x27;t smell good, is not pleasant to apply, doesn&#x27;t do its job remarkably well, and leaves a grease behind that is difficult to wash off in the shower.</li>
      <li>It may be my body chemistry, but I found that after about 3 hours the scent (which is, indeed, a clean, fresh scent) turns into one that is unpleasant and offensive.  </li>

<li> I have it still only because I am hoping that it will be open long enough to soften it up</li>
<li> Typically they are not very effective for controlling sweat and wear off quickly.  </li>
<li> like I do my other deodorant (this is for long lasting freshness and zero funk), but that made the deodorant even more difficult to apply.</li>
<li> It does seem to go on kind of rough/dry, but it&#x27;s not too bad.  </li>
<li> You do not feel wet after you put it on, which is a big plus as well.</li>
<li> It keeps me dry throuout the day and keeps odor at bay in the Florida heat.  </li>
<li> Bit expensive but worth trying it.  </li>
<li> The product arrived as expected.  </li>
<li> But this did not smell like anything that I expected.</li>
<li> Then a few hours later the scent combines with your BO to make a scent unlike any other made in nature.  </li>
<li> It seems to keep me dry for a little bit longer.</li>
<li> Just like any other average deodorant...</li>
<li> Not worth almost $20.</li>
<li> It is very dry and the deordorant itself is hard as a rock.</li>
<li> The product is a thick, solid deodorant and rather rough and difficult to apply.</li>
<li> very difficult to use, it feels like you left the lid on when you apply.</li>
<li> Once I applied the deodorant and went on about my day, I was confused.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not perfect, and of course it doesn&#x27;t work as well as anti-perspirants that contain aluminum.</li>
<li> I smelled worse with it than without it!</li>
<li> Expensive</li>
<li> But when you do start to sweat it smells REALLY bad.</li>
<li> I am disappointed after using this product for a week because it just doesn&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
<li> , I smelled awful!</li>
<li> but I feel like I smell disgusting toward the end of the day when I wear this deodorant.  </li>

I have only had it a couple of weeks, and thus have not tried it in hot weather; but having done some vigorous workouts, I can report it holds up quite well.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product but it just didn&#x27;t work for me.  I used it for a week and it did not control odor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for about 4 days now. It seems to keep me dry for a little bit longer. But when you do start to sweat it smells REALLY bad. At the end off a 9 hr work day noone smells fresh but I feel like I smell disgusting toward the end of the day when I wear this deodorant.  Not worth almost $20.</li>
    <li> I live in Southeast Texas where the weather is very tropical and often very hot.  I have been searching for a Deodorant that does not contain aluminum.  Many other natural deodorants fail short but Clean Moisture Absorbent Deodorant works great.  Since I am a big fan of the Clean&#x27;s Warm Cotton scent, it is nice to have deodorant with the same scent.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews, but thought I would try it.  Really don&#x27;t want aluminum in my deodorant!  But it didn&#x27;t work at all.  Really wanted it to.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to find this stick deodorant WITHOUT aluminum (a rare find) as it&#x27;s main ingredient.  I am disappointed after using this product for a week because it just doesn&#x27;t work for me.  It may be my body chemistry, but I found that after about 3 hours the scent (which is, indeed, a clean, fresh scent) turns into one that is unpleasant and offensive.  Like I said, it may just be my body chemistry, but I cannot continue to wear this product with confidence that it will keep odor under control.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for an effective natural deodorant for quite some time.  Typically they are not very effective for controlling sweat and wear off quickly.  Not this stuff.  It really does smell like cotton.  It smells like clean clothes right out of the dryer, which can be a little strange at first.  It is not overpowering though and it actually lasts all day and helps control perspiration. It does seem to go on kind of rough/dry, but it&#x27;s not too bad.  Overall I am really pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> Love the smell wish the fragrance was stronger</li>
    <li> There are a lot of aluminum free deodorants out there but this works better than anything else I have tried. You do not feel wet after you put it on, which is a big plus as well.</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t smell good, is not pleasant to apply, doesn&#x27;t do its job remarkably well, and leaves a grease behind that is difficult to wash off in the shower. It feels and smells exactly like drier sheets infused into some sort of oil.</li>
    <li> Expensive and it sucked I smelled worse with it than without it!</li>
    <li> After trying many natural deodorants, I finally found one they smells good and does the job.  It keeps me dry throuout the day and keeps odor at bay in the Florida heat.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great scent!  Was sceptical but wanted a product with no aluminum in it.  It does work!  Scent is great, does not overwhelm you.  Bit expensive but worth trying it.  Not sure if it would work in a humid area but to have no aluminum is good for your body.</li>
    <li> very difficult to use, it feels like you left the lid on when you apply. nice smell but you have to really scub with it to get it on</li>
    <li> smells great and works well for days that I&#x27;m not expecting to sweat much.</li>
    <li> The seller was great.  The product arrived as expected.  However, I don&#x27;t like this scent at all, neither does my daughter.  I ended up giving it as a Christmas gift to my mother.  I am a big &#x27;Clean&#x27; customer.  But this did not smell like anything that I expected.</li>
    <li> Fell in love with the scent while using the perfume. Was excited to see a deodorant however it doesn&#x27;t work. It smells great putting it on but it does not work as a deodorant. Stick to lotions and perfumes for the Clean line, don&#x27;t buy the deodorant.</li>
    <li> I bought this so that my perfume and pwder would all match, even with my deordoant! I bought it as soon as I saw it on sale. My problem came when I was appling it. It is very dry and the deordorant itself is hard as a rock. I even tried to put it under the faucet to maybe &#x27;loosen it up&#x27; but it is still actually unusable. I have it still only because I am hoping that it will be open long enough to soften it up so I can use it and match my perfume, so as for now I am not wearing the perfume or the deodorant until it can be applied smoothly.</li>
    <li> At first you think, oh this stuff smells great.  Then a few hours later the scent combines with your BO to make a scent unlike any other made in nature.  It burns your nose and makes your eyes water.  And I paid $18.  I&#x27;ve decided that natural deodorant just doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, great value! Product is authentic and as described!</li>
    <li> I really like that it does not contain aluminum, and it seems to work as good as any other that I have tried...however it seriously smells exactly like Clorox Disinfectant Wipes, which I do love for cleaning by the way, but definitely not for a body scent!</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try this deodorant when I read the reviews. The idea of cottonseed absorbing sweat seemed really cool. When I got the product, I fell in love with the scent. The cotton scent smells like freshly washed laundry. The effectiveness of the product, however, is a totally different story. The product is a thick, solid deodorant and rather rough and difficult to apply. Once I applied the deodorant and went on about my day, I was confused. The cotton scent was very strong, but when I did a quick funk check (hey, don&#x27;t act like you don&#x27;t do it too!), I smelled awful! It was like sweaty pits mixed with Downy. I also felt lots of wetness--almost more than normal! I was very self-conscious all day. I tried the deodorant a few more times and got the same result. I also tried to dip it in a bit of baking soda like I do my other deodorant (this is for long lasting freshness and zero funk), but that made the deodorant even more difficult to apply. I&#x27;m sorry that this product didn&#x27;t work out for me because it smells so darn good!</li>
    <li> It smells so clean , it is amazing ! Everyone says , you smell so good !</li>
    <li> It does not provide very good protection.</li>
