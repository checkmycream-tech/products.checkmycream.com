      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>If I just want a boost this is amazing.</li>
      <li>Kind of clinical.  </li>
      <li>I hope I have more and more good things recommended to them.</li>
      <li>It leaves my skin healthy and glowing and feels absolutely amazing on my face.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I do notice that my skin feels much more moisturized after this mask is processed on my face.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s OK.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
      <li>Turning 40 and this and the multivitamin eye care is my favorite</li>
      <li>My favorite line in skincare</li>
      <li>I love Dermalogica products.  </li>
      <li>Really, the effect after the face is very good, very suitable for dry skin use.</li>
      <li>I find it is absorbed best when used with a facial steamer.  </li>
      <li>This is the best, your skin is so soft, with a nice glow, I look younger</li>
      <li>I have used this brand before and it is very good specially for dry skin like mine.</li>
      <li>Great product overall though!</li>
      <li>Used this product for a very long time and it&#x27;s great.</li>
      <li>I simply clean my face, apply the mask, and leave it on overnight.  </li>
      <li>Great mask to use weekly for dry skin.  </li>
      <li>Find it very hydrating and a love it.</li>
      <li>and there have been several, I definitely like this the best!  </li>
      <li>I have no idea where all of these good reviews are coming from because this product is using irritating plant extracts as well as the potent menthol derivative menthoxypropanediol which most definitely will not benefit any skin type, and most certainly not sensitive skin which I&#x27;m guessing most people who look for these kind of products</li>
      <li>Have not bought a friend, do not hesitate, it is worth to try.</li>
      <li>Well worth the cost as I no longer need laser spot removal as I thought.</li>
      <li>company is big and, so, when considering a company who has a lot of resources and capital to be able to fund extremely well designed advertising schemes one should consider if the product is actually good</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>I was expecting more instant results given the hype about the product.</li>
      <li>My steamer is Professional Table Top Facial Steamer  by Satin Smooth.  </li>
      <li>Its exactly what is used in spas but at home.  </li>
      <li>The mask smelled strong and kind of alcoholic, and I didn&#x27;t feel too much difference after washing it away.</li>
      <li>I have been hesitant to branch out and try anything new because I have found a few holy grail products that make my face so happy.</li>
      <li>Only down fall - the fact that it turns my face orange like an ompa loompa, lol.</li>
      <li>pure night lightening cream&lt;br</li>
      <li>Recommended to a lot of friends around, they used to say very praise after.</li>
      <li>This product really leaves my skin softer and looking healthier.</li>
      <li>Since I thought it would really help my skin</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t tell much of a difference using it though.</li>
      <li>So highly scented I had to wash it off immediately!  </li>
      <li>am using this product along with a bunch of other dermatologica products for my everyday routines and can honestly say I am seeing great results, but am not sure if they can be attributed to this particular product or the whole suit of them.</li>
      <li>It is more creamy and less &#x27;masque-y&#x27;.</li>
      <li>If my skin is particularly dehydrated (from flying, or sun)</li>
      <li>Definitely gives the skin a quick pick me up when needed.</li>
      <li>I worked in a high end beauty store and have worked with and sold Dermalogica for years.</li>
      <li>But, I do still battle dryness and sometimes want to look a little more polished.</li>
      <li>Although its packing was not good, the mask is effective.</li>
      <li>As a pro stylist and skin care expert I must say this is a  wonderful mask for dull looking tired skin.</li>
      <li>Leaves face feeling soft and hydrated</li>
      <li>Nearly every skincare product causes redness, hives, burning or itching.</li>
      <li>I have ridiculously sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Gives my skin a young dewy look.</li>
      <li>Good for dry, sensitive &amp; tired skin.</li>
      <li>Any topical skin product can do only so much.</li>
      <li>so, when I removed ALL of their products did my face finally start getting back to normal.</li>

    <li> UPDATE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still use this when I feel too dry or after chemical peels. It is more creamy and less &#x27;masque-y&#x27;. Sometimes I forget to wash it off and it feels like an ultranourishing cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OLDER REVIEW&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am using this product along with a bunch of other dermatologica products for my everyday routines and can honestly say I am seeing great results, but am not sure if they can be attributed to this particular product or the whole suit of them. After my pregnancy I developed a lot of dark spots and sebum production seems to have increased resulting in lots of outbreaks in the t zone. All these issues have been satisfactorily addressed. Here is my routine:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Morning&lt;br /&gt;Wash with DM essential cleaning solution&lt;br /&gt;DM oil control lotion&lt;br /&gt;Murad rapid age spot serum AND DM c12 bright serum&lt;br /&gt;Either DM dynamic skin recovery moisteurizer or DM active moist (the former if i feel a bit dry)&lt;br /&gt;DM total eye care&lt;br /&gt;Makeup as usual&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Evening&lt;br /&gt;DM wash&lt;br /&gt;DM daily microfoliant&lt;br /&gt;Murad and c12 serums&lt;br /&gt;DM pure night lightening cream&lt;br /&gt;DM total eye care&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every week I use a DM sebum clearing mask&lt;br /&gt;Every two weeks or as needed I use a chemical peel, followed by DM power recovery masque to restore moisture.&lt;br /&gt;Map15 generator dust mixed with moisteurizer as needed but rarely&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results are massive. Well worth the cost as I no longer need laser spot removal as I thought.</li>
    <li> Leaves face feeling soft and hydrated</li>
    <li> Great boost for my face without flaring my rosacea.</li>
    <li> Although its packing was not good, the mask is effective.</li>
    <li> Saves your face... especially in the winter !!</li>
    <li> Smells like paint. It&#x27;s OK. Can&#x27;t tell much of a difference using it though.</li>
    <li> So highly scented I had to wash it off immediately!  It might work but I couldn&#x27;t leave it on long enough to find out! Fragrance is NOT skincare...</li>
    <li> This is a great face mask for ALL types of skin.  It works best when used after cleansing and exfoliating the skin.    I find it is absorbed best when used with a facial steamer.  My steamer is Professional Table Top Facial Steamer  by Satin Smooth.  Its exactly what is used in spas but at home.  The face mask will leave your skin glowing!</li>
    <li> very good mask i never ever used before. the result after applying the product is obviously.</li>
    <li> Will buy this as long as it&#x27;s around.  Best way I like to use it is as part of my morning routine once of twice a week.  Use this mask  before you go out, and oh my will  your complection look radiant.</li>
    <li> very good ,feel like your face has been iron done ,,,</li>
    <li> The best mask for any skin type. Instant results!</li>
    <li> Not immediately after application, but I think I am prettier the next day.</li>
    <li> My favorite line in skincare</li>
    <li> I worked in a high end beauty store and have worked with and sold Dermalogica for years. As a pro stylist and skin care expert I must say this is a  wonderful mask for dull looking tired skin. Definitely gives the skin a quick pick me up when needed. Obviously do not expect myrical results! Any topical skin product can do only so much. Its a bit pricey but such a small amount is needed to cover the face I think its a wonderful value if you want to splurge!</li>
    <li> I have no idea where all of these good reviews are coming from because this product is using irritating plant extracts as well as the potent menthol derivative menthoxypropanediol which most definitely will not benefit any skin type, and most certainly not sensitive skin which I&#x27;m guessing most people who look for these kind of products has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a bad reaction to a product a couple of months ago and a woman at a spa recommended this line. Since I thought it would really help my skin I kept using it. My skin kept getting worse and worse, but I had changed so much in the last months that I just couldn&#x27;t pinpoint what it was. I had several of their products and, so, when I removed ALL of their products did my face finally start getting back to normal. However, I still have a lot of scars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This company is big and, so, when considering a company who has a lot of resources and capital to be able to fund extremely well designed advertising schemes one should consider if the product is actually good or if they are only trying to make it seem like it is. Anyone who has taken a business 101 class should know that keeping variable costs (ingredients) down to a minimum is heavily prioritized, otherwise they find it hard to rise up to the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are cheeper ways to ruin your skin, and cheeper still to buy products that will actually benefit your skin.</li>
    <li> Living the the Arizona desert, our skin cries out for moisture.  I simply clean my face, apply the mask, and leave it on overnight.  if your skin is dry--you&#x27;ve got to try Dermalogica&#x27;s products, especially the power recovery mask.  You&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
    <li> I use this every night before bed and do not wash off. I love it! Turning 40 and this and the multivitamin eye care is my favorite</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used this product it is great for keeping skin in great condition.</li>
    <li> If it&#x27;s not because of a strange smell, I think I should give this product five stars. Really, the effect after the face is very good, very suitable for dry skin use. Recommended to a lot of friends around, they used to say very praise after. I hope I have more and more good things recommended to them. Have not bought a friend, do not hesitate, it is worth to try.</li>
    <li> Used this product for a very long time and it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> I love Dermalogica products.  This mask is terrific.</li>
    <li> I have ridiculously sensitive skin. Nearly every skincare product causes redness, hives, burning or itching. I have been hesitant to branch out and try anything new because I have found a few holy grail products that make my face so happy. But, I do still battle dryness and sometimes want to look a little more polished. This does the trick. I had heard great things about it but hesitated getting it because I didn&#x27;t want to deal with the consequences of it not working for me. I finally got it and have been using it for about three months. I will never again go without this! If my skin is particularly dehydrated (from flying, or sun) this instantly soothes it. If I just want a boost this is amazing. It leaves my skin healthy and glowing and feels absolutely amazing on my face. I love this product.</li>
    <li> All of Dermalogica products are superior to anything I&#x27;ve ever used.  I can&#x27;t always buy all of them, but I never go without the Multivitamin Masque.  It smooths, cleans and brightens my face.  I try and use it twice a week and it lasts a long time.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Good for dry, sensitive &amp; tired skin. But a tad expensive for small tube. I got the same results from Clarins Beauty Flash Balm. I was expecting more instant results given the hype about the product.</li>
    <li> I do notice that my skin feels much more moisturized after this mask is processed on my face.  I like the way it smells, too.  Kind of clinical.  Dermalogica products are always a plus for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a dermalogica gal and this is perfect for Wisconsin winters to smooth out my face.</li>
    <li> Product expiry dates should be printed for Dermalogica products and all skin care products made in the USA even though it is not compulsory by legislation to do so . This will ensure that customers do not continue to use expired products. Dermalogica products sold in salons in Malaysia have expiry dates printed on the box packaging.</li>
    <li> Great mask to use weekly for dry skin.  Gives my skin a young dewy look. My skin was breaking out from laser skin products. This reversed the damage immediately.</li>
    <li> This product really leaves my skin softer and looking healthier. I have used this brand before and it is very good specially for dry skin like mine. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I usually loves Dermalogica products, but not this one. The mask smelled strong and kind of alcoholic, and I didn&#x27;t feel too much difference after washing it away.</li>
    <li> This is the best, your skin is so soft, with a nice glow, I look younger</li>
    <li> Of all the masque&#x27;s I&#x27;ve tried over the years- and there have been several, I definitely like this the best!  I have very dry skin and this product seems to actually help restore some moisture.</li>
    <li> amazing stuff at a great price</li>
    <li> Find it very hydrating and a love it. Only down fall - the fact that it turns my face orange like an ompa loompa, lol. Great product overall though!</li>
