      <li>Cost effective option, received on time and works great!</li>
      <li>They look and feel great, but when snapped into place on the Clarisonic, they didn&#x27;t oscillate.      </li>
      <li>and I consider them to be a good value.</li>
      <li>they fit my clarisonic perfectly</li>
      <li>I was very happy to find these at such a great price.  </li>
      <li>GREAT price for nice brushes that fit into the MIA2.  </li>
      <li>Nice value.  </li>
      <li>This is definitely better than having bristles that are too scratchy, though.  </li>

      <li>Brush head fits well &amp; works just like original.</li>
      <li>Great price and these work just as good as the expensive ones.</li>
      <li>I probably hadn&#x27;t changed the brush head on my Clairsonic in nearly two years, because I was too cheap to pay for something that was still working just fine.  </li>
      <li>My husband figured out that if you press in the center part (until it clicks) after screwing on the brush head, it works fine!!</li>
      <li>I would definitely order from this company again, although I may try to see if the &amp;#34;deep pore&amp;#34; version is more suitable to my needs next time.</li>
      <li>They do seem very gentle, though.  </li>
      <li>I did see some fall out of the bristles when I washed the head for the first time, but nothing that would stop me from purchasing this again.</li>

      <li>These do the exact same thing.  </li>
      <li>did not like , too soft</li>
      <li>After a few days use I&#x27;ve gotten use to the feel, softer than the Claisonic heads, but next time I will pay more to get the name brand.</li>
      <li>Please be advised that the normal is the same softness as the sensitive brush by clarisonic.  </li>

    <li> I probably hadn&#x27;t changed the brush head on my Clairsonic in nearly two years, because I was too cheap to pay for something that was still working just fine.  I was very happy to find these at such a great price.  They snap on easily and work just as well with my device as the original brush head.  They do seem very gentle, though.  I feel as though I need to barely graze the brush over my skin to keep from squishing the bristles down.  This is definitely better than having bristles that are too scratchy, though.  I would definitely order from this company again, although I may try to see if the &amp;#34;deep pore&amp;#34; version is more suitable to my needs next time.</li>
    <li> I was hoping these brush heads would have the same feel as the Claisonic brand brush heads, but no luck. After a few days use I&#x27;ve gotten use to the feel, softer than the Claisonic heads, but next time I will pay more to get the name brand.</li>
    <li> Nice value.  Works well and feels nicer than my original brush head!</li>
    <li> I am a devoted user of clarisonic.  If you are still paying $25/head at a store - STOP!!  These do the exact same thing.  I can tell no difference.</li>
    <li> These brushes are very soft and gentle on my skin.  I love the way my face feels after using this brush.  My skin is soft and smooth.  Highly recommend these.</li>
    <li> I love these.  Please be advised that the normal is the same softness as the sensitive brush by clarisonic.  If you are looking for a deeper cleanse then these may not work for you.  I did see some fall out of the bristles when I washed the head for the first time, but nothing that would stop me from purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> Wife says can&#x27;t tell the difference from originals.</li>
    <li> GREAT price for nice brushes that fit into the MIA2.  The brushes move and feel the same as the clarisonic but with a fraction of the cost.  I will be buying more in the future and also recommending them to friends.</li>
    <li> I have been very happy with these brush heads and will definitely purchase again!  They have worked just as well as the brushes that came with my Clarisonic and I consider them to be a good value.</li>
    <li> did not fit near as well as the clarsonic  refills. did not like , too soft</li>
    <li> Initially, the brush heads didn&#x27;t work for me.  They look and feel great, but when snapped into place on the Clarisonic, they didn&#x27;t oscillate.      My husband figured out that if you press in the center part (until it clicks) after screwing on the brush head, it works fine!!</li>
    <li> Great price and these work just as good as the expensive ones. they fit my clarisonic perfectly</li>
    <li> These are perfect for my Clairsonic!! Also, they are a fraction of the price of the Clairsonic brand brush heads.</li>
    <li> Works just as advertised.</li>
    <li> Brush head fits well &amp; works just like original. Dramatic price difference will keep me a customer!</li>
    <li> Grat value for known product</li>
    <li> Cost effective option, received on time and works great!</li>
