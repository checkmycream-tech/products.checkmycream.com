### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a shame that I couldn&#x27;t share a wonderful experience like everyone else had.</li>
      <li>love, love,love it !!!</li>
      <li>All in all a really good find!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great product in my opinion.</li>
      <li>This lip balm feels great</li>
      <li>Great stuff.  </li>
      <li>This lip balm is amazing!</li>
      <li>I used Nivea, Chapstick, Chanel Hydramax, Lancome Lip Cream, and many others and found that none were very good</li>
      <li>But I&#x27;ve found that it&#x27;s good (really good, hence, the three stars) at soothing and healing sunburnt lips.</li>
      <li>and I absolutely love it!</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>It smells great, it makes my lips feel silky smooth and nourished.</li>
      <li>This kind works the best,\\&quot; which now solves the mystery of the lost tube.</li>
      <li>very light</li>
      <li>The light fragrance is nice.</li>
      <li>, can you get me some more of this at the grocery store today.</li>
      <li>However, having tried just about every lip conditioner on the market, I must say that this one works better than any others I have tried.</li>
      <li>CLinique&#x27;s lip scrub made my lips feel better.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>My favorite part is the smell...</li>
      <li>However, I never have any of the drying problems stated by so many in the reviewers for this lipstick.  </li>
      <li>Certainly, I&#x27;ve tried all the drugstore brands and though some of those are better than others, this is vastly superior.  </li>
      <li>Nice, mild lip balm without any scents, etc.  </li>
      <li>I love how it feels on my lips as well as the light flavor, it lasts for hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I attribute Caudalie as the reason I am able to continue to use this fantastic lipstick.  </li>
      <li>Easily wears off in five minutes.</li>
      <li>I bought this originally from Sephora store but when I went back to buy another they were out; I like the pleasant light scent but at the same time is an excellent moisturizer for the lips</li>
      <li>Overall great lip balm and I just bought another one.</li>
      <li>Fabulous product.  </li>
      <li>So I liked it so much</li>
      <li>This lip balm is totally worth the money!</li>
      <li>I love this lip balm, it does not sit on top (you actually feel your lips moisturized)</li>
      <li>Love it, and cant&#x27; live without it.</li>
      <li>It is easy to apply and very soothing.  </li>
      <li>and you&#x27;re willing to pay more for something that actually works and is more than just a coat of wax.</li>
      <li>The seller was great and even sent little samples with the order, which arrived as scheduled.  </li>
      <li>Closest to a natural product I&#x27;ve been able to find that I still like.</li>
      <li>The texture is silky but doesn&#x27;t wear off right away.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s the most expensive \\&quot;chap stick\\&quot; type lip conditioner I&#x27;ve used -- yet I find it to work the best by far.</li>
      <li>There is no unpleasant or sweet taste to it and it makes your lips very soft.  </li>
      <li>I certainly hope Caudalie doesn&#x27;t do what MAC has decided to do!  </li>
      <li>I am addicted to lip balm and am trying to recover to have my own lips produce some kind of moisture.</li>
      <li>I also tried Jack Black and found the scents were too strong, it sat on top, and was a bit sticky.</li>
      <li>It is a bit more pricy, however and when I lost my tube, (it&#x27;s the same size as a tube of lipstick and swivels up like one as well)</li>
      <li>This lip balm is exactly what my parched lips need.</li>
      <li>You may think this is way too much money for lip balm, but this is definitely worth it.  </li>
      <li>I first started using this conditioner while living in Paris and have only been able to find it online in the U.S.</li>
      <li>My lips are soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>Really like this lip conditioner.  </li>
      <li>is just like a natural moisturizer (very mild barely there).</li>
      <li>It keeps my lips smooth throughout a dry northern winter.  </li>
      <li>No smell, and no thick glop, either.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t really used many lip balms or conditioners myself, but my wife is a fanatic.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is pretty pricey but one of these tubes will last me for months.</li>
      <li>Overall, it has a very waxy feel to it, like I&#x27;m rubbing a candle on my lips.</li>
      <li>Unlike some lip balms and lip treatments that merely coat the lips with a layer of wax, Caudalie Lip Conditioner actually has multiple emollients in its ingredients that work to make the lips feel smooth, soft, comfortable, and moisturized.</li>
      <li>When my lips are fine, however, it actually has a negative effect: drying my lips and making them peel.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I am addicted to lip balm and am trying to recover to have my own lips produce some kind of moisture. I used Nivea, Chapstick, Chanel Hydramax, Lancome Lip Cream, and many others and found that none were very good and I had to constantly reapply. I love this lip balm, it does not sit on top (you actually feel your lips moisturized) and it lasts a long time. I also tried Jack Black and found the scents were too strong, it sat on top, and was a bit sticky. This lip balm feels great and I find it smell is just like a natural moisturizer (very mild barely there). Overall great lip balm and I just bought another one. Great product!</li>
    <li> This lip conditioner made my lips really dry,  i have no idea why!  I tried for 2 weeks and it was really bad.</li>
    <li> This simply felt like a lighter petroleum jelly and was in a tube. Been using it for a week and notice no difference. Easily wears off in five minutes. CLinique&#x27;s lip scrub made my lips feel better.</li>
    <li> Unlike some lip balms and lip treatments that merely coat the lips with a layer of wax, Caudalie Lip Conditioner actually has multiple emollients in its ingredients that work to make the lips feel smooth, soft, comfortable, and moisturized. I noticed a definte improvement to my lips when I switched to Caudalie&#x27;s Lip Conditioner from the Burt&#x27;s Beeswax Lip Balm I had been using. It is a bit more pricy, however and when I lost my tube, (it&#x27;s the same size as a tube of lipstick and swivels up like one as well) I went a bit pouty. My husband who has been a lifetime chapstick user just handed me the empty tube this morning and said, \\&quot;Hon, can you get me some more of this at the grocery store today. This kind works the best,\\&quot; which now solves the mystery of the lost tube. Not available at the grocery store, you can buy it here or at Neiman Marcus, it&#x27;s the most expensive \\&quot;chap stick\\&quot; type lip conditioner I&#x27;ve used -- yet I find it to work the best by far. Try it if you&#x27;ve tried other stuff and you&#x27;re willing to pay more for something that actually works and is more than just a coat of wax.</li>
    <li> I like how there is no taste to this product. My lips are soft and smooth. I would reccomend to others.</li>
    <li> I have absolutely no natural color to my lips! I use MAC longwear lipstick EVERY day!  EVERY night I apply CAUDALIE LIP CONDITIONER!  I attribute Caudalie as the reason I am able to continue to use this fantastic lipstick.  This lipstick DOES what it says it will - it STAYS! However, I never have any of the drying problems stated by so many in the reviewers for this lipstick.  Drying lips is the reason it&#x27;s being phased out by the manufacturer!  By using Caudalie Lip Conditioner I have NO problems w/ my lips whatsoever!  I certainly hope Caudalie doesn&#x27;t do what MAC has decided to do!  Don&#x27;t ever stop making this product!</li>
    <li> This lip balm is amazing! It softens your lips and is not greasy what so ever. My favorite part is the smell... very light and it smells like those white candy sticks from those Lik-a-stix candy powder envelopes.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Caudalie lip conditioner at Sephora and I&#x27;ve used it for several weeks. Overall, it has a very waxy feel to it, like I&#x27;m rubbing a candle on my lips. But I&#x27;ve found that it&#x27;s good (really good, hence, the three stars) at soothing and healing sunburnt lips. When my lips are fine, however, it actually has a negative effect: drying my lips and making them peel. So, I&#x27;m keeping one around for summer when I or my daughter forget to wear lip balm with SPF, but otherwise we&#x27;ve got no use for it.</li>
    <li> Caudalie has nailed it! This lip balm is exactly what my parched lips need. It smells great, it makes my lips feel silky smooth and nourished. I love it!</li>
    <li> You may think this is way too much money for lip balm, but this is definitely worth it.  I keep this in my bedside table and use it every night.  It keeps my lips smooth throughout a dry northern winter.  I&#x27;ve found nothing else comparable.  Certainly, I&#x27;ve tried all the drugstore brands and though some of those are better than others, this is vastly superior.  It lasts a long time.  My last one went rancid before I used it all!  And it&#x27;s not goopey and slidey, so you could use this under lipstick during the day.  Fabulous product.  Love it.</li>
    <li> The texture is silky but doesn&#x27;t wear off right away. The light fragrance is nice. I prefer this to all the other lip conditioners including Carmex.</li>
    <li> While some of the other Caudalie products don&#x27;t stand up to their claims, Caudalie lip conditioner does what it says.  It has a creamy texture and I use it overnight.  You can also wear it during the day as a lip balm, but no spf in it.  The seller was great and even sent little samples with the order, which arrived as scheduled.  I first started using this conditioner while living in Paris and have only been able to find it online in the U.S. but at least it&#x27;s here.  There is no unpleasant or sweet taste to it and it makes your lips very soft.  It&#x27;s a great product in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I bought this originally from Sephora store but when I went back to buy another they were out; I like the pleasant light scent but at the same time is an excellent moisturizer for the lips (I am a guy by the way!). Does not smell girly at all. So I liked it so much I ordered it here online.</li>
    <li> Really like this lip conditioner.  It is easy to apply and very soothing.  It is also possible to wear it under lipstick if you wish.  All in all a really good find!</li>
    <li> love, love,love it !!! it truly is a miracle in a stick. never experience dry,cracking lip again come winter time!</li>
    <li> An employee at Sephora recommended this conditioner to me as a replacement for my Dr. Hauschka lip balm stick. It was around the same price range so I bought it. It leaves a white film over my lips and makes my lips peel. However, it isn&#x27;t completely useless, I use Cauldie&#x27;s lip conditioner to remove all the dead skin from my lips and then put my regular Hauschka lip balm on (now that I can find it at Whole Foods). I won&#x27;t be repurchasing this item. It&#x27;s a shame that I couldn&#x27;t share a wonderful experience like everyone else had. It just goes to show you, product react differently on people.</li>
    <li> This lip balm is totally worth the money! It absorbs into your lips and moisturizes way longer than any other Chapstick I&#x27;ve bought before. Love it, and cant&#x27; live without it. Wish I could buy a year&#x27;s supply!!!</li>
    <li> Nice, mild lip balm without any scents, etc.  Great stuff.  Closest to a natural product I&#x27;ve been able to find that I still like.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t really used many lip balms or conditioners myself, but my wife is a fanatic. She&#x27;s always re-applying throughout the day, so I got her some of this to try. She says she loves it. She puts some on at night before bed and says it lasts through the entire night, whereas other brands she&#x27;s used do not</li>
    <li> This is the only lip balm I use and I absolutely love it! I love how it feels on my lips as well as the light flavor, it lasts for hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is pretty pricey but one of these tubes will last me for months.</li>
    <li> This product is expensive for what it is. However, having tried just about every lip conditioner on the market, I must say that this one works better than any others I have tried. No smell, and no thick glop, either.</li>
