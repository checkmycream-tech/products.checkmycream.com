<li> have naturally curly/processed hair therefore, it can be hard to find a product that leaves your hair silky and soft.</li>
<li> This flat iron heats up the second you turn it on so be careful.</li>
<li> Even my daughter who has naturally very curly hair gets that salon finished look without working too hard.</li>
<li> I have long, natural curly blonde hair which can be difficult to straighten and to keep straight.</li>
<li> I do like it , makes the hair shiny and the hair is healthy looking after using it just like my other less expensive FHI&#x27;s iron.</li>
<li> so I have to be careful with styling tools.</li>
<li> I have thick, naturally curly, color-treated hair</li>
<li> I have used other name brands and this is by far the least damaging to my hair.</li>
<li> It takes half as long to straiten my naturaly curley hair.</li>
<li> I would recommend this product to other users.</li>
<li> I think it is alot less damaging to my hair.  </li>
<li> She has very long thick hair</li>
<li> and I was not sure how she cared for the iron.  </li>
<li> (she has used Chi irons as well as less expensive irons in the past).</li>
<li> I bought CHI base on friends review.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with all things hair and makeup, and this is by far the best straightening iron I have ever used. I&#x27;ve owned many flat irons including Chis, GHDs, etc, but none compare to the FHI. I have thick, naturally curly, color-treated hair so I have to be careful with styling tools. Split ends haven&#x27;t been a problem since I started using my FHI. It makes your hair noticeably softer, shinier, and leaves it with a smoother finish. The FHI is a bit more expensive but worth every penny. Sometimes you have to pay a little more for good quality, right? Love it!</li>
    <li> flat iron works well, heats quickly ad functions perfectly, does make the lights flicker when it gets up to temp, no other one has done that. must be larger heater or something. Would recommend over the Solia it replaced</li>
    <li> FHI has a solid reputation and the product works well.  The challenge is that this is the 3rd FHI flat iron we have purchased in 3 years.  I gave the flat iron the benefit of the doubt since I purchased the first 2 for my daughter and I was not sure how she cared for the iron.  The last one I purchased for myself and just 10 days short of 1year, it gave out as well.  FHI will not honor the 1 yr warranty for its product if it is purchased from Amazon or Amazon sellers!  So basically, you have no warranty. Seems like an issue with having a consumer protection organization look more closely at.</li>
    <li> I have had CHI irons for years, but ny stylist talked me into trying the FHI when my CHI was on the fritz.  I will never go back.  I think it is alot less damaging to my hair.  It takes half as long to straiten my naturaly curley hair.</li>
    <li> Great product. I ordered it 5 days before Xmas and received it 2 days before Xmas!!! This flat iron heats up the second you turn it on so be careful. Very Happy!</li>
    <li> I am pleased to say this is the second FHI flat iron I purchased as a gift for my MOm, The product is as described and some!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have naturally curly/processed hair therefore, it can be hard to find a product that leaves your hair silky and soft. There is no need to run the flat iron over the same piece of hair twice, once will do. I can&#x27;t say how happy I am with this flat iron.</li>
    <li> The best flat ir on that I have ever used!! highly recommended and used in Dominican Salons that I have patronized.</li>
    <li> Product as describe, brand new in box, very nice carrying case. These FHI EPS series makes my hair silky smooth, no more frizz. I would highly recommend these over any flat irons on the market. Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> I have purchased two of the FHI Eps irons this year.  I am a hairstylist, and use my iron constantly.  Although this iron is one of the best, both that I purchased only lasted my a couple of months before they burt out!! Definitely one of the best irons out there, but I have to constantly replace it.</li>
    <li> Easy to use! Heats evenly! Doesn&#x27;t scorch my hair.  Glides through my hair.  I highly recommend this product. Love it!</li>
    <li> I have used other name brands and this is by far the least damaging to my hair. Even my daughter who has naturally very curly hair gets that salon finished look without working too hard.</li>
    <li> I love the flat iron. It gets hot really quick. And straightens my hair really straight.  I would love to purchase the FHI hot ssuce</li>
    <li> Have purchased the same item twice in one year and both times it stopped working and wouldnt turn on after10 months.</li>
    <li> Purchased the flat iron FHI. It works great! I love it!!!! Best flat iron I have ever owned.  I would recommend this product to other users.</li>
    <li> I bought CHI base on friends review. My hairstylist recommend FHI. I just bought FHI flat iron. Oh my god, FHI work wonders. CHI is still good product but FHI work better on my hair.</li>
    <li> I love the results my hair had after using this product.  I have fine hair...but when I use the styling Iron my hair came out looking and feeling great.  Not heavy but had some bounce..with beautiful curls</li>
    <li> I RECEIVED MY FHI&#x27;S IN NO TIME AT ALL. I LOVE THE FHI&#x27;S IN GENERAL. I AM VERY PLEASED WITH HOW WELL ALL WAS PACKAGED.</li>
    <li> I use this flat iron daily!! It is by far better than any other I have owned. I can go stick straight or add a wave with the flick of my wrist! LOVE!!</li>
    <li> After literally hours of research both online and at local stores I purchased this FHI Elite Professional Ceramic/Tourmaline 1 inch flat iron on Amazon.com for my wife for her BD. She has only used it a few times so far but says it works great and she really likes it. She has very long thick hair and she says it&#x27;s the best flat iron she has ever used (she has used Chi irons as well as less expensive irons in the past). She also likes the heat mat and bag it comes with! I only hope it will last longer than people are saying most of these flat irons tend to last.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Fhi flatirons in the past and always got good results, but the Fhi EPS-1 is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used. I have long, natural curly blonde hair which can be difficult to straighten and to keep straight. With this flatiron my hair is silky smooth, completely straight, and it stays that way even on windy or humid days. Its easy and doesn&#x27;t take much time to straighten and most importantly, I haven&#x27;t noticed any damage from the straightening process. I do use the Living Proof brand leave in conditioner for frizz and the straight spray. The combination of the fhi and these products-fantastic! I highly recommend this flatiron. In fact, I plan to buy a couple more for Christmas gifts.</li>
    <li> Once I figured out how to use this styling tool properly, it worked better. Overall I like it. I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron.. When my chi died. I replaced with this.  It is great .. Several,hair dressers have this iron and they paid alot more.. I am thrilled</li>
    <li> FHI is one of the best on the market so I recommend the brand. this particular iron is good but not as great as I expected. I thought it would be better than the other FHI&#x27;s I have purchased in the past but it is the same. This is suppose to be the salon version so this is why I purchased it. I do like it , makes the hair shiny and the hair is healthy looking after using it just like my other less expensive FHI&#x27;s iron. I say you will be happy with whatever FHI iron you purchase.</li>
