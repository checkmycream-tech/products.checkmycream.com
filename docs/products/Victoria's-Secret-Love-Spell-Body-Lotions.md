      <li>when i tell them, their like...i gotta get that, omg!!:)</li>
      <li>On the same note, since the smell is so strong I believe it&#x27;s best to not wear perfume with it as it already does that job too.</li>

      <li>It came early, and is in great condition.</li>
      <li>I got this as a gift for my wife and she REALLY likes it and it smells really good.</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t think it smells too strong either.</li>
      <li>The one thing I could see being bothersome to some people is how strong the smell is and could make headaches to some.</li>
      <li>If your looking for something that smells sexy and flirty &amp; sweet</li>
      <li>Leaves skin smooth</li>
      <li>Product was shipped securely.</li>
      <li>10-12 years ago, this was a really unique fragrance...</li>
      <li>Clean fresh scent!</li>
      <li>It makes me feel fresh and clean</li>
      <li>Bought this as a gift for my young neices and liked the scent so much that I bought some for myself.</li>
      <li>It was nice, but just not the same</li>
      <li>and she was right</li>
      <li>Such a nice scent, that really is a &amp;#34;Love Spell&amp;#34; on the men around you.</li>
      <li>Feels a little greasy when first applied, but then is absorbed, leaving a nice clean fragrance.</li>
      <li>This product is exactly what they stated it is.</li>
      <li>It is first quality</li>
      <li>The smell was different from what I experienced from another Victoria&#x27;s Secret Love Spell product.</li>
      <li>small so good like it</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m trying to make 20 words here because I really don&#x27;t want to do a long review. :)</li>
      <li>Not for me, is a gift for someone, but I can say that at least the smell is pleasant.</li>
      <li>My mom absolutely loves this lotion</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel very oily after applying.</li>
      <li>I first smelled an imitation scent of this very lotion/perfume brand and did lots of research to find out who made the original</li>
      <li>I enjoy many Victoria Secret body lotions.</li>
      <li>Only thing, this scent is becoming more common.</li>
      <li>A nice delicate smell.</li>
      <li>Sometimes I&#x27;ll try something new</li>
      <li>When I bought this new, it was shipped to me on time</li>
      <li>New</li>
      <li>It arrived promptly and in brand new condition.  </li>
      <li>Therefore, the lotion leaves my skin feeling hydrated and very soft.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this lotion since early in high school</li>
      <li>ordered the lotion with the body spray, lotion was received first, spray took several days</li>
      <li>As soon as I get out of the shower I put it on and it absorbs into your skin well and instantly makes it super soft all day long.</li>
      <li>I love any Victoria&#x27;s Secret Fragrance.</li>
      <li>Victorias Secret Love Spell Hydrating Body Lotion es una</li>
      <li>Not only is the bottle sticky on the outside and only mostly full, but as you can see in the pictures I&#x27;ve posted, there was dried lotion all over the cap</li>
      <li>We live in a very dry climate so my wife uses quite a bit on her back and arms etc.</li>

<li> I used to have really dry skin and even had eczema at one point before I ever used this.</li>
<li> The smell is a little strange on my skin, doesn&#x27;t smell quite like the body spray or perfume and it has a bit of a sticky feel to it.</li>
<li> I usually get the body butter but for only $10 with prime two day shipping, this lotion just couldn&#x27;t be beat!</li>
<li> this stays in my purse for traveling and everyday when im out.</li>
<li> and I hated to over spend because as you would expect she can overuse :)&lt;</li>
<li> the bottles of lotion are small</li>
<li> The closest Victoria&#x27;s Secret location is about 65 or so miles away, so sadly I don&#x27;t get to go there often!</li>
<li> and somebody&#x27;s nasty thumb prints all over.</li>
<li> Disgusting.</li>

    <li> My niece loves Love Spell and this was a great price.&lt;br /&gt;She is 13 and I hated to over spend because as you would expect she can overuse :)&lt;br /&gt;This was a great deal.</li>
    <li> smells great!  Leaves skin smooth</li>
    <li> what can i say? this is the best smelling scent right now! this stays in my purse for traveling and everyday when im out. everywhere i go someone asks me what im wearing and when i tell them, their like...i gotta get that, omg!!:)</li>
    <li> This product is exactly what they stated it is. It is first quality and I like to buy this for my wife. I&#x27;m trying to make 20 words here because I really don&#x27;t want to do a long review. :)</li>
    <li> My mom absolutely loves this lotion so I got it for her for Christmas and she was right it smells wonderful and was at a good price.</li>
    <li> Not for me, is a gift for someone, but I can say that at least the smell is pleasant. ok.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion since early in high school and I&#x27;m now in my senior year of college. Sometimes I&#x27;ll try something new but it just never compares to this lotion and I go back. I get a lot of complements on the smell. I used to have really dry skin and even had eczema at one point before I ever used this. I haven&#x27;t had dry skin problems since I started using this lotion. As soon as I get out of the shower I put it on and it absorbs into your skin well and instantly makes it super soft all day long. The one thing I could see being bothersome to some people is how strong the smell is and could make headaches to some. On the same note, since the smell is so strong I believe it&#x27;s best to not wear perfume with it as it already does that job too.</li>
    <li> When I bought this new, it was shipped to me on time but when it arrived, it had been USED. Not only is the bottle sticky on the outside and only mostly full, but as you can see in the pictures I&#x27;ve posted, there was dried lotion all over the cap and somebody&#x27;s nasty thumb prints all over. There&#x27;s a sticker on it that says New but that&#x27;s a lie. Disgusting.</li>
    <li> I love this product and smell really good</li>
    <li> entrega rapida, originales, condiciones perfectas, buen olor, el vendedor es bastante responsable y no dio dolor de cabeza. recomiendo comprar a el</li>
    <li> I have the love spell body spray which is amazing, so I bought this lotion. The smell is a little strange on my skin, doesn&#x27;t smell quite like the body spray or perfume and it has a bit of a sticky feel to it.</li>
