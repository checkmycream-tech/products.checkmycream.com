      <li>Not my favorite, but</li>
      <li>I have tried many shampoos that purport to be healthy (</li>
      <li>I even don&#x27;t have to use conditioner any more.</li>
      <li>I love that it is a safe shampoo for my hair.</li>
      <li>I really love this shampoo.</li>
      <li>/&gt;While this does protect my hair to some degree, I lose a LOT more color than with the higher-end &#x27;poo.</li>
      <li>This shampoo is OK.</li>
      <li>The shampoo I love by this company is &amp;#34;Color Protection&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>The Cucumber conditioner adds the shine, silkiness and manageability back in beautifully!</li>
      <li>Love their products and so glad to have found them online.</li>
      <li>Pretty good shampoo.</li>
      <li>Good product that can also be found at some Walmarts but at a higher price.</li>
      <li>There is a nice cucumber scent while lathering, but after rinsing and drying the scent is very light and fresh which I like.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The smell is fine, and my hair felt OK.</li>
      <li>This shampoo smells like fresh cut cucumbers and does a good job keeping your hair clean.  </li>
      <li>It lathers up great and leaves my hair shinny and soft</li>
      <li>I like the ingredient list, (natural), and it does do a great job of cleaning.</li>
      <li>I gave the 4 stars because it really doesn&#x27;t give manageable hair, but I love it because it is one of the best of natural shampoos.</li>
      <li>I personally love the mild fragrance where most perfumes send me running from the room.</li>
      <li>LOVE this and am totally hooked AND SO APPRECIATIVE!</li>
      <li>This is a huge pain.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really enjoy the smell of this line of shampoo, but it works quite well.</li>
      <li>e.g. sulfate free, etc) that will work with my color treated hair.</li>
      <li>I am all for using products that are good for you, and I&#x27;ve really grown to love the YesTo brand, in particular.  </li>
      <li>Leaves a clean non chemical feel aiding my scalp from drying effects of others.  </li>
      <li>As a result, however, I don&#x27;t feel like my hair is truly clean.  </li>
      <li>I enjoy the fresh cucumber scent and I am happy with the way my hair behaves once it&#x27;s dry.</li>
      <li>It has a clean, fresh scent and it is sulfate and paraben free.  </li>
      <li>I love this shampoo so much.</li>
      <li>all of their formulas that used to use ammonium lauryl sulfate which is supposed to be more gentle now all now use Sodium lauryl sulfate.</li>
      <li>for the nozzles clogging up as one reviewer mentioned, I find that true with all types of nozzles, whether it be hair products or lotions.</li>
      <li>recently they&#x27;ve changed the bottle design, which is a good thing.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the Cucumber trio (shampoo,conditioner,body wash) and gone through 2 full bottles of each now.</li>
      <li>So far loving it.</li>
      <li>The scent is very light and fresh, not like cucumbers or any particular fruit or vegetable - just fresh and clean.</li>
      <li>Yes To Cucumber Color Care Shampoo is a new favorite of mine.</li>
      <li>I have fine, straight hair with an oil scalp, and I also color my hair.</li>
      <li>It works great on color treated hair and it is one of the few shampoos that my hair does not get resistant to working on.</li>
      <li>It smells great, doesn&#x27;t contain any harsh ingredients, and hasn&#x27;t contributed to stripping my hair color.  </li>
      <li>It says Yes to Cucumbers and smells like fresh cucumbers.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not so sure about how natural it is.</li>
      <li>The only thing I liked about this was that it did not strip my hair color.  </li>
      <li>I feel better knowing how natural it is</li>
      <li>I still love them because they don&#x27;t have harsh chemicals to strip hair, clean well, and smell lovely.</li>
      <li>, gentle rich lather never dries my colored hair out.</li>
      <li>It really smells like fresh summer cucumbers!</li>
      <li>Good lather, slight cucumber odor.</li>
      <li>Yes to cucumbers is very gentle and nourishing.</li>
      <li>I am going back to Target to buy the Color Protection line there, as I can&#x27;t be sure the product I wanted and ordered will be the one I get.</li>
      <li>Those are the only redeeming qualities to this stuff.</li>
      <li>I love the entire Yes</li>
      <li>First of all, the review talking about the smell is ludacris to me.</li>
      <li>It cleans well without stripping and is a good everyday shampoo.</li>
      <li>Of course, the absence of lather could be a result of the absence of chemicals that aren&#x27;t good for you.  </li>
      <li>This certainly does wash some of the color out of my hair each time I wash.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really liking this shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
      <li>It really does help preserve the color of your hair.</li>
      <li>Since switching to this shampoo, my hair looks and feels so much healthier.  </li>
      <li>I do think it is gentle on color.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>The scent is light and fresh and I like that it doesn&#x27;t have all of the chemicals that other shampoos on the market have.</li>
      <li>It actually feels fun to use them!</li>
      <li>She likes it even better than the other one.</li>
      <li>I love the smell and it doesnt make my hair look greasy like other hair products.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> A Bunch of marketing strategies leading to disappointment and a waste of hard earned money. Terrible!! Consumer beware of fancy labels that speak natural.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  The smell is great.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is gentle on my hair and lathers into a really soft lather. It cleans well without stripping and is a good everyday shampoo. I use it along with the Yes to Color Care Conditioner with Cucumbers and have excellent results. I previously used Pantene, but I have noticed in recent years that they have changed all of their formulas that used to use ammonium lauryl sulfate which is supposed to be more gentle now all now use Sodium lauryl sulfate. With pantene, my scalp was itchy and flaky. Now that I&#x27;ve stopped using shampoo with SLS in it, I have almost no flakes and little to no itch. My hair stays cleaner longer and has fewer tangles. I use this in combination with the Matrix Biolage Detangling Solution which I purchased at Master Cuts. The combination of Yes shampoo conditioner with Biolage seems to work very well for my thick, wavy hair. I also put a few drops of Dabur Vatika coconut oil on the ends and that cuts down on any frizz.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells great.</li>
    <li> So happy since I&#x27;ve switched to Yes To Cucumbers shampoo for my color treated hair.  I feel better knowing how natural it is AND it leaves my hair looking and feeling great.  No product build up and my color looks great.</li>
    <li> The only thing I liked about this was that it did not strip my hair color.  The smell is not flattering and after using it two times I had itchy buildup on my hair that I couldn&#x27;t wait to wash out.</li>
    <li> I have been trying to phase out most of the chemicals in my family&#x27;s household and bath products and in a lot of cases the products are more expensive and don&#x27;t work as well. This shampoo is marginally more expensive than my previous hair color shampoo, but it works just as well and has MUCH less chemicals in it. The shampoo has a nice scent, lathers well and my hair color has not faded any more than with the other hair color shampoos. My only (very small) complaint (and this really goes for all of the \\&quot;natural\\&quot; bath products that I have tried) is that it is a little thin and can slip through your fingers pretty fast.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t be mislead by the &amp;#34;99% pure&amp;#34; label. This contains sulfate as the second ingredient. It&#x27;s not SLS but it&#x27;s still pretty harsh. However if you&#x27;re in a bind and must choose between YTC or something like VO5 or Pantene ... YTC is the far healthier choice. At least YTC is free of parabens and dyes. I use Body Deli shampoo and Mill Creek because they&#x27;re gentler.</li>
    <li> This shampoo has a light smell and is a great product for its value. I would definitley buy it again!</li>
    <li> First of all, the review talking about the smell is ludacris to me. It says Yes to Cucumbers and smells like fresh cucumbers. How you could purchase this item and say it doesn&#x27;t smell good just makes me confused at that reviewer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the Cucumber trio (shampoo,conditioner,body wash) and gone through 2 full bottles of each now. I am completely sold. My hair is gorgeous silky, it smells better than any crappy perfumed product I ever used, and there is no buildup whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact that this item is priced so well that even Walmart sells it is insane to me being it&#x27;s 99.8% natural!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be warned America. The chemicals in your cleansing and beauty products disrupt your endocrine system. The means even with our children. Stop using hand sanitizers, and loading up with terrible chemicals every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much for coming out with a product I can trust, at a reasonable enough price for it not to be a specialty item, but an item the whole family can afford to use. AND... omg the smell is just delicious! It really smells like fresh summer cucumbers! LOVE this and am totally hooked AND SO APPRECIATIVE!</li>
    <li> I have tried many shampoos that purport to be healthy (e.g. sulfate free, etc) that will work with my color treated hair. They&#x27;re usually disappointing or too expensive. This shampoo not only cleans my hair gently and thoroughly, but also doesn&#x27;t ruin the color. The conditioner is wonderful also.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is OK. I&#x27;m not so sure about how natural it is. It left my eyes burning (my other shampoos that I use which consist of unnatural ingredients did not do this). I feel like this didn&#x27;t lather well also.</li>
    <li> I tried this product because of its green rating from the Environmental Working Group Skin Deep database.  Also, because it&#x27;s price is very reasonable compared to other green rated shampoos.  I enjoy the fresh cucumber scent and I am happy with the way my hair behaves once it&#x27;s dry.</li>
    <li> Good product but it also dries my hair.  My hair gets tangled after a wash which I do not like.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It has a clean, fresh scent and it is sulfate and paraben free.  Would highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> Good for my hair and smells grea!  I have bought it several times.  I think for the price, it&#x27;s a winner.  I will buy other YES products</li>
    <li> Good lather, slight cucumber odor.</li>
    <li> I am all for using products that are good for you, and I&#x27;ve really grown to love the YesTo brand, in particular.  Unfortunately, this shampoo fails to impress me.  I feel like you need to use a lot of this in order to get even a hint of a lather going.  Of course, the absence of lather could be a result of the absence of chemicals that aren&#x27;t good for you.  As a result, however, I don&#x27;t feel like my hair is truly clean.  This product is a bit on the expensive side for what it is.  I don&#x27;t think I will use it again.</li>
    <li> Leaves a clean non chemical feel aiding my scalp from drying effects of others.  I would recommend this product again.</li>
    <li> The shampoo I love by this company is &amp;#34;Color Protection&amp;#34; shampoo.  And that is what I ordered.  Unfortunately, this is the product I got.  The &amp;#34;Color PROTECTION&amp;#34; shampoo is clear and thicker, almost gel-like, and cleans without stripping hair color.  It also isn&#x27;t greasy, doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down, and has a much fresher, stronger cucumber scent.  I have oily, fine hair, and THIS product leaves it dull and greasy by the end of a single day. The conditioner in the &amp;#34;Color Care&amp;#34; line is also useless.  I am going back to Target to buy the Color Protection line there, as I can&#x27;t be sure the product I wanted and ordered will be the one I get.</li>
    <li> This is a huge pain. The cap has a design flaw that does not allow it to dispense properly - so EVERY time you use it, you basically have to unscrew the entire cap and replace it afterward. Annoying.</li>
    <li> I have searched for products that have low toxins in them because I have an auto immune disorder and this is rated by the Environmental Working Groups as a &amp;#34;3&amp;#34; which is the bottom of the &amp;#34;moderate&amp;#34; level for toxins. I personally love the mild fragrance where most perfumes send me running from the room. It lathers up great and leaves my hair shinny and soft and I have long thick hair. Good product that can also be found at some Walmarts but at a higher price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo and condition for a few years. I still love them because they don&#x27;t have harsh chemicals to strip hair, clean well, and smell lovely.</li>
    <li> I have used this shampoo twice.  I do think it is gentle on color.  However, I have fine hair and this shampoo does not really have and &amp;#34;volume&amp;#34; qualities, hence the 3 stars.  If you just want to retain color, and don&#x27;t need volume, then it is excellent.  This bottle will last a long time.</li>
    <li> I love the smell and it doesnt make my hair look greasy like other hair products. I would reccomend this.</li>
    <li> I like the Yes To product line over all.  This certainly does wash some of the color out of my hair each time I wash.  I feel like a bit more than other more chemical oriented shampoos have in the past.  But that&#x27;s a trade off I can handle for  having non synthetic natural products.  It does leave a bit of a build up on my hair that can make small light dusty flakes that i mistook for dandruff until my stylist said it was build up.  Compared to other less natural products found at grocery stores the build up is WAY less, but it&#x27;s there none the less.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really liking this shampoo and conditioner.  It smells great, doesn&#x27;t contain any harsh ingredients, and hasn&#x27;t contributed to stripping my hair color.  Plus it&#x27;s affordable!</li>
    <li> My wife used to buy a much more expensive color care shampoo. She saw this and decided to try it. She likes it even better than the other one. Her color seems to last longer also. Great product!</li>
    <li> I recently discovered products that don&#x27;t contain parabens after buying another product from this company, Yes To Carrots at Target. Looked online and found this Yes To Cucumber products by the same company. Love their products and so glad to have found them online. Will order again.</li>
    <li> It works in my very thin hair. Differently than other color care shampoos, doesnt make your hair look funny after a month of use. I have been using only this shampoo for almost 2 months now...</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really enjoy the smell of this line of shampoo, but it works quite well. I am still searching for a truly organic shampoo that doesn&#x27;t leave my hair like I  just poured grease over my head. Although this doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy, it isn&#x27;t completely organic, either.</li>
    <li> Pretty good shampoo. Not my favorite, but I will likely try a different one in the same brand. Scent is nice not to strong.</li>
    <li> I have colored hair - red.  This shampoo may be the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  It makes my hair manage better than any other.  And my hair shines like crazy!  I highly recommend it, even for non-colored hair.  It&#x27;s not so expensive that you can&#x27;t afford to try it.  I love that it is a safe shampoo for my hair.</li>
    <li> Thank you. A large bottle , great price, good supply.</li>
    <li> The product is good but I stopped using it because this bottle design is AWFUL.  I could put it in another bottle and I will when I have to empty bottles (I bought the matching shampoo).  I saw in the store recently they&#x27;ve changed the bottle design, which is a good thing.  It smells really good and your hair feels good and smells very fresh after use.</li>
    <li> Since switching to this shampoo, my hair looks and feels so much healthier.  I was surprised at how well it cleaned my hair without leaving it feeling stripped and dry.  My hair stays softer and cleaner between washings and doesn&#x27;t get itchy or oily like it has with other hair products.  There is a nice cucumber scent while lathering, but after rinsing and drying the scent is very light and fresh which I like.  I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to see how well my hair color holds up over time, but my hair is so much healthier that it makes my color look even better.</li>
    <li> I gave the 4 stars because it really doesn&#x27;t give manageable hair, but I love it because it is one of the best of natural shampoos. I researched it and it has zero harmful chemicals. I have severe psoriasis of the scalp and forehead in the wintertime and I put 20-30 drops of tea tree oil in it and have no problems at all. Great base for it. I use a salon tea tree oil conditioner (unfortunately it has most of the bad chemicals) that leaves my hair very manageable and shiny. I just put it on the lower 2/3rds of my hair and don&#x27;t get it on my scalp an rinse it well.</li>
    <li> I started using this shampoo four months ago when I began coloring my hair. I also use another high-end product on special occasions because it&#x27;s too spendy for daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought Yes To Cucumbers after reading the reviews with the hope that I had found a reasonably-priced product that would protect my color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this does protect my hair to some degree, I lose a LOT more color than with the higher-end &#x27;poo. I&#x27;ve tested this over the course of several treatments and washings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, I noticed that I was losing a lot more hair than usual. At first I told myself that it was seasonal, but four months later there is no way it&#x27;s coincidental.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is fine, and my hair felt OK. Those are the only redeeming qualities to this stuff. I use other Yes To products and thought I had found another gem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am throwing away what&#x27;s left in the bottle and will never touch this stuff again.</li>
    <li> Delicious cucumber melon scent, gentle rich lather never dries my colored hair out. Keeps hair in great condition :) great subscribe and save pricing!</li>
    <li> I love the entire Yes To line of products, and couldn&#x27;t be happier with this shampoo! Definitely comparable to other color care shampoos like Paul Mitchell. I find that my hair smells great, feels great, feels clean, and this shampoo hasn&#x27;t washed all the color from my hair!</li>
    <li> Works well on my color treated hair.  I like that it is a little bit more &amp;#34;safe&amp;#34; than other more chemical laden shampoos that are usually marketed for color treated hair.  Smell is pleasant too</li>
    <li> Lathers nicely with just a little product (I have long, thick hair and still need only use a small amount), and it smells delicious--fresh and clean. My son loves to use it, too.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t speak to the &amp;#34;color care&amp;#34; aspect, because I&#x27;m don&#x27;t know the science behind it, and I haven&#x27;t really notice much of a difference one way or another. My color hasn&#x27;t faded, so I suppose that&#x27;s a good sign.&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner is just as nice.</li>
    <li> Yes To Cucumber Color Care Shampoo is a new favorite of mine. The scent is light and fresh and I like that it doesn&#x27;t have all of the chemicals that other shampoos on the market have.</li>
    <li> So far loving it. Feels great and you can feel the lack of chemicals. Refreshing and smells great. Decent value as well.</li>
    <li> I like the ingredient list, (natural), and it does do a great job of cleaning. Not a great lather, so it can be tempting to use too much, and if you do, hair will be too clean and tangled. Lather doesn&#x27;t mean clean, so less is more in this case. The Cucumber conditioner adds the shine, silkiness and manageability back in beautifully! Recommend buying the conditioner with this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I really love this shampoo. I have been looking far and wide for an organic shampoo that actually does the job. I&#x27;ve been a convert for a few years now and I&#x27;ll never go back to other shampoos. It really does help preserve the color of your hair. It&#x27;s also a great, clean scent. Not &amp;#34;perfumey&amp;#34; like other shampoos can be.</li>
    <li> Although I have never tried this product, I decided against purchasing it after researching it&#x27;s 2nd ingredient, Sodium Coceth Sulfate.  [...]</li>
    <li> A shampoo that is affordable and good quality. I have tried them all and with my newly dyed hair it was ridiculous how much time I spent in the shampoo aisle trying to find an &#x27;&#x27;honest&#x27;&#x27; advertisement. I would read the ingredients and there were always sulfates etc that made me put the product right back down.  Yes to cucumbers is very gentle and nourishing. I wash my colored hair everyday and it hasn&#x27;t stripped out so far. Butts bees is a good line but their hair products are terrible and the sulfate free line from l&#x27;oreal SUCKS. You don&#x27;t even need conditioner really with this product and my hair sort of feels like horse hair naturally (slightly rough.) I&#x27;m educated about my hair products but its a relief not to have to think so hard about finding a simple gentle product.</li>
    <li> This shampoo has been great. It&#x27;s really gentle, and the ingredients are very natural.  The Environmental Working Group - which is a great resource for finding good quality, non-toxic personal care and cleaning products - gave it a great rating. And I find that both my husband (who does not have color-treated hair) and I can use it daily. The scent is very light and fresh, not like cucumbers or any particular fruit or vegetable - just fresh and clean. And it subs up a lot and removes oil and styling products, even without SLS and other nasty chemicals.  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. It works great on color treated hair and it is one of the few shampoos that my hair does not get resistant to working on. Also, I really prefer the natural ingredient based approach of the company and the clever advertising for the products. It actually feels fun to use them!</li>
    <li> This shampoo smells like fresh cut cucumbers and does a good job keeping your hair clean.  My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t add any shine.</li>
    <li> My daughter uses this on her colored natural african-american hair and it works very well. She just loves the scent.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo so much. I&#x27;m on my second bottle and don&#x27;t plan on changing. I have fine, straight hair with an oil scalp, and I also color my hair. This shampoo gives my hair body, improves the texture and cleans all of the oil out of my hair while leaving it moisturized. I even don&#x27;t have to use conditioner any more. When I do on occasion use conditioner, I like the Yes to Cucumber Color Care Conditioner as well. One bottle of that will last me forever.</li>
    <li> I think the wide range of reviews of hair products in general are attributable to the type of hair one has. I&#x27;ve got very course, porous, thick hair, which is also very frizzy and kinky in some areas with fairly nice curls in others. In other words, uneven and a nightmare! Now that I&#x27;m older I also get it colored with partial highlights in front where there&#x27;s a lot of gray, and an overall glaze to blend it in with and perk up my natural color elsewhere. The color treatments actually improve my hair texture, which I think is characteristic of non-bleach quality coloring lines these days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I discovered YesTo cruising the internet for products with none of the harmful ingredients that keep coming up, including parabens, sodium chloride (ie, salt---hard on color and relaxing treatments), sulphates, and other extra undesirables. I used to use Burt&#x27;s Bees, but it didn&#x27;t leave my hair close to as shiny and soft. It was also un-lathery, though I appreciate the purity of their products overall.&lt;br /&gt;But with YesTo my hair feels downright silky! I didn&#x27;t think it was possible without some of those unwanted ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance is also personal, but I&#x27;ve always liked cucumber and green tea-type fragrances if there have to be any. I hate sweet (fruity) ones and cucumber is more neutral and lighter than most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the nozzles clogging up as one reviewer mentioned, I find that true with all types of nozzles, whether it be hair products or lotions. I use a toothpick and hot water to clear them but sometimes I give up and just take off the tops.</li>
    <li> This stuff is seriously awesome and smells better than the shampoo which already smells great! Took a risk buying blindly and was blessed to get a great product.</li>
