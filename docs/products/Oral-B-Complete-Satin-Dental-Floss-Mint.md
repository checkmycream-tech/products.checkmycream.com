      <li>It is smooth as satin ;-)</li>
      <li>Great for people whose teeth are tight together.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> great product for my teeth</li>
    <li> If you either want a stronger floss or your teeth are very tight, this is the solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead of a thread, this is a ribbon, so you get the strength of more material in its width, and the super thinness at the same time.</li>
    <li> Gets in between your teeth easily but that&#x27;s about it! Its like a thin flat slippery ribbon that slides in and out of your teeth well but it doesnt feel like it cleans or scrapes your teeth.  Personally I like my floos to feel a bit like a round rope and not a flat slippery ribbon.</li>
    <li> great product, no shipping issues</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why this is cheaper than the OTHER floss, but it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of dentist friends. They all recommend this to me. Feels like I get a better cleaning when I use this.</li>
    <li> I am not as happy with this product as I thought I would be from alll the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;It can&#x27;t hold a candle to Glide, especially the high end Glide products.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s thin, tears easily, and doesn&#x27;t feel as good to my gums.</li>
    <li> Strongest floss out there</li>
    <li> I like the tape better than the floss/string.</li>
    <li> Just what the doctor ordered, one of the better floss out there and doesn&#x27;t shred between your teeth</li>
    <li> I like this dental floss because it is strong (does not break) and it is wide allowing an adequate surface for cleaning between teeth.  This product is unique, and I prefer it over any of the other alternatives on the market.</li>
    <li> The thread doesn&#x27;t stay smooth, sometimes it shreds.</li>
    <li> This is the best dental floss. I have some tight spots between teeth. This floss glides through beautifully.</li>
    <li> Makes my mouth feel so clean.</li>
    <li> I use this floss, because it was recommended to me by my dentist. I like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t get cut when the gap between your teeth is too narrow.</li>
    <li> strong and smells nice!</li>
    <li> We purchased it for a better deal last time, but they arrived on time and as described.</li>
    <li> floss at least once a day, keep the dentist at bay</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Oral B satin floss before, and in my memory it did not fray nearly as much as this one did. I have relatively tight teeth, and I get bits of this floss stuck between them. Not sure why the quality is so poor</li>
    <li> Great for people whose teeth are tight together. Slips through easily without tearing or shredding, and does a good job.</li>
    <li> Daily reminder for you to floss! Your gums will thank you!</li>
    <li> Strong and good thread, minty aroma.</li>
    <li> I think there is an important trade off to note if you are considering glide vs satin vs traditional. In order of getting in between the teeth with ease I&#x27;d say its Glide &amp;#62; Satin &amp;#62; traditional. On the other hand I feel like glide doesn&#x27;t scrape the teeth as well as the others. It seems to glide over plaque if you will. The point of flossing to me is to scrape the plaque off so in this sense I prefer the Satin. In order of scraping the plaque off I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s Satin &amp;#62; traditional &amp;#62; Glide. I use one piece to get all of my teeth with very little to no fraying.</li>
    <li> My teeth are relatively close together and other floss would shred and get caught. That is really uncomfortable. I find that the satin floss shreds less and glide more smoothly between the teeth.</li>
    <li> Got some other brand at Costco that I had to return because the floss would break.  This brand holds and allows one to do the job.  Interesting to note that a backpacker website says floss is an essential on the trail and off.  This is certainly something you&#x27;d want to have at home (or on your person) when needed.  I&#x27;ll buy these again when my supply runs low.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many a floss over the past several decades (I&#x27;m almost 50 and have always flossed regularly), and this floss is by far the best. Luckily, the price has come down considerably since about 10 or 15 years ago. In my experience, it has never shred (unlike Crest&#x27;s Glide floss), and it slips so easily in and out between teeth. It&#x27;s flat, not round, but that does not affect its ability to remove food and other particles left after brushing.</li>
    <li> Tape Floss is very important for people who can&#x27;t stand the thread floss which shreds rather readily. This one is the thinner type. I&#x27;ve used the thicker version and like both. If you&#x27;re more careful with this thinner brand you&#x27;ll like it</li>
    <li> fast delivery. No floss as good as Irish made floss.</li>
    <li> My teeth are very close together, this is the only floss that doesn&#x27;t tear apart.  Very good quality, and a fair price.</li>
    <li> The satin floss shreds easily.  You can shift positions by unrolling on one finger and rolling on the other to keep it from shredding and breaking off completely.  A bit disappointed after my dentist said this is the best.  I&#x27;ll be going back to Reach Total Care to avoid the shredding.</li>
    <li> good floss. good price.</li>
    <li> Great dental floss that works well and leaves a fresh taste.</li>
    <li> Thought this was the higher-quality tape ribbon (Pro-Health) but it was not.  Plus it seemed that the product was old or was left exposed to extreme temperatures, because the wax around the floss no longer adheres to the filament surface.  Product frays and tears easily when I use it.</li>
    <li> NICE TEXTURE BUT BREAKS TOO EASILY</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a couple of other flosses in my day and I find that this floss does its job far better than any other floss, without fraying. I don&#x27;t know if this is true, but my dentist recommends this floss and another no-brand floss, because they found it to leave the least amount of waxy residue. I&#x27;ve used the no-brand floss they tout at their office, but it&#x27;s very harsh and painful to use. In my experience, Oral-B Satin is the best floss out there.</li>
    <li> I used to use Johnson and Johnson waxed mint, and for a long time thought I had gum disease. Every day I would floss with it, and every day my gums would bleed. It was really frustrating--not to mention gross--especially since I take good care of my teeth. I talked to my dentist about it and he just said that with regular flossing it would stop once it had healed. Well, I recently went to a new dentist, and the hygienist used Oral B Satinfloss--OMG, no bleeding! Perfect pink gums after every floss! It&#x27;s like smooth, gentle paper, instead of that sadistic knife-string from J &amp; J. I ordered a 2-pack as soon as I got home, and will never use anything else!</li>
    <li> This is waxed, but not excessively like some flosses, so I find it can &amp;#34;grip&amp;#34; and extract food particles better than other flosses, it doesn&#x27;t shred, and I like the subtle mint flavor.</li>
    <li> I love tape like Glide etc. for floss, and this is sort of like that except when pulled tight it becomes very narrow and sharp. Not comfy on the gums nor fingers.</li>
    <li> Great floss-- doesn&#x27;t shred.</li>
    <li> My dentist gives this to every patient she sees because she believes in this product. I love it because I have tight gaps between my teeth and this flat ribbon floss easily slips between my teeth and helps to clean even those hard to reach places. It holds up much better than the round style of flosses. I like the minty taste it leaves behind and most of all I like the feeling of having clean teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very good product and I recommend it to you.</li>
    <li> For me, this floss has the right amount of strength, thickness and glide.  Very easy to use, and &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; it on the tooth surface. Give it a try.</li>
    <li> I have tried several flosses and I like this kind the best, doesn&#x27;t have to be Satin but it is a plus in my book</li>
    <li> This is the only floss that works with my teeth; it&#x27;s perfect for teeth with close contact with one another, it shreds a little as you use it (as most flosses do) but doesn&#x27;t get stuck between your teeth or tear apart.</li>
    <li> I have tried and cannot get this floss to go between my back, tight-to-each-other chompers. The mint is just not there, either. (I just tried to make out with this floss, so this report is \\&quot;fresh\\&quot;...get it?!) The price is decent when compared to \\&quot;Glide\\&quot; in Target. I am now gonna glide over this above stuff. No hard feelings.</li>
    <li> I was concerned that they would ship me an elephant, but I was relieved to find good old dental floss instead</li>
    <li> Breaks too easily and leaves strings in your teeth. The Oral B stuff in cheaper packaging from KMart is way better. I think it&#x27;s this one: http://www.amazon.com/Oral-B-Essential-Floss-Mint-Waxed/dp/B001FWXTJ6/ref&#x3D;sr_1_66?s&#x3D;hpc&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1402606582&amp;sr&#x3D;1-66</li>
    <li> The quality of this product is not satisfactory.  The floss is much thinner that in other packages that&lt;br /&gt;I have used.  I am wondering of this is a factory second??  Very disappointed</li>
    <li> This is one of the only types of floss that will get through my teeth. Most others fray and break three or four times and end up leaving bits of floss stuck between my teeth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other floss and this is the best one I&#x27;ve ever used. I have a very tight spaces between my teeth and Sa Tinfloss does the job. Use it every day and keeps my teeth feeling clean.</li>
    <li> I am the main Satinfloss user in my home. My dentist gives this floss in a sample size every time my teeth are cleaned. I don&#x27;t care how little mint flavor is on the floss as I would prefer no flavoring. The price with subscribe and save beats the local store price, and I don&#x27;t have to search for this dental floss in the myriad of other dental flosses on the store shelf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oral-B Satinfloss works on my teeth, three full bridges, and not too tight teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband uses another name brand dental floss that is more standard in the round floss shape. His teeth are very tight to each other.</li>
    <li> This is the only floss that doesn&#x27;t take a lot of effort to get between my back teeth. The price on Amazon can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> Pretty much the only floss I can use.  Fits easily between tight teeth.</li>
    <li> One of the only ones that is strong and rarely breaks.  mint flavor is not to strong.  Best floss on the market IMO</li>
    <li> Great Floss! I&#x27;ll keep buying it over and over because I can&#x27;t live with out it and this is a great product!</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  It gets the job done.  Strong enough that it doesn&#x27;t rip apart (my teeth are very close to each other).  My dentist, who is THE BEST, recommended this.</li>
    <li> Nothing bad to say about this floss. Works really well!</li>
    <li> I have tried Glide and Johnson &amp; Johnson, but I really prefer the SatinFloss to the others. It hardly ever shreds, and it doesn&#x27;t stick in my teeth. It&#x27;s great that Amazon offers this as an &amp;#34;add-on&amp;#34;, allowing me to get a great price if I allow them to ship it along with something else I&#x27;m already buying.</li>
    <li> I ordered satin tape and received satin floss.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great quality product.</li>
    <li> I like ribbon floss and this is the one I like the best so far. Mint flavoring is not overbearing and my hygienist seems to like the job it does.</li>
    <li> pretty good flose&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ez to prevent gingervitus&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ez to have perfect teeth</li>
    <li> I got this for our family, we floss everyday. The wax coating help during flossing and we like peppermint flavor.</li>
    <li> Gentle to the gums yet a thorough cleaning between teeth</li>
    <li> ORAL-B COMPLETE SATIN TAPE.  This is a wide  satin like tape which should move between the teeth crevices easily, with minimal disintegrating or cracking. It will effectively dislodge plaque and particles between teeth and just below the gumline.  The mint flavor is refreshing, and it is fairly comfortable and easy to use. It is made by Oral-B, a respected name in the dentifrice field for many years, which offers a satisfaction guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dentist first recommended this product to me, and I find it very helpful, more effective than ordinary flossing tape.  That is, when I can find it: many drug stores don&#x27;t carry the satin tape.  It is also reasonably priced for a superior product.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to anyone seeking top of the line floss. It is gentle on the gums,  yet powerful enough to take all the gunk in between teeth. If you have sensitive gums like I do, definitely consider purchasing this brand.</li>
    <li> This floss is garbage. It is too fragile that it&#x27;s stuck between my teeth, and I tried very hard to take it out. Never buy this product.</li>
    <li> falls apart.... I ordered these by accident... the tape is awesome.</li>
    <li> Good quality floss. Should not miss</li>
    <li> The best dental floss I ever used in my life.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried every brand and gadget. I&#x27;ve stuck with this floss for nearly 2 years now. If you have right spacing you&#x27;ll like this floss. Most of my issues with floss have been getting boat rope between your teeth. This stuff consistently makes flossing a thing to do and not a chore. Price is consistent with others and yardage is yardage like the rest.</li>
    <li> I like these best of all flosses.</li>
    <li> I just do not like this floss. I feel like bits of it come off and get stuck between my teeth, and the strands don&#x27;t stay together. Went back to my usual brand.</li>
    <li> ordinary dental floss</li>
    <li> good price. one less thing to think about. glad available as subscription. probably wouldn&#x27;t get it if not available as a subscription.</li>
    <li> Well packaged and good quality floss. It doesn&#x27;t shred. Has a minty taste.</li>
    <li> Very good. Thin and pleasant. Good value, but finding used floss might be a better bargain!</li>
    <li> Perfect for sensitive gums.</li>
    <li> Had braces years ago and things are still fairly well lined up... but stopped using the retainer a couple decades ago, and now there are a few really tight places that make flossing a challenge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regular floss often (usually) frays and breaks in those tight areas, and some of the floss tapes are so slick that they slip out of my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not have those experiences with this floss; it is not &#x27;slippery&#x27; like some of the tape types, it is able to get into those hard-to-reach areas, it seems to be tough (no fraying or breaking right away like others we have tried) yet it feels soft on gums and fingers. The light minty taste is nice too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a similar need, we definitely recommend that you give this floss a try.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years!  My favorite unwaxed dental floss!</li>
    <li> Ever since the original Glide days, I&#x27;ve been looking for something suitable, but only getting passable.  Decided to give this one a try.  Still looking.  It works okay, but still shreds and feels as if it&#x27;s going to break when pulled, but it holds.  Not very minty (that&#x27;s fine) and the friction to remove plaque is okay.  It is very thin, so it does have the potential to cut your gums easily if you&#x27;re not careful.  I really don&#x27;t know why the original Glide of about 14 yrs. ago could not be remade today?</li>
    <li> This is the only dental floss I will use.  My teeth are very tightly spaced and this floss does not shred or get stuck.</li>
    <li> Great floss without gum irritation.</li>
    <li> Its dental floss. Nothing to talk about here</li>
    <li> This is NOT Oral B Glide!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made the mistake of assuming all of the floss out today was the silky smooth Oral-B Glide.  This is branded Oral-B and the see through case is similar, but the Oral-B Complete is NOT the same as the Oral-B Glide.  This floss shreds and will fray and leave pieces of the floss in your teeth that you&#x27;ll attempt to remove with more floss that will potentially shred again. Get the good stuff, get the Oral-B Glide Pro Health!!</li>
    <li> Cleans my teeth, thin enough to get within the gaps, doesn&#x27;t taste too minty which I like and doesn&#x27;t break easily.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s floss what else can you rave about? LOL  I do prefer the smoothness of the Satin floss from Oral B.</li>
    <li> Best kind of dental floss there is!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried the generic knock offs of this floss and it just shreds in your teeth. This is great stuff and to one of the few items I&#x27;m very brand loyal. If you have tight areas between your teeth, this is great, it&#x27;s really smooth and flat and slides right in. I always get good check ups :-D</li>
    <li> My wife and I have been using this floss for a long time. We&#x27;ve tried others but keep coming back to it. One thing I&#x27;ve learned is that if you want to ensure that you&#x27;ll floss regularly you have to make it as easy as you can. Well, the silky floss is a lot easier to get into hard to reach spots than the regular kind. Satin floss works.</li>
    <li> Smooth and best floss I&#x27;ve used</li>
    <li> I get better results flossing with a plastic grocery bag. This stuff is just painful and shreds as much as the super-cheap brands do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Pro Health Deep Clean floss, and it&#x27;s just better than this in every way. That&#x27;s all I can say. Take the two, compare, and see for yourself.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t break apart as easily as standard floss.</li>
    <li> My teeth are really close together and this is the only floss thin enough for me to use.  It is durable enough for one strand to floss all my teeth without breaking.  Solid product.  Good buy.</li>
    <li> Horrid product. The worst floss I have ever used. Breaks too easily and leaves strings in your teeth. Snaps  back like a rubber band spraying dirt everywhere. Cheap garbage.</li>
    <li> I have been using Oral-B Floss for years.  No complaints and does the job.  Recommended.</li>
    <li> Works very well.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> Containers bigger and offers more product than expected.</li>
    <li> Great price and great product. It tastes good and it doesn&#x27;t break too easily when pressure is put on it.</li>
    <li> This is the kind of floss I always get, and the price was significantly better on Amazon. Most floss gets stuck in my teeth, or breaks while I floss. This is much less of an issue with this one.</li>
    <li> Are any of these reviews real?  This is a disgraceful floss that starts falling apart after 2 or 3 insertions between your teeth.  After you&#x27;re done, it feels like you have to floss a second time just to fish out the shredded strands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t use to be this way.  I consistently used Oral-B floss for years starting around 2000, but right around 2007 they downgraded to this lower-quality material (for both their \\&quot;Satin Floss\\&quot; and \\&quot;Satin Tape\\&quot; lines), and so it remains to this day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main alternatives are Glide (now owned by Oral-B, strangely enough) and Johnson &amp; Johnson&#x27;s Reach.  I&#x27;ve had better luck with both of those, though Reach is a tad thick.</li>
    <li> I receive this as part of my monthly &amp;#34;Subscribe and Save&amp;#34; purchases.  This item came separately, packed in a box in which 50 of these could easily have fit.  Why Amazon, why?</li>
    <li> I thought that this might be a good floss, but when it arrived and I took some out, dang! talk about thin! instead of a little bit roundish, to be able to lift the food out, it just slides back out with out nothing!!</li>
    <li> It cleans between your teeth. What more can you say. I still get the occasional cavity but really can&#x27;t blame that on the floss.</li>
    <li> Works easily into tight spaces.</li>
    <li> Excellent!  I have very tight contact points with my teeth.  Every other brand of gloss except for Glide shreds between my teeth and traumatizes my fingers.  I love the flavor and it slides between my teeth with minimal effort.  Very durable floss.  Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Mint flavor, not over powering.  Works well for flossing your teeth.</li>
    <li> I am a dental hygiene freak. This is the best floss ever.</li>
    <li> It is smooth as satin ;-)</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo25FFL6TXOV4Y3]]Package looks pretty cool which I like. Floss is ribbon type, not satin tho, a bit rough instead! Its on the thick side and doesnt glide smooth between my teeth, I dont complain due to this item is decent for the price, but I wont repurchase and go back to Glide.</li>
    <li> Hard to complain about dental floss.  As described.</li>
    <li> Gentle and smooth on teeth and gums!</li>
    <li> very effective.  good price.  shipped to the door.  nice flavor, too.</li>
