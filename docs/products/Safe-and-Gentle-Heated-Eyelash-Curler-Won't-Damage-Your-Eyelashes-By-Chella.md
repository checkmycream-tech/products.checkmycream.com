      <li>Really liked the results of this product.  </li>

      <li>I liked this product while it worked, but I didn&#x27;t love it.  </li>
      <li>I really love this brilliant product and it works very well</li>
      <li>using an eyelash curler can rip off so many lashes for me and yet it doesnt even give me the curl this heated eyelash curler gives.</li>

      <li>Feel safe using this product.  </li>
      <li>It mostly just melted the mascara onto my face.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>and I am so glad that I could find it here.</li>
      <li>Curler heats up fast and works great.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;You do have to do about 20 seconds on 3 sections of your lashes both before and after application of mascara, but the results are phenomenal.  </li>
      <li>Better than a crimper.</li>
      <li>I am looking for another, more robust brand.</li>
      <li>Chella worked OK, but not as efficiently as the JAPONESQUE.</li>
      <li>The Chella eyelash curler has too many spaces in-between the heated spots</li>
      <li>Thought it would work better would not purchase again</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I love this thing.  </li>
      <li>Cute stocking stuffer/easter basket gift.</li>

      <li>It was super easy to use without hesitation, heated up quickly and was a great price.</li>
      <li>A lot of people don&#x27;t care for these curlers but honestly they are so gentle its amazing.</li>
      <li>This one had the best reviews out of them ALL, believe me I checked every single one.</li>
      <li>your lashes so eyes look more open, and works best with fresh battery....</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t feel as cheap as most heated lash curlers do.  </li>
      <li>All in all it&#x27;s going to be a learning process but a good one because so far I love the heated version  way more than the clamping type with does nothing but pull my lashes out...</li>
      <li>I did not notice significant &#x27;curl&#x27;, just a bit more lift with use of this tool.</li>
      <li>Easy to use.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so slender it doesn&#x27;t have anything to grasp to take a part because it not to easy to separate to take the battery out and</li>
      <li>This is easy to use and does curl your lashes.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Another reviewer was correct -- the batteries die VERY quickly on this model (needs replacement weekly)</li>
      <li>and this by far is amazing!</li>
      <li>I love it!&lt;br /&gt;Works better if you use mascara first then the curler</li>
      <li>super safe</li>
      <li>This was advertised by the manufacturer as an excellent product for curling eyelashes after mascara is applied,  and I find that it does this little if at all.  </li>
      <li>Started using Latisse and still wasn&#x27;t seeing a Huge difference.</li>
      <li>The first couple hours of full lashes are amazing though</li>
      <li>Nice alternative and more natural looking.</li>
      <li>I had tried extensions and they ended up breaking off most of my lashes, so after re-growing, I wanted to be more gentle on them.</li>
      <li>quick to heat  easy to use</li>
      <li>originally bought as a gift but another was purchased for myself.</li>
      <li>*** should be fired RIGHT NOW!</li>
      <li>Lashes look full and noticeable.  </li>
      <li>After about a month of using this (and not pulling them out every morning), sure enough they all FINALLY filled in and the Latisse was able to do the rest.</li>
      <li>Good luck, sorry you had to read the whole novel to learn I LOVE THIS!!!</li>
      <li>super compact&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>the battery life sticks luckily</li>
      <li>Bought it for Wifey, she likes it very much!</li>
      <li>I think someone who wears dark mascara (it&#x27;s not my thing) would look incredible with this -- it really opens your eyes</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned a lot of eyelash curlers.  I feel like I can throw all those away now, because of this one tool.  This is the best eyelash curler ever.  Makes my eyelashes look like a million bucks!  At first, I was scared I was going to burn off my eyelashes (because the thought of heat anywhere near my eyeball scared the crap out of me), but after using it the first time I was hooked.  The heat is minimal and it&#x27;s just enough to put a shape to my lashes.  Best tool ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. best curler I&#x27;ve ever owned&lt;br /&gt;2. super safe&lt;br /&gt;3. super compact&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. Took forever to get to my house after ordering (because it was back-ordered)</li>
    <li> Regular eyelash curler works better.  I have tried applying it both before and after I put the mascara, and I do not notice any difference</li>
    <li> This is the end of those crimping and pulling manual eyelash curlers.  This product does a great job - people notice my lashes all the time now.  And it&#x27;s so simple and easy to use.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I noticed that my metal curler with foam cushions had A LOT of lashes getting stuck in it, and my lashes were definitely looking thinner.  I read the reviews and thought I would give the battery one a try.  I LOVE IT!  I just turn it on a few minutes before I&#x27;m ready to do my mascara so it&#x27;s all warmed up, hold it on the lashes for 10 seconds in a few different areas, then apply mascara.  I look bright eyed all day!  The instructions said to use after mascara, but I didn&#x27;t want to get it all gunked up.</li>
    <li> Really liked the results of this product.  Definitely follow the product instructions.  You must use on dry mascara and hold for 20 seconds each section.  Wahlah!  Gave it a 4 star due to the short battery life.  The remedy is to always have an extra AAA battery on hand.</li>
    <li> using an eyelash curler can rip off so many lashes for me and yet it doesnt even give me the curl this heated eyelash curler gives. also, it stays up all day and it opens up my eyes. its just so great. 5/5 would recommend.</li>
    <li> Works so much better than the crimp kind.  I love it.</li>
    <li> This a great curler! All I can say is I can&#x27;t live without it. If anyone out there has really straight lashes like myself. This is the only thing I can say that can possibly work out on the market besides getting a semi perm for your lashes. I totally recommend this curler.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really curl my lashes. Wish I could return this. Waste of money. My manual Chanel eyelash curler still works best!</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed with the product.  I unfortunately purchased two of them.  They did not curl my eyelashes at all.</li>
    <li> Heats quickly and it really curled my no so full lashes.  Lashes look full and noticeable.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Love the results of wide-open looking eyes - it certainly beats pinching your eyelids with a traditional eyelash curler!  I&#x27;m only giving it 3 stars because it eats batteries very quickly (every 3-4 days).</li>
    <li> This was advertised by the manufacturer as an excellent product for curling eyelashes after mascara is applied,  and I find that it does this little if at all.  I continue to use my trusty Shu Uemura before applying mascara.  This is not a negative to the seller--that service was prompt and responsive!  I am disappointed in the product only.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t follow the directions the first couple of times, and didn&#x27;t use a little bit of mascara on my lashes before I used the curler. However, I realized that this is similar to trying to curl freshly-washed hair. Your hair needs a bit of &amp;#34;dirt&amp;#34; for the curl to &amp;#34;catch&amp;#34;. Another idea I&#x27;m going to try  is to use a touch (not a lot at all, just at the base of my lashes) of my gel eyeliner and see how that works. Received a lot of compliments on my lashes!</li>
    <li> I am asian with monolids and very very short natural lashes. I do not like false eyelashes but was always looking for a way for my lashes to actually be visible. I&#x27;ve tried dozens of mascaras that promises fullness and lift. After watching a video tutorial on frmheadtotoe.com I thought I would try a heated eyelash curler. I followed the video instructions - use a good mascara, use an eyelash curler then use a heated eyelash curler and it worked like magic! It was super easy to use without hesitation, heated up quickly and was a great price. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I use false and they work well.  No issues, as long as you don&#x27;t hold it on too long.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like it as much as the JAPONESQUE Heated one. The Chella eyelash curler has too many spaces in-between the heated spots so it misses a bunch of my eyelashes which makes me have to go over the lashes several times.  I would have to go over and over them repeatedly to get the same response as the JAPONESQUE. Chella worked OK, but not as efficiently as the JAPONESQUE. Unfortunately the JAPONESQUE breaks on me every 3 months but I haven&#x27;t been able to find anything comparable on amazon.</li>
    <li> This is easy to use and does curl your lashes.  It works better than regular non-heated eyelash curlers.  However, it does sort of melt off some of the mascara on your lashes, so I end up putting on another coat of mascara after using it.</li>
    <li> Did not come with a battery as mentioned on the box,and does not do a good job of curling lashes</li>
    <li> This is nothing to write home about!  I read the reviews before I bought it, and all of them were good.  But now that I bought it, it wasn&#x27;t as good as I thought.  I have short, somewhat thick eyelashes, and I still end up using the regular metal eyelash curler.  I like the ulta metal curler!  With this heated curler, I have to hold it on there for a long time just to get a little curl, and still they don&#x27;t stay curled all day.</li>
    <li> Makes my sparse eyelashes really perk up. If this one wears out I will buy again!</li>
    <li> You have to go over your lashes a few times but it definitely works. Way easier than basic eyelash curler and better for your lashes</li>
    <li> Didnt work, period. Returned.</li>
    <li> I liked the eyelash curler as long as it lasted.  It quite working after only 4 months.  It seems to have developed a short and won&#x27;t stay turned on.  Of course it&#x27;s too late to return it and even if I did, I&#x27;d have to pay for shipping.  Too bad.</li>
    <li> The included battery was dead but the curler worked great once a fresh battery was installed. My lashes only required one pass to curl and lasted all day. Great product!</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews for the Chella Heated Eyelash Curler, I thought I would try it. I am soooo disappointed. This eyelash curler does not curl my eyelashes at all, not even a little bit. I&#x27;ve used heated eyelash curlers before so I know I am using it correctly. The only heated eyelash curler that worked for me is one I bought at Sephora about 5-6 years ago, but they don&#x27;t sell it anymore.</li>
    <li> I have another eyelash curler.  I like to have one for travel and one for everyday.  This works as good as my other one.</li>
    <li> This product is fun to use. It&#x27;s a must try.! Shipment was fast.</li>
    <li> If you follow the directions it curls lashes great! (must use AFTER mascara) However the curl doesn&#x27;t hold all day for me. I read some reviews where clearly some people aren&#x27;t using it right..  I would buy it again if I can&#x27;t find one that will hold all day</li>
    <li> Great product.  Easy to use.  Shipping in time.  Feel safe using this product.  Helps lift and separate lashes.  Would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This item heats up great. Be patient.  It works!</li>
    <li> It seems to work best when you put the mascara on first.  I know this is just the opposite of what you would do with traditional crimp type of curler. Also it takes longer, but the curl lasts longer also. After it heats up, you have to take your time pressing the element against the lash, kinda of molding the lash in the shape you desire.</li>
    <li> I have long lashes and they hit my glasses. It takes awhile to work, but straightens out smahed lashes. Doesn&#x27;t really curl them.</li>
    <li> It did not do anything it was supposed to do including curling my eyelashes. Either with or without mascara the thing did absolutely nothing.</li>
    <li> This was a waste of my money.  I purchased this item and it worked long enough for me to not be eligible to return in.  I am so upset that I spent my money on this.</li>
    <li> Bought this lash curler broke the 2nd day</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel as cheap as most heated lash curlers do.  Works well.  I do wish that there wasn&#x27;t such a space between the lash separators, it doesn&#x27;t separate lashes at all, but does give them a good curl if applied to dry mascara.</li>
    <li> Was fascinated when I discovered this tool. Had to give a try. Was a little nervous at first but works well.</li>
    <li> I did not want to use a &#x27;pinch style&#x27; curler on my lashes...I had tried extensions and they ended up breaking off most of my lashes, so after re-growing, I wanted to be more gentle on them. I liked this curler, although I had to hold it against my lashes for 10-15 seconds to notice any difference.  I did not notice significant &#x27;curl&#x27;, just a bit more lift with use of this tool. I had to use an old toothbrush to clean out the heat coils, since you must use it after applying mascara. I just checked my order history...it has been 45 days since I received this curler.  I have not used it every day - sometimes just on the weekends - and the battery has already gone dead!!    Addendum ( a year later...)   The batteries go dead very quickly in these.  It works well to &#x27;lift&#x27; (not really curl) your lashes so eyes look more open, and works best with fresh battery....less effective as battery wears down.  I get maybe 2 weeks of use out of 1 battery.  The curler died completely after a little more than a year, and the identical replacement I bought died after just one MONTH!!  I only used it it 2-3x per week!  And I am unable to return or replace or exchange it for another because there is only a 30-day policy to do so.</li>
    <li> I still use a small eyelash curler for my outside lashes prior to applying mascara and then use this after 1 coat of mascara &amp; people think I have used fake eyelashes!  I am blessed with thick hair &amp; decent lashes...this helps!  Goes through batteries at an alarming rate, not sure if it is my batteries or the curler.</li>
    <li> This is a nice alternative to bent eyelashes which you get with a regular curler - gently bends them upward with the heat. Nice alternative and more natural looking.</li>
    <li> Works well, but - GOOD GRACIOUS - this things sucks up batteries!!</li>
    <li> Difficult to use.  Doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I have very few eyelashes and kind of straggly.  I place a water proof mascara (but either one works) then use it. So it did not work on my eyes without mascara and no it did not put black mascara smudges with my MaryKay product.  It heats up in like 10 seconds and great lid to automatically turn it off when cap is on.  Not too hot but be careful not to hit your contact lenses.  I just press up like your flat ironing your eyelashes against eye lid and Viola!  Definitely better than the hand squeezing old fashion eye lash curler.  The batteries that came with it only lasted me about a month.  Overall great gift that most women probably dont own.  Cute stocking stuffer/easter basket gift. Good price too.</li>
    <li> I think it is a great product, easy to use.  It is small, nice for travel since it uses batteries.</li>
    <li> Thought it would work better would not purchase again</li>
    <li> Bought it for Wifey, she likes it very much! Say&#x27;s it&#x27;s the best one she has ever used. It&#x27;s tiny, not much bigger than an actual battery!</li>
    <li> Tis works well and no more breaking eyelashes with a regular curler</li>
    <li> It works but it is already falling apart. It lasted just long enough to make me love it. I am looking for another, more robust brand.</li>
    <li> My eyelashes are stick straight go grow straight out. It is more obvious when I wear mascara, so I&#x27;d stopped wearing makeup altogether. Eyelash curlers never really worked for me at all. That is, until I ordered the Chella. This thing is AWESOME! The amount of heat is just right and the curl lasts all day. I&#x27;m already telling every woman I know about it! The only down side is that it does go through batteries rather quickly, but totally worth the investment!</li>
    <li> Giving it 4.5 stars because it is REALLY hard to find an eyelash curler that works for my super-straight lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Traditional eyelash curlers pulled my lashes and can&#x27;t be good for them.  More practically they didn&#x27;t just didn&#x27;t work (and I&#x27;ve bought several of them). They would &amp;#34;curve&amp;#34; my lashes for about 10 minutes before my lashes would go straight again. I tried heating the traditional curlers with a blow dryer before curling and I only hurt my eyelids with the heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading the reviews for EVERY heated curler on the market, and getting the advice of eyelash extension experts, I decided to try this model.  I have to say, just because it works for me when nothing else ever has, I give it 4.5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do have to do about 20 seconds on 3 sections of your lashes both before and after application of mascara, but the results are phenomenal.  And, they don&#x27;t hurt my lashes or my eyelids in any way during the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another reviewer was correct -- the batteries die VERY quickly on this model (needs replacement weekly) so if the manufacturer or a competitor was to improve it, I&#x27;d say fix that one issue, and you&#x27;d have a 5-star product.</li>
    <li> The curler doesn&#x27;t get hot at all. Overall, a poor investment. Stick to manual ones, ladies.</li>
    <li> I own two other heated eyelash curlers, their good but one has too big of a comb and the lashes some  times touches the heat and and sometime not...and the other one is also good but the comb has a curve to it and if I touch to the corner of my lashes the other part is away from the base of my lid...This one is straight and thin so it touches all my lashes just like I wanted ...I have only had all of these for a couple of weeks and this one I received yesterday only used it twice so not sure how long they will last, I agree with the others the battery life sticks luckily I have a battery charger so every time I use them I recharge them... and also another tid bit of info take the battery out after ever use that also help.. My only complaint so far with this one is It&#x27;s so slender it doesn&#x27;t have anything to grasp to take a part because it not to easy to separate to take the battery out and it hard to take the battery out too... All in all it&#x27;s going to be a learning process but a good one because so far I love the heated version  way more than the clamping type with does nothing but pull my lashes out...And I already have short stubby straight fine lashes to begin with....</li>
    <li> So after my 2nd child, and an &#x27;advanced maternal age&#x27;, my former super long lashes went the way of the 20&#x27;s &amp;#34;I can eat anything I want metabolism&#x27;.  I tried everything and even lost them all on one eye after my daughter was born. Love hormones! So getting them back in was an uphill battle. Started using Latisse and still wasn&#x27;t seeing a Huge difference. My Dermatologist said that I absolutely HAD to give up the eyelash curler because it was pulling out all my new frail lashes. I didn&#x27;t understand the point of have lashes if I couldn&#x27;t curl my super stick straight whispies. Did my research and heated curlers are definitely not loved across the board. This one had the best reviews out of them ALL, believe me I checked every single one. After about a month of using this (and not pulling them out every morning), sure enough they all FINALLY filled in and the Latisse was able to do the rest. Almost daily, (I swear) I am complimented on the crazy length and curl. Here&#x27;s my best suggestion: curl before &amp; after mascara application!! I was hesitant to do this because I didn&#x27;t want it to get all goopy and dirty. Didn&#x27;t happen. I do it a bit longer than the recommended 5-10 seconds each section (prob 20 secs for 3 sections per eye). Apply 2 coats, let them dry (the time it takes me to apply mascara to bottom lashes and put away make up) &amp; repeat the curl not the xtra mascara. YES, it takes a bit longer than the old routine but ABSOLUTELY worth every extra minute to have my lashes back &amp; I have 2 little ones mind you! Curl stays all day! Good luck, sorry you had to read the whole novel to learn I LOVE THIS!!!</li>
    <li> quick to heat  easy to use</li>
    <li> A lot of people don&#x27;t care for these curlers but honestly they are so gentle its amazing. You definitely have to be patient when using but if you take your time with them the curl is worth it. I&#x27;ve seen a lot of reviews done with these types of curlers and the effect isn&#x27;t great but the person did not take their time when using it! It works great pre and post mascara and holds the curl forever! this is perfect for people with virtually no eyelashes and also people with thick eyelashes that droop down. I&#x27;m buying this as gifts for my family too because we are all looking for the perfect tool for our eyelashes and this by far is amazing! Will update with any malfunctions!</li>
    <li> It mostly just melted the mascara onto my face.</li>
    <li> I bought this when it was on sale through Groupon and I am so glad that I could find it here. This thing is amazing. I use it after applying mascara and letting it dry for a bit. Not only is it a lot faster than using a traditional curler, but there is no pulling out eyelashes which has always concerned me.</li>
    <li> Kills your battery pretty fast but does do the job of curling my lashes. I typically curl with a regular curler, apply waterproof mascara and then curl them with the heated curler and it works perfectly.</li>
    <li> I liked this product while it worked, but I didn&#x27;t love it.  It didn&#x27;t create much curl, so I just used it as an added step to supplement my regular eyelash curler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery drains pretty quickly.  After my second battery, it just wouldn&#x27;t work.  I want a refund.</li>
    <li> Well, the only pro of this curler is that you can use it after applying the mascara. But it took a huge amount of time to curl your eyelash than a usual normal one.</li>
    <li> Works very well. Worth every penny. Looks like I have on false lashes!</li>
    <li> This does not get hot enough.  I understand why the manufacturer would be careful not to burn your eyelids.  It should be capable to curl or at least flex your lashes.  I have been on the hunt to replace an awesome one I got at the salon, &amp; still have not found it.  This one I use to unclump mascara beautifully.</li>
    <li> I really love this brilliant product and it works very well, however I have had it for 16 days now and I am on my THIRD BRAND NEW battery.  Really????</li>
    <li> battery life sucks, its not worth getting. just stick to the traditional eye lash curlers. these arent worth the money</li>
    <li> I recommend this product.  This eyelash curler works great.  Very easy to use and great price.</li>
    <li> Seems to melt my lashes together when used with mascara. Curl doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve prayed for curly lashes all my life and this is the only appliance that really works! I&#x27;ve crimped and torn out lashes; I&#x27;ve tried the fakes which would lift at the edges! Nothing worked until THIS. It&#x27;s amazing and the curl lasts all day--until you wash your face and remove your mascara. It is made to use with mascara and I love the look!</li>
    <li> It heats up very quickly and does a great job curling your eyelashes.  The warmth eliminates that bend I would always get with a traditional eyelash curler.</li>
    <li> I got this because I saw it recommended in Real Simple Magazine. I don&#x27;t wear a lot of makeup and my eyelashes are almost blonde so they kind of disappear. I thought this would help. You have to put a layer of mascara on, wait until it dries and they use this. Honestly, I didn&#x27;t see any difference. I&#x27;ve tried it several times and still nothing.</li>
    <li> I have short lashes so this may work better with longer lashes. It helps lift lashes, but does not replace eyelash curler.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work well and the batteries wore out after just a few times of use.  Not worth it to me. I will just go back to my old regular  metal one.</li>
    <li> Love this product!!! I don&#x27;t have to use an eyelash curler ever again. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5-stars is because the battery dies really fast. Wish it could last longer.</li>
    <li> Works better then traditional curlers, but it only lasts a few hours &amp; is hard to clean. The first couple hours of full lashes are amazing though</li>
    <li> After reading reviews and having used a heated eyelash curler in the past I was really excited to get this item. It just doesn&#x27;t really curl my lashes. I have been using Latisse and have long lashes but the crimping curler works better. I leave it on for two minutes and then press it against my lashes so they are vertical for 20 seconds and I can feel the heat on my eyelid but they don&#x27;t curl that much. I have tried for 30 seconds on different sections of my eyelashes but there isn&#x27;t really a noticeable difference. Then I add mascara and wait until it is dried and repeat this whole process takes me about 10 minutes and the results aren&#x27;t that noticeable compared.</li>
    <li> Maybe I&#x27;m doing it wrong, so I don&#x27;t want to give it a bad review...but it&#x27;s NOT cool that there&#x27;s no directions.</li>
    <li> Love it. Perfect for curling straight lashes.  originally bought as a gift but another was purchased for myself.</li>
    <li> I never knew there were heated eye last curls until I saw them on Amazon.  I love this thing.  I actually have eyelashes that you can see now!  There is not pulling or pinching like you get with the manual curls.  I LOVE it!</li>
    <li> Great packaging. Curler heats up fast and works great.  My eyelashes are very straight and they actually curl up with this curler.</li>
    <li> I bought this product off the recommendation of a blog, but it was not what I expected. I thought that it would be pain free and effective, but it was too hot and my eyelashes were not really curled. I wasn&#x27;t happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Works OK. Better than a crimper.</li>
    <li> This is the most absurd, ridiculous thing I&#x27;ve ever purchased from Amazon.  This s*** piece of junk was nonfunctional on delivery, worth nothing and made me feel abused for $20; it&#x27;s like I ordered something from a comic book ad from 1977.  Really?  I mean really, Amazon?  Whoever approved this s*** should be fired RIGHT NOW! Do not order this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been curious about heated eyelash curlers since I can&#x27;t stand the pinch of traditional curlers. I&#x27;m also not going to warm one up with a hair dryer--who has the time for that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saw this written up in a magazine and thought I&#x27;d give it a try--it was pretty low risk given the free shipping with Prime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a gem!  Does the job in just a few swipes.  For the first time I see what they mean about a how a eyelash curler can open your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mighty tool in a small size.</li>
    <li> I use this with clear eye mascara for a simple look on days a little more effort is needed -- looks like I&#x27;ve done nothing -- yet I look brighter-eyed (well, I think I do!). I think someone who wears dark mascara (it&#x27;s not my thing) would look incredible with this -- it really opens your eyes and it&#x27;s very simple to use. No directions reading necessary. I don&#x27;t read directions! I didn&#x27;t need to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To boot -- it uses a simple AAA battery you have at home and the first one comes right in the box so no running around your house.</li>
    <li> My lashes are not very long and a regular r eyelash curler does not work. This product does help my eyelashes curl as advertised. It is warm, not hot, and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Great to use if you&#x27;re in a hurry and need a quick touch-up on your lashes. Doesn&#x27;t curl my lashes quite as well as an actual lash curler, but definitely makes them stand out more. I gave four stars because it does seem to use a lot of battery power pretty quickly.</li>
    <li> Good value, no breakage.</li>
    <li> I love it!&lt;br /&gt;Works better if you use mascara first then the curler</li>
</ol>
