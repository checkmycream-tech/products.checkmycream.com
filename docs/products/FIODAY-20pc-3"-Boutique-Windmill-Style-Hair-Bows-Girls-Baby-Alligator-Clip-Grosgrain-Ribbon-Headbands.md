<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I looove the bows!!! They are very well made and look a lot more expensive than they are. Great price and good color selection. My daughter has a lot of hair and they work perfect for her. The only color the set is missing is orange (for fall, Halloween, Thanksgiving). I am very happy with my purchase :-).</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for. I love them. Other places sell these for 2.99 a clip, cant believe I got 20 for less then $10.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my 4 and 6yo! Clips are nice and tight. One has very fine hair .... and the other daughter has very thick hair and they both love them! So do i!</li>
    <li> There were only 18 bows. :(</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had these long, but so far, they are cute and seem well made.  They stay in my almost- 3 year old&#x27;s hair well and are the right size.</li>
    <li> These are perfect for my 18 month old. They are light weight and stay put, until she yanks them off at least. They are super cute and I now have one for almost every outfit! Price cannot be beat!</li>
    <li> The clips were too visible so we hardly used them. Other than that, they were the perfect size and stayed in great</li>
    <li> Quick delivery. Cute bows, just the right size for my toddler&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> I love barrettes and bought many at Amazon.  These bows are great and stay in my SHORT THIN hair. I do NOT wear ponytails nor do I use headbands.</li>
    <li> love these bows, awesome price for so many bows!  good quality</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly, great colors.&lt;br /&gt;Pretty small, but perfect for the side bang bow</li>
    <li> Love this set. This is better value for money than buying sets of 2 at retail outlets.</li>
    <li> Love them. Lots of colors! Just didnt like how it took 2 wks to come.</li>
    <li> Very useful! Holding up on my 2 year old very well! Colors are super vibrant and very pretty!!!</li>
    <li> I love these bows! They are the perfect size for what I needed. They are made well and I love all the colors. I would recommend these bows!</li>
    <li> A great purchase for a long haired baby! Good size, not overwhelmingly big. Stays put.</li>
    <li> Perfect for our little girls hair. They are very well made and has not fallen apart like most little bows. Best of all they do not pull her hair when I take them out.</li>
    <li> Love it!! I ordered it for my 2 month old baby and the size is perfect. Also it&#x27;s good quality and beautiful. Price is good.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re really 3&amp;#34;!! They look smaller than one would think, although they are still very cute and they come in a lot of colors. I literally have one to match every outfit I may wear, so I&#x27;ll give them that.&lt;br /&gt;I just wished they were bigger :(</li>
    <li> These bows are adorable and look so cute on my 4 year old. I love the size of them. They&#x27;re too big (where they awkward), but they hold hair back very well! It&#x27;s nice its a metal clasp, but its not alligator teeth so it pulls much less than other clips I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;m 100% happy (which doesn&#x27;t typically happen) so I thought I should review these! Great value, and adorable bows. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I just received these bows in the mail and I am in love!!! Perfect size and colors! Couldn&#x27;t be happier!!!</li>
    <li> Great deal for the amount of bows you get, some do come apart but I just hot glue them back on.</li>
    <li> My daughters hair looks so cute now, we use these anytime we go somewhere and she looks adorable. I plan to buy more if I lose them.</li>
    <li> Received this item yesterday. Great timing considering it came from China! I thought they would be cheaply made because of the price but were EXCELLENTLY made! They lay flat on my daughters 7 month head! The color selection was also great! A bow for every outfit! Definitely a must buy!!</li>
    <li> These are not alligator clips.</li>
    <li> Awesome product, great price.</li>
    <li> Love love love them, they are not too big not too small just the perfect size for my toddler and infant to wear on their hair and they can go with any color outfit and thats what i love most ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely recommend!!</li>
    <li> Perfect gift for LO&#x27;s..my niece looks great in them! The size is just right for her head and the colors are vibrant.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, don&#x27;t pull out her hair, stay in well! She only has a few inches so we use these to keep her bangs back while it grows in. Great!</li>
    <li> They just arrived,  i am very,very pleased. So pleased i went to the site and bought another set.my 1yr old has a head of hair right now just swooping to one side but eventually will need a pair for ponytails and they were kind enough to give a 10%off code on your next entire order through their site.Hands down my best purchase on Amazon this year.</li>
    <li> Shipping was super fast, got them in a week! Would&#x27;ve gotten 5 stars but some of the colors are not the shades they should be.</li>
    <li> These bows came exactly as advertised - the number and colors were all accurate.  They&#x27;re not too big like some bows, so look great on my 7 mo old daughter&#x27;s hair.  They do ship from China, so it took an extra week.  Also, the box is very small (no fancy packaging), but the bows were not bent or damaged in any way.  I would order from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Beautiful addition to hairstyle.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality.  Very happy with these bows.</li>
    <li> Great for everyday wear.</li>
    <li> Nice bows, but came from China so got charged a small international shipping fee on my credit card.  Credit card company rules, but still had not paid attn or was clear on it.  It was a small fee and I like the bows.</li>
    <li> It was perfect. The product was exactly how I was waiting and arrived on time!</li>
    <li> Shipping was SLOW but these are a cute size for my 20 month old.  I wish they came in a variety of sizes.  I purchased 2 sets as my daughter wears her hair in 2 ponytails often.</li>
    <li> LOVE these! Perfect for my one year old daughter! They stay in place nicely and are the perfect size. I would absolutely buy them again and probably will as we lose them and she gets bigger!</li>
    <li> Really cute and a descent price. I love all of the colors provided as my daughter can wear a couple with any color of outfit that she has</li>
    <li> great price for cute bows.  look great on my 10 month old...perfect size</li>
    <li> Came three weeks earlier than expected! Very happy. Cute little bows and a great variety of colors. I&#x27;m 16 and I&#x27;m going to wear these myself (-:</li>
    <li> Perfect for my 18 month old. Great size. Arrived in good condition. On time. Good colors.</li>
    <li> Love them perfect size for my 9 month old!</li>
    <li> These are perfect but you will need two bags cause its only one of each color but over all I really like them</li>
    <li> Too a little longer on shipping but great bows!!</li>
    <li> These bows clip nicely in the hair, and the package comes with all sorts of colors to go with any school colors or outfit. Plus it came in the mail in a timely fashion. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐</li>
    <li> Maybe 3&amp;#34; is a bit of a stretch but, for my 8 year old, they&#x27;re perfectly sized.</li>
    <li> I love love love their hair bows. The right size and all the right colors!!!</li>
    <li> I bought these in mind for my 3lb yorkie. Way too big and the clip will not hold.</li>
    <li> These clips grasp fine toddler hair, stay in place, great color selection.</li>
    <li> perfect little bows for my princess!!</li>
    <li> Bought these bows, but took the clips off to just use the bows with Girlie Glue.  My daughter has absolutely no hair so clips don&#x27;t work for her.  Girlie Glue is the way to go!</li>
    <li> They are a little small but other than that they are perfect and adorable!</li>
    <li> Worth the wait.  All the bows arrived in great condition and the colors shown appear to be accurate.  They stay in my child&#x27;s hair very well.  They are smaller and more proportional to a baby or toddler size head.  We have used these for six months and have no complaints.</li>
    <li> These are adorable! My daughter has very fine hair and I needed something to keep it out of her eyes. They don&#x27;t slide down and grip tight making it harder for her to pull them out  like other clips we have tried. The colors match the picture and almost every outfit she has. I wish there was a coral one since it is so popular this summer! They shipped quickly and were in great condition (I.e. No bends in the ribbons).</li>
    <li> Nice quality and fast shipping M</li>
    <li> These are great bows, they come in assorted colors and stay in very nicely.</li>
    <li> The perfect size bow!!!  I love these and will buy another set for my little one and another for my niece!</li>
    <li> The metal clip is uncovered and gets caught in fine hair. Bummer.</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping. They are a lot cuter than I expected. Great price!!</li>
    <li> Very cute. Great for small babies. They are the perfect size for my 10 month old.</li>
    <li> Well made. Very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I love this beautiful bows very well made my baby looks so cut!!</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for... perdect size and beautiful bow... but unfortunately 5 of them aren&#x27;t glued properly... they&#x27;re not aligned with the clip or are almost falling off... I ended up ruining 2 when trying to fix but was able to fix the other 3. Love rhe bows but overpriced because of the damage.</li>
    <li> I just love them, My gran daughter looks so cute</li>
    <li> These were a gift for someone.  They were super cute and very nice!!  Will likely purchase again!!  Arrived on time!</li>
    <li> Great purchase. Plenty of variety as far as colors and they&#x27;re well made. Plus I would say these are a little harder to lose since they&#x27;re bigger than the tiny plastic barrettes my daughter used to wear.</li>
    <li> My girls absolutely love these bows!</li>
