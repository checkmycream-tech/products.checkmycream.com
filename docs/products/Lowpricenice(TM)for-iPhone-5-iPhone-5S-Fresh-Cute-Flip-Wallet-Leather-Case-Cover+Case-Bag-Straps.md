    <li> so cute protective chain broke on first day but fixable</li>
    <li> This is a really cute wallet/iPhone case. On delivery I saw that the &#x27;lace&#x27; is not a piece of material as I thought when I ordered it. It&#x27;s like a tattoo. Still cute though. It fits my 5s perfectly. I had to finagle the hook eye to get the chain strap on. I was worried about that at first but since it&#x27;s tight, it actually feels more secure when you wear the wallet cross-body style or on the shoulder. TIP: squeeze the corner inward to position the clasp so that it closes securely.</li>
    <li> UGLY, UGLY, UGLY.  Looks absolutely nothing like the picture.  I opened the package, and threw it in the trash.</li>
