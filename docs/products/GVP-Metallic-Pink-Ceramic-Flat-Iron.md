      <li>sure it wasn&#x27;t my hair.</li>
      <li>Awesome flat iron!</li>
      <li>Let me Just Tell you, BEST FLAT IRON EVER!....</li>
      <li>The color is super cute too!</li>
      <li>I quickly fell in love!</li>
      <li>My hair was straightened in under half-an-hour, which is unheard of for me, and was strong, silky, and shiny.</li>
      <li>About how Beautiful It is, Especially After all The Damage Ive Done.....</li>
      <li>Plus it is light weighted,that my hand didn&#x27;t hurt after a finish doing my hair, compared to my HERSTYLER iron, my mom bought me and got ripped off.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s incredibly light and compact.</li>
      <li>Just as good as my old faithful.  </li>
      <li>Let my hair very smooth ;)</li>
      <li>but she was so right!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many straighteners and none have worked as fast or as well as this one.</li>
      <li>This straightener lasts longer and works better than higher the higher priced ones.  </li>
      <li>I bought a Chi Velocity thinking that Chi would be the best, but was really disappointed with it (not any better than my cheap Revlon model).  </li>
      <li>and Right</li>
      <li>The cord is really long which is nice.</li>
      <li>It gets hot quickly and smoothes hair out fast.</li>
      <li>Expensive but perfect.</li>
      <li>I was so sad when I SAW My Best Friend Die.....</li>
      <li>It works much better than the last chi I got.</li>
      <li>It heats up quickly, gets hot enough to really smooth my hair to a shine, glides smootly over my hair, and doesn&#x27;t snag.  </li>
      <li>Love this flat iron</li>
      <li>I love this flat iron!</li>
      <li>, it gets hot and ready to use in a matter of seconds and</li>
      <li>I absolutely despise this color</li>
      <li>This flatiron makes my hair straight.</li>
      <li>Recommend it to anyone who want straight shinny looking hair.</li>
      <li>My mom uses mines so much to the point where she&#x27;s not allowed to anymore.</li>
      <li>I have somewhat straight hair but</li>
      <li>I immediately ordered this one (being a breast cancer survivor, I love the pink!).  </li>
      <li>I Bought The Original GVP Back</li>
      <li>I was originally going to go with the Solia flat iron.</li>
      <li>When I Was In High School, I Paid Almost $90.00 for it....</li>
      <li>It gets really hot, too, which is great for my crazy hair.</li>
      <li>Totally worth the extra money to get this rather than a cheaper one by Revlon or something.</li>
      <li>I have owned about 20+ flat irons since 2003 and have to say that I&#x27;ve used better than this GVP flat iron.</li>
      <li>In my humble opinion, it&#x27;s even better.  </li>
      <li>So I went out today and bought myself a nice little FHI flat iron.</li>
      <li>The exact same thing happened to her.</li>
      <li>At first just the straightener smelled, then all of a sudden the smell transferred to my hair!</li>
      <li>I bought the green version of this flat iron back in 2008, when a sales person told me it was as good as a CHI.</li>
      <li>You could clearly tell it was coming from my hair</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in the process of going natural.</li>
      <li>My hair is naturally curly.</li>
      <li>After I straighten my hair it feels soft and silky</li>
      <li>this flat iron didn&#x27;t make my hair near as straight as my CHI.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this flat iron!</li>
      <li>This future hairdresser already knows quality and this was her request for a flat iron, over a year now and no problems and believe me she keeps it busy.</li>
      <li>After almost 6 years of straightening my extremely thick, super curly hair, it died.</li>

    <li> I Bought The Original GVP Back When I Was In High School, I Paid Almost $90.00 for it.... Let me Just Tell you, BEST FLAT IRON EVER!.... After 8 wonderful Years.... It Died..... I was so sad when I SAW My Best Friend Die..... So I Bought This One to Replace it and I Will NEVER Go Back to Any Other Flat Iron..... I LIVE off my Flat Iron, I have very thick curly hair and I am contastly Bleaching it so The Combination Makes me Look Like Wierd Al Yankovic or as One Of My Wonderful Friends Say A Poodle.... No Kidding..... The Price is Great and The Product Itself Makes It Wonderful!!! Im Absolutely In Love with It! My Hair is Over my Shoulders in Length When Not Straighten and it only Takes me About 30-45 min.... After its Done.... Im A Sexy Momma!!  Its So Bright, Shiny Silky Smooth, I Get Compliments Left and Right About how Beautiful It is, Especially After all The Damage Ive Done..... Well, If Your Debating it, BUY IT, You&#x27;ll Be Glad You Did!! :)</li>
    <li> I bought a Chi Velocity thinking that Chi would be the best, but was really disappointed with it (not any better than my cheap Revlon model).  I returned the Chi and exchanged it for the lavendar GVP flat iron. I love the GVP!!!  It heats up quickly, gets hot enough to really smooth my hair to a shine, glides smootly over my hair, and doesn&#x27;t snag.  It also has a long swivel cord, which helps keep me away from my husband&#x27;s side of the coutner.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron! I did lots of research before investing into this flat iron. I was originally going to go with the Solia flat iron. But when I found excellent reviews for GVP and how it was compared with CHI, I went with this one. I purchased it from Sally Beauty Salon, thinking I would try it out and will returning it is quicker if need be. But this one is a keeper for sure!! I have extremely curly,frizzy hair and I was done straightining my long hair in 15 mins with lots of Shine.&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY Recommend it to anyone who want straight shinny looking hair.</li>
    <li> This is my second GVP product.  About 10 years ago, I told my husband I wanted a Chi for Christmas.  I was quite disappointed when I opened the package and it was not the Chi but a &amp;#34;Generic Value Product&amp;#34;.  The girl at the store told him it was just as good as a Chi.  I didn&#x27;t know it at the time but she was so right!  In my humble opinion, it&#x27;s even better.  He felt bad so he got me a Chi also. I liked the GVP MUCH better.  In fact, I ended up giving the Chi away.  After 10 years of loving my GVP, it was damaged in my luggage beyond repair (my bad packing).  I immediately ordered this one (being a breast cancer survivor, I love the pink!).  I am so happy with it.  Just as good as my old faithful.  You cannot go wrong with this one.</li>
    <li> I have owned about 20+ flat irons since 2003 and have to say that I&#x27;ve used better than this GVP flat iron. When I purchased this at Sally Beauty, the employee told me that she had one and that it was comparable to a CHI for 1/3 of the price. When I took it home and used it, I wasn&#x27;t THAT impressed. I have thinner, straighter hair as it is and this flat iron didn&#x27;t make my hair near as straight as my CHI. However, for the price, it isn&#x27;t bad. It heats up nicely and is thin and small enough for travel. It just fails at getting hair extremely straight. So I went out today and bought myself a nice little FHI flat iron. Expensive but perfect.</li>
    <li> I bought this iron just for its color, and when I used it I love it. It doesn&#x27;t pull your hair, well in my experience, and I have long thick hair. Plus it is light weighted,that my hand didn&#x27;t hurt after a finish doing my hair, compared to my HERSTYLER iron, my mom bought me and got ripped off. She paid $100.&lt;br /&gt;MY GVP lasted for 5 years, i bought it back in 2006, and it could of still be working if it wasn&#x27;t for an electric problem caused at my house.</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron I still have it and it still works well and it has been 2-3 years since I bought it.</li>
    <li> This future hairdresser already knows quality and this was her request for a flat iron, over a year now and no problems and believe me she keeps it busy.</li>
    <li> This straightener lasts longer and works better than higher the higher priced ones.  It is by far the best one I have bought.</li>
    <li> I got this flat iron because the girl that use to do my hair, uses this same brand flat iron, except its black. I&#x27;m in the process of going natural. My hair is naturally curly. This flatiron makes my hair straight. After I straighten my hair it feels soft and silky, it gets hot and ready to use in a matter of seconds and the fact that it&#x27;s pink, is a bonus to me. I recommend this flat iron to everyone. My mom uses mines so much to the point where she&#x27;s not allowed to anymore. So I&#x27;m ordering one for her and my grandmother today (:</li>
    <li> I have never had a problem until 3 weeks ago. Suddenly my iron started turning brown and had this horrible smell to it. At first just the straightener smelled, then all of a sudden the smell transferred to my hair! I use Tresemme heat protecting spray every time i apply heat to my hair. It took a week to finally get the smell out of my hair. People had been complaint all week about my discussing smell./ You could smell it from just a foot away. You could clearly tell it was coming from my hair and i washed it everyday, two times a day. I even had my friend try it to mke sure it wasn&#x27;t my hair. The exact same thing happened to her. Ive only had it for a year and a half. Im EXTREMELY disappointed!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought the green version of this flat iron back in 2008, when a sales person told me it was as good as a CHI. After almost 6 years of straightening my extremely thick, super curly hair, it died. I didn&#x27;t even think twice, I bought this one! It is amazing and I&#x27;ll never buy another brand. It works better than my sister&#x27;s CHI and it lasts longer too. I highly recommend this flat iron!</li>
    <li> Excellent !!! Let my hair very smooth ;)</li>
    <li> Awesome flat iron! Just bought it from Sally&#x27;s beauty,  they have it on sale. Does not pull your hair off,  heats up immediately, makes cute curls.  I have somewhat straight hair but very coarse so it&#x27;s usually hard to make it straight after a ponytail for an example.  GVP does a great job! Love it. And the color is way too cute!!!!</li>
    <li> Use it all the time, easy and works great.</li>
    <li> I have incredibly thick, frizzy, wavy hair. I&#x27;ve tried so many straighteners and none have worked as fast or as well as this one. I absolutely despise this color and I still use it, that&#x27;s how good it is! My hair was straightened in under half-an-hour, which is unheard of for me, and was strong, silky, and shiny. It heats up really quickly and does the job perfectly. It gets really hot, too, which is great for my crazy hair. It&#x27;s incredibly light and compact. You can easily shove this bad boy in a travel bag. The cord rotates, too! Overall, VERY HAPPY with this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this iron for 6 years and it is still working! Excellent product!</li>
    <li> My roommate had this straightener and let me borrow hers when mine broke. I quickly fell in love! Totally worth the extra money to get this rather than a cheaper one by Revlon or something. The color is super cute too! The cord is really long which is nice. It gets hot quickly and smoothes hair out fast. I&#x27;ve had mine for about 3 years now, would buy again! :)</li>
    <li> Loved the product. It works much better than the last chi I got. Very impressed with quality of product.</li>
