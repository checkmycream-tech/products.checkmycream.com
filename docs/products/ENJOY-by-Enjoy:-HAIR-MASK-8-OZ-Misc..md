      <li>It is full and healthy.</li>
      <li>(I have fine hair, so this is a feat).</li>
      <li>The best is you use so little of this product</li>
      <li>For those who use cheap brands try this out.</li>
      <li>Fantastic conditioner.</li>
      <li>I should note I use Enjoy hydrating Shampoo/Conditioner.  </li>
      <li>When I moved to Florida, one of my biggest disappointments was no one carried the Enjoy Mask.  </li>
      <li>Well, I went out and bought the Hair mask to  see if it would help  to smooth frizz and hydrate the hair.  </li>
      <li>I use this ENJOY HAIR MASK with the ENJOY RECONSTRUCTING SPRAY for my color treated hair.</li>
      <li>THE HAIR MASK MAKES YOUR HAIR SILKY AND SMOOTH.</li>
      <li>So this Sunday (2 weeks after the original color), I went out and bought the Enjoy Hair Mask and the Intensive Repair Spray.  </li>
      <li>(But back to it&#x27;s normal straightness, which is great!)</li>
      <li>It is worth the money to repair brittle/dry hair!</li>
      <li>but I love it so much.</li>
      <li>It is so gentle and sulfate free.  </li>
      <li>the back of the bottle it states for a more intensive treatment use with the Enjoy Intensive Reconstructing Treatment and apply heat.</li>
      <li>&quot; done because looking like a poodle is not my idea of fun.  </li>
      <li>My hair and the extension are soft, smooth, and frizz free.  </li>
      <li>This works really well for damaged hair, the whole enjoy line works well.</li>
      <li>I swap out shampoos, but use this consistently.  </li>
      <li>My hairdresser first used it on my hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure you could accomplish something similar with a blowdryer, as well.</li>
      <li>OK, so first let me give you a brief synopsis of what I have done to my hair.  </li>
      <li>and I used this exact product when I lived at her house</li>
      <li>Not only looks healthy but it became healthy after using this product daily for a couple of weeks and</li>
      <li>When I did the first perm, I did the hair strand test:  </li>
      <li>You have to be sure to really rinse it out, otherwise your hair will be left greasy.</li>
      <li>The shipper packed the item very well and shipped it fast !</li>
      <li>She said she only uses Enjoy.  </li>
      <li>Enjoy hair mask gave me back the silky hair I was born with!</li>
      <li>Got here fast.</li>
      <li>Now I use this product 2ice a week and my hair feels sooo much healthier .</li>
      <li>My hair stylist finally talked me into trying the Enjoy hair mask and recommended I leave it on overnight.</li>
      <li>I probably would have bought both and used this method because my hair needs intense hydration.</li>
      <li>She is really into her hair and has been buying this stuff for years.</li>
      <li>I have normal hair and my husband has dry hair, we both use and love it.  </li>
      <li>I feel like, for the same price, I could find a much better deep conditioner.</li>
      <li>I would recommend highly to anybody.  </li>
      <li>Leaves ir soft and shiney</li>
      <li>It was so soft and shiny</li>
      <li>I always had healthy hair until my late teens when I discovered perms, then eventually as trends changed, highlighting treatments and the flat-iron.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried multiple products over the years and nothing felt like it really moisturizers my hair.</li>
      <li>then the other ENJOY Hair Care HAIR MASK that I purchase because the bottle looks different and my girlfriend is a beautician</li>
      <li>I tried multiple deep conditioners and hot oil treatments, but nothing would change the texture of my straw-like hair.</li>
      <li>If I run out of mask for more than a week, my hair is noticeably less manageable and starts to feel rough.</li>
      <li>A little pricey, but well worth the money.</li>
      <li>This product isn&#x27;t cheap, but a little goes a long way</li>
      <li>cuz it looks so much smoother and straight than my usual.</li>
      <li>You can buy an all natural alternative for the same price.</li>
      <li>Paid more for the same product I usually get for less money.</li>

<li> While this does make my hair soft, it&#x27;s certainly no miracle cure.</li>
<li> My hair feels very soft and moisturized after use,and not weighed down</li>
<li> I put it on the ends only - want to keep my hair from being flat!  </li>
<li> It goes a long way and will last for 6 months or so.  </li>
<li> it will last a long time.  </li>
<li> I use it 2-3 times a month so the 8oz.&#x27;s will last for a long time.</li>
<li> 5 minutes after applying, rinse, blow dry on low heat.  </li>
<li> My hairdresser turned me on to it about 6 years ago and she still uses it on her clients as well as I have been using that long.  </li>
<li> Absolutely regenerates and rejuvenates my tired locks after I&#x27;ve abused and mistreated them with the curling iron, flat iron, blow - dryer and about a million different products!</li>
<li> However, with each treatment (twice a week initially), my hair got less brittle.</li>
<li> I have very dry processed hair.</li>
<li> On the first treatment, my hair felt a bit softer, but nothing dramatic.</li>
<li> Carefully read the ingredients before you buy this.</li>
<li> If it sinks, it is damaged and porous.  </li>
<li> Just changed my hair color and few months ago from dark to blonde.</li>
<li> Let&#x27;s just saying I bleach it, use a straightening iron and all kinds of other tools.</li>
<li> You need to use a very minimal amount each time.</li>
<li> Hydrates dry brittle hair, gives body to hair and is never too heavy.  </li>
<li> It has parabens in it and tons of other ingredients I wouldn&#x27;t want on my skin!</li>
<li> No more frizz, even after a blow dry (no brush).  </li>
<li> Wish it was a little cheaper</li>
<li> Now, it is a little pricey, but if you don&#x27;t mind spending the money than go and buy this product.  </li>
<li> and I leave a little of it in after the shower it adds moisture to my hair.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Definitely recommend this hair \\&quot;mask.\\&quot; My hair feels very soft and moisturized after use,and not weighed down (I have fine hair, so this is a feat).</li>
    <li> the best product for hair that is dry and has tangles, makes hair smooth and healthy looking</li>
    <li> Great product for conditioning hait that is damaged from straighting or coloring.  Leaves ir soft and shiney</li>
    <li> ENJOY IS THE BEST PRODUCT FOR YOUR HAIR! THE HAIR MASK MAKES YOUR HAIR SILKY AND SMOOTH. THE BEST PRODUCT YOU&#x27;LL USE ON YOUR HAIR!!!</li>
    <li> Just changed my hair color and few months ago from dark to blonde. Bleaching drys out your hair.  My hair stylist recommended this product line to me.  I bought this product-Intensive Reconstructive Spray, plus the Clarifying Spray and the Hair Mask. OMG - my hair never looked or felt so good. It is full and healthy. I get complements on my hair all the time now. I just did a news interview yesterday and they are now calling me the girl with the hair!  Lol!  The best is you use so little of this product it will last a long time.  I spray on the Clarifying spray with my shampoo.  It takes out all the junk you have put on your hair, mousse, etc.  After rinsing, I mix a small amount of the Hair Mask with the Intensive Reconstructing Spray.  I put it on the ends only - want to keep my hair from being flat!  Use any cream rinse that you like.</li>
    <li> Let me start out by saying that I have human hair extensions.  I only have had them for over a month and I called my hair dresser for advice on what products I should use.  She said she only uses Enjoy.  Well, I went out and bought the Hair mask to  see if it would help  to smooth frizz and hydrate the hair.  Wow it is the best.  I washed my hair and put the conditioner on and left it on for and hour.  My hair and the extension are soft, smooth, and frizz free.  I definitely recommend this product for those who have dry/frizzy hair and also for those who have hair extensions.  I can&#x27;t wait to call my hair dresser and thank her for the advice.  I also bought the shampoo, and regular conditioner.  It is so gentle and sulfate free.  What more can you ask for?  Now, it is a little pricey, but if you don&#x27;t mind spending the money than go and buy this product.  This comment was written on 1/18/11.</li>
    <li> I use this ENJOY HAIR MASK with the ENJOY RECONSTRUCTING SPRAY for my color treated hair. I love the smell and the end result.  My hairstylist said not to use the product everyday. I use it 2-3 times a month so the 8oz.&#x27;s will last for a long time. It is worth the money to repair brittle/dry hair!</li>
    <li> I love this hair mask. My hairdresser first used it on my hair. It was so soft and shiny I had to buy some!</li>
    <li> Enjoy hair mask gave me back the silky hair I was born with! I always had healthy hair until my late teens when I discovered perms, then eventually as trends changed, highlighting treatments and the flat-iron. I tried multiple deep conditioners and hot oil treatments, but nothing would change the texture of my straw-like hair. My kids even said my hair felt \\&quot;fake\\&quot;. My hair stylist finally talked me into trying the Enjoy hair mask and recommended I leave it on overnight. On the first treatment, my hair felt a bit softer, but nothing dramatic. However, with each treatment (twice a week initially), my hair got less brittle. I had to use the mask twice a week for about 6 months before I noticed a discernable difference, and now use it once a week for maintenance. I have an old-fashioned hair dryer and I apply the mask to my damp hair, wrap a grocery bag around my head &amp; clip it in place, then sit under the dryer for 20 minutes to help the mask penetrate my hair. I&#x27;m sure you could accomplish something similar with a blowdryer, as well. If I run out of mask for more than a week, my hair is noticeably less manageable and starts to feel rough. This product isn&#x27;t cheap, but a little goes a long way and it&#x27;s the only thing that worked for me.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and I leave a little of it in after the shower it adds moisture to my hair.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this hair mask.  Hydrates dry brittle hair, gives body to hair and is never too heavy.  I have normal hair and my husband has dry hair, we both use and love it.  My hairdresser turned me on to it about 6 years ago and she still uses it on her clients as well as I have been using that long.  Great product.</li>
    <li> OK, so first let me give you a brief synopsis of what I have done to my hair.  Sunday -- Die hair out of box.  Next Sunday -- decide to perm hair.  YIKES!  Wednesday -- go back and have a \\&quot;Reverse perm\\&quot; done because looking like a poodle is not my idea of fun.  End result?  Hair that is totally fritzed, fried, and frizzy!! (But back to it&#x27;s normal straightness, which is great!) So this Sunday (2 weeks after the original color), I went out and bought the Enjoy Hair Mask and the Intensive Repair Spray.  I should note I use Enjoy hydrating Shampoo/Conditioner.  5 minutes after applying, rinse, blow dry on low heat.  My hair is now healthier-looking than before the color even!  Silky, shiny, and feels strong.  When I did the first perm, I did the hair strand test:  Put a strand of hair into a glass of water, &amp; if it floats, the cuticle is healthy (sealed).  If it sinks, it is damaged and porous.  Well it sank like a rock, but after this treatment, it floated.  This stuff smells great, works great, and is easy to use.  I would recommend highly to anybody.  No more frizz, even after a blow dry (no brush).  I am a fan.  I think I will do this once a month, just to maintain.  This stuff rocks!</li>
    <li> Fantastic conditioner. Leaves my hair softer than any othe rproduct I have ever used! I will continue to order it.</li>
    <li> Carefully read the ingredients before you buy this. It has parabens in it and tons of other ingredients I wouldn&#x27;t want on my skin! You can buy an all natural alternative for the same price.</li>
    <li> This works really well for damaged hair, the whole enjoy line works well. The shipper packed the item very well and shipped it fast !</li>
    <li> To be honest, I was looking for a miracle cure for split-ends, and dry/ damaged hair. While this does make my hair soft, it&#x27;s certainly no miracle cure. You have to be sure to really rinse it out, otherwise your hair will be left greasy. Not sure if I&#x27;ll purchase this again - I feel like, for the same price, I could find a much better deep conditioner.</li>
    <li> I love the enjoy hair mask. It&#x27;s my favorite product from enjoy. A little pricey, but well worth the money.</li>
    <li> This stuff turns my wife&#x27;s hair into chinchilla fur. She loves it and treats her self to a mask every now and then. She is really into her hair and has been buying this stuff for years. Take it from a guy, ladies...This stuff is great!</li>
    <li> My hair was FRIED and the Hair Mask has brought it back to wonderful, smooth, silky and healthy looking hair...  Not only looks healthy but it became healthy after using this product daily for a couple of weeks and a couple of longer 20min leave in sessions during that same time.</li>
    <li> I love enjoy. Got here fast. Would buy again whenever possible. Wish it was a little cheaper but I love it so much.</li>
    <li> I ordered this to see if it was any different then the other ENJOY Hair Care HAIR MASK that I purchase because the bottle looks different and my girlfriend is a beautician and I used this exact product when I lived at her house and it came in the white and purple bottle. Paid more for the same product I usually get for less money.</li>
    <li> I bought this mask to use after bleaching my hair, which drastically dries my hair. I use once a week with great results. The ends feel a lot healthier, it adds shine and has a pleasing smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the back of the bottle it states for a more intensive treatment use with the Enjoy Intensive Reconstructing Treatment and apply heat. I probably would have bought both and used this method because my hair needs intense hydration.</li>
    <li> When I moved to Florida, one of my biggest disappointments was no one carried the Enjoy Mask.  I use it for my hair conditioner, and it&#x27;s really amazing.  I swap out shampoos, but use this consistently.  It&#x27;s an amazing product.  If you haven&#x27;t tried it, do!  It goes a long way and will last for 6 months or so.  I have shoulder length hair.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love it! Absolutely regenerates and rejuvenates my tired locks after I&#x27;ve abused and mistreated them with the curling iron, flat iron, blow - dryer and about a million different products! LOVE it, and you surely will to.</li>
    <li> For those who use cheap brands try this out. You need to use a very minimal amount each time. Leaves the hair softer and easier to manage. Wouldn&#x27;t switch to anything else. One tube lasts months,</li>
    <li> like it a lot.everytime i use it my daughter would ask me whether i just went to the hair salon.she would ask me what i did with my hair cuz it looks so much smoother and straight than my usual.</li>
    <li> I have very dry processed hair. Let&#x27;s just saying I bleach it, use a straightening iron and all kinds of other tools. I&#x27;ve tried multiple products over the years and nothing felt like it really moisturizers my hair. Now I use this product 2ice a week and my hair feels sooo much healthier . I love it!</li>
