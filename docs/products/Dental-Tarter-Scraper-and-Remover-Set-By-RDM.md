<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very high quality set!</li>
    <li> good quality, product arrived very quickly, boxed nicely, and they work nicely for removing tartar-</li>
    <li> Pretty good quality.  Much better than the cheap plastic ones.</li>
    <li> Well made, and does the job it&#x27;s designed to do. What&#x27;s not to like?</li>
    <li> nice set for a nice price</li>
    <li> I got this to clean my dog&#x27;s teeth.  Specifically, one of the tools has a hard edge that scrapes that tartar right off of the tooth, no problem.  Its built thick enough to manage those thick deposits that dogs get without breaking (I broke a nicer one meant for humans a while back).  This little set saved me about $150 bucks in veterinary dental care, so 5 stars!</li>
    <li> Well made and very effective. I had build up needing attention and my teeth immediately looked like I went to the dentist after just a half hour of using these tools. Super pleased and will continue use periodically to hit trouble spots that floss cannot handle.</li>
    <li> Nice, 3-instrument set. Sturdy and effective. I&#x27;m glad I bought them.</li>
    <li> I get a lot of tartar buildup on just a couple of my teeth, and this is the only way I&#x27;ve been able to keep it under control without frequent dentist visits. These tools are solid and easy to use - I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Love this set worth every penny!</li>
    <li> These work great between visits to dentist to prevent tartar buildup.  Good quality metal instruments exceeded expectations, especially at the low cost.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for and for my application they are fine. These are not premium quality dental picks but for the money they&#x27;re good enough.</li>
    <li> I was totally surprised at the quality of these tools for the money. Short of opening your own dental studio, they are great for keeping your teeth in shape for minor little picks and hard to brush areas.</li>
    <li> This is a great set to have to clean your teeth...I like trying to keep my teeth clean between dental visits...I only wish it came with a DVD too.</li>
    <li> I was not too excited about going to the dentist, I felt like he was always looking for something to fix in the most expensive way possible.  So I skipped a year. The tech would do all the cleaning with these same tools.  It has been great to be able to use these to remove the build up myself instead of paying 5 times as much for someone else to do it.</li>
    <li> Save your $$$ on Dentist fees and get this!!! Seriously i just got this item wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work but within 10 minutes i was able to understand the method!</li>
    <li> I just used these instruments for the 1st time and I have to say that I really liked how I could see all this white stuff scrape off  my teeth. I also rinsed my teeth with warm sea salt water and my \\&quot;pearly whites\\&quot; feel really clean. I wanted to find a product that would assist me with staying proactive with my oral care.</li>
    <li> These work for me.  Great to scrape off tartar in hard to miss spots.</li>
    <li> These are very nice dental tools.  They are well made of quality materials and I am glad to be shed of my former plastic ones.</li>
    <li> Solid tools at a good price.  Scrapers have slight ridges to provide some abrasion to scrape of any build up.  The poker tools are sharp as they should be.  Would give a five but there are slight bends in tools, I mean slight.</li>
    <li> See my review for the Oral B toothbrush.  I got these after reading another review about DIY.  It&#x27;s actually a lot of fun.</li>
    <li> I bought these because I hadn&#x27;t been to the dentist in a couple years and peering into my mouth had become a morbid obsession.  I&#x27;m going to the dentist soon but these helped me get rid of a LOT of built up crap on my teeth.  Made me feel a little less anxious about going to the dentist.... maybe now they won&#x27;t run away in horror.  Just kidding... sort of. But these really are nice tools.  They worked quite well.</li>
    <li> If you like to keep your teeth clean this is an awesome kit to get. They seem to be just like the hygienists use and work great..</li>
    <li> I like these a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems very sturdy and strong like what the my dentist uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it about once every week to scrape off tartar that regular brushing won&#x27;t remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dentist is shocked that my teeth is so clean. :-)</li>
    <li> These stainless steel dental tools in their individual plastic sleeves seem to be of good quality.  They have textured handles for gripping.  This brand was not listed in professional dental tool suppliers I searched on the internet so I don&#x27;t know if the stainless is surgical steel quality but they look good and for the price are much better than the cheap plastic ones sold at drug stores.</li>
    <li> Good product, and my set has held up pretty well. My only suggestion would be that the grips could stand to be a little thicker for people with larger hands.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and in good order.  These are sharp instruments and work well.  Be careful with them.</li>
    <li> My only concern is messing up my fillings with these tools. Other than that this set is something that a dentist would use in his practice.</li>
    <li> Works and feel just like a dentists cleaning. I use it on a regular basis.  Does take a little time to learn how to use them but I&#x27;m getting there.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Very good feeling quality to this set. My mom purchased the Oral-B set that&#x27;s found at Wal-Mart/Target for 10 bucks and there&#x27;s quite a bit of plastic on those. for only a few bucks more, I received the same set (though with a few more options, admittedly!) but in a much higher quality in the form of surgical stainless steel. Outstanding product for the price and packaged in decent quality PVC sheaths.</li>
    <li> Works great. Well made.</li>
    <li> A must have. I love these tools.</li>
    <li> Great quality, fast delivery and an overall great product. Never have cleaned my teeth before but its a breeze and recommend that people don&#x27;t wait a year to get their teeth cleaned when they can do it at home. If your unsure...google a how to video.</li>
    <li> I wonder if this was intended for a lay man&#x27;s self cleaning, but I find these tools easy and useful. Likely, it&#x27;s best have a dentist clean your teeth. However, for strange birds like me, this product seems safe. I was worried at first because the tools are sharp, but I have not harmed myself... yet.</li>
    <li> My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t buy them years ago!&lt;br /&gt;The mirror won&#x27;t impress you, yet where it really matters I&#x27;m pleased to share that the quality of tools is top shelf in weight, feel, and finish. you will quickly remove any plaque, be careful as these tools are sharp! improve your smile, and health! Love it, Danny</li>
    <li> The tarter scrapers are nice and the mirror is helpful to see the back of your teeth. You might poke yourself in the gum the first few times but you get the hang of it quick and they become pretty handy to have for those hard to get areas. The material is sturdy and seems to be made well.</li>
    <li> Was pleased to find the set is professional quality. Very solid. Be careful when using, though. You can draw blood if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
    <li> i wasn&#x27;t sure about this purchase but it turns out they are great quality - just like the dentist has.</li>
    <li> I received my dental tarter and scraper set when promised and was completely satisfied with the quality the more than fair price I paid. I use it frequently to keep my teeth in good shape before and after dental visits. would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a set like this.</li>
    <li> Price matches product standard. Nothing professional but great for home use.</li>
    <li> I bought these because I like the feel of clean teeth.  I get cleanings from the dentist 4 times a year.  i clean the plaque off my teeth once a week.  Works great.  Great sanitized packaging.  fast ship</li>
    <li> Ever wish you could get your teeth professionally cleaned more than 1-2 times a year? Well, order these babies and you can do some (gentle) scaling on yourself to remove plaque build up! Good quality product.</li>
    <li> This is the best thing ever. I wish I would have ordered them a long long time ago. very very good quality, well packaged. Just be careful!</li>
    <li> This set is actually dentist quality.  I use it to keep tarter off my teeth between my twice yearly visits to the dentist for cleaning.  They do a great job!!!</li>
    <li> They seem to be very good.</li>
    <li> So glad I got these! I bought it to use on my dog&#x27;s teeth, her teeth got really gross over the years with tons of tartar build up on her back teeth. I only used the scaler, it worked great at removing all of the tartar leaving her teeth nice, smooth and white. I&#x27;m thinking about getting a separate set for myself. Only gave 4 stars because the mirror has a few brown spots around the edges under the glass.</li>
    <li> I Recommand this Dental Tarter Scraper for eveyone who want to check their teeth using the mirror or use scalers to clean Tartar of first1 stage it helps remove tartar parts when used with caution because they are sharp and can hurt your gum if not used properly. I removed most of tartar that i had in my front teeth before i even go to my dental scheduled appointment for Deep scaling and root planning ,though i still had to go because i had TARTAR OF 25 YEARS!! this product still help me check my teeth behind using mirrors and also scaler to reach some parts i can t floss and get that  tiny pieces of  food between gum line and tooth :) for best results use a TARTAR DISOLVER like Periogen Oral rinse with this amazing tools .</li>
    <li> This set does the trick.  Being careful is an imperative... but don&#x27;t tell your dentist that his/her $100 cleaning isn&#x27;t needed so often.</li>
    <li> These are amazing quality. I only really use one of the three tools but well worth the cost for the quality.</li>
    <li> Way better than dentek pos but tip broke off after 1 DAY. Just be careful because otherwise they are pretty decent.</li>
    <li> Well made, easy to use and clean and very affordable product.</li>
    <li> High quality for the price. I scale my dog&#x27;s teeth with them.</li>
    <li> Excellent product in between dental visits. Gets food particles removed with little effort.  Give it a try. Not very expensive.</li>
    <li> Seemed nice enough, but the tip of the scaler broke immediately with only minor pressure against a tooth..I&#x27;m lucky I didn&#x27;t swallow it. I wasn&#x27;t expecting dentist quality, but perhaps I should have spent a bit more on better quality.</li>
    <li> Not as sharp or durable as professional dental tools.  Will scrape teeth with some effort.  Low price.</li>
    <li> Was really pleased with this purchase. A real good deal for the money. I use this product every day. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> These are quality! Very sharp, be careful!</li>
    <li> Love this dental instruments very good price and a very durable! I&#x27;m an assistant and love to clean my teeth at home and they work amazing!</li>
    <li> Seems to be well made. For the price I can&#x27;t complain (much). They feel sturdy and don&#x27;t bend. Appear to be actual stainless steel so it doesn&#x27;t rust. I have no experience with dentist quality tools but years ago I purchased a set of plastic/rubber handle (like a toothbrush). They were really crappy quality. I kept it around for electronic cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The set does not include a front surface mirror but a conventional mirror so you&#x27;ll see a ghost(or an overlapping secondary image). Not horrible but a little annoying. The seller offered to fix the problem for me. Which I was very happy about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So a 4 star for the product but a 5 star for the seller and his enthusiasm to proactively fix any problems.</li>
    <li> The product is just as advertised my wife loves them they seem to be made well and come in a nice cardboard case.  I may want to get another set to clean the carbon off my guns... lol</li>
    <li> Solid, properly weighted, metal. Comes in a nice carrying case with foam inserts shaped for each tool. Points are sharp, but no real scraper edge. Not a &amp;#34;scaler&amp;#34;. Professional quality. Worth every penny</li>
    <li> I tend to make a lot of tartar on my teeth.  This is perfect for getting it off in-between dentists visits.</li>
    <li> High Quality stainless steel set. Very pleased. They are very sharp, very sturdy and very professional. Laser etched with part numbers. I plan on buying another.</li>
    <li> Great set of tools to scrape tartar and plaque especially in the hard to reach places. Even though I take good care of my teeth I have  noticed a few areas where plaque starts building up. especially near the first second and third molars. Flossing helps but was not effective. Im glad I found this set. I can target the specific spots keep it nice and clean. In spite of using this set, half yearly (at least) cleaning and examination by dental professionals is highly recommended.</li>
    <li> So far, so good.  It does get to be expensive going to the dentist every so often to get your teeth cleaned &amp; for whatever reason, my teeth build up a lot of tarter.  The dental tarter scraper &amp; remover do a good job &amp; have worked out just fine for my needs.  I use the instruments once every 2 weeks &amp; give them a thorough cleaning after every use &amp; I have had no problems.  A well crafted product.</li>
    <li> Very sturdy and strong picks and a good variety in case.  Great value for the price!!</li>
    <li> Works great, I have had these tools for a while now and they still work great and have no tarnished or dulled.</li>
    <li> Good set , giving you the feeling of clean mouth. Very good for between doctor app. The only thing is that it should come with a DVD or other information kit. But till then you can go to check online for video.</li>
    <li> Scrapers are so sharp, you can cut yourself with these - hopefully will stay like that. All of our family already cleaned the teeth, and they look and feel better than after hygienist appointment. Takes some skill, but after 15 min you are a pro. Cannot go wrong - we saved some $300 on dentist fees. Would definitely suggest to anyone.</li>
    <li> Very good quality just like the one at the dentist. It&#x27;s does the job pretty good.  It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted. Thanks</li>
    <li> These scrapers are 100 times better than the store bought, gonna by two more for gifts. It&#x27;s an investment for your health and appearance!</li>
    <li> The dental pick bent the first time i used it, dental scaler works okay. I dont use these anymore.&lt;br /&gt;If you are going to these tools to clean your teeth, I would recommend buying higher quality tools. Im very happy with my Osung tools which is surgical quality steel.</li>
    <li> Great check-up improvement with use</li>
    <li> Watch internet video on how to use these...Very sharp, easy does it, you will still have to see your dentist to obtain proper cleaning..</li>
    <li> works good for us! :)</li>
    <li> Seems to be the same quality as the tools at my dentist.  This set is sold on professional dental sites.  Works great.</li>
    <li> Makes routine cleaning at the dentist a breeze. The hygienist told me to continue to do whatever I had been doing. The tools are very sharp, so care must be used to not damage gums.</li>
    <li> Great price and value.</li>
    <li> Who needs a dentist when you have these suckers! Good value and super sharp. Have had for a few months and no sign of rust yet. Teeths are sparklin and clean.</li>
    <li> Great quality  They need to quit requiring me to write more words when two would have said it all.  Done</li>
    <li> Heavy duty and works great. Would buy them again and recommend to my friends.&lt;br /&gt;Comes in their own plastic cases, nice for travel.</li>
    <li> Excellent Quality, I Love These tools!</li>
    <li> I am using these for electronic PC boards.&lt;br /&gt;Great my for my electronic repairs.</li>
    <li> I only use one of the tools but it works on very stubborn stains and plaque that nothing else I ever tried would. The flat, hooked tool removes the tartar that even my hygienist gave up on. I have to scrape every week, but it&#x27;s so nice to be able to talk and smile without the embarrassment of dirty teeth. (I guess my tartar build up is genetic. :-( )</li>
    <li> Be careful very sharp.</li>
    <li> These tools are made of quality steel and are a bargain at this price. All I&#x27;d ask for is a durable carrying case.</li>
    <li> Excellent tools for the price.</li>
    <li> My fiancé is crazy about her teeth... and everyone else&#x27;s.  I purchased these shortly before Christmas, and they arrived faster than expected.  She uses them all the time on herself and me; not sure how long they&#x27;ll last, but for what I payed, they&#x27;re great.</li>
    <li> I was very worried about getting this item and the quality in this product, and I can honestly say that I was blown away and they work great at removing the plaque behind the teeth.  The quality is unreal, like real dentist scrapers, real stainless steel construction and all you need to do is keep them sanitized between cleanings, I just boil some water and soak them, dry with a clean cloth and store back with the package that they came in.  All in all a great buy for the money and what you get.</li>
    <li> I really like the product, this is exactly what i needed since I&#x27;m a Dental Assistant, I received it quicker than I thought</li>
    <li> Great product. Exactly the same thing used in dental offices. I can just clean my teeth at home and prevent gum disease from calculus build up.</li>
    <li> Great deal!  Works great.</li>
    <li> For those hard to reach spots.</li>
    <li> The Scraper is very sharp and works very well...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT it does not replace a Cleaning you get from your Dentist Office.  I get my teeth cleaned Professionally every 6 months.  AND I brush 2 times a day and use Floss daily.</li>
    <li> I am actually using these tools as part of a gun cleaning kit, regardless I am happy with the purchase and the quality seems to be north of good!  Would recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> Would make a good miniseries.</li>
    <li> I received this three piece dental tool kit with individual clear plastic sleeves quickly.  They are a good value.  I recommend them.</li>
    <li> These are great to keep your teeth plaque and tarter free between your dental visits. They are precision top quality instruments that you would find at your dental office. When flossing won&#x27;t remove the hardened tarter, these tools will do so effortlessly. They are very sharp so use care around the gum line. I also like the box to store them in.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was prompt and quality is 5 Stars. I would highly recommend to friends and family.</li>
    <li> Love this product even though I only use one of the three tools. I use the sharpest side to remove any tartar buildup.</li>
    <li> This is a good set. However it is still no easy to clean your own teeth. If you decide to clean your own teeth you will need some time to train yourself.</li>
    <li> Not what it was bragged up to be...</li>
    <li> It works really well.</li>
    <li> These tools are great and of wonderful quality.  Heavy duty!  Polished and buffed smoothly.</li>
    <li> A good tool to use in between dental visits.  Get use to using them and you shouldn&#x27;t have any issues.  Anything that you purchase is as good as you are taking of it.  If you don&#x27;t care of it, then what do you expect in how it turns out in the future.  This is a good product for home use.</li>
    <li> Good dental set.  I had some tartar I wanted to remove and didn&#x27;t want to schedule an entire appointment for it.  I do still go to the dentist and would not recommend using these a lot unless you know what you are doing but they are nice to have when you get something stuck.</li>
    <li> The Dental Tarter Scraper and remover set is fantastic.  It&#x27;s making a real difference for me.  Hopefully my dentist will agree.</li>
    <li> Great set of dental picks/scrapers/mirror. They are just like the ones the dentist uses and are sharp enough to handle the task of scraping the tartar off my teeth. Xlnt price too because I caught them on sale! Recommended source...</li>
    <li> Very cost effective, just a great bargain.&lt;br /&gt;I needed something to help keep my teeth clean without going to the dentist, works great and does what it should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all a great buy.</li>
    <li> Love them. Do what they&#x27;re supposed to!.. I just wish they came with a case. But other than that they are great.</li>
    <li> These are very effective and a great value for the price. I had to skip a dental appointment and couldn&#x27;t get another one right away--went for 8 months between cleanings, and the hygienist complimented me on my great oral care!</li>
    <li> I can get at the hard to reach places I could not get to before. It will take some getting used to to stop stabbing myself though.</li>
    <li> These are a great set of dental tools.  I use them to deep clean between my teeth when flossing isn&#x27;t enough.</li>
    <li> Tool is ok. If you were imagin you can do it yourself with this tool set, do not buy.</li>
    <li> the scrapers are have a professional  feel to them they have a nice weight to them and they do the work without cutting or hurting your gums so I am very please with my purchase and do recommend them to anyone</li>
    <li> The whole set is ok for my need. I expected somethings work better. I think the cost for the whole set is ok.</li>
    <li> These were a gift.  They are very good quality and do the job.</li>
    <li> Wish the mirror were first-surface as in older kits from other manufacturers...the layer of glass creates a ghost image.</li>
    <li> Good quality, beceryful very sharp</li>
    <li> this is the best, I also bought one for my son. I loved the price and the instruments are just like the Dr. uses to clean my teeth.</li>
    <li> Finally a brand that is high grade and does leave metal marks on your teeth and doesnt rust</li>
    <li> Nice quality, professional-length handles, great price - these stainless steel dental tools are well made.  For my needs there are enough tools and I easily reach every area of my teeth.  Use care as the picks are pointy!  Using them has made a considerable positive difference in my oral hygiene.  The only thing missing is a cute blonde hygienist to flirt with!</li>
    <li> we use this at the house often</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s in general good except that one tool the thin one if applied too syrongly can bend. Make sure you use the right one when cleaning tartar.</li>
    <li> watch you dont get it jammed between teeth it takes some removing using the long scraper when using as  a prod there is a  small bend at the end,  This is not a product problem! just be aware, this happened on the back teeth and took 5 plus minutes to remove.&lt;br /&gt;Overall a good product. Enjoy.</li>
    <li> Received product quickly. Was a little hesitant attempting to do &amp;#34;at home&amp;#34; dental stuff myself. The box looked cheap and the instruments were not sealed separately. I ended up boiling the instruments for a few minutes before using to sanitize the equipment before poking around in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few scrapes, I am happy to report that it works! I had this annoying stain between my teeth and it came off fairly easy. I went around the mouth at some other stubborn stains in my mouth that brushing, flossing, and mouthwashing won&#x27;t get rid of. Again, the instruments really did help!! The mirror does fog. The instruments are really fine and seem high quality. Hopefully the points wont&#x27; break off, but i don&#x27;t feel like they will...unless you really don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing. Slow and steady and try not to hit your gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you are in a well lit area and are close to the mirror!</li>
