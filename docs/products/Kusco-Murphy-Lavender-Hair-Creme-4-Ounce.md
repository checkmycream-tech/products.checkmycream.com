<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I am new to hair creams and jells. This one smell lovely and is not sticky or pasty. It was reccomended to me by a hair stylist, and every since I found it on the internet I have been buying it. This is not my first purchase.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Holds hair in place without making it look oily or greasy.  Nice scent, girls always comment the scent when using this product.</li>
    <li> I love using this product as it does not make my hair look shiny or wet.  It is a medium hold creme that holds all day and when slept on will still work the next day.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing for curly hair and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down a bit.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for the perfect hair product for about 15 years! I have wavy/curly hair, thick, unruly, somewhat frizzy hair. I have tried just about every gel, cream, mousse and serum on the market and none of them did what they said they&#x27;d do. When my hair dresser suggested I try the Lavender Hair Cream, I was skeptical, to say the least. But OMG! I put it in my hair, finger curled it, let it air dry and holy cow! Perfect curls, no frizz and soft not crunchy!!!! It&#x27;s the best hair I&#x27;ve ever had! Plus, it smells great! One of my guy friends said to me one day, \\&quot;you smell pretty\\&quot;. The only problem with this product is that once you start using it, nothing else will do.</li>
    <li> I have been using Kusco-Murphy for years. I have very dry hair and this product tames my frizz.  Here&#x27;s why I love it:&lt;br /&gt;It does smooth and eliminate frizz from dry hair&lt;br /&gt;It works on dry hair, not wet, so I can touch up as the day goes on&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling greasy like a lot of products you apply to dry hair&lt;br /&gt;It smells wonderful&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t have to get the big jar because it comes in an even more potable container to slip in your purse, a 1 ounce, I think&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like:&lt;br /&gt;Okay, price, but I say it is well worth it; I have never regretted buying it and you only have to use a little at a time, so it lasts&lt;br /&gt;You have to wash you hands after you use it, so I go to a nearby restroom to retouch</li>
    <li> Perfect!  Love the smell, great product.  Fast shipping.  Easy!</li>
    <li> If you have dry hair, this product is for you.  It is a little expensive, but you only have to use a very small amount, so a 4oz jar last about 6 months. By the way, my daughter recommend this product to me. She is a woman of color and before she found this product, nothing worked as well without spending quite a bit more cost.</li>
    <li> Great product for curly hair! Adds a little shine and hold, separates the curls nicely. Not too heavy, not too light, a great product for medium to fine curly hair!</li>
    <li> love this stuff.  keeps the frizz away</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way. Grreat stuff.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;m addicted to this product!</li>
    <li> This was all it claimed to be but have only used it once.  Smells lovely and doesn&#x27;t make your hair stiff.</li>
    <li> The best frizz control and curl enhancer I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Kusco Murphy Lavendar Creme for years.  I love this product and many of their other styling and cleansing products.  Always amazed how wonderfully they perform and work with my hair!</li>
    <li> My hair is fine wavy/curly this product acted more like a paste vs a cream. It is way too heavy for fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;I believe this  product would be good for coarse curly hair especially if you twist to style for a ropey look.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is divine.</li>
    <li> If you have curly hair and don&#x27;t want it to feel sticky or greasy this is the product for you!!! Beautiful soft curls that you can touch.. never thought it could happen, untill I tried this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recomended</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m finally breaking down and buying a jar of this.  My stylist gave me a sample a while back and I&#x27;ve found it&#x27;s great to smooth on mid-day when I decide to pull my hair back and out of my way. It keeps all the ends in without being stiff or sticky.</li>
    <li> Love this product and I don&#x27;t think they make it anymore.  It&#x27;s is not heavy or sticky, just does a nice job of texturizing.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s smells great and works great, i love it.  I don&#x27;t want to write a 14 words review on this hair product</li>
