      <li>I could hang from a hook, and this fit the bill.</li>

      <li>and it came so fast:)</li>
      <li>so it definitely feels good and cleans well.</li>
      <li>The bristles are too soft and long to do a very good job.</li>
      <li>Anything wooden is better than plastic!</li>
      <li>This is a very pretty and useful brush.  </li>
      <li>Well worth your gelt, friend.</li>
      <li>The head is big, there is a handy loop, and it&#x27;s compact</li>
      <li>Well made and just the right stiffness for the bristles to get under your nails as you want.  </li>
      <li>This Nail Brush is just how it looks ,it is very soft but cleans under the nails just fine ,i wanted a Brush that wouldn&#x27;t scratch so</li>
      <li>However, its main purpose is to clean under the nails.  </li>
      <li>I always clean my feet normally with a loofa</li>
      <li>Was exactly as described.  </li>
      <li>This nail brush is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>It arrived exactly on time.</li>
      <li>People interested in manicures should ignore this review.</li>
      <li>The tips of the bristles feel rounded, which is important as they don&#x27;t damage the sensitive skin underneath fingernails.  </li>
      <li>It is soft enough to use with comfort, has a great sting handle that lets it dry quickly, and I really like its eco origins.</li>
      <li>worth the very modest price.</li>
      <li>this is a nice little brush</li>
      <li>This feel very well made</li>
      <li>I really want to like this brush.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a 26 year old male that got a pedicure one time and never realized how much I enjoyed the brush.</li>
      <li>Soft bristles, but not so soft it doesn&#x27;t clean.</li>
      <li>This is one of three nail brushes I ordered from Amazon last week, and I am hoping the third will arrive soon and prove better than the first two...</li>
      <li>A lot of the cheapo brushes have very coarse bristles that clean</li>
      <li>soft, yet effective and firm enough to clean well.</li>
      <li>A lifetime in ORs solidified my love for such brushes.&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, the hospitals only use plastic disposable brushes now, but we still keep one of these at every sink and shower in both of our houses.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Small enough to fit comfortably in the palm of your hands.</li>
      <li>The bristles on the nail brush were so soft!</li>
      <li>My nails look completely different after my first use.</li>
      <li>but I did not appreciate at the time that I prefer a larger, longer nail brush given the large size of my hands.  </li>
      <li>Yes it is soft...</li>
      <li>Soft bristles.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re gentle enough that I can use this on both of my children without issues.</li>
      <li>The bristles are soft but not too soft.</li>
      <li>The bristles are soft but not too soft (not like a baby&#x27;s hair brush)</li>
      <li>Soft but sturdy.  </li>
      <li>but the bristles are a bit soft.</li>
      <li>Too soft for me.</li>
      <li>Soft and will get the job done.  </li>
      <li>The brush is soft but not too soft.</li>
      <li>little soap and a modicum of elbow grease, and your nails and hands are CLEAN.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well as the cheap plastic ones I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
      <li>But for adding a little extra cleaning to an ordinary hand-washing, it&#x27;s okay - a little better than soap and water alone, but not much.  </li>
      <li>The bristles of the brush are plastic and a little softer than expected but over all it&#x27;s not a bad brush.</li>
      <li>Like many other reviewers, I find the bristles on this brush much too soft for scrubbing dirty nails.  </li>

<li> I became addicted to natural fiber brushes the first time I scrubbed as a medical student 48 years ago.</li>
<li> and I have never had any problems with it, lasts a long time.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s compact, but the bristles are stiff, which makes cleaning under nails easier to do than with the clear plastic bristled ones.  </li>
<li> I expected stiffer bristles.</li>
<li> I&#x27;d found that the plastic nail brushes they sell in the drug stores have the bristles  secured with metal and when the brush gets wet, the metal rusts and stains the bristles...</li>
<li> This is NOT a good brush for cleaning your nails, as it is way too soft!</li>
<li> The only problem I&#x27;ve had with this product is the wood turns black after a few weeks.</li>
<li> It gets 4 stars only because it is a bit small.  </li>
<li> /&gt;This is less damning, but the brush is also a little small for fitting into your hand, making it a little hard to get a hard scrub.</li>
<li> It was hanging in my shower and the wood got nasty started cracking and molding pretty fast.</li>

    <li> gets the dirt out of kids nails! and hangs on the tub too.</li>
    <li> I expected stiffer bristles. Too soft for me.</li>
    <li> It arrived exactly on time. Was exactly as described.  Would order it again.</li>
    <li> The bristles of the brush are plastic and a little softer than expected but over all it&#x27;s not a bad brush.</li>
    <li> This is NOT a good brush for cleaning your nails, as it is way too soft! Also, if you leave it hanging in the shower, the wood gets nasty and cracks after awhile. There are much better and cheaper brushes out there.</li>
    <li> The brush is small which I knew as I checked out the dimensions.  The brushes are softer than I like.  This would work well for someone with very small hands.</li>
    <li> Like many other reviewers, I find the bristles on this brush much too soft for scrubbing dirty nails.  But for adding a little extra cleaning to an ordinary hand-washing, it&#x27;s okay - a little better than soap and water alone, but not much.  I leave my nail brush standing bristles-down on the rim of the sink, so I doubt I will have the same problems with the handle rotting as others have mentioned.  This is one of three nail brushes I ordered from Amazon last week, and I am hoping the third will arrive soon and prove better than the first two...</li>
    <li> This feel very well made and I hope it lasts a while. The bristles are softer than I am used to, but my nails still get clean!</li>
    <li> The brush is ideal for nails. Yes it is soft...and that&#x27;s what you want.&lt;br /&gt;If your nails are very dirty or whatever.&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s best then, to clean the nails with a manicure file or whatever....</li>
    <li> Soft and will get the job done.  Girls do not like men with dirty nails.  The bristles on the nail brush were so soft! and it came so fast:)</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a true ECO product, this might not be the choice for you as the bristles are made out of plastic, but it works wonderfully well and is perfect for what it&#x27;s meant for. Recommended.</li>
    <li> Favorite brush and it&#x27;s been over a year since I bought it. Still using it today.</li>
    <li> Hangs with my other Brushes !!!! Great Brush !!!</li>
    <li> There is nothing actually wrong with it but the bristles are a bit soft. It doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well as the cheap plastic ones I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
    <li> Just as described, a necessity for cleaning those out of the carden dirty hands...Bristles are the perfect coarseness, dries fast</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband.  I like that it&#x27;s Bamboo as that makes them eco friendly and I really love that.  Good price for the product.</li>
    <li> As pictured and so very nice.  I have abused it for at least a year by now and although it looks used it is still good-looking and still suffers daily use with grace.  Well worth your gelt, friend.</li>
    <li> This nail brush is exactly what I was looking for. I&#x27;m a 26 year old male that got a pedicure one time and never realized how much I enjoyed the brush. It cleans so well and gets into little crevices between your nail and skin. The bristles are soft but not too soft (not like a baby&#x27;s hair brush) so it definitely feels good and cleans well. My nails look completely different after my first use. I always clean my feet normally with a loofa but that doesn&#x27;t compare. I think this should be a must have for everyone.</li>
    <li> It is good while it lasted, which wasn&#x27;t more than a couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> Supper little brush. Great design and craftsmanship.&lt;br /&gt;Made solid and well. Easy to use and perfect size.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered more. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> It is soft enough to use with comfort, has a great sting handle that lets it dry quickly, and I really like its eco origins. I actually got two, one for the upstairs, one for downstairs so I always have one at hand.</li>
    <li> I became addicted to natural fiber brushes the first time I scrubbed as a medical student 48 years ago. A lifetime in ORs solidified my love for such brushes.&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, the hospitals only use plastic disposable brushes now, but we still keep one of these at every sink and shower in both of our houses.&lt;br /&gt;A little soap and a modicum of elbow grease, and your nails and hands are CLEAN. They do eventually wear out, but even the ones we have hanging in the showers, and use daily, last a couple of years.&lt;br /&gt;Well worth the very modest price.</li>
    <li> this is a nice little brush</li>
    <li> I enjoy this prouduct and use it as a body bush as well as for toes &amp; fingers. The only problem I&#x27;ve had with this product is the wood turns black after a few weeks. So I Have to get another one.</li>
    <li> Well made and just the right stiffness for the bristles to get under your nails as you want.  It gets 4 stars only because it is a bit small.  It is just as described but I did not appreciate at the time that I prefer a larger, longer nail brush given the large size of my hands.  Its size makes it a bit difficult to hold onto in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Dr. J.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Princeton, NJ</li>
    <li> People interested in manicures should ignore this review. I&#x27;m writing to rock climbers - this Earth-friendly company has unknowingly made a great boulder brush. The head is big, there is a handy loop, and it&#x27;s compact so it doesn&#x27;t get in the way. To get reach, I suppose you could lash it to a stick with some fishing line...</li>
    <li> This nail brush is made well and is easy to store in the shower/tub.  However, its main purpose is to clean under the nails.  The bristles are too soft and long to do a very good job. It works OK.</li>
    <li> Well made and good looking. Great value for the money. A very good nail brush promptly shipped and sanely packaged.</li>
    <li> Good product, Wish the bristles were a littel stiffer.</li>
    <li> I use it. Am satisfied. Only would like it in a &amp;#34;larger&amp;#34; size.</li>
    <li> Soft bristles. Just what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I like this nail brush, not sure why ecotools quite selling on their site as I would prefer not to use amazon. I wish the bristles were a little stiffer but this is my second brush and I have never had any problems with it, lasts a long time. I use for bottoms of feet and nails.</li>
    <li> Anything wooden is better than plastic! I love eco-friendly products, and this brush works well for under your fingernails and hands. Love it!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mother as part of her Christmas present and she thought it was very nice. Especially compared to some of the cheaper plastic ones.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d found that the plastic nail brushes they sell in the drug stores have the bristles  secured with metal and when the brush gets wet, the metal rusts and stains the bristles...ew. That doesn&#x27;t happen here. Just a nice clean brush.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase. The bristles are soft but not too soft. A lot of the cheapo brushes have very coarse bristles that clean well but don&#x27;t feel nice on the skin. Not the case here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted a brush that a) wasn&#x27;t plastic and b) I could hang from a hook, and this fit the bill. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Excellent Brush for the price. Small enough to fit comfortably in the palm of your hands.</li>
    <li> Soft bristles, but not so soft it doesn&#x27;t clean.</li>
    <li> The brush is soft but not too soft. I can imagine that people with very dirty nails will need a another brush.</li>
    <li> Great brush.  Soft but sturdy.  Makes brushing your nails clean a breeze.  The&lt;br /&gt;brush keeps it&#x27;s nice shape.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I really want to like this brush.  It&#x27;s well made, looks good, and I always appreciate an attempt to make a good Eco-friendly product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the bristles just don&#x27;t work for getting under nails.  I garden a lot, so I need something that can hold form while getting under my nails.  This brush just can&#x27;t do it.  The bristles bend and give.  The cheap plastic one it replaced still got under my nails after years of abuse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is less damning, but the brush is also a little small for fitting into your hand, making it a little hard to get a hard scrub.</li>
    <li> This is a very pretty and useful brush.  It is easy to hang up, does  a fine job and looks good too. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It was hanging in my shower and the wood got nasty started cracking and molding pretty fast. Had to throw it away within 2 months</li>
    <li> This Nail Brush is just how it looks ,it is very soft but cleans under the nails just fine ,i wanted a Brush that wouldn&#x27;t scratch so this was perfect for me ,i like that i can hang it in my shower,and i clean this by soaking the Brush in Tea Tree essential oil.</li>
    <li> This nail brush is very nice.  It&#x27;s compact, but the bristles are stiff, which makes cleaning under nails easier to do than with the clear plastic bristled ones.  The tips of the bristles feel rounded, which is important as they don&#x27;t damage the sensitive skin underneath fingernails.  They&#x27;re gentle enough that I can use this on both of my children without issues.</li>
    <li> I didnt realize it would be so small until I re-read the description but it was already too late. Otherwise, it was actually what was in the picture and I got it in a great timely matter.</li>
    <li> soft, yet effective and firm enough to clean well.</li>
