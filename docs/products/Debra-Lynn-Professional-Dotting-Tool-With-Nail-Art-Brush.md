### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>perfect.</li>
      <li>They all worked out great!</li>
      <li>Was really happy with the product.</li>
      <li>but this brush is perfect for that, it spreads the paint nice and even.</li>
      <li>What a great tool to get started.  </li>
      <li>Great for getting cuticles that are stuck in \\&quot;corners\\&quot; of nails.</li>
      <li>For the cost I was extremely happy.</li>
      <li>Love it!!  </li>
      <li>So Handy!</li>
      <li>Good quality.</li>
      <li>But when I tried it, it&#x27;s good.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d tried using toothpicks before but without good results.  </li>
      <li>It had some good reviews, so I bought it.</li>
      <li>If you clean the brush periodically then it works wonderfully for manicures.</li>
      <li>Great tool for the home manicure :)</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>Its so handy.</li>
      <li>I got it as a gift and have been thrilled with the result.  </li>
      <li>it comes in handy.</li>
      <li>The brush on the end helps create that perfect smiley line that all of us love on our toes or hands, and the dotting tool on the other end is perfect for any marbling techique.</li>
      <li>Great item, The brush end works great for removing small amounts of nail polish and the pointy end works amazing for designing your nails with dots, flowers etc.!!</li>
      <li>so I can&#x27;t really say how good that is, but the dotting side is great.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just a good fine brush.</li>
      <li>I am definitely satisfied with the price.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t used the dotting side yet, but I love the brush.</li>
      <li>I think the price of this item was more for the dotting tool than the brush.</li>
      <li>, it gets the job done but could&#x27;ve been better.</li>
      <li>I LOVE the tool at the end though.  </li>
      <li>but I am noting that each time I do my nails, I am lossing more and more of the brush.</li>
      <li>She made the comment one day that she would love to find one like it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so excited this was on Amazon!</li>
      <li>This is the perfect combo of a dotting tool(for designs or placing rhinestones) and a brush on the other end (perfect for making smiley&#x27;s for a french tip).</li>
      <li>I was really hoping for something good</li>
      <li>It seemed great at first, then the brush just came right off.</li>
      <li>I found it to be easy to learn</li>
      <li>brush is easily cleaned with nailpolish, and is easy to use.  </li>
      <li>The brush would probably be fine if used soley for cleanup and the dotting tool side.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for making those smooth curves when doing a french manicure on your nails.</li>
      <li>Always wondered how ladies got the french manicure to look so great.  </li>
      <li>This is a fantastic nail art tool.  </li>
      <li>does it&#x27;s job, great to clean the extra nail polish on the edges ...</li>
      <li>If you use it to gently follow the cuticle line of your nails after your first coat, your nail color will look like it was applied professionally and flawlessly.  </li>
      <li>no damages, and the color of the tool is unique, which helps since I&#x27;m in nail tech school.</li>
      <li>I was really excited to use this brush.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve needed both a brush to clean up nail polish applications as well as a dotting tool as I&#x27;m jumping on the nail art band wagon.  </li>
      <li>I love to do my own manicures at home, but I never could quite get the hang of doing french tips.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t see myself using it again, looks like my trips to the nail salon for a french manicure (on my own nails) will have to continue until I find a better quality brush...</li>
      <li>I got this product right away!</li>
      <li>The last time I got my nails done, the girl was using a brush that looked just liked this one, and she made it look so easy.</li>
      <li>it shipped pretty fast and overall is a great item</li>
      <li>I had to gently snip the tips of bristles to make the edge smooth again.</li>
      <li>The whole purpose of the brush is to clean any residue, yet it started smearing the residue on my nails.</li>
      <li>I think I would have rather paid a little more money for something better than this.</li>
      <li>this is exactly what I needed.</li>
      <li>Its ok for dotting although a toothpick does the same for me.  </li>
      <li>this is exactly what i was looking for.</li>
      <li>I use this brush to clean up my french manicures and also to clean up colored polish around my cuticles.  </li>
      <li>After about 15 uses the brush part was pretty much trashed.</li>
      <li>Other that than, it&#x27;s a great brush to have to do your french tips and get all the excess nail color off of your skin and cuticles.</li>
      <li>Just make sure to dip the brush in polish and then dry it off on a paper towel after cleaning up each nail.  </li>
      <li>and although I had gentle acetone 5 bristle hairs came out and the edge is no longer even.</li>
      <li>After using all sorts of household objects as makeshift dotting tools I decided I might as well buy a real one.  </li>
      <li>so it spreads too much as you try to use it.</li>
      <li>I actually really like it.</li>
      <li>It worked to clean up the extra nail polish on the sides..</li>
      <li>This tool is handy nut does not last very long.</li>
      <li>I then apply a second coat of color, but I paint my nails just short of the cuticle line of the first coat, so I don&#x27;t have to clean up the color</li>
      <li>When I do french manicures now, however, I use regular scotch tape as a guide, and it is MUCH easier to make a clean line.  </li>
      <li>and I need a new brush.</li>
      <li>Only thing not wrong with this brush is the dotting tool.</li>
      <li>The first time I used it, the entire brush part came off.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s uneven, which means you cant paint tips because it does not clean up good.</li>
      <li>I did trim it a little though cause the hairs were a bit uneven, so I created a good even edge.</li>
      <li>the brush it too soft</li>
      <li>I just use this to clean up polish while I&#x27;m trying to do a french manicure or if I&#x27;ve painted outside the side of the nail on regular manicures.</li>
      <li>I then use this brush to clean up the small bits of polish that sometime get displaced while removing the tape from my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>after seeing many youtube reviews which called for a dotting tool and being tired with using toothpicks all the time, i knew it was time to invest in a dotting tool.</li>
      <li>The round shape really helps get a natural looking line to tips.</li>
      <li>The dotting side works perfectly fine, but the brush sucks!</li>
      <li>It does not clean excess polish very well because the hairs are too brittle.</li>
      <li>Once wet with acetone, the bristles all separate and its really hard to get a smooth french manicure line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<li> This brush is helpful for making the french manicure smiley by taking off the messy edge of it.  </li>
<li> The metal ball tip on the other end of the nail brush is used for nail design/flowers and is a little smaller than I expected</li>
<li> Definitely not worth almost $7.00.</li>
<li> So, now I&#x27;m down about $7</li>
<li> I had always wondered how nail salons made the little flower designs that involve dots.  </li>
<li> I wish the brush were a little stiffer.  </li>
<li> This is such a poor product.</li>
<li> I use small sweeping motions with a small bit of nailpolish remover on the tip of the brush.  </li>
<li> I was pretty disappointed in this brush.  </li>
<li> Its so small in your hand</li>
<li> that it&#x27;s hard to hold on to.  </li>
<li> In short, mediocre brush equals mediocre results.</li>

    <li> after seeing many youtube reviews which called for a dotting tool and being tired with using toothpicks all the time, i knew it was time to invest in a dotting tool. this is exactly what i was looking for. I always had trouble making the white french tip but this brush is perfect for that, it spreads the paint nice and even. then when i&#x27;m doing i use the dotting point for cheetah print and flowers. I only wish the dot end was a tad bigger because it looked bigger in the picture.</li>
    <li> Always wondered how ladies got the french manicure to look so great.  These brushes are the key.  They are well made and will last a very long time.</li>
    <li> I love it! Its so handy. It&#x27;s great for making those smooth curves when doing a french manicure on your nails. Then after, flip it around and make patterns! So Handy!</li>
    <li> This brush is helpful for making the french manicure smiley by taking off the messy edge of it.  I like the tool.  The opposite end is a ball for dotting your nail. it comes in handy.</li>
    <li> Its ok for dotting although a toothpick does the same for me.  the brush it too soft so it spreads too much as you try to use it. It worked to clean up the extra nail polish on the sides..I wouldn&#x27;t spend money to replace it if it broke or got lost :-(</li>
    <li> I bought this item along with another set of dotting tools. They all worked out great! Shipped and arrived in a timely manner, no damages, and the color of the tool is unique, which helps since I&#x27;m in nail tech school. The brush on the end helps create that perfect smiley line that all of us love on our toes or hands, and the dotting tool on the other end is perfect for any marbling techique.</li>
    <li> The first time I used it, the entire brush part came off. Not to mention, it does leave the white streaks on your nails, even after you wipe, re-dip, and wipe again. Maybe it&#x27;s my \\&quot;technique\\&quot; that I haven&#x27;t mastered yet, but this tool does do the job. I gave this item 4 Stars only because the brush part came off and I wished the dot-head was a bit bigger. Other that than, it&#x27;s a great brush to have to do your french tips and get all the excess nail color off of your skin and cuticles.</li>
    <li> I wish the brush were a little stiffer.  I LOVE the tool at the end though.  Great for getting cuticles that are stuck in \\&quot;corners\\&quot; of nails.</li>
    <li> I actually really like it. It&#x27;s just a good fine brush. Good quality. I did trim it a little though cause the hairs were a bit uneven, so I created a good even edge. But when I tried it, it&#x27;s good.</li>
    <li> I use this brush to clean up my french manicures and also to clean up colored polish around my cuticles.  When I do french manicures now, however, I use regular scotch tape as a guide, and it is MUCH easier to make a clean line.  I then use this brush to clean up the small bits of polish that sometime get displaced while removing the tape from my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I&#x27;m painting my nails with colorpolish, I will apply the first coat and then dip this brush in nailpolish remover and go around the edges of my nails to get all the small bits of polish.  I use small sweeping motions with a small bit of nailpolish remover on the tip of the brush.  I then apply a second coat of color, but I paint my nails just short of the cuticle line of the first coat, so I don&#x27;t have to clean up the color a second time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush is easily cleaned with nailpolish, and is easy to use.  If you use it to gently follow the cuticle line of your nails after your first coat, your nail color will look like it was applied professionally and flawlessly.  Just make sure to dip the brush in polish and then dry it off on a paper towel after cleaning up each nail.  Great tool for the home manicure :)</li>
    <li> The Lady that does my nails every week has one of these nail tools. It is about wore out because she has used it in beauty school and now in her business. She made the comment one day that she would love to find one like it. Well I had been looking on line for one and I finally found it.</li>
    <li> I was anxious to get this brush because I thought I finally could save some money and give myself a french manicure from this point forward. I received the brush on time (2 day shipping) but was disappointed in it as a product. After making the french tip \\&quot;smiles\\&quot; on about five fingers, the brush started to leave white nail polish residue on my nails. The whole purpose of the brush is to clean any residue, yet it started smearing the residue on my nails. The metal ball tip on the other end of the nail brush is used for nail design/flowers and is a little smaller than I expected, it gets the job done but could&#x27;ve been better. I was really hoping for something good and unfortunately I was disappointed. In short, mediocre brush equals mediocre results. I don&#x27;t see myself using it again, looks like my trips to the nail salon for a french manicure (on my own nails) will have to continue until I find a better quality brush...</li>
    <li> I bought this brush to do french manicures. It had some good reviews, so I bought it. Well, lets just say it doesn&#x27;t perform well. The brush smears the polish because the bristles won&#x27;t stay together. I kept trying over &amp; over, but it wouldn&#x27;t work correctly. So, now I&#x27;m down about $7 and I need a new brush.</li>
    <li> I attempted to use the brush to do white tips on my nails and after using brush for a little bit I noticed that the brush started to leave white nail polish residue on my nails making my nails look messy. I gave up and went to get my nails done instead.</li>
    <li> After using all sorts of household objects as makeshift dotting tools I decided I might as well buy a real one.  I haven&#x27;t used the brush end so I can&#x27;t really say how good that is, but the dotting side is great.</li>
    <li> I got this product right away! I ordered it on a Sunday afternoon and I got it Tuesday morning. I couldn&#x27;t wait to use it. This is the perfect combo of a dotting tool(for designs or placing rhinestones) and a brush on the other end (perfect for making smiley&#x27;s for a french tip). I am definitely satisfied with the price. I will be using this every time I do nails.</li>
    <li> I love to do my own manicures at home, but I never could quite get the hang of doing french tips. The last time I got my nails done, the girl was using a brush that looked just liked this one, and she made it look so easy. I looked at every beauty store I could find for it, but never found one. I&#x27;m so excited this was on Amazon! The round shape really helps get a natural looking line to tips. I haven&#x27;t used the dotting side yet, but I love the brush.</li>
    <li> Was really happy with the product. If you clean the brush periodically then it works wonderfully for manicures. The dotting tool is smaller but I like it for smaller detail. For the cost I was extremely happy.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic nail art tool.  I got it as a gift and have been thrilled with the result.  I had always wondered how nail salons made the little flower designs that involve dots.  I&#x27;d tried using toothpicks before but without good results.  This tool made it way easier.  Love it!!  I&#x27;d recommend it for anyone who loves doing their nails.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to use this brush. It seemed great at first, then the brush just came right off. I glued it back on but it didnt last long.</li>
    <li> Great item, The brush end works great for removing small amounts of nail polish and the pointy end works amazing for designing your nails with dots, flowers etc.!! it shipped pretty fast and overall is a great item, I might even have to order another one in case I lose this one!</li>
    <li> I used this brush once and although I had gentle acetone 5 bristle hairs came out and the edge is no longer even. I had to gently snip the tips of bristles to make the edge smooth again. I think the price of this item was more for the dotting tool than the brush. I am ordering a different brush...</li>
    <li> This brush sheds after each nail so I get strands in my manicures. It&#x27;s also thinner than expected. Only thing not wrong with this brush is the dotting tool.</li>
    <li> The brush works good, but the dotter fell out within a few uses, which you can still use the brush but the dotter was useless</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve needed both a brush to clean up nail polish applications as well as a dotting tool as I&#x27;m jumping on the nail art band wagon.  What a great tool to get started.  I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I just use this to clean up polish while I&#x27;m trying to do a french manicure or if I&#x27;ve painted outside the side of the nail on regular manicures. It&#x27;s a nifty tool.</li>
    <li> does it&#x27;s job, great to clean the extra nail polish on the edges ... i haven&#x27;t used the point part yet</li>
    <li> The dotting side works perfectly fine, but the brush sucks! Definitely not worth almost $7.00. It does not clean excess polish very well because the hairs are too brittle. It&#x27;s uneven, which means you cant paint tips because it does not clean up good. I think I would have rather paid a little more money for something better than this. Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a client and truly I would never use it for myself. This is such a poor product.</li>
    <li> This tool is handy nut does not last very long. After about 15 uses the brush part was pretty much trashed. The dotting side still works, its metal.</li>
    <li> this is exactly what I needed. Have used it a handful of times and you get what you see. perfect.</li>
    <li> I have never used a brush to do tips before.  I found it to be easy to learn but I am noting that each time I do my nails, I am lossing more and more of the brush. Which leaves a bad line</li>
    <li> I was pretty disappointed in this brush.  Based on looks, it looks just like what my nail person uses.  But this brush is waaay tiny!  Its only about 3-4 inches in length, including the dotting tip.  Its so small in your hand that it&#x27;s hard to hold on to.  Also, the quality of bristles is quite poor.  Once wet with acetone, the bristles all separate and its really hard to get a smooth french manicure line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would NOT recommend this brush for french manicures.  The brush would probably be fine if used soley for cleanup and the dotting tool side.</li>
