<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great but not worth the price.</li>
    <li> very good leave my fair feeling stronger</li>
    <li> When the Design Essential Wave Nouveau damaged my hair ( didn&#x27;t see the damage until 2 weeks after when hair stared breaking severely), I did research to try and stop the breakage. I purchased this along with the other Design Essential product lines and for only 3 days did the breakage stop. So long as it was being washed every week the breaking would slow down but not stop completely. This only leads to washing out the moisture a lot and then having to replace with more and more products to get it silky again. Back to BC, again.</li>
    <li> I use in combination with a deep moisture conditioner and it does the job. Hair breakage reduced substantially. Great product!</li>
    <li> I have used this product in the past when I was living in Florida back in 2008. I have been looking to repurchase it since then unsuccessfully. I am happy to find it at Amazon. It is a great product and it makes my hair not only strong, but silky and bring my hair back to it natural root.</li>
    <li> Purchased because I was swimming twice a week and the chlorine was damaging my hair.  Purchased this along with Essential Herbal Complex and the neutralizing shampoo.  The texture, color, and strength of my hair has improved.</li>
    <li> This conditioner leaves my hair strong, silky, and shiny. My hair becomes well moisturized and leaves me looking like I&#x27;ve just left the salon every time. This is exactly what my ex-stylist used to use. It lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> This is a essential product for any type of hair.  It helps with shedding, breakage and it aids in getting your back to it&#x27;s healthy state.  Works well with your hair covered in a plastic cap with or without heat.</li>
    <li> I am a Cosmetology student who had short damaged hair when I started using this product.  I use it maybe bi-weekly... I&#x27;d shampoo, rinse and apply this product on damp hair and comb through. You can mix with your favorite conditioner for an additional effect but it is not needed! I put on a plastic cap and sit without a hooded dryer for 30 mins to 1 hour.... You can simply sit under a hooded dryer for 15 minutes if you have one. Since using this product and trimming my ends when needed, I have a nice shine, great growth and healthy hair.</li>
    <li> I am SOOOO happy to have finally found something for my hair. This stuff works great. I&#x27;m black, but I have at least 4 different textures in my head. This one addresses each one. My entire family uses this now. This line of products in combo with a hair steam has turned my hair from dry and barb wire feeling to silky smooth after just 1 use. LOOOOOOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> I had my hair relaxed for many years and now has returned to press and curl.  This conditioner works well to restore my natural texture after the damage caused by relaxing and coloring my hair.</li>
    <li> This conditioner works really well.</li>
    <li> This product works well even without heat. I saw a significant improvement in my hair after one use. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> 6 in 1 IS the best conditioner out there. It bring your hair back to it&#x27;s natural PH, it conditions, detangles and fortifies the hair. As a stylist this is my MUST GO TO product after chemicals or in my shower once a week. If your hair is dry, no shine, lifeless you definitely HAVE to get this product!! Your hair will be glad and so will you!!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t impressed with this product. I didn&#x27;t like how it felt on my hair, and I also didn&#x27;t see a difference.</li>
    <li> Great product and it really needs to be advertized more.</li>
    <li> This is the same product my beautician use to use. It smells awesome, and works great. Keeps my dry, brittle hair moist. I use this once a week as a deep conditioner by leaving 2 shower caps on for 45minutes to an hr. This is also good for me because I am transitioning to natural. I&#x27;m trying to get out of the habit of using in store brands, because they have to many chemicals in them. I use this conditioner along with the conditioning shampoo and leave in conditioner that I also purchased off Amazon. My hair loves it!&lt;br /&gt;About 2yrs ago I tried buying this product, the relaxer, and other things and I had to have a beautician license. That being said, I knew this would work great and give me pleasing results. I&#x27;m glad I can purchase it now.</li>
    <li> Conditions hair very well.  Helped with shedding. I use it once a week and results were noticeable after 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> feels good in my hair</li>
    <li> My stylist uses this product on my hair so I decided to buy it for home use. My hair has been colored and permed and this product keeps my hair from shedding and makes its softer. Plus 32oz will probably last me 8 months if I uses it everyother week.</li>
    <li> I love this product,  but forgot that it&#x27;s a protein based product &amp; I&#x27;m protein sensitive. Stopped my shedding though:)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product!</li>
    <li> Best repair conditioner ever!  Love the scent.</li>
    <li> I love this product, especially as a deep conditioner.  It works great as a detangler as well. I&#x27;m almost 6 months into my natural self and I am so glad that I was introduced to this conditioner.  It also works great under the steamer.</li>
    <li> OMG this is an amazing thick coating conditioner.. i have short hair and used a quarter size.. it made my hair really soft no sheading.. i needed a deep condition so i let set for a little bit.. my hair had a healthy shine to it. i would definatly buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Could not find it locally so this was a great alternative to purchase online. It is a great product adds lots of moisture to the hair.</li>
    <li> I had so much damage from a relaxer, and after just a couple of uses, my hair is back to normal. I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> Design Essentials hair products for relaxed is total care this conditioner really reconstruct your hair looks shiny feels great and soft and bouncy, fragrance fantastic!</li>
    <li> This is the same product my hair dresser uses, but there are several products on the market with less harsh ingredients so shop around if you pay attention to and prefer more natural products.</li>

    <li> The reconstructive conditioner arrived on time.  Furthermore, the product was in good condition.  Unfortunately, I did not receive the best benefits from this product.  After washing my hair and restoring it with a deep conditioner, my hair was still stiff and unmanageable.</li>
