      <li>Do not expect it to be effective for a severe breakout.</li>

      <li>Fabulous on skin as well as scalp.</li>
      <li>However, I still use a light conditioner (Nioxin) that makes it easier to comb my curly hair.</li>
      <li>It does leave your hair clean</li>
      <li>This is about having a condition that requires something that works and being able to get it from someone who sells it for a reasonable price.  </li>
      <li>If you just need some temperary reliefe its ok to start with and to keep it from becoming a sour.</li>

    <li> Ok I have moderate to savier Psoriasis most of it covers my scalp like a patch work doll thank god I have always had thick head of hair.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the shampo for about two weeks now it relieves some of my itchi scalp and keeps the dry silver flacky skin from building&lt;br /&gt;so bad to become a sour but thats all.So far it has not facilitated the healing of the on going large red raised patches of my scalps skin.&lt;br /&gt;or in other areas.but does offer some relief. If you just need some temperary reliefe its ok to start with and to keep it from becoming a sour.</li>
    <li> Have problem skin and this works well for me.  I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Omg this has been a good idea to try out I have use all kinds of shampoo and this is the one that has worked I will keep on using it.</li>
    <li> It is of not much use.</li>
    <li> Scalp clear in 2 weeks when used with Metagenics D3 (10,000 units) with K2 (90 mcg)</li>
    <li> Need to use it every day to be effective.  It does relieve my psoriasis itching for the day. Do not expect it to be effective for a severe breakout. However, I still use a light conditioner (Nioxin) that makes it easier to comb my curly hair.</li>
    <li> This is about having a condition that requires something that works and being able to get it from someone who sells it for a reasonable price.  This product meets all those standards.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product.  I have used others, with no improvement.  I use this shampoo every couple of days and have no itching anymore.  It leaves my hair normal, not dry or oily.  It does not smell bad.  I highly recommend this shampoo.  I have used it for over 6 months.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t take the itch away from my scalp. That&#x27;s what it was recommended for.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased to have found this. It really helped my scalp psoriasis and cut down the itching.</li>
    <li> We have used this shampoo for 3 years now and love the results.  No more itchy scalp and it is also a great conditioner.</li>
    <li> It does leave your hair clean but I still have itchy scalp.  I&#x27;m hoping in another week or so to see more of an improvement.</li>
    <li> This shampoo/conditioner is the only one I have found to work on my unruly scalp.  T-Gel has so strong and the smell I cannot tolerate it, but this product works the best.  You can use it everyday (if need be), and it is safe to use on colored hair.</li>
    <li> My husband has used this for many years. It works very well for him</li>
    <li> Fabulous on skin as well as scalp.Gets rid of my eczema on scalp and face ....exfoliates way more than pricey products.</li>
    <li> This truly helps my kids. They have super dry skin and eczema.</li>
    <li> not for me, had to return it</li>
    <li> I ordered it for someone else - not sure how the product actually is because it exploded in the packaging.  Disappointing.</li>
    <li> Performed as expected, but was drying on my hair and scalp.</li>
    <li> I bought this in hopes it would help my seborrheic dermatitis as it states on the bottle that it does.  Used exactly as the instructions specify with no results at all.  Not really surprised, no other products seem to work well either.  The best results for me have been T-gel, but that still isn&#x27;t much.</li>
    <li> Helps with the scalp problem that I have had for quite a while.</li>
    <li> I have an itchy scalp.  Started about a year ago and I have been to a dermatologist and was given topicals which didn&#x27;t appear to be effective after prolonged use.  I read about this shampoo then gave it a try.  After using for a prolonged period I have found some relief.  I am not scratching like I had previously so I am satisfied.  Note:  I have tried many other shampoos, treatments and tea tree oil.  I like this product.</li>
    <li> This shampoo does what it says. I applied it twice and noticed that the scabbing on my scalp reduced by 80% and after 4/5 uses it&#x27;s gotten down to 95% with little scabs if any at all. My head is flake free and no more bleeding!!! I&#x27;m so happy with this product!</li>
    <li> Only been using it for two weeks but its seems to slowly be working. More time will tell.</li>
