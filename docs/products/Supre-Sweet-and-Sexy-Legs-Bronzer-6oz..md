      <li>very sweet and sexy  </li>
      <li>I am very fair and have a hard time getting my legs to tan and this bronzer worked great for helping my legs to tan.  </li>
      <li>I went tanning every day for 5 days for 10mins and my legs have a super nice bronze tan to them.</li>
      <li>Gives my legs a nice tan that lasts and instantly, smells great and also see some appearance improvements in my legs in toning the skin.</li>
      <li>it feels so soft and smells great.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t burn easy.</li>
      <li>and I like to use this in conjunction with the Sweet &amp; Sexy tan extending lotion.</li>
      <li>so i bought sweet and sexy legs.</li>
      <li>After just one use I could tell a big difference, my husband compliments me on my beautiful legs every day.</li>
      <li>Easy to apply; makes skin feel smooth.</li>
      <li>Also works great for an instant temp tanning affect.</li>
      <li>and I liked it so much I reordered it.</li>
      <li>It smells amazing &amp; really does work.</li>
      <li>I noticed a difference right away!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve become very fond of all the Sweet &amp; Sexy tanning products.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;ve been searching for a good lotion that would actually work for me.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Good coloring for my normally very white legs.</li>
      <li>I just love this particular brand and bronzer,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

      <li>I have used this for a few weeks now and it works great</li>

      <li>I have the entire Sweet &amp; Sexy line</li>
      <li>It smells awesome and gives a deep, dark color.  </li>
      <li>Like most people, I always have a hard time getting nice color on my legs, and this does the trick.  </li>
      <li>It does work on your arms, but you lose the tan super fast for some reason, so you might as well not count on this for your arms.</li>
      <li>If you want tan legs fast, this is the product you need!</li>
      <li>you need an extra boost of tan without turning \\&quot;orange\\&quot; :)</li>

      <li>This is the first thing that has tanned my legs now that I&#x27;m 40+.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT! It smells like vanilla and sugar and it gives great color! Doesn&#x27;t have a strong after tan odor either!</li>
    <li> I have a hard time tanning my legs, I have been tanning in my tanning bed for over a month now and my legs were still not getting dark.&lt;br /&gt;I used this product for the first time last night and I can already tell the difference!&lt;br /&gt;I will keep using and update after a few more uses.</li>
    <li> helps minimize shaving but turns orange</li>
    <li> My wife decided she wanted to get in shape and get tan. So she hit the gym and then started to use the tanning bed. While I make not be using this products I certainly do admire the effect is having on her skin tone and the boost it is giving her self confidence.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  I don&#x27;t tan that fast but this stuff makes me look like I have a great tan. I love it!  Going to order more soon!</li>
    <li> It smells amazing &amp; really does work. I&#x27;ve become very fond of all the Sweet &amp; Sexy tanning products. I&#x27;ve been using this on my legs for a couple months now &amp; just ordered my second bottle. It does work on your arms, but you lose the tan super fast for some reason, so you might as well not count on this for your arms. It does indeed make your leg hair grow much slower &amp; it&#x27;s less noticeable too. Everyone who has a problem tanning their legs should own this product!</li>
    <li> I seriously love this tanning lotion. It comes out the bottle super dark already and once you put it on your.legs it feels so soft and smells great. It made my legs dark and fast. I would recommended this product to anyone. And you really can&#x27;t best the price!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have used other tanners in the past, but Sweet &amp; Sexy surpassed all my expectations. I will order again, and I will tell all my friends that use a tanner about this wonderful product.easy to apply, absorbs quickly, no nasty odor.</li>
    <li> I have used this product many times and just love how dark your legs actually get, I also sometimes use it on my arms , very pleased and will need some more soon, so will be ordering again ..</li>
    <li> this product worked great!!!! my legs are so tan and it also makes your leg hair grow alot slower then normal im for sure buying another bottle when im finished with the one i have</li>
    <li> First I just want to say that I received this product within a few days of completing my order online....I will definately buy from this retailer again.    Second, I love this product.  I have a hard time getting my legs and arms tan, and this product has helped put some color on my legs and yes on my arms.  I use it on both and it works great.    I would highly recommend this retailer and this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion for tanning your legs!</li>
    <li> I love this bronzer! I just started tanning.  It works well... I have medium color skin... I don&#x27;t burn easy.</li>
    <li> I will buy this product again, the price it so much better than what it cost in the tanning store, works great!</li>
    <li> Great product love this stuff !</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely amazing!! If you want tan legs fast, this is the product you need! Just purchased my second bottle of this!</li>
    <li> I have used this product before and I liked it so much I reordered it. Has a pleasant smell, I use 3 different lotions when I tan and this one mixes well with the other two I use.</li>
    <li> Lovethis , smells good works great!</li>
    <li> not  bronzer at all  - it is most as misturizer with very good scent  0 very sweet and sexy  but dont add any much color  to my white legs , even after sun exposure-  - I will not buy again-</li>
    <li> I noticed a difference right away! I keep looking for new products and continue to go back to this leg bronzer. It smells nice. I have sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t make me break out. It leaves a nice brown color on your skin, not orange. As always, wipe/wash your hand really well after you apply or you will get brown streaks on your hands. You would think this is common knowledge with a bronzer but some people write bad reviews because they&#x27;re idiotic and don&#x27;t know how to use a tanning lotion properly.</li>
    <li> I only used the product a few times.  I do see a little color in my legs, I hope they continue to get darker because my legs never tan in a stand up tanning booth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time will tell!!!</li>
    <li> Good coloring for my normally very white legs.</li>
    <li> Nothing else ever works for my legs but I have bought this product over and over again and will continue to do so. Just love it!</li>
    <li> I have the entire Sweet &amp; Sexy line so I knew what to expect in terms of scent which I find pleasant. I&#x27;m not sure that I would consider this a bronzer though. It has worked only a tiny bit better than what I use on the rest of my body.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion -- gives a beautiful color from the first time you use it.  Like most people, I always have a hard time getting nice color on my legs, and this does the trick.  Doesn&#x27;t look &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; &amp; doesn&#x27;t turn my skin orange.  I will order it again &amp; again.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this lotion. It smells awesome and gives a deep, dark color.  I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a bronzer!</li>
    <li> This is the first thing that has tanned my legs now that I&#x27;m 40+. I felt like I shaved off my tan when I used my razor. Not anymore.</li>
    <li> My legs never did get bronzed.  Tanned up to 12 min each time three times a week to get ready for my cruise.</li>
    <li> The lotion did not work to make my legs any more tan than what they already were and it clumps up on your skin</li>
    <li> This is the perfect tanning lotion.  It has a nice smell (like a cupcake almost) and is the only product that helps me get color on my legs.  The shave-minimizing ingredients also work well.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great stuff! I am very fair and have a hard time getting my legs to tan and this bronzer worked great for helping my legs to tan.  Would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This lotion gets your legs so dark, smells amazing, no streaking. Best part is the price, the salons charge $30+ for it...can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t tan very easily so I&#x27;ve been searching for a good lotion that would actually work for me.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it all over, not just on my legs. I&#x27;m already darker and I&#x27;ve only used it a couple times so far. Very happy. &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I have been tanning carefully for years.i have used this product and liked it,it seemed to get my legs tan faster than anything else.i ordered a bottle online and after using it on my legs,i had severe itching that went on for weeks.i thought the product was tainted and chided myself for trying to save a few dollars by ordering online.I bought a tube at the overpriced tanning salon ,with much hesitance,alas the itching bumps were their again,my legs itched so bad i almost drew blood,my nails were worn down in the middle the itching was so severe.i mentioned it to the ditzy girl at the tanning salon and no one has \\&quot;gotten  back to me\\&quot;how could i have used this product successfully for years and all of a sudden react the i have..either a batch of this stuff is defective or the product is old and they keep selling it anyways...either way something is wrong and when i use another tanning product i do not have this issue.it befuddles me.if you have money to throw away in this economy then go for it or buy from somewhere with a good return policy.happy tanning!</li>
    <li> perfect for boosting that deep rich color when tanning with natural and artificial light. Also works great for an instant temp tanning affect. Just apply, hit with heat (blowdryer) for a few minutes...and BAM...instant tan!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product; wouldn&#x27;t leave home without it. My legs are tanned and beautiful all year. Easy to apply; makes skin feel smooth.</li>
    <li> Legs are the hardest part of your body to tan due the amount of muscle in them. This product works perfectly to get that bronze tan on you&#x27;re legs too!</li>
    <li> OMG! my legs are so hard to tan. so i bought sweet and sexy legs. and it ACTUALLY WORKS! i love it. I went tanning every day for 5 days for 10mins and my legs have a super nice bronze tan to them. it smells great too. I will diff. buy this product again. It got to me pretty fast. I was surprised because it arrvied before my esti. date. THIS ITEM REALLY WORKS! if your legs are hard to tan BUY THIS!</li>
    <li> I have used this for a few weeks now and it works great i was at a point where i coundnt get tanner using this helped alot!</li>
    <li> it gets your legs pretty tan, not as dark as you would expect though. although i will say it works wonders on the rest of your body.</li>
    <li> This brand has given me the best results possible, and I love it because you can use it for outdoor tanning as well as indoor tanning. The results really do last, and does not wash off completely in the shower, especially if you are continually using the product. 2 thumbs up.</li>
    <li> I love this product! Gives my legs a nice tan that lasts and instantly, smells great and also see some appearance improvements in my legs in toning the skin. Great product...however, it will stain your hands if you do not wash your hands immediately after application but a great product!</li>
    <li> This is second bottle!! Works GREAT, price AWESOME!</li>
    <li> This is a really great bronzer for the legs.  Legs are so hard to tan most of the time.  This bronzer gives the tan good acceleration.</li>
    <li> AWESOME stuff. Possibly even BETTER then some of the super expensive stuff out there.&lt;br /&gt;My legs are SO HARD to tan and this is the only stuff that works for me. LOVE IT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The salon sells it for $40 which is insane. lol The snotty girls always say &amp;#34;I see that you have that lotion but you didnt buy it here. When you need some more, I&#x27;ll give you a deal for $35&amp;#34; I&#x27;m like, uhhhh no thanks I&#x27;ll get it for $10-15 on Amazon. lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NEVER buy tanning lotions anywhere but AMAZON!</li>
    <li> I think this stuff works pretty well in the bronzer bed. My tan seems to last longer, although I don&#x27;t notice it slowing hair growth. It smells great! and I like to use this in conjunction with the Sweet &amp; Sexy tan extending lotion. I will buy again when mine runs out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, I used this on pretty much my whole body and it was fine! It works anywhere you need an extra boost of tan without turning \\&quot;orange\\&quot; :)</li>
    <li> I got this for all over.  I just love this particular brand and bronzer,&lt;br /&gt;I can see the difference when I tan indoors.  It smells great and works&lt;br /&gt;quick.  Non greasy, creamy texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Yes I would highly recommend this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, don&#x27;t wear white clothes til after you shower&lt;br /&gt;since the bronzer will get on your clothes and you can&#x27;t just wipe it off.&lt;br /&gt;Your clothes will need to go through the washer.</li>
    <li> it works great! i am going to keep purchasing it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. It smells nice. Doesn&#x27;t leave a weird after smell like most of them do. And It really works even on my pale ginger skin.</li>
    <li> This product is very oily feeing, even after you wipe it off.  Make sure it&#x27;s rubbed in good or you will get streaking.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t care for it.</li>
    <li> this smells amazing, it came sealed inside the cap and in plastic. It came quickly and I am super tan ...LOVE this stuff!</li>
    <li> I love this product, it has made such a difference in my tan. I go a few times a week and until I used this product my legs did get tan but not super dark. After just one use I could tell a big difference, my husband compliments me on my beautiful legs every day. One of the best products I ever purchased on Amazon!</li>
