    <li> Great  fragrance, but I found it at fragrancex.com for $7.59.</li>
    <li> I usually wear Fresh Guy but decided to try Freshest Cleanest for a little change of pace.  While I really enjoy Freshest Cleanest it is definitely stronger and more pungent.  It&#x27;s worth the money and worth a try ... but it is not Fresh Guy ... but I think that&#x27;s obvious.</li>
    <li> Loving it!  Fresh and clean for a reason.  Good stuff.  Light and fresh.</li>
    <li> Efficient service, good product</li>
    <li> Cheap price and smells great!  What more could a man want.  I have gotten multiple comments from strangers about how great this smells.  Totally worth the money.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this fragrance. It&#x27;s his favorite.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t get it in stores. The have other Bod fragrances but for some reason they never have this one.</li>
    <li> This is the best body spray for my particular chemistry, I think.  I get all kinds of compliments.  I prefer it over expensive colognes</li>
    <li> Literally is basically rubbing alcohol. Horrible stuff, spray bottle is good and it came quickly however this stuff is awful.</li>
    <li> I found it a few years ago in another store but they have quit carrying the item&lt;br /&gt;get lots of guys who ask me what I have on but its not strong like a leading cologne</li>
    <li> Freshest Cleanest! Love the body spray, great aroma. I need more</li>
    <li> Smells refreshing. It doesnt have to last all I day. I enjoy it while it lasts.</li>
    <li> A little bit much in cost but love the great fragrance</li>
    <li> This fragrance is sort of a copy of versace man eau fraiche (a $70 high end cologne). It has a very similar fresh lemon/ citrus smell too it, although not quite as refined as eau fraiche. I own the real thing as well as many other designer colognes, so why would I buy this thing ?.....simple, yard work and other situations I don&#x27;t want to waste the expensive stuff. When I go to cut my grass, I don&#x27;t reach for my expensive fragrances. I choose a cheap body spray instead. I like the bod series because they do a great job getting a smell close to a designer fragrances. The only issue I found is they don&#x27;t last as long as a good quality cologne. I get between 3-4 hours from the fragrance before I have to re-apply. This works out perfectly for me, because right after I do any work that causes sweat I shower. I could see this working really good for someone who goes to the gym. I wore this to work once just for kicks and got complemented on how good I smell......I haven&#x27;t gotten that good of a reaction out of the $55 cologne I usually wear. I would definitely recommend this fragrance to anyone who loves fresh clean smelling scents.</li>
    <li> A few weeks ago we had an incident.    A bottle of this had been abandoned, intentionally, in our bathroom. Someone mistook the large trigger-spray bottle for windex and used it to \\&quot;clean\\&quot; the mirror in the bathroom. It does not matter that our mirror is no longer usable, as no men will any longer go into the bathroom.    However, since the incident there has been a larger-than-normal quantity of women milling about our floor seemingly unable to leave. This stuff really is like magic!    5 stars!</li>
    <li> Smells fresh and clean. I used to get BOD a lot back in the day, but I just stopped. I like this because you can put it on in the morning, get home go to the gym and it starts to smell when good again when you sweat. I am not saying you should cover body odor with it. I&#x27;m just saying that it works all day when you need to smell good.</li>
    <li> i see them sniff then smile and suddenly hug me, even the cats like it so i feel good about myself again.</li>
    <li> delivery was fast, great price and love the scent!! get alot of compliments on  it!!  yes, it is acceptable for men and women!!</li>
    <li> This one smells like perfume, a perfume for ladies. It does make you smell &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; but smells like a perfume.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my husband. He loved it but it was a bit strong for me. I get migraines and this&lt;br /&gt;was just too strong a fragrance for me to smell.</li>
    <li> Great product from reliable source</li>
    <li> I have all of the BOD body sprays! This is probably in my top three of all of them?</li>
