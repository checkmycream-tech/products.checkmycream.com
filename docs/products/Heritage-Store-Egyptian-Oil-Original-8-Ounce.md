    <li> This is not the Egyptian Oil I was expecting. It smells pungent and tangy. I am used to the Egyptian Musk that I have worn for years and I thought this was a refill-type bottle of that. It should come with a disclaimer or explanation that it&#x27;s not the common type of Egyptian oil.</li>
    <li> I use this to help manage muscle pain. It works wonderfully. It smells great and leaves my skin feeling moisturized. I like that I can use this natural product to help my Fibromyalgia rather than one full of chemicals.</li>
    <li> I love this oil.it is so clean smelling and non oily so it doesn&#x27;t wreck clothes. People always ask what the nice smell is?!😃 I love this stuff!!</li>
    <li> Absolutely Love this Oil. Great on my dry hands, elbows, and more, after the Harsh winter we have had, in NY state. Great for working out those tired muscles you have after a hard days work, or shoveling or yard work too. Nice for using as a massage aid too. Wonderful scent, Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have ordered this multiple times.  I love it.  The feel, the smell.  I find the combination sassafrass and fir needle scent delightful.  Both restful and envigorating.</li>
    <li> this oil it like Magic&lt;br /&gt;helps with joint pain&lt;br /&gt;good quality product&lt;br /&gt;a must have for an old age&lt;br /&gt;to use everyday...</li>
    <li> will always renew this</li>

    <li> This stuff is amazing. You have to use after shower when you&#x27;re still wet before you dry!</li>
    <li> This is very helpful for joints or if there are issues falling asleep.  In all, I&#x27;ve puchased 5 or 6 bottles from different suppliers. Amazon service has been great. Can&#x27;t be without!!!</li>
    <li> Helps soften tissue, heal dry cracked skin on hands for me.  Smell is not as strong as eucalyptus, mixed with slight pine scent.  Had cracked hands that weren&#x27;t healing (from using Oven Off with no gloves).  After 3 days there was no improvement.  Put this on my hands at night and the next morning the skin was totally restored.</li>
    <li> Received the Oil. While it is good, The formula has changed as you have disappointed that  paraffin&lt;br /&gt;is the first ingredient not happy about .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;bob s</li>
    <li> love it great for inflammation ..a must buy ...please do not ever discontinue ...I need more of this has helped me with many injuries</li>
    <li> Egyptian Oil is a Cayce remedy that has kept me going despite my arthritis and muscle problems for 20 years!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years for my arthritic knees and it does wonders!  It is so soothing to them, I reccomend the  product to all.</li>
    <li> A bit pricy for 8 oz, but the smell is very nice and my massage guy loves it as well.  I would recommend that you buy one and give it a try, I think you will love it as well.</li>
    <li> I use this for a massage oil. It helps with Arthritus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My problem with this item is I have not received the order yet.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered it the same time as the Caster Oil bottle?&lt;br /&gt;I think it is a seperate SUPPLIER but they need to get with it&lt;br /&gt;on delivering more quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Nancy Christensen</li>
    <li> There was no profanity. I stated why I am dissatisfied with the item and I even wrote about trying to return the item tat does smell like Egyptian oil, requesting a refund. I shared that the seller stated that the return time has expired (which it has not). That time is early march. I will not be ordering from amazon or through amazon ant longer. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I was surprised at how well this oil worked when rubbed into my aching knees.  The pain subsides and walking is much easier.</li>
