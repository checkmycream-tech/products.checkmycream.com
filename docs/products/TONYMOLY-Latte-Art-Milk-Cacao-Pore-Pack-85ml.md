    <li> Love the way my face feel!!! Redness disappears quickly and my face just flows! Defiantly buying again and again!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t wait to use it! I took off a star because it came a little damaged, but shipping was fast! I&#x27;ve heard great things about tonymoly, and I&#x27;ve been DYING to get my hands on it!!!</li>
    <li> Love it, I love chocolate and how it closes my pores. Yes</li>
    <li> I love this product is amazing&lt;br /&gt;And it works wonders for my skin!!</li>
    <li> This product is so hydrating! It wasn&#x27;t nice and swirly when I opened it which was kind of a bummer but not a big deal. The container is SO CUTE like so many TONYMOLY products. I will definitely purchase again. Would make a great gift for coffee lovers. Containers are always high quality too! I love this product and this brand!</li>
    <li> Love it! It&#x27;s a wonderful clay pore pack that is also affordable. It&#x27;s about 5 inches tall. Using it once a week will last me about 8 months of use.&lt;br /&gt;It smells amazing. It&#x27;s not strong enough to give me a headache. It&#x27;s a nice blend of chocolate and milk. The instructions are in Korean though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*It says to mix everything after opening for best results. It&#x27;s optional though, you can keep the brown and white separated if you prefer to do the 1:1 ratio.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After applying toner, I applied a dime size amount of the pack to my face, I waited 12 minutes then washed it off with lukewarm water. A few days later my skin definitly improved. It was glowing and hydrated even on cold dry weather. My makeup looked smoother as well. I love clay masks and this one is really great. Cute packaging and great fragrance. Great quality too!</li>
    <li> I used it and it made my skin feel super soft.&lt;br /&gt;It also smells good and its very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product and I am going to get another one of these when I run out.</li>
    <li> This TONYMOLY product works wonderfully. I like to use it when I have a spa day for myself. The container is a little smaller then I thought it would be, but still well worth the money. It is very cute and I like the little spatula it comes with. it made my skin feel very moisturized and my pores looked much better after just one use.</li>
    <li> This stuff is freaking great for my face! The packaging is sooo cute, it smells like smores. Definitely tightened &amp; softened my skin. Will be purchasing this again. Plus shipping &amp; deliver was early, so awesome.</li>
    <li> I really, really, REALLY wanted to like this mask. It smelled fantastic and the packaging was too cute. However, it made my skin burn - I ended up having to wash it off prematurely. And, unfortunately, it ended up breaking me out - I&#x27;m still working on undoing the damage from it. It has peppermint oil in it, I believe, which caused my skin irritation.</li>
    <li> Such cute packaging, smells like a latte, works splendidly. There is so much win with this product. Loved it!</li>
    <li> Ok so when I ordered this I thought it would take awhile but it came sooner than I expected. The packing kept the product pretty safe and I was happy with how it was handled. The product goes on nice and smooth and I ended up just mixing it all since that&#x27;s what the box says to do after first use. The smell is AMAZING but if you don&#x27;t like the smell of s&#x27;mores I guess you won&#x27;t like it. When you mix the product it turns into a gray-ish color but the color doesn&#x27;t matter to me. After I was off my skin feels really good. I have really oily skin prone to breaking out. I&#x27;m Mediterranean heritage with the tan skin and this product helped me. Hope you find this review helpful!</li>
    <li> This pore pack smells heavenly and chocolatey and leaves my skin marvelously smooth and soft.  I love using it in the morning just after a bath, it helps to mitigate the effects of PMS on my skin, and unclogs everything.  I love this pore pack, and its adorable little package.  My only complaint is the spatula is a little short and doesn&#x27;t reach the bottom of the container.</li>
    <li> Love the smell!! It makes my skin so smooth and soft like a baby skin. Pores seem to less visibly overtime. not a miracle product but definitely imrove my skin texture.</li>
    <li> Upon arrival the unit was smaller than I had anticipated, I wasn&#x27;t worried tho, the unit was so cheap I didn&#x27;t mind that it was small. Later that evening I tied my hair back and mixed the contents of the container and spread it amongst my face making sure not to get any in my eyes or on my lips as stated on the packaging. It says to leave it on for around 10 minutes so I did just that. This is my first ever face mask product so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect. After a few moments on my face there was a burning/tingling sensation that does disappear after a while, the mask hardens and I found it easier to wipe away with a wash cloth, gently! I&#x27;ve used it a few time and I have seen an improvement in my skins oiliness, I&#x27;m not using it every night that way it doesn&#x27;t completely dry out my face, but maybe 1-2 a week will really help my face!! I saw the skin color too on my face evened out and my cheeks weren&#x27;t so red. I love it and when I run out I will be buying more!!</li>
    <li> i use this with my family members and they like it as much as i do. feels great too i</li>
    <li> I love this stuff:&lt;br /&gt;-cute packaging-- Tonymoly always has the cutest and most unique designs&lt;br /&gt;-delicious chocolate scent&lt;br /&gt;-distributes smoothly onto the face (you need to mix the white cream and chocolate swirls, and it becomes a grayish color)&lt;br /&gt;-I leave this on for thirty minutes (it can be a bit hard to wash off afterwards, however) and can definitely see its effects. My pores are smaller, the oil levels of my face go down, redness is soothed, and my skin is generally brighter and softer. This lasts for 1-2 days, which is typical for masks.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a great product.</li>
    <li> - Just Got This Today! LOVE It Sad Cus It Was Already Half Mixed Do To The Long Process Of Getting Where I Live But I Dont Mind Now Since I Have To Mix It All Up &amp; It Came Safe &amp; Everything LOVE IT &amp; Will Be Buying More &amp; More Products Of TonyMoly I Just Love Korean Makeup!</li>
    <li> Smell is amazing and shipping was 2 days early. Alot smaller then in the image but smell and the soft skin afterwords makes up for it. Came with a lovely free sample. All together in my opinion its a great product. :)</li>
    <li> The scent is only when you apply the mask. It smells of cocoa! The texture is sublime and the stick applicator is perfect for control. The mask washes off with a little encouragement, and my face is pearly underneath. No oil, no dryness, no stickiness. Perfection!</li>
    <li> Awesome mud mask. Smells great. Arrived in a timely manner, in excellent condition and came with samples!</li>
