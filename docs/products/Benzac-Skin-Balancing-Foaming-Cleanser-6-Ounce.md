      <li>It hasn&#x27;t impressed us enough to make me want to buy more when this bottle is gone.</li>

      <li>Anyone who has skin that is easier to manage may have better luck with this cleanser.</li>

      <li>/&gt;Other than that, it rinses so very clean, as to leave no oil residue at all.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not messy and the pump is great.</li>

      <li>While the Benzac is great at cleaning her face, it did not work well for getting makeup off for obvious reasons.  </li>
      <li>Removes dirt and oil very well and has a nice orange scent.</li>
      <li>The Benzac Skin Balancing Foaming Cleanser is easy to use and makes your face feel really clean afterwards.  </li>
      <li>and I like the light citrus scent (it&#x27;s made with Sandalwood  oil but smells like orange to me).</li>
      <li>I notice my face looks oil free afterward.</li>
      <li>Foremost, it rinses super easy (effortlessly) and cleanly.</li>
      <li>First off, I love the smell.  </li>
      <li>This is the same ingredient used by most popular skin blemish cleansers.</li>
      <li>Instead of having a squeaky clean feeling face, it literally felt greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>We found this product excellent in that regard and better than many of the other products in the same, or slightly higher, price range.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I really wanted to be able to use this cleanser.  </li>
      <li>This product has done neither harm nor good for my teen son.</li>
      <li>If after being full devoted to the kit after six months, you should consider trying another program or consulting your physician.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>And it smells good (sandalwood), not like the traditional acne medicine (which smells like a medicine).</li>
      <li>It dissipates fairly quickly.  </li>
      <li>I scrubbed it off as quickly as I could.  </li>
      <li>It comes out in a nice light foam that i use with my facial scrubbing system.</li>
      <li>I HAVE been able to get my kids to put aside the soaps and shampoos with fragrances in them in exchange for more pure cleansers, and my wife and I are constantly on their cases about face-washing.</li>
      <li>I have two teens in my household, now, and both are dealing with all the fun skin imperfections that come with the age.</li>
      <li>Overall, I liked this product.</li>
      <li>Fun stuff.  </li>
      <li>However, I really enjoyed the light sandalwood scent and it was even better that it didn&#x27;t linger after washing like many other facial cleansers I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
      <li>All elements of the collection are affordable (they are moderately priced) and they work best as a collection (but do be very careful ...</li>
      <li>lets you get out just the right amount.  </li>
      <li>This facial cleanser is pretty amazing....</li>
      <li>As for the cleanser itself, it doesn&#x27;t foam much, but it does get my skin clean.  </li>
      <li>Goes on very easily, just 1 pump and apply, and also comes off very simply without a lot of scrubbing.</li>
      <li>This cleanser is good in that it didn&#x27;t cause a breakout  because it was a new product added to my facial regimen.  </li>
      <li>Used this in conjunction with a different brand of facial moisturizer, but suspect this would be most effective when all their products are used together.</li>
      <li>liked the fact that it doesn&#x27;t leave my face overly dry and having a tight-faced feeling.</li>
      <li>Leaves my skin feeling very clean and soft, plus is gentle around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It definitely makes my skin feel clean and smooth</li>
      <li>I do like the foam pump of the Benzac, and I also like the scent pretty well.</li>
      <li>Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with this product.</li>
      <li>I was interested in trying this as I wash my face every night</li>
      <li>My skin has stayed clear and free of blemishes while using this.</li>
      <li>Benzac Skin Balancing Foaming Cleanser is the first product I have ever tried from Benzac</li>
      <li>It smells funny</li>
      <li>if used over-zealously at first, they can cause drying and redness.</li>
      <li>Like many people I&#x27;ve struggled with oily skin my entire life.  </li>
      <li>Regardless, I like that you can control the amount of product that you use...meaning one pump is more than enough.</li>
      <li>This is an honest review because I don&#x27;t work for Mary Kay or Avon or any other cosmetic company for that.</li>
      <li>This is a really good daily cleanser for people with moderate breakouts.  </li>
      <li>you have dryer skin, you may want to try it just once a day at first to make sure it doesn&#x27;t dry you out too much.</li>
      <li>Packaging is also not designed smartly.</li>
      <li>It is very gentle which may be good for some who do not have as serious of an acne problem as me.  </li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t really help either.  </li>
      <li>Two pumps seemed sufficient to cleanse my whole face.  </li>
      <li>Since I have very oily skin, this is a surprise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;The foaming cleanser dispenser works very well and evenly dispenses the product.  </li>
      <li>really think it&#x27;s something that will work for some people and not others, depending on skin type and sensitivity.</li>
      <li>Much nicer to your skin.</li>
      <li>.5% Salicylic Acid didn&#x27;t really do much for my oily skin.  </li>
      <li>Applies gently to your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I found it cleaned very well.  </li>
      <li>It really burned my face when I put it on.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Benzac Skin Balancing Foam Cleanser is gentle (even for my sensitive skin), lite (doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on the skin) and super easy to use. I have what the dermatologist described as \\&quot;adult acne\\&quot;, go figure......I grew up, had two kids and now suffer with the occasional breakout (certain times of the month on the chin and cheek). Anyway, I like the fact that this cleanser is in a pump bottle, although I always feel cheated with pump bottles because it doesn&#x27;t seem to be a lot of product in the container. Regardless, I like that you can control the amount of product that you use...meaning one pump is more than enough. The main ingredient is salicylic acid which is gentle. After using this product my face isn&#x27;t red, irritated or peeling.  I have even added a little \\&quot;Purpose Cleansing Soap\\&quot; to the foam to make it creamier. And it smells good (sandalwood), not like the traditional acne medicine (which smells like a medicine). And finally..... the price. As a kit (all 3 steps), $34 seems reasonable especially when you compare it to other products on the market. Overall, I liked this product. Of course, only time will tell (long term use) how this product really works. For slight to moderate acne, or the occasional breakout, it seems to work, but I am not sure if it will work for someone who has severe acne. My 16-year-old son suffers from (moderate) acne as well and I am going to let him try this product, as well as purchase the last two steps of this kit (spot treatment &amp; blemish clearing hydrator) so that he can experience the full treatment. If it works for him, and continues to work for me, I will update. Otherwise, I give this product 4.5 stars in terms of results, convenience, and price.</li>
    <li> I recently subbed this cleanser in for the face wash in my regular skin care routine, which was already pretty much keeping acne under control. I did not notice any difference in my skin after the switch; I take this to mean that the Benzac is doing the job, but not noticably out-performing the other wash I was already satisfied with. I&#x27;ve seen no irritation or drying with this product. I do like the foam pump of the Benzac, and I also like the scent pretty well. I&#x27;d say it reminds me most of grapefruit.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a vine customer and was only sent the foaming cleanser, not the spot treatment or hydrator so that&#x27;s all I can review on. The cleanser is nice. I&#x27;ve used similar products in the past that would leave my skin red and irritated, but the cleanser is pretty gentle and I had no problems with skin irritation presumably because it&#x27;s made with Salicylic Acid instead of peroxide. Much nicer to your skin. It seems to cleans, my face does feel cleaner and less oily but over all I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference in my complexion and I don&#x27;t have bad acne, just a few bad spots. Overall, I give it 3 stars.</li>
    <li> NOTE-  THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE FOAMING CLEANSER ONLY- NOT A KIT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our daughter has minor issues with light developing acne at 14 years old.  We found this product excellent in that regard and better than many of the other products in the same, or slightly higher, price range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The foaming cleanser dispenser works very well and evenly dispenses the product.  The foam is dense enough that it is easy to control during application, minimizing waste.  One pump pf the dispenser will wash an entire face.  The cleanser (soap) was not harsh at all on our daughters face, though she is not overly sensitive to begin with.  Unlike other products that utilize Benzoyl Peroxide, this product uses Salicylic Acid, known for not drying out your skin. However, Salicylic Acid is generally though of as being less effective than Peroxide so keep that in mind if you are dealing with serious acne issues.  The smell is &amp;#34;woody,&amp;#34; maybe Sandalwood and not too heavy.  It dissipates fairly quickly.  Overall results were noticeable within three days for us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you wear makeup (foundation), the makeup will need to be removed prior to using this product.  While the Benzac is great at cleaning her face, it did not work well for getting makeup off for obvious reasons.  We also noticed the Benzac did not stain clothing like many other acne products.  As a side note, even if you do not have acne, this cleanser may work for you if you have oily skin as is my case.  I found it cleaned very well.  However, if you do not have an oily face and are prone to dryness, it is probably best to stay away.</li>
    <li> This facial cleanser is pretty amazing....I got caught in the who &amp;#34;Pro-Active&amp;#34; diabolical scheme and since it never worked for me, I needed an new cleanser.  This one is really works in that it takes of all my makeup (even eye area) and have mild pleasant scent..  I would refer this to anyone who was looking for a new cleanser to try  This is an honest review because I don&#x27;t work for Mary Kay or Avon or any other cosmetic company for that.</li>
    <li> This is a really good daily cleanser for people with moderate breakouts.  The Benzac Skin Balancing Foaming Cleanser is easy to use and makes your face feel really clean afterwards.  Did experience a bit of dryness, but it is also winter so dry air could be a culprit, too.  Used this in conjunction with a different brand of facial moisturizer, but suspect this would be most effective when all their products are used together.</li>
    <li> It smells funny but if it works I can get past the aroma. However, I don&#x27;t feel it works.  It has sandalwood oil in it so maybe that&#x27;s the smell.  There is only .5% active ingredient so it doesn&#x27;t seem to really clear up acne prone skin. Salicylic acid is the active ingredient not Benzyl Peroxide.  Most products with salicylic acid are 2% active ingredient.&lt;br /&gt; It also felt oily going on. I was not happy with the product and after a weeks use I saw no noticeable difference.  I would not recommend if you&#x27;re concerned with keeping your acne in check.</li>
    <li> First off, I love the smell.  It&#x27;s kind of a light orange, but it doesn&#x27;t linger so I don&#x27;t have to smell it all day after washing my face in the morning.  As for the cleanser itself, it doesn&#x27;t foam much, but it does get my skin clean.  Unlike other acne cleansers, my face didn&#x27;t feel tight after using and I didn&#x27;t see any dry, flaky patches.  I also like the pump since that makes it easy to use in the shower.</li>
    <li> As someone who suffers from occasional outbreaks, I was eager to test this cleanser. The verdict: it works, but is a little too drying. I have very oily, resistant skin, so for my skin to feel slightly tight and dry after using this really says a lot. Still, this probably would make a great body wash on affected areas esp in the summertime when the dreaded &amp;#34;backacne&amp;#34; tends to rear it&#x27;s ugly head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a little disappointed, but will keep this nonetheless for summer use. Those with sensitive skin may want to steer clear of this.</li>
    <li> Works nice.  I tried using this nightly on just the left side of my face for several days, and I could feel a difference.  My skin felt smoother and looked a little better.  Easy to use pump lets you get out just the right amount.  It was gentle on the skin; using daily I didn&#x27;t see any redness.</li>
    <li> Amazing! This product works and works amazingly, it took only 12 hours for me to notice a change in my skin!</li>
    <li> I really liked this foaming cleanser. It definitely makes my skin feel clean and smooth and I like the light citrus scent (it&#x27;s made with Sandalwood  oil but smells like orange to me). It&#x27;s not too overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I embarrassingly admit to have two huge zits when I got this stuff, and it did seem to shrink them. As someone with naturally oily skin, I would continue using this product. I may even consider other Benzac products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have dryer skin, you may want to try it just once a day at first to make sure it doesn&#x27;t dry you out too much.</li>
    <li> I have to go right down the middle on my rating of this skin cleanser.  I used it twice.  I skipped a day in between.  It really burned my face when I put it on.  I scrubbed it off as quickly as I could.  I suffer from eczema on my face.  I&#x27;m not sure if this bothered me because of the eczema, the salicylic acid, the citric acid, orange peel, or grapefruit peel.  It made my face itch and my eczema flared up.  So, I will not be using it again.  I did love the foaming aspect of this cleanser.  It went on nice and smoothly.  Two pumps seemed sufficient to cleanse my whole face.  It&#x27;s not messy and the pump is great. It has a kind of lemon smell.  Fragrances break me out.  As it lists no fragrances, I thought this would not be an issue.  But still I&#x27;m unsure of which ingredient or ingredients caused my unpleasant reaction.  I would just be careful if you have sensitive skin. I really wanted to be able to use this cleanser.  Just wasn&#x27;t meant to be for me.</li>
    <li> I have had moderate acne for 25 years and at my age I still get flare-ups.  I have been on Accutane, Retin-A, Persagel and almost every product with Benzoyl Peroxide.  Nothing completely cures my acne but some do help.  This cleanser is good in that it didn&#x27;t cause a breakout  because it was a new product added to my facial regimen.  It didn&#x27;t really help either.  It is very gentle which may be good for some who do not have as serious of an acne problem as me.  It has a scent reminiscent of a citrus rind. The cleanser comes out in foam, but when applied it doesn&#x27;t lather well.  I am not sure if there are any cleansing properties in this formula because it does not remove oil/dirt/makeup very well.  This cleanser isn&#x27;t for me but will probably work on those with less acne prone skin.</li>
    <li> Been using this now for 2 weeks and it seems to work well.  No break outs and my skin has not dried out despite daily use of the product.  I recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of different soaps and creams over the years, but this is just really very gentle, in both feel and smell.&lt;br /&gt;It has a pleasant light orange smell which I&#x27;m assuming is the sandalwood oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, it rinses so very clean, as to leave no oil residue at all.&lt;br /&gt;This is just a really great product and has improved the look and feel of my skin.</li>
    <li> My wife often complains to me about my oily looking face, which sometimes resulting in breakouts and got me to use this balancing forming cleanser so that it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the fact that it doesn&#x27;t leave my face overly dry and having a tight-faced feeling. This could be a cleanser that I will use regularly to unclog my pores and exfoliate some of my white-heads which my wife absolutely detests.</li>
    <li> I was interested in trying this as I wash my face every night and I don’t always use the same product. However, I do see a dermatologist and use a cream over my face I sleep with but still wash prior to applying what my Doctor gave me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Salicylic Acid is the only active ingredient I can use on my face. I am allergic to Benzyl Peroxide so I was happy to see that was not used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right away I noticed the pump the works well. However, when I applied it to my face, it disappeared; I had to pump more. The one thing I did not like at all, it felt oily on my skin. I thought maybe it was my complexion that day. I have combination skin. It can be dry and oily. I used it a few other nights and the same results. Instead of having a squeaky clean feeling face, it literally felt greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know the active ingredient is only 0.5%, most products use 2%. I don’t know if it was because it was not strong enough or what, but I felt like I was applying oil to my face, not cleaning it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sadly would not recommend this and would not purchase it.</li>
    <li> The active ingredient is &amp;#34;Salicylic Acid&amp;#34;.  This is the same ingredient used by most popular skin blemish cleansers.</li>
    <li> Removes dirt and oil very well and has a nice orange scent. I really love the smell of orange, and i like that this doesn&#x27;t have a medicinal smell, but a nice refreshing one. It comes out in a nice light foam that i use with my facial scrubbing system. I notice my face looks oil free afterward. Some cleansers leave my face feeling tight, for whatever reason, but this one doesn&#x27;t leave that feeling. My skin has stayed clear and free of blemishes while using this. All in all, i can&#x27;t see any reason to not recommend this to others.</li>
    <li> I received this product through the amazon vine program. I am an adult but still have an occasional break out, nothing major though. My skin also can tend to be somewhat sensitive to some products.  I love the smell of this product, it smells like grapefruit.  This is a foaming cleanser, one pump is sufficient to wash your face.  It is  the same consistency as foaming hand soap.  It contains .5% Salicylic Acid and also states that it has calming and soothing East Indian Sandalwood Oil.  I found it to be a great cleanser.  After washing my face, I felt like my skin felt really clean and tight. I did not experience any drying or flaking effect with this.</li>
    <li> The product is okay - does not dry out too much, but keeps bacteria from sweat at bay, however was too foamy for me. Packaging is also not designed smartly. I keep it in my gym bag. The top always falls off and ends up being elsewhere, which sometimes can cause the product to leak from the tube.</li>
    <li> I had used a number of facial cleansers and soaps over the years for my occasional breakouts. Having tried this Benzac Skin Balancing Foaming Cleanser for two weeks, I have to say it&#x27;s one of the better ones out there. One pump seems to be sufficient for a single wash. The foam goes on  easy and rinses off without needing to scrub hard. It has a pleasant orangey scent (that&#x27;s how Indian sandalwood smells like?) that is neither overpowering nor lingering. It&#x27;s very gentle to the skin, especially around the eyes. It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin red or irritated like some other cleansers do. I does seem to dry up my skin a little though. I seem to have less breakouts in the past week, so I would think this product has something to do with it. Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> I have two teens in my household, now, and both are dealing with all the fun skin imperfections that come with the age. We have been trying many different soaps, cleansers and topical drying solutions, as of late. This one seems to be as effective or more effective than most. I HAVE been able to get my kids to put aside the soaps and shampoos with fragrances in them in exchange for more pure cleansers, and my wife and I are constantly on their cases about face-washing. This is a great product to have on-hand near the sink for the quick two-minute face-washing sessions that they have before and after school and before bed. If you haven&#x27;t found anything for your kids that you are satisfied with, you may want to give this product a try.</li>
    <li> This product has done neither harm nor good for my teen son. His acne has maybe improved a slight bit and we&#x27;ve seen no adverse effects to his skin, but his skin is by no means clear. Granted, getting him to use this on a regular basis has been a challenge, so that probably skews things. He doesn&#x27;t like the smell (and I&#x27;ve tried it--it does linger...) although he likes the foaminess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really think it&#x27;s something that will work for some people and not others, depending on skin type and sensitivity. It hasn&#x27;t impressed us enough to make me want to buy more when this bottle is gone.</li>
    <li> The simplicity of this product (and this entire system) is truly impressive. Foremost, it rinses super easy (effortlessly) and cleanly. Moreover, when used as directed, this bottle should last you a little while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, do use this with the entire system (the hydrator and the spot treatment). All elements of the collection are affordable (they are moderately priced) and they work best as a collection (but do be very careful ... if used over-zealously at first, they can cause drying and redness. So, take it so and then increase frequently incrementally).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do know that overall result are not immediate. Like any regime, please be patient and use it as directed. If after being full devoted to the kit after six months, you should consider trying another program or consulting your physician.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this is not a prescription strength solution, it is entirely appropriate for typical teen issues.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cleanser and the [[ASIN:B00ON1VGZK Benzac clearing hydrator]] at the same time, once a day.  Both products feel nice to use but smell mildly unpleasant.  There are no added fragrances, so the problem is one or more of the ingredients.  Even though both have only 0.5% salicylic acid (which I&#x27;ve used before with no problems), my skin is drying out to the point of being uncomfortable.  Since I have very oily skin, this is a surprise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the same time there is no improvement in my skin that I can see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m hoping I haven&#x27;t given it enough time, and I&#x27;ll be adding another moisturizer and continuing to use both products once a day.  But my skin is notoriously difficult.  Anyone who has skin that is easier to manage may have better luck with this cleanser.</li>
    <li> Like many people I&#x27;ve struggled with oily skin my entire life.  The oil traps dirt, clogs your pores and ultimately gives you acne.  Fun stuff.  As a teenager I suffered the worst of it.  Now, as an adult it&#x27;s manageable but still an annoyance.  That being said I&#x27;m always on the lookout for different morning facial washes to use in the shower.  I&#x27;ve never tried Benzac products so I was more than happy to give Benzac Skin Balancing Foaming Cleanser, 6 Ounce a try.  Here are my thoughts;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Applies gently to your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Sensitive formula doesn&#x27;t irritate skin (however be careful using it immediately after shaving).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Free of sulfates, artificial fragrances and dyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Pleasant Indian sandalwood oil scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering and doesn&#x27;t linger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Foaming cleanser is easier to get into your eyes than a gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Cap design can collect and retains water in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- .5% Salicylic Acid didn&#x27;t really do much for my oily skin.  After 1-2 hours my face was oily again.  No different than any other facial cleanser I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Benzac Skin Balancing Foaming Cleanser, 6 Ounce was a nice change of pace in my daily facial cleansing routine.  I didn&#x27;t really see any noticeable change in my complexion after using it daily (sometimes twice) for a month, but I can say that about most facial cleansers.  Would I use it again?  Probably not.  However, I really enjoyed the light sandalwood scent and it was even better that it didn&#x27;t linger after washing like many other facial cleansers I&#x27;ve used.  Even though I wouldn&#x27;t buy this exact cleanser again I would definitely give other Benzac products a try.</li>
    <li> Having had adult acne for a number of years, I am still looking for a product that works well.  Using the Benzac foaming cleanser twice a day left my skin slightly more sensitive to touch, but it has worked to reduce the breakout intensity and length. A more comprehensive system will likely be needed for total control, however.</li>
    <li> I used this twice and my face felt good for awhile after using it but both times my skin felt super dry after and I had to use moisturizer to make my face feel better</li>
    <li> Benzac Skin Balancing Foaming Cleanser is the first product I have ever tried from Benzac and I have to say how impressed I am with it. Goes on very easily, just 1 pump and apply, and also comes off very simply without a lot of scrubbing. Leaves my skin feeling very clean and soft, plus is gentle around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin and tend to break out when I try new products but this cleanser from Benzac does not only work really well but I have noticed a decrease in red spots and acne. I have been using this for the last few weeks and my face is clearer and has a healthy glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For what this product can do and how well it works I have to recommended this product. The only down side is how expensive it is but I  can justify the price with how well it works. Plus my thinking when it comes to skin care: If it works well price doesn&#x27;t matter since it is your face</li>
