      <li>I was very hesitant on getting this, but I&#x27;m so happy I did.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if this is an authentic Beauty Blender.</li>
      <li>I found out the best to wash these is using the Beautyblender Solid soap.</li>
      <li>I love this sponge.</li>

      <li>I used to use a cheap one from target</li>
      <li>love this applicator, soft to the touch blends nicely</li>
      <li>I first purchased a BB from birchbox after discovering it there, but then discovered that Amazon had much better deals on them.</li>
      <li>My make up goes on much more smoothly and looks more natural.</li>
      <li>Once you clean the sponge put the sponge in a bowl of water (about 1 inch) and put in microwave for 50 seconds to kill bacteria.</li>

      <li>This was a gift for my sister  because  i love mine so much.</li>
      <li>super</li>
      <li>Thank you so much!!</li>
      <li>It applies my liquid foundation very evenly and smoothly.</li>
      <li>I like to spray it with some water and then apply for a more natural finish.</li>
      <li>Super fast shipping!</li>
      <li>I received my product fast and this is the original beauty blender, leaves my makeup on point</li>
      <li>I have tried using this with both my BB cream and my regular foundation, and I LOVE it for both.</li>
      <li>This BB is exactly like the first one I purchased on birchbox, so no doubt about the authenticity of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;I am very big into makeup and happen to own 3 other Beauty Blenders bought from sephora, this one was at a better price</li>
      <li>At first I thought it was just blush, but i don&#x27;t use THAT much blush for the water to become pepto</li>
      <li>This is the real Beauty Blender and amazingly cheaper than the other ones.</li>
      <li>I had tired using Dawn, hand soap and my shampoos because I really did not want to buy a special soap to clean it, but I am glad I did</li>
      <li>Works really well.</li>
      <li>Not the real one at all.</li>
      <li>Real.</li>
      <li>THIS IS NOT THE REAL BEAUTY BLENDER</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t have to use as much.</li>
      <li>Shipping came faster then it said and is very efficient.</li>
      <li>and I read reviews saying it was real.</li>
      <li>And yes the pink dye does wash out with any soap you use and over time it will fade to a light</li>
      <li>First of all, I didn&#x27;t have any problems with questioning the authenticity of this product; it is definitely the real deal.</li>
      <li>It is truly worth the money and definitely lives up to its hype.</li>
      <li>Looks like original and good BUT size it is NOT full size... very small.</li>
      <li>It comes with a little cleansing soap and the original package!</li>
      <li>Returned this one and ordered a new one.</li>
      <li>Very soft, after wetting and wringing out the water for moisture.</li>
      <li>I never write reviews unless the product is terrible or amazing, and I absolutely love my Beauty Blender!!</li>
      <li>Ordered two initially and the first one is holding up well from what she says.</li>
      <li>Still not sure if it works better than the dupes.</li>
      <li>This was after the first initial wash that i noticed it.</li>
      <li>I also use it to clean my other makeup brushes (</li>
      <li>it is certainly the real thing but the package came crushed.</li>
      <li>Im in the early learning stages of applying makeup professionally and the &amp;#34;COPYCATS&amp;#34; do not compare to the natural application of foundation.</li>
      <li>Do NOT waste your money.</li>
      <li>I have the real Beauty Blenders and they are not the same.</li>
      <li>Shipping was very fast, arrived way before expected.</li>
      <li>I will definitely purchase this again and highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I realize it&#x27;s not cheap, but it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
      <li>My wife used and less than two weeks later and washing it once gently</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This works so beautifully! glad I purchased it.</li>
    <li> GREAT TOOL!  LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> super it is the real thing , I love it, I would buy it again</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this! I use it every day to apply my concealer in the very delicate under eye areas. It&#x27;s soft and works extremely well. I will definitely purchase this again and highly recommend it. The price is the best I have found.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with these blend your makeup so well</li>
    <li> I have the black beauty blender &amp; it&#x27;s way softer</li>
    <li> A must have, I love my beauty blender.</li>
    <li> Gave as a gift. Well received</li>
    <li> My wife used and less than two weeks later and washing it once gently it started to break down. Pictured enclosed. Returned this one and ordered a new one. Ordered two initially and the first one is holding up well from what she says.</li>
    <li> I never write reviews unless the product is terrible or amazing, and I absolutely love my Beauty Blender!! Shipping came faster then it said and is very efficient. This is the real Beauty Blender and amazingly cheaper than the other ones. Works amazingly! I definitely recommend this!</li>
    <li> This product will change the way you use foundation!! And you will be amazed at how much less product you need to use and the amount of coverage you will get!! Can not say how much I love my BEAUTY BLENDER!!!!</li>
    <li> it is certainly the real thing but the package came crushed.</li>
    <li> I am OBSESSED with the beauty blender! First of all, I didn&#x27;t have any problems with questioning the authenticity of this product; it is definitely the real deal. I first purchased a BB from birchbox after discovering it there, but then discovered that Amazon had much better deals on them. This BB is exactly like the first one I purchased on birchbox, so no doubt about the authenticity of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, my makeup goes on like a dream! I have tried using this with both my BB cream and my regular foundation, and I LOVE it for both. It&#x27;s as if I&#x27;ve had my makeup airbrushed on. I also have that beautiful, dewy look that comes with airbrush makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was such a skeptic of this product for SO long. I was the girl saying I would NEVER pay this amount of money for a SPONGE. A sponge? Not happening. However, after reading so many great reviews on the product, I gave in, and I will NEVER go back to cheap sponges or to applying makeup with my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does get a little annoying to have to clean the beauty blender after each application, but that&#x27;s the only way to ensure that you are getting it properly clean and ready for your next makeup application.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my makeup blending needs. Was smaller than I expected though.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is an authentic Beauty Blender. I noticed from the moment I recieved it that the packaging was very different.</li>
    <li> Not what i expected doesn&#x27;t blend well</li>
    <li> This is a FAKE beauty blender. This is a totally different texture and feel... Not the real one at all. Do NOT waste your money.</li>
    <li> Please don&#x27;t by this worst mistake I&#x27;ve ever made. It&#x27;s terrible F A K E  does not even deserve 1 star</li>
    <li> I gave this to my sister.  I compared this with the one I bought from sephora and it is not the same.  The one from sephora is softer than this.</li>
    <li> This is not a real beauty blender. I would like a refund.</li>
    <li> This is not original. it is not a real beauty blender. I would like a refund.&lt;br /&gt;Smaller than expected and not a nice feel to it. Harsh on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Please don&#x27;t by this worst mistake I&#x27;ve ever made. It&#x27;s terrible F A K E does not even deserve 1 star&lt;br /&gt;I am very big into makeup and happen to own 3 other Beauty Blenders bought from sephora, this one was at a better price and I read reviews saying it was real. THIS IS NOT THE REAL BEAUTY BLENDER I PROMISE YOU. This is completely fake and when wet it doesn&#x27;t grow in size like it&#x27;s supposed too. I am so disappointed and FURIOUS!!!!!! Never again will I buy from this fraud company.</li>
    <li> Love love love this with almost all of my foundations! I like to spray it with some water and then apply for a more natural finish. Definitely lives up to the name (:</li>
    <li> Love this product...it&#x27;s amazing...</li>
    <li> I love this sponge. I have been using them for a year now and I don&#x27;t think I would apply my foundation any other way. I found out the best to wash these is using the Beautyblender Solid soap. I had tired using Dawn, hand soap and my shampoos because I really did not want to buy a special soap to clean it, but I am glad I did it works amazingly! I also use it to clean my other makeup brushes (And yes the pink dye does wash out with any soap you use and over time it will fade to a light pink).&lt;br /&gt;I wash mine once a week and I also found a tutorial on YouTube on how to wash. Once you clean the sponge put the sponge in a bowl of water (about 1 inch) and put in microwave for 50 seconds to kill bacteria. FYI the sponge and water will be very, very warm so be careful. Squeeze out the excess water and let air dry.&lt;br /&gt; I change out my sponge about every 3-6 months depending on how it&#x27;s holding up.  Hopefully this review helps</li>
    <li> Great product, needed better shipping care.</li>
    <li> FAKE! Package was cut open and Beauty Blender was replaced with a fake. Rip off!</li>
    <li> Tgis product is NOT a real beauty blender its so small and hard it doesnt blend out my makeup at all its not worth the the money i will never repurchase from this seller again</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that this was a small beauty blender I was expecting a normal sized one for the ridiculous price I paid! Not very happy!</li>
    <li> Looks like original and good BUT size it is NOT full size... very small. Not as shown in some pictures....</li>
    <li> Have one from inglot too, but this one i like better. Softer and better coverage.</li>
    <li> I love this !! It is worth any price and significantly better than most sponges.</li>
    <li> Awesome product.  Helps produce a flawless finish.</li>
    <li> VERY small...not what i thought i was getting</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe I waited so long to buy one of these. AMAZING. Every girl should try one.</li>
    <li> I was very hesitant on getting this, but I&#x27;m so happy I did. I&#x27;ve seen so many of my friends use this and wanted to give it a shot. I&#x27;m telling you, you need this in your life. This is so amazing. My foundation goes on perfectly and so does my highlighter and concealer. I used to use a cheap one from target and I would always see my foundation crease near my mouth and under my eyes, but that not longer happens to me due to the beauty blender. I know buying it is a little scary because of the price, but it could also be scary because who knows if its authentic or not, but this is 100% authentic. It comes with a little cleansing soap and the original package! Get it!</li>
    <li> I received my product fast and this is the original beauty blender, leaves my makeup on point so well that it looks like my skin is flawless and believe me my skin is far from that so I recommend anyone looking to try the beauty blender try it you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> I will never apply my foundation any other way. This beauty blender is perfection and gives the illusion of flawless-looking skin. A must for anyone&#x27;s makeup arsenal.</li>
    <li> Shipping was very fast, arrived way before expected. This product is AMAZING! Love the finish of the foundation with this sponge! A MUST HAVE for all you makeup lovers!</li>
    <li> This little sponge is A -MAZING! It allows me to apply my foundation with ease and I don&#x27;t have to use as much. It blends in my contouring colors beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative (which i don&#x27;t really see as a negative) is that after a few washes ( i use the beauty blender bar soap), the pink starts washing out too. At first I thought it was just blush, but i don&#x27;t use THAT much blush for the water to become pepto pink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had it for about 3 months, and it still works flawlessly. The only odd thing was that there is a small tear in it, and in that tear is a rust looking color. This was after the first initial wash that i noticed it. It wasn&#x27;t from my foundation because I hadn&#x27;t used that portion of the sponge yet. I&#x27;ll post a picture of it when I get home. I still use it, but just wanted to let others know just in case they have it too.</li>
    <li> My make up goes on much more smoothly and looks more natural.</li>
    <li> The owner was really nice and rushed my order when I asked!! Thank you so much!!</li>
    <li> This device has changed the way I apply my makeup. It applies my liquid foundation very evenly and smoothly. Very easy to clean. Very soft, after wetting and wringing out the water for moisture. Im in the early learning stages of applying makeup professionally and the &amp;#34;COPYCATS&amp;#34; do not compare to the natural application of foundation. Oh yes it was much more affordable purchasing through my favorite &amp;#34;Amazon&amp;#34;! I did compare prices and will be reordering!</li>
    <li> I love this product. Its a great alternative for a makeup brush and easy and fast to apply makeup and clean off makeup.</li>
    <li> love this applicator, soft to the touch blends nicely</li>
    <li> I never buy products online, so for me to write a review is a big deal. To me at least haha. Anyway. I have horrible skin. Red and blotchy with the occasional breakout. I&#x27;ve always had a hard time with makeup coverage. With the beauty blender I was able to apply primer, concealer, foundation, blush, powder, and even eyeshadow. It is truly worth the money and definitely lives up to its hype. Just yesterday I bought the two pack with the cleanser. Ten for ten would buy again. And have!</li>
    <li> Do NOT buy this product! They are all fake beauty blenders! I have the real Beauty Blenders and they are not the same. Either in shape not texture!!!</li>
    <li> This particular sponge is smaller than my previous &amp;#34;original Beautyblender.&amp;#34; The description should include measurements as it was a bit misleading.</li>
    <li> Real. Still not sure if it works better than the dupes. It all feels the same. Don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll buy another but I&#x27;m def using this one till its done for,</li>
    <li> Works really well. smells great, feels great!</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my sister  because  i love mine so much. Blends beautifully!</li>
    <li> Very good love it your foundation looks great after applying with the beauty blender!</li>
    <li> I will never put makeup on without this again! Super fast shipping!</li>
    <li> I am such a believer in the BeautyBlender. I realize it&#x27;s not cheap, but it&#x27;s worth every penny. My makeup always looks very natural, and flawless. If you want to see how to use it before you purchase, check out Kandee Johnson&#x27;s video on YouTube. She raves about this applicator.</li>
    <li> I love this.  It helps me get incredible coverage.</li>
    <li> DEFINETLY smaller then I thought it would be .</li>
    <li> Smaller than expected and not a nice feel to it. Harsh on the skin.</li>
