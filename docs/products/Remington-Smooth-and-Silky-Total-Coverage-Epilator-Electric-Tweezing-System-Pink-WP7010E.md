### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>After struggling with hair removal for years i can say this worked out the best.</li>
      <li>The very best was to use it</li>
      <li>Otherwise, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
      <li>] it does an acceptable job, but not the best.</li>
      <li>I just used this product and it worked perfectly.  </li>
      <li>: the EP7010 has two speeds; it is best to stick to the lower speed for underarms.</li>
      <li>and i must say, its great!</li>
      <li>Instructions say that you get the best results if the hair to be plucked is between 0.05 and 0.2&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>It worked especially great for underarms.</li>
      <li>I have had it for two months now and is still working great.</li>
      <li>Not having to shave my legs every 4-5 days makes me happy.</li>
      <li>…yet my daughter was happy to try it.  </li>
      <li>it is very effective at removal.</li>
      <li>The feedback I’ve gotten is that this unit pinches the skin at times and “isn’t very effective.”  </li>
      <li>The Epilator has two speeds which Is good.  </li>
      <li>I do have a problem with the epilator though as it does not do a good job of pulling the hair out correctly.</li>
      <li>cord itself is a good thing in that</li>
      <li>epilator itself does not come with any kind of storage pouch and the supplied cleaning brush will be lost unless you find a good place for it.  </li>
      <li>I followed the directions and used circular motions and discovered that it worked amazingly well.</li>
      <li>My underarms, however, it works amazingly well.  </li>
      <li>the warning, use your money elsewhere...if you&#x27;re into pain, there are still cheaper ways to obtain it (try repeatedly slamming your fingers in a door, or catching your hair in a fan).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Excellent, really recommend it.</li>
      <li>So I&#x27;m kind of an epilation convert.  </li>
      <li>The Remington epilator is a handy device, even for men.  </li>
      <li>but once you get used to it, it&#x27;s a nice device to have around the house.&lt;br /&gt;Less</li>
      <li>But lets be honest girls, you can&#x27;t tell me dancing all night in 4 inch heels is comfy</li>
      <li>But hey, look, my knee sure does look a lot better with that hair gone!  </li>
      <li>For the record, the best epilator I’ve used to date is the Philips Hp6520/70 Satin Soft Cordless Epilator.</li>
      <li>I figured it would be just as effective and easy to use.&lt;br</li>
      <li>IT BETTER THEN</li>
      <li>If I had a lot more hair it would probably hurt more but for me it was virtually painless.</li>
      <li>this helps a lot, now I no longer shave and I love it</li>
      <li>Leg use seemed to be better than underarm use.  </li>
      <li>What I have found with this one is that it misses too many hairs</li>
      <li>I had to use it again after 3 weeks, which I&#x27;m sure if you have darker hair than I do, you&#x27;d want to use it before that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>the price of this product (or perhaps a bit more)</li>
      <li>glad I got it</li>
      <li>, you could buy a better product (like the Braun Silk Epil 5 or Epil 7, which I&#x27;ve both reviewed).</li>
      <li>I love it a lot.</li>
      <li>i can&#x27;t take it most times.</li>
      <li>So I kept dabbing, and before I knew it, I&#x27;d mostly done both of my knees.&lt;br</li>
      <li>LOVE it, so</li>
      <li>I feel like I will need to shave them on top of using the epilator which is what I was trying to avoid.</li>
      <li>shaving more Remington hair removing...</li>
      <li>Well, let me just start by saying there are way better quality Epilators out there than this one.</li>
      <li>The cap makes me hold it at an angle to make it more efficient.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve owned many models over the years and the Remington is just the latest.</li>
      <li>but you will get use to it and you will be glad you did.  </li>
      <li>I really love this item.</li>
      <li>Also there are &amp;#34;areas&amp;#34; that i absolutely haven&#x27;t been able to use it on but for the legs it&#x27;s great.  </li>
      <li>Not any better than using a razor blade.</li>
      <li>You can give it a try if you want, might work better on you than it did on me, all</li>
      <li>This is a good first</li>
      <li>I really love them because they keep your legs or underarms free from hair for weeks.  </li>
      <li>Worked a little better for me when I took the protective head-cap off; suspect that&#x27;s not the best answer.  </li>
      <li>fair quality for the price, but as far as quality is concerned, there are better epilators out there.</li>
      <li>accessories for better results in special areas (underarms, face, etc.).&lt;br /&gt;*Corded</li>
      <li>OKAY NOT BAD...</li>
      <li>It could be a hair texture issue (I have fine hair on my legs and arms).</li>
      <li>I use this product only for underarms, as I have not been able to use it successfully anywhere else.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve quickly gone from thinking I could never epilate to wanting a better device.  </li>
      <li>it is fine and light.</li>
      <li>A huge amount of hair grows into skin,and then it is so itchy.</li>
      <li>I am a huge fan of epilators.</li>
      <li>so I decided to try anything and everything available to me at home.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s easy to clean.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s easy to clean.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It is easy to clean and is corded so no need for batteries.</li>
      <li>Skin is not silky and smooth.</li>
      <li>smooth  </li>
      <li>simply didn&#x27;t get great results with this unit.  </li>
      <li>men, it is also a great hair remover for some hair on your back and shoulder.</li>
      <li>My legs are not as smooth in some spots, as some reviewers have claimed.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also easy to clean and comes with a cleaning brush.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Quick, easy, and comparatively painless (with time).  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been wanting to try an epilator since they first came out many years ago.  </li>
      <li>The hot tub involved wine though, so not one of my most scientific experiments.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The original epilator I received appeared &amp;#34;dead on arrival&amp;#34;, in order to write a unbiased review - I called and explained the situation</li>
      <li>Worth the purchase!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s so worth it!</li>
      <li>but considering my past experiences i must say this has been the best of all.</li>
      <li>I can catch more hairs on the first pass.</li>
      <li>I lost my cleaning brush to it and have been using my makeup brush to clean it since.</li>
      <li>Its easy clean up when it comes to this device and its easy handling, I just didn&#x27;t seem to get the desired results therefore i won&#x27;t be using this much.</li>
      <li>This was a big inconvenience for me, but I guess others might think it a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
      <li>I like to be all nice and soft all over.  </li>
      <li>found this Epilator to work good for having only 40 tweezers.  </li>
      <li>but that is true for any hair removal process.</li>
      <li>so it does a good enough</li>
      <li>Sweet, fancy Moses</li>
      <li>This is a good basic epilator.</li>
      <li>Slow is best for finer hair.  </li>
      <li>On the lowest speed, it&#x27;s very fast working, and got most hairs on the first pass.</li>
      <li>It also took forever to adequately cover any</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s quick and easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>really liked that I was still relatively smooth the next day, unlike with shaving, when I&#x27;m already a porcupine almost as soon as I get out of the shower.  </li>
      <li>I am now investing in a higher end epilator, but this one definitely was a great choice for first time use.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t expect much from the EP7010, which is why I was amazed at how easy it is to use, and how quickly it does the job.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, this Remington seems like a decent product at a good price point, but if you have a lower pain threshold or really want a very close \\&quot;shave,\\</li>
      <li>So saying, on to the Remington Products EP7010 Smooth and Silky Essential Epilator; just be aware that your own mileage will probably vary.&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Miserable to use. Ouch! Had to be plugged in so can&#x27;t even use in shower when skin is hot And pores open.</li>
    <li> Pains only the first time, Which is also the case with waxing. But extremely useful, quick and non messy way of hair removal. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> it was not what i expected and it is too noisy</li>
    <li> This product too was amzing and di what it was suppose to do, i would recommend it to those, like me who have problem with facial hair, i,ve been looking for something like this for yrs, thanks again to my now Partners when i need a product.</li>
    <li> I am new to epilators and wanted to try them out first before committing to one. I bought this epilator at a local store for under $40. I have to say I don&#x27;t like it. I expected it to be painful, which it is. The pain is manageable and doesn&#x27;t last. I do have a problem with the epilator though as it does not do a good job of pulling the hair out correctly. It cuts them and then can&#x27;t pull them. My legs are not as smooth in some spots, as some reviewers have claimed. I feel like I will need to shave them on top of using the epilator which is what I was trying to avoid. I also have red dots on my legs which I think will go away overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend buying a different epilator.</li>
    <li> Stopped working after one month</li>
    <li> Excellent, really recommend it.</li>
    <li> I really love this item. I live in an area where bikini waxes are not available and was tired of trying to do it by my self so I decided to try anything and everything available to me at home. Yes, it HURTS at first. I started by taking four ibuprofen to lessen the impact but the initial pain is almost unbearable. I followed the directions and used circular motions and discovered that it worked amazingly well. As it progressed my nerves ending seemed to become desensitized and it hardly hurt at all although I recommend slowly easing into the next area to extend the numbness gradually.I removed hair from the entire bikini area and it took about 30 minutes the first time now I just touch up once a week. The hair grows back slowly and is soft because it was plucked rather than shaved. No stubble at all. I follow up with a tree oil made for putting on your face to reduce the inflammation; it takes about 1-2 days to calm down but that is less time than a wax job.  You do have to watch for ingrown hairs but that is true for any hair removal process.</li>
    <li> First and foremost, I want to commend Remington on their customer service. The original epilator I received appeared &amp;#34;dead on arrival&amp;#34;, in order to write a unbiased review - I called and explained the situation and they promptly mailed out another.  It ended up being the cable that was DOA, the epilator was fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway - this thing is pure torture. It has two speeds: &#x27;insane pain&#x27; and &#x27;slow insane pain&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Insane pain makes you aware of what a beast you are because it awkwardly relieves your legs of hair in the most torturous way possible, and missing just enough that you realize in order to actually use it to remove hair you have to go over the same area 1000x.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Slow insane pain is a lot like &#x27;Insane pain&#x27; but it takes twice as long, and you feel it twice as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this product fails from a bad design, and the tweezers are at an angle that make it an unnatural position to rip out your hairs from the root. Some it just annihilates, others it tears out in the most painful fashion possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, it would be less painful to use lukewarm wax and a poorly trained orangutan wielding the tear strips than to use this device on a regular for hair removal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heed the warning, use your money elsewhere...if you&#x27;re into pain, there are still cheaper ways to obtain it (try repeatedly slamming your fingers in a door, or catching your hair in a fan).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No. Just no.</li>
    <li> I had dark hairs and even after I would shave, you could see black dots, you could see the roots. This has really fixed that problem, thank God. I bought this epilator from a local CVS for nearly $50. I have had it for two months now and is still working great. I lost my cleaning brush to it and have been using my makeup brush to clean it since. I have been wanting to buy a replacement cleaning brush but they don&#x27;t sell those individually, sadly. It is pain but I have gotten use to it. The purpose of this product is to remove hair, not necessarily painlessly. So this does the job. I love it a lot.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great hair remover for ladies especially if you are tired for waxing your legs.&lt;br /&gt;For men, it is also a great hair remover for some hair on your back and shoulder. You might need someone to help you remove your back hair...&lt;br /&gt;It is painful at first but once you get used to it, it&#x27;s a nice device to have around the house.&lt;br /&gt;Less shaving more Remington hair removing... I would recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I have tried and used a lot of different epilators.  I really love them because they keep your legs or underarms free from hair for weeks.  When the hair grows in it is soft not stubble.  They are all I use now.  If you are thinking of epilating please give it a try.  It will pinch at first but you will get use to it and you will be glad you did.  This is a good first Epilator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this Epilator to work good for having only 40 tweezers.  It took more times going over the same spot to remove all the hair.  The Epilator has two speeds which Is good.  Also I like the lip this Epilator has.  I think it raises the hair and makes them easier to remove.  I would recommend this Epilator especially if it is your first.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to try an epilator since they first came out many years ago.  All the reports of pain stopped me from getting one every time I thought about it.  But, hey, how painful can it be?  Well, I&#x27;m here to report that it can be pretty painful.  I can only do a small area of one leg each time I use this Remington.  Then, I shave the rest of the leg.  But I figure if I keep doing things that way, all areas of my legs will eventually be epilated. (Is that a word?)  I was surprised, too, how well this Remington worked,  On the lowest speed, it&#x27;s very fast working, and got most hairs on the first pass. It&#x27;s also much less expensive than many of the other brands of epilators.</li>
    <li> Instructions say that you get the best results if the hair to be plucked is between 0.05 and 0.2&amp;#34;.  Hum.  I have a pretty casual approach to leg hair; more like, &amp;#34;when is my next massage?&amp;#34; than &amp;#34;oh, my, the hair is going to be too long to remove...&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I simply didn&#x27;t get great results with this unit.  Worked a little better for me when I took the protective head-cap off; suspect that&#x27;s not the best answer.  With the head cap on, the curvature of my parts meant that I wasn&#x27;t getting much contact with the tweezers.  YMMV.</li>
    <li> This is my fourth epilator and my least favorite.  I’ve always used Philips brand in the past, so I thought I’d give a different brand a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Corded, so you never run into a situation where the device is dead.&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn’t catch the skin like some other models&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn’t remove hair as well as other models/manufacturers&lt;br /&gt;- Painful (and I realize all epilators hurt some, but this one wanted to grab hairs and pull instead of pulling them out on the first pass which made it much more painful than others)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of the day, I ended up pulling out my older Philips epilator to finish the job.  This one just wasn’t up to the job.  For the record, the best epilator I’ve used to date is the Philips Hp6520/70 Satin Soft Cordless Epilator.</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of epilators. I&#x27;ve owned many models over the years and the Remington is just the latest. Compared to the last epilator, it works much better. I can catch more hairs on the first pass. The cap makes me hold it at an angle to make it more efficient. This design truly is effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback I&#x27;ve run into is the lack of an LED light to illuminate the work area. Otherwise, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Cheap (for an epilator), and at the current price of $35, it&#x27;s the same as the local big-box.&lt;br /&gt;*Simple, no pieces to lose.&lt;br /&gt;*Corded, so you don&#x27;t have the battery running out in the middle of the job.&lt;br /&gt;*Pretty color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Cannot grab shorter hairs that some other models can (must be at least 2mm).&lt;br /&gt;*No accessories for better results in special areas (underarms, face, etc.).&lt;br /&gt;*Corded (yes, this is both a pro and a con).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first tried an epilator about 15 years ago.  As I recall, it was very similar to the design of this Remington.  I tried it and instantly knew THERE IS NO WAY.  Sweet, fancy Moses it hurt!  I dabbed at my legs with it a few more times, and I just couldn&#x27;t handle it.  I sold that epilator to my older sister, and I was surprised that she liked it and used it.  Tougher than me, I figured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I really hate shaving, so I decided to give epilation another try.  I dabbed this Remington against my knee (my hairiest area), and nearly screamed in pain.  But my teenage daughter was watching me (she was considering trying it herself), so I tried to act like it wasn&#x27;t that bad.  But let me tell you, it really, really, REALLY hurts.  It doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;pinch\\&quot; a little or \\&quot;tingle\\&quot; or \\&quot;sting\\&quot; or \\&quot;prick.\\&quot;  It feels like you are being STABBED by tiny little knives (not needles, KNIVES) over and over again.  But hey, look, my knee sure does look a lot better with that hair gone!  So I kept dabbing, and before I knew it, I&#x27;d mostly done both of my knees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next day, I went after my legs again.  I found that it helps to kind of dab at an area lightly over and over again until it doesn&#x27;t hurt so much, then apply the epilator more firmly, then start moving around in a very small circle, only adding TINY new sections once the current section no longer hurts.  By doing it this way, it was manageable (but still INCREDIBLY painful).  After doing all this, I read that, as a new epilator,it&#x27;s better for you to wax your legs first (seriously, that hurts much less), and then as THAT hair starts to grow back, start epilating.  This way, you will be pulling out far fewer hairs as you begin epilating.  And then, if you keep up with it, you will never again have as many hairs currently poking out, so it will never again be as painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really liked that I was still relatively smooth the next day, unlike with shaving, when I&#x27;m already a porcupine almost as soon as I get out of the shower.  So I&#x27;m kind of an epilation convert.  I suspect that I was able to handle it this time because (1), since my first experience with epilation, I&#x27;ve given birth (after that, ANYTHING seems less painful), (2) I&#x27;ve done some home laser hair removal, which didn&#x27;t work great, but I think it worked a little, so I might have a bit less hair that&#x27;s being pulled out all at once, and (3) I&#x27;m a lot older, and as you get older, the one nice thing is that (as my older sisters tell me), the hair on your legs gets less dense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;ve been trying to remove new growth (or possibly the stubble of hairs that didn&#x27;t actually get plucked out cleanly, but were just broken off), and I&#x27;m a little disappointed with the results.  I run this Remington over and over my legs, and it&#x27;s not plucking anything new (I can tell by the lack of pain), but I&#x27;m pretty stubbly.  I could get away with wearing shorts, but my husband is going to be out of luck when he touches my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;ve quickly gone from thinking I could never epilate to wanting a better device.  I&#x27;m thinking about the [[ASIN:B0077PLNNE Braun Silk-épil Wet and Dry Epilator]], since they claim to get hairs at short as .5mm (one-fourth the length that this Remington gets!), but at nearly three times the price, it BETTER be a lot better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this Remington seems like a decent product at a good price point, but if you have a lower pain threshold or really want a very close \\&quot;shave,\\&quot; you might bebetter with a different model.</li>
    <li> This is a big improvement on the old Epilady I once had.  Minimal pain/discomfort to me. It has a tweezer drum that spins either fast or slow. Slow is best for finer hair.  It looks to me like not all the hair is pulled out by the roots, some looks broken off. My legs felt rather stubbly at first, but with continued use they are getting smoother. I have to make myself be patient while using it so it does a good enough job.&lt;br /&gt;I also learned to be very careful going over bony places like shins and knee caps because the metal \\&quot;tweezers\\&quot; can scrape them even to the point of drawing a little blood. But all in all I&#x27;d rather do this than shave every day or two.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE - two months into it, am still using it. I keep hoping my legs will end up silk smooth  but so far they continue to feel stubbly and bumpy. I end up using it at least once a week to keep the growth down. I find it helpful to use a flashlight that I shine across the skin to show up my fine pale hair,  and I like to rub my legs with witch hazel after using it.</li>
    <li> I use this product only for underarms, as I have not been able to use it successfully anywhere else.  When attempting to epilate my legs, I found that this product would only cut the hair, not pull it out from the roots.  The same with the arms.  It also left red splotches/small cuts.  My underarms, however, it works amazingly well.  It could be a hair texture issue (I have fine hair on my legs and arms).</li>
    <li> This is the first epilator I&#x27;ve owned and used. The pain is annoying. I found this machine misses a lot of hairs so I&#x27;m going over the same area several times. I&#x27;ve read other reviews and that isn&#x27;t the norm for other machines. It doesn&#x27;t come with a storage pouch and I&#x27;ve already misplaced the little brush. I&#x27;ll keep use this on my legs and I look forward to when it doesn&#x27;t hurt anymore as is the case with longtime users.</li>
    <li> I think when it comes to epilators there are two sides; those who swear by them and those who loathe them. I could live without mine, but not by choice.  I admit the first use may be a bit shocking, painful and could very well leave you wondering why did I just willingly do that?!  But as someone that has been using the [[ASIN:B004TGUKG0 Braun Silk Epil 7 Wet &amp; Dry Epilator]] for 3+ years I no longer experience any of the above. I now only use my epilator every other week and truthfully there is minimal hair now so it&#x27;s quick and easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the [[ASIN:B00CX9EXOA Remington Smooth and Silky Essential Epilator]] it does an acceptable job, but not the best. I do like that it can be used plugged in, as my other one doesn&#x27;t allow that so if the battery is dead I have to wait.  What I have found with this one is that it misses too many hairs so you end up spending more time than necessary going over the same areas, but it does work. Now like I said epilating is most definitely not for everyone, but if you prefer it and need a replacement this one isn&#x27;t too bad.</li>
    <li> I got this for my daughter who wanted to purchase one of those expensive light based units off an infomercial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I opened the box and saw this epilator, my first thought was “medieval torture device?”…yet my daughter was happy to try it.  The feedback I’ve gotten is that this unit pinches the skin at times and “isn’t very effective.”  Leg use seemed to be better than underarm use.  Overall it doesn’t seem to satisfy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The epilator itself does not come with any kind of storage pouch and the supplied cleaning brush will be lost unless you find a good place for it.  There are two speed settings and the head removes for cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall – this is not a product I would recommend.</li>
    <li> Can I use this for my underarms?</li>
    <li> OK--so maybe I am just not the epilator type of person.  It hurt.  I didn&#x27;t like it.  I stopped using after first time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using epilators for a long time, so I&#x27;m long past the initial \\&quot;tear all your leg hair out at once\\&quot; pain stage.  I&#x27;m going to guess that it&#x27;s just as painful for this epilator as it is for all the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you&#x27;re past that it&#x27;s not a very painful process, and this epilator gets the job done and doesn&#x27;t miss too many hairs.  It&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ve tried that feels a little scratchy, and actually leaves my legs looking scratched and red for a while.  That part doesn&#x27;t hurt, but it does mean that I&#x27;m not going to use this epilator just before I run out the door.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions suggest using a circular motion, which might be good on a large flat area but doesn&#x27;t really feel natural on a leg.  A \\&quot;slow, continuous movement against the hair growth\\&quot; is suggested as an alternative and it&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve been doing.  It works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions promise that \\&quot;Epilating leaves your skin smooth and hair-free for several weeks.\\&quot;  Maybe that will be true for you; it certainly isn&#x27;t for me.  Regrowth is slow and thin, but I still have to use this generally every other day.  And I have the same problem with the occasional ingrown hair that I&#x27;ve had with other epilators.  Pointed tweezers ([[ASIN:B0029U0YM8 like these]]) help with that problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions also warn that \\&quot;Use on face is not recommended.\\&quot;  If (like me) you suffer from Attack of the Unibrow, you probably want to find another solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This epilator comes with a two year limited warranty, but (according to the directions) wrapping the cord around the epilator will void the warranty.  Yeah, really.  You Have Been Warned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cord itself is a good thing in that I never have to worry about forgetting to charge a battery, but I&#x27;m finding that it&#x27;s a bit of a pain.  Being tethered to an outlet is inconvenient in my bathroom, and sometimes the cord will wander across the area I&#x27;m epilating.  The epilator has never pinched the cord, though--it just gets in the way.  If you&#x27;ve got a convenient outlet it might work a little better for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yes, lots of pain at first.  Once past that it&#x27;s pretty convenient and I really like not needing to shave in the shower every day.  (It also cuts down my water use.)  It can&#x27;t be used on the face, and it leaves my legs looking a little irritated for a while.  The battery will never run out in mid-use because there is no battery, but the cord can sometimes be a little inconvenient.  There is a two year warranty but the terms leave Remington a lot of wiggle room.  But it works and it&#x27;s easy to clean.  If you want to stop buying razor blades or waxing supplies and if you can get past the initial pain, this epilator seems to do the job.t gets in the way.

    <li> I found this epilator difficult to use - the circular motion recommended doesn&#x27;t work well on legs, and it&#x27;s PAINFUL!  I found it difficult to get all the hairs I wanted to get, and was reluctant to try again due to the pain.  The design makes it awkward to hold, and I really think that for a device like this for this price, a little storage bag isn&#x27;t too much to ask, along with something to cover the tweezer area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to stick to my razors and shaving gel, and for times when that isn&#x27;t convenient, I bought this shaver from Amazon:&lt;br /&gt;Panasonic ES2207P Ladies 3-Blade &amp;#34;Close Curves&amp;#34; Wet/Dry Shaver.  It comes with a cover for the blade portion, a nice little storage bag, and it works as well as you&#x27;d expect an electric/battery operated shaver to work.</li>
    <li> First, I can withstand the pain that inevitably comes from using an epilator. I&#x27;ve used epilators in the past, I also wax myself. I can handle pain, but this pain was excruciating! I understand this was designed to grab more hairs at once than older model epilators and let me testify to the fact that it INDEED grabs more hairs with one pass - so much so that I used this on my feet the first time (toes and tops of feet) and the following day my toes and tops of feet were still red and puffy because grabbing so much hair at once actually caused some real skin trauma. My toes felt bruised and one of my big toes was yanked with such a force that I worried I may have broken my toe, but fortunately it was not broken. It took three days for all of the puffiness to subside and for the pain to go away. I&#x27;ve never had such a reaction to any type of hair removal. I&#x27;ve used epilators in the past and never had this happen. This might work well for you if aren&#x27;t very hairy and have few hairs, but if you have a lot of hairs or 2-3 hairs growing in nearly the same hair shaft, this device could be problematic.</li>
    <li> As mentioned in an earlier epilator review I wrote for Vine, I&#x27;m a non-hirsute blonde. This translates to relatively sparse body hair and what there is of it is fine and light. In other words, I&#x27;ve never undergone the level of pain that others describe in their reviews and never will--it&#x27;s just not possible. That&#x27;s not to say that epilation is a painless procedure for me, just not all that bad. So saying, on to the Remington Products EP7010 Smooth and Silky Essential Epilator; just be aware that your own mileage will probably vary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Smooth and Silky works pretty much the same way that all epilators work: by catching body hairs and tweezing, rather than shaving, them. While this is less comfortable than shaving (with an electric) or using a depilatory, it produces longer-lasting results and can actually result in finer hair growth over time, as continued plucking can damage hair roots. Fine hair like mine is a bit harder to grab and the Smooth and Silky Essential sets it up for a one-two punch with enough tweezers to ensure that all hairs are eventually grabbed. Unfortunately, it seems to grab my epidermis a bit more than it should, too, and I&#x27;d really prefer to hang on to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Smooth and Silky Essential Epilator is, I find, a bit bulky to use and as I mentioned in my other epilator review, a choice of batteries or electricity would be greatly appreciated. All in all, I find it works well but again, my needs aren&#x27;t heavy. Pricing seems competitive for a product of this kind and as long as one goes into epilation with the expectation of at least some discomfort, the Remington Products EP7010 Smooth and Silky Essential Epilator could be the device for you. Just remember that forewarned is forearmed.</li>
    <li> Keep in mind that this is a PERSONAL opinion and experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does what it is constructed to do...only one issue...it wasn&#x27;t the product it was me. My hair is thick so the tweezers went dull--Like i said though, this is product could be better for a teen who is learning how to shave or wax for the first time. As far as the pain, you do feel a little shock like pokes. Nothing that makes you scream. Keep in mind that everyone tolerates pain differently. I also did my underarms..it&#x27;s a sensitive area and yes, it did sting while epilating them, though you get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just keep in mind that everyone is different; products work differently on everyone.</li>
    <li> After only 2 weeks of use, the drive gear stripped and the epilator is useless.  Waiting to see how amazon and/or Remington handle the issue...</li>
    <li> I have been using epilators for fourteen years, and after the first wore out, I got a Braun. I have since reviewed several Braun epilators, always favorably, and I had found  that brand to be the best--at least for me. Remington (I believe they made my first epilator) has completely surprised me with a product that is at least Braun&#x27;s equal. I didn&#x27;t expect much from the EP7010, which is why I was amazed at how easy it is to use, and how quickly it does the job. I don&#x27;t know how 20th century marketers convinced women they should shave their legs, but we do it, and using a razor--no matter what sex it is designed for--has always been a painful experience for me (not so much the hair removal, but the skin removal), whereas most epilators produce much less pain, better results, and don&#x27;t have to be used as often (no next-day stubble).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the Remington EP7010, I had all the benefits of using an epilator, and was rewarded by how smooth my skin felt after using it (which is not always the case with various brands). Some people try epilators and say they can&#x27;t use them because they are too painful. Yes, they do PULL the hair out, but I didn&#x27;t experience any discomfort with the EP7010. Epilators have come a long way since the Epilady was first introduced (a truly painful tool that I used once and went back to shaving!). One warning though: the EP7010 has two speeds; it is best to stick to the lower speed for underarms.</li>
    <li> Yes, it hurts. It is 40 tweezers all at once, pulling out hairs. I know that just one hair being pulled by a tweezer hurts me, so this hurts about 40-times as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But . . . it&#x27;s so worth it! Areas I&#x27;ve epilated stay hair-free for quite a while. (I&#x27;ve only had a chance to use this product one time and that was about three weeks ago. So far, hair has not grown back in.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never tried any other epilator, just tweezers.</li>
    <li> Bought this after trying out my friend&#x27;s one. I could only stand to do one leg because of the pain, and so thought I would trial how long epilating lasted growth-wise with the Veet cream that I normally use. It kicked Veet&#x27;s butt, and 2 weeks later there is still minimal-none growth on the epilated leg, and I have dark hair. Bought myself one from my local Walgreens for $25 with my Walgreens card. I highly recommend using an ice pack to help numb the area, it helped a lot the 2nd time around. I only needed to do some touch ups on my original leg, and the pain was minimal compared to the first time. It did take a long time though - be prepared for it to take at least 20 minutes, and to go over spots multiple times. I&#x27;ll wait to see how it goes long term. So far the delayed hair growth, the lack of chemicals, and affordability (in comparison to what I would spend on Veet cream &amp; razors) are in it&#x27;s favor.</li>
    <li> All the pain considerations aside, the aspects of this product that didn’t work for me personally and that other customers might want to consider:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) It doesn’t work on batteries, so you have to sit somewhere close to an electrical socket. This was a big inconvenience for me, but I guess others might think it a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;2) This epilator lacks mobility to take care of the body areas that are not flat (think: knees). No special attachments to compensate for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A fair quality for the price, but as far as quality is concerned, there are better epilators out there.</li>
    <li> Wow, this product worked just as I had hoped.  However, I&#x27;m probably a little different than most because I had laser hair removal done about 10 years ago.  Over the years some of the hair &amp;#34;rejuvenated&amp;#34; plus the laser treatments didn&#x27;t remove any of the light-colored hair.  I found it necessary to shave every couple of months or tweeze several dark hairs as they surfaced.  I just used this product and it worked perfectly.  I will never have to shave again.  I could feel a slight sting when the hair was being &amp;#34;plucked&amp;#34; but that only told me it was working.  If I had a lot more hair it would probably hurt more but for me it was virtually painless.</li>
    <li> Went out looking for an electric razor and talked myself into getting one of these.&lt;br /&gt;First I&#x27;m not gonna lie, yes the first time did sting without a doubt. But lets be honest girls, you can&#x27;t tell me dancing all night in 4 inch heels is comfy either.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, now it&#x27;s no big deal and i don&#x27;t have to worry about my legs for at least a month at a time.&lt;br /&gt;Granted, everyone&#x27;s hair is different but i would say i have normal thickness of hair.  When stubble does start to show it is super fine which makes me think that is why it doesn&#x27;t hurt so bad now.  It takes longer to use than a regular electric razor so sometimes i will use a disposable to neaten things up until i have time to devote.  Also there are &amp;#34;areas&amp;#34; that i absolutely haven&#x27;t been able to use it on but for the legs it&#x27;s great.  Have also used it on lower arms and (being a close-to-fifty year old woman) have used it on a few facial areas as well.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line:  LOVE it, so glad I got it and when it dies I will buy another one.&lt;br /&gt;I got it at Walmart for about 29.00 so for the price it&#x27;s worth a try.  Not having to shave my legs every 4-5 days makes me happy.</li>
    <li> omg i jus bought 1 of these at walgreens dont buy these thing the hurt worse tha any tattoo ive ever had</li>
    <li> This was the first epilator I tried.  I have  lupus also had thyroid removed related to cancer ,the excessive hair growth to me seem like the final blow to my esteem where my appearance was concerned.  I had hairy arms that apes would envy,and the hair on my face was no longer contained just to above the lip and a few on the chin, my entire face was hairy!  I started with my arm it worked so well I couldn&#x27;t believe it.it looks and sounds very scary if you have never used one before. I am now investing in a higher end epilator, but this one definitely was a great choice for first time use.  always use  a post epilating cream for soothing you do need it believe me. and yes it is going to be painful in the beginning but after a few uses you will find  less and less pain involved. I used regular tweezers on the really course stubble on my legs before epilating this helps a lot, now I no longer shave and I love it</li>
    <li> OKAY NOT BAD... IT BETTER THEN SHAVING...</li>
    <li> Skin is not silky and smooth. A huge amount of hair grows into skin,and then it is so itchy. It removes hair really for some 2 weeks but skin is not smooth.</li>
    <li> Well, let me just start by saying there are way better quality Epilators out there than this one. If you can withstand the the nick and pricking feeling enough then maybe. I did an area on my leg and it felt like it i was getting shots. Once i removed the epilator from the area there was still hair there. It would remove some of the hair but not all. Not enough to make me want to switch. I&#x27;d prefer to just shave or use Nair cream the pink swirly one that i know works, but has such a strong chemical smell i can&#x27;t take it most times. Its easy clean up when it comes to this device and its easy handling, I just didn&#x27;t seem to get the desired results therefore i won&#x27;t be using this much.</li>
    <li> The Remington epilator is a handy device, even for men.  For me it is no more painful than shaving, however, one of the keys is preparing the skin properly before use.  Being corded means that the power is even an plentiful.</li>
    <li> Let me detail the ways I dislike this product. First, there is no carrying bag/case for it; which doesn&#x27;t seem like a big deal until you&#x27;re looking for the cord and the cleaning brush and can&#x27;t find it amid a million other cords running around underneath your bathroom sink. Second, there are no other caps to switch out, say for your face or sensitive areas. Third, the head doesn&#x27;t pivot to go around knees or other spots. Fourth, I have very fine hair and this doesn&#x27;t seem to want to grab any of them. I had to make several passes over one area to get all the hair. Fifth, not having to use it again for 6 weeks seems a real stretch. I had to use it again after 3 weeks, which I&#x27;m sure if you have darker hair than I do, you&#x27;d want to use it before that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price of this product (or perhaps a bit more), you could buy a better product (like the Braun Silk Epil 5 or Epil 7, which I&#x27;ve both reviewed). Take a pass on this one.</li>
    <li> This is a good basic epilator. No bells and whistles, just the basics. It does remove hair well. I just wish it had some extra attachments to control how much hair was removed. There are other products that have more attachments,  as well as epilator heads. It will cost much, but I find it&#x27;s worth it. One product I would recommend it the Braun Silk Epil 7. This is a personal choice depending on how many features you would like.</li>
    <li> I bought one at walmart about a month back and i must say, its great! After struggling with hair removal for years i can say this worked out the best. Being a brown skinned person shaving my underarms would only make it darker and bumpy. Waxing was a hassle as it took too much work was messy and i had to wait a while for the hair to grow back. But with this epilator you can epilate even fine short hair. I dont recommend this for bikini area though as it hurts really bad. It worked especially great for underarms. Also it pulls out 80% of the hair but cuts off the remainder instead of pulling. I end up with at least one razor bump every time i use this but considering my past experiences i must say this has been the best of all. Worth the purchase!</li>
    <li> I recently switched to the Remington Smooth and Silky Essential Epilator as a similar replacement for my Emjoi Soft Caress Epilator which after 5 years of use and being well taken care of needed to be replaced. Since they both have Dual Speeds and similar amounts of tweezers the Remington actually has more with 40 tweezers I figured it would be just as effective and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Remington does work even if your hair is very thin (like arm hair for example) it is very effective at removal. However I found that with underarm hair especially it would take me 3-4 times longer than it did with my Emjoi model, and I would have to do multiple passes of the same spot and still sometimes it would just end up breaking the hair rather than pulling it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to clean and is corded so no need for batteries. As with all epilators this one is no less painful, and feels similar to getting large areas of hair removed with wax. It&#x27;s a decent epilator but it&#x27;s not perfect.</li>
    <li> I go through this every spring, trying to find a less painful way to remove hair before the water seasons start.  I like to be all nice and soft all over.  But I am not a glutten for gratuitous pain and so I tried to avoid the wax jobs.  The very worst outcome though is a dual pain causer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used an epilator before and hoped that they would have improved the technology somehow.  They didn’t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried using this under different circumstances  but always on my legs.  Just as an experiment, I tried using it on dry skin, which was excruciating.  Using it after a hot shower was a little better, with softer skin.  After a hot bath, less painful, but only slightly.  The very best was to use it was after sitting in a 106 degree hot tub.  The hot tub involved wine though, so not one of my most scientific experiments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also been giving some thought to this whole idea of pain.  I don’t understand why I am more likely to let someone else hurt me than to do it to myself.  There has to be a name for it.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this thing.  She uses on her armpits regularly.  Per her description, &amp;#34;It stings at first, but it goes away quick.  The more you use it the less it hurts.&amp;#34;  She has also tried it on her bikini area, but apparently the &amp;#34;It hurts less with use&amp;#34; does not really apply there.  I can say, out of curiosity, I zapped some scruff on my face to see.  OUCH!  I wont be trying that again to see if it hurts less with use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She has used it fairly regularly for over a month now.  She likes it.  Quick, easy, and comparatively painless (with time).  Though, considering she uses it weekly, I would say their &amp;#34;Removes hair for up to 6 weeks&amp;#34; claim is a bit over stated.</li>
    <li> On the good side, this product is lightweight and comfortable to hold (I have small hands). It&#x27;s also easy to clean and comes with a cleaning brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad side is that it just doesn&#x27;t work very well. The design of the hed is such that it did a poor job tweezing under my arms despite my concerted efforts. It did a better job on my legs, but not great--and it nicked the skin slightly too. It also took forever to adequately cover any area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also find the product inconvenient for underam use because you&#x27;re supposed to use it when your skin is free of lotions or deodorants, but shortly after a shower. And you&#x27;re not supposed to use deodorants for a while because the skin will be irritated. This means either showering at night (which I don&#x27;t do) or using it in the morning and then going deodorant-free for the day, which isn&#x27;t practical in my climate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, too much of a hassle and not good enough results.</li>
    <li> Very uncomfortable to use the first time, pulling on my hairs and did not leave a smooth and silky feel to my skin.  The hair regrew faster than the two to three weeks estimated by Remington.  Now the hairs are too short to properly use the device.  Not any better than using a razor blade.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because of all the great reviews, but I was not satisfied with the product. First of all, the box advertises that you will be smooth for up to 6 weeks; however my hair grows a little above average so I was expecting at least 3 to 4 weeks hair-free legs, not 5 days! At first I was like, “Okay, fine I could deal with this” but then two days later I started to get red bumps all over my legs and they did not go away until like a week later! Not only that but once the hair on my legs started to grow they grew straight and parallel to the surface of my skin. I literally had a bunch of hair growing under my skin; I had to scratch the skin off with tweezers just so I could get the hair out (it was a long and tedious process). You can give it a try if you want, might work better on you than it did on me, all I know is that I’m NEVER buying this product or something similar to this ever again.</li>
    <li> I have never seen such a cool torture machine, it manages to rip hair out in the most inhumane way possible, the head is unnatural, and it just plain does not work well leaving it ripping at the same hairs multiple times before ripping them out of your body.</li>
    <li> The first time I used this epilator it worked well.  There was a small learning curve to preventing the machine from pinching the skin.  The first time I used it I only did the bottom half of my legs because it was a little painful and I figured I would come back and do the top half later.  When I tried to do the top half of my legs a couple days later one of the tweezers broke so the head on the machine wouldn&#x27;t turn anymore.  I would not waste my money on this epilator!</li>
    <li> It is SO PAINFUL to use! I got about 2 inches done on my arm before I was shaking too uncontrollably to continue. At first I thought the results were excellent, and that I could continue to slowly expand the area and get used to the torture, but after a few days, it appears that the epilator only cut/snapped the hairs. I was so traumatized that I was shaking in fear at my routine Brazilian waxing session. I will be returning this product.</li>
