      <li>OPI, cute color. .</li>
      <li>It is my favorite color now.</li>
      <li>This color is bright and cheerful and goes on smooth.</li>
      <li>No Room for the Blues has been my favorite color of nail polish since it came out, I believe in 2004.</li>
      <li>Love Love Love the colors, I bought</li>
      <li>OPI does it again :)</li>
      <li>Love the way it looks on me.</li>
      <li>long-lasting by itself but lasts even longer with a top coat.</li>
      <li>It is just the perfect neutral blue.</li>
      <li>Love this color.</li>
      <li>I love this color and it isn&#x27;t sparkly.  </li>
      <li>I LOVE OPI, they never disappoint.</li>
      <li>Love this nail polish because it was so easy to apply and went on evenly.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not shocking neon but the right amount of brightness that it stands out nicely.</li>
      <li>the blue is really beautiful.</li>
      <li>Such a great color....</li>
      <li>smooth purchase, transaction and shipping.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Smooth consistency and went on evenly.  </li>
      <li>I LOVE it with a bright green. :)</li>
      <li>(if you are familiar with that color)</li>
      <li>Satisfied Customer ;)</li>
      <li>wonderful color for summer -- just the right blue -- love opi products in general</li>
      <li>The color is true to the picture.  </li>
      <li>the vendor was nice enough to give me a refund when the product did not arrive after 20 days.</li>
      <li>this color is very vibrant and fun!</li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s a more unique blue.</li>
      <li>and like my other OPI nail polishes, they wear well, and are good quality.  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s just right.  </li>
      <li>The blue is not too teenybopper but just bright and classy for all ages!</li>
      <li>this is a really gr8 color!</li>
      <li>Pretty color,  although it&#x27;s lighter than it looked on my screen.</li>
      <li>Definitely a must have! :)</li>
      <li>Definitely a favorite for this fair-skinned, blonde hair, blue-eyed girl.  </li>
      <li>is the prettiest light blue polish I&#x27;ve ever seen &amp; that OPI carries.</li>
      <li>My first OPI nail polish, they are amazing, last a long time in your nails.</li>
      <li>Fast service...</li>
      <li>dropped something on my big toe years ago and my nail always grows back dark - this covers it up and is a great fun color, everyone always compliments my toe nails instead of asking me about my funky toe...</li>
      <li>My new place to soho for beauty supplies</li>
      <li>I really love this color, not sure when it came out</li>
      <li>First color I tried outside pink-red- purple shades.  </li>
      <li>I was worried because of my tan/brown skin that it might look too loud</li>
      <li>but..next I want Hot pink.</li>
      <li>My 10 year old niece asked me if she could take it with her during our last visit to the nail</li>
      <li>the color is pretty close to the pictures,&lt;br /&gt;a little darker but that&#x27;s expected.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This particular blue appeared to have been sitting in a box for a long time, as we had to shake the bottle for a while for the color to sort of appear mixed in.  </li>

    <li> Such a great color....OPI does it again :)</li>
    <li> Satisfied Customer ;)</li>
    <li> I got the nail polish on time! Good condition! and Exactly what I wanted!!!! I was very pleased!</li>
    <li> I love this color and it isn&#x27;t sparkly.  I&#x27;m approaching the age, though kicking and screaming, that wearing sparkly nail polish is a bit out of fashion.  It is just the perfect neutral blue.</li>
    <li> this is a really gr8 color! The blue is not too teenybopper but just bright and classy for all ages!</li>
    <li> Fast service...awesome product...thank you!</li>
    <li> dropped something on my big toe years ago and my nail always grows back dark - this covers it up and is a great fun color, everyone always compliments my toe nails instead of asking me about my funky toe... it kind of looks like bottom paint for boats though (if you are familiar with that color) and i work around boats so i got that a lot &amp;#34;what did you do paint your toenails with bottom paint?!&amp;#34; but i have a good sense of humor so i just kick them in the A$$ with my bottom paint toes!</li>
    <li> I love this color, I have nothing bad to say about it. Love the way it looks on me. It did take 6 days to arrive though. The other 2 that I ordered from different seller only took 2 days! This one I ordered it the same time and day as the other 2.</li>
    <li> the color is pretty close to the pictures,&lt;br /&gt;a little darker but that&#x27;s expected.&lt;br /&gt;very smooth purchase, transaction and shipping.&lt;br /&gt;would definitely buy from again.</li>
    <li> I actually bought this blue to represent my Detroit Lions.  Did not think I would be a fan of blue.  This color is a star!  Definitely a favorite for this fair-skinned, blonde hair, blue-eyed girl.  Many compliments from the men too!</li>
    <li> wonderful color for summer -- just the right blue -- love opi products in general</li>
    <li> My first OPI nail polish, they are amazing, last a long time in your nails. the blue is really beautiful.</li>
    <li> Beautiful color...looks like picture.  Smooth consistency and went on evenly.  Only took 2 coats and lasted a week on my toes (haven&#x27;t tried it on fingers yet).</li>

    <li> Color same as advertised.</li>
    <li> First color I tried outside pink-red- purple shades.  I&#x27;m 58 and I thought this color was a little radical for me.  It is my favorite color now. Everyone notices and likes the color.  So happy with it.  and like my other OPI nail polishes, they wear well, and are good quality.  the name of it is &amp;#34;No Room for the Blues&amp;#34; B83.  It is a beautiful color.  I always wear it on my toes.</li>
    <li> Love this nail polish because it was so easy to apply and went on evenly. Love Love Love the colors, I bought&lt;br /&gt;this really pretty blue one, hard to find but..next I want Hot pink. Definitely a must have! :)</li>

I receive numerous compliments every time I wear it from men &amp; women alike. My 10 year old niece asked me if she could take it with her during our last visit to the nail salon.&lt;br /&gt;No room for the blues is my go to color in between my mani/pedi appts</li>
