### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>they are awesome.</li>
      <li>They are excellent</li>
      <li>These are great hair bands.  </li>
      <li>We&#x27;ve found Amazon to be the best value for this product and love the convenience of ordering online.</li>
      <li>These things must be good.</li>
      <li>my kids ordered them, and I have not heard any complain, so I am assuming they are good.</li>
      <li>PERFECT FIT, THANKS!!</li>
      <li>hope this review was helpful :)</li>
      <li>These are my household&#x27;s favorite pony tail holders.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re his favorite toy and it takes him a while to chew through the rubber.).</li>
      <li>My daughter has an enormous amount of hair on her head and this is the brand she likes best.</li>
      <li>I love them.</li>
      <li>I wear my long hair in a ponytail quite often, and these bands hold it perfectly!  </li>
      <li>and they&#x27;re pretty much good for nothing.</li>
      <li>Overall, good item at a good price</li>
      <li>/&gt;They easily loop twice or thrice without breaking, and they don&#x27;t have any metal damaging my hair</li>
      <li>The first day we wore two bands and they both broke!</li>
      <li>Are they worth trying?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>They are, by far, our favorite, inexpensive hair tie.</li>
      <li>The only reason these hairbands do not receive &amp;#34;5 stars&amp;#34; is because with thicker hair, the elasticity is lost more quickly.</li>
      <li>One day, three of them broke as I was putting them in my hair for the first time.</li>
      <li>They arrived fast!</li>
      <li>A month in and still on the first one from the pack.</li>
      <li>, that is way stretchier and does not break the first time you try to put it in your hair.</li>
      <li>I got my package within four days of it being mailed out and the owner is very polite.</li>
      <li>My whole reason for ordering this product was because I wanted the ring that is shown on the picture</li>
      <li>We have to buy them more frequently, but as they wear out, we just double them up for pony-tails.</li>
      <li>It says it&#x27;s good for thick hair - which I have.</li>
      <li>Product arrived as two packages of normal black hair ties with an additional two colored hair ties per package, which was a nice added bonus.</li>
      <li>Most of the elastic bands are thin and break easily.</li>
      <li>These elastics are the only ones that I can put in my 3 year old daughter&#x27;s fine hair without her screaming.</li>
      <li>This is not thick elastic.</li>
      <li>, they are not thick.</li>
      <li>But when this happens, I have no problem throwing it away and grabbing a new one out of the package.</li>
      <li>These are not the extra large elastics I was hoping.  </li>
      <li>We&#x27;ve been using these Goody elastics for several years and will continue buying them (just a side note: our cat really loves them as well.</li>
      <li>This product wasn&#x27;t worth the money I spent.</li>
      <li>Well after this review was posted for several months it seems they have replaced the old picture with a new one that DOES reflect what you are buying.  </li>
      <li>These were exactly what I expected and wanted.</li>
      <li>You will have about 1-2 in a pack that will be rough or possibly will break upon first use but the rest will wear for a long time depending on your hair and how much you stretch them</li>
      <li>the flat hair elastics stay put better than the round ones for fine thin hair?</li>
      <li>The quality of these has gone down hill for the last few years to the point that a fresh band i took off the cardboard SNAPPED the FIRST time I tried to use it!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried less expensive brands, but they don&#x27;t do a great job of holding my hair.</li>
      <li>These break much faster than similar products of other brands.</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t have enough elastic, so they barely stretch..  </li>
      <li>We prefer Goody, no metal bands, no grabbing exposed rubber, they expand more than any other brand to encompass thick hair and don&#x27;t break as soon as you pull them.  </li>
      <li>These bands are extremely tight and they snap very easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>And I have thin fine hair and have to wrap these around my ponytails</li>

<li> And I have thin fine hair and have to wrap these around my ponytails</li>
<li> I usually like Goody ponytail holders, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy the ones with the smart stretch core again, like these.</li>
<li> These are a must if you have long hair.</li>
<li> They only last a few uses (2-3 days) before they&#x27;re blown out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> My teenage daughter always has at least one of these on her wrist and they do a fabulous job of holding her very thick hair.</li>
<li> I should mention that these items tend to stretch as you use them and the band you only had to wrap around your hair 2-3 times to start, will require you to wrap it around 4-6 times in a few days if you don&#x27;t replace it.</li>
<li> Usually I can loosen up the ponytail elastic a bit if necessary, but these hold their shape a bit too well, perhaps to a fault in my opinion.</li>
<li> if anyone know on hair bands that STAY put on very thin hair, please leave me a comment, thanks!</li>
<li> Not worth the money.</li>
<li> They also come in dark brown.</li>
<li> /&gt;After about 2 weeks of constant use (always looping at least twice), it does start stretching and losing elasticity.</li>
<li> I went through a pack of 30 in less than 6 months.</li>
<li> but it would help keep them organized if you had it (which you do not) and the picture said I would get it, not true.  </li>
<li> They stretch well, yet hold tight, and don&#x27;t have the metal joiner that some have.  </li>
<li> We use these everyday to keep our hair out of our eyes.</li>
<li> These elastic ponytail holders are very tight.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s weird to buy these here, but they are sometimes missing from our local retailers.  </li>
<li> It might be a small thing</li>
<li> With three girls in the house we go through pony tails like crazy, I like keeping extra in the car and in my purse, they of course keep at least one on their wrists at all times.</li>
<li> Yet I have broken 4 of these ponytail holders in the past week.</li>
<li> they&#x27;re terrible.  </li>
<li> These hair twisties are awful.  </li>

    <li> These were exactly what I expected and wanted. They arrived fast!</li>
    <li> Not at all as described. This is not thick elastic.</li>
    <li> The only reason these hairbands do not receive &amp;#34;5 stars&amp;#34; is because with thicker hair, the elasticity is lost more quickly. We have to buy them more frequently, but as they wear out, we just double them up for pony-tails.</li>

    <li> These are my household&#x27;s favorite pony tail holders. I&#x27;ve tried less expensive brands, but they don&#x27;t do a great job of holding my hair. These elastics are the only ones that I can put in my 3 year old daughter&#x27;s fine hair without her screaming. They never hurt her when I take them out, either. My teenage daughter always has at least one of these on her wrist and they do a fabulous job of holding her very thick hair.

    <li> PERFECT FIT, THANKS!!</li>
    <li> Most of the elastic bands are thin and break easily. This product wasn&#x27;t worth the money I spent. I will buy something different next time.</li>
    <li> They are excellent I got my package within four days of it being mailed out and the owner is very polite. I had no issues I recommend you do business with this place they are awesome.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY THESE...  they&#x27;re terrible.  These hair twisties are awful.  They don&#x27;t have enough elastic, so they barely stretch..  they just break.  I couldn&#x27;t even wrap one around my hair twice without it breaking.  they are a piece of junk.  I do not recommend these at all.  I recommend using a different brand, like scunci, that is way stretchier and does not break the first time you try to put it in your hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s weird to buy these here, but they are sometimes missing from our local retailers.  We prefer Goody, no metal bands, no grabbing exposed rubber, they expand more than any other brand to encompass thick hair and don&#x27;t break as soon as you pull them.

    <li> These are great hair bands.  My daughter has an enormous amount of hair on her head and this is the brand she likes best.</li>
    <li> These are not the extra large elastics I was hoping.  I can buy these anywhere.  I was hoping for the larger version.</li>
    <li> These are the only hair bands I use. I love them. I&#x27;ve been using these for over 8 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They easily loop twice or thrice without breaking, and they don&#x27;t have any metal damaging my hair strands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about 2 weeks of constant use (always looping at least twice), it does start stretching and losing elasticity. But when this happens, I have no problem throwing it away and grabbing a new one out of the package. So a 27-count pack lasts for quite a while before I need to order more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this review was helpful :)</li>
    <li> The quality of these has gone down hill for the last few years to the point that a fresh band i took off the cardboard SNAPPED the FIRST time I tried to use it! And I have thin fine hair and have to wrap these around my ponytails 4X so they stretch out they dont stay put they slide out and they&#x27;re pretty much good for nothing. They only last a few uses (2-3 days) before they&#x27;re blown out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do the flat hair elastics stay put better than the round ones for fine thin hair? Are they worth trying?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m open to suggestions if anyone know on hair bands that STAY put on very thin hair, please leave me a comment, thanks!</li>
    <li> My whole reason for ordering this product was because I wanted the ring that is shown on the picture so I had a way to keep the hair elastics together.  The metal ring  is not in the package as shown on the picture.</li>
    <li> These elastic ponytail holders are very tight. It says it&#x27;s good for thick hair - which I have. Yet I have broken 4 of these ponytail holders in the past week. I like to wear my hair in a bun of sorts, but I can&#x27;t use these ponytail holders to do that - they are too rigid. Usually I can loosen up the ponytail elastic a bit if necessary, but these hold their shape a bit too well, perhaps to a fault in my opinion. I usually like Goody ponytail holders, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy the ones with the smart stretch core again, like these.</li>
    <li> The first day we wore two bands and they both broke!</li>
    <li> We use these everyday to keep our hair out of our eyes. These are a must if you have long hair. Hopefully the 2 pack will last for sometime!</li>
    <li> These break much faster than similar products of other brands. I went through a pack of 30 in less than 6 months. One day, three of them broke as I was putting them in my hair for the first time. Not worth the money. I have not had this problem with the scünci brand ones I have now. A month in and still on the first one from the pack.</li>
    <li> These things must be good. my kids ordered them, and I have not heard any complain, so I am assuming they are good.</li>
    <li> I wear my long hair in a ponytail quite often, and these bands hold it perfectly!  They stretch well, yet hold tight, and don&#x27;t have the metal joiner that some have.  They also come in dark brown.</li>
    <li> Product arrived as two packages of normal black hair ties with an additional two colored hair ties per package, which was a nice added bonus.</li>
    <li> These bands are extremely tight and they snap very easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have Asian hair and I am trying to wrap it into a bun. These elastics could not do the job. I&#x27;ve snapped 3 of them so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, they are not thick.</li>
    <li> My wife and I have bought these same hairbands for years and they work relatively well.  You will have about 1-2 in a pack that will be rough or possibly will break upon first use but the rest will wear for a long time depending on your hair and how much you stretch them BUT I did want to point out that the metal ring that they show in the picture for this item IS NOT INCLUDED IN THIS PURCHASE!  It might be a small thing but it would help keep them organized if you had it (which you do not) and the picture said I would get it, not true.  Overall, good item at a good price so 4 Stars but you don&#x27;t get the item in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Sept 2013 Well after this review was posted for several months it seems they have replaced the old picture with a new one that DOES reflect what you are buying.  I should mention that these items tend to stretch as you use them and the band you only had to wrap around your hair 2-3 times to start, will require you to wrap it around 4-6 times in a few days if you don&#x27;t replace it.</li>
