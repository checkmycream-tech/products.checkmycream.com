      <li>Smells good.  </li>
      <li>A very nice, light scent and a great complement to the shampoo.</li>
      <li>Many times &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; products don&#x27;t work well, but this is great.</li>
      <li>Use this every day with their shampoo, and my grandchildren love it!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>It smells amazing.</li>
      <li>I gave it away to a friend who said she really liked it.</li>
      <li>I would have to say it&#x27;s one of the best natural conditioners out there, and I&#x27;ve tried many brands over the years.  </li>
      <li>i love love love love this conditioner!</li>
      <li>I love every Andalou product I&#x27;ve used; shampoos, conditioners, body lotions, and face lotions.</li>
      <li>I love the smell of my hair and</li>
      <li>So just to be safe, I just stopped using it after finishing one bottle.</li>
      <li>I love Andalou Naturals -- the products, the scent, and the results.  </li>
      <li>This is my favorite conditioner.  </li>
      <li>I wash my hair once a week (more than that</li>
      <li>Like I stated in my review of this product&#x27;s accompanying shampoo, I truly wanted to love these products, but my hair wouldn&#x27;t let me...</li>
      <li>I LOVE THIS SHAMPOO/CONDITIONER SET.</li>
      <li>This conditioner is fantastic!</li>
      <li>LOVE them all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My rule of thumb is that if EWG&#x27;s website rates it as a safe product, I buy it.</li>
      <li>Hair looks shiny and healthy.</li>
      <li>I also appreciate that it is gluten free!</li>
      <li>But I do love the smell.</li>
      <li>and they always leave my hair healthy.  </li>
      <li>will say, though, that with more commercialized conditioners (like herbal essence) my hair does feel softer than when I use this.  </li>
      <li>nothing better buy all the time</li>
      <li>I liked it a lot, definitely better than most, but it didn&#x27;t blow me totally away.</li>
      <li>and it leaves my hair clean and light</li>
      <li>I love this product because it doesn&#x27;t have hazardous chemicals that other more known products have.</li>
      <li>Like, if I was reasonably certain it was safe to do so</li>
      <li>I shave my head, but I switched to this recently for my moustache, and it&#x27;s pretty great.</li>
      <li>This conditioner combined with the shampoo is the best organic combo I have ever found for thick, curly hair.</li>
      <li>Facial hair is course stuff, but this leaves it nice and smooth and manageable.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found, however, that the long it sits the better it works!  </li>
      <li>This has an orange sherbet smell and works pretty well.</li>
      <li>aloe is the first ingredient.  </li>
      <li>I will be using this product for the foreseeable future :)</li>
      <li>If you rinse it our right away it doesn&#x27;t condition very well.  </li>
      <li>and then rinse it out in cool water, my hair feels wonderfully soft!  </li>
      <li>I have been using this line for a few months now and love it!</li>
      <li>I bought it from Whole Foods, I like how it makes my hair shiny and straight.</li>
      <li>Very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I really like it.  </li>
      <li>very relaxing</li>
      <li>Far better than the last brand I used.</li>
      <li>And doesn&#x27;t most of the harmful chemicals in other conditioners (or shampoos).</li>
      <li>Not that my hair isn&#x27;t soft; I can just tell its soft by more natural means and not harsh chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>But this particular conditioner just didn&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>This brand really leaves my daughters hair soft and tangle free and the scent lasts a long time.  </li>
      <li>and im not sure most natural products usually use that...still a good product though.</li>
      <li>I have recommended this brand to many friends and I will continue to use this on my little girl.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had far less static and frizzies.  </li>
      <li>For a quick wash I use the shampoo only on my head, not on the length of my hair, rinse, and then comb this conditioner through, pile it on top of my head, and let it sit for at least 5 minutes.  </li>
      <li>This does NOT weigh down my hair and at the same time keeps my hair soft and healthy.</li>
      <li>I usually follow it with a little argan oil or shea butter hair lotion, but if I forget or don&#x27;t have time it works very well on its own.</li>
      <li>I use several of their other products such as their thinning hair treatment and their styling cream and they have all worked very well.  </li>
      <li>My hair feels like silk when it dries (I always let it dry naturally) and I always get compliments on my hair since using this product.</li>

<li> no better than any....</li>
<li> It is much less expensive than her previous conditioner</li>
<li> Any sulfate is not good for our body.</li>

    <li> This is my favorite conditioner.  I&#x27;ve been using it and the shampoo for over a year now and they always leave my hair healthy.  For a quick wash I use the shampoo only on my head, not on the length of my hair, rinse, and then comb this conditioner through, pile it on top of my head, and let it sit for at least 5 minutes.  If you rinse it our right away it doesn&#x27;t condition very well.  I&#x27;ve found, however, that the long it sits the better it works!  If I have the time to work the conditioner through my hair, pin it under a shower cap, wrap my head in a towel, and then let it sit for an hour or two (watch a movie!) and then rinse it out in cool water, my hair feels wonderfully soft!  It also makes a good base to mix with yogurt and honey for a hair mask.  I love Andalou Naturals -- the products, the scent, and the results.  I have wavy tail-bone length hair and I take good care of it, but it is still prone to environmental dryness.  I wash my hair once a week (more than that and it gets too dry).  Since I&#x27;ve bee using the Andalou&#x27;s Moisture shampoo and conditioner I&#x27;ve had far less static and frizzies.  I usually follow it with a little argan oil or shea butter hair lotion, but if I forget or don&#x27;t have time it works very well on its own.</li>
    <li> no better than any....my scalp gets itchy, only since using this product</li>
    <li> Its not organic, there is sulfate in it regardless of what is read on the label or what company claims, I&#x27;ve investigated ingred. not totally organic. Any sulfate is not good for our body.</li>
    <li> This conditioner combined with the shampoo is the best organic combo I have ever found for thick, curly hair. With this conditioner I always get perfect ringlets and no after-residue. My hair feels like silk when it dries (I always let it dry naturally) and I always get compliments on my hair since using this product. It is a good price for the product. I will be using this product for the foreseeable future :)</li>
    <li> Love this product smells wonderful</li>
    <li> I have dry winter dandruf.  I&#x27;d be at my desk at work scratching at my scalp, so embarrassing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s great is that I limited my hair washing to twice a week with this stuff now and during that time my part shows no white flakes at my scalp.  No itch, either.  Very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say, though, that with more commercialized conditioners (like herbal essence) my hair does feel softer than when I use this.  Not that my hair isn&#x27;t soft; I can just tell its soft by more natural means and not harsh chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, the consistency is basically like body lotion, so be prepared to work a little longer and harder to get that stuff into your hair good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and the orange scent smells like creamsicles in the summertime.  I actually did a little dance when I got out of my shower because it smelled so YUMMY.</li>
    <li> Use this every day with their shampoo, and my grandchildren love it!</li>
    <li> i love love love love this conditioner! aloe is the first ingredient.  it smells out of this world!</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t do anything for my hair. I gave it away to a friend who said she really liked it. This is usually a good, reliable brand for me. But this particular conditioner just didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> One of the best shampoos I have ever used!</li>
    <li> Using only these products now. Hair looks shiny and healthy.</li>
    <li> It works.  Feels good.  Smells good.  And doesn&#x27;t most of the harmful chemicals in other conditioners (or shampoos).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this condition on my little girls&#x27; hair for a while now and I really like it.  I would have to say it&#x27;s one of the best natural conditioners out there, and I&#x27;ve tried many brands over the years.

I have recommended this brand to many friends and I will continue to use this on my little girl.</li>
    <li> I love every Andalou product I&#x27;ve used; shampoos, conditioners, body lotions, and face lotions. LOVE them all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m always a bit nervous to try a new conditioner because some of them are too heavy for my thin, fine hair. This does NOT weigh down my hair and at the same time keeps my hair soft and healthy. A feat since I swim in chlorine three times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, bonus, it smells YUMMY!</li>
    <li> Smells great and my hair loves it too.</li>
    <li> I shave my head, but I switched to this recently for my moustache, and it&#x27;s pretty great. Facial hair is course stuff, but this leaves it nice and smooth and manageable. Far better than the last brand I used. And it smells really good. Like, if I was reasonably certain it was safe to do so, I&#x27;d taste some of it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this line for a few months now and love it! I was using DermOrganics but this is more &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; and works great! I have color treated thick hair and my hair is soft and manageable using their line of products. I leave the conditioner in for a few mins b4 washing out, makes a big difference. I just wish they were larger bottles. Their Hair BB cream is wonderful too. They all smell yummy too.</li>
    <li> This has an orange sherbet smell and works pretty well. I liked it a lot, definitely better than most, but it didn&#x27;t blow me totally away. But I do love the smell.</li>
    <li> I have been struggling with a scaly itchy scalp for a few years and have tried so many products that disappointed.  This along with the same lines shampoo have finally given me some relief plus is smells so delicately orange...very relaxing</li>
    <li> Arrived promptly.  Love it!</li>
    <li> This conditioner is fantastic! A very nice, light scent and a great complement to the shampoo. LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> I bought it from Whole Foods, I like how it makes my hair shiny and straight. My hair feels silky and manageable everyday. It is also a plus that it is Organic. My only problem is that it has SOY ingredient in it. I totally avoid soy ingredient with my food since it is not good for thyroid. I cant find articles saying if it has the same harmful effect when used as beauty essentials. So just to be safe, I just stopped using it after finishing one bottle.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of my hair and how shiny/smooth my hair is when I use this conditioner.  I also appreciate that it is gluten free!</li>
    <li> Makes my normally difficult hair feel soft.</li>
    <li> I love this product because it doesn&#x27;t have hazardous chemicals that other more known products have. My rule of thumb is that if EWG&#x27;s website rates it as a safe product, I buy it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is so great. Many times &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; products don&#x27;t work well, but this is great. I have dry-ish curly hair and this is perfect and smells like heaven. :)</li>
    <li> This conditioner has something lacking. It lacks slip, causing me painful and stressful detangling sessions with my hair that often end up with my having to switch out conditioners and use something with a little more oomph (and protein + silicone). Like I stated in my review of this product&#x27;s accompanying shampoo, I truly wanted to love these products, but my hair wouldn&#x27;t let me...</li>
    <li> My wife loves this conditioner.  It is much less expensive than her previous conditioner and she says her hair feels healthier and stronger than before!</li>
    <li> Smells yummy like a creamsicle, ha! Seems to moisturize well for my thick, long hair. Good ingredients but there is Dimethicone in there and im not sure most natural products usually use that...still a good product though.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS SHAMPOO/CONDITIONER SET. It smells amazing. and it leaves my hair clean and light</li>
    <li> nothing better buy all the time</li>
