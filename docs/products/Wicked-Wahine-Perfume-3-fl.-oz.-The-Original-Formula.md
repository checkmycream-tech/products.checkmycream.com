<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> You&#x27;ll get the highest compliments while wearing Wicked Wahine--one of my absolute favorites. I would recommend it to any- and everyone.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed! Does not smell at all like the wicked wahine I bought twice in Hawaii. It looks like water and doesn&#x27;t smell very good.&lt;br /&gt;I did finally find the REAL Wicked Wahine.&lt;br /&gt;I Won&#x27;t purchasse again!</li>
    <li> I lived on Hawaii for two years back in the late 60&#x27;s and new about the perfume then. I just remembered about it recently and figured my wife would really enjoy it and she does. She wears it everyday and we both live it. I would recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> Probably toilet cleaner would smell better.  It smelled musty and musky.  Did not have the sweet, fragrant smell that I enjoyed when I purchased my first Wicked Wahine perfume in Hawaii and then later at a high-end dept. store in the  area where I used to live.</li>
    <li> THIS IS NOTHING LIKE DESCRIBED IT IS HORRIBLE .VERY STRONG SMELL NOTHING LIKE IT STATES IT IS A VERY LOUD HEAVY SMELL MORE FOR A MAN I WAS EXPECTING A WARM BREEZY SANDY LIGHT FLOWER FRAGRANCE WHITE FLOWERS NO ROSE.I HATE WHEN PEOPLE DESCRIBE THINGS THAT IS SO NOT TRUE,THAT SMELL MADE ME SICK TO MY STOMACH AND WOULD NOT TELL ANYONE TO BUY IT SORRY,I WILL SAY THE PERFUME CAME WITH A NICE WELCOME NOTE WHICH MADE IT NICE AND WELCOMING TO BAD I HATE IT ASIDE FROM THEY DO NOT LET YOU KNOW YOU CAN&#x27;T RETURN IT.ALL ITEMS SHOULD COME WITH A CALL TAG LIKE OTHER COMPANIES SUPPLY.</li>
    <li> This order arrived sooner than I expected and just in time for Mother&#x27;s day!! This classic Hawaiian scent is not for the faint of heart so it&#x27;s best to be familiar with the product before ordering. My mother grew up with this scent in Oahu so she wears it year-round. The price is awesome for the quality and it&#x27;s just as strong as it should be. Will return for the great product and reliable service!    Mahalo nui loa!</li>
    <li> This is a great smell. Hard to find and hard to pinpoint because very exotic smelling on your skin. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Love this scent. A friend wore it many years ago and the fragrance stayed in my memory. I contacted her and she provided the name. I&#x27;m adding it to my favorite collection.</li>
    <li> I purchased the first bottle on our visit to the Islands in 1975.&lt;br /&gt;My wife has enjoyed it ever since then.</li>
    <li> Im soooo happy with this purchase. I can relive my last trip&lt;br /&gt;with the smells of Kauai! thank you !</li>
    <li> UPS delivered this product to me today! I am thrilled with it, as I used to buy it in Florida 35 years ago. The scent has not changed a bit. It reminds me of the swaying palm trees and sandy beaches and wonderful Hawaiian flowers. I used to buy this in Florida when 35 years ago when I was very young. I still remembered it after all these years. This kind of fragrance stays on your mind forever. I had no idea it was still being made. One day by fluke I Googled Wicked Wahine and I was shocked it was still available after all these years. So I went online and purchased a bottle as fast as I could. It came all the way from Hawaii 4 days after I ordered it! I was surprised how fast it was in my mailbox! If you want a real Hawaiian scent that you and your man will love, I suggest you buy a bottle!</li>
    <li> my husband mom went to Hawaii a very long time ago and couldn&#x27;t find this anywhere.  that is till I did on here.  we have bought this twice and she loves it..  will buy again when she runs out</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t had this perfume in about 30 years and it just as I remember.</li>
    <li> Nice fast service.  Smells wonderful..Thank You for excellent service.  SH</li>
    <li> The fragrance is great, but it wears off very fast.  Otherwise its a pleasant product.  Ordered other fragrances as well, but haven&#x27;t tried them yet.</li>
    <li> 25 years ago, one little squirt had everyone asking me, what is that perfume youre wearing? I love it, this time, I asked people if they liked it, &amp; they said it was ok. so I was a little disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have worn this fragrance since the mid 70&#x27;s, but in the cologne formula. I have problems with other perfumes; they end up smelling like fly spray!!! Obviously my own personal chemistry is totally failing me. Wicked Wahine is not a heavy fragrance....I adore this perfume.</li>
    <li> The scent is not as expected. There&#x27;s nothing flowery about it. But it was a speedy delivery.</li>
    <li> I would definitely recommend this product and this provider.  I was in Hawaii a few years ago and bought this.  I loved it and couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere.  Thank goodness I found it online.  Was delivered in 2 days.  I will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> My wife just loves this Wahine fragrance ever since our trip to Hawaii some 8 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;she always lights up when she gets a new bottle and I like seeing her happy&lt;br /&gt;we do frequent Hawaii and is an automatic purchase for us and it is great to be able to order it&lt;br /&gt;through Amazon when we need to&lt;br /&gt;great product  for the women</li>
    <li> My first introduction to this perfume was in Hawaii.  It is a beautiful scent and takes you back to the Hawaiian Islands.  The product was very well wrapped and a note was included of thanks.  Nice touch!</li>
    <li> Nothing smells more like Hawaii than this perfume!</li>
    <li> the original wicked wahine perfume has been a favourite of my wife for many years now.  I try to reorder before she is completely out of it.</li>
    <li> My family is liking this alot .it is very nice . Thank you very much.  Ken m</li>
    <li> been looking for this for my mother for years.  it was her best xmas present in years!!  It smells great!</li>
    <li> My favorite since I first found it in the 70&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with the speed in which I received my order and the careful detail to packaging and shipping!  I was hesitant to order online....but my fears were put to rest!  Thank you!....Wicked Wahine remains my absolute favorite scent!</li>
    <li> Ordered this for my mom who purchased it years ago in Hawaii. Great quality and a wonderful note enclosed from the seller. Very happy with product and will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I first bought this on my honeymoon in Hawaii.  Wearing it brings back lovely memories and every time I wear it people ask what I am wearing.  Very tropical without being citrusy.</li>
    <li> I, also, have used Wicked Wahine for over 30 years and when they discontinued it for several years I was utterly devastated and had a hard time finding something I could and would use, as most perfumes don&#x27;t mix well with my body chemistry.  You can&#x27;t imagine my elation when it came back on the market.  I never use anything else and hopefully it will continue to be manufactured for years to come. It&#x27;s wonderful!!</li>
    <li> I just personally did not care for the fragrance. I sent it back and am waiting for a refund.</li>
    <li> This smells AMAZING! I am obsessed with this scent, and this will be my new favorite! I am also surprised with how fast delivery was. I received this way sooner then I had expected. I have ordered from A Special Aloha before and was so very pleased. Such great service! Will continue to buy this Perfume ONLY from them  :)</li>
    <li> I used to purchase this when in Hawaii and had no idea it was still around.  With each spray, it takes you to the islands.  I have some extremely expensive perfume but, I go to this perfume on a daily basis.  Glad it is still available in it&#x27;s original form and still as wonderful as I anticipated.</li>
    <li> Wicked Wahine is my favorite perfume. I used to wear Vera Wang&#x27;s Sheer Veil. As much as I loved that, I prefer Wicked Wahine. I used to wear it as a young person...the pearlized lotion. I still get compliments on the clean smell of Wicked Wahine. Not to mention it&#x27;s $60 cheaper...always a plus.</li>
    <li> Hand written note was a nice touch.  My mom loves her perfume.  She had been looking for it for a while.</li>
    <li> This is the same perfume I discovered over 30 years ago.  I love it!  It is a sensual and light scent.</li>
    <li> My wife has enjoyed Wicked Wahine when first introduced to it in the 1960&#x27;s by a traveler to Hawaii. We have trouble buying it locally so I turned to Amazon and was able to obtain it. My wife even sprays it lightly on our pillows and sheets at night.</li>
    <li> Read the reviews was excited to get this cologne.  When I got it the scent is pretty heavy so I use very little otherwise nice cologne.  They send a personal note with your order which I think is a super nice touch.  Great company I have ordered other products from them to get my Hawaii fix.</li>
    <li> Really fast service.  I could pretend I was back in paradise within minutes of opening the bottle.  Thank you so much.  I will be back for sure!!!</li>
    <li> The perfume has a nice scent, but it seems a bit different than when I first purchased it years ago.</li>
    <li> I order this for my grandmother and she seems to like it</li>
    <li> This is for a more mature crowd.. NOT FOR YOUNGER CROWD.. To me it smells like the elder ladies in church, not that they smell bad. Its just a different style of scent.. Not for anyone under 50 years old</li>
    <li> The delivery was quick. The product is fabulous.</li>
    <li> I bought this brand of perfume for my wife during one of our trips to Hawaii.  We both love this fragrance.  When I found it on Amazon for such a great price I had to buy more for her.  When she wears it memories of our last trip return to me.</li>
    <li> Have always loved this perfume since I visited Hawaii for the first time in the 70</li>
    <li> A GIFT FOR MY MOTHER IN LAW. SHE LIVE.I HAWAII FOR A SHORT TIME AND LOVED THIS PERFUME, SO ME AND MY WIFE GOT IT FOR A GIFT. SHE LOVES ME AGAIN. THANK YOU.</li>
    <li> We originally bought it in Hawaii and my husband liked it so much that I continued to find it somewhere.  Now my husband found it at Amazon.  Thank you</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like this at all! Smell is strong n stays with you all day! Plus it smells like an old lady scent...not for me!!</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT MY FIRST BOTTLE OF THIS 30 YEARS AND IT HAS BEEN MY FAVORITE PEFUME EVER SINCE. I WAS SO HAPPY TO FIND IT HERE AND FOR A GREAT PRICE. IT CAME HERE TO UT.IN SUCH A SHORT TIME. THANKS</li>
