<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Soap works great....small but worth price</li>
    <li> very nice, leaves my face feeling clean. Long lasting. I will continue using this product, I bought a few extras.</li>
    <li> The soap came from another country, so, it doesn&#x27;t come over night. It was here well before the last date you should expect though. It is worth the wait. Anyone that has skin issues with soaps etc, this is the best solution I have found. My skin doesn&#x27;t itch when I shower with it, and I wash my hair with it. I use very expensive shampoos usually, but, I can quit buying shampoo altogether. My hair glows and my scalp feels great. The smell is fresh and clean with no residue left on the skin. Worth the wait and worth the price.</li>
    <li> We really like it.we use everyday.</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical at first because I have yet to find a face wash that gets all the gunk out of my pores. I tend to break out in my chin area and have clogged pores. I have been using this soap for about 3 weeks. The first few days my skin was a bit dry and I broke out a little but I am sure that was because the soap was bringing out all of that junk in my skin. Now that my skin has gotten used to it, I can see what a difference this is making on my skin. My pores are smaller and clearer. I will continue to use this and I am excited to try out their other products!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t look, clean or feel any different than the soap bars you&#x27;ll get from a corner store or Walmart...will not recommend.</li>
    <li> I use this in the morning with olay buffer thingy and my skin just loves it! rinse with cold water to lock in all the good minerals. My niece told me about this soap and her complexion is flawless. Leaves shin refreshed and not dry ( I have dry skin). Will not be without this soap!</li>
    <li> Mud soap is great for controlling oily skin without over drying, love it! I used to be able to find clay soaps locally, but not any more.</li>
    <li> Love it. It cleans my skin better than anything else I have used. My skin actually looks cleaner. Good product.</li>
    <li> works great. will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I tried a few of these product from a mall kiosk and decided to try amazon to see if I could find more. I wish I would&#x27;ve looked here first because the price is a lot cheaper than the mall for the same line of products. This soap leaves your skin feeling and looking clean. I have eczema and it has been clearing up with this product. I recommend using the whole line as I have become its biggest fan!!!!!</li>
    <li> I love Avani products.  The purifying Mud Soap is so gentle yet thorough cleaning of your face and body.  I received it so quickly and would reorder again.</li>
    <li> I would buy this again.It feels good on my face. If you cannot use regular soap use this.My skin feels smooth.</li>
    <li> I first tried this soap as a promotional buy in my local Sam&#x27;s Club.  I can no longer live without it.  It exfoliates your skin and moisturizes in one easy step on a daily basis.  I never used bar soap on my face before, but I do use this.  Love the other Avani products too.</li>
    <li> My face is very oily and with the first use I saw a big difference. Definitely I will keep using this product.</li>
    <li> I really like this soap, so does my husband. Gets you very clean. Great for the face.  Makes a mess in your soap dish :) looks like you have mud in it. Good product, but don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s worth the expense.</li>
    <li> Dead Seas Mud Soap works perfect for my face.  And this product is reasonably priced and it works well for my skin.  Dead sea salt has medicinal wonders and I feel it while using this soap.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this soap</li>
    <li> I first got this soap at the mall as a gift with purchase, and it&#x27;s one of the best products I&#x27;ve tried. I have acne prone skin, even as an adult, and this product greatly reduces breakouts. It cleans your face and leaves your skin feeling so soft and smooth, better than the gel cleansers. I&#x27;ve also used this soap when I&#x27;ve had a sty, and the next day there was no pain and it was half it&#x27;s size. Get this soap if you want a cleaner face and softer skin.</li>
    <li> I bought this soap for my husband who has issues with eczema and psoriasis.  It has been good for his skin and doesn&#x27;t dry or irritate like others can.</li>
    <li> These are really great soaps.  They also last a long time... weeks in fact used daily in shower.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say I look any younger but they smell good and I get cleaner.</li>
    <li> nothing special soap, after using it for  2 weeks, i have not notices any changes except that my skin gets very dry and itchy after shower. i have a rather sensitive skin prone to rushes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the sea mud soap from erno for 20 years. at $45 for a bar of soap after a while I was looking for another option. This soap makes your face feel clean. Of course its not as nice as erno and the smell is a little weird but cleans effectively.</li>
    <li> Avani Dead Sea Mud soap is very good, made my face feel very soft after use. I will purchase this product again. Recieved product in good condition and fast service.</li>
    <li> Happy with the product so far - awaiting stellar results!</li>
    <li> How many times are we told in our youth, &#x27;  you shouldn&#x27;t use bar soap.  I&#x27;d been with creams, Jafra the best, then Avon - ok, it worked, then came upon this product.  It has done such wonders to the hairline irritations that have come up in these later years, I absolutely love it &amp; will stick with it.  Offered my grandson the product also,  he said that it has helped clear his face of the &#x27;growing puberty&#x27; pimples.</li>
    <li> I love this soap, it removed my make-up and mascara with no problem, and it does not dry out my skin, love this Avanti dead sea purifying soap. Thank you</li>
    <li> I bought this Avani soap because I have Psoriasis.  My hands are always in water there for always RED and painful.  I also have Psorias on most of my body for 40 years.  I have tried everthing.  I do not want to give false hope that it will get rid of this painful disorder. To many people and manufactor&#x27;s do give false hope.  What I can say is that this soap has helped me to tame the red and painful burning from water.  I would hate to wash my hands.  I do have a medication salve that I use but I don&#x27;t have to use it all day long because my hands don&#x27;t scream with pain.  I have this soap in 3 bathrooms and in my kitchen.  Again, no false hope.  This soap tames the fire and burning, itching and that is enough for me to write a review.  i Hope this helps you too.  God Bless.</li>
    <li> This is the best soap that I have ever used. Removed all the impurities and dead skin. Feels clean and soft. Absolutely defferent than corner store soap. I will buy again and again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usally write reviews, but this product has really impressed me.  No one suggested this item to me, I just searched for facial products and went from previous customer reviews hoping that I would be pleased with it also.  I ordered the soap along with the anti-aging cream.  After just a few days of using I had coworkers telling me, \\&quot;something is different about you, your face is glowing\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know everyone&#x27;s experience is different, and while some products work great for one person, they don&#x27;t work for another.  All I can say is, \\&quot;this product works great for me\\&quot;!  My skin feels softer and more viberant than it has in years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am truly impressed with this product and will continue to use as long as I&#x27;m able to find it!</li>
    <li> Leaves skin soft and clean without iver drying.I love it so far and have recommended to my mother.♥ great buy great product</li>
    <li> This is the best soap to clean my face!  It doesn&#x27;t dry out my sensitive skin and cleans it very good.  Much better than the high costs of department store brands.  I will be using this from now on.</li>
    <li> The soap itself is amazing.  Skin feels great after you use it but this is waaay overpriced for the tiny bar of soap that was gone in less than a week.  There got to be something cheaper that works just as good.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it yet but love Avani products.  I need 9 more words to finish this review but what more can I say?</li>
    <li> The soap is quite good for cleansing the skin and keeping acne at bay too, it&#x27;s not a miracle cure but it helps greatly. It can be a little drying but you can fix that with a small amount if moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I know I am getting excited over a bar of soap, but this one is awesome! Leaves your skin smooth and clean. It is priceless for someone who travels a lot and prefers not to check in luggage. Since this is not a liquid you can take a bar of soap and use it to wash your body and hair.&lt;br /&gt;I also wash my face with it and it feels great. I do have very sensitive skin and spend too much money on top skin products, this one is great. Maybe one negative but not really, the smell is slightly soap-like, but what can you expect? It is still pretty good smell.</li>
    <li> made my son&#x27;s eczema worse, his skin began to crack and bleed after a week of using this.  save your money and just get some cetaphil .</li>
    <li> This product is just as good as the erno laszlo sea mud soap and is less expensive.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for saving me tons of money and getting great results !</li>
    <li> I have finished about 2/3 of this soap and I am finally seeing some improvements with breakouts.  It took a while, but I finally think this is the cleanser for me.</li>
    <li> My sister in law and I got our first bar of Avani Dead Sea Purifying Mud soap when we were on vacation in Hawaii. We both love it so much we had to have more. It leaves your skin so clean and soft, its unbelievable. We got our first bar in February of 2012 and we still have a little left, thats over a year and a half with one bar, using it every day. Love this product.</li>
    <li> Love the feel of this soap on  my face, even my husband tried it &amp; said it left his skin squeeky clean. It&#x27;s black in colour but lathers up nice &amp; feels good.</li>
    <li> The feel of this product is different than any soap I have used.  It does not lather.  I am using it in conjunction with a special body lotion and Aveno Oatmeal Bath.  My dry skin problem has resolved so this soap may be making a difference, but I do believe I am going to try another product which lathers for a more traditional feel in the bath.</li>
    <li> I found this product is just like the more expensive Dead Seas products but cost a lot less.  The only draw back is the shipping cost and the shipping time.  If you order make sure that you have enough product to last while waiting for your new shipment</li>
    <li> I got this for my mom who has tried everything for her eczema...perscription, steroids other natural soaps, you name it. This one by far worked the best, you could see it clearing up the next day! She loves it! Definitely worth the price :)</li>
    <li> Love this soap!!!! Goes on nice &amp; doesn&#x27;t leave filmy residue!!!! This is my 8th bar! Got 3 others using it as well!!!</li>
    <li> Love, Love, Love this bar soap!  Skin feels incredibly clean, but not dry.  I&#x27;ve used it on my face and body.</li>
    <li> It is excellent for sensitive skin. It gives your skin a beautiful natural tan. Clears black heads and pimples in a short period of time. It is also good for hair, it leaves it soft, very refreshing, unscented and darkens your natural hair color. I highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Love it.  that is all i have to say. . . . . . . . . . . .</li>
    <li> I have been using the dead sea mud soap for several years now. It is seriously the best facial soap I have ever used. My face is hydrated and very clean and fresh. No breakouts and no patches of skin that are dry or oily, etc. My face just feels so refreshed upon washing with it. I tend to do so in the morning at at night before bed. I would recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> gets ya clean but doesn&#x27;t do much for psoriasis</li>
    <li> I really can&#x27;t see any purifying occuring or have seen any changes to my skin while using the product. I do though prefer it to regualr soaps.</li>
    <li> This is a great soap for it&#x27;s intended purpose.  The only downside would be the price.  I highly recommend this soap!</li>
    <li> Like this soap. Seems helps me with my psoriasis, not sure because use other products.</li>
    <li> I thought it was a sulfuric mud soap. I wasn&#x27;t, but it still worked well, although it was a little hard to lather up. But I used the whole thing.</li>
    <li> Great soap. I wrote a comment on my last order. Still think they are great</li>
    <li> This is the only soap i use. feel clean and fresh after using it. Plus you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> After reading previous reviews of how much people liked this product, thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  Sorry to say it was not what I had hoped.  I was hoping for very smooth and hydrated skin, but turns out it didn&#x27;t give me anything more than Dove or Caress does.  I have tried other Avani products and really like them, but I will not buy this product again - will stick with Dove.</li>
    <li> For the girl of the house, she loves it</li>
    <li> wow it work on my skin and i noticed that my face was oil less and my face started to clear up from black head pore that very much avani product...ps these might be different to other people skin..</li>
    <li> I have pretty severe adult acne that will just not go away. While I&#x27;m not going to go about sporting the miracles of this soap, I will say that irritation of my body acne and the redness has gone down significantly, and that&#x27;s a HUGE plus in my book. The soap leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth, so even if you&#x27;re not fighting a skin ailment, it&#x27;s a good soap product. Smell is very earthy and pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used a few different brands of Dead Sea Mud soaps and this one in particular seems to have more scrubbing power, more roughness in the soap intended for getting rid of dead skin. So while it doesn&#x27;t make it my favorite brand because of my acne and irritation avoidance, it might be great for others.</li>
