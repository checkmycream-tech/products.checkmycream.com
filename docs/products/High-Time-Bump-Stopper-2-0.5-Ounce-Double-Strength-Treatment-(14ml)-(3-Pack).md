    <li> thank you as described ,fast shipping</li>
    <li> Fast service&lt;br /&gt;exactly as promised</li>
    <li> I have been using this for over 30 years! I tried all types of bump relievers and nothing works for me like this. Bump Stopper softens the hair so that if dose not penetrate the skin. It also conditions the skin.</li>
    <li> The best non script treatment available in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost 20yrs and I love it!! It really does help prevent razor bumps. As a person of color, this is the perfect after shave product for me.</li>
    <li> My fair skinned husband was experiencing ingrown hairs on his face and was told by a dermatologist to use a moisturizer. He did not want anything that was oily or greasy and found this in the shaving aisle.  That was six years ago and he is very pleased with the product and results. It softens the skin without being greasy.  It is sometimes difficult to find in stores and this offering is a good price with good service.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t found anything that works better yet. I easily get bumps on my face from shaving and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products to soften my skin after and in between shaves nothing works like this. This stuff keeps the skin feeling soft, reduces the itch between shaves and eliminates bumps within minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wish the product lasted longer. I find I&#x27;ll need to use it a few (3 or 4) times a day to prevent bumps</li>

    <li> I love this stuff.  No bikini line razor burn.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed...bumps away !!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried numerous aftershave lotions and razor bump prevention products and was convinced I&#x27;d have an acne chinstrap forever. It wasn&#x27;t until I tried High Time bump stopper (cream, not the liquid solution) that I was reminded what it&#x27;s like to have a smooth, bump-free face. Great for razor bumps and highly recommended for the African American community.</li>
    <li> The only product that works on me. I&#x27;ve been using for many years. It used to be sold at Wal Mart then disappeared then Walgreens then disappear. Now it is impossible to find it at your local store. I am happy to find it online. I shave on night time before going to bed then apply in all affected area. In the morning, my skill would not get all regular bumps. The product is not perfect, but is the only one that work better for razor bumps. I even tried prescribed medication, but Bump Stopper works much better.</li>
    <li> Really worked for him, recommend this product 100%.</li>
    <li> I love this product it is a good treatment for hair bumps on your face</li>
    <li> Only stuff that works for me. Use it after each shave or after each shower. Just hope it doesn&#x27;t give me cancer.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Great product, received in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> Been using it for years on my bikini region. Could not get on without it!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a very small tub and is therefor more expensive than it seems but it&#x27;s the only product I&#x27;ve found that really works.&lt;br /&gt;My skin would get little red bumps if I didn&#x27;t use it. So I use it a lot, as I shave that region a lot!!! It was recommended to be by a male friend who had sensetive skin and also said he had never come across a product even close to as good; and since I have recommended it personally to make and female friends.&lt;br /&gt;It works and that&#x27;s what really counts</li>
    <li> Good stuff. Overall happy.</li>
    <li> Amazing secret weapon against ingrown bikini line hair - works like a charm!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been steadily using Bump Stopper 2 for about seven years now and as a guy who gets ingrown hairs REALLY bad, nothing works better than this product.  I use Amazon to buy it in bulk because it&#x27;s sometimes out of stock at my local Walgreens, and when I need to shave, I NEED this product!  One application a day seems to work just fine, and keeps my neck nice and smooth.  It really is a lifesaver for anyone who get ingrown hairs and razor bumps.</li>
