      <li>She was right!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have super chapped lips or anything like that</li>
      <li>Enjoying the my new lip balm.</li>

      <li>know I am a bit more sensitive to it</li>
      <li>Soft sexy lips have always been in style.</li>
      <li>I like that it has some UV protection and especially that the ingredients are safe to use.</li>
      <li>should be more specific when listing products.</li>

      <li>When I first opened the package I could smell the lemon</li>
      <li>Buyers be aware.</li>

      <li>I recently ordered a ton of different EOS lip balms, and out of all the ones I tried, this was my absolute favorite!</li>
      <li>The product is also smooth once applied (not gritty), and lasts on my lips for a couple hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>It smells exactly like candy lemon drops, which were some of my favorite candy when I was little.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed that I use it more or less than other lip balms, but I do like how smoothly it applies.</li>
      <li>and after washing, this will leave you with a cute little container that is good for travel jewelry storage, a pill container, or any other small items!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love these and hard to find in stores</li>
      <li>But it feel, smells, and has the same benefits of the clear Maybelle Baby lips.</li>
      <li>After using it for several weeks I noticed a funny odor and black stuff around the edges.</li>

<li> The shape and size of Eos balms makes them difficult to lose in a pocket or bag and the container is useful when product is gone.</li>
<li> just what I expected Thank you!</li>
<li> Other than the scent of the sunscreen I like this balm.</li>
<li> other favorites:</li>
<li> So that&#x27;s a little</li>
<li> I had been using Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm for years but EOS has Burt&#x27;s Bees beat hands down!</li>
<li> what a waste.</li>
<li> I have the strawberry and used the mint in the past...</li>
<li> little tip: Once the lip balm is gone, you can use a nail clippers to cut out the \\&quot;spokes\\&quot; in the base of the container-</li>
<li> sorry about that.</li>

    <li> Addictive. I keep it in the car. The shape and size of Eos balms makes them difficult to lose in a pocket or bag and the container is useful when product is gone.</li>
    <li> Keep trying to find a lemon drop balm without spf 15. I thought this one was finally like that, as was nothing written about spf on sale page. but nope, it has the spf 15. Now I got two that will go in garbage. what a waste. should be more specific when listing products. sheesh. Second time now, been fooled by these eos lip balm listings. I dont send stuff back, i just chuck it. sorry about that. Not the best review. but I got just fine, so no problems on the shipping. No complaints there.</li>
    <li> This is great lipgloss.</li>
    <li> Fabulous smell! It&#x27;s so important to use a lip balm with SPF!</li>
    <li> I had never heard of EOS lip balm. My friend recommended it. She just went on and on about how wonderful it was so of course I had to try it! She was right! I had been using Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm for years but EOS has Burt&#x27;s Bees beat hands down! I had a sun blister on my lip. Burt&#x27;s Bees wasn&#x27;t healing it but EOS did. I *love* the lemon one! Awesome product!</li>
    <li> I discovered EOS lip balms in a beauty store years ago. Shortly after purchasing my first one, I became obsessed and had to have more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EOS lip balms in general are decent sized, and are supposedly more \\&quot;ergonomic\\&quot; to apply. I haven&#x27;t noticed that I use it more or less than other lip balms, but I do like how smoothly it applies. The product is also smooth once applied (not gritty), and lasts on my lips for a couple hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found that though this lip balm is difficult to carry in a front pants pocket, it fits well in a sweatshirt pocket, or is easy to find in my purse. This is the ONLY EOS lip balm that I have that does not \\&quot;click\\&quot; shut when I close it, and I actually find that it untwists and opens a LOT when it&#x27;s in my bag.  So that&#x27;s a little disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a lot of flavors of this lip balm, and Lemon Drop is a pretty good one!  It smells exactly like candy lemon drops, which were some of my favorite candy when I was little.  It also has SPF, which makes it an awesome choice for me when I&#x27;m out on a motorcycle.  It&#x27;s also not sticky at all, so I find that even with the breeze, my hair doesn&#x27;t stick to my lips!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little tip: Once the lip balm is gone, you can use a nail clippers to cut out the \\&quot;spokes\\&quot; in the base of the container- and after washing, this will leave you with a cute little container that is good for travel jewelry storage, a pill container, or any other small items!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My other favorites: [[ASIN:B00288SLXU EOS Smooth Sphere Lip Balm - Sweet Mint]] and [[ASIN:B00288WHVC eos Lip Balm Honeysuckle Honeydew 0.25 oz]]</li>
    <li> I  use my EOS Lemondroo all the time.  Not greasy at all.  I have all of the flavors and each one has been a winner</li>
    <li> I LOVE EOS prducts! Would recommend!</li>
    <li> Enjoying the my new lip balm. Tastes great and makes my lips super soft. I will be getting more of these.</li>
    <li> I recently ordered a ton of different EOS lip balms, and out of all the ones I tried, this was my absolute favorite! The scent, taste, and packaging all remind me of the Lemon Heads candies that I used to love as a kid. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Smells great but it just doesn&#x27;t hydrate my lips. I don&#x27;t have super chapped lips or anything like that but it just isn&#x27;t hydrating. Glides on like a wax and then kinda just dries, and I would have to reapply constantly.</li>
    <li> Great, moisturizing and has SPF. But it feel, smells, and has the same benefits of the clear Maybelle Baby lips. Just more yellow. Almost wish I didnt get it, since i have something so similar.</li>
    <li> One of the best lip balms i have tried, My gf has tried several of the eos brand balms and this is by far her favorite, tastes and smells amazing. Give it a try see if its for you :)</li>
    <li> is so cute and smooth</li>
    <li> Soft sexy lips have always been in style.</li>
    <li> I loved my EOS Lemon Drop SPF 15 Lip Balm Sphere and it tastes like fresh lemons for real!  I love the bright yellow and it cheers me up at work and smells so refreshing.  It keeps my lips from peeling and it also keeps my lipstick fresh longer.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Love these and hard to find in stores</li>
    <li> just what I expected Thank you!</li>
    <li> This is not only a tasty lip balm but also smells good and is very cute. I will get another to give to my daughter since it has the SPF to protect her lips also.</li>
    <li> I am allergic to most things with sunscreen so I am always looking for a product that I can use. Even the smell of sunscreen makes me nauseous so I read the reviews before purchasing and saw many people did not mind it. When I first opened the package I could smell the lemon but as soon as I swiped it on my lips I could smell nothing but sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know I am a bit more sensitive to it so I am giving it a try to see if the scent will fade. Other than the scent of the sunscreen I like this balm. I have the strawberry and used the mint in the past...but I will not buy the lemon again.</li>
    <li> I bought this at a local pharmacy about three months ago. After using it for several weeks I noticed a funny odor and black stuff around the edges. It had molded. Evidently the manufacturer is receiving complaints. Buyers be aware.</li>
    <li> Lovely smell of lemon pie! I love this sphere lip balm, it&#x27;s so easy to apply and to carry on the purse. I like that it has some UV protection and especially that the ingredients are safe to use. Plus it&#x27;s cute and has delicious flavors! I like the strawberry too and will try many others.</li>
    <li> Smells great! Altho you could get it for a cheaper price in store it&#x27;s way over priced here.</li>
