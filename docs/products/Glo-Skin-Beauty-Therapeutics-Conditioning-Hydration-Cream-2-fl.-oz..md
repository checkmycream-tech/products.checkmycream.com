    <li> Great product.  I&#x27;ve used it for years.  Great price here on Amazon!</li>
    <li> great easy to go on effective for daytime</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer! Love it &amp; not too expensive either!</li>
    <li> Everything this line makes is wonderful! I&#x27;ve been a big GLO fan for years and this hydration cream hits the spot for my dry skin. Once you try any product by GLO you will be a customer for life... They have great makeup as well</li>
    <li> I bought this skin cream for my sister who lives in Colorado.  Colorado is a very dry climate with a  bright sun, and after years of this climate, her skin was  dry, lined and dull.  After one month of using this hydration cream her skin is noticeably brighter and smoother! I did not see her since she started using this cream daily, and when I saw her last week, I was amazed!  I recommend anyone with mature skin to wash their skin every morning, spray a moisture spray, follow with a sun cream for the face, and finish with Glo Hydration Cream.  You will get amazing results.</li>
    <li> Skin feels moisturized with this product.  I usually only use a moisturizer with SPF, but never feel like my skin is soft.  I live in a very dry climate (Colorado) and have been using this cream in the morning before applying my SPF lotion and night after serum treatment.  I will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> I usually  love every Glo product. This was the 1st one ive used that i wouldnt say that about and the only reason being is that after application, and after the product  was absorbed,  it tended to &amp;#34;ball up&amp;#34; on the skin primarily when rubbing skin, or applying  make up. Basically i had to rub off the dried lotion on my skin or you could  visibly see it. Other than that, the product  did what its supposed  to do.</li>
    <li> I love the Glo line.  It has been great for my skin.</li>
    <li> Always enjoy using for winter! The product does not have a strong smell which I love.  Definitely will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I first started using the cream, because I won several bottles. When they ran out, I knew by then I had to continue using it. It is non-greasy and really gives my skin a nice smooth blemish free glow. Don&#x27;t run out...order several bottles at once. That is what I do now.</li>
    <li> this entire line of skin care is well worth the money I spent. I use this cream after I use trentinol or retinol. Excellent product for sensitive skin types too. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My face is very dry and this Hydration Cream works great. I use it in the morning and at night. It makes my face very soft and it has a nice smell too. Will definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> Does not hydrate, and as for the entire line, won&#x27;t be purchasing any more Glo skin care products.  Absolutely no difference in skin, if anything, it got worse.</li>
    <li> Love this Hydration Cream.  Keeps my face feeling soft all day long and no longer having flakey skin. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend the Conditioning Hydration Cream. It keeps my skin Hydrated during the dry winters in Colorado &amp; year round. Other great products they offer: The Pumpkin Scrub &amp; Oil-Free Moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I love this cream because it is the only one I can use that doesn&#x27;t have a bad affect on me.</li>
    <li> Smells really good. Soft on the skin. Doesnt cause breakouts. Glo therapeutics is my trusted brand.</li>
    <li> I have always thought that this is a great face cream and was glad to find it on Amazon.  I am not a fan of the design of the bottle, though.  That is a problem with the manufacturer, not the supplier.  Once the bottle gets to a certain point, you need to take out the pump, turn the bottle upside down, and let it drain into the cap.  Usually, you end up getting the last 25% of the bottle to drain into the cap.  I have been using this product for the last couple of years and pleased with the results.  I have friends that own salons that swear by this product line.  I only use the hydration cream, but they feature an entire line of products that may be of interest to you.  Feel free to explore their product line further.</li>
    <li> Great scent &amp; very moisturizing, very happy.</li>
    <li> I bought a sample of this after having a facial using gloTherapeutics. Wanted to continue to use at a more \\&quot;reasonable\\&quot; price. Love the product and love the Amazon price.</li>
    <li> When I put this on it had the feel of slickness like silicone, and wouldn&#x27;t absorb well, sat on top of my skin.When I used my normal powder Jane Iredale foundation or GLo Mineral foundation,all I had to do was rub my skin a little, and the foundation balled up in little balls on my skin. Felt aweful.</li>
    <li> My daughter is a repeat customer for this product.  She has sensitive skin and allergies, and it works for her.</li>
    <li> very light and makes my skin feel good.</li>
