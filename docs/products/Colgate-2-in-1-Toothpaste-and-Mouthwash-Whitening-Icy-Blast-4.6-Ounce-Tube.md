      <li>GREAT price in this package!  </li>
      <li>This is the best tooth paste I have ever used.</li>
      <li>It is the best ever!</li>
      <li>But, I love the product!!!</li>
      <li>The Colgate 2-in-1 toothpaste container is ideal for storing in the medicine cabinet on ship.</li>
      <li>(And I am also told it tastes good to kiss!)</li>
      <li>Great start to your morning.</li>
      <li>stuff works great, and does what I want done to my mouth when I brush my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great tasting toothpaste</li>
      <li>The mint flavor is great and having it in a squeeze bottle is so convenient to use.</li>
      <li>Good price.</li>
      <li>Nor do I think it does a particularly good job of freshening my breath like mouthwash.  </li>
      <li>think if you sell this kind of product, must have an expire date of&lt;br /&gt;two years.</li>
      <li>the taste is great, not overpowering but leaves the mouth feeling clean.  </li>
      <li>Love that it is in a bottle instead of a tube and</li>
      <li>Love this toothpaste/gel form.</li>
      <li>and it is the most refreshing experience.</li>
      <li>And my local grocery chain, the awesome W one, stopped carrying it !!!!!</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>I love everything about it</li>
      <li>LOVE THE SIZE</li>
      <li>I like this product as it&#x27;s refreshing and doesn&#x27;t foam up when using my electric toothbrush.</li>
      <li>I love this toothpaste and will keep on buying it forever</li>
      <li>Should differentiate more.</li>
      <li>The Icy Blast flavor is the best.</li>
      <li>, cause ends very quick</li>
      <li>AND SO EASY TO USE RATHER THAN A TUBE.</li>
      <li>i will keep on buying on amazon  because i cannot fine it in the stores</li>
      <li>Fortunately, Amazon has it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>So Amazon was a great place for me to stock up for the future.  </li>
      <li>I have never gotten excited over a toothpaste</li>
      <li>It makes my mouth feel so clean and fresh!</li>
      <li>My mouth feels really clean</li>
      <li>My mouth feels so clean after using it and it feels like a combination of tooth paste and mouthwash.</li>
      <li>leaves your mouth feeling clean and fresh.</li>
      <li>That said, I have used it now for several weeks, and to be honest I do not understand the five star reviews this product has received.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t sting, the minty flavor is just right.</li>
      <li>but my mouth really feels clean after brushing with it.</li>
      <li>I have not noticed that it seems to clean my teeth any better, or even as well, as regular toothpaste as it does not have much body to it.  </li>
      <li>Toothpaste in this type bottle can be stood upside down and the toothpaste is easy to put on the toothbrush, do not have to push the paste up the tube or roll the tube to get more of the toothpaste.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s way better than regular toothpaste.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is my second 6 pack, and given the chance, I&#x27;ll buy more.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m pretty sure this is the only place to buy it because I looked in every drugstore around town and could not find it...</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m very dissapointed.</li>
      <li>If you like thin, watery toothpaste in a stand up bottle, you are sure to love this.</li>
      <li>Just be sure to keep the bottle standing upside down and you will be able to use every last drop that is left in the bottle.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>I bought this toothpaste quite by accident, thinking it was a new tube design.  </li>
      <li>The first time I tried this toothpaste I was shocked at how deliciously REFRESHING it was!!</li>
      <li>As long as the bottle is kept upside down toothpaste will come out easily.</li>

<li> I did not really want an 8 pack</li>

    <li> I&#x27;m sorry but this item expires in two months.&lt;br /&gt;I think if you sell this kind of product, must have an expire date of&lt;br /&gt;two years. Not of two months. I&#x27;m sorry but I&#x27;m very dissapointed.</li>
    <li> I like this toothpaste a lot. It doesn&#x27;t sting, the minty flavor is just right. My mouth feels really clean and I agree with the other reviewer, seems to last a long time. It&#x27;s way better than regular toothpaste. I don&#x27;t have to use a mouthwash after I brush my teeth with this. I love everything about it and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever switch! I highly recommend this product. Trust me, once you try this product you&#x27;ll never go back to your tube toothpaste.</li>
    <li> I work on a ship at sea. Shopping is very limited. I really appreciate having the convenience of shopping online for products I use and need everyday. The Colgate 2-in-1 toothpaste container is ideal for storing in the medicine cabinet on ship.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m finding this toothpaste harder and harder to find on my supermarket shelves.  So Amazon was a great place for me to stock up for the future.  It&#x27;s a great tasting toothpaste and I like the whitening.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s toothpaste what can I say.</li>
    <li> I will always use this toothpaste! It is the best ever! It makes my mouth feel so clean and fresh! I use this with my electric toothbrush and everyday it feels like I just left the dentist!</li>
    <li> But, I love the product!!! And my local grocery chain, the awesome W one, stopped carrying it !!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ZOMG. Fortunately, Amazon has it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stuff works great, and does what I want done to my mouth when I brush my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my second 6 pack, and given the chance, I&#x27;ll buy more.</li>
    <li> I have a problem with foamy toothpaste. I like this product as it&#x27;s refreshing and doesn&#x27;t foam up when using my electric toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste and will keep on buying it forever i will keep on buying on amazon  because i cannot fine it in the stores</li>
    <li> It is a mouthwash/toothpaste because the consistency is that of mouthwash.  VERY thin for toothpaste.  The icy blast eludes me.  Tastes like regular toothpaste to me.  Whitening yet to be seen, but I JUST started using it.  If you like thin, watery toothpaste in a stand up bottle, you are sure to love this.</li>
    <li> This is the best tooth paste I have ever used. The mint flavor is great and having it in a squeeze bottle is so convenient to use. Just be sure to keep the bottle standing upside down and you will be able to use every last drop that is left in the bottle. My mouth feels so clean after using it and it feels like a combination of tooth paste and mouthwash. I find that it lasts a long time and it is the only toothpaste that I will ever use.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  Love that it is in a bottle instead of a tube and the taste is great, not overpowering but leaves the mouth feeling clean.

As long as the bottle is kept upside down toothpaste will come out easily.</li>
    <li> The first time I tried this toothpaste I was shocked at how deliciously REFRESHING it was!! I mean wow! I have never gotten excited over a toothpaste before!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has mouthwash in it, so its a 2 in 1 deal... I am not used to using mouthwash so maybe I wouldn&#x27;t have been so amazed but my mouth really feels clean after brushing with it. (And I am also told it tastes good to kiss!) Usually I don&#x27;t like the feel of the aftertaste toothpaste leaves in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and I&#x27;m pretty sure this is the only place to buy it because I looked in every drugstore around town and could not find it... I did not really want an 8 pack but now I will have Colgate 2 in 1 forever. Haha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good stuff, A+.</li>
    <li> I bought this toothpaste quite by accident, thinking it was a new tube design.  Only when I got it home did I realize it was a toothpaste/mouthwash combination product.  That said, I have used it now for several weeks, and to be honest I do not understand the five star reviews this product has received.  For me, it seems like watered down toothpaste, and when I add a little water to my toothbrush, the \\&quot;paste\\&quot; simply disappears into my brush.  I have not noticed that it seems to clean my teeth any better, or even as well, as regular toothpaste as it does not have much body to it.  Nor do I think it does a particularly good job of freshening my breath like mouthwash.  After I have finished this tube, I will return to regular toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Ordered Icy Blast and received something different (plain Colgate whitening).  Returning.</li>
    <li> Good price. Great start to your morning.</li>
    <li> GREAT price in this package!  Love this toothpaste/gel form.</li>
    <li> THE BEST!  LOVE THE SIZE AND SO EASY TO USE RATHER THAN A TUBE.</li>
    <li> I have been using this Toothpaste mouthwash combo for a year now and it is the most refreshing experience. The Icy Blast flavor is the best. leaves your mouth feeling clean and fresh.</li>
    <li> Taste too similar to other Colgate liquid gel products. Should differentiate more.</li>
    <li> The price is according WITH the number of producto ordered, Will be helpfull have each product bigger, cause ends very quick</li>
