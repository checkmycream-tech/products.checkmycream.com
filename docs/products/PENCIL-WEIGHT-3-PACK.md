<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Got these for my son after his OT suggested it for writing. They provide a nice, heavy weight for his pencil (can be used with pens too).  Easy to put on and off whatever writing utensil you are using. Once he got over it&#x27;s novelty which was a distraction, it has helped him with stability when writing.</li>
    <li> this cam right on schedule and it does work and am happy and will be using this for the school year for my little one.</li>
    <li> Love these weighted pencils and do do my students!</li>
    <li> These were quiet helpful to the children that I am working with who have fine motor difficulties that affect their ability to press down and maintain proper control of a pencil when printing.</li>
    <li> Helped my son (who has issues with the pressing of his pencil).  He used these and now he no longer needs to.</li>
    <li> IT WORKS!!! My son writes very lightly. This has helped him tremendously!!!!! Definitely WILL be purchasing another pack in the near future!!!!</li>
    <li> The pencil weight works very well and assists my son in holding down his pencil while he still learns to grip it properly.</li>
    <li> It did not help my child at all. Her grasp was fine but she writes lightly and has control problems. A fat pencil works just as well as this.</li>
    <li> Because of my hand tremor, I was unable to write legibly .  With these weights I&#x27;m slow, but I can now sign my name and  write short notes.  I&#x27;m pleased after being told several times to just put down an &amp;#34;X&amp;#34;.  How humiliating!</li>
    <li> our 1st grader is using this at home as his teacher uses it with him at school.  it was purchased so he could work on strengthing his grip</li>
    <li> MY SON HAS AUTISM AND HAS DIFFICULTY WITH FLOATING HIS ARM AND HAND UP OFF THE TABLE WHEN WRITING.  THIS&lt;br /&gt;PRODUCT WORKS TO HELP MAINTAIN SO HEAVINESS TO REMIND HIM TO HOLD HIS HAND DOWN.</li>
    <li> My son has a tremor in his writing hand and these were recommended by his OT to help control it.  His handwriting has improved greatly with the help of the weights.  I thought they were a little pricey, but it was well worth the investment.  They come in a 3-PK so we sent one to school and he uses one at home for homework, and then one for a spare.</li>
    <li> HOPING THEY HELP MY GRANDKIDS...</li>
    <li> I enjoyed learning about how this product can help children with hand/wrist weakness and how it improve their handwriting skills.</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast. The product was in great condition when it arived. Works for my kids who are learning how to right, they love using them. Helps the kids with sensory issues.</li>
    <li> Helped my Son start writing right away.  He was having such a hard time with his sensory strength etc.  That this really made a change at school and at home!</li>
    <li> we bought a pack of these, my son(9) has tremors. They seem to be working great. we use at home and at school</li>
    <li> My 7 year old son has Sensory Processing Disorder and struggles with his handwriting which is very common for children with SPD.  These pencil weights help him slow down and write more clearly.</li>
    <li> They seem to work good, I don&#x27;t know that they helped my son much with his hand writing but that doesn&#x27;t mean they won&#x27;t help the next child. I went to school for OT and I have seen weights work for other children.</li>
    <li> This grip attaches to an average pencil using two very heavy duty rubber gaskets. It&#x27;s adequately secure, and best yet, you can sharpen the pencil without needing to take the device apart to do it. You can also use a grip toward the writing end and still have the weight above it, whatever your kid prefers. Great price point on this too!</li>
    <li> I love these for children, they&#x27;re a lifesaver</li>
    <li> Just what the therapist ordered... My son has only started using it, and it seems to be helping him already.</li>
    <li> I love this grip it helped my daughter and my husband it is a great product!</li>
    <li> My grandson&#x27;s OT suggested this since he exerts unnecessary pressure when writing. It helped in his OT sessions so we&#x27;re using it at school and home now.</li>
    <li> I buy these for my students at school who have difficulty with handwriting. I have also given them to parents/teachers on occasion for students who have significant problems and/or qualify for occupational therapy. They provide the needed pressure for students to write legibly, with the correct size and spacing, and so that you can see the lead. I have always used this company and will buy from them again should the need arises.</li>
    <li> This helps my son with some fine motor challenges VERY much, it&#x27;s amazing!! My son has alot of sensory challenges and these are perfect!</li>
    <li> My mother is in her 90s and has developed a tremor.  Her handwriting was getting so bad that the bank even refused one of her checks because her signature wasn&#x27;t legible.  I bought her these weights and they have made all the difference.  Her handwriting isn&#x27;t perfect but it&#x27;s much improved. There are three weights in the set and I put two of them on pens and one on a pencil, and they all fit just fine.  A big help.</li>
    <li> Very happy with these.  Very sturdy!</li>
    <li> as described, fast shipping.</li>
    <li> A teacher at my son&#x27;s school gave him one of these weights to use at school.  We bought these so he could use these at home.  It helps my son write so much better!</li>
    <li> These help a little bit to steady my son&#x27;s hand.</li>
    <li> These have been useful with the children who have a hard time with pencil grip and pressure.</li>
    <li> Worked well for my son with mild cerebral palsy while learning how to write. I used to have to apply pressure to his hand, but these allowed him to write independently. Eventually after much practice and a year of school, my son no longer needs these.</li>
