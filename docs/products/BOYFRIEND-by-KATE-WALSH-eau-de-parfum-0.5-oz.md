### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This is perfect if you&#x27;re going for something with a hint of musk, and a touch of sweetness.</li>
      <li>But this smells so great!</li>
      <li>Very good my wife loves it</li>

      <li>Very satisfied.</li>

      <li>My favorite fall perfume!</li>
      <li>I love this scent!</li>
      <li>Amazing scent.</li>
      <li>Ugh, amazing perfume, thank you Kate Walsh.</li>
      <li>My Mom decided she liked the smell</li>
      <li>It reminds me of a warm cinnamon bun.   </li>
      <li>and she was so excited to get it!!  </li>
      <li>I also can&#x27;t stand sweet perfumes, but this is the most absolutely perfect blend of sweet and spice.</li>
      <li>and it is the most amazing scent.</li>
      <li>Even though it comes on S T R O N G when you first spray it, it mellows beautifully into a deeper, richer, exotic scent.</li>
      <li>A yummy perfume that when I wear it I get so many compliments.</li>
      <li>Everyone compliments me on it :)</li>
      <li>Just ordered the pulse point oil, and based on reviews here &amp; elsewhere, I expect it to be even better than the EdP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t believe it was authentic.</li>
      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>This is my favorite perfume.</li>
      <li>It makes me think of one of my best friends that I graduated with back in May.</li>
      <li>I love how this perfume smells.</li>
      <li>Love this scent</li>
      <li>I sense the amber, but Boyfriend is more vanilla than amber.</li>
      <li>I have gotten many compliments on this perfume and questions on what I am wearing - from guys</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this perfume.</li>
      <li>\\&quot;I love it, but I love it for me, not you!\\&quot;</li>
      <li>Boyfriend strikes me as a &#x27;your skin but better&#x27; fragrance.</li>
      <li>It could be strong for some, but for those that love his scent, this is the perfect parfum for women to wear without actually wearing his.</li>
      <li>I know this is not the original but some very, cheap concocted knock-off and paid $60</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve put it on my shelf and not used it since I got it because I feel it is too strong for me to wear.</li>
      <li>, they&#x27;re way too strong and I feel like they burn my nose hairs.</li>
      <li>My first impression is warm &amp; woody.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t even smell like it, and te bottle is cheap and the cap fell apart.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so rare to find a perfume I love like this.</li>
      <li>I just purchased Billionaire Boyfriend too because I loved the first Boyfriend so much!</li>
      <li>however, Boyfriend seem to me to be like the original Givenchy Hot Couture (#1) without the overly sweet fruit on top.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really sweet, cinnamon-y almost.</li>
      <li>The vanilla is noticeable but it&#x27;s not a foodie vanilla, although it&#x27;s a bit sweet.</li>
      <li>I just love it so much I take it everywhere with me.  </li>
      <li>I was delighted with the muskiness of man&#x27;s cologne mixed with garden flowers.</li>
      <li>I love the smell, I only use it on special occasions (and there are many of them)</li>
      <li>Her new favorite.</li>
      <li>This fragrance evokes memories of that time after he has left for the day--when she gently awakes in a bed that&#x27;s still warmly redolent of \\&quot;boyfriend.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An alluring balance of vanilla, jasmine blossoms, and an accord of amber is set against the sensual scents of a man, including a light musk and a shimmer of fresh woods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It has three phases - Great, Cozy, Skin.</li>
      <li>Skin musk, golden amber, vanilla woods</li>
      <li>Plum, Myrrh, Night Blooming Jasmine, Benzoin Tears, Skin Musk, Golden Amber, Vanilla</li>
      <li>Skin musk, golden amber, vanilla woods    </li>
      <li>right.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Regardless, Boyfriend was nominated for a 2010 FiFi Award and rightly so.</li>
      <li>Not overly heavy or cloying, it lingers throughout the day and pleasantly scents your hair and clothes.</li>
      <li>however, Boyfriend seem to me to be like the original Givenchy Hot Couture (#1) without the overly sweet fruit on top.ter than the EdP.     NOTES   Top: Dark plum, myrrh  Heart:</li>
      <li>Good price too, after doing a little shopping around.</li>
      <li>However, this perfume is very, very strong, and actually smells to me like just a cologne, very musk-heavy.</li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>I my first time that i have the parfum</li>
      <li>doesn&#x27;t smell nothing I thought I am going to have he same lovely smell like the BF body lotion</li>
      <li>Came when they said it would, was exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>Lighting fast shipping!</li>
      <li>Boyfriend is sweet vanilla and softly spiced with cinnamon.  </li>
      <li>I am prone to headaches, and almost always buy the lotion version of a perfume because that is strong enough for me.  </li>
      <li>Not with this, because the dry down is so beautiful.  </li>
      <li>I really miss him.</li>
      <li>By the 4th hour, I was ready for a fresh-up.</li>
      <li>I think you really have to like vanilla to like Boyfriend.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, Boyfriend has a very lived-in, causal, at-home quality about it.</li>
      <li>I would advise not to buy this product if you want the real thing.</li>
      <li>I wish there were bigger bottles still available.</li>
      <li>Really it is pitiful that this goes on.</li>
      <li>Boyfriend almost has a texture of smooth anti-perspirant, which probably makes no sense to review readers, but it&#x27;s likely that powder.</li>
      <li>I also have the pulse point roller oil for touchups on my wrist and neck throughout the day but dont really need it -</li>
      <li>NOT the real thing.</li>
      <li>Recently laundered sheets, which are clean but a bit crumpled by now.</li>
      <li>I AM VERY UPSET as have been wearing BOYFRIEND for some time, but they did not have it in stock any longer where I normally purchase it so went searching on Amazon.</li>
      <li>The only one I can&#x27;t get away from and is my ultimate favorite is Prada.</li>
      <li>I was expecting it to be a little more \\&quot;manly\\&quot; but was very surprised.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried something similar - in the luxe market - that I can&#x27;t put my finger on right now.</li>
      <li>My girlfriend was looking for a new scent at sephora, and when I smelled it</li>
      <li>It came brand new.</li>
      <li>The vendor was very professional.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a sweet combination of musk and sweetness that is redolent of afternoons spent in bed with your lover of choice.</li>
      <li>I love the smell of incense, and this reminds me of Catholic mass incense when it dries down.  </li>
      <li>The spray is stronger and much more masculine when you first spray it out, the oil is much more softer and feminine although the base notes are exactly the same.  </li>
      <li>I had hoped for something that would be very gender-neutral and make me feel as if I was wearing a boyfriend&#x27;s shirt, or some similar feeling.</li>
      <li>But I really wish this would last longer.</li>
      <li>To me the scent is very incense like and mysterious and I have never smelled anything like it.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I rec&#x27;d this perfume as a sample with something I ordered and it is the most amazing scent. I was expecting it to be a little more \\&quot;manly\\&quot; but was very surprised. I get compliments constantly.</li>
    <li> Boyfriend is sweet vanilla and softly spiced with cinnamon.  It reminds me of a warm cinnamon bun.   IMO,  it is very similar to Organza Indecence.  Love this scent and I think it&#x27;s a shame that it was discontinued.</li>
    <li> Lighting fast shipping! Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Came when they said it would, was exactly what I wanted. Love it</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so rare to find a perfume I love like this. The only one I can&#x27;t get away from and is my ultimate favorite is Prada. But this one is smokier, subtler. Ugh, amazing perfume, thank you Kate Walsh.</li>
    <li> Love it on my girlfriend!</li>
    <li> I can see from the reviews that my experience is atypical, but I did want to leave feedback:    I had hoped for something that would be very gender-neutral and make me feel as if I was wearing a boyfriend&#x27;s shirt, or some similar feeling. I figured from the reviews that this would be a light scent, vaguely old-spice-y, somewhat toned down for. However, this perfume is very, very strong, and actually smells to me like just a cologne, very musk-heavy. The amount that I get on my finger from squeezing down the spray can be smelled for hours afterwards. I&#x27;ve put it on my shelf and not used it since I got it because I feel it is too strong for me to wear.</li>
    <li> My favorite fall perfume! Everyone compliments me on it :)</li>
    <li> got this for my wife&#x27;s birthday. She loves it. Her new favorite. Good price too, after doing a little shopping around.</li>
    <li> I love how this perfume smells. It&#x27;s a sweet combination of musk and sweetness that is redolent of afternoons spent in bed with your lover of choice. Not overly heavy or cloying, it lingers throughout the day and pleasantly scents your hair and clothes.</li>
    <li> It has been a while since I have fallen for a perfume. I have fallen for this one, I already got compliments on it, so has my mother. This is a good sign!</li>
    <li> I received and used a sample of Kate Walsh&#x27;s Boyfriend. I was delighted with the muskiness of man&#x27;s cologne mixed with garden flowers. It could be strong for some, but for those that love his scent, this is the perfect parfum for women to wear without actually wearing his.</li>
    <li> I got a knock off perfume. NOT the real thing. Doesn&#x27;t even smell like it, and te bottle is cheap and the cap fell apart.</li>
    <li> I wish there were bigger bottles still available. I love this scent!</li>
    <li> Not what i expected - but others might like it.. Too small for the price ~</li>
    <li> I was specting a better perfum , but smell like water , I&#x27;m really unhappy ,!so for mi , this perfum is not the original , and I was expected the order , because this is fake ,!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume. It blends with my chemistry. A yummy perfume that when I wear it I get so many compliments. I just wish that it was not discontinued. It is so very hard to find now.</li>
    <li> This seller did not sell me BOYFRIEND but some gross, cheap imitation that smells nothing like it! I AM VERY UPSET as have been wearing BOYFRIEND for some time, but they did not have it in stock any longer where I normally purchase it so went searching on Amazon. I know this is not the original but some very, cheap concocted knock-off and paid $60+ dollars for this tiny little bottle of it. Really it is pitiful that this goes on. I have never had this happen.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately the bottle has a broken spray nozzle so it&#x27;s work to try and get anything out of the bottle.</li>
    <li> It is called BOYFRIEND because it is known to attract men.  It works like CatNip with them. Just try it and you will see!</li>
    <li> I had a sample of this parfum and really loved the smell.  My Mom decided she liked the smell so I ended up buying her a bottle from Sephora.  Sephora no longer carries the Boyfriend and my Mom&#x27;s birthday was coming up.  I found it on Amazon for her and she was so excited to get it!!  My Mom is 86!!  If you like a musky smell, this is definitely a great smell.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this perfume. I bought a small bottle to try it and will be purchasing the large bottle soon.</li>
    <li> I got a bunch of makeup for Christmas with a bunch of sample perfumes. I sprayed this on my pillows and bed sheets it took all of the small sample bottle. But this smells so great! It makes me think of one of my best friends that I graduated with back in May. I really miss him. This smell sorta reminds me of him.</li>
    <li> Boyfriend&lt;br /&gt;She inhales his shirt, taking in the scent of the man she loves. It lingers on her clothes, her sheets, her hair--all over. Imprinted on her body and in her mind, it radiates within her, filling her with feelings of warmth and desire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actress Kate Walsh wanted to capture the scent of a guy on a girl: a man&#x27;s cologne mixed with perfume, the smell that lingers on the skin. This fragrance evokes memories of that time after he has left for the day--when she gently awakes in a bed that&#x27;s still warmly redolent of \\&quot;boyfriend.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An alluring balance of vanilla, jasmine blossoms, and an accord of amber is set against the sensual scents of a man, including a light musk and a shimmer of fresh woods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notes:&lt;br /&gt;Dark Plum, Myrrh, Night Blooming Jasmine, Benzoin Tears, Skin Musk, Golden Amber, Vanilla Woods.&lt;br /&gt;Style:&lt;br /&gt;Sensual. Vanilla. Amber.&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> My girlfriend was looking for a new scent at sephora, and when I smelled it I said \\&quot;I love it, but I love it for me, not you!\\&quot; I was sold. It&#x27;s really sweet, cinnamon-y almost. Very deep. I hate florals, they&#x27;re way too strong and I feel like they burn my nose hairs. This is perfect if you&#x27;re going for something with a hint of musk, and a touch of sweetness. I also can&#x27;t stand sweet perfumes, but this is the most absolutely perfect blend of sweet and spice. Your boyfriend will wish he smelled this great.</li>
    <li> Boyfriend strikes me as a &#x27;your skin but better&#x27; fragrance. My first impression is warm &amp; woody. Thankfully, the florals and fruits are not prominent. The vanilla is noticeable but it&#x27;s not a foodie vanilla, although it&#x27;s a bit sweet. I sense the amber, but Boyfriend is more vanilla than amber. I find Boyfriend to be powdery, but not in a girly way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have seen reviews referencing Boyfriend as a musk, and I do sense musk, like the skin musks from the 70s. However, I wouldn&#x27;t classify Boyfriend as a musk. Instead, I&#x27;d classify Boyfriend as a woody oriental, maybe an oriental vanilla. Boyfriend has a benzoin note, which seems vanilla-like to me, plus it&#x27;s got vanilla in the base. I think you really have to like vanilla to like Boyfriend. Thankfully I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, Boyfriend has a very lived-in, causal, at-home quality about it. I&#x27;m picking up an impression of cotton, probably that powder. Boyfriend almost has a texture of smooth anti-perspirant, which probably makes no sense to review readers, but it&#x27;s likely that powder. Recently laundered sheets, which are clean but a bit crumpled by now. ;) That&#x27;s the impression.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully, Boyfriend does not remind me of boys, whether or not they are friends. I think many fumies would be bored, but Boyfriend is atypical for the mass market and suits me. I&#x27;ve tried something similar - in the luxe market - that I can&#x27;t put my finger on right now. I&#x27;ll update the review with the name of the similar fragrance once I remember it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one downside with Boyfriend is longevity. It has three phases - Great, Cozy, Skin. By the 4th hour, I was ready for a fresh-up. At this price, I can handle that. But I really wish this would last longer. It would be 5* if it did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless, Boyfriend was nominated for a 2010 FiFi Award and rightly so. I still love it! I&#x27;m testing a hand-decanted EdP in an atomizer. It&#x27;ll hardly be enough. Just ordered the pulse point oil, and based on reviews here &amp; elsewhere, I expect it to be even better than the EdP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTES&lt;br /&gt;Top: Dark plum, myrrh&lt;br /&gt;Heart: Night blooming jasmine, benzoin tears&lt;br /&gt;Base: Skin musk, golden amber, vanilla woods&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE&lt;br /&gt;This is not the fragrance I remember ... however, Boyfriend seem to me to be like the original Givenchy Hot Couture (#1) without the overly sweet fruit on top.ter than the EdP.     NOTES   Top: Dark plum, myrrh  Heart: Night blooming jasmine, benzoin tears  Base: Skin musk, golden amber, vanilla woods    UPDATE   This is not the fragrance I remember ... however, Boyfriend seem to me to be like the original Givenchy Hot Couture (#1) without the overly sweet fruit on top.</li>
    <li> love this!! cant believe there going to stop making it.. why are they getting rid of a good thing</li>
    <li> This is a little small, but it does say how much you get. It came brand new. I love the smell, I only use it on special occasions (and there are many of them) it lasts for a while.  I am a person who loves perfume, when they smell...right. So this I would recommend to everyone, it is a great smelling perfume.</li>
    <li> Very good my wife loves it</li>
    <li> It smells really good.</li>
    <li> This scent makes any woman beautiful.  The vendor was very professional.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a scent like this all my life.  I have finally found it! I love the smell of incense, and this reminds me of Catholic mass incense when it dries down.  It is really a beautiful, haunting fragrance.  Even though it comes on S T R O N G when you first spray it, it mellows beautifully into a deeper, richer, exotic scent. I am prone to headaches, and almost always buy the lotion version of a perfume because that is strong enough for me.  Not with this, because the dry down is so beautiful.  The scent lingers and lasts all day.  I have gotten many compliments on this perfume and questions on what I am wearing - from guys, girls both!  I spray it all over in the morning before I leave for work, on my skin, clothing, even in my hair and I can still smell it when I&#x27;m driving home in the evening.  I also have the pulse point roller oil for touchups on my wrist and neck throughout the day but dont really need it - I just love it so much I take it everywhere with me.  Just a note: the spray perfume is a little bit different from the oil.  The spray is stronger and much more masculine when you first spray it out, the oil is much more softer and feminine although the base notes are exactly the same.  To me the scent is very incense like and mysterious and I have never smelled anything like it.  I just purchased Billionaire Boyfriend too because I loved the first Boyfriend so much!</li>
    <li> The bottle that I was sent DOES NOT smell like Boyfriend at all.  It has a cheap, horrible smell.  I would advise not to buy this product if you want the real thing.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance!!</li>
    <li> I my first time that i have the parfum but I am a little disappoint because is nor perfume at all doesn&#x27;t smell nothing I thought I am going to have he same lovely smell like the BF body lotion but is nothing at all is like I spraying water which is sad thanks</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t believe it was authentic. Smelled too much like alcohol..dissappointed :(</li>
    <li> Way too expensive for such a small bottle.</li>
    <li> Boyfriend Eau de Parfum - wow I love this stuff.  Amazing scent. Near perfection.</li>
