      <li>Enjoying it.</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s a so so moisturizer but after many weeks I don&#x27;t notice any difference in my skin.  </li>
      <li>The Renewal cream is enriched with minerals to hydrate your skin for a healthy glow.</li>

      <li>and I will be buying more here.</li>

      <li>and I have purchased many moisturizers to try to help combat that</li>

      <li>100% satisfied.</li>
      <li>My skin gets very dry in the winter, and the moisturizing effects of NuNutrients Renewal Cream is the best.</li>
      <li>but I know that there is a high percentage chance that it will do me more harm than good.</li>
      <li>So far I have felt great smoother skin after use.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t tried their other products yet, but after my wonderful experience with this one I&#x27;m going to explore their line.</li>
      <li>First of all let me just say, I love the smell!</li>
      <li>This is a great moisturizer that makes my skin silky smooth and soft.</li>
      <li>I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin, so any products, no matter how effective they claim to be, are touch and go with me!</li>
      <li>I find this product easy to use and a joy, actually.</li>

      <li>, it is great to see such a noticeable result.</li>
      <li>(Even though I only used it once, lol.).</li>
      <li>This serum has a cooling property that I enjoy a lot.</li>
      <li>This product is one of my favorites because it leaves my skin feeling smooth, and I&#x27;ve gotten compliments on my skin from my family.</li>
      <li>Anyway, I ended up using it on my face once and my friend told me I had to get my own, because I was using too much of hers</li>
      <li>I would recommend using this to anyone looking for a product that will keep their skin hydrated, smooth, and youthful.</li>
      <li>and I use it on my hands throughout the day to keep them supple, smooth and protected from winter weather.</li>
      <li>I have used it for many moons and it has done me only good.</li>
      <li>The best parts are that this cream doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling oily and it has a light fresh scent to it unlike some of those other creams that have that chemical smell to them.</li>

      <li>She has very pretty skin and always looks blemish free.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have a friend who recommended this to me to try.  She has very pretty skin and always looks blemish free.  I decided to take her word and try it out myself.  The Stem Cells in the product intrigued me.  I already knew the power of stem cells and wanted to see if it made a difference in this renewal cream.  I swear that it does!  Since using it, my skin looks more youthful, clear and soft. My face has not looked this good since I was a teenager.  It also leaves no oily residue and smells nice.  Not too strong or girly, just a clean fresh scent.  Try this out, NuNutrients line of products is a product line that you can trust.</li>
    <li> I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin, so any products, no matter how effective they claim to be, are touch and go with me! I discovered Nu Nutrients when a friend of mine started using their line of skin care products. She swore by this line, saying she used the renewal cream every night before she slept. She does have lovely skin, so I was intrigued, but like I said, my skin is sensitive so I wasn&#x27;t sure about trying it on my skin, because I hadn&#x27;t heard of the brand, and had not done any reasearch on it. So I decided to try a little on the backside of my hand and see what happens in a day or 2. First of all let me just say, I love the smell! Its like a fresh, clean scent it wasn&#x27;t too strong. After 2 days I had no horrible reaction so I asked my friend if I could try some for my face. Like I said I loved the smell and it softened the backside of my hand. Its winter where I am and this is just what I needed for my dry scaly winter hands! Anyway, I ended up using it on my face once and my friend told me I had to get my own, because I was using too much of hers (Even though I only used it once, lol.). She is so stingy about this cream, I am surprised she let me use any! I asked her to order some for me because she has prime and she got a discount code so i got from her at a great price and I apply it every morning and night after washing my face and I use it on my hands throughout the day to keep them supple, smooth and protected from winter weather. I love this and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> If you run down the ingredients, there is a list of natural supplements and it&#x27;s nice to see that you can rely on this product to give you stuff that won&#x27;t bother your skin or poison your body. naturabest</li>
    <li> I live in a dry climate and it&#x27;s tough on skin for sure. I have had to deal with it as I was not raised in that sort of weather patterns and it takes some getting used to for sure. I started to use this product and it has really helped me through my transition of moving here from the North East where it is wet and humid a lot of the time, easier to keep my skin moist. naturabest</li>
    <li> Stem cells work here. My skin is rejuvenated. I can notice that the skin is fuller around my cheeks and my eyes, like the old skin has flaked off and left the new stuff to grow stronger. This product is one of the first things I use in the morning and for the past month and a half I have used a dab and it has done me very well. naturabest</li>
    <li> Works really well.  My wife and I use this cream and if you use it consistently then you can really feel the difference.  Also you don&#x27;t have to use a lot at one time so it lasts quite a while.</li>
    <li> NuNutrients is an excellent cream that rejuvenated my skin so that it is appearing young, and even more healthy than before! I use this regularly. This actually makes me to feel my skin very smooth and appear fresh while I wake up. After continuous use of this cream, many of my friends have really commented on my skin and my appearance that I look shiny and &amp;#34;glowing&amp;#34; and I actually never felt shy in confessing the reason behind this! I am feeling really nice in using this as it is not oily at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m amazed at how well this product works. I bought some for my mother whom has wrinkles around her eyes from eye surgery. After using this the skin around her eyes looked so much smoother and younger. She was so happy with the results she bought more.</li>
    <li> I bought this facial cream just to try it out and I absolutely loved it. It smelled great, my skin felt great, and a little went a long way. I am definitely going to repurchase this item.</li>
    <li> Seeing seaweed and alpine rose on this gives me a smile because I know that these products are all natural. I used to work in a supplement store so I am familiar with these things, and these types of ingredients have healing properties that work and come from the ground, so they are from this earth. That is enough for me and if you want to get results give this a shot. naturabest</li>
    <li> This does not irritate my skin and so far has done a decent job of stimulating my skin cells, giving me a good glow. I have used many other creams and serums in the past and some of them honestly irritate me and it&#x27;s horrible. This one is not one of those and I need to give it the thumbs up, I hope it sticks around. naturabest</li>
    <li> Compared to the Eucerin night cream, at less than half the price, it feels like I must &amp;#34;drag&amp;#34; it over my skin. This is disappointing as reviewer comments on how it glides on greatly influenced my purchase. It&#x27;s a so so moisturizer but after many weeks I don&#x27;t notice any difference in my skin.  I&#x27;ve had better results with Eucerin moisturizer in a jar. It&#x27;s ten dollars for a jar twice the size of this.</li>
    <li> Lots of compliments from people. I can&#x27;t even field them all. It&#x27;s even disconcerting, considering what I looked like before. It wasn&#x27;t so bad, right? Well whatever the reason, I look great now. My skin feels nice and smooth and I look like I&#x27;m five years younger. The serum&#x27;s rejuvenating formula really helps keep my face looking resiliant and better than ever before. naturabest</li>
    <li> I live in a dry climate so that takes it toll on my skin from time to time. After researching skin care products I came across this gem and decided to try it out. It works well and is great for your skin. Check it out for yourself.</li>
    <li> This facelift serum has reduced my aging a bit. My wrinkles have slowly started to disappear and I am pretty happy wth what is going on. I put it on each morning and it is easy to apply and a very fast acting product, to me. I think it&#x27;s a great serum that I should continue to use and I will be buying more here. Recommended.</li>
    <li> Very fast acting! I only used it for a couple weeks before noticing that my skin has tightened up a bit, or at least has the look of it. Very pleased with results. I have been using this for a while only a short while and it has worked in a manner that is faster than most other products I have used in the past.</li>
    <li> Zero irritation. I have had problems with this kind of stuff in the past. My skin is actually pretty easily irritated by random things, so it sucks when I want to use a skin product but I know that there is a high percentage chance that it will do me more harm than good. But this so far has worked well and I have been pleasantly surprised. My skin is looking nicer and glowier, and I have not experienced any negative side effects. naturabest</li>
    <li> Have only been using it for a few days so no magical overnight change but I like the product and will continue using it.</li>
    <li> Other products like this, other facial serums are sticky or oily. But not this one. I have only experienced a decent, easy to use product under this banner. Recommended.</li>
    <li> Trust in this product. I have used it for many moons and it has done me only good. naturabest</li>
    <li> Natural ingredients in this product have made me smile. I hate how we live in a world of chemicals now, but this stuff is all natural. Kudos. naturabest</li>
    <li> I had some various nicks and such on my face, I thought I might use a rejuvenating serum/cream on my face and found this at a reasonable price online. Turns out to be one of the more smart choices I have made. Lucky I found it because for the past few weeks my skin has looked better and better each day. Great ingredients and easy to apply. naturabest</li>
    <li> Skin is impressive. Just ask people. They keep asking me about this product, or at least what I am doing to my face. I need to put it on a t shirt or something. naturabest</li>
    <li> Since I travel a lot, my skin is very dry. Its help me skin to keep at best hydrate condition. I just love this cream!</li>
    <li> The dispenser is easy to use and really I think cuts down on some of my prep time each morning before going to work. I am shaving off maybe secons just because of the convenience but it really adds up. I find this product easy to use and a joy, actually. I like seeing my face -look improve so I am happy to use it. Would recommend it to anyone looking to spiff up their facelift game a bit.</li>
    <li> All natural ingredients in this. I am glad to see this product available for use because I have been using lots of facial products lately, like the last fifteen years or so. And some of them are downright disgusting with the chemicals and bad stuff in there. This one is effective so I expected it to have the same kind of thing going on, but that&#x27;s not true. I noticed that it has natural ingredients and is helpful to my look.</li>
    <li> Too early to tell if it will work or not.</li>
    <li> Battle crows feet Battle crows feet with this product. So far I have felt great smoother skin after use. Great price, great product.</li>
    <li> Loving the ingredients. All natural and nothing to fear. I have personally looked each one up and it is all clear--works like a charm and will not harm skin. naturabest</li>
    <li> Feels great on my face. This serum has a cooling property that I enjoy a lot. I started using it a few weeks ago and my skin has improved a lot in the meantime. I credit this product. naturabest</li>
    <li> This cream surprised me because I thought it would give me breakouts because of its thick texture, and it has not. I suffer from acne and I bought this cream because it was recommended by my dermatologist. I use it daily before bedtime and my face texture has improved significantly. It does not clog the pores like other face creams. It works great. Overall a great product and i recommend it to anyone seeking better, healthier looking skin,</li>
    <li> My face is very dry and has a rough texture. I was grateful that my friend suggested this product. The first time I used it, I noticed a difference in the appearance of my skin. This is a great moisturizer that makes my skin silky smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have flakey and tight skin on my face anymore.  I apply Nutrients Renewal Cream every night and every morning.  What a difference!  Plus it smells really good and has a nice scent.  My skin is much softer!</li>
    <li> Awesome product. I was a bit skeptical at first, but now I think that this is the ONLY product on the market that truly works. 100% satisfied. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> During the winter season I have extremely dry skin and I tried almost everything that didnt really work for me. One of my friends referred me to this moisturizing cream so I decided to give it a try. I used it for over a week and I started to see a little result. It is very moisturizing and light and non greasy. This is my first bottle so far and I would definitely recommend it if you are looking for a stronger skin moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this product. I have terrible eczema in the winter and get really dry patches of skin on my face. Normal moisturizer just don&#x27;t do the trick. NuNutrients Renewal cream hydrates the skin without feeling greasy, and a little bit goes a long way so although it&#x27;s an expensive product, it&#x27;s actually a great value. I haven&#x27;t tried their other products yet, but after my wonderful experience with this one I&#x27;m going to explore their line.</li>
    <li> This is going to sound weird, but I love the smell of this product! I am sensitive to strong smells, and this has a very light, fresh smell that is not overpowering like some creams. My skin gets very dry in the winter, and the moisturizing effects of NuNutrients Renewal Cream is the best. Skin absorbs it right away it is LASTS. No complaints from me. I just bought another one to stock up.</li>
    <li> Nu Renewal has become my mainstay in skincaren....this rejuvenation cream is really wonderful smelling and rubs on smooth. The absorption can be seen within a few seconds,  I have noticed a lot of improvements around the bags in my eyes, as well as general lines and wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Helps look youthful in the face. Do you think you might want to buff a few small wrinkles out of your mug here and there? I have used this product for a week. Works well so far!</li>
    <li> All natural ingredients here. I have had experiences where I was blindsided by nasty chemicals in other products. Sometimes they make me feel irritated through my skin and it ruins my day if not week. I can see the ingredients on this packaging and everything is a-ok. Would recommend it to people with sensitive skin. naturabest</li>
    <li> Nutrients Renewal Cream is a great way to revitalize your skin.  The cream contains stem cells.  Thus, it moisturizes by stimulating new cell growth.  Priced just under $100, it&#x27;s a bargain.</li>
    <li> I love a high quality cream that goes on light and doesn&#x27;t have a strong fragrance. This cream delivers on both accounts. It feels great and makes my skin feel hydrated. I can&#x27;t say that I look younger, but it does feel much better.</li>
    <li> I have always had very dry skin and I have purchased many moisturizers to try to help combat that. This product is one of my favorites because it leaves my skin feeling smooth, and I&#x27;ve gotten compliments on my skin from my family. It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin oily too, which I like. I would definitely recommend this product to everyone I know.</li>
    <li> It is one of the magical creams that I came across. I am very much satisfied with the results. The results are simply amazing and I would recommend this everyone who are looking for such a cream with guaranteed results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It worked very well and I am able to find the difference. My skin has become smoother than before. Give a try!</li>
    <li> Winter is hard on my skin, it gets dry and blotchy. I am very happy I tried NuNutrients renewal cream! What a difference! My skin feel nourished and smoother. No more dry patches, and a more even tone. I like to apply it in the morning after my shower, it is great to see such a noticeable result. I recommend this cream, it works!</li>
    <li> I love this renewal cream, it&#x27;s makes my skin feel so soft and rejuvenated! It gives your skin a nature glow to it, and also makes your face smooth and seems to ease the lines and wrinkles and dark spots on your face as well. Absolutely an amazing product!</li>
    <li> This smells good and I love seeing my fiancee using this every single time she get done showering. I make sure that this is always on her body because it just feels good on her. I love the scent too. I am planning to surprise her with one. She loves using this too.</li>
    <li> Used some of my daughter&#x27;s cream while I was doing some plumbing in the bathroom. I didn&#x27;t think it was anything special but I noticed the next day that my skin felt really soft and girly. My wife loves it, therefore I do too. I guess experimenting can be a great thing! Will be sneaking into my daughter&#x27;s bathroom shortly..</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin. If you truly have dry skin you won&#x27;t find better product then NuNutrients. I am allergic to many lotions/cremes and I love this. I have the 1 oz. at home and the 1 oz. in my desk at work. I love it so much. A true improvement in a few days and it stays soft and protected all day. It is perfect! When all other creams do not work, NuNutrients does the job.</li>
    <li> Winter is hard for me. I&#x27;m a compulsive hand washer so during the cold months I typically load up on moisturizing cream, but annoyingly I have to reapply every few hours. My fiancé recommended this to me, stating that she only uses it every couple of days. I was skeptical at first because of how low priced it wad, description stating that it&#x27;s usually hundreds of dollars. The results though were unyielding and now I swear by these stem cells! This is the type of research that should be funded, basically being able to replenish our bodily needs better than any other product on the market. Use this if you&#x27;ve tried all the rest, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Firstly, it comes in a beautiful, feminine packaging. The cream has a very pleasant smell.  I use it after I wash and use toner on my face in the morning and evening. It glides on smoothly onto the skin, and works as an excellent moisturizer. A little definitely goes a long way. Would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Skin is aging a bit but I do not fear because I have found this and a few weeks of work has shown that it can make me look ages younger. naturabest</li>

    <li> I love the way that this product makes my skin feel. My skin always has a velvety smooth texture after use and I have noticed that my skin in far less dry throughout the days when I use this cream. The best parts are that this cream doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling oily and it has a light fresh scent to it unlike some of those other creams that have that chemical smell to them.

    <li> Having spent so many dollars on different gels, creams and lotions, I think I have finally hit the jackpot! I bought this a while back, and I&#x27;m waiting for it to be available again!

    <li> With the cold winter temps comes dry and cracked skin.  Finding the right product to renew and rejuvenate can be a difficult task.  Nu Nutrients has an amazing product that not only hydrates and softens skins, it does this with the help of stem cells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use it exactly as stated on the bottle, you may start seeing the results you desire.  It will chase away that nasty dry skin which can also be embarrassing if not catered to.  It definitely is an unsightly thing when your skin starts to get flaky just like a scalp when one discovers they have dandruff.  Don&#x27;t let your skin down.  Renew it today.</li>
    <li> Bought this product for my wife. Her skin gets really dry especially during the winter months. She&#x27;s tried various products throughout the years and none of them really do her justice. She usually complains about them leaving her skin too oily or having strong scents or even some smelling bad. This cream caught my attention for some reason so I went ahead and ordered her some. My wife has been using it for quite some time now and now complaints yet, so I think this one&#x27;s a winner.</li>
    <li> Great skin product! I am a person who has very dry skin. This product is a nice moisturizer that does not leave your skin feeling like you poured oil on it.</li>
    <li> I just use a little bit for when my skin is feeling dry. A little goes a long way so no need to slop it on. i dab on a little for my neck and decollete too. Great for when those winter winds feels like it&#x27;s destroying your skin!</li>
    <li> I live in a very dry area of the country and some people know what that means. Hard core moisturizing needs to go down. But sometims you need to bring in the big guns, like this product here. My skin looks better after using this and I would recommend giving it a shot if you have had problems with your skin looking old or withered. Mine has a nice glow and a youthful quality. naturabest</li>
    <li> Live in sunny and dry place? Well you&#x27;re lucky, but also you need to take care of your skin. This product rejuvenates your face and will keep everything in its own place. Enjoying it. naturabest</li>
    <li> I have always had very dry skin and I have purchased many moisturizers to try to help combat that; some have been worth the money and some have not. But this product is one of my favorites because it leaves my skin feeling dewy, and I&#x27;ve gotten compliments on my skin from coworkers at work, even ! Although I&#x27;m not the best at remembering to moisturize, when I remember, I apply this after my showers so that my skin glows. I like that it&#x27;s not oily as well.</li>
    <li> My skin gets dry very easily on a winter weather and I have to use NuNitrients Renewal cream for best results. It&#x27;s been a year since I started doing it so, and my skin is very nice and smooth. There are a lot of hydrating creams out there and I&#x27;ve tried many, but this one works the best for me. I highly recommend it for both women and men to try it out.</li>
    <li> Good quality creams FEEL different.  When you rub them onto your skin, your skin quickly absorbs the cream, leaving it silky without it feeling gummy or leaving a thick residue of glop.  When you open the jar, the scent is almost neutral and it doesn&#x27;t overpower.  When I applied the NU Renewal Cream on my face, my skin just drank it up.  I put it it on at night and I also use it in the morning after washing my face.  I wait a good fifteen minutes and then apply my makeup on top of it.  The smoothing effect of the cream acts as a nice base for my powder so that when I&#x27;m done, my makeup looks smooth.  Needless to say, my face looks fresh.  Two thumbs up!</li>
