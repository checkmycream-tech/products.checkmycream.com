    <li> This doesn&#x27;t leak when I travel like other atomizers have.  Just the right size so I purchased a few of them and that way I can carry a couple when I travel.  Just remember this type fills from the bottom so the bottle you are filling from needs to have the spray nozzle that you can remove from the bottle of cologne or perfume.</li>
    <li> Handy for travelers.  Small but holds enough.  Great !</li>
    <li> It is nice, but not so ease to fill.</li>
    <li> Perfect for travel easy way to carry your favorite, perfume really convenient.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I need, and does the job quite well.</li>
    <li> Awesome for travel!  Filled easily and traveled like a dream.  I carry this in my purse every day now.  I LOVE it!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Very good product&lt;br /&gt;easy to fill&lt;br /&gt;easy to use&lt;br /&gt;does not leak&lt;br /&gt;i would recommend this to anyone traveling&lt;br /&gt;can be in &amp;#34;carry on&amp;#34; bags</li>
    <li> Amazing . Too bad it could only be used for one cologne , but other then that it&#x27;s perfect</li>
    <li> Perfect for travel. Works like a charm.  No leaks or extra bulk of a cologne bottle. Going to buy more.  Great gifts, too!</li>
    <li> I have several of these and they are great!</li>
    <li> Nice product. Although spray is not so great but you could live with that.</li>
    <li> These work well and do not leak.  I purchased this silver and a pink to put different perfumes into.  I bought them for my international business trips and they were perfect.  Now I use these instead of reaching for my big perfume bottles.  :)</li>
    <li> The first time I used this product, I filled it with my Viva la Juicy la Fleur... a fairly expensive perfume that isn&#x27;t made anymore... and it leaked all inside my backpack!! My backpack smelled nice, but I was pretty angry. What a waste... I bought two of these too. One in the gold for myself and one silver Travalo that I gave as a gift to my mother. She says her perfume also leaked. Really not happy. Threw this product right in the trash. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.</li>
    <li> Good to use for short time</li>
    <li> I had gotten one for myself that was red and I saw how amazing it was I bought one for my friend as a gift.</li>
    <li> dose not worth any pene&lt;br /&gt;after I fill it the perfume leek in my bag</li>
    <li> I really can keep my perfume safe for traveling!!...</li>
    <li> It indeed came in handy. Am so excited i bought this. I can mix my three or more favourite perfumes. It doesn&#x27;t spill at all.</li>
    <li> Not worth the cost at all.  It leaks and perfume is far too expensive to put in this piece.  Came apart the first day.  Company is not good with customer service.  Purchased for shave kit.  Not able to use because of leaks.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I hate having to carry around a huge perfume bottle, so it serving its purpose. I saw someone say that it leaks, so far it hasn&#x27;t, so I&#x27;m happy!</li>
    <li> Excelente! Thank you! Right on time</li>
    <li> Handy lil thing. This travelo works well and brilliantly. I have used it for two perfumes bottles so far and it does the transfer well.&lt;br /&gt;My brother was so impressed with it that I ordered one for him. So I have it permanently in my messenger bag that I take to work, so I just freshen up when the need arises.</li>
    <li> Between my husband and I we own 4 of these now and I&#x27;ve given them as gifts.&lt;br /&gt;1. Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;2. Convenient to carry in your purse or bag&lt;br /&gt;3. Great for travel&lt;br /&gt;4. Refillable</li>
    <li> Bought 2. They work and don&#x27;t leak so far after 2 days of being kept in my leather work bag.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work on my perfume and so I&#x27;m disappointed; should include an adapter or smaller tube to transfer the perfume.</li>
