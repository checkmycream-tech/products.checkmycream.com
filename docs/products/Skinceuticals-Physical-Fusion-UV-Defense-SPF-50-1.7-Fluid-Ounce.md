<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> so far so good - has some tint to it, but a little greasier than I would like. Havent really checked out how great it protects me in full sun exposure yet...</li>
    <li> Great physical sunscreen.  No break outs.</li>
    <li> Love Skinceutical!!  Light coverage, without the greasy ,oil free mess. I would recommend this product to anyone... ♥♥ Love it!</li>
    <li> I originally discovered this in the office of the best dermatologist in town.  It instantly evens out my skintone, plus provides total protection from the sun.  It also glides on smoothly and blends easily.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> It goes under makeup so well and an SPF of 50 I love that too.  I feel like it has really protected my skin</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this sunscreen and I love it!  You don&#x27;t even realize you are wearing sunscreen -- which is nice for everyday use.</li>
    <li> This is the best sun defense on the market for your face. It has a nice tint and is not the least bit greasy. This size bottle will last you all summer long because a little goes a long way.  It has staying power out on the boat in 90+ degree weather. Everyone that I have recommended it to, loves it. Why? Because, it works.</li>
    <li> I started using this product after reading all the reviews and although it might work well , I cannot stand the smell. That is why I am rating it a 3. Overall I like Skinceuticals products, I just never had an issue with the smells.</li>
    <li> I have always used this produce and I love it. Thank you</li>
    <li> This product is a bit different. The color is great and it covers well. It is a little more like an oil then a lotion.  I only gave it 4 stars because I noticed that if you sweat at all, it comes off easily.  My face got a bit red because I went on a mild hike and sweated just a bit on my forhead and I think the product came off. Works well if I am just doing normal running around town.</li>
    <li> I love this sunscreen , doesn&#x27;t clog my pores.</li>
    <li> I hate wearing SPF because it seriously feels like I&#x27;m wearing that Desitin diaper rash ointment on my face. This feel horrible in hot, humid weather. This product goes on like silk and you can&#x27;t feel it. Furthermore, it&#x27;s SPF 50, which is unbelievably high for such a light feeling SPF. Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s water proof. I tend to sweat it off when I&#x27;m out biking in the sun. So, it&#x27;s perfect to wear day to day under makeup, but you might need something more intense for outdoor sports or the beach.</li>
    <li> I love this. light on face and I do not break out like I have from drug store brands.</li>
    <li> This is the best sunscreen ever, and this seller has a great price. I&#x27;m a lap swimmer and have been using this stuff for years. It works great, doesn&#x27;t sting even with sensitive skin and does not get into eyes.</li>
    <li> great product, very light for full coverage</li>
    <li> My family, both sexes, prefer this product of sunscreen for face to all others.  It is a bit pricey to be sure, but it does a nice job.  We live in the Middle East and find that we need to use this product daily to protect ourselves, even when we don&#x27;t plan on being outside for any length of time. We are sold on this stuff....</li>
    <li> I have to say that I was skeptical about this product. There were so many great reviews on it that I just couldn&#x27;t believe that they would all be true. But, it is true. This is a GREAT SPF. I am glad that I searched it here on amazon before going back to my doctor and buying from her office. If anyone is wondering I go to Rebecca Fitzgerald in LA and she promotes this product in her office. She does a lot of skin treatments in office so this is one of the products they recommend to protect your skin. I have the tinted version and I am very happy with the formula. It is very light and it absorbs into the skin quickly. The \\&quot;tinted\\&quot; aspect I feel can work for many skin colors, because it is such a light formula. I have fair/medium skin. I usually have a little bit of color on my face because I live in California. What I like most about this product is that it is very sheer liquid formula. It is not thick at all. Therefore, you don&#x27;t feel like you have sunscreen on at all. I put it on after all my other skin care products and finish with my makeup. My skin never feels cakey.  I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a sheer formula for a sunscreen. You get all the great protection from the sun but none of the usual attributes of regular sunscreen. Very, Very happy with this product! I will be a return purchaser.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t let the size of the bottle throw you! Physical Fusion goes on so sheer. Just a few drops give great coverage and it gives my skin a beautiful glow while giving me great sun protection! I love this product!</li>
    <li> I am a professional makeup artist so I know a lot about skin care. I have searched for a good light sunblock that I could use every day and this one is perfect, It was recommended by a dermatologist. It doesnt feel oily or heavy, had a tint to it so you dont look white. Works great under makeup.</li>
    <li> I have acne prone, combo skin. This product goes on really easy, it doesn&#x27;t dry or cake up like many sunscreen. Wish it was a little more matte, but I use a mineral veil or finishing power and it&#x27;s fine. It has a tint to it and is a bit watery, but I think that&#x27;s why it goes on so smooth, so I like that. I have olive skin tone and the tint looks great. I have just a few dark spots and light freckles and it does conceal them somewhat, it evens out my skin. Now if you have a huge pimple it won&#x27;t conceal it like a concealer will, just saying.  Over all I really like this product and I would buy again. By the way it does have a makeup foundation smell to it, smells nothing like sunscreen.</li>
    <li> I love this light, easy and fragrance free product.  It seems to make a nice primer for my foundation and stays on all day.  Surely that is great sun protection!</li>
    <li> The texture is nice and light, and I have pretty much stopped breaking out since using this sunscreen. I have fairly pale skin, so the color does not cause me any problems. I don&#x27;t know how it would work on darker skin.  I only wish the bottle was bigger and less expensive.</li>
    <li> Great sunscreen!  I was worried the tint would be too much for my pale skin, but it&#x27;s fine.  It just prevents the sunscreen from making me look even paler.</li>
    <li> I got the tinted ones which I didn&#x27;t assume to get when I placed the order. And I don&#x27;t have customer number to call ask for refund or replacement. Very upset.</li>
    <li> I Love this sunblock. I buy it every time. It contains no ingredients that can cause cancer like other sunblocks do. This sunblock is 100% safe! Does not clog pores!</li>
    <li> I really love this sunscreen for many reasons. It is a physical sunscreen that goes on smoothly with no white residue and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling greasy. The universal tint just blends right in with your skin so I don&#x27;t bother to use foundation. I have tried so many different sunscreens as I am in my 50&#x27;s and my skin is important. I must say that this is \\&quot;the one\\&quot;!</li>
    <li> Skinceuticals  is nearly a complete barrier block and has a nice tint that I can use with or without other makeup. Excellent protection in full sun or driving around town.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Skinceuticals</li>
    <li> texture is weird. and clogs my pores and causes breakouts. really regret buying this. beware before buying this because you cannot return it.</li>
    <li> Most sunscreens are chemical based, and the chemicals can be absorbed into our skin and bodies.  This sunscreen, however, uses no chemicals.  It stays on the surface of the skin to block the UV rays. I have fair skin and burn easily, and this sunscreen works great.  It applies easily without any greasy feel.  My only negative is that it&#x27;s difficult to remove afterward, and requires several rinses with soap and warm water.</li>
    <li> Light coverage that protects you from the sun beautifully</li>
    <li> Best sunscreen - doesn&#x27;t sit on top like others do - wonderful texture that feels a bit oily initially but fades quickly into skin (but not into the lines of your face!)...</li>
    <li> Best sunblock I have ever used!!  Has a great sheer and provides great protection.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite mineral sunblocks for the face. No chemical sunblocks in this one, just physical block minerals. The liquid is very lightweight and smoothes on and spreads easily.  It&#x27;s best to let it set a bit before applying foundation over it because if you don&#x27;t wait it can clump up when you put the foundation over it.  It doesn&#x27;t dry to matte - it&#x27;s a bit shiny when worn alone. But it IS clear on the skin. And it is one of the highest SPF broad-spectrum sunscreens I&#x27;ve found that I can wear under makeup daily without irritation or chalkiness.</li>
    <li> I sail. This product is wonderful against the elements.</li>
    <li> Wonderful texture.  Light and it works beautifully.</li>
    <li> Absolutely hated this product. Judging by all the great reviews, I can only assume that I got bad batch -- or possibly that the one I had received had been sitting in the sun for too long (was shipped to sunny and very hot California in the midst of summer heat). It smelled strange and wouldn&#x27;t absorb into my skin no matter what I did, just sat on top of it eventually forming an oily grayish tint. No go, ended up chucking it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For reference, I do have a slightly oily T-zone -- maybe this works better on dry skin types. I&#x27;m also olive-toned (medium Mediterranean skin tone), maybe if I had been super pale I wouldn&#x27;t have noticed the gray tones in this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure what it was but the only way I&#x27;d try it again is if I were living in a cold climate, and would only order in the winter, to avoid at all costs having it go bad (which I can only assume was the case with my order judging by all the positive feedback!)</li>
    <li> The sunscreen stays on well and it doesn&#x27;t make your face white with lotion.  I have used Skinceuticals for a few years now during the summer months and I love it!</li>
    <li> Not pleased with this product and is so runny.  When you shake it  you hear something hitting on the sides of the bottle.</li>
    <li> Has color in it, so I don&#x27;t love it, I would have preferred no tint but I use it. SKinCeuticals is a great brand</li>
    <li> This is far and away the BEST mineral sunscreen I have ever used.  It blends so beautifully you will never need to wear foundation again.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> great product. does not leave that white film on my skin.</li>
    <li> Is it me or has this formula become more chalky?  It doesn&#x27;t give me the same glowing finish I remember when I first started using it.</li>
    <li> I wear this sunscreen every day and I love it.  It is super sheer and light and great under makeup.  It can leave a white film on your face if you have it too thick in an area, but this is easily buffed into your skin.  It doesn&#x27;t feel at all like you&#x27;re putting spf 50 on your face.  And it lasts a long time - a little of this goes a long way.  I bought my first bottle in April and I just had to replace it in December.  That seems to justify the price in my book.</li>
    <li> Great physical sunscreen that is not white. Goes on easily.</li>
    <li> SKIN CUETICLES IS THE BEST STUFF EVER! I HAD REALLY BAD ACNY AND STARTED USING THE RANGE AND NOW I CAN NOT GET ENOUGH OF IT. WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE</li>
    <li> Best SPF in the world I have been using for around 5 years now and love it.</li>
    <li> It is a great product for someone who wants to protect their face from the sun and also needs to wear a foundation. The product flows nicely on my skin, it covers well enough that you don&#x27;t need any other product. All I do is moisturize and then apply this product. It is a bit on a watery side, so shake it well before application and squeeze out a small drop at a time.&lt;br /&gt;My skin tone is fair, but the product claims to have a universal tint, so perhaps fair skin is not the only one that could look natural with this product. I am not sure, though.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen provides the best protection for me. I am acne-prone and it does not aggravate my acne. It has a light tint. When I put this on, my face looks like I am wearing very light makeup. I do not wear makeup at all. I  highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> We got the original from company and it was awsome, not greasy, not changing the skin color and very good. Then I got it from this seller for a cheaper price and it is greasy and very delute. It has completely different texture from the original one.</li>
    <li> too light and watery. did not match my olive skin tone. was much lighter.</li>
    <li> Have spent a lot on money on my face over my 60 years &amp; the dermatologist say to use sunscreens with the ingredients that this has in it.  It looks great on your face, not white &amp; it is the only one that I have found that does that and gives the protection you need.  Worth the price!</li>
    <li> I am white and freckly, with a rosy/ruddy complexion and have little to no acne on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works great on lighter skinned people.  (I&#x27;ve read in other product reviews that Black skin looks weird with zinc oxide-based products, which is why I&#x27;m tailoring my review for lighter skinned people.)  Evens out the ruddy parts of my complexion really nicely.  If I do have a pimple, I need a little more coverage with some other product.  Otherwise, it makes my skin look flawless.  A little blush and some mascara and I look like I just rolled out of bed looking perfect.</li>
    <li> Wore it all summer, during boating and bootcamp, my skin loved it.  My esthetician said it was her favorite sunscreen and highly recommended putting it on every two hours.</li>
    <li> I have used this sunscreen for the past five years or so, and it does a wonderful job.</li>
    <li> Yes, I have been using for 2 years. Protect your skin and looks like I have a little foundation on my skin.</li>
    <li> Wonderful sunscreen and doubles as a light make up.</li>
    <li> I use it everyday and it keeps my face fresh and does not clog my pores. I have three bottles, one at home, one at my boyfriends and one at work.</li>
    <li> Light (invisible really) and effective!  You can&#x27;t ask for more than this in a sunscreen.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful!  I have tried so many mineral sunblocks in an effort to find the &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; one for use in the summer &amp; winter.  This is definitely it!  It has all the great properties you want in a mineral sunblock without the greasiness/heaviness or white cast. A little background on my skin - I have medium olive-tone skin with a history of acne (from teen years well into adult-hood) &amp; large pores.  In recent year, my skin is more combination rather than oily all over, but  the parts that do get oily get REALLY oily.  I prefer mineral sunblocks because they physically block UVA/UVB rays and they get to work as soon as you put it on (no need to wait 30 minutes before stepping outside).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has a very thin consistency so it glides on easily and smoothly - no need to tug at your face! It&#x27;s gentle enough to use around the eye area as well.  I typically give it a good shake before applying about a half a teaspoon to my face and neck.  It absorbs immediately and leaves a nice satin-matte finish (basically your skin has a &#x27;lit from within&#x27; look without any oily residue).  The light olive tint means no white cast - yay!  In fact, there is no residue what so ever, it feels like you have nothing on.  That said, it works really well as a primer under makeup.  As other reviewers noted, don&#x27;t expect the tint to provide any type of color coverage.  It just makes your natural skin glow, but it won&#x27;t hide any scarring, pigmentation, etc.  I typically apply a Vitamin C serum before applying the Physical Fusion.  It just adds a layer of antioxidant protection and makes my skin more supple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price point may turn some people off, but given the ease of application, staying power &amp; protection, and lack of white cast, it&#x27;s totally worth it!  Plus, a 4.2 ounce bottle actually lasts you a long time - remember a little bit can go a long way!</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by my dermatologist. It has both titanium and zinc oxide and provides an effective physical block. It goes on easily and is not heavy. I recommend getting a tinted version unless you are going to be wearing makeup over it, as the non-tinted will give you a slightly ghostly pallor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will always use this sunblock, for me it is the best I have tried.</li>
    <li> has a thin liquidy consistency, can feel a little greasy though. unfortunatley it made me breakout</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product. I know it is expensive but it is truly so worth it. I have been looking for a sunblock that did not use any chemical sunscreens in it, and would not make me look like a ghost. Thank God I found it! This sunblock is lightly tinted and while it does not go on completely clear, it will blend in pretty well with your skin. If you notice that your skin looks a bit pasty after applying this, just use a little bronzer. Works like a charm! This product feels so good going on the skin as well. It is super smooth and blends very nicely. I can&#x27;t say enough good things. I am so happy to have found a product that doesn&#x27;t have cancer causing chemicals in it, and that can still protect me from the sun when I need it. Do yourself a favor and invest in your skin now before it&#x27;s too late.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*For reference, my skin tone is about the same as Alicia Keys. I do not know how this product will blend on darker skin tones.</li>
    <li> Feels good on cranky rosecea flared skin. It can look white if not carefully applied or I mix a dot of foundation with it before applying.</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of different sunscreens and religiously wear them every day. This is the first one that doesn&#x27;t leave a white film and doesn&#x27;t created little dry balls on my skin when I rub it in. The tint is very good. My one regret is that the sunscreen stays moist (which is good) but can rub off and leave colored marks on collars if I&#x27;m not careful.  I love the product!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very good product, much more better than what i have used before. It is what i will recommend to my friends.</li>
    <li> I have not used this yet therefore not sure if it works or not.  I am happy with the BB product.</li>
    <li> Great sunscreen, nice luminous finish</li>
    <li> I choose this product because I have Melasma and I need the sun protection of a Physical sun block as oppose to a the regular sunblocks,  Im not one to wear much makeup  and with the tint in this product I could get away with wearing less makeup or even better none at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the price was the best offer compare to other sites,  and the delivery was within  the expected time.</li>
    <li> Only sunscreen I have used on my face for the last 3 years.  I wear it every day under my regular makeup.  Other products always cause breakouts, but not this one.  It feels silky smooth on the face.</li>
    <li> I love everything about this sunscreen!  The universal tint works very well with my skin tone, so I just fluff on a little pressed powder.  The sunscreen feels comfortable on my skin and stays matte.  I recommend this product to anyone, but especially to those with oily skin.</li>
    <li> Description of product: tinted moisturizer with SPF 50; very fluid so be careful or you&#x27;ll end up dumping out too much into the palm of your hands. A little goes a long way. Shake well before use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I don&#x27;t have extremely bad acne, my face does break out when I use any kind of sunscreen. Fortunately, I decided to try this product and it works wonders without clogging my pores as it is super light and smooth, unlike other sunscreens that leave your face feeling greasy or caked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel it moisturizes really well while at the same time giving my skin that glow during the day. Goodbye dull face! I also dab a little bit of this bad boy underneath my eyes where I have noticeably dark circles. It works in bouncing back that light from cameras to brighten and make me look less tired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fairly inexpensive. I love it and will buy it again. It exceeded my expectations.</li>
    <li> It clogged my pores so much!</li>
    <li> Great product. It dries nicely and protects your skin very well. I have been using this for over a year and compared to my friends, my skin looks much healthier and younger with this spf</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t use chemical sunscreen and there are no chemicals in the active ingredients so I can only conclude that the inactive ingredients caused a burn across my chest that required a visit to the doctor and a prescription cream to treat. I have used Skinceutical sunscreen in the past and I thought the lotion would be easier than the thicker creams. I&#x27;ve given up on sunscreens and will wear sun protective clothing from now on. Also the reaction was NOT caused by a reaction to the sun. I was trying out the sunscreen to see how it felt - indoors on a rainy day.</li>
    <li> I absolutly love this lotion.  i had purchased 2 when I first ordered, but gave one to my daughter who just loved it after using mine.  You have to shake the bottle really well to mix the tint  with the sun blocking ingredients.  I love the finish it makes my skin &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; and is perfect for skin protection.  I use it when on vacation near the equator......not even a hint of tan......and best of all...I am very generous when I apply it and this bottle lasts for MONTHS....and I use it daily.  Foundation goes on easliy if I chose to use one.</li>
    <li> A friend bought some of this sunscreen for me, knowing that years ago I had a bout of skin cancer. My bottle was grainy and thin and felt horrible to apply. Think rubbing sand on your skin. I tried calling the company but you have to go through which ever authorized agent you bought it fun. They basically could have cared less. They didn&#x27;t want it back- at least from me. I could return it to vendor and they could take care of it. I just found my first precancerous spot on my face after 10+ years. Connection?? You decide. If you are just going through the motions of using sunscreen then buy this. If you really NEED sunscreen, pick a different company.</li>
    <li> I purchased my first bottle from my doctor&#x27;s office and went on line to avoid a doctor visit.  But the product purchased on-line didn&#x27;t seem mixed enough and the smell is different.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not in love with this UV Defense. It goes on nice (after you shake the bottle), and the look is a bit like a translucent makeup, but sometimes it begins to pill and roll up when I first apply it with my moisturizer and/or makeup, no matter what I&#x27;m using that day or in what order I apply them. Other times it goes on okay, but later in the day if I touch my face I find it has begun to fall apart and pill. Not pretty. I&#x27;m still looking. The one from Oil of Olay does the same on my face, but their prices are miles apart.</li>
    <li> Great product - highly recommend it.  very light, non-greasy, excellent for under make-up.  Doesn&#x27;t smell like glue, like many high spf products.</li>
    <li> Unlike everything else I&#x27;ve tried, this sunscreen doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, leave a white residue, make my skin breakout, smell bad, or anything else annoying. I put it on and forget about it. Great!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin not only to the sun but to most facial products. This lightweight skin care is wonderful against the sun while making my skin tone even. If you have redness in the face and sensitive skin, this might be the best product for you. Thanks Bobby J for the suggestion :)</li>
    <li> I wear this on my face every day and like it b/c of the watery texture (so easy to apply), and the subtle tint (i am on the pale side but it works well). It doesn&#x27;t do very much covering up, but helps even out the skin just a touch. There is not a fragrance to this SPF. It&#x27;s smells over-so-slightly like the minerals/chemicals that make up the product, but I prefer that &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; smell to any heavy fragrance—especially since all smells gets old if you use them every day. Says this is a &amp;#34;universal&amp;#34; tint, but I&#x27;m not sure I buy that. I think it&#x27;s only for Caucasians or people with lighter skin.</li>
    <li> It goes on smoothly, very lite and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. I can&#x27;t even feel it and it leaves my skin so soft.</li>
    <li> blends nice on my skin. haven&#x27;t burned yet, so it must be working. I&#x27;d recommend the product in the future.</li>
    <li> I love all the Skinceuticals line of products. I used a sunscreen from a different company and it made sense to streamline all my skincare to Skinceuticals .I switched my sunscreen to this product.  Wow - it stung my face, was very painful, the tint was too dark, and was incredibly watery.  I am one of those who post when only a product is incredibly disappointing or is exceptional.  This is one of those times.  I regret this purchase. Yuck.</li>
    <li> I really love this product. It seems to keep the sun damage at bay and also does not cause acne or any irritation. Love the silky coverage and the subtle tint it provides. I am really glad to have found this and will continue using it for years!</li>
    <li> This is the best sun screen I have ever tried.  It really works.  And it does not irritate my sensitive skin.  If I would make one negative comment,  I wish it would not come off on my clothing around my neck and face when Imperspire.</li>
    <li> Great product and ships fast!!</li>
    <li> Lightweight, all mineral, great natural non-chalky color. What more could you want in a sunscreen? I live in a hot humid climate and I have not broken out from this nor have I felt like a grease pit after applying this. I do have very dry skin and this is the only product I put on in the morning and my skin feels great. It sinks in enough that I can apply make up on top of it and not feel like I have a ton of product on my face and make up looks great on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a workout sunscreen or to use in the water , this is not heavy enough nor water resistant enough and will not give you enough protection. I  use their 45 sport formula for cycling and whenever I&#x27;m going to sweat in the sun . I layer another sunscreen on top of Skin Ceuticals Sport UV Defense for any ocean sports, like Tizo Age Defying Fushion SPF 40 all mineral sunscreen. I also layer Tizo Sunscreen on top of this SC physical fusion sunscreen if I feel like I&#x27;m not getting enough sun protection during the day.</li>
    <li> I have tried many sunscreen products and this is the best. Love the texture and dewy but not greasy look it gives my face. It is not chalky and make glides on. GREAT PRODUCT</li>
    <li> These products were recommend by my dermatologist and work great! sunscreen is thin and easy to use, not like the sunscreens that leave  your face white, this product is tinted. would recommend.  The moisturizer sinks in quickly leaving you skin soft.</li>
    <li> The tint is perfect. I don&#x27;t even need foundation!</li>
    <li> Great product! Leaves your skin really smooth without the feeling of wearing any sun protection. It works really well with or without makeup</li>
    <li> this is a very light product which serves as a foundation and has a great SPF 50. and doesn&#x27;t smell at all like many products with sun protecting ability.</li>
    <li> Great product and good service. My dermatologist recommended it.  I have used about four bottles already.Good for sensitive skin, give it a try.</li>
    <li> The ONLY reason that I&#x27;m giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is that I&#x27;m a bit worried about how long it will last for the $34.  it&#x27;s a small bottle and it IS liquid--and clear--so it&#x27;s hard to judge whether I&#x27;m applying enough or too much.  But I can second all the positive comments in the other reviews.  I find that the &amp;#34;tint&amp;#34; is not really visible, by the way--so my skin isn&#x27;t orange by the end of the day as with Neutrogena or other products.  I can&#x27;t imagine anything being a better sunscreen for every-day wear than this.</li>
    <li> Very pleased. Does not make your face look white, no odor, blends well. I like the physical fusion because of the tint but all the tint does is not make you have a white cast on face so you don&#x27;t mind using sunblock. Have had skin cancer on face so very fussy on what I use. I use sunblock on face year round so need a good sunblock. I put on after moisturizer. My skin tend to be dry.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen blends really well &amp; gives my a skin a nice look with a little tint. I have very fair skin &amp; it blends perfectly still. It&#x27;s a sunscreen &amp; a bit of a coverup in its own way. Please it gives great protection. Skin ceuticals just has great products.</li>
    <li> It is an amazing product.  It really protects my skin 100% also it leaves my skin very smooth and hidrated.  I love this product, because it really blocks the sun from my skin and leaves it so smooth and healthy looking.  Will definitely recommendd it specially the one who has tint on it.</li>
    <li> I really love the texture....I&#x27;m on my third bottle.</li>
    <li> This is one fantastic product, I have extremely sensitive skin that tends to go from dry and super shiny all the time.  This sunscreen really goes well on the skin, resulted in smooth and natural look - not sticky at all.  I tried the small bottle first, I will definitely will continue using this product.  Highly recommend it to anybody looking for an alternate sunscreen.</li>
    <li> THIS STUFF IS THE BEST I HAVE USED, AS FAR AS HAVING FOUNDATION.  FOR SOME REASON ANY TYPE OF LIQUID FOUNDATION ACCENTUATE THE FINE LINES AND WRINKLES, SO I RARLEY WARE ANY.  I STILL FEEL LIKE THIS DID THAT BUT TO AN EXTREMELY LESSER AMOUNT THAN ANY OTHER PRODUCT I HAVE USED.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice slightly tinted sunscreen that goes on smoothly.  I&#x27;ve been wearing it on my face for golf and I haven&#x27;t had a sunburn or any problems with it.  It is very light and goes on very smoothly.  I was so glad to find it on Amazon because it kept being sold out in some other online shops.</li>
    <li> I discovered this sunscreen from my dermatologist who I bought my first bottle through which I loved, but this bottle of the same product I purchased on Amazon had a thinner and watery consistency compared to the bottle I got from my doctor. I shook it up a bunch and even left it upside down overnight, but still the same thing. Not sure why this one was different since it&#x27;s the exact same bottle and wasn&#x27;t expired (was newer in fact), but still using it either way (but twice as much as my original bottle to get adequate coverage).</li>
    <li> My go-to tinted sunscreen, never disappoints!  It&#x27;s the perfect consistency and not too shiny with the high SPF that my fair skin needs.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product.  However, I ordered the item pictured, which is Universal Tint and water resistant, but instead they sent me the white liquid version, which has no tint and doesn&#x27;t say &amp;#34;water resistant&amp;#34;.  I am disappointed that they didn&#x27;t send exactly what is pictured, as purchased.</li>
    <li> This product provides great protection and coverage with the slight tinting in the lotion. Once the lotion is dry it feels light, not tacky or greasy.</li>
    <li> Shipped on time and as described</li>
    <li> Works and feels wonderful on my face.  I&#x27;m very fair and it protects me all day.</li>
    <li> With SPF 50 this product offers good UV protection. The product is not oily and its leaves a nice smooth finish without looking chalky.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good sunscreen to replace the Japanese one I used that was discontinued. I&#x27;m glad I found this! I normally do not care for any tint in my sunscreen (and still don&#x27;t). But this one doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. I have medium-fair complexion and does not affect the color of my skin at all. It&#x27;s not a tinted moisturizer, so don&#x27;t expect it to give you that type of coverage or anything. My skin is combo-oily and this does not dry me out nor does it make my skin look like an oil slick. My make-up looks great over this (Although since I started using liquid foundation, I have been starting to use a primer. But my powder foundation looked great). I haven&#x27;t burned using this sunscreen and my brown spots are not getting any darker. Great product!</li>
    <li> It has a tint and is an overall okay product. Way too expensive for the small bottle that won&#x27;t last very long.</li>
    <li> I have very fair skin tone and almost all tinted sunscreens give me that terrible orange look. Also my skin is very sensetive and prone to break out. Its the first sunscreen that gives me a flawless look like my skin is just a little tanned. It doesn&#x27;t really change the color of my skin but my skin looks very healthy. Don&#x27;t think it will cover any blemishes. It does not. It&#x27;s not a foundation but just very reliable sunscreen that can be an awesome base for your makeup. By the way it doesn&#x27;t crease at all. I was very surprised as well that it doesn&#x27;t make my skin oily. I always use blotting sheets during the day on my t zone but now I don&#x27;t need them. Not sure why because it seems it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin at all. If you have oily skin it&#x27;s better to put mattifying powder on the top to make it last longer.</li>
    <li> I needed a high SPF for my face since I use retinoids but didn&#x27;t want the chemicals in most sunblocks. This mineral (Zn &amp; Ti) based block spreads smoothly &amp; doesn&#x27;t leave a white cast. Almost neglected to mention that it gives me sun protection for hours.</li>
    <li> This is the best type of sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever tried, for the face and neck.  It is a thin enough consistency that you can put on an adequate amount without feeling like there is this goopy layer on your skin.  The tint in it is just enough to prevent a white cast, and it does add a bit of luminosity to your skin tone.  Vaguely unpleasant smelling but that goes away quickly.  Might burn a little on sensitive skin, but that also goes away quickly.  Overall I really like it!</li>
    <li> Fabulous product!  I do not wear foundation and my dermatologist was bugging me about putting some type of sunscreen on my face.  I have very sensitive skin and anything I&#x27;ve ever tried on my face has caused breakouts so I was skeptical about this product.  I tried the sample and have been using it diligently for the past year or so.  I use the one that is skin tone colored, as opposed to white, but I&#x27;ve used the white and blends in very quickly as well.  Now this is part of my daily routine, very light weight, not greasy and no breakouts!</li>
    <li> My daughter&#x27;s dermatologist recommend this and I love it.  The light tint is perfect for my uneven completion.</li>
    <li> Way too expensive for what you get.</li>
    <li> I have use this for several years during all seasons of the year under my make up. It is great son protection for those of us were very sensitive skin. Expensive but very well worth it.</li>
    <li> This expensive and highly touted sun block has a heavy mask like feel. The weight of the liquid appears to be light when it is felt in your hand but when applied to the face it feels heavy and makes my lines appear worse than they are. There is a tint which is not a good color either the smell is not good either. Worst of all it is expensive. The bottle is very small. Forget it! I threw it in the garbage the first day. I&#x27;m not putting that stuff on my skin.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen has a &#x27;universal&#x27; tint that actually makes my skin look better, has 50 spf, and it is completely non-greasy.  It comes in a small, small bottle, but it lasts a surprisingly long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, reading the box, it is not at all clear how often in needs to be applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it and recommend it.</li>
    <li> Best I&#x27;ve used...the tint is so good, I seldom wear foundation any longer...not one bit oily and I love skinceuticals products.</li>
    <li> Love skinceuticals. Have been using it for 7 years. This is the dirt time I tried the tinted sunblock and I&#x27;m very impressed with it! Blends with yor skin perfectly.</li>
    <li> Best liquid sunscreen for the face.  It goes on light, not oily or sticky.  It has a slight tint that evens skin tone without looking like you have make up on.</li>
    <li> I like this just okay.  The color doesn&#x27;t blend all that well with my face coloring, so I tend to not choose it very often.  I love how light it is, though.  I just must have weird coloring.</li>
    <li> Best sheer non greasy sunscreen. I&#x27;ve been using it for three years, will not switch. This is great for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I love this and prefer it to all other facial sunscreens I&#x27;ve tried . . . and I&#x27;ve tried a lot. It&#x27;s super sheer, lightweight, non-oily, non-clogging, a good color that doesn&#x27;t make me look chalky or weirdly pale (like the Elta MD tinted Physical SPF 41), and it doesn&#x27;t rub off or negatively affect my makeup application over it (also like the Elta MD, which would ball up and flake off sometimes when I applied powder foundation after). Plus, it&#x27;s SPF 50. A lot of the other facial sunscreens with that much protection are thicker or have other issues. I used to purchase this directly from my dermatologist, who uses it herself and highly recommended it, until I found I could purchase it less expensively from Amazon without having to make special and inconvenient trips to my dermatologist&#x27;s office.</li>
    <li> So great for a sunscreen. I have very sensitive skin and most sunscreens make me break out in a rash. This nonchemical one was recommended by my dermatologist, who insists I need an SPF 50 on my face. You don&#x27;t feel or see it once applied, and yet it keeps me from getting any sun.&lt;br /&gt;I love it!</li>
    <li> Great! Love this item. shipping was fast. best suncreeen in my book!</li>
    <li> This is the best sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used.  It&#x27;s not greasy, but absorbs straight into my skin.  I&#x27;ve had my share of shiny sunscreens.  Another thing about this sunscreen is that you barely have to use any, which is good because it&#x27;s a tiny bottle. Also, it has a light tint to cover previous years of damage.  I go through about one bottle a year so far.  Plus, it works!  I&#x27;m at the age where I&#x27;ve spent too many years wrecking my skin and now I&#x27;m doing all I can to preserve what&#x27;s left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found out about Skinceuticals from a boating friend who was using it and let me try it.  Being on a boat, we&#x27;re always looking for a good sunscreen and this is my favorite.</li>
    <li> This is the only SPF moisturizer that my skin has reacted well to, no breakouts. It&#x27;s moisturizing without feeling too thick.</li>
    <li> I love the thin consistency of this sunscreen. I use a BB cream on top and it&#x27;s not too heavy. I like how it spreads over skin and makes a nice base for my BB cream. You can also use this alone due to it being tinted. LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> I have a super sensitive skin and have tried 15+ different sunscreen brands, only 2 has no reactions - L&#x27;Occitane Immortelle Brightening UV Shield SPF 40 30ml/1oz for $48 and this Skinceuticals. I have been use the L&#x27;Occitane for 4 bottles but not totally happy with it until I tried this Skinceuticals SPF 50 and I LOVE it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t wear makeup, only sunscreen and this tinted sunscreen make my skin looks nice.  It&#x27;s so light, I can&#x27;t feel it after I put it on my face.  All other reviews are true so I am not going to repeat again here.  Hopefully, they will keep making this product.</li>
    <li> Love it.....I&#x27;ve been using it for years!</li>
    <li> It works great but the hardest thing is to get it on line.</li>
    <li> Good price for a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> It would help if it were easier to find among the products listed.  It is the most desirable because it is tinted skin color.</li>
    <li> My acne-prone, super oily Asian skin doesn&#x27;t like it. It&#x27;s too thick and it has a very strong chemical smell... and it is expensive for what it is. The color makes my skin tone looked dull...</li>
    <li> I bought this at a spa after the person recommended it knowing I had oily skin &amp; melasma. I was skeptical about the cost &amp; the small size of the bottle but I was willing to try anything at this point especially after trying other oil free sunscreens that just made me more greasy and gave me clogged pores. Although the package isn&#x27;t very big, it does go a long way. I only apply to my face and it has lasted me months. I highly recommend this!!</li>
    <li> Great sun protection.  Soft on the skin.</li>
    <li> I love this product highly recommended by my dermatologist. No stinging or burning sensation,dryness, greasiness, watery eyes or whitish cast. Even at my age (70), this lotion has just enough neutral tint to even out skin tones and the richness to give a dewy look. I apply it over a light moisturizer (CeraVe).</li>
    <li> This formula is oily and it irritates my eyes.  Still looking for something that blocks UV and is natural enough to be non-irritating. So, far I am going with ZENMED 40 SPF mineral sunscreen or John Masters Suncare. John Masters is nice and does not taste bad, but I am not sure I am getting enough sun protection from it.  If my skin was darker I would be happy with it, but I am at high risk for cancer.  If anyone has any recommendations for natural sunblock please let me know.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite physical sunscreen b/c it&#x27;s not too drying and doesn&#x27;t leave a film</li>
    <li> My aesthetician recommended this product because I was having a hard time finding a sunscreen that wouldn&#x27;t clog my pores and wouldn&#x27;t sweat off while I&#x27;m marathon training.  I&#x27;ve worn it on 16-mile runs in Florida in July without getting pimples or sunburn.  I&#x27;m fair-skinnned and the tint blends in well.  I save it for running or beach days, but it would be fine for everyday use as well.  The 1.4 ounce bottle has lasted me over 6 months, so it&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
    <li> I love Skinceuticals Physical Fusion UV Denfense SPF 50;  it is light and non greasy;  I also believe it keeps my complexion clear and moist;  It&#x27;s one of the best facial sunscreens I have evered used and truly enjoy it.</li>
    <li> I ordered Skinceuticals Physical Fusion UV Defense SPF 50, and I am extremely happy with my purchase.  I received my purchase quickly and it is definitely quality merchandise!  I will be ordering my Skinceuticals products from this seller from now on.  Thank you!!</li>
    <li> I would not expect a mineral based or all physical sunscreen with only 5% zinc to offer enough UVA screening. But the addition of \\&quot;Sunspheres,\\&quot; a polymere that boosts UV screening in this formula have sources reporting a ppd (UVA measure) of 21, so I decided to give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;The viscosity is very similar to the \\&quot;water-light\\&quot; Neutrogena formulas, or the LaRoche Possay Anthelios, for comparison. The tint is a grey hued flesh tone that is very sheer and doesn&#x27;t really add color to my fair skin. Finish is shiney and accentuates large pores. This really offered no cosmetic benefits for me, and  required powder to look best- an added step I could do without. Feel is very silicone-y on the skin, so a bit slippery, but not sticky.&lt;br /&gt;The result, after applying 1/4 teaspoon for the face and wearing a hat and reapplying, was a darkening of melasma over the 2 days I used it. This product is way overpriced given the ingredients and cosmetic and UVA screening abilities in my experience. It will likely take much of a year for me to get rid of the damage using it has caused my skin.</li>
    <li> Highly effective sunscreen. It has zinc oxide (picture lifeguards with white cream on their nose) and titanium dioxide in it to create a barrier between your skin and the UV rays. It has a tiny bead in the bottle so you must shake it well before each use so that these are both mixed well in suspension before applying it. We are boaters and it will last much of the day but if you get wet re-apply to be safe.It is sheer or tinted and you can wear makeup over it.</li>
    <li> Long lasting and sold at my dermatologist, but is slightly cheaper online. It does prevent age spots from the sun and is very sheer, if you need to, you can put make up over this sheer defense. This last months and months for me and I only buy about twice a year. Never causes a break out and it is not heavy and the zinc oxide blocks UV rays from photo-damaging your skin.</li>
    <li> The solar and very good protector, I have melasma, and he and own to prevent melasma, so I think a little greasy, but the protection is worth it.</li>
    <li> Good stuff. i didn&#x27;t realize it was tinted when I bought it.. and the color at first looks like it would never match my skin, but magically it does.. Bottle says it&#x27;s an universal color. It&#x27;s true. Seems greasy at first but just give it a sec to soak in and then it&#x27;s not greasy anymore</li>
    <li> This is my go-to makeup as it has a hint of color in the container and adjusts to my skin tone upon application</li>
    <li> I have tried so many. This is my absolute fav and use it daily. Keep a bottle in my bike bag for reapplication while riding. The only thing that would make it better for that is if it was a spray BUT have never burned nor received new sun damage while using. Used to use the Sport. What I like about this is no zinc &amp;#34;I just reapplied sunscreen&amp;#34; residue. Great coverage. Great product.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product!  It applies smoothly and I barely have to wear foundation after putting it on. This is the only sunscreen I use!</li>
    <li> gives such a natural glow that really enhances your skin. this does not cover any spots or blemished, i repeat it does NOT cover any blemishes or spots. So if you think this product will be a tinted sunscreen with coverable don&#x27;t buy this. If you have pretty good skin and just on planning to use this for sunscreen purposes and doesn&#x27;t want that awful ghost look then this is worth every penny. I have fair yellowish skin and this gives me such a natural and healthy glow, but if i use this in the winter i would look darker than the rest of my body. for people that are really fair then this will make you look tan. when you use this product is comes out really messy and thin so you have to hold the container by the side and not on the front because if you do then all the product will come spewing out. the packaging is quite messy but the product itself is amazing. when you first put it on its really silky and as you spread it around it looks quite shiny and oily but just wait 5 minutes and it will turn into a soft satin matte finish. Overall love love love this product perfect for the summer and too me i think it priced just right. Have been looking for an amazing physical sunscreen for a awhile i think i have found it!</li>
    <li> feels light on my skin. Doesn&#x27;t feel to heavy. Since it&#x27;s tinted it blends well on skin and doesn&#x27;t leave a white cast.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what to do with this product, but for sure I do not want to put it on my skin every morning! It is not lightweight, has a heavy feeling to it, and I can see the oil clearly. Worst thing is, I cant give it to my husband, as it is tinted. Waste of money! Not to say, its practically a sample size, so tiny! And so expensive!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m allergic to the chemical SPF that you find in most all make up, sunscreen, and now they&#x27;re putting it in clothing (great...sigh). I have dark skin, and when I went to the dermatologist she noticed sun damage and discoloration. I didn&#x27;t think there was much I could do about the discoloration. She told me to start exfoliating and using sunscreen. When I explained that I was allergic to all sunscreens at the drugstore, she recommended this brand. It&#x27;s non comedogenic. This does not break me out. On top of being allergic to most sunscreens (my face blisters and I get large pustules...it&#x27;s really really gross), I have incredibly sensitive skin. I&#x27;m only able to use certain things on my skin, most of those things being naturally derived. This sunscreen is a real lifesaver. I&#x27;m so glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> This is THE BEST sunscreen! It is very fluid and has a nice light tint to it which I love! It slides on easily and makes my skin glow all while protecting it from harmful UV rays. It comes in a small bottle but because of its fluid nature it lasts what seems like forever. I use it literally every day under my make up and it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores just leaves me protected with glowing skin.</li>
    <li> The color of the tint almost looks grey. The coverage is much lighter than what I wanted. I much prefer La Roche Posay tinted sunscreen.</li>
    <li> It goes on very smooth &amp; I love the feel of it. I only wish the tint were darker. I used to purchase this from my skin care doctor but Amazon sells it for $10.00 less a bottle. Nice to find it on Amazon!!!!  A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> LOVE this product. It is very thin and so does feel too cakey or too think...also, most importantly, awesome sun protection!</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this product and I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of years now.  It&#x27;s important to get the tinted version - it doesn&#x27;t provide any foundation-like coverage, but it avoids white streaks that happen with the untinted product.</li>
    <li> Great product in a small bottle.  It is very fluid and economical, gives 50 SPF protection and is color tinted that blends in and in summer can double as a foundation.</li>
    <li> started using this based on a friends recommendation, it goes on smooth, is not oily or cakey, blends well with my skin tone</li>
    <li> for sensitive, combination skin. It usually causes NO tingling/burning on my face. This is amazing, since every other brand I&#x27;d tried caused a mild to strong burning feeling on my skin every time I used it. Note: with sensitive skin, make sure your skin is totally dry (not damp from washing) before putting any lotion or sunscreen on it. Dampness increases the absorbency of the skin, which can make the product&#x27;s effects stronger.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product! I use it everyday instead of foundation now.</li>
    <li> All SPF&#x27;s make my face sting and breakout. This one is the first I&#x27;ve found that really protects my skin and does not irritate it. It goes on perfectly under my make-up. Living in Texas I need this stuff!</li>
    <li> This is a nice sunscreen that provides a great non-greasy, non-oily matte finish (which was something that I really wanted).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t worry that it&#x27;s tinted-I&#x27;m a guy and you don&#x27;t even notice it. It doesn&#x27;t make you look like you are wearing makeup or anything, it just provides a nice matte finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also used the sheer version of this sunscreen but I think this version better as it seems to leave a nicer, more matte finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that because this is a liquid sunscreen, it takes a bit more work to apply evenly and get full coverage because you can hardly see or feel where it&#x27;s being applied. I would recommend you use this liberally in order to be sure you get full coverage.</li>
    <li> Primo product. Easy to apply.</li>
    <li> I love the high SPF rating and it is slightly shaded so that if you want to use it as a base you can.</li>
    <li> Really wanted to love this after reading so many wonderful reviews. And I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a wonderful sunscreen... just not for me. This was my first attempt at a physical sunscreen after using chemical sunscreens for a few months (my fav and HG are the Neutrogena Ultra Sheer sunscreens). I am dark skinned (think NC 50 in MAC foundation) and initially did get a white cast after applying this but it soon faded. The deal- breaker for me was that it made my (oily) skin super dry and caused some flaking and exacerbated the lines around my mouth :( I do love the texture and liquid consistency and the ease of application though. I did try with it for a few days just to see if my skin would get &#x27;used to it&#x27; but no. It actually caused the appearance of some fine lines. For the price, I wish the company would offer people samples to try before buying the full size. Very disappointed. I see that Neutrogena also makes a physical sunscreen with spf 50 so I&#x27;m going to try that and hope I have better luck. Otherwise it&#x27;s back to the chemicals...</li>
    <li> My friend recommended this product to me, so I tried it.  Its good, but not great.  I found it too thin in substance.</li>
    <li> I was amazed at the product when I first got it. I read some reviews I don&#x27;t agree with. It goes on nicely and absorbs great. Also it covers and I say again it does cover spots and blemishes and dark circles. Its like a moisturizer, foundation, concealer, and spf 50 all in one product. Although it will get dry after a couple hours, just put more on or if your nor going outside in the sun sprits with a moisturizing spray. It is very thin, but doesn&#x27;t all spew out. You just let it pour out slowly onto your hand, just don&#x27;t squeeze too hard, or you will get too much. doesn&#x27;t settle into wrinkles, but if you don&#x27;t use a moisturizing spray on top it shows wrinkles. The best is it doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes, I can put it right up to and around my eyes with no irritation. Its better if you moisturize and use serums under first. great product worth the price. I use it for foundation, and finish my makeup and spray with moisture spray.</li>
    <li> It eventually faded my age spot.</li>
    <li> I love the lightweight feel if this sunscreen. It blends so beautifully with every skin tone.</li>
    <li> Go&#x27;s on very light doesn&#x27;t clog your pores.</li>
    <li> i love it.  i will be looking for more geat deals,  Thank you so much.  keep up the great work</li>
    <li> I am soooo very happy I found this product. was given a sample and had to find it here to get more. 30 bucks, lasts about 5-6 months, and I have not needed ANY foundation since I began smearing it on my face. : )  I feel clean and fresh all day with no oily residue, and even tone from the tint. Its designed to conform to your own complexion, and I am light to med. after 3 min of blended product on my skin..i get this very natural even hue. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I was using Skinceuticals SPF 30 in the tube forever and found that I really had to tug at the skin on my neck (never a good idea!) to apply it since it is a thick product. I also noticed the tube variety made my skin very pale for a while, not so with this tinted SPF 50. From the first time I used this new sunscreen I knew I was hooked! I love the way it makes my skin look and it works! I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a year. It goes on so thin you would never believe it is a sunscreen,  let alone chemical free!  I live in the south,  never runs with swear no matter how hot. The tint is perfect if you&#x27;re fair, a little bronzing powder and/ or blush and you don&#x27;t need anything else. But, it is a FABULOUS makeup base if you use mineral powder. I use Jane Iredale which is a great mineral powder from my spa, people I don&#x27;t even know tell me how beautiful my makeup looks. This works better than any makeup base I ever used,  even though it is nit a base. Even and smooth. Doesn&#x27;t lay in small lines. Great for older skin,  im 54.</li>
    <li> I have used it all summer and I liked that it was easy to spread and didn&#x27;t leave my face white, but actually a nice uniform color. The problem that I see is that although I didn&#x27;t burn, my face has ended up full of sun marks. I question the SPF as I really thought I was applying it appropriately</li>
    <li> It goes on the face evenly and smoothly and w/o irritation to skin.  I like the fact that it is lightly tinted; for casual days I don&#x27;t need any other foundation.</li>
    <li> the best sunscreen in the world for sensitive skin! I&#x27;ve tried everything and this is the only sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t clog pores or make me break out after daily use. I apply this a few times a day on my nose and have never had any problems. worth the expensive price tag for protecfing your face!</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this and I have been very pleased. The price is well worth it, especially because a little bit goes a long way. I think it took me a year to go through my first bottle. The biggest benefit for me is that it is sweat resistant. I am an active guy and tend to have a warm body temperature. Unlike many sunscreens, especially the Cera Ve products, this doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;trap\\&quot; sweat and make my face look wet or have a white cast. Considering what a coffee costs these days, this is a huge bargain.</li>
    <li> It is light and easy to apply, watery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As it is tinted, I like how it makes my face more even tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would be better if it is cheaper for such a small bottle though.</li>
    <li> Love this!  When my skin is well hydrated and exfoliated, this works perfectly and is my first choice.  If I have any tiny dry bits of skin, the slight glow highlights the dry flakes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure there is nothing wrong with this product; it just doesn&#x27;t have enough coverage for me. ---- ------- ---------</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years, so I know how it should look, the consistency, and feel on my skin. My bottle did not contain the authentic product. It should be white not tan. I checked the packaging and bottle with what I had at home and they matched. What was in the product did not!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What sucked is that I didn&#x27;t discover this until I went on vacation and then I was SOL. I had to purchase another product in order to have sun protection while on my beach vacation.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is the one recommended by my skin doctor.  It is easy to apply and very comfortable.  While it is very pricey, a little goes a long way.  I really would not feel comfortable with any other product.  The one with the tint is the best - the colorless one makes your face white so you need more makeup to cover it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many sunscreens since I live in the high desert and this is the best one ever.  It has nontoxic mineral ingredients but due to the unobtrusive tint I don&#x27;t get a chalky film on my face, something that has happened with other mineral based barrier creams.  Better yet, I have never gotten sunburned while using this, even after spending many hours outdoors on my horse or on skis without reapplying.</li>
    <li> I was hoping this was going to be a good sunblock. But because it is tinted, it totally made all my pores look twice as big. It was gross. I had to return this because I could not use it.</li>
    <li> Works and feels great on skin! The product is long lasting. I live in Arizona and spend a lot of time outside.</li>
    <li> Goes on like silk.  You can&#x27;t tell you have anything on your face.</li>
    <li> I got it b/c I wanted it not to make me look like a mime but then I look like WC Fields instead.</li>
    <li> Great product. Great seller.</li>
    <li> This tone makes your face normal colour ( not white) though is a sunscreen. Lasts long and with good instructions.</li>
    <li> I wish I had read the reviews from previous user stating insufficient protection from hyperpigmentation.  She was correct, after having a chemical peel and having the plastic surgeon recommend this product I have a worsening of hyperpigmentation!!! I would never recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Good price.  Works well and doesn&#x27;t sting eyes or face.  Use it every day and when boating.</li>
    <li> I have used this everyday instead of makeup (foundation) for two years. Never once has it clogged a pore and it even leaves a dewiness to my skin upon setting. I would give this produc a rating of 10 stars if i could!!</li>
    <li> Amazing tinted sunblock....the shade blends right into my skin tone--and is not greasy or pasty!  Have been Skinceuticals loyalist for 11 years!</li>
    <li> I break out with most sunscreens...not this!  It goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t need to be rubbed in so much. I&#x27;ll always use it.</li>
    <li> The package has the expiration date marked out in plant felt pen, so that it is unreadable</li>
    <li> Love the texture and slight tint.  Dries to a matte. Great for days when wearing light makeup, almost like a tinted moisturizer. Works well under foundation also.  My cosmetic dermatologist approved this product too.</li>
    <li> Well poop!!!  I had such high hopes for this...I am limited to either a completely or almost completely physical sunscreen for my face.  This has received such good press, I had been dying to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased towards the end of June.  It is very similar in container and texture to some of the Japanese SS (I personally find it very similar to  Sofina Perfect UV Lucent spf 50 and Biore Moist UV Face Milk spf 50+ PA+++.  Same slender bottle tip, must shake prior to dispensing, little bottles that are expensive, works like a SS and primer in one.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular product has a beige tint that completely melts away on my NC 15/Everyday Minerals Fairly Light/Colorstay Buff/Rimmel Ivory skin.  It feels LOVELY going on, but don&#x27;t let the wonderful slip fool you - you still need to use 1/4 teaspoon of this to get adequate protection just like any other SS, but the slip can easily make you think you can use less due to the fabulous ease w/ which this product spreads over your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the fact that it is a physical and is spf 50.  I know the company claims a really hi PPD due to its other ingredients besides the actives - personally I&#x27;m VERY skeptical of this claim because not only does the Ciba SS calculator &#x3D; 5.3 - 6.3 PPD (depending if ZnO and TiO2 are in water phase or oil phase which I have no way of knowing, so did calculations using all possible combinations) but (and this is why I&#x27;ve d/c using it and its up for swap), my melasma got darker &#x3D; NOT GOOD!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going back to my tried/true BurnOut - Ocean Tested Physical Sunscreen SPF 30 because even though the PPD is only  7.3 if ZnO is water phase and 9.4 if the ZnO is oil phase, my melasma NEVER gets darker when I use this.  Granted, I will use a primer now before foundation which I don&#x27;t have to do w/ Skinceuticals, but since I have discovered that Monistat Anti-Chafing Gel works wonders as a very cheap, very effective primer, I don&#x27;t mind the extra inexpensive step if it keeps my skin happy and my melasma at bay..keeps my skin happy and my melasma at bay..</li>
    <li> I use this product every morning before I start my day....the very best sunscreen with the perfect amount of tint.</li>
    <li> FAVORITE SKIN PRODUCT. SHIPPED QUICKLY!</li>
    <li> Love it. Makes skin feel great plus protects.</li>
    <li> Not greasy, does not rub off on clothing and does not stain clothing. Excellent sun protection. It is thick and creamy and not drippy like other creams.</li>
    <li> I purchased this at the recommendation of my dermatologist.  Granted, I have also just begun a regimen of Retin-A so this is probably not the most reliable review on the product.  The sunscreen caused my face to peel off in my hands as I applied it.  Seriously.  All over flakes.  I looked diseased.  I had to wash my face, exfoliate, and apply a different moisturizer.  Still peeling.  I&#x27;ll wait a month or so for my skin to adjust to the Retin-A and update my review if necessary.  But so far, soooo bad!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this sunscreen before and really like it (doctor recommended as a quality sunscreen).  This bottle was ordered thru Amazon (shipped &amp; sold by Forever Skin).  Only 2 hours after ordering on a Monday morning, I received an email that it was shipped.  What better news could one get!  USPS delivered the package.  I opened it a few days later to see if it was the tinted version or the white version as it wasn&#x27;t indicated when ordered.  I&#x27;m unsure if they still make the white version, which I actually did want for my neck and chest to avoid the tint getting onto my clothes.  (I use the tinted version on my face.)  When I opened the bottle (without shaking it), it was weird - a foaming tinted lotion came out.  Perhaps this was caused in transit???</li>
    <li> Skinceuticals &#x3D; Perfect!!! Everything I&#x27;ve ever used works wonderfully! I won&#x27;t ever use anything else! Thank you for such amazing products...Love, my amazing skin! :)</li>
    <li> I have had two skin cancers on my face in the last few years and was told to use a sunscreen.  My experience had been that sunscreen is oily and if it get&#x27;s into your eyes, look for a towel and expect to redo your mascara.  Once again, SkinCeutials has produced a fabulous product, in my book, that is perfect for any skin type at any age.  In the morning, I apply a moisturizer and then apply the SkinCeuticals sunscreen over top.  It is slightly tinted and matches any skin tone.  It gives a velvety feel and appearance to your skin.  I apply my powder blush over it, and look as though I&#x27;ve spent some time putting on foundation when I haven&#x27;t.  I haven&#x27;t had good luck reapplying it every two hours during the day as suggested, as I think it could build up.  Because I take my walk or exercise in the morning and I apply the sunscreen before going out, just applying once a day works for me.  It has not gotten in my eyes and burned.  If you are in the sun all day, you will probably use a little more often and differently.  I have grown to love this product and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have used many sunscreens in my life, and most of them felt nasty on my face. This goes on smoothly, has a moisturizing effect, and a gentle tint. I love it and don&#x27;t ever want to be without it!</li>
    <li> I like this sunscreen, it is difficult to remove completely so make sure you have a good cleanser. The tint is a big selling point for me on this. My main complaint is that it stings for a bit when first applied but it does fade over time.</li>
    <li> Absorbs quickly, no sticky feeling, subtle coverage, does not seem to clog pores or cause acne (I have acne prone mixed skin). One of the few mineral sunscreens out there with all of the above characteristics.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me by the aesthetician at my Kaiser dermatology office, and I&#x27;ve used it for over a year. It&#x27;s expensive, but it&#x27;s very sheer and very effective. I got it for a much lower price at Amazon. I really like it.</li>
    <li> Skin Ceuticals Physical Fusion UV Defense is a great product at a great price. I will definitely order this product again through Amazon!</li>
    <li> Great, matte finish, nice color to the skin</li>
    <li> i like this sunscreen plus light tinted foundation.it stays on and matches your complexion pretty well.i would recommend it .you just have to reapply.</li>
    <li> Non greasy and tinted, it&#x27;s great. Make sure to shake it up.Easy to apply and the price is right. I paid more at a salon.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! This SPF 50 sunscreen has a nice tint to it and a thin consistency which makes it quick to absorb. Most days I just wear this with powder and bronzer and I&#x27;m good for the day. I have sensitive skin and I&#x27;m prone to adult acne and it doesn&#x27;t break me out. I bought this in May and I&#x27;m not even halfway through the tube so to me it&#x27;s really worth it. The peace of mind of having such a high SPF on at all times is priceless!</li>
    <li> Weightless and does great for your skin tone</li>
    <li> Great product.  I have used it in the past and provides great protection as well as a tinted sunscreen.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful for my skin. It is not oily, but moisturizes very nicely. It goes well under my make-up.</li>
    <li> This is the best sunscreen with tint I have ever used! I will buy again and again?</li>
    <li> Have used this a few years now and like the lightness and feel of the product on my skin.  Will continue to use.</li>
    <li> So far i am pleased with this sunscreen. My dermatologist introduced this to me 6 months ago and i recently bought a second bottle. I like that it contains zinc oxide, which is an important ingredient to protect your skin from harmful UVA rays. It is a runny liquid that goes on smoothly and evely and gives it a smooth touch. I love that it has a hint of color, especially on those days when i want to go makeup-free. I would definitely purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> I ALREADY HAD SKIN CANCER ON MY FACE AND WAS USING ANOTHER PRODUCT.  WHEN YOU PERSPIRE IT WOULD MIX WITH YOU PERSPIRATION AND BURN YOUR EYES.  THIS PRODUCT DOES NOT DO THAT. PLUS IT ADDS A LITTLE COLOR TO MY SKIN SINCE I NO LONGER SUN BATHE.</li>
    <li> This was recommended by a dermatologist due to my sensitivity to the sun. Works great!</li>
    <li> It made my face breakout! will not use it anymore!!</li>
    <li> Great Seller and Great Product</li>
    <li> My skin doctor introduced me to this product and I have used it for two years. It works great, is not sticky or greasy and looks natural, no white color residue. A great product all around!</li>
    <li> Been using this product for several years and will never go outside without the UV protection and I think it works great as a primer under any other make up applied, love the tint!</li>
    <li> This sunscreen works brilliantly. I wanted something with a little more coverage and from researching this product, I got the impression that there was more coverage but not as much as a bb cream. This cream does blur imperfections slightly and mixed with my tinted moisturizer gives a wonderful dewy finish with slightly more coverage without the mask look - just what I wanted for for a casual day. A light dusting of mineral finishing powder and you&#x27;re good to go. There is no nasty chemical sunscreen smell with this cream and absorbs and disappears very quickly.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for my sentisive skin. I have used this product in the past and have been very satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> Good to have this. My wife love it</li>
</ol>
