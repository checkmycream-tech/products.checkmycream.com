      <li>The hair mask is awesome too for deep conditioning.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with it.</li>
      <li>I know this cream works more like a protector from heat, but you are called a &amp;#34;styling&amp;#34; cream anyway.</li>
      <li>Really love the way it holds and the way it smells.</li>
      <li>water works better then</li>
      <li>Also, I LOVE the aroma.</li>
      <li>My hair has never looked better.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s best for medium to long hair but it can be used on shorter hair.</li>
      <li>It is pretty good on just shampooed hair.  </li>
      <li>Like something that you would use to clean the bathroom floor!</li>
      <li>The great thing is this product does not flake or feel crunchy, soft touchable curls is what you will have.</li>
      <li>When I ran out of my favorite hair wax I decided to try this instead because of its fantastic reviews.</li>
      <li>This is the only product that keeps my hair in a beautiful bun when dancing.</li>
      <li>I have really fine hair.  </li>
      <li>This product doesn&#x60;t leave &amp;#34;dust&amp;#34; and it&#x60;s not sticky which is great for guys like me that keep touching their hair all day long.</li>
      <li>After it dries, a light run through of my fingers through my hair breaks up the residual stiffness while still maintaining reasonable-quality hair hold control.</li>

      <li>Because it textures my curls, keeps them frizz  &amp; poof free and gives them all day.</li>

      <li>Scrunch with a micro-fleece towel (hair won&#x27;t stick to this kind of towel) or use an old cotton t-shirt.</li>
      <li>Definitely a good middle ground styling solution.</li>
      <li>It does a good job as a styling cream, but there are others on the market that work equally well without the slimy factor.</li>
      <li>I have excellent results if I massage the tube to mix the cream and then apply a small amount right after I shampoo and rinse my hair.</li>
      <li>Worth its price and more.&lt;br /&gt;Not easy to find in stores, but worth the search for it.</li>
      <li>This is the second time I have ordered this product and both time have been very pleased.  </li>
      <li>For the very first time in my life I dyed my hair.</li>
      <li>most products like these are discontinued after a couple years, i have very, very thick wavy frizzy hair and this product make my hair look beautiful.....</li>
      <li>This was a new choice for me based upon the great Keratin Leave-In It&#x27;s a Ten makes.</li>
      <li>This product is wonderful especially if your hair tends to be on the dry side (like mine).  </li>
      <li>my hair is light colored and very curly</li>
      <li>It smoothed out my hair nicely and I actually do recommend this afterall!</li>
      <li>and I want it to be able to move and flow naturally.</li>
      <li>It can be applied to wet or dry hair, which works great when you&#x27;re in a hurry and have to re-do that  hair-do!</li>
      <li>Love this as it really makes my hair feel soft and conditioned.</li>
      <li>Love this product, my hair is natural curly and very frizzy.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great for curls and as leave in conditioner.</li>
    <li> I love this product for so many reasons! Im done using gel, and even hair spray! I use a little bit of this cream while my hair is still wet and it works perfect everytime! I have really curly hair and sometimes depending on the weather I will straighten it. Well this product also performs the perfect blow out for when that time comes! I paid at a salon 18.99 for this cream - you can not beat the price on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Dad approved. My dad has been using this stuff for years and swears by it. It doesn&#x27;t seem to leave any residue but leaves hair effortless and clean.</li>
    <li> This product is a Godsend for frizzy, unruly hair. Most people in my shoes have tried tens even hundreds of products. I finally found the one, and I won&#x27;t leave home without it.</li>
    <li> Best styling product I have ever purchased in my LIFE! Tames my thick, curly hair, elimates frizz and the shine is to die for!</li>
    <li> I love this product! It&#x27;s the only thing that works in my hair. It provides texture &amp; hold like no other product. I HIGHLY recommend this stuff!</li>
    <li> I have mid back length curly hair which tends to get frizzy. I&#x27;ve tried a few products in an attempt to tame it. When I ran out of my favorite hair wax I decided to try this instead because of its fantastic reviews. I am a bit confused...I am wondering if I am using the same product as the people in these other reviews! The product which I got, first of all, smells like some serious cleaning product. Like something that you would use to clean the bathroom floor! And of course, it does not even work in my hair at all. Its so odd...water works better then this goop. I think that this stuff even makes my hair frizzier some how. Oh well. I&#x27;ve learned my lesson, not to experiment with other hair products! I&#x27;ll just stick to my favorite hair wax thank you...what a waste of money</li>
    <li> Our entire family uses this. My wife, myself, and our two daughters. All three females in our house have extremely curly, frizzy, kinky hair. This stuff tames it, controls it, moisturizes it, and gives it manageable soft curls. We do NOT use a hair dryer. We apply it on wet hair after showering, brush it through and air-dry. The girls&#x27; hair dries into beautiful ringlets. I use it to get the dry Colorado frizz out of my wavy hair too, it&#x27;s non-sticky and non-crunchy and holds a style. And I&#x27;m man enough to admit it. Good stuff!</li>
    <li> I Love this product. Holds hair in place without stiffness or stickiness.</li>
    <li> This is the only styling product I use on my hair.  It provides styling like a mousse while not drying out your hair.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Love it. It&#x27;s the best!</li>
    <li> Supercuts stopped selling them so I found Amazon to order it online instead. This is the only product that keeps my hair in a beautiful bun when dancing. The price is also cheaper compare to other stores. I love the fact that you can comb your hair even after application. I Love it.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t found anything better for my extremely frizzy hair!  I love it.  I also use it with the conditioning spray.  Amazing.</li>
    <li> This is a miracle for my hair, controlling frizz, adding shine, taking away dryness, and making my hair look ten years younger.</li>
    <li> I have super thick, coarse, wavy hair that I straighten every day.  This product is wonderful especially if your hair tends to be on the dry side (like mine).  Don&#x27;t let the price tag deter you, because a very little bit goes a long way.  This bottle lasts me almost a year when I wash my hair 2-3 times a week.</li>
    <li> use this daily on my short hair works great</li>
    <li> This was not the product I ordered!! I got an &amp;#34; imitation&amp;#34;!! VERY disappointing!!</li>
    <li> Love this! Works better than any gel I&#x27;ve tried. Wouldn&#x27;t you know, it has apparently been discontinued. Glad I found it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> First of all I am a colorist/stylist that has naturally curly hair. I love,love, LOVE the It&#x27;s a 10 line so much, we carry it in the salon. This is the remedy for dry, thirsty, frizzy curls. After shampooing, squeeze out as much water as you can by hand (don&#x27;t use a regular towel, hair sticks to it and causes frizz), spray leave-in conditioner onto hair and comb thru, then use miracle styling cream and comb thru. The key is to put the product in while hair is still wet, if you dry with a towel first it doesn&#x27;t work as well and you get frizz. Scrunch with a micro-fleece towel (hair won&#x27;t stick to this kind of towel) or use an old cotton t-shirt. Diffuse or let air dry (try not handle curls until dry, just lift or hold in palm while drying). Curls come out perfect every time. Use a little of the serum for shine when curls are about 75% dry. The great thing is this product does not flake or feel crunchy, soft touchable curls is what you will have. The hair mask is awesome too for deep conditioning.&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product on fine curly hair to coarse tight spirals, and the results are gorgeous curls everytime.</li>
    <li> I have tried countless products on my hair. I have a ton of fine, naturally curly hair that I wear both curly and straight. This product does it all. Holds my hair all day without that \\&quot;crispy\\&quot; feel, protects from heat, and keeps the frizz down. It can be applied to wet or dry hair, which works great when you&#x27;re in a hurry and have to re-do that  hair-do!</li>
    <li> NONSENSE! I&#x27;m a 62 year old male with a healthy full head of slightly wavy hair. My Super Cuts hair technician applied a a nickle size dab of the cream version of this product, back combed my hair into shape and then applied just a tiny, tiny amount using his palm to my hair once combed. My hair has never looked better. Also, I LOVE the aroma. I bought a 5 oz. tube on the spot ($17.91)from him. Looks like this tube should last a very long time. It&#x27;s the very best of type I&#x27;ve ever used. If you&#x27;re looking for discount price on this product, I&#x27;ve yet to see one.</li>
    <li> Really love the way it holds and the way it smells. I have extremely sensitive scalp that will get irritated and red and eventually start peeling and bleeding after using and not washing off a product overnight and this product seem not causd this at all!!! Actually I have several products by the same brand and none of them causd irritation so I am pretty stoaked to find something that works well on my hair.</li>
    <li> I know this cream works more like a protector from heat, but you are called a &amp;#34;styling&amp;#34; cream anyway. You need to do your job!</li>
    <li> My hairdresser turned me on to this styling cream.  It really helps to calm the frizzies but does not make your hair oiley or heavy.</li>
    <li> really didn&#x27;t like the smell of it and didn&#x27;t do any better than other styling creams I&#x27;ve tried</li>
    <li> this was recommended by my beautician and it is amazing...you only need to use a very small amount on damp hair.</li>
    <li> Many of the reviews you see here say this product is only for curly hair, but I have naturally straight hair, and I use this all the time. I have frizzy baby hairs on my hairline, and I put this on when those hairs are wet. It can also work for the ends of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason this is getting 4 stars and not 5 is because I originally bought this from a salon, then I ordered this from Amazon when I ran out, and this cream seemed a bit different in texture than the one I previously bought. I preferred the one I bought in the salon, but just slightly.</li>
    <li> What can I say?  It&#x27;s a 10 is a great product line.  I have been in the process of trying different products the company offers and there has been only one that I couldn&#x27;t use.  This product is easy to use, great for blow drying and styling.  Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST styling cream I&#x27;ve used so far. It is light-weight, doesn&#x27;t make your hair look oily but smooth and frizz-free. It holds in soft curls and waves.</li>
    <li> most products like these are discontinued after a couple years, i have very, very thick wavy frizzy hair and this product make my hair look beautiful.....tame with nice wave......i hope they never, ever stop making this product...</li>
    <li> I have excellent results if I massage the tube to mix the cream and then apply a small amount right after I shampoo and rinse my hair.</li>
    <li> Because it textures my curls, keeps them frizz  &amp; poof free and gives them all day. LOVE THIS PRODUCT! Wish it wasn&#x27;t discontinued :-(</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work great for my thin curly hair.  I used this product with the Miracle Style Mousse and it didn&#x27;t control the frizz enough for me.  Now I use DevaCurl and love it.  This product might be great for someone with straight hair, but it didn&#x27;t do the job for me.</li>
    <li> Shipping was mediocre and the product leaves a white residue in my hair.</li>
    <li> This styling cream is the best that I have used so far (I have used plenty in the past). It makes your hair smooth &amp; it&#x27;s easy to work with (a little goes a long way). It&#x27;s best for medium to long hair but it can be used on shorter hair.</li>
    <li> This product helps my this dry frizzy curly hair.  Especially in the winter when the weather is drier. Helps keep it soft</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Styling Cream is amazing.  Have naturally curly hair that can be dry and hard to control.  MSC stopped the breakage I was experiencing, makes hair soft and manageable, stronger.  Great for thermal protection and control before styling, fine to use on wet hair and let air dry (dries soft).  Smells great, works great... surprised it&#x27;s not more widely found in salons (hard to find except online anymore?).</li>
    <li> AMAZING stuff for daily use to give my super-fine hair a little character.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like that it&#x27;s slimy and I cannot get it off my hands without washing them thoroughly.  It does a good job as a styling cream, but there are others on the market that work equally well without the slimy factor. My hairdresser recommended it as a replacement for Redken&#x27;s Curlwise which was discontinued, and I miss terribly.  I use It&#x27;s A 10 Spray Conditioner everyday, but I won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
    <li> it makes my head itch!</li>
    <li> I do not notice a difference when I use this product. I like there shampoo but this doesn&#x27;t do much for me</li>
    <li> I wish it worked and smelled better</li>
    <li> Top quality stuff - this is my second tube.  It doesn&#x27;t take a lot and it delivers what it says - my hair is in better shape since using It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle products.  I use a few others and have been very pleased with whatever I&#x27;ve tried.  I would recommend this to someone with dry hair and trying to take care of their hair.</li>
    <li> I got this for my grandaughter&#x27;s naturally curly hair and have used it several times.  It seems to work well.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair and have tried a lot of products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this one as it doesn&#x27;t flake and controls frizz throughout the day.</li>
    <li> I like this alright.  It is pretty good on just shampooed hair.  I really was looking for something I can use inbetween shampoos since I only wash my hair two times a week. I know back in the day VO5 had a haircream like stuff, but I tried it years ago and it was too greasy for my hair.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Use it daily.</li>
    <li> It´s a great product, really a 10. I am a guy with short curly (not too curly) hair. This product keeps the frizz away, it gives shine, control but doesn&#x60;t look or feel hard or wet (which is sooo 1990&#x60;s). This product doesn&#x60;t leave &amp;#34;dust&amp;#34; and it&#x60;s not sticky which is great for guys like me that keep touching their hair all day long. I really love this product.</li>
    <li> I have curly hair, this cream makes the curl well defined and shiny.</li>
    <li> Its a 10 for me.  Love this product, my hair is natural curly and very frizzy.  This is the only product that tames it so I can wear it down.&lt;br /&gt;Have been using this product for a year now and never has failed me.</li>
    <li> This stuff just makes my hair seem very dirty. I only used less than a pea sized amount every time I tried to make this work because I really wanted it to work! $15.00 is a costly mistake. The only reason that there is no more puffiness or frizz anymore is because it is plastered to your head in pure filth! I do not recommend this product at all. For reference I have thick wavy hair&lt;br /&gt;Update: I just couldn&#x27;t not give this stuff one more try because of the hefty price tag. So I washed and conditioned my hair with it&#x27;s a 10 shampoo and conditioner then used the matching leave in spray and let it air dry as usual. After it dried I squeezed a tiny little ball of the styling cream (about the size of a baby pea) rubbed my hands together and smoothed it onto my almost dry hair. I am very happy to report that this has turned out to be a super product. It smoothed out my hair nicely and I actually do recommend this afterall! Just a teeny little bit on dry hair :)</li>
    <li> Worst purchase ever. This cream made my hair sticky and hard to style. Other people in my family also tried this product, with similar results. Will never purchase this product again. I do however like the &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a 10&amp;#34; leave in conditioner. That item is good, but not this one.</li>
    <li> I have unruly curly hair that I sometimes attempt to straighten. This styling cream works well to tame my curls and keep them from frizzing and it works well when I put it in my hair before I straighten it. I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with it.</li>
    <li> Made my hair too soft.</li>
    <li> This product is aptly named. It&#x27;s a 10 in my book as far as styling products go. A little goes a long way, &amp; lasts all day.</li>
    <li> I ADORE this product. It provides hold, texture, and form without being at all weighty, overpoweringly-scented, or otherwise obnoxious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One piece of advice, though: when your hair first dries after applying this cream, it will probably be somewhat stiff and brittle-feeling. DON&#x27;T PANIC: running your (dry) hands through your hair a few times completely eliminates all of this — without sacrificing much in the way of hold. It&#x27;s a spectacular little bottle.</li>
    <li> Thank you! Great deal.</li>
    <li> Since I do like the other products made by this company, I looked forward to using it.  I put a dime-size amount in the palm of my hand, mix it with some water, then apply throughout my hair.  Unfortunately each time I use it, there appear to be dozens of tiny white bits of undissolved cream sticking to my hair--like very large dandruff flakes.  They&#x27;re very sticky and hard to get out.  I&#x27;ve tried mixing it with even more water, but with the same disappointing result.  I don&#x27;t know if I just got a bad tube of cream, but I got it directly from a salon and it was not exposed to cold or heat as far as I know.  It&#x27;s going in the trash.</li>
    <li> I have extremely curly hair and this product held back frizz while sculpting&lt;br /&gt; the curls.  Smells great and works like a charm.  Will definitely order again!</li>
    <li> I use to love this product.  Either my hair has changed or the recipe????</li>
    <li> and this is one of the best styling creams....you don&#x27;t need much and it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair heavy....my hair is light colored and very curly</li>
    <li> Best hair product ever</li>
    <li> This is a great product for styling and a easy product to use keep s my hair great looking for the whole day</li>
    <li> My stylist recommended this and even though it&#x27;s expensive, a little goes a long way.  I use it before I blow-dry and again a little bit after to smooth my hair.  No heavy scent, and no heavy feeling.</li>
    <li> This was a new choice for me based upon the great Keratin Leave-In It&#x27;s a Ten makes. Love this as it really makes my hair feel soft and conditioned. I use a lot on the dryer ends of my hair and it makes a big difference.</li>
    <li> Product works great for short hair.  Since they have taken the other product off the market that I originally used, this product was recommended to me by my beautician.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It works better than any styling gel or mousse.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair with medium curve and I want it to be able to move and flow naturally. I have not liked the application or feel of most hair gels and mousses I have tried so far: they are either way too stiff or sticky, and so far most or all make my hair look like it is cemented in place. No natural movement of my hair when those kinds of products are in use. Then a stylist friend of mine from an upscale spot in San Francisco recommended this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found this styling cream a good compromise between the stiff hold of gels and mousses and using no product at all. It works very well with my naturally curly hair to keep it moderately under control. When using this product, I don&#x27;t get the &amp;#34;gelmet&amp;#34; look. After it dries, a light run through of my fingers through my hair breaks up the residual stiffness while still maintaining reasonable-quality hair hold control. Definitely a good middle ground styling solution.</li>
    <li> item just as promised!  will definately buy from this seller again!!</li>
    <li> My hair dresser used some on my hair and gave me the little left in a bottle she had.  I couldn&#x27;t wait to order some for myself.  I like the product in the tube.  I found some that were in a small jar, but I have something like that already.  I have really fine hair.  I also use just a little bit of a root spray product to help with the volume.  10 Miracle Styling Cream gives my hair more of a texture feel and my style holds longer.  When I wake up in the morning, I usually only have to brush through my hair lightly and us a curling iron in some spots to get my style back.</li>
    <li> My son was using this for his hair.  The first time my wife purchased from a hair salon.  When he was running low I went on Amazon to see if they had this and this did.  This is the second time I have ordered this product and both time have been very pleased.  Even more so for the convenience of having UPS deliver to the front door and it costing less.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I bought a different &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a 10&amp;#34; hair product from my salon, and it did not control the frizz as I had hoped. I was hoping for something to replace the Lanza Design Cream hair product that was recently discontinued. So far, I have found this Miracle Styling Cream to perform similar to the Lanza Design Cream I had been using for years. I&#x27;m glad I found a comprable replacement and I&#x27;m very pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> I put it in my still wet hair and let it dry until my hair is &amp;#34;crispy&amp;#34;. Then I comb through and voila! No more frizzies!</li>
    <li> For the very first time in my life I dyed my hair. I wanted a lighter color so they had to bleach it and I almost cried the first time I washed it... it was all hard and it felt terrible to the touch, I though the days where I had pretty and soft hair were gone, but I did my research and bought this  product and I AM SO HAPPY I DID! my hair is better than what it has ever been. Its soft, my curls are beautiful and soft to the touch. This is amazing! Its a little pricey but its worth every dollar! I will, without doubt keep using this product and reccomending it!</li>
    <li> I was hoping this styling cream would help to hold a style in my hair.  It does not.  If you are one to use hot rollers or a curling iron this product will do nothing to maintain your style.  Not worth the money.</li>
    <li> Best hair product of its kind. Simply love it! Worth its price and more.&lt;br /&gt;Not easy to find in stores, but worth the search for it. Glad Amazon sellers carry this.</li>
