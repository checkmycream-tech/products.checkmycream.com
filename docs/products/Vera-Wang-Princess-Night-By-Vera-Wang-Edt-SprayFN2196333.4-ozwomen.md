    <li> I love this Vera Wang perfume that you can no longer find in stores. I was so happy to find it, let alone at a low price. This item shipped very quickly, arriving within 3 days. Good buy!</li>
    <li> This is a Christmas gift that my daughter requested who is familiar with the product.</li>
    <li> Smells absolutely fantastic! I&#x27;ll be buying it again as soon as I&#x27;m done with the current one!</li>
    <li> Best going out at night perfume ever!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter for Christmas.  Neither of us had ever smelled it, but she loves all things Vera Wang, and we were not disappointed.</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance and so does my husband.  It was with great dismay that I had to begin looking for a new option when the department store I had always bought it at discontinued it.  I was unable to find another that I liked as well as this - my husband said I should check online.  I received my order promptly and couldn&#x27;t be happier to have found a new source for this great perfume.  Now I need to stockpile it - just in case.  (It is really that good - I get compliments all of the time on it.)</li>
    <li> I saw this perfume at Ulta here in the US. I saved my money and finally bought it. It was suppose to be a limited edition but it is still available in the retail world. If you get a chance smell it. It is a good fresh smell.</li>
    <li> I bought this fragrance as a gift for my daughter and she was ecstatic with it.  It is a very nice, soft fragrance and I would definitely recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> Great seller. No problems at all. Great fragrance.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter and she loves it...I even sneak in and use it for myself.  The scent is just wonderful and I think we like it better than our other favorite by Vera Wang, Lovestruck.  The price was so much better then going to the department store and worth waiting for the shipment which arrived earlier then promised.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume , I am a fan of vera wang princess , &amp; have had multiple bottles . Glam princess , rock princess &amp; original princess. My favorite is the original &amp; now the night princess . My next purchase will be pink princess . And I am 42 , I know this is probably meant for younger girls but I&#x27;m drawn to these perfumes !</li>
    <li> This smells sooooo amazing!!!</li>
    <li> I did not like this scent at all. I love the original VW Princess but this scent was like fake grape medicine or something. I am usually very easy to please when it comes to perfumes but this was just..yuck. I sprayed it and my husband came to kiss me and asked what &amp;#34;that smell is&amp;#34; and not in a good way. I told him I ordered new perfume and he tried to be nice by saying it smelled good but I knew he was lying. He didn&#x27;t want to hurt my feelings but was pleased when I said I didn&#x27;t like it either. I had hoped that after wearing it for awhile it would mix with my skin and maybe smell different but nope, still gross. I am not very happy that I could not return it so basically I wasted money on this which is never good news. Other reveiwers loved this perfume and gave it high ratings so clearly its not a bad perfume but just wasn&#x27;t for me. Oh well.</li>
    <li> This perfume is simply sweet, seductive, feminine &amp; amazing. I love it!!! Will purchase it again in the future!! A+</li>
    <li> This is a really popular product because the scent is wonderful and the concept is really cool too. Because of it popularity, it may or may not be on back order when you order it so be careful...</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very berryish, i think that&#x27;s the right term. And deep, it&#x27;s not light like princess is. It&#x27;s definitely a nice scent. Fairly sophisticated smelling too.</li>
    <li> I read all the great reviews and bought this as a blind buy since I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere to test it.  I have to say, while it&#x27;s not truly awful, I don&#x27;t really like this.  It&#x27;s super sweet and grape-y, and the berries smell kind of synthetic.  I would describe it as a sweet, gourmand and fruity scent, but it&#x27;s dominated by the sugariness.  I don&#x27;t particularly like super sweet scents - with a few exceptions - but this one gives me a bit of a headache.  I&#x27;ve worn it before, and it&#x27;s definitely more of a night scent.  For better or for worse, it&#x27;s quite heavy and strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the bottle is cute, but annoying; I don&#x27;t like having my hand prickled and scratched each time I pick it up.  The cap doesn&#x27;t actually &#x27;cover&#x27; the sprayer, but it&#x27;s more like a crown ring thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the &#x27;bright&#x27; side, if you do like this scent, it stays on strong for a pretty long time.</li>
    <li> I  am in New York City. I  dance Argentine Tango with different women. So last year,  I decided to  to purchase perfume for  each of them as a  Christmas present, to  thank them . After an exhuastive search, I stumbled upon this perfume on this site. I had bought Vera Wang perfume  for another friend of mine. So, I tried this scent. Every woman that I gave this perfume to last year, loves it.  So, while shopping again for another scent, I will end up purchasing another six perfumes. All in this same scent.  Thank you Vera Wang for making  the women I dance with very happy and my life as a man, a little easier. Happy Holidays and thank you Amazon!</li>
    <li> I always buy the Regular Princess perfume by Vera Wang and thought it would be a good idea to change it up a little with this one. Wasn&#x27;t disappointed to do so the scent is amazing! One of my favorites for sure!!!</li>
    <li> Great smelling perfume!</li>
    <li> Wow this smells very sophisticated.  I thought nothing would be as good as Dolce &amp; Gabbana By Dolce &amp; Gabbana For Women, the red one.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is sexy, mature and seducing in every word.  I love this.  The lid is annoying though with the ring and crown, other then that it&#x27;s THE best perfume I will never stop wearing.</li>
    <li> I am thrilled to add this to my perfume collection. I love this more than the original princess. As soon as I got this I sprayed it on my wrist to smell the berries and this did not disappoint! I was intrigued by the first whiff I got, the scent combination is just lovely. This scent on me smells like Britney Spears Fantasy mixed with the original Vera Wang princess. I can already tell this scent will have a long lasting period and I am happy with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The delivery was kinda slow BUT you can&#x27;t blame mother natural and the storms on the east coast recently otherwise I bet this would of been on time which was Monday the 17th. The packaging is nice and the bottle was beautiful and I adore the glitter :)</li>
    <li> Even though its a EDT the smell lingers for a few hours. It is an everyday scent. Girly and fun. I like it. Shipping was super fast. And the perfume bottle comes with a little ring !! Not that I would wear it</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite fragrance for my girlfriend, she loves it as well.  She&#x27;s had others from Vera Wang, but we both agree this is the best.</li>
    <li> Love this scent. Very sexy and sensual! My boyfriend loves it! Vera has delivered the best scent possible! The has replace my Ralph Lauren Romance, Elizabeth Arden Mediterranean.</li>
    <li> It was given as a gift and she loved it</li>
    <li> Great Price. Smells good too. I bought this for my wife. It was stronger than i thought at first, but after an hour or so it was just right. She likes it too.</li>
    <li> I love it and the price is right!</li>
    <li> It is good and  sweet，I am very happy to have it.&lt;br /&gt;My friend  likes too.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a special lady in my life, made an excellent x-mas gift. Shipped out fast got here intact Gives off an excellent scent and would recommend to anyone wanting a special lady in your life.</li>
    <li> This product smells beautiful! I&#x27;m not one of those people who&#x27;s very good at describing what every single note in the perfume is like, but I&#x27;m here to tell you all that I love it. It has this nice, warm, dark scent. It&#x27;s not your typical light, floral, or sweet perfume. It&#x27;s more of a sensual, deep smell, which have always been my favorite. I&#x27;ve gotten lots of compliments on the smell! I do reapply a couple times throughout the day since the smell wears off mid-day. But otherwise it&#x27;s great! The bottle is gorgeous and I&#x27;m way too scared that I&#x27;m gonna drop it, so I put it back in its box every time I use it. For those of you concerned with how much glitter the bottle sheds, I would not be worried about it. Every once in a while, a few sparkles might fall off, but the appearance of the bottle remains the same and it&#x27;s not like it makes a huge mess. I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I bought a 1.7 ounce bottle loved it so much I had to get the bigger one. My husband loves it he states it drives him crazy. I love that it last all day long and I get so many compliments on it. Thanks Vera Wang you out did yourself again...</li>
    <li> I really like the perfume, but the bottle is awful!! The glitter stuff comes off all over my bathroom counter and sometimes on me.</li>
    <li> Definitely love this perfume. It is bold but beautiful. A little bit goes a long way. The bottle kind of looks like a big lump of coal but whatever. That&#x27;s not that important to me. I would buy this again once it runs out.</li>
    <li> I had been all over trying to find this and everyone kept telling me it was discontinued.  I found it and bought it just in time for Christmas.  Due to the hloidays I was expecting some sort of delay but I was surprised.  It showed up on time and not broken.</li>
    <li> I am so happy I bought this perfume it&#x27;s amazing stuff and it&#x27;s great for Night time and it last a long time.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time was everything we expected it to be. Bought as a gift for valentines day. Exactly whatshe wanted</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like the bottle but do enjoy the smell of it!</li>
    <li> shipped fast makes a great gift</li>
    <li> Took my chances and bought the perfume and it&#x27;s the real deal. Smells beautiful; it&#x27;s very sweet but soft and not too overpowering. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s lasting power is average. I can&#x27;t smell it on me after a 10-hour shift at work but I do get small whiffs here and there throughout the day. If you want to test this one out first before buying, Ulta has the small rollerball version for twelve bucks or so. One complaint I do have (and it&#x27;s the only one) is that it does leave quite a bit of glitter here and there. The bottle is a little larger than my palm so I can still throw it in my bag, but be warned if you do the same you will have dark, purple glitter sprinkled everywhere. Luckily, it&#x27;s heavy and rough glitter that doesn&#x27;t stick. Packaging was exactly how it&#x27;s pictured above. Overall, I would recommend this perfume to those who enjoy sweet and soft perfumes.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume.  I got it as a Christmas gift two years ago and I just finished it. I&#x27;ve been going crazy looking for it in stores and no luck or if they do have it it&#x27;s twice as much.  Looks like I&#x27;m getting it online.</li>
    <li> I love the Vera Wang Princess Night. My boyfriend purchased it for my birthday and I immediatly loved it. I&#x27;ve always worn Vera Wang Perfume. I have the regular Vera Wang Princess and love that as well. This was a great addition to my collection. Fabulous product!</li>
    <li> This is hard to find in stores and my daughter just loves this perfume. Everyone is happy. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best fragrances that Vera has released in the Princess line.  The smell stands out and is very distinctive.  I love the blend of floral that she developed because unlike the Rock Princess version, this fragrance smells sexy.  The hint of jasmine and violet set this fragrance apart from the other Princess fragrances.  If you love Rock Princess, you will love this fragrance as well.</li>
    <li> After loving the original Princess fragrance so much, I wanted to try this.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s got a great fruity scent that&#x27;s somewhat spicy. Contrary to the name though, I think it&#x27;s best suited for day and evening wear. This fragrance is quite a bit heavier than the original Princess because of the musk but it&#x27;s just as pleasant and enjoyable. At first, the musk and watermelon notes are most notable but it wears down into a very soft orange and berry scent. The vanilla base note is overpowered by the musk its sweetness is definitely detectable.&lt;br /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s an absolutely lovely perfume which is no surprise coming from Vera Wang.</li>
    <li> Came on time, packages nicely, I haven&#x27;t gotten a chance to smell it yet it&#x27;s a Christmas present so waiting to smell in Christmas eve when we open presents. xD I&#x27;m sure it smells great though!</li>
    <li> this one is my absolute favorite of all the Vera Wang fragrances, It is disappointing  that it was only offered for a year</li>
    <li> This perfume has a really nice sweet and floral scent to it which I love! My sinuses are awful and this is mild enough not to affect them but interesting enough to spark a convo!</li>
    <li> I made the mistake of buying this before smelling it. I own two other perfumes from the line (&#x27;Princess&#x27; and &#x27;Preppy Princess&#x27;) and love both of them and I assumed from the description of &#x27;Princess Night&#x27; that I would love this even more than those but that is not the case. It smells awful and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Vera wang&#x27;s princess night perfume is amazing! It arrived within a week and has hints of vanilla in the berry scent. Perfect for school, or nighttime. The bottle is so cute! I love the shape and the sparkles. It perfectly compliments the scent itself! If your iffy about a perfume, just get this one! I highly reccomend it!!</li>
    <li> I ran across this fragrance at Ulta and from the first spray knew I had to have it, but I didn&#x27;t want to pay the Ulta price.  So, I immediately got online and found it on Amazon for way cheaper.  HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO ME!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Christmas present for my wife who really likes the original Vera Wang Princess fragrance and she thinks this one is even better. Very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I have always been a fan of Rock Princess, and I was hesitant at first to try a new scent when I was so dead-set on the one I already loved, but since Rock Princess was unavailable at the time, I decided to give this one a shot. I am so glad I did! It is strong enough to last through the night, but not so strong that people can smell it before you enter the room. I am in love,</li>
    <li> Got it in a timely manner! Perfect!</li>
    <li> When i read the description before i bought it i thought maybe it would be alot like what i already wear ( clinique happy, jlo live luxe, vera wang princess,  ed hardy villian ) . i like it better than the regular vera wang princess. this perfume is definitely alot deeper and heavier than i thought but it does smell good. probably wont buy it again but i also wont return it.</li>
    <li> Now this perfum right here is for special occasion. People always ask what i am wearing. You should wear when your going on a date or something, but you can wear it for everyday if you like.</li>
