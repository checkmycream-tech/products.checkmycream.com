      <li>I should have chanced the cranberry color which I thought would be too bright.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m fair skin</li>
      <li>Good stuff.</li>
      <li>The color was good too.</li>
      <li>I have freckles &amp; a fair complexion.</li>

      <li>I love this!</li>
      <li>Love this blush!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pleased to say that this is the best blush I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;m comparing it to very high end cosmetics.  </li>
      <li>The cream blush is very easy to use.</li>
      <li>Color is exactly as shown and good for fair skinned blondes.  </li>
      <li>Bliss is a great color -- very natural looking and works well with fair skin.</li>
      <li>Love, love, love this blush!</li>
      <li>as I said the color is rich and looks good on, I just reapply it thru out the day.</li>
      <li>I have used many cream blushes in my years…and this is by far the best cream blush.  </li>
      <li>(Mary Kay advertises that this cream blush is buildable...meaning the more you layer, the deeper the color).</li>
      <li>Stays on better than powders.</li>
      <li>May work better on someone else.</li>
      <li>Purchased this item and love it.  </li>
      <li>I thought this blush would give me more of a glow being a cream but didn&#x27;t.  </li>
      <li>I have switched to Clinique&#x27;s cream cheek color in a stick and love it.  </li>
      <li>This blush is okay.</li>
      <li>Love the creaminess of this cheek</li>
      <li>It is very controllable and blends very nicely...</li>
      <li>This is a pretty good blush.</li>
      <li>Easy to use and stays on.</li>
      <li>the texture is light and easy to apply.</li>
      <li>The texture is light and creamy; the color has good staying power, and the color is beautiful and delicate.  </li>
      <li>This is creamy and goes on smoothly, although I like to dab my sponge in water before applying to think it out just a bit.</li>
      <li>I have used this product before and it goes on creamy smooth and gives your face a satin look.  </li>
      <li>The color was very nice and it is creamy but for me it did not have the staying power that is why I gave it only 4 stars.</li>
      <li>If you are familiar with Mary Kay products, I use Luminous Wear Foundation #6.  </li>
      <li>cheeks have Nice color and look natural.</li>
      <li>It goes on nice and last quite a while.  </li>
      <li>Nice cream blush, is sheer</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always liked MK blush,but only the cream.  </li>
      <li>This is by far superior in how it feels on the face and in the natural look of the blush.  </li>
      <li>Been using this Blush for years - most natural looking and easiest to apply.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Tried many others and nothing looks as natural or goes on as smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Last</li>
      <li>so just the right amount of color.</li>
      <li>The color is exactly as shown and</li>
      <li>A tiny bit does the trick, blends easily.</li>
      <li>The texture doesn&#x27;t interfere with foundation and blends very well.  </li>
      <li>AGAIN, within 2 weeks the top fell off and part of the plastic closure piece broke in half.  </li>
      <li>I hope Mary Kay never stops making this particular product.  </li>
      <li>You can build your color to a high intensity by applying it in layers.  </li>
      <li>It is like a soft and slightly moist powder that goes on very easily and looks professional!</li>
      <li>This blush does a great job and does not give you scary cheek bones which I was concerned about when using a cream blush.  </li>
      <li>I discovered that I love some of Mary Kay&#x27;s Timewise skin care products &amp; a few of their make-up products as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s subtle but yet quite effective and lasts all day.  </li>
      <li>The case on the first one simply fell apart when perhaps 5% of the product had been used.  </li>
      <li>But Mary Kay has of course mastered this cosmetic conundrum and produced a cream blush that beautifully blends, never becoming chalky or overly slick.</li>
      <li>I was looking for an inexpensive blush, cream, that would give me a soft glow.  </li>
      <li>The color would work for anyone, I think, since it blends so well and just looks like naturally rosy cheeks.</li>
      <li>This blush glides on like a cream &amp; transforms to a natural looking powdery finish.</li>
      <li>Sheer Bliss blush looks very natural on me.</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t super thick and creamy as you would imagine a cream blush to be.</li>

    <li> Love this blush! I have never tried a cream blush before! I will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> I looooooooooove this cream blush! For years I was fearful of trying cream blushes, thinking they&#x27;d be oily or clumpy, or just plain gaudy to look at. But Mary Kay has of course mastered this cosmetic conundrum and produced a cream blush that beautifully blends, never becoming chalky or overly slick. I recommend the \\&quot;Sheer Bliss\\&quot; over the \\&quot;Cranberry\\&quot;, which I felt was a bit overpowering on the cheeks. But that&#x27;s my personal preference...either way, I recommend.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this blush! It isn&#x27;t super thick and creamy as you would imagine a cream blush to be. It is like a soft and slightly moist powder that goes on very easily and looks professional! I will definitely be ordering this blush again when I need to.</li>
    <li> I always thought Mary Kay products were overpriced so I was stubborn &amp; never tried them...that is until one of my friends started selling Mary Kay. I discovered that I love some of Mary Kay&#x27;s Timewise skin care products &amp; a few of their make-up products as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently tried Mary Kay&#x27;s Cream Blush, Sheer Bliss. If you are familiar with Mary Kay products, I use Luminous Wear Foundation #6.  I have freckles &amp; a fair complexion. Sheer Bliss blush looks very natural on me. However, it is so sheer that I apply  3 layers of Sheer Bliss so the color is deeper.  (Mary Kay advertises that this cream blush is buildable...meaning the more you layer, the deeper the color). This blush glides on like a cream &amp; transforms to a natural looking powdery finish. It contains skin-protecting antioxidants. Health magazine awarded it the Best Blush.</li>
    <li> Purchased this item and love it.  Color is exactly as shown and good for fair skinned blondes.  There&#x27;s enough color to actually bronze your cheeks and it&#x27;s not too opaque.  Will definitely re-order when used up</li>
    <li> This is a great neutral color and lasts all day for me.  This is the second compact I have bought.  I hope that Mary Kay continues to have this item in their product line.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before and it goes on creamy smooth and gives your face a satin look.  Other cream blushes are sometimes on the dry side.</li>
    <li> Best cream blush that I have ever used. It is very controllable and blends very nicely...I will probably never switch again...user for life!!!!</li>
    <li> I was looking for an inexpensive blush, cream, that would give me a soft glow.  This blush is too thin and does not do anything visible.</li>
    <li> Speedy delivery; great condition; just what I wanted.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I took a chance and ordered this online without ever seeing it or testing it.  I&#x27;m pleased to say that this is the best blush I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;m comparing it to very high end cosmetics.  This is by far superior in how it feels on the face and in the natural look of the blush.  I hope Mary Kay never stops making this particular product.  The color would work for anyone, I think, since it blends so well and just looks like naturally rosy cheeks.</li>
    <li> I have been using MK products for the last 25 years and I would never change brand. The cream blush is very easy to use.</li>
    <li> I love this! I used to have such oily skin, and now it&#x27;s dry (ahem, yes, I&#x27;ve aged). This is creamy and goes on smoothly, although I like to dab my sponge in water before applying to think it out just a bit. Bliss is a great color -- very natural looking and works well with fair skin.</li>
    <li> Love the creaminess of this cheek blush - the color is subtle and goes with everything. What would I do without these wonderful Mary Kay products? I would be a very unhappy gal.</li>
    <li> Nice cream blush, is sheer but I&#x27;m fair skin so just the right amount of color. Stays on better than powders.</li>
    <li> Great shade.&lt;br /&gt;Cream based a plus&lt;br /&gt;I apply, let &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34;, then rub in. Otherwise it wipes all off. ( my experience, anyway)&lt;br /&gt;I keep as back-up in my purse.</li>
    <li> I thought this blush would give me more of a glow being a cream but didn&#x27;t.  Very sheer color.  I should have chanced the cranberry color which I thought would be too bright.</li>
    <li> Good stuff. A tiny bit does the trick, blends easily.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always liked MK blush,but only the cream.  It goes on nice and last quite a while.  The color was good too.</li>
    <li> perfect color and texture</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to use a cream blush, but was not happy with the other blushes I had been using.  This blush does a great job and does not give you scary cheek bones which I was concerned about when using a cream blush.  You can build your color to a high intensity by applying it in layers.

    <li> This blush is okay. It is a little lighter than I thought. I&#x27;m used to a slightly darker color than this shade.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good blush. The color was very nice and it is creamy but for me it did not have the staying power that is why I gave it only 4 stars. May work better on someone else. I do use it and as I said the color is rich and looks good on, I just reapply it thru out the day.</li>
    <li> Have used for years.  Tried many others and nothing looks as natural or goes on as smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Last a long time as you just use a touch.  I think it beats anything on the market.&lt;br /&gt;LOVE THIS BLUSH AND BECAUSE IT IS MARY KAY IT IS GREAT FOR YOUR SKIN !</li>
    <li> I have used many cream blushes in my years…and this is by far the best cream blush.  The texture is light and creamy; the color has good staying power, and the color is beautiful and delicate.  It&#x27;s subtle but yet quite effective and lasts all day.  The texture doesn&#x27;t interfere with foundation and blends very well.  HOWEVER, this is my second purchase of this product.  The case on the first one simply fell apart when perhaps 5% of the product had been used.  I figured it was a care, faulty case... So, I repurchased the item.  AGAIN, within 2 weeks the top fell off and part of the plastic closure piece broke in half.  I tossed this and will not purchase again!  I have switched to Clinique&#x27;s cream cheek color in a stick and love it.  Sorry, Mary Kay, but your packaging quality, in general, has declined to the point I will no longer use Mary Kay products.</li>
    <li> This is what you want in a cream blush. Easy to use and stays on. Who can go wrong with Mary Kay?</li>
    <li> Been using this Blush for years - most natural looking and easiest to apply.&lt;br /&gt;My cheeks have Nice color and look natural. I buy several at a time in case it gets discontinued.</li>
    <li> The color is exactly as shown and the texture is light and easy to apply. Great product, would recommend to a friend.</li>
