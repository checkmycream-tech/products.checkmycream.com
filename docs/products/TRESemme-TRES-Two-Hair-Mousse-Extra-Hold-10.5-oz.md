      <li>Their natural line (I don&#x27;t know the name for sure) does not use gelatin but seems to have a very different formula I wasn&#x27;t really impressed with.</li>
      <li>I took one star because I have to check the bottle every time, and another because they are not vegetarian friendly.  </li>
      <li>I have nearly a full can of it</li>
      <li>let it dry softly and then get up in teh AM to flawless curls indeed.</li>
      <li>All this said, TRESemme seems to change the formula erratically, or there are many older bottles out there.  </li>
      <li>Then I part it, put in the smallest amount possible of lotion creme (also from TRESemme&#x27;s Flawless Curls line if my hair super dry), and work the mousse through my went hair with my fingers.  </li>

<li> I use the curling iron to create loose waves and with these products, my style lasts several days.  </li>
<li> I like the product&#x27;s performance, leaves curls fairly soft while also holding their shape with little frizz.  </li>

<li> I buy it at TJ Maxx for $10 and it lasts a long time, even with my shoulder length hair.  </li>
<li> It obviously has waxes in it and doesn&#x27;t rinse out as easily as other products on day 2.  </li>
<li> All i do is  use a quarter size of mousse and scrunch it into my hair and then let it hair dry.</li>
<li> I just let it air dry</li>
<li> I now let it dry overnight and use a curling iron in the morning.  </li>
<li> But it definitely keeps the frizzy hair down when I wear my hair in a pony tail before it dries.</li>
<li> I do sometimes touch up before I leave somewhere by wetting my hands and putting a small amount of mousse in them and really gently smoothing out any messy areas with my fingers.  </li>
<li> this product has gelatin which, depending on whether you are an actual vegetarian or a person who \\&quot;tends to consume less animal</li>
<li> but I&#x27;m not certain I will buy it again.</li>
<li> If you&#x27;re tired of searching for products that really live up to the hype, give one of these a try.  </li>

<li> I thought that the Tresemme would have won over, but GF curl products won hands down for my med-thick, wavy hair.</li>
<li> I used it and just weighed hair down and didn&#x27;t help at all with curls.</li>
<li> It holds curls well and makes them shiny and keeps it from puffing up unless you lay on it and mess it up.</li>
<li> It makes my hair a little bit crunchy</li>
<li> Then I blot my hair with the towel, scrunching up a little to return the curls to how they were before I raked my fingers through them with product, and I&#x27;m done.  </li>
<li> Although it was inexpensive, I don&#x27;t like to waste money on something that doesn&#x27;t perform as it should.  </li>
<li> but if that happens usually i will just scrunch my hair till my curls soften.</li>
<li> I have thick curly hair</li>
<li> I use this product everyday and i haven&#x27;t been disappointed.</li>
<li> You won&#x27;t be sorry.  </li>

    <li> * Garnier Fructis Curl Products worked better for my hair  * Try the Garnier Fructis curl inject mouse and curl spray gel   * I thought that the Tresemme would have won over, but GF curl products won hands down for my med-thick, wavy hair.</li>
    <li> I like the product&#x27;s performance, leaves curls fairly soft while also holding their shape with little frizz.  The smell is nice, I got lots of compliments on that.  Any crunch is gone fairly soon.  \\&quot;Next day hair\\&quot; is fantastic, better than day one usually.  All this said, TRESemme seems to change the formula erratically, or there are many older bottles out there.  Either way if you do happen to be a vegetarian this product has gelatin which, depending on whether you are an actual vegetarian or a person who \\&quot;tends to consume less animal products\\&quot;, is a no go.  I took one star because I have to check the bottle every time, and another because they are not vegetarian friendly.  Their natural line (I don&#x27;t know the name for sure) does not use gelatin but seems to have a very different formula I wasn&#x27;t really impressed with.</li>
    <li> Years ago I tried a ton of products trying to find one to work with my hair.  And this was it!  It&#x27;s affordable and works great.  I just wash my hair, condition, and comb it out.  Then I part it, put in the smallest amount possible of lotion creme (also from TRESemme&#x27;s Flawless Curls line if my hair super dry), and work the mousse through my went hair with my fingers.  I admittedly use a lot more than they suggest, but my hair is super thick.  Then I blot my hair with the towel, scrunching up a little to return the curls to how they were before I raked my fingers through them with product, and I&#x27;m done.  I just let it air dry and it&#x27;s great!  I do sometimes touch up before I leave somewhere by wetting my hands and putting a small amount of mousse in them and really gently smoothing out any messy areas with my fingers.  I really wish this were a subscribe and save item.  I&#x27;d be all over that.</li>
    <li> I have spent money for YEARS trying to find a curl creme or mouse that left my hair soft shiny and frizz free.  I never checked Tresseme.  I thought it was to cheap to be good.  I usually spend $19 dollars per bottle on Big Sexy curls.  When my local store ran out and were out of my old decent back ups.  I decided to give this a try. WOW.  My curls are Soft, Shiny and frizz free.  I am converted.  This is the best I have ever used.  And it even smells great.</li>
    <li> This product is great I have used it at home and love it just mix it with a good curl creme after you condition and you get soft defined curls! I LOVE THIS, I normally really dislike mousses because my hair always gets crunchy but not this!</li>
    <li> Okay so I thought I&#x27;d get this review out of the way. It holds curls well and makes them shiny and keeps it from puffing up unless you lay on it and mess it up. It makes hair shiny and healthy looking and I like that it&#x27;s alcohol free the only downside to it is it will be crunchy if you put too much in but other than that it&#x27;s really good to scrunch with. God bless all.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this mousse and it came as promised.</li>
    <li> The tressemme naturals mousse was okay, it didn&#x27;t work on my hair his i thought it would. Maybe I just didn&#x27;t know how to use it..</li>
    <li> I love this mousse. It makes my hair so curly and soft with no frizz. I love to shower at night time then let it dry softly and then get up in teh AM to flawless curls indeed. I have very difficult hair and I wouldn&#x27;t trade this for any expensive product.. Great product!!!</li>
    <li> I use tresemme curl care after every shampoo, It holds  beautifully</li>
    <li> Not at all what described.I used it and just weighed hair down and didn&#x27;t help at all with curls.</li>
    <li> Product as described and delivered in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> Like the feel and holds well on fine hair</li>
    <li> Eh, this mousse is fine.  I like it because it&#x27;s alcohol free, which means my curls won&#x27;t be crunchy and dried otu.  But it&#x27;s definitely a low-cost mousse.  It obviously has waxes in it and doesn&#x27;t rinse out as easily as other products on day 2.  I&#x27;m keeping it and will use it but I&#x27;m not certain I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have natural curls but i do have some frizz this mousse makes my hair extra curly with all that volume and not all stiffnand flaky definetly recommend.</li>
    <li> I want a mousse that makes my hair semi-hard, and I thought this was it. It worked, but because it&#x27;s called \\&quot;extra hold\\&quot;, I wanted a little more.</li>
    <li> This is the best thing for curly hair! It calms my frizz and gives me loads of pretty curls. It makes my hair a little bit crunchy so I only use it when I&#x27;m going out somewhere important. Otherwise I just use TRESemme Flawless Curls Curl Hydration Lotion Creme. But this product works wonders!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t use two dollops of you have short hair. One is enough if you want a manageable hold.</li>
    <li> Great mousse, been using this for years on my naturally curly hair</li>
    <li> Very good product and will order again</li>
    <li> I have thick, dark, naturally curly hair that even forums ringlets on its own so I had trouble finding a good mousse. This product really does it for me I just wish that it would hold longer. It is affordable and I think if I use other products I will be totally satisfied. :) Worth trying!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why I bought this, I don&#x27;t even have curly hair. But it definitely keeps the frizzy hair down when I wear my hair in a pony tail before it dries.</li>
    <li> This mousse didn&#x27;t do much when I simply blow dry my hair with a diffuser.  The natural wave in my hair did show up, but it fell flat soon thereafter.  Even with the addition of hairspray.  I now don&#x27;t style my hair that way anymore.  I now let it dry overnight and use a curling iron in the morning.  This mousse works better with high heat but not by much.  It doesn&#x27;t work as well for me as the Bumble and Bumble Does It All styling spray, which is considerably more expensive but works like magic.  I&#x27;ve tried many different mousse products and the best one I&#x27;ve found it TIGI Catwalk Strong Mousse.  It truly holds my hard-to-hold hair no matter how I style it.  I buy it at TJ Maxx for $10 and it lasts a long time, even with my shoulder length hair.  Also good is Got2be&#x27;s Kinky Curling Mousse.  Both products are far better than Tresemme.  I have nearly a full can of it and it&#x27;s on the shelf because I simply can&#x27;t find a use for it.  Although it was inexpensive, I don&#x27;t like to waste money on something that doesn&#x27;t perform as it should.  Sometimes you get what you pay for.  However, Tresemme&#x27;s new runway collection Perfectly Undone hairspray really does what it promises.  I get soft, touchable hold that works even in high humidity.  I also like Nexxus&#x27;s Comb Thru hairspray which also has flexible hold and is truly amazing.  The Tresemme hairspray is about $6 and the Nexxus spray is about $10.  If you&#x27;re looking for products that truly do what they promise and you&#x27;re tired of spending money on wasted claims, then the products I&#x27;ve recommended will be good for you too.  I have wavy, medium textured hair that&#x27;s color treated and layered.  I use the curling iron to create loose waves and with these products, my style lasts several days.  I also use a hair primer, Bumble and Bumble Invisible Oil primer, that creates the perfect, frizz free canvas.  It also adds shine and provides thermal protection.  Another good primer is available at Sally&#x27;s (or on Amazon), Beyond the Zone&#x27;s Smooth Criminal, which is about $7 at the Sally Beauty Supply store.  My husband even uses it and it tames his coarse curly hair like magic.  Every time I read a negative review, I wish the author would give the name(s) of products that they&#x27;ve found really work, not just his/her opinion on the styling product.  Here, I&#x27;ve done that.  For what it&#x27;s worth, these products give me shiny, soft hold that truly looks great (like I&#x27;ve just stepped out of the salon) and stays put for several days.  If you&#x27;re tired of searching for products that really live up to the hype, give one of these a try.  You won&#x27;t be sorry.  I don&#x27;t recommend this Tresemme mousse.

    <li> I have thick curly hair and i started using this product to maintain frizz and keep my curls looking shiny.I use this product everyday and i haven&#x27;t been disappointed.If you put too much it can make your curls crunchy once your hair dries but if that happens usually i will just scrunch my hair till my curls soften. I like to use this product after i shower while my hair is still damp. All i do is  use a quarter size of mousse and scrunch it into my hair and then let it hair dry. Make sure you don&#x27;t touch it ! Then bam you get flawless curls for an affordable price.</li>
