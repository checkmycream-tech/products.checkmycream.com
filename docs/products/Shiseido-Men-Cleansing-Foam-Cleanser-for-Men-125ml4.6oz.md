      <li>This is pretty much the ultimate face cleaner.</li>
      <li>I find it is just a little strong on my skin</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love this product, just a small dime size amounts creates a lot of lather and the smell is great too, plus your face feels great after you wash it!</li>
    <li> Lathers extremely well.  Leaves no residue.  Cleans well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to the excellent lathering, you can use quite a small amount for each wash.  One container lasts me around six months (~one wash per day).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the tube design needs to be rethought a bit.  The last, maybe, 1/5th of the product takes a good bit of work to coax out of the tube.  The last 1/8th is downright troublesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, i highly recommend Shiseido&#x27;s cleansers.  Their moisturizers, however, contain alcohol.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over 20 years.  Great skin care for men. Product not available in this part of the country.  Glad Amazon has it.  Excellent price.</li>
    <li> Husband has used this product for years and loves it!</li>
    <li> This is pretty much the ultimate face cleaner. It is so concentrated that 1 4.2 oz tube can last 3 months. The lather is thick and luxurious. Indulge!</li>
    <li> I am so glad that I stumbled upon this cleanser. With a very small dab, you get a thick, rich lather. I love the fragrance.  Leaves my skin soft &amp; fresh. I use it twice a day with my Clarisonic and my skin looks better than it has in ages. You have to try this!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 8 months and really like it.  Lightly scented and lathers nicely.  A little bit goes a long way which is good since this is not a cheap product. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> Leaves face feeling clean but not too dry. Can even be used as shaving foam (Shiseido&#x27;s suggestion, and I agree). A bit expensive, though. However, I believe personal care products depend on compatibility with your body, so what works for me may not work for you.</li>
    <li> A good cleanser offered by Shiseido Men.  Foams up quite a bit and rinses off really well.  There is a light scent that is not overpowering.  Good product -- I would recommend.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a great products! I bought two for my husband and he loves it! i will definitely purchase it again!</li>
    <li> I recommend this face wash to everyone. It leaves my face feeling smooth, fresh, and clean.&lt;br /&gt;I love the scent, it reminds me of asian tea.</li>
    <li> Shiseido foam cleansers are good. They gives you a feeling of fresh and cleanness. Does the cleaning job well. I use very tiny amount of it and get a lot of foam, that&#x27;s relatively easy to rinse off. I use it in the evening but generally not in the morning and it lasted me about 14 months.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful combination of face wash and shave lather. I use it for both and it is as good as any gel that I have used.</li>
    <li> Got a travel size kit on a layover in Norita to try out the brand. Just a little drop to clean entire face. Great product.</li>
    <li> I am getting old and it helps to retain youthfulness just a little longer. So when you have no time, I must make it up with money...</li>
    <li> I bought this cleanser for my boyfriend and he loves it. He doesn&#x27;t have to use a lot of product for it to foam. A little bit goes a long way. In terms of scent, it&#x27;s not too fragrantly strong/musk like the Axe products, but at the same time it doesn&#x27;t smell feminine either. Sometimes when I run out of cleanser I borrow. You can also use it to double as shaving cream.</li>
    <li> This product works great. This bottle will last me a long time since the amount required to wash your face is barely anything.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and can recommend it to anyone.  I use other Shiseido products and would recommend those as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using shiseido men cleansing foam (along with their moisturizing emulsion and eye soother) for over ten years now. I&#x27;ve occasionally tried some other products, but I always go back to Shiseido Men. It&#x27;s the best, hands down. It smells great, does a great job, and you only need a tiny amount. It&#x27;s a little pricy, but you need so little that one tube lasts months.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t complain about the product nor the seller. It got here before I expected, in great conditions and most of all, it&#x27;s just what I pay for; love it!!!</li>
    <li> This is the third time I have reordered this product. It works wonderfully well and is refreshing. It doesn&#x27;t overdry the skin, even though I use it daily. I started with their lotion as an after-shave and it is the only product not to leave my skin feeling oily. I then purchased this cleanser and haven&#x27;t looked back since. I am 100% sold!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very gentle, so I don&#x27;t feel much refreshed after using it. But I feel comfortable and clean. My skin is oily. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have used this cleaners along with Shiseido Moisturizing Emulsion for years, super quality product.  As a male this is about as fancy as I get and can remember daily.  Using these two products for a male esp. with &amp;quot;T&amp;quot; zone complexion is a perfect match.  They also make a little exfoliating brush that I use when I remember.  It doesn&#x27;t take much and usually I go through a bottle simply because I use too much.  Just a pea size dab should do the trick.  If you are tough guy weekend warrior like me never putting on sunscreen flyfishing, shooting, etc.  I do actually notice the difference when I consistently use both products and when I run out and lazy and don&#x27;t want to run to Nordstroms.  However after this last trip and see their prices pulled out iPhone Amazon app and what do you know each product was half the price.  Good deal!</li>
    <li> I love this cleaning foam cleanser. Through years of kinds of cleansers, this is the one best fit people who has dry skins.</li>
    <li> Gets my skin very clean!  I don&#x27;t know why it is listed being for men.  Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
    <li> Great face cleanser for both genders.</li>
    <li> Cleanser smells great! I find it is just a little strong on my skin and I find the texture being a little &amp;#34;squeaky&amp;#34; after my clean. would&#x27;ve given it a 5 otherwise!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Always trusted quality from Shiseido.</li>
    <li> I Like this product. It&#x27;s very good. When i began to use it, my skin have been changing for best.</li>
    <li> I use this to wet shave with a badger hair shaving brush for several years. It is MUCH better than other shaving soaps on the market. As the other reviews, you only need a small amount to get a wonderful, rich, full face of foam. Smells great, lubricates well to avoid blade rash. It lasts six months or more of shaving every day, so I believe the value is good compared to what you get from it.  I HIGHLY recommend as a shaving foam.</li>
    <li> Feels great and a little bit goes quite a long way,  just a dab on my finger lathers up very well.  Keeps my face clear, has a mild scent and is an excellent addition to my routine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many facial cleansers but this is by far the best in its price range. Leaves the skin free of dirt and oil without drying it. It works great as a shaving medium too. Great product plus the comfort of buying it online.</li>
    <li> Best men&#x27;s facial cleanser made.  Been using Shiseido since 1991.</li>
