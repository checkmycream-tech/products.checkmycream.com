      <li>Great price</li>
      <li>It works great with my curls.</li>
      <li>Great Deal</li>
      <li>, my friend indicated that she will use this line for years to come , as she was so happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
      <li>Really good deal, though.</li>
      <li>she styles her hair and told me that it was good with the styling</li>
      <li>Anyone who says this is a good product is lying.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve done a fair share of damage to my hair with bleaching, dying and straightening, but it manages to revive the curl pattern well.</li>
      <li>This hair lotion does to the hair what a good moisturizer does to you</li>
      <li>Motions At Home Oil Moisturizer Hair Lotion is good to keep your hair from breaking and helping your hair from frizzing up throughout the day.</li>
      <li>This product has a nice, pleasant scent.</li>
      <li>This hair lotion is very light and smells great.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s probably a perfect balance between how much will give you the shine and moisture you desire</li>
      <li>It smells nice, which is a plus</li>
      <li>But too each his own - 3 stars for me.</li>
      <li>first, Motions At Home Oil Moisturizer Hair Lotion seems great.</li>
      <li>it was more of a conditioner product --</li>
      <li>Since there are so many hair lotions on the market, I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;d recommend this one over any of the others.</li>
      <li>hair did feel a bit better.</li>
      <li>It lasts all day and delivers a shiny, healthy look as promised.  </li>
      <li>The consistency is smooth and the scent is nice almost calming when you or others smell it</li>
      <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, it resulted in more of a greasy look rather than the shine I was looking for.</li>
      <li>I do like the scent, but what this product does is more coat</li>
      <li>I love that this moisturizing oil has so many different uses and is the perfect accessory for healthy hair.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love Motions At Home Oil Moisturizing Hair Lotion.  </li>
      <li>: Motions needs to find a more appealing fragrance.</li>
      <li>dear friend for many a year , I was ecstatic myself.</li>
      <li>This hair lotion like most of the others</li>
      <li>It made my hair more manageable, sleeker and noticably shinier.  </li>
      <li>Motions may not have a great scent, but it does make it easier to gain control of your hair and make it look healthy and vibrant.</li>
      <li>First the good, with Motions At Home Oil Moisturizer Hair Lotion.</li>
      <li>frizz free and leaves my curls beautiful and soft!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Putting this product to the test shows that most of what it claims is true and the most noticeable difference is the shine.</li>
      <li>I also think it might not be the best thing for fine/thin hair it will weight you down abit.</li>
      <li>If you need only a bit of help, this could work great.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Motions Oil Moisturizer is also perfect to put on your hair whenever you will be applying heat because this keeps your hair from being brittle and dry while keeping your hair soft and healthy.  </li>
      <li>Motions products are generally quite good.  </li>
      <li>the product was clean and had no leaks.  </li>
      <li>I love this product so much.</li>
      <li>This product offers good quality and really works as intended.  </li>
      <li>I loved this hair product it keeps my long curly hair</li>
      <li>I can honestly say that I will not be buying these products anytime in the future.</li>
      <li>The product was fresh,</li>
      <li>I tried to use this on her hair after it was freshly washed and conditioned.  </li>
      <li>The ladies in my house agree that the product is worth buying for this reason alone.&lt;br</li>
      <li>oil moisturizing is a good idea but doesn&#x27;t really provide the moisture necessary for your hair to thrive, so that you feel your hair become even drier after use.</li>
      <li>the hair rather than get absorbed in the follicles.  </li>
      <li>Bottom line, great at first, but definitely a down side.</li>
      <li>reason would be that the ingredient list here consists of mineral oils, which generally trap moisture and do a lot more damage than they are worth.</li>
      <li>In hindsight this is probably not the right kind of product for my short straight hair.  </li>
      <li>The real key to this lotion working successfully on your hair and scalp is to use it daily.</li>
      <li>\\&quot;Moisturizer Hair Lotion\\&quot; seemed pretty obvious.&lt;br</li>
      <li>is enough to make it look shiny and healthy.</li>
      <li>stop using too much product you say!  </li>
      <li>I really can&#x27;t review how well this product worked since I was only able to use it on my son one time.  </li>
      <li>This one worked ok on my daughter&#x27;s waist long hair</li>
      <li>I only wished that Motions&#x27; other products worked as successfully as these two did.</li>
      <li>I use this on my braids before I add my hair extensions and this prevents my real hair from breaking while it is braided.</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, this product is really a sort of styling oil.</li>
      <li>and I really appreciate that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>lucky me) and this product smooths my hair like no other product I&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great value because you only need to use a small amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Just not the typical fruity, flowery fragrance most are used to.</li>
      <li>We&#x27;ve tried several motions products and most are total grease bombs.  </li>
      <li>and I think this is mainly for ethnic hair)</li>
      <li>Your hair will obviously be a little more on the oily side.</li>
      <li>Provided to a great friend for a long period of time , along with several other Motions at Home products , she was ecstatic with the results.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I tried it on clean dry hair as a styling aid.  </li>
      <li>I have long, wavy hair, and it might work better for someone who has different type of hair.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s definitely a few cons that prevented me from enjoying this</li>
      <li>This product is good, but its certainly not great.</li>
      <li>management is easy when your locks are short and thin, but it can be a real challenge for those with thick/coarse hair that needs greater attention.</li>
      <li>The Motions At Home Oil Moisturizer Hair Lotion works pretty good, but a little heavy for my taste.</li>
      <li>and I haven&#x27;t seen it in a store when I&#x27;ve looked ( probably because I live in Utah</li>
      <li>In this area, Motions is about as good as any, but I agree that there are other de-tangling products that work as well for less cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair</li>
      <li>Other reviewers have also noted that this product is most likely intended for African-Americans.  </li>
      <li>I used this product on my five year old daughter who has very curly, mixed hair.  </li>
      <li>I have naturally frizzy hair (</li>
      <li>It makes my natural curls curl without frizzing.</li>
      <li>Makes my hair soft, shiny, and all that I want.</li>
      <li>I am pleasantly surprised at the results.</li>
      <li>Hair does look more radiant when this product is used and it takes only a small amount to achieve this goal.</li>
      <li>All in all, it took about two washing just to get my hair back to feeling like normal.</li>
      <li>It is not stellar, but for the price, it is worth a try as everyone&#x27;s hair is different.  </li>
      <li>I think this might be useful to replenish a more or less natural level of &#x27;oiliness&#x27; after washing / conditioning, which, for me at least, leaves my hair sort of dry and frizzy for the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>These Motions products are, I think, developed for people with a very different hair type than mine.</li>
      <li>Since the Motions Naturally You Moisturizing Cleanser and Deep Conditioning Masque did not leave her hair feeling moisturized</li>
      <li>These were the only two products that did not tangle my hair and left it feeling soft and somewhat moisturized.</li>
      <li>It is a decent sized bottle, so for me, with regular use, this bottle could last a long time.</li>
      <li>When you first put it on in the morning it makes your hair feel moisturized but after a few hours you hair will feel like a brillo pad.</li>
      <li>Happily, a simple rinse and towel dry later, my hair looked basically normal.</li>
      <li>but too much will be a mess.  </li>

<li> And after I&#x27;ve styled and dried, my curls are soft and bouncy.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great price Great Deal I am grateful.  It was what I ordered.  the product was clean and had no leaks.  The product was fresh,</li>
    <li> This hair lotion is very light and smells great. Your scalp&#x27;s pores will not be clogged which causes lots of itching and dandruff. The real key to this lotion working successfully on your hair and scalp is to use it daily.</li>
    <li> I loved this hair product it keeps my long curly hair frizz free and leaves my curls beautiful and soft!</li>
    <li> This works well on my hair when I use a small amount in the shower.  It makes my natural curls curl without frizzing. I used to use this all the time and I haven&#x27;t seen it in a store when I&#x27;ve looked ( probably because I live in Utah and I think this is mainly for ethnic hair) so I found this for only 3.99 as an add on item and got it. Well I guess I&#x27;ll never run out again, because this is a pack of SIX. Oops. Really good deal, though.</li>
    <li> Motions At Home Oil Moisturizer Hair Lotion is good to keep your hair from breaking and helping your hair from frizzing up throughout the day. I use this on my braids before I add my hair extensions and this prevents my real hair from breaking while it is braided. The consistency is smooth and the scent is nice almost calming when you or others smell it and I really appreciate that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Motions Oil Moisturizer is also perfect to put on your hair whenever you will be applying heat because this keeps your hair from being brittle and dry while keeping your hair soft and healthy.  I love that this moisturizing oil has so many different uses and is the perfect accessory for healthy hair.</li>
    <li> I used this product on my five year old daughter who has very curly, mixed hair.  I tried to use this on her hair after it was freshly washed and conditioned.  Since the Motions Naturally You Moisturizing Cleanser and Deep Conditioning Masque did not leave her hair feeling moisturized I thought this product might help using it as a leave in.  It was very thin and sticky. I section her hair to comb it, I only used this for one section because I could not comb through her hair.  I was not a fan of the smell either.</li>
    <li> I am a long haired guy and while I figured this to be a gal&#x27;s product, I thought I&#x27;d try it.  Scent wasn&#x27;t bad, but otherwise obviously useless for us long haired bearded guys.</li>
    <li> These Motions products are, I think, developed for people with a very different hair type than mine. Even so, this is just a mess of a product. Oily, sticky, gross. Not for me.</li>
    <li> This product has a nice, pleasant scent. It&#x27;s a great value because you only need to use a small amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, it resulted in more of a greasy look rather than the shine I was looking for. I have long, wavy hair, and it might work better for someone who has different type of hair.</li>
    <li> I mistakenly ordered this thinking it was more of a conditioner product -- \\&quot;Moisturizer Hair Lotion\\&quot; seemed pretty obvious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this product is really a sort of styling oil. I found this out the hard way in the shower. Happily, a simple rinse and towel dry later, my hair looked basically normal. I think this might be useful to replenish a more or less natural level of &#x27;oiliness&#x27; after washing / conditioning, which, for me at least, leaves my hair sort of dry and frizzy for the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, I don&#x27;t really enjoy having artificially oily hair, so I wouldn&#x27;t buy this. I&#x27;m only reviewing it because I got it as a sample.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product.  It made my hair more manageable, sleeker and noticably shinier.  i just used a tiny amount, as directed, along with the other products I had been using.  I was afraid it would be too much, making my hair stringy.  I am pleasantly surprised at the results.</li>
    <li> I tried this hair lotion out but it was just awful. It made my hair feel awful and greasy. i wouldnt recommend buying this hair lotion.</li>
    <li> This Motions at Home moisturizer worked alright in its efforts to moisturize my hair. I wasn&#x27;t blown away by it, but I definitely noticed a difference. There&#x27;s definitely a few cons that prevented me from enjoying this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is a bit of a pain to apply. A small amount doesn&#x27;t get all the way into your hair, but a large amount in a pain to style. It smells nice, which is a plus but I&#x27;m not sure that should matter all that much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair did feel a bit better. I&#x27;ve been using a lot of deep conditioners at the same time, so I&#x27;m not sure how much I&#x27;d attribute that to the product itself. This product is good, but its certainly not great.</li>
    <li> Mixed impressions&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this for my bride, who has somewhat thin hair.  She was looking for a product that would add to the quality of her hair and add a bit of shine or sparkle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She found its fragrance was satisfactory and creamy. After using it six times, she is not impressed.  The result seemed to make hair seemed a a bit oily and did not really add body and/or shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. John Hogan CHA CHE&lt;br /&gt;HospitalityEducators&lt;br /&gt;Hogan Hospitality</li>
    <li> My wife has long, dark, medium body hair. This was too heavy for her hair leaning towards the greasy side.</li>
    <li> The Motions At Home Oil Moisturizer Hair Lotion works pretty good, but a little heavy for my taste. I would say this is for extremely dry hair. My hair is not that dry so it leaves it somewhat oily. This hair lotion does leave your hair soft and managable, but a little bit too oily for me.</li>
    <li> Motions Hair Lotion is a product made for those with hair issues related to tangling, lack of shine, and overall manageability. A small amount added to hair, we are told, should help relieve some of these problems and make hair look shinier and healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Putting this product to the test shows that most of what it claims is true and the most noticeable difference is the shine. Hair does look more radiant when this product is used and it takes only a small amount to achieve this goal. You don&#x27;t necessarily need to coat all of your hair- just a small amount combed through the bottom section of the hair is enough to make it look shiny and healthy. The ladies in my house agree that the product is worth buying for this reason alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another helpful quality is the ability to break up tangles. By adding some moisture and smoothness, tangles are broken up quickly. In this area, Motions is about as good as any, but I agree that there are other de-tangling products that work as well for less cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair management is easy when your locks are short and thin, but it can be a real challenge for those with thick/coarse hair that needs greater attention. Motions may not have a great scent, but it does make it easier to gain control of your hair and make it look healthy and vibrant.</li>
    <li> This hair lotion does to the hair what a good moisturizer does to you skin. Protect hair from the harshness of the daily grin with Motions at home oil moisturizer!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m astounded by the amount of bad reviews. I love this product so much. It doesn&#x27;t smell horrible. Just not the typical fruity, flowery fragrance most are used to. Your hair will obviously be a little more on the oily side. It&#x27;s a Damn OIL moisturing hair lotion.. I have pretty long, thin hair. It works great with my curls. I&#x27;ve done a fair share of damage to my hair with bleaching, dying and straightening, but it manages to revive the curl pattern well. And after I&#x27;ve styled and dried, my curls are soft and bouncy. I&#x27;ve been using this for months in replaced of a $15 hair lotion and I plan to continue using this until I find something else my hair loves. 💖</li>
    <li> In hindsight this is probably not the right kind of product for my short straight hair.  But what the hey, I tried it anyway thinking maybe it would cutdown on cowlicks.  I did apply this oil in the shower.  My hair did lay flatter but just a bit too greasy for my tastes so I will not add this to my regular hair products staple.  But too each his own - 3 stars for me.</li>
    <li> I tried it on clean dry hair as a styling aid.  I tried it on damp hair, just after shampooing.  I tried it on wet hair.  I tried using it as a conditioner, after shampooing and before rinsing.  No matter what I did, my hair felt heavy -- not moisturized, just heavy, and not very clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate to toss it, but I can&#x27;t figure out another way to try this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three stars, because the problem might be my hair type rather than the product.</li>
    <li> Provided to a great friend for a long period of time , along with several other Motions at Home products , she was ecstatic with the results.&lt;br /&gt;Always \\&quot;into her hair\\&quot; , my friend indicated that she will use this line for years to come , as she was so happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;A dear friend for many a year , I was ecstatic myself.</li>
    <li> I have used several products in this Motions line. This hair lotion like most of the others a little goes a long way. I also think it might not be the best thing for fine/thin hair it will weight you down abit. I enjoy it occasionally as I have long thick often rudely hair. I would give it a try especially if you use pink oil moisturizer its the same thing.</li>
    <li> gave this to the daughter to use.  she styles her hair and told me that it was good with the styling but she said that her hair felt a tad bit oily even after blow drying her hair.  she says that if you use this product a very little goes a long way.  she said her hair felt fuller after use.  she would recommend this product for people that have dry hair or if you blow dry your hair alot.</li>
    <li> I ordered several projects from the Motions hair line. Prior to the last order, I ordered their curl butter and another product and was totally dissatisfied. With that being said, the reviews on these other Motions products I ordered will probably be the same. I was totally disappointed that an entire line of hair products missed the mark. I can honestly say that I will not be buying these products anytime in the future. Not only did they do what they said they&#x27;d do, after the 1st hour or so, but the residue and build up in my hair, caused me to have to cut sections of my hair to get the residue and knots out of my hair. Out of the 9 products I tried there were only two that did anything for me and that was moisturizing cleanser and the deep conditioning hair masque. These were the only two products that did not tangle my hair and left it feeling soft and somewhat moisturized. I can actually run a comb or brush through it without pulling out plugs. I only wished that Motions&#x27; other products worked as successfully as these two did.</li>
    <li> I have thick wavy curly hair.  This does help some in the frizz department without leaving a greasy residue.  It is not stellar, but for the price, it is worth a try as everyone&#x27;s hair is different.  If you need only a bit of help, this could work great.</li>
    <li> My hair is drier than before after using this product. It is awful. When you first put it on in the morning it makes your hair feel moisturized but after a few hours you hair will feel like a brillo pad. By the end of the day you hair is drier than it was to begin with. Horrible. This is an awful moisturizer. It is way too thick. I would not recommend this to anyone unless you want your hair to be dry. Anyone who says this is a good product is lying. I will never buy this or anything else from Motions again.</li>
    <li> As a disclaimer, I have brown sandy, disheveled, spiky-in-places, thin wavy hair.  This product wasn&#x27;t made just for me.  It turns my hair into the windswept look without my consent.  This is made for a different type of hair.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love Motions At Home Oil Moisturizing Hair Lotion.  I have naturally frizzy hair (lucky me) and this product smooths my hair like no other product I&#x27;ve ever tried.  It lasts all day and delivers a shiny, healthy look as promised.  So what is there to hate?  My hair is very thin and too much product makes it look greasy and unwashed.  And, again, it lasts all day, so, unless I rewash my hair, I&#x27;m screwed.  Duh....stop using too much product you say!  I always use a small dab but sometimes the dab is just a little too much...very hard to gauge...for me, the smallest amount makes the difference between awesome and greasy.</li>
    <li> I am not a huge fan of leave-in moisturizer, and Motions At Home Oil Moisturizer Hair Lotion is a prime example of why. First the good, with Motions At Home Oil Moisturizer Hair Lotion. It is a decent sized bottle, so for me, with regular use, this bottle could last a long time. The only bad thing is after a few uses, I am not sure I will ever use this product again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, Motions At Home Oil Moisturizer Hair Lotion seems great. Makes my hair soft, shiny, and all that I want. The problem is after a few hours, my hair would get really greasy feeling. And even after washing my hair, the feeling stays. All in all, it took about two washing just to get my hair back to feeling like normal. Bottom line, great at first, but definitely a down side.</li>
    <li> Other reviewers have also noted that this product is most likely intended for African-Americans.  European-Americans would not benefit so much from this oily product unless they had thick, curly hair.  I do like the scent, but what this product does is more coat the hair rather than get absorbed in the follicles.  For those with permed or otherwise damaged hair a small dab on the ends after a washing also seems to do the trick, adding oil to the hair ends to keep it from flying around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like the scent, which is why I give it four stars.</li>
    <li> This product offers good quality and really works as intended.  Motions products are generally quite good.  This one is no exception.  Give this one a try.</li>
    <li> You have a body lotion, a face lotion, a hand creme, a foot creme, but no hair lotion!?! Why not? Why limit yourself to after-the-shampoo leave-in or style products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One reason would be that the ingredient list here consists of mineral oils, which generally trap moisture and do a lot more damage than they are worth. Another is all the other chemicals in this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil moisturizing is a good idea but doesn&#x27;t really provide the moisture necessary for your hair to thrive, so that you feel your hair become even drier after use.</li>
    <li> PROS: This works well for managing hair and giving it a bit of moisture and shine. It works similar to other products of this type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: Motions needs to find a more appealing fragrance. There are other lotions that smell like vanilla, coconut, and peaches. They&#x27;re going to beat this stinky stuff every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.5 - 4 STARS: Since there are so many hair lotions on the market, I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;d recommend this one over any of the others.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve tried several motions products and most are total grease bombs.  This one worked ok on my daughter&#x27;s waist long hair but she hardly used any of it.  She didn&#x27;t mind the smell. There&#x27;s probably a perfect balance between how much will give you the shine and moisture you desire but too much will be a mess.  I don&#x27;t recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I really can&#x27;t review how well this product worked since I was only able to use it on my son one time.  The following day, his entire head, neck, ears, and forehead broke out.  I&#x27;ve had this same problem with other Motions at Home products, so there is something in them he&#x27;s allergic to.</li>
