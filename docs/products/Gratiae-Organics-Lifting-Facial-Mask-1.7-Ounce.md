      <li>Its ok will use as a cleanser</li>
      <li>the stuff isn&#x27;t the \\&quot;magic</li>
      <li>So I did try it more than once</li>
      <li>I also have no way of knowing if this product is authentic.</li>
      <li>However, I am pleased with the mask.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>Here the price is reasonable for what you pay anywhere for a good cosmetic line.</li>
      <li>Not bad, and does make the skin feel better.</li>
      <li>I did not buy it but purchase three other products all beautifully packaged and was told it was better than botox ,</li>
      <li>can&#x27;t say enough great things about these items.</li>
      <li>Made from Israel from dead sea products, this is the best line I have ever tried.</li>
      <li>I asked Amazon why the mask is being sold so cheaply and if it came from China.  </li>
      <li>Was in Vegas and received a free sample, was fabulous.  </li>
      <li>A great product line, but I have tried other mask in this line that were better.  </li>
      <li>Many thanks!</li>
      <li>I am very pleased with the results so far.</li>
      <li>I was shopping with family and did not have time to have a full product demonstration but did accept the sample and came home to check reviews before I purchased it.</li>
      <li>I am following my Gratiae regime, and love, love, love something for the first time in years.</li>
      <li>for Amazon couldnt be happier with the quick delivery of the product.</li>
      <li>I received a sample of a Gratiae facial product while in Las Vegas and that is all it took for me to what more!</li>
      <li>(almost 56) year old skin feels tighter and very smooth.</li>
      <li>Used the mask in the morning before work and my skin feels and looks great,  feels fresh and tight.  </li>
      <li>So while I didn&#x27;t buy the salesman razzle-dazzle, I thought it was worth a try.</li>
      <li>So worth the money!saw results in a matter of a day</li>
      <li>ITS WORTH IT.</li>
      <li>, it is a rip off, but bought at on-line retail is is worth the cost.  </li>
      <li>Just the other day my son told me he hopes his skin will look as great as mine when he is 55 years old.</li>
      <li>it started working from the first treatment.  </li>
      <li>I also love how the mask smells and how you only have to leave it on for 5 minutes.</li>
      <li>It makes your skin so soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>love them... ordered them for friends and family several times.</li>
      <li>This is my first review in amazon.</li>
      <li>My skin is dewy, seems to be reflecting light, and the problem area around my eyes that sags and catches powder when applying make-up has plumped up considerably.</li>
      <li>My wrinkles have softened so much even my daughter asked if i had a facelift!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve taken very good care of skin my whole life, following the recommended regimens of regular exfoliation, masks, serums, moisturizers and UV protection on a regular basis.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products over the years in all price ranges, and while my skin looks great for my age (late fifties), the results could only take me so far and didn&#x27;t really address the sagging.</li>
      <li>Most face masks dry on the face after being applied.</li>
      <li>Really, when did I have time for that?  </li>
      <li>I will stick with Olay or Burt&#x27;s Bees, thanks.</li>
      <li>I was offered a free sample of the moisturizer and eye cream via a demonstration by a salon employee standing outside the store in LaHaina.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t list how much it weighs.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how you&#x27;d expect it to really work.  </li>
      <li>but I really see no additional benefit if used with companion moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I use this product every month and can really tell the difference.</li>
      <li>It was shipped fast .</li>
      <li>BUT I did get a free sample of the lifting facial mask, in a sealed package.</li>
      <li>If you an buy his product for a reasonable amount of money on amazon then why not try it.</li>
      <li>REALLY WAS SURPISED</li>
      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>There are good ingredients in the product, so I won&#x27;t bash it that bad and my face does feel nice after I use, but it really doesn&#x27;t do anything</li>
      <li>much cheaper.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Once dried you would wash off with warm water.</li>
      <li>One of their salesman tried to sell this and other items for much more.  </li>
      <li>Would recommend for women 50 and older.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought the mask but unfortunately there are no instructions on how to use the stuff. How disappointing. What a waste of money :-(</li>
    <li> No good, this product was all dried up when received even though the expiration date is 9/2015.  Its so dry it feels like dry putty in the hand and never was able to use this product. This item was returned!</li>
    <li> Nice mask product, but I really see no additional benefit if used with companion moisturizer. I won&#x27;t waste my time and money on another mask product.</li>
    <li> Love this mask!  This is a lightweight mask, not the thick mud type. I like to put it on and leave it for about 15 minutes.  It leaves my skin feeling soft, refreshed,  and not dry or flaky anymore. It&#x27;s a little jar, but goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Plese stay away from all kiosks, mall stores and particularly down town las vegas if you must purchase these prodcuts.  Do not listen to slick salesmen or women praying on your desire for natural products. Contact the bbb in the area that you purchased these products so we can put an end to this consumer rip off racket.  There is nothing special about this stuff - read the ingrediants!!!</li>
    <li> I received a sample of a Gratiae facial product while in Las Vegas and that is all it took for me to what more! Actually I ordered the Gratiae Organics Lifting Facial Mask by mistake as I really wanted a facial cream to wear at night or a day cream to wear under makeup. However, I am pleased with the mask. My 55 (almost 56) year old skin feels tighter and very smooth. I have tried other skin tightening or anti-wrinkle creams and felt as if I was applying a strong chemical smelling acid to my skin. I dreaded the nightly torture routine. I look forward to applying Gratiae to my skin. It feels and smells wonderful. Just the other day my son told me he hopes his skin will look as great as mine when he is 55 years old.</li>
    <li> THIS LINE WORKS. I SEE A BIG DIGFERENCE IN MY SKIN. I HAVE TO USE IT 3 TIMES A WEEK. ITS WORTH IT.</li>
    <li> Someone gave me a sample and I really liked it.  I ordered a jar.  I use it on my dry lips and skin spots caused by a rare health condition and it worked instantly.  It is the ONLY product to work to date, with a lifetime of trying lip balms Rx&#x27;s  and more to no avail.</li>
    <li> Love this product....I could see the difference it makes in a short time.  I have recommended to friends and family members.</li>
    <li> A great product line, but I have tried other mask in this line that were better.  Not bad, and does make the skin feel better.</li>
    <li> Stay away from this product. It is a total rip off.  Price aside (depending on where you buy it between $300 something or around $20.  That in itself is a joke) I can&#x27;t even apply this product since it does not at all spread.  All you get is areas of unspreadable white stuff in your face.  I hope that Amazon does not continue to sell this product.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I am 45 and I look 30 😃 I will never use anything else.</li>
    <li> I use this product every month and can really tell the difference. I buy it because I really do look younger using this product along with other Gratiae products.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin smooth and less wrinkled!&lt;br /&gt;I don´t like, that it is not possible to purchase directly to DK.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t get firm, and since it never gets firm I don&#x27;t know how you&#x27;d expect it to really work.  I used to sell skin care in the 70&#x27;s when I didn&#x27;t need it, but we had a lift that was amazing.  This doesn&#x27;t come close.  The seller did everything 100%</li>
    <li> I am 69 years old and the products are simply wonderful. I agree the mall prices are a scam - but them look at all the others out there in the same price range: COR (which is ROC, advertised on TV, check their site). Same pricing as Gratiae. However, the pricing aside, I am thrilled to be able to purchase these on the internet for the pricing available, and they are much better than many I have tried. Most \\&quot;float\\&quot; on top of my skin and become sticky, or dirty looking. I am following my Gratiae regime, and love, love, love something for the first time in years. I highly recommend it - but stay away from the malls.   This mask didn&#x27;t miraculously make me look 20 years younger, but after use I am finding the left side of my face is doing better (had sag from stroke). So while I didn&#x27;t buy the salesman razzle-dazzle, I thought it was worth a try. Not at $499, or $250, but enormously satisfying for the on-line pricing. </li>
    <li> I too was taken in by the kiosk in Vegas...and was SO happy to find this product on Amazon for tons cheaper.  The serums and moisturizers have been great, with visible results.  This mask however does nothing.  Still looking for a good one.  Tell your friends to boycot the kiosk!</li>
    <li> I have the eye cream and serum, so thought I would try the mask.  I do not care for the dry, clumpy texture.  It does rub in, but so far has not made a difference in my skin.  I will stick with Olay or Burt&#x27;s Bees, thanks.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this mask! The mask has a different consistency when put on which is unlike a traditional mask (see picture). It feels like there is a lot of moisture in the mask which is why the consistency is so different. I also love how the mask smells and how you only have to leave it on for 5 minutes. It is like getting a spa treatment at home, plus your skin looks and feels amazing afterwards. It makes your skin so soft and smooth. This is an excellent buy and this is one of my all time favorite facial masks!</li>
    <li> This skin product does work, but only for around two to three days.  It states that on the package.  If you use it before an outing or going to work, just for 15 to 20 minutes, then wash  off with warm facecloth.  Boy,  it works!!  It lifts up your face and under your chin/neck area.</li>
    <li> The product does not spread evenly. It is clumpy. It takes a lot of rubbing to get it all over my face and neck.</li>
    <li> Product was clearly tampered with and opened.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve taken very good care of skin my whole life, following the recommended regimens of regular exfoliation, masks, serums, moisturizers and UV protection on a regular basis.  I&#x27;ve tried many products over the years in all price ranges, and while my skin looks great for my age (late fifties), the results could only take me so far and didn&#x27;t really address the sagging. I recently stumbled across this product, and with a little skepticism, decided to try the whole line  as the cost is certainly comparable or even less than beauty products you&#x27;d get at Costco, and is certainly a considerable savings from the prices at the kiosks and on the website.. Imagine my surprise when I could actually see a difference almost from the start. My skin is dewy, seems to be reflecting light, and the problem area around my eyes that sags and catches powder when applying make-up has plumped up considerably. And my nasolabial folds- those marionette lines from nose to mouth- are actually progressively diminishing. Can this even be?? I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s this particular mask or the other products in the line that I&#x27;ve switched to all  at once (the serums and creams and AHA cleansing foam), but so far, I couldn&#x27;t be happier. As for those who say this product is \\&quot;old\\&quot; because it&#x27;s clumpy and doesn&#x27;t blend well, I think that&#x27;s an assumption on their part because to me,  it just seems to be the nature of the mask. I keep rubbing it in gently in a circular motion all over my face and neck and it eventually breaks down with the heat of skin and fingers and absorbs completely. Also, it should be used as recommended. For the reviewer who said that there is nothing written on the bottle, the ingredients are listed on the box it comes in.</li>
    <li> Perfect. Many thanks!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t often write reviews however when I see companies like this try to take advantage of women I get really mad.  We are constantly being sold a bill of goods or no goods.  I purchase some of GratiAE products in an upscale mall.  This same mask he tried to sell to me for $299.00 and told me it sold online for $499.  I did not buy it but purchase three other products all beautifully packaged and was told it was better than botox , a face lift in a jar etc.  when I got home what I purchase was just a bunch of inexpensive creams worth $1.99 from the drug store, but again they were beautifully packaged.  I read the ingredients, tested the creams and again I was taken for a ride.  There are no axtioxidants  or peptides in any of their products to justify the prices, further after testing the products in my labs, there is not a single ingredient that lends any real benefit as a face cream or wrinkle reducer other than $1.99 face creams you can purchase at a local drug store. what you are paying for is simply packaging and their marketing and branding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As women we are constantly viewed as financial failures because we don&#x27;t save and don&#x27;t spend wisely, yet we are bombarded with companies like GratiAE which pop-up everyday, make a fortune from us and then go out of business.  most are started by men who just plain take advantage of us as consumers.</li>
    <li> Used the mask in the morning before work and my skin feels and looks great,  feels fresh and tight.  Would recommend for women 50 and older.</li>
    <li> I read all the comments. I have to agree that one feels like the entire thing is a scam with the salespeople pretending to be something they really aren&#x27;t and he constant fluctuations in prices depending on the deal you make. HOWEVER, I believe they have some really good products. I do not have a dr degree nor do I have a lab that can test these products. I can only speak to my experience. I am happy to read there is nothin harmful in the ingredients ... That it includes only everyday ingredients. I have introduced the hydrating cream, peeling gel and sea salt scrub (which I use for my hands and feet in winter) to aestheticians, friends and family and they were all highly impressed (these are people who unlike me choose to spend a fortune on facial products). If you an buy his product for a reasonable amount of money on amazon then why not try it. I believe you will be pleasantly surprised. I DO NOT WORK FOR, represent, nor am I invested in this company. This is my first review in amazon. I only wrote my opinion because negative reviews seemed a little extreme.</li>
    <li> When I was in Las Vegas on Freemont Street.  One of their salesman tried to sell this and other items for much more.  I was still curious, so I did a Google search and was surprised to find it on Amazon much cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had some deep lines in my forehead.  it is plumping up and flattening them.  it started working from the first treatment.  I use it two times a week 3 or 4 days apart.  It is taking weeks, but I noticed improvement after every treatment.  I am very pleased with the results so far.</li>
    <li> I have used this product many times before and loved it. The batch I received was awful! Could barely apply it to my face since the consistency was not as it usually is. Waste of my money!</li>
    <li> WASTE OF MONEY, DOES NOTHING.</li>
    <li> Its ok will use as a cleanser</li>
    <li> They try to sell you this stuff in Vegas for hundreds of dollars, depending on how good you are at negotiating with them......Con Artists!  You get the same thing on Amazon for about $20 which I guess it&#x27;s why I&#x27;m not as upset the stuff isn&#x27;t the \\&quot;magic face lift\\&quot; they claim it to be. There are good ingredients in the product, so I won&#x27;t bash it that bad and my face does feel nice after I use, but it really doesn&#x27;t do anything any other product doesn&#x27;t.  Just don&#x27;t get scammed by the cute Vegas guys!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get duped into buying any of this BUT I did get a free sample of the lifting facial mask, in a sealed package. Thinking it is sealed okay I&#x27;ll try it. Did today and part of my face after appilcation looks burned. A big 50cent size right under the cheek bone along with another smaller size on the right. I did get it from a downtown las vegas vendor but i know the rotuine and didn&#x27;t stop long enough except for him to put in my hand. At least I&#x27;m on vacation so it will heal (i hope) before I go back to work. Dont use or stop at the vendor next to the gift shop. This shop would be across from the new D casino.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample from one of those Las Vegas Casio kiosk ,tried it and loved it....found it on Amazon.com bought it and i still  love it, I&#x27;m on my second jar and told my husband that my skin feels like a babies bottom after I just used the fresh jar.....I smeared it on his face to see if he gets the same results, in spite of his whiskers....would definitely recommend it at the Amazon price, forget the Las Vegas kiosk pricing, it is a rip off, but bought at on-line retail is is worth the cost.  Love IT!!!</li>
    <li> my favorite eye cream. I have been using it for. years. It works well for me.</li>
    <li> The overall feel after use is nice, but the product itself is really difficult to put on evenly.  The texture is something like putty and smears on like cottage cheese, ugh.</li>
    <li> This stuff is so old it separates all over my face and doesn&#x27;t tighten at all. Total waste of money!</li>
    <li> Most face masks dry on the face after being applied. Once dried you would wash off with warm water. This never dried. It was like applying Noxema or Ponds and then washing off. But I gave it the benefit of the doubt that this was the only mask that doesn&#x27;t dry . I wanted to be fair before I wrote the review.  So I did try it more than once, I see no benefit to this product at all. I also have no way of knowing if this product is authentic. I threw the product away.</li>
    <li> I like this product, and it does work.  I localize the cream where I want it, let it sit for at least 5 minutes, and wipe it off.  Less invasive and cheaper than filler.  As good as filler....maybe not, but I do notice a big difference.</li>
    <li> If i could give this 0, i would.  The material in the container was like crayon.  you could not spread it on your face.  i attempted to return it but due to a death in the family, i was not able to return it by the deadline.  The product smells old and not sure what it is.  Even if you could put it on your face, i would not.  Buyer, be ware.</li>
    <li> This product came in too dry.. not able to apply well.......and after applying with water I did not see any results!</li>
    <li> All i can say is this is the best lifting mask i ever used!! I would totally buy again when i run out! So worth the money!saw results in a matter of a day just the after math made my face smoother and more glowing! Love this product!</li>
    <li> My wrinkles have softened so much even my daughter asked if i had a facelift!  Really, when did I have time for that?  Not!</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t say enough great things about these items. love them... ordered them for friends and family several times. thanks</li>
    <li> I love the way my face feels after using this product.  I use the eye serum also. It&#x27;s better then anything I have tried and I&#x27;ve gotten plenty of compliments saying I still look young and I just turned 60 two weeks ago.  I plan to keep using this line.</li>
    <li> REALLY WAS SURPISED AT HOW WELL THIS PRODUCT WORKS.  NEVER USED ANYTHING LIKE IT BEFORE.  DECIDED IT WAS ABOUT TIME AT AGE 78.  IT DOES A GREAT JOB.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this product from a business or vendor, buy it here or at least check it out here first.  I was first introduced to this product line a few weeks ago while vacationing in Maui.  I was offered a free sample of the moisturizer and eye cream via a demonstration by a salon employee standing outside the store in LaHaina.  I was shopping with family and did not have time to have a full product demonstration but did accept the sample and came home to check reviews before I purchased it. It appears that purchases on site on charged several hundred dollars per item. Here the price is reasonable for what you pay anywhere for a good cosmetic line. I have purchased the facial mask, facial serum, eye serum and eye cream.  The order was easy to place and as expected with Amazon delivered within a few days.  So far, I really like the product and can tell a difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> The bottle has nothing written on it, which is strange.  It doesn&#x27;t list how much it weighs.  It is absolutely void of any writing.&lt;br /&gt;The mask is somewhat dried out and makes blobs on the face just the way the masks I have that are dried out do.  I asked Amazon why the mask is being sold so cheaply and if it came from China.  No one would answer. I knew it was a fake.  Why was it $12.50 when the product from the company is $599.00, which is exorbitant.  Shame on Gratiae, but shame on Amazon.</li>
    <li> this product is great product for your money.it makes your face feel good.I recommend it to anyone.It was shipped fast .</li>
    <li> This product and the rest of the Gratiae Organic line is Fanatic!!! I highly recommend I used it and followed up with their Facial Serum! and the vendor shipped immediately.  I am most happy with the delivery and the product.</li>
    <li> This is the best mask I have ever used. It lifts, tightens, smooths, plumps and hydrates. My face looks 20 years younger the day after I use this. Made from Israel from dead sea products, this is the best line I have ever tried. And the most expensive, but Amazon cuts that price by about 85%.&lt;br /&gt;You would pay over $400.00 for this in the retail store. I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s not worth it. This one jar will last you about 9 months. Use it twice a week. Love your skin!</li>
    <li> The product works okay, but again there are other products that I have used which work just as well, if not better, that cost much less.</li>
    <li> Had it demonstrated on me at a Premier store, but I could swallow the cost for the product.  Finding it through Amazon, and having it come in fresh, perfect condition, made me super happy.  Love the product and will order again from here.</li>
    <li> It was received wet and leaking out</li>
    <li> Was in Vegas and received a free sample, was fabulous.  Bought the Gratiae cream through amazon and it does not feel the same, it also is a bit lumpy not blending into the skin properly.  Will give it another try, maybe a bad batch fingers crossed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for Amazon couldnt be happier with the quick delivery of the product.</li>
    <li> Wonderful to skin, great for a present</li>
