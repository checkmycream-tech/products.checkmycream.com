      <li>I highly recommend this product because it is a great detangler for the knots in the hair and makes the hair so smooth and manageable.</li>
      <li>I use it for myself, as my hair is really fine and breaks easily.  </li>
      <li>I bought this because \\&quot;BabyZen\\&quot; detangling conditioner is no longer available through Amazon shipping and I was trying to save money.</li>
      <li>This smells nice and neutral/fresh, detangles nicely using a regular hairbrush leaving no greasy residue.</li>
      <li>This is such an amazing product!</li>
      <li>Worth the price!</li>
      <li>and so does my young son, so honestly I was looking for something we could both use on our hair for light conditioning that wasn&#x27;t full of a bunch of chemicals or garbage.</li>
      <li>Lightweight, nice smell, all natural.</li>
      <li>She has a full head of curls.</li>
      <li>I really liked this product made my hair soft and not oil or grease</li>
      <li>My 17-month-old has super curly hair.</li>
      <li>I love this product I originally bought this for my five year old son and</li>
      <li>Your product works great and leave&#x27;s Lily&#x27;s hair under control but not weighed down.</li>
      <li>My daughters hair is soft, shiny, not greasy, and I can comb it without tears :)</li>
      <li>It is a nice size bottle and will last a while.</li>
      <li>I also love how it is all natural.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t even leave a build up and dries pretty quickly.</li>
      <li>(My hair is naturally wavy, so it&#x27;s also great for days when i let it naturally air dry and wear it wavy, the spray helps to activate more of my waves.  </li>
      <li>This leave in does not leave a residue and makes her hair curl right up and have no frizz.</li>
      <li>I found that everything that was formulated for adults had way too much scent added ~ even the natural products tend to be a bit overwhelming</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m white with fine hair, but tons of it!</li>
      <li>like most leave in conditioner they leave a built up on hair after using it daily</li>
      <li>We don&#x27;t always agree on products that are more &amp;#34;twiggy&amp;#34; as we say (i.e. without all of the traditional chemicals).  </li>
      <li>I will definitely get more products from this seller&#x27;s line of products.</li>
      <li>Our daughter has long, fine hair which tends to only want to go in it&#x27;s own direction.</li>
      <li>Most of the time when she wakes up she has a large &#x27;rats nest&#x27; on the back of her head.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a heavy product on my hair, so my hair still feels clean even the day after I&#x27;ve used it.  </li>
      <li>(My doctor wants me off as many chemicals as possible.)</li>
      <li>It has a nice faint smell of rose.  </li>
      <li>Both my husband and I love this stuff for our daughter&#x27;s long hair.  </li>
      <li>Tames the static and dry flyaway hair.</li>
      <li>She really enjoys having it sprayed onto her curls.</li>
      <li>and I looked for a product that was gentle, and eco-friendly.</li>
      <li>really wanted to like this product</li>
      <li>I have very fine/fragile hair</li>
      <li>I also feel this promoted more tangles (because of the stiffness) and made brushing harder.</li>
      <li>It was the ONLY leave-in conditioner I could find that was toxin free and created with concern and intelligence.  </li>
      <li>It is very lightweight and gets</li>
      <li>It works very well for my daughters hair.  </li>
      <li>It smells so much better than all the other products out there</li>
      <li>She has very long hair, for an infant, soft curly hair on top</li>
      <li>I think it was worth the price paid as it is so much easier to get her hair to go the same direction while untangling and conditioning.</li>
      <li>IT has a light scent that is neither pleasant or unpleasant and does the detangling well.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have been using it now for over a year and highly recommend it for children and adults alike.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend them for adults as well as children.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I purchased the leave in conditioner to try and tackle my 1 year old daughter&#x27;s wild hair. It is very lightweight and gets very crazy and plain water doesn&#x27;t help to calm it down. I wanted a product that didn&#x27;t have a lot of chemicals. Your product works great and leave&#x27;s Lily&#x27;s hair under control but not weighed down. We think it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> I bought this because \\&quot;BabyZen\\&quot; detangling conditioner is no longer available through Amazon shipping and I was trying to save money. I saw the ingredients and reviews and figured this would be a perfect alternative.. it wasn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to use a lot of the product to get it to work, and rather than leave her hair soft, it felt a bit stiff when finally dry. I also feel this promoted more tangles (because of the stiffness) and made brushing harder. I compared it to the little bit of zen detangler I had (mixed with water to create a leave in) and my original option is just so SO much better (and with BabyZen a dime sized drop goes a long way for my daughter&#x27;s very long curly hair). Also hair with zen would dry soft and new tangles are easy to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted to like this product but it just didn&#x27;t even halfway meet my expectations. I had to use the bottle up because I did not want to just throw money in the trash but glad its done and I ordered two bottled of BabyZen detangler today. Also I wanted to try the conditioner in this totlogic line, but from one of the reviews there they had the same issue.. you need a lot to get it to work and that is just not worth it to me.</li>
    <li> I love this product I originally bought this for my five year old son and the results were so amazing that I plan on using it for myself.This  conditioner left his hair very soft and manageable.I highly recommend this product it works great you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I am love with this spray in conditioner!  It has a nice faint smell of rose.  It works very well for my daughters hair.  She has very fine  hair that tangles easily.  Most of the time when she wakes up she has a large &#x27;rats nest&#x27; on the back of her head.  I spray a few spritzes of the condtioner in her hair and the knots come out very easily.  I also like that there aren&#x27;t a bunch of chemicals in the product.  I will definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> I really liked this product made my hair soft and not oil or grease like most leave in conditioner they leave a built up on hair after using it daily I wear my hair natural (kinky curly) this is a product I can use daily w/out all the build up my hair tends to get dry and this product my my hair feel moist &amp;soft w/out feeling like it dripping wet (no soul gold for those who know what those old school curls use to look like) I will buy again</li>
    <li> Our daughter has long, fine hair which tends to only want to go in it&#x27;s own direction. This is the only detangler that smells great, is free of harmful chemicals and works magic on her hair! It&#x27;s a tad more money then I wanted to spend on a small bottle but it should last awhile as a little bit went a long way this morning. I think it was worth the price paid as it is so much easier to get her hair to go the same direction while untangling and conditioning.</li>
    <li> This smells nice and neutral/fresh, detangles nicely using a regular hairbrush leaving no greasy residue. Great stuff for grownups too!</li>
    <li> This is such an amazing product! My hair is instantly brushable, softer and healthier looking. I use it after each hair wash, before I dry my hair - and between washes to refresh, if necessary.  I went from having hair that was dry and damaged to feeling like I have baby-soft and supple hair. (My hair is naturally wavy, so it&#x27;s also great for days when i let it naturally air dry and wear it wavy, the spray helps to activate more of my waves.  It also helps protect my hair when I flat iron it after blow drying.)  I also use it on my kids&#x27; hair whenever they need their curls refreshed.  My daughter&#x27;s bi-racial mixed curly hair is instantly easier to brush and shiny.  The spray is also good for a quick spruce up for my boys&#x27; curly hair.  I have been using it now for over a year and highly recommend it for children and adults alike.</li>
    <li> i bought 2 natural detanglers and this one exceeded my expectations by far. it&#x27;s a bit pricey but when you&#x27;re brushing 3 girls&#x27; heads of hear every day, i want to hear less screaming.  smells great. and does the job!</li>
    <li> My daughter wakes up with frizzy hair in the back and I was looking for something that did not have chemicals.  I have been very happy with my purchase.  It is a nice size bottle and will last a while.</li>
    <li> Love this product! I always have to use a conditioner in order to get a brush through my hair and I was looking for something that I could use that would cut down on shower time, and it works. Love TotLogic</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had any good or bad experiences with this product but I do like the fats that it moisturizes my hair when I want to comb my hair in the morning. I think it&#x27;s a good enough product but not amazing either.</li>
    <li> I used this conditioner and leave-in spray conditioner on my 11 month old, as she was born with a TON of hair, and even at this young age, was waking up with painful snarls. I needed a conditioner I could trust and I looked for a product that was gentle, and eco-friendly. This product appeared, and after using it for the past few weeks (we use the spray-in every morning when I pull her hair back for daycare), I have to tell how much I love it! It&#x27;s perfect! My daughters hair is soft, shiny, not greasy, and I can comb it without tears :) It truly is a wonderful product, so thank you so much for the hard work in creating it. I recommend it to everyone I talk to :)</li>
    <li> Have only used this for a day or two...but can&#x27;t believe the difference. My youngest would have a what looked like a squirrels nest in her hair! Even with brushing her everyday, Jason detangling shampoo &amp; conditioner(combing her out while conditioner in her hair) &amp; Tru kid detangling spray...not to mention Fairytales anti lice spray. I almost can&#x27;t believe the results. Plus no toxic chemicals, which is a must. Will be ordering more of their products for sure.</li>
    <li> I use this on my hair.  A comb glides through the hair, even though wet.  It&#x27;s not a heavy product on my hair, so my hair still feels clean even the day after I&#x27;ve used it.  It has a nice light scent, which doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. I tend to get annoyed by heavy fragrances. I will definitely be getting it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on my daughter since she was about 6 months old. She has a full head of curls. This stuff works magic with both knots as well as keeping her curls looking their best! It&#x27;s a little pricey but it lasts quite awhile. Worth the price!</li>
    <li> I love this product! My little one has super curly hair that easily frizzes, esp in our southern humid climate! I wanted to put product in her hair to style it but worried about the harsh chemicals - until I discovered this! After a bath or before we leave the house I soak my LOs hair with the leave in conditioner, comb it and it dries perfectly and lasts. I feel at ease knowing the ingredients are natural. (Heck, I&#x27;ve even used it on my own hair!) Only con is that I go through the bottle in no time! Def recommend.</li>
    <li> love this stuff! I have a 19 month old with fine curly hair and it gets very round and tangled on the side she sleeps the most, this stuff is a life saver! She actually lets me comb her hair now,and then and flUffs up into beautiful , tangle free, shiny curls</li>
    <li> Not greasy even on oily hair! Beautiful product!</li>
    <li> This is a truly excellent product.  I use it for myself, as my hair is really fine and breaks easily.  I spray extra on the ends to prevent split ends, especially in the summer.  It makes my hair much easier to comb when wet with no fear of breakage.  I found that everything that was formulated for adults had way too much scent added ~ even the natural products tend to be a bit overwhelming (my boyfriend is a super-smeller I think, he can&#x27;t abide most products).  Thanks much for the excellent work!</li>
    <li> I am an Asian with thick black hair.&lt;br /&gt;I used it after towel drying my hair, but it had no effects on my hair.</li>
    <li> This is a great new product.  It smells so much better than all the other products out there and it doesn&#x27;t leave my daughters hair sticky.  I just bought several bottles so we don&#x27;t run out.</li>
    <li> This works OK for my baby&#x27;s little bit of hair.  I needed something that would help style it because it is just starting to curl a little bit on top, so sticks up.  It is effective for that purpose, but I don&#x27;t like the fragrance.  It is a soft scent, so I can tolerate it, but I won&#x27;t buy this again when I use it up.</li>
    <li> I used to use Johnson&#x27;s detangler and it was not wiorking for my daughter&#x27;s hair, it was hard to untagle and her hair always looked frizzy.  I researched and found this products and I absolutely love it.  No harmful chemicals and  It untangles her hair easily and her hair looks great. What a difference. Definitle will reorder!!!</li>
    <li> Having allergies and skin sensitivities as an adult, I find that TotLogic products suit me perfectly. I use them all the time. I highly recommend them for adults as well as children.</li>
    <li> Lightweight, nice smell, all natural. Use on my 2 year old daughters hair. Tames the static and dry flyaway hair.</li>
    <li> My son is interracial and I use it on his hair after ever bath and it helps deranged his hair. His hair texture is more like mine. I&#x27;m white with fine hair, but tons of it! It&#x27;s not corse like his daddy&#x27;s so I&#x27;m not sure how it works with thicker hair.</li>
    <li> We are really enjoying this product. I saw it mentioned in some magazine I read, so I found it on Amazon and purchased it. My 17-month-old has super curly hair. We spray this after washing it, and his hair stays tangle-free for days. It makes his hair soft, too, so it doesn&#x27;t get matted like it used to after sleeping all night and tossing and turning. I also love how it is all natural. I wouldn&#x27;t have tried it if it wasn&#x27;t, as I am trying to reduce the amount of chemicals we use in day-to-day living. Especially on my little one. I do have to keep the cap away from him, however, since it is so small, but that is with almost everything!</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t quite hold my daughter&#x27;s curl throughout the day like I would like but it is a good detangler.  I like that it does not make the hair greasy at all and has no harmful additives.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!!!!  my daughter is 8 months and is half jewish half black.  She has very long hair, for an infant, soft curly hair on top but the back was always getting frizzy.  This leave in does not leave a residue and makes her hair curl right up and have no frizz.</li>
    <li> This is very light on my daughter&#x27;s hair. It does not make my daughter&#x27;s hair oily or greasy. She really enjoys having it sprayed onto her curls.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I&#x27;m a grandmother and I ordered it for MYSELF. It was the ONLY leave-in conditioner I could find that was toxin free and created with concern and intelligence.  (My doctor wants me off as many chemicals as possible.) I&#x27;m going to order a supply for me AND all our grandchildren. Thank you for providing this product!</li>
    <li> It leaves your hair soft when you first spray it, but after it dries it does not leave your hair soft.</li>
    <li> This is a light weight conditioner that is perfect for my fine hair! It doesn&#x27;t even leave a build up and dries pretty quickly. I will definitely get more products from this seller&#x27;s line of products.</li>
    <li> FINALLY!!! The only detanglers on the market are so disgustingly scented!  This works so great, is natural, and smells so fresh and wonderful!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the product. (spray in/leave in conditioner) I have very fine/fragile hair and so does my young son, so honestly I was looking for something we could both use on our hair for light conditioning that wasn&#x27;t full of a bunch of chemicals or garbage. And this product is excellent!!! It has a light lovely fragrance, calms the frizz and fly aways while providing the perfect amount of conditioning for fine hair. I am looking forward to trying more TotLogic products!!</li>
    <li> Love it for our little girls hair</li>
    <li> My daughter wakes up with her curls frizzy and sticking all directions. I use this (instead of plain water) to defrizz and tame her hair. No residue and smells refreshing. Works great!</li>
    <li> The scent is soft, no greasy feeling, &amp; detangles. Love the fact that it is all natural!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy this product again!</li>
    <li> Both my husband and I love this stuff for our daughter&#x27;s long hair.  We don&#x27;t always agree on products that are more &amp;#34;twiggy&amp;#34; as we say (i.e. without all of the traditional chemicals).  But, because this stuff works well to get the tangles out, it gets a thumbs up from my husband.  And because it&#x27;s &amp;#34;twiggy&amp;#34; in addition to getting tangles out, it gets a thumbs up from me.  A win-win!  Wonderful stuff!  Can&#x27;t wait to try some of TotLogic&#x27;s other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also was impressed that the company (actually, the founder!) contacted me after my purchase to be sure I was happy with it.  Wow!  Another thumbs up for caring about their customers! :)</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product because it is a great detangler for the knots in the hair and makes the hair so smooth and manageable. It can be used every day and even makes the hair very soft.</li>
    <li> Between my curls and my son&#x27;s biracial hair, we&#x27;ve tried about a zillion detanglers and such.  This one is a + and I will be ordering again.  IT has a light scent that is neither pleasant or unpleasant and does the detangling well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend.</li>
