<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin.  Can&#x27;t use botanicals at all.  So happy to have this product available at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Provides perfect moisture and you only need a dab of it to completely cover my face and bald head.</li>
    <li> Keeps my skin soft and I never have any random dry spots.  It is perfect for everyday use and I am not kind to my skin, this product makes me feel like I am doing something good for it.</li>
    <li> Love love this lotion for my acne prone skin. I used to break out with every lotion until I found this. Life saver!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years (since 2002), and my face show&#x27;s it.  My face is always glowing and free from dead skin.  If you have dry skin or very dry skin you want to give this a try. This is the best price i&#x27;ve found too since Skinwest.com shut down.  A little goes a long way.  Pay attention to your skin type and what it&#x27;s rated for.  I.e. If you have oily skin, this one isn&#x27;t for you, but there are other BioElements products that will work for you.</li>
    <li> I started buying this from the Salon where I was getting facials, but is was in another state.  Then I found it on-line, but had to pay shipping.  Found it here on Amazon, shipping is free, and I can order whenever I need it.  Good stuff, I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else now, and I&#x27;ve used the best that&#x27;s out there.</li>
    <li> I use this at night and have been doing so for years.  The product is as excellent as they come.  I also use Bioelements SPF 50 Face Screen for a daily moisturizer with excellent protection from the sun.  The products are a bit pricey but not any more so than many others out on the market. If you are looking for a great product, try either or both.</li>
    <li> Great product and quick delivery!</li>
    <li> Buyers beware! I was skeptical when buying because of some of the reviews, but decided to go ahead with my purchase because of the high rating of the most recent reviews. My initial fears were soon realized once my package arrived. When I opened the box, the moisturizer was oozing out of the jar (between the jar and clear wrapping) and the plastic lid insert was stuck in the top of the jar. Additionally, being an exclusive user of this product for many years, I quickly noticed that the smell and texture was different. Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! The price was awesome!</li>
    <li> Light and airy on the face.  The soft feeling lasts all day. Also, very good for sensitive skin.  I highly recommend this product for those who have older, dry skin.</li>
    <li> Saves my face in the winter</li>
    <li> I have been using Bioelement products for about 10 years. It is by far the best for dry skin I have ever used. My daughter and I both use theses products. LOVE THEM!</li>
    <li> I love all of the Bioelements products. They have made a huge difference with my skin. I wouldn&#x27;t use any other product at this point.</li>
    <li> Seemed to be an old jar</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without this stuff.  I don&#x27;t wear makeup much, but like to have something to protect my face. Not oily.  A great product!</li>
    <li> Professional Skin Care and amazing results! Low odor, excellent moisture, not greasy. I hope they never discontinue this. I will use it for life.</li>
    <li> One of the best hydration moisturizers I have tried to date.  It is hydrating and moisturizing without feeling greasy. Make-up goes on smoothly and stays feeling hydrated throughout the day.</li>
    <li> My mom loves this.  It&#x27;s &amp;#34;heavier&amp;#34; than the Ultra-rich Cremetherapy.  Got this for her for  Mother&#x27;s Day.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s almost too much, now breaking out and it makes eye liner run.</li>
    <li> I have tried everything and this is what works for me; especially in the winter. Great moisturizer - great product!</li>
    <li> It was not the original one I received.</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer.  Does not feel greasy and it gives a nice smooth base prior to applying makeup. Great product.</li>
    <li> Using this product for years. Favorite spa in midtown no longer sells it. Thanks to Amazon.com, didn&#x27;t miss a beat.</li>
    <li> After trying the 50spf in this line, thought that I would like the extra moisture for nighttime.  Love the light feel and fragrance.</li>
    <li> it took me years to realize that my acne prone skin didn&#x27;t need more drying agents, it needed more moisture. this may not be the case for everyone, but it&#x27;s been a huge help to me.  i use glycolix 20% pads after i wash my face at night and then slather on this.  my skin has been great ever since.  even on new england winter nights with the dry air that comes from wood stoves, fire places and radiators, my skin is hydrated come morning.</li>
    <li> I have been using Bioelements for over a year. I love this moisturizer because it doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy greasy feeling on your face, yet absorbs and moisturizes your face upon application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is great stuff and with winter on us, it is a must for dry skin!</li>
    <li> Great product!  Goes on so smoothly and keeps my face soft.  You need such a small amount;so, the jar lasts for months!</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer! I keep it in my MUA kit and it works perfectly on clients with very dry skin! I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever switch brands again!</li>
    <li> I have tried many different moisturizers and I keep coming back to this one. It will moist the skin without making it feel oily.</li>
    <li> This is a light moisturizer that absorbs quickly and well.  It is great under foundation.  This is another excellent Bioelements products.</li>
    <li> I use twice a day and it&#x27;s just right for me ... Goes on nice under my bb cream too. I would recommend this product . I have dry skin and I&#x27;m 50</li>
    <li> If you have dry skin like I do that even flakes during the summer this is perfect. I had to apply moisturizer 2-3 times a day because my skin would get so dry and itchy but this stuff only requires one application! Very happy! Arrives sealed- brand new. Thick &amp; creamy- very pleased, will buy again!</li>
    <li> This is absolutely my favorite moisturizer of all-time (and I enjoy many other products in the Bioelements line!) I have perpetually dry skin; yet this not-too-heavy moisturizer makes my skin feel wonderful all day long. It&#x27;s never greasy feeling - I LOVE crucial moisture.</li>
    <li> One of the best moisturizers I have found especially when considering the price.  It is the only product that calms my skin and hydrates leaving it soft and free of inflammation.  I have been using this for almost two years and am a loyal Bioelements customer.</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and I am able to use this moisturizer  without having a reaction at all. It leaves my skin soft and has a nice clean scent.</li>
    <li> This did not work for me at ALL!!! The packaging is good, everything arrived in one piece so no problems there. When I first opening it to smell it and try it on my face I realized that it smelled like hair dye. It&#x27;s a very very strong smell my husband didn&#x27;t even want to face me while sleeping the first night. I tried it for about a month or so and I felt like it dried my face our more than usual. So I stopped using it I might need something else.</li>
    <li> I like other Bioelements products but this is not very moisturizing and has an unpleasant fragrance.  I do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> she also likes this product as well</li>
    <li> The best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used and I&#x27;ve tried many.  Especially great in the winter when the air is cold and dry.  Awesome.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin and this product is awesome.......just enough moisture.......doesn&#x27;t make face oily like some products do.  I had used the Absolute Moisturizer &amp; found it was just not enough moisture for my skin.  This one is perfect</li>
    <li> Loved it, as good as the more expensive &amp;#34;really rich&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> The wife likes it so that&#x27;s why I buy it.</li>
    <li> Great smooth product. Smells wonderful as well!</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me by Spa staff when I received my facial.  I love it.</li>
    <li> This is the only face cream I use. For the price, it&#x27;s worth it as the jar will last up to 6 -7 months. you only need to use it sparingly. I do like the light scent of fresh &amp;#34;balsam&amp;#34;... that s probebly not the scent but its a soothing spa fragrance.</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer. It&#x27;s not greasy, a little goes a long way. Best I&#x27;ve used in a long time.</li>
    <li> Thrilled to find I could purchase this on Amazon.  Great value compared to prices local salon charges.  Product works great for me - not too heavy feel, but gives my skin the moisture it needs.</li>
    <li> I found this product in the clearance section of a professional beauty store years ago. Since that time, I have had difficulty locating more. When I located it electronically, I was thrilled. This is great for older gals who still have it and want to retain it and I do suggest you try it.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty nice face cream, I had gotten a sample from my hair dresser, my skin is extremely dry, this is a great moisturizer if you have very dry skin. I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I had a small sample of a product with this same name on the label. The texture of what i had does not match the texture of the product inside this jar.  I don&#x27;t know if I bought the wrong thing or this is not the original product.  So I can&#x27;t say.  It&#x27;s OK, it a moisturizer, it seems to work alright, it&#x27;s just not the same texture of what I thought I would get.</li>
    <li> This cream works fine - I was looking for something gentle to apply after doing any sort of facials, which can make my normally not-sensitive skin sensitive. It smells great and as I hoped, didn&#x27;t irritate my skin but soothed it. I was looking for something neutral that was a moisturizer but no sunscreen, anti-aging, just moisturizer.  That&#x27;s what I got. No amazing results, just no irritation or break outs.</li>
    <li> Very Pleased with this purchase &amp; the quick delivery!</li>
    <li> I love bioelements!  I have used absoloute moisture cream for a few years...no problem...&lt;br /&gt;I purchased &#x27;crucial moisture&#x27;....it smelled wonderful!  I used twice,  I had an allergic reaction. Swelling and puffiness near my eyes, took days for the swelling to go away. My skin burned.  If you have sensitive skin stay with absolute moisture...can&#x27;t wait until my new jar arrives!</li>
    <li> I really like Bioelements Crucial Moisture.  This cream hydrates well and has a wonderful aroma.  It&#x27;s good for anyone with dry skin.</li>
    <li> Great product, been using it for years!</li>
    <li> Great for day use and very light.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years and am very happy with this product.  Arrives very quickly after I order.</li>
    <li> Actually my wife uses it.  She says it is not a heavy feeling moisture cream it feels light and absorbs into your skin.</li>
    <li> My skin has been dry all my life and have tried many moisturizers.. This is the best cream I have ever used! Great buy!</li>
    <li> This product is great.  I highly recommend it to anyone with dry skin and it&#x27;s very affordable.  Doesn&#x27;t leave my skin looking greasy or shiny.  Just a nice, moist-looking skin.</li>
    <li> Great product. No greasy feeling.</li>
    <li> Ever.  :)&lt;br /&gt;My skin is baby smooth and soft after every use.  I also put it on my neck every morning and night.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Deep moisturizing without greasiness.  Love the fragrance.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way with this stuff.  I dab a bit on my finger, and it&#x27;s good for my entire face.  This will hydrate just about any dry skin, and I was very pleased with the results.  My face is visibly smoother and has a nice, healthy glow.</li>
    <li> The Absolute moisture was much better.</li>
    <li> Great product that I&#x27;ve been using for years, with my busy schedule and remote location it is wonderful to have it delivered to my door with Amazon Prime.</li>
    <li> I like Bioelements serials. There is a good hydration effect without any unpleasant scent. It&#x27;s a must in my daily life.</li>
    <li> Product was what I expected. Excellent moisturizer for cold weather or very dry skin. Transaction was quick and arrived in the next several days.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Bioelements for years and highly recommend it for dry skin. Everybody thinks I&#x27;m 20 years younger than I am!</li>
    <li> I would recommend this to anyone that has dry or extremely dry skin.  My skin was so dry it was sometimes painful.  There were dry patches on my cheeks and my make up looked terrible and patchy.  It was embarrassing.  I am getting married in a few months and definitely did not want to look like a crocodile in my wedding pics so I decided to try crucial moisture as it was recommended by my esthetician.  I am so glad I did!  It completely changed my skin!  It totally rehydrated me without causing breakouts.  It is a little pricey but a little goes a long way which makes it worth it.</li>
    <li> The best for me, works wonderful!!</li>
    <li> This is a great moisture!  This was used when I got a facial and I loved it so I had to purchase some for myself.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for number of years and am very satisfied</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer for even the most dry skin. Its gentle and feels light weight. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer, as well as the other Bioelements products I use religiously (Sleepwear and Power Peptide toner). My skin has improved so much from using them for the past 18 months or so. I am sensitive to chemical fragrances, so I appreciate that they are unscented. They are light on the skin and absorb beautifully without any stickiness or oily feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the packaging defines any sense. These are products that are likely to be used in a bathroom, with hard tile or marble surfaces, flooring that is probably hard surface and water repellent. But these products are packaged in fragile and slippery glass bottles and jars, with hard plastic caps that shatter almost as easily as glass. I have had to throw away product because the container was slippery and got dropped on the sink or the floor. Most recently, my travel kit was knocked off the sink with a jar inside - resulting in a shattered jar and a travel kit full of product with granular glass throughout. Messy, wasteful and dangerous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I would rate the products themselves as excellent quality (especially at Amazon prices) I am seriously thinking of finding other products that are more safely and appropriately packaged, both for thrift and my own health. Too bad they don&#x27;t put as much thought and care into the packaging as they do the product.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this moisturizer and have seen noticeable improvement in the quality of my skin.  I can&#x27;t wait to try other Bioelements products.</li>
    <li> great item shipped quickly</li>
    <li> I have normal to dry skin and this moisturizer is perfect as a day cream for me. Doesn&#x27;t break me out like other moisturizers and keeps my skin hydrated without feeling heavy or greasy. But I prefer something heavier at night so I use another product in my night regimen.</li>
    <li> Bioelements products are Great.  The crucial moisture does not feel sticky or tacky and goes on smooth.  You don&#x27;t need to use very much to cover your face.</li>
    <li> Item was new in box, SEALED. Was exactly what I was looking for, excellent transaction.</li>
    <li> Do not use this moisturizer if you have sensitive skin. On numerous different occasions I tried using it and my skin broke out in an itchy and burning red rash. I do like the bioelements Calmitude daily moisturizer but am disappointed in this product. Was hoping for a good nighttime moisturizer but this is not it.</li>
    <li> Very rich and lovely feeling. Also, smells very good (smells like Aveda products).</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me and love it.  I could never find a moisturizer that wouldn&#x27;t automatically absorb in my face.  I feel hydrated well after applying.</li>
    <li> Love this!!! Great price, smells like the stuff they use at a professional facial, and really works!  I have normal/dry skin and live in Seattle where the dry air in the winter can really dry out your skin.  But this has been great, and I love the price so I don&#x27;t feel guilty using lots of it : )</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used bioelements for a while. I am familiar with the packaging and the seal. The seal on this was different than normal. I was just replacing a previous one that had run out also purchased on amazon. The seal was different than any of the numerous ones I&#x27;ve used. As well the texture and smell was different. Oddly I started developing weird dry patches and itchiness. I didn&#x27;t put this together until I ran out the other day and I was substituting with my other products. The dryness is going away. I just received another jar from a different vendor that was the normal seal. I contacted amazon at the time about what I noticed and they assured me it had to be right. But well...moral of the story if you are familiar with the product trust your instinct and ask for a replacement.</li>
    <li> Great stuff.  Smells so clean.  A lady who did facial used this.  It really feels good on skin.</li>
    <li> Very creamy, not greasy but provides plenty of moisture.  I am using this for daytime and nighttime both.  Very satisfied and would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t tell yet if the product will help, moisture-wise, though it&#x27;s soft stuff.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the scent.  I can tell they&#x27;re going for the spa effect.  I want it NOT scented, though some may love the smell.  I have sensitive skin and eyes, and they tend not to like scents :).&lt;br /&gt;Not as creamy as I&#x27;d hoped for, and I have to get my foundation on pretty quickly after applying.  Not sure I&#x27;d reorder, though I MIGHT if it were half the price.  &amp;#34;Crucial Moisture&amp;#34;?  Not so sure.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this moisturizer.  She has oily, acne-prone skin, and this is the only stuff she will use - keeps her skin looking great without needing other skincare treatments and products, which makes it worth the cost.  Only complaint she has is that there&#x27;s not SPF in it.</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift for my wife &amp; she loves it!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for 6 years. I always buy it from the spa but I saw that amazon sold it for much less. When it arrived, I noticed the plastic seal on it was different but didn&#x27;t think much of it. I smelled the cream and it smelled the same. After a few day of use my skin seemed drier than normal. I had a very small amount left in the jar I had bought from the spa, when I did a side by side comparison I noticed the scent wasn&#x27;t exactly the same and the consistency was different as well.</li>
    <li> Best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used. Fast - absorbing and non-greasy.  Worth the $$!</li>
    <li> I really like this moisturizer. It goes on smooth and feels great. No real scent to it, not heavy, absorbs quickly. My everyday moisturizer! : )</li>
    <li> Love this product.  I pair it up with the &amp;#34;Moisture  x 10&amp;#34; and my skin is soft and hydrated for the day.  Will continue to make this part of my daily routine.</li>
    <li> Bioelements is one of few products I can use on my face without getting breakouts.  This moisturizer is really pretty good for everyday where considering I live in Colorado and the air gets pretty dry here.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years but my salon does not carry it any more.  Your price is great.</li>
    <li> Crucial Moisture is my go-to moisturizer.</li>
    <li> We absolutely love using this moisture.  We have used it for years.  Thank you so much for a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> Best for dry skin. A little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> The whole Bioelements line is wonderful.  This moisturizer is light but very effective.  Also, there is no discernible scent which is a plus.  Well worth the money!</li>
    <li> Excellent creme! Only need a little,  absorbs into the skin and leaves moisturizing benefits all day! Just Love It!</li>
