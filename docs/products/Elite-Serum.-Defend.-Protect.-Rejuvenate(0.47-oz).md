### Positive Reviews

      <li>, people now tell me about how relaxed and great I look!</li>
      <li>Since I turned 30 I&#x27;ve been on a mission: to find the perfect eye cream.  </li>
      <li>I been searching for the best eye cream/serum for the longest time</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s too wonderful to not share it.</li>
      <li>but to my surprise,I&#x27;m extremely impressed with the immediate results</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I never ever give reviews for anything, but this cream worked so well for me that i decided to take the time to actually write a review about it.  Basically, after i got my lasik i had really bad dark circles under my eyes that made me feel like a grandma. I started to wear this before going to bed (despite the instructions saying wear twice a day) and within 3-4 days i noticed the dark was clearing up, i can actually walk around without makeup now. I tried other products as i said in a reply to one of the reviews here, and after seeing the results (although not drastic at first) it made a difference.  Now it&#x27;s been 1 month since i ordered, and i still have the tube, because i don&#x27;t use it daily, i use it every other day when i remember because i&#x27;m so bad at remember lol, but anyway, give it a try, it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Celia</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 27 years old and I didn&#x27;t really have wrinkles under my eyes, but i got this product to prevent them. And in stead of this i got wrinkles in 2 months. Not worth money!!!</li>
    <li> I was hoping this would work. I was willing to pay nearly 90.00 to help my crows feet and fine lines around my eyes. I am 41 and the last couple of years have really taken its toll on my face. I used this product 2x day and even took before and after pics. I saw no change. I liked the way it felt when applied but honestly didnt seem like it really absorbed. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews and the manufacturer&#x27;s information for this product, I decided to place an order.&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what the manufacturer says: &amp;#34;Considered to be the #1 Eye Serum on the Market - For Reducing Dark Circles, Puffiness...&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product, as directed, for approximately one month and I&#x27;ve seen NO change in puffiness or any reduction of dark circles.  The dispenser dispenses way too much product which seems very wasteful and once the product has dried, it becomes flakey so concealer doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly.  Although I&#x27;m quite disappointed, to say the least, I will continue to use this product (at night only) because it was costly.  I wish it worked, but unfortunately, it just hasn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;Not a Happy Customer</li>
    <li> I purchased the elite serum from the Australian website, after reading so many positive reviews about it.  I thought it had to be genuine, because so many people cannot be lying about this product.  Anyhow, I have just finished the syringe and am extremely disappointed to report that it has made absolutely no difference to the fine lines around my eyes, the dark circles under my eyes or crows feet.  What is most upsetting for me is, that I chose to purchase the elite serum as my \\&quot;mothers day gift\\&quot;. I spent $100 on something that did not work, when I could have spent the same money on a pampering session or something from which I would benefit.&lt;br /&gt;I find it very hard to believe that this product has worked wonders for so many people but did absolutely nothing for me.  The only conclusion I can draw is that these \\&quot;reviews\\&quot; have been made up or people have been paid to write them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think there should be money back guarantee attached to this product.  I do not recommend this product to anybody.</li>
    <li> This product did absolutely nothing for me. I wasn&#x27;t prepared to pay the high cost for another, nor the ridiculously high postage, to give the product more time to work. I thought eight weeks was enough. I&#x27;m still looking for something that works.</li>
    <li> I purchased this after seeing Dr. Oz recommend using argireline on your eyes.  I used the entire contents of the container, applied twice a day since the beginning of February, and didn&#x27;t see any change in the crows feet and wrinkles around my eyes (I&#x27;m 41 and have had crows feet starting for a couple of years).  Disappointing because I was hoping it would make at least a small difference - especially for the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never considered myself a vain guy, but then I got older and suddenly found myself single. \\&quot;Re-entering\\&quot; the dating market caused me to do a serious evaluation of my looks. Well, I didn&#x27;t like what I saw. Deep lines at the corner of my eyes and my mouth too. Well, what can you do? On a whim, I decided to try this product. I didn&#x27;t expect it to work, but I that point I was willing to try anything. I applied it like the directions said. After a couple of days, it seemed to be working, and after a week I was sure it was. All the lines are so diminished they&#x27;re practically gone. Now, I&#x27;m not going to claim this product helped me get girls, but what it did do was boost my confidence, and that helped me to approach women and get dates. Mark me down as a happy customer</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really know about this product !!! I&#x27;m still using but didn&#x27;t see something major to be honest  but , it seems working for  the puffiness THAtS IT ...</li>
    <li> Normally I don&#x27;t write reviews but I thought that a good product should get its dues. Though I am not too old, my skin around the eyes is quite dry and wrinkled. I think it might be due to my hectic lifestyle and visiting different places across the world within short notice. Sleeping at regular hours sometimes takes a beating and I find myself in different time zones all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is quite delicate and hence frequent travelling has taken a toll on it. Tried a few skin products but the result was not so good. Thought that I would try some product on Amazon since I can also read reviews about the product before buying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decided to give Elite Serum a try. Used it according to instruction on the bottle. Was pleasantly surprised to see the wrinkles and the lines gradually vanishing. It acts as a preventive agent as well since it does not allow the new formation of lines and wrinkles. At least, I can say now that I look my age instead of looking 10 years older with those wrinkles around my eyes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a few weeks. I&#x27;ve noticed that my under eye wrinkles have become less defined. My under eyes look smoother.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing much of anything for me.  It hasn&#x27;t made my dark circles and puffiness worse but it hasn&#x27;t made them any better as well and I&#x27;ve been using it a.m. and p.m. for a month.</li>
    <li> Serum&#x27;s are a hard one. And this was a tough case - a very rough faced man. I do have to say we did see results. It costs a bit for this stuff but if you&#x27;re willing to pay and keep it up, it does actually work better than anything else tried for that price point on the market.</li>
    <li> Not much difference, I expected better...my skin still with no changes. If didn&#x27;t do much for the bags under my eyes which the main reason why I spent so much.</li>
    <li> The combination of claiming darkness reduction with Haloxyl and antioxidants and wrinkle depth with Argireline and Snap 8 with a slew of other peptides roped me in.  Bought Elite Serum having to know if this was just marketing hype or the real medical treatment sought after for so many years.  On my second airless syringe, month 3, I noticed the substancial difference I was hoping to find.  Photos of skin under my eyes show a true variance in the quality of my skin, with the latter showing more plump, glowing skin without abrasians, darkness, or deep crow&#x27;s feet wrinkles.  The corner&#x27;s of my eyes have a much lesser crevace (crow&#x27;s foot) to the naked eye.  The results satisfied me, and as a former slave to injectables, this is a much more simple approach to looking better without invasion.</li>
    <li> thanks great product and value....I buy this is every month and it has removed bags under my eyes can&#x27;t live without this product and am excited to start using the new extra strength..if its better than the original serum I will never have to get botox again...thanks</li>
    <li> My wife decided to try this one (the older formula) because it was a lot less expensive than the new Elite Serum RX Extra Strength, which she previously bought and loved. She reported that this one works well, but is not quite as good as the Elite Serum RX Extra Strength.  Then she factored in the cost of the RT Extra Strength, which is more than two times more for the same amount of product (less than $40 vs. approx. $90) and decided that for the price, this is a pretty good serum.  She uses it on top of Shiseido Bio performance Super Corrective Serum, and the combination works well. The packaging is small but easy to deliver the correct amount without wasting product. My wife says that one push of the plunger provides her with the exact amount of product needed for both eyes.  It lasts a fair amount of time (about 3 months) for her. Again, if you are willing to pay, I would get the Elite Serum RX Extra Strength.</li>
    <li> When used daily this product really does reduce the dark circles on the upper part of my eyes.  It does nothing for the under-eye puffiness however.</li>
    <li> I think this works well.  I also tried it on the lines beside my mouth.  I think it works a bit on them also.</li>
    <li> I like the way this feels when you apply it.  I&#x27;ve only had it a short while, so I&#x27;m really unable to provide a thorough yes or no just yet.  But, so far, so good!</li>
    <li> I bought this because of the reviews &amp; I was desperate buying eye creams to help with my puffy eye issues. I was hesitant, but willing to try anything. I hated waking up looking like I&#x27;d been punched in both eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum is light, greaseless, and glides right on. I put a small amount on my fingers &amp; slide it around my whole eye before bed &amp; in the morning after shower and washing my face. It helps tremendously.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read and heard various reviews on this product being incredible. It&#x27;s done nothing spectacular for me at the moment. Actually, I haven&#x27;t really seen it do anything. I feel some of the reviews are made up or people are paid for them cause I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month now and it really hasn&#x27;t done any miracles, it hasn&#x27;t changed my skin in the least bit.</li>
    <li> I tried this for my eyes and love it,  I am 69 and my eyes were in need of surgery for the drouping eyelids and tried many other products.  I have been using elite serum twice a day and can see the difference.  At this point I don&#x27;t need to have surgery to correct them.  Love it and highly recommend.  A little goes a long ways.</li>
    <li> Like the syringe, no problems, have used for about four days and can already feel firming around my eye area.  Visible signs not&lt;br /&gt;apparent at this short time</li>
    <li> I am amazed at how well this works. The first time I used it, I noticed that my under eye bag deep lines were not as deep. The longer I use it, those lines are lessening as well as the puffiness. I&#x27;ve tried so many other products that claim to work and never do much of anything. I am so glad to discover this! Will not use anything else!!</li>
    <li> I was very excited to get to try this Elite Serum Rx Extra Strength by Skin Pro.  I had been using the regular strength elite serum Rx and was enjoying the benefits when I was offered the Extra Strength version. It arrived in a very nice box, which I think would be ideal for gift giving.  I like that it is also in the syringe dispenser, it works well for me and allows me to use very little at a time, so none goes to waste.  I love the consistency of this serum. It looks like it will be an oil but it is not at all oily and actually absorbs like a cream.  I use this serum all around my eye area and can see visible results in the difference of my skin texture, brightness, color and overall condition.  I am very pleased with the results and I will continue to use it daily. I recommend it!&lt;br /&gt; I received this product in exchange for a review. All my opinions are my own, based on my personal experience with the product. I am disclosing this in accordance with the Federal Trade Commission’s 16 CFR, Part 255: Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising.</li>
    <li> I am constantly having bad bags under my eyes, lack of sleep and other problems. I&#x27;m usually not for getting certain products for my skin or health conditions, I usually don&#x27;t even take medicine when I&#x27;m sick. But every once and a while you want to try something that you think just might work. I decided to try it especially since it wasn&#x27;t too expensive and I could really see a difference after a couple months. I would recommend to anyone looking to try and improve their skin.</li>
    <li> It is AMAZING!  I love it!!!!!!  I wouldnt use any other product now and i&#x27;ve used many many over the years</li>
    <li> I really liked this serum. I found it worth it&#x27;s price.</li>
    <li> This is a wrinkle serum, not a dark eye circle serum. I have a very thin periorbital skin, and the dark circles and creased skin are things I had since Birth (am 33). I am a vegetarian but my blood profile is healthy so no anemia or inflammation, just genetics. This serum didn&#x27;t do anything to my dark circles, however, age related wrinkles did get reduced and I have started applying it to forehead and deep smile lines. It has reduced any slight wrinkles that were creeping on my forehead, and the darkness of my smile lines reduced. I have purchased 3 syringes and have used half a one so far for 4 weeks and plan to continue using it. Once before bedtime, and in the morning before work. If I wash it by accident after 2 hours I reapply it. Again skin to skin variation is the issue I think, and how much products did you actually put your skin through also affects response to this serum.</li>
    <li> I have decided to sit down and write a review on this product on the sole basis it deserves it. Having recently celebrated ANOTHER birthday I was in the market for a product that would give my skin a little pick me up. One of my coworkers has the prettiest skin and I asked her what she uses. This is how me and Elite Serum met! Upon her complete excitement and \\&quot;swear by it testimonials\\&quot; I decided to give Elite Serum a whirl.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Elite Serum for a little over 7 weeks and I have had amazing results. In fact several people at work have asked what kind of make-up I use??&lt;br /&gt;I have come to the conclusion it is not my make-up it is how its applying better to my skin because I have fixed it on a foundational level. My lines are not as pronounced, I have had some brown spot reduction ( I think this is due to the peptides in the serum and my skin is much visibly brighter and softer as my fiance pointed out yesterday!&lt;br /&gt;I have tried all the beauty products and this serum at its price point takes the cake on results. It is refreshing to buy a beauty product as a woman and it ACTUALLY work. Good for you SkinPro I guess I should thank you on behalf of all my wonderful friend, family and co-worker compliments lately. My skin is brighter, fresher softer and ALIVE again. Please send my compliments to the chef!</li>
    <li> Wow has the price really dropped on this product. I paid $27.99 on a Groupon in May &#x27;13. At that point, they had the priced list for 109.95!  I don&#x27;t know if the company has changed the ingredients because at 17.99 that is a huge difference in price. At that price, I&#x27;d say the product I purchased is average. The container/dispenser is handy and useful, the serum feels cool on application, and the product is competitive for similar priced, low-end, eye care products. At first I liked it, but after additional uses I noticed small irritations around the corner of my eyes. (Not the serum that I have used to cause these.) I also I am unsure about its effectiveness at reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. Might work for some. Pretty much, standard run-of-the-mill eye care serum.</li>
    <li> i am in my 70&#x60;s and a licenced cosmetician in my day.... i have tried everything on the market to keep my facial skin looking its best.... this is the one product that i have loved since day one....you must use this serum... oh and i have serious allergies and have no problems with elite....</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin. I cannot wear most makeup brands. I started to get under eye bags and dark circles when I was 38. I am 46 and I was just about to give up and accept my raccoon puffy eyes. I saw this and I REALLY did not think it would work.  I have been using it for more than a month and the dark circles have lightened and the puffiness has also went down. Just a warning you have to get use to the dispenser. If you push to hard a lot will come out. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I bought this based on other reviews.  I have no problems with puffyness, I just have VERY dark circles under my eyes.  This product did nothing at all to help my dark (almost black) circles.</li>
    <li> The Elite Serum really does work. I have been using it for almost a year now and it has erased almost all of my crows feet. I get people thinking that my grandchildren are mine all the time, love it;)</li>
    <li> Bought this in December 2012 and am still using it after applying about 5 times a week and I don&#x27;t see myself running out anytime soon. Works good too, I&#x27;m a young guy but I have those dark areas under my eyes and I work a lot so I get the lines/bags too. Put this on in the morning and I feel like it just wakes up my eyes.</li>
    <li> My sister-in-law told me about Elite Serum. She has had dark circles under her eyes for years and this product helped her with a more rested appearance.  I don&#x27;t have the dark circles so much as puffiness around my eyes, which started last year when I turned 45.  I had tried several other items from the discount store but they didn&#x27;t seem to do much.  I even bought a high dollar product from one of those home parties. That was a waste of time and money. Elite Serum does the trick for me.  If you apply it 2X day - 1 tube will last about 5 to 6 weeks or so. Not a bad price for a product that works.  I almost forgot, my sister-in-law is Hispanic and I am white and it works fine for both our skin types.</li>
    <li> I bought this for the dark circles under my eyes. After using it twice daily for a week it seemed to help. However my eyes were very dry and itchy so I stopped using it for a few days. Then I tried to reuse twice daily again and got the same itchy eyes. Now I use it once a day at night and a cream in the morning. Oh well</li>
    <li> I have tried many different eye creams and serums and have never found one I have been happy or one that actually worked to help with fine lines and wrinkles. I especially like the fact that it dispenses the exact amount of serum needed automatically so there is no need for measuring or waste by dispensing too much. I read the reviews on this eye serum online before deciding to try it and also was impressed that it was recommended by Dr. Oz. If like myself you have been looking for a eye treatment that works, try this!</li>
    <li> Hi fellow amazonians. First of all I&#x27;ll say that I&#x27;ve tried products like this and serums in the past, and have been please with the ability for them to smooth out the wrinkles around my eyes. That being said, I couldn&#x27;t help but notice that this was on sale, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot. My expectations were low because the price was also low, and I was prepared to see my old wrinkles and maybe some puffiness swell up, but none of that happened. I had my usual brand at the ready just in case this wasn&#x27;t up to snuff, but I never needed to use it. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s me or the serum, but I feel like it&#x27;s not only maintaining the condition that my skin has been in, but is making it seem even better than it was before. I like my old stuff too, but as long as this is on sale I think I&#x27;m going to stock up.</li>
    <li> ive been using this for about 2 years, twice a day faithfully...i am 52 years old..shy of doing surgery this stuff keeps the dark circles away, minimizes lines, and tightens around the whole eye area...not sure how much longer it will help being 52...but i will keep using it until no results</li>
    <li> Great for dark circles</li>
    <li> I am sooooo pleased with this product!!  Like other reviewers, over the years I&#x27;ve spent literally hundreds and hundreds of dollars on eye creams and serums designed to diminish crows feet and help with under eye puffiness, (due to a kidney condition, I&#x27;m extremely prone to under eye puffiness and it&#x27;s a permanent condition.  Under my eyes look like I&#x27;m retaining more water than the Hoover Dam at times!).  They all claim to, if not cure your problem, to at least greatly diminish this malady many of us are afflicted with.  Yeah right!  But, I would fork over the money for that thimble full of the latest and greatest miracle cure because THIS one is GOING to work, right?!?!?! But, when said cure failed to deliver on its promised miracle, I&#x27;d go right back to my ol&#x27; standby Oil of Olay.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, overall, I love Oil of Olay products and the results they give, but I&#x27;ve had minimal success with their eye creams.  However, it&#x27;s better than using nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So....  what really chaps my arse about Elite Serum?? ..... Part of it is because this stuff actually works!  Previously, while feeling disappointed that yet AGAIN, I&#x27;ve bought into the hype and it didn&#x27;t work, I would also feel a sense of relief that I didn&#x27;t have to continue spending huge amounts of money on an ineffective product.  Ironic, I know, but it&#x27;s hard to justify the expense versus that  tiny little dollop of product you get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, you know down deep that these highly touted products really won&#x27;t work, but you&#x27;re always, \\&quot;what if\\&quot;....  You know you&#x27;ve got to at least try it.  I would, it didn&#x27;t, and I&#x27;d be right back to the inexpensive Oil of Olay and continue my search.  So, that&#x27;s the reason I&#x27;m not tap dancing on the top of someone&#x27;s head with joy that I no longer have highly visable bags, (no... strike that... not bags, I have luggage!!!), is that this serum isn&#x27;t cheap.  Naturally, I find something that finally works and it&#x27;s on the expensive side.  Whom did I p*ss off offin a previous life?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only has this serum been very effective against the roadmap creases around my eyes and the puffiness, I use this on the lines around my lips and forehead too, (products for the eyes can be beneficial for the entire face, but it doesn&#x27;t work the opposite way.  Products designed for the face should not be used on the delicate eye area).  Those ruts and lines, (especially around my upper lip) are all but gone.  I have to turn my head in the light in just the right way any more to see very, very faint lines,  Elite serum is not heavy or sticky, and it&#x27;s absorbed quickly into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The syringe IS beneficial, as it dispenses measured doses, (and a little goes a long way. I&#x27;m able to use one squirt to cover all the areas mentioned above), plus you don&#x27;t run the risk of contaminating your serum by touching it, as opposed to if it were stored in a jar.  It&#x27;s the bacteria on our fingers that can cause a breakdown in makeups and products we use, rendering them less than effective. That&#x27;s why some cosmetic companies include small spatulas with their cosmetics and creams, so you don&#x27;t destroy it&#x27;s beneficial properties or its effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really a sad state of affairs anymore when we are genuinely surprised that a product actually delivers and does exactly what it says it does.  And, in my opinon, this one does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yeah, I&#x27;ll bite the bullet and continue buying Elite Serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ jade ~</li>
    <li> The texture of this eye gel is light and glides well on the lids.  Last about two months for me.</li>
    <li> Certainly did not rejuvenate my under eye area. In fact it dried my skin. Thumbs down for me on this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this after googling best eye creams. This was one of 2 that came up. I have used quite a few eye creams &amp; have used it about 2 weeks &amp; I&#x27;m not impressed. My problem is fine lines not dark circles &amp; this product is very thin so I feel like its doing nothing. I prefer a thicker cream. I ended up getting a sample of First Aid Ultra Beauty Repair Cream in something else I ordered &amp; I fell in love so I ordered that &amp; we&#x27;ll see how it goes. It has lots of good reviews.</li>
    <li> So far I really like this serum for my eyes.  I have noticed a little change around my eyes.  Thanks</li>
    <li> No miracle serum.  Tried on just one side of my face--asked opinions--they chose the wrong side. Won&#x27;t be reordering again.</li>
    <li> I used this product and I really really like it!! and it was great I would defiantly refer it to a friend or family member with the same issue I have regarding the bags under my eyes.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product 2xday starting 10/31. Not much change here. If something magic happens in the near future I will let you know.</li>
    <li> It just didn&#x27;t work for me, my dark circles are still the same. I am very disappointed in this product</li>
    <li> This does absolutely nothing.  the reviews must have been placed by paid people becaus ethere is no way real customers posted them.  This product is like water in a seringe.  Do not waste your money.</li>
    <li> The packaging of this product is faulty. They say the syringe keeps the serum fresh and provides a metered dose. I used it for three days and the syringe stopped dispensing. I tried every which way to extract the serum from the dispenser without success. I applied to Amazon for a return. The seller (after months of no reply) reasoned that it was a health related product and couldn&#x27;t be returned. I would never recommend this product, or any thing made by this company, to any one.</li>
    <li> I like it but not sure if how much results i am getting .Feels light , but wrinkles? I dont think it is helping .</li>
    <li> It was a clean way to disperse the serum and lasted a long time. It is not greasy but effective and lasting.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t even begin to tell you how much money I&#x27;ve gone through looking for a product that TRULY lives up to its word, I probably would have a few months of rent saved up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I thought this would be another one of THOSE bs products blowing smoke up my...but to my surprise,I&#x27;m extremely impressed with the immediate results (I didn&#x27;t think would happen) from using this eye serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face feels like it&#x27;s been nipped, tucked, tighten without surgery. Being in my 50&#x27;s, I&#x27;ve been through my share of lotions &amp; potions however, this is a serum that actually works.  I like the way the lines around my mouth &amp; forehead smooth out and tightens &amp; firms my skin. By applying a thin layer around my eyes, forehead &amp; neck, I gotta tell ya, Its made a believer out of me in and is sincerely worthy of the price.</li>
    <li> Oh my god, this stuff is a miracle. I had VERY puffy bags since my mid 20′s. Along with that, i had dark rings under my eyes. Literally, 2 weeks into using it, the Dermagist eye gel wiped out the circles and bags. I am not kidding this is very serious treatment and I totally recommend.</li>
    <li> I live in Miami so I&#x27;m constantly in the sun. Unfortunately it&#x27;s caused me some wrinkles to come creeping out too early! I have had them around my eyes for some time now. I&#x27;ve used Clinique, Avon, Sephora, but NOTHING worked. Until I stumbled upon this miracle serum!!! Literally, within as little as a weak I noticed a big difference. I&#x27;m looking my age again and I&#x27;m so excited to see how much better I&#x27;ll look with a month of use!!! Buy this product. You will NOT regret it.</li>
    <li> I actually bought this product directly through the elite serum website to avoid any possible \\&quot;fakes.\\&quot; I was able to get a deal, buy one get one free. The only reason I give this 2 stars vs 1 is because one tube lasted me about three months, not the 45 days in which they state. I started my second tube about a month ago which makes 4 months total so far and I have not seen ANY noticeable changes. I use it religiously, and it is so frustrating to invest that amount of time and money in a product that does not work. This was my last attempt at purchasing anything for my dark circles because I have already tried many products with no results. At least on the bright side I won&#x27;t be wasting any more money on useless products.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get the hype, really did nothing for me. I&#x27;ll keep using till gone, but will not buy again. Still looking</li>
    <li> I am battling it out right now trying to get my money back. I used the serum for about 50 days with NO visible change whatsoever. Before I know it a second tube arrives and my checking account is deducted another $65.55. I can&#x27;t get anybody to assist me at the 800# so I write an email. I&#x27;m offered MORE serum and they want me to use it for 6 months! I sent both tubes back in August, 2013 and I still have no refund. I&#x27;m dealing with the Better Business Bureau in Florida to see if they can help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your $$$.</li>
    <li> I am really disappointed with this product.  When I used it I got a sty every time? No idea why!  But, it made no difference either.</li>
    <li> I never write reviews but decided to help save everyone there hard earned cash. Iv stopped using this product after 1\4 of the tube as it was making my eyes worse, I&#x27;m 30yrs old and have dark circles, this product actually stated to GIVE me wrinkles. Even my boss who is a beauty therapist and facial trained commented on how bad my eyes looked, waste of money!!!! I&#x27;d give it 0 stars if it would give me that option on here!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my second time purchasing the Elite Serum  I got the one last year then the price went up then went down $17+  this time I bought three of them because it&#x27;s really work I see difference the puffiness &amp; the darkness going away :) ♡ ♡ ♡</li>
    <li> It suck,...... Nothing happen on my skin...waste of money</li>
    <li> I first purchased this from a Groupon. I have now been using it for 2 years. I have used many eye products and this is by far my favorite. It took about a month before I began to see results but the results are definitely visible. I am 41 and have minimal crows feet because of this. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> It did moisturize my eyes while I wore it, but I didn&#x27;t notice any permanent effects - still lines, darkness, dry.</li>
    <li> I have used it now for about 2-3 weeks and really do not see a difference from the other eye creams I have used.  I will continue to use it hoping it just may take my skin a bit longer.</li>
    <li> I have not seen any change after applying this serum twice a day for one month.&lt;br /&gt; I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;m 18 (a little young to be looking for an eye serum, I know) but I&#x27;ve had severe dark circles from since I could remember. They&#x27;ve gotten worse over the years. There&#x27;s veins that show through because the skin is so thin. I don&#x27;t even have to pull at the skin for them to show through. It looks pretty terrible. Anyway I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now and there has definitely been a change. I can no longer see the veins and my dark circles have lightened up a lot. The product&#x27;s quite expensive though. Well actually I bought it on ebay for about $40 so it&#x27;s not too bad. Anyway I&#x27;m quite happy with the results and am hoping I&#x27;ll continue seeing results in the weeks to come!</li>
    <li> I am 44 years and needless to say that I need some skin care including the eye aria. This serum works, not wonders and need some time of use, but good enough for me.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent for a person who is looking for a product that gives you instance gratification.&lt;br /&gt;It is not a long term (wrinkle removing) result but it does make the appearance minamized.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t not reduce my dark circles . It felt like i was applying water to my eyes&lt;br /&gt;It was waste of money.I want a refund . &amp;#62;.&amp;#60;</li>
    <li> So I bought this product because I have started seeing an upper eye lid sag. I&#x27;m only 40 years old so I wanted to get a jump start on rejuvenating my eyes before its too late. I&#x27;ve been using this product religiously for about a month. I even took a \\&quot;before\\&quot; picture of my eyes to get a more concrete answer as to whether or not this product is working. So far there has been absolutely no change in my eye lid appearance. I&#x27;m going to finish the tube but based on the other reviews I thought I would have seen SOME progress by now. If I do see a change I&#x27;ll update this review with an obvious \\&quot;before and after\\&quot; picture. As for now, I&#x27;m loosing faith</li>
    <li> The product works great, but it was irritating the eye area and making it red, now I use it once a day and it is better.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It makes my lines disappear and the morning puffiness. Worth every penny. Even took to my cosmetic surgeons office just make sure that I was getting something they would not recommend. They whoo who, I picked axactly the same. Going by the ingredients and the price was was way cheaper than what they wanted to sell me. They told me to put that in my purse and not speak of it! :) run, don&#x27;t walk, get this product</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see any results after 30 days</li>
    <li> I PAID 94 USD $ FOR THIS CRAP. IT IS NOW 28$?!?!?!?!?!  This stuff is like water. It did nothing for me. When I asked for a refund, i was told I actually need to use it for months to see an affect. So I couldn&#x27;t get a refund. Horrible service.</li>
    <li> I  just worked okay for me even after weeks saw no real changes.</li>
    <li> Elite Eye Serum is an amazing product and worth every penny! I am in my early 50&#x27;s and have been contemplating Botox and other more drastic solutions to firm up my skin and make me look younger, especially around the eye area. I had recently commented on the appearance of a friend of mine and she told me she was using Elite Eye Serum, so I figured why not give it a try? WOW!!! I can tell it works because I&#x27;ve gotten comments from friends and family asking if I&#x27;ve \\&quot;had work done\\&quot;. My face is smoother and the nasty bags under my eyes have been reduced dramatically I refuse to age gracefully and thanks to Elite Eye Serum, I can have some help with slowing down the noticeable aging process. When I go out with my husband, people comment on how much younger I am than him (which is even funnier because he is a year younger than me). What&#x27;s great about Elite Eye Cream is, not only does it work, but the product allows you to dispense measured doses so that nothing is wasted. I travel alot with my job and it&#x27;s quite easy to take along and use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also started using it on other parts of my face, because of the wonderful results around my eyes. I used it around the creases of my mouth and already I noticed my fine lines are fading and my skin looks tighter and more rejuvenated. I feel more confident with my appearance and as I&#x27;ve mentioned, other people have noticed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I totally recommend this product. If you are like me, you spend so much time on different health and beauty \\&quot;remedies\\&quot; and it&#x27;s wonderful to see something that works. Not just for women either- my husband has started using it as well, so I ended up having to buy him his own supply. Great product, great results and I suggest you see what this product can do for you!!</li>
    <li> Did not see an improvement. I was expecting more considering the reviews. I have to admit, I was using other good anti-aging products before I tried the Elite Eye Serum, maybe it just wasn&#x27;t better than my previous products.&lt;br /&gt;What I didn&#x27;t like about this serum was that every time I used it, it felt like I had a thin gelly layer around my eye.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical about purchasing this online product at first. But knowing that I had already tried other eye creams before, I just went with it, considering the positive feedback I read. I ordered two, both for my mom and myself, we tried everything from Lancôme to Mary Kay etc... this product definitely lives up to its expectations. My skin is relatively sensitive, so I was scared at first, but the easy directions and the correct amounts that were dispensed were amazing. I live in South Florida, this sun kills, so it is convenient to have a great product like this in handy. I literally used this product for a week, and saw a great difference in just my dark circles. I recommend this product, it&#x27;s great, it&#x27;s fast, and it&#x27;s convenient!</li>
    <li> I have always had dark circles under my eyes.  I&#x27;ve tried product after product, but nothing worked.  This product works!  I no longer have dark circles and my skin is so much smoother.  I&#x27;m getting to the age where things start to look a little wrinkled and was starting to not like what I saw in the mirror.  However, since using this product I love how I look.  Even my friends have started commenting on how much younger my face looks-too bad we can&#x27;t use it on the rest of our body-grin!  I would recommend this product for anyone who is starting to have a few wrinkles or has those dratted dark circles under their eyes. Ladies you need to buy this product!</li>
    <li> I did not think this worked as well as Hylexin on my dark circles and have gone back to the Hyexin for Serious Dark circles.</li>
    <li> As a working mom of two, a business women, college student and firefighter I&#x27;ve noticed that in the last few years the wrinkles and the crows feet have really started to creep in. I&#x27;ve been up all night with term papers, working all day, and then changing my clothes to turn into super mom when the kids get home from school to start a completely different role. I was really starting to see my age(nope not gonna tell). You know, as a business woman you want to look your best. I think any woman wants to step outside and look her best, but I was starting to feel like I was turning into the mummy. So naturally I hit the market, I was trying everything I could find, paying hundreds of dollars to keep those pesky little reminders away. Surprise surprise none of them worked. A girlfriend recommended Elite Eye Serum and at the price I found on Amazon how could I say no. I noticed a difference almost immediately, and not only did I notice, my husband noticed too. I have to say, the puffiness under my eyes is gone, the dark circles from the up all nighters is gone. I feel 10 years younger! And according to my husband I look 10 years younger too. This is an absolutely amazing product. I recommend Elite Eye Serum to all my friends now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to try this product, I feel like a completely different woman!</li>
    <li> The syringe takes a little getting used to but I guess there is a purpose to it. I still use a little moisturizer on top of the serum. I had to find instructions for use on you tube and there was an instructive video there. The shipping sucked. You would think that for a $89.00 product they could at least put it in a box. It came in a small bubble wrap with masking tape over the top of the cap. Then again, no information to go with it. I really wasn&#x27;t sure I was getting the right product. But I like the serum and will order again. maybe not from this seller.</li>
    <li> It arrived and the pump does not work... Can&#x27;t get the stuff out of the container to try it, without breaking the syringe.</li>
    <li> Not quite sure if I see any changes yet... I intend to finish the product.  It arrived with a tear on the sticker sealing it, which made me curious if this product was tampered with. Then I noticed this product has a sticker which states &amp;#34;Discontinued By Manufacturer&amp;#34; ?? I just don&#x27;t recall that in the description of this product... But could explain the price.  I will finish product then update.</li>
    <li> I have NEVER written a product review before.  This is my first, so you know I must be really impressed with this product.  Up until about a year ago, most people upon meeting me for the first time thought I was in my mid to late 30&#x27;s.  I was feeling pretty good about the way I was holding up.  Then I turned 47 and and it all went down hill!  Suddenly people were guessing my age or even older.  I don&#x27;t know what happened, but the main difference I saw in myself was my eyes.  Suddenly, I had all of these fine lines, wrinkles and creases underneath my eyes.  I also was waking up each morning with a lot of bags and puffiness underneath my eyes.  I was doing internet research, looking for a product that would help.  I normally use ROC or Oil of Olay products and had always felt they did the job.  Suddenly though, they weren&#x27;t enough anymore.  I stumbled across Elite Serum through my internet search and saw that Dr. Oz recommended it.  I searched for product reviews on Amazon as I have felt in the past the reviews on Amazon seem to be the most honest, and not reviews that are all paid for by the company making the product.  The price for the Elite Serum was steep, but I thought I&#x27;d give it a try and if it didn&#x27;t work, I just wouldn&#x27;t order it again.  I read all the reviews from other users and most of the reviews were overwhelmingly positive.  Most of the reviewers did say that to be fair to the product you shouldn&#x27;t expect overnight results.  Many of the reviews said the product should be used for a month or so before judging the results of the product.  I have been using this product for 4 days, yes that&#x27;s 4 days, and the results are unbelievable.  This product has almost completely erased all the fine lines, wrinkles and creases underneath my eyes.  I followed the directions exactly and dab it underneath each eye every morning and night.  I also use it on my upper eyelids too.  Using it on my upper eyelids has seemed to tighten the skin so they appear less droopy.  Ilet the product completely dry and absorb for about 15 minutes.  They I do also apply over it Olay Total Effects eye cream.  I know not every product works for everyone, but this product has really worked for me.  I feel like it&#x27;s taken 10 years off of my eyes and I will absolutely continue to purchase this product.  I really wish I had thought to take before and after photos so I could post them as well.</li>
    <li> My wife just loves this. she would have bought some 15 of these in the past 30 months. Try this once and you wont regret it.</li>
    <li> I would have been better off going to walmart and buying oil of Olay products. This serum did not do anything that it claimed to do.</li>
    <li> I am a 44 year old female, and I take good care of my skin.  I get a facial every four weeks, and I use premium skin care products (I currently use the Image skin care line, including the Max cream, which is a bit pricey.  I have been using the Max cream in my eye area, instead of a dedicated eye cream, because my eye area is not my problem spot.  But I thought it might be time to try an eye cream, because I am starting to get fine lines and some sagginess.  I read about the cream on a blog, and the woman swore by it and posted some pretty impressive before-and-after pictures.  So I started on the serum about two weeks ago, applying twice a day as the directions state.  I was really suprised to see an improvement immediately after I applied it the first time.  My eyes looked bigger and brighter - they seemed more open somehow.  And after two weeks I am noticing a little more improvement - my fine lines are less noticable, less darkness under my eyes, and definitely less sagginess of the skin.  I am really impressed with this serum.  Usually skin care products don&#x27;t show immediate improvement in the skin, but this one actually does.  I&#x27;m sold.  I&#x27;m going to keep using this twice a day from now on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also - as most other people state, the packaging is great.  No wasted product, and it is kinda fun to use.  Highly recommended to anyone who would like to improve the eye area.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for an eye product on and off. I&#x27;d try one and it wouldn&#x27;t work well, so I&#x27;d give up, but eventually, I would try something else. I bought the Elite serum without a lot of high expectations, but I have been very pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;After about a month of using it, the crow&#x27;s feet have very obviously diminished. I don&#x27;t usually have dark circles, but I&#x27;ve noticed that the skin around my eyes looks younger and fresher all the way around.&lt;br /&gt;Like one of the other reviewers, I tried the serum on some wrinkles above my mouth and it works great there too. They&#x27;re not completely gone, but they are very diminished as well.&lt;br /&gt;The price is kind of high, but when you find something that actually works and the cost is semi-reasonable, the cost can be worth the benefits. I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00891FKD4 SkinPro Delfogo Reconstructive Eye Serum]]</li>
    <li> After a couple of weeks of use, I can see that the large dark circles under my eyes have significantly lightened.  I have tried other products without success, so I&#x27;m pleased with Elite Serum.</li>
    <li> Since I turned 30 I&#x27;ve been on a mission: to find the perfect eye cream.  Not too oily, not too flaky, not too pricy.  For years Perricone&#x27;s Advanced Eye Forumula was my HG, but out of the blue I developed an allergy.  Since then Sephora staff scatter at the sight of my shadow - I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ve requested samples of every eye cream on the roster.  Most chap, burn or otherwise dry out the sensitive skin around and under my eyes (Ole Hendrikson, Shisedo, Perricone Vitamin C Ester - you know who you are).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To its credit Elite Serum was not one of the offenders, but after 3 months of religious use morning and night I see zero improvement in wrinkles or dark circles.  It does absorb quickly and is only faintly sticky an hour after application, but frankly I get better cosmetic results using coconut oil on my eyes at bedtime and sticking to a clean diet (organic/no processed foods).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the applicator tubes the serum comes in are worthless.  I bought 2 and neither release the serum consistently; it&#x27;s impressive the technical issues these dispensers have considering they&#x27;re only made out of 3 or 4 plastic parts and a spring.  Won&#x27;t be buying this product again.</li>
    <li> I am in my late 50&#x27;s with pretty good skin and skin tone but have had some sagging and dark circles around my eyes. This serum after my first full week has made a noticable difference. I will continue to purchase. Love the delivery system for the serum. Dispenses just the right amount of product</li>
    <li> I used to think that getting a facial is only something that women do and that you had to go to a massage parlor or spa to get one. I was in my 50s when I discovered lots of wrinkles around my eyes and mouth, and dark circles under my eyes. Someone told me about Elite Serum and I found that it didn&#x27;t cost a lot of money, so I decided to try it. It made a real difference. Not only could I see the difference in the mirror after only a week, I had friends who told me that I \\&quot;must be something right\\&quot; because they said I looked younger. I&#x27;m a man and had never had a facial, and I still haven&#x27;t had one in a spa, but Elite Serum has changed my mind about age products for men. I&#x27;m a believer and I&#x27;d recommend it to any man who wants to look younger.</li>
    <li> I admit I was skeptical at first.  I don&#x27;t know who wouldn&#x27;t be.  But When I allowed the product to do its work people around me commented that I looked less tired.  I hadn&#x27;t really changed my sleep schedule, so I took a picture of myself, kept using the product and about a week later took another picture for comparison.  I definitely noticed the product had made a difference in my appearance.  Its not magic, but if I noticed it and others noticed it, I would definitely say I experienced success.</li>
    <li> I used this for about 2 months and did not see any difference at all. I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t buy the $80 elite eye serum.. I would LOVE to have my money back for this product. It was a waste of my time .</li>
    <li> So far this serum is proving to be very good.  It goes on in a thin liquid, but absorbs rapidly and leaves the skin around the eyes feeling very refreshed and looking bright.  It&#x27;s too soon to tell if it will erase years off my face but I will edit this summary as necessary.  For the money, I say go ahead and spring for it.  You can&#x27;t beat the price for a good eye serum.  It took some observation and thought before I could open it properly and as I struggled with it I was worried I might break it.  It&#x27;s actually a very sturdy little system and I like the fact that it dispenses the exact dose so there&#x27;s no waste and no air wafting over the product when it&#x27;s not being used.  Clever design.  Shipping was faster than promised and I am overall extremely pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> The texture is very good, not as sticky as other eye creams and it reduces obvious wrinkles. I LOVE IT</li>
    <li> Ok so I have researched so many eye wrinkle products looking for something for Asian eyes that will reduce the look of puffiness and under eye wrinkle.  This serum is unbelievable.  It works great and doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes.  I have only used it for a week but noticed my makeup stays on longer and my eyes look awake!</li>
    <li> I expected good things from all the reviews. This was very disappointing. It works alright but no better than less expensive products I have used. The search continues.</li>
    <li> I have used Elite Serum previously and have found it to be the best that I have used within my  pricing area. It really gets rid of bags.</li>
    <li> I am not a big fan of rejuvenation products, but I do recommend Elite Serum to anyone who is sick of people asking \\&quot;are you tired\\&quot;?  I work two jobs, have a kid, and all that jazz so I don&#x27;t have time for make up to hide bags under my eyes or the sleep that would prevent bags under my eyes.  I decided to buy something for my eyes after I went with a friend to get make overs and saw how dark the shadows under my eyes were even with professionally applied make up caked on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using the serum about a month ago and the dark shadows and lines under my eyes are gone.  I put the serum on at night after I wash my face.  I know you are supposed to use the serum twice each day, but I usually forget in the morning.  I probably would have noticed improvements sooner if I&#x27;d followed the instructions but it still worked so I am happy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a several months now and I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference. In fact somebody at work told me that I look more tired!! Initially I was using it twice a day as instructed. After 2 months, I started to use it only at night and resume my other eye cream in morning. My problem mainly is circles under the eyes-- not that dark, no real puffiness. My complexion is Medium (I&#x27;m Indian). Also I didn&#x27;t like the dispenser, I found it to be a pain to use. Squeezing the syringe to get just the amount I needed always frustrated me. I always ended up with too much coming out (which sucks when a product is this expensive!). I have steady hands so it definitely wasn&#x27;t me, maybe I got a defective syringe... I have tried a handful of other creams which were not this expensive and seemed to work a little better. I plan on returning it given the price.</li>
    <li> I did not notice it does much.  Also, I have a bit of dry eye problems and the serum irritates this.  I wake up with dryer eyes so will probably quit using it all together.</li>
    <li> I like this serum better than any I have ever used.</li>
    <li> It can be notice from the first time its used to wjen is not used. Doesnt entirely gets rid.of the problem but, its better to use it then not. I recommend it to anyone who wants to cover dark circles or better said to dimnish the bags.</li>
    <li> Probably need to give it more time. I have seen some results, though. Increased fullness and overall healthier appearance of skin.</li>
    <li> can totally see a difference.  I have some fine lines around my eyes that have completely disappeared! (nothing left to say but must meet the minimum word requirement?!?!?)</li>
    <li> This syringe was defective and does not operate. I have purchased this product before and it is a fine product, but it was from  a different seller and I had absolutely no problems with the syringe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I never tried to use it because I still had lotion serum left in my previous order from another company. When I did finally try the product, my time window for return had lapsed, so beware of thinking the product is good without trying it immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am outraged that I am a victim by buying from Amazon with this return policy.</li>
    <li> i used this product religously just like the instructions said..... i could tell no difference.  i would not order again.....;(</li>
    <li> nothing I would ever buy again, cucumber will do the same. But then who knows it might help someone, but not my daugher</li>
    <li> Did nothing. Absolutely useless!</li>
    <li> I like it but a little pricey for me.</li>
    <li> After years of all-nighters and working on maybe 3 hours of sleeping, the bags and dark circles under my eyes were getting worse with time. Along with that, my concealer started doing more harm than good. So I decided to ditch my concealer and began my search for a solution. I found myself trying every and anything I could get my hands on but nothing seem to do the trick. Then my co-worker told me about Elite Eye Serum. Now given my prior experience with countless eye creams, it goes without saying that I was quite skeptical about the product but I gave in and decided to give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;Within two weeks I began eating my words and was pleasantly surprised by the results I saw in my mirror. The first thing I notice was my dark circles slowly being to fade with each application, followed by my puffy bags deflating. Two months ago I wouldn&#x27;t dare leave my apartment without a heavy application of concealer around my eyes. Now my morning routine has been simplified to adding the Serum and walking out my apartment. This also means I get an extra 15 minutes of sleep now :-)</li>
    <li> I have been using this eye serum consistently day &amp; night for over a month and I am really pleased with the results! The obvious improvement on the dark circles and bags under my eyes was terrific. I&#x27;m really pleased that I finally found something that works really well for me. I have been very disappointed with other products and the general performance they have had. It really makes for a long time to see results and I don&#x27;t like having to wait for several weeks in some cases, before I am able to see results. I have been very satisfied with this product and the results are apparent. My husband sees the difference and my coworkers see it as well. The pictures posted online are almost spot on and I&#x27;m very happy with this. This product price is more expensive than the average eye serum out there that is available in any WalMart or Target. That might work for someone, or at least those customers &#x60;think&#x27; it works for them but really this does the trick that finer salons would do and this makes no bones about the cost. Beauty is expensive and bringing the face back 10 or 20 years can be an investment...as it should be. I highly recommend this product for the great results I have seen!!!</li>
    <li> waste of money, it didn&#x27;t do anything for me. I applied it exactly how the instructions required me to with no results after a month</li>
    <li> Being 67, I have to be more careful with my skin care.  So lucky I found this!  The applicator is unique in itself, in that it only measures what you actually need.  I&#x27;ve been using it about 6 weeks now, and have to honestly say, it works like a charm.  My &amp;#34;smile wrinkles&amp;#34; have diminished greatly and my friends say I look much younger.  There is great value in the cost of this product.  I suggest you try it for yourself; you will love it too!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work?  It&#x27;s like a pen and nothing comes out very disappointed I am sending it back would not use again!!</li>
    <li> You know milia? Those things that look like pimples, but aren&#x27;t? Fat lumps under the skin, apparently. Well, this thing gave me three milia after a week of use. I did some googling and apparently I need a lighter moisturiser to prevent them.</li>
    <li> This only removes puffiness. It didn&#x27;t work for me after using it for some time. Not happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Been putting this on twice a day and you can not tell the difference between first day or the last.&lt;br /&gt;DON&#x27;T BOTHER WITH THIS PRODUCT..</li>
    <li> Had high hopes for this product. Didn&#x27;t do anything for me. Switched to obagi eye serum and seems to be working better for me. Although it&#x27;s a bit pricey</li>
    <li> Saw on dr oz and this is my second tube. Lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Deep circles are fading very fast. No allergies. You should give it a try. I am planning to order a new one</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do anything. I am using it for about a month.  Will update my review if this serum start working.  The only problem that I have is puffiness under my eyes. This serum doesn&#x27;t help with this problem.</li>
    <li> NO DIFFERENCE after 2 months!! Bought FROM SKIN PRO too I wish I had bougth here so return would&#x27;ve been easy to do!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; THIS half tube of USE Has CREATED DARK BAGS Under MY  EYES, I DID NOT HAVE !

    <li> I would love to give this 5 stars! That would mean that my eyes looked younger. Sadly, I really hadn&#x27;t noticed much difference at all.</li>
    <li> I was amazed with the results I got in just one week,I noticed how my crow feet were diminishing and I am very happy with that. As far as the puffiness and dark circles, that&#x27;s another story because it has not worked for me. I have been using this product for maybe a little over a month.</li>
    <li> This stuff really does work! My undereyes are extremelyyy purple (hereditary) and though it didn&#x27;t get rid of them completely, it did lighten them up quite a bit!</li>
    <li> The syringe is not working properly. The seller should replace it.</li>
    <li> After using this product for a few short months, I am seeing results.  After having regular facials with the same person for years, I was asked what I was doing different since my last facial.  I told her I had been using your product on a regular basis.  She said - keep it up, your skin is looking great!</li>
    <li> I purchased this under eye cream about twenty five days back and have been religiously using it since then twice every day after my regular skincare regime (CTM); once in the morning and once before going to sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say that finally, I have come to find what I&#x27;ve been looking for a long time now. I have tried a lot of other cremes from various brands but nothing worked right. I was hopeless and thought maybe there isn&#x27;t anything for these under-eye problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had developed dark circles since I was 25 and was also experiencing puffiness every morning. I have a sensitive skin and many of the products I had tried in the past made matters even worse for me than they were before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, I am really happy to have found this Elite Serum, the dark circles are fifty percent gone; I could see the results from the fifteenth day onward and best of all, there is so much relief from the puffiness that used to bother me a lot. I recommend this whole heartedly to fellow ladies who are facing similar under eye problems.</li>
    <li> I do not have any wrinkles yet, but this product helps keep my eyes looking young. I am in my late 20s and I dislike having puffiness around my eyes. I was looking for something that would not irritate my eyes and help get rid of the puffiness. This works and it&#x27;s natural!</li>
    <li> i didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my skin. just because this comes in a \\&quot;syringe\\&quot; doesn&#x27;t make it professional! actually too much product wasted still in the syringe. i would never buy this again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few years, and LOVE it! Best price by far.  I&#x27;ve paid retail of $89.00 for this before.  Although its well worth it at that price getting it for unbelievably cheaper here on amazon is the way to go.  Unfortunately, this formula is discontinued so I tried to stock up :) Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> Ive read the reviews and I was skeptical. Personally I dont know what all the hype is about. I have been using it for 2 weeks now and I dont notice any difference. waste of 100 bucks!</li>
    <li> Been using this eye serum religiously day &amp; nite for almost 1 mth..but still no improvement on my eyebags under my eyes..very disappointed with product performance..as it is supposed to be good as seen on pics posted online..furthermore price is very expensive..i paid S$102 (incld shipping). Will not recommend to others &amp; will not buy again..but i will still continue using as to not waste it &amp; hope to c some rslts soon.</li>
    <li> I was so pleased with this product! I have a lot of wrinkles from squinting so much because my eyes are so bad and I must say this products works really well! I can already tell that the lines around my eyes are starting to fade. I would definitely recommend this product for anyone that is trying to reduce or get rid of their wrinkles!</li>
    <li> I bought this so long ago and didn&#x27;t finish it. I&#x27;m terrible with keeping a schedule but I tried for awhile with this. It did nothing for me overall. I did skip a day or two so maybe that had something to do with it. After putting it on, I did feel a little tightness around the eyes so maybe it works after prolonged use. I only used it consistently for about two months (including the days skipped).</li>
    <li> I started using this product and it took a few days for me to see the results, but when I noticed I was pleasantly surprised. The area under my eyes looks smoother and less puffy. I will continue to use this product and I recommend it to others when they ask what am I using on my skin.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this for a few weeks. It has a gel like texture and I&#x27;m not sure of the hydration factor when using it. I&#x27;ve not had any flaking or dryness around my eyes since using it so I assume it&#x27;s doing its job. The applicator tube looks like a large  hypodermic syringe. It dispenses a small drop of the gel so there is no waste and it seems to keep the product pure. It is very expensive so I hope it works as described!!</li>
    <li> i was skeptical, but based on all the positive reviews, i decided to try this. i&#x27;ve been using it for about 4 weeks, and i definately see a difference in my undereye bags and particularly in my undereye wrinkles. they aren&#x27;t gone, but they are less noticeable. i&#x27;m impressed and am excited to see results after a few months of use.</li>
    <li> As a university student of Classical Studies, I spent many all-nighters writing my papers, reading and translating, studying for exams, and needless to say, it took a toll on me, as I&#x27;d have to go to class with bags under my eyes. Now, I&#x27;m skeptical of just about every beauty product on the market - I don&#x27;t even take cold meds - but Elite Serum does the trick - not only are the bags gone, but leaves my skin moist and smooth, wrinkle free. Not sure if it&#x27;s the tension in the skin that this soothing serum helps to work out, but applying it to dark circles is easy and mess free with its syringe container, and once applied, I feel fully rested and confident in my appearance. After a night of hard studying, I&#x27;m ready to meet the day. Who needs to spend extra money on cosmetic surgery or has the money - especially when you can have Elite&#x27;s serum delivered to your door? You guys rock!!</li>
    <li> I have tried everything to treat my under eye puffiness, from drug store creams to expensive department store serums and I have tried every home remedy that currently floating around Pinterest and nothing, I mean nothing has worked. I don&#x27;t know why I have such bad puffiness because I always drink lots of water throughout the day, stay away from unhealthy foods and I don&#x27;t wear contacts or have allergies, but despite this, I still wake up everyday looking like I only slept 3 hours.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try Elite Serum after finding the product on YouTube. I wasn&#x27;t sure at first, really leary to buy another expensive (I&#x27;m a single mom so I stick to budget friendly products when I can) eye serum. Right away I felt instant relief. The serum has a cooling effect to it. As soon as I patted it on, my skin felt like it was tingling, not in a bad way though, it felt refreshing, like placing cool cucumbers on my eyes. I noticed really quickly that the puffiness seemed less and it continued to fade away with each application. I&#x27;m almost done with my first tube (syringe actually)and I must say, despite my initial concerns, I am hooked!!</li>
    <li> Within a few weeks, I could see a visible reduction of wrinkles and noticed overall better looking skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product worked great and within the few weeks, I was receiving compliments of the dark circles and bags under my eyes going away and my face was looking smooth and wrinkles were going away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad I found this product as I am finally getting the skin I had years ago and now when I go out, I can put on my makeup and feel confident that I look great and I absolutely love that feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never would get in pictures with my kids because when I smile, you could see the wrikles big time around my eyes and mouth and now I look like I am in my 20&#x27;s again and it is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product and I highly recommend you try it out as you would not regret it.</li>
    <li> I was really happy with this serum, I&#x27;ll be buying it again. I wasn&#x27;t having much luck with the dark circles around my eyes until I tried this product. I saw significant improvement. It&#x27;s easy to apply, it glides right on. It helps with my crows feet as well. I look younger so I feel better and more confident. I really recommend it!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product.  I heard a recommendation from Dr. Oz, but was dubious at first.  It is a lot of money, after all.  But Wow!  After 2 weeks I can&#x27;t believe the difference! My puffy eyes look normal now and the lines at the corners are almost gone.  The darkness under my eyes is much lighter too.  All in all, a very worthwhile product!</li>
    <li> This Eye Serum has done so many favors for me. I used to wake up every morning with dark bags under my eyes, and I tried many different cosmetic products, but they only temporarily covered it up. When my friend told me about this Elite Eye Serum, I came on Amazon to find it..and have been using it every day since then. My eyes look and feel better! The skin around my eyes is great, and I am no longer embarrassed by my skin. It looks younger and even feels younger! Thank you Elite Eye Serum!</li>
    <li> Wow! This stuff really works! I was skeptical about the Elite Eye Serum, all these kinds of products promise to make you look years younger and so on. But we know that&#x27;s not always the case. Well I&#x27;m happy to say that after trying the Elite Eye Serum I can report that it made me look younger after a few applications. Usually in the mornings I would wake up with very puffy eyes and people at work would always kid me about burning the midnight oil too much. I just shrugged it off but it stayed at the back of my head, and I&#x27;ve been thinking more and more about the bags under my eyes with the holidays coming up and seeing relatives I haven&#x27;t seen in a while. On a whim, I tried the Elite Eye Serum and I&#x27;m glad I did, people now tell me about how relaxed and great I look! I didn&#x27;t tell them what I did and I won&#x27;t tell my relatives either when I see them next month.</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical at first after trying so many other expensive name brand products, but I decided to purchase it as a birthday gift and I am sooo happy I did! I am super shocked about how fast it worked , I was expecting it not to work ( because of bad experiences) or to take forever to see results ,but none of the above happened. I don&#x27;t even need to get fillers like clock work anymore ( sorry dr berman). I also purchased one for my mom and she will be reviewing soon because she is super happy with the results( she is in her 60s) . I also want to make note that I have super sensitive ethnic skin and was nervous this had crazy harsh chemicals in it but I did not have any reaction to the serum.I am using less makeup because my skin looks fabulous and I don&#x27;t feel I need as much. I also noticed my hubby has been dipping into it so I have to order more but I will continue to use and preach this product till the day I die!</li>
    <li> I have seen many advertisements for anti-aging products and was skeptical of claims made in the ads.  A friend of mine had used Elite Serum and raved about the difference in her skin after only a few applications.  I had received a gift card for Amazon so I decided to try Elite Serum for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first week, I was amazed at the appearance of my skin.  It was as if I had turned back time.  The circles and puffiness under my eyes were disappearing.  My frown lines and crow&#x27;s feet became less visible.  My skin felt smoother and looked toned.  Much to my surprise, I looked radiant and years younger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the product packaging and dispensing system to be efficiently designed and easy to use.  I especially like how the product is dispensed in equal quantities with each application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elite Serum not only transformed my skin, this fantastic product changed me from a skeptic to a believer.</li>
    <li> I have serious dark circles below my eyes. I had high hopes because of the reviews about this eye serum. Supposedly the best on the market now but eventhough my dark circles diminished slightly. The skin about my eyes are now dry. So there is a small upside but also a downside.</li>
    <li> I am approaching the age where lines seem to be appearing around my eyes almost daily.  I have tried many over-the-counter products for up to a month without any apparent results.  I considered going to my dermatologist for botox shots, but not only am I fearful of needles, but also the cost of seeing her is prohibitive.  My sister-in-law suggested that I begin to use Elite-Serum as quickly as possible.  She has been using it faithfully for awhile now and looks great.  (To be honest, I credited her young look to good genes.)  However, I was a bit hesitant at first since I have been burnt many times by mere cosmetics. So I decided to do some online research.  What initially impressed me was the research done on this product.  This was not just a concoction of creams and perfumes.  Elite Serum contains proven ingredients that were tested by professions.  So I ordered the product.  Do not be put off by the description of using the pump.  It is much simpler than described.  The serum felt different from any other previous product I had used.  After a couple of weeks I noticed the results.  And what is even funnier, my sister-in-law guessed immediately that I was using it when she saw me over the holidays.  So I am a convert - a younger-looking and happier user of Elite Serum.  And to cinch it - the company offers good deals price-wise, so I am getting a great product that, for once, actually works, but is affordable.</li>
    <li> Tried the product, just didn&#x27;t work for me.  No problem there, we are all different skin types.  The problem is trying to cancel the \\&quot;subscription\\&quot;.  I&#x27;ve made 1/2 a dozen calls, non of which are to the actual company itself because they won&#x27;t give that information out.  Received 2 \\&quot;do you really want to cancel\\&quot; emails.  Replied both times like I was supposed to and still my account isn&#x27;t cancelled and I&#x27;m still getting charged for product I don&#x27;t want.  Now they are asking me to fill out a cancelation form and fax it back.  Getting really ticked off now.  Don&#x27;t deal with this company if you are hoping to cancel the monthly subscription anytime.</li>
    <li> No improvement.  A lot of money for no results.  Have much better results from Roc products.  Not sure about all of the positive reviews--maybe paid reviews????</li>
    <li> This instantly made my dark circles and puffiness worse.  I thought I was imagining it at first, until I continued to use it for several days and it only got worse and worse....&lt;br /&gt;I also used it around my mouth and it did seem to help with the fine lines there.&lt;br /&gt;It took nearly 2 weeks after stopping using it for the dark circles and extra puffiness to subside...&lt;br /&gt;Would not recommend!</li>
    <li> This serum did nothing for me, I&#x27;ve been using it for few weeks and no improvement for my under eye dark circles.&lt;br /&gt;SO DISAPPOINTED. I will continue using it until it&#x27;s done but I will never buy it again. If I see any further improvement I will update my review.</li>
    <li> Company \\&quot;Skinpro\\&quot; makes it next to impossible to cancel.  It became necessary for me to cancel my credit card to stop the shipments and billing from re-occurring.  I have never encountered a business that was this poorly run and had such poor customer service.  In my opinion, the actions Skinpro has taken to continue billing me for their products is borderline fraudulent.  I have gone through 4 separate processes just to cancel my subscription.  This is unacceptable and fraudulent.  I will never order from this company again and am writing this review to disclose their underhanded practises to others.  This company should be ashamed of themselves preying on hardworking people and in addition preying on persons trying to enhance their physical self.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;99% of the companies I have dealt with have made it a pleasant experience to cancel a subscription or discontinue use of their products in the hopes that you will one day repeat your business with their establishment.&lt;br /&gt;I first called to cancel, then I had to reply to an email to cancel, then fill out a lengthy cancellation form containing irrelevant information to cancel a simple subscription.  I had to call a second time only to be greeted by a uncertain and uninterested customer service rep. who stated that he was unsure whether I would be able to return the unwanted product, simply restating that an email would be sent in 24hrs to confirm cancellation.  These types of business proceedings are both criminal and wrong and should not even exist in present day customer/business relations.  I hope that repeated reports of their poor business practises reaches the Better Business Bureau(BBB) and other governing and federal bodies and their predatory business practises cease and they are no longer able to do business with honest people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buyer beware.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, if your cancellation process was simple, then we wouldn&#x27;t be here now would we?  I have made several online purchase, including healthand beauty subscriptions and have never had to sign and fax a declaration of my intent to cancel.  The last time I had to sign and state my intent to quit was when I gave my resignation in at work.  I doubt Skinpro is seeking the same effect.  I challenge you to name one reputable vendor that requires the same obtuse cancellation process.  And please don&#x27;t name cell phone companies because we all know how reputable they are at gouging customers and unless Skinpro has started sellling cellphones and cable then it just doesn&#x27;t compare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most honest and reputable online companies like Amazon, Walmart, Sears don&#x27;t do this.  A simple phone call to customer service or hitting the unsubscribe button on the cancellation web page is usually sufficient enough.  God forbid that you lose a subscription and the company comes to a standing halt.  But in the world of Skinpro the ball goes into their court and now they have to pull out all the stops to deter you from cancelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This undermines the customer who you think is too stupid or ill informed to have made this decision to cancel on their own.  Like as if by sheer accident I chose to cancel my Skinpro subscription, now to make sure that we are on the same page after calling and talking to a customer service rep.  I now wait 24 hours for a confirmation email to which I have to reply in the subject line with my intent to cancel.  At this point another email is sent out with instructions to print and fill in by hand, sign, date and fax back to Skinpro.  What&#x27;s next?  Do you want to see my income statement and oversees investments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your initial point of contact when seeking to cancel is a \\&quot;1-800\\&quot; number.  Nothing else.  You would assume there would be a cancellation page or instructions on the website.  Trust me readers, i&#x27;ve checked.  You have to contact them by phone at which time you wait for a confirmation email which unwittingly at lengths attempts to keep you on board with their company.  After replying in the subject line \\&quot;Please Cancel my Subscription\\&quot; and a similar message in the body of the email, you are sent another email with a \\&quot;last ditch\\&quot; effort on behalf of Skinpro to keep you aboard with another effort on your part to cancel.  This time filling out a lengthy cancellation form and faxing it back Skinpro, crossing your fingers that this is the last you will hear from them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;lengthy\\&quot; form for cancellation is just that, an inconvenience to the customer.  Do you not have this information on file?  Is it too much or too complex for a customer service rep to retrieve the information and process the cancellation?  Or are customer service reps paid by the second and this would eat into Skinpros profits in human resources?  This would explain the enthusiasm of the customer service rep the second occasion I called and explained my dillemma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This review is my personal experience with your company and 100% authentic.  I repeat, Skinpro&#x27;s cancellation process is borderline fraudulent.  I&#x27;m not sure what happens after the cancellation form because at this point I observed the deceptive business practices of Skinpro and contacted my credit card company immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buyer Beware.  Skinpro is like your obnoxious in-laws who moved in after the banking and mortgage crisis and refused to leave.  Even after you&#x27;ve talked to them personally, sent them straight forward emails and finally had to send them a written document, sign, dated and faxed.  Everything short of having a Sheriff on one side and a lawyer on the other just to get them to stop draining money from my wallet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Skinpro!</li>
    <li> I have had dark circles under my eyes for the last couple years. I was hopeful based on the positive reviews I saw on this product that it might have some effect. At roughly $90-$100 per tube, it was an expensive gamble. Unfortunately it did little or nothing. I actually took photos from before I started and each week. I went through two tubes over roughly 90 days (by which time it was supposed to have very noticeable effect) and then bought 2 more just in case I may have a more challenging problem... I have been using it for 4.5 months and comparing the weekly photos I see no noticeable difference. What I can say is that it feel good when you apply it and massage it in. But then, perhaps using any cheap skin lotion twice per day and massaging it in would also feel good... so I can&#x27;t recommend this product based on my experience. Save your money.</li>
    <li> This serum really works! As 46 year old with light skin complex, people often complimented me for my young look (probably they were just being nice (^^). However, since turning 45 last year, my eyes started getting the puffiness with noticable dark eye circle. Since then, I have been looking for something to replace my expensive $200 serum that can work well and less expensive. And here I&#x27;m with this wonderful Elite serum, I am on my 2nd tube and will continue to use it for a long time! Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Elite Serum for about a week and a half now, applying it in the morning and evening.  I have seen NO results.  Maybe I haven&#x27;t given it enough time?????  If I see no results and I&#x27;ve used all of it I certainly wouldn&#x27;t re-order it again especially at this price.  I&#x27;ve noticed that Dr. Oz seems to be of the opinion that every product a guest endorses he&#x27;ll agree with that guest that it&#x27;s the best and the one to use.  Dr. Oz does have some good health recommendations but I&#x27;m beginning to question him about his cosmetic \\&quot;endorsements\\&quot;.  I&#x27;ll keep using the serum like I said; if I see an improvement I&#x27;ll add to this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;April 24, 2013 - It&#x27;s been about three weeks now that I have been using Elite Serum.  I&#x27;ve been in contact during this period with customer service and they&#x27;ve helped me with some questions I had.  I was using only one squirt for both eyes; One squirt per eye is what is supposed to be used.  According to CS I need to give the serum approximately 45 days to see real results so I pulled the trigger too soon to critique Elite Serum fairly.  I&#x27;ll update my review in two or three weeks to post where I&#x27;m at.  I want to give the product a fair shake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I did learn is that Elite Serum has excellent customer service and they are more than helpful and very easy to communicate with.  More in the future.  FYI:  I now rate the product and company (which in my opinion is as important as the product itself) a four.  I have a good feeling it&#x27;ll be changed to five stars soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May 18th 2013 - Obviously more time has passed and I have continued using Elite Serum twice daily per instructions by the customer rep.  I have noticed no visible change yet.  I&#x27;ll continue to use Elite Serum till the last drop and give my final analysis of the product.  CS was going to send me a complimentary item which I still haven&#x27;t received.</li>
    <li> Save your money just buy rapid wrinkle cream from neutragena for 14.00$. I personally went to NEURIUM and love it.</li>
    <li> I like this product pretty well however it doesn&#x27;t reduce my puffiness from allergies/pollen.  Maybe I am wrong in hoping it would but my lines have certainly decreased and no puffiness from late nights.  Not sure if I would pay this much for it again though but it does work.</li>
    <li> Not even close did absolutely nothing...</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference with my eye bags since I started using this product. It does go on nice and smooth, absorbs well with no smells and may be helping out and protecting the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure yet, but I would recommend if your looking for an eye cream</li>
    <li> Hi, i meanly bought this for dark circles, didn&#x27;t work for me , but everybody is different, it helps with the pufiness , maybe some wrinkles , but defenitly not for dark circles, i have bben using it for a month. Day and night.  An no changes.  At least nothing that i can be impress.  I ordered today a different cream.  Hope i have better luck :)&lt;br /&gt;I am trying the Basqnyc cucumber tea eye gel.</li>
    <li> Superb packaging and technology. Very nice to see a company invest so much into the delivery and overall presentation of their product. I haven&#x27;t seen anything like the Elite Serum syringe before and I&#x27;d have to say, it&#x27;s one of the coolest dispensing systems I have ever seen before. As for how it works? The serum is excellent. It&#x27;s a clear serum which I like because you don&#x27;t have to try and match a shade to your skin tone. It has no odor to it, those with sensitivities or allergies shouldn&#x27;t have any trouble. It slides right onto the skin with very little effort and dries, or absorbs rather, very quickly. For the first time in awhile, I am 100% satisfied with my skin care purchase.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  The syringe packaging gives the illusion of a potent product when in reality it&#x27;s just a pain to use.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference, and think this company exploited Dr. Oz&#x27;s name. With that said, some of the ingredients were actually recommended by Dr. Oz as being beneficial; maybe the concentrations are just not enough in this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had crow&#x27;s feet and dark circles under my eyes for some time. Since I don&#x27;t have any sleep disorder I thought they were hereditary. I also thought there was not much I could do about them. I tried to ignore them but then I heard about Elite Serum from my sister and decided to give it a try. I am fairly impressed with the results so far. I wouldn&#x27;t call it a miracle, but there is definitely some improvement to the dark circles that annoyed me and made me feel self conscious. I&#x27;m a guy and I&#x27;m not into beauty products but I had to do something. I feel more confident now.</li>
    <li> My mom has been using this product for a while and told me how amazing it was.  She was right.  My face is pretty good for my age, with the exception of a few fine lines around my eyes, which really annoy me.  I was seriously considering getting botox until I tried this.  After just a few weeks, I swear the lines disappeared.  It wasn&#x27;t cheap and normally, I don&#x27;t like to spend more than $50 on face products, but this was completely worth the money. The syringe applicator dispenses a small amount of product so nothing is wasted, which makes it lasts a while.  I really appreciate the dispenser because I cannot even count the number of times I&#x27;ve bought products and way too much is dispensed.  Or worse, those tubs of eye cream that get really germy and gross.  I will continue to be a loyal buyer of Elite Serum.</li>
    <li> I was hoping to love this product. I&#x27;ve given it a few applications to see if maybe I&#x27;m just having a bad eye day but I do look worse after I apply the serum. I bought this mostly for prevention. I have some fine lines and dark circles but when I apply the serum my eyes swell and puff up. I look like I&#x27;ve been crying for days. I did read in another review that maybe it depends where I bought it from in case it&#x27;s a knock off. I bought it off of Amazon from one of their vendors. Hopefully it was the real thing...it came in a loose clear bag no real packaging. I will have to send it back and let my eyes get back to normal.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going to test it against the serum I usually use from LifeCell South Beach Skincare.&lt;br /&gt;So far there seems to be no difference between the two except price.</li>
    <li> I used this serum every day, twice a day, for about a month (or however long it was until the tube was empty).  While it was non-greasy, absorbed quickly, and was fine under make-up - I did not see or feel any improvements on my 30-something skin.  Not recommended.</li>
    <li> Like many others, after seeing the recommendation about Argireline creams on Dr. Oz, I took out my credit card for the umpteenth time trying to find that proverbial fountain of youth.  Spending a small fortune on inferior products, and getting burned - I had my doubts.  BUT, thankfully, I take Dr. Oz&#x27;s word like gospel, and I&#x27;m glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many of my co-workers and neighbors have commented on my look. It&#x27;s been a short while, but I can say my crow&#x27;s feet look less noticeable and the skin under my eyes is more full.  Im anxious to see how long the effects of Elite Serum last, but so far they are remarkable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Customer service is VERY helpful as well. I must have gone back and forth 8 times before buying and each reply was prompt and personal.</li>
    <li> A friend of mine turned me on to this product after he saw how much sleep I had actually been losing over work. The stress was showing, and the fact that it did made things even worse. The dark circles under my eyes were making things even worse. I was stuck in an endless circle (literally) where nothing was working out. Once my friend let me use his, I bought my own after a week. The difference was phenomenal.I looked refreshed, and I started feeling refreshed too. A new confidence overtook me, because of this serum and I felt great! My skin felt smooth and glowed. People thought I had a new crush, but I never let them know my real secret. This serum works!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a month now.  I love the package and the way it works you can get the correct amount for each eye BUT I haven&#x27;t seen where it has done any good for me.  I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m fairly young, so I have yet to be blessed with smile lines around my eyes. But nevertheless I have very very tired eyes. Dark under circles, wrinkles out of... sleepyness (I guess), and overall it makes me look unmotivated and exhausted. I bought this product after seeing some rave reviews online and thought I&#x27;d give it a shot. It was very easy to use, pretty much self-explanitory. And I saw results way faster than I had with any other serum I&#x27;d tried. My eyes look more awake and bright.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can put foundation under my eyes and by the end of the day it won&#x27;t be overshadowed with my dark tired undercircles. In fact there are NO undercircles! I&#x27;ve used this product for about two weeks now with constant success. I&#x27;m very pleased with it. I can&#x27;t speak on the behalf of most wrinkles and crows feet, but for under-eye wrinkles and dark circles this product has worked like magic. My eyes not only look more awake, they feel more awake. And I feel way more confident greeting the day when I don&#x27;t look like I just woke up.</li>
    <li> As an Alpha male, I was always reluctant to use beauty products such as this. However, after seeing the improvements it made on my lady friend (who was very attractive to start) I decided to see what it could do for me. Well, I was pleasantly surprised. I would even say, shocked! Those pesky little lines (which were previously getting longer and bigger) actually started to recede and even disappear after only a few weeks! So guys, forget about the rugged male look as you get older. The truth is you want to look younger. You want to get rid of those lines that are rapidly aging you. Start here, you wouldn&#x27;t regret it-one alpha male to another!</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo2SSHQ3SUPPUXA]]I started using Elite Serum about 6 weeks ago, and I have definitely seen a difference in the fine lines around my eyes.  The lines are much softer and less pronounced.  I use the product in the morning and evening and it does what it claims.  I have tried countless anti-wrinkle eye products in the past, but will continue to use Elite Serum as a part of my daily regime.  I like the fact that it is easily dispensed from the syringe and it goes on smoothly and not tacky.  It absorbs but at the same time, keeps my skin moisturized.  It&#x27;s also great for using on frown lines in the forehead.  It noticeably softens the lines.  It works great and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking to add in a quality product to their anti-aging skin routine.</li>
    <li> Finally--A product that got rid of my dark circles!!  I&#x27;ve tried just about everything in the past-- more sleep, change in diet, cucumbers, tea bags, you name it...none of them seemed to work well.  Elite Eye Serum works wonders on dark circles, and also greatly reduced the wrinklesaround my eye! Don&#x27;t let the higher price tag scare you away...it is worth it!  I rarely leave reviews about products unless they really blow me away...this serum delivers!</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  I know the ingredients that they say in the product are supposed to be Great for our skin.  But the reason I&#x27;m not giving it a five star is because I&#x27;m sure if it has really done anything yet.  I&#x27;m on my second serum.</li>
    <li> What the heck, I&#x27;m a mixture of Mexican, black and Irish. My dark circles didn&#x27;t diminish I assume since maybe there hereditary it doesn&#x27;t work as its supposed to.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much, but boy, was I wrong! I started using this serum at the beginning of November 2013 and I started noticing improvement over the last few weeks. My problem is my upper eye area - saggy lids - especially on my right eye, because I usually sleep on my right side. My right eyelid area really looks lifted now, comparable to the left eyelid, which is in much better shape, because it doesn&#x27;t get crushed by the pillow all night.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend the product, give it a try. And it lasts a long time, because you need just a tiny drop for each eye. Another thing I do to lessen my wrinkles and I highly recommend this: use a satin pillow cover. It really helps keep wrinkles at bay and even improving them. Also good for your hair, because you don&#x27;t wake up with extreme bedhead in the morning. It may be a combo of the pillow and the serum that helps, so do both!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work do not get</li>
    <li> I was really looking forward to trying this product. I used it three times and the area under my eyes became very  swollen.  I had to put ice on my eyes and they still looked swollen. Has anyone else experienced this reaction to elite eye serum?</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for the sole purpose of treating my dark under eye circles and puffiness.  I don&#x27;t have issues with fine lines or wrinkles yet, but I like the fact that this product helps with that too.  Hopefully by using the product to treat my dark under eyes, I can help keep future wrinkles away.  For those consumers who have used the product for only a short period of time, I can say that no product will provide &#x60;instant&#x27; miracle results.  I used the product for about 30 days before I saw noticeable improvements, but when I did, it was like someone turned a light switch on.  All of a sudden the area under my eyes looked refreshed and not tired anymore.  The circles are barely there now, to the point where I don&#x27;t have to wear under eye concealer, just my foundation alone covers any last reminiscence of the circles that used to haunt me.  I&#x27;ve been impressed with this product so far.  I also like the dispenser.  It makes it really easy to apply and I don&#x27;t have any issues with it jamming.  Nothing worse then buying a product and having to return it because the pump doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I would  recommend this product to anyone willing to pay the price. I did use this serum around the eyes as that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s for, but found it to be even more successful  above and around the mouth area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s too expensive for he actual amount that you get. I think there are other alternatives out there at a better price</li>
    <li> Absolute waste of money and time. To me, this company should be sues for false advertisement...I did not get one bit of change after spending nearly $100.</li>
    <li> I admit I was skeptical about trying this product out as there are so many eye serums and creams promising to do this or that.  Many are expensive and it is one of the reasons why I&#x27;ve waited until I have found reliable and concrete information I need.  The Elite Serum helped to smooth some wrinkling I had on the corners of my eyes.  It was well worth the effort.  I wish it could take away everything but it did a great job on what I was looking.</li>
    <li> To be completely honest, I&#x27;m floored by all of the hype here in response to this product. I read the reviews, bought it expecting a real improvement, and am seeing nothing. Really! I mean NOTHING! This was a stressful year and dark circles are sort of... new for me. Not something I&#x27;ve dealt with before. Recently, I turned 39 and well, we know how age+stress can &#x3D; trouble. This product has done nothing to help with that trouble. Circles are still here, as are the tiny lines and slight creping. Maybe it&#x27;s just me. It&#x27;s possible that it&#x27;s just me. I almost feel bad popping the Amazing Review Balloon for Elite Serum, but man! Nothing! At $100, I think it&#x27;s important to share this.</li>
    <li> Fancy packaging yes - product that works - not a chance! DO not waste your money unless you have money to throw away</li>
    <li> Just wanted to report this company uses fraud reviews... I was looking at a focus supplement with obvious fake reviews and was looking at their past reviews (usually just having the one only). But a HUGE amount of them had reviewed the same three unrelated products, in the exact same order, on close by dates, and that being their only review product history. At first I thought I accidentally clicked on the same profile more than once until I realized like 50 of the profiles of reviews going down the list that this was all their product history. Which was this anti-aging serum, a random nonfamous weight loss supplement, and the focus supplement. I don&#x27;t know if these three products are made from the same company or people got paid to review these three products all on the same day by the same source. But they are obviously fake. Check the review history of the reviewers yourself and the repeat reviews / repeat review orders. I would not buy from a company with these business ethics, IMO. They don&#x27;t care to get their reputation by having an actual product superior to other products that works; they&#x27;re willing to lie &amp; scam to make a profit instead -_- Seriously, Amazon should remove such sellers/companies permanently from their site to not ruin Amazon&#x27;s reputation.</li>
    <li> I use it everyday but truly do not see any difference especially for the money.  I would not order again.</li>
    <li> I had high expectations for this product after reading the reviews and hearing it was endorsed by Dr. Oz.  I have used for a full two months and can say there is absolutely no difference in my under eye area.  I would not say I hate the product - it dispenses nicely and feels nice on my skin, but for $100 I expect to see some results.  I&#x27;m not expecting miracles, but some improvement would have been nice.  I will not be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> I was really skeptical about this product bc it is suppose to help with black circles under your eyes. I can say that I did notice a subtle difference. My husband noticed it too but it really is not a huge difference. I think if you combine this with sleep, it will probably be more helpful p. I give it 3 stars. It does what it says but it not miraculous.</li>
    <li> Disappointed - Did Nothing&lt;br /&gt;These products did absolutely nothing for me. I was hoping for at least a little difference, but it was definitely a waste of time and money for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this pretty regularly for about two months and I think it&#x27;s pretty safe to conclude that the cost of this product in no way correlates to its effectiveness, given that it has done absolutely nothing for my persistent dark circles except perhaps make them slightly darker knowing that I&#x27;ve been burned once again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m probably the least vain person that you would meet, and as a middle-aged guy I have never particularly paid attention to stuff like this, but was introduced recently to a few products that really make a big difference in my overall look (tanner, face cleaner, etc.), and now I am quietly on the look for products that can have the same effect.  I have to say that I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy this on my own, based on the cost, but I had a chance to try it myself (received a free sample), and this was one of those things that really worked well for me.  I&#x27;m not sure why some people have had trouble, but it was really noticeable for me in a short time, especially around my eyes.  I wasn&#x27;t sure what I was expecting, but I thought it would make my skin look \\&quot;tight\\&quot;, kind of like a face-lift, but not the case at all.  However, it still removed a lot of small wrinkles.  Definitely worth looking into.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m getting married to the love of my life, needless to say, the pressure to look good is on. I&#x27;ve never paid much attention to my skin, especially my bedroom eyes. I gave this product a shot, after about a week of using Elite at night before bed, I really noticed a difference. The usual darkness that plagued my eyes is gone, not only has my skin improved, but my overall confidence as a man has increased... my ‪fianc&amp;eacute;e‬ has really noticed.&lt;br /&gt;I no longer feel the need to hide my eyes behind dark sunglasses, I&#x27;m a very very happy customer, and now I don&#x27;t feel so anxious for my big day.</li>
    <li> I thought I was doomed to have dark, puffy circles under my eyes or have cosmetic surgery to get rid of them.  I tried many products \\&quot;guaranteed\\&quot; to get rid of the problem, but nothing worked. I told my kids I was going to have a facelift, botox or whatever it took to take care of it. They didn&#x27;t believe me until I told them I had already made an appointment. My son&#x27;s girlfriend took me aside later that evening and told me about Elite Serum. Her mother had been using it with good results. I decided to give it a try before my appointment; I had three weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received it in just a few days and started using it immediately. My plan was to give it two weeks and see if anyone noticed anything. Ten days later, we all went out to dinner. My kids kept looking at me and whispering. Finally, my son aid \\&quot;Mom, I cannot believe you went through with it. What did you have done, botox?\\&quot;  This got them all talking at once about the dangers and silliness of cosmetic procedures. While I had noticed a bit of improvement, I did not think it was noticeable to anyone else and was surprised they noticed anything. I explained about Elite Serum and they all came closer to look at the results. They were truly amazed at how much had changed in such a short time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am thrilled with the product and highly recommend it to anyone suffering with dark puffy circles. It will make a huge difference in what you see in the mirror in a few weeks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for almost a month.  I have not seen any results yet.  The application syringe is a great idea.  I like that part because there isn&#x27;t any waste.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been about 3 weeks since i started using this product twice a day as recommended and I see no difference in my eye bags. For this amount of money I should see some kind of change. I&#x27;m not happy and I think we should be given the option to return but since its opened already I can&#x27;t. Don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
    <li> Not bad at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have seriously sensitive skin so I am always on the look out for odd products that are not lotions. Products that will not break me out, or cause extra skin issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised by the serum. In addition to not breaking me out I have noticed little things. The lines under and next to my eyes seem to have decreased, my eyes look brighter, and my makeup went on smoothly. Also the compliments at work in my office from my clients didn&#x27;t hurt either, gave me a bit of a confidence boost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum lasts a long time. I on the other hand do not read directions and just use whatever. So I will have to buy more. That is kinda the point though I will be buying more.</li>
    <li> I used the product as instructed daily nightly...after 3 days the cylinder in was contained in started to leak between the inside up and down motion?! so I had to pump twice instead of once.Did not last the allotted time it said,it was very much less. Nice feel to it..NO itchiness around the eyes or burning like other products with eye coverage .Saw some lighting of the under eye skin,and maybe some hydration where you would have bags but they were still there along with crow feet wrinkles??!</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product.  It works.  My under eye circles diminished. Also works on lines and wrinkles around the eye.</li>
    <li> I used this product for 6 months to give it a fair chance to work. Like many others on amazon, I am sad to say that this product does not work. I sincerely believe the company did a large campaign setting up fictitious reviews stating this product offers amazing results. Unfortunately, the product truely is a farce. I would second think purchasing this product.</li>
    <li> I used this product daily until it was all gone. Unfortunately, the product did nothing for me. I liked how it easily glided on my skin and had no smell, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a month, but I don&#x27;t see any improvement. I will try one more month to see any result.</li>
    <li> good product.it works.</li>
    <li> Never been the preppy type or Polo Sport guy who always has a bottle of cologne with him.  Never been the type to get facials, manicures, pedicures, anything really that women do for that matter.  Skin care for me is putting on sunblock when it&#x27;s 100 degrees.  Past that, I don&#x27;t really use beauty products or skin products.  On a suggestion that maybe it was time to look into treating my skin a bit better and paying attention to eye wrinkles and baggyness, I gave this product a shot.  To say it&#x27;s changed my mentality is probably one of the world&#x27;s greatest understatements.  Now I find myself looking for ancillary products to treat other problem areas of my skin, all because this one lived up to its potential.  Feeling great, looking great, and now a changed man as far as taking care of my skin.  If a blue collar guy like me can have his mind changed, you probably can too.</li>
    <li> I bought this after Dr. Oz talked about argirelene products on his show and after reading some of the other reviews on here.  I&#x27;ve been applying Elite Serum for a few weeks now and have seen lots of improvement to my skin.  This has been a great help and I will keep using.</li>
    <li> No difference than any other false claiming eye product.  Bottom line only surgery can help! I bought 2 - high hopes :(</li>
    <li> Well, I read the other reviews and I was very disappointed - not a product I would invest in again.  No improvement, no worse, no nothing!  Ho Hum.... This will not give you a miracle fix - quirky design is about as good as it got for me!</li>
    <li> This serum has great reviews so I tried it for my unrelenting dark under eye circles. But alas, it did not work for me, so passed it on to a friend. I&#x27;ll update if it works for her. I probably just have to try and cut out the 12hour night shifts.</li>
    <li> This product is ineffective, a waste of time and money. I will never recommend it to any of my friends.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been seeing so much about these eye serums lately and read through a lot of Amazon reviews before giving Elite Serum a try.  I&#x27;m happy I did!  I feel like I&#x27;ve tried everything available on here but never got results like I&#x27;ve gotten so far with Elite.  I&#x27;m impressed how much better my skin is in the month I&#x27;ve been using it.  If you&#x27;re looking for an eye serum, givce this one a try.</li>
    <li> As someone who has a really hard time sleeping, I often wake up with heavy bags under my eyes that make me look 10 years older! To fight off those heavy bags and occasional puffiness, I searched tirelessly for a high-quality eye serum and feel so lucky to have found Elite Eye Serum! Two times daily, I use small dabs of the lightweight gel, and get excited with every single application to see immediate restoration of the skin around my eyes. Because Elite Eye Serum uses \\&quot;argireline\\&quot;, a very safe and effective ingredient with similar effects to botox, getting the same great results from a simple, painless gel is worth every penny. I highly recommend Elite Eye Serum for people of all ages looking to stay fresh-faced and young!</li>
    <li> Im only 29 years old and African American. My skin wasn&#x27;t that bad. I only had dark shadows under my eyes and the skin was dry under my eyes. So i did some research and ran into elite serum. I read about it on websites and I watch videos . So i decided to try it. I been using it about three Weeks and you can&#x27;t even see my dark shadows . Elite serum is the best I ever had. You should try it.</li>
    <li> When I was young, I was a competitive swimmer. You know what that means: sun, sun, sun, and more sun. The pool I swam at was outdoors and I lived in Florida, so sunshine was not hard to come by. I must have been out in the sun at least twenty hours a week. I never used sun block, which I&#x27;m paying for now that I&#x27;m older. The wrinkles that have developed on my face have made me feel so old and unattractive. Every time I look in the mirror while brushing my teeth, fixing my hair, tweezing, and putting on makeup, all I see are wrinkles. I was always skeptical of the creams and skin products advertised on TV, especially since they are dirt cheap. Something that will move heaven and earth to remove wrinkles would be more expensive than $10 or $20. After browsing on Amazon, I stayed away from the big brand names and found Elite Serum. I went off on a limb and prayed to God that it would help. It did. I look younger, feel younger, and have more confidence in myself. My girl friends like to gossip about my transformation and are interested in my secret, so I think I&#x27;m about to create a few Elite Serum converts. It worked for me, let it work for you.</li>
    <li> I am a director who is 27 years old and lately I&#x27;ve been adding myself into my movies with a short cameo here and there, and my stylist recommended I should try this product out as a long term solution to improving my image on screen.  So I tried it out and after about a month I really felt like my skin was more photogenic, and I started to have a much younger onscreen presence.  When I would look in the mirror before takes I didn&#x27;t need any makeup anymore, just hopped in with a lot of confidence about the way my skin looked.  I really recommend Elite Serum for anyone who is self aware about their look because it&#x27;s really easy to use and just feels like a natural way to treat the skin when you start to age.</li>
    <li> I bought  Elite Serum (04/14/13) with you Amazon i just started using it last night (June 22, 2013) and now ( June 23) syringe&#x27;s  pump was  already broken.&lt;br /&gt;The elite serum that I ordered sometime April 2013 was broken (syringe) i just used it (06/22/13). Before that, I bought one worth 89.95 plus tax at www.eliteserum.com., then I saw that your price was much lower so I ordered from you Amazon. So I know how to lock and unlock the cap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I am thinking  thats why your price is much lower, was because the product you are selling are either old stocks or broken. You can check that I ordered a lot from you, and I might  stop ordering anything from you guys.</li>
    <li> Like most promising skin care products, this one falls right in there with no real observable difference, other than the person&#x27;s mind making them believe there may be some change. It&#x27;s no wonder our vanity keeps the cosmetic industry making billions of dollars. Buyer beware.</li>
    <li> Elite Serum is the first product I have found that is effective in treating some of the issues with my face and skin, especially crows feet, puffy eyes, and dark circles.  I work very late hours, and travel frequently, which often makes it difficult to make my skin/eyes look \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; on a daily basis. I have tried many other products (most of them, more expensive), and have even consulted with a cosmetic surgeon. However, after about 5 weeks of use, Elite Serum has  made me look younger, and eliminated many of the signs of aging that are often multiplied by my demanding schedule. I was amazed at how well this evened out my skin tone, and how my troubling dark spots were gone after just a few weeks of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a fantastic product that has a wide range of anti-aging capabilities.  This has worked better than any of the dozens of products I have tried, and it is all available in one little solution.</li>
    <li> I feel as though I have used every product under the sun, from Clinique to Dr. Brandt and most recently Ole Henriksen.  I have really sensitive eyes and certain products tend to bother me more than others, causing my eyes to sting or water.  I don&#x27;t like thick creams that are heavy because it&#x27;s impossible to apply makeup.  The last product I tried irritated my eyes so badly I had to stop using it and since I couldn&#x27;t find my receipt, I couldn&#x27;t return it.  I was just out the $50 bucks.  I heard about Elite Serum and debated for over a week as to whther or not I should try it!  At this point, I am so skeptical I was starting to think that nothing would work for me.  The flip side to that is a week with no product at all wreaks havoc!  I bit the bullet and bought.  I am so happy I did.  The lightweight non greasy serum does not irritate my eyes whatsoever.  The difference in how the area around my eyes looks is absolutely amazing.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now, twice daily and if I miss even one application I realize how bad my eyes look without Elite Serum.  I&#x27;d highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for the right serum for a long time.  As a result of waking up to dry and puffy eyes I looked into Elite Serum for help.  When I first discovered this incredible product I became very impressed.  The fact that it is needle free encouraged me to try it.  After just a few uses, my crow&#x27;s-feet look less obvious and the puffiness around my eyes have simply diminished.  I recommend this product for anyone who wants to get rid of their crow&#x27;s-feet and imperfections around their eyes.</li>
    <li> I love this product! Since I began using Elite Serum about a month ago, I&#x27;ve noticed that the delicate skin around my eyes, which typically showed me looking old and haggard,  has completely disappeared. Also, the dark circles and puffiness has gone away, too, and my crow&#x27;s feet have almost diminished. I feel fresh-face and rested. And, because Elite Serum is very concentrated, with just a drop goes a long way, I can use less which will last me for a very long time. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> The serum was just what I needed. I started applying it last week - super easy to use and I look and feel much younger! My wrinkles have nearly disappeared and all my friends want to know what my secret is. Cannot recommend this product highly enough. You have to give it a try!</li>
    <li> As a singer / songwriter, I’m on the road a lot. Every weekend, Friday and Saturday nights, I sing and by the time we tear down, get packed up, head home, it’s usually 3 am before I get to bed. As fun as it is, the schedule is starting to show in my face. Despite only being 34, I’ve noticed a ton of fine lines around my eyes and even around my mouth. Even worse than the fine lines is the dark circles and puffiness I have, from lack of sleep. The 3 issues combined has left me feeling self conscience. I don’t like to tan so I have to rely on makeup to try and conceal it and the wrong foundation leaves the lines looking worse and none of the foundation I’ve tried conceals puffiness. I end up with my makeup caked on and It looks awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dermatologist told me to try a product with Eyeliss and Haloxyl. I decided to give Elite Serum a try because it contains both. What a difference it has made! I look better than I have in years. The skin around my eyes is nice and smooth, no disgusting “bags” and you can’t even see any trace of darkness under my eyes. This product will definetly be going on the road with me!</li>
    <li> This product did nothing for me.  What a waste of money.  Wish I had returned it, but wanted to give it a good try.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 32 year old male and have had bags under my eyes for my entire adult life. Doctors and dermatologists have told me that I simply have thin skin but I refused it to be so. I was referred to Elite Serum from an actor friend of mine and will admit that I was reluctant to make the purchase at first. I&#x27;m so glad that she talked me into it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin looks great again and my bags are completely gone. I never thought of my eyes to be particularly puffy but can see how much they&#x27;ve been reduced after a simple application and massage with the Elite Serum. I&#x27;ve only been using it for two weeks but I imagine a long relationship ahead between me and the Elite Serum--my face looks like I&#x27;m 20 again! (before cigarettes and alcohol weighed their inevitable toll)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was beginning to just accept the aging process but now I know that it can be fought. I&#x27;ve never been a big believer of cosmetics but I&#x27;m completely sold with Elite Serum--my face speaks for itself!</li>
    <li> Product comes in a syringe like applicator. A gimmick and nothing more. No change in undereye darkness. Product is extrememly expensive. Save your money and get more sleep and stop all salt products.</li>
    <li> Now that I&#x27;m in my 30s, I did some research for the best anti-aging products on the market.&lt;br /&gt;Elite Eye Serum was at the top of my list to try, and I&#x27;m glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used cheap drug store products in the past; they pale in comparison.&lt;br /&gt;In the amount of time I&#x27;ve been using this product, I&#x27;ve noticed my skin is smoother...and even tighter.&lt;br /&gt;It does exactly what it promises! I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the end result, and will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product as a gift for my mom and it was a good idea to buy this product as a gift for her, because it was very successful so far after having tried different creams and similar products. We hope that the results will improve over time :-).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Especially her skin looks healthier and better after one month of use. I was also trying the product because sometimes I have the problem of \\&quot;tired eyes\\&quot;, with very good results.</li>
    <li> I started using Elite Serum about 3 weeks ago.  This morning, when I dropped my kids off at school, another mom told me that my skin looked great and my eyes looked \\&quot;bright\\&quot;.  She actually used the word bright.  Woo hoo!!!  For a Monday morning, that made me feel like a million bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in my early 40&#x27;s now, and have definitely noticed more lines, wrinkles and puffiness around my eyes.  I began searching for a product that would \\&quot;smooth things out a bit\\&quot;.  I wasted a lot of money on products that claimed all kinds of wonderful results, but for whatever reason, they didn&#x27;t work for me.  Then, through research on the internet, I discovered Elite Serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been so pleased with this product, mainly because it actually works!  The airless syringe dispenser is kind of fun to use, and the serum feels great on the skin under my eyes.  I&#x27;m diligent about using it everyday, and noticed improvement very quickly.  Those wrinkles are getting less and less noticeable every day!  It also helps my eyes look less puffy in the morning.  Yes, it is expensive, but I admit it: I wasn&#x27;t fond of those wrinkles that appeared under my eyes every time I laughed or smiled.  And when I think about all the money I&#x27;ve spent on disappointing products, I&#x27;m thrilled to have discovered something that lives up to its claims.  Thank you Elite Serum!!!</li>
    <li> After waking up 5 days a week at 5AM to go to work, the bags under my eyes were so baggy, you&#x27;d thought that I was selling bags. At first, I was skeptical about trying another product to reduce the dark circles and puffiness under my eyes. I was and still am glad I gave it a try. This prodcut do exactly what it says it&#x27;s going to do and more. The serum is cooling, refreshing, and I could feel it working. The applicator just glide on the skin and you wont have to worry about using too much. It was design to dispense the right amount. Use it twice daily as directed and it should last you about 60 days. Both, my husband and I, use it. I recommended it to some friends and they can&#x27;t stop talking about how well it works. It&#x27;s money well spent. Try it for yourself and see for yourself the how well it works. You will not regret it. Guarantee.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo2RQOQDEVLDWJ0]]Here is my review of the Elite Serum, after using it for a month.</li>
    <li> My wife suggested I try this as my eyes were getting really puffy.  I didn&#x27;t think that it would work, but I was surprised to see that it did!  Thanks for a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> I love this product!! I am hesitant buying products for my face and skin. I love this product so much. I have very sensitive skin but this product has never given me problems. I love that the more I use it, the better I look. My under eye circles, dark spots, and shadows seem almost diminished at this point. People actually notice a difference and ask me if I am getting more sleep! I couldn&#x27;t believe that. I recommended it to my older sister because we have the same type of sensitive skin and she loves it as well. A+</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 22 years old, yet I was waking up with dark circles under my eyes.  I tried a variety of concealers, but nothing seemed to mask the problem.  I&#x27;m so fortunate I found the Elite Eye Serum. I was shocked at how quickly I noticed results.  After just a few days, the circles disappeared and I felt like my age again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never thought one product would make such a difference, but I saw an increadible improvement with the Elite Eye Serum.  I feel confident again and my skin looks healthy.  This is more than I could ever ask for.  I recommend this product to anyone who wants to prevent and protect their skin by using one simple product.</li>
    <li> While skin care hasn&#x27;t necessarily been atop my list of concerns, I&#x27;ve always struggled with dark under eye circles. My wife has suggested different products to use from time to time, but it wasn&#x27;t until I came across the Elite Eye Serum that I finally found a product that works for me. Elite Eye Serum has faded those dark under eye circles, decreased the puffiness and really helped in rejuvenating my skin. It&#x27;s given my skin a more delicate, smooth look and feel. My wife even says I look younger.&lt;br /&gt;The syringe dispensing is efficient and convenient, too. Now that I&#x27;ve found something that addresses all of my skin concerns, I don&#x27;t have to worry about these aspects of my appearance and I can focus my time on my work and family. This product is more than completely worth it!</li>
    <li> For a long time I&#x27;ve been very nervous about going out in public because of the lines and wrinkles on my face. Because of Elite Serum my confidence has been insanely boosted and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo1KXEZ3XG26BZ4]]I received a free sample of the elite serum in exchange for reviewing it, but it should tell you something that the sample has run out and I&#x27;m still a consistent user. If you have any doubts at all, just watch to the end of the video and look at the before and after pictures, from just four days&#x27; use.&lt;br /&gt;I used to have really dark circles under my eyes, especially when I was tired, and they have gone. My crow&#x27;s feet have all but gone (45 days in) and the deep wrinkles under my eyes are much less visible now, even when I laugh or smile they&#x27;re not as pronounced as they were.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it&#x27;s expensive, but I&#x27;m a convert, because it works.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a little more than a month now and I cannot believe the difference. I have actually had friends ask if I had cosmetic surgery. Works better than any eye cream I have ever used in the past and I have tried many! Will definitely continue to buy and will recommend to all my friends. Love this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month now after seeing Dr. Oz talk about eye serums and I must say that it has really been helping me with my problem areas around my eyes.  I really like the application syringe, it makes it really use to use compared to my old products.  Elite Serum worked for me so far and I for continued results in the coming months.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a month and its not working at all, I won&#x27;t order it again, for the price I paid its ridiculous</li>
    <li> I am a guy and bought this stuff because I have crows feet bad around the eyes and it bothers me.I have bought other stuff and hoping this would be different and work and guess what,IT DIDNT!I used if for 2 weeks or longer and done nothing so I had botox done and that is the only thing that DOES WORK!Maybe for puffy eyes,i don&#x27;t know but nothing for crows feet around the eyes so don&#x27;t waste your money.Apply the 100.00 to botox that WILL WORK.</li>
    <li> great product good results can be seemed in short time good for any kind of skin, will buy more of it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this as per my girlfriends instructions.  She&#x27;s a big fan of their products and the price was great.  It must be doing something - she has great skin!</li>
    <li> I love this product! I work long days and somtimes I&#x27;m working through the night grading papers. Those late nights produced dark circles under my eyes. I started using Elite Serum and I see a huge difference in my face. It&#x27;s also easy to use! The syringe design makes it easy to apply without any mess.  The dark circles are clearing up and I feel so much more confident about my apprearance now! My skin actually feels healthier than before. I have received a few compliments at work about how clear my face looks now. THANK YOU!</li>
    <li> Just finished my first syringe and so far so good. After just several days of day and night application I am already seeing big changes to my under eye wrinkles and crows feet. I just started my 2nd syringe and am looking forward to continued improvements.</li>
    <li> Nice product... Good performance... Amazing price... My daughter liked it a lot...  even my granddaughter too like it as Eliminates Puffiness, Reduces Dark Circles.. i am planing to try it on my mother this time when i meet her!!!Of course.. my mother-in-law included..</li>
    <li> This item was first purchased by a friend of mine who used to look tired and sickly all the time. She started using the product and almost immediately her face and demeanor changed. Over the course of a few weeks she was looking alot more refreshed. She used to have bags under her eyes and wrinkles on the outside of the eyes, and now her skin was tight and the bags were gone! I wondered if she had undergone surgery and to my surprise she showed me this product. I wasn&#x27;t feeling so good about my appearance after I had caught my husband checking out some younger women one day while at the mall so I decided to give this product a try and ordered it through the company website. I started using it and after a week my husband started to notice my face was changing and mentioned how it looked like I was getting younger. He knew because of my busy schedule that I couldn&#x27;t have taken time off to have surgery behind his back so he was puzzled how it was possible that my wrinkles and dark spots under my eyes were pretty much gone. After a couple weeks I was looking 10 yrs younger. The dark spots I had were gone and the wrinkles had diminished 80-90 percent, like if I had taken a cosmetic surgery minus the expensive bills and the painful recovery. I have reordered the product and am recommending it to all my friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank You Skin Pro for your Elite Eye Serum!</li>
    <li> I purchased this serum about 2 months ago and I am really starting to see the results. I have incredibly sensitive skin, especially under my eyes, many creams or serums make my eyes sting but not this one. Recently turning 28 and having bad genetics, I have always suffered from discoloration and puffiness around my eyes, even with a great nights sleep. For the first time ever I don&#x27;t look sleep deprived and the little laugh creases I&#x27;ve had are gone. I wouldn&#x27;t think twice to recommend this to my family and friends and will probably get this for my younger sisters to use, as they suffer from the same genetic eye discoloration. Good bye expensive con clears, hello beautiful eyes!!!! In addition, the seller was extremely prompt and curious, a real pleasure to deal with.</li>
    <li> Like most, it seems that I have tried every eye serum out there. A friend of mine RAVED about Elite Eye Serum and once I noticed the quick fix around her eyes- l had to purchase for myself! Never again will I try another product. I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with the results and I have received tons of compliments on how my skin is glowing! My skin is smoother, fine lines have diminished and I am incredibly less self conscious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well worth the money!</li>
    <li> I think at this price and judging from my results, this was not the new improved version.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how this stuff works, but it&#x27;s amazing. I first bought it years ago on a promotion. Then the regular price was (I think) $70, so I stopped. I forgot about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since then I have tried many expensive eye creams and serums (Guerlain, Est&amp;eacute;e Lauder serum &amp; cream). In hindsight they do not compare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I found it on Amazon, I couldn&#x27;t believe how inexpensive it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I dispense it, rather than squirt it on to my finger, I&#x27;ll squirt it on the counter. More control, less mess.&lt;br /&gt;The directions are to rub it in. Do this, but gently of course. It&#x27;s slippery feeling, so you won&#x27;t pull your skin. As it dries/gets absorbed it does not feel sticky. Use it morning and night. You will feel the ridges in your crows feet get shallower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am never going to use anything else. My only teeny tiny complaint is that I can&#x27;t see the level of the serum because of the label. A little goes a long way, but I want to reorder before it runs out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it would probably also work great for upper lip wrinkles. I have always just put my last bit of eye cream or serum there anyway, so because it&#x27;s not a problem area for me, I can&#x27;t comment on its effectiveness there. But hey! It&#x27;s only $30! So worth trying it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using products by this company since the name was Elite Skin.  There have been times when I have tried a product that didn&#x27;t live up to my standards, but other times there are products that deliver above my expectations.  Elite Serum is one product that has been a staple in my daily routine and I haven&#x27;t found a better product for the things I look to treat (bags and puffiness.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More important than the products is the service I get from Bill, Sophia, Marcy, and everyone I have ever dealt with.  The few products from the old Elite Skin brand that weren&#x27;t up to snuff were always replaced with others.  I&#x27;m using some of the Delfogo products because this company has earned my respect and long-term business.  When I buy from an online vendor I hold them to the level of service I repeatedly get from Skin Pro.</li>
    <li> This product was a total disappointment.  It basically did nothing for me, i tried it for one month and did not notice any improvement.  I tried to return it and the manufacturer would not take it back and Amazon&#x27;s policy did not support my return either.  I do not know how the manufacturer is allowed to make all these claims and not back their product.  This was a big waste of money, I would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> With two children under 10 and a lot of extra-curricular activities, I run around a lot. In addition I also work part time and have a home and a husband who works long hours so I&#x27;m doing what I can time-wise to maintain the schedule for him as well. I&#x27;ve been noticing over the last year a lot of issues with &#x60;looking tired&#x27; and trying everything to alleviate this problem with my appearance. I know I am tired, I can&#x27;t get around that so much, but I don&#x27;t want to look like a feel. I have had some really great results with the eye serum and I can say that the folks who offer so-so reviews to the outcome have to probably look at all aspects of the reason why they have a hard time making this product work best for them. The first thing I have noticed(and this is for me), I changed out my diet and increased my water intake. Having a good foundation to work with before applying the necessary &#x60;fixes&#x27; to my skin is important. I couldn&#x27;t have the wanted results I do have without making sure I am healthy and my skin is in the best condition to take in a good product. I&#x27;m really happy because I made the investment in this product and I am having success with it. There&#x27;s nothing else to say . A painter can&#x27;t create a masterpiece without having a pristine canvas to work on. I&#x27;m happier to have made the effort to have the best skin to work with this serum. It has made all of the difference and I look better and feel better. I&#x27;m totally sold!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not Botox, that&#x27;s for sure. But, as a tired mom with a needle phobia, I can&#x27;t bring myself to do Botox. I started using it morning and night under my day and night cream and within a week I began to see results! My eyes look brighter and those horrible bags under my eyes (that are genetic - I&#x27;ve had since my 20s), have diminishing by about 30%. My crows feet look less obvious too! I also have wrinkles between my eye brows, and I use it there. It works! The fine wrinkles have diminished by about 30% as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, this will be my go-to serum until Revance&#x27;s RT001 Lateral Canthal Lines (Botox cream) hits the market, or until I can get over my fear of needles. :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been on an expedition of sorts over the years to find a product that reverses some of the signs of aging that are an inevitable consequence of sun exposure and getting older. Due to genetics, I have my fair share of puffiness and fine lines around the eyes and have tried every product imaginable.  It was only until I tried Elite Serum that I finally found a product where you actually see the signs of aging reversed in a matter of a few days.  My dark circles evaporated and my crows feet were gone.  There are so many products on the market that promise exceptional results, but Elite Serum delivers the goods.  Other products that I have used in the past merely mask blemishes, but Elite Serum actually works to regenerate your skin around your problem spots.  Friends and family immediately noticed the results:  I was often asked if I had done extensive spa and facial treatments and told that I looked less stressed.  The packaging and application instructions are stellar and easy to use:  just apply to the area of need and - voila - you are well on your way to a more youthful appearance and maybe getting carded the next time you order a cocktail at the bar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other members of my family with different skin compositions are now using Elite Serum as well as a result of my mini-transformation.  Elite Serum is not the fountain of youth that Ponce de Leon was after, but it comes pretty close.....</li>
    <li> Since I was disappointed by a few other cosmetic products that I tried before, I had my doubts when I started using this one. So what a relief it was when I looked in the mirror a few weeks later to see that I finally had an anti-aging product that works! Elite Serum made my skin look much smoother, and took away the puffiness around my eyes that had always made me look fatigued. Now, at last, I look as lively and young as I feel.</li>
    <li> From the moment I started using Elite-Eye-Serum, I felt like I saw an immediate difference.  My skin felt rejuvenated and replenished. Suddenly, I developed a new glow.  Within two weeks I started receiving so many compliments.  Everyone noticed a difference in my skin.  Friends and family said and still say I look younger and more attractive.  I am really satisfied with the results.  At first I was a little skeptical, but boy was I wrong.  Elite-Eye-Serum goes a long way.  It worked for me and I know that it will work for you.  I am so grateful for this fabulous product.</li>
    <li> I have used two tubes and have not seen any improvement in dark circles or wrinkles. In fact, I think my eyes are more droopy than before.</li>
    <li> I consider myself to be a wise consumer. One who understands that every product we see, both large and small is simply the end result of a larger marketing scheme.  But after a growing concern about the pronounced circles under my own eyes, I figured I&#x27;d give Elite Serum a trail period. I can honestly share that it has been one of the better investments I have made in a very long time. A little over one month of usage and my circles are considerably dulled almost to the point of non-existence. As a woman with dark skin, finding effective products to counter-act dark circles can be very challenging. But the Elite Serum manages to do just that. Several friends and co-workers, who knew nothing about me using the eye serum, have commented on the noticeable difference in my face.  Aside from being good for my ego, their compliments also served to validate the products claims. The quick application each day and the end result of virtually no circles or puffiness, make this product well worth the investment.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had very dark circles (I use DermaBlend as a concealer). It&#x27;s mostly hereditary and the fact that I don&#x27;t sleep well either doesn&#x27;t help. Unfortunately, Elite Serum has not helped much with my dark circles BUT it has made the skin around my eyes look tighter and my concealer does go on a lot smoother. The tube seems small but you really only need a very small amount. I use one pump for both eyes and still have some left over that I rub on my forehead to smooth out any forehead lines. It works! So thumbs up for lines and firmness, not so much for my dark circles.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a month now and I must say I am extremely happy about it. I am 26 and I had really bad dark circles dont remember since when :( .. I had tried all good products (most reviewed) and recommended by Sephora etc, but nothing helped. Finally got to know about elite serum and thought to give it a try.. though this was my last try and its expensive !! I started seeing results after a week itself.. I apply it religiously twice a day. Although my dark circles arent gone comepletely but can say it has diminished by 80%. I am half the syringe in a month and think rest of the tube will go for 1-1.5 months. I am definitely sticking to this product forever and recommend it to anyone who has been tired of their dark circles. If it works for me, will definitely work for anyone else :D Good luck !</li>
    <li> Rubbish. And this sits on top of your skin. I would rub my skin hours later and this stuff would still be sitting on top. I saw zero difference in my skin and i used it religiously and finished the whole tube.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo1FA9BB57WETVU]]I have a whole host of skin issues, but let me say puffy eyes are the BANE of my existence. Seriously, no matter what I did I couldn&#x27;t reduce the puffiness under my eyes. I get a lot of sleep and drink lots of water so I was genuinely perplexed. Anyway, my doctor recommended this Elite Serum. In the first few days I noticed a small reduction in puffiness. Now the puffiness is essentially gone. This is the best!</li>
    <li> At the suggestion of a friend I began to look around for this miracle cure. Like a good teacher I did my homework, looked up all the details on Elite Serum I could find. After all, if there are side effects I wanna know before my eyes turn blue and my urine orange. But with Elite Serum, that wasn&#x27;t the case.&lt;br /&gt;The basics are Peptides and Moisturizer. Not all that complex a system and you know what they say about Chemistry, less is sometimes more. The less complicated a formula is usually the more stable and better it works.  Even more in depth the peptides are the chemicals, that makes the eyes less puffy, the lines finer, the wrinkles seemly gone and all the other wonderful effects of this product without the harsh nastiness of those botox injections. I don&#x27;t wanna put anything under my skin if I can help it. Elite Serums products definitely keep me from having to do that. And the Moisturizer keep my skin healthy and feeling firm.  I noticed a difference within the first week, my students noticed within a. I had teenage girls coming up to me asking me how to get the puffiness out from under THEIR eyes!</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo2KXELA76O75CW]]</li>
    <li> lines around eyes are diminished &amp; area is more hydrated &amp; not dull.  tried many OTC products &amp; none lasted long or just created glimmer to deceive for awhile.  more expensive &amp; that&#x27;s why the hesitation at first.  been using for over a year &amp; WOW.  I do use a little eye cream as extra hydration for the cold weather. use around areas if mouth as well.  lose years &amp; feel good about it! just takes a little getting used to the syringe thing though! oh, I am over 40, but eyes don&#x27;t tell!</li>
    <li> i used this product 3 days and it seemed suitable for my skin.  However I also received the Perricone product below&lt;br /&gt;and within 2 days I had developed a rash? over my entire face and even my ears and neckline....so I am not certain if it was one or both products that created this very bothersome reaction..  In the subsequent 6 days this is now finally subsiding. thank goodness.  I will not use any more of either product  as I now know I am allergic to them.  I have used over the years many products.and have never had any reactions such as this.  sorry....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m only 33 so, not old, but the wrinkles around my eyes are a huge source of frustration and anxiety for me (from a lifetime of too much sun, unfortunately). I&#x27;ve tried every product at the pharmacy to smooth out the crinkly skin. I&#x27;m so self-conscious about it I was stopping myself from smiling or laughing when I&#x27;d talk to people up close (ridiculous, I know). Elite Serum is the first thing that has ever actually made a real difference. My skin is tighter, smoother, and plumper. As if that weren&#x27;t enough, Elite Serum has dramatically improved my dark circles and puffiness. My eyes look like they did thirteen years ago! But the most important thing to me is that I can stop worrying about the wrinkles. I just feel so much more confident. I never write reviews about products, but I&#x27;ve just struggled so much to find an eye product that actually really works. I hope I might save other people the frustration and expense of trying a million different things that don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> In order for me to take the time to write a review about a product I&#x27;ve used, it&#x27;s got to be a product that really wowed me.  Elite Serum definitely has that wow factor.  I felt compelled to share with others my positive experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have wrinkles yet, but noticeable fine lines and under eye puffiness has always been an issue.  I set out for a product that would eliminate my ridiculously long am and pm skin care ritual of multiple creams and serums, each designed for a specific area of the face, followed by a moisturizer, etc.  Elite Serum is the total package.  It contains peptides that target all of the issues that I suffer from, allowing me to eliminate 2 products altogether.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like most about Elite Serum is the consistency of the serum.  It&#x27;s a formula that is very light.  It doesn&#x27;t leave any greasy residue or feel sticky.  It absorbs really fast and it&#x27;s the kind of product you can actually apply makeup over.  It won&#x27;t flake or cause your skin to peel like some products I will.  I don&#x27;t need a separate moisturizer, but for those that do, I read that it&#x27;s perfectly safe to use a moisturizer with it and it won&#x27;t effect the Elite Serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as what it&#x27;s done to improve the area around my eyes, it has smoothed lines and created a noticeable difference in my dark circles.  I almost feel confident enough to leave the house without concealer.  Maybe after another month of treatment!</li>
    <li> I kiked this product when I first bought it, but I have found something that works better. It DOES take the swelling and bags from under ones eyes, but it leaves a whitish residue..</li>
    <li> This was a waste of money.  It does nothing.  I see know change in my eyes after many, many uses and it comes out of the tube so fast it shoots across the room and I lose half of it.  At this price, you can&#x27;t afford to lose it.  I hate when companies write all these descriptions like, \\&quot;Better than Botox.\\&quot;  Really?  This is false advertising.</li>
    <li> I bought this after my coworker was raving how great this eye serum was even though it was expensive I had to try it for myself. I been searching for the best eye cream/serum for the longest time so I thought I might as well try this one too. I used it for about 2 weeks and first application, I felt a lift on my eyelids due to the tightest it has after the application dries. Not much improvement on moisturizing or depuffing my eyes so other than lifting temporary effect, doesn&#x27;t do anything for me. After using it for 2 weeks, I noticed my eyes were dried than not using it at all. Also, the packing works like a syringe so it waste more of the product every time you close or finish using the product.</li>
    <li> I purchased Elite eye serum from the manufacturer direct, not from Amazon (tho I have bought a number of things from Amazon this year and find the product reviews so helpful in guiding my purchases).  I did read some of the reviews for Elite only out of curiousity, as I personally, am finding the product quite helpful.  So I wanted to chime in with my two cents, and wanted to start out by saying I am in no way affiliated with Elite or the industry in any way.  In fact, I live in China right now, but that&#x27;s a whole other story....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways....this product will not turn the clock back 20 years and anyone expecting that kind of result from any product will be very disappointed.  I bought Elite because my eye lids were SO droopy, I looked 90, not 43.  I used it twice a day for the first syringe, and in 6 weeks, noticed a great improvement with the firmness of my eye lids.  I also notice fewer fine lines around my eyes (smile lines).  I don&#x27;t find the product moisturizing, so I use eye cream about 15 mins after applying the serum.  My own personal guideline on layering products is to give each product about 15 mins on the skin before adding another layer of something else.  And always layer on sunscreen!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think if you have realistic expectations about this product, you will be very pleased.</li>
    <li> As I get older, the bags under my eyes seem to look fuller.  During the allergy season, my 89 year old father used to ask me when I was leaving on vacation...because my bags were packed!  I tried this product because nothing else seemed to help.  My bags aren&#x27;t gone, but they are considerably less puffy than they used to be using Estee Lauder&#x27;s Advanced Eye Repair. I like the ease of the syringe applicator.  The only problem I have had is applying makeup after using the serum.  The serum seems to roll off like dry skin when you blend liquid makeup into your skin.  If you just pat the makeup, it does ok.</li>
    <li> I have always been skeptical of anti-aging serums and creams, but I finally gave in and tried Elite Serum after a friend&#x27;s recommendation. It is fantastic. After a few months of use, I&#x27;ve seen a noticeable change. I&#x27;ve always tried to mask the dark circles under my eyes with makeup, but since using this product they&#x27;re all but gone - I look fresh and well rested even when I&#x27;m not. The fine lines under my eyes have also significantly diminished. More importantly, I&#x27;ve received unsolicited compliments from friends and coworkers recently that I look \\&quot;brighter\\&quot; and \\&quot;younger.\\&quot; This product is my best kept secret.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum absorbs quickly, moisturizes well, and importantly, it LASTS - a little goes a long way. It&#x27;s become part of my routine and is a great investment. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I bought this product about half a year ago. It was only last month I started to use it as I have been staying up late every night. I have been applying the serum religiously every day and night. Now I can see that my under eye bags are gone. Even my friends &amp; family noticed the difference in my complexion. I am happy and satisfied with the result. Thank you, Elite Serum.</li>
    <li> Title:  No more expression lines&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am of an age when I start to worry about the fine lines around my eyes and the little expression lines that appear when I smile. I have tried other products sold in department stores and from cosmeticians, along with an endless list of drug store products and nothing seems to work.  Elite Serum is the first product that I notice a REAL difference with.. After 10 days, I started to notice a visible difference. After 30 days friends and relatives asked me if I&#x27;d had some sort of facial peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trick to maintaining the product&#x27;s effectiveness is keeping the white safety tip on the end of the product and locking the serum airtight. The applicator syringe lets you hone in on the exact problem areas without wasting any of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;ve been waiting for a product like this because I hate anything to do with needles. Elite Serum is a better alternative than Botox in every way, especially in price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B006E3STSM Elite Serum - Defend. Protect. Rejuvenate.]]</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been on the search for several years for an eye cream or eye serum that can help reduce or eliminate the darkness under my eyes.  I developed those circles under my eyes when I was in my early 20&#x27;s during my college years and as I have aged they have gotten even darker.  I was tired of the raccoon eyes and the Elite Serum didn&#x27;t remove all of the darkness under my eyes but what it did was reduce the coloring which I greatly appreciate. It makes applying cosmetic makeup easier and matching up the color.</li>
    <li> I have used elite serum for 2 months and I see no difference. It did help soften the fine lines but it did nothing for my dark circles. It actually made them look worse and it made my eyes look droopy. The more I used it the worse my dark circles got.  So I stopped using it and noticed that my fine lines were back and looked worse than before and my darks circles were actually better. It seems like it made my eye area worse and I wish I never used it.  If you are someone with no dark circles and trying to get rid of a few fine lines its great for you because it will soften fine lines NOT wrinkles.  It&#x27;s not worth the money and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s for everyone.  I think they only post great reviews on the actual website and other skin product websites because amazon is the only place I actually see some truthful reviews.  I have to say that garnier nutritioniste skin Renew anti- puff eye roller is the best for puffy and under eye circles. Going back to that with an eye cream that moisturizes the eye area because it seems like there are no creams or serums that can permanently get rid of your wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I actually don&#x27;t see any difference in my skin since I have been using it.  I don&#x27;t like to complain, but if I could, I would return it.  It was kind of expensive for a product that has done nothing for me. Sorry, I wish I could say better things about it.....</li>
    <li> I got this serum on Groupon (I&#x27;d never pay close to $100.00 for face cream, but that&#x27;s just me.).  They have it on again and I got more tonight.  It&#x27;s not miraculous but it is pretty darn good.  I&#x27;m 67 and use it on laugh lines, etc., as well.  There is a noticeable difference even though I&#x27;m too lazy to use it at night as recommended.  For me, it&#x27;s enough just to use it in the morning.  If you can get it at a reasonable price (I paid $27), go for it.  It&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do agree that some of the reviews sound like plants -- but not all.  And not this one.</li>
    <li> Bottom line... this stuff works.  I&#x27;ve been an avid golfer, swimmer and generally outdoors-y dude for a long time.  Never thought twice about taking care of my skin.  It wasn&#x27;t until my wife started making fun of my crow&#x27;s feet (very funny, I know) did I realize that I&#x27;d gotten some substantial sun damage over the years.  I actually started to get a little self-conscious so I began looking for remedies.  Going the botox route seemed a little extreme for me, so when my wife&#x27;s friend suggested this, I said &#x60;why not&#x27;.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks and my lines are disappearing and my skin just looks and feels tighter and clearer.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Using this product as directed, but since its only been two weeks, there has not been much change.  Will update at 30 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, did not work for me, no visible changes.</li>
    <li> Like lots of my friends, I&#x27;d been testing eye creams and visiting my dermatologist more and more frequently to get rid of the puffy eyes, dark circles, and wrinkles that come with getting older.  We work out, color our hair, eat right.  But, if we have puffy eyes and wrinkles, we can look ten years older instead of ten years younger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About six months ago, I was having lunch with a friend I hadn&#x27;t seen in a couple months.  I couldn&#x27;t believe how much younger she looked.  I asked her for the name of her cosmetic surgeon.  She told me she had heard about this amazing eye serum called Elite Serum and told me I had to try it.  I did a little research before ordering and whipped out my credit card.  I read that Elite Serum has a high concentration of peptides for an over the counter product that would reduce my undereye circles and those little wrinkles we get around our eyes.  When my order arrived, I couldn&#x27;t wait to get started. Twice a day, I applied the serum around my eye socket.  Instead of dipping my finger into a jar of cream or touching the applicator, which I know can introduce bacteria into cream or lotion, I applied this serum with the syringe applicator. I was able to use far less than expensive creams I bought at the makeup counter or at my doctor&#x27;s office.  The applicator even had a locking mechanism so it wouldn&#x27;t drip or get contaminated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed a difference after a few days...even though the label said it may take a month and a half.  After a month or so, the difference was noticeable.  My dark circles went away.  I didn&#x27;t have those fine lines, even when I looked in the rear view mirror.  I&#x27;d recommend Elite Serum to anyone who would rather use an at home serum instead of spending time in the dermatologists or medispa getting Botox or other injectibles.  It works.</li>
    <li> I never thought in a million years at 25 years old I would have to worry about crow&#x27;s feet!  My mom has crow&#x27;s feet and face wrinkles pretty bad, but she is twice my age so that makes sense.  I started becoming self-conscious in taking photos because it was incredibly noticeable around my eyes.  I wasn&#x27;t sure what to do and was trying over-the-counter creams and various beauty products, but nothing was giving me the results I was looking for.  When I came across this product, Elite Serum, I was hesitant at first, but after further review and research I decided to give it try.  I bought it on Amazon and had complete faith and belief that once the product was in my hands it was going to work.  I have been using the product for 3 weeks now and I love it!  It feels great on my skin and I am definitely noticing results.  What I love about the product is that even though it is higher in cost, it is efficient and I definitely feel as though I am getting my money&#x27;s worth.  With it being a small tube you would think that it would run out fast, but it doesn&#x27;t - I still have another month or so worth of usage.  If you are looking for a quality product with the alternative to botox or other creams, I highly recommend Elite Serum.  BELIEVE in the product and you will SEE results!</li>
    <li> I typically don&#x27;t write reviews for items I purchase on Amazon, simply because I don&#x27;t have the time. But I had to take at least a couple minutes to rave about this seemingly (but totally not) overpriced product. After reading the other positive reviews I decided to try this out - and it&#x27;s honestly unbelievable. I work in the restaurant industry, and all of my regular customers almost immediately began commenting on how \\&quot;refreshed\\&quot; and \\&quot;young\\&quot; I looked. Some female regulars (I live in LA so it&#x27;s not taboo to discuss such things) asked what \\&quot;my secret\\&quot; was. I feel like this company should start paying me for all of the business I&#x27;ve undoubtedly given them. But I do give praise when praise is due. For the results, the price is extremely reasonable. I&#x27;m completely satisfied and would recommend this product to anyone looking for a cheap alternative to Botox.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s like magic, I can&#x27;t imagine my life without it! I went from feeling ugly, my eyes always puffy, looking like I never slept when I would sleep 8-10 hours a night to feeling like a new person, eyes have brightened up, don&#x27;t look puffy and I feel like I did when I was in my early 20&#x27;s! (I&#x27;m 31) I have three of these to keep me going for a while but whenever the price goes down, I keep buying more! Highly highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Have used product religiously for 2 months and DO NOT notice any difference around the eyes.  After patting around the eyes, there is always some serum left so I placed it around the lines on my&lt;br /&gt;mouth.  No difference there either.  Fairly expensive for no results.  Am I the only one who didn&#x27;t have results?</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have twenty words for this product.  I&#x27;m doing tests on different products targeted at the aging baby boomers and most of them are trash at a very high&lt;br /&gt;cost.  This one is no different.</li>
    <li> No noticeable change.  Serum is light and feels refreshing to apply. Applicator dispenses just the right amount so there is no waste.</li>
    <li> I am an older woman (over 60) who is very concerned about her looks and I take very good care of my skin.  This product does what it says it will do.  The skin under my eyes has smoothed out and looks great.  I have stopped wearing my glasses, that I use to wear to hide my bags.  NO more bags!&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with the product and it is worth the price.</li>
    <li> i used this product for over 1 year, and i am so upset, i wasted my money because this thing never worked.</li>
    <li> I am truly amazed at how well this product has helped me.As the years passed the lines around my eyes and the puffiness of my eyes when I woke up was only getting worse.I decided to purchase this as the reviews were great and I really needed the help.My lines around my eyes have gotten so much smoother,my skin is radiant and the eye puffiness in the morning are practically gone.I can honestly say that I look younger and feel so much better about myself.&lt;br /&gt;Also the syringe applicator has made this so easy to apply with no mess.&lt;br /&gt;This is the only product that I have used that I have really seen results and would recommend to all of my friends and family.GREAT PRODUCT AND RESULTS!!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m about to turn 29 and have inevitably noticed more fine lines and darker circles (thanks, work!) around and under my eyes. I&#x27;ve tried many eye creams and moisturizers, but I haven&#x27;t been too impressed with the majority of them. Luckily, I stumbled upon this product, read the great reviews, researched the ingredients, and finally, made the purchase. I have not been disappointed! My fine lines are greatly diminished, and those dark circles are much improved. My whole eye area just looks rejuvenated and moisturized. From the actual product to the unique packaging, I love everything about this eye cream. I no longer need to scour the shelves of department stores trying to discover the next best thing; I&#x27;m convinced I already found it.</li>
    <li> I have a nutrition background, and I am into holistic health. Seaweeds are so essential in fighting off free radicals, which speed the aging process... but I had never seen them in a facial product before. So when I read that this product contained red &amp; green seaweed extract, I was interested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results were very good! After 30 days of using the product consistently, the skin under my eyes definitely looked firmer, which gave me a younger appearance. I would suggest that if you try this, make sure to use it faithfully - like anything else, you can&#x27;t use it here and there and expect great results.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful. I tried others and gave me acne. This one is very soft and made my skin look awsome. I recommended 100 %</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always skeptical of new skin products. They all claim to be the fountain of youth, but this one truly is! Elite eye serum has made me look and feel years younger. It has worked wonders on my wrinkles and the dark circles under my eyes. Also, the puffiness around my eyes, especially in the morning is virtually non existent since using this product. You truly only need to use a small drop, so the product lasts. It is so well worth the price, I can&#x27;t imagine anyone being disappointed with this product. I truly can not convey how happy I am with this product. It has made me look younger and therefore has boosted my confidence so much. This product comes highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for about three weeks, and am happy with what I&#x27;m seeing- results! Elite Serum has already helped with puffy eyes, darkness in the corners, uneven skin tone, fine lines, and given me an overall &#x27;brighter&#x27;, more awake look. Twice a day, a little goes a long way! - Ellen DuBois</li>
    <li> I have now purchased my 3rd order of this product.  I am so happy with the effect.I am one of those women who stood in front of the women&#x27;s face lotion aisle for hours reading the back of the package and trying to figure out which one was really the best.  Every product out there claims to be \\&quot;the best\\&quot;.  I am proud to say I no longer stand in the aisle at my local drug store looking dazed and confused.  I have finally found a product that I love because it works. Elite Eye Serum is genuinely The Best. The product claims to \\&quot;reduce dark circles, puffiness, fine lines and crows feet\\&quot;. At this time I do not have issues with dark circles, but I have the rest.  At one point in time I actually used 3 different products to address these issues, causing a major allergic reaction. Elite Serum is like no other eye product I have ever used.  It is not sticky or greasy. It did not cause itching or any irritaion.  I actually felt better from the first use. I actually noticed a reduction in puffiness in the first few days and my fine lines and crows feet decreasing starting the first week.  I tell everyone I know about this prduct.  It is simply amazing.  This is a 5 star product that every women must try.</li>
    <li> If only I could give it a perfect 10!! Elite Serum is an amazing blend of topicals and a great, much cheaper alternative to Botox - especially if you&#x27;re afraid of needles. When it comes to treating puffiness, crows feet, or bloodshot, red eyes - Elite Serum in its syringe container is the one easy fix! After a matter of nights you notice a difference just looking in the mirror - and I mean differences you feel too. I never thought Elite could make me this rested - I&#x27;ve never needed much sleep but with this, I can wake up after the application looking great and feeling great - nothing inspires more confidence in a salesman than being bright eyed and ready to start your day! Elite Serum&#x27;s helped keep my eyes open and my sales closed! Thanks, Elite!!</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me by a friend who had great results from it. I had been searching for a product that would help minimize the dark circles and puffiness around my eyes and THIS IS IT! I am thoroughly pleased with this product and the results have exceeded my expectations.  It is really easy to use and convenient to store. I am no longer contemplating plastic surgery now that I have used this Elite Serum. THIS IS GREAT!!!!</li>
    <li> It takes a lot for me to write an Amazon review - so just the fact that I&#x27;m trying means Elite Serum deserves all five stars! The alternative to Botox developed by Elite is tons more safe and to apply! Loaded with antioxidants, this product helps your skin breathe easy - taking away all your wrinkles and dark circles - giving the body a natural cure to reverse aging. You instantly feel better and see a world of difference in just a month! You even feel as young as you look! Just 30 days and all your friends will be asking what&#x27;s your secret? Instead of that feeling of faking your age, putting chemicals into your skin, Elite makes you feel like you&#x27;re simply giving yourself the nutrients and vitamins you truly deserve. Do it for yourself today and thank Elite!</li>
    <li> The old saying \\&quot;youth is wasted on the young\\&quot; is definitely true in my case.  I had terrific skin in my 20s and 30s, but I never stopped to think about it or appreciate it.  Now that I&#x27;m a little older, I thought those days were gone and I&#x27;d never be able to get rid of the lines and wrinkles all around my eyes.  No product I tried ever worked and I&#x27;m way too anxiety ridden to go to a plastic surgeon.  But, at a recent girls&#x27; night out with friends, I noticed one of the ladies was looking amazing.  I asked if she was using new makeup, and she said it was all because of Elite Serum.  Needless to say, I jumped on the bandwagon and bought some the next day.  This unbelievable product has improved the skin around my eye area to the point that my husband--who never notices anything--says I look 10 years younger.  I am now a devoted fan.</li>
    <li> So ... I have read the negative reviews on Elit Serum after I purchased the item on their website and received it yesterday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I left a message in order to return on the \\&quot;Live Help\\&quot; and Facebook I received answer just after I was talking to some \\&quot;Center Call\\&quot; in the next morning, found out that costume serves do not have direct phone number.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the answer by email - \\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Following a reasonable evaluation period, if visible results are not on par with your highest expectations, please do not hesitate to contact customer service.

    <li> A friend actually gave me this, because she has been using it for a few months and I&#x27;ve been commenting on how good she looks. So SkinPro offered a 2 for 1 sale and she graciously gave me one to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the effect that this has had on my eyes, it feels very luxurious and fills wrinkles instantly. It also brightens, soothes, hydrates, reduces the bags and dark circles under my eyes. It&#x27;s simply divine.</li>
    <li> This product has honestly changed my life. There are so many different brands and products out there that claim to do all kinds of wonderful stuff, but what makes the Elite Serum special is that it actually works. I&#x27;ve always been self-conscious about the bags under my eyes and, as I have gotten older, my issues with this area have only increased. After deciding to finally do something about it, I was disheartened to find that all the products I had seen advertised did not lead to any noticeable improvement whatsoever. I decided to look for something that had a good customer rating and I expanded my price range a bit, turns out it was worth it. Like many other people, I saw great results after using this product for only a short time, and my skin continued to improve and improve. Now I am very happy with the results and feel so much better about my skin and my eyes. Not only do I use it to smooth out wrinkles, I use it if I wake up with bags under my eyes or my skin is quite puffy, and it works a treat!&lt;br /&gt;With this product you are paying for the best technology and the best results, so I would say it is a worthwhile investment and the only thing I use now to improve my skin. I urge anyone with similar issues to mine to do the same.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo2R4VS1LYYWNZI]]The Elite Serum is a doctor recommended alternative to botox injections. It definitely works great and fast! It&#x27;s easy to use and affordable. It has helped to reduce my dark spots and puffiness as well as make my skin glow and I look so much younger and healthier because of it. I would recommend this product to anyone that is thinking of getting botox. Try this instead !</li>
    <li> I bought into the hype and purchased this product from skin pro.  Unfortunately, it dried out my fragile, sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;I called the company to arrange for a return and was given the run around.  I got a call back from a man, who obviously had a television on in the background, who kept telling me that they would give me a different product.  I repeatedly explained that I did not want another product, but simply a refund.  He repeatedly told me that I could not get a refund, only an exchange.&lt;br /&gt;What kind of company does this?  It sounds like a huge scam and they are luring in unsuspecting people.  Beware.</li>
    <li> I am using it faithfully, but still awaiting the &amp;#34;amazing results&amp;#34; that product promises.  I will continue to use morning and night..</li>
    <li> I started using Elite Serum a little over three months ago. I began noticing small wrinkles around my eyes, and my mom even made a comment about me getting crows feet at the corners. I considered Botox injections, but it&#x27;s costly and short term so I wanted to look into alternative options before going that route. I don&#x27;t like the idea of injecting chemicals of any kind, but certainly not around my eyes. So after looking around and reading some reviews, I decided to try Elite Serum. I started noticing a difference after only two weeks. My eyes weren&#x27;t as puffy in the mornings and the skin seemed tighter and more rejuvenated. I noticed the dark circles weren&#x27;t as prevalent and my eyes didn&#x27;t have that heavy, puffy feeling that makes you look tired. After a month or so, the lines started getting more faint and the crows feet were beginning to recede. Some people at work even made comments about me looking well rested and brighter. I&#x27;m so glad I found Elite Serum and didn&#x27;t opt for injections. All it takes is a a few dabs twice a day and you&#x27;ll see a noticeable difference. If you&#x27;re considering Botox, or using other creams or serums that don&#x27;t seem to be working, try Elite Serum for a few weeks. I think you&#x27;ll see the same results I did and you&#x27;ll be happier with your appearance. Good luck!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical of this product at first. I have dark circles and puffy eyes more often than not. Botox isn&#x27;t something I want to consider for a variety of reasons. Which leaves me with a seemingly endless array of products to sift through.  I ordered this, wondering if I&#x27;d, yet again, paid for another product that doesn&#x27;t work. Thankfully, this one was well worth the cost. I noticed almost immediate results, as did other people. I already ordered more so I&#x27;m never stuck without it. It makes all the fine lines (crows feet) disappear.  My skin looks and feels smoother and younger.  I want to keep this as \\&quot;my little secret\\&quot; but it&#x27;s too wonderful to not share it. Who would have thought a botox alternative could be so easy and painless.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying, I was wary to buy this to begin with. So many products out there, I&#x27;m forever the skeptic.  Not to mention the price is worth taking a minute or two to research. What finally sold me, were the reviews, I wanted what others experienced.  So glad I did. I have been plagued by dark circles since my early 20s and have tried many things, but after just a month of use with this product they seem lighter.  My Fiance tells me I look well-rested now, bright eyed (hence the title).  I have the beginning of wrinkles around my eyes that have softened but am looking forward to greater improvement with continued use.  For me, getting rid of my dark circles is enough to make me a life long customer.</li>
    <li> I have been using for about 3-4 weeks and think I notice a significant difference in the puffiness around my eyes.  I&#x27;m 60.  A young sixty but have had puffy eyes off and on for several years.  I thought I looked awful, started using this product and I see a definite improvement.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a product that works for dark circles and fine lines and this product absolutely works for my skin. My skin has never felt so much better and smoother since I&#x27;ve been using the elite serum. It made my skin look younger than most of my friends who don&#x27;t use serum on their skin. The serum has eliminated crows feet and puffiness underneath my eyes. I liked the fact that the serum goes on my skin very smoothly and I also like that the product doesn&#x27;t feel very heavy on my skin as well. I would recommend anyone to try the elite serum that wants to see results like I have seen.</li>
