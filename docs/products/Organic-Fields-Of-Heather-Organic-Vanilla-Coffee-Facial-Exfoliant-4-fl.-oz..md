<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I just went to reorder this product and am very disappointed that it is currently unavailable. I bought this on a whim because it sounded interesting, and was very reasonably priced. It is an amazing product that leaves your skin smoother and softer after just one use! It doesn&#x27;t dry your face out like many other exfoliating scrubs, and it smells amazing to boot!</li>
    <li> Received this as a gift.  Smells like coffee and does a decent job exfoliating my face. Doesn&#x27;t cause redness and i have sensative skin. The reason for the low rating is that my jar came unsealed.  It makes me feel uneasy getting all natural products that aren&#x27;t sealed properly since these kind of things are more prone to going bad.</li>
    <li> I just received this product. While I just sampled it on my hands, and my skin feels very smooth, they smell exactly like coffee&lt;br /&gt;and nothing else. I really dislike the way it smells. I love coffee, but don&#x27;t want to smell like it.</li>
    <li> Its a awesome product with natural oil and I use it sometime on all over my body.  It makes my body smooth and not dry.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like it as a facial scrub, but it&#x27;s pretty nice as a body scrub. It&#x27;s too messy to use at the sink.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this scrub .Many reasons I love this first it&#x27;s organic that&#x27;s a huge plus,the scent is great in the morning for waking up my senses and I love how this scrub leaves my face baby soft and with a radiant  shine.Has also demenish  some of the dark circles under my eyes ,they have become less noticeable. I use this every morning along with the face lotion and my face is looking much more healthier.I ordered another after I first received this in the mail because I was very impressed. I have used other Coffee Scubs that are natural and nothing compares to this .I will keep ordering because this is by far the best I have ever used.The price is beyond reasonable I would pay more if price went up that&#x27;s how well this works.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product. I use it as a mask and then a scrub. I usually try to do it before I get in the shower since it can be messy when you rinse it off. It smells wonderful, and it makes your skin feel so smooth. Coffee is a stimulant and kind of firms up your skin. You can use it all over your body by the way. When I use it once a week, people notice and compliment me on my complexion. I&#x27;m over 40, so it&#x27;s nice to hear that.</li>
    <li> This is my first review on Amazon or.. on the web ever.. but I absolutely had to.. this is literally a JAR OF GOLD! I can&#x27;t say enough about this product.. I try to only use things for my face that I can eat.. that are organic.. this reduced my acne, cleaned my face.. and for $3 this is my new favorite product.. it looks very small at first but a little def goes a long way.. I would pay $20 for it tbh and i&#x27;m a broke college student...</li>
    <li> At first, this was a miracle scrub. It smelled so good, it left my skin silky soft wherever I used it. However it is in fact made of coffee and is a HUGE MESS to clean up, even while washing it off in the shower. Coffee everywhere! Worse, it started breaking me out. Bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rarely ever get acne. I have dry, sensitive skin and this did good for smoothing out my dry spots. But it&#x27;s not worth the ugly, nearly cystic acne it gave me on my forehead. It still hasn&#x27;t gone away. I think it might have been all the oils. It was horrific. Will never buy again. Terrified to try any other products from this brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two stars only because I&#x27;m suspicious my oily acne prone family might have dipped their fingers into it, making it somewhat my fault. But the packaging is bad anyway. It needs to be in a squirt bottle like St. Ives scrub, with a WATERPROOF label, please. The paper decay was gross.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! I use it daily! I went from having mild acne to soft and clear skin!</li>
    <li> Good buy for the money, though the container started leaking from the bottom after having it a couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> This stuff is wonderful!  I can&#x27;t rave about it enough! My 17 year old had some acne...not horrible, but enough that it needed some type treatment.  He also has eczema, so very dry areas too.  He uses this every night.  It&#x27;s gentle yet powerful.  Any pimples that are forming are brought to the surface by morning so when he washes his face they just wash right off.  It&#x27;s truly amazing!  Bonus....it smells just like coffee.  Yum!  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This is GREAT all natural product. I love the ingredient list &amp; smell. Feels like a spa product. It works well at exfoliating without drying out your skin probably due to the nourishing natural oils included. I have pretty normal skin and this has not broken me out.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it kind of hurts, the coffee grounds are large and hard, so you have to be extra gentle when rubbing it onto your skin. But since the ingredients &amp; smell is so nice it makes up for any slight discomfort.</li>
    <li> The stuff is great but you have to use it quickly otherwise it grows mold. It needs to say something about refrigerating or exp date.</li>
    <li> Love this scrub. I try to make my own at home but they never come out as nice as this. It arrived a little messy (maybe need different jars with better lids) but it didn&#x27;t effect the product. So bummed that I can&#x27;t order more now!</li>
    <li> I took a chance on this and I am sooo glad that I did!  The smell is great!  I don&#x27;t drink coffee, but I love the smell.  My skin is so soft after using it and it takes off my makeup really well.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now and noticed that my skin is soft all day long.  Usually it would feel dry and tight by the end of the day.  Also, it seems like it&#x27;s going to last for a long time because after a week, the jar looks like I haven&#x27;t used any of it.  Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> The coffee is finely ground and I love the vanilla/coffee smell. A little (1/16 tsp) does my face/neck.  I love the minimal ingredients and how long a jar of this lasts.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this. She said she smells like a mocha!. She also says it works just as well as expensive over prices stuff and will buy again</li>
    <li> smells very strong,  but made my face soft and smooth</li>
    <li> I used this for the first time thismorning. Although it is small, you do not need a lot at all to do your face. The skin on my face is soft to begin with. With that said,...it feels even softer. My face also feels very refreshed. It feels great ! It certainly is something that I would &amp; will  purchase again in the future. I am thankful that I purchased (2) at the same time !!! Try it !!!</li>
    <li> Best face scrub EVER, I can&#x27;t stress it enough. I will never use anything but this. I have VERY sensitive skin. Almost everything makes my face upset. But this doesn&#x27;t, it is so effective - yet the ingredients are so gentle. Thank you Heather for such an amazing product!!!</li>
    <li> I love this. Best scent ever and it makes my face feel and look so fresh.</li>
    <li> I did not know what to think of this coffee facial organic exfoliation, feels like you just made coffee grounds and add them to oil. I will not know what results I will get till a I have used it a few times! I thought I would try it, I love the vanilla coffee smell. Thanks for organic products!</li>
    <li> Love it my face looks amazing!!</li>
    <li> Does good for the skin</li>
    <li> I have extremely dry skin and have been trying to find a face scrub that is abrasive but doesn&#x27;t have harsh chemicals. This stuff is awesome! My face feels amazing and my package arrived wrapped up tightly and did not leak. I will recommend this to everyone I know!</li>
    <li> Actually...not even one star. This stuff is terrible. I&#x27;m a huge fan of exfoliating cleansers but this stuff is rough as heck AND stains the bejeebers out of your facecloth.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get this...</li>
    <li> WOW. I love this!! I exfoliated with the coffee scrub and followed up with the line&#x27;s &amp;#34;organic facial moisturizer.&amp;#34; Not only was the smell incredible, the scrub hydrating and the texture great...but I also have been GLOWING all day. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I use this able the times a week followed by the unscented moisturizer. I LOVE it! Such a great product! I will definitely be ordering again!</li>
    <li> It is a shame that I currently can&#x27;t find this anyplace.  I learned about exfoliant from a professional facial that sold me some samples of products.  when I went to reorder, the price tag was not something I was willing to pay.  I was also concerned that there were a lot of warnings about not getting close to your eyes and when I did get it in my eyes by acident, it was an extreme burn.  I started searching for something that was affordable, gentle, preferably organic, and works.  This stuff meets all my requirements.  It works fantastic!! I was so impressed that I wanted to order some to ship to my daughter but I can&#x27;t find it for sale any longer.</li>
    <li> WHOA, REALLY! The other women&#x27;s reviews are right on! One use, and you can feel a difference! Um, this is posted by the wife of this account... Anyways, awesome product and reviews. I intend to use once a week or a couple times per month. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend every day use. I wish I could use on whole body periodically. I may venture into making my own for self use. Thank You!</li>
    <li> As organic as it can be. Love it. Nothing at all on the ingredients list that is not 100% natural. No preservative, no parabens, no nothing. If you are looking for an organic product (a real one) this it is.</li>
    <li> Very abrasive... so much stronger in texture than a sugar or apricot scrub. It was actually painful to rub in. Very messy too, and even after washing with my own cleanser afterwards my skin still smelled like coffee. Despite the abrasiveness and smell, it did leave my face silky smooth... so if you are used to super abrasive exfoliants on your face, then you&#x27;ll love this. I think my skin is just a little too sensitive. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be using it again on my face, but I can still use it as a body scrub for my legs, arms, and feet... so it won&#x27;t be wasted. It also came separated, which they do warn you about... however, it was very solid on the bottom and difficult to stir it back together.</li>
    <li> The smell is a little weird but it works well.  At least I think it does but I had limited time to use the product. My dog thought the smell was wonderful and consumed the whole jar. Thank god for organic ingredients. I will be ordering more, and shut the bathroom door in the future.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this stuff. She says her face feels so smooth afterwards and the smell is great. I have one for myself. I will use it soon. Contents will settle just stir it little.</li>
    <li> Love this and reccomend . I have oily skin and i wash twice a day . This helps me not need foudation, and it doesnt make me breakout.i use this after face wash and then lotion... aaanf waaallah!  Smooth clean moist feeling. Also used on my legs today and wow it was incredible like silk . Will order again .</li>
    <li> Wonderful texture and scent!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! The price is right and it works as well as the expensive coffee exfoliators!</li>
    <li> This product has completely transformed my skin. I noticed much smoother and softer skin within a couple of days. I am going on week 4 and I am falling in love with the results.  I will be using this product for a lifetime. I&#x27;m not going back to the pharmaceutical products. The best thing I could&#x27;ve done for my skin is use organic products. This is a little gem for the price. Don&#x27;t be afraid to give this a try. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> When i first received the item, my first thought was that the thing was... tiny. My second thought was that it smells absolutely divine!&lt;br /&gt;With this product,  a little really does go a long way! I used less than a dime sized portion for the first time today and i was (am) blown away by how soft my skin (still) feels. I recommend using it in the shower, and afterwards, use your pinky to rub in some coconut oil as an after moisturizer. Works wonders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Get a facial scrubber to really buff out your skin! The grains are non abrasive and dissolve so you wont have to worry about micro-tears. Remember, small and light upwards circles. Don&#x27;t scrub too hard!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, my big question is.... why haven&#x27;t more people tried/reviewed this product?! Its heavenly, and for the price... CAN&#x27;T get better than this. Oh, and the ingredients are ACTUALLY organic. No hidden parabens or sulfates that most &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; store bought products have. Do yourself a favor and get this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** UPDATE**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cannot go back after using this scrub. Lush ain&#x27;t got sh*the on this!&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful smell, not too rough, and gets rid of my acne. Beautifully simplistic. Could the container be better? Yes. (Don&#x27;t leave in the shower) will it stain your white cloth? Yes! It&#x27;s a COFFEE scrub, duh. But overall, this product hasn&#x27;t let me down. It even gives my skin a nice little temporary bronze twinge, hah. The price is phenomenal, and it works wonders. All of these one star reviews don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re talkin&#x27; about. Try it for yourself! You won&#x27;t be disappointed (unless your package leaks in which case just request for a new one, or you hate coffee)</li>
    <li> Simple and pure. If you want a basic coffee scrub, this is it. Make sure you have your moisturizers and serums ready for afterwards, because your skin will be ready for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered four of these at once, because the price is incredibly low (less than $3 per unit right now) and the shipping costs per unit go down with each additonal unit that you order. Four of these for less than $20, including shipping? Unreal. I am very happy.</li>
    <li> Oh my goodness!  I am in heaven.  Every single review that says you feel the difference after just one use is the absolute truth!  My skin feels amazingly soft and supple, and doesn&#x27;t feel dried out or irritated!  I&#x27;m going to purchase more jars while this is still available at such a terrific price!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great and almost as good a &amp;#34;wake-up&amp;#34; as my cup of coffee in the morning.  The coffee grounds are excellent scrubbers, and  after rinsing my skin doesn&#x27;t have that tight scratchy feeling that it does with many other scrubs.  A little goes a long way and I&#x27;ve found that just a couple of finger tip sized dabs work nicely.  I use it twice a day and have not had any redness, tightness or dryness.  Because of the honey (I suspect) it takes several rinses to remove the scrub, but the final result is well worth it.</li>
    <li> All natural ingredients...check&lt;br /&gt;Super cheap...check&lt;br /&gt;Works...check&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even like the smell, though admittedly &amp;#34;coffee&amp;#34; is not the kind of thing you&#x27;d expect from a facial scrub.  (And be aware this product literally is basically coffee grounds with oils and smattering of other things.)</li>
    <li> This is an excellent facial scrub and smells so yummy you&#x27;ll feel tempted to eat it, but don&#x27;t. It&#x27;s for external use only. I&#x27;m doing my face sloughing once or twice a week at most. No more than that is necessary. My skin loves it, and I love the price. My &amp;#34;thing&amp;#34; now is to go organic with my food and personal products. I know toxins in the body are extremely harmful and linked to cancer. Glad I found this on amazon, along with a moisturizer by the same brand.</li>
    <li> My Face feels so fresh after the cleaning! What a Great Value. I will be buying more</li>
    <li> Horrible! I usually love the but this smells like old, moldy coffee grinds. Disgusting smell and the pieces are WAY too big to be safe on delicate facial skin. I was glad I paid so little because I threw it in the garbage.I have to assume that people are paid to give this good reviews or they are all family/friends of whoever is producing this stuff. Save your money.</li>
    <li> made me break out but it smells awesome</li>
    <li> Buy this now!  I&#x27;ve tried a few facial scrubs and I like this the best.  My skin is so soft.  I can&#x27;t wait to try more products from this line.</li>
    <li> Excellent service!!! Package arrived quickly.  Fabulous product. It leaves my face feeling very soft and smooth. I would definitely recommend this product.  I will be buying again!!!!</li>
    <li> I Love it! Left my skin so soft!!!</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF....hoping to find it with with PRIME mailing...did not see this listed on Organic Fields of Heather&#x27;s website??  I hope its not discontinued...best exfoliant I ever used...not harsh..makes your skin glow....I went ahead and ordered, just ordered the moisturizer as well...hoping its just as good....</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way. I love how soft my face feels after using it, you can beat the price!</li>
    <li> I love this exfoliater.I can tell in one use how good it works, my skin feels really soft after using it and that&#x27;s before I even have applied my mosturizer!The exfoliater smells just like coffee so that&#x27;s a plus too!</li>
    <li> This little jar is absolutely a wonderful jar of mini pleasures just waiting to be unleashed!! WOW loved it!!! Smell was heavenly!!!</li>
    <li> No doubt this stuff makes me fact holy crap soft... and added with the vanilla face moisturizer afterward, it does the job well.  I use this about three times a week.  I recommend using it in the shower, as it can be VERY messy, and coffee scrubbers literally get everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That aside, I LOVE the way it smells and feels on my skin.  I would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I just used this tonight and it&#x27;s really great. It smells so nice and my face was dry and immediately after using this I don&#x27;t have any patchy dry areas. Make sure you lightly cleanse though, it&#x27;s a very good exfoliant so you don&#x27;t need to go rough on your face, otherwise you will notice some redness as your exfoliating. So far, so good though!</li>
    <li> I love love this!  I only wish it were a bigger container!</li>
    <li> Your skin feels amazing after using this! It&#x27;s not the prettiest scrub to look at and it does have a very strong coffee scent, but it works wonders.</li>
    <li> Can I say that this exfoliating scrub is absolutely fantastic from first use. All that is needed is a dime size amount after wetting face with water &amp; then working in a circular motion with your hand or finger tips! It left my face clean &amp; soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom. And the price is &amp;#34;dirt cheap&amp;#34; I  am so glad that I came across this facial exfoliating scrub on Amazon! Very satisfied, happy customer. Btw...I ve ordered another two jars for when I&#x27;m finished with the first two initially ordered!</li>
