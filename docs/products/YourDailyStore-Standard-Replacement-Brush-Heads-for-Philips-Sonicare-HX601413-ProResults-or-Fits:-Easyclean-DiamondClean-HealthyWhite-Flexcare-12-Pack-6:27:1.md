      <li>GREAT VALUE ON THESE SONICARE TOOTHBRUSHES.</li>
      <li>Service was great</li>
      <li>Almost perfect compatibility with what sells for much more in pharmacies.</li>
      <li>Good price</li>
      <li>Fit my Phillips, Sonicare  perfectly!!</li>
      <li>They fell good in my mouth and on my teeth.</li>
      <li>these are just as good as the sonic care ones</li>
      <li>Fit my toothbrush perfectly.</li>
      <li>Good quality and deal for the price.</li>
      <li>Now these are the correct size and once again I will be happy for the time until I must order more Philips Sonicare electric replacement brushes.</li>
      <li>Great price and appear to fit and work as well as the Phillips brand!</li>
      <li>Received my 12 pack of Sonicare compatible refills in no time and am very satisfied.</li>
      <li>What a great buy this was, it fit my toothbrush</li>
      <li>These tooth brush heads work great, and are a huge value compared to the official brand.  </li>
      <li>The product itself is great, and works perfect on my Diamond brush, but I never received the extra 4 brushes even though I bought two packages in one order just to get the deal that was offered.</li>
      <li>Extremely satisfied with the product.</li>
      <li>I will be buying again for sure.</li>
      <li>Love Sonicare and will purchase when I need to refill.</li>
      <li>A better description should be written up and picture the brush insert for correctly ordering.</li>
      <li>Glad they were available.</li>
      <li>Fit fine.  </li>
      <li>Great toothbrush, especially for the price.</li>
      <li>I did not get the free 4-packs.</li>
      <li>They fit the sonic care.</li>
      <li>These work and fit well</li>
      <li>sure beats paying $26 for a 3 pack of the OEM heads and the results appear to be the same as I have been getting consistently good checkups and no coffee stains on my teeth.</li>
      <li>Nothing like the original head.  </li>
      <li>However I did not receive the &amp;#34;free 4 pack - if two full packs&amp;#34; were ordered - as advertised.</li>
      <li>Came in quickly.  </li>
      <li>Something about these brushes just doesn&#x27;t feel quite right.  </li>
      <li>For some reason, they fit loosely on my wifes sonicare handle, we swapped handles and now they both work fine.</li>
      <li>You get what you pay for, will not buy this online anymore and pay the $25+ for the real deal.</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t stay connected to the handle very well.  </li>
      <li>The heads work on my toothbrush; I&#x27;m giving a low rating because they didn&#x27;t send me my free pack when I ordered two.</li>
      <li>They are rougher on your teeth than the standard diamond head, but they last almost as long and are sold at a great price.</li>
      <li>But they did not vibrate enough to get the clean feeling.</li>
      <li>However, I have to replace my brush with a new one every couple of weeks.  </li>
      <li>Only difference is the steep price Philips wants for theirs.</li>
      <li>So far I have used one from the pack and it is working well.</li>
      <li>I just bought another 12 pack (same exact packaging, same heads) on Amazon.&lt;br</li>
      <li>These do not fit the Sonicare properly so initially the vibration is not correct and doesn&#x27;t feel right.  </li>

<li> Due to the vibration they tend to come off in the middle of brushing your teeth.  </li>
<li> Just push it back down each time you use it, and it&#x27;ll do the job.</li>
<li> It came exactly as expected and on time</li>
<li> Be careful to order Diamond Head Brushes if Diamond Head Plilips is what you purchased.</li>
<li> Other than the fact that after a few days of use, the vibrations might lift the head off of the body, it works just as it&#x27;s supposed to.  </li>
<li> Does not fit well, bristles very sharp.</li>
<li> Ones I had purchased at Wal-mart never fit well.</li>
<li> but I had to return, the bristles were too hard.</li>
<li> They were really tough</li>
<li> Very Disappointed!  </li>
<li> Horrible.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> These were just what I was looking for</li>
    <li> Great price and appear to fit and work as well as the Phillips brand!</li>
    <li> Horrible. Does not fit well, bristles very sharp.</li>
    <li> My opinion - these work just as well at the Philips heads. Only difference is the steep price Philips wants for theirs. They fell good in my mouth and on my teeth.</li>
    <li> They are rougher on your teeth than the standard diamond head, but they last almost as long and are sold at a great price.</li>
    <li> They worked great.  Glad they were available.</li>
    <li> these are just as good as the sonic care ones</li>
    <li> GREAT VALUE ON THESE SONICARE TOOTHBRUSHES.</li>
    <li> I did not get the free 4-packs.</li>
    <li> Now these are the correct size and once again I will be happy for the time until I must order more Philips Sonicare electric replacement brushes.</li>
    <li> Very similar quality to the Phillips brushes, at a fraction of the price.</li>
    <li> Came in quickly.  Good price</li>
    <li> The product itself is great, and works perfect on my Diamond brush, but I never received the extra 4 brushes even though I bought two packages in one order just to get the deal that was offered.</li>
    <li> Not the same - they fall off.</li>
    <li> Great price !!  They works perfectly.</li>
    <li> These work and fit well but the first few uses they loose a few bristles.</li>
    <li> Awesome deal for a great price! Work just as good as the name brand!</li>
    <li> Product was NOT sonicare product!</li>
    <li> Received my 12 pack of Sonicare compatible refills in no time and am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> What a great buy this was, it fit my toothbrush and now I have brushes to last awhile. I will be buying again for sure.</li>
    <li> These do not fit the Sonicare properly so initially the vibration is not correct and doesn&#x27;t feel right.  After a couple uses they no longer stay connected at all.  No way to use these.  Had to throw them out.</li>
    <li> It came exactly as expected and on time</li>
    <li> Service was great but I had to return, the bristles were too hard.</li>
    <li> These tooth brush heads work great, and are a huge value compared to the official brand.  As others have noted, the bristles are a bit stiffer than the name brand brush heads, but personally, I prefer that.</li>
    <li> They were really tough</li>
    <li> I have been using these replacement brush heads for a couple years now which I initially purchased from another source. I just bought another 12 pack (same exact packaging, same heads) on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;It sure beats paying $26 for a 3 pack of the OEM heads and the results appear to be the same as I have been getting consistently good checkups and no coffee stains on my teeth.</li>
    <li> Fit my Phillips, Sonicare  perfectly!!</li>
    <li> Nothing like the original head.  Wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> They fit the sonic care. But they did not vibrate enough to get the clean feeling. I might as well just use them as a regular tooth brush head. You get what you pay for, will not buy this online anymore and pay the $25+ for the real deal.</li>
    <li> Be careful to order Diamond Head Brushes if Diamond Head Plilips is what you purchased.</li>
    <li> Great price and bargain. Love Sonicare and will purchase when I need to refill.</li>
    <li> Not totally the sellers fault.  A better description should be written up and picture the brush insert for correctly ordering.</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush, especially for the price. For some reason, they fit loosely on my wifes sonicare handle, we swapped handles and now they both work fine. I&#x27;ll order them again!</li>
    <li> Other than the fact that after a few days of use, the vibrations might lift the head off of the body, it works just as it&#x27;s supposed to.  Just push it back down each time you use it, and it&#x27;ll do the job.</li>
    <li> These look just like Sonicare brushes.  Fit fine.  However, I have to replace my brush with a new one every couple of weeks.  The bristles just don&#x27;t last like the originals do.</li>
    <li> The heads work on my toothbrush; I&#x27;m giving a low rating because they didn&#x27;t send me my free pack when I ordered two.</li>
    <li> So far I have used one from the pack and it is working well. I like how each head has a different color to distinguish which one is which.</li>
    <li> A great value.  Packaging was not great and 2 of the brushes were broken in shipping, but still a great value.</li>
    <li> Almost perfect compatibility with what sells for much more in pharmacies.</li>
    <li> Brushes are great. Fit my toothbrush perfectly. Ones I had purchased at Wal-mart never fit well. Extremely satisfied with the product. However I did not receive the &amp;#34;free 4 pack - if two full packs&amp;#34; were ordered - as advertised.</li>
    <li> Very Disappointed!  They don&#x27;t stay connected to the handle very well.  Due to the vibration they tend to come off in the middle of brushing your teeth.  I will not buy again.  Remember you get what you pay for</li>
    <li> Good quality and deal for the price.</li>
    <li> Something about these brushes just doesn&#x27;t feel quite right.  To touch with you fingers, they don&#x27;t feel any different than OEM.  But when brushing with them, they give you a sensation that they are scratching your teeth rather than brushing them.</li>
