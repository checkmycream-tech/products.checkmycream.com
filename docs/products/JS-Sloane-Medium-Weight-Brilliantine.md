      <li>Easy to apply to damp hair and dry.</li>
      <li>My favorite pomade after trying about ten different kinds.</li>
      <li>I shouldn&#x27;t be able to smell my hair product all day long just by wagging my head back and forth.</li>
      <li>Smells like strawberries and holds my thick curly hair nicely.</li>
      <li>I like to give my hair a natural look when I style it</li>
      <li>My daily user for very thick/curly hair.</li>
      <li>Got it from my barber about a month ago (usually would get admiral supply strong hold...</li>
      <li>and this stuff does the trick as long as I don&#x27;t use too much at a time.</li>
      <li>I could barely get a comb through it.</li>
      <li>When I did manage to drag a comb all the way through, it made my hair stick straight out, as if I got shot in the head with a hair spray missile during a hurricane!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This stuff is awesome. I like to give my hair a natural look when I style it and this stuff does the trick as long as I don&#x27;t use too much at a time. One can of this stuff will easily last me months of daily application as well. And to top it all off, it smells great too.</li>
    <li> I love it. Got it from my barber about a month ago (usually would get admiral supply strong hold...great stuff as well). Scent is awesome, my wife loves it and get compliments at the job when passing by. The hold is great, lasts all day. Really easy to apply and comb through. Top quality stuff here guys</li>
    <li> This is very good gel.  They suggested it at my barber and they use it all the time for pompadours and other hairstyles that require a lot of hold and flexibility with the product.  It smells great and holds all day as long as you do not touch it.It has a pink consistency and doesn&#x27;t clump as well.  Easy to apply to damp hair and dry.</li>
    <li> My favorite pomade after trying about ten different kinds. I love the nice shine it gives my hair too and then it washes out perfectly with some shampoo. It will hold all day if you put what seems to be more than necessary in your hair. Otherwise it&#x27;ll hold till about 5pm.</li>
    <li> There are reviews all over the internet about this stuff. Most people seem to enjoy it. I&#x27;m not here to say it won&#x27;t work for you. I am definitely here to say it was terrible for my hair!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine hair. The product description states, &amp;#34;for medium to finer hairs&amp;#34;. ABSOLUTE BS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It made my hair so matted down and greasy I could barely get a comb through it. When I did manage to drag a comb all the way through, it made my hair stick straight out, as if I got shot in the head with a hair spray missile during a hurricane!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t matter if I applied it wet or dry, same result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t even get me started on the smell...on second thought. I enjoy a great smelling product just as much as the next guy, but this stuff was overkill. It&#x27;s nice at first, but the scent NEVER goes away. It sent my wife running from the room after 30 seconds. When I drove to work, it made the whole vehicle stink. I shouldn&#x27;t be able to smell my hair product all day long just by wagging my head back and forth.</li>
    <li> Good work, but why couldn&#x27;t&#x27; the fragrance be a bit more masculine?!</li>
    <li> I used Teddy Boy Matte before this and this product gets a lot more hold at the expense of soft matteness. My hair is parted to the side--look up the Russian spy from the newer version of The Man from U.N.C.L.E.-- and this pomade is perfect for it. It has decent shine--too much shine looks bad in my opinion--and it keeps it&#x27;s shape all day!</li>
    <li> Works good for my 30&#x27;s-40&#x27;s German hairstyle.  I love this product and it is one of the best I have used.  For the price, you cannot go wrong.

Love the styling of the container and paper on it as well.</li>
    <li> Great smell.  Great hold.  Little to no shine.  No flakes like gel.</li>
    <li> Smells like a rubber dog toy.</li>
    <li> This product met and exceeded all expectations. Great strength for a lasting hold, yet easy enough to maneuver with just a touch of water. Use on dry or wet hair.</li>
    <li> Smells almost sickly sweet at first, but the smell doesn&#x27;t last or carry. Really nice hold, though shine could be a bit better. My daily user for very thick/curly hair.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.</li>
    <li> Holds all day, and smells great!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great, washes out quick and easily. Isn&#x27;t oily. Smells great - a sweet, clean smell.</li>
    <li> Best pomade out there. Smells great and awesome on your hair</li>
    <li> Smells like strawberries and holds my thick curly hair nicely.</li>
    <li> bought this because my barber used this on my hair and I really like it. It smells like gummy bears or some sort of candy. Holds really good. Next time I might try the heavyweight to see which one I like better.</li>
    <li> This stuff is brilliant! My barber suggested and it works wonders! I don&#x27;t have a whole lot of hair but this still does wonders for what I do have. It has a nice hold, it even smells good. It rinses out easily as well. I&#x27;m super pleased and will continue to use this product.</li>
