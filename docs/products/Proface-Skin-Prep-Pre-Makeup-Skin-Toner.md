      <li>I received it very fast and works great</li>
      <li>Make me look greasy and sweat more</li>
      <li>Best of all the facial sweat reducers.</li>

      <li>I like that it&#x27;s a liquid, and it just goes on nice and smooth.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>otherwise it will make your foundation flake :)</li>
      <li>I use a mineral powder makeup, and I find that my makeup sticks much better when I use a primer like Smashbox Oil Free Primer over it.</li>

      <li>It had no scent and went on easily</li>
      <li>This is hands down the best.</li>
      <li>It would have been fine if it stopped the sweating but</li>
      <li>this time is super!  </li>
      <li>I recommend this product for light sweaters.</li>
      <li>will notice a grayish cast if not applied lightly.</li>
      <li>I love this primer when I know I&#x27;ll be in a humid or hot environment.</li>
      <li>but it works fairly well, especially for my oily skin.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pleased to say it absolutely worked for the majority of the day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t think there was anything I could use to stop the embarrassing sweating above my top lip besides botox until I came upon this product and after reading the many positive reviews, I hoped that this would be able to work.</li>
      <li>My go to primer for my super oily face.</li>
      <li>(She used Milk of Magnesia over it to help with shine since I have a super oily T zone</li>
      <li>I sweat alot in my face and have super oily skin.</li>
      <li>You can try a light moisturizer first, then apply the product to face.</li>
      <li>It lasted for a good six hours of anxiety with virtually no sweat and only lost out against a walk in the hot Florida sun.</li>
      <li>The next day I began to use it on my nose too, to keep my glasses from slipping all over in the heat, Worked perfect.</li>
      <li>real test came when I applied it on my husband as we live in the Caribbean and he sweats very easily.</li>
      <li>I put it under my makeup right up to the hairline.</li>
      <li>First of all I don&#x27;t even think I got the right product.</li>
      <li>honestly came into this with my eyes open and did not expect too much m.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
      <li>love it and will definitely be re purchasing.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know what the positive reviews are about because this did absolutely nothing except</li>
      <li>Too much will over-dry the skin and those with darker skin tones</li>
      <li>a keep using it to see if it takes time to start really working:/</li>
      <li>Works very well.</li>
      <li>But I have very oily skin</li>
      <li>has a sort of mattifying effect on makeup when placed before and really does help with the sweating.</li>
      <li>so there is so much a product can do.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t really stop sweat but keeps makeup in place</li>
      <li>I was really hoping this was going to work</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very drying on the skin.</li>
      <li>I do recommend you use a light moisturizer under it, as it will dry your face</li>
      <li>I used this on my forehead the first day of vacation in a muggy climate and it worked great.</li>
      <li>But for some of us who turn into a sweaty mess when trying to look pretty, its worth it.</li>
      <li>this stuff completely lived up to its name , its a god send , especially when you live in hot or humid states.</li>
      <li>Clear ProFace</li>
      <li>the one in the clear bottle.</li>
      <li>Only problem is that its very drying.</li>
      <li>This works pretty well for the humid deep South but doesn&#x27;t totally prevent moisture from seeping through</li>
      <li>i have oily skin that sweats profoundly.</li>
      <li>Am just now, three hours later, starting to be able to see a little.</li>
      <li>but once we went outside for water time in started to sweat like normal ....</li>
      <li>But it is the same product so no hard done.</li>
      <li>There is a tiny direction that says &amp;#34;do not use around???&amp;#34; And the final word is not even legible.</li>
      <li>Expected too much from this product.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>Not only did it arrive early, but I absolutely had no issues with the vendor as noted in the previous review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I applied it all over his face and head before he left for work and he came home raving that he barely broke a sweat</li>
      <li>I applies this onto the t-zone and it really reduces sweating and makes my t-zone less oily.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works very well. I use it every time I go dancing. Keep my make up on all night</li>
    <li> Great sweat retardant! But, I can&#x27;t find it anymore!!! The one in the dark bottle is not the same as the one the one in the clear bottle.</li>
    <li> I have tried all types of mattifiers, primers, and make up sealers. This is hands down the best. I sweat alot in my face and have super oily skin. This does not 100% eliminate those problems but it is the best thing so far that I&#x27;ve ever tried. I would say there is a 60-70% improvement. My make up stays in place and fairly matte for hours. Also, a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Great primer. Doesn&#x27;t really stop sweat but keeps makeup in place</li>
    <li> This product will stop you from sweating along your hairline and face, very awesome! Only problem is that its very drying. It sucks every drop of moisture from your face, so you need to use only as necessary or you&#x27;ll really dry out your skin if you use daily. It also can make foundation look cracked and dry if your skin is at all dry already. You cannot use moisturizer with it or it won&#x27;t work. But for some of us who turn into a sweaty mess when trying to look pretty, its worth it.</li>
    <li> While it did help keep my stage makeup on, it didn&#x27;t stop the sweat from my scalp rolling over it and washing it into my eyes. I recommend this product for light sweaters. It did more harm than good for this performer who sweats under the stage lights.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very drying on the skin. I used it once as intended. But since then I just use it as a makeup setting spray. The one time I applied it under my makeup it did not work. The sweat from my hairline washed the product and makeup away.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think there was anything I could use to stop the embarrassing sweating above my top lip besides botox until I came upon this product and after reading the many positive reviews, I hoped that this would be able to work. I don&#x27;t know what the positive reviews are about because this did absolutely nothing except make my makeup application in the area I applied it worse. It would have been fine if it stopped the sweating but no. Complete waste of money!</li>
    <li> I have facial cranial hyperhydrosis and this product did absolutely nothing to alleviate my excessive sweating.</li>
    <li> It may have just been me, but I could tell it was on my skin, it felt like it was trying to work but still sweat would pour down my face while I was just doing my hair. Again, it could have just been me, but I was hoping this would be my miracle cure instead of getting botox for my facial sweating, but it was a no go</li>
    <li> I was hoping this product would stop oil and sweat, but it did for about 30 min.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t help my facial sweating at all, which is so dissapointing. I can&#x27;t find anything that does:/ However I do use this sometimes for under my boobs, and it does the trick.</li>
    <li> This proface product did not make me sweat under my makeup. It does however makes your skin really dry. What i do is i apply product and once dry i apply moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I love this primer when I know I&#x27;ll be in a humid or hot environment. It can be a little drying and you don&#x27;t need to use a lot- otherwise it will make your foundation flake :)</li>
    <li> This is a must have!! I can&#x27;t believe how well it works! I use it as a setting product but works well as a primer too.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product to use. I notice that my foundation does not streak when it gets wet. However, this product takes time to get use to. It makes your face feel VERY TIGHT, if you follow it as directed. Moreover, I apply it after I moisturize my face and it is PERFECT.</li>
    <li> This my second time purchasing. It&#x27;s the only thing that makes my makeup last in the NYC heat!</li>
    <li> fast shipping and great product</li>
    <li> I bought it for my face because I sweat a lot.. It made my face tight after I let it dry for a couple seconds when I got to work I noticed that I wasn&#x27;t sweating but once we went outside for water time in started to sweat like normal ....so it helped a little I guess ima keep using it to see if it takes time to start really working:/</li>
    <li> Ordered this on accident but tried it anyway. Make me look greasy and sweat more</li>
    <li> It does help with keeping my makeup on during my lunch time workouts except for my nose. But I have very oily skin so there is so much a product can do. I do notice that when I can the oil away, some of my makeup is still on.  I use L&#x27;oreal BB cream and it takes away the dry skin feeling.</li>
    <li> I ordered and promptly received two bottles of this product. Not only did it arrive early, but I absolutely had no issues with the vendor as noted in the previous review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product works almost too well! You really need to use it LIGHTLY, a small amount goes a long way. Too much will over-dry the skin and those with darker skin tones will notice a grayish cast if not applied lightly. You can try a light moisturizer first, then apply the product to face.</li>
    <li> Based on youtube and Amazon reviews this purchase was made.&lt;br /&gt;I honestly came into this with my eyes open and did not expect too much m.&lt;br /&gt;It has a sort of mattifying effect on makeup when placed before and really does help with the sweating. It in my opinion doesn&#x27;t work too well on the shine though you&#x27;ll need to use something else over it for that.&lt;br /&gt;The real test came when I applied it on my husband as we live in the Caribbean and he sweats very easily. He is also bald headed. I applied it all over his face and head before he left for work and he came home raving that he barely broke a sweat and in fact he noticed that it was at The end of his 9 hour day that he got some sweat break through.&lt;br /&gt;We love it and will definitely be re purchasing.</li>
    <li> Best of all the facial sweat reducers.</li>
    <li> Expected too much from this product.&lt;br /&gt;This product did not help me with sweating once I put on my makeup.  It had no scent and went on easily so that is why I said OK.</li>
    <li> This tonic is very effective for a couple hours. Most easily and comfortably applied that I have tried.</li>
    <li> Great stuff.... I was using Neat FaceSaver Gel before I found this. I like that it&#x27;s a liquid, and it just goes on nice and smooth. I do recommend you use a light moisturizer under it, as it will dry your face (but that&#x27;s the point). I still have hairline perspiration issues, so I&#x27;m Eagerly awaiting a scalp treatment that I can comb in around my face!!  I use a mineral powder makeup, and I find that my makeup sticks much better when I use a primer like Smashbox Oil Free Primer over it.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Works well</li>
    <li> This works pretty well for the humid deep South but doesn&#x27;t totally prevent moisture from seeping through so it gets a 3.5 rating from me. Apply with a little piece of cotton or you will waste it, it&#x27;s quite runny.</li>
    <li> My go to primer for my super oily face.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed it having any effect on my sweat</li>
    <li> I am obsessed with this product! I have hormone changes and this controlled my nose sweat on the hottest day of the year!!</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t stop my facial sweating but it slowed it down.</li>
    <li> this stuff completely lived up to its name , its a god send , especially when you live in hot or humid states. I use it under my cosplay makeup and my every day makeup!</li>
    <li> First of all I don&#x27;t even think I got the right product. No where on the packaging does it say no sweat. Also this got in&lt;br /&gt;My eyes and I could barely opens eyes due to pain. Am just now, three hours later, starting to be able to see a little. There is a tiny direction that says &amp;#34;do not use around???&amp;#34; And the final word is not even legible. So maybe it says eye...maybe it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> My head and face sweat a lot when I get anxious and I had a big all-day interview and presentation coming up. I was probably as nervous about the stupid sweat as the rest of the process. After a lot of research, I decided to give this product a try. I&#x27;m pleased to say it absolutely worked for the majority of the day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It leaves your skin very dry and sticky feeling, but doesn&#x27;t rub off on anything. I put it under my makeup right up to the hairline. It lasted for a good six hours of anxiety with virtually no sweat and only lost out against a walk in the hot Florida sun. I wouldn&#x27;t use this everyday by any means, but I am so grateful to have found something to combat the stress sweats!</li>
    <li> this time is super!  It works as stated.</li>
    <li> My makeup artist used this for my wedding and I didn&#x27;t sweat at ALL! (She used Milk of Magnesia over it to help with shine since I have a super oily T zone so I&#x27;d advise that as well.)</li>
    <li> I bought this for my high school P.E., like how bad is it to see your crush with a sweating face ( it was bad). After I got this it made my face sweat less but not spot. I loved it, it was perfect to put on AFTER P.E because it stops sweat. It rocks you should get it.</li>
    <li> Did not work for me, plus made my skin so tight it looked like shoe leather.  Yet, it did not stop perspiration.</li>
    <li> My skin reacts to just about every makeup product on the market. Organic, not organic. Expensive or cheap. It doesn&#x27;t matter. My face starts to itch and my sebaceous glands go into overdrive. I also tend to overheat quickly, especially if I&#x27;m anxious. This has managed to keep a nice barrier between my makeup and my skin. No itching, no sweating, no wondering why I bothered to put makeup on at all. Where has this been all of my life?</li>
    <li> does whats is supposed to do. however, it makes skin very very dry , it feels overstretched..</li>
    <li> I received it very fast and works great</li>
    <li> This product worked very good while I was on vacation. I used this on my forehead the first day of vacation in a muggy climate and it worked great. The next day I began to use it on my nose too, to keep my glasses from slipping all over in the heat, Worked perfect. It is feels dry ad tight but a bit of moisturizer or lotion after it dries eliminates that look and feel. I only wish they would formulate a shampoo with this product that wouldn&#x27;t dry your hair out.</li>
    <li> I sweat a little bit in the beginning but it works fairly well, especially for my oily skin. But the bottle was different, they should reference the product update. I had to search for the original maker because I thought I got the wrong product (Black Skink Prep Pro instead of Clear ProFace No Sweat.) But it is the same product so no hard done.</li>
    <li> i have oily skin that sweats profoundly. I applies this onto the t-zone and it really reduces sweating and makes my t-zone less oily. My skin feels slightly tight but not dry. So glad that I found this product!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately I was disappointed with this product. After reading the reviews it sounded like it might be the product I was hoping to find. I do however, feel it trying to work as I apply it to my face and it begins to dry but after I apply my makeup I swear off my nose and above my lip and see the swear seeping through. I was really hoping this was going to work but unfortunately it&#x27;s just not strong enough. :(</li>
