<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> THIS DEVICE HAS CHANGED MY LIFE!  WISH I HAD PURCHASED&lt;br /&gt;A CALLUS REMOVER LONG AGO, could not AFFORD A PRO TIL I&lt;br /&gt;SAW THIS ON AMAZON!  VERY FAST DEL ...LOV LOVLOV</li>
    <li> I love these...use it on the bottoms of my feet..everyone should own one of these..Make the heels and bottoms of my feet feel so good..This one is for my dad..He uses something like a razor to remove his callus...hoping this will do the trick. Has to be better for him than a razor at 83..but, as we all know, can&#x27;t teach old dogs new tricks..</li>
    <li> Very happy with this. It is quiet and works really well. It is easy to clean and the heads last a decent amount of time. This really helps my feet feel better and keeps my skin from splitting. Would definitely recommend</li>
    <li> Super super product this is a very handy product for at home when you don&#x27;t have time to go get a pedicure . This product came just as described and I&#x27;m very impressed with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a professional foot callus remover for feet this powerful pedicure kit gently smoothes dry cracked feet and replaces-skin shavers, foot scrubbers and foot scrapers this foot file too is l for healthy silky feet .This electronic callus remover gives professional spa results without going to salons. There are 3 million sweat glands in the dermis of the adult foot. Feet need to breathe to operate properly. Unclog pores so feet can breathe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Men in one day of average walking, forces impacting their feet can total hundreds of tons. That&#x27;s the weight of a fully loaded cement truck.Women are four more times likely to have feet problems. This is often times due to shoes with the priority of cute over comfortable.This battery operated foot care tool is  easy on the feet and comes with an extra roller, cleaning brush, complete instructions, cover for the roller and the e-book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this as soon as I received it as I haven&#x27;t had a pedicure in awhile , so the callus build up on my feet was extreme .Well not anymore this product completely removed all my calluses and left my feet smooth and soft, I think now I will be saving money by skipping pedicure appointments . After I tried this well my husband saw my feet and we had to do his also and boy o boy his were a lot worse then mine, this product completely removed all his calluses also .This remover is simple and painless to use this is an awesome product .I highly recommend this product for all your at home pedicure needs .</li>
    <li> I have had problems with dry cracked feet for a ver long time and have tried everything to remedy the problem. This product did wonders and my feet look like normal feet now. After each use I make sure that I put a heavy moisturizer to help maintain the look.</li>
    <li> Love this!  I used to use the pedi egg to maintain my feet in between pedicures, but I will no longer be using that.  This little device is easy to use and move around all angles of your feet, and gets great results.</li>
    <li> I originally got this for my husband. He works on his feet for 10 hours a day and his feet are so rough. They actually gross me out when he tries touching me with them. I have tried to give him a pedicure but he thinks those are just for women. When I received this in the mail I begged him to let me use it on him. He finally agreed and I am so glad he did. This thing WORKS. The results were kind of gross, but it worked. It&#x27;s easy to set up and use which is nice. It instantly started removing all his dead skin in large amounts. After I was finished using this on his feet...they actually looked like normal feet! He went and rinsed them off, added some lotion, and was shocked they looked healthy. He said they felt better too. This doesn&#x27;t hurt, may tickle a little bit, doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation or redness. It&#x27;s a great product and as soon as it worked on my husband I became sold on it. *promotional pricing received for testing and review*</li>
    <li> works like it is advertised!</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product! I bought this for my son who stands on his feet all day wearing workboots. He has really thick calluses on his feet and he has been wanting to get one of these. He used it for the first time and loved it. I took off all the bad callus and made his feet really smooth. There is nothing like using a battery operated remover instead of the old fashion hand one. It can be used wet or dry. It comes with an extra head and a brush for cleaning it. I highly recommend this product. I received this product at a discounted rate for my honest review.</li>
    <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE this product!  My feet were very bad since I go bare foot as often as I can and have since I was a little girl.  I had not found a product yet that would make my heels and feet smooth UNTIL I used this product.  I was the &amp;#34;one&amp;#34; at the salon that they ALWAYS up-charged for my terrible callused feet!  I am so excited to own this &amp;#34;tool&amp;#34; and am looking forward to smoother feet from now on.  I HIGHLY recommend this awesome product!  I am still in shock that it really worked.  (Be sure to use fresh new batteries for optimum results!)</li>
    <li> Works on my calluses and dry skin with very little irritation or aggravation.  Gentle on my foot but powerful action.  I am very pleased with this purchase.  Now I don&#x27;t have to be embarrassed about the dry flaky skin on my heels when I start wearing my flip flops for summer.  No more spa pedicures!  5 stars.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it - great communications from seller</li>
    <li> Is a very good product for the price. Is really good.</li>
    <li> la pedi bon professional foot is a battery operated ( 2 AA ) comes with 2 roller heads and one cleaning brush , and 25 pages ebook .I recently moved to USA ...when i was india i regularly used to go for pedicure for every 15 days .I didn&#x27;t want to spend 45$ for 15 days .  So after a long search  came across ...lapedi bon .i am annoyed by the dead cells and callus. Callus are rough dry patches that forms on the feet , i really want to keep  my feet soft and smooth.Anyone with callus feet who wants to have silky smooth healthy feet will go for  La P&amp;eacute;di Bon callus remover.&lt;br /&gt;  How I use it Before starting  put some cloth under your feet , so that unwanted dead skin won&#x27;t get over the carpet . prior using lapedi bon I soak my feet in warm water with some Epsom salt may be for 10 min.Use successive sessions until your feet feel soft .Simply hold La P&amp;eacute;di Bon to your dry callus skin ,gentle apply pressure and start moving la pedi  , you let the callus remover do all the work. If too much pressure is used, the device will immediately stop.  After removing up of callus and dead skin .Atlast apply  lotion  to heels for amazing silky feet .you can easily clean up the device with the brush . Within few minutes of using , you can  notice spa treatment silky  feet  .IT is safe, quick with amazing results....I am very happy showing my feets with confidence ...</li>
    <li> The Pedi Bon is easy to use...my feet are definitely feeling smooth!  I wear flip-flops all summer, and walk around the house barefoot so my feet get really dry and callused.  Using the Pedi Bon is so much easier than using a pumice stone.  I received my product within 2 days, and didn&#x27;t have any problems with the unit working.  I&#x27;m thinking of getting one for my mom too!</li>
    <li> Bought it and wont even turn on from the get go...I even double checked the batteries. I have to send it back, I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Note: I will update this if anything changes. That being said, I have to be honest because I feel this should be said, so here it goes...    I was asked to do a review on this it is a product I really wanted to try, and I received the first one and it didn&#x27;t work. They apologized and sent out a second one, promising to check it before sending it out. The second one even came with batteries this time and did not work. They said they were looking into it thinking that it may be a manufacturing problem. And I truly believe that because in my opinion to design of the battery pack is not well designed. So, I sent both of them back, (I didn&#x27;t have to send them back, but offered to as long as they payed) and now I am waiting to receive another one, which is suppose to be a new design plug in or something. So, needless to say I still don&#x27;t have a product, but didn&#x27;t spend any money because it was review (had it been my money I would be more upset). I am disappointed, but their customer service I will say is pretty freakin amazing. They are so nice and easy to deal with that, I honestly felt bad for who I was talking to. This is the reason I even give it 2 stars, because other companies could learn from the way they deal with the public. I hope they succeed and, I can add onto this review and change my rating soon. Until then it stands, and I end this with buy at your own risk!    UPDATE 2/22/2015: So, I received a new callus remover in the mail today. THIS ONE WORKS!!! Yayyy. It came with instructions on how the batteries should be inserted, which I still think is weird. I also think that they really need a new design, because it shouldn&#x27;t be that hard to operate in the first place. That being said once I got the product to work, it now works great! It did a great job at getting any dead skin off and my feet are really smooth. My only other complaint is that sometimes it will stop if you press down to hard which was somewhat annoying but understandable because I am guessingits a sort of safety feature. I give this 4 stars because of the wonderful customer service and the fact that I finally got a product that works. Also because I think its a great product and does remove the dead skin minus the faulty design of it.</li>
    <li> Instantly made a difference!  My feet look and feel great!</li>
    <li> i received this at a amazing price to review and have to say i love it. its soft enough not to hurt but tough enough to get the job done. i would definitely recommend this o everyone</li>
    <li> I rarely, if ever, leave a one star rating.  I don&#x27;t care what kind of batteries you buy, they don&#x27;t last, only once or twice when using product.  You can barely use any pressure when using dead skin remover.  It takes 10 times longer to use this product than  to do it with a regular hand held pumice stone. Just a poor product. Returning asap. Tried using this many times to give it a chance, followed instructions to the letter. I will call Amazon tomorrow for return instructions.  I hope I get my money back.</li>
    <li> This callous remover works wonderfully! It comes with an extra head and cleaning brush. Item is made well and seems very durable. It does run on batteries, I&#x27;d rather it be rechargeable but it still works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I RECEIVED THIS ITEM AT A DISCOUNT FOR MY HONEST AND UNBIASED REVIEW. ALL OPINIONS ARE MY OWN.</li>
    <li> I really can&#x27;t believe how effective this product was. I walk around my house barefoot (Hey! I live in the Florida!) so I notice that the bottoms of my feet tend to get pretty rough and after just one use my feet were unbelievably soft. It&#x27;s extremely powerful but didn&#x27;t hurt at all. The only issue that I had with this product is that I couldn&#x27;t get it to turn on at first. My boyfriend said I had the batteries in backwards but I checked several times. Either way, it ended up turning on and worked amazingly well. It&#x27;s exceptionally easy to clean also. The instructions recommend running it under water but I used alcohol instead. I&#x27;m not sure how water would affect the file and I thought that it could cause bacteria to grow. The batteries also started to wear out quickly in this so I would recommend investing in a set of rechargeable AA batteries to save yourself some money in the long run. I purchased this product with a 100% off coupon in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> My feet have never been so smooth. :) This is an amazing product and works really well.</li>
    <li> Packaged in a great box suitable for gift giving!  Needs 2 AA batteries.  It comes with the main unit and a replacement head.  It seems to be well made.  It&#x27;s easy to hold at various angles to get all those icky calluses and it worked well.</li>
    <li> I love this little thing, it does wonders for my feet! You can use wet or dry whichever you prefer. It comes with a neat little brush and an extra head. Works on AA batteries , but it works wonders!</li>
    <li> Thought this unit would work better than it does.  Wishing I would have bought the cheaper one for 14.99 - probably would work just as efficient.</li>
    <li> I didnt expect to work a  well as it does.  I am hoping to be able to buy the replacement roller.  It is perfect.</li>
    <li> What a wonderful product.  It&#x27;s so very easy to use and works GREAT!&lt;br /&gt;Leaves my feet feeling wonderful and my skin feels so soft.</li>
    <li> Works good. Saving me a lot of money at the salon! If only it could paint my nails!</li>
    <li> Ok as long as the batteries are new, otherwise not worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY.  This item didn&#x27;t work, wouldn&#x27;t turn on.</li>
    <li> I received my pedi-Bon and was so excited to try it. I have had really bad calluses on my heels for so long and didn&#x27;t really think anything would help much. Was I surprised! Just one time  and my heels are so smooth already.  I love this product! And the packaging is so nice that I believe purchasing another in the near future will make a nice gift! I am very happy with my new pedi-Bon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve received this product to review it and I&#x27;m really impressed with it.  I bought an electrical pedegg and I thought it was weak, I didn&#x27;t like it. So when I got the La Pedi-Bon, I was impressed how much it worked on my feet with two AA batteries. It&#x27;s not rough on the feet, it sort of tickles but you can see that it&#x27;s working. I had a callus on my heel and now it&#x27;s smoothed out. I really like this product and I would buy it for my mother.</li>
    <li> only used it once.... hope to get my feet looking good for summer!</li>
    <li> Our feet are always needing to be exfoliated. However, we never knew the best way to do it. We normally used the Ped-Egg cutter, but it was a hassle. As soon as we discovered the La Pedi-Bon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with the system, 2 foot files, a small brush, 2 AA batteries, instructions and a 25 page e-book (Comes in an email shortly after you buy the product).  This package comes with everything you&#x27;ll need to get started!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The callous remover is super efficient in dealing with the dead skin! Unlike the others I&#x27;ve used, this one does not put you in any awkward positions and is very easy to handle. It feels delightful after every use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that it comes with batteries already. I hate buying a product and come to find out it needs batteries, and we don&#x27;t have any. To put batteries in it, all you need to do is unscrew the bottom of the handle. It has a easy switch to turn it on - the blue with the white dot. Changing the file is easy as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Disclaimer: I received one or more of the above to facilitate this review.

    <li> The La Pedi callus remover got all the dead skin and rough patches off and left my feet feeling smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> Holy cow! This thing works! End of story. Wish I had taken a before and after pic, but the ones on here from other reviewers are spot on! I had a huge callus on the outside of my big toe. I religiously get professional pedicures every two weeks. It&#x27;s my vice. Anyway, even with that maintenance I still have calluses, hardened and thick layers of dead skin. I ordered this thinking it was worth trying. It so was!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to use and put batteries into it. I have had no issues, only success! Also used it on the bottom of my foot where there are a couple hard skin spots. Success, and beautiful feet in time for summer!</li>
    <li> My feet have been torn up for years from ruck marches, running, dancing, and whatever else! I used to get pedicures 2x a month, now I can&#x27;t exactly afford that luxury,  in comes La Pedi Bon to the rescue! My feet have not been this soft and smooth in a while, the kit comes with everything you need minus batteries. 2 AAs later, and soft feet!  I find that you can roll the device in small circular motions, but not in the opposite direction of the spinning part. Also, you do not need to press this into your feet hard at all.  I used this both wet and dry, and haven&#x27;t quite decided which I like more. I am thinking, wet. I soaked my feet in my bathtub, under running water, than used this and rinsed under the running water.  There is a brush to clean off the device. However, the one downside, there isn&#x27;t anything to catch the skin dust/shavings I didn&#x27;t care to see them in the bottom of my bathtub, and it has the potential to make a bit of a mess unless you&#x27;re doing it over a towel, or an area easy to clean.  They even give you a replacement head!!  This is a really great product, and with a small improvement could be the best thing out there... step aside pedi egg, there isn&#x27;t anything Id rather use! product received for review.</li>
    <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this!!! I will never be without my La Pedi Bon! I&#x27;ve had it about a month now and my feet are in great shape! When I started using it I had dry and cracked heels. For the first 2 weeks I used it every other day for just a few minutes. It made my feet so soft. Now I use it about once a week because I don&#x27;t want my feet to get bad again and now my feet now look the best they&#x27;ve looked in a LONG time!!! Highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> Callus remover is one of the most important item that i own. Its a life saver really. I usually have bad dry heels and looks really embarrassing if i wear my flip flops.&lt;br /&gt;But thanks to this product i am always ready with gorgeous smooth feet. Its so easy to use and clean. I love the fact that its battery operated so that you can use it no matter where you go.&lt;br /&gt;Finally i can let go of the old lotion and socks therapy for my feet and let them breathe. It was pretty easy to use it right out of the box. And i love the cool blue color that it is in.&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a nice box and also gives you an extra head and a brush for cleaning. Its really good for gifting too.&lt;br /&gt;I was lucky to get this product under promotion but my opinions are unbiased.</li>
    <li> I have really flat feet and always had foot problems so because of the way that I walk I always have and had dry calloused feet. I usually only get pedicures when the weather begins to get warm but for the time I&#x27;m not in the salon I needed to find something as foot files did very little for me along with the pumice stones. This callous remover works okay. It&#x27;s not amazing for people with alot of hard dry skin on their feet. It also took quite a&lt;br /&gt;few times going over the problem areas&lt;br /&gt;for it to take off close to the desired amount of skin. All in all it is easy to use and it at least does help somewhat. The price is fair for what you get out of it.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome. I bought it at a reduced price for a fair review and live it. I don&#x27;t have much time to care for my feet like I should and this makes it easy. The callus remover comes with a brush, the device and a back up replacement wheel for the device. The curve on the device names it easy to teach either side of your heel. It needs 2AA batteries which powers the strong little motor. You don&#x27;t have to press hard to see it&#x27;s working. Great product for people on the go. Works great!</li>
    <li> Loved the item - worked great.  Super fast delivery and easy ordering!</li>
    <li> Works really well.  Definitely helping with the calluses.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Do you have pretty feet? Ummm, nope would be my answer. Sadly I was not born with beautiful feet. Ask any of my children, you know, the ones that tease me when I wear sandals during the summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the reason for my unsightly feet are because whenever I would go for a pedicure, the technician would bring out the power tools! Sanders, scrapers and something that looked like the mandolin I use in the kitchen! Nope, not happening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So you can imagine how skeptical I was on reviewing a Pedicure Kit. I am happy to report that this device does the job with out all the power tools! Now, it does take longer to reach the same results, but to me...SO WORTH IT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;La P&amp;eacute;di Bon battery operated callus remover is a revolutionary safe device for getting smooth silky skin. It works by removing rough, dry callused skin. Get a spa-quality pedicure experience without ever leaving your home. No appointment necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using the device is easy. Just roll the remover over the tough spots on your feet. It may take successive sessions until your feet feel soft and silky. Repeat treatments when the skin begins to feel hard and callused again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No worries about being too harsh, if too much pressure is used, the device will immediately stop. It&#x27;s easy, safe, quick and amazing results...Silky Feet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still not sure? You can try this without fear because it is backed with a money back guarantee if you are not completely satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Promotional or discounted product provided for review.</li>
    <li> One of the things that I really take good care of are my feet. I was a full blown type 2 diabetic a few years ago and although I have my sugar levels back to normal, I still have to take extra good care of my skin, my eyes and my feet - parts that get affected by diabetes. I love this Foot Callus Remover by La Beaute Pure because it gently removes the calluses from my feet. Not only are my feet healthy and callus-free...they&#x27;re also beautiful and ready for the spring and summer months!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.
