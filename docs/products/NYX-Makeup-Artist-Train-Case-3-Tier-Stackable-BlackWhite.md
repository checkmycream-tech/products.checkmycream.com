      <li>My daughter love it</li>
      <li>love it and it has a lot of room for everything</li>
      <li>I say that for the value of the product it shoulda been better stedyer and had more items with it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a pet groomer and love this case for my tools.</li>
      <li>This is such a great addition to any make up addicts collection!</li>
      <li>the end I do recommend it :)</li>
      <li>I would say overall this is one of the best bags I have ever had.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s more than enough room in this great makeup artist bag!  </li>
      <li>I love this bag and it is very useful.</li>
      <li>Good but Would be better if the middle part with the trays could have the option of being on top.</li>
      <li>and i have tons of make up inside including my airbrush machine and its as good as new.</li>
      <li>fantastic, fantastic, fantastic.</li>
      <li>but i need it to be light</li>
      <li>Made of cheap material</li>
      <li>So far good...</li>
      <li>As a makeup artist I love this case, you can fit everything in it and it is pretty steadt.</li>
      <li>nothing special, nothing special.</li>
      <li>but it has a lot of useful compartments.</li>
      <li>would give out pretty quickly.  </li>
      <li>Thanks for being concerned and replacing the original order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I really wish it was better, because it is a great design, but poorly executed.</li>
      <li>what a amazing staff that can be work for my career in the long time.</li>
      <li>Also, it&#x27;s a bit large for traveling far distances on a train and not airplane safe</li>
      <li>thing that i love is that it has a handle on each side of the case so you can lifted from there when its to heavy, the handle on the top its not that resistant, so i recommend to lifted from the side all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I do not know what to say, a normal product, nothing special.</li>
      <li>I wish this was a lot better, especially for the $200 price tag.</li>
      <li>so now I have everything in one case makes transport so much easier!</li>
      <li>The first order was lost.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth the money, highly recommend, a MUST HAVE for any MUA!</li>
      <li>But I ordered the shiny cosmetics rolling case after returning this, seems much easier to keep organized and only a bit more on the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>But I would not say that the train case is amazing and I will buy a smaller case which is easier to take along to smaller</li>
      <li>The case is Very Heavy!!!&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
      <li>However the case is somewhat heavier that expected, and probably needs better locking system.</li>
      <li>Very space efficient.</li>
      <li>She absolutely loves it...</li>
      <li>and she absolutely loves it.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;d be very worried about flying with it.</li>
      <li>thanks 👌</li>
      <li>The pouches it comes with are really durable, and I still use those.</li>
      <li>Very roomy.</li>
      <li>No to mention that it is about 30 pounds on its own, then adding all of your makeup and tools, this is ridiculously heavy.</li>
      <li>The soft case I love better than the hard metal ones!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for the first few times being used, then... I have had this Case for less than a year, and it is already falling apart.</li>
      <li>and it looks very professional</li>
      <li>Other than being incredibly heavy, it was easy to use, super convenient, and has SO much space.</li>
      <li>Only one of the locks work, the strap that keeps the top two tiers attached to the handle has ripped off, the metal on the bottom tier has been warped and bent because the telescoping handle pulls it when the case is filled with all of my makeup and tools, and it&#x27;s impossible to clean.</li>
      <li>Majorly regret buying this when I could&#x27;ve spent maybe $50 more to get something that would ACTUALLY last.</li>
      <li>most cause it weighs half the weight of most other plastic hard cases</li>
      <li>Delivery was very fast as I received it before expected date.</li>
      <li>super heavy</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s HIGH QUALITY, extremely durable, and looks very professional.</li>
      <li>My fellow MUA got 4 of the clear bags and when I ordered I only received 2 of them.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The top part is really really thin, I thought if would be larger.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
      <li>There is tons and tons of room for products in each compartment, a separate compartment to store brushes, 4 individual bags to store: foundation, concealer, powders, or other loose product, tons of space to store full palettes, and 4 zippered pockets on the sides of the train case as extra storage.</li>

<li> The only downside I would have to say is it is a little on the heavy side compared to others</li>
<li> The extendable  handle seems a little flimsy</li>
<li> It is heavy like everyone says.</li>
<li> Not too heavy to maneuver with products placed</li>
<li> The clasps broke after a few weeks.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s lighter than a hard case but is still on the heavy side without any product inside</li>
<li> Wear comfy shoes while lugging it around because you&#x27;re looking at a small workout.</li>
<li> They seem weak and may buckle.</li>
<li> I am not impressed.</li>

    <li> fantastic, fantastic, fantastic.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my daughter who is a make-up artist...She absolutely loves it...Loves how everything comes apart and great storage</li>
    <li> I would say overall this is one of the best bags I have ever had. Good quality. The only downside I would have to say is it is a little on the heavy side compared to others but it has a lot of useful compartments. Wear comfy shoes while lugging it around because you&#x27;re looking at a small workout.</li>
    <li> ROOMY AND WONDERFUL! This is such a great addition to any make up addicts collection! You will love it! Promise!</li>
    <li> Very rare I write comments, but had to for the sake of not letting another consumer purchase this disappointment I immediately returned this, didn&#x27;t even try to put my items in.  I wanted a case that could hold all of my makeup and hair products/styling tools and possibly toiletries depending on the room leftover.  The cases/pouches shown in the pictures did not come with either.  Made of cheap material and I could tell the wheels and handle would give out pretty quickly.  It&#x27;s also MASSIVE.  So you would likely have to check in on the airplane, which I like to keep my cosmetics with me to avoid breaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say this is for personal use, not professional, so maybe a MUA would have a different opinion.  But I ordered the shiny cosmetics rolling case after returning this, seems much easier to keep organized and only a bit more on the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GIEK89U/ref&#x3D;ox_sc_act_title_2?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1&amp;smid&#x3D;ATVPDKIKX0DER</li>
    <li> So far good... Only had it for a month. Very roomy. Hope it lasts me long. Guess we&#x27;ll see ...</li>
    <li> My daughter love it she is a makeup artist</li>
    <li> Excellent traveling makeup case. Delivery was very fast as I received it before expected date. Very large and spacious and great for organizing. It&#x27;s lighter than a hard case but is still on the heavy side without any product inside but it&#x27;s sturdy. The back handle is a bit weak for how large the case is once it is extended all the way. Also, it&#x27;s a bit large for traveling far distances on a train and not airplane safe but it&#x27;s perfect for cars and on location.</li>
    <li> Love it! I was struggling to find a case that could fit everything I needed and this is perfect! Only had it a month but so far awesome!</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s more than enough room in this great makeup artist bag!  The extendable  handle seems a little flimsy and I&#x27;d be very worried about flying with it. But for putting it in my car to travel for a job it&#x27;s GREAT!</li>
    <li> The compartments are well designed with ample space. However the case is somewhat heavier that expected, and probably needs better locking system.</li>
    <li> Everything is perfect except you have to be careful how you lift but everything else is perfect it&#x27;s nice and sturdy and it doesn&#x27;t tip when you roll it. I&#x27;m VERY happy I chose this case it has a log of space and it looks very professional</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great for the first few times being used, then... I have had this Case for less than a year, and it is already falling apart. Only one of the locks work, the strap that keeps the top two tiers attached to the handle has ripped off, the metal on the bottom tier has been warped and bent because the telescoping handle pulls it when the case is filled with all of my makeup and tools, and it&#x27;s impossible to clean. No to mention that it is about 30 pounds on its own, then adding all of your makeup and tools, this is ridiculously heavy. The side handles are also placed in such an awkward position and the telescoping handle is awkwardly short, so it hurts my back to walk with for too long (and I&#x27;m only 5&#x27;4&amp;#34;). I have only used it on maybe a dozen jobs, and I refuse to use it anymore. I really wish it was better, because it is a great design, but poorly executed. Other than being incredibly heavy, it was easy to use, super convenient, and has SO much space. The pouches it comes with are really durable, and I still use those. I wish this was a lot better, especially for the $200 price tag. Majorly regret buying this when I could&#x27;ve spent maybe $50 more to get something that would ACTUALLY last.</li>
    <li> Product works great and is better then most cause it weighs half the weight of most other plastic hard cases</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a make up artist and i bought this case because i wanted something bigger than the one i have but i need it to be light weighted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it and it has a lot of room for everything but i had to remove the middle section because it make the case to heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;other thing that i love is that it has a handle on each side of the case so you can lifted from there when its to heavy, the handle on the top its not that resistant, so i recommend to lifted from the side all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wheels work perfectly and its really resistant, i bought it on December 2011 and i have tons of make up inside including my airbrush machine and its as good as new.</li>
    <li> I bought this train case while on sale in another store and payed 100 USD for it which is a GREAT price (its does not have the NYX-logo but is the same bag)! As a makeup artist I love this case, you can fit everything in it and it is pretty steadt. But I would not say that the train case is amazing and I will buy a smaller case which is easier to take along to smaller gigs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part is that you can divide the case..as someone else wrote is the middle part super heavy so its really nice to be able to take it out. The bottom part is amazing and a love love love the 4 transparent bags that you get.&lt;br /&gt;The top part is really really thin, I thought if would be larger.&lt;br /&gt;In the end I do recommend it :)</li>
    <li> AMAZING!!! I am in love, this is a MUA&#x27;s dream train case! All three levels come off and lock back on with side locks, and it comes with a set of keys to lock the train case. There is tons and tons of room for products in each compartment, a separate compartment to store brushes, 4 individual bags to store: foundation, concealer, powders, or other loose product, tons of space to store full palettes, and 4 zippered pockets on the sides of the train case as extra storage. It&#x27;s HIGH QUALITY, extremely durable, and looks very professional. I cannot praise this train case enough! It&#x27;s worth the money, highly recommend, a MUST HAVE for any MUA!</li>
    <li> As a mechanich over Tiffany&amp;co. I say that for the value of the product it shoulda been better stedyer and had more items with it. But my wife is happy with it so i cant complain...</li>
    <li> I have a lot of Makeup, it packs well. Cases feel sturdy, my only concern is if the pull will hold up.The case is Very Heavy!!!&lt;br /&gt;Will keep you all posted.&lt;br /&gt;Just started using the case.</li>
    <li> what a amazing staff that can be work for my career in the long time. im happy that. like it</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s much bigger than I imagined and it&#x27;s not very well constructed. The clasps broke after a few weeks. Would not recommend buying if your a makeup artist that travels often.</li>
    <li> Good but Would be better if the middle part with the trays could have the option of being on top. It is open so this cannot happen. It is heavy like everyone says.</li>
    <li> Very space efficient. Not too heavy to maneuver with products placed inside.&lt;br /&gt;Very careful to ensure not to over extend handle with twisting motions. They seem weak and may buckle.</li>
    <li> I love this bag and it is very useful. I recommend this bag to any makeup artist . It has enough space for everything</li>
    <li> My fellow MUA got 4 of the clear bags and when I ordered I only received 2 of them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a pet groomer and love this case for my tools.</li>
    <li> I am a hairstylist and was looking for a case to hold all my stuff unfortuneately they don&#x27;t make one for hairstylist so I saw someone with this one I ordered it and I love it! It holds everything so now I have everything in one case makes transport so much easier!</li>
    <li> The first order was lost. The second order was delivered on time. My daughter used it and says it works for her.  It holds what she needs to carry with her.  Thanks for being concerned and replacing the original order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may purchase one for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;D. P.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s perfect to keep all the make up tools for my wife&#x27;s job</li>
    <li> I bought this Train Case for my daughter who is a make up artist and she absolutely loves it. It has plenty of space and organizing dividers.  And the quality is excellent.</li>
    <li> I do not know what to say, a normal product, nothing special. I am not impressed. nothing special, nothing special.</li>
    <li> Everythin is good and the shipment in it best condition, thanks 👌</li>
    <li> I love it!!!! The soft case I love better than the hard metal ones! it&#x27;s super nice and had all its perfect to fit all I need for my freelanced jobs;)</li>
