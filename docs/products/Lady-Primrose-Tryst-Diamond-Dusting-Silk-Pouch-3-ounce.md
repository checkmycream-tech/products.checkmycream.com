    <li> I use this not only as body powder but sprinkle some in the sheets to keep them fresh and it smells WONDERFUL and feels silky just like the description says :)  Have used this for a few years now and plan to continue to, LOVE IT!!! :)</li>
    <li> I have been using this powder for several years. A dash onto the tummy and I&#x27;m good to go for the day! It&#x27;s subtle and refreshing. A great way to start the day. Have to have it!</li>
    <li> This dusting powder has a great name, \\&quot;dusting silk\\&quot;.  That&#x27;s how it feels on your skin.  The smell is wonderful too.  I gave this as a Christmas present to my daughters-in-law and they loved it.  Amazon makes it so easy to find everything I need in one place.  I&#x27;ve never been disappointed.</li>
    <li> The best smelling dusting silk powder anywhere. Its not cheap but you really get what you pay for! I love this stuff</li>
    <li> Bought for the wife for Christmas and it was just what she wanted. Made it easy for me which is always good.</li>
    <li> I found the scent completely overpowering. I gagged when I opened the shipping box!</li>
    <li> I love the scent and it actually improves my skin.  I think the recipe may have changed.  When I first bought it at Vermont Country Store the description mentioned that it contained mica.Since VCS no longer carries it I googled and found the product site.  That site doesn&#x27;t mention mica.  I hope it is the same.</li>
    <li> Unlike my discontent with the Tryst Parfum Mist I was sent, the powder is the same wonderful light powder. It is totally awesome sprinkled on your sheets before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This site had the best price I could find.</li>
    <li> I have 2 of the brushes that I use the refill dusting talc to fill. I just love everything about this product -- the smell, the silkiness, the sparkle.  Only think that I wish they&#x27;d improve upon is how to get this into the handle of the brush.  I always end of spilling it all over the bathroom.</li>
    <li> Why keep buying the glass bottle over again??  This is how I will get the powder from now on.. Thank you..</li>
    <li> I like sprinkling the powder on my sheets.  It gives a nice subtle fragrance.  I&#x27;d probably buy the bottle next time, because it seems to last longer than the refill did.</li>
    <li> This powder smells eloquent and the shine is just wonderful.</li>
    <li> I totally love this powder...I highly recommend it...Smells so good...</li>
