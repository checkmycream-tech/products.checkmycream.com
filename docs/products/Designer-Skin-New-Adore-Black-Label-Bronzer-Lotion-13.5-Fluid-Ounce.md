<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Mine didn&#x27;t come sealed like a lot of other reviewers said theirs did (which disappointed me a little), but it appears to be the full/not messed just the same. I gave this product 5 stars. Besides the awesome color and amazing price (this was going for 100$ with 40% off at my local salon) it smells great and not at all like a tanning bed lotion (which many compare to cleaning supplies), doesn&#x27;t leave an oily feeling after, goes on really smooth, not sticky, and doesnt make my skin break out after. Love it!!</li>
    <li> Great! Product arrived on time, and worked great!</li>
    <li> Product delivered quickly and had great results.</li>
    <li> Wonderfully smooth for application and did seem to deliver a rich, even tan without burning.</li>
    <li> Smells like women&#x27;s perfume</li>
    <li> I liked it but not sure if I will order it again</li>
    <li> Exactly like the one at the salon but so much cheaper.</li>
    <li> love it best price best product the tanning salons rip you off! this was amazing</li>
    <li> Super fast delivery, sealed, consistency and results as expected. Read lots of reviews from tanning salon employees claiming only expired/old product sold on Amazon. Even if there is truth to this, my results have been beyond expected. No orange color, no need to wipe hands after application, even color all over, light, yet creamy consistency. Not oily, no super-overpowering after tan smell. Great results in 3 sessions (I had a 3 session very light base tan prior). Highly recommend, especially  for the price. Would purchase  again.</li>
    <li> It did not darken the skin at all.  There was no expiration date on the bottle.  A youtube presentation said that a internet purchase may have this problem.  Very very disappointing.</li>
    <li> Great product! 70 dollars at amazing tans</li>
    <li> Great smell. My tan looks great and I get compliments all the time.</li>
    <li> Love it! I have yet to buy Designer Skin lotion that would not exceed my expectations.</li>
    <li> Love the smell of the lotion.  It&#x27;s not overpowering.  And I get great deals on amazon.  My favorite site to shop! !</li>
    <li> Great product and I get a beautiful glow to my skin after tanning</li>
    <li> My favorite tanning lotion by far. I love the scent and I love how quickly I see a difference in color.</li>
    <li> Smell isn&#x27;t that great but it did not leave a sticky feeling.</li>
    <li> Used this only one time, today being my first time, and I am already seeing color! I was going to buy elusive but this was a more reasonable price for my budget, and I&#x27;m definitely pleased with it!</li>
    <li> Great product ..exact same thing sold in Sun Tan City for over $100 dollars.. great quality and a fabulous tan.</li>
    <li> Texture and smell light and clean</li>
    <li> O my gosh,  I&#x27;m so pale this lotion had me 8X darker!</li>
    <li> awesome lotion would recommend for anyone</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted! Fast shipment</li>
    <li> I just started tanning again recently to get a nice tan before summer. Needless to say after only 6 times at the tanning salon with this lotion I have a nice even tan that&#x27;s decently dark. I have always preferred Designer Skin products over any other brand and they have once again impressed me. Luminary and obsidian used to be my go to lotions to get dark however this lotion has blown both of them out of the water in terms of how quickly I have developed a nice even tan. The smell is okay. There&#x27;s still a slight after tan odor but it&#x27;s not terrible by any means. It moisturizes my skin pretty well which is a plus considering tanning will dry your skin out quick... Bottom line is the color I&#x27;ve received from this lotion is very impressive. If you are looking for a good quality lotion then I highly suggest you give this one a try.</li>
    <li> Awesome product ... makes my skin so soft</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this tanning lotion. I usually only buy Designer Skin. This one is probably my favorite and I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> smells so good and keeps me so dark!</li>
    <li> So much cheeper than buying the exact same bottle at the tanning salon and works just as good.. the lady at the salon tried to tell me it wasn&#x27;t the same but it is</li>
    <li> wow! I&#x27;m impressed, I was so scared to buy this/any indoor tanning lotion online but this is the real deal! It came packed perfectly sealed and it came QUICK!!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this tanning lotion and this seller! I will definitely be repurchasing :)</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Doesn&#x27;t make me streaky and it smells nice! Will buy again!</li>
    <li> SAME THING AS IN MY SALON</li>
    <li> This is amazing! It smells great and gives me great color!</li>
    <li> Have not seen a huge difference in using this vs no tanning lotion, HOWEVER, It conditions great, a little goes a long way (lasts forever), reduces the risk of wrinkles and dryness, and smells wonderful. I would buy again over other natural bronzers. (I am not a fan of cosmetic bronzer lotions... who leaves on tanning cream all day after running to the tanning bed... no need for messy dark bronzers.)</li>
    <li> Love the smell and received it rather quick used it like three times so far pleased with the out come so far</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times but I have no complaints against it. The price is right compared to the salons price.  I&#x27;m happy w it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this item a total of 3 times and I have a gorgeous golden brown tan. I Would and Will buy this item again (&#x3D;</li>
    <li> Smells great and makes your skin super soft! Love it!</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion after hearing many many good things. I was confident it would give me the golden tan I wanted but sadly it didn&#x27;t. I&#x27;ve seen absolutely no results at all. I normally tan well with any lotion but for some reason I couldn&#x27;t with this one. It left me wondering if the lotion in the bottle isn&#x27;t really the Adore lotion? Has anyone else gotten no results from a lotion sold by TheTanMan?&lt;br /&gt;I try again and again but nothing. Such a waste of money :( I&#x27;m extremely disappointed.</li>
    <li> I like the smell of this lotion as well as the fact that I don&#x27;t have that after burn smell when done tanning.  I have noticed that my skin is tanning easier now than when I uses other lotions.  Plus you can&#x27;t beat the price compared to buying at my local tanning salon which sells for over $100!!!  Crazy!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen other reviews that say this product is a fake but I really don&#x27;t think it is. I&#x27;ve purchased designer skin products from tanning salons before and this product seems identical. Even if it is fake I would still recommend it because it works great and is about 1/3 the price the tanning salons charge! I really like how this lotion feels, it isn&#x27;t greasy/waxy like some other lotions but actually absorbs into your skin and feels really soft. You will see a big difference after one use. The only thing I don&#x27;t live is how strong the smell is, it does a good job of hiding the post tanning smell but it gets to be overpowering after a few hours.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best tanning lotion I have ever owned. I have tried a lot of designer skin lotions and this one has out shined them all! It gives you such a deep, dark tan not a icky orange one like most others do.</li>
    <li> The shipping was amazing, as always. I have 2 day delivery with my prime membership and it arrived on time and packaged the way a new bottle of lotion should be. It smells exactly the same as in the salon (a light vanilla musk with some floral undertones), it has the same viscosity as the salon, and works amazing - as expected. I will continue to order from this company and as always, Designer Skin has some of the best indoor tanning bronzing creams ever! I would definitely recommend this to a friend!</li>
    <li> I have been buying samples of this lotion and finally I ordered it. It is the same as the one in the tanning salon. It has a nice smell and makes your skin feel soft and smooth. I get excellent color from this. I highly recommend this lotion! You are so better off ordering it through here...you&#x27;ll save so much money!! I have ordered a few different bottles through this site, they are legit. I have never had any problems and you get your oder fast, earlier then it tells you. You wont be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I have a hard time getting past a certain shade when tanning, or my tan will usually fade fast. Since using this lotion my tan is staying a lot longer if i don&#x27;t tan for a few days you can&#x27;t even tell. But if I tan regularly i get extremely dark. And the smell is good as well, pretty mild.</li>
    <li> I have read many reviews claiming that some lotions ordered online are not the same compared to the same lotion bought in the salon.  I personally did not have an issue with this lotion.  Comparing it to the same bottle in the salon, I couldn&#x27;t tell a difference.  I tan usually 2-3 times a week and have not had a problem with this lotion turning orange or leaving spots.  The smell of the lotion is clean and refreshing and maybe a little fruity- you don&#x27;t leave the tanning bed smelling gross.  I would recommend this lotion to anyone who is looking to buy decently priced lotion!</li>
    <li> Love how dark I get with this! I have very fair skin and this lotion cut out the building color process so I saw results after just a few uses.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure why it asks about how often it needs to be applied but anyways I love this lotion.  Works great!</li>
    <li> My new favorite. Smells fantastic before and after and gives me awesome color. Also doesn&#x27;t make my skin greasy like other lotions tend to do.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! After only two times in the bed in a very long time I have a nice healthy glow</li>
    <li> This was my first designer skin product and I have to say I&#x27;m hooked! This lotion has a really pretty, not too overpowering scent,  which continues to smell pleasant after tanning. This lotion goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t feel like you even put anything on, so you don&#x27;t feel gross all day. I had instant noticeable color.  I over all love everything about this product, and will definitely stay within the Designer Skin family. I recommend to anyone thinking about trying this product to buy it!</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE BEST PRODUCT I HAVE USED!! I NOTICED RESULTS IMMEDIATELY. I AM TWO SHADES DARKER WITH JUST ONE APPLICATION. THE SMELL IS AWESOME, WITH NO ATO:) WHICH IS A HUGE PLUS. IT IS NOT GREASY, AND IT GOES ON SMOOTH. IT DOES NOT LEAVE STREAKS AND IF YOU ARE LIKE ME AND OCCASIONALLY FORGET TO WIPE YOUR HANDS, IT WILL NOT TURN THEM ORANGE. I WILL BUY THIS AGAIN, ONCE I RUN OUT. AND YES, I DEFINITELY WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO A FRIEND..AND THEIR FRIENDS AS WELL.</li>
    <li> I experienced my quickest result using this lotion.  I would highly recommend this lotion. A bonus it does not leave a lingering smell. Not one person has called me out for smelling like the beach like my other lotions. Which is a positive for me.</li>
    <li> I only like specific Designer Skin products because I feel I don&#x27;t get as dark as I normally do when going with a Designer Skin product. I feel like most of the lotions are just for skin care. But I must say this bronzer is spectacular. I noticed instant color as soon as I got out of the bed. If you are well known with Designer Skin products, some of my favorites are Black Noir, Designer, Conceited and Elusive. This one I feel is my new favorite. The fragrance is a very light warm vanilla musk, it also takes the after tan odor (ATO) out immediately. I highly recommend this lotion for anyone who has great color already and wants to get darker. I will most defenitly be buying this product again!!!</li>
    <li> Good smell, applys easily, decent moisturizer, although I only use it for tanning, not for my daily moisturizer. No weird after tanning smell or streaks.</li>
    <li> Has a nice smell, goes on smooth. Gives a nice color after only a few uses. All I can ask for.</li>
    <li> Like this lotion and it smells great. Keeps you from getting that after tanning smell. The smell continues to stay pleasant until you wash it off.</li>
    <li> I really recommend this lotion if you are trying to get past your tanning plateau.. after just 2 sessions I felt like a bronze goddess!!!</li>
    <li> So I loooked at this product at the tanning salon I use and it was over $100. Outrageous I think! So of course I came to Amazon to chek prices and was surprised to find it for under 40, SOLD! My girl friend said a lot of times these companies who sell the lotions for super cheap are taking half the product out and refilling with cheap body loion. Shes a formre tanning associate and tested my lotion. NOT FAKE or altered!!! I love saving money!! And over 50% cheaper is awesome!!!</li>
    <li> Smelling the difference between one at the tanning salon and the stuff that I bought online not the same and it doesn&#x27;t seem to have the same effect as the old one did.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! I have been tanning with an intensifier and finally decided to go ahead and purchase a bronzer. The girl at my tanning bed recommended this product; however, I was not willing to spend the money at the tanning bed. Great price on Amazon!</li>
    <li> Love it!! Awesome results after just the first use. Will continue buying! :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read a few other reviews of people seeing results after one tanning session, I did not. However after using for a week (tanning every other day), I can my skin tone gradually getting some color back. I really like that this product does not leave my skin feeling dehydrated after use and it has a subtle aroma.</li>
    <li> I was a little worried buying lotion online as I used to manage a tanning salon and our warehouse told us horror stories about buying online and getting watered down product, fakes, or expired stuff. But I got this and not only was it in perfect condition but it smells great and is no doubt 100% the real stuff. Makes my skin incredibly soft after tanning. It&#x27;s not sticky, it hasn&#x27;t left an oily residue, and it smells awesome even after the tanning bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this all over including on my face and it hasn&#x27;t made me break out - in fact it cleared my skin a little. I think that&#x27;s mostly due to the tanning bed but the lotion helps avoid dry skin and uneven tones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice as someone who spent a long time in the industry is DO NOT INDOOR TAN WITHOUT A QUALITY LOTION. And this is a quality lotion , just like most Designer Skin products.</li>
    <li> I like this tanning lotion. My skin feels good after I sun bathe and it smells much better than some of the other lotions that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion and only wish I would have looked on Amazon first before purchasing at my local tanning salon!  I paid double what it is on Amazon at the salon and based on the other reviews, there&#x27;s no difference.  I have used the lotion for nearly a week now and love the way it feels going on, love the color I&#x27;ve already gotten by using it and love that I don&#x27;t seem to carry that &amp;#34;just been tanning&amp;#34; smell after tanning.  I think this lotion must have a neutralizer or something in it.  I have fair skin and definitely need to build a base tan and this has made the process much easier!  Good purchase, even if it wasn&#x27;t from Amazon this time :-(.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion. It smells great and makes me really dark! Also, it&#x27;s not super heavy weight so I don&#x27;t feel like I need a shower after.</li>
    <li> The smell is not for me. It is very nice stuff. It did have a tinge of self tanner smell in it. I use other designer skin products and love them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied!!!!  I&#x27;m looking and feeling very healthy. The lotion gives my body a beautiful glow that I always wanted!!</li>
    <li> Lotion is just ok I personally wouldn&#x27;t order again. I prefer black 20x.</li>
    <li> product met expectations for a fraction of the cost that the tanning salon wanted. Smells good too.</li>
    <li> Good product but not really sold on it!</li>
    <li> As expected, smells great</li>
    <li> This lotion has aided in my tan becoming a true rich brown color quickly. It is easy to apply and has a great smell! Another benefit is that you can use i outside.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion! Amazing smell with no ATO. Wonderful color boost. Feels amazing on my skin.</li>
    <li> Saved a lot by buying here rather than locally. Silky smooth good quality lotion.</li>
    <li> Excellent product - great price.</li>
    <li> Did not get as dark as this would lead you to believe.</li>
    <li> I ordered this lotion late last week when it finally arrived I immediately went to my tanning salon and used it. It is now not even 2 hours after I went tanning and I look at least 4 shades darker and I was tanning on a regular basis before this lotion. I am beyond happy with the results!! If you want a great lotion for a good price this is the lotion for you. Totally got me to beat my plateau stage!&lt;br /&gt;Safe to say I will be buying another bottle here when I run out!! :)</li>
    <li> bought this for tanning in door but have been using in pool would like it to tanner a little better but its not greasy i am italian so i tan well.. but its good and great price sae it for 105.00 at tanning parlor so great price</li>
    <li> This is my first time to ever leave a review,  I&#x27;m already dark and I wanted to get a deeper base tan so I could tan once a week, I have been tanning for years and have tried everything from $150.00 moxie to $9.99 Wal mart  and I never thought I would have the results that I got  from just the 1st time using the Adore,  if you want to get dark buy this I&#x27;m so tired of wasting  money and buying products that do not work, this is absolutely fantastic and amazing.</li>
    <li> Perfect would buy again in a minute</li>
    <li> Smells gr8, worked fine. Good purchase.  :-)</li>
    <li> Wonderful Product! :)</li>
    <li> I was skeptical, considering my tanning salon sells this for $124 that this was in fact the real lotion.  I called the manufacturer to verify and sure enough, it was the real stuff!  No more getting ripped off at the tanning salon!</li>
    <li> The best I have ever used. It gives a deep natural and airbrushed look of perfection.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is minimal as well which is nice.</li>
    <li> I think it works pretty good. I&#x27;m having to use different leg bronzer with it because my legs aren&#x27;t tanning as well as the rest of me.  It smells really good! You don&#x27;t smell like burnt skin after tanning. I would buy it again</li>
    <li> Love this lotion!!! Great for indoor or outdoor tanning. Paid a lot less for it on Amazon than it was in tanning salons</li>
    <li> This is more like an accelerator than a bronzer.  It claims to be x21 but doesn&#x27;t even work as well as my x4 I have,  very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great product, doesn&#x27;t streak or turn me colors....just wish it was a higher bronzer.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizing lotion, skin feels silky after tanning. Nice bronzer.  Smells really nice. Doesn&#x27;t leave you with the baked skin smell.</li>
    <li> NICE SMELL BUT I GOT NO COLOR FROM IT.</li>
    <li> This lotion has a nice bronzing color (does not make you skin orange). It accelerates the process so you can see results in as little as 3 tans. It also conditions your skin so it feels very soft. It smells like a light perfume, but it is not overwhelmingly strong like some tanning lotions. I would recommend!</li>
    <li> The tanning salon rep insisted that I could not get &amp;#34;real product&amp;#34; outside the salon.  This product made a big difference for me - especially on my legs where I didn&#x27;t seem to tan.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I have been tanning for years and have used basically every product that is out there today including multiple lotions by Designer Skin. This is by far the best Designer Skin lotion I have used to date. Not only does it smell amazing, but it leaves my skin feeling extremely soft and doesn&#x27;t leave a funky after tan smell. I noticed myself getting significantly darker after just a few times using this lotion. I will absolutely be buying this product again.</li>
    <li> Applies smooth and smells great</li>
    <li> The scent is nice -- doesn&#x27;t smell like other lotions I&#x27;ve used, especially the sunless tanning lotions you buy in stores .  I used for the first time last night &amp; was very pleased with the color I got --  and I&#x27;ve only started tanning (this year) a little over a week ago.  Didn&#x27;t stain my clothing at all and I LOVE the silicone !!</li>
    <li> This lotion is PHENOMENAL! The color might be more gradual than some other lotions, but it lasts longer and looks natural and almost flawless! It is also very nourishing for the skin!</li>
    <li> By far the best tanning lotion I have used!! It leaves your skin feeling silky! If you use this lotion and lay in a bronzing bed, you will have immediate color. I have a gorgeous tan thanks to this product!!</li>
    <li> Wow I am so happy I purchased this! My skin changed at least 3-4 shades darker in just 2 tanning sessions! It smells so good before and after. It also leaves my skin feeling super soft. My tanning salon said this is one of their top lotions, and it cost $80 there! I am so glad I got this wonderful lotion for such a great price. I will be buying again. :)</li>
    <li> My favorite tanning lotion</li>
    <li> Must have just got a bad batch or bottle... Lotion does not give me color whatsoever... I tan in the bronze beds and still no results... Probably will not buy again...</li>
    <li> Great light clean smell, great deep natural bronzers, awesome matte finish, you definitely can see the results after you tan.  Adore and Luminary are two of the best tanning lotions out there in my opinion.</li>
    <li> My local salon wanted to charge over $100 for this exact lotion- even on their 40%off sale it was still over $60.  This bottle I received is the same smell and consistency as the salon bottle, so I don&#x27;t doubt it is the real (and untampered with) thing.  It smells a little like vanilla, but mostly fruity (almost peach) to me.  VERY nice!  I would use it everyday just as lotion!  Great color-not fake and no ATO.  Highly recommended</li>
    <li> Boy does this stuff work! If you have a hard time tanning, this will get you over that &amp;#34;tanning plateau.&amp;#34; I worked in a tanning salon for 5 years and have never been disappointed by Designer Skin products. Smells awesome, has shimmer to make you look glimmery, and hey, it&#x27;ll get you tan. Wash your hands after because it does have bronzers, but not a crazy amount. Gives amazing color, get your summer on.</li>
    <li> ♡ this lotion! Smells amazing and no terrible ato. Produces great color without too much bronzer and no orange streaking. I am normally very light skinned and this lotion is my go to bronzer.</li>
    <li> This lotion is awesome! I don&#x27;t tan very good because I have fair skin and the first time I used this lotion I could tell a difference! Also smells wonderful.  And it doesn&#x27;t leave the nasty after tan smell! My new favorite!</li>
    <li> I was so excited to use this lotion, but I was very disappointed with the smell. It smells like cheap perfume. The lotion gave me a headache after rubbing it in hands to smell. SOOO STRONG!!!! Definitely returning…such a disappointment.</li>
    <li> Can I return this? It makes my skin feel itchy and dry and doesn&#x27;t give me any color. Really not satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> Received on time and I&#x27;m pleased with results even after one tan! With all of the great reviews, I couldn&#x27;t resist but to buy!  It&#x27;s a little more liquidy than the sample I tried @ my salon but it worked, and I can tell I&#x27;m darker! Everyone tans different so.. I&#x27;m simply saying it worked great for me (medium-fair skinned). Can&#x27;t wait to see the results after tan 2!</li>
    <li> Expected a better smelling product, but worked ok.</li>
    <li> Not worth the money. Ok smell and smooth on the skin. Absolutely not a tanning helper! Does not work for me at all. Not even in the tanning salon!!</li>
    <li> This goes on soooo smooth and has a great fragrance.</li>
    <li> Like the lotion but doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well as Solid Black, too pricey</li>
    <li> I personally LOVE adore out of all the Designer Skin products. I have used 20+ other products and nothing had gotten me darker faster than Adore. Adore lasted very long on my skin so i did need to tan more than once or twice a week! I work at a tanning salon and would recommend this to a majority of our clients(:</li>
    <li> This bronzer is nice. It isn&#x27;t really any better than some of the others I&#x27;ve used from Designer Skin in the past. It is giving me what I want so I&#x27;m happy with it. The smell is very mild and it doesn&#x27;t leave streaks or dry my skin out. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Love the smell. Last a long time after. Compared it to the one we have at our salon and smells identical.</li>
    <li> after reading many reviews about different lotions i chose this one but after using it for 2 weeks straight at a tanning salon I&#x27;m not seeing any results, i had black noir by designer skin before and it was amazing but this lotion just isn&#x27;t the same</li>
    <li> one of my favorite tanning lotions i&#x27;ve ever used!  smells great and gives you a great bronze color even after a few times!</li>
    <li> So far I love it!! I recommend this to anyone who loved tanning as much as I do</li>
    <li> I was really excited to get this lotion... I thought it was going to be excellent like all the other designer skin products I&#x27;ve used. I was very disappointed... Lotion was very thick and didn&#x27;t rub in easily. I used it for almost a week and saw no results, which was quite perplexing to me because it says it has quick sun color tint for instant color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Couldn&#x27;t find the expiration date on the bottle, so maybe it was expired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as designer skin lotions go, I would highly recommend black legacy (for advanced tanners), and black noir. Those are my 2 favorites. The classic &#x27;Black&#x27; and luminary are awesome as well.</li>
    <li> It is the real deal at a faction of the cost of those sold in a tanning business</li>
    <li> Great price super fast shipping.&lt;br /&gt;Love it!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this lotion. They use natural bronzers, the smell is subtle and nice, and it&#x27;s not too heavy. My new favorite DS lotion! It doesn&#x27;t turn you orange, and it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy like some lotions. I would definitely recommend it. I&#x27;ve never received bad lotion from Amazon, but you can&#x27;t always be sure with 3rd party sellers so don&#x27;t take the chance just to save a buck!</li>
    <li> Love designer skin. This is a better price than a tanning salon employee gets. Tan fast and better for skin</li>
    <li> I really like this lotion a lot.  I have tried several and I think so far this is my favorite.  It smells so good and a little bit goes a long way.  I will definitely purchase this again.</li>
    <li> LOVE this tanning lotion. Smells so good. Works well.</li>
    <li> After one try my skin was significantly darker. My patients told me I had a healthy glow!</li>
    <li> Love it! Smells great and awesome color!</li>
    <li> Great Tanning lotion, actually liked it better than any of the jwoww lotions and you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> Great bronzer lotion and a lovely smell.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion! It smells good, no ATO. You can see a difference in your color right out of the bed.</li>
    <li> Nice scent, works great!</li>
    <li> It smell&#x27;s great and leaves my skin feeling soft.</li>
    <li> Designer skin has also been my favorite line. This lotion sold at my tanner for nearly triple the price posted on Amazon. I got good color from this lotion but nothing spectacular. Smells great and feels amazing too. When compared to the Black lotion, this comes in second.</li>
    <li> If you want to get dark fast, this is the lotion you need! It smells amazing and doesn&#x27;t leave a funny after tan smell on you.</li>
    <li> Love it not a fake product, it would have been $110 at my tanning salon. I always buy my tanning products from Amazon.</li>
    <li> This tanning lotion is awesome! It smells so good and it doesn&#x27;t leave any streaks behind! The thing that was most attractive to was was the melanin enhancer.  The only reason it didn&#x27;t get 5 stars is because it didn&#x27;t get me as tan as I wanted to, my skin also might take a little longer in getting tan.  I wouldn&#x27;t let that stop you from buying it! I love it! Also, you should alternate from a bronzer to an accelerator so i bought the &amp;#34;Designer skin Phoenician&amp;#34; hopefully it works!</li>
    <li> Great tanning lotion!</li>
    <li> No complaints. Smells decent</li>
    <li> I have been using luminary for the past few months as my main bronzer but after spreading this amazing stuff on for a few tanning sessions, it looks like  my luminary has some competition.&lt;br /&gt;This lotion looks and feels so good on your skin! I&#x27;m really impressed. I&#x27;ve tried so many DS lotions. Luminary, black, ruby, elusive,  and many many more.&lt;br /&gt;It got me very dark after just 2 tanning sessions and it smells great before and after tanning. I purchased from solarium it&#x27;s 100% authentic</li>
    <li> This has def. been my go to. Great bronzer cute packaging and nice smell. No seller or shipping issues.</li>
    <li> Scent--This lotion smells amazing! The vanilla musk isn&#x27;t like any other lotion I&#x27;ve tried. After putting the lotion on, I find myself constantly smelling my arm. I know that sounds strange but it just smells so good.&lt;br /&gt;Results--As far as the color I got from using this lotion, it&#x27;s just ok. I was pretty dark to begin with, and there wasn&#x27;t a noticeable difference afterwards. However, I love that this lotion has silicone in it. I stopped using it for tanning and started using it as a daily lotion.</li>
    <li> Good lotion as it moisturizes very well, but makes me orange</li>
    <li> Excellent tanning lotion for an awesome price. Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I currently work in a tanning salon and this is a legit lotion. The smell, consistency, and quality are identical to what we sell. I highly recommend this buy. This is a high end lotion and you really can&#x27;t beat the price. My salon sells the same exact bottle for $100</li>
    <li> Definitely a great tanning lotion. I&#x27;ve searched far and wide for tanning lotions that do the trick with minimal applications and this one is up there as one of my favorites. I&#x27;m a once, maybe two-times a week tanner so I need something that gets me dark fast. I tanned about 3 times in one week to get a good base color and it certainly did the trick. Using it about once a week there after kept my color. The color wasn&#x27;t...dramatic...but definitely noticable. I took one star off for ATO. It&#x27;s not horrible but it&#x27;s very typical. I do like how the lotion says it leaves a &amp;#34;matte&amp;#34; finish, this isn&#x27;t nearly as sticky or slimey as some silicone lotions I&#x27;ve used! Overall a good tanning lotion, but not my HG.</li>
    <li> Ive been tanning a few months now not really using any bronzer except face bronzer.  Now that its closer to summer I decided tot ry this one.  I noticied they sell this exact type in the tanning salons and also on here so decided to compare.  It is a whole lot cheaper on amazon which was awesome, cant imagine paying so much money at a salon.  Even after the first time using this lotion, I began to see results!  Very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> I got this with the new Jwoww and it&#x27;s nothing special. Won&#x27;t be wasting money on it.  Don&#x27;t really care for the smell either.</li>
    <li> Great lotion, great smell, results are good, but I wont remember the name of the lotion off the top of my head if you know what I mean:)</li>
    <li> Never occurred to me to purchase tanning lotion online. I am so glad. Its the same stuff for a quarter of the cost. This is a great tanning lotion, it bronze and helps you get a deeper color from the beds.</li>
    <li> Great, light non-perfumey scent....rubs in easily...makes skin feel extremely soft and not dried out while tanning.  Almost instant results of a warm light brown tan...no orange and no streaking.  Love Designer Skin products, can&#x27;t believe I haven&#x27;t tried this earler.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always gone with Designer Skin lotions, this one is by far the best! Better than Black Noir which I once had. Noticeable color after the first tan with this! Loveeee it!</li>
    <li> smells very nice, works well, would buy again.</li>
    <li> It smelled great..even after an hour. It left my skin feeling smooth. I liked how it didn&#x27;t make my skin crazy bronze, but added a subtle bronze even after the tanning. Plus, you can&#x27;t beat the price! My salon was selling this for almost triple the price on here.</li>
    <li> It was what I needed and at a fraction of the cost at the local tanning salon.  She enjoys the scent and how it makes her skin feel.</li>
    <li> Great product. Smells very good. Helps you tan to a dark tan.</li>
    <li> Smells very good, u cant smell da bronzer but u wont get dark. Cheap n works well.. smells very good</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE the scent, and the bronzers work awesome!</li>
    <li> This is the exact same as the $110 lotion they carry in your local tanning salon. When you use it you don&#x27;t have that &amp;#34;tanning bed smell&amp;#34; on your skin and it hydrates wonderfully. No streaking or discoloration after a month of regular use.</li>
    <li> This will definitely take your color to another level!  Smooth, good moisturizer and a pleasant smell - doesn&#x27;t smell like you just came from the tanning salon.</li>
    <li> Pretty bllng on the bottle is about all this has going for it&#x27;s self.</li>
    <li> Great tanning lotion, and it smells awesome !!</li>
    <li> I am a die-hard Designer Skin fan, it is the only line of lotions I use anymore. I really like this one a lot, has a great smell and the bronzer in this one seems to work a lot faster than in some of my others, glad I gave it a try.</li>
    <li> Was very happy with this seller and how quickly this was shipped.&lt;br /&gt;The lotion itself is indeed &amp;#34;adore&amp;#34; by designer skin. I compared it to the bottle they sell at my local tanning salon for $125 it is one and the same except for a much more reasonable price.  I love this lotion because it has a great smell no ATO and lots of bronzer without being streaky. I am an avid tanner and always use silicone based lotions like luminary,black noir, and black. This lotion trumps all 3 of the designer skin classics with its new bronzing formula. Great seller! Great product! Will be ordering again !</li>
    <li> This lotion smells absolutely devine! I love it!</li>
    <li> This was recommended by a friend, they don&#x27;t sell this at my tanning salon, but I stopped buying from them anyway!  I refuse to give them a commission from me buying their overpriced lotions!!!  Thanks Amazon for offering this at a great price!&lt;br /&gt;I have used it now for about 2 wks and I seriously am darker!  I am a year round tanner and I have to be so I can keep a decent tan...I don&#x27;t ever get really dark, like some people :(  But this makes me plenty dark!  This smells good too, unlike some of the other lotions.  This doesnt make you smell bad after you get out of the bed either!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion! If you go to a local tanning salon the want over $100 for this which is ridiculous for lotion, but i got it for $30 and its one of the best lotions out there. Not only does it get you dark faster, doesnt make you orange or leave streaks. The biggest win for me is the smell, most lotions smell ok but after tanning you smell like burnt flesh. not with this lotion, it smells good in the bottle and after you tan.</li>
    <li> Worked as good as the tanning salon promised!</li>
    <li> Bought this in the salon and paid $110...found in here and was super skeptical it wouldn&#x27;t be the same thing...same size and same exact product! It has a refreshing scent,  I don&#x27;t get that nasty after smell, it leaves a nice brown tan. I am fair skinned and have a hard time tanning but with this lotion I have no problem obtaining and maintaining my tan!</li>
    <li> Smells good.  I don&#x27;t see much bronzing effect from it.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion!! My go to lotion to get dark. I&#x27;ll get dark within 3 sessions. My 4th session gets me even more darker, even my face; which is very hard to tan!! I&#x27;ve been tanning for almost 3 years now. I&#x27;d buy this again and recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> This will easily cost you triple at the tanning salon!! I am on my 3rd bottle of this and I have to say I keep coming back to it despite my other experimenting.  It smells decent even after tanning and it really does seem to get me darker faster without a crazy fake bronzer and it also does a great job moisturizing, it actually feels like my skin is being taken care of (at least as much as is possible when you&#x27;re tanning indoors).  Like I said, it doesn&#x27;t have a dark bronzer, so you might not get as much immediate color as you like if you&#x27;re used to that, but I am of mixed race and tan uneven in certain places so the bronzer just makes me look kinda patchy, so I really like that this helps get color in those harder to tan places just as dark as I am in other places.  I would definitely recommend this for keeping your skin healthy and hydrated as well as getting a nice dark even tan that doesn&#x27;t leave you stinky afterwards.</li>
    <li> Ordered from Amazon directly and it is the real deal!</li>
    <li> Saved my wife 70$. Great product for a great price. Thanks &#x3D;]</li>
    <li> I Ordered it 3 weeks ago through Amazon prime, and I received it in the mail 2 days later (on time). I used it 2 times (I went every other day, as I always do) and didn&#x27;t notice any obvious results. Besides for that, it smells delicious (but not like vanilla like everyone else says.) I bought jwoww one and done black bronzer a couple days later, used it once and noticed great results, plus it smells AMAZING. I don&#x27;t know if I will ever use Adore again.</li>
    <li> It was lighter than what I thought it would be, but it still did the job. Maybe better than other products I have used. I didn&#x27;t leave the salon feeling like I needed to run home and shower immediately. The lightly scented lotion leaves you feeling and smelling fresh afterwards. No greasy feel either.</li>
    <li> Pleasant smell and works great.  I used it once so far and the color is fantastic.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this tanning lotion!!!  I have used many other designer tanning lotions and this one by far is my new favorite!  It gets you soooo DARK and leaves your skin feeling so soft and the smell is just divine!  I bought this lotion from the seller Beauty 4 Us and it is AUTHENTIC!!!  Must buy you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Over all a nice product. Like the smell. No ats. But is expired.</li>
    <li> I like the light fragrance.</li>
    <li> Good color. Great scent. Would buy again</li>
    <li> I am a year round tanner and I have tried many lotions,this one is definitely a keeper! It has a nice scent and feels silky smooth going on. It doesn&#x27;t turn me orange but has certainly darkened my color after just three uses.</li>
    <li> Great product and about 60 dollars less than tanning bed costs!</li>
    <li> Awesome product ! Same thing that is sold in all the tanning salons and for a lot less money. Great deal</li>
    <li> I absolutely  love  this lotion. I have just started tanning again and used the lotion 3 times and I already have a golden color! Great product for a great price. I will buy this lotion again</li>
</ol>
