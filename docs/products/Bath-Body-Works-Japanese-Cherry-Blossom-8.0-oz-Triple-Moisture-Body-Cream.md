    <li> My son bought some Japanese Cherry Blossom  lotion for me and I was hooked. It smells so very good. It feels good and makes me feel pretty which is a nice aspect of the lotion. I really like it a lot and my son does, too, obviously, since he first picked it out for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the amount I got was worth the price but the smell can justify it.</li>
    <li> Soft hands and nice fragrance!!</li>
