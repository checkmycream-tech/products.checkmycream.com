<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I get compliments on this scent everywhere I go! Smells wonderful and lasts a very long time. LOVE this perfume oil!</li>
    <li> I found this scent to be more musky than my Nag Champa incense. I knew it was unrealistic to hope for the exact same scent, but this one is so heavy that I only use it very, very sparingly. It doesn&#x27;t feel as light and earthy as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
    <li> This smells more like baby powder than the incensey/earthy smell I was expecting.  It did come on time and the scent is long lasting.</li>
    <li> This smells divine! Love, Love, Love!</li>
    <li> I really enjoy the scent of the oil.  It is not too perfume-y.  I always get compliments when I use it.</li>
    <li> everywhere I go I hear &amp;#34; I smell incense&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product and the length of time it stays with you. I have received many compliments on this fragrance plus it has brought back many wonderful memories. The only suggestion I would make is that it would be even greater if it was packaged in a roll-on type of bottle.</li>
    <li> Finding quality nag champa perfume/essential oil is tricky - the fragrance is either \\&quot;off\\&quot; or the scent dissipates far too early. This perfume smells heavenly and LASTS. I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more of this product.</li>
    <li> Nag Champa - Triloka Perfume Oil - 1/8 Ounce Bottle - Very nice!  I love it!  Thank you for asking.  judy.mcclelland@att.net</li>
    <li> Really strong unpleasant scent. Not for me.</li>
    <li> The aroma is just what I&#x27;ve been looking for, it is reminiscent of the hippy/head shops that were around in the 60&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soon as I applied this, it immediately brought back that familiar aroma I&#x27;ve been seeking for a long time, I have some of the Sai Baba oil coming in this week, and I&#x27;ll compare the two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I received the Sai Baba Nag champa oil, and it is the original.&lt;br /&gt;Although I do like the Sai Baba, and even though it is less expensive than the Triloka, and you get twice as much of the Sai Baba oil, there is no comparison to the Triloka oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Trilaoka oil is stronger in aroma, smells like the nag champa oil I&#x27;m familiar with, and it lasts longer.&lt;br /&gt;So it is Triloka oil for me from now on.</li>
    <li> It is a potent aroma and might overwhelm some who are used to what passes as perfume now days.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s earthy, woodsy and mysterious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The perfume IS thick oil but it absorbs quick with no oily residue.&lt;br /&gt;To really date myself here and fall back on and oldie but a goody:&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;A little dab will do&#x27;ya\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using a dropper I mixed three drops of this oil into four ounces of almond oil and have a luxurious oil for dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;As soon I opened the bottle it was 1971 and a rush of by memories of my much adored uncle and his \\&quot;Hippie\\&quot; friends hit me. That alone made this purchase worth it. They were all exotic characters for this Midwest hayseed farm girl and it was always exciting when he came home to visit and brought his friends.&lt;br /&gt;I expect this to become my go to scent on days I need a \\&quot;pick me up\\&quot; that only comes with memories of the ones we love.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this scent.  My only complaint is that it did not have the little stick usually inside these bottles for dabbing on your wrist.</li>
    <li> More than a dab is too much!  The fragrance smells like Nag Champa but only after it is on the skin for a few hours.  At first application it reminded me of Kush, which is a scent I don&#x27;t care for, but later in the day it had mellowed and was very pleasant.  I have the same sweater on today as yesterday and can smell it in my clothing. Co-workers did not like it so I won&#x27;t be wearing to the office again. I have used Nag Champa incense since I was a teen in the &#x27;60&#x27;s. This is the first I&#x27;ve tried the perfume. I think I may use it in a simmer pot to scent the room rather than as a perfume.</li>
    <li> This is absolutely the best Nag Champa perfume oil i have ever come across.  At first i was very hesitant about ordering a perfume oil online without smelling it first hand.  Even though Nag Champa has been one of my all time favorite scents, not all oils are equal.  i have tried quite a few different brands that i have found in stores and not one has come even close to the quality of this oil.  i would not have ordered if it had not been for the positive reviews.  Thanks to those, i am so happy to have such a high quality oil.  If you know that you love the Nag Champa scent.....like from burning the fabulous incense....you will not be disappointed.  It is EXACTLY the right scent.</li>
    <li> I LOVE Nag Champa period so I was excited to try this oil. Despite reviews to it&#x27;s sweetness, which is true. It is a little on the sweet side but my natural body scent goes well with this scent so it&#x27;s no too sweet. And a little does go a long way.</li>
    <li> There is no way my review can do this product justice. It is the best quality oil I have ever tried. A little dab will do you. It smells perfectly like Nag Champa. It lasts all day. And again, when I say a tiny amount is perfect, I really mean it. It is so potent .&lt;br /&gt;Just the loveliest scent when the right amount is applied. I really can&#x27;t say enough about how amazed and satisfied I am with this purchase. I get a ton of compliments.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a tiny dram, but it worth it&#x27;s weight</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance. The Whole Foods near me stopped carrying Nag Champa. So,I bought this as a replacement. Not only does it smell better but it lasts a long time. A little goes a long way, seriously.  I get compliments whenever I wear it. I find that a lot of people who know the scent,get a kick out of blurting out &amp;#34;Nag Champa!&amp;#34; upon smelling it.</li>
    <li> Smells a little bit more like baby powder than the nag champa I&#x27;m used to but still great! Very strong!</li>
    <li> Nag champa oil is SO EXPENSIVE and hard to find. So I opted for the perfume oil (again, very hard to find). After reading SO many Amazon reviews I opted for this. It&#x27;s AMAZING. I wanted an oil that smells like the incense, and this smells just. like. the. incense.  It doesn&#x27;t last long when applied directly to the skin, but a drop in my hair, lotion, body wash, etc. does the trick and since I&#x27;m only using a drop or two a week, this tiny bottle lasts forever. I couldn&#x27;t be happier, thank you!</li>
    <li> What a pleasant surprise. This smells amazing, I love this perfume oil.  Just a small amount goes a VERY long way.  Smelled good all day long.</li>
    <li> I did not like this nag champa... To flowery</li>
    <li> best nag champa oil I&#x27;ve found. lasts for hours and I get tons of compliments on the good smells. :)</li>
    <li> Strong silage, so very little is needed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can be mix and blended into other formulations to create unique perfumes, lotions, and hair products&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought some months back last year and still have it for use now.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;&#x27;s okay , but  to me it really doesn&#x27;t capture the smell of nag champa .. i am not that impressed .</li>
    <li> Light and clean smelling. A little goes a long, long, way.  Scent last all day. If your into oils as perfume it&#x27;s a must have.</li>
    <li> The smell is awesome but it does NOT LAST AT ALL.  So its a very awesome smell just does not last</li>
    <li> JUST LOVE THIS SMELL HONESTLY I COULD NOT TELL YOU WHAT THIS IS SUPPOSE TO SMELL LIKE BUT THE MINUTE I DID IT BOUGHT ME BACK TO SATURDAY MORNINGS IN THE GREENWICH VILLIAGE,IN NY CITY.THOSE WERE THE BEST DAYS,THIS IS A LITTLE STRONG SO I WILL ADJUST THE BOTTLE IS VERY TINY SO IF YOUR LOOKING FOR A BIG BOTTLE THIS IS NOT IT,BUT IM THINKING IT WILL LAST A LONG TIME BECAUSE ITS SO STRONG SO JUST USE A DAB.THE BOTTLE IS JUST LIKE SHOWN.</li>
    <li> Came in on time.  Smells wonderful,  but the bottle was only 3/4 of the way full. Which kind of sucks since it is such a small bottle.</li>
    <li> This oil smells great, I love it! I just wish you could buy bigger quantities. Put a few drops into some undocumented lotion and now I get compliments on it all the time.</li>
    <li> I am constantly getting compliments when I wear this.  I wear it with Sandalwood oil and the combination is heavenly.</li>
    <li> I have been trying to find a perfume that actually smells like the incense and I finally have! Love this scent. It puts me in a good mood ( :</li>
    <li> I love this perfume oil.  It only takes a small amount to do a big job.  It lasts all day and smells incredible.  It absorbs quickly and completely.  No oily residue.  It has it&#x27;s own unique scent. I get compliments on how good I smell.  I love it!</li>
    <li> Smells just like the incense. Love that it lasts all day long. I do wish it was larger but a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Does not smell like Nag Champa at all. I&#x27;ve tried diluting it, mixing it, everything. It only smells like baby powder. Very strong baby powder.</li>
    <li> Love love LOVE this oil! I wear it daily! It&#x27;s a great nag and not too strong or too weak. Very warm calming scent! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This Oil is so strong the reviews were&lt;br /&gt;right it last all day it does have a head shop smell but its nice very strong</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because the product did not smell like Nag Champa at all.  This smelled like some kind of rancid oil.  I was very disappointed with this product.  I would not recommend buying this oil ever again.  This brand was very bad. Im so sad. What a waste of my money.</li>
    <li> This just doesn&#x27;t smell like Nag Champa on me, it has some odd soapy note that just spoils the lovely smokey scent.  On my husband&#x27;s oilier skin, it works beautifully but on me it just smells off.</li>
    <li> The real deal - the smell is amazing - appropriate for either gender.</li>
    <li> Great perfume!  Long lasting and smells wonderful!  Just what I was looking for!  A little goes a long way though, go easy with it :)</li>
    <li> This is THE nag champa oil to own. Don&#x27;t even bother with the Sai Baba brand - that stuff&#x27;s been so weakened over the years that it&#x27;s mostly just the strength of a massage oil now and won&#x27;t last an hour. One small dot of this transferred between wrists, chest and neck will scent you all day long - gorgeous!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A small caution - don&#x27;t over apply - it can sting/burn a little on the skin and be somewhat overpowering. I&#x27;ve had one of these tiny bottles last me for well over two years with semi-daily use, if that&#x27;s any indication of it&#x27;s strength, concentration and sillage.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this if you are looking for the blue boxed incense scent. Beware it is strong stuff and lasting, so you may want to dilute this with a bit of Now Almond Oil.</li>
    <li> Everywhere I go, people want to know what I&#x27;m wearing...it is  Triloka Nag Champa oil...it&#x27;s amazing and reasonably priced. I love it, and so does everyone else I come in contact with!</li>
    <li> I have bought two of these so far.  It&#x27;s a wonderful scent that lasts well in to the day.  My go-to fragrance.  A little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Too strong for a perfume. And doesn&#x27;t smell like nag champa I expected. It would be good added to alcohol and water as a fabric spritzer maybe. Or adds to potpourri. As a perfume, you might want to add to a neutral carrier oil.</li>
    <li> I find oils always smell different once they&#x27;re on skin and this one really smells nice if you like the smell of incense. It&#x27;s very herby but not too potent and lasts a long while throughout the day. I&#x27;ll be buying this again. The bottle is small but it&#x27;s definitely enough to last.</li>
    <li> The smell is exactly what I wanted but it doesn&#x27;t last long and the size is very small for the price</li>
    <li> Smells great but &amp;#34;1 dram&amp;#34; was A LOT smaller than I expected.  wont purchase again.  can get similar scents from local&lt;br /&gt;distributor for less $$</li>
    <li> I have tried using it, but it&#x27;s just too much</li>
    <li> Smells good, but I&#x27;ve had better.</li>
    <li> This is divine. VERY concentrated.</li>
    <li> A little of this goes a long way. Out of all the nag champa perfume brands I&#x27;ve tried this is by far the best smelling. Smells like the incense before being burned. Mmmmmmmm....</li>
    <li> I really like this, I use it very often, but just a dab, a little goes a long way! it does smell like nag champa, but not exactly like the incense, however, I do really like the smell! and I will buy this again, I have ordered some more similar products to this as well, just to try out, I would like one that smells just like the incense, but I don&#x27;t know if any will, however like I said, I do really like this smell, and a little goes a very long way, and it is not to strong, it is light (I get headaches easy from strong smells, and this does not give me a headache!!!) but it does last all day, so even though it is a smaller bottle, it will last a long time! well worth it!</li>
    <li> This oil is incredible. Smells exactly like the blue box nag champa we all adore. Long lasting, a little goes a long way, and a comforting fragrance.</li>
    <li> I use a little body oil and perfume oil and everyone ask me what I&#x27;m wearing, very nice oil I&#x27;m going to need to order more!!</li>
    <li> This is a tiny bottle of Nag Champa oil, but a lil goes a long long way. Good stuff. My neck smells just like my favorite incense now!</li>
    <li> Very small bottles, and caps can be hard to remove -- very slippery plastic. A square top, like the bottle, would be a big plus. Nag Champa scent is nice, but not exactly the same as the &amp;#34;blue box&amp;#34; variety. I&#x27;ve used both as a perfume and added to the bath.</li>
    <li> I get so many compliments on this authentic scent! It&#x27;s a small bottle but it goes a long way! Great buy!</li>
    <li> I was not familiar with the Nag Champa smell, but I ordered this by chance based on all the positive reviews. Personally, I do not like the scent; I tried to, but I think that it is an old, back in the day scent that people from a certain generation can associate with, unfortunately, I am not one of them. As for the longevity of the scent, when I received it in the mail I opened it and placed a dab on my wrist and now, 15 hours later, the scent still lingers, so it is a very long lasting scent,so for that I give it 3 stars.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of Nag Champa and burn quite a bit of the incense. I&#x27;ve been trying to find a perfume scent that truly smelled like the incense I like so much. This is IT. I get complements all the time. It takes only a tiny, tiny bit. The bottle is very small but just a drop on the fingertip will do both sides of the neck. Love it.</li>
    <li> Smells absolutely delicious. I love it, just a dab is all you need.</li>
    <li> I just received this today and it is AMAZING! I will be wearing this every day. I can&#x27;t stop sniffing myself!&lt;br /&gt;It does smell a tiny bit different than the blue box Nag Champa incense, but it&#x27;s still amazing!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. Smells wonderful, and was fairly inexpensive. I received it in the mail, and on the first day I wore it, a friend of mine wanted to know how to get some as well. Also, I bought from Tom&#x27;s Incense, and Tom sent a coupon on the packaging sheet to put toward my next purchase. I highly suggest that seller. Very personal and friendly.</li>
    <li> Very nice long lasting scent; true nag champa fragrance oil. I love this perfume oil so much that I&#x27;ve already ordered a second bottle to scent my linens. So nice to find an affordable perfumed oil that smells great, too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered Nag Champa perfume oil from other makers, but nothing compares to this brand &amp;#34;Triloka&amp;#34; best smelling Nag Champa I&#x27;ve smelled... have already gotten &amp;#34;what are you wearing&amp;#34; from people and I was happy to give out what I was wearing and who the maker was.......I would definitely buy this again........ ☺☺</li>
    <li> So strong! The bottle is only a dram, but this is packed with so much scent that half a dab will do. Should last a very long time. Scent is very much Nag Champa. I love this product!</li>
    <li> Smells good bit doesn&#x27;t smell exactly like Nag Champa</li>
    <li> Though it&#x27;s very small if you&#x27;re using it just as a body oil it&#x27;s incredibly potent and has lasted me quite a while.</li>
    <li> I was given this as a gift and just used the last of my bottle and just bought another one!  It may be small, but a little bit DOES go a long way.  As much as I love the smell, sometimes I&#x27;d even overwhelm myself, lol.  But a little will do you and last all day.  It smells like love and is just perfect.  I was looking at other sites that sold this perfume and they wanted $7.95 for shipping on such a small item! So I chose this person bc the shipping was free and obviously a much better deal.  I can&#x27;t wait!  It&#x27;s probably my most favorite smell besides Angel perfume, and I can&#x27;t wait to try the rest of the Triloka perfume oils!  Will definitely order again and again as long as this person keeps selling!</li>
    <li> This smells just like I expected! A little bit goes a long way so don&#x27;t go too crazy with it.</li>
    <li> People are right when they say it smells a lot like baby powder. But, my boyfriend likes it as it reminds him of the 60&#x27;s. I&#x27;ve learned to place my finger over it and tilt bottle...only do this once and you&#x27;ll have plenty on! So, the bottle lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Triloka Nag Champa Perfume oil exceeded my expectations. I was using one that was wonderful and smelled just like Nag Champa in a more subtle way[like the Satya Sai Baba brand incense]. When I could no longer purchase it as the women who was selling it discontinued carrying it I was very disappointed. The Triloka is a step above. It is stronger, more sensual and has a kick that my old oil did not have. It is a bit different from other Nag Champa scents I have smelled before but it is wonderful.You only need a bit as it seems to be long lasting and strong when first applied. I just ordered three more bottles so I would have it to stock up on and to share one with my daughter. Great product, great purchase.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells amazing!!  I love the smell of the incense and thought I&#x27;d give this a try.  I could smell it in the package before I even opened it!  It didn&#x27;t leak or anything, but it was very fragrant.  It only took one little dab on the wrist and I&#x27;ve been smelling it for 4 hours now.  It&#x27;s lovely.  It has settled into a soft, delicate, powdery scent on my skin.  1/8 oz is a tiny bottle, but it doesn&#x27;t take much at all... and I tend to be one who bathes in fragrances.  LOL  If you like the Nag Champa incense, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this scent!</li>
    <li> This tiny bottle of essential oil packs a punch.  The Nag Champa oil that it contains is the best I have ever bought.  Incredible lasting power.  Only a small drop here or there for hours of exotic scent.  Heady, Oriental, Woodsy!</li>
    <li> Smells right on! Love it</li>
    <li> This oil smells exactly as I hoped and it is wonderfully beautiful!  Don&#x27;t worry about the small size of the bottle. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This oil smells great and you only need just a dab. It works well in fragrance warmers, using just a couple drops. I mix the drops in with coconut oil, which melts quickly and works as a great base to add your oil of choice to. Seller shipped out product quickly.</li>
    <li> I wanted too try a Nag Champa based scented oil, so I ordered two different brands. Unfortunately, I accidentally ordered two of these and one of another brand. The other brand won &amp;#34;hands down&amp;#34;!!&lt;br /&gt;This one smells alright from the bottle, though not like Nag Champa, and has a strange, sour smell after wearing it for a couple hours. I gave it 3 stars since it may just be that it isn&#x27;t compatible with my body chemistry. I&#x27;ll try it in a burner or in potpourri since I already spent almost 20$ on the two pack. Disappointed k/</li>
    <li> Want to take a mental trip back to the late 60&#x27;s, early 70&#x27;s?  This stuff will do it for ya.  Very potent ~ reminds me of acid rock, folk songs and black light posters (they have other scents too)</li>
    <li> If you love nag champa buy this! It takes just one dab and last for hours! Love it!</li>
