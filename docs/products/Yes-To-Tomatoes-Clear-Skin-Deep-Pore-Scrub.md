<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I really like this product.  I was out of my favorite scrub and came across this at Target and thought \\&quot;why not?\\&quot;  The smell is nice and light, not what I expected.  I actually look forward to the smell.  The scrub is light as well and the beads aren&#x27;t so rough but do the job.  My skin definitely feels soft afterwards.  I think I really like this.  Will probably get it again; maybe try the lotion and the spot stick too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now as for it&#x27;s skin clearing abilities let me address something:  I have had acne for my adult life.  I have struggled with so many products, even getting chemical peels and microdermabrasion.  I have come to find out that although good skin products are crucial and I certainly can&#x27;t slather vaseline on my face, the key to having clear skin lies within whether or not I am drinking enough water, eating enough fiber, and how much sugar and flour I am eating.  The cleaner I eat, the cleaner my skin.  I can&#x27;t expect a topical thing to solve an internal problem, in other words.  But good products are definitely needed.  So buy this product for its greatness in addition to a great diet and you&#x27;ll be happy.  It gives glow and good texture.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product from Walmart a couple of weeks ago. After seeing the reviews online I was a little skeptical but I tried it out anyway. I&#x27;ve recently been getting mild acne breakouts, nothing serious, but still annoying enough (I switched my usual cleanser so I think that might have been one of the reasons) so I thought I&#x27;d try this out since it was natural.  Personally I think it works great. The first day I used it, most of the acne was dried up and less red. After two weeks of using it daily I&#x27;ve noticed my skin become clearer (and my pores seem tighter as well!) Like the other reviewers said, it does have a unique smell, but I did not find it as acidic as I expected (definitely tolerable) and though the scrub does not have large beads like most cleansers in the store, I felt it does the trick. Everybody has different skin, so how it will react will always differ on the person but I would definitely recommend this product if you&#x27;re willing to experiment!</li>
    <li> Works well. Smells weird.</li>
    <li> Rarely can acne be treated with an exfoliant alone. Most individuals will begin with prescribed retinols, benzoyl peroxide, etc. The point is, if you want a cleanser that feels good, isn&#x27;t loaded with artificial scents and does the job (ie, exfoliates), this is the best product. In researching the most natural products out there, the \\&quot;Yes To\\&quot; crew wins-- their products are the most devoid of the truly harmful ingredients we use on our faces every day. I would say, treat your acne with the stuff that works (antibacterial topical creams, retinols, etc) and stick to the \\&quot;Yes To\\&quot; brand for a good, safe, environmentally friendly cleanser.</li>
    <li> I was using this product because I have developed moderate acne. I used as directed and my acne was getting worse and worse. I have since learned more about treating  acne and that you don&#x27;t want to use anything abrasive. It spreads the bacteria and makes acne worse. Just two days after discontinuing this product my skin looks clearer. Actually the more gentle I am with my skin the better it looks. Gentle cleanser, toner, and moisturizer with acne face cream from my dermatologist. To exfoliate use an enzyme mask once a week.  The American Academy of Dermatology website tells you what you need to know. [...]. Think again before using this product on your acne!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a licensed esthetician and bought this product due to an excellent review from the beauty editor at the NY Times.  This product does absolutely nothing to exfoliate the skin.  The base in the product is far too viscous to do anything but glide around the face, and the very small amount of granular scrubbing ingredients cannot even reach the skin.  Skip this one.</li>
    <li> I wanted to go for something more natural in facial products for my acne, so when I saw the add for the new YTT acne products I immediately ordered. Of course the products weren&#x27;t coming our for a month or two, but it was worth the wait. This scrub is A-MAZING! It gently exfoliates with bamboo and it has 2% salicylic acid, to help fight acne! It doesn&#x27;t irritate, rinses off easily, and leaves no film (like I hear the Clean and Clear Daily Pore Scrub does). It makes your face feel soft, clean and not dry, despite the fact that is has 2% salicylic acid, which is a plus since I have dry skin.     So has it helped with my acne? I believe it has!! Not alone of course, but in combination with my other products, and tea drinking. So it is a good buy. There are two down sides - It is a a tad expensive for something of that size, but it is made of 97% natural ingredients, so I guess it will be alright.     I did notice that Amazon says that it is a 5 ounces container, but in actuality is is 4 ounces, just to give you all a heads up so you won&#x27;t be disappointed of how you ave been \\&quot;robbed\\&quot; an ounce.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive acne prone skin so I am very cautious when trying a new product. I was very pleased with this face wash, it is gentle enough for my sensitive skin and still helps keep my acne under control.</li>
    <li> This is okay. Decent price. Would like it to be a little bigger size. It does come out of the bottle very quick. Not my favorite scrub, but it&#x27;s not bad. I like that it is natural.</li>
    <li> This deep pore scrub is wonderful. It takes only a very little bit to thoroughly cleanse my face. It&#x27;s lather is rich and feels very good on my face. It leave my skin feeling fresh and invigorated. I haven&#x27;t found a product for my face that I like this much in a long time. I would definitely recommend it for people with oily yet sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after a good review in the NY Times. The review said that it was a scrub that was \\&quot;not too abrasive or too subtle.\\&quot; However I found that this does not work as a scrub at all. If it could even be compared to a scrub, it&#x27;s the most subtle of any I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ll stick to Lush&#x27;s Coalface soap, which has a layer of ground charcoal, or the standard-issue apricot scrub, which is a bit abrasive, but gets the job done.</li>
    <li> This stuff is pure gold! It has the perfect amount of exfoliant, and the beads are a great size, too. I also love that it&#x27;s mostly natural.</li>
    <li> The best thing about this is that it&#x27;s mostly natural. It does little to nothing for my acne, though. I have a few pimples all the time and more pimples plus cystic acne starting a week before my period. The worst thing about this product, which a few others have mentioned, is the residue. It doesn&#x27;t rinse cleanly, and if I scrape my face a little after washing, my fingernails come away caked with creamy white gunk underneath. I tried tonight scrubbing my face hard with my hands as I rinsed in the shower and that helped, but that shouldn&#x27;t be necessary! (And I&#x27;m still not sure that got off all the gunk.)</li>
    <li> I tried this product first as a sample from Beauty Army and I really liked it. It leaves your skin feeling clean, it smells great, it&#x27;s gentle but does not leave any residue. A definite must have for your shower.</li>
    <li> I bought this a few months back and I loved it. Not only did it smell great, but I felt that it made a difference with the moderate adult acne that I suffer from. On top of that, the scrub pieces felt like they really exfoliated without hurting my sensitive skin. Unfortunately, when I ordered two more, they were not the same. The older one was a clear orange and this newer one looks more like white cream. There also seems to be less of the scrub beads. This new formulation doesn&#x27;t seem to get my skin as clean, and it even makes it feel like there is a bit too much mousturizer for it to be an acne face scrub. I do see some more skin blemishes, but I&#x27;ll continue to use it until I run out or find a better natural scrub.</li>
    <li> I tried the Yes to cucumber cleanser before, with the Yes to carrot spf moisturizer.  The cleanser was so so, and the moisturizer clogged my pores.  I was a little hesitant to try again with the Yes to, but my hunch was right that the cucumber cleanser is nice, it was just a bit mild.  And the moisturizer clogged my pores on account of the sunscreen, which is typical.  So, when I bought the tomato cleanser with the s. acid, I liked it.  However, after a few days using it day and night, I noticed it was overdrying my skin, since my acne is mild.  When I combined using the tomato periodically in conjunction with the cucumber, I cracked the code for the perfect cleansers.  PS The blueberry night cream and day cream are lovely and smell SOOO good!</li>
    <li> I really love this stuff. My skin is very sensitive and combination. I constantly have blackheads on my nose and around its bridge. When I use this, it clears them and makes my skin feel SO soft. I get annoyed because of how bumpy and clear the blackheads are but when I use this it&#x27;s like brand new baby skin. I ran out so I&#x27;m definitely going to buy more. I&#x27;d buy it in bulk, honestly.</li>
    <li> I have searched for a natural alternative for acne for a long time and I finally found it in this little bottle. This combined with the other yes to tomatoes line has cleared up my acne and I love it! The smell is a bit weird, and the beads in it don&#x27;t exfoliate but there are actual exfoliates for that! This is great as a face wash, and helps to clear up acne. A little dollop goes a long way with this. I love it, and will be buying again.</li>
    <li> After using some great scrubs like MyChelle&#x27;s Tropical Skin Smoother and Juara&#x27;s Rice Polish (Yes, they will cost more though - but worth it!) we were not very impressed with this \\&quot;Pore Scrub\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;We loved the Yes to Tomatoes shampoo, so we thought we would give the face scrub a try and have on hand for those occasional breakouts. Even with the 2% Salicylic Acid to add some chemical exfoliation along with bamboo it only seemed to work just ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if the formula has changed because a couple reviewers talked about how great the smell is, but there is deffinately no \\&quot;spa aroma\\&quot; coming from this bottle. It has a rather flat/neutral smell (slightly medicated product-esque, probably due to the salicylic acid).  Overall, it might work for someone who wanted a milder scrub for inflammed skin that is easily irritated by harsher acne-fighting products or more abrasive polishers, but for our part we were hoping to get more exfoliating action on account of the title \\&quot;pore scrub\\&quot; that sounded like it was something that would really get down into the pores. I think to realisitcally achieve this they should add more Bamboo bits and some additional effective ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From now on we will stick to the products with a generous amount of micro beads or face polishers and that use the fruit enzymes and glycolics.</li>
    <li> My husband has really oily skin and to keep break-outs at bay, he was using Clean and Clear Morning Burst Facial Cleanser. I have been trying to phase out most of the chemicals in my family&#x27;s household and bath products and in a lot of cases the products are more expensive and don&#x27;t work as well. This product is more expensive than the Clean and Clear, but seems to work just as well and I&#x27;m really pleased with it. It has a nice gritty texture, takes care of the oily skin and my husband&#x27;s face has stayed clear!</li>
    <li> I need to reorder this.  It has helped my skin sooooo much in the hot humidity of summer in the South.  My Acne-prone combination skin needed it to keep the oil monster at bay, for the most part.  This cleanser would be too harsh to use on my drier, more sensitive winter skin.  But great on my hard to keep under control summer skin!  I&#x27;m even able to use the Yes To Grapefruit Light SPF 18 Color Correcting Cream to give my skin a little bit of even tone.  It&#x27;s a Light-Medium tint which works great even on my darkly tanned summer skin.</li>
    <li> I love this scrub! It feels and smells natural, and exfoliates my skin tremendously well. My skin always feels SUPER smooth after I use it!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why, but every time I use this I end up breaking out badly with like 20 tiny whiteheads in random clusters on my face. I have given it several trials and no I don&#x27;t use this to remove makeup I just use it in the morning in the shower. It leaves a slimy film that doesn&#x27;t rinse off. I would not recommend it to anyone or ever buy it again. Blah.</li>
    <li> Skeptical about the unusual name and never having liked tomatoes as a kid, it took me a while to try this one out. I am a guy. Tomatoes? No way. And so I scrubbed, in the morning, in the evenings. Smells great, feels good in your hand and on your face. And then I felt it, after the first day: incredibly smooth skin that got better by the day. Clean. Soft. Did I say clean? And smells invigorating. I never thought I could get so excited about a scrub. Bought four more tubes, just in case I run out. I absolutely love this product and couldn&#x27;t recommend it more. Without wanting to sound like a commercial: I started getting compliments about my clean and soft skin. Who wouldn&#x27;t want that? Also try their moisturizer. Equally great. I say YES TO a cabinet full of these products. Give it a try and start glowing, or at least smiling in the mirror. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Love it :) works well. Feel clean and fresh and it&#x27;s gentle but effective.</li>
    <li> As big of a fan of the Yes To products I have been for years, I&#x27;m giving this one a pass for the future. It&#x27;s just not living up to the price. I have minor acne tendencies, and was looking to exfoliate daily, but this really doesn&#x27;t do a good job on anything. It also leaves a residue that is difficult to take off...and what do you know...after a few weeks of using it almost everyday it is running out. Bad pricing.</li>
    <li> I use this product about 3 days a week and the cleanser every morning and night!!!!! This stuff works better than ever expensive product I have tried over the last 15 years that I have been dealing with acne! I would recommend this to anyone with acne!</li>
    <li> It works like it should. I use it every 2 days and since I&#x27;ve been using it regularly I think it has helped with my acne. Not sure about the scarring as I guess I might be stuck with that for life. But my face feels so smooth after using this for 2-3 minutes.</li>
    <li> A pretty solid scrub. I love how natural it is. It doesn&#x27;t remove absolutely all the dead skin I have from time to time, but does a nice job overall. I actually mix it with a foaming face gel for a deeper clean, so I can&#x27;t comment on how well it actually cleans my skin.</li>
    <li> I like this as a natural (or at least a step in the right direction) alternative to other facial scrubs. It is a little less harsh as far as the scrubbing part, which is probably a good thing. So far still seems to be keeping my face clear.</li>
    <li> I have combination skin, which is mostly oily. I also do get pimples here and there, but nothing real serious. As a whole, I like this product line. With this product, I actually use it every other night, opposite the gel cleanser. I find that I like this a bit better than the gel cleanser. The scrub seems to exfoliate gently, but well. It doesn&#x27;t lather up all nice and sudsy, but as long as my face feels clean and oil free, I am okay with that. My face seems to like the product used sparingly, I still do get the occasional pimple, but it goes away very quick. I don&#x27;t find the smell overpowering at all-I actually find it pleasant. As of today, I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Overall, I have really sensitive skin, and my face is combination (oily/dry) and prone to a lot of breakouts.  With so many allergies too, I research all of my products through the EWG&#x27;s SkinDeep database.  This product had a 3 rating which was fairly decent for an over-the-counter face scrub.  I decided to order this from Amazon and give it a whirl with my current cleansing regimen.  I found that it was way too rough on my face and caused a lot of irritation and further breakouts. It also made my skin feel like I just slathered on a layer of oil or gunk. Icky. If you have very sensitive skin like me, better to stick with another scrub (or only use this once a week, which might not be frequently enough).  I will say I&#x27;ve found the Yes To Cucumbers products (which is very gentle on the skin) and the Body Shop Tea Tree Blackhead Scrub to be way better...check those out instead.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about two weeks now in the shower, every morning.  I&#x27;ve noticed a visible difference in my skin, both in smoothness and in the amount of recurring acne that I have.  Some may not like the smell, but I think it&#x27;s really not bad at all.</li>
    <li> I work in a kitchen and my face gets pretty greasy.  For my needs, this product was okay, but does not clean as well as apricot scrub.  I also don&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
    <li> a)the exfoliating particles are really freaking rough- and i&#x27;m a guy with a beard.&lt;br /&gt;b)my skin did not like whatever else they put in there&lt;br /&gt;c)it&#x27;s twice the price of competing st.ive&#x27;s products</li>
    <li> I love Yesto products, and this is definitely my new favorite.  After one use my skin was softer, smoother and more even.  I&#x27;m in love!</li>
    <li> Tried a lot of products, this is the best by far!</li>
    <li> this is a great scrub. you don&#x27;t feel guilty using it--organic and no animal testing. it&#x27;s all natural. it tastes good too. its a good lip scrub as well, get all those dry flakes off those lips</li>
    <li> Does a great job as a face scrub, I used to use ones with microbeads but heard it was terrible for the environment so I switched over.  I like this even better.  Great stuff, both me and my husband use it!</li>
    <li> I was so excited to use this product when I bought it at Target today! When I started to lather it and scrub it on to my face, it felt somewhat like a scrub consistency but was not as abrasive and scrub-y as the previous ones I had used. When I thought I finished washing my face, my face felt kind of cakey and gunky and NOTHING close to squeaky clean. I scrapped my fingers on the side of my face and ended up with this gross white residue under my nails which was from this product. To get that nasty stuff off of my face I had to use another very abrasive scrub. Bottom line: Sorry but this is not a good buy.</li>
    <li> This is the only thing my teenage son find works for him [including the prescription meds from our dermatologist].  It works without drying out his face.  He loves it.  Wish I could find it for a more affordable price but at least it is available online and ships quickly.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t make me break out but it didn&#x27;t help much just not for my skin. the gel cleanser from this brand on the other hand helped a lot with my acne.</li>
    <li> I have used everything under the sun trying to keep my 33 year old acne at bay. If there is a product on the shelf I have used it, along with prescription pills and proactiv and murad. Nothing worked. I looked online and found a lot of people raving about natural and organic products. I was leery to try the expensive organic products at whole foods, but figured I could give the cheaper &amp;#34;Tomato&amp;#34; brand a try. I am so glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face is almost 100% clear. I love the scrubby feel of this stuff and it tastes great. (I accidentally got it in my mouth and was pleasantly surprised that it tastes like sugar versus god awful chemicals) I love the fact that something more natural works so well on my stubborn skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up buying this product for the evening, the tomato gel cleanser for my morning shower since I have a Clarisonic brush, and I use their tomato repair treatment as a lotion. Love, love, love all three. (Oh and I had to buy a separate toner at whole foods as this company doesn&#x27;t make one)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you are looking for a natural product or just an effective product give this a go. I can&#x27;t give it enough stars. :)</li>
    <li> Has a weird fermented smell</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really feel like my face is clean when I use this scrub.  It leaves a film on my skin.  I also didn&#x27;t notice that it helped with my blemishes.  I switched to the Yes To Blueberries face wipes and intensive skin repair serum and now I&#x27;m addicted to them!</li>
    <li> My teenage son purchased this product in NYC in a small shop.  He tried many products to clear up his face and was out of ideas.  This was a surprise because it really works!  I ordered it from Amazon and its on auto delivery.  It really works.&lt;br /&gt;Adrienne</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin so this product did not work well for me.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. I don&#x27;t have acne, but have very small bumps around my chin. This really helps bring them to the surface for extraction. It&#x27;s also gentle enough for my very sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I was surprised at how awful this product was for *my* skin.  At first I loved it - nice little scrubbies in a clean scented and natural product.  Yay! Plus salicylic acid (sa)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it according to directions a couple of times and though I&#x27;m not sensitive to any of the ingredients (including sa, which I&#x27;ve used before in much higher concentrations) that I know of, for some reason this particular product was extremely drying. I was literally red and peeling.  I thought ok, I&#x27;ll just use it less often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I noticed one morning after having used it the night before, I had a few bumps that were very itchy.  This was disconcerting because the only thing I know I&#x27;m allergic to is wool, and I&#x27;m very careful to stay away from that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah - wrong way to go about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next time I used it, I woke up with full on hives on my face (I&#x27;ll upload a picture) which lasted for a couple of days. I didn&#x27;t quite know what to make of it because I&#x27;d also started using another new natural product... I thought maybe it&#x27;s a combo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nope - wrong again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to do a test run and use only one product per day for two or three days in a row no matter what the outcome (meaning no moisturizer if I was flaky, no sunscreen, etc)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got around to Yes to Tomatoes Clear Skin Pore Scrub, I once again had a massive allergic reaction. This time my face and entire neck and upper clavicle area, where I had used the product, was red, itchy, scaly and bumpy...this lasted for 3 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not saying this is a bad product... as others have reviewed, it obviously works for many.  That said, if you experience any of these types of allergic or sensitive-skin reactions, STOP using the product - it has something that for some of us is really not good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW - I&#x27;ve recently switched to using Yes To Carrots Nourishing Cleanser which has much less of a scrubby action though is far more moisturizing.  The reviewsof that aren&#x27;t so complimentary (seems like they changed the formula, though I never used the old one, so don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to) I like it much more... so far no adverse reactions :)</li>
    <li> The Yes to Grapefruit works better for me but this is good enough when my skin gets too dry from it. This leaves my face feeling a little greasy so I can&#x27;t use it all the time.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product  and received it within just a few days!  I am very happy with the product, the quality, the price and the great service I received! I received excellent service, along with a great product!  I recommend this product to anyone with sensitive skin, like I have. I have recommend this to others already.</li>
    <li> First, let me state my skin type as we all know products will not work for all skin types. I have combination skin, oily on the t-zone area and around my chin, and dry on my cheeks. I have always battled with breakouts ever since I can remember. I&#x27;m currently 25 years old, AND I&#x27;m pregnant, so I get to experience MORE lovely breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Products I have used before? What haven&#x27;t I used... Proactiv, clearasil, neutrogena, biore, you name it, I&#x27;ve tried it sometime in the past 12 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I told my husband that I read great things about this line, and that I wanted it for Christmas. He ACTUALLY got it for me! This face scrub went immediately to the bathroom with me for a try out. I first noticed the smell, it&#x27;s very strong and not-so-pleasant, but it isn&#x27;t god awful like lots of people have said. The texture is great! I&#x27;m fond of exfoliators to start with, so the little pieces of bamboo made me pretty happy. It felt good. After rinsing, I felt like my skin was completely clean. As with any exfoliator, you will need a light moisturizer after washing (and yes, I have the yes to tomatoes moisturizer too! Awesome by the way).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s not forget, this product is 97% natural. Yes, really! That was the main appeal since I&#x27;m pregnant and want to be careful with what my skin is absorbing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While we all know nothing will show immediate results, I can tell you in the past month of using this product I have never been more happy about my skin. Sure I still get a pimple here and there, but they seem less severe than before and they don&#x27;t stick around as long as they used to. I also have the tomato acne spot corrector that I enjoy whenever I get a zit. I don&#x27;t care if I sound silly, this whole skin care line is my all time favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good to know: There is now a \\&quot;Yes to Grapefruit\\&quot; for helping get rid of acne scars and other dark spots. I have ordered mine and am currently waiting to try it, but I have high hopes after the Tomato linehas done so much good for me. BUY THE TOMATO LINE IF YOU ARE AN ACNE SUFFERER!</li>
    <li> I have very oily skin and am extremely prone to blackheads, so my face wash is of the utmost importance. I&#x27;ve used Melvita, Clinique, Dermologica, Biore, and most recently La Roche-Posay and none of them are as effective as Yes to Tomatoes. It&#x27;s been 5 months of using this product and no problems, and at this price point I&#x27;m definitely not complaining! Truly a godsend. Use it.</li>
    <li> I love this pore scrub. It does leave a bit of bamboo residue but I use the Olay pro x brush which helps get every corner. I am seeing less blemishes and my blackheads were gone in 2 days!! I will definitely keep using this. I also pair this with the Yes to tomatoes daily repair treatment and yes to carrots daily moisture lotion.</li>
    <li> my daughter uses this along with cucumber moisturizer.  she loves it and uses both daily.  not too gritty or heavy</li>
    <li> Christmas gift for my daughter</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a serviceable scrub but I don&#x27;t like it enough to buy it again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because of a sudden issue with acne and after using this product i have very little if not any. I love the Yes to line.</li>
    <li> My son, 14, really likes this product.  He is using the gel and pore scrub.  He has only been using for a week now, but so far it is not making his skin oily as some others reviewers had mentioned.</li>
    <li> This product really has made my skin smoother and pimple free.  I recommend this product but it needs to be used on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> I started getting bad break outs on my forehead in my 20s and used a bunch of products. At that time proactive was the only one that worked but its pretty expensive. Fast forward a couple of years and I&#x27;m having the same issues with my skin. I saw the reviews for this product and wanted to see if there was a less expensive option. Much to my surprise this worked really well and I saw results in about 3 days or so. I use it once per day in the morning and use green tea face wipes at night. My break outs are hormone driven so its not completely gone but its a huge improvement at a much better price point.</li>
    <li> This scrub is excellent!  In the past I have used similar products, but this one stands out.  It is not rough on skin, but effectively exfoliates.  I recommend using the scrub 2-4 times a week for best results.</li>
    <li> My sin has oily skin and other products are to harsh for him.  This is perfect and works great.</li>
    <li> This is very thin and loaded with grit. It&#x27;s a slime propelled sand and tears up your skin.</li>
    <li> I really do love all the Yes To Tomato products. This stuff has really helped my skin, but I especially love that it&#x27;s natural and so it doesn&#x27;t irritate my face (or burn it) like other products do. I use this along with the Acne Daily Repair and Daily Balancing Moisturizer. Best thing about this product is it&#x27;s free of parabens, phthalates and sls.</li>
    <li> This is working wonderfully to help clear up my DD&#x27;s skin.  She is also using the YTT daily moisturizer &amp; Acne Daily Repair Treatment.  She loves them all &amp; we are VERY impressed the difference it has made.  I put off buying yet another product line because I felt it was just false hope for her &amp; wouldn&#x27;t be any better than the YTCucumbers cleanser &amp; milk of magnesia, but I was wrong!  Now I am so happy I bought it &amp; wish I&#x27;d have bought it sooner.  She doesn&#x27;t get the big cystic pimples/ acne, but gets a lot of smaller ones (clusters) along her hair line, the sides of her face, &amp; forehead pretty regularly.  She has actually pretty much always had a constant presence of acne in those areas until now.  She still uses MOM sometimes, but not the every other night like she used to.  I am VERY impressed &amp; so grateful!!</li>
    <li> I use the whole facial line of the Yes To Tomato products. This one I could do without. First off, the smell is awful. Like I said, I use all the tomato products so I should be used to the unique smell, but this one is the worst. Second, it does not exfoliate my skin at all. My skin tends to get little dry flaky patches that this does not take care of when my other apricot pore scrub would. Third, I don&#x27;t really like the consistency of it. It&#x27;s a little runny and the beads stay more on my hands then they do on my face. Fourth, did I mention the smell?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the Tomato line, but this product is just not their best. I&#x27;ll be busting out my apricot scrub once I&#x27;m done with this bottle.</li>
    <li> I end up kind of pale apfert using it, but it a great scrub!</li>
    <li> the only thing i do not like is that it just gushes out of the tube.  however, the product is excellent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty pleased with this product. I haven&#x27;t used too many pore scrubs in the past, so not much to compare to, but the fact that it is almost all natural is definately a plush. I started noticing black heads on my nose and after scrubbing it with this they are now smaller and hopefully will be gone in a couple of washes.</li>
    <li> good for acne but does not clean your face even when you already remove your make up beforehand with a make up wipe, and theres just a lil residue of foundation left. it will not clean it for you and leave it streaky on your cheeks and forehead. what the even heck???!</li>
    <li> I really like using this face wash with my clarisonic. Great combination!</li>
    <li> This face wash rocks! I love this scrub so much and it works great to keep my skin nice and clear. Works just as well as, or maybe even better, than Proactiv.</li>
    <li> Love the smell.  Very clean.  It&#x27;s gentle and leaves my skin feeling smooth.</li>
    <li> I am 26 and have had a problem with breakouts that started about 4 years ago.  Suffering from mild adult acne is no fun as I&#x27;m sure you can imagine, and I have spent TONS of money trying to find something that can actually clear my skin and help fade discoloration.  I am pleased to say that Yes To Tomatoes pore scrub has answered my prayers.  I have been using it for a couple of months now, but it actually produced results within a week or so.  Within that first week I noticed clearer/less oily skin, tighter pores, and an overall smoother feel to my face.  My skin&#x27;s not perfect, but we&#x27;re getting there.  I have used everything from Clearasil to Neutrogena to Proactiv to more expensive brands from Sephora and Origins, and it is such a relief to have stumbled upon this scrub.  I will never use anything again (unless they stop making it or it stops working for me)!  For now though, I am 99% satisfied with this product.  I say 99% because I do have one complaint--the smell!  It is definitely not pleasant and sometimes I have to hold my breath when I wash my face, but I look at it as a small price to pay because this product has worked wonders on my stubborn skin!  In fact, I ran out of my bottle about 3 days ago and my skin is already starting to break out and produce extra oil.  I&#x27;m not kidding when I say that I am going to submit this review and then run to Walgreen&#x27;s to get some more ASAP!</li>
    <li> I love this scrub, under normal circumstances.  However, the bottle I received was chunky, to the point that I couldn&#x27;t squeeze out anything.  Chunks of the scrub would get stuck and clog the opening.  I&#x27;d have to shake the bottom, squeeze out a small portion, only for it to clog again.  Not sure if it was just a bad bottle or what, but it was definitely disappointing.</li>
    <li> Cleans deep and is gentle to sensitive skin. No red after effects.</li>
    <li> After reading reviews I decided to give something more natural a try.  Was worried it would actually smell like tomatos, but it doesnt.  It&#x27;s a great scrub so far, only used it a few times so far so no results, however my skin did feel great and fresh after using it.</li>
    <li> The smell takes some adjusting to: it is very herbal. I like that the exfoliant is bamboo instead of sand, but I don&#x27;t think it exfoliates quite as well. That being said, I am very pleased with the purchase. This is the first scrub with salicylic acid I have tried that doesn&#x27;t cause an allergic reaction. Although more expensive than some other items I have tried (I can&#x27;t seem to find coupons, etc.) I use significantly less product per day so it should even out. It washes off well and doesn&#x27;t cause redness.</li>
</ol>
