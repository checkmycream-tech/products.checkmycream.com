      <li>the colors are awesome!  </li>
      <li>but it is beautiful</li>
      <li>but wasnt happy that didnt come with beads you need</li>
      <li>Still a great value, just order your micro beads elsewhere.</li>
      <li>they are perfect quality and they are SO easy to put in your hair!</li>
      <li>These are great feathers, the length and the price are good.  </li>
      <li>Nice product great price</li>

      <li>Beautiful color of feathers(i love them), and they got here in a resaonable time.</li>

      <li>Very pleased, will order from again.</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>The colors are beautiful; true to the picture and about 6\\&quot; in length.  </li>
      <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE! :)</li>
      <li>WE HAVE RECIEVED SO MANY COMPLIMENTS ON THEM.  </li>
      <li>The feather is ok.</li>
      <li>AND I AM ORDERING MORE TODAY.  </li>
      <li>We have ordered from Sexy Sparkles before and we will order from them again.  </li>
      <li>you can also just braid the feather into a braid for a cute style too.  </li>
      <li>I love these feathers.</li>
      <li>didnt come with any kind of instructions or helpful tips like I received from orhers so had to make another order just for couple beads but guess not bad</li>
      <li>I LOVE THE PRICE, COLOR, TEXTURE, AND SUPER SPEEDY SHIPPING.</li>
      <li>The feathers are super cute but what they dont tell you is that you need a special kit with a bead and threader and stuff in order to put it in the correct way.  </li>
      <li>The color is beautiful, and the bundle is long!</li>
      <li>After purchasing another set of feathers from this person, I ordered these purple ones for my sister because I loved my first purchase so much.</li>
      <li>Been putting in my own feather extensions and have a few these are nice and well made!</li>
      <li>worth it!</li>
      <li>The colors are not as bright as the picture, but I actually prefer the color I got.</li>
      <li>It was super simple to install them in their hair and They are a good length for their hair.</li>
      <li>overall the feathers are very cute</li>
      <li>all the colors are very pretty and you will loveeee it</li>
      <li>/&gt;So easy to do yourself, and soooo much</li>
      <li>but if you dont have the beading and threading kit then you wont ever get to put them in the right way.</li>
      <li>The pictures leads one to believe there are many feathers when in fact there were only 2-4 feathers.  </li>
      <li>Very misleading!</li>
      <li>And if you buy more than one, they put them in the same skinny envelope but charge you double, or triple or however many you buy.  </li>
      <li>The feathers were exactly as described and they were shipped immediately.</li>
      <li>First of all...</li>
      <li>MY FIRST ORDER WAS 15 FEATHER COMBOS</li>
      <li>Its a gorgeous yet sophisticated dark purple and mix of other colors.</li>
      <li>They love them so far, but they&#x27;ve only been in for a day.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had feather extensions from a high end Salon and paid $75 for 5 strands.</li>
      <li>They last a long time through many washings and I have ordered repeatedly from this company.</li>
      <li>I ordered a packet of brown micro beads for a few bucks from another company, and they hold up much better.</li>
      <li>The only thing is after a while they start to fade to a light pink color</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s pretty short definitely not 4-7&#x27;</li>
      <li>They still look new even though I&#x27;m constantly shampooing them and swimming in chlorinated pools for a couple hours 3 times a week.  </li>
      <li>the most serious is that I bought several and I felt cheated when opening the package.</li>

<li> is the worst product I ever bought on amazon, not looking for anything like the images of samples.</li>

I ordered a packet of brown micro beads for a few bucks from another company, and they hold up much better. Still a great value, just order your micro beads elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Nice product great price but wasnt happy that didnt come with beads you need didnt come with any kind of instructions or helpful tips like I received from orhers so had to make another order just for couple beads but guess not bad</li>
    <li> veryyy beautifull but it is very different from the picture but it is beautiful all the colors are very pretty and you will loveeee it i will recommend it to a friend</li>
    <li> These five feathers are the narrow ones which are bound together as one piece with a silicone bead.  The colors are beautiful; true to the picture and about 6\\&quot; in length.  I&#x27;ve worn them for about a month without any problem with color fading.  They still look new even though I&#x27;m constantly shampooing them and swimming in chlorinated pools for a couple hours 3 times a week.  A great purchase!</li>
    <li> I bought these for my twin nieces. They love them so far, but they&#x27;ve only been in for a day. It was super simple to install them in their hair and They are a good length for their hair.</li>
    <li> Been putting in my own feather extensions and have a few these are nice and well made! worth it! Cheaper than the salon</li>
    <li> Beautiful color of feathers(i love them), and they got here in a resaonable time. Very pleased, will order from again.</li>
    <li> The feathers are super cute but what they dont tell you is that you need a special kit with a bead and threader and stuff in order to put it in the correct way.  i knew nothing about this and i read the reviews before i bought it.  i just tied the feather into my sister&#x27;s hair with a string because im not going to pay for another kit just for a fad.  you can also just braid the feather into a braid for a cute style too.  overall the feathers are very cute but if you dont have the beading and threading kit then you wont ever get to put them in the right way.</li>
    <li> I actually thought I was gonna get a bunch of these feather&#x27;s.It is actually just one single feather. The picture is deceiving. waist of money!!</li>
    <li> I love these feathers. i will ALWAYS buy these feathers and all the different colors. they are perfect quality and they are SO easy to put in your hair! LOVE LOVE LOVE! :)</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed in this item.  The pictures leads one to believe there are many feathers when in fact there were only 2-4 feathers.  Very misleading!</li>
    <li> We have ordered from Sexy Sparkles before and we will order from them again.  The feathers were exactly as described and they were shipped immediately.</li>
    <li> The feather is ok. It&#x27;s too short and it says they&#x27;re five of them but it&#x27;s only 1 -__-  Why do you say it&#x27;s 5 when it&#x27;s only one feather? I was disappointed. It holds up good in the hair but it&#x27;s pretty short definitely not 4-7&#x27;</li>
    <li> is the worst product I ever bought on amazon, not looking for anything like the images of samples. the most serious is that I bought several and I felt cheated when opening the package. I usually organize parties and would never recommend anyone buy them, is false advertising. They look so bad, cheap, horrible, that I threw, I was ashamed to show them or regararlas my guests at the party theme.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;es el peor producto que he comprado en amazon, no luce para nada parecido a las imagenes de muestras. lo mas grave es que compré varias y me sentí estafada al abrir el paquete. yo suelo organizar fiestas y NUNCA recomendaria a nadie adquirirlas, es una publicidad engañosa. Lucen tan mal, baratas, horribles, que las boté, me daba verguenza enseñarselas o regararlas a mis invitadas en la fiesta tematica.</li>
    <li> These are great feathers, the length and the price are good.  They last a long time through many washings and I have ordered repeatedly from this company.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE these extensions!!! I have 2 of them! The color is beautiful, and the bundle is long! The only thing is after a while they start to fade to a light pink color but I like pink too so I don&#x27;t mind!</li>
    <li> the colors are awesome!  only wish the feathers would stay together when I use them again,  the bond doesn&#x27;t keep them together long.  a bit expensive but are pretty.</li>
    <li> First of all...you dont get 5 feathers. We got one! How are you supposed to put a regular feather in your hair? Something has to be missing. But what? This is the firat one I have ever bought my daughter.</li>
    <li> You get one skinny feather and a thread.  You don&#x27;t get the little tool to put them on with.  And if you buy more than one, they put them in the same skinny envelope but charge you double, or triple or however many you buy.  Rip OFF!</li>
    <li> MY FIRST ORDER WAS 15 FEATHER COMBOS AND I AM ORDERING MORE TODAY.  WE HAVE RECIEVED SO MANY COMPLIMENTS ON THEM.  I LOVE THE PRICE, COLOR, TEXTURE, AND SUPER SPEEDY SHIPPING.</li>
