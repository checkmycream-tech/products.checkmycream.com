      <li>I haven&#x27;t been pleased with it for quite some time but my loyalty to the brand kept me from exploring.  </li>
      <li>It smells ok but is too oily and sticky for my dreadlocks...</li>
      <li>Like many relationships, my hair and Carol&#x27;s Daughter&#x27;s union must come to an end.  </li>
      <li>I braided it up using the loc butter hoping it would make the braids look better for longer.</li>
      <li>I love putting this in my hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll probably try it on my hair one more time and then use it as foot/body oil if I still don&#x27;t like it.</li>
      <li>I think you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
      <li>It was a better hold than most product I have tried.</li>
      <li>I gave it to a friend with 4b hair and they love it.</li>
      <li>It was more of a strong wax.</li>
      <li>This was my first time ever using anything made by Carol&#x27;s Daughter, I find the loc butter to be the best I have used thus far.</li>
      <li>This leave my hair soft with a great shine.</li>
      <li>Good for moisturizing, but for locking, not so much...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m kind of waiting for my hair to grow out a little more, but it smells great and has a very smooth texture</li>
      <li>The smell is a tad strong, but I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
      <li>Smell is too strong for me.</li>
      <li>I will probably never use this again, because I find that Shea butter works just as well for hold and doesn&#x27;t smell as strong.</li>
      <li>The product is light, yet functional.     </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light and fragrant.</li>
      <li>I think that is important to mention in  this review.</li>
      <li>Love the product, thanks!</li>
      <li>Originally, this was another concern.</li>
      <li>I have tried a number of different products on my daughters loc&#x27;s, this is by far the best one.</li>
      <li>, I wasn&#x27;t to sure about the scent but by the next day I liked it a lot.  </li>
      <li>I live outside the US and havent been able to buy the product in person since I ran out in over 6 months, so I was happy to get it in the mail.</li>
      <li>This Butter adds great shine and not very greasy.</li>
      <li>Smell was not very bad at all light citrus scent but eventually faded.</li>
      <li>My loctician used Joie MyGel and I had a mild allergic reaction.</li>
      <li>Carol&#x27;s Daughter was one of the first lines I became familiar with.  </li>
      <li>This is my first time using this product!</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t bear to throw the product away since I paid so much for it, but I haven&#x27;t used it since and will never use it again!!</li>
      <li>I was excited when I first walked into the flagship store in Brooklyn.</li>
      <li>My hair is very healthy and growing really long.  </li>
      <li>I can also use it to blend with some essential oils and make my own creamy hair products and body lotions.</li>
      <li>I plan to order more and wish there were larger sizes available.</li>
      <li>Just today I rubbed some in my hands and put more (just on my oldests) twists (they were about a week old) and here we go with the shiny hair again.  </li>
      <li>I have purchase this many times directly from the manufacturer and it never looked like this.</li>
      <li>It gives my Hair the right type of moister it needs.</li>
      <li>I will be coming back again to get more.</li>
      <li>Fifteen bucks is a bit much for the size, but I&#x27;m not complaining because this is a QUALITY product!</li>
      <li>this is the first product I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
      <li>This was the first product that I tried by Carol&#x27;s Daughter....</li>
      <li>twist outs last for weeks, although I usually don&#x27;t go more than a week without washing my hair.</li>
      <li>, she just laughed, my youngest was shiny but just a bit less since her hair is more reddish brown with some bits of dark blond.  </li>
      <li>As I lived in different parts of the country, where black hair products were not in abundance, Carol&#x27;s Daughters online store was great.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Smell is too strong for me. Makes  your hair feel nice if you can get past the smell.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my daughter&#x27;s hair. I braided it up using the loc butter hoping it would make the braids look better for longer. When I took the braids down a week later, tons of hair came out with each braid. It was like she lost half of the volume of her hair!! I can&#x27;t bear to throw the product away since I paid so much for it, but I haven&#x27;t used it since and will never use it again!!</li>
    <li> When it says \\&quot;loc\\&quot;... that&#x27;s what it does... I had to cut my hair-ends.  If you have dread locs... then it&#x27;s good, but for twisty... don&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> The product is discolored. I have purchase this many times directly from the manufacturer and it never looked like this. I am concerned that it may be old or a counterfeit version.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using Carol&#x27;s Daughter&#x27;s and I am looking forward to using other products in the line for me and and my daughter&#x27;s hair. Besides the wonderful scent, the loc butter helps hold my daughter&#x27;s styles into place a lot longer, while adding a nice sheen as well.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend Carol&#x27;s Daughter Loc Butter for African American&#x27;s w/natural hair. I thought long and hard about purchasing the product, because I didn&#x27;t know anyone who&#x27;d personally tried it. There&#x27;s no residue build up. The product is light, yet functional.     Also, I LOVE the aroma!!! Originally, this was another concern. I had no idea what the product would smell like. Carol&#x27;s Daughter did not disappoint! I will definitely purchase it again!</li>
    <li> I heard a lot of great reviews for this product, but I think it is just OKAY. I thought it would smell like tangerines since the carol&#x27;s daughter website shows an image of tangerines falling out of a can of this stuff and it is in the ingredient list, but it smells nothing like tangerines and nothing like citrus/fruit. I will probably never use this again, because I find that Shea butter works just as well for hold and doesn&#x27;t smell as strong. I&#x27;m sure others have had better experiences, this is just my own opinion/review.</li>
    <li> This is the only &#x27;loc butter&#x27; product I will use on my hair.  I love it!</li>
    <li> This loc&#x27;ing butter not only works wonderfully, it smells great as well. It goes a long way towards moisturizing too. So easy to use, you might learn to twist your own hair. I did!</li>
    <li> This Pomade wasn&#x27;t thick enough to hold my locs. It was really greasy. i will not be ordering this again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been natural for about 14 years now, and loced for 15 months. When I first went natural, I used CD products all the time, then found that there were other/better things out there including products I could make at home for far less. After being loced for a while and latching in the beginning, I decided I didn&#x27;t like how latching was making my hair look. I work out a lot, so I don&#x27;t put too much stock into into retwisting. I also try to avoid a lot of product build up. I decided to try the Loc butter when my new growth became too much and latching wasn&#x27;t something I wanted to do anymore. I like the smell. I don&#x27;t like how greasy the product is. Grease does not equal moisture. It also doesn&#x27;t hold that well and leaves my hair looking dull for days even when I&#x27;ve usually done an BS and ACV rinse before retwisting. I&#x27;d like to find a product that is somewhere between this one and gel. It is possible I may be using too much product. I&#x27;ll probably try it on my hair one more time and then use it as foot/body oil if I still don&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> There is nothing  remarkable about this product. It is for no better word a hair greese. I brought it after watching a tutorial on Utube. In the hope that it will make natural hair easier to style. Well it does not really. Its a heavier than normal gresse and gives a slightly straighter appearance. But it is no remarkable. I have a 4B type hair. I think that is important to mention in  this review.</li>
    <li> Carol&#x27;s Daughter Loc butter is one of my HG (Holy Grail) products--I love, love, LOVE it! I use it once a week to set my natural type 4 hair for a twist out after washing and conditioning it. This is the ONLY product I use, and it leaves my hair moisturized, shiny, fluffy, AND it gives it hold without being stiff. The smell is a tad strong, but I don&#x27;t mind. A little goes, a long, long way. My jar has lasted me since February of this year and I have more than half left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My twist outs last for weeks, although I usually don&#x27;t go more than a week without washing my hair.</li>
    <li> This is my staple  product for twist out, I&#x27;ve tried all the rest but they didn&#x27;t work for me. This leave my hair soft with a great shine. I applied on wet hair, twist and the next day when I wear my hair I get lots of compliment. At fist I wasn&#x27;t too crazy about the smell but I got use to it.</li>
    <li> I was initially hesistant to try this product as I believed that I needed 100% beeswax to maintain my locs.After trying the Loc Butter I realize that my initial thoughts were incorrect. Not only does it hold the locs but it gives it an added sheen. My scalp feels moist, not dry as it usually had in the past. I will continue to use this product exclusively.</li>
    <li> This butter was a life saver for my daughter&#x27;s 4c hair</li>
    <li> This product has done wonders for my dreadlocks and I use it daily on my hair and my daughter&#x27;s. The purity of the ingredients is what I really appreciate since my daughter has various allergies and is not affected by CD products at all. Since using it, my locks are fuller, thicker, and the nice citrusy smell is a plus. I plan to order more and wish there were larger sizes available. Fifteen bucks is a bit much for the size, but I&#x27;m not complaining because this is a QUALITY product!</li>
    <li> This product is great for so many things. I can melt it and use it to seal the ends of my hair. I can also use it to blend with some essential oils and make my own creamy hair products and body lotions. I can also use it on my hair and skin just the way it is. This is a great product.</li>
    <li> I know this product is for locks and twists but I found another way it works well on your hair. Occasionally I use this product to straighten my unrelaxed hair. You would apply a little on each section to straighten. This will make your hair Bone Straight, but if you use to much it will result in a limp, greasy, waxy mess.  Beware the smell is addicting!!!</li>
    <li> This I Looooove!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m on my second or third jar. My family loves it also!!! Yaayyyy!!</li>
    <li> Read all the reviews. Like it. Does a great job moisturizing.  Will become a part of my hair care.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using this product! I don&#x27;t have any complaints, and if my locs could talk they would tell you how wonderful this product works!</li>
    <li> This Loc Butter is great. I have tried a number of different products on my daughters loc&#x27;s, this is by far the best one. I will be using Carol&#x27;s daughter from now on!</li>
    <li> This was my first time ever using anything made by Carol&#x27;s Daughter, I find the loc butter to be the best I have used thus far. It was a better hold than most product I have tried. The product smells great and my hair dries with moisture. But the moisture does not stay. I have to add product to my hair the next day. If anyone knows of a great hold for 2 strand twist please let me know at lavorges@yahoo.com</li>
    <li> This is a great product...fast shipping and great packaging.&lt;br /&gt;This product saved my hair from breaking off...after using the loc butter for about one month my locs were thicker and did not break.....</li>
    <li> I love this product. A little goes a long way. It&#x27;s light and fragrant. My loctician used Joie MyGel and I had a mild allergic reaction. So I purchased the Loc Butter and it didn&#x27;t give me any reaction. I&#x27;ve read several posts that mention the heaviness of the product. My response would be that the product is for dreadlocks which is why it contains beeswax. However, you can use it as a light pomade or to style, but don&#x27;t be heavy handed with it. My jar last me an entire year and maybe even longer. I palm roll my locs once a month only using a large spoonful of the product. That&#x27;s it! So if the product is weighing heavy on your hair, you are using WAY TOO MUCH!</li>
    <li> Good for moisturizing, but for locking, not so much...</li>
    <li> I really like Carols Daughter loc butter. Although, I don&#x27;t work on my own hair, it&#x27;s perfect when you&#x27;re in between maintenance. It&#x27;s not too heavy, so there&#x27;s no buildup. I recommend buying this item.</li>
    <li> I did a twist out with this product and my hair was beautiful and moisturized. This product is just really greasy that&#x27;s the only downside</li>
    <li> I started going natural eight years ago. There were not nearly as many natural hair care lines for black hair back then, as there is now.  Carol&#x27;s Daughter was one of the first lines I became familiar with.  I was excited when I first walked into the flagship store in Brooklyn. The candles, oils, and hair products appealed to me.  I started using the Loc Butter on and off.  As I lived in different parts of the country, where black hair products were not in abundance, Carol&#x27;s Daughters online store was great.  Like many relationships, my hair and Carol&#x27;s Daughter&#x27;s union must come to an end.  Yesterday I threw out the remainder of my Loc Butter.  I haven&#x27;t been pleased with it for quite some time but my loyalty to the brand kept me from exploring.  It just does not hold my hair like I prefer.  I have to retwist it to often.  I decided to go with Jane Carter&#x27;s twist and loc.  I am quite pleased with Jane Carter&#x27;s products.</li>
    <li> Love the product, thanks!</li>
    <li> My daughters and I don&#x27;t have locs we have natural hair (no perm) we&#x27;ve been like this for a few years.  I&#x27;ve wanted to try this for a while but never had the chance until now.  I think I have an addiction to Amazon.  I love this site, I&#x27;ve found things that I never thought they sold.  Anywho, this loc butter is for everyone (in my opinion), I do a two-strand twists on my daughers&#x27; and my hair and this is very nice, I wasn&#x27;t to sure about the scent but by the next day I liked it a lot.  I like the hair dripping wet when I first condition their hair, then I put a bit of Jane Carter&#x27;s serum and nourish &amp; shine, then a bit of Wen by Chaz Dean back in the hair, then I use this towards the end.  Now my oldest has very dark black hair and her shine was amazing, I told her we needed shades to look at her hair, she just laughed, my youngest was shiny but just a bit less since her hair is more reddish brown with some bits of dark blond.  Just today I rubbed some in my hands and put more (just on my oldests) twists (they were about a week old) and here we go with the shiny hair again.  When hair is wet you feel a bit of the wax in the product but it&#x27;s no big deal since I need something to help with our frizz.  I&#x27;m going to have to stock up on this.  It was a great purchase, it was packaged very nicely and of course I love the quick delivery (by two days - Prime member).  Try it I think you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> I will recommend this product to any who is looking for a good holding  butter. It gives my Hair the right type of moister it needs. Where I live now it is very dry, no moister in the air whatsoever. But this Loc butter have brought life back to my hair.. Thanks</li>
    <li> I love putting this in my hair. My dreads have grown since I started using this and my hair doesn&#x27;t look so dry and dingy.</li>
    <li> I had been dying to try this for a while and I finally bought it. It smells ok but is too oily and sticky for my dreadlocks... I would have to wash pillow case daily.</li>
    <li> I use this product on my natural hair for twist outs after shampooing and conditioning. It hold&#x27;s my styles well with no build up or greasy residue, but gives my hair a nice shine. A little goes a long way. I also use this in my daughter&#x27;s hair who has a relaxer and it works well with flat ironing. Would recommend for anyone who has problems with frizziness during twistouts or other natural styles.</li>
    <li> I live outside the US and havent been able to buy the product in person since I ran out in over 6 months, so I was happy to get it in the mail. Until I found out that the formula has completely changed. Same price, of course, but no as good as the past. In the past it held quite well, defined my hair and wasnt overly greasy. It was more of a strong wax. Now it might as well be a hair grease. What a waste of money. Im returning it.</li>
    <li> It is the only thing I have used to do my Locks for the few years I have had them.</li>
    <li> Its lite hair grease that the whole family can use. It smelled great. I love that I can used it in everybody hair.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I was looking for. The product is making my locs unravel. I have been growing my locs for 4 years now and this is the first product I&#x27;ve ever used that is causing my hair to come a loose.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s awesome. Doesn&#x27;t geel heavy nor does it build up. Makes moisture in the LOC method last longer. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> My daughter used it on her thick natural hair, and she said it really work in her twist out!</li>
    <li> This product works great in all three of my daughters hair! I will be coming back again to get more.</li>
    <li> After trying several loc gels which left my daughters twists and twists out feeling and looking so dry, i decided to try carol daughter butter loc. After reading reviews I was hesitant because of others mentioning the unpleasant smell. Ive tried other carols daughters products in the past and liked them. Soon as I received the loc butter I applied on my daughters washed hair(she has 4c coarse hair) so I applied it to damp hair and twisted. Smell was not very bad at all light citrus scent but eventually faded. You only need to use a little of the loc butter too much will make hair heavy. Butter is non greasy and did the trick. Twists and twist out results were fantastic very very pleased!  Also hair was shiny.</li>
    <li> Great loc butter.  My hair is very healthy and growing really long.  Pls beware this is \\&quot;loc\\&quot; butter (aka dreadlocks) for those that do not know.  You can use it as a pomade for your hair is you do not have locs but it is sticker than regular pomades.  The only con is that I wish it was clear... you will need to sleep with a pillowcase cover and make sure your hair is completely dry before wearing anything white...</li>
    <li> This Butter adds great shine and not very greasy. This was the first product that I tried by Carol&#x27;s Daughter....loved it</li>
    <li> This loc butter is perfect for sealing my ends in two stand twists or braids. It&#x27;s the best out there!</li>
    <li> My family has always loved Carol Daughter&#x27;s products. This is the best price I&#x27;ve found for it anywhere. And this is a good size.</li>
    <li> I like Carol&#x27;s Daughter products but I didn&#x27;t like this product; I found it to be sticky and my hair did not turn out the way I thought it would.  I do, however, like the shampoos and conditioners.</li>
    <li> I brought this Loc Butter for my mother, she has thick curly Polynesian hair.. She just loves it, makes her hair shines, smooth, easy to comb, and just feels beautiful. I wash my hair a lot, and use this as a conditioner oil..&lt;br /&gt;And it makes my hair feel good, takes the dryness away, also great after coloring your hair. I recomend this product, to both men and women!!&lt;br /&gt;Happy Customer!&lt;br /&gt;Tamara</li>
    <li> Great came on time. Amazon was the supplier and so the product came as was described. When using the loc butter I&#x27;ve been told it has a pungent smell on locs and therefore I&#x27;ve had to mix it with a fragrance.  Anyways product came during its expected delivery.</li>
    <li> This product is just absolutely amazing for twist out! Highly recommended by me! Wish the pricing was a little more reasonable but worth the coins.</li>
    <li> I just purchased this product and would like to say that so far I like it.  It is a little oilier than I thought, but that is okay since my hair is pretty dry from the harsh cold.  Since I have no perms or relaxers in my hair, I think this product might be a good complement.</li>
    <li> Excellent hold and good for the hair!</li>
    <li> I have locs and I&#x27;m very pleased with this product .it leaves no buildup residue which I am very thankful for. Great product</li>
    <li> I have only used this product once to do two-strand twists. I had good results. I love the citrusy smell. I will try this product again for comb coils plus to moisturize my scalp.</li>
    <li> Really like this product to use for double strand twist on freshly washed natural hair.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my daughters natural kinky hair. Gives her hair a shine, without a greasy feel and has a really nice light scent.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t really used it much...I&#x27;m kind of waiting for my hair to grow out a little more, but it smells great and has a very smooth texture so I know it will be great for my twist outs!</li>
    <li> This is a very good pomade, which sucks that it&#x27;s too heavy for my hair type,(3c/4a)it was just too heavy and weighed my curls down. It smells good and I love the ingredients. I gave it to a friend with 4b hair and they love it.</li>
