      <li>I found out that the silicon is all I really need to get amazing results.</li>
      <li>but so far so good</li>
      <li>I love this product but first let me describe my hair.</li>
      <li>Nothing special and seemed overrated.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s amazing how soft and detangled it makes thick/coarse hair.</li>
      <li>It makes your hair super silky</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t come with the right products pictured above, but the one it did come with still did a good job.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s well worth it,</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is worth a try though.</li>
      <li>The products were good , only thing I received the orange kanechom not the brown one that&#x27;s the one I really want.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t come with the right product</li>
      <li>It does leave your hair soft and easy to detangle.</li>
      <li>The  two products work very well together!</li>
      <li>My hair is smooth to the touch and really, really soft.  </li>
      <li>I was a sceptic at first but the products both together are miracle workers.</li>
      <li>and I was able to use this as a deep conditioning treatment.</li>
      <li>first thing in the morning</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll get better results by using only the silicon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>- pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and my hair has grown so much by having this product in my regime.</li>
      <li>had so much slip.</li>
      <li>I like this product because it gives my hair the very silky feel</li>
      <li>The Kanechom is really just a placebo.</li>
      <li>My hair came out straight , frizzless and stayed that way for awhile.</li>
      <li>I could only imagine the actual product I wanted would&#x27;ve done a better one, though.</li>
      <li>Makes my hair very moisturized and soft!</li>
      <li>When I flat ironed that first piece!</li>
      <li>Lol Seriously!!</li>
      <li>Makes your hair feels very soft</li>
      <li>Other than making my hair soft and smell good I&#x27;m not sure if it really do much</li>
      <li>Then the next time I used the Kanechom alone and applied a hot towel for 15mins and my hair was kinky/hard after I washed it out.  </li>
      <li>It is simply amazing and a little goes a long way.</li>
      <li>Hopefully it&#x27;s just as soft and everything.</li>
      <li>I use it every 2-3 weeks on my naturally curly hair.</li>
      <li>Those of you who are natural KNOW..</li>
      <li>Let me 1st off by saying I&#x27;m natural for 2yrs 2months.</li>
      <li>The ingredients scares me, however the product made my hair really soft and silky.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t work for my hair but does wonders on my 8 year old.</li>
      <li>I mixed too much with kanechom</li>
      <li>In two years of being natural; my hair has never done this</li>
      <li>and now I&#x27;m completely sold.  </li>
      <li>Makes my hair feel soft and stronger.  </li>
      <li>I have 10-12 inch long 4a/b-c ish in the crown (if you&#x27;re into the hair typing thing) medium density, fine flat strands, low porosity natural hair with shrinkage at around 40%.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not good at it, but getting better.</li>
      <li>Not only is my hair very soft</li>
      <li>I also use it on my friends&#x27; old wigs and it brought them back to LIFE!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m African American with natural 4b/4c hair</li>
      <li>my loose curls were so soft.</li>

    <li> It makes your hair super silky I love this and it smells great highly recommend this</li>
    <li> My hair loves this stuff.  I let my daughter and sister use this product and they love  it as well.  I will be replenishing soon.  The  two products work very well together!</li>
    <li> I love this product but first let me describe my hair. I have 10-12 inch long 4a/b-c ish in the crown (if you&#x27;re into the hair typing thing) medium density, fine flat strands, low porosity natural hair with shrinkage at around 40%. I washed my hair with Castille peppermint soap rinsed then used a quarter cup of Kanechom the shea butter one and a table spoon of Silicon Mix, let my hair sit under a plastic cap for :30 mins then rinsed. OMG....my coils are so hydrated, they separated on there own without needing to manipulate them in anyway. When I woke up in the morning my hair was completely dry and get this...I can shake my hair! Those of you who are natural KNOW..first thing in the morning; hair does not shake! My coils bounced off of each other and the definition is crazy. I&#x27;m not one to chase the &amp;#34;perfect definition&amp;#34; but it is undeniable perfect(my hair so I&#x27;m biased). My hair is smooth to the touch and really, really soft.  I don&#x27;t care what the ingredients are....I DON&#x27;T CARE! In two years of being natural; my hair has never done this and I can&#x27;t stop touching it!!&lt;br /&gt;I will update this post in a month or two...*pinky promise</li>
    <li> This product has good slip no complaints</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once but so far so good, it lives up to the all around Youtube advertising</li>
    <li> I think the hype over the Kanechom conditioner is undeserved. The praise should be given to th silicon mix! When I used the Kanechom by itself it delivered lackluster results on my African American 3c hair. They were hardly any different from when I use my Organix or One and Only Conditioner. The silicon mix, however, when used by itself delivered amazing results with or withou th Kanechom conditioner added. You&#x27;ll get better results by using only the silicon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is worth a try though. I found out that the silicon is all I really need to get amazing results. The Kanechom is really just a placebo.</li>
    <li> This stuff is freaking legit!</li>
    <li> Disappointed because I received the orange container and not the brown (Shea butter) one. I tried it and it&#x27;s ok. It does leave your hair soft and easy to detangle. I&#x27;m African American with natural 4b/4c hair and I was able to use this as a deep conditioning treatment. When I flat ironed my hair after conditioning, it was a lot easier than other times. I&#x27;m giving it an ok review because I was looking forward to the brown container with Shea butter. The orange container is what I received and smells fruity. Kinda like mango :/</li>
    <li> Sad to say these product broke my hair off .....</li>
    <li> The ingredients scares me, however the product made my hair really soft and silky. Because of the ingredience I tossed the product.</li>
    <li> great product hair smells and feels amazing</li>
    <li> I did not receive the brown container as indicated in the picture. I received the same brand but a different item in a orange/yellow container. Somewhat disappointed since I really wanted the goat milk one.</li>
    <li> I leave it on over night! Makes my hair very moisturized and soft!</li>
    <li> Great product, smells wonderful</li>
    <li> I was skeptical I have to admit but the reviews on this combo were outstanding so i had to give it a try. My hair did come out silky smonth, not weighed down at all and had crazy movement. However, it did two tries to get there. You have to use the silicon mix sparingly well at least I did. I mixed too much with kanechom and I left it in too long so my hair was all hard and felt nasty after washing it out. So I used a clarifying shampoo then like a tablespoon of the silicon mix with with a lot of the kanechom. I let sit under a cap with a heat for a about 10 minutes then with no heat for an additional 20 minutes. When I rinsed I could tell it worked my hair had so much slip. I let it hair dry and my loose curls were so soft. When I flat ironed that first piece! Man it was like butter! So I do like this combo you just  have to figure out the measuring that&#x27;s gonna work for your hair.</li>
    <li> My hair was hard/kinky after I washed this product out.  I used the Kanechom with the silicon mix and my hair was hard/kinky after wash.  Then the next time I used the Kanechom alone and applied a hot towel for 15mins and my hair was kinky/hard after I washed it out.  I am relaxed.  I am going to hang on to this product to see if I can think of other ways to put it to use.</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase through this seller.  I have had great experiences with their hair product and done wonders with my hair since 2013 when first started utilizing this product.  I found that the silicon mix is a MUST to mix with my favorite conditioner which is the Chocolate. My hair has been so pampered with this product and now I&#x27;m completely sold.  The conditioner is sort of thick and creamy with a violet color smells pretty good, you can use this product alone or with the mix whatever best for your hair.  I like this product because it gives my hair the very silky feel and my hair has grown so much by having this product in my regime. Along with this product I do have other Kanechom products to mix up once and a while as my hair goes through season in the year.  Loving it!!!!</li>
    <li> Mixed-type hair, cut my blow drying/straightening time in half almost.</li>
    <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair is finally manageable!</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed that I did not receive the one that was in the brown container with shea butter.  However I received one that was in an ORANGE and yellow container.  I used it and felt a tingling sensation so I only had in for about 3 mins as  Indicated.</li>
    <li> Let me 1st off by saying I&#x27;m natural for 2yrs 2months. I have kinky curly hair, but it&#x27;s curlier in the front. Probably bc I don&#x27;t wrap it like I should at night. Btw my hair is VERY DRY. I&#x27;m always frustrated bc I want it to be the texture all over. I put this on my hair tonight after washing and I&#x27;m speechless!! Smh It has my hair sooooo soft and defining my curls more making them POP more!! I&#x27;m leaving it on with a 2 plastic caps overnight and then rinsing out. Hopefully it&#x27;s just as soft and everything. I&#x27;m sure it will bc I&#x27;m so amazed. I prayed to Jesus about my hair bc I&#x27;m not a hair person. I&#x27;m not good at it, but getting better. I feel like this is God answering my prayers...no joke! Lol Seriously!! Don&#x27;t hesitate ordering. It&#x27;s well worth it, especially this combo. I&#x27;m just in awe!! 😁 All smiles!!😊</li>
    <li> The products were good , only thing I received the orange kanechom not the brown one that&#x27;s the one I really want.</li>
    <li> I guess this works wonders for most but it did nothing for me. I used with and with out heat. I also played with the amount of time I left it on my hair. Nothing worked.  Everyones hair is different and this isn&#x27;t the product for me. I will not purchase again</li>
    <li> It was alright. Nothing special and seemed overrated. I also didn&#x27;t get the same kanechom product as displayed in the picture</li>
    <li> This is a great product! Not only is my hair very soft but it&#x27;s also manageable and it makes your hair smell great.</li>
    <li> The best conditioner ever. I love it. My hair is so healthy and shiny now.</li>
    <li> This stuff has changed my hair routine! It is simply amazing and a little goes a long way. I use it every 2-3 weeks on my naturally curly hair. It leaves my hair feeling as if there is a barrier on it and there is also an incredible shine. I can&#x27;t wait to try the other Kanechom with the Silicon mix.</li>
    <li> This was awful. Made my hair worse.&lt;br /&gt;I will be returning this product asap.</li>
</ol>
