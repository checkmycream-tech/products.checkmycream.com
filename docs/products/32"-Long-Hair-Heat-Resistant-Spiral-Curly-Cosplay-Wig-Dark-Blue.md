    <li> great wig for the price. you can kind of see the netting, but if you place the hair just right or wear a hat then it&#x27;s fine. It also brushes out fairly well, if you know how to brush out curly wigs. Obviously it doesn&#x27;t come as beautifully untangled as the picture but the color is fabulous. And wearing it is very comfortable. I bought this for Halloween, but I got so many compliments on it that I might just wear it out whenever I feel like it!</li>
    <li> I am INCREDIBLY happy with this wig. It&#x27;s amazing quality, the color is exactly like the picture, and it shipped SUPER fast! As an experienced cosplayer, I can say this is one of the best wigs I have ever had. I will definitely buy from this seller again. :)</li>
    <li> These were perfect for my daughter&#x27;s &#x27;Nightmare Moon&#x27; Halloween costume. Used one for the \\&quot;mane\\&quot; and one for the tail.  They lasted all day on a 10 year old without getting too tangly. LOVE!</li>
    <li> Looks exactly like the picture! A sweet note came from it and it was also super soft with great quality materiel. Amazing!!</li>
    <li> i loved it,everyone loved it will buy from seller again</li>
    <li> This wig is terrible! I had to return it right away! I am surprised It&#x27;s gotten so many good reviews. My experience with it was horrible. Netting underneath was showing a bunch, Bangs were all uneven, long and were a complete disaster. Bad Quality and looked super cheesy. I am going to order a different Dark Blue wig from a different seller.</li>
    <li> Wow, this is a nice wig. I was really impressed! The curls are beautiful and it is so soft.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great color, and for the price, it&#x27;s a greatly mad wig. Though, the only problem I have is that it tangles a bit too easy, though it&#x27;s probably because of the length.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s true to color, nice adjustable cap, came with a net wig cap, the bangs are sewn forward &amp; LONG, if you try to part it the cap shows through, you kind of have to sweep them to the side &amp; clip them. The wig is really soft.</li>
    <li> Wow, I LOVE this wig! I got the blue one and I want to be katy perry for halloween. At first I was really nervous it wasn&#x27;t going to come in time but the shipping was so much faster than amazon projected as it came to the US in only 10 days. I opened it I realized that it was so much softer feeling than any artificial wig I had ever tried on before. It actually feels like real hair! and you can comb your fingers through it without getting them stuck. This is the best costume wig I have ever bought and the price was less than what I&#x27;ve paid for low quality plastic wigs that get ratty after just one use. I  had just tried it on for a few seconds before my 3 roommates were fighting over who got to try it on next and take pictures in it, it&#x27;s so real looking!! I think I&#x27;m going to end up cutting a few inches off of it since its really long but I went with the longer size so I could choose my own length. I also tested it out with a flat iron on low heat and it straightened and didn&#x27;t get ruined although I was a little bit nervous. This is seriously the coolest wig ever...I want to buy all the colors!!!</li>
    <li> I would recommend this seller to anyone looking to dress for ComiCon or Halloween and dress up. My daughter really enjoyed playing DJ Pony&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> So I ordered this wig for my Halloween costume and I was afraid it wouldn&#x27;t get here on time, but shipping was super fast!  . The color is exactly alike as in the picture. The curls are actually almost or about the same as in the picture. I just love it can&#x27;t wait to wear it.  It feels like real hair I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase and I would defiantly recommend it!</li>
    <li> wore it yesterday for the first time and gotten many compliments and I cant wait to wear it again! will order again</li>
    <li> I am being a superhero and I wanted a long, curly, dark blue wig. This is absolutely perfect! Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;LuluLemonLover</li>
    <li> I got the dark blue one and it is amazing! Super soft and silky and just as beautiful as in the picture! So worth the wait and completely worth the price! On top of all that it doesn&#x27;t tangle, at least not like other wigs I&#x27;ve bought. I would without a doubt buy more from this company.</li>
    <li> What a nice wig! The color is gorgeous! Lots of hair &amp; great quality. It arrived fast too! The curls are beautiful. I wore it and it got a bit tangled under the neck, but I haven&#x27;t tried to brush it out for fear that the curls wont gather like they were. I have read that fabric softener in water before attempting to detangle works like a charm, so I will be doing that plus using foam curlers to keep the curl. Great wig! I will be buying more colors soon :)</li>
    <li> Love it, can&#x27;t wait to use it!</li>
    <li> My daughter wanted this for a party, well I have yet to see it and it has been over a month!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty good besides the fact it came in two weeks late (I had ordered it two months previous). I went wig-less to the con, but i had fun to make up for my wig being late.</li>
    <li> So many compliments - used for Halloween!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not very good at all it took for ever to come in. The hair keeps falling off. And I can bearly put it on. One thing I did like....The hair net. That actually works good</li>
    <li> I love the color, texture and fit of this wig.The hair is thick and luxurious and it came with a wigcap.I can&#x27;t wait to wear it and I&#x27;m so glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> My wig was a beautiful shade of blue that went well with my costume. It was a bit thin but the length of the hair made for easy styling. I would consider purchasing from this company again!</li>
    <li> It was perfect and arrived super quick!</li>
    <li> color was total different from what is visual on website</li>
    <li> the cap is a bit too small, and I don&#x27;t have a big head. (I work in a wig shop, so I can tell this cap is a petite)&lt;br /&gt;the bangs are far from believable, but it looks great with a knitted headband.&lt;br /&gt;all in all, its worth the price, however, I haven&#x27;t checked to see how heat resistant it actually is.&lt;br /&gt;seeing that I bought it to use once, and it seems sturdy enough to last quite a while, I&#x27;m pretty happy with it for the price.&lt;br /&gt;the cap is a standard machine made weft cap with ear tabs.</li>
    <li> sheds so much and the cap itself is white which is VERY noticeable when worn. I used a marker to cover up the white part. Now im just dealing with shedding!! so much!</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have bought a dark blue wig. It is absolutely gorgeous. The only disappointment I have is that the wig cap shows to the front a bit so I will have to find a way to use some of the bang to cover it up but other than that I absolutely love it. It looks great on me. I love these wigs because they allow you to express yourself in so many different colors. The likes of which i have never seen before. Totally Awesome!</li>
    <li> I was a little unhappy with it. I mean the color is superb but the hair wasn&#x27;t exactly great. Some of it was flat, instead of life the picture where its curly and lovely. The bangs are quite long and practically cover the entire side of my face so I always have to put them in a bobby pin. I was going to use this for a cosplay but now I don&#x27;t think I want to due to the fact that it&#x27;s not curly like I was hoping. Maybe next time it will have curls? I think I just got a defaulted one. I would still recommend these because I&#x27;m sure others are better.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s beautiful! It arrived early. Might shed easily, but it was only 10$. Still seems gorgeous quality and the colour is true to the photo. It looks magical in the sunlight when taking photos.</li>
    <li> Lovely wig, can&#x27;t wait to figure out a cosplay to use it for!</li>
    <li> I use this with my clown outfit when I do parties. The bangs tend to get in the way so I have to clip it to the side.  Other than that... I love it!  Will buy another. :)</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this wig it was long it was pretty fit great I would love to order and more colors and they set me free week With it</li>
    <li> This is a very fun wig to Cosplay in :)</li>
    <li> I couldnt be happier with this wig! I used it for my Camelita Fox cosplay and it was thick and not to shiny. I recommend this to anyone :)</li>
    <li> Love it got the dark blue one and no complaints soft and lovely. Just what I expected. only issue is the cap is small so if you buy it be prepared. I have a small head but it&#x27;s just a bit tinier than mine. so thank god I could cover the parts showing. it&#x27;s just a little tangled and a little bit of fall out but otherwise not bad. the hair almost touches my butt but if I brushed and got it a little straighter it would for sure touch it (kinky((sorry had to).</li>
    <li> You can see a little of the webbing if you look close. No one noticed tho. My wife received a lot of compliments. Great wig, even better price.</li>
    <li> Best wig I&#x27;ve ever used in cosplay! I use it all the time for different ones. It styles well and doesn&#x27;t get static.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves the wig!  The color is awesome!  It looks just like the picture!</li>
    <li> Great wig. It comes with a hair net and also has elastic in the back at the base. I didn&#x27;t need to do anything out of the box. No brushing required. Curls were perfect.</li>
    <li> For the most part I am not into costplay. But I do adore Halloween. At my workplace we dress up for three months in order to sell our products. This Halloween I wanted to bring a long loved cherished idol to life. I chose the dark blue color of this product because it was just what i needed to bring a Tim burton&#x27;s Corpse Bride costume to life. I made the costume by paint and shredding a real wedding dress in order to give it realistic actuality. (UNlike the costumes you see at party city that look so cheap but is soooo expensive.) Since I have dark black long hair, Blue hair spray wouldnt show on my hair. so This wig was the icing on the cake. For once, It looks just like the photo!</li>
    <li> Well packaged and fit perfectly!</li>
    <li> Okay so I had ordered this dark blue wig on the first. And I got it today. On the exact estimate date. And I LOVE THIS WIG!! It&#x27;s so pretty. The color in the picture doesn&#x27;t do it justice. I had trouble putting it on.. But my hair is long... So I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s why I had the trouble. My only downside to this wig is the netting. It shows in the front near the bangs... And is a bit visable in the back.. But really it&#x27;s nothing a little readjusting can&#x27;t fix. Overall. I do love it. Can&#x27;t wait to wear it with my Vaporeon Cosplay!! :D</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting something great out of this wig. I paid maybe $13? I knew it would be thin, tangled, and maybe a little big as most wigs are on my head. However, this wig cap is huge. As I said, most wigs are a little big on my head. I&#x27;ve never had a wig cap this large before though. The adjustable straps? They make my head look super lumpy. Another reviewer said the wig cap was extremely small? I doubt we are all getting the same product. I haven&#x27;t decided if I am going to try to deconstruct and re size it or just return it.</li>
    <li> Came in within predicted dates. Right color, great quality, nice and thick. Its just perfect! Well priced! Worth the buy!!!!!</li>
    <li> Cheap, hard make look good.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very soft but tangles easily!</li>
    <li> I ordered the dark blue one and its really shiny and fake looking. I was expecting it to look more realistic. I dont advise anyone to buy this wig atleast the dark blue one unless you want something that looks really synthetic. Very disappointed I wear wigs because my hair doesnt grow and its obviously fake looking so Im probably not going to end up wearing it. :c</li>
    <li> Color was like the picture.  Quality was what I expected.  Wig cap was like a hair net so I went out and bought a tighter wig cap!  Hair stayed in place.  I gave it a 4 out of 5 because if not careful with the hair it will knot easily and sheds alot!!</li>
    <li> It is a very beautiful wig I got the electric blue looking one and it was very pretty, wore it out yesterday for Halloween and everyone loved it they thought it was my real hair, I love the fact that it is long and soft, but the only negatives is that it gets tangled kind of fast and the head is really tiny and tight probably it was because of my long real hair but it is pretty small and it&#x27;s kind of thin from the top but it&#x27;s still very beautiful I wore a beanie and wuala it&#x27; looked awesome! Overall it&#x27;s a good price for this wig I really liked it</li>
    <li> Oomg love this!! Totally fun fun fun!!! My husband was blown away!! Will be purchasing More :D</li>
    <li> I ordered the blue one and it is gorgeous! The color is exactly as is in the photo, and the curls are nicely done and bouncy! Super happy with it c:</li>
    <li> This is my first wig. I&#x27;m using it for a Princess Luna cosplay. This wig took a long time to get here, but that was probably because I was really excited and anxious for it to get here. It&#x27;s really soft, and the color was exactly as pictured. The wig cap fit me well and I was able to style it exactly like I wanted to. Definetly going to buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Cute long sexy wig adjustable cap so the wig stay in place even come with a hair net convenient.</li>
    <li> It looks just like the picture and is very cute but the head is far too small and I have a small head. It barely covers anything.</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved this wig! Went great with my costume.</li>
    <li> I ordered this wig and it arrived exactly a week later.  It&#x27;s the perfect colour blue and it super long which is exactly what I wanted. The only problem I have is that the curls have already fallen out for the most part and it tangles easily. But other than that I love this wig. I honestly don&#x27;t want to take it off.</li>
