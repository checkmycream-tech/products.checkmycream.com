      <li>LOVE the color!!</li>

      <li>I have fair skin</li>
      <li>It goes on like a permanent marker, which for me is great because it is so easy</li>
      <li>but you can pick up a cheap chapstick from the dollar store that works great, I use mine with nivea.</li>
      <li>It is a nice color</li>
      <li>and it just give a nice blush to my lips without looking to makeup-y.</li>
      <li>Perfect for this busy mom!!</li>
      <li>So easy to use and LOVE LOVE</li>
      <li>My new favorite lip stain!!</li>
      <li>Price is right; nice color.</li>
      <li>I would direct people to explore the Freesia and Wine colors first, but if brown tones are flattering on you, then this could be a great choice.</li>
      <li>Went right it the garbage!</li>
      <li>I dont really like this color very much because of some brown undertones that come out upon application (not flattering particularly for me), but it is much more flattering than many lip colors on the market.  </li>
      <li>So far this is my favorite product.</li>
      <li>It was much darker.</li>
      <li>I really like the color of this lip stain.  </li>
      <li>Decent color,</li>
      <li>Beware that the marker tip runs dry quickly.  </li>
      <li>I bought this item previously from Walmart that worked good , but the rest I bought barely show any color at all and are dry.  </li>
      <li>Hard to find but love it as I can leave it in my car</li>
      <li>2 stars off because it seems more dry and didn&#x27;t last as long as my other ones.</li>
      <li>Not very long lasting.</li>

<li> 2 stars off because it seems more dry and didn&#x27;t last as long as my other ones.</li>
<li> Not very long lasting.</li>
<li> However it doesn&#x27;t really last all that long on me.  </li>
<li> It is long wearing.  </li>
<li> (that&#x27;s how long I wear them).</li>
<li> This is long wearing, but for moisture you must add a gloss or lipstick.</li>
<li> This color, &amp;#34;endless spice&amp;#34; goes on like a reddish brown but after a few hours of wearing it tones down to a mature red.</li>
<li> The color changes once I put it on and due to dry mouth</li>
<li> , one was almost dry and it doesn&#x27;t apply as well as the other.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t understand how there can be so many bad reviews for this product.</li>
<li> I expected a few hours and it only lasts about an hour on me.  </li>
<li> Usually after it dries it does start to dry your lips out</li>
<li> It does have a slight transfer when drinking from a glass.</li>
<li> I usually put these on before work and forget about it.</li>
<li> You can lick your lips all you want, eat, drink, anything with these lipstains and they are guaranteed to stay on for at least 5 hours</li>
<li> Not a good product at all.</li>
<li> Waste of money!!!</li>
<li> Very disappointed.</li>
<li> Horrible!!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> It is a nice color but it definitely will not hold up for smooching or anything else the mouth might do including talking, laughing, etc.</li>
    <li> This is long wearing, but for moisture you must add a gloss or lipstick. I do recommend this for a stain.</li>
    <li> 2 stars off because it seems more dry and didn&#x27;t last as long as my other ones.</li>
    <li> Hard to find but love it as I can leave it in my car and it won&#x27;t melt!!</li>
    <li> it burns my lips just aweful no color but it burns my lips what is in this product that burns my lips I want a refund</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand how there can be so many bad reviews for this product. I picked up a tube of this in the &amp;#34;unstoppable red&amp;#34; color from the sale bin at my local store and figured to give it a try. So far this is my favorite product. It goes on like a permanent marker, which for me is great because it is so easy however that is the only thing that makes you require a mirror for application. This color, &amp;#34;endless spice&amp;#34; goes on like a reddish brown but after a few hours of wearing it tones down to a mature red. I usually put these on before work and forget about it. You can lick your lips all you want, eat, drink, anything with these lipstains and they are guaranteed to stay on for at least 5 hours (that&#x27;s how long I wear them). Usually after it dries it does start to dry your lips out but you can pick up a cheap chapstick from the dollar store that works great, I use mine with nivea.</li>
    <li> I really like the color of this lip stain.  However it doesn&#x27;t really last all that long on me.  I expected a few hours and it only lasts about an hour on me.  It does have a slight transfer when drinking from a glass.</li>
    <li> Not very long lasting. It lasted an hour tops.</li>
    <li> It needs occasional applications, if you leave it alone it will last but if you eat or apply glitter and accidentally wipe it of it will come of. I bought two of these, one was almost dry and it doesn&#x27;t apply as well as the other. I would give it 3 stars for this but I&#x27;m reviewing it based on the one that works.</li>
    <li> The lip stain works great and stays on, but the color I ordered was not the color that I received. It was much darker.</li>
    <li> I dont really like this color very much because of some brown undertones that come out upon application (not flattering particularly for me), but it is much more flattering than many lip colors on the market.

    <li> I did not like this stain at all. I didn&#x27;t like the feel of it and my boyfriend didn&#x27;t like the taste of it.  The color changes once I put it on and due to dry mouth I licked it off in about 30 minutes.  These are problems I&#x27;ve had with lipsticks.  \\&quot;I prefer \\&quot;Cream Lip Stain in the SEPHORA COLLECTION\\&quot;. It stays on for hours and it doesn&#x27;t change color after I put it on.  Stay away from this stain.</li>
    <li> I bought this item previously from Walmart that worked good , but the rest I bought barely show any color at all and are dry.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Lasts for hours, gorgeous color and I get compliments on it all of the time!! I have fair skin and it just give a nice blush to my lips without looking to makeup-y.</li>
    <li> Price is right; nice color.</li>
    <li> Nothing earth shattering here.  Decent color, but it does need to be reapplied often.</li>
    <li> My new favorite lip stain!! So easy to use and LOVE LOVE LOVE the color!! Perfect for this busy mom!!</li>
    <li> Not a good product at all. Keep your money</li>
    <li> Horrible!!! Wouldn&#x27;t even come out of the tube!!! Went right it the garbage! Waste of money!!!</li>
