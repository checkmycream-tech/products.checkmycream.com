<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My wife like it and it was a good deal.</li>
    <li> Not my favorite curling iron but for the price it is ok. I usually go through a curling iron a year. So that will be the real measure of quality. I wish it got a little hotter. That is my only complaint. My hair is about 3 inches long on top so this size curling iron suits my needs for fullness, not a lot of curl.</li>
    <li> I tought that it was smaller</li>
    <li> I love it. Gorgeous full curls. The actual curing iron is pretty too</li>
    <li> I love this curling iron!!!! It heats up quick and the curls are beautiful! I really like the little cloth.</li>
    <li> Very cheaply made. I had to return, as the clasp was so loose it wouldn&#x27;t hold my hair in. Also there is no heat settings, there was just an on and off switch. Save your money and buy a different product.</li>
    <li> Came on time and as described. Packaging was done well. Thank you!</li>
    <li> there were a few reviews i read before i bought this saying it didn&#x27;t curl their hair well...but since there were many other reviews stating it worked very well i decided to buy it.&lt;br /&gt;unfortunately...not sure if it&#x27;s my hair type or what, it does not work well in my hair. i have found other curlers that work wonders in the meantime.</li>
    <li> Barrel is very short and does not hold hair tightly.  :(</li>
    <li> Heats up quickly and creates a nice curl. For the money it&#x27;s not a bad product. I have long thick Asian hair, so I keep the temp on 425. My only complaint is that the barrel is short! I can&#x27;t wrap the entire length of my hair around it so it takes 2x longer</li>
    <li> Most women don&#x27;t know their hair well enough to write a proper review in here. I was worried with all the negative responses, but as I thought, everyone has their opinion.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is fine, a little damaged and quite long. This makes a very loose NATURAL looking curl. Meaning if you want a tight curl this is not for you. Also the thinner your hair is the more you need in the chunk you&#x27;re  curling. If you use this the right way its better for your hair in the long run than a metal curling iron. All in all a great buy if you have the patience to curl your individual hair properly. I know I&#x27;ll never go back to a metal curling iron after this. Very glad I have it.</li>
    <li> Perfect for the new beachy waves  I was craving.  I can now have that look in seconds. .  . takes little time to heat up, and is a great tool for the price!!  My hair is shoulder length and moderately thick . .  I love it!!</li>
    <li> Worst hair curl I have ever used. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> So I bought this curling iron thinking that it would work great.  I really like remington products, and have another remington curling iron that works perfectly.  I bought this one thinking that it would be just as wonderful, but it was the oposite.  First, my hair slipped right out of the clamp, and my hair also got stuck in it. Next, the curls just wouldn&#x27;t hold.  I tried holding the iron on my hair longer, adding extra hair spray, but my hair would fall flat less than an hour after styling it.  When I say flat, I mean straighter than when I started curling my hair.  I would not reccomend this to anyone who is looking for an iron that will give long-lasting beautiful curls.</li>
    <li> Barrel is silver not black. But what I hate most about this is that it doesn&#x27;t hold the hair very well while you&#x27;re curling. Cheap.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;ll curl your hair, yes, but that curl won&#x27;t hold very long. I don&#x27;t know why, considering this thing gets pretty hot. If you have short, fine hair, and all you want is a loose curl, then this is for you. But if you have long, thick, hair and you want thick, tight curls, invest in something better.</li>
    <li> I have long thick hair, it works great on my hair &amp; the curls look natural...it&#x27;s very easy to use</li>
    <li> works well, heats fast, non-stick works!!</li>
    <li> It is just OK. Not sure what all I was expecting but I was just excited it was ceramic and how evenly and quickly it heats up. First off, it isn&#x27;t all black. It is black handle with grey barrel. Second, it feels cheap when you hold it. Third of all (and most importantly) it doesn&#x27;t get that hot! I have thin hair but about twice as much thin hair as normal. So, I was expecting with an adjustable dial I would be able to get it as hot as needed. Well - - no. It says it goes up to 350 degrees (which should be MORE than enough) but I have the dial set at almost 300 and it just starts to work. No way someone with thick hair could use this successfully. I paid less than $11 for it so I can&#x27;t say too much. Just disappointed, that&#x27;s all.</li>
    <li> I was surprised at the quality of this curling iron for the pricepoint.  The 1.24 inch barrel size allows for a more natural looking curl, rather than the kinkier looking curls that a smaller size barrel allows for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The swivel cord is useful, but my long hair did get caught in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly though, I haven&#x27;t used this in months.  I bought two new flat irons, and after watching a few YouTube videos I can now create a better looking curl than curling irons produce.</li>
    <li> The barrel on this curling iron is too thick and clumsy, The ones that I&#x27;ve had in the past are thinner and easier to manipulate. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
    <li> i love it &amp;#60;3 perfect</li>
    <li> I have thick semi-wavy hair. The clamp felt weak, and the barrel is not as long as other curling irons.  My hair would just slip out of the clamp.  It might work if I used tiny sections of hair, but I don&#x27;t have time for that.  I got a different iron with a strong clamp and longer barrel that allows me to curl my long hair in 5 minutes.</li>
    <li> There are no instructions included. It&#x27;s not specified which way the settings go, if 30 means hottest or 1 means hottest. Good in a pinch</li>
    <li> The barrel is grey, not all black. Other than that it&#x27;s like other curlers I&#x27;ve had before.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Creates great size curls.  Can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> This curling iron is the perfect circumference for curling my hair.  It curls real fast so when you roll up your hair only keep it for  seconds and you&#x27;ll see the curl.  It lasts all day long.  You really see the curls if your hair has a layered cut or your hair cut has layers to frame your face.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t curl my thick hair. I have thick, long and fine hair. Did not curl at all. I tried several times.</li>
    <li> Better than the really expensive professional ones.  curls hair nicely and stays.  no damage to my hair and no need to really use hair spray and curl the hair that&lt;br /&gt;just ruins the iron</li>
    <li> i like this curling iron. It works well. It&#x27;s just not what is pictured here.</li>
    <li> Gets hot quick!! Nice case with it also. Would purchase again in a second, have it in the smaller size also.</li>
    <li> Clamp is so weak it does not hold your hair. Won&#x27;t curl your hair. I threw it away and bought a clairol model of the same barrel size that works great.</li>
    <li> ...and bought this one.  It&#x27;s horrible.  It came with a heat sleeve for storage though I don&#x27;t know why, it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to do anything to your hair.  I&#x27;ve tried using it several times, definitely the worst curling iron I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with the Remington straightener and I thought the Remington curling iron would be just as good. Nope. .. doesn&#x27;t do the job...I have thick hair. ..the child barely lasted an hour</li>
    <li> This is a great iron. Good quality, feels sturdy. My hair is still not quite long enough to use this size barrel- it leaves my hair wavy versus curly- but once my hair grows out I know it will do the job. Right now my hair is just below my shoulders but if your hair is longer than that, or looking for big loose waves this is the right size!</li>
    <li> This is a great curling iron! I&#x27;ve never really used one, but recently got a long bob cut and wanted to play with a few curls for body. Super cute and easy! This iron is big enough to make nice soft curls, but not so big that you can&#x27;t wrap your hair around a few times. It heats up quickly and comes with a nice little storage bag to prevent the cord from getting tangled with other things in my cupboard.</li>
    <li> Crappy curling iron. My hair slips out when I try to curl it &amp; the heat dial is located in a bad spot cause when I wrap my hair, it moves the heat dial. Would not recommend!</li>
    <li> The barrel is a little big.  I wish they had a 1 inch barrel.  I like other than that.  I can set how hot I want it.  It came to my door really fast.  It has an auto shut off if not in use which is good since I sometimes forget.  It does not burn my hair like the last iron I bought.  Love the price too</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t see any difference in how this and any other curling iron works.  Lately, I&#x27;ve been trying to avoid using heat on my hair so I only use this once in a while.  I like the size of the barrel.  It makes looser curls and waves.</li>
    <li> I have shoulder length thick hair and purchased the Remington straightener last year (which was also very inexpensive) and I LOVE it~it works just as well as my CHI...so I thought I would be as lucky with this curling iron...WRONG!! Does not get hot enough to make curls much less hold them~a complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> Love the look of this. I removed the clamp very easily and it is comparable to curling irons I&#x27;ve seen going for $60+. Heats up almost instantly, and the auto shut-off has come in handy at least once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No complaints- but I&#x27;m not going for tight curls, just natural waves.</li>
    <li> Just bought this to try beachy waves to my long, fine hair. I&#x27;ve had zero issues with the clamp not holding tightly onto my hair. It heats up quickly, it&#x27;s easy to use and I like the adjustable heat dial. I&#x27;m usually always on the highest level because I don&#x27;t like spending a lot of time on my hair. The 1 1/4 inch barrel is perfect for the wavy look and I like the swivel cord base at the end. Everything I would expect from a curling iron at a great price! No issues here.</li>
    <li> Just love it hot and ready to go as soon as you plug it in the wall, Love the big curls.</li>
    <li> I bought the 1 1/2 inches but I wish i would have gotten this one. its makes tighter curls but regardless i love remington products and this is no exception!</li>
    <li> Does not even hold on to your hair while trying to curl it. Hair just slides right out. Not good at all .</li>
    <li> I bought it for my wife and she likes it. A very good purchase.... I will highly recommend it...Economical as well...</li>
    <li> heats quickly, good grip, overall great curling iron. no reason to pay more when actual science shows that it doesn&#x27;t matter what kind of material is radiating the heat - heat damages hair and that&#x27;s that.</li>
    <li> great for long hair.  thermostat can be set is an advantage  easy to use</li>
    <li> Good product! Though it is a bit bigger than what i ideally wanted, but thats my fault for not further investigating the size</li>
    <li> works on my stick straight hair</li>
    <li> Very good. works well</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully, great price</li>
    <li> JUST THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF LIFT AN CURL . VERY EASY TO HANDLE  GOOD PRODUCT. HEAT UP AN HAS SETTING TO&lt;br /&gt;CONTROL HOW WARM OR HOT  YOU WANT THE UNIT.</li>
    <li> Awesome curling iron for the price. Love the heat settings,and it heats up hot fast. Can&#x27;t beat the quality for this low price!</li>
    <li> This item is very useful and handy it heats up quickly and i would strongly recommend this ceramic curing iron to anyone.</li>
    <li> Worked for awhile. It was good while it lasted. Fast shipping and good price.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I have been looking for. I love this ceramic curler! I have never been able to keep curls all day until I found this curling iron.</li>
    <li> While most the reviews are decent, there are a few customers who were unhappy with this curling iron.  I am one of the unhappy customers.  I read lots of reviews before selecting this item.  The price was right and the reviews were very good, so I thought I&#x27;d go ahead and get it.  yes, the iron does heat up very quickly and gets HOT.  I burned my forehead&#x27;s hairline slightly while trying to  reach my bangs.  This is MY FAULT, not the curling  iron.  I watched several You Tube videos for tips and how to hairstyles.  My hair is  medium length, just touching a neckline of a sweater or tee.  This iron did not curl my hair.  I tried more heat, less heat, productss, no products, &amp;#34;day old&amp;#34; hair, freshly washed hair...you name it.  All I got was a little wave at the bottom of my hair, not a curl.  In fact, I can get a little wave naturally, I don&#x27;t need a curling iron to get that.  lastly, what I DID wind up with was damaged hair and a lot of frustration.  I know I&#x27;m not the only one, as a few other customers have shared similar opinions.</li>
    <li> Curls do not hold very well, as the iron doesn&#x27;t get THAT hot.  Just wasn&#x27;t worth the hassle of returning and it works well enough with much hairspray.  You get what you pay for here, I think.</li>
    <li> Fantastic value.  works great on my hair</li>
    <li> Great buy! Excellent quality, easy to use and can achieve various size curls!</li>
    <li> I curled my hair yesterday with this curling iron. For thicker hair, it needs to be set to almost the maximum heat.. It took me barely half an hour to do it, after which, I went for a party, jumped and danced around and then went to bed. Through all of that, when I woke up this morning, my curls were still intact, maybe a tad less tight after sleeping on them, but still awesome. And I love the colour of the iron too! I am really happy with it :D</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been tempted to try one of the more expensive curling wands but decided to try this instead. For a great price I got a great product. The best part? It can be easily converted in to a curling wand!! :)</li>
    <li> this is a nice cuing iron.. If only it would hold onto your hair so you could actually curl it!</li>
    <li> I like it but not in love. My hair falls almost instantly and thought it was product I was using on my hair to keep my hair curly. I took a chance because of the price but I will need to get another one soon :(</li>
    <li> heats up fast and holds the curl, for women with longer and thicker hair i recommend. I love it but needed a smaller barrel.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s OK if have thin hair that doesn&#x27;t need much heat. I hate it and think its useless, but it could work for someone. I bought it for occasional use, but it doesn&#x27;t curl thick long hair so it will go to the styling tool graveyard.</li>
    <li> The design of this curling iron is very sleek and I had high hopes for it.  Yet, shockingly, it would not curl my hair no matter how hard I tried or how hot I allowed it to become.  I should mention that I probably have the world&#x27;s easiest hair to curl and never have come across a curling iron my hair just won&#x27;t respond to.  Your money is better spent on other Remington products - this one is a bust!</li>
    <li> This curling iron makes the perfect size curls. It heats up really quickly but never burns my hair. I notice a lot less damage too my hair when using this iron compared to others</li>
    <li> Ok curling iron. It doesn&#x27;t heat that much and barely curls. Usually Remington is pretty good quality....this one just ok.</li>
    <li> What a great curling iron. This inexpensive curling iron does the job. The curling iron  is great for my thin short hair.  Brings a lot of heat and less drizzling. Do not let the price fool you. This is a well made high quality curling iron. Works on any type of hair. You can roll your curls tightly or as loose as you want it. Great product for a low price.</li>
    <li> its not what i was expecting doesnt work the way i would like it to and the curls arent what i wanted</li>
    <li> Well i think I expected more from it... my curls last.. an hour?. I&#x27;m not use to curl my hair, so may be I don&#x27;t know the trick. Rigth now , I&#x27;m not happy with... we&#x27;ll see later</li>
    <li> I read the comments for the 3/4 inch iron and they were great and was reluctant to get the 1 1/4 inch barrel because of the one review, but I thought I&#x27;ll give it a try. I just used it as soon as I took it out of the box. It gave me the look I was looking for. The nice sexy wavy curls like the Victoria Secret models. I used it as a curling rod (wrapped my hair around the rod with the clap closed) and this was definitely cheaper than buying a curling rod. Applied some hair spray in it and it&#x27;s been an hour so far and my curls still look nice. If you look at the model for this rod her curls are definitely looser, so if you want tighter curls go for the 3/4 inch barrel. I have both.</li>
    <li> I love this curling iron. It gives such soft curls or even tighter curls, depending on length of hair. It heats up quickly and has various heat settings.</li>
    <li> Its did not get a five star because it does not hold the hair properly under the clamp...</li>
    <li> When I purchased this curling iron I was a little nervouse because of it being so inexpensive. It arrived within two days. It does a good job at curling my hair, better then more expensive ones I&#x27;ve had. Curls last all day.</li>
    <li> Really pleased with this purchase. Was looking for a nice, inexpensive electric curling iron. I have fairly thin, long hair that does not like to hold a curl. But with a lot of coaxing and hairspray this worked just fine. Great heat setting knob, though I find that if it is not very high the curls do not hold for long at all. Overall great purchase, works for my needs.</li>
    <li> OK! soo after reading alot of good reviews on Amazon i decided to purchase this but it didnt workout for me. this was my first curling iron and i was expecting it to be amazing but sorry! the one i got had a loose hook, meaning the lever that moves up and down was shaky! also i had to put it on the highest temperature to make it heat up... which can burn fine textured hair eeasily.. rest was all ok. found it very toy like but if youre 16 to 19 yr of age and looking for something for &#x27;&#x27;once ina blue moon&#x27;&#x27; then go for it. not ay bad investment.</li>
    <li> Good product for the price, but the spring does not hold up to higher level products!</li>
    <li> Make sure that you use the HOT GLOVE, my daughter didn&#x27;t and she was burned, her hair looks very cute when she styles it with this curler.</li>
    <li> Granddaughter loved it.  Couldn&#x27;t wait to try it, and said she would need more time in the bathroom in the morning to get ready for school.</li>
    <li> I needed a new curling iron and thought this would fit the bill. Unfortunately this didn&#x27;t hold my hair in the curling iron and didn&#x27;t get very hot. Set it on 30,the hottest setting, felt more like a 10. Have to send it back.</li>
    <li> I bought this curling iron to get bigger and less time consuming curls since i have very thick hair. I will admit that it is good for thin hair and big curls because I also tried it on my friend. For myself, I had to put the heat up all the way to get a decent curl, plus it took a long time to do for each individual curl. You can&#x27;t beat it for the price, but I would suggest investing in a better curling iron instead if you don&#x27;t have thin hair.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of fine, straight, hard to curl hair and this curling iron leaves them in all day and night....without the expensive price tag of other higher end products.</li>
    <li> Does not get as hot as a metal curling iron, curls do not stay as long as when I use my metal one</li>
    <li> It does the job, and the price is good.  Showed up on time.</li>
    <li> I like this curling iron it heats fast and easy to use, it is not heavy which is awesome, I would recommend this product to anyone no matter what their hair length is.</li>
    <li> If you want an old-school curling iron at an old-school price, this is for you.  But I have found it difficult to use, and it doesn&#x27;t do a great job at curling my hair.  The curl doesn&#x27;t stay well. Also, this may sound weird, but the barrel isn&#x27;t as smooth as it could be, so my hair doesn&#x27;t really glide in it. On a good note, it heats quickly and has lots of heat settings. I suggest spending a little more on a newer style iron. Consequently, it hasn&#x27;t made it into my daily repertoire.</li>
    <li> it left the clamp stamp on my head. it did not get hot enough for me. curls were ok. curling iron itself is nice looking. thats why i bought it but it did not give results that i wanted. my sister also tried it and her hair did not curl at all, so that helped me decide to return the product.</li>
    <li> Heats up right away I mean I literally urged it onset the dial and it was hot curls come out nice u love the heat protectant bag the iron itself looks really sleek and professional no complaints here yet did not get the chance to try out the automatic shut off did need it to be on for 60 minutes shipping time was so fast so impressed  ordered on January 24 2014 and got it on the 28th</li>
    <li> Love my curling iron! I love how if I haven&#x27;t used it in 10 or so minutes, it will turn itself off.  This is especially helpful when I&#x27;m in a hurry to leave and forget about it!</li>
    <li> This hair curler is cheap and easy to use. It heats up fast and it curls so nicely and evenly! Plus! it looks really pretty and comes with a cloth bag to store it! Also at the bottom of the curler, it&#x27;s revolvable, so you dont need to worry about your wire tangling while you curl your hair!</li>
    <li> I would not recommend this product.  My hair didn&#x27;t curl at all and it is usually fairly easy to curl with irons I have used in the past.  The overall design is poor and my hair slipped out too easily thus making it difficult to use.  I would return this product but pretty much destroyed the packaging it came in.</li>
    <li> Its my first curling iron with this width and I love it!!!! But this curling iron and you will love it to!!!</li>
    <li> This is the best curling iron that I have ever had, or used.  It gets hot really quickly, and stays that way.... It does not damage my hair at all.... I am truly glad that I ordered this one!</li>
    <li> I returned it because I changed my mind!</li>
    <li> Curls beautifully, great product for price. Would purchase this brand again.</li>
    <li> Glad I bought it. It works very well. I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> This curling iron may be cheaper but it is awesome!!! It gets up to a high heat and is sleek and easy to use.</li>
    <li> excellent, recommended, heated rapidly, the cable is rotatable</li>
    <li> I love my iron, barrel size is perfect for my new shoulder length hair cut. I love the colors&amp; it heats up supper quick. It comes with little bag I like for traveling so the ceramic coating doesn&#x27;t scratch.</li>
    <li> So Remington is suppose to be some sort of experienced and a US leader in beauty aid and hot curling iron products? Well, they should be ashamed to put out a product as unsafe and ineffective as this one. I could have used an old tin can heated over a stove to produce the same amount of cuts, burns and relaxed curl. Within a couple of months, this iron&#x27;s screws come loose and no longer works at all. Very poor design and unsafe, with protruding screws that grab hair and fall out.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY THIS. It is really cheap and not good quality.</li>
    <li> Heats up fast and curls fast if you don&#x27;t have a lot of time (or patience like me)</li>
    <li> The diameter is too big, doesn&#x27;t work very well for me</li>
    <li> A great value for the price.  Heats up very quickly, doesn&#x27;t pull or break your hair, and has a choice of many heat settings, which is what I was looking for.  My hair is dry and some of the curling irons only have very hot temps that damage my hair.  I set this curling iron on a &amp;#34;10&amp;#34; which is just right for me, but if you need it hotter, it goes up to 30, so it should work for everyone.</li>
    <li> Save your money, add a couple dollars more and buy a better quality curler. This doesn&#x27;t hold a curl AT ALL. at the most 3 hours and i def don&#x27;t have fine hair (or coarse, in the middle medium textured indian hair). I have never had problems with holding a curl this just doesn&#x27;t. The barrel size is great for VS model bombshell curls. I took out the clip and used as a wand. Either way it doesn&#x27;t hold curls longer than a few hours.</li>
    <li> Best curling iron i ever brought!</li>
    <li> Works really well.  Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I received this with the iron and clip part in silver, and not black as pictured. Probably won&#x27;t make much of a difference in practical use, eh? But that isn&#x27;t my issue with this. When I switched it on, it started to emit smoke from the middle (joint between iron and handle) for several seconds, then stopped. It then seemed to continue to function as per normal. Too much of a hassle to return as I do not reside in the United States, but I will be extra cautious when switching this on the next few times.</li>
    <li> Wonderful curling iron. Heats fast, and gives you big voluminous curls.</li>
    <li> I REALLY LOVE MY CURLS! It&#x27;s so easy to use, without burning myself. My curls are relaxed and healthy looking, so I glad I bought this product.</li>
    <li> Makes really beautiful large curls! Easy to handle and heats quickly. Love the ceramic! Can style my hair without destroying it! Good quality product.</li>
