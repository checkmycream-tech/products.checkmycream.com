      <li>cute colors, good packaging and held up well during travel.</li>
      <li>The seller was great and shipped quickly.</li>
      <li>This is more of a sampler pack.  </li>
      <li>i love this set.</li>
      <li>Love all the colors.</li>
      <li>the others were ok.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used most of the colors and they&#x27;re all wearable.  </li>
      <li>I can see these being equally appropriate for a party or work in a conservative office.</li>
      <li>Absolutely love these.</li>
      <li>Nice shades to fit many moods.</li>
      <li>I love these  Opi mini nail polish bottles .</li>
      <li>love the colors</li>
      <li>But anyway I love 8 colors I have</li>
      <li>I love about Amazon</li>
      <li>lovely colors</li>
      <li>I thought I would love these shades</li>
      <li>and I guess it&#x27;s ok</li>
      <li>These are my 2 favorite  brands...</li>
      <li>One awesome thing about these collections is that you can buy this and try it out to decide if you want to upgrade to a bigger bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Instead, I received a top coat and an Envy Nails</li>
      <li>I ended up buying it in the full-size version because I loved it so much!</li>
      <li>However, despite the small size, it provides a great variety for a great price.</li>
      <li>Not much to say about opi, their products are excellent.</li>
      <li>ready good</li>
      <li>and the box arrived very quickly - mega</li>
      <li>strongly recomend..great product</li>
      <li>quick delivery!</li>
      <li>Very pretty colors and love the OPI names-</li>
      <li>but the colors are not that fantastic.</li>
      <li>so if you are gluten free like me, you want to be careful.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Overall a very nicely curated set.</li>
      <li>Love it so much I am a nail art person.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good gauge to see which colors I want to buy in larger bottles.</li>
      <li>Even though I thought they were bigger, I loved the purchase.</li>
      <li>Still a really cool color though.</li>
      <li>It came quickly.</li>
      <li>Very pretty.  </li>
      <li>I guess these would be a good stocking stuffer or if you have a friend who is obsessed with collecting coke stuff this would be perfect, otherwise I would say avoid it as the colors are very similar to those already out.</li>
      <li>- otherwise I&#x27;d get any other gorgeous OPI set.</li>
      <li>Great fun size true to color shown and great typical quality form OPI a little surprised at the size at first but</li>
      <li>Not a big deal, really, but it would have been nice.</li>
      <li>I am overall satisfied with these fun colors.</li>
      <li>I very much recommend this collection of minis.</li>
      <li>anyone from OPI is reading these comments - a smaller brush could go along way to myself and maybe others buying more of these</li>
      <li>and you won&#x27;t even believe how fast it dries!</li>
      <li>;)  </li>
      <li>Some nice colors in the collection and an ok way to test the colors but the bottles are so small I could barely get two coats out of them.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Careful, does not include the orange coca-cola color, which is possibly one of the reasons I got it.</li>
    <li> The &amp;#34;coke red&amp;#34; polish is the real star of this show. I ended up buying it in the full-size version because I loved it so much! Overall a very nicely curated set. The colors are fun, different, flattering, and versatile. I can see these being equally appropriate for a party or work in a conservative office. Perfect for a sister or girlfriend&#x27;s birthday/holiday gift. Money well spent! One star knocked off because the bottles are REALLY tiny.</li>
    <li> Great fun size true to color shown and great typical quality form OPI a little surprised at the size at first but really who uses the WHOLE bottle of polish before it dries out or just gets bad plus you get several colors for one</li>
    <li> quick delivery! love the colors</li>
    <li> Excellent product worth the experience</li>
    <li> Great price on amazon, and great colors.  I used in a gift bag for a baby shower with some nail polish remover pads, also on amazon.</li>
    <li> Got it from my friend for my birthday. Love it so much I am a nail art person. The nail polish is small but long lasting, are not easily chiped in fact hasn&#x27;t once chiped on me. May seem like a little bit of polish at first but doesn&#x27;t take a lot to put on nails..(this coming from a girl with long nails) hope that helps..strongly recomend..great product</li>
    <li> came out smaller like bon bon nail polishes.  lovely colors though</li>
    <li> cute colors, good packaging and held up well during travel. No cracks or damages</li>
    <li> Each bottle is good for two applications.</li>
    <li> What a wonderful collection! One note about Today I Accomplished Zero-this is a sheer black polish with red glitter. I would recommend using a white or even black basecoat. By itself, it never acheives opacity. Still a really cool color though. I very much recommend this collection of minis. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Nice shades to fit many moods.</li>
    <li> Nails here,good shape could not see all color s I picture but I liked some dark,some light color s try several all ready good buy,10,bottles I would get again + for gifts</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted and arrived so quickly I was shocked...</li>
    <li> colors I like : &amp;#34;today I accomplished zero&amp;#34; dark burgundy purple sparkly.  Very pretty.  My signature is &amp;#34;DC&amp;#34;.  NIce silver.  &amp;#34;Green on the Runway&amp;#34; sparkly green.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other colors are ok.  nothing unusual.</li>
    <li> Great color selection.  Would have liked to see a brighter green.</li>
    <li> I adore this collection from OPI. Great colors. Great formulas. My three favorites are Coca-Cola Red, My Signature is &amp;#34;DC&amp;#34; (silver), and Sorry I&#x27;m Fizzy Today (peachy pink).</li>
    <li> Packaging was lacking, but product is wonderful.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love these. I&#x27;ve always liked OPI nail polish. They are smaller than I expected though. It&#x27;s a great sample set and I would recommend it to anyone who&#x27;s looking to try the colors or expand their collection.</li>
    <li> Great colors and the perfect size!</li>
    <li> Wonderful colors and so iconic:)</li>
    <li> Packaging was very crushed, but I didn&#x27;t need it anyways.  Loved all the colors as I used these for my daughter&#x27;s bridal favors.</li>
    <li> I never get tired of changing my nails color. I love it!</li>
    <li> I love these colors!  OPI never disappoints!</li>
    <li> Excellent nail polishes! Love them! Good quality.</li>
    <li> Not much to say about opi, their products are excellent. The seller was great and shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> Love all the colors. The mini sizes are good too.</li>
    <li> So far, I love the colors, and this is the only nail polish I have ever had that lasts.  I have officially switched to OPI nail polish products.</li>
    <li> When I opened the box, I was a little bit disappointed cuz bottles were smaller that I expected (the bottle and a lid together are about 2 inches,the bottle itself is just 7/8 inch) and there were no &amp;#34;Orange You Fantastic&amp;#34; color which is orange glitters polish. So there&#x27;s just 8 colored polishes -&lt;br /&gt;Coca Cola Red, You&#x27;re So Vanilla, Get Cherried Away, My Signature is DC, Today I Accomplished Zero, Green on the Runway, A Grape Affair and Sorry I&#x27;m Busy Today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other two bottles are nail strengthening base and a topcoat. I have these products from the other brand and I didn&#x27;t know they gonna be included into this set - otherwise I&#x27;d get any other gorgeous OPI set. But anyway I love 8 colors I have and I hope to have a great, long-lasting coverage with&#x27;em.</li>
    <li> Polish is great! I love the colors but the bottles are very small.</li>
    <li> someone thought out these colors! They are all great, and you can mix and match most of them. Coca-cola red - my new favorite. The pink is great, but the polish is a little tricky. can&#x27;t wait to wear the rest of them this summer</li>
    <li> The nail polishes are beautiful. Perfect. I rate 4 stars because the pack doesn&#x27;t come with the orange- Fanta one. Instead, I received a top coat and an Envy Nails</li>
    <li> Perfect as favors for my bridal shower</li>
    <li> Not good one of the nail polishes came broken</li>
    <li> Even though I thought they were bigger, I loved the purchase. Really beautiful colors and you won&#x27;t even believe how fast it dries! Impressive.</li>
    <li> When I opened the package to inspect the bottles, one of the bottles had come loose and a bit of the polish had leaked out in the plastic tray it was sitting in. It wasn&#x27;t as messy as it could have been and the polish appears to be okay in spite of the leakage, thank goodness. Item arrived on time. I am overall satisfied with these fun colors.</li>
    <li> Perfect birthday gift. Came exactly how i expected, price was unbeatable for being a opi nailpolish. ONLY downside was the box had a dent, which wasn&#x27;t to pretty to give as a gift. But this could have been the mailman&#x27;s fault :(</li>
    <li> another great set of minis from OPI. i love this set. i would recommend this to any nail polish heads out there! great for a gift also! i just love everything about this product!</li>
    <li> Family loves the product</li>
    <li> I love these  Opi mini nail polish bottles . The colors are so beautiful. The delivery came faster then I expected. I can&#x27;t  wear anything else other than Opi or sally Hansen. These are my 2 favorite  brands...</li>
    <li> Cute colors, but thin so need to use several coats for it not to be sheer.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my grandmother, but she really loves what she received.  I don&#x27;t know much about nail polish, but the product photos made me feel like the bottles would be bigger.  This is more of a sampler pack.  However, despite the small size, it provides a great variety for a great price.</li>
    <li> I thought I would love these shades but when I got them they reminded me a lot of other shades I already had.  I guess these would be a good stocking stuffer or if you have a friend who is obsessed with collecting coke stuff this would be perfect, otherwise I would say avoid it as the colors are very similar to those already out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on the fence about these OPI mini&#x27;s.  The package arrived w/ two of the bottles slightly open, so I had to clean up the bottles.  The collection itself is great!  Very pretty colors and love the OPI names- so inventive!  One awesome thing about these collections is that you can buy this and try it out to decide if you want to upgrade to a bigger bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone from OPI is reading these comments - a smaller brush could go along way to myself and maybe others buying more of these mini&#x27;s/collections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and the box arrived very quickly - mega impressed w/ that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I love about Amazon is that you can leave your personal opinion and and you don&#x27;t have to worry about anyone bashing you for it!</li>
    <li> Some nice colors in the collection and an ok way to test the colors but the bottles are so small I could barely get two coats out of them.</li>
    <li> A few of the colors I&#x27;m not impressed with. The black goes on clear with red glitter which makes your nails look gross. I bought this as a starter to my nail polish collection and I guess it&#x27;s ok but the colors are not that fantastic.</li>
    <li> Received very quickly nice but bottles are so small.  I have not used them yet but I heard that OPI was an excellent polish, I will let u know once I try them.</li>
    <li> The red polish was clumpy the others were ok.</li>
    <li> I was fully aware that the bottles were tiny, but unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t know that meant that they would clump up quickly. Left streaks on my nails from the get-go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the color options, though, and I am happy that it came with a top-coat and a bottle of nail-envy. It&#x27;s a good gauge to see which colors I want to buy in larger bottles.</li>
    <li> I love all the colors! Excellent price for the quality</li>
    <li> Adorable miniature Opi bottles!,!!!!!!  So cute! These are wonderful colors to try out. Some are very &amp;#34; normal&amp;#34; colors while others are fun and outside the usual fare.</li>
    <li> Not impressed with the colors!</li>
    <li> The colors are great.  It came quickly.</li>
    <li> This set is beautiful.  I&#x27;ve used most of the colors and they&#x27;re all wearable.  You can get at least 3 or 4 uses out of each bottle.  I&#x27;ve decided i&#x27;m probably going to buy large bottles of a couple of the colors.  The wear is good and lasts at least a week and half on me.</li>
    <li> Arrived quick and packaging is great! They are the small adorable bottles. ;)  Polish colors are beautiful!</li>
    <li> Really nice colors and the base and top coats are a plus</li>
    <li> Great set of colors. Loved all of them.</li>
    <li> Colors are not posted on the bottles but the were below the nail polish on the box. Some of the polishes I couldn&#x27;t open. I don&#x27;t know if they were old? There was another one were the brush inside the bottle was flipped the wrong way and it couldn&#x27;t be used. Did I get a bad batch??</li>
    <li> Great value. My daughter loved them.</li>
    <li> wonderful shades. I really like this sampler. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that the Nail Envy strengthener, which is included, says it contains formadehyde.  It also contains wheat (yes, I was surprised!) so if you are gluten free like me, you want to be careful.&lt;br /&gt;I was under the impression that all the OPI products were at least 3-Free (no DBP, Toluene or Formaldehyde).&lt;br /&gt;I do wish they put the name of the colors on the actual bottles, too, so I can know which ones to re-order. I&#x27;ll just have to keep that part of the box. Not a big deal, really, but it would have been nice.</li>
