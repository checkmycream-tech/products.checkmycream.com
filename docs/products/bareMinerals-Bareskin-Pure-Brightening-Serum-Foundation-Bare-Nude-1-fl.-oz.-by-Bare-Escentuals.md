      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>I now like using the brush more than using my fingers.  </li>
      <li>Love it , although you do need to buy the applicator brush specifically for this.</li>
      <li>Goes on smooth with the special brush!!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an &#x27;ok&#x27; foundation if you do not have blemished skin and are not looking for full coverage.</li>
      <li>I am a huge fan of the mineral powder foundations.</li>
      <li>BUT OTHER THAN THAT, IT WORKS VERY GOOD.</li>
      <li>Might be great for dry skin.</li>
      <li>Super light coverage.</li>
      <li>Very lightweight with full coverage.</li>
      <li>It is very light (not heavy on the skin) but offers great coverage of blemishes in the skin, dark spots etc.</li>
      <li>recommend going to a store and trying the color first before purchase.</li>
      <li>I love the golden shade, it neutralizes red spots and looks very natural.</li>
      <li>Used it twice but appears very &amp;#34;yellow&amp;#34; on my complexion</li>
      <li>Fast shipping too.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t last all night without a powder touch up, but it was a hot night</li>
      <li>natural looking.</li>
      <li>Good coverage without looking fake.</li>
      <li>Goes on nice and thin.</li>
      <li>The skin tone matching is good, but unfortunately it slides right off any oily areas, so not suitable for oily or combination skin.</li>

    <li> Im a bareMinerals fan, but I wasn&#x27;t crazy about this..it kind of just sat on my skin, i would blend and blend, I bought the brush that goes with it and it just moved around on my face.....I could see it streaking around on my face and just wouldn&#x27;t settle in, weird...</li>
    <li> I have used this product for quite awhile. it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> Goes on nice and thin.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  You need a brush to apply but it goes on evenly.  I now like using the brush more than using my fingers.  Good coverage without looking fake.</li>
    <li> I love it!! Great on the skin!!! Goes on smooth with the special brush!!</li>
    <li> My blemish free secret. Very lightweight with full coverage. Love Love Love this product!</li>
    <li> Love it , although you do need to buy the applicator brush specifically for this.</li>
    <li> Very thin. Super light coverage. The color is too yellow for me and I am a med biege. I am a huge fan of the mineral powder foundations. I think I will be ordering Lorac as a base liquid foundation again.</li>
    <li> I like everithing about this Faundation.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Fast shipping too.</li>

    <li> This is like a CC but it leaves my skin feeling softer and smoother. It didn&#x27;t last all night without a powder touch up, but it was a hot night and so I think any foundation would have needed some help.. I love the golden shade, it neutralizes red spots and looks very natural.</li>
