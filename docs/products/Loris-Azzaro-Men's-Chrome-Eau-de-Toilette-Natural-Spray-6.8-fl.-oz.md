<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Timely delivery and the price just rocks.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance. Now I always get compliments about the perfume I am using.</li>
    <li> The scent of this cologne is fantastic.  My husband really likes it.</li>
    <li> You will not get this at this price in any store.&lt;br /&gt;I always get compliments on how good I smell.</li>
    <li> Outstanding service and product!!!</li>
    <li> Love the smell and it lasts most of the day. The smell is very fresh and I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments. I&#x27;d purchase this again for sure once I run out.</li>
    <li> Great transaction! It shipped quickly and I received it in good shape. It was a present for my son and he loves the way it smells.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY, this seller sold me a old bottle of Azzaro Chrome. It lasts for roughly 15mins before the disappears. I am a cologne collector and I know a thing or two about cologne and this is definitely an old example of Azzaro Chrome.  I am so angry and upset that I am going to make sure that I get my money back by either the seller or my credit card company. Just as it is illegal to sell expired food it should be illegal to sell expired cologne. In my professional opinion it is always best to purchase cologne from department stores. Freshness is key to cologne. When it is fresh it is vibrant and long lasting. A key indicator of when a cologne is old is when it smells like alcohol and it has very poor lasting power. All in all, I regret the purchase. Poor quality product from a seller who deals in old merchandise. They should be removed from amazon.</li>
    <li> Smell is more of alcohol than the normal fragrance.  In Amazon&#x27;s defense I notice a lot of retailers have the same problem too with receiving fake/watered down chrome as to actually purchase the correct chrome I had to go to 3 more retailers before I found a real bottle.</li>
    <li> This is the scent my guy use to wear when I first started dating him. Needless to say when his ran out and went and bought the big bottle.</li>
    <li> SMELLS ABSOLUTELY FANTASICALLY AWESOME. EVERY WOMAN AND I MEANEVERY DAM ONE TAT HAS SMELLED IT HAS COMPLIMENTED IT.. THIS SMELLS AWESOME AND CAME FAST</li>
    <li> Greate scence. I love it</li>
    <li> I noticed that something is wrong with the Chrome perfume I received directly from Amazon. I noticed that its different from what I tried before. I brought it to the local department store &amp;#34;Herberger&#x27;s&amp;#34;. And the perfume consultant guy said that the perfume I received is strongly diluted. And hopefully with just water, because I sprayed it on my skin.</li>
    <li> My favorite cologne for years. smells so fresh and I always get compliments! This is a really good deal. Huge bottle.</li>
    <li> one of the greats. I just wish they were make this from essential oils and natural ingredients. The chemical smell is quite noticeable. Hope you read this chrome guys - offer a high-end version. I&#x27;ll buy believe me .</li>
    <li> this smells great. masculine but not too strong. my bf finished his smaller bottle and was using different colognes-- i had to replace it; this smells so wonderful on him.</li>
    <li> My sister got this Cologne for me for Christmas! When I opened the box I was surprised to how big the bottle was. She got me the 6.8 oz and I think this might last me 2 years! The Cologne smells great,  I would definitely recommend this to any man with a good taste in smell</li>
    <li> Love this cologne thanks for your business.</li>
    <li> The scent doesn&#x27;t last long, so I am not sure if it was a bad bottle.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this stuff and it is the best price I have found for the size. I have looked everywhere because its the only thing he&#x27;ll wear. With no shipping you really cant beat it, even Walmart was more expensive.</li>
    <li> This is my FAVORITE Chrome natural spray! I buy this for my husband every time he runs out. I can say, if you decide to order this for the first time you will be glad you did. HIGHLY RECOMMEND it!</li>
    <li> My son loves this cologne.  His 16 years old.</li>
    <li> Need I say more, Always get complimented on wearing Chrome!</li>
    <li> My personal favorite of all scents.I truly love this scent,got this as a gift a few years back and now its a must have for me.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and found that you can barely tell (if at all) that he&#x27;s wearing a scent.  While I certainly don&#x27;t want him running around smelling like a gigalo, it&#x27;d be nice to smell something.  This scent is toooooo subtle for a man&#x27;s scent.</li>
    <li> My husband loved this cologne.  It smells so good.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> This cologne is my son&#x27;s favorite and has been for some years now.  I usually buy the smaller one for him for Christmas because it is a little pricy and it doesn&#x27;t last a whole year.  When I saw this size for the same amount I would pay for the smaller one, naturally I sized up.  It arrived before the stated delivery date and he was thrilled to say the least.  His comment was &amp;#34;It&#x27;s HUGE!!&amp;#34;  Very pleased with product.</li>
    <li> I have the best smelling man in town!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, huge bottle, same great smell, Thanks much</li>
    <li> I buy this cologne all the time and use it at work or around the family it stays on all day..I bought it from amazon for the first time its amazing the price I paid ..&lt;br /&gt;Chrome is always in my cologne collection ..I love it .I recomeded to a few co-workers that also like it..This colgne is for going out or the work place ..if you like cool waters you will love this colgne. I highly recomend it. Also forgot to say super fast delivery.exactly what I order ..New ..will buy again 5 star seller.</li>
    <li> One of my husband&#x27;s favorite colognes!</li>
    <li> Great cologne. I have been buying this for years online and love it. Keep getting compliments on it as well :)</li>
    <li> fresh , good , lasts for a while. i am ok with it.</li>
    <li> Smells good and worth the price.</li>
    <li> You WILL get compliments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been wearing this cologne daily for over three years now, and I still get compliments regularly. I&#x27;m writing this review after a coworker told me I &amp;#34;leave a trail of goodness behind me&amp;#34; wherever I walk at work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just one spray is enough to last all day, but it&#x27;s subtle and not overwhelming. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I bought the biggest size available and I wasn&#x27;t expecting this thing to be this huge. Every morning it&#x27;s like I&#x27;m grabbing a gallon of chrome to spray it on me. I used this cologne before, this is a great one. It leaves a trail behind and because I&#x27;m hot and gorgeous, I&#x27;m just having to take a bigger effort to ignore chicks (I&#x27;m faithfully married to a jealous cubana)&lt;br /&gt;Oh, I also use this on me after going to the gym or heavily sweating from running if I don&#x27;t wanna shower. Yeah, it&#x27;s pretty disgusting but I bet I end up smelling better than you after you shower.</li>
    <li> Chrome is my favorite cologne, and I find Amazon to have the best price.  I usually buy the smaller 3.4oz bottle, but this time when I saw that the price of the 6.8oz bottle was less than buying two of the smaller bottles would be, I figured I&#x27;d take advantage and save a few bucks in the long run.  Overall saved quite a bit off dept store price.  Item arrived a little sooner than expected, which is always nice.</li>
    <li> Everyone seems to like the smell of this stuff, also seems to last the entire day.  Price at amazon in by far the lowest I have been able to find.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I am a fan of Chrome. It is my favorite eau de toilette. Getting the 6.8 ounces for that price is an excellent deal. I travel a lot and haven&#x27;t found it anywhere in the WORLD for this price. If you like Chrome (even if you haven&#x27;t tried it yet) this is a GREAT buy!!</li>
    <li> The price and size are amazing! I am very happy, I had some misgivings but definitely be back for more.</li>
    <li> This item is awesome saw it at Macy&#x27;s but didn&#x27;t want to spend the money there so I looked at amason awesome price and product fast shipping</li>
    <li> I like this scent.  Very good deal.  I would buy this again.  Smells good and is very inexpensive.  hgghf lkhkjuh.</li>
    <li> Really good! My wife approves so that&#x27;s what matters to me.</li>
    <li> Awesome smell specially after taking a shower and head to bed and in the mornings when going to work... Smell AWESOME never get old...</li>
    <li> This is so expensive in store, but such a great price on here! It&#x27;s the best cologne I have ever smelled.</li>
    <li> A great smelling cologne.  Very clean smelling, not fruity at all.  I usually wear it during formal events, like nights on the town, dates, banquets, etc.  Can&#x27;t go wrong here!</li>
    <li> Great price for such a big bottle.</li>
    <li> This a cheap and not legit cologne it sticks not worth the money just go to Macy if u gonna spend 50 on this s***..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved this cologne! Over the last 4 years I&#x27;ve bought this cologne for my boyfriend and it&#x27;s still his favorite one. It&#x27;s super long lasting and it&#x27;s not a overbearing scent. He put two squirts of his cologne on in the morning, then worked on his truck and played football all day... And that night you could still smell it on him. I&#x27;ll always purchase this cologne.</li>
    <li> I started using Chrome about 10 years ago as a gift from my now ex-wife. A recent ex-GF got me the travel/sample tubes of this since you can&#x27;t get this bottle through airport security. So clearly this is important to women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get lots of comments like &amp;#34;Now that&#x27;s how a man should smell!&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;What brand of cologne is that; I need to get some for my husband?&amp;#34; and even the more creepy &amp;#34;You smell really good!&amp;#34;. No coworker has ever had a bad reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see a lot of asthma/COPD and frail elderly patients in my practice. I spray this on heavily in the morning because its fragrance is a little on the &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; side. I have never once had a patient react or even mention the cologne. Often they tell me that visits with other practitioners and nurses have been almost intolerable due to their reaction to the perfume and cologne. Really, in healthcare, we&#x27;re not even supposed to be using products like this but I have now tested it over many years now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I almost don&#x27;t want to recommend this. Not many guys use it and I&#x27;d like to keep it that way as long as the company doesn&#x27;t go out of business!</li>
    <li> this cologne is something unbelievable. Always was my favorite and now when i bought this huge bottle for such a price i like it even more.... Macy&#x27;s sales it for $100 6.8 oz. So absolutely good buy. I recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> my bf liked it and so do it!!! it smells great!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Fantastic cologne.  Crisp refreshing scent-- some orange citrus, sandalwood, rosewood, and lichon.  Subtle, yet seductive.  Women love it so far, so no complaints there!  Perfect late spring/summer aroma.  This stuff lasts for hours and has earned a permanent spot in my collection.  Don&#x27;t tell you friends about it, let them wear Acqua di Gio or some other played out fragrance!  The seller is top notch as well.. arrived right on time, packaged well, and included some samples and coupons for the next purchase.</li>
    <li> My son absolutely loves this fragrance, and it can be a little pricey purchased at the local retailers.  I was able to get this for him in a size three times larger than usual for just a few dollars more.  I will always purchase my fragrances at Amazon.com.  Cannot beat the value.  Everytime he puts the Chrome on, he laughs and tells me he has never seen a bottle this big.  The delivery was prompt and in perfect condition.  In fact, every time I do business with Amazon.com, I am pleasantly surprised.  Top-notch company!</li>
    <li> Spray it in your hair, spray it on your junk, brush your teeth with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually, don&#x27;t buy this cologne. Only one man should smell this good: me.</li>
    <li> The fragrance doesn&#x27;t last as long as I thought it would. The one bought in actual stores are more costly but I feel worth it</li>
    <li> Does not smeel like the orginal but has a strong scent to it if you put on about 10 spryezz.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, by far my favorite fragrance. Product exactly as advertised, I recommend it to anyone that likes to smell awesome.</li>
    <li> Just clean nothing special. If i want clean would take Nautica Voyage any day. Smells way better,cheaper and lasts longer.</li>
    <li> This was a good buy.  Smells great.  Has a scent that can be both for younger as well as older men (I&#x27;m more to the latter LOL!).  Has hints of spice.</li>
    <li> smells great and attaches to my clothes. my officemates instantly recognized the smell and rhetorically asked me if I was on this perfume. really attractive stuff!</li>
    <li> when i orderd this product i was excited to recieve this cologne. When I opened it, is was not what i expected. It smelled totally fake it wasnt real. Eventough everything seemed to be in order you just got to be careful. Never going to purchase something from this seller again. Next time i should be more careful look up a bit of information about the seller before deciding to purchase because of the price. i rather purchase stuff from a buissness with a contact number and website just to be more careful. Very unhappy i lost twenty dollars from this purchase learned a lesson.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing, worth ever penny!!! And my fianc&amp;eacute; loves it!!!</li>
    <li> This was my first cologne purchase on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had already sampled the cologne from a sample vile from Macy&#x27;s and had received many compliments at work on the day that I used it. I also noticed that it lasted all day. The smell is somewhat of a mixture of different citrus elements. Definitely a day cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I thought, cologne for work, not bad for the price. I was happily surprised on how big the bottle was and I&#x27;m sure that it will last a long time, even if I use it 5 days a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, for the money, this was a great bargain.</li>
    <li> Great for price and so big would buy right away if I were you and very good smell buy buy</li>
    <li> Because the product is everything I expected for that price, I am loving the compliments I have been receiving. Thanks</li>
    <li> this is something i give over and over again this is my husbands favorite fragrance and he really appreciates the gift</li>
    <li> Product was great price but shipping took way too long</li>
    <li> Good Fragrance. Would recommend to friends and family. Another fragrance I would recommend is DKNY for men. Stays on longer</li>
    <li> very nice!! i don&#x27;t like fragrances too much but this one changed my mind. smooth but yet long lasting scent...i&#x27;m glad i bought this!!</li>
    <li> Saw this in a magazine ad originally and went straight out and got it.  I also own Lacoste red and just recently Izod for my lighter scents.  I always get compliments on this cologne it&#x27;s a light and crisp scent that can be used during every season.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Chrome Azzaro on and off for over 13 years.  I didn&#x27;t even realize it was that long until I thought to write this review.  I began using this scent when I was 18 years old.  I&#x27;ve experimented and or included other fragrances into my collection over the years; however, I always return to this one as my favorite.  This scent has become a part of me.  The neuro-olfactory connection I have associated with this scent brings back the most vivid, emotional memories I hold over the past decade plus.  Through my school years, military years, relationships and now parenthood this scent has been with me; continues to receive great compliments and offers me the nostalgia of not only yesterday nor yesteryear but of times long forgotten...</li>
    <li> My husband loved it! Im happy with that :)</li>
    <li> The best men&#x27;s fragrance and i am on the 3rd purchase. I like the chrome for its subtle, but long lasting fragrance. Its crisp tangy flavor almost certain to get  you attention, not the sensual kind, but more of some complementing you. I have had many people complement me on the fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other thing i noticed, with any fragrance, when used for prolonged period, almost certainly, your smelling senses get used to it and then you will have to increase the amount to smell it, but then your friends may notice, like you bath in it. Chrome blends with you but does not leave you like that... first time to the last time its still fresh...i am moving to my 3rd purchase.  Unlike other on the market strong... sensual... or attractive... I think Chrome will give a professional, yet sporty feel and will defiantly not embrace you in public with its strong smell. Its hard to find a fragrance that can last long, but not too strong.</li>
    <li> This bottle is HUGE!!</li>
    <li> Love this. Classic great cologne. My husband has been wearing this cologne fore the past 10 years. It&#x27;s clean and sexy.</li>
    <li> Huge bottle great buy, makes my country boy smell irresistible.</li>
    <li> I never thought I would buy something with bad quality on AMAZON.&lt;br /&gt;This cologne smells good , but lasts a few minutes only ...Scent does not stays...&lt;br /&gt;I really think this is fake or diluted in water...&lt;br /&gt;I am disappointed with the purchase</li>
    <li> ... and so do I. For some reason I love nuzzling his neck with this scent on him! I have loved it for over ten years:)</li>
    <li> Smell is different from when I used it few years ago.  Feels like it&#x27;s either a different formula or old one.  It just is not pleasant smell anymore.  Feel just too strong yet unpleasant.</li>
    <li> Good size for someone that uses only Chrome Azzaro! It will last a little bit longer.  One of my favorite fragrances for men, I will recommend without doubt.</li>
    <li> Smells great  my dad loves it.</li>
    <li> I love this scent and the size is the best deal you can find!  Very satisfied.:)</li>
    <li> A SEXY SENSUAL CLEAN MASCULINE SCENT! I LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> Awesome price... Great product! FAST shipping!</li>
    <li> One of my favorite colognes.</li>
    <li> What a great purchase, I ordered it last week and it just arrived today, approximately 3-4 business days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came as if it were just bought from the store, in all of its original packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is nice, the size of the bottle is large so you wouldn&#x27;t take this size around with you, but the good thing is that it will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has to be one of the best colognes.</li>
    <li> I love this cologne and I bought this size for it&#x27;s extreme value.  However, I made a very big mistake.  This is considered an oversize bottle for air travel. It was packed in my carryon and now the TSA have it.  I did get one last spray before confiscation so that the TSA would know what a great fragrance they were getting. :(</li>
    <li> He loves it.... I only wish he would not spray it when I walk by when he is getting ready to go somewhere.  &#x3D;)  Actually, I like the scent, but a spray at close range will get you to sneezing.  It is not a bad scent on the dogs that wander too close and get some residual on their coats, but I doubt it helps their dating game any.  LOL</li>
    <li> its the real thing.  i was really impressed. Great deal well worth the money I spend on it. Loved it.</li>
    <li> I liked it for the size, quality and its price. It was a birthday present and my husband loved it.</li>
    <li> I did not realize I ordered such a big bottle but when I opened it only thing I thought was I got more for my money than I thought.</li>
    <li> I first got a free vial from stores. The smell was excellent and fresh, it stayed for the whole day. I bought this perfume(100 ml) on my next visit to the stores, the quality of the perfume was bad, it had some irritating smell. So people who are about to buy this perfume make sure its fresh stock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the smell is concerned its soft and lasts longer, i am comfortable with daily usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a best buy!</li>
    <li> I have been a long time user of this product and decided to purchase this online via Amazon (Prime). The price deal caught my eye and the positive reviews sounded convincing. After I received the product in the mail and using it for the past week, I felt like the smell of the cologne was not official. Something was off from when I took the first spray. It also did not last as long as what I usually get at the mall. The fragrance stayed on for about an hour and then it was no longer noticeable. The one&#x27;s I would get at the mall would last all day and the smell would be stronger. The product I got from Amazon felt like it was &amp;#34;outdated&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;defective,&amp;#34; so to speak.. I guess I get what I paid for. If you are looking for quality and long lasting results, I recommend buying this product at the mall. Like what I read on another review here, the product may be too costly at the stores but I feel like it&#x27;s way worth it. If you don&#x27;t care about how long it stays on and are looking for a cologne that can last a short period of time, I recommend buying through Amazon. I think it&#x27;s good for people who may be low on funds or running on a tight budget. Always consider before buying.</li>
    <li> I just left a review for the smaller bottle that I bought to keep in my truck and I thought I was leaving the review for this big bottle...oh well, all the same. I bought the small bottle when I bought this large bottle for my brother for Christmas. This is a huge bottle!! It smells great and girls really like the smell. One spray is all it takes...pretty strong (just right) and lasts a long time. The only thing that I do not like is that both bottles are a bit tipsy. This is due tot the design of the bottle. it is tapered at the bottom. Quite skinny really.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t find this product at this price anywhere locally. The price was fantastic and the shipping was fast. I am very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> This is one of only two colognes that I now ever use.  A little bit goes a long way, and it lasts ALL day!</li>
    <li> Purchased for my husband and he loves it! So do I. Nice soft but noticeable scent. One of faves for him!</li>
    <li> Very refreshing, smell pretty good!</li>
    <li> Got this as a gift. It was very strong the first time I used it and I was debating returning it. But I gave it a second chance and it was much better. If you like the cologne it&#x27;s much cheaper here on Amazon and a great buy.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t help but think its fake unfortunately.  Packaging looks good, smells good to spray, but Ive never had a cologne that fades like this.  I tested it this morning, sprayed a dress shirt with 6 sprays, yes SIX sprays and left it laying on my bed, its been less than 3 hours and there isn&#x27;t even a trace of the scent on the shirt anywhere.  Very disappointing.  I love chrome but it feels like I just had 50 bucks stolen from me buying it here</li>
    <li> My go to fragrance... fresh clean and long lasting scent...</li>
    <li> Women always ask me what cologne I am wearing. Women really love the smell of this stuff. I always get complements.</li>
    <li> Great on shipping time and the package is perfect. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Husband loves this stuff</li>
    <li> Great price  Was not expecting such a large bottle.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about  2 years now.  It is a great product at an amazing price.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my boyfriend of 22. He loves it and I love it. It smells fresh and young. Love it. Also the bottle is HUGE wayyyyyy bigger than I thought it was going to be. Larger than my hand.</li>
    <li> Large size, like the scent no issues. Will purchase more when this runs out. Only complaint container a little hard to handle because of size, a little more ergonomics shoudl go into the design.</li>
    <li> Product came in a timely manner and for the size was very affordabale. Gets lots of compliments and got more clients coming your way</li>
    <li> I have used Chrome for the past couple years. My girlfriend loves how it smells. Amazon offers a good deal on this size bottle was cheaper than any other department store. I am pleased with my purchase and would recommend it to anyone that likes Chrome.</li>
    <li> I was given this as a gift many years ago.  I have never received a compliment on a cologne before and continue to receive them regularly.  Buying this deal is an outstanding bargain and it lasts forever.</li>
    <li> love it thank you so very much</li>
    <li> A perfect scent for every day use. Wear it in the office, where ever. It is a good, clean aroma; not overpowering.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boy friend , one day I had a squirt before I left for work. I swear I had at least 10 compliments on what I was wearing . A few asked me to write down the name. Great price amazon</li>
    <li> I have used chrome for years and this is the biggest bottle I&#x27;ve ever seen.  Great value compared to the 3.4 oz size.</li>
    <li> Makes me smell nice....</li>
    <li> ı love it but not smell so long.ı mean when the bottle bigger ınsıde it no more esans.ı use it befor small bottle ıt was really awfull but this one is smeelin short time.Anyway next time I wıll buy chrome sport.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fake! And evaporates within a few minutes .You are destroying the name  111 2222 333 4444 555 6666נ 777</li>
    <li> Great cologne for men&lt;br /&gt;Great smell. Get a lot of compliments</li>
    <li> Love Crome and floor the size and the price why not, other places sell it for double of what I pay for this size</li>
    <li> i bought this for my husband, and i am very happy, excellent smell unbelievable price for this size of toilete water. amazing deal</li>
    <li> My boyfriend received it as a Christimas gift. The size is large enough to last him a year or more. Thanks!</li>
    <li> This is the scent my guy use to wear when I first started dating him. Needless to say when his ran out and went and bought the big bottle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn this for years and it&#x27;s the only cologne I&#x27;ll buy. This always gets my compliments.  This is the largest bottle I&#x27;ve came across.</li>
    <li> I love this smell and the bottle is heavy duty since my son knocked it off the counter and it didnt break. :)</li>
    <li> There isn&#x27;t too much to say other than it smells great and is way cheaper than in local department stores.</li>
    <li> You may be curious because this product is extremely cheap and also you see a couple of bad reviews. Let me tell you from my experience. This product is amazing! At my mall, 6.4 fl oz of Chrome cost $85! I used to always buy it from here but when school came around and money was tight, I resorted to Amazon hoping I wouldn&#x27;t get a fake product. It came in extremely fast and right when I got it I tested it. I had did three sprays, one on the chest and one near the stomach and one inside my shirt. The cologne still smells amazing after an 8 hour shift so it is not weak nor is it diluted with water. It is (as you can tell by the image, held up by a full size laptop mouse.) this product does come in the right size.  So please don&#x27;t listen to other people and save some big bucks. This product smells good and it&#x27;s very cheap online. It is the real deal. I hope you guys take my advice and enjoy smelling good while you save big bucks.</li>
    <li> Love it, glad i purchased the larger bottle. It&#x27;ll be a while till i need a new bottle but i know where to go next time.</li>
    <li> Great smell, and as the title suggests, the ladies love it.  I get compliments all the time.  Try it out, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> This was a fathers day gift I purchased for my father in law, who only loves the classics (Hugo Boss, Chrome, Eternity, CH 212, etc.) just like I do.  Needless to say, he loved it.  This is original, not a fake, and brought a smile to a very important person in my life.  Keep the classics coming guys, thank you for having this available.</li>
    <li> Great product and price</li>
    <li> Great price for such a huge bottle and it smells great on my Fiance&#x27; and I even wore it once since I love it so much...would definitely buy again</li>
    <li> I GOT THIS FOR MY HUSBAND FOR HIS BIRTHDAY. HE LOVES IT. SHIPMENT WAS FAST AND RECEIVED IN PERFECT CONDITION. WOULD RECOMMEND TO ANYONE.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. Better than Macys.</li>
    <li> Chrome is the only thing my son will wear and he has practically all the exotics. It smells better on him than any of the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sue Taylor</li>
    <li> Great gift for our son-in-law.  Priced this locally at Macy&#x27;s and much smaller bottle about the same money.  Never bought on-line before, was very handy and arrived quickly even during the holiday season.  Would have loved free shipping but great value.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the real deal! I had purchased a bottle from Macy&#x27;s for a sold $80, and instantly returned it when I saw this. The Macy&#x27;s representative laughed when I showed her the price and said it was a fake..boy was she wrong!</li>
    <li> I got a bigger bottle (and its huge) to replace a smaller one I had gotten as a gift. My gf at the time literally drools from smelling this stuff.</li>
    <li> Hey guys it&#x27;s a great deal but I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s a fake. The smell seems to disappear really soon after putting it on. But it still smells like the original.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used chrome for over 10 years and this product has been diluted 100%.  The reason it is half price is because it&#x27;s water in a chrome bottle. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s not bad. I guess I just expected more.&lt;br /&gt;you have to spray a lot, so it last a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;a few compliments... nothing earth shattering.</li>
    <li> Love it... Often people tell me it smells good. Happy.</li>
    <li> Originally found this Spray in a store while vacationing in Gatlingburg area.  Was happy to find that it was available from Amazon, which has been my home shopping store for several years.</li>
    <li> Quick shipping. Just as described.</li>
    <li> Bought this Chrome cologne as a birthday gift for my son-in-law. He was over the moon to receive it. Turns out I had purchased a large volume and he thought I had paid way more then I did.  This happens to be his favorite scent, so everyone was happy including me as I bought something that he loved and it was a bargain as well.  Good price for the amount.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my hubby these are very hard to find now days. I was very surprised on the bottle did not expect it to be so big! Overall was sent very quick and highly satisfied with the bottle !! :)</li>
    <li> Buy my husband every Christmas.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing! My gf loves it</li>
    <li> i always get this for my husband. it smells so good! and all you need is alittle. it lasts all day. this is my favorite cologne on my husband. this would be a great gift for a guy of any age.</li>
    <li> I got it it&#x27;s great very fast shipping thank you</li>
    <li> We had first purchased this from Perfumania, got home and found it on here.  Got a bottle 3 times the size for less than half of what we paid there.  Smells great, stays with him, which is important to us.  Recommend this!</li>
    <li> Great price.  Good smell.</li>
    <li> It was a gift. He loves it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, EXCELLENT price, excellent shipping! Happy!</li>
    <li> Been wearing it for 15 years now. With the exception of one woman, all women I dated loved it.</li>
    <li> Great product it was delivered on time and will request it again as soon as I&#x27;m running out of it!</li>
    <li> My husband loves the smell. Lasts him a couple of hours.</li>
    <li> Long lasting and great smell.  A very large bottle and would last a long time.  I think it is an excellent purchase.</li>
    <li> It is VERY GOOD&lt;br /&gt;  IS ARTICLE IS VERY GOOD VENDDO NOT HAVE ANY PROBLEM PLEASE ALL MY NEEDS AND I&#x27;M SURE THERE WILL BE NO PROBLEM TO HANDLE I AM SATISFIED WITH THIS PURCHASE THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING</li>
    <li> My best choice always , last really long time and the price as compare with the size is perfect .</li>
    <li> This is the best cologne I have ever owned.&lt;br /&gt;I get compliments on it all the time!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a nice fresh but not overpowering smell!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been wearing Chrome only, for about 8 years now.</li>
    <li> I bought this through Amazon - Prime.  This product is NOT the real deal.  I have been duped.  As a buyer of this product for nearly 10 years, I know the genuine article and this is not it.  Caution is warrented if you can&#x27;t smell/try it first hand.</li>
    <li> Exceed my expectations !! and i didn&#x27;t have to go out and be on heavy traffic during the holiday. Love it</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think that who&#x27;ll read these reviews are interested what smell the product has,because this is totally personal and individual. For this, it&#x27;ll be better goes to any perfum shop to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t know if this item is 100% authentic, because my old one had a little paper inside (in several languages), saying about the Chrome. This one that I get, don&#x27;t came with the same printed paper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, the smell is characteristic of Chrome,during all day long.</li>
    <li> Great price, fastest shipping!</li>
    <li> This was cut with a lot of Alcohol to stretch it.  You can smell as much Alcohol as the actual cologne.</li>
    <li> I love Azzaro Chrome, my wife like the way it smell on me,and people always said, is that you that smell so good?</li>
    <li> AMAZING PRICE ON THIS BOTTLE SIZE OF CHROME. ... LOVE IT. .....</li>
    <li> Best men&#x27;s smell in existence.... I can smell a man wearing this a mile away. Probably not a good idea to get it for your significant other unless you are very secure in your relationship! Hahah</li>
    <li> Still the same great smell but somewhat muted. Not as strong as it use to be.</li>
    <li> Delivery was quick and the product was as expected.</li>
    <li> Ive been using this fragrance for years, so I know that this one is definitively fake. If the price is too good to be true, it probably is. The scent goes away after about 15 minutes and doesn&#x27;t linger. It smells weak and diluted. Not the real thing.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my fiance as one of his birthday gifts and he loved it! I will continue to order this product in the future.</li>
    <li> very good and fast service</li>
    <li> This is an amazing price for how much you get, I paid 60+ dollars at the mall for 1/3 the size... Needless to say this is the better deal by far</li>
    <li> This by far has to be one of the best colognes ive ever tried, tops Ferrari and Versace easily. If your in high school unbetter buy and use this u wont regret the compliments and stares the ladies will give u like literally those stares! I dont regret buying this such a big as* bottle!!</li>
    <li> Excellent price!! This fragrance has a cool, crisp, pleasant scent.  My fiance loves it!!</li>
    <li> I always buy this cologne for my husband!!!  He loves it, is a nice clean cool smell that not only I love everyone around him loves the way he smells</li>
    <li> CHROME WILL ALWAYS BE THAT SCENT THAT IS GREAT FOR ANY TIME OF DAY OR ANY SEASON. CLEAN, FRESH, &amp; SIMPLY PERFECT! THIS IS A LARGE SIZE BOTTLE @ AN AWESOME PRICE. AAA+++</li>
    <li> My husband was very happy</li>
    <li> This product is not the real thing. I have been using Chrome for years. It smells like Chrome, but when you put a couple of sprays on, the scent goes away almost immediately. I was excited about the size of the bottle for the price so I bought 3. I have tried putting several sprays on to see if that would help; up to 7, and the scent still dissipates within about 10 minutes. I will not buy this product from Amazon again and  am going to be more careful when using Amazon in the future.</li>
    <li> always the best deals on amazon.. chrome is a great product..</li>
    <li> After taking the Meridian out for a midday scotch tasting with the lads, I was impressed the scent held fast. Spencer Van Bidet, who is a bit of a goose but by Christ has a nose for the stuff, actually thought it was a Serge Lutens - of course I let him think so! Normally I wouldn’t have bothered with a cologne topside, letting salty air and the redolence of a 40-year single malt speak for itself, but as it would happen directly after I was to attend Victoria Winterbloom’s end of summer unnecessi-soiree and couldn’t be caught dead covered in new yacht smell. Luckily I tucked this little ace into the ticket pocket of my Larusmiani and freshened up before my driver landed. So I waltz in the place with Henry Muselet and Edwin Pratfall at my wings just in time to see that ponce Chester Duvet making a play for our hostess. I strolled by and one whiff the crisp clean scent was just enough to make even an air-tight piece like Vicky weak in the knees. Let’s just say my night ended very well. Chow!</li>
    <li> Very happy with the product</li>
    <li> GOOD  SMELL BUT WITH A BAD FIXER</li>
    <li> This is another favorite and decided to buy the large one. However, this has been altered since the scent does not last. From the moment I spray to the moment I get to my location...1/2 to 1hr, the scent dissipates and is no longer vivid as once you applied. This was noticed by friends as well.</li>
    <li> Wonderful fragrance ... Mild fragrance with excellent fixation. My wife loved it ... Perfect! Ps.: Speak what else, everything there was to talk about it has been said. Buy, you will not regret.</li>
    <li> used this spray for years.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Chrome for years is great fragrance,the package was well protected and seal.I got a 10% off cupon for my next purchase from the store I bought the perfume.</li>
    <li> Thanks for the quick shipping, product seems to be official to me. Good price too :)</li>
    <li> I had been use to wearing Polo (Regular scent) and Chanel Bleu. My wife fond this and wanted me to try it. She LOVES it on  me. So I now have another cologne that I really really like. Great Price fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Not the real thing, watered down just like everyone is saying.  Doesn&#x27;t even smell like the real thing I had before</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and very familiar with it&#x27;s long lasting fragrance and scent.  When I first used this product I purchased online though Amazon, I noticed within a half hour, I could no longer smell the scent of the cologne?  I continued to use on and off for a couple of weeks and again within a half hour I couldn&#x27;t even detect the fragrance and friends and family confirmed NO scent at all.  I&#x27;m completely dissapointed with my purchase and would NOT order Chrome from Azzaro through Amazon again!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say in Amazon&#x27;s defense, they did refund my total purchase for this item  ;-)</li>
    <li> One of the BEST purchases I&#x27;ve ever made!  Chrome by Azzaro is the only cologne my brother will wear.  He goes through bottles like they&#x27;re going out of style.  This bottle is 6.8oz for such an amazing price.  I will continually recommend and order this product until I can&#x27;t anymore.&lt;br /&gt;I did so much pricing around for this item and the deal this seller offers blows all the others out of the water.  It has lasted so long and there is still about 1/3 of the bottle left!</li>
    <li> I purchased this spray trying it once in Macy store and read the review on this site as well. I liked the fragrance. The bottle I received did well for first few days and after that it was loosing its fragrance. It does not last more than hour or two.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of Chrome Azzaro for men.. It is the only kind of men&#x27;s Cologne that isn&#x27;t heavy or gives me a head ache when he wears it lol...&lt;br /&gt;I love it and He loves that I love it on him! Rwarrrrr lol</li>
    <li> For five years we&#x27;ve been using Chrome Azzaro &amp;&amp; the scent only last a few mintutes. The real one is oily and lasts forever this one is extremely watered down!</li>
    <li> My husband loves this cologne and it is a much better price than in the store or other websites.  The Cologne has a manly smell but not overly strong and it is a good sized bottle too.  I recommend for a new cologne or for a gift.</li>
    <li> This is a very manly smelling fragrance, I purchased this for my son many years ago as a gift because he asked for cologne for Christmas and my coworker wore it and I found myself transfixed by his aroma! One of our other workers jokingly said that she was so attracted to the smell of this fragrance that she suspected there were pheromones in it! Smells so good, it could be possible…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My son loves it and said the ladies do too so if you are looking to attract some ladies…look no further!</li>
    <li> Got this for a buddy at work after he couldn&#x27;t find it at such a great price. Love to help out friends save money and get what they want!</li>
    <li> This product was purchased as a gift for my son. He love this suff!! The price online was 50% less than at a major Dept Store. I ordered on Cyber Monday &amp; the product arrived on time for Christmas.</li>
    <li> Chrome is a scent that i started using 8 years ago when a girlfriend bought it for me, before that i had really only used Axe body spray and other cheapish colognes and not surprisingly, you get what you pay for when you go for something a bit more expensive like this Chrome by Azzaro. Before i used Chrome i got a compliment on my scent maybe once every few months, nothing special.... but once I started using this stuff i would literally get multiple comments every week from girls AND guys looking to know what that amazing smell was! Since i got my first bottle ive bought 1 large bottle with a free small bottle, a medium bottle of Chrome Sport and that lasted me until fall of 2013!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I just recently got another big bottle as a gift and im probably set for another few years! This stuff is high quality and not much goes very far and even if you do over do it the smell is so fresh and friendly that it settles soon and doesnt bite you on the nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Im not a pro when it comes to scents so i wont start talking about high notes and low notes... Suffice it to say if you want to smell like a million bucks without spending a fortune then do yourself a favor and ATLEAST try a small 15$ bottle, I promise you wont regret it!</li>
    <li> THIS ITEM WAS ENORMOUS, AND IT WAS A GREAT SMELLING COLOGNE. I SILL HAVE IT  AFTER A YEAR AND I USE IT ALL THE TIME.</li>
    <li> i really love this scent and everyone else does too I&#x27;m constantly receiving complements so it&#x27;s worth the money</li>
    <li> nice scent to it but it drops off quick</li>
    <li> Smells great, no doubt about that. Great price. But after using it twice, the spray nozzle stopped working, and the full bottle now sprays nothing. Sad.</li>
    <li> great product delivered on time.</li>
    <li> love this scent on my husband. it reminds me of when we first met.. 11 years ago</li>
    <li> THIS SMELLS SO GOOD! My favorite.</li>
    <li> Love this cologne!  One of my all time favorites and this was a great price, fast shipping and well packed.</li>
    <li> My favorite scent on my husband. Can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> super fast shipping!! this was my second order and will order again!!</li>
    <li> Favorite cologne at a reasonable price &amp; time.</li>
    <li> The price was amazing, I&#x27;m very happy with this cologne. I wish I could say this was my unique scent but that&#x27;s just not the case.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing Chrome for over 10 years now and during that time, I experimented with different colognes but without a doubt, the most flattering compliments I received was from wearing Chrome.  I don&#x27;t wear it every time but it&#x27;s definitely a go to cologne.  I always thought of it as a summertime fragrance but living in cold Toronto, it works all year round.  Smelling good works all year round no matter where you are.</li>
    <li> This is my all time favorite cologne to buy for my boyfriend, which he gets every Christmas. I decided to look online this last year for a better deal and I found it!! The amount of cologne you get for this price is amazing and it will definitely last him all year long if not a little longer which makes it that much worth paying for. I recommend this to anyone who loves a good deal!!</li>
    <li> I am a fan of this fragrance and was unaware that one could buy them online b/c they are practically alcohol and was not expecting any seller to ship them. I was a good surprise. I ordered the large bottle and it has lasted a long time and I use it almos every day. For one of my favorite fragrances it was a good price and great shipping.</li>
    <li> Cologne is watered down!!! I have had this same cologne before and this is not the same. I knew price was too good to be true. total fraud....DONT BUY!!!</li>
    <li> Great smell and huge bottle will last a long time!!!&lt;br /&gt;great purchace for your man he will like it im sure!!</li>
    <li> Cologne seems like it is watered down. I have had this same cologne before and this is not the same. I knew price was too good to be true.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for me. I like it and I like the smell. It arrives immediately after I ordered it.</li>
    <li> great cologne! great smelling! i use it every time i go out and always get complements !</li>
    <li> Favorite cologne for a family member!</li>
    <li> I love it!!! My husband smells sooooo go!!</li>
    <li> Love it, not too strong and perfect smell.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell as it should! It has a faint smell, leads me to believe its a knockoff or just a very old bottle! And colognes aren&#x27;t eligible for returns. I bought this for my hubby and we both smell the difference. Not happy with this purchase at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: it&#x27;s been a few days since I submitted the above review. Husband and I started noticing that the cologne is now starting to smell as it should... We think maybe the packaging had something to do with the off-smell? I don&#x27;t know but it&#x27;s very peculiar and I would advice to purchase cologne at a retailer in person vs online.</li>
    <li> Hubby smells yummy!!!!</li>
    <li> It seems a bit watered down to me. The fragrance lasts about half the day.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome chrome!!!!</li>
    <li> I like this very much..probably less than some of the other fans of this cologne, but definitely better than the average market quality cologne. Has a nice baseline fragrance and keeps well through most of the day.good buy</li>
    <li> I love the original, store-bought version of Chrome...but this bottle unfortunately is not that. It may not be a knockoff-- it might be watered-down; but, in any case, the smell is not really the same. And, it really doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
    <li> This cologne has been my trademark for years, and I always buy it over and over again.  A 200mL at a really good price is a no brainer.  Shipping was on time and everything was brand new!</li>
    <li> I had this one before from sears store and the smell stays for way longer period of time</li>
    <li> It is the perfum that I order, but it had 25%less ,It was liken for the end of the spray</li>
    <li> Very sastified!! It&#x27;s a Good size and well worth the price. Very happy with this purchased</li>
    <li> This is the best price that I have ever found for this product for. It is a huge bottle for the same  price as a 1.7oz bottle. I will be ordering a couple more bottles just because of the value.</li>
    <li> They sell this for more than twice at the mall. Lovely fragrance. Just got it, and it is the real thing.</li>
    <li> Great cologne but the cap fell off after a few days which made it worthless but Amazon stepped up and refunded my money...Great experience</li>
    <li> Smells great. Huge bottle! Lasts at least a year for me. I have gone through at least 3 bottles of Chrome. I love it and girls seem to love it too! If you haven&#x27;t tried it, I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Just received my order for chrome cologne. I am a long time user of this scent. So when I fou d this deal I was really excited to see such a great deal. Well it is too good too he true. It is either really old or knock off quality. It has absolutely no smell. Total rip off. And Amazon won&#x27;t take it back because it goes against their hazardous materials rule. So dissapointed. Buy so much from Amazon and I am usually super happy with my purchases. But finally got burned and absolutely no support from amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy!!!!!!</li>
    <li> The Chrome Azzaro arrived in great shape and my husband is enjoying the cologne.  It is a large bottle but he will use for it each day.  Was shipped quickly and arrived for one of his birthday gift.</li>
    <li> Excellent smell but not long lasting. Product I received does not last more than an hour or two. Good gift for a grad.</li>
    <li> not as good as the white/ lighter one.&lt;br /&gt;I made a mistake.&lt;br /&gt;Shipment was horrible too.&lt;br /&gt;Im going to use this for ordinary work.</li>
    <li> This stuff is Awesome! But everybody is different. Make sure you know what the smell is like before buying.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I love the smell. Have been using it for years. Great value here.&lt;br /&gt;Chrome has been great with all products but this biggest bottle is the best value.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> GIANT bottle, but half the cost of retail stores and I love the way this smells on my husband.</li>
    <li> does not smell at all.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product. This is my go to cologne in the spring and summer. Smells very clean and fresh. I receive tons of compliments on it from girls, coworkers, even close friends who would normally feel a little weird saying something like that. Smell last long close up but the potency does wear off after the day goes on. I personally prefer that with this cologne because its very potent in the mornings when you walk in the a place say like your office. All in all Id recommend it..........</li>
    <li> I buy this cologne for my boyfriend every time he runs out. It&#x27;s his absolute favorite as well as mine. At first I was skeptical about purchasing it from this seller because it was so cheap compared to how much I usually spend at retail price. But I can assure you that this is 100% real and not fake. I will definitely be buying from this seller again. It came quickly with no damages too.</li>
    <li> Most amazing cologne ever.  This stuff is wonderful.  Huge bottle great price</li>
    <li> Its a big bottle even the box is heavy, so worth the money for the size. It came three days early an in perfect shape, love the smell.</li>
    <li> This is my 6th time buying this cologne &amp; I been happy with the purchase until this time. The cologne was new as described but the only problem is that it has no scent at all.</li>
    <li> My brother-in-law says it makes me smell like a French whore. My girlfriend loves it, and she&#x27;s neither French, nor a whore. Your mileage may vary.</li>
    <li> Hope my friend likes it.</li>
    <li> GREAT SMELL, WELL WORTH EVERY PENNY SPENT! The bottle is very nice as well... Great gift option for the holdays</li>
    <li> It all started out when I tried a sample in a Macy&#x27;s and loved it. The lady was nice enough to give me a bunch, and it lasted me though a banquet and a graduation. People constantly commented positively on the smell. Heck, it smells so good it almost turns me on. That&#x27;s a bit of a stretch, I know. But it&#x27;s a great fragrance and you won&#x27;t regret it. Definitely a value size.</li>
    <li> Excellent for all men. Smile so good.</li>
    <li> Cologne smells amazing love the smell last very long long time</li>
    <li> The perfume do not stay on me when use as other Chrome that i have been using.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what some of the posters on here are talking about , saying their cologne was watered down, didn&#x27;t smell the same as the cologne they bought in the store , etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the 6.8 oz. chrome ..... it came within a week ....... well wrapped with bubble wrap ...... smells  &amp;#34;EXACTLY &amp;#34; like the bottle i had purchased previously at Macy&#x27;s  ........ it is made in France just like the bottle i have from Macy&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; ..... and the best part was Amazon&#x27;s price was $49 bucks with tax for a 6.8 oz. bottle ..... the bottle i had purchased years ago at Macy&#x27;s was $58 bucks for a 4.2 oz. bottle .  THIS IS A GREAT DEAL ....  BUY IT  HERE AND DON&#x27;T GET RIPPED OFF !!!!!</li>
    <li> Very good perfume for men. I highly recommend it to lovers of fine perfume. No complaints about the product. It&#x27;s really good!</li>
    <li> my favorite..... great stuff  women love it.</li>
    <li> One of the most important things about the right smell, is that it will be distinctive to you.  This is perfect because no one from work has it but me. Love it.  Also Amazon had the best price and great shipping too. Love this product.</li>
    <li> Always loved this scent !!! Cant ever get old</li>
    <li> Best smelling cologne ever! It definitely beats out any Abercrombie &amp; Fitch smell. It&#x27;s many, sexy, and makes you want to never leave your partner&#x27;s side.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and we both love it! It smells very good on him and he likes the way it smells. He usually wears Aqua Di Gio and this cologne is similar in its presentation. I think we have a tie between how much we love both of them.</li>
    <li> This bottle is huge, great smell, the ladies love it and so do I! Seller is great, fast shipping, great price, great packaging. Nothing but happy with my order!</li>
    <li> I bought the 3.4 oz cologne at Sephora around Christmas last year for my boyfriend. I am super picky when it comes to scents, but this one smells so good. I can&#x27;t even describe it. Just clean, and manly. Mmmm so yummy smelling. Definitely worth checking out. He ran out recently, so I ran to Macy&#x27;s to pick up a new bottle (I would&#x27;ve ordered it on here, but I felt unsure about which seller to buy from, since there were a few bad reviews that didn&#x27;t mention the sellers name. That, and I&#x27;ve ordered one other perfume off amazon, and in comparison to my almost-out authentic one bought in a perfume store, it was watered down and fake smelling. The extra few dollars is worth it to me for that peace of mind)If you want to check out the scent first, I know Macy&#x27;s and Ulta carry it. Sephora doesn&#x27;t have it in store any more though. Again, definitely worth checking out. And if you know the seller is legitimate, buy the cologne off here! The 6.8oz bottle is $100 at Macy&#x27;s.... Ouch.</li>
    <li> Better than expected!  Very happy</li>
    <li> Yummy, smells so good and last all day.</li>
    <li> Great product, arrived on time, Good packaging as well. The price for the sizes makes it an excellent deal</li>
    <li> Have no complains about the product. Really good price for the amount and a great smell to go with it.</li>
    <li> hubby loved it and it smells awsome!</li>
    <li> He loved this product. Great gift.</li>
    <li> This is the biggest bottle of cologne. It was bigger than my hand. Lasted my boyfriend a long time. I love the smell of it. I went to a store in the mall to buy it and they were charging $90 for it.</li>
    <li> Love it .It is such a light and great fragrance at such a great value.I would not hesitate to recmmend it.</li>
    <li> Love the smell of the cologne. Not too strong or sweet. I always get compliments and questions on what I&#x27;m wearing.</li>
    <li> I got it right on time and it was the genuine one which is very important when it comes to colognes, thank you.</li>
    <li> Great original product</li>
    <li> My boys always complaining they are OUT of the cologne...so when I saw this big bottle I had to see it ! And Holy Cow it HUGE!! Not to mention this scent is my boys favorite...both in high school and always telling me how girls love how they smell and even guys want to know what they are wearing !</li>
    <li> This is my everyday cologne. My wife loves the smell and I get compliments every now and then. One spray guys, two at the most.</li>
    <li> I love it and it&#x27;s the real deal!!!!!</li>
    <li> This smells so good! My husband and I both love the scent. I like it the way I like Eternity- if that means anything to anyone. It doesn&#x27;t seem to have a sharp smell, and I can still smell it on my husband after a long day. The bottle size is ginormous and I can tell it&#x27;s going to last for quite a while.</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT... It got deliver faster then i thought great price for the big bottle it usually runs at 80 $$ so the price was great n i it smells delicious perfect for ur hubby &#x27;&#x27;&#x27;</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this smell for years. It brings back memories to high school. Girls always comment on how they love my smell.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my dad bu I knew the fragrance from my husband. It is fresh.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing. My boyfriend loves it and says he&#x27;s constantly receiving compliments about the scent.</li>
    <li> Good value.......prompt delivery.....terrific scent.</li>
    <li> Bought this for myself and awesome price practically half off! Great scent; i get complimented a lot for this! One time I was at the mall and a girl walked back after she had just passed me to ask if she could smell me. She loved it, and asked what it was called.</li>
    <li> good transaction, item was as described.</li>
    <li> If you know your scent, this is a big bang for your buck.</li>
    <li> This bottle is HUGE and you can&#x27;t beat the price! I&#x27;ve been wearing this fragrance since high school, the clean fragrance is inviting and gets compliments from everyone! I do not like the other variations of the chrome brand, they do not come close to the the original!</li>
    <li> Smells great and last all day</li>
    <li> Great gift and smelled great</li>
    <li> Love this cologne.  I bought it as a gift for my husband.  The price was absolutely great and the bottle is huge.</li>
    <li> When wearing this cologne I get numerous compliments throughout the day.  The scent is fresh smelling and last for a long time.  This has become my signature scent and will be a part of my collection from here on out.</li>
    <li> Great product, just like described, very good seller . Thank you</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband. I love the smell! It&#x27;s so sexy &amp; not too strong. Long Lasting. Love it!</li>
    <li> GREAT price for this size. My husband used this toilet water for years and I can guarantee what I got I real.  Will buy again</li>
    <li> Amazing for the price!!!! Bought it for my boyfriend for Christmas and he loved it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend because it smells SOOOO GOOD! And for the price it was so worth it. It was way cheaper than how much you would pay for at a retail store. He really liked it too! It stays on for a long time, he put it on in the morning and through out the day we were indoors and outdoors, and I could still smell it on him. Great gift idea!</li>
    <li> Great value! Arrived on time. I would definitely order again!</li>
    <li> The product came quickly and was a much larger size than I had expected.  I got more product for the same price I paid for a smaller size from another supplier.  Great job!</li>
    <li> This fragance for men is the best and at this low prices I got to get me some more. I always get compliments about the nice fragance to the cologne.  I have been using this for quite some time and I will continue to use it.  Thank you</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this cologne for years and at this price couldn&#x27;t go wrong with it and it still smells great. !!!</li>
    <li> This is a great cologne that you wont get tired of. My Girlfriend loves it and it&#x27;s good for work as well. It&#x27;s a light scent with citrus tones that wears strongly, and lasts a long time. It&#x27;s really top notch and not cheap smelling, and won;t make you broke!!</li>
    <li> A light scent that I wear to work.  A good sport scent for the one the go guy.&lt;br /&gt;Not overpowering!</li>
    <li> I have worn this for years and I still get compliments from people on the scent.  Don&#x27;t fix it if it ain&#x27;t broke!  This deal on Amazon is by far the best around and pretty much lasts a full year.  Great deal and great product.</li>
    <li> This thing is HUGE like the size of my face - Just beware</li>
    <li> I always get great compliments when I wear this cologne</li>
    <li> Love it. el perfume demora solo un dia en llegar, le envio fue bastante rapido. considero que es una buena experiencia, por la calidad del empaque  y del producto.</li>
    <li> This is the best cologne ever</li>
    <li> I first tried Chrome Azzaro when I get a tester vile in my bag from my local Macy&#x27;s. I didn&#x27;t think I would like it so it sat for days on my dresser. Then one day I decided to give it a shot and I&#x27;ve been addicted ever since. So much that I found the 6.8 oz bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is very crisp and clean and not too heavy. It&#x27;s perfect for the spring and winter. It has citrus undertones with a very subtle hint of spice and gives a very masculine strong feeling. The awesome thing about this cologne is that the smell last all day. I typically spray it on at 7 in the morning and it&#x27;s still with me later in the evening. Albeit not as strong but still highly detectable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will always keep this scent in my collection and I highly  recommend to it any man looking for a masculine scent that last all day and smells awesome.</li>
    <li> at first i wasnt to happy with the smell but when my boyfriend wore the cologne i fell inlove with it.</li>
    <li> This is a nice cologne with a really great smell. I like it a lot. This is an especially good buy as it is a huge bottle of cologne. This will easily last 6 months, quite the bargain.</li>
    <li> strong alcohol smell. Not sure if my spannish friends will approve</li>
    <li> Great cologne for a great price and quick delivery</li>
    <li> Cant beat the price for a 6.8 oz</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle of this cologne.  The first bottle was the smallest available at Kohls and I wanted to make sure I could continue liking it after a month or so and didn&#x27;t just like it in the store.  After the bottle ran out I decided to get another and got this.  It has the same scent as my old smaller bottle, but is 4x the size so should last me much longer.</li>
    <li> Awesome, they work great.</li>
    <li> Given as present and was well received.</li>
    <li> my husbands favorite, the large size is very ecomonical</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd time I purchased Chrome. It&#x27;s a great cologne and smells good time.</li>
    <li> I love it when my husband wears this.. its not over powering, but still substantial, very manly but not musty which makes me sneeze, great soft aroma that just about any man would enjoyl.</li>
    <li> This is my fianc&amp;eacute;&#x27;s favorite cologne and it was nice to find a size this big for the price. I love the smell of this cologne on him. Highly recommend it to the male shoppers or female buyers looking at it for their guy.</li>
    <li> I get compliments every time i&#x27;m out wearing this cologne. It is def one of my fav colognes. You will not regret this purchase.</li>
    <li> It looks like a fake perfume, it doesn&#x27;t last even for 10 minutes, and the scent is totally different from the original in the store, total waste of money</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with both the quality and price of this cologne. I would definitely buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I get so many compliments when I wear this cologne. The 1.7 at Walmart was 35.00, so 50.00 for a 6.8 is a great deal !!!</li>
    <li> Love the cologne. Great smell for a guy. Giving as a gift to a friend. Package arrived a day earlier than expected (with prime). VERY happy with the quick delivery.</li>
    <li> i like the spray but i was expecting a bit stronger one,i dont know its just me or the spray and delivery was good too</li>
    <li> I love the way this smells and I get asked all the time what I have on when I wear this.</li>
    <li> My husband was asking for new cologne for his bday and I came across this one.  The smell is great and the amount you get for the price, you cant beat.  Will be purchasing again!</li>
    <li> I wear this every now and again when I go out and the fragrance is always very appealing and well balanced.  Many times I&#x27;ve heard that it has a citrus note to it, also adjoining the word fresh to describe it.  I would definitely concur that it is fresh.  I would also so it&#x27;s an attractive scent in that many girls always comment on how good I smell.  Due to many others enjoying this cologne as well as it suiting my own taste in fragrance I choose to wear it more often than many others I have. This is why this has been one of my favorite colognes for many years and probably many to come.</li>
