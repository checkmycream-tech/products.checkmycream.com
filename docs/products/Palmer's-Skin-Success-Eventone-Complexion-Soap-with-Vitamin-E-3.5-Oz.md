    <li> My skin cleared right up.</li>
    <li> My skin is smooth and clear. I use it all over, Will definitely order more soon. I love it. Thanks so much.</li>
    <li> I bought Palmer&#x27;s fade cream and received a bar of soap as a free extra.  It&#x27;s great!  My skin became more even and blemishes went away.  It is very gentle and I wear contacts.  After washing my face I can put my contacts right in and there&#x27;s no burning.  When I use to use other facial cleaners, residue would be left on my fingers even after repeated rinsing or if I put the contacts in and then washed my face I would sometimes get burning with my eyes.  I&#x27;m so  pleased I&#x27;m getting another bar for my whole body.</li>
    <li> After using this product, I do see a difference in my breakouts and in my acne scars on my face. It does seem to dry out your skin, but I use a moisturizer on my skin after use. My face seems to be less red than it was before also.</li>
    <li> I have been using Clinique acne soap for years, it&#x27;s wonderful but not get rid of my acne and blackheads completely.  This soap works wonder! (I hate most are Proactive products, they don&#x27;t work for me at all)It so gentle on your skin and all the blemishes and blackhead disappear instantly. So far I have been using it for just a week.  I will give an update after every 3 months.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 52 years old and I get so many comments on my skin and my age. So msny ppl say I would have guessed early 40&#x27;s.  I have eight grandchildren and I&#x27;m so thankful for Do e taking care of my skin I&#x27;m blessed with healthy skin and Dove to help me keep it that way.</li>
    <li> This is decent soap for anyone who has complexion issues..i wouldent advise this soap to people who have delicate, dry or sensitive skin, its a litle to strong..</li>
    <li> Great product it really works on smoothing your compelxion</li>
    <li> I had my fifteen year old niece as how I kept my complexion so clear. So I bought her a bar.</li>
    <li> Great product, evens tone in a few washes. I had discoloration on my forehead and around my mouth. This product has help dramatically.</li>
    <li> In the past I&#x27;ve used skin success cream and soap with good results. I don&#x27;t know if my skin has changed or if the product has changed but this last time when I tried it it made my skin break out into awful, awful bumps. I had to stop using it immediately.</li>
    <li> I have used this company&#x27;s lotion before to help even out acne and scratch marks . I will give there bars a try and make an necessary revisions at a latter time.</li>
    <li> It really worked for me! I started seeing real results after 2 weeks. But you have to wash your face at least twice a day, use warm water at the beginning and then when you&#x27;re rinsing off the soap just use cold water, that&#x27;ll help to close the open pores. :)</li>
    <li> This is my second bar and it is  wonderful. My skin is still prone to breakouts but it needs a little moisture,too. My daughter has begun using it and she loves it also. It has a nice curved shape that fits the hand and it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I have been using this soap for 3 months now,my skin is radiant,my blemishes,stretch marks and dark patches? Gone!!! My skin is unified every from head to toe. Do yourself a favor and purchase it.</li>
    <li> Great I have sun damaged skin and my uneven tone looks better since using  I love ALL things Palmers.</li>
    <li> It dried out my skin sooo bad plus it leaves a greasy residue (surprisingly) in the shower so be ready to clean after each use!</li>
    <li> Nothing to brag about.  Scent is soft &amp; clean.  Husband has not seen significant results as he had hoped for.</li>
    <li> THIS SOAP IS GOOD FOR MY SKIN. IT CONTROL  MY PIMPLES, AND MY SKIN LOOKS AMAZING.</li>
    <li> i use merderma afterwards mixed with dermalogica chrome brighterner day moisturizer...extra spot lightening boost&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;bout this 1 time afterwards from walmart for like 2$ tho . worth the drive</li>
    <li> I used this soap before and I like it. It cleared my acne and black heads very fast and left my face bright. I didn&#x27;t like the cream, but love the palmers body lotion.</li>
    <li> i am still using it but it did not work for me at all :(....what a big disappointment!! dont bother save ur money!</li>
    <li> As in my review for the Eventone Fade Milk, I have been using this soap day and night for almost 3months now but I haven&#x27;t seen much if any results in my dark spots fading. However, I have noticed that when I use this soap to wash my face (with cold water) my face is brighter, as if it glows. So no faded dark spots so far but a healthy looking face.</li>
    <li> I believe i saw a slght change in my skin color but nothing to brag about. It does make my skin soft and hydrated. Mixing it with baking soda has helped tone my skin</li>
    <li> THE SOAP LEAVES MY SKIN FEELING ITCHY!!</li>
    <li> This product would be okay if it specified that it does not fade away scars, dark spots, stretch marks or any blemish for that matter..</li>
