<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works great! Just take your time applying and seperating!</li>
    <li> This mascara really works. It&#x27;s a 2 step process but very easy to do.</li>
    <li> love love love this mascara! it gives me the best false lash look without all of the hassle of false lashes. plus i love the fact that the fibers are natural green tea fibers! makes me feel so much better about wearing it so i know I&#x27;m not damaging my eyes or anything. i will definitely re-purchase when i run out. unfortunately by the time i buy here with tax its kinda expensive. if you buy from a rep you also get the 14 day money back guarantee even if you have tried ur tubes. you can get it cheaper from my friend www.youniqueproducts.com/kimmaxwell oh and that way u can guarantee it&#x27;s authentic!</li>
    <li> Awesome product! This is not a &#x27;too good to be true&#x27; thing. It really works exactly how it says and makes a huge difference in my lashes!</li>
    <li> I love this product!  It does as promised and is very easy to remove at the end of the day.  It has not caused any lash dryness or fallout or any other problems.  Once I learned how to apply in a way that worked best for me, I found it did not add any significant time to my makeup routine.  I found some application tips online that really helped and would recommend reviewing them before using the product.  I highly recommend Younique to everyone.</li>
    <li> I love it increased my lashes by 300% thanks!</li>
    <li> Sem to burn my eyes an made lashes cling together an gave them a fake tacky look. This product wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> Best stuff I have ever bought.  I have no lashes and now it looks like a have beautiful ones.  It is so easy and I do it everyday. love love it.</li>
    <li> Hands down best mascara ever. Don&#x27;t need my mink lashes anymore. Makes a huge huge difference. I love it. Make sure u follow directions.</li>
    <li> Definitely makes lashes longer and fuller but fibers fall under eyes and irritates eyes even with just one coat.</li>
    <li> I was able to use it the other day and I&#x27;m in love!!! I&#x27;ll never buy another mascara again only this brand!</li>
    <li> Wow! !  I love this!! I&#x27;ve never seen my lashes so long!! Very pleased with this product and will keep buying it for sure :-)</li>
    <li> Disappointed...my lashes are not that much bigger/longer then they are with just my normal mascara. Also, the fiber lash coating,  the little fibers fall into your eye. Very uncomfortable!</li>
    <li> This product did not come close to my expectations. Clunky and very unnatural looking.  Better off layering your own mascara.</li>
    <li> Truly amazing product! Will absolutely purchase again and again!</li>
    <li> I love the way my lashes look! This product has saved me so much money that I was spending on false lashes.</li>
    <li> Flakes after wearing for a few hours</li>
    <li> Best mascara ever! Makes your lashes long and lush!!!!</li>
    <li> I guess I expected more out of it.  I used it for a week and now I don&#x27;t use it.  Too clumpy on my eyelashes.  I wanted more length but got thick and clumpy.</li>
    <li> Not as expected. Maybe my eyes are too dark, but It did not look like I had anything on.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply and it does not smudge!!</li>
    <li> makes my lashes look long and luxurious</li>
    <li> Gave to sister in law. It made my wives eyes itch.</li>
    <li> Too many steps to put on,y do u have to put on a regular mascara before putting on this mascara</li>
    <li> Takes some practice. Watch that u don&#x27;t put too many fibers on</li>
    <li> Amazing, love it, will be a user from now on!!!! :)</li>
    <li> I love the product it works as promised.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this mascara. I have short eyelashes and deep set eyes so after 40 years of hundreds of different mascaras I gave up!. Read about them on FB. I took a gamble on this mascara and I am so happy that I did. My only &amp;#34;complaint&amp;#34; is that if I put on two coats, my lashes hit my eyeglasses!!!</li>
    <li> sent these back, maybe my fault as I did not realize the many steps to applying.  Did not try</li>
    <li> Very interesting product. Adds noticeable  fullness and length to my lashes. I was skeptical able the fibers getting into my eye and I have not yet had a problem. I recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Younique&#x27;s 3D Fiber Mascara works wonderfully and increases your eyelashes by 300%. You can even get it cheaper through Younique&#x27;s website for $29 and it comes their Love It Guarantee.  To learn more, see comment.</li>
    <li> Love this mascara, it is easy to apply and lasts for a couple of days if you choose to not wash it off after one day.  No clumps, huge longer fuller lashes.  You can get it cheaper at [...]</li>
    <li> Very disappointed with this product. Alot of time goes into applying it as per the directions. The fibers are clumpy and don&#x27;t stay on my lashes all day. Before I am ready to leave work I look like a hot mess. The tube of fibers ran out before the tube of gel did. Definitely NOT worth the $$ I paid. Will not recommend or purchase again.</li>
    <li> It works great! ....I like it so far.  But definitely need a metal eyelash comb with it..</li>
    <li> Absolutely in love!!! Got the product in 2 days..I&#x27;ve NEVER gotten complimented on my lashes until I purchased this product! I will continue to buy!!!!!</li>
    <li> Love this! Shopping took a whole so I contacted seller and they shopped over night for me at no charge and even gave me 5% back for waiting. Very nice company. The product makes my lashes look a lot longer. Washes off easily too.</li>
    <li> This works pretty well, actually. The only thing is that sometimes I get the fibers IN my eye, and it&#x27;s really annoying.. but it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Cool stuff. Really makes lashes longer!! They look great, too. Not false or clumpy!</li>
    <li> Takes a little practice to get it looking good but totally worth it so far, I don&#x27;t know how long it lasts yet though which is a pretty important factor. Seems like aliy of steps but it&#x27;s simple. I don&#x27;t think my lashes look fake by any means but they&#x27;re definitely bigger and better than what normal mascara can do so it&#x27;s a go for me for any special occasion or when I&#x27;m out with my husband I don&#x27;t waste it on just random days.</li>
    <li> I bought this through the actual website, but the product is amazing. I have short eyelashes, and when I wear regular mascara you can barely tell. I try this mascara and everyone notice my eyelashes. I know the mascara is expensive, but totally worth the price. I will buy again and I recommended to my family. I try fake eyelashes but they are a hassle, I think this mascara is way better!</li>
    <li> I love these lashes. Works wonders.</li>
    <li> These lashes are amazing!! Buy from a presenter @ [...]</li>
    <li> I use this mascara everyday...my eyes get irritated easy from makeup but younique is all natural and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin....my lashes looked huge and it was so easy to put on...you can buy them for $29 through younique here&#x27;s the link.... [...]</li>
    <li> This product is amazing but all youniques products are only supposed to be sold through a presenter. Not ebay nor amazon. You can get knock off or over charged or old product and not get the return policy younique provides. I would not buy from anyone other than direct younique presenter. Any questions email alysiasexton@gmail.com</li>
    <li> Love it! I use it with my amazing &amp;#34;they&#x27;re real&amp;#34; mascara n they r long n beautiful. N super super thick! Its a good price not expensive at all! I would give it more stars if I could!</li>
    <li> Lots of people talking about this, I got it to try.  It&#x27;s good.  Not something I would use every day, however I am 60 meaning that I don&#x27;t dress up every day.  It&#x27;s good stuff, the fibers can be a bit irritating, but if you wear mascara (thicker) you probably will not notice.  Better than getting last extensions.</li>
    <li> For me when doing my make up, doing my mascara always takes the longest.  Even though there are two wands for this process, it takes me no longer than normal.  Today, 9/30/14, is the 3rd day I&#x27;ve used it and so far so good, I really like it.  For me I have 3 minor negatives.  1)  I HATE the mascara applicator.  My lashes don&#x27;t like bristle wands.  2) The fibers from the second tube can get in your eye.  You need to make sure you don&#x27;t get the fiber wand too close to the lash line nearest your eye ball.  3)  Finally, for me it&#x27;s a bit over priced.  I found a lengthening mascara by Benefit that is great.  The wand is great and it does lengthen, but not as much as Youique&#x27;s version.</li>
    <li> did not make my eyelashes any longer...</li>
    <li> Looovvveeee this stuff! Very fast delivery also</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! However, only purchase through a Younique representative to ensure quality! Also, it&#x27;s cost less!&lt;br /&gt;  - Tiffanie Tvaroch&lt;br /&gt;www.youniqueproducts.com/tiffanie</li>
    <li> Makes your eyelashes huge!!!</li>
    <li> Love it...i will be purchasing more</li>
    <li> Good product and very fast service!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like this product, sorry! but not work.</li>
    <li> SUPER MEGA AMAZING!!! I LOVE SO MUCH!!!!!!❤️❤️❤️ THANKS YOU YOUNIQUE💋 FROM DOMINICAN REPUBLIC</li>
    <li> My product was old and dried out.</li>
    <li> I thought it would make my lashes longer but instead it would make it look clumpy and short and spidery looking</li>
    <li> Awesome products for your most beautiful eye lashes!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re like me &amp; can&#x27;t get falsies to stay on, this is a great alternative. Love it!</li>
    <li> Received the product almost a week before I was told to expect it. Awesome!</li>
    <li> Loving the product, takes a bit to get use to, but great results</li>
    <li> I like it okay but it does flake off during the day.  Maybe I&#x27;m not doing it right or something</li>
    <li> Not that it has anything to do with the seller, but this Mascara is awful!!!!! Do not buy it, you will like me regret it!! It is clumpy and gummy, not natural looking at all. Stay away!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> One of the best fiber lash mascara&#x27;s on the market!! I will definately be buying this again!!&lt;br /&gt;I got Long and Luxurious lashes fast easy and beautiful, it&#x27;s what every lady wants!!</li>
    <li> Best of the best!&lt;br /&gt; I went to a nail salon and the girl that was seating next to me had beautiful eye lashes.&lt;br /&gt;I told her how beautiful her eye lashes were and she said is Younique 3D Fiber and not expensive,&lt;br /&gt; it can be order it online.&lt;br /&gt;I took out my phone and order it, I tough (humm) anyway is only a couple of dollar, I will loose in case it doesn&#x27;t work!&lt;br /&gt;This was the best decision I ever made.&lt;br /&gt;I have beautiful eye lashes anytime I want my eyes  to look good!&lt;br /&gt;***Tip*** for best results, I used eye lashes perm first, before using 3D mascara.</li>
    <li> Great product! Absolutely love the results.</li>
    <li> Since I wear contacts, this product has been a slight problem due to product in my eyes.  Otherwise, it makes the eyelashes look great.</li>
    <li> This product works! Not for the person with limited time.</li>
    <li> My eye lashes can look fuller if you keep stroking the fibers on your lashes... The length I didn&#x27;t notice a difference... My Loreal and younique worked almost the same..  1 star for fullness that the fibers can provide</li>
    <li> I am truly a mascara addict. I have tried literally almost every single mascara from the drugstore and a few high end ones also. Any time a new mascara comes out, I make it my mission to try it usually. I am looking specifically for a mascara that gives me a dramatic look. This mascara hands down beats absolutely everything I have ever tried. Gives DRAMATIC volume and length and you don&#x60;t feel complete when you go back to using regular mascara. It enables you to wear less makeup because it opens up the eye so much also. Of course I always use an eyelash curler to begin with and after the whole process which in itself makes a huge difference too. The process seems long, like it&#x60;s so many steps, but it doesn&#x60;t take that much longer to do than your standard, two to three coats of mascara. It is absolutely worth an extra few minutes to use this system. As an added bonus, it&#x60;s VERY easy to remove. I use Pond&#x60;s cold cream eye makeup remover and it just slides off. LOVE THAT. The fibers are locked in place with the transplanting gel so I have not had any issues with flaking or fibers falling on my face during the day. It all stays in place. One thing I would say is take your time when applying, or it could end up being a little clumpy. In other words, do thin coats evenly distributing the gel/fibers and the thin layer of mascara you start with at the beginning and your lashes will be long, thick, and fanned out. Highly recommended to everyone OF ALL EYELASH TYPES.</li>
    <li> THIS STUFF IS AWESOME, takes a bit of practice to apply without clumping but once you take your time and apply in multiple coats it is absolutely amazing !!!</li>
    <li> Was skeptical at first and it definitely took a little practice, but this mascara system absolutely works! Be sure to have a good lash comb on hand.</li>
    <li> The product is great ! for me it increased volume rather than length. But I&#x27;m satisfied with the product, it&#x27;s simple to use and gives your eyes and extra &amp;#34;umphh&amp;#34; ♡</li>
    <li> I am disgusted people who are reps would sell one here! Plus with youniqueproducts./brittanydunham they can guarantee any issues! Not to mention the prices listed on here are way more then what they sell for!</li>
    <li> The item arrived on time..that&#x27;s a big plus:) I follow the directions to the letter and although it didn&#x27;t look exactly like the lashes shown in the advertisement it was still a significant improvement.. the product was easy to use and it&#x27;s very long wearing.. good product.. worth the money:)</li>
    <li> it did make my lashes longer..my lashes are sparse..when I washed off the mascar with make up remover.it made some of my lashes fall out...afraid to use again..</li>
    <li> Meh.  I ordered them from a friend, not through amazon, and I&#x27;m really not impressed.  I feel like I could probably get the same effect from repeated applications of mascara. It honestly just makes it look like you have clumpy spider lashes no matter how you apply it. Also, my eyes are itchy as hell and have been all day. Kind of feels like little razor blades in your eyeballs.....would not recommend</li>
    <li> OMG!!! I love love this mascara, I have short eye lashes, and this mascara is amazing making my lashes look so long. This is my new best friend, I never leave home without the mascara on. I wish the price would come down or have the supplier offer free shipping. But I will always use it,and would recommend this to all my friends and family. Thank you Younique 😀</li>
    <li> worked well.  I used it with an eyelash primer.  Gave good results.  Be sure to use exactly as directed.  If you let the base that comes with it dry before apply the fibers, your results won&#x27;t be that great.</li>
    <li> Younique 3D Fiber Lash Mascara is amazing. It&#x27;s easy to use and my lashes look as if they have had expensive eyelash extensions. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I waited until I tried it out. It&#x27;s an awesome product and fast delivery. Thank you!!</li>
    <li> maybe i just need to practice, but had black fibers everywhere all day:(</li>
    <li> These make your lashes look horrible and clumpy. They look like nasty spider legs. And no, I didnt apply them wrong. If you look at the sellers promotional pictures on facebook they look the same! Bad, clumpy. 2 weeks after I used it once, that crap was still stuck to my lashes. It ruined my real lashes. Dont waste your money</li>
    <li> love! love! love! this mascara.  it so easy to apply on my really short eyelashes.  this 3D Fiber Mascara  will make an amazing result on your eyes.  last longer, not like the other ordinary mascaras that will give you a raccoon eyes after a few hours especially on a hot sunny day.</li>
    <li> My daughter was thrilled when I found this mascara on Amazon.  she couldn&#x27;t believe it.</li>
    <li> Sadly it was not the original.</li>
    <li> I purchased from a Younique representative and LOVE THIS PRODUCT!  I will never use just plain mascara again!  Using this product correctly, I get much longer lashes that have much more volume, too.  Used correctly, the fibers do not fall in my eyes.  It took some practice and watching a number of different youtube videos to find out that the fibers should be \\&quot;pressed\\&quot; onto the transferring gel rather than stroked from bottom to top as we do mascara.  They give me all the benefits of false lashes except that they look real!  My natural lashes are short and thin...NOT with this 3D Fiber Lash Mascara!  I highly recommend them.  I also recommend watching a few YouTube videos to watch how to apply them as well as reading the enclosed instructions.  WONDERFUL PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> I gave this product 2 stars because it does give my eyelashes significantly more length no extra volume just length. I have very small eyelashes that are light in color even though I&#x27;m a brunette. This means that when not wearing makeup my eyelashes are almost non existent. I do not like that in order to get nice results I have to also use a regular mascara then the younique version but I do love the results visually. My only warning is that it WILL no matter what you do it WILL leave black stuff all over your face. I even tried adding the transparency coat to the top of my lashes too but regardless I still have black stuff all over my face and in my eyes. It&#x27;s up to you if that trade off is worth long eyelashes.</li>
    <li> Wow, is all I can say. I got this 3D Fiber Mascara for Mother&#x27;s Day! I Love mascara&#x27;s and I have tried so many it&#x27;s not even funny. I applied it as soon as I opened it up...Before my eyes, my lashes were growing in front of me. I could hardly believe it. I normally have short, blonde, wimpy, sparse lashes, but no more. I love this 3D Fiber Mascara. I paid months for lash extensions, until my lashes started falling out, then the glues from falsies bothered my eyes, plus my eye lids always felt weighted down wearing falsies. I knew as soon as I used this mascara the first time, all ladies would want it! I have since had several family and friends try it as well at my home, and they are blown away how it just pops their eyes open. All you can do is try it, if you don&#x27;t love it, with this mascara there is a 14 day return policy. I have sensitive eyes, its great for contact lens wearers, it is hypoallergenic, it&#x27;s sweat proof, water resistant and lasts all day long!!! I have always used make up removed pads and it removes easily with pads, some use face wash/soap/water. Try it, and what I like best, you order today, and you will recieve in 3-4 days via the mail. It truly is the best mascara I have ever used, I am being sincere! It works!!! I ordered mine from[...]; for $29 mine has lasted 3 1/2 months...if you apply it correctly it won&#x27;t flake off...always apply the gel, fibers then the gel to seal the fibers, and apply a second coat, depending upon the look and length you want. I heard the 3D Fiber mascara saying it was Younique, that is sold on Amazon is a knock off, so beward..to get the real deal I ordered mine from [...]</li>
    <li> I love this mascara! It&#x27;s just as fast and easy as regular mascara but gives you the look if false eyelashes without looking false. Great for someone like me with sparse eyelashes! Washes off easily at the end of the day just like mascara!  I love it!</li>
    <li> It is a good product, and when applied correctly definitely makes a dramatic difference in your lashes. Unfortunately I think I had an allergic reaction to it and couldn&#x27;t use it. The seller was great, and when I sent it back I received a full refund. Definitely worth a try.</li>
    <li> This does help you get the look that you want, especially those who put fake eyelashes on.  I only use it when I have family/friend functions and it has lasted me a long time.  One thing I learned though is that you put your regular mascara on first, then follow the other three steps. Great product and results!</li>
    <li> Wonderful stuff!!! The fibers make my already longer lashes look fantastically full.  I have length but no volume and this does the trick. Be careful not to over-apply, as the fibers will fall onto your cheeks and/or cause smudges. Other than that, I love this stuff.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like it.....the fibers come off during the day.  Not for me.  Far too expensive to not be able to use.</li>
    <li> No, I do not see a difference in this mascara vs store bought. My lashes do not look any fuller. I originally purchased because I met someone that recommended it. I believe she was also using fake eyelashes that enhanced the look. I would not recommend.</li>
    <li> The fibers come off during the day on face.I prefer my regular mascara.The length and the volumeis not good at all than I expected it either.It&#x27;s Not Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Works well, last all day. Have to get use to using it</li>
    <li> The first day, a couple fibers stayed in my eye all day. It was so bloodshot and sore, I didn&#x27;t use it for a couple of days. The look was good, but not as good as I expected. I would recommend this, especially if your lashes are thin.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> This is the best mascara on Earth!</li>
    <li> Great product! Great price! Fast delivery I will purchase again from this seller. Had 0 problems.</li>
    <li> I had expected more.  The little fibers are everywhere on my face.  The gel used to prime the lashes comes out of the tube like a spider web. Then you put on the fibers from a different tube and another swipe with the gel.  By the middle of the day there were fibers all over my eye area.</li>
    <li> I bought it because my friend was swearing by it.  I&#x27;m not sure what she like about it,  for me it doesn&#x27;t work.  Fiber keeps flaking even though it&#x27;s between few layers of mascara and gel.  Personally, if I use my regular mascara twice I have the same results without fiber being all over my face</li>
    <li> Best mascara ever!!!! It honestly works exactly how it says it does. I have shore barely there lashes that were ruined when I had false lashes done. I have tried every mascara on the market but nothing compares to this product. My lashes look long and thick and it lasts until you wash it off! The only advice I can give is invest in a good eye lash comb to separate your lashes after applying. Awesome product!!</li>
    <li> Love the 3d fiber lashes looks great seller was awesome</li>
    <li> Coming from a &amp;#34;mascara freak&amp;#34; i think that this mascara is just &amp;#34;OK&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Why? Because I can get the same effect mixing 2 mascaras without the price tag and the fibers on my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit that it is very easy to apply and easy to remove.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the BEST for lash enhancement and quite simple to use.  LOVED it!</li>
    <li> i like it really does enhance your eyelashes, however the fibers do fall under your eyes through the day, so you do need to make sure to wipe every couple hours.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a first time fiber lash user and I love this product! It can be a bit messy if you are not careful though. Also, if you get the lashes wet, even slightly like from sneezing, they will turn into a big clumpy disaster and mascara covered fibers will fall all over your cheeks. Overall I still love the product. I have thin, short lashes with hooded eyes and these fiber lashes can extend them up to my eyebrows! It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
    <li> Did not like this because of the fibers in the eyes. I liked how it looked, but it hurt and I had to remove it immediately. Tried it a few times. Now I can not return it.</li>
    <li> This product ABSOLUTELY works. After 3 coats, my lashes were insane. It was easy to use and easy to wash off. The fibers did not fall off the lashes and onto the face at all. Removed the mascara using some Vaseline with no problem. I just wonder how many uses I have with the fibers...I feel like I&#x27;m already running low on the them. I have used the product 3 times. It really does work. Shipping was relatively quick as well.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. Does make lashes longer, fuller BUT.... Even after reading &amp;#34;how to&amp;#34; and watching YouTube videos on how to properly apply, I still felt I had pieces of fiber in some areas more bunched up than in others and even after  sealing it at the end, I had fiber pieces falling in my eyes throughout the day at work! Annoying!! Definitely not a daily wear! More like once in a while to go out at night! I prefer my regular mascara,</li>
    <li> I already have long eyelashes, it just enhances them. Superb!</li>
    <li> Obsessed with my long lashes</li>
    <li> Best.Mascara.EVER. see Younique presenter site[...]</li>
    <li> I love the moonstruck because I have short lashes and it makes my lashes longer. I really recommend it especially if you have short lashes.</li>
    <li> This is the most amazing mascara I have EVER used!!! I feel like my eyes are my best feature and this mascara really gives my lashes some serious length and volume... it takes some practice to figure out how much to apply and how many layers you want to do but once you get the hang of it, you will LOVE IT! I highly recommend this product! I am a life long customer!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product. The results are amazing and I am so glad I was told about this product by my best friend. I truly feel more feminine with this mascara and I love the compliments I receive.</li>
    <li> The results are amazing. Love this mascara.</li>
    <li> The best mascara I&#x27;ve used, by far!</li>
    <li> A little slow on the shipping but other than that great product!</li>
    <li> Love this product. It really works.</li>
    <li> By far the best thing I&#x27;ve used. Ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may just have to buy 20 of these things just in case they ever stop making it. I followed the directions and used it after a light application of my regular mascara. My lashes were incredible! I believe that having nice lashes is the finishing touch on a look and can even be used alone instead of wearing a full face of makeup just to look more &amp;#34;done&amp;#34;. I have very straight short lashes, it stinks! I used my lash curler, regular mascara and then the Fiber Lash. I finished off with another coat of regular mascara after waiting for the Fiber Lash to completely dry, just to make sure everything held together. Can not say enough about this product! Works just as described and better than I could have imagined! &#x60;</li>
    <li> All of the fibers fly around and get in your eyes. Does not build up well at all.</li>
    <li> I love it!!! No more fights with my lashes. This product is # 1 on my list</li>
    <li> I have tried this twice and both times have been disappointed.  I followed instructions but still did not like the clumpy look and it felt to heavy on my eyes. My lashes are already long but not thick which is what i was looking for with this purchase. I know not everything works for everyone. I will continue to try to get it right only because this was not an inexpensive buy.</li>
    <li> You will never wear regular mascara again. Best thing I ever did for my lashes!</li>
    <li> I have very sparse eyelashes and the Younique product makes them look long &amp; full &amp; beautiful!!  I have gotten SO many comments!!</li>
    <li> This is hands down the best peice of makeup I have ever purchased! It really enhances my look without having to wear false eyelashes. All women should invest in this. I will continue to purchase it as long as it is sold!!!</li>
    <li> Marvelous product. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> So awesome.  I only added one coat to try it out and the difference is amazing</li>
    <li> NOT REAL. THIS IS FAKE FROM CHINA. You must buy from younique representer for USA made products and guaranteed love it or return it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;www.3dlashesbyjahira.com for the real stuff.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product.  I have used this in the past and love it.  It makes my short little lashes full, long and thick</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Worth every cent!</li>
    <li> The product I&#x27;d not what  I thought it would be once you use your mascara then the gel and then the fibers there was a lot of clumping. Then once i got it on my eyes stay red all day because the fibers will drop into your eyes do you are not supposed to use that many but that&#x27;s what makes your lashes stand out. I myself thought it would be a little different,but that&#x27;s just my opinion it may be great for some.</li>
    <li> The product was empty when I received it.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I just using it today and I&#x27;m in love with it. I will definitely buy it again. My lash looks long and thicker. Amazing!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this mascara. It really gives you longer fuller lashes. It is such a huge difference that you really have to see to believe. Its all natural and hypoallergenic which is awesome for my sensitive skin, and I have never gotten the fibers in my eyes which is great for my contacts. But I always shop from a rep, which is what lost this product 2 stars because its more expensive on here, plus the rep&#x27;s are not permitted to sell on any external sites, so if you buy from here, or anywhere but a rep your product is most likely expired or damaged or fake. Or a younique presenter jacking up the price to get more money. I shop from lash alert.com&lt;br /&gt;I am also posting a &amp;#34;selfie&amp;#34; using the younique product on the left eye and maybelline on the right. See the difference!</li>
    <li> Love , love this mascara .. Girls if you want your eyes to pop you need to try this!  You will be amazed as I was . As for your other mascaras they will end up at the bottom of your drawer or in the trash..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suez</li>
    <li> I dislike the product and the vendor has the worst customer service ever!</li>
    <li> I am in love!! This product wowed me!!! My lashes look amazing this is now one of my favorite makeup products!!!</li>
    <li> I have naturally thick and long eyelashes but after reading reviews I really wanted to experience what this mascara had to offer but honestly I like my regular mascara a lot more this made them a bit thicker but in a bad way kinda like it didn&#x27;t make mine longer but the thickness was in clumps and the fibers kept getting in my eyes causing my eyes to start watering it&#x27;s okay I mean In my opinion if you have long thick lashed like I do naturally don&#x27;t buy this product. My seller was fantastic by the way and much cheaper than Amazon the shipping was a bit long but the price was pretty awesome!</li>
    <li> I am so pleased with this product.  It has given me the look of long lush eye lashes without the hassle of putting on false eye lashes.  Very natural looking.</li>
    <li> Mediocre not exactly work the price</li>
    <li> Does what it says...longer lashes!  Great product.</li>
    <li> Incredible stuff! Really works worth the price.</li>
    <li> Really good produced  i like it very much my husband Love it as well</li>
    <li> Amazing. Read the directions and you won&#x27;t have a problem.</li>
    <li> Younique 3D mascara is just crap. It&#x27;s all made by this lady in China. I know someone that was contacted by the lady who created the mascara so she decided &amp;#34;ok sure, I&#x27;ll try it and have my eyelash extension clients try it for their bottom lashes&amp;#34;. When she got it in and opened it up it smelt and looked like tar, she put a little on her hand and she said it felt like fiber glass and made her whole hand swell up. The &amp;#34;fibers&amp;#34; are actually human hair cut up. The stuff is cheaply made and not worth the money. If you want beautiful lashes get eyelash extension by someone who knows what their doing. Fiber mascara is gross and clumpy and lashes that the mascara gives you just looks nasty and not cute.</li>
    <li> ... but took quite a long time till delivered!</li>
    <li> This mascara does work</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and great results.  My lashes look phenomenal.</li>
    <li> This is the best thing everrr!!! It works instantly!!</li>
    <li> Update 9/19/14 My second time using this product. I&#x27;m now getting use to it and my lashes are so long I would think they are fake if I didn&#x27;t know any better. My lashes are at least 300% longer. I really can&#x27;t believe it. When I take off the Mascara I see how small my lashes are. I CAN&#x27;T LIVE WITHOUT THIS PRODUCT. I just don&#x27;t want to leave my house without putting it on. Today I kept making it thicker and my lashes kept getting longer. I just don&#x27;t understand how it work - it is beyond AMAZING!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The BEST product EVER! Before this product arrived I had plain ordinary eyelashes. NOW, I have AMAZING, SEXY, LONG and LUSCIOUS eyelashes. I didn&#x27;t have anything before. I didn&#x27;t even bother with trying to make them look good. Then I went and had false eyelashes put in and I was like OMG these look AMAZING. Paying $30 every two weeks, worrying about them falling out and trying hard not to get them wet while I showered was a real pain. Then someone told me about a product I could get in Macy&#x27;s and I was like WOW, these look great. Then someone told me about THIS PRODUCT! I said let me try and OMG! OMG! OMG! I can&#x27;t believe how good they look now. I won&#x27;t use the Macy&#x27;s product anymore. This product does MORE than it says. Check out the Youtube videos. This is the real deal. It is so refreshing when a product claims to do something and it doesn&#x27;t even better than described. GET THIS PRODUCT don&#x27;t delay! Just get it and you too will have SEXY eyelashes that are LONGER than you could EVER imaging. My only gripe is - I didn&#x27;t get this product SOONER!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I did not like the product, flaked off after about 30 minutes of wearing.</li>
    <li> Amazing fantastic product I will never be without. Works as promised and easy to use. I have sparse short blonde lashes and nothing but fake lashes worked for that dramatic look. Well this stuff does it totally transformed my lashes could not believe they were my own lashes. It gives me a whole new look, easy to apply stays on till you take it off and washes off easily. They hit it out of the park with this product. Love it, love it, love it!!!!</li>
    <li> Awesome blog post on a buyers first purchase and use: [...]</li>
    <li> This is great!! Leaves my lashes super long</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Put one coat one for work, put another one for going out.</li>
    <li> This product flaked off in my eyes and on my face. Not good at all!</li>
    <li> Buy from a rep.  There is a 14 day guarantee that way.  I know because I am one!</li>
    <li> The younique 3D lash mascara is the best out there. It does not cost what you are paying here. If you find an independent presenter, which is the only way the authentic product is allowed to be sold, they are $29.00 plus tax.</li>
    <li> Love this product, I have long lashed but thin.  This product made my lashes look full an amazing.  Love the fact that then fibers are green tea, excellent product! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</li>
    <li> This  mascara really does work great!</li>
    <li> Recieve a 14 Day Love it Guarantee if purchased directly from a Presenter!!  AND it&#x27;s $29! [...]</li>
    <li> Tried this twice now so far. The gel is like mascara. The fibers get really really clumpy and it&#x27;s really really really hard to make your lashes look smooth and natural. So I give this a C-.</li>
    <li> I like the finished look but did have some issues with flaky thru the day.  Found that my reapplying the gel it reduced it greatly</li>
    <li> This mascara is not permitted to be sold on Amazon. Younique products are only sold through Younique&#x27;s presenter websites. It is very likely that you will get a fake or knockoff here and Younique cannot guarantee your satisfaction with our Love It Guarantee if not purchased directly from a presenter.</li>
    <li> Love this mascara. I have long lashes already and when I use regular mascara I get extra volume and length but I still wanted something that looked like I had false lashes on without having to wear false lashes. I HATE false lashes. More power to all the women who can wear them and can put them on everyday. So, I kept seeing this mascara on Instagram and finally decided to try it. Love it! It is EXACTLY the look I was going for. My lashes are even longer, there is more volume, they are full, and people think they are fake but I love telling them they are all mine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m feeling kind of meh about it...honestly, I like Benefit Really Real mascara better and it costs the same and you can get it easier.  The fibers can get in your eyes and, trust me, they are there all day. They do (kind of) extend the lashes, but not dramatically like the pics show.  I&#x27;d say, save your $$$s.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Make my eyes look great, however you can get it cheaper through the presenters. Especially if you host a online party I got a lot of free stuff! Anyways, youniqueproducts.com/fablashcb/ is a great presenter..</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS!!!!</li>
    <li> I really love this product. It&#x27;s very easy to use and the results are fantastic!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m losing my lashes due to chemotherapy, and I LOVE this mascara!!! But if you want a better deal on price and guarantee that the product is new and not old and dried up, go to the website directly and order. You&#x27;ll need a Presenter&#x27;s name to purchase it, as they sell their products through individual parties and reps. I use Janeen Rose, a rep customer service gave me the name of, so I could purchase without going to a party and just order online. You can sign up for email specials,too. You&#x27;ll need to register with a Facebook account, but they don&#x27;t use your page to advertise or access your friends lists. I had it checked out by my friend that deals with computers and they are legit. And they have other products you&#x27;re going to want to try. Their face primer is the best I&#x27;ve ever used. Enjoy!</li>
    <li> I gave high dollars for eyelash extensions along with a fill in. Never, never again! This mascara is the best thing... Ever! Easy to use. Easy to remove. Cost effective. Unmatched beauty! A win-win-win! Thank you, Younique!</li>
    <li> This is the most amazing mascara and does give you amazing results! Be cautious when ordering via Amazon as Presenters aren&#x27;t permitted to sell on Amazon or Etsy. Make sure you get the real thing! [...]</li>
    <li> Amazing product I love it!&lt;br /&gt;However order through a Younique presenter to make sure you get the quality! [...]</li>
    <li> This is the best mascara ever! It&#x27;s so easy to use and makes your lashes look super long! I love it. But, I would order it from the younique website it&#x27;s only $29!</li>
    <li> Love the way my lashes look!</li>
    <li> I recieved the product in  very quickly.  Having used it for a month now the Gel has become mushy and gloppy and the stick brush is too big so it gets clumpy and too much on it.  I do like the Fiber mascara - it does extend the lashes but maybe due to my alergies which casue my eyes to water, I think it breaks down over time.  But as a habit, I don&#x27;t redo my lashes during the day. I also have oil lids and lashes, so that is another issue I have to contend with.</li>
    <li> I purchased this from an independent Younique distributor. Before applying for the first time you absolutely MUST read up on application tips or check out some Youtube videos. Failure to do so will result in the spider lashes others are complaining of. It doesn&#x27;t take me very long to apply, and I&#x27;ve learned that less is more. Go easy on the fibers and only apply them to your lash tips. You can always add another coat, but it&#x27;s sort of hard to back up and make it look good if you gob it on like you would regular mascara. I use it for day wear so one coat is plenty. It gives me a fresh and put together look, even if all I applied was this product (and the base mascara you apply underneath). Love it enough to come over to Amazon and review it.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome, if you have the time.  Clotty if you are quick, but awesome if you have 10 min. to spare on your lashes.</li>
