      <li>from coming back are very good  </li>
      <li>My sun spots have started to diminish and my skin is becoming even toned.  </li>
      <li>It worked great when available, but when I couldn&#x27;t find it, the brown spots began to spread and new ones appeared.</li>

      <li>As I freckle easily, this product keeps my skin even-toned and freckle free.</li>
      <li>Great price compared to similar products.</li>

      <li>you so much!!!  </li>
      <li>Absolutely recommend this product!!!</li>
      <li>Took about two weeks to see a change, so i got excited to see at the end of the month</li>
      <li>It was not waxy and it absorbed smoothly into my skin.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m convinced now that it is not a bad product.</li>
      <li>It makes my skin smooth and flawless with a glow (from lightening it) that other facial creams do not do.</li>
      <li>It is worth a try</li>
      <li>Right from the beginning I could see a difference.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had the cream for about a month and my dark spots have lightened about 30%, which is really good.</li>
      <li>and I saw a difference within the first couple weeks</li>
      <li>I use it twice a day consistently.</li>
      <li>you consider doing a commercial, I would be glad to be in it.  </li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>you really need a chainsaw;  I will go to CVS and buy a product there.</li>
      <li>Couldn&#x27;t really use this, after a week my face began to break out.</li>
      <li>The cream really works for me.smells good.and for the price</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t really like the smell of the product.</li>
      <li>This product doesn&#x27;t smell the same as the original</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t mind that it doesn&#x27;t smell floral but a little more &amp;#34;medicated&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>That is fantastic but not really much as I want</li>
      <li>But I&#x27;ve been using it now for 2-3 weeks and have no negative effects.</li>
      <li>I love the fake that it goes on smooth but can make my skin a bit oily at times.</li>
      <li>I am very sensitive.</li>
      <li>I gave it to my Mom and told her to try it on her hands first just in case it does the same thing to her.  </li>
      <li>So far this seem to be working well!</li>
      <li>If you use this product twice a day as recommended it will clear up your skin and give you sun protection,good for all skin types</li>
      <li>I am on my way to a clear and even complexion again.</li>
      <li>and I have sensitive</li>
      <li>I am 78 years old and it has lightened my darker age spots, and removed the lighter ones.</li>
      <li>Nothing gets rid of the brown spots completely</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t do much as far as fading spots.</li>
      <li>It spreads on with a caulk like feeling to the cream; as if it is too old.</li>
      <li>I love the way Esoterica helps to get rid of dark spots on my skin, in my case it only took about 2 weeks to see a difference, I would recommend this product to people who have problems with dark spots after a bump or acne, it works very well.</li>
      <li>I find this works better for me than the other Fade Creams I have used in the past.</li>
      <li>Other than be very oily, nothing happened.</li>
      <li>Initially, the burned area was lighter than the rest of my face, but now my natural color is back.</li>
      <li>so I was a little reluctant to use it at first.</li>
      <li>Yes there is a little stinging at first</li>
      <li>This fade cream really does reduce the appearance of dark spots on my face and chest.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The product looked fine but after using it awhile I realized it smelled really bad. I can&#x27;t use it now so I don&#x27;t know how it works.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t bother- greasy, doesn&#x27;t work&lt;br /&gt;I have very light skin, and used this as instructed for weeks. Other than be very oily, nothing happened. Only up side was not breaking out.</li>
    <li> I used this for every body part and it works!! It does have a smell to it but nothing bad!!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years, daily under foundation.  It is not greasy, and allows my skin to hold moisture.  As I freckle easily, this product keeps my skin even-toned and freckle free.</li>
    <li> After starting to go to an aesthetician for my skin &amp; eyebrows she recommended a fade cream with moisturizers &amp; sunscreen. I began to search online &amp; decided to try Esoterica. I was very pleased with the results. It brightened my skin &amp; faded blemish spots JUST like it was supposed to. When I ran out I couldnt find it in my local drugstore &amp; settled on another &amp;#34;fade cream&amp;#34; that was horrible. I just got this again on a recent trip to the local drugstore and began to use it again. Yes there is a little stinging at first but it&#x27;s nothing major or super irritating.</li>
    <li> Esoterica is a great product! I have been using the Esoterica Day Cream with sunscreen as well as Esoterica&#x27;s Night Cream well over 30 years and I have sensitive&lt;br /&gt;skin.  I simply love Esoterica.  It&#x27;s one of my beauty secrets. I wonder if there&#x27;s other products made by Esoterica!  It&#x27;s like magic for my skin. An easy FIVE STARS!</li>
    <li> Nothing has faded yet of the brown blotches on both my arms. Nothing bad happened either. I didn&#x27;t expect a miracle. Product shipped promptly, good service.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t really use this, after a week my face began to break out. Kind of greasy and I don&#x27;t really like the smell of the product.</li>
    <li> The product was delivered quickly and it feels good going on but it is too soon to tell if it is going to work or not!</li>
    <li> Everyone raves about my great skin at 60. Esoterica is part of it, on top of tons of water of course.</li>
    <li> I am impressed at how well this cream works. After one week, the darkest spot on my face began to lighten, and over time my freckled/sunspotted face is evening out. The smell is a tad medicinal, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me. The cream is thick, so a little goes a long way and it does need to be massaged in to avoid a greasy feeling. I appreciate that it has a little sunscreen in it. This one jar should last me for years.</li>
    <li> I got this product to fade away a stubborn burn mark left on my face from a curling iron. I only used a dab on the dark area and followed up with lotion because it would leave my skin dry and flaky.  Initially, the burned area was lighter than the rest of my face, but now my natural color is back. After a few weeks, the burn mark is not even noticebale.</li>
    <li> This fade cream really does reduce the appearance of dark spots on my face and chest. I have also used it on scars that left marks and it helped fade them away.  Great price compared to similar products.</li>
    <li> I have used Esoterica, day and night, for many years until this past year, and then have been unable to find it in drugstores anymore. It worked great when available, but when I couldn&#x27;t find it, the brown spots began to spread and new ones appeared. I am desperate to find it again, so turned online. Thankfully, I have found it. (Hint, it must be used faithfully for it to work properly.)</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do much as far as fading spots.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good product. It is just a little too thick/heavy for me, but seems to work well.</li>
    <li> The cream really works for me.smells good.and for the price is very good product.thank you so much!!!  very fast shipping!!!</li>
    <li> It spreads on with a caulk like feeling to the cream; as if it is too old. I have to add a little olive oil or something like that to enhance the smoothness of the cream.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite fade cream, it has sunscreen and fades okay. I&#x27;ve had the cream for about a month and my dark spots have lightened about 30%, which is really good. I just wished it works faster, but I&#x27;ll take what I get.</li>
    <li> I am 78 years old and it has lightened my darker age spots, and removed the lighter ones. My skin does not look like the average skin of a 78 year old woman.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been less than a month and I have seen good results with this product. I use it twice a day consistently.</li>
    <li> I used this product a few years ago and stopped using this because I thought my skin would not benefit any longer from using it.  However, after sun spots started to appear on my skin, I decided to try it again.  It works great!  My sun spots have started to diminish and my skin is becoming even toned.  I am glad I decided to give it one more try!</li>
    <li> This cream works great as a sunscreen but also helps to fade stains in your face. It also helps remove acne and scars caused by acne. Absolutely recommend this product!!!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years. It keeps your skin one color yr around it just takes a small amount.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for a couple months and I saw a difference within the first couple weeks and so did my friends and family. I love the fake that it goes on smooth but can make my skin a bit oily at times. It is worth a try I love it !!!</li>
    <li> That is fantastic but not really much as I want and I think it could be the best but not in my mind I get to u 3 stars be best and good luck</li>
    <li> I was never able to find out if it works because my face broke out horrendously when I used it.  I gave it to my Mom and told her to try it on her hands first just in case it does the same thing to her.  No report yet.</li>
    <li> I have age spots on  my face and hands and with constant use the product seems to be working.  Must use daily as described</li>
    <li> I use this product for many years. It was not waxy and it absorbed smoothly into my skin. This Esoterica I bought online is waxy and it does not absorb smoothly. ShopRite, CVS and Walgreens stopped selling this product. It was said that Esoterica has some connection to skin cancer. However, the product is effective. It takes a while before the discoloration disppears. I did not document how long it takes. I can see the changes when the product starts working. There is also a slight odor (not an offensive odor). I do use moisturizer after I apply the product. I would recommend this product because it works. However, I am concerned about the connection to skin cancer. I would suggest you do your research before using this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using Esoterica for 20 years, I have also been told that I look 20 years younger than I.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin look radiant and have not spots.&lt;br /&gt; I considered getting a face lift, but was told by the Dr&#x27;s and assistance how good I look for my age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you consider doing a commercial, I would be glad to be in it.  ( Being a X model) age 68.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Esoterica</li>
    <li> Great job!  All was excellent!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> i have not seen any changes in my skin</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for at least 25 years, since I was a teenager in order to get rid of darkspots caused by acne.  It continues to work and I continue to get comments about how nice my skin is.  I continue to use it as part of my daily routine and acutally use it AS my moisturizer.  It does take a couple weeks for it start working and if you stop using it, the dark spots start to return.  I have tried using other beauty products that say they do the same and never had the results that this product has given me.  It is no longer for sale in my local drug stores so I&#x27;m now going to have to get it online.  As far as other reports of the smell, yes it&#x27;s a bit strange, but after a few days, you get used to the smell and I don&#x27;t notice it any more.  Generally, the container will last me at least a year.  I have even continued to use it after it&#x27;s started to \\&quot;turn\\&quot; and get a little stale.  Still works fine.</li>
    <li> could not open jar even with a saw...you really need a chainsaw;  I will go to CVS and buy a product there.</li>
    <li> If you use this product twice a day as recommended it will clear up your skin and give you sun protection,good for all skin types too.&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;ve used it for years and hope they never stop making it.Try it!!!</li>
    <li> Arrived fast, but unfortunately could not remove the cap.  Had to remove with tools which resulted in a jagged edge that cuts hands each time item is used.</li>
    <li> This product is very good. This product doesn&#x27;t smell the same as the original so I was a little reluctant to use it at first. But I&#x27;ve been using it now for 2-3 weeks and have no negative effects. I&#x27;m convinced now that it is not a bad product.</li>
    <li> Right from the beginning I could see a difference.  I took this with another product and am very impressed with the results&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted a sunscreen to wear everyday and this does that very well.  But the added properties of fading the melasma and&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;keeping it from coming back are very good  I am on my way to a clear and even complexion again.</li>
    <li> been using it for a little over a month, theres a noticeable difference but I&#x27;m looking for better results.Took about two weeks to see a change, so i got excited to see at the end of the month but it was about the same.. and it can be hard to keep up with using it twice a day everyday. to me the it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
    <li> Every time  I use Esoterica Fade Cream, my skin looks so much better within one week&#x27;s time. I find this works better for me than the other Fade Creams I have used in the past.</li>
    <li> Use every say but now sure how it works. One freckle on nose seems to b fading very slowly. Creamy n non irritating. Does not bother my skin n I am very sensitive.</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of products at all price ranges and find this works as good as any.  It fades the brown spots if you use it every day.  I prefer the one with sunscreen in it as that helps keep the brown spots from reappearing.  Without sunscreen it is a battle.  For the price I don&#x27;t think you can beat it.  Nothing gets rid of the brown spots completely but this definitely fades them which about all you can ask for.  Aging is not for the wimpy!!</li>
    <li> After using it a couple of times my sking was red and with a lot of acne. Waist of time and money</li>
    <li> My Mom has been using this for 30 years and her skin is great.  I&#x27;m just starting to use and it&#x27;s made a difference.</li>
    <li> Esoterica Fade Cream Daytime.  I&#x27;ve only had the product for a short amount of time.  I&#x27;ve only noticed a little bit of difference so far.</li>
    <li> I like this fade cream for its smooth application process and amazing results. The cream can be used under makeup and as a night cream. It is very effective.</li>
    <li> It did not fade any of my dark spots.  Wish it had.  I used it for several weeks.</li>
    <li> It did not remove my dark spots.</li>
    <li> I love the way Esoterica helps to get rid of dark spots on my skin, in my case it only took about 2 weeks to see a difference, I would recommend this product to people who have problems with dark spots after a bump or acne, it works very well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and love it. I don&#x27;t need fancy perfumes so I don&#x27;t mind that it doesn&#x27;t smell floral but a little more &amp;#34;medicated&amp;#34;. It makes my skin smooth and flawless with a glow (from lightening it) that other facial creams do not do. I also love that it has sunscreen in it. I don&#x27;t find it greasy at all.</li>
    <li> Been using \\&quot;Black Opal\\&quot; products for years but they keep discontinuing things. So far this seem to be working well! Its been about three weeks now!</li>
