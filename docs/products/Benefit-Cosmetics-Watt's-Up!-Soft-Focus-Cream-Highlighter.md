<li> It gives just the right amount of sheen and glow to my upper cheekbones without making me look wet or crazy.  </li>
<li> You only need a small amount, as a little goes a long way.  </li>
<li> I use it for my brow bone, cheek bone, and down the center of my nose; and soften and blend with my fingers.&lt;br</li>

<li> Wish the small blender sponge it comes with could be removed to apply the highlighter.</li>
<li> I got the small sample from Ulta and used it for months.</li>
<li> The only thing it highlights are small wrimkles. :(</li>
<li> Not impressed at all.  </li>

    <li> Not impressed at all.  You can barely make out anything is there.  This is coming from a person who only does the natural look.</li>
    <li> I have has this in travel size, and final realized that I need to buy a full size one.  This product is great.  Especially if you&#x27;re like me, and your face SHOWS when you haven&#x27;t slept well!  If you aren&#x27;t an experienced makeup person, a simple youtube video or google search with show you the importance of this!  I love benefit all around, but this is definitely one of my favorite products!  I highly suggest it (it is worth the price tag!)</li>
    <li> Great if you are older and want to look ancient. Otherwise avoid this overpriced product.  The only thing it highlights are small wrimkles. :(</li>
    <li> It gives just the right amount of sheen and glow to my upper cheekbones without making me look wet or crazy.  I will never run out of this because you only need a simple swipe and you&#x27;re done!  Incredibly speedy shipping, as well!</li>
    <li> I apply this almost daily. It&#x27;s not too light and not too bright. Just right for my complexion. I need to use a separate makeup blender sponge with handle to apply. Wish the small blender sponge it comes with could be removed to apply the highlighter.</li>
    <li> Love it! I got the small sample from Ulta and used it for months. I&#x27;ts a great highlighter, I have a couple at home (powder and creamy) but one is my favorite. It blends super well in my spin.</li>
    <li> Sheer, subtle, glowy without glitter. Exactly what I wanted. Buy this.</li>
    <li> Magic on a stick!! Will only share this with a few good friends, lol!!</li>

    <li> It goes on so smooth, love it, radiant!</li>
    <li> Very shiny and a bit sticky. It doesn&#x27;t look natural and I actually feel like it accentuates my pores. It is fun every now and then when I am going out.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Adds the light, without a glittery sparkle look.</li>
    <li> I first tried Benefit&#x27;s Watt&#x27;s Up Highlighter when I purchased one of those Benefit Kits that has a handful of travel/sample size products.

I use it for my brow bone, cheek bone, and down the center of my nose; and soften and blend with my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;It has a bit of shimmer to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Smooth&lt;br /&gt;+ Blends well&lt;br /&gt;+ Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> I wish they would have made a color that was in between the lighter and the darker.</li>
    <li> I love it, I actually purchased one and it went missing, and even though it is a little pricey I had to buy another one because it just made me look so good!!!</li>
    <li> thought the color would be a little darker, but its still a nice color</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this hilighter!  I apply it over my make-up (to my cheeks, bridge of my nose &amp; forehead) and it adds a nice &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; to my face.  Not too much...just right!  I get a lot of compliments on my complexion and I owe it to this product.  I&#x27;m 45 years old....and I think this product makes my skin look more youthful.</li>
