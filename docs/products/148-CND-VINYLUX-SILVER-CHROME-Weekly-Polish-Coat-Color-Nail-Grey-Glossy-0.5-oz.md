      <li>Just remember if you buy it you need a top coat for the shine.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
      <li>Favorite nailpolish.  </li>
      <li>This polish and its top coat (another must) have a true convert in me!</li>
      <li>so easy  </li>
      <li>Just be sure to follow the process of applying to clean nails</li>
      <li>and I like it just fine.</li>
      <li>The color is great but the Vinylux polish didn&#x27;t work as described and only lasted a couple of days.  </li>
      <li>This color is true to its name.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s lovely and holds up really well.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had it on for a full week with no signs of wear.  </li>
      <li>The polish is fast drying and easy to work with.</li>
      <li>I bought it for a wedding (my outfit hat silver trim) and it was so pretty and lasted one week!  </li>

      <li>This is a nice silver polish and I use it for several nail art projects.  </li>
      <li>the full 10- days is to make sure to put a top coat on every few days.  </li>

      <li>The color is pretty but the formula is streaky.</li>
      <li>I wish that this was more of an actual chrome finish, super shiny like tin foil or actual chrome.</li>
      <li>Someone had mentioned that it wasn&#x27;t really &amp;#34;chrome&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>Good stuff, though this silver didn&#x27;t seem to wear quite as well as the other colors of the same product.</li>
      <li>color is particularly long-lasting.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great if you like a dull grey look</li>
      <li>(I wash and dry them just prior to applying the polish) and finish with the Vinylux top coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It certainly didn&#x27;t last the promised 7 days.</li>
      <li>a lot  of money  in the  professional  nail shop  </li>
      <li>so CND has passed the acid test as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
      <li>Even using a nice base and top coat, this color chips within 3-4 days.</li>
      <li>Maybe I got an old bottle, so I will purchase some locally and give it a try again.</li>

    <li> Long wearing, but just a little dull.  I went with the OPI silver instead.</li>
    <li> Great first coat !!!  I put another coat of a color over and my nails are better than anyone else&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Love this light gray (Silvery Chrome) color!  I use it on my toes and fingers!</li>
    <li> Great silver color, does not give a chrome effect though... but it&#x27;s lovely and holds up really well.</li>
    <li> CND Vinylux is the BEST polish I have ever used! It has enabled me to return to opaque polish because this stuff does not chip. After a week I can even file my nails with it on and get close to a second week of my manicure. The polish, applied without base coat, does not dry or discolor my nails even using acetone polish remover (a must). This polish and its top coat (another must) have a true convert in me!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. The color is pretty but the formula is streaky. Even using a nice base and top coat, this color chips within 3-4 days. It certainly didn&#x27;t last the promised 7 days. But I still like it...it&#x27;s not that expensive.</li>
    <li> I bought it for a wedding (my outfit hat silver trim) and it was so pretty and lasted one week!  I also purchased the top coat and I&#x27;m sure that helped.  It came off very easy with the acetone remover...no soaking like with the shalac manicure!</li>
    <li> I have used this before and the color is great… Unfortunately, it broke during shipping.</li>
    <li> Last almost a week with a touch up once in a while which is great for polish.&lt;br /&gt;Dries quickly only need a couple of coats and off I go!</li>
    <li> Simple silver polish, does the trick. I wish that this was more of an actual chrome finish, super shiny like tin foil or actual chrome. The finish is more of a matte finish. It is still flattering and I like it just fine.</li>
    <li> The color is great but the Vinylux polish didn&#x27;t work as described and only lasted a couple of days.  I even viewed the Vinylux polish demonstration online, thinking that maybe I was not following all the steps correctly.  Even that did not help. Maybe I got an old bottle, so I will purchase some locally and give it a try again.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed cause it didn&#x27;t shine like chrome.Just remember if you buy it you need a top coat for the shine.I tried clear polish on top and that didn&#x27;t work.It&#x27;s great if you like a dull grey look but I was wanting the chrome shine.</li>
    <li> Is it a mirror effect?</li>
    <li> This is a nice silver polish and I use it for several nail art projects.  The trick that I find with having these polishes last the full 10- days is to make sure to put a top coat on every few days.  The polish is fast drying and easy to work with.</li>
    <li> Favorite nailpolish.  Lasts one week.</li>
    <li> I love these products. You polish your nail and in less than 10 minutes you are out the door!&lt;br /&gt;This color Silver Chrome is a great shiny Aluminum look color. I love it on my toes. Great all&lt;br /&gt;year round.</li>
    <li> Excellent  nail polish  . I had  a oily  nail spending  a lot  of money  in the  professional  nail shop  nothing  staying  my nail .keep  coming  off  . So glad  to  find  this  product&lt;br /&gt;. Now I be able  to do my own  nail in my comfortable  home  with  out  spending  a lot  of  money  and  the  nail polish  staying  beautifully  more  than  a week .. Good  thing  is you  can  remove  the  nai  polis  so easy  don&#x27;t  have  to soap  your  nail on acetone  long  time  or buff  it out  . It&#x27;s can be  damage  your  nail . Love  the  product  .</li>
    <li> When they say it lasts a week, it does! I am not gentle with my nails so CND has passed the acid test as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
    <li> CND Vinylux is my favorite polish!  This is almost like a mirror - ALMOST!  :)</li>
    <li> This color is true to its name. The nail polish lasts too. Great for designs also.</li>
    <li> Good stuff, though this silver didn&#x27;t seem to wear quite as well as the other colors of the same product.</li>
    <li> It was reported to me that this works good!</li>
    <li> This is the only brand of polish I use now - a manicure in less than 30 minutes.  Just be sure to follow the process of applying to clean nails (I wash and dry them just prior to applying the polish) and finish with the Vinylux top coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This color is particularly long-lasting.  I&#x27;ve had it on for a full week with no signs of wear.  The color is very nice - goes with everything.  Someone had mentioned that it wasn&#x27;t really &amp;#34;chrome&amp;#34;.  I would describe the color as similar to the non-shiny side of aluminum foil.</li>
