<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought this product for my wife, she has struggled with slight sagging under her chin for the entire duration of our relationship. After you using this product for just 5 days she say a visible difference in her face shape, it is working! firming up the skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product shipped quick and arrived in loads of bubble wrap to ensure it arrives safely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looks great on our bathroom counter as well.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my mom, she like a lot. it&#x27;s really helpful.</li>
    <li> Instead of finding the package at my front door, I found the delivery package laying on the floor near my side gate.  Wondering why the delivery man threw the package over my side gate instead of leaving it at y front door? Good thing is that my big dog did not chew the package after all. The serum itself is fine. I&#x27;ve tried it only for a few days but have not seen any improvement for my dark spot on my face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Vitamin-C serums before and really liked them so I decided to give this one a try. I am not a fan. It produces a slight burning sensation and smells funky. Too bad :/</li>
    <li> This product is light and non-greasy.  It absorbs instantly and makes my skin feel great.  I&#x27;ve just started using it but am anticipating great results.</li>
    <li> Works great! After a few weeks my skin is smoother and less red.  My pores seem smaller too.</li>
    <li> So far so good. One of the better products I have chosen for my face.</li>
    <li> The best!! Amazing how one product can make your face feel so wonderful!!</li>
    <li> Burned a little the first time i used it because I put it on right after my in home micro dermabrasion kit. OOPS!! Now I use it in the morning before I put lotion on and in the evening. I only skip one evening a week when I use the microdermabrasion. My face is SO SOFT!! I recently went to the tanning bed and noticed a few dark spots. I quit tanning and used the Vitamin C and within a week the dark spots were gone. At first I thought it was making me break out until I realized my blackheads were vanishing, which appears to be tiny red spots. I am happy to say my forehead wrinkles are smoother, pores seem smaller, blackheads have reduced by at least 75% in such a short time! My sister is so jealous! Good thing her birthday is coming  up!</li>
    <li> I saw this product and had to give it a try. It does have a vitamin smell but once on and dry, it goes away. I noticed that it does tighten the skin and I feel good about giving my skin vitamins right to the areas needed. I would recommend this product. As we age, we need all the help we can get and this is a great product!</li>
    <li> I started using this with a little moisturizer at night. I am not 100% sure how much of a difference I see, but my skin feels soft and supple. It seems like it might be a little dark but it doesn&#x27;t change the color of my skin at all. I would feel safe using this under my make up as well. Doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or overly oily. I am hoping this will help reduce any signs of aging or at least prolong them a little.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Works wonders!</li>
    <li> This serum applies easily and absorbs fast.  There is no greasiness afterwards.  I&#x27;ve been wanting to try this type of product for a while but didn&#x27;t like paying so much money.  This is a great price and a good company.  They follow-up with you by email to be sure you&#x27;re happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Great product!! Highly recommended!! A must try!</li>
    <li> When the vitamin C serum arrived the bottle had spilled in the box and it was all dried out.  Didn&#x27;t get to try the product. Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> My face feels so soft and smooth when I use it on a regular basis</li>
    <li> Vitamin C serum that shows results.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I received this at a discount to try it out, and currently I&#x27;ve given it about a week of use.  The reviews were so good, I forced myself to power through the smell of this product, which is  vaguely reminiscent of orange juice and pee.  At this point, I&#x27;m getting used to the smell and I&#x27;m also enjoying softer skin.  I haven&#x27;t seen miraculous results on my fine lines yet, but it hasn&#x27;t been all that long.  As an add on, I will say, you&#x27;ll want to make sure you follow the instructions to follow this up with moisturizer. This is not really a moisturizing product.  But moisturizer also helps the fragrance issues, so it&#x27;s easy to remember.  If I start noticing more pronounced smoothing effects in the coming weeks, I&#x27;ll probably bump this up to 4 stars.</li>
    <li> Good Product and Fast Shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cosmetic lies the eyes of the male.&lt;br /&gt;And also lies age.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really good.</li>
    <li> My skin is super sensitive, so this was a big experiment but i have to say I have been using it for a week now and my skin loves it. I get this warm glow that usually only happens with make-up. I&#x27;m noticeably less splotchy and it has even helped minimize my pores.No real smell to the product, goes on like air, you cant tell you&#x27;ve put anything on after it dries.</li>
    <li> Good product, must try!</li>
    <li> I like the product quite well. Makes my skin smooth and doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts. I use it in the morning and at night before applying a moisturizer. Good product, however, the bottle leaks a little.</li>
    <li> I really love this cream/serum! Right when you put it on you can immediately feel your skin become smoother. I was hesitant at first because I did not like how it smelled and I couldnt imagine putting it on my face everyday but I have actually grown to like the it. Even if I didnt I would still use it because I can see results. I spend around $100 a month on other products and now I feel I only need this! Ill never go back!&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;I needed to update my review. I have since stopped using this serum. I started breaking out terribly after a few months of using it. I could not understand what was causing it but soon realized this was doing it. As soon as I stopped using it my face cleared up. Will never use it again.</li>
    <li> great product my skin is softer and clearer</li>
    <li> My skin feels smooth and looks refreshed. I have a few dark spots and dark circles and this has helped tremendously.</li>
    <li> makes my face oh so smooth. (I received this product at a discount in order to try and make an honest review).</li>
    <li> Vitamin C is perfect for those skin types that have acne broke out skin as it is a rebuilding type of vitamin which gives the skin the ability to repair any damage done. I like the serum because it goes on smooth, dries without making my skin feel oily or greasy. 20% Vitamin C is pretty common in skincare and a little bit goes a long way. This is perfect for those days when you are tired it gives the skin that little boost that is needed and brightens your skin. This is perfect for men and women especially as we age the serum slows down those crows feet and fine lines and smooths on perfect for your face and neck. Hyaluronic Acid is something you are born with but when you age it is depleteing and this product just gives that little softening agent you need to feel your best.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a couple of weeks now and I just love it!  It slides on easily and it feels wonderful!  It feels like it is hydrating the skin on contact.  I cannot wait to see what the next few months will bring from using this product!  Everyone should try this.  It would make a really nice gift for those you love!</li>
    <li> This stuff stings my face. I have used anti-aging products of all sorts for the last 10+ years, and this is not a product even in the top half. I also really don&#x27;t care for the scent, it smells very medicinal. I tried it for a week, but it made my skin feel stiff and sticky. My bottle came with a pump instead of a dropper, and the pump has already begun leaking all over. I don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great product... I&#x27;ve been using it on my face before applying my moisturizer.  I love the way it leaves my skin!</li>
    <li> So far so good. Did not have the burning sensation like some other vit c serums does.</li>
    <li> This serum is really easy to use because it dries so quickly.  My face feels super soft and smooth after each use.  This is a great addition to my skincare routine and I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on some scars on my arm, works amazing. I already see results!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!  Feels so good on your skin, not to mention all the good it does for you.</li>
    <li> Love the product. My skin feel feel more firm and soft.</li>
    <li> Very light and easy to use.  Feel great after that~</li>
    <li> I like this serum. It absorbs very quickly. I like how my face feel the next day. It is very smooth and glowing. However, I can&#x27;t stand the fragrance though. It has a sweet orange smell? I just can&#x27;t get used to it. But as long as this serum gives me great feeling after using it, I will keep it in my drawer.    I received a discount in exchange for an hones, unbiased review. This review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this product.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product.  I have been using it for a few days and already have noticed a difference.  My skin is smoother and firmer in the areas I used it.</li>
    <li> I like this alot, user friendly. I believe I&#x27;ve seen very quick results !</li>
    <li> I mainly bought this for the notion that it would best treat my age spots.  I&#x27;ve not been disappointed... they appear to be lightening up and my entire face looks brighter and fewer fine lines.</li>
    <li> Tightens and eliminates dry spots at the same time.</li>
    <li> Originally, I want to give it a 4 star review because it works really well except the smell of the serum is not that pleasant. but after two weeks i use it, i notice that the pore on nose my minimized and also the spots on it is lighter....But i  think for the sensitive skin user, they might have some difficult time at the beginning, because I did feel a little itchy around my nose area. Great serum!</li>
    <li> Pretty color and smell,  not overpowering or distracting.  Has not been harsh on my skin.  Goes on very smoothly,  has a great consistency.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure how it does with wrinkles but I will keep  you posted.  My skin has not been broken out since using.</li>
    <li> This is a great serum. I have purchased many of the specialty serums at very pricey tags but I must say that this one works sooo much better!! If you are thinking about buying it, you must! My skin has not felt this great in years!!</li>
    <li> Actually, I do not like the smell.</li>
    <li> I am enjoying this product immensely. I am using it primarily on my chest to help with the &amp;#34;crepe&amp;#34; skin appearance from being a side sleeper. I have used it for a week straight and have noticed a significant change already. My skin looks must healthier all around and the appearance of the wrinkles has diminished. I do have very sensitive skin and the first few times I used it my skin was red where I applied it but it did not sting or burn and the redness soon faded so I wasn&#x27;t bothered and have not had any redness since.</li>
    <li> This serum makes my skin feel amazing.</li>
    <li> i use this at night and i have noticed a difference in how soft my skin feels</li>
    <li> Have been using this for almost a month. My skin definitely feel smoother.</li>
    <li> Works great! There&#x27;s a slight odor that&#x27;s not fantastic but it goes away after I apply moisturizer. I noticed that this helps my moisturizer keep my skin softer.</li>
    <li> The product I got is with pump instead of dropper.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like the smell, and the pump is leaking when I used it.</li>
    <li> I really like the product the only reason I gave it 3 stars and not 5 is because the smell is kind of weird. It smells like a processed orange. Other then that it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> This is powerful.  Only a small amount should be used. I appreciate the instructions saying this should be used with a moisturizer as it prevents over dryness.</li>
    <li> I love this Vitamin C serum and it is such a great value compared to some of the other serums out there. The way this serum applies on your face and neck is so nice. It goes on easy and leaves no oily or greasy film. This serum also rubs in fast so you don&#x27;t have to wait a long time to continue with your daily make-up routine. The benefits of this serum are great it&#x27;s a natural exfoliator, helps reduce fine lines and evens out skin tone. If you use a facial serum or are looking for a serum that will give you great results and not break your wallet this is the one you need to try. Thank You</li>
    <li> Wonderful solution, feels great on the skin, immediate results.</li>
    <li> Has a weird smell to it, almost like elmers glue. I applied it once, it absorbed quickly, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll use it again.</li>
    <li> My face has an instant glow !</li>
    <li> I love the fact that this combines Vitamin C, and hyaluronic acid. This is a great combination recommended by many</li>
    <li> There are a lot of benefits of using Vitamin C. I really was excited about this product but it burns my skin. I used it several times thinking maybe the burning would stop but it didn&#x27;t. It did however clear up some acne by my hairline. That was a plus.</li>
    <li> I like how is absorb really fast, I will continue to use it, so far so good</li>
    <li> It seems to be helping my skin and I love the little pump. Another brand I tried has a dropper that I hate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, this stuff has to be shaken well each time, has a funny smell, and leaves a residue.  I will be sticking with my other brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount to give my honest unbiased review.</li>
    <li> I really like this and think it&#x27;s making a difference in my skin.  My face seems to glow now.</li>
    <li> not sticky and feels nice</li>
    <li> Ive had acne for years. Now as an adult I have acne scars and starting to get wrinkles. Started derma rolling and use this afterwards.  My skin feels great and looks brighter!</li>
    <li> Great serum!  Did leak a little in shipment, but it was packaged well in bubble wrapper, so it did not affect anything at all.</li>
    <li> I just started using this product and so far so good. It does not leave your face oily like most and a little bit goes a long ways..</li>
    <li> I really like this serum. I noticed a difference right away when using this product. It tightened my face and didn&#x27;t show the small fine lines.</li>
    <li> Amazing is right, this is so good for your skin. Seems to do a great job brightening.</li>
    <li> I just can&#x27;t wait to receive my shipment. Heard so many great reviews from my friends.</li>
    <li> it works very  well and has reasonable price.</li>
    <li> When I first opened up this product the first thing I noticed was the smell.  It smells rancid.  I could not get over it.  I compared the product to my Ole Hendrickson Vitamin C serum and that is not normal.  The Ole Hendrickson one smells like oranges and this one definitely did not smell that way.  However, I got over the smell and decided to try it and it stings.  My face was burning after using it.  Not good!  I would definitely not buy this product again as it is not for me.  I do have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Just as advertised, nice quality</li>
