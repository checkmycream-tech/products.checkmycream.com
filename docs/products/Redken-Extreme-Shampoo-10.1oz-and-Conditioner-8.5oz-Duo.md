      <li>so i try my best to let it do that, &amp; so far it&#x27;s working a lot better for me while using these products.</li>
      <li>This was just as described new, fast shipping, and a great product that I love!!!</li>

      <li>Great product, leaves hair fresh and smooth.  </li>

      <li>and my hair has improved more.</li>
      <li>I almost went bald bleaching my hair too many times in a row and bought this shampoo, conditioner, hair mask, and the leave in anti-snap conditioner after reading reviews.</li>
      <li>I love the way it makes my hair feels and it was cheaper here than at the grocery store.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really pleased with this product and will re-purchase, despite the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love Redken products</li>
      <li>Okay.</li>
      <li>I love Redken</li>
      <li>I first picked it up when my stylist used it on my hair and it turned out amazing!</li>
      <li>My hair falls out more with this product I stopped using it</li>
      <li>I like the conditioner much more than the shampoo.  </li>
      <li>I love love love the shampoo but</li>
      <li>Love this price, but I love the product for my hair.</li>
      <li>and i get so many compliments.</li>
      <li>Came another one, but its ok.</li>
      <li>They love the way their hair feels.  </li>
      <li>As soon as I applied the conditioner, I was even more amazed...</li>
      <li>I will be ordering more.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so soft and shiny, and smells good after using this product!</li>
      <li>&amp; i was sooo excited to try it!</li>
      <li>have color treated, baby fine, medium density hair.</li>
      <li>Got here quick couldn&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month, and there is a HUGE difference in my hair.</li>
      <li>I went ahead and bought the shampoo and conditioner as well, and can feel and see huge improvements in the health of my hair.</li>
      <li>After I use the conditioner and rinse my hair out though, it does feel smooth and silky.</li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definetly worth it!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s own natural oils</li>
      <li>However, I have found much better products on the market for the same price that I enjoy so much more.</li>
      <li>My hair is so much smoother and more manageable now than it was before I was using this.</li>
      <li>It has made a tremendous difference in my hair.</li>
      <li>I usually buy Redken Products because they are very good.</li>
      <li>I have noticed less breakage and I am so happy about it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been told by my hair stylist, I wash too much!!</li>
      <li>especially the conditioner is amazing.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked this shampoo, and I thought it prepared me relatively well for a drastic color change that I did.</li>
      <li>Redken is a bit pricy, but my hair was so damaged that I decided it was worth the money to try to restore it.</li>
      <li>one smelled ok, but didn&#x27;t really impress me too much.</li>
      <li>It does weight my hair down a bit, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me compared to all the wonderful things it does for my hair, and with other products I can easily fix that.</li>
      <li>This is an amazing combination of products if you have dry hair with split ends from sun and chemical damage.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing for my dry, damaged hair.</li>
      <li>They were a decent price on Amazon and arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>then I have to hot roll my hair.</li>
      <li>I have damaged hair from bleaching and this was the 1st product of many I have tried that actually made a difference in how my hair felt.  </li>
      <li>Not so heavy that it looks like my hair is plastered to my head; not so light that there&#x27;s static &amp; split ends.  </li>
      <li>My hair feels healthy for the first time in a long time</li>
      <li>Since I started using Redken products (shampoo, conditioner, anti-snap leave-in treatment, real control cr&amp;egrave;me care) my hair is incredibly soft, shiny, frizz free, and growing much faster.</li>
      <li>The bottles showed up really fast at my house.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really use the conditioner.</li>
      <li>This didn&#x27;t really do anything for my hair.</li>
      <li>My hair is really damaged and this shampoo and conditioner have helped so much.</li>
      <li>Too much protein, I think.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really glad I spent the money and bought this product.</li>
      <li>I still have to trim it a lot, but overall my hair is manageable and actually looks like nice hair as opposed to looking like Beetlejuice.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product, leaves hair fresh and smooth.  One thing I would change is make the bottles easier to open, I have broken a fingernail or two!</li>
    <li> The box was torn when I got it but besides that everything was intact and works great!! I love the way it makes my hair feels and it was cheaper here than at the grocery store.</li>
    <li> Cannot go wrong with Redken. Makes my hair feel great with body and I wash every other day with no greasy look or feeling.</li>
    <li> Okay. I can not explain to you how good this shampoo and conditioner is!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Me and my boyfriend have extremely long, thick, coarse, wavy hair. We aren&#x27;t even able to brush our hair after using most shampoos and conditioners without the brush getting stuck! As soon as you wash your hair with this, you automatically feel the difference. ESPECIALLY if your hair is damaged like mine, not only is my hair thick, coarse, etc. I have over processed hair as well. A lot of my hair breaks off and falls out. As soon as I applied the conditioner, I was even more amazed... I could glide a comb through my hair with no tangles!!! When i got out the shower, i let my hair air dry over night (testing, because usually in the mornings i can not even move my fingers through my hair) well when i woke up... my hair was extremely soft and bouncy. it&#x27;s basically weightless. Yes it&#x27;s expensive, but for what it does, it is well worth the price. :)</li>
    <li> I almost went bald bleaching my hair too many times in a row and bought this shampoo, conditioner, hair mask, and the leave in anti-snap conditioner after reading reviews. It&#x27;s been about a month since using it and an Argan oil I put on as well as hair &amp; nail vitamins and now my hair isn&#x27;t falling out anymore. Works great!</li>
    <li> The bottles showed up really fast at my house. I love love love the shampoo but especially the conditioner is amazing. my hair thanks me and i can only recommend it!</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t really do anything for my hair. It ended up drying it out</li>
    <li> I totally love this product from Redken.  I have tried the other redken products and I keep going back to the Extreme shampoo and conditioner.  The conditioner is awesome.  It detangles your hair so nice when you run a comb through your hair in the shower.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love Redken! I have used it on various occasions, and it has never failed me.  It is also not as pricey as some of the other shampoos and conditioners I have tried.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo &amp; conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used on my hair. I go back and forth from bleach blonde to dark brown and my hair can get frizzy when I&#x27;m blonde, this shampoo &amp; condition fixes that! It&#x27;s a little pricey but worth every penny!</li>
    <li> My hair is really damaged and this shampoo and conditioner have helped so much. I have noticed less breakage and I am so happy about it. I will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo&amp;conditioner and the price is awesome</li>
    <li> I love Redken so it&#x27;s not the product I am rating. When I received the shampoo lid was loose so half of the product spilled out. Expensive shampoo so not happy about losing half of it!</li>
    <li> Although this shampoo and conditioner are a bit better than your average, grocery-store-bought products, they aren&#x27;t worth the price for what little improvements they produce.</li>
    <li> Came another one, but its ok. All redken products are good, so no problem. But it was not the one that i choose.</li>
    <li> I bleach, color, and heat-style my hair all the time. Hydrating products were just not helping anymore, and my hair stylist recommended the Redken spray treatment. I went ahead and bought the shampoo and conditioner as well, and can feel and see huge improvements in the health of my hair. Definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Since I was LOVING the Redken Extreme Anti-Snap leave-in treatment I decided to try the Redken Extreme Shampoo and Conditioner.  Amen for this product!!!  I love, love, love it and will not ever be without.</li>
    <li> With highlighting my hair, it seems to dry out and look damaged. I use this shampoo about once a week, and I notice a difference in my hair. I don&#x27;t really use the conditioner. I tend to like using Paul Mitchell leave in conditioner everyday. I use some other cheaper shampoos the rest of the week, and save this more expensive shampoo for when my hair needs a healthier look. If I use this more than once a week, my hair feels too heavy.</li>
    <li> This duo came in such a horrible and damaged box that was taped so it could stay together. The shampoo and conditioner itself were FAKE!!!! I have smelled and used this duo from the salon and it is nothing like what I got in the mail!! It was watered down and made my hair feel like DRY STRAW!!!!! HORRIBLE HORRIBLE. DO NOT BUY.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t super impressed with this product.  Not that it&#x27;s bad, at all, just not amazing.  I like the conditioner much more than the shampoo.  After several uses, I can say that I feel like they both do what they claim to do, which is strengthen my hair; however, I don&#x27;t like the way my hair feels after I use this shampoo.  After I use the conditioner and rinse my hair out though, it does feel smooth and silky.</li>
    <li> This product does everything and more then is promises for your hair.! I use this at work and for personal use all the time and i get so many compliments. If your looking for a professional hair shampoo and conditioner that will repair and moisturize  your hair this is the product!</li>
    <li> My nieces in Norway only use these products.  They love the way their hair feels.  I am visiting them now and they are thrilled that I have brought them these products.  Redken is very pricy in Europe and the treasure this present from their aunt and uncle</li>
    <li> Best shampoo and conditioner ever!</li>
    <li> I have very thick, dry, naturally curly, dyed hair. Over the past 20 yrs, I&#x27;ve been trying every shampoo and conditioner out there in hopes of controlling my curls and frizz. I even bought products through infomercials. Since I started using Redken products (shampoo, conditioner, anti-snap leave-in treatment, real control cr&amp;egrave;me care) my hair is incredibly soft, shiny, frizz free, and growing much faster. Also, the prices on Amazon are cheaper than any salon.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who has fragile or damaged hair. My hair feels healthy for the first time in a long time</li>
    <li> It might cost more, but when the girl in the salon suggests it over the brands that they sell you get the idea that its probably a good product.  When my wife uses it and I can tell the difference that speaks volumes.  You only get one head of hair and if youre beating it up with colorings and straightening irons and blow dryers, maybe the extra money is worth the investment?</li>
    <li> I love Redken products but I have curly hair and this particular brand makes my hair frizzy.  If I was and condition with the blue then I have to hot roll my hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Redken&#x27;s EverSoft line before and that smelled great. This has an almost minty smell that I&#x27;m not sure I like. However, this is a great product. My hair isn&#x27;t heavy or weighed down and it feels healthier!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing for my dry, damaged hair. After it was bleached, then dyed several darker colors afterwards, it was awful. My poor hair was dead. I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month, and there is a HUGE difference in my hair. It looks and feels healthy! It&#x27;s so soft and shiny, and smells good after using this product! I would recommend this for anyone, and all hair types!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried every brand know and so far this is the best shampoo &amp; conditioner.  I can go 2-3 days without washing. I&#x27;ve been told by my hair stylist, I wash too much!! not goot for hair to wash every day...</li>
    <li> I usually buy Redken Products because they are very good. I usually switch the lines of shampoos, conditioners and masks that treat and moistorize my hair.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see what is so great. It&#x27;s just like loreal</li>
    <li> My hair is VERY damaged, it&#x27;s very dry &amp; I&#x27;ve tried just about everything to save it! I can&#x27;t afford to spend a fortune on hair products.. but my aunts a cosmotolegist &amp; she&#x27;s used this brand on me before so i decided to give it a try. It actually came within 2 days &amp; i was sooo excited to try it! I used it that night &amp; it made my hair feel amazing! I was so surprised with the results, but it works better if you use just these themselves instead of with other products &amp; to only wash every other day. I have good hygiene &amp; i hate skipping showers.. But i know it&#x27;s better to let your hair produce it&#x27;s own natural oils so i try my best to let it do that, &amp; so far it&#x27;s working a lot better for me while using these products. It&#x27;s definetly worth it!</li>
    <li> Love this price, but I love the product for my hair. Best shampoo and conditioner made. Makes my hair so silky and shiny.</li>
    <li> Very nice, i loved it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m actually a bit disappointed in this shampoo and conditioner duo. It smells like heaven, like tootsie rolls. I first picked it up when my stylist used it on my hair and it turned out amazing! However with continued use (every other wash) it leaves my hair dry, unmanagable and brittle. Too much protein, I think. Switching to Loreal Evercreme cleansing conditioner and hoping for a change.</li>
    <li> My hair dresser said this line is the best for breakage.  So far so good.</li>
    <li> This was just as described new, fast shipping, and a great product that I love!!! It makes a big difference in my hair!</li>
    <li> I used all the Redken products and my hair is new! My French styler suggested me this product and she was correct. It is amazing.</li>
    <li> The only shampoo that helps my frizzy wavey hair. Got here quick couldn&#x27;t beat the price! Very happy with the product!!! :)</li>
    <li> luv it hair feels and looks great</li>
    <li> This is an amazing combination of products if you have dry hair with split ends from sun and chemical damage.  I use the entire product until the bottles are empty only once or twice a year.  Well worth the money, as it totally rids hair of split end damage.  I don&#x27;t think it is recommended for continuous use....</li>
    <li> For my fine hair, this is the perfect winter-time shampoo &amp; conditioner.  Not so heavy that it looks like my hair is plastered to my head; not so light that there&#x27;s static &amp; split ends.  Perfect!  Smells great, too.</li>
    <li> Awesome.product and awesome delivery!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It has made a tremendous difference in my hair. My hair is so much smoother and more manageable now than it was before I was using this. It does weight my hair down a bit, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me compared to all the wonderful things it does for my hair, and with other products I can easily fix that. I do have quite oily hair though.</li>
    <li> The conditioner and shampoo both work very nice on my hair that is colored.  My hair dresser&lt;br /&gt;recommended it to me.</li>
    <li> This shampoo changed my hair!  This made my hair healthy and beautiful after many years of coloring it.  I would suggest using this for about a month and adding another shampoo in between uses after that because after a long period of use it starts to make your hair feel weird.  Switching it up daily after a month really stopped that problem.</li>
    <li> These products work well for my hair. They were a decent price on Amazon and arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> First off, I don&#x27;t believe in spending lots of money on ANYTHING especially not beauty products.  However a couple months ago I trusted someone to help me bleach my hair and she RUINED it. My hair turned into a gummy mess of straw.  After some research I found other people had given a lot of positive feedback about REDKEN extreme products and I have to say this shampoo is the s***! If you&#x27;ve seriously damaged your hair this stuff is worth the money. After only a couple uses my hair started returning to normal. I still have to trim it a lot, but overall my hair is manageable and actually looks like nice hair as opposed to looking like Beetlejuice.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  I have damaged hair from bleaching and this was the 1st product of many I have tried that actually made a difference in how my hair felt.  I have thick, long, normally curly hair and this is helping to bring my poor hair back from the brink after over processing.  Also genius that the shampoo bottle is bigger than the conditioner!  I ALWAYS have leftover conditioner with other brands.</li>
    <li> Type of hair I have: Oily hair with damage from coloring&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked this shampoo, and I thought it prepared me relatively well for a drastic color change that I did. I went from a dark burgundy red to a golden blonde and this allowed my hair to hold up to the strain of that change. However, I have found much better products on the market for the same price that I enjoy so much more. Specifically, Sebastian Penetraitt shampoo and conditioner...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one smelled ok, but didn&#x27;t really impress me too much.</li>
    <li> I thinks the horse shampoo and conditioner is better... My hair falls out more with this product I stopped using it and my hair has improved more. But it does make my hair smell nice and it feels good.</li>
    <li> I bought this product at a drug store, so I can&#x27;t comment on Amazon&#x27;s shipping or costumer service experience, but the product itself is wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have color treated, baby fine, medium density hair. Redken is a bit pricy, but my hair was so damaged that I decided it was worth the money to try to restore it. I&#x27;m really glad I spent the money and bought this product. The shampoo is great, no complaints, but it&#x27;s the conditioner that I&#x27;m really in love with. I have long, tangly hair. I use about half the amount of this conditioner that I did before, and even half the amount works so much better. My hair completely detangles the moment I comb the conditioner through, and it dries soft and shiny, but in a light, clean way instead of a heavy or sticky, waxy way. I&#x27;m really pleased with this product and will re-purchase, despite the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a bit of a disclaimer, this is the first expensive, nice hair system I&#x27;ve used (I used L&#x27;Oreal and Garnier before this, which are good for the price), so I don&#x27;t know how it compares to other salon brands. And I&#x27;ve only been using it for a couple weeks, so we&#x27;ll see how it does long term. But so far I&#x27;m really impressed and pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest buying it from Amazon. I tried to save on shipping by going to Rite Aid, but it was almost twice as expensive there.</li>
