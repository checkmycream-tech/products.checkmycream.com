      <li>best mineral sunscreen i&#x27;ve found for the face thus far.  </li>
      <li>goes on the skin very smoothly .  </li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s my understanding of what is in the product (perhaps more marketing on</li>
      <li>Try it you will love it.</li>
      <li>I love this sunscreen.</li>
      <li>Best organic, physical sunblock for the face.</li>
      <li>I love this sunscreen because it is organic and does not irritate my skin.</li>
      <li>love it.  </li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars because I need more clarification on their ingredients...</li>
      <li>can&#x27;t use this item until satisfying with this item.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>so I was quite pleased to find this sunscreen.</li>
      <li>I love how easily it glides on my skin</li>
      <li>My 60ish skin is dry and this is a wonderful moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>Most importantly, and what does make is so very special is the lack of toxic materials to create the function</li>
      <li>goes under make up easily.  </li>
      <li>yes, the ingredients are good for me and that is the most important thing I look for in personal products.</li>
      <li>Good for my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I was so excited when I found this sunscreen after reading the reviews.</li>
      <li>The fact that it performs so well and works - and is organic - is what makes this incredibly special.  </li>
      <li>It does feel a little more like a sunscreen than a lotion (for instance Aveda&#x27;s feels more like a lotion, but I stopped theirs because I wasn&#x27;t sure of their ingredients, the tourmaline lotion).  </li>
      <li>I like this same day results product it has multi-purposes and is great for daily use for a healthy complexion.</li>
      <li>I like this sunscreen because it does not irritate, and it goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly without leaving me pasty white like most zinc/titanium sunscreen formulas.  </li>
      <li>this is my own personal opinion!!!</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is the most important characteristic for me.  </li>
      <li>I appreciate the lack of a strong perfume smell and natural ingredients.</li>
      <li>so I have to use a light moisturizer before applying this product for those out there who also have very sensitive skin and are on the fence .</li>
      <li>This is the first time I am using it.  </li>
      <li>is very liquid!</li>
      <li>That said, it goes on fairly smooth and un-chalky so perhaps if you&#x27;re not as sensitive, it will be for you.</li>
      <li>But, as far as i understand for john masters, the ingredients are more natural which is what I was looking for.  </li>
      <li>I have actually found the best SPF that&#x27;s all natural and does not feel sticky or too heavy on the skin.</li>
      <li>Not sure what happened, as I&#x27;ve used and loved this stuff before</li>
      <li>if you don&#x27;t like dewy, can easily put on a tiny bit of powder to get a matte look.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s by the Osmosis skincare line, if your interested and looking for an all natural alternative!!</li>
      <li>The sunscreen arrived really runny.</li>
      <li>No white residue, goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t block my pores.</li>
      <li>It seems to really soak into your skin and works longer.  </li>
      <li>It does leave a whiteish glow if I apply too much</li>
      <li>is all natural and smells great, but was just too sticky and felt like a very thick layer on my skin.</li>
      <li>I love that it&#x27;s natural, but it&#x27;s definitely like regular sunscreen-</li>
      <li>is it normal???</li>
      <li>I was looking a long time for a natural sunscreen, and as far as I could research this one has more natural (perhaps mineral or on the surface of skin opposed to working chemically within the skin) sunblock versus a chemical one (like Neutrogena as far as I have read).  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very sensitive to fragrances</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
      <li>or  too old.</li>
      <li>just how natural this is could help?).</li>
      <li>This provides SFP protection, moisture and it&#x27;s made with natural ingredients.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve completely revamped my cosmetics to all natural and organic</li>
      <li>so I had a concoction of clear oil and white paste.</li>
      <li>After Josie Maran discontinued her old formula of a similar sunscreen, I hunted for a mineral suncreen and moisturizer.</li>
      <li>After rubbing it in completely on my face and neck, there are no white streaks.</li>
      <li>Pretty typical sunscreen.</li>
      <li>Heavy and pretty greasy.</li>
      <li>This one is SPF 30, which is strong enough to keep me protected over a few hours, but doesn&#x27;t cause my eyes any trouble.</li>

<li> but I don&#x27;t mind that, it seems to be a good base to apply my makeup on.  </li>
<li> Goes on with a slight white hue, but saves you from burning and you need not apply this as often as regular 30 SPF sunscreen.  </li>
<li> However, because of the relatively low SPF, it is necessary to reapply every few hours if you are out in the sun for an extended period of time.</li>
<li> but I&#x27;ll keep buying it until I find something as good for less money, which is doubtful</li>
<li> Currently living in Indonesia and I need to wear sunscreen everyday.  </li>
<li> Thick and left white residue on my face.  </li>
<li> My skin visibly benefitted from the active ingredients, including hyaluronic acid and zinc.</li>
<li> it should last for at least 6 months</li>
<li> Thick white layer even hours after applying.  </li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin as usual sunscreens.</li>
<li> Only complaint is it is a little mineraly (looks like an opal or oyster shell) on my oily skin and skin tone.</li>
<li> leaves a little shine but gives a dewy look.  </li>
<li> It absorbs well and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy.  </li>
<li> Felt heavy and greasy on my combination skin.</li>
<li> I am ridiculously pale, and burn</li>
<li> You need very little to cover your face and it dose not clog pores.  </li>
<li> Meaning it is not light weight!</li>
<li> I have used this for the past 4 years.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s heavy and on the greasier side but does the Job!</li>
<li> When I first tried it, I was a bit disappointed.  </li>
<li> but it&#x27;s not for me; after 1 day of use I was broken out, as per usual with sunscreen.</li>
<li> and it&#x27;s not too thick or thin.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have been searching for a long time for face sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t make my dry, sensitive, rosacea- and eczema-prone skin break out. This is not it. People rave about it but it&#x27;s not for me; after 1 day of use I was broken out, as per usual with sunscreen. That said, it goes on fairly smooth and un-chalky so perhaps if you&#x27;re not as sensitive, it will be for you.</li>
    <li> I was looking a long time for a natural sunscreen, and as far as I could research this one has more natural (perhaps mineral or on the surface of skin opposed to working chemically within the skin) sunblock versus a chemical one (like Neutrogena as far as I have read).  John Masters is not too greasy, it wears well under makeup.  It does feel a little more like a sunscreen than a lotion (for instance Aveda&#x27;s feels more like a lotion, but I stopped theirs because I wasn&#x27;t sure of their ingredients, the tourmaline lotion).  But, as far as i understand for john masters, the ingredients are more natural which is what I was looking for.  I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars because I need more clarification on their ingredients...so it&#x27;s not the product, it&#x27;s my understanding of what is in the product (perhaps more marketing on just how natural this is could help?).</li>
    <li> its too watery. i don&#x27;t know if it is already been damaged. or  too old.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t break me out.</li>
    <li> Currently living in Indonesia and I need to wear sunscreen everyday.  This is perfect.  Its spreads well. You need very little to cover your face and it dose not clog pores.  Try it you will love it.</li>
    <li> I love how easily it glides on my skin and it&#x27;s not too thick or thin. It stays on for a long time. I have very sensitive skin so I have to use a light moisturizer before applying this product for those out there who also have very sensitive skin and are on the fence . This is so far the best sunscreen I have had. I definitely recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> I have to use mineral sunscreen because the chemical versions make me break out.  This one is really nice.  It absorbs well and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy.  No white residue.  I used it on my face/neck area while exercising outside and had no problems with it running in my eyes or anything like that.</li>
    <li> The sunscreen arrived really runny. Not sure what happened, as I&#x27;ve used and loved this stuff before and it was always thicker. Had to return.</li>
    <li> After Josie Maran discontinued her old formula of a similar sunscreen, I hunted for a mineral suncreen and moisturizer. This provides SFP protection, moisture and it&#x27;s made with natural ingredients. It does not leave a shiny film nor make me break out. After rubbing it in completely on my face and neck, there are no white streaks. I wear it alone or under makeup every day to protect my skin. I would definitely reorder when my bottle is empty.</li>
    <li> Thick and left white residue on my face.  Greasy feeling too.</li>
    <li> This is hands-down the best face sunscreen I have used. My skin visibly benefitted from the active ingredients, including hyaluronic acid and zinc. Plus the sun protection is great, and the texture and scent are perfect!</li>
    <li> I love this sunscreen. It is non-greasy and doesn&#x27;t break out my skin. I&#x27;ve completely revamped my cosmetics to all natural and organic so I was quite pleased to find this sunscreen. I will be purchasing again once I&#x27;m running low on my current bottle. However, because of the relatively low SPF, it is necessary to reapply every few hours if you are out in the sun for an extended period of time.</li>
    <li> I love this sunscreen because it is organic and does not irritate my skin. My skin has improved since using this product.</li>
    <li> invisible on fair to medium tan skin tones!  amazing ingredient list.  no scent.  leaves a little shine but gives a dewy look.  if you don&#x27;t like dewy, can easily put on a tiny bit of powder to get a matte look.  goes under make up easily.  no pilling or clumps.  love it.  best mineral sunscreen i&#x27;ve found for the face thus far.  still cant believe how invisible this is.  bottle and pump are great too!  you only need like 3-4 pumps to cover entire face generously.. it should last for at least 6 months I&#x27;m guessing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a thorough review with pictures of the actual product:  http://dritgirl.com/2015/07/29/beauty-invisible-mineral-sunscreen/</li>
    <li> This was expired by almost a year by the time I received it.</li>
    <li> I love it. Doesnt leave skin greasy and covers well with a smalm amount</li>
    <li> Thick white layer even hours after applying.  If you want to look like a ghost, this would be your choice.</li>
    <li> A big hit. No white residue, goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t block my pores. Because of the size and price, I recommend this as a head and neck only product.</li>
    <li> Everything as was promised. Good for my sensitive skin. It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin as usual sunscreens. It doesn&#x27;t leave the white residue after several hours. No problems with adjacent clothing.</li>
    <li> Goes on with a slight white hue, but saves you from burning and you need not apply this as often as regular 30 SPF sunscreen.  It seems to really soak into your skin and works longer.  Only complaint is it is a little mineraly (looks like an opal or oyster shell) on my oily skin and skin tone.</li>
    <li> John Products are wonderful. This is a great sunscreen. But is not a moisturizer. Meaning it is not light weight! It&#x27;s heavy and on the greasier side but does the Job!</li>
    <li> I used this formula every day while travelling in Africa for 7 weeks. It was non-greasy and it never made me break out. I have very fair skin and did not get a sunburn once.</li>
    <li> Definitely protects against the sun, but the ingredients in mine seemed to separate over time so I had a concoction of clear oil and white paste. If this hadn&#x27;t happened I would have given it 4 stars.</li>
    <li> Best organic, physical sunblock for the face. Emollient enough to become your daily moisturizer!  Just perfect.</li>
    <li> I like this sunscreen because it does not irritate, and it goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly without leaving me pasty white like most zinc/titanium sunscreen formulas.  The only issue I have with it is the packaging -- once you get towards the end, you just can&#x27;t get the rest of the product out.  It gets to be a struggle and in the end, I probably lose about 10-15% of the bottle every time.</li>
    <li> Pretty typical sunscreen. Felt heavy and greasy on my combination skin. I appreciate the lack of a strong perfume smell and natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I was looking for an alternative to the drugstore Spf&#x27;s that contain all kinds of chemicals!! Def. is all natural and smells great, but was just too sticky and felt like a very thick layer on my skin. Did not like it at all. I have actually found the best SPF that&#x27;s all natural and does not feel sticky or too heavy on the skin. It&#x27;s by the Osmosis skincare line, if your interested and looking for an all natural alternative!! &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;--------btw this is my own personal opinion!!!</li>
    <li> I was so excited when I found this sunscreen after reading the reviews. When I first tried it, I was a bit disappointed.  I love that it&#x27;s natural, but it&#x27;s definitely like regular sunscreen- Heavy and pretty greasy. That makes it a bit difficult to apply makeup on top.. which was part of the reason I bought it. Also (I&#x27;m african-american) when I applied it to my skin, it left me with a purple tint! You can hide it with concealer on your face, but there&#x27;s no hiding purple arms!! Granted, I don&#x27;t care about looking purple when I&#x27;m backpacking or relaxing on the beach, but it&#x27;s not a chic look during outings…</li>
    <li> I am ridiculously pale, and burn oh-so-easily. However, most commercial sunscreens over SPF15 have an ingredient in them that make my eyes water and difficult to keep open. This one is SPF 30, which is strong enough to keep me protected over a few hours, but doesn&#x27;t cause my eyes any trouble. Love it.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I am using it.  goes on the skin very smoothly .  Feels good.</li>
    <li> I like this same day results product it has multi-purposes and is great for daily use for a healthy complexion.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m outdoors every day and this sunscreen is luscious.  I use it as a daycreme under my makeup.  It does leave a whiteish glow if I apply too much but I don&#x27;t mind that, it seems to be a good base to apply my makeup on.  My 60ish skin is dry and this is a wonderful moisturizer.  If you have oily skin it may be too moisturizing for you.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very sensitive to fragrances and this has no scent at all and doesn&#x27;t affect my allergies.  It&#x27;s pricey but I&#x27;ll keep buying it until I find something as good for less money, which is doubtful these days.&lt;br /&gt;Oh yes, the ingredients are good for me and that is the most important thing I look for in personal products.</li>
    <li> When I bought this item, the summer is about to finish.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t use this item until satisfying with this item.&lt;br /&gt;I plan to use next season.</li>
    <li> bought as gift, no complaints</li>
    <li> This sunscreen works.  It feels good on the skin.  It can be used with makeup.  It lasts.  And, you will not burn.  Most importantly, and what does make is so very special is the lack of toxic materials to create the function you need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the most important characteristic for me.  The fact that it performs so well and works - and is organic - is what makes this incredibly special.  I have used this for the past 4 years.</li>
    <li> hey I bought it but i have a doubt! is very liquid! is it normal??? thank you!!</li>
