    <li> Perfect! Pump works everything was just as ordered!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this lotion. My husband was touching my legs and said &amp;#34;wow your skin is so soft! I love it&amp;#34; the smell is AMAZING. Not too strong and leaves my skin moisturizer after tanning until the next day! I am def buying again even when I&#x27;m not tanning!! Now go buy you some lol</li>
    <li> quickly delivered product works great smells great to thanks</li>
    <li> Started using this after I was loosing my tan to fast.  This seemed to help moisturize my skin and along with switching body washes I seem to stay tan longer.</li>

    <li> I love this lotion! It smells amazing and moisturizes well. Works great as a tan extender, much better than most. I just ordered my second bottle.</li>
    <li> This lotion smells amazing, and really keeps me moisturized.</li>
    <li> absolutely love this lotion. ive always used hemp lotion for everyday use and after tanning and i think this is my new fav! its thick and creamy and the smell is amazing!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!! It arrived quickly and individually wrapped in plastic. (I ordered 6 of them). It smells so good and makes my skin so soft.</li>
    <li> Really nice lotion and a great moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend.&lt;br /&gt;It smells good and feels really nice on my skin.</li>
    <li> Best moisturizing lotion I have used</li>
    <li> I really  like  this  lotion. I don&#x27;t  normally  use lotion due to the greased  feeling. But this is the perfect  after sun lotion.</li>
    <li> Love it?&lt;br /&gt;Will buy ,it again.</li>
    <li> LOVE this after-tanning lotion!  I bought it because it is paraben-free.  High quality product at decent price.  Also love the scent!!!  Would highly recommend this lotion!</li>
    <li> This is the most amazing lotion, I will use it as my daily moisturizer year around.</li>
    <li> I really love the smell of this lotion. It is a thicker lotion and it is slightly greasy but makes my skin so soft and people always say I smell good! Does not seem to extend my tan though.</li>
    <li> its really thick so I dilute it with a little coconut oil.  Smells heavenly and moisturizes well.</li>
    <li> Bottle was damanged and now I have to go through hassle of returning it.</li>
    <li> Quick to receive and smells yummy</li>
    <li> Have always used this lotion. Best stuff out there in my opinion.</li>
    <li> This smells amazing without being too overpowering and its creamy but easy to apply to your skin. I use it everyday (especially since I spray tan) and I love it. This bottle costs $22.00 at my tanning salon so I can&#x27;t believe I got it here for nearly half that.</li>
    <li> Attention !!!! This is A great product I purchased my first bottle at my Tanning Salon Then I, found I it cheaper on line @ Everything you want and more, May 20th was the estimated date, Then moved out to May 28th and today is June 18th and  I still do not have the product. USPS HAS NOT RECIVED IT, PLEASE READ COMMENTS ABOUT THIS COMPANY.AND TAKE CAUTION IF YOU ORDER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Initially tried this at the tanning salon for a much higher price. Wanted to make sure that I liked it since I do have sensitive skin. Love this lotion and the smell of it is very refreshing. It hydrates great and your skin feels vibrant after you have it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DId not receive the first order from the company that was shipped but company resent ordered items. Since then I have several friends that have ordered this lotion as well. Great lotion for the price.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle the best moisturizer I have ever used!!!</li>
    <li> I tried a pump or two of this stuff at my local tanning salon and immediately I loved the scent.  I tend to be sensitive to different scents and aromas, as they tend to make me nauseous and sick, but the Vanilla Pineapple is lightly and fantastically scented.  I agree that it is creamy, but light and kept my skin moisturized all day.  I definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a good moisturizer!</li>
    <li> Helps you keep you tan longer and moisturizes so you don&#x27;t get that lizard look on your skin.  The fragrance is also magnificent.  I am on my second bottle of the season.  Will probably use all year just as a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Good for after sunbathing and more.</li>
    <li> love this lotion.  It smells good and is very hydrating</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this lotion, and I find that it really does help extend my tan as well as help deal with the resulting dryness</li>
    <li> Best after tanning lotion ever 👍🏼</li>
    <li> The smell is heavenly and leaves skin soft.  It is the best moisturizer I have purchased.  The price is great!</li>
    <li> Excellent product with or without tanning!</li>
    <li> Love this Moisturizer!!</li>
    <li> This lotion smells AMAZING! I use this daily after I shower and my skin hasn&#x27;t felt or looked this good in a long time. It&#x27;s fairly heavy so it may be too much for some people. The pump on the one I received was loose when it arrived but wasn&#x27;t completely off, so there wasn&#x27;t any spillage but it&#x27;s something you&#x27;ll want to be careful of when removing it from the box.</li>
    <li> Great after tan lotion feels like a non-greasy butter on my skin WONDERFUL product!</li>
    <li> smells great and fast delivery!!!!</li>
    <li> Best lotion and it keeps my tan.  My skin is usually very dry and need multiple lotion applications throughout the day, but this stuff is incredibly rich but not heavy like some balms.  My skin thanks you!</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful, leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth!</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful! Leaves skin feeling so soft and amazing!</li>
    <li> Best after tan lotion!</li>
    <li> Love this lotion!  Smells so good and extends your tan!</li>
    <li> Great after-tan lotion, smells great</li>
    <li> The best all natural hemp lotion on the market</li>
    <li> The pump was broken and the spring to the pump was in side the lotion.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a great lotion and one that smells amazing this is it.  It is smooth, creamy but light.  It is  not greasy and really soaks in your skin.  This is the best smelling lotion I have ever used and you only have to apply it once and it stay smooth and hydrated all day.</li>
    <li> The product came quickly, and was exactly what I wanted.  Thank you for your help.  The only problem with the lotion itself is that it makes people feel sticky.</li>
    <li> It smells great, but I don&#x27;t think it extends my tan.</li>
    <li> I thing this is a very good value as it works well to keep my skin moisturized and retain any color I get as a result of my tanning efforts.</li>
    <li> great stuff I love it</li>
    <li> I do love the smell of this lotion! But, it&#x27;s a little too greasy for me and also a little too thick for my liking. I use it on my feet at bedtime because I like a thicker lotion for my feet.</li>
    <li> Just your average lotion.  Smells ok but I don&#x27;t notice any huge difference between this and any other lotion.  I do use it when I get out of the shower but I think anything would help.</li>
    <li> This smells amazing and it makes my skin feel great. Not greasy but very creamy it works well to hydrate the skin.</li>
    <li> Non greasy and a great moisturizer.  Smell is very pleasant but not overpowering.</li>
    <li> Love the scent, it&#x27;s not overpowering or overly fruity, goes on nicely, not greasy at all. Very moisturizing. Happy with this product !</li>
    <li> Love this. Smells great. Keeps my skin moisturized.</li>
    <li> I first bought this lotion for $35 at a tanning salon and I love it!  It&#x27;s thick and creamy and smells delicious!  It soaks into my skin without leaving a greasy residue behind. I used my first bottle in about 3 weeks and I needed more. I&#x27;m so glad I looked on Amazon because it saved me money and a trip to the tanning salon.</li>
    <li> Costs $6.50 for ONE use at the salon. $12 for an entire 16 oz bottle?? Can&#x27;t beat that. Best lotion for going cheap.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion and it&#x27;s cheaper on here than in the tanning salon.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. Stand by it 100%. Will buy buy buy :)</li>
    <li> Smells ok nothing special.</li>
    <li> I initially bought this at my tanning salon and fell in love with how it made my skin fell. My daughter has pretty bad eczema and we&#x27;ve tried everything! None of the creams or lotions did much for her. So I decided to put it on, because I loved how it made my skin feel. Her eczema cleared up in less than a week and she hasn&#x27;t had an outbreak in about a year! By far the best lotion we&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
