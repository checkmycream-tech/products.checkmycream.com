    <li> I bought these lip glosses for my little girl and she loves them.  I have searched for years and I do mean years to find these.  Most lip glosses may have a nice aroma but they taste awful.  These make my daughter&#x27;s lips soft (she&#x27;s on oxygen so chapped lips can be a problem) and she love the taste - anyone would love these!!!</li>
    <li> Really tastes like vanilla birthday cake, hard to keep it on your lips because it tastes so good.</li>
    <li> The fragrance and taste of this lip gloss is exactly as described. I also love the touch of irridescence that it has. It&#x27;s beautiful on. This lip gloss is also quite long lasting. It feels a little thicker and more emollient than other lip glosses I&#x27;ve tried; therefore, it does have staying power. I would definitely buy this again! Tastes so yummy, you will definitely like your lips!</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite lip shines from philosophy! It is a treat for your lips! It is the perfect gloss to compliment any makeup. It also helps condition your lips and leave them smoother. The consistency is smooth and not sticky. The lip shine is also incredibly long lasting. The scent is just like warm vanilla cupcakes right out of the oven! This is a must-have lip shine to have in your purse at all times!</li>
    <li> I am really picky about lip gloss. If it&#x27;s too sticky, I don&#x27;t like it because my hair gets stuck in it. If i&#x27;s not thick enough, you constantly have to re-apply. This stuff is the perfect medium. AND it smells and tastes great. I highly suggest this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been in love with this lip gloss for years now. One tube lasts me about two years and I use it at least once a day. I put this over other lipsticks and glosses for added shine. It also makes lipstick last longer and keeps lips moisturized. It is not overly sticky, more slick. You can really get a whiff of the vanilla when putting it on but it doesn&#x27;t last a long time. It has a sweet vanilla flavor too. I&#x27;m buying this again as I love it so much. It is especially glossy for the holidays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review</li>
    <li> Too sticky. Too expensive.  Nice smell. But definitely too gooey. I can find a ton of better lip gloss at other stores. I thought this would be something special for the price. But it is not</li>
    <li> Favorite lip gloss of all times hands down! A little on the sticky side but lasts forever!! Always getting compliments when I wear it &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Love, love, LOVE this gloss. It smells &amp; tastes fabulous and I&#x27;m already viewing other glosses for another purchase. It does have a thicker texture than most glosses, but it is long lasting and not too sticky. It leaves a clear w/ slight shimmer look that can be worn with or without makeup.

    <li> I bought this for a date. I find it to be VERY sticky and waxy, unlike the Cinnamon Buns gloss. And wouldn&#x27;t want to kiss anyone wearing this. Smells nice, tastes ok and does moisturize. Good for when you don&#x27;t plan on kissing or wearing your hair down. Oh, and the date worked out. ;-D</li>
    <li> Great product &amp; a great price!</li>
    <li> Yum! Vanilla Birthday Cake! You can&#x27;t go wrong with that!! This is a great product from Philosophy. Keeps my lips moist and smells divine!</li>
    <li> Very tasty and flavorful!  Looks great on the lips, not too much sparkle but is a bit thicker than anticipated in consistancy.</li>
    <li> Hi, I need to tell you guys something. I had about 4 or more of these lip glosses in various flavors... I loved them. I wore them all the time, loved the flavors, would lick my lips, loved the gloss, the shimmer, the tints. Here is what I don&#x27;t like... the chemicals and petroleum based materials in the ingredients. I got diagnosed with a type of sarcoma in the fall of 2011, and when I googled causes for my type of cancer, it said radiation, plastics, and environmental pollution. I&#x27;m not blaming this lip gloss alone, but I do have to say it was with a heavy heart I threw them all away. We have no idea what all of these ingredients are doing to our bodies. I was vegan and very healthy when I got diagnosed. Perhaps it was the water from plastic bottles I would leave in my car and drink when I was in high school and college in the late 80&#x27;s and 90&#x27;s, but I also think it is all the crap we put on our lips, our hair, our bodies. Please be aware of this when you buy this lip gloss... the flavor is not worth it. I wore them every day for several years.</li>
    <li> The fragrance and taste of this lip gloss is exactly as described.  I also love the touch of irridescence that it has.  It&#x27;s beautiful on.  This lip gloss is also quite long lasting.  It feels a little thicker and more emollient than other lip glosses I&#x27;ve tried; therefore, it does have staying power.  I would definitely buy this again!</li>
    <li> What an overpriced sticky mess! This product does smell wonderful and glides on smoothly, but makes my lips feel like they&#x27;re glued shut.  Also, if a piece of your hair lands on it - it will stay there!  Don&#x27;t waste $10 on this thick goo.</li>
    <li> yummy, shiny, sparkly, everything you want in a lip gloss. It doesn&#x27;t last forever but its good enough for me!</li>
    <li> vanilla birthday cake smells descent. However, it  doesn&#x27;t have too much of a taste. it looks very pretty on the lips and lasts for a while but it  is more of the thicker feeling lip gloss. it is over all an  average lip gloss.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my friend on her birthday. I thought it was a little pricey but it smells delicious and it stays on for a long time. I would definitely buy again</li>
    <li> I think that this lip gloss is great!!! But, it still has it&#x27;s pros and cons. It&#x27;s just a bit too sticky though, so its hard to spread it around your lips. And the flavor is a little weird because it tastes more like coconuts than cake. but its smells great and looks amazing on your lips! And since it&#x27;s so sticky. it stays on comfortably for a while. And it looks good night and day! Although it has its cons, yes, i would recommend this to a friend</li>
    <li> my boyfriend loooooves how this tastes and so do I !!!&lt;br /&gt; - - - - - - - - -</li>
    <li> I spent a lot on this and expected better from Philosophy. This gloss was runny and way too much glitter.  It&#x27;s frustrating that everything&#x27;s got glitter nowadays. Just wished it was better quality.</li>
    <li> I kept this one for myself since it was the first one that arrived.  It lasts so long, longer than any chapstick.  I&#x27;m glad I ordered this one!</li>
    <li> Purchased as a birthday gift &amp; now wish I had gotten one myself! My sister let me smell it &amp; OMG! Heavenly! Might have to treat myself for my birthday. :)</li>
    <li> I really love this lip gloss i will wear this for life. It is just the right amount of shine</li>
    <li> I thought with a title like vanilla birthday cake tht the gloss would taste really sweet but sadly it was not very sweet. It does have a flavor but it is not apparent. It is very subtle and is not really sweet the way I expected.</li>
    <li> Tacky, thick, gooey, yuck!</li>
    <li> This smells so good, just like vanilla birthday cake as advertised. I like the sparkle in it; it&#x27;s a little thick, but I like a thick lip gloss.  It tastes good too.  I use it alone or over lipstick.  It&#x27;s shimmery and shiny, so it will transfer to anything you touch with your lips, but it&#x27;s overall a great gloss.</li>
