      <li>Good luck.</li>
      <li>Arrived on time and in good shape, helps with breathing will not stop snoring.</li>
      <li>If you take a minute to try all the sizes out, you will find the perfect fit and the Nasivent will not fall out during the night.</li>
      <li>Even when they are in I don&#x27;t see where it does any good what-so-ever.  </li>
      <li>I suspected that a lack of good airflow with a resulting lack of oxygen was the culprit, so I bought this product to see if it would help.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve read good things about Max-Air but didn&#x27;t see them for sale on Amazon.</li>
      <li>are good when we cant buy the sleep apnea machine, but if you need the machine, go and get it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good that I&#x27;m sleeping</li>
      <li>It seems like a good concept, but id didnt work.  </li>
      <li>My spouse said it worked, I didn&#x27;t snore, and I slept as good as I ever did.</li>
      <li>I was very satisfied with the quality of this device.  </li>
      <li>up.&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with the product</li>
      <li>Right strips work the best.</li>
      <li>I am glad I did!</li>
      <li>As a result, my sleep quality is excellent now, for the first time in years.  </li>
      <li>There were five sizes, one fit me great.  </li>
      <li>it is amazing how it helps my breathing.  </li>
      <li>Thank you so much for your wonderful product.</li>
      <li>I use this product in combination with an oral appliance and, together, both have effectively solved my sleep apnea.  </li>
      <li>It stopped his snoring immediately but what was really nice for him is that when allergy season came the tubes kept him from waking up with a stuffy nose.</li>
      <li>but it sure has made a difference in my sleep in a good way.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried strips and for me they were about equally effective.  </li>
      <li>Each method has its own annoyances, so you choose.  </li>
      <li>absolutely thrilled with the results.</li>
      <li>and its nice to wake up with her.</li>
      <li>A Sharpie fine pen worked best for me, then I measured the diameter and picked the 2-piece single size package of the best size.  </li>
      <li>stars for good mouth fit.</li>
      <li>I find the sinus wash even MORE effective if I add 1 to 2 tablespoons (1/2 to 1 oz) of [[ASIN:B003YFG0M0 Alkalol]]</li>
      <li>The first night I couldn&#x27;t believe how great these worked.  </li>
      <li>I used the nasal strips and they worked better than this product.  </li>
      <li>The packaging probably costs more.  </li>
      <li>I think it would have worked better if it were tapered.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t wake up with a stuffy nose any more.</li>
      <li>A good nights sleep is worth a lot.</li>
      <li>I like NasaVent better because it opens my nose passage wider than the BreathRite stirps.</li>
      <li>I did start out with the smallest size but have since increased to something that fits better and as a result doesn&#x27;t come out while sleeping.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am breathing so much better at night</li>
      <li>I am sleeping better at night, my hearing is better, and my wife could sleep on our cruise.</li>
      <li>okay</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how many times I have slept on the living room couch.  </li>
      <li>If it doesn&#x27;t fit your nasal cavity, trim it to your own comfort.  </li>
      <li>now feel so much better throughout the day and am no longer falling asleep at work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but with some persistence he was able to tolerate the product for my sake.</li>
      <li>&amp; I am sleeping better, plus</li>
      <li>In addition, from the things I&#x27;ve read about a CPAP machine - I don&#x27;t think I would have enjoyed using one.&lt;br</li>
      <li>He is able to put these in at bed time, but now they fall out within minutes.</li>
      <li>Also got better results with a Breathe-right strip.</li>
      <li>Had much better results with a molded mouth piece.</li>
      <li>I think we both get a better night&#x27;s sleep.</li>
      <li>He has felt better and slept better since he started using them.</li>
      <li>And, I&#x27;m so glad.</li>
      <li>I purchased this item; I thought it would help, as I&#x27;ve tried a lot of devices, but this one is more bothersome than anything.  </li>
      <li>I wake up feeling much more rested.</li>
      <li>well, I&#x27;ve been suffering from sleep apnea for many years now.</li>
      <li>I am breathing much better when I sleep.</li>
      <li>I had much better luck with the nosovent.</li>
      <li>Rather, I always wake up rested whenever using this combination, and I in fact have found that I sleep better with this than with the CPAP,</li>
      <li>It has many sizes but none of them fits my nose, so I put it at night</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if my snoring is any better, but I can say FOR SURE</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve noticed that I&#x27;m breathing better through my nose and  sleeping longer through the night.</li>
      <li>but when they are in your nose you do get more air flow</li>
      <li>Thank you for such a wonderful breathing solution!!</li>
      <li>So I am sure once I fell asleep</li>
      <li>My wife is pleased and both of us are sleeping better.  </li>
      <li>Started breathing much better from the moment I used it.  </li>
      <li>I do better with breathe-right nasal strips.  </li>
      <li>Many people just won&#x27;t be able to sleep with any of these devices.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll keep looking for a better solution.</li>
      <li>More energy during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love this gadget.</li>
      <li>Okay, 5 stars for me too.</li>
      <li>He had so many sleepless nights because of lack of breathing.</li>
      <li>This one is  his favorite.</li>
      <li>, they gave it to me free of charge!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The device falls out consistently. I figured out my issue was food allergies. I&#x27;m not overweight. When I removed (in order of severity): soy, yeast, milk, gluten from my diet I have zero problems sleeping well.</li>
    <li> I liked the fact that there were different sizes and I could also cut it down to size, I&#x27;m a small woman. Also liked the fact it was a soft plastic, very comfortable. Only problem was when I woke up and it had come out of my nose several nights.</li>
    <li> Wow, was I surprised that this tiny silicon device could do so much.  I was skeptical and the first night I used it, my apprehension was dispelled.  I could not have asked for a more simple device that actually works.  It makes such a difference with comfortable sleeping and now I do not wake up congested each morning.  It is an inexpensive device that works.  I won&#x27;t say it will replace some things designed for sleep apnea but it sure has made a difference in my sleep in a good way.</li>
    <li> absolutely thrilled with the results. This thing really works. Anyone with a snoring problem needs to try it. Money well spent.</li>
    <li> I took these to a deployment to Afghanistan, hoping that it would allow me to deploy without a CPAP machine.  They were horrible, uncomfortable, and worst of all, ineffective. My CPAP has a pressure setting of SIX,.. which is pretty close to mid-point on the machine.  Don&#x27;t waste your money, if you have serious Sleep Apnea, this is not a replacement for CPAP therapy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boo, boo, hissss!  I would not buy again if I had the opportunity.  Threw them away after trying them for a full week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope you find my review helpful, best of luck shopping!</li>
    <li> Nasivent Product review:  I am a side-sleeper.  I have allergies and tend to get sinus infections.  I was having trouble breathing through my nose at night.  I&#x27;ve felt tired in the morning for years and would sometimes wake up during the night feeling like I couldn&#x27;t breathe through my nose.  I did wake up a couple times during the first two nights because it was strange to have something in the nose, but after two nights I no longer noticed it.  After the first night, I couldn&#x27;t believe how rested I felt in the morning.  Nasivent definitely helps open the airways more than when I don&#x27;t have it in.  Apparently I hadn&#x27;t been getting enough air during the night due to blocked nasal passages and sleep apnea.  When I started using this product, I felt more rested in the morning than I had in years.  Snoring reduction was only a side issue for me as my main concern was trouble breathing at night, but this product quieted down my snoring.  My wife says my snoring was reduced in frequency and volume, although not completely gone.  This product may be most helpful to reduce snoring for people who snore due to blocked or narrow nasal passages or congestion from allergies or sinus infection.  My Ear, Nose, Throat doctor said these are similar to what he calls &#x27;nose cones&#x27; which he said perform a similar function.  I know this particular product works well for me.    My Allergist also had me try Breathe Right external nasal strips, but after a couple weeks they caused a lot of irritation on the outside of my nose.  For me the Nasivent worked as well or better than the Breathe Right strips and the cost of nasal strips adds up quickly since they are not re-usable.  Helpful hint - push the tubes in your nose to a comfortable depth.  If there is still tube sticking out of your nose, you can trim off that amount from that section of tube.  This way the tube is flush with the outside of your nose, which makes wearing it MUCH more comfortable and makes it less likely you&#x27;ll knock itout during sleep.  I&#x27;ve found I can use 2 of the 4 sizes that came in the package, but I do need to trim them at different lengths as the wider size does not go in comfortably to the same depth.  If you have sinus congestion problems that are keeping you from sleeping at night, here are two other things that really helped me:  1) I use NeilMed sinus wash with their 8oz squeeze bottle twice per day to minimize congestion and to flush all of the yucky stuff out [[ASIN:B001HDRHR8 NeilMed Sinus Rinse]].  2) I find the sinus wash even MORE effective if I add 1 to 2 tablespoons (1/2 to 1 oz) of [[ASIN:B003YFG0M0 Alkalol]] to the 8oz [[ASIN:B001HDRHR8 NeilMed Sinus Rinse]] solution.  [[ASIN:B003YFG0M0 Alkalol]] will clear your sinuses like nobody&#x27;s business and has REALLY improved my sleep!  If you look at the Amazon product reviews for Alkolol, you will see it has VERY POSITIVE reviews.  If you like the [[ASIN:B003YFG0M0 Alkalol]] sinus wash, an inexpensive way to buy it is using Amazon&#x27;s \\&quot;subscription\\&quot; service which delivers it once per month with no shipping fee.  IMPORTANT - Nasivent mainly addresses the shape of your nasal passages and keeps your nasal passages open.  If you are having trouble breathing at night, please consider talking to your doctor about getting a sleep study.  It may be obstructive sleep apnea which may require a Continuous Positive Airway Pressure machine (CPAP) instead of, or in addition to, Nasivent.  Fixing your nose with Nasivent, Snorepin, BreatheRight strips or even sinus surgery (I tried them all) may only address a symptom, not the root cause.  I used Nasivent successfully for many months, then had sinus surgery, but eventually found I had a larger root cause which was severe obstructive sleep apnea and I needed to go on a CPAP machine.  If you can&#x27;t breathe at night, talk to an Ear Nose Throat, Pulmonary or Sleep Medicine specialist.  Not breathing at night is just dying in slow motion, it&#x27;s really not good for your body and can lead tomany heart and other issues.</li>
    <li> Since I am a nose snorer, nasal tubes were the wway to go. They fit easily into the nostrils and, according to my wife, significantly reduced my snoring. Over the course of four nights of sleep, the tubes did fall out once. However, they did the job.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if my snoring is any better, but I can say FOR SURE I am breathing much better when I sleep. I haven&#x27;t been able to sleep on my right side for the past 3 years due to a 75% deviated steptum, and this item has completely changed that. I am so thankful and will never sleep without these again! My only \\&quot;negative\\&quot; is the package includes 4 different sizes, and only smallest one fits in my nose comfortably... it&#x27;s a shame to have to pay for 3 other sizes that don&#x27;t work at all for me. But in general, I highly, highly, highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Nasivent Tube foe three months now and it works for me. My wife is pleased and both of us are sleeping better, and uninterrupted. It is easy to use and not uncomfortable. I would strongly advise anyone with snoring problems to try this product.</li>
    <li> I was recently traveling with my sister and we were sharing a hotel room.  She usually snores heavily, and I end up having to sleep with ear plugs.  But this time, she had a Nasivent with her and it dramatically decreased her snoring.  I didn&#x27;t even need to wear my ear plugs!  If you or your loved ones snore, I would recommend trying this product.</li>
    <li> I hope it would work for me, but it is totally not helpful, and my girlfriend said my nose make very strange sound, so she cannot sleep at all.</li>
    <li> This product is not worth the money. It ends up being $25.00 for one small appliance.  In the description it says there is four pcs but not that there are four different sizes so you end up getting one. They need a size chart of some kind to determine the proper size for you. If you received four pcs of the same size it might be worth it.   It also has to be replaced a few times a year.  The one I had started falling out after one week, good luck finding it in the middle of the night in the dark. There is no way for your nose to filter out dust particles with this product, it&#x27;s a straight shot to your lungs, probably not a good thing. I did return this product and will return to using breathe right strips the price will work out the same per year if you have to replace this product over and over.</li>
    <li> My package arrived on Saturday and seeing as I work second shift then I decided to wait another night before trying it.  So I used it for the first time last night followed directions and was told this morning that it was so quiet it was scary last night.  I actually woke up feeling very refreshed after the best nights sleep I had in a very long time.  So I am very happy with this product because to be honest I have tried the strips and other things in the past, I now look forward to a good many nights restful sleep for all.  For information I have sleep apena</li>
    <li> This product does not work. Do not waste your money. It was very uncomfortable, but I still wore it. In the middle of the night, I woke up because I couldn&#x27;t breathe. Isn&#x27;t this product suppose to help you breathe? The plastic tubes closed up my airway and i found myself breathing through my mouth. I slept worse with that thing in my nose. Do not buy this product!</li>
    <li> Far from dilating my nose, this just felt like my nose was so stuffed that I couldn&#x27;t breathe through it, even when I used the smallest size and cut the ends off so it would fit better.</li>
    <li> This Nasivent anti-snoring aid is incredible. My husband loves it.  Suddenly he is not waking up to my snoring.  It fits lightly into the nose and doesn&#x27;t fall out.  I have tried other devices, and this is the only one that works.  Since I often go to retreats where I have to sleep in the same room with a group of people, it is a lifesaver (sleepsaver) for all those who formerly had to stay awake listening to me all night.</li>
    <li> My Dad saw this and suggested my partner and I try this as we both snore. Because there were 4 sizes in the pack we each found one that worked and it really helps. I think we both get a better night&#x27;s sleep. I recommend everyone try this for snoring.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical about any product that can cure snoring, but not anymore--this product works! My wife and I had gotten used to waking up in separate beds as I would leave when awakened by her snoring. It&#x27;s comfortable, high quality and fits well. In fact, we both use them. With 4 sizes in a package, one fits me and the smaller one works for my wife. Now we&#x27;re both happy and sleeping well--together.</li>
    <li> I have tried several similar products and this is one of the least comfortable.  It only slightly helps breathing, and was uncomfortable.  To me, the fact that you are adding a tube to your nose means that the nostrils have to be that much wider in order for it work.  It also didn&#x27;t seem to go in far enough to be effective.  I believe it is over priced as it is only three sizes of rubber tubing with a notch cut out of it.  I had much better luck with the nosovent.</li>
    <li> The fact that there are multiple sizes and that it&#x27;s made out of surgical silicone is great. It&#x27;s soft and it includes a little storage case that lets you put the size tube that you chose into so that you can store it and the silicone won&#x27;t get dirty, but all four of them won&#x27;t fit in the case together.    My problem with the nasal airway opener is that it falls out. I wake up in the morning and I have to find it in the sheets. It&#x27;s good that I&#x27;m sleeping and I don&#x27;t have anyone to be waking up, but it hasn&#x27;t stopped me from snoring and i&#x27;m still not getting enough air when i sleep. Perhaps one could try a larger size, but I cannot. And that&#x27;s due to the nature of my nasal difficulties. I have a deviated septum from a broken nose years ago and a larger size agravates the very thin skin and causes nose bleeds. Mind you, i get these anyway and in no way shape or form would i say this product will cause your nose to bleed, but since my nose often bleeds anyway, this product was sadly not an ideal fit.    I have yet to successfully try other products, but i hope this information is helpful to you.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t help my snoring at all.  They are also over-priced at $24.94 in my opinion as they are nothing but flexible little plastic tubes.  The tubes fit in my nose fine, but I could feel that they were there which was uncomfortable.  My partner also told me that my snoring was actually worse the one night I wore them.  I do better with breathe-right nasal strips.  They aren&#x27;t perfect, but I do snore much less when I wear them. I&#x27;ll keep looking for a better solution.</li>
    <li> The first time I tried this it worked. The device is comfortable and did not keep me awake. It was difficult for me to realize that I do snore, but now all my family members can rest peacefully!</li>
    <li> Okay, 5 stars for me too. I&#x27;ve used these for 2 weeks straight and know I won&#x27;t be able to sleep without them. I had nostril surgery 4 years ago to rebuild the walls for support and the right one is closing again. I found this on Amazon and although it&#x27;s pretty pricey, if it works like for me, it&#x27;s worth it. If you feel yourself forcing to breath then either the size is too large or you&#x27;ve placed them inside the nostril too deeply. Don&#x27;t worry about if they hang out, they don&#x27;t fall out (for me anyway). Thanx to all who took the time to write a review and give suggestions.</li>
    <li> While most people it seems give this product a pretty good review, I didn&#x27;t find it to work at all really. I bought it for my girlfriend and the first night we found one that fit her. She isn&#x27;t even really a \\&quot;heavy\\&quot; snorer, but that night it was as if nothing had changed. Still snoring. Not to mention, it feels strange when you stick anything up your nose (I tried one too). I think I&#x27;ll just stick to the breathe strips from here on out.</li>
    <li> I have been the perpetrator of nasal snoring (as opposed to throat snoring) for many years. (sorry, dear wife!)  I have tried a great number of interventions - some of which do not apply because it is dependent on my sleeping position, some of which did not work for a variety of reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most common devices to keep the nasal passages open are the strips that adhere to the outside of the nose:  great if they have enough force to do their job and enough adhesive to keep them there.  Not so great with that sticky remnant every morning unless they have already peeled off overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some in-the-nose devices have worked better to keep the nasal passages open, but they were far from comfortable.  Anything with sufficient clamp to hang onto your septum overnight is going to be annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, when I saw Nasivent I thought I would give it a try.  Made from surgical grade silicone tubing, the four sizes provided will surely include one that fits your nose. I found that two worked well with me.  The beauty of this system is that the tubing cannot collapse and within moments of insertion is almost impossible to notice.  (I have, on occasion, gone to scratch my nose after I have inserted the tubing and am reading before sleep and startled myself to feel the Nasivent there - had forgotten it was in already.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results?  Much better, uninterrupted sleep!  Welcome back in with my sweetie.  More energy during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it is so simple and almost invisible to the casual observer - had an overnight in coach on the AutoTrain recently and no one seemed to notice I had my Nasivent in but I do know that I got 8 hours of great sleep and when asked no one around me had heard any snoring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have exhausted all the other \\&quot;remedies\\&quot; and are still exhausted after a night&#x27;s sleep interrupted by too many snorts, try the Nasivent.</li>
    <li> I bought these things on the hope that I would not keep my husband awake with my very loud snoring. Well, (sigh) I snored loudly before, and I snore loudly with them. On the plus side, my husband calls them my nose straws, and that makes me laugh. Oh well!</li>
    <li> Very useful and comfortable.  I have a very large nose so I cut off the strip that holds the two nozzles together and can now insert each one separately and more deeply into nostrils without any risk of falling/pulling out.  Cut apart and try this way if you have problems.</li>
    <li> I put the largest one these \\&quot;straws\\&quot; up my nose.  It merely obstructs the airflow into my nostrils, because now there&#x27;s a straw upon my nose and the straw has relatively thick walls.    I&#x27;m glad it worked for some people, but I&#x27;ve never had a problem with my nostrils closing while sleeping or being too small for air flow.    The description also says that \\&quot;in three quarters (3/4) of all cases, Snoring and Sleep Apnea is caused by the entrance to the nose being blocked or too narrow.\\&quot;  Really?  I&#x27;ve read that in most cases, snoring and sleep apnea is caused by the pallete (in the back of your throat) collapsing.      If you have used Breathe Right Strips, and they worked for you, this device may work.  Otherwise, don&#x27;t waste your money.  I wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted mine.</li>
    <li> I had been trying to solve my snoring problem for a few years when I tried these.  Because I suffer from allergies, and seem to have issues with getting enough air through my nose, I thought this product might really work well. (I had tried Breathe Rights with only very minimal success and a lot of irritation on the bridge of my nose.) My first reaction when I inserted these nasal \\&quot;vents\\&quot; was surprise at how much more air I seemed to get immediately.  I did have to mix and match the sizes because my nostrils are differently sized enough to need that, but I just cut the middle of two pairs and put the different sizes together.  I left a little tag of the connecting strip so I could pull out each one in the morning. There is really no worry of them slipping up inside your nose at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did breathe better, but the snoring did not abate completely.  Often the snoring was just as loud.  After a few weeks, I also started having some irritation inside the rim of my nostril.  I had to put a little ointment on just to be able to put them in at night.  If I took a break for a few days, the irritation went away.  I really appreciated the big breathes of air I could take through my nose, but overall the point was to eliminate snoring and that didn&#x27;t happen.  I would use this product occasionally if I am stuffy from allergies, but not to stop snoring.</li>
    <li> The Nasivent Tube works for me.  My wife is pleased and both of us are sleeping better.  It is easy to use and not uncomfortable.  I would strongly advise anyhone with snoring problems to give it a try.</li>
    <li> These Nasivent Tubes, really work.  I used to buy the nose strips to help my nasal passages stay open when I go to bed.  Being an Apnea sufferer, you have to do what ever it takes to keep your nasal passages open and clear.  Each morning, I had to peel off the nose srips and take skin with them.  These nasal strips are costly and you can only use one a night.  I found Nasivent Tubes on line (Amazon), and decided to try them.  You get 4 tubes of different sizes, of which one should match your nose.  Tried it the first night and it kept my nasal passages open all night long.  It is reusable (just wash clean in the morning), and you can use again next night.  It helps keep my snoring down and I don&#x27;t have to rip skin off anymore.  The tube is made of a soft rubber material that is not damaging to the inner nose passage.  The tubes are connected, so it prevents them from going any further then a few milimeters, just enough to open nose passages.  They work.</li>
    <li> I bought this product last year and love it. I use the smallest size dilator in the package. It is a bit pricey, in my opinion, but worth it because I can now breathe at night. My problem is that my nasal passage is very narrow. And when my allergies act up, I can&#x27;t get any air through my nose. It is usually only a problem at night. Now when I&#x27;m stuffy, I just use the dilator and I can breathe. It doesn&#x27;t fall out of my nose and in the morning I just take it out and wash it with warm water and soap and let it air dry. I&#x27;ve tried a few other products and found that I couldn&#x27;t wear them because they hurt my nose. This product is very gentle but gets the job done. I&#x27;ve recommended it to several of my friends.</li>
    <li> I have a deviated septum and enlarged turbinates (perennial rhinitis), so breathing through my nose has always been a challenge and I was diagnosed with sleep apnea several years ago. CPAP was a non-starter for me, far too uncomfortable, as I needed the full face mask. I tried some similar products along the same line as the Nasivent that appeared a little less intrusive, but they either weren&#x27;t strong enough to enlarge my nasal passages, or would just fall out at night. At first Nasivent was a little uncomfortable for me, but after a few days I got used to it and have to say it&#x27;s been quite a revelation. Really helps to keep the nasal passages open and having two equal tubes on either side straightens out your septum quite effectively. Have definitely been feeling less tired since I started using them. Won&#x27;t try and claim it&#x27;s totally cured my sleep apnea, as I&#x27;d need to retake the sleep test with them in to say that (no thanks!), but it&#x27;s a definite improvement - and a solution I can live with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note. I&#x27;ve never written a review before and probably never will again, but the customer service I received from their US distributor when I had a few questions was simply first class. Quality product &amp; company.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend&#x27;s nostrils restrict his breathing during sleep, so he uses the nasal strips and they help a bit, but he still wakes up feeling tired.  Lots of devices are available to stick up your nose to prop open the nostrils.  We started with the one that was more expensive (25) in hopes that it was best, but it pulls out early.  We each put one up our noses, it pulled out early in sleep, and my boyfriend and I were left feeling unsatisfied.  We&#x27;ll try sticking other things up our noses.  Not beans.</li>
    <li> What a relief!  After my husband and I would fall asleep, the snoring started.   We had heard about asivent and decided to try it.  What a difference!  No more snoring and a full night of restful sleep.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Sorry to say, this item did not live up to it&#x27;s promises.  It did not stay in my nose, and my pillow does not have sleep apnea!  Also expensive for what it is.</li>
    <li> It worked great.  There were five sizes, one fit me great.  I gave the others to other people.  They loved the same way, I did.  All of them laughed after looking at the product, concept, but were impressed after the good night sleep. All I have to say, great product and great idea.  P.S. trim based upon your need.</li>
    <li> When they stay in place, they allow for clearer breathing, but after frequent use, they irritate the delicate lining of the nose. For this reason, we cannot use them any longer. They require regular cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Addendum: Turns out Breathe Right strips work the best.</li>
    <li> Like everyone else, I snore so I&#x27;ll spare you the details of how bad that is for you and your spouse.  These were a \\&quot;honey, just try them please\\&quot; sort of thing.  I have been using them for about a week now and other than the minor inconvenience of sometimes having them fall out at night (and they are clear meaning GOOD LUCK trying to find them in your bedcovers when that happens)they really do seem to work!  My wife has said I still snore slightly, but the sound is just a low rumble now as opposed to the ear-shattering noise everyone in the family is accustomed to hearing.  I may still need professional help for sleep apnea but for now, good little remedy.</li>
    <li> I suppose this would work but in my sleep I kept pulling them out without realizing it.  It&#x27;s very uncomfortable.  Only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 1 star is because while I had it in my nose, it seemed to work.</li>
    <li> Having read so many good reviews of this product, I tried it out, hoping for similar results. Unfortunately, while the idea is good, these tubes fall out of my nose about two hours after falling asleep. None of the sizes will stay put. All in all, a disappointing experience.</li>
    <li> The tubes weren&#x27;t as uncomfortable as I expected, and they do help you breathe clearly through your nose, much like a Breathe-Rite strip. I had no trouble keeping them in all night, and they were still comfortable in the morning.    But when I tried these on a camping trip, my whole group was still infuriated with me in the morning.  Apparently my snoring still wakes the dead even when the tube is properly in place.    My advice:  try a cheap breath-rite strip from the drug store first.  These are more durable and somewhat more effective than a Breathe-Rite strip, so if the strips work for you, this might be a better long term solution.  But if Breathe-Rite strips don&#x27;t work for you, I wouldn&#x27;t expect these to work either.</li>
    <li> Just got them yesterday, last night was my first, really works, will custom to fit better and stay in.(fell out once)...BUT, pricey for just one, the largest-XL, would gladly mail my small, medium or large for someones XL? [....] (subject line) Nose Swap</li>
    <li> After years of sleep apnea and dry mouth from swollen nasal passages, I&#x27;ve been using this pair of comfortble little tubes for a few months now. They really work. Some of the other reviews mention that they fall out. The solution I found was to trim them (as the instructions suggest) short enough to insert past the edge of your nostrils. They do not have to fill your entire nostril in order to keep it open. Cut off a little at a time until they are secure and comfey. They come in 4 sizes. Use the largest one you can fit in. They are so soft and pliable you will probably get used to them in no time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried a couple of the other kinds but they were very uncomfortable. Sweet dreams!</li>
    <li> I bought the Nasivent Tube for my boyfriend in March of 2010. It stopped his snoring immediately but what was really nice for him is that when allergy season came the tubes kept him from waking up with a stuffy nose. He has felt better and slept better since he started using them. I know it doesn&#x27;t work for everyone but it really worked for him.</li>
    <li> The antiSnoring is a useful device,constructed in soft silicone ,easy to use and the most important is that really reduce apnea periods.</li>
    <li> I can only claim temporary buyers insanity when I clicked that oh-so-tempting one-click button to buy this product.  I was sleep deprived too, my husband snores so loud that our son sometimes shuts his bedroom door to block the sound (it doesn&#x27;t block it out entirely, you can still hear my cudddly sleeping giant snorting and grumbling away, but at a slightly dulled volume).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve ever lived with a snorer, you know the cruel torture of sitting up in bed, night after night, twitching and pulling at blankets and pillows in silent, exhausted accusation as the person next to you sleeps soundly if not silently next to you.  For a couple of years my husband didn&#x27;t even think he snored (I recorded him on his phone!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried noise canceling machines, making him sleep on a mound of pillows (my thought was that he was congested, he slid down off the pillows and partly under them, I had to rescue him from smothering!) he bought a chin strap device for snoring, tried sleeping in the living room in the recliner (he was awake most of the night and in spite of his loudness, I got lonely in the big bed by myself) and so far, the only product that helps with his snoring is the one I bought for myself, noise blocking Laser Lite brand ear plugs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since these nostril dilators are made of a soft silicone, if you are someone who sleeps with your face mashed into a pillow, the dilators would do next to nothing to keep your breathing passages open, they&#x27;d mash inwards, just like the soft tissues of your nose.</li>
    <li> I have a deviated septum so when I read about this product I was curious.  I was also skeptical as I&#x27;ve tried breath right strips but they didn&#x27;t work.  My wife thought I was nuts when she saw that I bought this.  After a few nights using this product my wife noticed a dramatic decrease in my snoring, so that part works.  I noticed that I can breath much easier when going to sleep, so that works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of observations...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It took a couple nights to get use to the product.  Not because there was discomfort but simply because it&#x27;s weird having something up your nostrils.  That has since subsided and I don&#x27;t even notice anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I did start out with the smallest size but have since increased to something that fits better and as a result doesn&#x27;t come out while sleeping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I was surprised that when you insert into nostril it doesn&#x27;t hurt or have any discomfort.  Besides being able to feel something in there you really is quite painless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The first day I actually used it while watching TV on the couch.  I wanted to test it and I think it allowed me to get use to it faster.</li>
    <li> I have a deviated septum and am told I snore a lot.  This sleep aid includes four different sizes of nose dilators.  Two of them fit me well.  They are very soft and comfortable.  The first week I used this, I woke every morning to find the dilator gone ... under my pillow, on the other side of the bed, or even on the floor.  I realized I was pulling the thing out as I slept.  But, I kept going and by the second week, the dilator was staying in.  It does work, in that it opens the nasal passages.  I don&#x27;t know yet if I&#x27;m snoring less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dilators come with a small plastic case that can hold one dilator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one down side is that it&#x27;s pricey.  I appreciated getting free shipping.</li>
    <li> tried it  even though it is pretty soft material   it kept irritating my nose and i felt it was in there even after a day of not using it.  Did not do anything for me. at 25$  way overpriced.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;I suffer from allergies and lately my snoring has kept me (and my \\&quot;other\\&quot;) from a good nights sleep and not feeling rested when I wake up.  I tried this product at the suggestion of a friend and now I&#x27;m not sure who&#x27;s more pleased with the results, me or my other.  You gotta trim it first, but then it fits comfortably in your nose, and now I/we sleep better and wake up feeling rested for the first time in a long time.  I totally recommend this product to anyone who snores.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> So for years(as it turns out) I have been sleeping poorly and waking up frequently. It has been getting slowly worse over the last 10 years and finally I figured out that my poor condition during the day was caused by interrupted sleep at night.&lt;br /&gt;So the NasiVent product works simply by allowing more air to pass through the nose at night and in my case allows me to get back to deep sleep without constantly waking up.&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with the product and I use the largest size which gives the maximum opening of the nose.&lt;br /&gt;Its very easy to cut down the length of the insert by using scissors.&lt;br /&gt;Somebody said once that you could not put a price on a good nights sleep.&lt;br /&gt;For me NasiVent has allowed me to return to my 40s rather than feeling the 60 years old that i am!!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend people to try the product.</li>
    <li> I try two different sizes and they do not work at all for me, I have better results using the Nasal Rinse I got at Walmart.</li>
    <li> I bought this item thinking it would probably not work.  It did work, controlling my sleep Apnia.  Doctor wanted to put  me overnight in hospital to find as solution.  Don&#x27;t know is will work for everybody.  Speaking  only for myself.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 6 weeks &amp; I am sleeping better, plus I don&#x27;t wake up with a stuffy nose any more.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t too excited to put something in my nose but I got use to right away. It definitely makes a difference. I am having to learn to breath through my nose again but it&#x27;s happening.</li>
    <li> I was very satisfied with the quality of this device.  It is made to hold the soft part of the nose open, however my problem is up higher in the nose so it was not helpful for my particular problem. I can see it being very helpful for other people.</li>
    <li> This product has been very helpful in allowing me to breathe through my nose at night.  I was using Breathe Right strips but they didn&#x27;t do the job much of the time.  There are four sizes provided and I found the one that worked the best.  It is not irritating and works well.  Will purchase again when it needs replacement.  I used this product in association with the Snore Eliminator Anti Snoring Mouthpiece.  I am sleeping better at night, my hearing is better, and my wife could sleep on our cruise. [[ASIN:B004U2818M Snore Eliminator Anti Snoring Mouthpiece Sleep Solution]]</li>
    <li> Made no difference what so ever! My bf put it in, and it was very uncomfortable but he said he would try it. I still ended up sleeping on the couch.</li>
    <li> I Inserted The Smallest Tube It Hurt In My Nose I Tryed To Not Insert It Too Far Made My Nose Sore</li>
    <li> First, 25 bucks for four five cent pieces of tubing? I can&#x27;t believe it. Second, these things do work to some extent, but the size big enough to help my breathing shortly ends up irritating the skin inside my nostril, and the smaller sizes fall out. I think there is some sound theory to holding the nasal passage open, and I will keep looking for solutions. This one doesn&#x27;t do it for me.</li>
    <li> I have had trouble with snoring for several years now and keep my husband awake half the night.  I don&#x27;t know how many times I have slept on the living room couch.  The doctor told me my snoring was caused by post nasal drip, so I was a little skeptic that NasiVent would really help.  But I have worn it for several weeks now and it is amazing how it helps my breathing.  I thought it would be so uncomfortable to have something in my nose but was truly surprised how comfortable it was - I hardly knew it was there.  I thank you and my husband thanks you!</li>
    <li> So far (one week), I&#x27;m liking this product.  Not too uncomfortable - actually don&#x27;t notice it after ten minutes.  Seems to do the job - cust down on snoring for me.    Gave it 4 stars because of the price.  I only need the large size and $25 is a lot for a small piece of tubing.    Anyone know if you can order more of one size at a more reasonable price?  Maybe direct from the manufacturer?</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband who has difficulty breathing through his nose when sleeping (especially when laying on his back). Naturally I want to stay married and get some sleep so I went on a hunt for a solution. All of the reviews on Amazon were promising and the company&#x27;s guarantee made me think, it couldn&#x27;t hurt to give the Nasivent Tube a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At times the product completely eliminated his snoring and at others it seemed to at least make it sound less like a chainsaw and more like a strong wind. Initially he found the product to be quite uncomfortable and he wasn&#x27;t the friendliest person when I asked how he liked it but with some persistence he was able to tolerate the product for my sake. That said there are two major flaws in this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Problem #1: At some point in the middle of the night it would either fall out or he would unknowingly remove the device (more likely the case). At this point, his snoring would resume and I would wake up groggy and annoyed. This isn&#x27;t necessarily the product&#x27;s fault, I for example can&#x27;t seem to keep earplugs in through the night because I always wake-up at some point and remove the foreign object in my ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Problem #2: The product is both small and clear so locating a device removed by someone in the middle of the night is more challenging than it should be. Heck, locating it in the morning was still a challenge and eventually it was lost. So the end result is that my husband still snores, I still have trouble sleeping, and we don&#x27;t have a physical product to return for our money back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d recommend giving the product a shot but if you think there is a chance the device will be removed in a half-sleep state find a way to color it so you can easily locate it.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my husband. They actually work. My husband was so quiet during the night, I had to poke him numerous times to see if he was still breathing because I didn&#x27;t hear snoring. If you take a minute to try all the sizes out, you will find the perfect fit and the Nasivent will not fall out during the night. These work so well I wish they sold them in four packs of each size. Will definitely be buying again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: these worked for only a short period. My husband has allergies and his nose can be runny often. He is able to put these in at bed time, but now they fall out within minutes. Unless his nose is completely dry, they do not stay in and do not work. Save your money.</li>
    <li> I have been using this nasivent tube for several weeks now and have enjoyed good results from it.  Too little airflow through my right nostril is a key problem for me, so I surmise this product would be quite helpful for people with deviated septums.  The Nasivent tube has fallen out of my nose a couple times while asleep, but this is not due to poor product quality, but rather my abnormal nasal anatomy that makes fitting the tube into my right nostril a bit tricky (I have implanted alloderm tissue on my right lateral wall that compensates for a removed inferior turbinate, and the tube bumps into that).  If my nose was normal, it would probably fit snug, as it does in my left nostril.  The silicone material is quite comfortable and, as soon as I place it in my nose, I can sense the air I am inhaling significantly better.  It&#x27;s like air whips right into my nose.     I use this product in combination with an oral appliance and, together, both have effectively solved my sleep apnea.  As a result, my sleep quality is excellent now, for the first time in years.  No more guessing on whether I will wake up feeling restful or tired.  Rather, I always wake up rested whenever using this combination, and I in fact have found that I sleep better with this than with the CPAP, the latter of which can be noisy and takes much more maintenance.  No more CPAP for me!      I highly recommend the nasivent tube.</li>
    <li> My husband an I hadn&#x27;t slept in the same room for several years because of his snoring.  We had tried other products (including the chin strap - don&#x27;t buy it, it doesn&#x27;t work!) but nothing ever worked. The first few nights, he still slept in a different room and I would go in periodically during the night to see if he was snoring.  I heard nothing.  He is now back in our bed and he loves it and so do I.  Once in a while, he does begin to snore a little bit, but nothing like he used to and it only lasts a few minutes.  Worth the money!  Hope it works forever.</li>
    <li> My motivation for trying this product was to reduce my use of decongestant at night.  For that purpose, if my congestion is mild, this product helps a little and I may not wake up with mouth breathing symptoms.  But past a certain level, I pull it out and spray.  I&#x27;ve tried strips and for me they were about equally effective.  Each method has its own annoyances, so you choose.  The tubing is soft and seems to be made from \\&quot;White Translucent Medical Grade Silicone Tubing\\&quot; available on Amazon in lengths. But the softness of the tubing is important so that it is comfortable and doesn&#x27;t press hard against your nose if you turn in your sleep.  I did not get the multi-size kit.  Instead, I (um) gently inserted rounded marker pen ends up my nose to gauge a suitable balance between snugness and comfort.  A Sharpie fine pen worked best for me, then I measured the diameter and picked the 2-piece single size package of the best size.  The result was that I got a reasonably comfortable fit and it does not fall out at night.  And I got two pieces that fit instead of 1 fitting piece plus 3 non-fitting pieces.  Sure, all you get is some cut tubes for your money, but it is medical grade tubing with a precise cut, so there is cost in the production if not the materials.  I tried to make a mark on the tubing so I could find it easier, but even &#x27;permanent&#x27; marker would easily rub off. So what I did instead was to cut a strip of black electrical tape (about 1\\&quot; x 1/4\\&quot;) and wrapped it around the center so that the tape overlaps about a turn.</li>
    <li> This item is for people with narrow nasal passages and/or nostrils or whose nasal passages and/or nostrils tend to constrict under heavy breathing. I suspect most of the negative reviewers have different breathing issues. If Breathright strips provide some benefit for you, this will likely work even better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easier to apply and in the long run cheaper than Breathright strips since they are not disposable. Also has the added benefit of holding the nostrils open which Breathright strips don&#x27;t do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I have medium sized nostrils, but I use the largest size tube (although the second largest size is slightly more comfortable, I get more air in through the largest), which means they likely would be too small if you have big nostrils. However, as I said above, if you have large nostrils you likely wouldn&#x27;t benefit from this product anyway.</li>
    <li> The first night I tried the device I woke up several times with clogged nostrils.&lt;br /&gt;It did not work for me.  Was able to get a quick refund through Amazon.</li>
    <li> This product it is not a bad idea, If you have snoring problems you should tried. It works for me.</li>
    <li> Nasivent did come in four different sizes and it was flexible, but I found it to be uncomfortable if I used the larger size and with the size that felt OK it fell out during the night.</li>
    <li> This product really does work if you can sleep on your side which allows your tongue to not relax. If you read the directions you will see that you are suppose to trim them to fit your nose. This helps the Nasivent to stay in your nostrils. It still sometimes falls out which is the only issue with the device. Its not perfect but if used correctly its a great device and is less expensive over time than breathe right strips.</li>
    <li> I feel like I was taken for 24.99. This \\&quot;product\\&quot; gave me no relief and should have cost me .10 cents. Yes, I said TEN CENTS.</li>
    <li> Have to say i tried a lot of products before getting this one. This works as promised. The very first night I used it, I could immediately tell the difference. I could breath easier and slept like a baby. I felt extremely refreshed the next morning, something I haven&#x27;t felt in over 5 years. Cant say enough good things about this product. TIP: make sure you put in an hour before going to sleep so your body can adjust to having a foreign object in your nose while you sleep.</li>
    <li> These are awful.  I&#x27;m amazed that anyone could give these a good review.  I&#x27;m a woman w/a pretty average nose but these do not work at all (not any of the sizes).  They are round, not oval shaped so I&#x27;m not sure how they&#x27;re supposed to fit snugly.  They are also way too long so part of it sticks out of the nostril.  I tried trimming one, but it still doesn&#x27;t fit right.  Once in the nose it provides no benefit whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing good I can say about them is that the material they&#x27;re made with is soft and flexible.  So I can see how, if they actually fit right, they&#x27;d be comfortable...which is why I risked the 30 bucks to try them.  Oh well.</li>
    <li> This product would be worth the $24 (an overcharge if there ever were one, for 4 pair of flimsy nose inserts) if they worked. But they do not, and moreover, they fall out of your nose far too easily. There is a basic flaw in their design: they are very soft, silicone tubes (visualize soft, wide straws, cut into one-half inch lengths) that are the same width at the top as they are at the bottom. There is no nostril that is the same diameter at the top as it is at the bottom, therefore there is an issue with whichever of the 4 sizes you try. The largest will feel too big and therefore too uncomfortable to sleep with, and the smaller ones will just slip out. Moreover, they are so soft that they do not have the amount of resistance necessary to actually spread the nostril.    Do not waste your money on this product. I cannot help but believe the 5 stars reviews are company originated. But this is why I am loyal to Amazon - I was able to return this item because it is \\&quot;defective/does not work\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I bought the Nasivent Tube along with a chin strap and oral mouth piece just to try several different ways to stop my snoring.  Well, after using the Nasivent just one night I saw immediate improvement in my nasal breathing.  I don&#x27;t know if it stopped my storing since my wife sleeps in a different room due to my loud storing, but I didn&#x27;t wake up gasping for breath either.  After about 2 weeks of using it every night, I started to notice a decrease in effectiveness and the inside of my nasal cavity near the front was becoming very sensitive and sore.  The Nasivent product comes with several sizes to fit all types of noses, so I switched to a smaller diameter tube to relieve the soreness.  This helped for awhile, but I&#x27;m still feeling some soreness and the effectiveness is not what it was the first week.  I will continue using this product, but will keep looking for something better.</li>
    <li> Of all the nasal dilators and spreaders I&#x27;ve tried, I think this is the least effective. The design seems flawed, and the piece keeps popping out.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item because I have suffered with chronic sinus problems for years. I have a deviated septum, and get about 3 to 4 sinus infections a year. I usually wake up feeling like I got hit by a truck- no energy at all, lethargic, and lousy. I suspected that a lack of good airflow with a resulting lack of oxygen was the culprit, so I bought this product to see if it would help.  It definitely did! I cannot say that I bounce out of bed, but I definitely feel much, much better. I am much more alert and not dragging. Interestingly, I noticed that my face is not as pale when I look in the mirror in the morning; there is definitely more color. I attribute that to increased oxygen getting into my system.  Try this product. I am glad I did!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not perfect. Let&#x27;s face it, sticking something up your nose feels weird. I found I could easily adjust to this nasal aid, as opposed to NEVER being able to sleep with a CPAP machine. My spouse said it worked, I didn&#x27;t snore, and I slept as good as I ever did. I snore intermittently, but it can be LOUD, so it&#x27;s great to have something to wear on and off.</li>
    <li> I give this product four stars because it works for me. I can understand some of the lower ratings, though, because I don&#x27;t think it will work for everyone, or even as advertised. Basically, this product corrects nasal obstruction due to the collapse of internal nasal tissues. In medicalese you can say it \\&quot;lateralizes\\&quot; the nasal walls creating a wider nasal passage and thus increasing airflow. I don&#x27;t think it will help much with snoring or sleep apnea, however, as these are typically caused by collapse of tissues in the pharynx, or throat (although some mild cases might be improved by reducing nasal obstruction). My problem has always been breathing obstruction due to narrowness of my nasal passages, so this product helps in my particular case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with a lot of reviewers that this product is very overpriced. In fact, it looks like the price went up $5 from $24.99 to $29.99 in just the last few months. I like one reviewer&#x27;s suggestion of trying to find soft tubing material at a hardware store and making your own. I&#x27;ve been thinking of buying a Nasivent for my dad (who&#x27;s going broke using Breathe-Rights), but will check and see what I can find at my local hardware stores first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My suggestion to shoppers: if you have a breathing problem due to narrow or lax nasal passages, I think you&#x27;ll find this product helpful. If you&#x27;ve got sleep apnea or a snoring problem due to restricted or lax pharyngeal (throat) tissues, you might want to look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of different products for snoring but none work like Nasivent. I don&#x27;t get kicked nor abandoned during the night by my girlfriend anymore and its nice to wake up with her.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t help me. It always fell out of my nose</li>
    <li> I recently purchased the Nasivent Tube for my husband who has a long history of snoring. This product has reduced the noise level so tha once again we can sleep in the same room. Thank you so much for your wonderful product.</li>
    <li> This product is the Nasivent Tube, which is similar to the Nozovent strip.  Which one you&#x27;ll prefer may be a matter of personal preference.    The manufacturer claims this product will resolve or treat snoring. i don&#x27;t know about the underlying causes but it certainly can help.    The product is composed to two short tubes, of differing sizes to fit different nostrils, each pair of tubes connected by a short plastic strip.  You place a pair of tubes that fit properly into each nostril and they hold open you nasal passages to improve the flow of air, particularly when sleeping.  The improvement is obvious and they do help reduce mouth breathing and snoring.</li>
    <li> I have NEVER woken up with one of these in my nose, no matter how many times I put it back in during the night. AND they are translucent, which makes them virtually impossible to find! I only have 1 left after 2 weeks of use because of that.     I can&#x27;t get the large sizes in my (apparently small) nose, but even the small size fits perfect on one side of my nose, and won&#x27;t go all the way in on the other side. One side of my nose is very narrow due to a deviated septum, and adding a silicone tube to it just flattens the tube and leaves LESS room for air flow. If you don&#x27;t have a deviated septum, then maybe this will work for you, but I don&#x27;t see how people are keeping them from falling out during the night??     I like the bottle nipple idea. Might try it, rather than pay [...] bucks for 15c worth of materials.</li>
    <li> I have a deviated septum, allergies, and wear a dental guard at night. For years I have slept on two pillows just trying to breath. This made my neck sore and over time I developed hump at base of my neck.I would be miserable either snoring and bothering my husband or wake up with my mouth dry as a desert. Meds cost more than this and rarely helped. I figured what did I have to loose? It&#x27;s so simple yet incredibly effective. My energy level has increased since using these. I panicked last night when I lost my Nasvent in the night. It makes such a HUGE difference for me. I am so amazed when I wake up and I am still breathing through my nose after hours of good sleep. It&#x27;s been years since I could do this. It&#x27;s awesome.     I would suggest that the manufacturer incorporate a color at end of vent tubes where they go in your nose.This way you would not see when wearing but would allow you to track it more easily if it falls out in the night or when you get up to go to the bathroom and it drops out. I can&#x27;t go back to sleep until I find it and because it is so colorless it can be very hard to track down if it falls out. I would have given it 5 star other than for this.</li>
    <li> does not stop snoring, get nose strips</li>
    <li> I am surprised how comfortable NasiVent is!  I am breathing so much better at night and my husband says I&#x27;m no longer snoring.  This product is great!  KC</li>
    <li> I suffer from allergies.  At night my nose often gets \\&quot;stuffed up\\&quot;. Using the Nasivent tubes helps to keep nasal passages open and i get a good night&#x27;s sleep. I was skeptical about this product, but not anymore. It really works for me.</li>
    <li> Need to do video selfie!  Not sure if it works...but I think I clinch down on it while sleeping so I awake with jaw and neck soreness and drool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m probably past this type of remedy and should investigate a cpap device, as my snoring wakes me up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 stars for good mouth fit. Takes getting use to your jaw being pulled forward which should reduce snoring.</li>
    <li> My husband still snores.  I&#x27;ve used this product myself to keep my sinuses more open.  It does help a little for that purpose.</li>
    <li> &#x27;i didn&#x27;t heed the advice in my title and bought both this and the Snop Snoring Mouthpiece at the same time. it turns out i&#x27;m a mouth snorer, so i don&#x27;t think this helps much. i use the biggest one in my nose, but it still falls out sometimes. it&#x27;s comfortable to wear, though, but doesn&#x27;t feel as effective in opening as the strips that go on the bridge of your nose.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my husband and I am delighted. I now get to sleep and so does he. His snoring was getting so bad that is was even wakeing himself up!I have ordered another set for my friend. Happy nights!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. Can&#x27;t breathe through them. Not comfortable. Save your money.</li>
    <li> Yet another product that promises results, but comes up short.  I guess there is no such thing as an easy fix for snoring.  It&#x27;s back to the other bedroom for some sleep.</li>
    <li> I did not find this comfortable enough to use it for very long.  I found other products I liked much better.</li>
    <li> Product does help to keep nasal passage open but has a tendency to fall out at night.  I prefer to use breath rite strip because they stay in place.</li>
    <li> This inexpensive,easy to use anti snoring device is very effective. I have used the recording capability of my I phone to \\&quot;listen\\&quot; to me sleep and the difference in my breathing with the NasiVent in use is dramatically smoother and quieter. I wake up feeling much more rested.</li>
    <li> If Breathe Right strips do not work for you, these won&#x27;t either for snoring. Desperate wife here trying to find a way to solve husband&#x27;s snoring problem. He is snoring away right next to me with these in.</li>
    <li> Bought this to help stop snoring. Felt weird in the nose, but did breathe better. However, didn&#x27;t stop or even reduce snoring at all.  Wish is would have worked.</li>
    <li> its ok, helps a little</li>
    <li> I have been trying various nasal dilators to help with snoring and this is the one I like best, at least so far.  The thing is, this is really something that is going to be an individual choice, what works for one person might not for the next.  Many people just won&#x27;t be able to sleep with any of these devices.  They don&#x27;t really bother me at all, so for me,it&#x27;s just finding the most comfortable and efficient.  I really think you need to try a variety of devices and see what, if any, will work for you.  Also, what I have found in trying these devices is that much of my snoring is from congestion and that using the devices to keep my air passages open really helps keep my nose dried out and free of congestion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find the Nasivent to be very comfortable and seems to work very well for me.  It is flexible and soft but still keeps my nasal passages open.  I didn&#x27;t need to, but you can trim it for a better fit, if needed.  I also very much like that they are not disposable.  They also come with several sizes in the package, which is great because I would have thought the largest size would be for me, and that&#x27;s what I tried first, but it turns out the next size down was better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My next favorite is the Snoreben, which works almost as well for me, and also came with a choice of sizes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the Snorepin to pinch a little and not quite as effective, but, again, it may be great for someone else.  It doesn&#x27;t come in sizes.  I have used Breathe Right strips, which work ok for me, but I find they often come loose during the night and I don&#x27;t like the residue they leave behind. I actually like the Brez rings quite a bit, they were very comfortable for me and work quite well, but, unfortunately, they tend to slip out of place during the night. The Brez rings only come in packages of one size, so you have to guess.  Mine fit fine, just don&#x27;t stay in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you are trying out these kinds of products, I highly recommend you add Nasivent to your list and give it a try.  Who knows?  You might be as happy with it as I am.</li>
    <li> For the price, it was not good enough. It did not stop the snoring especially someone in my family has sleep apnea.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm.  Started breathing much better from the moment I used it.  Trimmed it slightly after the first week for a more comfortable fit.  After using CPAP machines and other devices, this is so much better.</li>
    <li> started with size 3 10mm then settled on size 4 12 mm  These work well. correct trim is important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;main things, if yo have \\&quot;runny nose\\&quot;  they slip out.  also,  sleep with head to side to prevent snoring, then they work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When yo first put them in it feels like nose plugs, but then you can breathe through them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grace &amp; Peace</li>
    <li> Thes little silicone pieces kept falling out during the middle of night and then you hope you find them in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;Good for initially letting you breathe so you can fall asleep, however later expect them to fall out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;Ambar</li>
    <li> They DO NOT stay in your nose and not that comfortable. I feel I through my money away but when they are in your nose you do get more air flow but  bought them to help with snoring which didn&#x27;t happen because they fell out every night.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Nasivent tubes for a few weeks now and I&#x27;ve noticed that I&#x27;m breathing better through my nose and  sleeping longer through the night. I have mild sleep apnea and had problems breathing at night. The Nasivent tube has helped me considerably. I feel well rested  in  the morning. Product works for me!</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t work at all.  All it does is make it harder to breathe.  It seems like a good concept, but id didnt work.  Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> This worked great,, it did stop snoring,,, but feel disturbed like something hanging on the nose,,, but after sleep you dont feel anything...</li>
    <li> Maybe my expectations were too high, but this item has proven to be useless to me, and a complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> So uncomfortable I just cannot stand sticking them up my nose at night. Good thing I am no longer with my now ex girlfriend :) I can snore as much as I want and as loudly as I want.</li>
    <li> are good when we cant buy the sleep apnea machine, but if you need the machine, go and get it.</li>
    <li> I gave it a shot for past month. It comes in different sizes. It does open your nose and allow more air in. The soft silicone doesn&#x27;t hurt but it does tickle the nose all night. I felt like sneezing which didn&#x27;t help me sleep. I snore loud with sleep apnea and according to my partner it didn&#x27;t help at all. No change at all&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: Only get if you have nasal inflammation or allergies.Does not work on snoring or sleep apnea&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;different sizes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;still snoring&lt;br /&gt;does not work with sleep apnea</li>
    <li> Makes the inside of my nose raw. Had much better results with a molded mouth piece. Also got better results with a Breathe-right strip.</li>
    <li> I am amazed at how this product works.  I have tried EVERYTHING, including drugstore nasal products, but this particular product is on point.  I don&#x27;t know who the reviewer was that said it was uncomfortable, but, I slept like a baby.  I forgot I had the thing in after a few minutes.  I had to trim it to fit my nose contour, but it is worth it.  Huge improvement with snoring, I woke up not groggy for the first time in months.  You cannot be lazy with this apparatus. If it doesn&#x27;t fit your nasal cavity, trim it to your own comfort.  what I really like, is the fact that it is so soft and pliable, no sharp edges.  Great job who ever came up with this one. Cheers!</li>
    <li> I tried the strips and they worked okay but after a few times they were pulling the skin off when I would remove them.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using now or several months and they still as good a new. Lots cheaper than strips in long run.</li>
    <li> I have been using BreathRite nasel strips for years (sleep apnea). They work just fine, but they&#x27;re very expensive compared to Nasivent, which is an inexpensive one-time purchase. I like NasaVent better because it opens my nose passage wider than the BreathRite stirps. It is comfortable. And it is ever-so much less expensive than the BreathRite strips. Its easy to clean (run it under warm water, rolling around each vent with my fingers.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a regular amazon user, but this is my first review.  I haven&#x27;t felt strongly enough about anything I&#x27;ve purchased to summon the effort to write a review - until now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s important to understand what you&#x27;re paying for here: its a piece of medical grade silicon hose cut ~2.5 inches in length with a slit in the middle to divide each end for each of your nostrils.  I&#x27;m not oversimplifying here; its really just a piece of hose.  For $25, I would have expected a custom molded product contoured to fit my nose.  I cant imagine the raw materials and processing for this product would cost more than $1 to produce.  The packaging probably costs more.  Because the ends of the hose are in fact cut, and not molded, there are sharp unbroken edges which you&#x27;re shoving up your nose.  It&#x27;s painful, it made me sneeze uncontrollably, and it wouldnt stay in my nose.  My nose is so irritated and swollen from trying to insert these up my nose that I can barely breath at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re still curious about this product, you could save yourself $25 and pick up something similar at your local hardware store.</li>
    <li> I never felt sleep obstructive apnea until I tried to sleep with this \\&quot;aid\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;Shame on the company for charging an outrageous amount of money for something that may cost 3 cents to make.  Perhaps this works for some people.  It did not work for me.  I used the nasal strips and they worked better than this product.  Good luck.</li>
    <li> I bought this item based on the reviews I read. The product comes with four devices in 2 sizes.&lt;br /&gt;I used the smaller size and it did not stay in my nose through the night. It did not open my nasal cavities as the problem I have is further up in the nasal cavity.&lt;br /&gt;The instructions say that you could cut it with scissors to shorten it a bit which I did. This time it stayed in the nose overnight but it did not help at all. I also tried the larger size but it is too big for my nose.&lt;br /&gt;I am very disappointed in this product and there is no warranty so I guess I am stuck with it.</li>
    <li> Falls out from nose during sleep, tried different sizes . Way too expensive for a few pieces of little soft plastic tubing. Would NOT recommend.</li>
    <li> I have severe allergies and I was so hoping this was going to give me some relief and help me sleep threw the night and I was disappointed!  It kept falling out of my nose and it didn&#x27;t give me any relief.</li>
    <li> They arrived with rough edges and both nose dilators were torn.  I think I may be able to use one but the other one is already trashed.  I tried them last night and still woke up knowing I had breathed thru my mouth.  Why?  They are so big around it feels like your nose is stuffed even though the dilators work.  I know that sounds ridiculous, but I had to tell myself, \\&quot;breath thru your nose.\\&quot;  So I am sure once I fell asleep my brain sensed my nose was stuffed and voila.  I expect a little more quality based on price.</li>
    <li> Did not work for me, it was a total waste of money, i ended up buying something else at walgreen that worked better</li>
    <li> I purchased this item; I thought it would help, as I&#x27;ve tried a lot of devices, but this one is more bothersome than anything.  I kept sneezing and it gave me an itchy nose.</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t care for the cylinder shape. I think it would have worked better if it were tapered. Also, it must have bothered me in my sleep because I kept scratching my nose while I slept and it kept falling out. Sorry, but it just wasn&#x27;t for me. It did arrive on time and was well packaged though.</li>
    <li> Just fell out and didn&#x27;t work. Don&#x27;t waste your money or the frustration. I couldn&#x27;t find a way to use it.</li>
    <li> These do the job in keeping your nostrils open so you can breathe better. However, I find that I wake up constantly all night because the things feel weird being in your nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found most the sizes way too large for me--The smallest one is way too small, the next smallest one is too large (but it&#x27;s the one I have to use), and the two largest ones are apparently made for people with horse nostrils (I didn&#x27;t know humans had nostrils that large!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any sort of a runny nose then they will slip right out of your nose because the silicon is so slippery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure how these could be improved--maybe better sizing, less slippery, and some way to make them less annoying in your nose so you don&#x27;t wake up so much because of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said all of that, I am glad that I bought these because they certainly do allow me to breath better than without them. Even though they do cause me to wake up a lot, I think I wake up less often than not using them when my nose is so stuffy I can&#x27;t breathe.</li>
    <li> did not do a thing, worthless. it is a waste of money. not recommended to or for anyone.should be unmarketable</li>
    <li> Very uncomfortable to use to me, I would rather use breath right, and if you have allergies well forget about it....&lt;br /&gt;I ordered two different type and both were not good to me..</li>
    <li> I bought this for me and my husband because we both snore.  I have a pretty small nose and the smaller sizes weren&#x27;t fitting my nose.  I even cut it to make them fit.  The left one seems so fit my left nostril but the right one seems too small for my right nostril.  My husband used the bigger size and although it did fit his nose, he is still snoring away through the night and I have to continue to use my ear plugs.  He even said that he feels it&#x27;s restricting his breathing rather than making his breathing easier.  The Breathe Right strips weren&#x27;t working either for both of us.  My nose is too small even for the small size strips and the strips keep coming off my husband&#x27;s nose.  Quite a dissapointment.  Back to the drawing board I guess.</li>
    <li> I thought I would try something instead of the mouthpieces I&#x27;ve used for snoring and these don&#x27;t work any better then breath right strips.</li>
    <li> Regardless of the size you use they feel uncomfortable and they slip out of the nose and get lost in the covers.  Even when they are in I don&#x27;t see where it does any good what-so-ever.  I generally breath through my nose anyway so These may work better for you than then did me.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend them.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and in good shape, helps with breathing will not stop snoring.</li>
    <li> Just did not work. Also fell out during the night making the product a complete failure. My wife had the same experience.</li>
    <li> The device  is for those  those who snore when they sleep on their back but not when they sleep on their side. Side sleepers ,like myself, will often switch to their back when breathing gets obstructed. I can snore on my side as well as my back so they were a waste of time.</li>
    <li> I had never heard of these things until I started researching how to deal with nighttime congestion.  My allergies are especially bad during the late Summer and Autumn and I would wake up several times during the night to use the Neti pot or some type of nasal wash or spray.  The Breath Right strips worked ok but if you didn&#x27;t stick them on correctly the first time forget it and if you want to put any kind of night time moisturizer on you have to leave it off your nose.  The first night I couldn&#x27;t believe how great these worked.  I trimmed them slightly and they fit in perfectly.  I would definitely recommend these to anyone who had difficulty at night due to nasal congestion.  My only complaint is there is 4 in a package and only 1 really fits.  Two are two small ones, one huge one and one that was just right.  Kinda pricy to only get one that I can use.  I ordered several different types to see which work the best.  I&#x27;ve read good things about Max-Air but didn&#x27;t see them for sale on Amazon.</li>
    <li> The first night I used this, I rested well.  Morning blood pressure is lower on average.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It opens the wings of the nostrils.  For me it has made the difference between a good night&#x27;s sleep and an uncomfortable night of snoring and waking up frequently, sometimes waking up gasping for air.  I am glad I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I sleep on my side, the lower nostril tends to open and the upper tends to close.  This device prevents the upper one from narrowing.  However, I also have tissue deep in the airway that sags into the lower passage.  Without this device, both passages narrow down.  With it, at least the upper airway is always open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The nose tissue has to adjust to a foreign body.  Of the four different sizes that were in the package,  the two middle worked well for me.  The largest also works but i feel a bit \\&quot;stretched.\\&quot;  The product seems overpriced but it has made a huge difference in the quality of my sleep.</li>
    <li> Go to your local hardware store as I did a couple years ago and get a short length of soft plastic tubing, cut it into 2 pieces about 3/4 inch in length, cut at a slight angle on one end and with a little protrusion on the other as a \\&quot;handle.\\&quot;  I use 10mm tubing. I smoothed the cut edges with sandpaper.  It works very well, just  as described in the favorable Nasivent reviews.  When I told the store clerk I only needed a couple inches, they gave it to me free of charge! 2 years later, snoring solved!  My wife agrees.</li>
    <li> I bought 3 different ones for my husband to try. This one is  his favorite. It fits in the nostrils perfectly and allows him to breath during his sleep. He had so many sleepless nights because of lack of breathing. This is perfect.</li>
    <li> After a broken nose from a kick by a colt, scar tissue inside my nasal passage left just enough room to breathe, but breathing that was labored enough it sounded like I was wrestling a bear in my sleep, according to my husband! A brother-in-law offered me his small size Nasi Vent and it felt like a miracle to breathe deeply and without noise! Thank you for such a wonderful breathing solution!!</li>
    <li> It has many sizes but none of them fits my nose, so I put it at night but when I wake up it is in my bed, and even if I use it I continue with the snoring problem, for me it was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Where to start... well, I&#x27;ve been suffering from sleep apnea for many years now. Usually waking up at night choking and/or gasping for air several times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has gotten so bad lately, that I was finally considering having a sleep study done until I stumbled upon this product on Amazon. For the cost, I figured I would give it a try and see if it would work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well it does! And, I&#x27;m so glad. My wife says I haven&#x27;t been waking up anymore and no more choking at night. What a relief I can tell you... This product literally saved me $3000.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m currently on a high deductible health care plan where I would have to cover a considerable part of the cost to have a sleep study done and purchase a CPAP machine. In addition, from the things I&#x27;ve read about a CPAP machine - I don&#x27;t think I would have enjoyed using one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily this product works and I would have given it 5 stars, however, it does fall out of my nose every night. Not a big deal, because I am able to sleep well after the first few hours of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now feel so much better throughout the day and am no longer falling asleep at work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have your doubts like I did - give it a try. It may just work for you, too!</li>
    <li> Is this product overpriced? Absolutely. But I still feel better sticking a piece of medical grade tubing into my nose than something from Home Depot as some of the reviewers suggested.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy it again because it works for me.  A good nights sleep is worth a lot. Trust me, I&#x27;ve been without a lot of sleep over the past few years.&lt;br /&gt; It helps some with snoring but I like it because it keeps my nose open so I can breathe.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like the strips that go on the outside of the nose because they stretch my skin.  I don&#x27;t want wrinkles and they hurt!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not surprised it doesn&#x27;t work for everyone.  There are many different reasons we can&#x27;t breath or snore.</li>
    <li> I ended purchasing these along with the SleepRight Breathing Aid and the prescription Provent. I ended up going back to my CPAP mask. I will use the SleepRight Breathing Aids for camping and short trips when it isn&#x27;t practical to take the CPAP. I don&#x27;t think the Provents lasted an hour; I had to remove them.</li>
    <li> It just did not work. Did not think I could return because it was used &amp; trimmed to fit. No matter which size we tried, it just didnt work &amp; would fall out during the night</li>
    <li> Made nose constantly run. Gave up using them. SleepRight nasal aid worked for me.</li>
    <li> If you have sleep apnea, you will try anything to make it go away.  This solution did not work very well for me.  It does not keep a person from biting your tongue or side of mouth.  It does help breath some easier.&lt;br /&gt;I do not use it anymore.</li>
    <li> I suppose they would work if you could keep them in, by morning both are missing and we have check all over the bed to find them. I can&#x27;t get used to using them if they don&#x27;t stay in.</li>
    <li> Very uncomfortable to wear, and it doesn&#x27;t really help that much with the snoring.</li>
    <li> This product does not work. I tried all the extra sizes and everything. What a waste of money. Do not buy!!</li>
    <li> I have used the company&#x27;s other nose devices and they work. The only problem is with the packaging, they send all different sizes and some don&#x27;t fit. This is such a waste for the high price charged.</li>
    <li> Maybe there is something wrong with me, but i have not been able to get these to stay in the whole night. Have tried two different sizes with the same results.</li>
    <li> The Nasivent props open your nostrils, so it is easy to breath through your nose. If you can breathe through your nose, you are less likely to breathe through your mouth, and therefore much less likely to snore. I love this gadget. My wife reports: No more snoring from hubby.</li>
    <li> These may work to stop snoring for some people.  However I can&#x27;t imagine they would work for sleep apnea as the issue is not with the nostril but with the deeper air passage.  Sleep Apnea is a serious sleeping disorder that can affect your overall health and your internal organs.  You can try these but you should be consulting your physician and if you have sleep apnea your physician will likely refer you to a sleep specialist.</li>
    <li> You could basically cut off a straw and stick it up your nose and it would be the same.  The are made of some type of silicone, but there were not comfortable.  I thought that these would be an alternative to using over the nose nasal breathing strips, but they are not.  If I can&#x27;t breathe again at night I&#x27;ll use the over the nose nasal breathing strips again instead of these.  This item was a waste of money.</li>
