<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I dont have a lot to say about this, but i have a strong receeding hairline now at the age of 33 so i like to get a buzz cut every 3 weeks to make the sides and back match the front and top.  I was paying judes $18 a pop after tip.  Now my wife does it, takes 5 minutes or less and looks just as good.  After the 2nd hair cut, we are already saving money!</li>
    <li> works well, comes with a lot of accessories to cut hair easily and well, and has a very good instruction manual. Was 5 dollars cheaper on Amazon than my local Walgreens. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> The only thing that would make it better, is to make it portable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JC</li>
    <li> I love this kit.  You can&#x27;t beat it for the price! I no longer have to pay for my husband to get a simple hair cut every couple of weeks (he&#x27;s military), now he just sits down and we do it from home!</li>
    <li> great clippers for cutting my 3yr old hair</li>
    <li> This has worked great for what I need. The attachments are easy to switch between. It&#x27;s great having a lot of options on sizes to choose from. Great product for the price.</li>
    <li> This made cutting my toddlers hair very easy. I will break even after three home haircuts with these clippers compared to going to the barber. I finished quickly, which was nice when you have a squirming little boy sitting in &#x27;the chair&#x27;. Color coded attachments make finding the right length easy, I wish it had a 1-1/4&amp;#34; or 1-1/2&amp;#34; attachment though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far my only complaint is the cape, it is nothing more than a plastic garbage bag.</li>
    <li> Works great and is easy to use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a hairstylist and I love these clippers!</li>
    <li> This is the second pair of these I have ordered from Amazon and I have to say they are CRAP!  The only reason I ordered them a second time is because of the good reviews.  I thought maybe the first time I just got a bad set.  Both pair of clippers were extremely loud.  I followed the instructions and adjusted the power screw in order to make the sound reasonable, but at that point it was so low the clippers would not cut.  I don&#x27;t know if this is a Wahl problem or something with Amazon, but I am very disappointed either way.  I sent the first set back and got my refund, but I had to pay shipping cost.  I found that the guards on the second set actually fit an old remington clipper that I have, so I am keeping it, because I do like the different colors of the guards.  By the way I only paid $10 for the remington and it is very quiet.  I almost feel like Amazon sent me the old set I returned, but either way I would not suggest these clippers to anyone.</li>
    <li> These clippers are perfect for the beginner. I just started cutting my husband&#x27;s hair and these are extremely easy to use and come with a guides to help the process easier. I would definitely recommend to anyone looking to save money on hair cuts! They do not get overheated quickly either.</li>
    <li> used once so far and it was great</li>
    <li> This kit works great, the clippers had no problem with my husband&#x27;s very thick hair and cut beautifuly. The barber&#x27;s cape is not very well made and one of the straps broke off first time out so I would suggest getting a better one to go with this set but other than that I do recommend this.</li>
    <li> Great kit, lots included.  Simple instructions to follow.  My first time using clippers and it was great!</li>
    <li> too noisy，it looks like a used machine。</li>
    <li> This is a solid well made device...professional grade.  It more than meets our needs for family haircutting.  I would recommend this device to anyone considering doing family haircutting at home.</li>
    <li> A good deal for the money.  It has a nice sharp blade and gives a good quick cut!  Totally worth the money~</li>
    <li> Item arrived visibly used, with actual remnants of HAIR on the clippers and scissors. I wish I was joking. This is totally unacceptable! Buyer beware.</li>
    <li> This items box looks horrible. Sending pic. Giving as a Christmas present. I hope it works. It is supposed to be like new. Does not look like it.</li>
    <li> This is a Christmas gift so I really can&#x27;t rate it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t the first Wahl clipper kit I&#x27;ve bought, but it is the last. Extremely heavy, and awkward to use and the guards seem to be much cheaper quality than past purchases. Not a fan.</li>
    <li> Works great on my boys.</li>
    <li> This product is so noisy, I would not recommend purchasing this clipper.   the manufacturer need to put a silencer on this device.</li>
    <li> Great job on my husbands hair easy to use.</li>
    <li> The only reason I brought this particular pair of Wahl clippers is the color coded combs. Great for people with poor eyesight, since the color/length of cut is written on the clipper handle.  I can&#x27;t see the embossed writing on the combs.  I&#x27;ve always used Wahl, my son-in-law came over and got mine, he&#x27;s in the military and well needs a touch up by Monday morning. So off I went, and got this pair because of the above mentioned. I got the trashcan and sheered off my hair to 1/4 of an inch, cuts well. I&#x27;m retired military, I like it short, if I can comb my hair, it&#x27;s too long. Now I&#x27;m not Joe Pro Barber, so I can&#x27;t tell you about the finer things to look for in clippers. What I can tell you it&#x27;s what I used in the military. Saved my bacon when I got little notice some big wig was trolling through our area, tighten up the old mop if you know what I mean. Also 12 years after I retired. Yeah save money, and avoid waiting in the barber shop on my off time. Chow.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a decent set of hair trimmers for a reasonable price.  I am very happy with this product.  Yes the guards are flimsy but the clippers are durable and not loud at all.  Comes with a hard plastic case, nice brush and descent scissors.  I&#x27;ve bought clippers for the same price at Target and returned them because they felt cheap.  These are well made.</li>
    <li> Cuts well, cheap plastic guards broke on first try. Nice soft touch feel and is pretty quiet for hair clippers.</li>
    <li> Used it once and so far it&#x27;s great! The drape is made of thin plastic bag though and can rip easy and the hair sticks to it! I don&#x27;t like that about it. I still give it 5stars because the clipper and everything else is great!</li>
    <li> Yes it is loud, but if you adjust the screw on the right side, you can get rid of the noise. Use a phillips head screwdriver to tighten it, and when it gets too loud, unscrew it a little bit.  With a little tweaking you can have it running fine.</li>
    <li> Right out of the box we started cutting the kids hair. There are some simple ideas included which helped. My wife did such a  good job, I let her cut my hair and looks as good as my regular stylist which charges me $15. With 4 kids we now save about $70/month. I wish this review came later so I could tell you how long the blades stayed sharp. But for now, it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> The Good: The clippers work just as you&#x27;d expect. Well, I turned them on and they started buzzing at any rate. A good sign.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad: They were packed so poorly it almost has to be a joke. I mean seriously? WTF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blade oil leaked EVERYWHERE inside the bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Big ol&#x27; bag of greasy guards and brushes anyone? No takers? Didn&#x27;t think so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have usually sent an item back if it arrived &#x27;disgusting and trashed inside a baggy&#x27; however I&#x27;m confident that the replacement would be just as bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone, somewhere is chuckling to themselves while they pack these clippers... I can hear them now &amp;#34;Muhahaha... And lastly the little bottle of oil... Muhahaha Let&#x27;s see them try to use these clippers without spending hours cleaning them first...  The oily greasy fools!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok back to reality, I&#x27;ve got some clipper guards and brushes to degrease&lt;br /&gt;:(</li>
    <li> College son loves this! Says this is a money making hot commodity in the &amp;#34;frat house&amp;#34;! Perhaps I&#x27;ll buy two &amp; charge fees for Mama?! Haha!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been doing my boys&#x27; hair since their very first haircut.  One is now 5 and the other is 3.  I&#x27;ve taken them in one time to get it professionally done.  They did the exact same thing I would have done at home, and having 2 boys done cost more than buying one of these trimmers.  My husband also uses this to cut his hair.  I cannot even imagine how much money we&#x27;ve saved having this.  The only reason I did not give 5 stars is because it is a bit loud, but my kids&#x27; biggest complaint is the itchy hair that falls around them.  They&#x27;re going to get that if someone else cuts it too though.</li>
    <li> Love This Machine. does Everything it should.  Picture makes it easy to understand what to do. Has Warrenty.</li>
    <li> I like it. It works well until now.</li>
    <li> Over the years of using Wahl clippers I&#x27;ve found this one to be the most comfortable to handle. The shape is ideal and fits the hand perfectly. Its cutting power is as with all Wahl clippers and it doesn&#x27;t heat up like some other clippers I have used. This is truely an excellent clipper.</li>
    <li> I purchased this; because I was tired of spending $9.99 each time, for just a buzz cut.  I decided to give this a whirl and see if it is any good. After one cutting, I have no complaints.  Very simplple to use, I was cutting MY OWN hair! By the way; I have not and plan not to use the cape, seems like a one-timer, I would rather pop a hole in a trash bag!  It is good for the money with all the attachments.</li>
    <li> Used only twice so far but does not seem to &#x27;bind&#x27; up like others I&#x27;ve used before.  I like the the graduated trimmer attachment for around the ears.</li>
    <li> I had an Oster set for about 15 years before they called it quits, and I replaced them with this set.  Waste of money.  We are trashing them after 6 months.  They do not cut well, and I have to go over my poor husband&#x27;s head about 10 times to get it all cut evenly.  Takes forever.  I would not recommend this set.</li>
    <li> Works good, great size, I am happy.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really good, it works just fine</li>
    <li> Not recommended for thick hair.  Get&#x27;s stuck.  Works fine on humans. :)</li>
    <li> After having some reviews i narrowed down &amp;#34;Wahl 79300-1001 Home Pro 26-Piece Color-Coded Haircutting System&amp;#34;; since the &amp;#34;Seller&amp;#34; was shipping the product internationally I went head a placed the order (Shipping &amp; Handling costed me as much as the product).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I further began to read further reviews of usage of the product at which time there were several buyers mentioning about the product being &amp;#34;Loud&amp;#34; and related it voltage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All this while I assumed that the product supported dual voltage (i.e. 220V/110V) but soon understood that the product shipped only supported 110V, so I thought is no other option but use a stepdown transformer (220V -&amp;#62; 110V) but I then came to know that the product had an &amp;#34;electromagnetic motor&amp;#34; which happened to be tied into the USA mains frequency (i.e 60Hz).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since our mains frequency is 50Hz therefore I was told that the electromagentic motor inside would not work, it will be loud, overheats, not perform as designed and will eventually die!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked up for frequency converters (i.e. 60Hz to 50Hz) but they very expensive (good ones cost about US $1000)!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile the order was promptly processed and shipped out :( I cannot use this product :(((&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still give the product a 4-Star rating. It would be nice if the seller mentioned the Voltage and Frequency specification. They may as well not process the orders in those countries that do not have the same voltage/frequency specification of the USA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon had been very understanding and their policy in this matter was highly appreciative.</li>
    <li> Very pleased! Used it tonight.  I have always had Wahl clippers, but I really like the colors--easy to see you&#x27;ve got the right one!</li>
    <li> Works perfect no complaints..</li>
    <li> I use this product along with the neck brush. There is no way to go wrong with the style of the haircut.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT! IT COMES WITH EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO CUT HAIR EASILY AT HOME.  COMBES ARE COLOR CODED SO YOU DON&#x27;T MAKE MISTAKES.  IT COMES WITH AN INSTRUCTION BOOKLET THAT EASY TO FOLLOW AND PICTURES TO IDENTIFY EACH COMBS USE.  THIS IS A GREAT SET FOR BEGINNERS AND PRO&#x27;S.</li>
    <li> I had bought a set of Wahl clippers before and had been disappointed.  This set works well, just be sure to read the manual about how to change the power on the motor.  At first they didn&#x27;t seem very strong, but you have to tighten or loosen a screw to adjust them for your power outlet.  I&#x27;m no expert on hair clippers so I wouldn&#x27;t be able to tell you if this is a common thing, all I know is that my last set didn&#x27;t have anything like it and I wasn&#x27;t expecting it.  There is a good variety of clipping guards for different lengths.  Unfortunately one of my guards came broken right out of the box.  Luckily, it isn&#x27;t a size I really need so I didn&#x27;t bother with a return or replacement. Also, the cover that comes with this set is pretty flimsy, it feels like a trash bag, but it&#x27;s better than nothing.  I wasn&#x27;t buying it for the cover.  You could pick up a different cover for not too much money.  I&#x27;ve used this set 4 times now and I feel like it will hold up for a few years.</li>
    <li> Great clippers and on time it has everything</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other clippers for cutting my husband&#x27;s hair.  This one is just is good if not better for half the price (or less).  Other reviewers have mentioned the quality of the drop cloth, which I agree is a joke.  BUT, I didn&#x27;t even realize it came with such.  We typically use a towel or something.  What matters is the clippers and included combs are nice and highly functional.</li>
    <li> The comments about them being extremely loud are true. I often have to pinch the sides of the clippers (not sure why) to get them back to normal operation. Again, I don&#x27;t know what causes it or why that helps, but it does. When not in \\&quot;high gear,\\&quot; though, the clippers work just fine. The color coding is nice, but some of the colors do not really match the color code on the clippers. The general color is there, but most are darker or lighter or a slightly different hue than the color code. That was frustrating at first, but now I&#x27;ve pretty much memorized which colors I use where and do not pay attention to the color code anymore.</li>
    <li> Great package, great product. My problem is it doesn&#x27;t operate outside of united states with 220V/50hz. it only operates with US spec of 120V/60hz. using a step-down voltage converter doesn&#x27;t help either, because the frequency remains 50hz, and at this frequency the clipper operates with a very very loud noise. adjusting the power screw does not help. I talked to a technician and he said that it&#x27;s all because of the frequency, if it operates under 120v/60hz a regular low humming sound is heard, but outside united states it is 220v/50hz and problems occur. so international buyers beware of this.</li>
    <li> Nice kit that works well.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly (used twice so far), came with everything. I ended up tossing the cape thing for how useless/cheap it was (think weak trashbag plastic for the material) and the little oil container leaks a bit.</li>
    <li> Best hair clippers I have ever used. They don&#x27;t clog with thick hair!</li>
    <li> We bought this.to replace one we brought for twice the price at sallys beauty supply. This one works great. It is quiet compared to the last one we had. The price was right too. Only thing.is the cape they give you is basically a.trash sack. So I recommend buying a seperate cape.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased these clippers and will say that I&#x27;ve only used them once to cut my hair.  My wife helped me with the back side.  Overall, this was a great purchase and paid for itself in just the first use. High quality and they feel very heavy duty, like what a barber would use.  So far so good!</li>
    <li> THESE WORK VERY WELL AND MY HUSBAND LOVES THEM TOO</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for about 6 years now, and my original Wahl&#x27;s needed to be replaced after taking a few quick trips down to the tile floor.  This newer clipper has a much sturdier body, and does a great job.  The adapters are simple and work well, and the color coding is great.  On my old set, I had a few hair cuts that were closer than intended after picking up the wrong clipper guard.    I suspect that clippers should be replaced every 5 years or so (based on my usage), and at $30 the price is right.  I definitely recommend these to anyone looking to get into hair cutting.</li>
    <li> This would be my first purchase of a hair-cutting &amp;#34;system&amp;#34; / hardware so please take a note that my &amp;#34;experience&amp;#34; in this area is very limited. Having said that however, I will continue on with the review. Packaging of the product (excluding the shipping box/padding) was pretty basic (a simple cardboard sleeve would be a way to describe it) however considering that everything that is included is inside a hard-plastic carrying/protective storage case it is sufficient. The product is neatly packaged inside the storage case with the attachments being in a separate compartment inside a plastic bag. The cape itself was put across the clippers and the attachments bag. Made out of plastic the cape leaves some things to be desired however it is sufficient for in-home use. The clippers are pretty heavy and feel sturdy enough so that they do not seem cheaply built. The set includes the clippers, 3 different combs, scissors, neck duster (ouch, the bristles are man-made and not on the soft side), cape, 2 hair clips, cleaning brush (small but effective), blade oil, 13 guide combs, left and right ear tapers, ear trim guide, eyebrow trim guide and written instructions/styling guide (leaves things to be desired as it is very short). Upon turning the clippers on they weren&#x27;t super loud but are somewhat on the loud side although I&#x27;ve heard louder clippers at barber&#x27;s places. Since I&#x27;ve never held clippers myself before I can not comment on the vibrations however it is very noticeable but in no way unpleasant. The clippers cut my (thick) hair easily without clogging up or getting stuck which was a pleasant surprise. I have not played around with the power setting screw yet however I might attempt to do so at some point in time even though the power has been set at the factory and should be at the optimum setting already. Some of the guide combs have been difficult to put onto the clippers (compared to others that were supplied) however I would imagine that every set is different so you might not notice this. I was not aware of any major heating up of the cutting head during use. The cleanup was a breeze since I have decided not to take the cutting head off and clean underneath it after the first use. I&#x27;ll give it a couple of cuts before attempting to do so as I am somewhat reluctant to attempt it due to possibility of having to re-align the blades after cleaning which, to me seems somewhat tedious. All in all no complaints so far, I can not comment on the life expectancy of the product but as I&#x27;ve noted before it seems to be sturdy enough which gives me a hope that it might last for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update (February 5th 2014): Just a quick update, the device still works after being used more than a few times since the purchase. It has more than paid for itself by now. No issues whatsoever, it&#x27;s still as new even though I&#x27;ve used it every month or so. No broken parts no loose screws no dull blades, nothing. Cuts and works perfectly and as such I can safely say that the lifetime of the item is more than admirable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update (January 15th 2017): Just went over my reviews and felt like making a quick and final update on this item. As of this moment the items is completely and utterly... AWESOME. Still works flawlessly and I&#x27;ve still had no (I mean literally NO) issues with it. Still works as well as it did when I first used it a few years ago. I&#x27;m confident that it will outlive me. If it&#x27;s still available and you need some good hair clipper(s) you can not go wrong with this item. For all it&#x27;s faults the good outweigh everything time and time over.different so you might not notice this. I was not aware of any major heating up of the cutting head during use.

    <li> I cut my own hair so these see a lot of use.  My previous clippers were twice the price and didn&#x27;t perform half as well.  The permanently-aligned blades on these are a great feature.  I had to constantly re-align the blades on my previous clippers.  What a pain.  The blades are fast, so you can cut through thick hair very quickly with no catching / pulling.  Recommended.</li>
    <li> It could have been better if the case has organizer inside instead of dumping them all together inside.  Otherwise the product is recommended and with reasonable price.</li>
    <li> The first two haircuts with this system was enough to pay itself from two cuts at Supercuts. It&#x27;s worth it. My wife had a try with my head, and made some mistakes, but nothing that won&#x27;t grow back. She&#x27;ll do better next time around (I hope). It has all we need for boys and guys shorter haircuts. Gets tricky trying to do styles, because that becomes the talent of the hair-cutting person.</li>
    <li> Ordered for son. He loves it and uses all the time.</li>
    <li> Great product as always</li>
    <li> The only qualm I have with these clippers is that they do not get as close to my head as I want them to. I have a mohawk and I shave the sides of my head completely bald but this doesn&#x27;t get it there. I have to use my old clippers to get my hair short enough.</li>
    <li> An excellent clipper and set of combs, a little on the heavy side but very sturdy.</li>
    <li> This is the first set of clippers that I&#x27;ve ever owned.  I finally got tired of paying $20 every two weeks for a haircut, when I can buy these one time for a reasonable price, and get my haircut at home for many years to come (As long as my Brother and Sister-In-Law don&#x27;t mind sharing the cutting duties)...  These come with all the attachments that you could possibly need.  WTG, with a great product...  I highly recommend these clippers, and I doubt you&#x27;ll find them cheaper anywhere else...  ***Note: The barber (seersucker) smock that comes with this set is a little cheap (Plastic bag-like), and we&#x27;ve already replaced it with a heavy-duty seersucker that we found here on Amazon...  I&#x27;m still giving it 5 stars, as these clippers really do the job well!!!</li>
    <li> This is a great quality unit, my daughter is a hair stykist and she needed this for her career.  My hair has never looked better and the color coded process makes me feel a lot better.</li>
    <li> Bought this \\&quot;haircutting system\\&quot; on regards that it was good for its price and reviews but what I was surprised to see was that it&#x27;s not really that good or that bad of a product. Of course the kit is really good. Scissors, a lot of grades for cutting, different kinds of combs, oil refill/lubrication, and brushes.  What I realised is that all of this is all to hide the fact that this thing is really loud! At first when I plugged it in and used it for the first time I found that it was a bit weak; didn&#x27;t cut that smoothly. I thought that it has to be not receiving enough power since I have attached it to a voltage converter since I am located in the Middle East. I got another converter and turned it on and thought that it blew. Its sound was so loud that I thought I broke it! Then I thought maybe it says something about it in the manual. Apparently there is a screw at the side that lowers the voltage received thus making it less noisy. But by doing that the power is reduced.  So now for me to use it I have to use it on the really loud voltage and have it vibrate like hell! It cuts like a blade but when I&#x27;m done with it my hand tingles for a while.  I wouldn&#x27;t know how it would work at the States but I&#x27;m not really pleased with this purchase but 80%</li>
    <li> These are THE loudest clippers I&#x27;ve ever heard.  They&#x27;re so loud, that whoever you&#x27;re trimming has to wear ear plugs to keep from damaging ear drums!  My dog is deathly afraid of these as well.  Wish the item discription mentioned the level of noise.</li>
    <li> So I had the Wahl 79524-2501 Chrome Pro 24-Piece Haircut Kit before this, and did my homework, or so I thought... These clippers do not cut nearly as well as the chrome set I had. My husband and children have thick hair, and it literally takes no less than 3 passes to get all the stray hairs clipped that it misses. I&#x27;m very disappointed and will be moving back to the model mentioned above. The operation of the clippers is as expected, the clippers don&#x27;t appear to be made of cheap materials, and the guards are fine. I&#x27;m still a believer in Wahl products, just not this model. I have not tried replacing the blades, but I shouldn&#x27;t have to on a brand new set of clippers.</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed it, very easy to cut your hair. Good product at good price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s scary and it vibrates and I know it&#x27;ll cut hair just fine; I tried it on my leg. But I&#x27;m too scared to try my head tonight, maybe tomorrow or next week. I think it&#x27;s a great product thought, lots and lots of extra pieces. Almost too many. :S</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my husband.  It was very easy to use and I especially liked the color coding system where you can see at a glance which cutter to use next.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> work great even on a Chow (Dog)</li>
    <li> Very efficient cutter. It&#x27;s a value for money. Only problem is its a little bit heavy. Rest I love everything about this. Cuts the hair precisely.</li>
    <li> I purchased these clippers to use on my little boys. They are 3 and their hairstyle is a fade. I have never given a haircut before but was excited to try it. Other reviews say the clippers are extremely loud, what are they talking about?! My battery powered toothbrush is louder than these clippers! I watched the DVD that is included and read the instruction book. Then I started the haircuts. At the hair dresser they usually use a No2 on the sides and a No3 on top but being it was my first time I used the No5 on the sides and No6 on top then trimmed it up with the scissors and they look excellent, I was surprised I could do such a good job!   The kit includes:  the clippers with a guide on it to let you know the sizes of the attachments, attachments No1-No8 + No12, 3 ear attachments, eyebrow attachment trimmer, a cover, a cord wrap, a safety plug cover, cape, brush to brush off loose hair, oil, cleaner brush, 1 comb (not 3),scissors, 2 hair clips (not 3) DVD, booklet, and hard case to keep it all.  I would definately recommend these clippers. It does say you may have to adjust the blade after a while but it shows you how on the DVD, and it&#x27;s simple. Maybe now my husband will let me experiment on his head. :-)</li>
    <li> It works well, which is the most important thing, as it serves the purpose for which it was bought.&lt;br /&gt;Pretty looking with all the different colors.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love these clippers! I cut my husband&#x27;s hair about once a month and this gets the job done! The money we save by not paying to get it cut makes this a worth-while investment and it pays itself off quickly. The color-coded guards are great too and make it super easy to use. I wish it came with an apron, but they aren&#x27;t expensive to buy. Other than that, no complaints! Even the fact that it isn&#x27;t cordless doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. We just use an extension cord when needed. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I bought these Clippers to replace my cordless one. These are great hair clippers. They are not loud at all like some other people were saying-  I have a 21 month old son and he had no issue at all with noise. They are a little heavy though. Just heavy enough that i needed some time getting used to the weight. I&#x27;ve used the Clippers now 4 times and I definitely am getting more comfortable with them now. This set comes with a lot of accessories so it&#x27;s been fun using them all! But it also comes with a hairdresser cape. The Cape is useless. It&#x27;s a white plastic similar to a garbage bag. It ripped the first time I used it, but it&#x27;s okay I&#x27;ll just get a replacement cape, it&#x27;s not a big deal.</li>
    <li> a awesome product, I use it to cut my boys hair and my dad. I would have all my friends get this product. Thank you&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joni</li>
    <li> Excellent razor. The baldes are sharp and doesn&#x27;t overheat easily.</li>
    <li> Well made, easy to clean, sharp blades. Good for the price.</li>
    <li> Nice Item.. Has lasted long time</li>
    <li> Because it&#x27;s awsome work very good and I&#x27;m really satisfy it&#x27;s very smooth it&#x27;s worth the money truly and more</li>
    <li> I ordered this product for my well groomed husband and he was very impressed by it.. Especially for the price. I don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s the best he&#x27;s ever had, but he is very happy with it :)</li>
    <li> The color coded cutting combs match the key on the clipper itself.  very helpful.  A useful and practical kit.  The scissors are not good but for the price, this system is great.</li>
    <li> Its the best in its class. Compared to other trimmers you can tell the difference when you hold a WAHL and turn it on. Yes it is heavier but a lot more sturdier, reliable and you can feel the motor producing more rpm&#x27;s.   Produces a great cut. If you are looking for a hair trimmer, you must get this one. Its worth every penny.</li>
    <li> They work great. I like the multi-colored attchments, it makes it easy to find the size you want.</li>
    <li> This is a very good quality shaver. It is heavier than my last one and a bit louder, but it cuts nicely. The ear trimmer didn&#x27;t work well the only time I tried it...just MAKE SURE that you hold it at an angle or you will get lines in your hair. All the different size attachment options are great. The box though, could be a bit bigger with maybe a compartment to keep the attachments organized. Really everything is just all thrown together and then you have to fight the cord to get it closed.</li>
    <li> I love these clippers! I bought them for my boyfriend since he just likes a buzz cut and spending $15 dollars a hair cut is crazy just to buzz it, i got these at sams club for 25 dollars and couldnt be happier ! We were not looking for super fancy or anything, just something to get the job done and could last a while! These are PERFECT for those people not looking to spend a whole lot but want a good quality shaver!</li>
    <li> Love it! Really easy to cut your own hair, for less than the price of one haircut at a salon! Takes a bit of getting used to (cutting your own hair), but highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I love these clippers! The color coded guides are perfect because I can just grab the color I need out of the bag and know I have the right size. We use our Wahl clippers quite often and they work just as well now as when I purchased them.</li>
    <li> 3rd time buying this item. Used to love it. Stupid sh*t doesn&#x27;t cut even though I tried to adjust the side n vibration frequency.</li>
    <li> Exactly what you would expect.</li>
    <li> Love these&lt;br /&gt;Replaces a set that is 5 years old and gave the old set to my sister in law for her boys.</li>
    <li> This is a great product I got this for a friend and he loves it it&#x27;s a must buy&lt;br /&gt;It was worth the price</li>
    <li> It is durable and functions great</li>
    <li> I initially bought hair clippers because I was too embarrassed about how much my son screamed when he got his hair cut. At least if I cut his hair, only I have to deal with the screaming. I have been cutting his hair for years with these - every eight to twelve weeks. Shortly after I got these, I started cutting my husband&#x27;s hair too. At at least five times a year, that is ten haircuts a year. Needless to say, we have saved big $$$ on haircuts over the years. My son will be ten soon, and I imagine that in a year or two it will no longer be \\&quot;cool\\&quot; to have your mom cut your hair, but until then, I will continue to cut his hair and save money. I&#x27;m sure my husband will continue to have me cut his hair, so this product will continue to be used for many years.</li>
    <li> I bought this set for my boyfriend and he says the clippers work great. He likes the color coding as well. No complaints!</li>
    <li> Though it&#x27;s not the best clippers I&#x27;ve ever used, it is still a pretty good buy, and the set includes some fairly usable combs and scissors. All in all, the set is fine and it&#x27;s cheap...but if you want some better quality clippers, seek elsewhere.</li>
    <li> As a person that make his mind weather or not to have hair or go bald, have a beard, GoTee or clean shaven this works great, I can trip down to shave, leave the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow trip the beard and my hair.</li>
    <li> Do be fooled by the website description. The clipper is not rechargeable. If you are looking for a cordless clipper. This isn&#x27;t the right one either.  The only good thing I could say about the clipper is that it looks durable and heavy duty. You might be able to mow your lawn with it.</li>
    <li> This unit is similar to a few others that I&#x27;ve had over the years.  The color coded pieces will work GREAT for my wife and kids as they will be using this model most of the time.</li>
    <li> Prompt shipping, well priced top notched hair cutting set</li>
    <li> This product has worked just like it is supposed to. I don&#x27;t know if I will live long enough to learn to cut my own hair in a satisfactory manner. There is a rather severe learning curve for that (if you don&#x27;t believe it, look at my hair!). But, like the man said, it will grow back and I know it will look better the next time.  I am satisfied with my purchase and would recommend it to others. Thanks, Amazon.</li>
    <li> I used it twice a month for 2 years &amp; one day it just stopped working. The motor was still spinning but on less speed &amp; couldn&#x27;t cut anything.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s heavy &amp; the blade gets dull relatively fast compare to other machines. I am looking for a different manufacturer or model now.</li>
    <li> My Son in law says Works Great</li>
    <li> I have not used this product yet but I checked everything out and it cuts very well, its a 5 star product for sure. It also came with the poncho, a couple of combs and scissors as well ! Great product, I really like it.</li>
    <li> I bought this to cut my shih-Tzu&#x27;s hair. It works great!!! Awesome deal, too!!</li>
    <li> it works well, no problems</li>
    <li> Works great. Now I will never have to pay for another haircut.</li>
    <li> I have 3 boys at home and this is the best thing I have purchased.  I no longer need to spend $30 to $60 every 3 weeks to get their hair cut.  I have only done it a few times now, but I am getting better and it&#x27;s actually pretty easy.  There&#x27;s a great instruction book as well.</li>
    <li> Once you get the hang of it... Cut your own hair in 20&#x27;min in the shower.</li>
    <li> I use this for my husband&#x27;s hair...and pretty occasionally to cut hair for friends.     I just bought an Andis grooming clipper set for my dog. (Because I didn&#x27;t want to switch out blades constantly.) It&#x27;s OK, but it made me appreciate my Wahl clippers that much more!     Each comb is a different color. You just glance at the clipper&#x27;s handle, and it tells you what color to grab depending on what length comb you need!     With almost every other set set, you have to try to read the plastic comb itself. Blah!    We&#x27;ve had our Wahl for a few years now, and it&#x27;s still going strong. Great choice! I&#x27;ll take it over my old Oster and Andis sets any day!    The switch is a little stiff, but hey, you don&#x27;t have to worry about turning it on or off by accident!</li>
    <li> This replaces an older Wahl set of clippers and attachments.  As I expected, this clipper kit is everything I needed and the same top quality I have gotten in previous Wahl clipper sets.  I like the color coding of the attachments since my previous set was all black and it was challenging to get the correct sized attachment for the specific area I was trimming.  I shouldn&#x27;t make any mistakes with this color coded set!  The clippers are light-weight enough that my hand and wrist do not fatigue during a long session, either.  This is a great set at a fantastic price!</li>
    <li> I bought this set mostly for the clipper because of the price.  It is certainly worth it, my hair dresser says.  She even borrowed it one day when hers quit on her.  The rest of the set is OK, but useful if you need the other items in the set.</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd time we purchased this shaver in 13 years.  The first one works great, but for convenience we wanted a second.  The shaver is durable and easy to use.  The reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars was because the plastic case was a little cracked upon arrival.  Otherwise, highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m playing Lt. Col. Nathan Jessep in A FEW GOOD MEN in Moorpark, California and my hair has always been long with a pony tail.  But after getting cast as a Marine Lt. Col., I have found that these clippers have saved me a lot of money, money I don&#x27;t have to give barbers. Using # 1 and # 2 attachments, makes my character very convincing.  Best $27.00 I&#x27;ve ever spent.</li>
    <li> very good product, I&#x27;m really glad to get, easy to use, does not overheat at all, in short, everything really well thanks</li>
    <li> My son uses this to cut his hair and loves how easy it is with the different guides.</li>
    <li> Very good trimmer at a good deal, worth taking it. Although, not able to do fine trim to my beard, it is doing good job in hair grooming.</li>
    <li> A greet friends have bought them a razor, of this same model, I came to my people in Venezuela, the oil between blades before use, and put it in its case, the next day would use with my brother and I realized that the teeth are split, I would buy a few cloves of spare parts and want a recommendation.&lt;br /&gt;Thank You&lt;br /&gt;Cesar Varganciano</li>
    <li> A very nice clipper.  Does an excellent job!  Buy Andis COOL CARE PLUS spray for lubrication.  One can will probably last me a lifetime.</li>
    <li> This set is perfect for trimming our biracial babes and even our dogs faces. The amount of guards works when we try to do longer top on our three year old and then short sides. It is quiet so it doesn&#x27;t scare the kids or the dogs and can get close to the dogs eyes without hurting them. The brush is great for the kids to clean and the apron is very cool I don&#x27;t bother much with the comb or scissors but they are great addition if I need it someday. I am sure I could get real professional as an amateur mother hair cutting with the instructions but I haven&#x27;t bothered just do a little simple cut for now but seems you could do both with this set.</li>
    <li> Great quality for the price. It would be nice if a 1.5&amp;#34; guard was included. It goes from 1&amp;#34; to 2&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Dont expect anything amazing with these clippers, but they will certainly do the job. For the price these clippers are a great value. These will cut your well enough for an amateur at home barber. If you are serious about cutting your hair, I would invest in better clippers, but if you are just starting out then these are a great first pair. Comes with all the guards and scissors youll need</li>
    <li> We just used it this weekend for the first time with no previous experience and it was a success and very easy to follow cause of the different colored combs.</li>
    <li> This is a good clipper set.  The guides themselves were 14.99 at the pro beauty supply place.  Since purchasing this, noticed it a little cheaper at rite-aid, but this is a product review and the set is awesome for the price</li>
    <li> Though I was hesitant about buying (but mostly using) these clippers to cut my hair, I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised!!  I purchased these in September of 2011.  The colored combs are nice, but even after 10 haircuts, I carefully look to see the number.  The ear trimmers are nice but may leave your temples a bit shorter than some people like.  I personally like it short, but you certainly do not have to use them.  The kit is contained in a fairly durable plastic box that everything easily fits in.  The brush that is included is fantastic at sweeping up hair without getting &#x27;clogged&#x27; (also an Item I would not have thought of before using).  The plastic robe seems flimsy, but has actually held up very well.  I read that other people  think the clippers are noisy, and they are louder than you can sleep through, but no louder than the clippers at my former barber.  I don&#x27;t hesitate now to give myself a trim at any time.  I have not mastered doing the back of my neck alone, so I even get in some quality share time with my wife as she does that part.  My 19 yo son finally had me do his hair last week for the first time (I guess he was desperate...lol).  The 10 haircuts would have cost me around $200 including the tip, so i figure I have pocketed $175. All I can say is I am not a brain surgeon, and if I can do it, almost anyone can.  Easiest $175 I ever made.</li>
    <li> Love it, and I love the colored guards.  The case is more compact than other models, but everything fits well.  Win!</li>
    <li> I wish I would have read the other reviews of this product before I purchased it at Walgreens.  After reading the reviews I decided to see for myself how loud the trimmer is and how poor of performance it has; let me tell you that everything every negative reviewer has said here is true.      This trimmer is LOUD.      This trimmer sucks at trimming hair.   I have a buzz cut so it&#x27;s not as though it is that difficult to get through.  However, I had to stop trimming my hair several times because the blade kept getting stuck in the guard just from barely pushing the trimmer through.      I&#x27;m now looking at some Oster trimmers.  My last Wahl trimmer was wonderful but I couldn&#x27;t find it again in the store.</li>
    <li> It works as expected. Not as quiet or efficient as you&#x27;d want, but for the price, it&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
    <li> Love these clippers for cutting my boys&#x27; hair. Worth the money!</li>
    <li> i give 3 stars because it had hair in it like it was use before i get it</li>
    <li> good and affordable product</li>
    <li> Excellent, very good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve personally been using my Wahl clippers for 8 years. Before I found them in my house and began using them who knows how many times they had been used.  I use them on my self at least once a month; and for a period of 5 years I have used them to cut most of my friends&#x27; hair.  In short, the clippers were getting used weekly for a long, long time.  I have numerous friends who have tried to buy clippers from other companies over the years, and ALL have not held up.  Most of them switch over to Wahl after inquiring about mine.  I have rarely, rarely as in 4 times, used the clipper oil, and have never cleaned them spotlessly.  I write this due to the complete blasphemy that has been written about these clippers.  These are the best clippers money can buy, and I will NEVER use anything but Wahl.  Happy shopping...</li>
    <li> Good product, comes with loads of useless goodies.  I like the fact it comes with all the attachment combs.  The larger attachment are a little flimsy.  My biggest complaint is that the fader on the clippers doesn&#x27;t adjust far enough.</li>
    <li> I use this to trim my beard.  Very powerful and sharp.  This is great, I got rid of my little rechargeable trimmer and use this.&lt;br /&gt;Trims very well, rarely pulls and does a neat job.</li>
    <li> The first time I used these clippers, they worked fine. The second time, they barely cut any hair at all -- they kind of ripped the hair and it took several passes to even do that. Don&#x27;t know if this is because the blade lost its edge after one use or the blade lost its alignment but having a product fail me on the second use is some kind of record -- an abysmal one.</li>
    <li> I bought Wahl hair cutters about 12 years ago when I decided to go with a buzzcut.  I got haircuts once or twice a month.  After 12 years, it started having an intermittent problem - it would stop and start unpredictably during use.  Opening the case, it was not obvious what the problem was.  Well, 12 years, less than $10, I could hardly complain, and it came with a VHS tape with instructions, too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This new one seems expensive at nearly $30 for my limited needs.  I sure don&#x27;t need all the accessories that came with this kit: I mostly wanted it for the 1/16 and 1/8 combs, and to use without combs in hot weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But during the third haircut, suddenly the comb went flying off.  We turned it off and put the comb back on.  But it was not cutting as well any more: it sounded much more quiet than it had while cutting hair, and it left some hair uncut.  The haircut was finished by going over and over the same spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suspect the problem was that the blades went out of alignment.  This might be something I could fix myself, and of course the product has a 5 year limited warranty, but for a product I had only owned for 2 months and had 2 1/2 haircuts, it seemed like the sign of a lemon.  Fortunately, the store where I bought it took it back without any argument, even though the package says 30-day money-back return policy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also noticed that setting the comb for the longest setting (with the lever), it tended to be so loose that it gradually moved to the shortest setting, so we had to start over again to get uniform length - shorter than I intended, but that&#x27;s ok.</li>
    <li> I bought this for personal use and this is one of my best purchases ever. Everything is included and the color coding makes it so easy to use. Love it.</li>
    <li> These are my 3rd Wahl clippers over the past 20 years, and they do a really good job.  This one seems much more refined than my last two, as sometimes the only way you know you are cutting hair is when the hair falls on the ground.    It has the standard No. 1 to No. 8 guards, but it also includes a No. 1/2 guard, which I didn&#x27;t know existed.  It doesn&#x27;t have a guard beyond No. 8, but I don&#x27;t know of any clipper set that includes a guard beyond 8.  I also use a 10 and 12, and I have to get them separately.    It has a lot of extras that you don&#x27;t need, but has a few things that are handy, like a neck duster.  The scissors, however, are much cheaper than what I&#x27;ve gotten from Wahl in the past, so I&#x27;m keeping my old scissors.    You can find cheaper Wahl clippers, but you can&#x27;t go wrong getting this one.</li>
    <li> I just receive this product ,its faster than I expected ,hehe.... it looks like good quality ,i will try it today to my son...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks I like it!</li>
    <li> This cutter is unusable as it is so noisy that I would have to wear earplugs to use it.  On enquiring about how much it would be to return the item at an Australian post office I was advised it would be approx $40.  Would this be refunded if I returned the faulty item ?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bernie</li>
    <li> Been using these for years, have to replace them about every 3-4 years due to blade dullness and wear.  use the oil it will prolong the blade life!</li>
    <li> I have never used clippers to cut hair let alone ever cut someones hair. This comes with easy color coated guides. I have cut my son&#x27;s and husband&#x27;s hair so far and it has worked out great. Comes with a easy written guide too. Everyone thinks I did a great job and are actually surprised it wasn&#x27;t done at a salon. I plan on doing my son&#x27;s and husband&#x27;s hair every time now. Great for saving money!</li>
    <li> This item quit working in less than 6  months of occasional (personal) use. I will not recommend it !</li>
    <li> Growing up, my dad used to cut my hair with an old Wahl clippers he used back when he was in the Navy. I was brought up with home haircuts and when I enlisted in R.O.T.C. the old clippers were brought out again. With my current employment, regulations require a military style haircut. Instead of paying $11 every three weeks, I decided to upgrade to a more modern and current clippers. (By the way, the old clippers are still running strong and still cut like the day they were purchsed. I just wanted a more modern clippers and more acessories). I did not have to do any research as to the best clippers in quality and price. I went straight to Wahl. I cut my own hair and it looks like a professional job. Wahl gives a clean, even, precise cut, with no hair pull. It has an electro-magnetic motor, so it naturally has a hum and does vibrate when on. The clippers come from the factory pre-adjusted and pre-oiled. All one needs to do is plug it in, attach a guide comb and begin your haircut. The DVD supplied is also an added asset. It not only covers different hair cutting techniques, it also covers SEVERAL different haircuts/styles and maintainence. Trust Wahl. They are not only the first, (on the DVD they cover the history of the electro-magnetic hair clippers), they DEFINATELY are the BEST!! &lt;br /&gt;If the clippers are maintained and taken care of, your new Wahl Clippers may last you 50some years also.</li>
    <li> I had the old hair system and this new one is GREAT. This machine is quiet and will save you hundreds. The DVD is great for the learner yet easy for anyone to use and love. I have owned several whole sets before but this one is hands down the best. The color coded blades make for easy use and the clippers glide through the hair like a knife through hot butter. I am a fan of the Wahl system sense I have 4 sons and let me tell you this is easy for anyone to use and you can save tons. A perfect present also.</li>
    <li> The Wahl home pro haircutting system is definitely a good purchase!  The color-coded combs are easy to use and the tools were clean, sharp and ready for use!  No complaints from this user!</li>
    <li> My wife has used these to cut our sons hair for the first time &amp; it worked well, shes going to do mine next &amp; I&#x27;m sure it will go fine. The great thing about this unit is its made in the good ol USA:-)</li>
    <li> I bought this pair clippers over 10 years ago, and they are still running strong. Just keep them oiled and you will have a great pair of clippers that will last generations (probably). They run just as good today as they did when I bought them.</li>
    <li> I am a proud black man that loved these clippers. They are for all types of hair and are way better then my Remington hair clippers. Its true that after a few weeks you&#x27;ll earn your money back. As soon as i cut my hair with these i fell in love with no regrets!</li>
    <li> Does great haircuts..color guide very helpful.</li>
    <li> Works great! Cuts so much better than the cheapos you buy like Conair.</li>
    <li> Excellent hair cutters.  Lots of accessories.</li>
    <li> We just used this clipper on my 4 and 6 year olds, and my husband.  We previously had a lower Wahl model, and it finally broke.  This was very sharp and cut nice and quickly.  I love the color coded system, especially when you have to be fast with little boys.  And it helps avoid costly mistakes like when my husband decided to trim his on his own and picked up the wrong size.  It&#x27;s great having the little ones because you can practice on them, and then move up to the big guys!!!  Best of all, it&#x27;s the best money saver.  No more $15/person trips to the salon.  I was excited about the cape, but it&#x27;s just a trash bag with a hole in it.  And you might want to go ahead and order a neck duster because the included one is very scratchy.  But it&#x27;s great for cleaning up the clippers, and certainly works when needed.</li>
    <li> The price is well. And It&#x27;s very useful. I have used it for several times to cut my boyfriend&#x27;s hair</li>
    <li> I just bought these a month or so ago. I was tired of paying 15 bucks a month for a basic short hair fade. I have really thick hair and it was recommended that I pick up a Wahl. I have to say that this set is amazing and although I will never use anything but the 1, 2 and 3 I certainly have plenty of options. My wife was able to cut my hair easily with no pulling. The built in trimmer is also fantastic.</li>
    <li> the thing broke down after 3 or 4 times of use.  poor quality, not recommend to others</li>
    <li> When I get this item, open it, I find it is used.So come on, why the condition is new but I get an used one, so upset.</li>
    <li> I originally boughtt his kit for my son 3 years ago when he went off to college.  Guys are fine with clipping their hair and others.  Three years later, it&#x27;s still running perfectly, except there are 8 guys living together and needed another as the other was getting a little dull.  It was cheap enough to just buy another one versus sharpening the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mind, you these boys are not professional hair stylists, but can use these like a pro.</li>
    <li> I work in a salon and i specialize in men cuts and this makes things so much smoother! I have already doubled my cliental.</li>
    <li> The clippers work but may take a few passes to catch all the hairs.&lt;br /&gt;I use these for my husbands buzz cut and sons Princeton trim.  The attachments work well for our needs, and offer a good selection of lengths.  This works for maintenance, but not really a &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; sharpness.</li>
    <li> I love this set of clippers.  It is very rare that you pick up an item and it feels solid, high quality and performs as such.  I use this item for beard grooming and general touch up.  It comes with numerous trimmer attachments.</li>
    <li> After a few weeks waiting, I finally got my clipper. When I took off the blade cover, I found lots of small pieces of hair between blade tooth, also the inside the blade cover. Gross! After I cleaned the blade with swab, the swab became black! Gross!</li>
    <li> Great item, just bought it ans it looks great. Now I can cut my ugly ass hair with confident!</li>
    <li> Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> I recommend this set and all the wahi hair clippers its save me $40 a month it takes very little practice</li>
    <li> Well, I wish I could add an audio file so you can hear how horribly loud these things are.  They vibrate so much you could probably get a decent massage out of them if you could stand the noise. It comes with an adjustment screw, but no matter what you do, they are unbearably, abnoxiously loud!  The seem to cut OK, except my wife has to squeeze the sap out of them when cutting to try and dampen the vibrations.  The one nice thing is the extra small plastic spacer it comes with which helps fade military hair cuts better.  Maybe I got one of the bad ones, but I will never buy Wahl again (or at least I will definately keep my receipt so I can return them as soon as I re-prove to myself that they suck.)  I recommend you shop for something cordless, that claims it is \\&quot;extra\\&quot; quiet, and most importantly NOT Wahl.  These are horrible clippers.</li>
    <li> This is a totally useless clipper. Dont buy it. I just wasted 30 bucks. It lacks enough power and does not cut but rips the hair out. Total waste of money.</li>
    <li> I really like the clippers, it works nicely, cutes even and isn&#x27;t loud at all. The carrying case accomodates everything, however it is a bit unorganized.</li>
    <li> Worth the price paid. one of the best online product I have bought online from amazon. It comes with multiple blades, scissors combs and brushes, which serves the purpose for novice like me. Highly recommended product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to the &amp;#34;mom&#x27;s at home haircuts&amp;#34; haha. I have used these 3-4 times now to cut my sons hair and its very easy to use and I love the color coding.. makes it easier to remember which ones I used. :) Watched a few youtube videos on how to cut hair and I was off! Even the first cut turned out acceptable! :D</li>
    <li> love it and it work great. Easy to use and it is very cheap. I use to cut off my brother and friend hair and look like it went great and very smoot....</li>
    <li> Cut my hair well without getting caught on anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complains are...&lt;br /&gt;* The barber&#x27;s cape is trash bag thin.  Not outdoor heavy duty trash bag but indoor thinner then paper thin.  It seems disposable and is a joke.  Spend the extra .25 cents and make it thicker.&lt;br /&gt;* The plastic pieces are on the thinner side.  They work fine but the tips are flimsy.</li>
    <li> This shaver is not as good as the previous Wahl shaver we used.  We would still be using the old one if it hadn&#x27;t died after 8 faithful years of use.  This kit is nice because of all the accessories included, but for some reason, the shaver just doesn&#x27;t do a very good job.  It is loud and doesn&#x27;t do a clean shave.  I find myself having to go over the same area over and over and over again just to ensure all hairs were caught.  It is very frustrating, adding an additional 10 minutes of work, easily.</li>
    <li> the color code is easy to use, and they also provide a plastic cover, the main clipper works well, I will use it for many years to come</li>
    <li> Works great, case hold everything although it does not provide organization for attachments.  Nice assortment of attachments.</li>
    <li> I like this product, as we can no longer afford haircuts for my boys.  Cool! They can cut their own hair.  Everything you could possibly need was provided with the kit.  My 13 year old loves it! Thank you.</li>
    <li> For the price this unit is just the right one. It is a very usable tool. It makes light work of the job of cutting hair.</li>
    <li> this product, the first time i used it to cut my little boy&#x27;s head it bruise him him so bad i felt so bad because i was the one that was telling him be quiet you lying when i looked at the back of his head it was cut up really bad...so so sad..</li>
    <li> These were ok for the money but I hoping they would be better.  The guards are a little flimsy.  Not at all the quality of the clippers that I have bought in the past from Wahl.</li>
    <li> Saved +++ at the hairdresser&#x27;s! I wish I had found this years ago. Cutting your own or husband&#x27;s hair is easier than you might think.</li>
    <li> Good clippers, excellent value</li>
    <li> love it . my husband really needed one and it works great.</li>
    <li> I bought these clippers so I could cut my boy&#x27;s hair. They are 6 and 8. The older one was needing a haircut every 6 weeks and I finally figured I&#x27;d try these clippers even though I never had much desire to cut hair before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I watched some YouTube videos and I started at the beginning of summer so if I messed it up too badly I could just buzz the whole head and not as many people would see it. I&#x27;m not going to say they came out brilliantly, but I did well enough. It takes practice. I find the back of the neck challenging as well as behind the ears. I&#x27;ve given each boy about 4 haircuts now and I am improving. (I&#x27;m a perfectionist. No one else noticed the job wasn&#x27;t great. It&#x27;s just getting the job done smoothly, with no skimpy areas and nice clean edges that is not as well done as at the hairdresser&#x27;s).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s slower going than at the hairdresser, which for active boys, is annoying. The younger one is entertained by the different colored combs- he tries to guess which color will be next and the older one uses the comb changes to gauge how much time he has next. It is much messier than at the hairdresser too- I get tons of hair not only all over my kitchen, but all over the boys. The cape provided with the kit lasted 1 haircut. Now we use a garbage bag with a hole punched through the bottom. It still gets hair all over them and underneath the bag. I think the clipper gives a slightly coarser cut than at the hairdresser&#x27;s- I can feel the difference when I run my hand up the back of my son&#x27;s head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I am pleased with this purchase. We were paying $15 for each boy&#x27;s haircut every 6 weeks. For $25, yes, you have to practice and to clean up your kid and your kitchen. I think the savings are worth it and it&#x27;s also nice to just give a haircut in the spare time before a bath, without ever leaving your house.</li>
    <li> I have had a few Wahl home haircutting kits over the years and have always been happy with them.  I really like the color coding along with the numbers on the combs with this new version.  I once made a mistake of using the wrong comb on my husband and his hair was VERY short.  He was very nice about it, but I felt terrible.  I doubt I would have made that mistake if we had the color coded comb version then.  Glad to have it now.  Be sure to clean the clippers well after each use and these will probably last you for years.  In the last 15 years or so, I have had to buy now my 3rd clipper.  Pretty good bargain vs getting my husband&#x27;s hair cut in the salon all these years.</li>
    <li> I am extremely impressed at the value of this item.  I got so many extras and the razor works so  well!!!!</li>
    <li> We think these are great clippers with a smooth action.  We bought them to replace a set that really tugged on my sons hair when I tried to trim it.  These cut through smoothly with no pulling or tugging on the hair while they are cutting.</li>
    <li> The clipper for cutting the centre up portion should be bigger than the one provided.  The bigger clipper alone is sold at $9 wat the heck!!! Everything else works kool.</li>
    <li> I bought these after my favorite Oster clippers finally broke.  Previously, no one could believe I did my boys&#x27; hair myself, and I&#x27;m certainly no professional, but it always turned out even.&lt;BR&gt;  Although the colored attachments seemed like a great idea, and are indeed prettier than black, they don&#x27;t seem to be as straight as my previous ones were.   Perhaps that kind of plastic warps more easily?  After switching to these Wahl clippers, people would ask if I cut my boys&#x27; hair myself, which was not exactly a compliment.  I noticed that it was no longer even, and I&#x27;d find long hairs leftover even though I&#x27;d go over the same sections repeatedly in effort to eliminate that problem.  Again, I&#x27;m not a professional, but one would think I&#x27;d be getting better with years of practice, not worse.  I chalk it up to the poor performance of these Wahl clippers.  I give them two stars only because they do have a nice set of scissors, carry bag, clips, comb, and some &amp;quot;extras&amp;quot; included.</li>
    <li> I really like these clippers, but it is so loud!!! Perhaps I just need help adjusting the lever. When I finished giving myself a trim, my eardrums hurt.</li>
    <li> super fast shipping, excellent product but I knew what I was buying.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best home hair cutting systems I have ever found and I highly recommend it to anyone that cuts their own hair. With the color coded clipper guards it is very simple and easy to get a nice hair cut. You can always trust Wahl and Amazon to have great products at the best prices.</li>
    <li> Clips more closely than any other clipper we&#x27;ve ever used.  It is good quality and a very comprehensive set if accessories.</li>
    <li> My first wahls hair cutting set lasted apox 20 year thinking where I lived when I got the first set! Time dose fly this I think will be the last one I need! Thanks</li>
    <li> Bought two sets, one for my dogs and one for myself.  Definitely cuts the dogs hairs, better than spending $200 plus for dog clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just keep them lubricated and they last a long time.  The color system helps find the sizes better and have been using for a few months, no issues. I use it every 2-3 days to trim my beard to a 1 or a 1/2 and does the job everytime.</li>
    <li> I ordered this as a temporary fix until I can order a better set at the next hair show. They didn&#x27;t even edge well. The clipper guards were random the kit and looked pieced together from a variety of other kits.</li>
    <li> It comes with a lot of pieces and parts, which has come in very handy. This is a wonderful clipper!</li>
    <li> The day we got the kit, it paid for itself. My son and I each used it with amazing ease. Actually, it is almost haircut time again. We are in plus money. Thanks guys.</li>
    <li> Kinda cheap but it works for now. I like all the attachments. And the other materials. Clips feel cheap but hold hair so it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
    <li> Work great and I&#x27;ve got three boys and a husband,</li>
    <li> We use these to cut our boy&#x27;s hair &amp; they have been great.  Would recommend this product to anyone. Great quality.</li>
    <li> I shaved off my facial hair because of the hot weather. Works great.  My first choice was the correct choice.</li>
    <li> Great clipper kit! Feels heavy duty when you turn the clippers on it really feels like something high quality that a barber will use. The clipper motor sound is very strong. I tend to just buzz my head very simple that&#x27;s all i was looking for since i wear a hat most of the time. And this is perfect for that. I don&#x27;t really need $100+ clippers to buzz my head.  Best bang for your buck i only spent $25 during the prime sale. I give it a 5 out 5 stars.</li>
    <li> So far so good. Bought thses to replace my old Wahl clippers that I had for 13 years that were just worn out. We&#x27;ve had these clippers for a couple months now and they seem to work well. The case is nice and I like the colored attachments. I use these at home to cut my husband&#x27;s, son&#x27;s and other male family  members&#x27; hair. I am not a professional  but I&#x27;ve been giving cuts at home to save money for a while now and these seem to give just as good a cut as they&#x27;ve had at salons.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this to cut my own hair [male], and have used it to cut my cat&#x27;s hair [It&#x27;s probably not intended to be used on a cat]. It get&#x27;s the job done. It comes with plenty of different sizes, it comes with a plastic thing that you put around your neck and body so that it doesn&#x27;t make a mess all over your clothes, like a bib. It also comes with scissors and a comb! I loved it, and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Stop Working after one use , the vibration is intense and it makes noises , i tried the screw on the side still does not fix it ..</li>
    <li> very basic, nothing fancy. not so sure i&#x27;d use these for anything more than shaving a head though</li>
    <li> Great clippers - easy to use, very sharp, nice product!</li>
    <li> I used it in India and on first day it burned out due to high voltage in India but they didn&#x27;t (mention) / highlighted this point in specs...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think we need converter to use this in India, In US its 110 votls and in India 210 / 220 volts</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the hair clipper, great price and quality. My daughter is a hair stylist and uses this daily very pleased.</li>
    <li> Came with all the parts.  The color difference makes organizing it easier.  It is easy to use. Over all it is good for what paying for it.</li>
    <li> This is my second pair of clippers.  I like this one much better.  The color code makes it easier to tell the different sizes quickly pick out the ones you know you need.  The case holds everything nice and neat.  Even comes with a cute little hair apron.</li>
    <li> Really NOISY. Not recommended at all.</li>
    <li> Does not make a lot of noise, works better then my old one. The guards seem to be made of good plastic.  The drape that comes with it is stupid, but I didn&#x27;t buy it b/c it came with a cover - the clippers are doing their  job.</li>
    <li> Awesome value! High quality and easy to use! Made in USA! I&#x27;ve had mine over a year and have had no issues.</li>
    <li> Recieved this and very impressed by it.  It would be great for beginners as well because everything is easily marked to be read</li>
    <li> It is very easy to use... after using it I think no proffetional require to give u a very good hair style....only thing you need to read the pumplate which you receive with machine and yiu are ready to go....</li>
    <li> Best clipper I ever had - works great to trim beard</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Wahl Hair Cutting Unit for as long as a can remember. My First and only one was giving to me as a Gift when I was very Young, and ever since I learned to cut my own Hair and still works. I was surprised to see that every Black Guide Comb I have used for years on my Old Hair Cutting Machine, I can also use and they work on this New Wahl Haircutting Unit, the New Ones are really Nice and Colorful. Wahl Home Pro 26-Piece Color-Coded Haircutting System is a Nice one and Full of Stuff, it comes with everything you can think of to cut Hair, besides the Powerful Unit with Soft Touch Grip that is very Comfortable to Grab and Hold, 13 Color Guide Combs, Scissors, Hair Clips, Combs, Eat Trim Guide, Eyebrow Trim Guide, Cleaning Brush, Neck Duster, Cape ...and so much More, everything in one Storage Case with Instructions in English and Spanish. I like how it feels on my hand the same way my Old One does not too Heavy and easy to work with. Wahl Haircutting System has a very Strong Motor yet its very Quiet, I also like the Fact that is Made in the USA! ...Thank You D.D.</li>
    <li> A nice heavy and quality set of clippers for a good value!</li>
    <li> My haircuts are getting more successful every time, the color coding and instructions are a big help.</li>
    <li> Awesome set. Very good quality and easy to use. I use this every two weeks to shave my head. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Super powerful! Very easy to use and the kit fits anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended (I&#x27;ve had several other brands, and this one is certainly the best one yet!)</li>
    <li> very surprised that this did not cut my hair because I have an old Wahl and it still cuts my hair way better than this new clipper.  I was very surprised and I am not really all that impressed with it.</li>
    <li> The blade is just not sharp enough.  Does not give a good cut.</li>
    <li> Works great! Cuts hair evenly with only one pass. The color coded tabs are easy to use and whether you are using it to trim hair or give a full haircut, I could not be happier with this product.</li>
    <li> Cuts my husband&#x27;s hair great. The color coordinated clippers are great and everything fits into the case wonderfully. Definitely worth the money</li>
    <li> These clipper a great.  Wahl brand clipper generally are.  Powerful enough to get through my thick hair, just remember to keep them oiled</li>
    <li> $20 bucks for a hair cut every time or buy this and it pays for it self after two uses. I don&#x27;t do a fancy cut but for me short hair is what I wanted and it works great</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve always used top of the line clippers but ours were over 20 years old so decided to try this one because of the price and variety of guides.  We only used 2 guides but our biggest thrill was how easy and quick this cut went for a 6 year old who can&#x27;t sit still.  He just looked awesome after about 7 minutes and we had minimal scissor trim at the end. The graduated guides would be nice but unnecessary with this kid.  We started with the biggest and went down to  the seven for variation on the sides.  We took off enough hair to cover 3 or 4 boys his age.  Perfect summer cut! We are super happy!!  Thank you Wahl.</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Has the length chart handy on the handle. Easy to clean.</li>
    <li> awesome, easy to use and clean….light weight and easy to handle</li>
    <li> This kit is great. I&#x27;ve been using it for awhile now to cut my own hair and other people&#x27;s hair. I&#x27;m not a professional, but I sometimes feel like one when I use this set. The smock is basically a garbage bag with a string, but hey--I was in it for the affordable clippers so I don&#x27;t think it really matters that the smock is so cheap. The quality of all the other pieces in the set makes it well worth it.</li>
    <li> It is really loud. Too loud to even use.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if it is because I&#x27;m in Australia and using the adapter plug and no transformer, but we haven&#x27;t been able to use it yet.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised! It is a solidly build set of clippers and it seems to do the job! The color coded numbered guards do make it easier to use.</li>
    <li> I got this item supposedly &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; i thought it would be new considering it showed no signs of it being opened. Well i was WRONG. The clippers clearly were used because they had hair in them and some of the attachments were out side the air sealed bag. So im assuming this was a &amp;#34;refurbished&amp;#34; set! NOT HAPPY considering i paid alot more so i could have a NEW one! Its too late to send it back as i needed to cut my boys hair for thanksgiving so i used it anyhow after sterilizing it.</li>
    <li> Great for family savings on haircuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clipper work great (we have used many pairs in the past).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set is well worth the few bucks over the bargain models.</li>
    <li> I did my own buzz cut with this product using the number 2 guide.  I found it easy to use and produced good results the first time.</li>
    <li> I got this a while back to save money on haircuts for my boys and husband and I&#x27;m still using them. I&#x27;m not a professional hairstylist but did grow up watching my grandma and cousin who are and this kit is the prefect kit to start learning how to cut boys and mens hair. Has everything you need!</li>
    <li> Works like a charm.  Brought it around 5 months back and used it around 8 times. It&#x27;s a good product to purchase, value for money.</li>
    <li> Worked better than I expected. After 2cuts it will have paid for it.self. my only gripe is that the guides only go up to 1inch. Ihad to buy the 1.5 inch guide seperately.I. will need some practise, but that&#x27;s ok</li>
    <li> The clippers work  fine, no complaints with the attachments, however, we paid the extra five dollars or so to get this kit rather than just buying the clippers on its own because it comes with a cape. The cape is very, very thin plastic.... literally the equivalent of a dollar store plastic table cloth. If you are looking at this kit just for the cape, skip it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE: I removed one star from my previous 3-star rating because the clippers are already failing. It&#x27;s been treated carefully, cleaned after each use and oiled according to recomendations. I&#x27;ve had it 18 months and used it only to give haircuts to my 3 boys and husband every 3 months or even longer between. At the most it&#x27;s been used for 25 haircuts and now many hairs slip through rather than being cut, indicating it is dull. A hairdresser friend told me it&#x27;d be the same cost (or more expensive) to pay to have it sharpened as it would be to just replace the equipment. Will be looking for something better this time around.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my hubby and he loves them! Heavy duty and easy to use. Well crafted and a great set!</li>
    <li> I think I could recommend this one everything you could want in clippers the only thing you don&#x27;t get is oil to grease it and the combs are crappy quality straight out of china I think. other than that the clippers are descent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of Wahl products for some time.  I just needed a trimmer to keep my beard in shape with plenty of guard options.  I chose this product because I had one similar before but gave it to a barber friend that could use it more than I needed it at the time.  I&#x27;ve used it to cut my own hair in a buzz cut but primarily use it to keep my beard tidy.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is a brand that I&#x27;m very familiar with and have used for years.  This combination package was a great buy, but the clippers only worked for a short while.  The accessories are great and offer a wide range of personal grooming options at a great price, but the major component of the set is what failed for me.  I was disappointed and bought another one that has since worked fine. I would recommend this product with caution and a hope that future ones do not fail like mine did.</li>
    <li> I usually cut my partner and my son&#x27;s hair. They both like their hair short and with up to 1 inch attachment, I can get the result in minutes. It is easy to use. I didn&#x27;t even need to read the instruction.</li>
    <li> It was perfect for my needs. Husband also loves them. great deal for price. I would recommend them .Read the book and my husband got a full cut like the barbers.</li>
    <li> My son  was very impressed  with this item, according  to him, its a nice  set. This was  a good buy.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and works great.</li>
    <li> Purchased these to save money on my son&#x27;s hair cuts. He needs a cut every 4 weeks, and, at $13 a pop, it was getting expensive.  So I bought these and prayed I wouldn&#x27;t leave a patch in my son&#x27;s hair.  They are very easy to use, give great tips for the at home barber, and are well worth the cost.  We&#x27;ve been using them for over a year, and every time I cut my son&#x27;s hair, I say cha-ching!</li>
    <li> buy this product for the trimmer, but don&#x27;t expect to be impressed by the shears. they are really horrible. shears work great even on my 15month old toddler. runs quietly</li>
    <li> I received a used item.  The clippers had hair in them and one of the combs was not in the bag, it was in free in the case.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my husband, but he has not opened the box yet. My husband said, he had a similar set to this particular brand and it worked well, he wanted to upgrade a little... Stay tuned for further update on this set.</li>
    <li> Awesome!!!  Great buy!!!</li>
    <li> I actually like these clippers. I bought a set from Costco and they sucked. I used them for three years and then when I moved threw them away because I they just made me angry. By comparison these are great. The guides are a bit cheaply made, so be careful with them, but otherwise cuts very nice</li>
    <li> You get exactly what you ask for. This is a quality set that gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Great for keeping my hair nicely shaved.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly. Great, even, smooth cut everytime.</li>
    <li> good quality and American made</li>
    <li> Great clipper for the price</li>
    <li> Good value, but has some items that hurt it. The &amp;#34;cape&amp;#34; is not nylon but plastic - really thin plastic, like a cheap garbage bag. I think it will last 3-5 uses if we&#x27;re lucky. The clippers are excellent, the guides are many and work well. The carry case is excellent, though if it were a little larger it would have been more useful as a brush might have fit inside. Overall it worth the money without a doubt!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a Wahl, you cant go wrong. Solid construction, just works, works, works. Great product, never been disappointed with this brand I own a couple of their products.</li>
    <li> I love this clipper kit. It has worked beautifully! I know I can always depend on Wahl to produce great products that will last a long time.</li>
    <li> My husband is a very out doorsy guy. He really likes this for keeping his hair easy to trim. This runs quietly and works in a short time. So it is easy for him to keep up his grooming.</li>
    <li> It does the job. It makes A LOT of noise. Love that it included all of the attachments for hair length.</li>
    <li> This kit is a great start up kit and has most things you will need  The clippers dont heat up at all and have some power behind them  The clippers come with a  guard chart on it to make it a great easy way to learn the number  The only thing i dont like about this kit is the neck duster  it is very uncomfortable and if you can spare 10$ id recomend getting a new one</li>
    <li> Color coded, cleverly packaged, and easy to use!&lt;br /&gt;This product saves me and my boyfriend so much money! I love all the extra accessories it comes with!</li>
    <li> Does not work properly and can be very noisy.Certainly not suitable for a 50 cycle environment. Its seem to be a boys&#x27; toy.</li>
    <li> nice cuts. 2 bad things tho, not cordless and it is heavy. Overall Great product.</li>
    <li> would defiantly tell anyone to get this item very easy to use has all attachments and can&#x27;t beat the price very pleased with purchase</li>
    <li> This is a very \\&quot;old style\\&quot; hair cutter, metalic, heavy, and no fancy stuff at all, but it does good jobs.</li>
    <li> I only used this product once so far, but it seems sturdy and well built.  The product feels solid in my hand and everything seems to move nicely.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the performance of the product.  Provides all necessary tools to cut my hair and cuts very well and smoothly.</li>
    <li> I have cut my own hair for the past four years. I&#x27;ve owned two other haircutting sets, and used two others that my roommates owned as well. None of these others had the ease of cutting and options of length quite like this Wahl set has. I never have to worry about the trimmer slowing down during use (as I have thick hair). Also, I really like cutting my hair very short. This set has a 1/8\\&quot; guard, which is shorter than some other sets I have owned.    If you buzz your head, this set is well worth the money that you will save from paying for haircuts.</li>
    <li> Bought this because I was sick of paying $25 for a super simple hair cut.  Can do my own hair in about 10 minutes.  I dont style my hair what so ever so a simple buzz cut is perfect!  Clipper works fantastic, zero complaints!!</li>
    <li> Just about the same price as in the stores, but has already paid for itself by saving myself trips to the barber shop, great investment!</li>
    <li> I used these for a months until I switched to the best clippers ever: http://amzn.to/1K8KQ4B</li>
    <li> Good quality; does the job.</li>
    <li> As described works well but look around first can find it cheaper else where.</li>
    <li> This was advertised as new, but when I recieved the clippers, these were clearly already used, and had someone else&#x27;s hair in the box. I put up with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But now, 6 only about 6 months later, these started to malfunction, and wouldn&#x27;t turn on sometimes. Fast forward a few more days, and these stopped working altogether.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money for something better, and pay a little more.</li>
    <li> Cuts hair really well and the color coded helps a lot</li>
    <li> I bought this clipper set for my boyfriend and he loves it! It has great power and just feels good in the hands. It feels nice and sturdy. No problems thus far with it!</li>
    <li> Exactly kind of product, I was looking for. This comes with multiple options of clippers and very easy to use.</li>
    <li> Clippers work great.  My daughter cuts my hair and saves me the time and money of going to the barber</li>
    <li> I was a little worried about how good this product would work for the price I paid. Im a believer in the phrase, You get what you paid for. However, not only did it arrive quickly, but it works better than any of the other razors I&#x27;ve owned before. Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> This product was one of the best buys I could have made.  My husband is in the State Guard and needs to have his hair cut every other week these clipper are wonderful!  The price was great and we have had no problems using them and we have saved so much money by me giving him his hair cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clippers have so many attachments to selecting a size and they have worked really good.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend these clippers to anyone thinking of purchasing them.</li>
    <li> We bought these clippers to cut my husband&#x27;s hair this summer.  We have already used it and love it. It is a little better than him going bald.</li>
    <li> I just bought this to shave my head and beard.  And it works very well the color coded guards are nice and easy to memorize.  The only down side is that with no guards it can be sharp and sometimes pulls the hair instead of cutting.</li>
    <li> I go through phases where I just want to buzz my hair and not have to deal with it. This product comes with plenty of choices and options in terms of accessories. Every length comb is clearly marked by number (2, 3, 4, etc..), inches and is color coordinated according to a chart that comes included. It also comes with a scissors, oil, combs and an apron. This is the second Wahl I have owned and I like this one better because it comes in a hard plastic case where as my last one came in a soft zipper case. A very good unit for the price. It gets the job done every time!</li>
    <li> Works well...beats paying $20 x2 each month for a hair cut. Easy to use and I&#x27;d recommend them. Goo price too.</li>
    <li> This is quite the bargain.  Everything is inside and the quality is quite good.  I would recommend this even if you have never cut hair before.</li>
    <li> I use this gadget for grooming my two little critters (dogs), about every 6 weeks. It works pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;My wife gives me a trim hair cut every 2 months with this also.</li>
    <li> After years of complaining that no one cuts my husband&#x27;s hair right, I decided to take matters in my own hands. I constantly showed pictures and went into detail on how to cut his hair. Every time they would cut a one inch up too far giving a mohawk effect. We even went to expensive salons to no avail. I am very please with how much this kit came with. Very worth the money! I didn&#x27;t need to purchase a pair of scissors. The directions are easy to read and very details. The colors for each clipper size is very helpful. I was very please with how sharp the blades are. My husbands first hair cut turned out very well. Only down side is the hair cape is flimsy and doesn&#x27;t work well. I honesty didn&#x27;t mind enough to give one less star. Would recommend! Save money and time.</li>
    <li> I cut my own hair and I am blind as a bat without my glasses.  The different colors are a big help when I am switching sizes.  The build of the trimmer is as god as any I have used in the past, and so far the cord design has prevented it from twirling.</li>
    <li> I have been using this since December to shave my husbands head and it works really well. Good quality. Why pay more?</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a while for one of these clippers; and when I saw this one Wahl with color Coded combs, I just had to buy it.  I was very hesitant to do my husbands hair; putting it off for many weeks, but finally the time came.  After carefully reading and re-reading the instructions which came with it, I started.........I was very pleasantly surprised!!!  The product is wonderful, and by following the step by step instructions, I was able to give him the perfect haircut, on the first try.  This is truly a gem to own, and very very easy to use.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Easty to use.  I had a cheaper hair clipper and it left my husbands hair uneven and after jamming once, was even worse.  Decided to invest in Wahl and am very happy with the product. Trimmed up the uneven hair and was easy to use. The feel of the clipper is great too.  Would again invest in Wahl products.</li>
    <li> I keep my hair very short so these clippers work very well.</li>
    <li> Great product and fast shipping. Used it twice already - very satisfied and impressed with the power and overall performance. It&#x27;s a well made product with some heft and seems very durable. Easy to use and color coded. Nice.</li>
    <li> It is hard for my husband to get out for haircuts. When we a asked a couple of friends about home hair cutting products, WAHL is the&lt;br /&gt;name they recommended.  We are not disappointed.  I was able to give him a pretty good haircut the first time.  The directions were clear and the color coding is helpful.  It looks like we are on our way to staying groomed and saving money.  Thanks WAHL!</li>
    <li> I bought these to cut my Husband&#x27;s and Toddler&#x27;s hair in the summer. I couldn&#x27;t see spending all the money at the salon to get a buzz cut. I had never used clippers before but found a nice tutorial and the set came with a book with instructions as well. It took a few tries but my guys have salon quality (ok...almost salon quality) haircuts compliments of Mommy at home!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note: my toddler LOVES to have his hair cut by Mommy, these clippers are not extremely loud and I&#x27;ve never had trouble with them getting hot, even if my husband goes first.</li>
    <li> Very good product. I recommend it, especially since this appliance is manufactured in USA and not made in CHINA and although I am not a U.S. citizen and I am not living in the U.S., I always prefer to support American industry.</li>
    <li> Worth every penny after the first time I used it!</li>
    <li> My old clippers had quit and I ordered this set and it is or flu and cuts right through.  I have cut my husbands hair in a military cut for 20 years and these clippers are great.</li>
    <li> good set.  Works as advertised- just make sure you unpack the case and don&#x27;t try to cram all the attachments in there together, because I bent the big one and it no longer works correctly.</li>
    <li> I like all the pieces, especially that it includes the brush for loose hair. Well known name brand. It saves me a lot of money at the barber shop.</li>
    <li> Really good product, just buy it for what i need it..!! Nice color and everything judt great, should buy from this guys, did great job. One of the best buy i ever made in history of Amazon</li>
    <li> Had it for over a year and it&#x27;s saved me hundreds in hair cuts. Easy to use and a great investment! Especially for the price!</li>
    <li> I purchased this set for my two year old son whose hair grows so fast that he needs a haircut every week.  It could get very expensive keeping up with a nice haircut for him.  Now my husband cuts his hair every week and the clippers work wonderfully.  Love the color coding; makes it easy to use.  My son is getting professional looking haircuts right at home.</li>
    <li> This kit is great. It lets you know which clipper to use for what hair cut you want. My son has saved $15.00 on his hair cut by using the clipper kit. I saved $26.00 using this system. It&#x27;s really great.</li>
    <li> Works very well, color coded combs make it easy to set up for beard trimming. Very nice kit. Quiet running.</li>
    <li> The product twice came with hair in the trimmers. I read a reviewer stating that her clippers had been used, but I dismissed it as a fluke. However, I was surprised to find hairs in the original pair of clippers that came and the then again with the replacement pair. The second time it seemed too much bother to return them yet again, so my husband I used alcohol to thoroughly clean them. They seem to work well. I would have preferred for the item description to say they are used. And of course to have them properly cleaned without hair.</li>
    <li> Very good product.  The clippers are very easy to hold and use.  A good variety of attachments is also included.</li>
    <li> It is wonderful tools. I was very satisfied. Some utility and accessary are also good.</li>
    <li> Works just as I had hoped it would, and the color-keyed attachments take the guess-work out of selecting the appropriate one for desired length.  Comfortable to hold and substantial (not cheap) feeling.</li>
    <li> Not the best quality but I did get use out of it. I think if I would have gotten a different model that was meant for a lot more sue then I&#x27;d be happier. It sadly wasn&#x27;t cutting it for me when it came to weekly hair cuts for my husband, even after cleaning it and using the lubricant.</li>
    <li> I got these for my 15 year old stepson as he wants to be a barber so he is practicing on his friends with these and he really likes them and has not had a problem. He has been saving up the money he&#x27;s making from it. There have been no complaints yet and he has used them... ALOT!!!!</li>
    <li> Used for the first time yesterday and the cut looks professional.  The color system was easy to understand and the directions were superb.  The price of the clippers is great as I normally pay more for one cut.  The convenience of being able to do it at my leisure will allow me to keep a much cleaner look.  Amazon Prime is wonderful and of coarse the product was on-time and not damaged.  Noise level was less than I expected and better than most plug in clippers i have seen.</li>
    <li> First of all, If you don&#x27;t have Amazon Prime GET IT!!! I got this in like 2 days. Very very impressed with how fast shipping was. This Wahl clipper is just flawless, Has everything you need and cuts like a pro. It&#x27;s a must have for anyone.</li>
    <li> Was looking for clippers that were affodable and cut smoothly. These hit the spot. My other clippers were pulling the hair. It would take me 20-30 min to do my husbands practicaly shaved head cut. These cliipers took me 5 minutes. Now it&#x27;s not a chore to cut my husband&#x27;s hair and I think I will brave doing my son&#x27;s hair now.</li>
    <li> definatly worth the money, it seems pretty heavy duty and works great, the case is kinda flimsy but its a nice product</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  The clippers will NOT tug and yank your hair as they are plenty sharp.  The guides that go on the clippers really make the process a no-brainer!</li>
    <li> Great value, this is my second purchase of this model Wahl. The first lasted about 9 years. I dropped and broke a couple of the teeth on the blade. Cheaper to replace than fix. Like the energy bunny it just keeps going and going, a great buy for the money.</li>
    <li> Used the clippers as soon as they came in, great set very quiet as far as clippers go, comes with everything you need just make sure you keep it oiled after every 3 uses.</li>
    <li> Works just like the ones at the barber shop. Sorry Mr Barber. Now my wife can cut my hair as well as you can!</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Makes cutting my husbands hair a snap.</li>
    <li> they do not cut hair as expected,,terrible set of clippers</li>
    <li> I just got to use these on my husband and I love them, they are sharp so no tugging on his hair (Ouch!) they come with a guide to show you the lengths, he already knew his sizes but they&#x27;re great for someone who knows nothing about hair clippers</li>
    <li> I gave it as a gift to my husband and it works great! My husband was very pleased with it . I recommend it for anyone</li>
    <li> works just like i expected it too no issues no problems. For the price i paid its worth the money.</li>
    <li> By far one of the best purchases I ever made. A HUGE money saver. The variety of lengths and shapes of attachments allows you to cut your hair in just about any fashion, with ease, and quickly. It runs very smoothly, is not too loud, and is pretty ergonomic to fit your hand. The only complaint I could come up with is that sometimes the teeth of the attachments can get slightly malaligned while on the clippers, but even the manual will warn you of this and all you do is flick it with your finger and it snaps back into place. Other than that these clippers are magic and saving me a butt load of money</li>
    <li> I received this item after waiting a few weeks. Upon opening the package it looked as if the items were all stuffed back in the package. When I got the trimmer out there was hair on it! This was supposed to be a brand new item I was paying for .. not something that had been used before! I Don&#x27;t appreciate the fact that Amazon was trying to pass off a used item to me as a NEW items. Very dishonest. DO NOT BUY! Also when contacting a customer service representative on-line through chat, he told me he was sorry, entered a link, and then jumped out of the chat! Not great customer service!</li>
    <li> Been using this to cut my own hair for the past several years. The kit has many options and haw help up very well.</li>
    <li> This set has everything you need to get started cutting hair. Everything works well and the storage box is useful for keeping all of the accessories organized.</li>
    <li> I will order this prduct again meets my needs</li>
    <li> So far so good. Cuts great with guards on, but when I tried to shave his side burns off, without a guard it didn&#x27;t take all the hair off</li>
    <li> every thing in here is of use to me and to cut my dads hair. very nice combs, nice set of plastic guards just be careful were you put them my size 7 broke 0_o edit: didnt last long dropped it and couldnt be fixed, get better more quality if serious of cutting hair or cut hair often</li>
    <li> I have not been able to use because the volts are different in europe :/&lt;br /&gt;but looks very good !</li>
    <li> The Wahl Color Pro Hair Clipper is much more than a set of clippers. Found it very useful  for trimming unwanted body hair as well as just right for hair cutting with either hand. Now that is a handy item  and definitely becomes a money-saver personally or for the entire family. This clipper is also light and balanced with easy reaching the tough spots for young and older heads. The quality is there...with top flight construction and electric motor, plus an affordable price. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase and would recommend it to one and all. Frank Giardino</li>
    <li> these clippers are really good and affordable. i didnt think they would work as well since i got a good deal on them but they work very well. they have pleny of attachment to go with them and they also have a guide to show you what you are doing just in case you dont know</li>
    <li> I bought this to save money on haircuts since I just wear a crew cut.  The cutters worked pretty good for the first year, but performance rapidly declined after that.  The cutters must have dulled out quickly or something because it likes to rip the hair instead of cut it.  It takes over 20 minutes going over the same spot multiple times to get a haircut now, and there are always lots of long hairs left over.  Noise doesn&#x27;t bother me...or my set was not as noisy as everyone else&#x27;s.  I would highly recommend spending a little more money and investing in a set of something more tailored to professionals like the Oster Classic 76 clippers instead.</li>
    <li> This was purchased for my son and he&#x27;s quite happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Just make sure you know how to use it</li>
    <li> 2nd one of these have owned, last one gave up the ghost after 21 years,new one greatly advanced</li>
    <li> Product just as described and works great. We don&#x27;t use it that often, but when we do, it does it&#x27;s job.</li>
    <li> This thing isnt sharp enough to trim my beard!! When i try to trim it, it feel like hair gets stuck between the blades and pulls it instead of trimming. Piss*s me off!</li>
    <li> I ordered an open box item of these&amp;it was still 2 day ship for prime,but they nevr had sent  &amp;#34;now shipped email etc?&amp;#34;so i e-mailed amazon few days latr&amp;they said it was NOT IN STOCK??yet it said open box available on the site?what gives i asked&amp;the lady said it was not available lol.so she apologized&amp; said i get an additional $5 OFF PLUS 1 DAY SHIP?&amp;remember it was already an OPEN BOX item?marked @$23-$25 ish!wow awesome deal.cut quality was very good&amp;clean!also these are VERY QUIET!the most silent trimmers i&#x27;ve ever owned!it&#x27;s also a 25-26 piece kit too!i like how ea. attachment is a different color//makes it so easy to kno which you are using!even a hair plastic cover/bib is included!great clippers&amp;excellent variety of attachments!no damaged parts-except case has small 3inch gash in it.but its open box ok/no worries lol.love these trimmers!worth every penny.def recommend these. my 3rd pr of Wahl clippers.they do last quite a long time!always been my fave brand...good long warranty too</li>
    <li> Works Great!  The color coding makes it easier too. I use these to cut my son&#x27;s hair all the time.</li>
    <li> The clippers are easy to operate.  The &amp;#34;ON/OFF&amp;#34; button is different but easy enough to toggle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cord is heavy duty and limited in range.  So chasing down an anxious kid can be a challenge at times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clippers come with a wide variety of sizes.  It disappointed me to find out that the 1&amp;#34; attachment is the largest one included.  I had hoped to have 1.5&amp;#34; and 2&amp;#34; attachments.</li>
    <li> This is the best hairclipper we have ever bought! Plenty of different settings for shorter to longer lengths</li>
    <li> This clipper set is very good for the price ! If your new or well versed in cutting hair these clippers will be a great tool and the kit it comes with for the price is a steal if a deal</li>
    <li> I bought this set primarily to cut my 94 year old mother&#x27;s hair. Without it, I was having a hard time layering the shorter areas of her hair with scissors. This set completely solved the problem. My second subject was my husband. He was really happy with the haircut, and it saved him $10. My first haircut on my husband took only 15 minutes. If you are new to cutting hair, there are quite a few videos on youtube.com that will help to get you started., It really is easy, and the set will save you time and money. It will more than pay for itself with 3 haircuts.</li>
    <li> this was the best purchase i have made so far on amazon. these clippers are truly professional and comes with a lot for a great price. highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Came earlier than expected.  Ordered this second set for my son because he liked mine so much.  He loves it!!!!  Thank you !!!! Oh, and my husband really likes his too!  This kit has everything you need in it!</li>
    <li> convenient, even can do it by myself</li>
    <li> Good for bearded men also</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;I&#x27;m not as impressed as I hoped I would be&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;-My girlfriend when asked&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She cuts my hair every two weeks, and I got her these to replace the pair I got from Walmart years ago on the cheep.&lt;br /&gt;While they do their job, they don&#x27;t cut as well as we had hoped.</li>
    <li> Love it fast shipping thanks</li>
    <li> I have been cutting my husband&#x27;s hair for years and was using an older Wahl clippers from my grandpa that wasn&#x27;t working the best anymore.  We used this for the first time tontie and we LOVE it.  Did such a great job!!</li>
    <li> If you are planning on cutting your boyfriends hair (or your boyfriend asks you to cut his hair even though you have NO idea what you&#x27;re doing) get this kit. It is inexpensive but super high quality. It comes with all of the necessary attachments and a really great instruction booklet (although I just watched a youtube video) and made it super easy to cut my boyfriend&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> Has everything you need to cut hair. Even comes with  step by step instructions on cutting hair. Works great. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I finally got my own clipper kit after using my in-laws&#x27; older version for so long.&lt;br /&gt;I love this thing! I shave my hair and let it grow out, do side cuts, mohawks, buzz cuts or whatever strikes me at the time. This thing is powerful, fairly quite, easy to manage, doesn&#x27;t tug on hair, it&#x27;s comfortable in my hand and it all comes together in a small carrying case.&lt;br /&gt;I got all pieces listed too, which is nice.</li>
    <li> This clipper set is a great, high quality clipper system for the price.  I have been cutting family hair and my hair for over 40 years.  This is one of the best versions of the Wahl units that I have used.</li>
    <li> This thing works great! Now that we cut hair at home it&#x27;s well than already paid for itself. Especially a must if the boys in your house have hair that grows fast!</li>
    <li> The scissors included suck, but the clippers work great.</li>
    <li> I had several clipper kits over the years, and this one is the best by far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Real good quality clipper that doesn&#x27;t feel cheap at all.  Variety of attachments has been very useful, and the brush is a nice touch.</li>
    <li> I have been cutting my own hair for about 40 years. They may not be great haircuts but no one has ever noticed or mentioned my haircuts. I have been through a number of these kits. The clippers never go bad, you just lose or break the attachments. This kit had the most adapters and I found that I can get the best looking cut with this set. The attachments are cheap. You will have to be careful with them. The Wahl clipper will last forever. I read that others complained of how loud these are. Not so. They are normal. I can&#x27;t help but think those (amateurs) haven&#x27;t tweaked the little screws on the clipper that stop that loud rattle noise that clippers sometimes slip into. A drop of oil (included) works wonders too.</li>
    <li> Happy with this item! Mines was a bit noisy I had to open it ND place a sponge on the motor and now you can&#x27;t even tell if it&#x27;s on... Perfect buy I recommend this I cut my own hair and even my friends hair</li>
    <li> My son and i no longer pay for hair cuts! Exactly what we needed to get the job done and more.</li>
    <li> Lots of attachments for everything you want to use this for</li>
    <li> This is the best hair clipper I have found for a decent price. The kit has every thing you need.</li>
    <li> This clipper set looks and sounds nice, Not the case. It is no differant than any other cheap clipper you can get at walmart. This clipper will last no longer than a year if You use it a couple times a month. I have been using clippers for many many years and have learned that you get what you pay for. Last time I used these They cut my scalp in two places. No joke. If you want a good clipper that last stay away from magnetic motors. I recomend The Fast feed by oster. This clipper is a big step up for about 15.00 20.00 bucks more.</li>
    <li> This hair clipper kit is great for cutting any hair you throw at it! In just one week of owning this product I have shaved my sons head, given a haircut to my father, and cleaned up the local ally cats to look a bit more presentable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This kit comes with everything I would need to start my own cat salon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No regrets on this purchase!</li>
    <li> Love the assortment of guards!  Easy to use and fits great in my hand. Not loud and cuts the hair.</li>
    <li> HAVENT TRIED IT YET EXCEPT ON ARM HAIR.  CUTS CLOSE AND PERFECT.  NEGATIVE &#x3D; BULKY, STIFF CORD AND DIFFICULT TO CONTROL.  IN THE HANDS OF AN EXPERIENCED BARBER IT IS PROBABLY FINE.  I&#x27;M GOING TO USE IT TO REPLACE MY WAHL BATTERY POWERED TRIMMER WHO&#x27;S CUTTING EDGES HAVE GONE DULL TO TRIM MY MUSTASH AND EYEBROWS.  A PRETTY GOOD PRODUCT ALL IN ALL.</li>
    <li> Perfect for what I needed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a year now. This product is a great time and money saver. I use to go to one of those no appointment haircut places but you&#x27;d never know how long you&#x27;ll have to wait until you got there. Sometimes I&#x27;d wait for 5 minutes and other times for an hour. Plus, they really raised their prices. I then decided to purchase this product figuring if I got a few haircuts from this that it would pay for itself. My wife viewed a video and then she cut my hair. I had some time off work so I figured this would be a good time to try it in case something went wrong. We started out long and then shortened it up as she got better. She got the hang of it quickly so it&#x27;s been great not having to make the trip to the haircut place for a year. The haircuts don&#x27;t last as long as when I went to the haircut place but this is okay since it&#x27;s very easy to cut and clean up.    Pros: Color coded is easy to remember, Blades cut well, easy storage, saves time and money, price  Cons: On/off is a little stiff, a little loud but not real bad, still need a beard trimmer for some spots around the ears and to even the side burns</li>
    <li> My cousin use to cut my hair, but moved a bit further away so its harder to see him so I bought this for my girlfriend to cut my hair. She ended up being to scared to cut my hair, thinking she&#x27;d mess up my hair so I cut my own hair now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say it is a great set of hair clippers, especially for the price. It comes with more than I need. The unit has good power, it&#x27;s sharp, and it feels solid in the hand. The left and right tapered clipper guides help out a lot when cutting on the non-dominant handed side of my head. I should have gotten the set with the small hand mirror to look at the back of my head, but this set is still pretty awesome.</li>
    <li> Most of the reason I got this full set instead of just the trimmer was for the &#x27;cape,&#x27; which is literally a garbage back with a neck on it. Love the trimmer, but the cape is a joke.&lt;br /&gt;Super easy to use, this was the first time I buzzed my own hair and it looks great,&lt;br /&gt;not too loud like my brother&#x27;s cheap trimmer</li>
    <li> Worked well enough at first, cut smoothly. After about 4 uses hair had become clogged in the clipper blades, in between plastic bits and in the groove of the adjusting handle. Used a brush to get them loose, turned the clippers back on, and then they popped. Now broken and smelling like burned plastic</li>
    <li> Excellent trimmer. Plenty of attachments all most to many. Great for the price.  The trimmer is strong and doesn&#x27;t feel cheap</li>
    <li> I love the carrying case and all of the accessories that come with it. Seems like a hearty clipper that will last a long time. Haven&#x27;t had any issues using it so far!</li>
    <li> This is a great hair clipping kit. The color coded system was very useful. The kit was very reasonably priced and arrived quickly. I only wish it would have come with a more organized case to be able to separate the pieces where it is not all thrown in together. Seems to cut well and I love the added ear and eyebrow guards.</li>
    <li> Great clippers, great case.  Everything you need is included.  Take decent care of them, and they&#x27;re bound to last a lifetime.</li>
    <li> We have had any number of hair cutting sets that we have purchased over the years.  This is the best by far.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed. The motor of the clipper makes such a load noise that it cannot be used at all.</li>
    <li> great value for money</li>
    <li> Super they work great</li>
    <li> is a great shaver, very easy to use and blades are of good quality, all accessories are very useful, I can easily shave myself, Greetings from Caracas, Venezuela. I am a faithful consumer of wahl.</li>
    <li> Great blades get the job done quickly and efficiently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I owned a pair of ConAir for the past 6 years.  It was finally time to upgrade it and found these as a best seller.  Lucky me, the reviews do not lie.&lt;br /&gt;The product arrived quickly and as displayed in the image.  I bundled this with the 3310-230 Wahl Blade Oil Professional Blade Maintenance because the one included in the set is just a starter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like how simple the whole thing is.  I shave my head once every two weeks, I found these much smoother and quieter then the ConAirs.  The clippers are light and do not feel awkward in your hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oddly enough, I like how the adapters are color coded...the two brushes are a nice addition.&lt;br /&gt;The scissors are questionable but you could probably get some use out of them for around the ears.&lt;br /&gt;The two large clips work well, the wife uses them&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers</li>
    <li> Makes hell lot of noise. It&#x27;s like holding a trumpet in my hand. I&#x27;d certainly not recommend it. And, power adjustment screw is of no use just like the trimmer. It doesn&#x27;t cut hairs without a pull. This device needs critical work on design boards.</li>
    <li> i LOVE THIS ITEM, AS AN AMATEUR TO HAIR CUTTING, IT WAS VERY SIMPLE TO UNDERSTAND THE INSTRUCTIONS AND THE RESULT i RECIEVED FROM CUTTING MY SON HAIR WAS AMAZING. IT IS NOT NOISY SO MY SON WAS REALLY CALM DURING THE WHOLE PROCESS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH!!</li>
    <li> Great overall product! Everything I needed. I had a while looking for something similar and I am glad I found the right one!</li>
    <li> All the pieces were accounted for. No shipping damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only time will tell how durable it is, but I&#x27;ve already cut my hair once and it works perfectly.</li>
    <li> i like the colour coded combs, easy to recognize and remember. i&#x27;m just wondering if anyone is using the comb for eyebrows</li>
    <li> The first time I used the clippers the number 4 size attachment snapped because it was to small to fit. All the others seem to fit fine though. Its an alright job of cutting.</li>
    <li> I bought this so that I could cut my husband&#x27;s hair. He was going to a local hair shop and dropping $20 every 3-4 weeks. He has very little hair, but it grows fast. The shop itself was unclean, so that was the main reason I decided to cut his hair. Since he knew the guide numbers his former stylist used (2 and 3), that was a huge help in deciding which ones to use to cut his hair. His hair is fine and sparse, and he likes it cut very short - almost like a military cut. I *think* the clipper kit was supposed to come with a video, but it didn&#x27;t so I logged on to YouTube and watched several hair cutting videos including ones specifically detailing using the Wahl clipper. After my education, I got to work on my first haircut which turned out stellar. My husband really liked it, and I have to say not only was it easy, it was fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be safe, I started out using the number 3 guide, which cuts the hair a bit longer. As always, start out by cutting less hair. You can always cut more as you go along. Once you have a feel for the guide you&#x27;re using, it will be very easy to decide whether to go up or down a number. The number 3 guide helped me to get a feel for how the clipper performs, as well as the technique I should use. As the videos suggest, always use a rocking motion when running the guide through the hair. Never push down or allow the guide to settle in one place too long. Always keep it moving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guides with higher numbers leave the hair longer. Guides with lower numbers are great for shorter haircuts. Again, if you want the hair to be very short, guides 2 and 3 are perfect. Also, to fine tune a straight edge along the back above the neck, you can use the clipper without any guide combs attached. I believe there is also an attachment for around the ears, but I used the clipper sans guides for that as well. So far with just 2 haircuts, this thing has pretty much paid for itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clipper is a bit heavier as other reviewers have commented, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me. I don&#x27;t consider it noisy. The on/off switch is solid, and you&#x27;ll hear a resounding *click* each time you turn it on and off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A wonderful purchase to be sure. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This one is far better than the cheap one we bought before. My husbands hair looks great and it has all the pieces I need to make that happen. I&#x27;d recommend for sure.</li>
    <li> Now this is quiet, does not pull while cutting.  Easy to work with.  Comes with everything you need.  Perfect for the average person without hair cutting knowledge and know how.  Perfect cut every time.  The color coding attachments are great for remembering the length option you prefer.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use and worth to pay, quality of product is also good. i would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> this was a really good value for the money.  the guards seems a little flimsy but so far they have held up without issue</li>
    <li> i love it. don&#x27;t see many products that is made in usa these days. i am glad i made the purchase. the haircutting machine is powerful and does the job right. also all the color cover made the haircut so much easier. :) made in usa! :)</li>
    <li> Work for 2 weeks then when i use it don&#x27;t cut</li>
    <li> We received the product quickly. The storage box is nice to keep everything together. My brother in law has been cutting my husband&#x27;s and father&#x27;s hair for a while. He thinks it works well. The scissors and comb are handy to trim up any missed areas. Good value for the money. I had priced similar products at local big box store. Amazon beat their price. With my Amazon Prime, I got 2 day free shipping.</li>
    <li> I like the clippers I ordered very much.A nice close clean cut.</li>
    <li> Could not be happier! I had no trouble cutting my husband&#x27;s very thick hair. It&#x27;s surprisingly quiet for the amount of power it puts out. Can&#x27;t wait to use it on my toddler next.</li>
    <li> The hair on my head is a thick as it comes. Even going to a commercial hair cutting places, there Clippers snag up on my hair and it hurts. These have so far cut through my hear like butter. They are definitely the best clippers and they are cheap too.</li>
    <li> Threw it away after first attempted use. Terribly loud, noisy, excessive vibration, scared wife to hold it. I would recommend it to cut your grass or trim the hedges - but not for a human head.  I failed to read the REVIEWS where one person cited metal shards breaking free and imbeding them in his scalp. Use it on a kid and it will scar them for life. If my Barber had one I would not sit in the chair. Again, We threw it away...</li>
    <li> The case organization is atrocious and the trash bag it came with is useless. I would have paid more money for these clippers for a better case, and better organized. The clippers themselves and attachments are excellent.</li>
    <li> Perfect for cutting my husband and son&#x27;s hair!  Love all the different settings, colors, and accessories that came with!</li>
    <li> This is a great quality item. It works well and it feels really well made and seems like it should last for years.</li>
    <li> The clipper is quiet and easy to use. The handle has the right weight.  I like the handle with color code for guide combs and easy to locate the correct comb.  The price is very good considering the quality of clipper and full set of tools for what you need for hair cut.  I highly recommend this</li>
    <li> husband loves them. i have tried some others that were cordless. he is not a fan of the cordless.</li>
    <li> These worked for several months, and was satisfied with them. My son and husband both used them. Once the blades got worn, they were hard to use. Purchased another set.</li>
    <li> I love these! I use them to cut my husband&#x27;s hair and it&#x27;s been great and saves us money on haircuts.</li>
    <li> Works great. Have bought lots of inexpensive clippers. These are best by far, no pulling and do a good job. Cheap hair cuts!</li>
    <li> Survived over 12 years</li>
    <li> Very nice accesaries vibrates way to much scary to use</li>
    <li> This was a great buy it works great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this to cut my hair for over a year, still runs great and has saved me hundreds in hair cut costs.</li>
    <li> I received these as a gift, cuts through hair real well I think this has the v5000. Strong motor and cuts close no adjusting the blades. Came with a lot of attachments. 2 years with them and going.</li>
    <li> The clippers work as intended. I previously owned Wahl clippers and I am happy with their performance. This model has a smaller on/off switch, which I like. I was disappointed in the case since it doesn&#x27;t have separated compartments for the guides.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality and presentation of the product, easy to use. The product has a finish that has nothing to envy to a professional machine. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Good product for the beginner, not for an experienced hair stylist. Seems kind of childish. Works well though. Good price too.</li>
    <li> Had another Wahl for 20 years. I never took care of it with oil, etc and it&#x27;s still going strong which says a lot about how good their products are. Recently it started to rip at the hair on my head (could it be because I never oiled it!). I decided to get a new one... WOW, my hair was cut within 3 minutes! I will definately take care of this great investment. Since the other is still working good, I&#x27;ll just use it for clipping/trimming body hair. I will always recommend Wahl products.</li>
    <li> Great clipper.  The kit is pretty extensive and for the money it works really well.  I use it to keep my beard nice and trimmed and have gotten compliments on it from several people.  Also good if you want to save a few bucks by keeping your hair short and shaved.</li>
    <li> My wife cut my hair with these clippers for the first time today. With these clippers she easily completed a  beautiful buzz cut that I usually pay $20 for at the hair cutting salon. The next time she cuts my hair these will be totally paid for.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Easy to use for strait forward men&#x27;s hair cuts; These operate smoothly and work flawlessly. Numbered comb guards prevent from clipping too closely or unevenly.  Clippers are built solidly, but lack the fanciness of professional grade clippers. The body of the clippers is plastic the blade base is steel but not stainless and the power cord is more like lamp cord than the heavy duty cord you&#x27;d expect on professional models; For the price though, and considering you&#x27;ll only use them  once or twice a month, the quality is adequate, and the functionality is excellent.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Most of these are minor, and considering the price for the kit, who&#x27;s complaining. The cutting apron is made plastic that&#x27;s about as thick as a shopping bag, the scissors, while they cut adequately aren&#x27;t very smooth. I was hoping that these clippers would include the instructional DVD that comes with the more expensive Wahl models, but the written and illustrated instructions served the purpose.</li>
    <li> This is a superior product and would recommend it to any one , i am using this now for over 3 months and no problems, there are pieces for every height hair, beard .My barber is upset not seeing me but i am saving on a biweekly hair cut and the time spent waiting in a barber&#x27;s chair. I would recommend this machine for any one looking to cut their own hair .</li>
    <li> Man, what a difference new hair trimmers make! We had a cheaper pair for a few years and using these to cut my sons hair for the first time was awesome. For $25, you can&#x27;t beat it. I would have gladly paid $75 after trying them out. It comes with plenty of accessories and the fact that they are color coded is fabulous. You guys will love it. This Mom does!</li>
    <li> I started cutting my hair 7 years ago. This is only the 3rd set I have bought and I just got it. So for a decade it has cost me $75 for countless haircuts. If you get a $10 haircut every two months, then you are paying $180 for 3 years! This should last at least that long if you take good care of it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with guards up to 1&amp;#34; and down to a close shave. I really like the ear taper guards for blending!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One word of advice - don&#x27;t keep the oil in the container or it will start spilling everywhere. However, you will want to oil it every few cuts!</li>
    <li> Great set, everything one needs to cut hair.</li>
    <li> Beats having to take a trip to the barber shop!</li>
    <li> Awesome product, price and quality!</li>
    <li> Wonderful! Nice packaging and accessories!</li>
    <li> Amazing clippers. I gave myself the most perfect haircut in just under 20 minutes.</li>
    <li> Terrific product for the price!</li>
    <li> paid for itself after giving our boys their first haircuts...... this product and youtube are a perfect savings marriage :-)</li>
    <li> Great product, easy to use. Has almost everything you need to cut hair. Fallback was the wrap cape feels like a trash bag, and can be used once because the hair clings to the Cape.</li>
    <li> Been cutting my own hair for that many years now... it has put a lot of money back in my pocket</li>
    <li> He uses it to cut his own hair and the result is just as good as he would get at the barbershop.</li>
    <li> Scary at first to use because it is LOUD and SCARY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sounds like table saw. Lots of power going into this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works well, perfect for beard trimming, but a little large for stash trimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clipper is LARGE about the size of a bottle of heineken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came with all the bonus accessories shown.</li>
    <li> This worked great for cutting my son and husbands hair. I have cut my husbands hair for a few years, but never my sons. I got this one after our other clippers broke and it worked great!! Not loud at all and my 1 year old son sat perfect getting his hair done.</li>
    <li> Relatively cheap,but the clipper moves unsmoothly sometimes.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly. Does not over heat.</li>
    <li> Quality kit.  You won&#x27;t find anything cheaper with as many pieces.  The clippers and scissors are sharp and work well.  The cape in it is nothing but a cheapo trash bag so you might want to invest in another one, but other that that this pretty much has everything you could possible need for at home haircuts.</li>
    <li> Great set for trimming my husbands hair.  Makes the job quick and easy.</li>
    <li> Quality:&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice hefty feel. I wish it was a bit lighter and slimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ease of use:&lt;br /&gt;Cant complain with the colors as guides, you really cant mess to much up with this machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a bit loud since I purchased it to cut my sons hair, but it does the job well. The noise can annoy the kids though.</li>
    <li> my son and husband, being ever so tight with their money, decided to cut their own hair... this is far better than their beard trimmers...great gift....very satisfied</li>
    <li> just wish it was a bit stronger but it gets the job done and i guess its worth the buy</li>
    <li> no complaints here, a lot of useful pieces, easy to use, I just wish the plastic cover had more space to store the items back in after using them</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands of hair clippers but none stack up to the quality of Wahl. They last for years. They don&#x27;t jam or bite.</li>
    <li> These are great.  The work well.  We&#x27;ve owned them for about a year with three getting regular haircuts.  It saves us a lot of money over going to the barber.  The color clips are handy as well.</li>
    <li> Thought about getting the pro, but this is working just fine.  Not as powerful as what you would get at the barber shop, but gets the job done well.  No more than we will use it, i am happy with it.</li>
    <li> Nice carrying case, and an overall nice color coded setup.Clippers cut great and feel high quality.Would recommend to anyone in need of a good set at a good price.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical, but this thing is quiet, affordable, and easy to use.  It&#x27;ll pay for itself in 2 uses, and it works great.</li>
    <li> Allows my wife to be able to cut my hair in about the same amount of time as Fantastic Sams and for the price of a single haircut.</li>
    <li> Does its job. Best way to cut your hair as a newbie, comes with instructions too.</li>
    <li> Great for a first time hair cut learner.</li>
    <li> Love the color coded system.  Cape was cheap and threw it away after first use.  Everything else worked well.</li>
    <li> Broke within months. Kept it well oiled and it didn&#x27;t stay sharp long.</li>
    <li> Great set. Great price.</li>
    <li> Great set with anything I need for cutting my hair. My wife cuts my hair in about 10 minutes with this. Have lots of choices for length of cut with attachments - set has ANYTHING you need for a simple haircut. Love Wahl products! Very good price for what you get. Well done WAHL!</li>
    <li> El vendedor envío el producto dentro del tiempo estipulado. La mercancía se encontraba en óptimas condiciones y de acuerdo a las especificaciones del vendedor. Gracias.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, powerful, quick accurate cuts. Great for those do-it-yourselers like me cutting your own hair or otherwise. Lots of room in the case for more accessories and additional clipper combs. Do yourself a favor and spring for a good barbers cape and some of that great fresh from the barber talc with a good brush.</li>
    <li> so many attachments and accessories plus written &amp;#34;how to&amp;#34; which are so valuable.  The package contains all the choices you would every hope to use.</li>
    <li> Very Pleased - Its just as good as the more expensive one which I owned but left at a hotel and never got it back.</li>
    <li> I take care of 3 handicapped and I cut their since they haven&#x27;t much money  It works great and easy to find the right attachment</li>
    <li> Love the color coding.  Don&#x27;t have to fiddle around looking for sizes.</li>
    <li> easy to use with the color coding</li>
    <li> Great product for home use. Probably has more attachments than necessary, but better to get more than less.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this hair clipper for about a month now, having used it a couple of times. I use it exclusively to trim my beard. My beard is very thick and the clippers cut through it like butter. I am very pleased with it&#x27;s performance. My old clippers of a different brand did not do as smooth a job even when they were new. If this clipper continues to perform is a similar way, even taking in consideration that the blades are not as sharp as time goes on, I will continue to be very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> perfecto era lo que esperaba muy completo este producto y bastante potente</li>
    <li> Works good and is really easy to use.</li>
    <li> Excellent value, worked great!</li>
    <li> Cuts smoothly and makes very little noise. Excellent clippers and the price was just as pleasing.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband for his birthday.  He said he love its.</li>
    <li> These work great and have made cutting my boys&#x27; hair a breeze. I bought the 1 1/4 and 1 1/2 guards to complete my set. The drape that comes with this is a joke though. We never really use it, but if you plan to, you might want to buy a nicer one. The one in this kit reminds me of a trash bag.</li>
    <li> My wife cuts my hair and she said it&#x27;s great.  I replaced an older pair with this new Wahl pro.</li>
    <li> We love this product. I recommend to all buyers</li>
    <li> does its job beautifully</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Well, I read the product reviews and decided to purchase this item for the price. It cut great right out of the box. It is heavy and sturdy, and I prefer electric clippers with its fast moving blades, instead of worrying about cordless battery operated clippers going dead on me. A plenty long enough cord. It cut right through my longer hair with fast ease. I decided to cut my hair down to a crew cut with it. You can&#x27;t ever mess that up too much. I used the orange color 1/2 inch attachment for my short crewcut. They work and sound just as good as the barbers clippers. A 5 year warranty. Made in the USA. Heck, if I only get 3 cuts out of it, it paid for itself in my cost of 3 barber haircuts. I would highly recommend these clippers to any beginner or pro-.</li>
    <li> Super product ! I can&#x27;t believe that you can still buy a quality product made in America these days, it&#x27;s unheard of , and at a super price. The minute I took the clippers out of the box and picked it up, I knew I was holding a real piece equipment , I mean solid . The accessories assortment is well stocked and the storage case is very useful. I was a little nervous about cutting my own hair for the first time , but the clippers were easy to use  and it went very well. An excellent investment !</li>
    <li> The Wahl Home Pro Haircutting System. This Buzzer System works pretty good I cut my hair every two weeks or so and I haven&#x27;t had an issue yet so I love it, it pays for itself in less than two barber trips.</li>
    <li> very nice clippers. I would order again if I needed clippers. They fit your hand well, and they are nice and quite for clippers.</li>
    <li> color coordination makes it easy to find the right size attachment. got my hair cut with it yesterday, and it performed extremely well.</li>
    <li> Bought it for his Christmas gift he loves it, he was using one that he had had for 10yrs.</li>
    <li> Used twice, works well, very quiet compared to previous clipper set.  Good assortment of accessories.</li>
    <li> It was a really good purchase, it has everything that you need for a good haircut,  but now everytime we turn it on it sounds horrible, it used to be very quiet but now after the 5th or 6th use, like the engine souns horrible makes a very loud noise that makes it almost impossible to use!</li>
    <li> i save so much money per month using these clippers.  they&#x27;re strong, durable, reasonable priced, and relatively quiet compared to other clippers.  great buy.</li>
    <li> I previously used an old pair of Wahl clippers my parents probably purchased sometime in the 80s.  When they finally did go out, I came on here and read reviews and ultimately decided on these clippers for my next set and, having used them 2 times since purchasing, I&#x27;m 100% happy with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Owning a pair of clippers made in the 80s, anything is an improvement from that, but I like that these have a no.1 blade AND a no.0 blade.  Very ergonomic.</li>
    <li> Does the job. It heats up quickly though, and the on-off button is sometimes hard to press. Love the color-coding though.</li>
    <li> Really good trimmer for the price.</li>
    <li> My daughter loved it - she&#x27;s currently in Beauty School and is needing all the supplies required once she graduates.  She has used the clipper several times &amp; has been very pleased.</li>
    <li> It is very helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;- 11  color-coded guide combs are very good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would be better if the barber&#x27;s cape is made of cloth.</li>
    <li> I love that I can cut my family members hair without a fuss.  The color coding is a big help!</li>
    <li> Good weight,,,runs quiet. Loved the color coded attachments. Everything you need to do home haircutting. Would recommend with no reservations.</li>
    <li> I used two time for cut the hair for my son, first time, I don&#x27;t know how to use it, second time, I only use for No. 2. good job.</li>
    <li> This product gets an outstanding in my household.  The whole kit is great, especially for this price.  My husband is in the military, and he gets biweekly to weekly haircuts.  Not only do I love it, my husband loves it too!  We are very impressed..</li>
    <li> I cut my husband&#x27;s and 5 son&#x27;s hair at home and always have. I use to have a different set of clippers but they were dropped and finally broke. So I got these, but I&#x27;ve had issues since we got them. The blades like to stop moving mid cut and then just pulls especially if the hair is to long. I tried oiling them, but it doesn&#x27;t make much of a difference. They don&#x27;t seem to cut without attachments very close to the skin. They also get very hot after cutting for too long, so often I can&#x27;t cut everyone&#x27;s hair without burning them, and have to stop and let them cool. I wish I had gotten different clippers, as I just don&#x27;t see these lasting a long time. When they do work, they&#x27;re good clippers though.</li>
    <li> I buy this machine but I don&#x27;t try it yet but I&#x27;m happy looking very well</li>
    <li> I have had this product a couple of weeks.Did my first haircut.I am male and everything went well.The cutter was smooth and as quite as you can expect for an electric motor,just a quiet buzz.The cutter feels of quality equiptment.My only complaint is I used the attachment for the longest length of hair,1 inch but I feel it still cut too short.I wish they had one wider attachment or that you could snap one or two attachments together to get a little bit longer cut,maybe 1.5 inches or 2 onches.Other than that I am very pleased with this hair cutting kit and my first hair cut.Thank you John</li>
    <li> Very Very Very Very Bad one !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is awful one, super loud, can make you bald, bad clipping , very bad experience !</li>
    <li> Did not buy from amazon but own the same kit. Wahl makes great products. I&#x27;ve had mine for 4-5 years now, no signs of wear and tear. The plastic guides do wear out and need replacing after a few years depending on usage. But they are cheap 4-6 bucks each. Well worth it. I use the 1/16&amp;#34; for a close shave around the upper lip. Great product!!</li>
    <li> These clippers are excellent, smooth cutting, and easy to use. They came with many different hair length guards. Combining these with an adjustable blade creates a large range of lengths that hair can be trimmed to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were also many guards which I will likely never use (eyebrow trimmer, tapering guards, etc.), a hair catching bib, and instructions on how to cut hair. It does seem like you&#x27;d know how to do that before you got the clippers. Then again...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, these clippers work great and, if they last for any length of time at all, will have been a great investment.</li>
    <li> Very nice set of clippers. I actually dropped thee a couple times on some hard tile, and they never went out of alignment. They feel heavy duty, and  they cut very. They are also quiet, so my 3 year old son does not throw a fit when I am cutting his hair anymore. Comes with many different color coated attachments that are numbered so you know how much you want to take off, and has a case to put everything away in. Worth the money.</li>
    <li> When we opened this item 3 pieces were broken.  Since we had such a problem with our first one, I didn&#x27;t want to deal with the problems of this one.  If I could get replacement pieces of those broken, that would be great. I am not at home to say which ones were broke, one was a ear piece, then I think the one inch, and another smaller size. If there is anything you could do that would be great.  Thank you</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think you can get a better kit for the price. The color coding made it easy enough for my girlfriend (who has no haircutting experience) to figure out on the first attempt how to cut my hair on par with a basic salon/barbershop cut. After several cuts, it&#x27;s more than paid for itself a couple times over and the blades are still in pristine condition. I bought Andis 12750 Cool Care spray to use with it. It too is a great product. I would suggest both of these products for anyone tired of shelling out $15-20 every couple weeks for a basic trim and fade.</li>
    <li> I cut my husband&#x27;s hair and all three of our teenagers&#x27; hair. There are so many guards to choose from, everyone is happy!</li>
    <li> The item shipped was clearly used.  22 of the 26 pieces were missing from the package.  I bought a similar item at a big box store for a similar price and could check to make sure everything was in tact.</li>
    <li> The Wahl line has always been a good product for the money - this is no exception! Has everything you need to take care of the family.</li>
    <li> I bought it to use it on my husband, I love the handy case it comes in, so far I only cut his hair twice with it and it has done a great job, will update review later if it does not last as far as sharpness goes.</li>
    <li> This little clipper is awesome. I cut hair for friends and family at home, and it works really well. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> The clipper works great. Gives a really nice cut. The variety of attachments are super! Very good deal for the price.</li>
    <li> works great. like it a lot.</li>
    <li> I purchased this kit for personal use. I use this clipper kit once a month and take care of it, such as cleaning and oiling it. It works great but is a little bit louder than I would like it to be. I can overlook the noise over quality. If you&#x27;re looking for a nice pair of clippers this is a great place to start!</li>
    <li> Impressed with how heavy duty it is.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son for graduation because we had a different set that he used for the last year or so to cut his own hair.  He was moving away and can start with his own set that is color coded.  The only thing missing to me is our set had the small cordless trimmer which he liked to use for trimming beard, mustache, sideburns and neck.</li>
    <li> I give my husband and son their hair cut.  I used to fix hair, so now I just do my Dad , husband and son hair.  I used them first on my husband and they worked great.  I love the color on the different size to use for the perfect cut.  The razor was not too loud.  And the hair did not stick to the color different shape size.  I love the container that you can carry the clipper in.  They could improve on the cap it was just a plastic one will not last long.  Over all I would recommend this kit.</li>
    <li> TODO TRANQUILO SIN PROBLEMA ALGUNO LO RECIBI DE MANERA RAPIDA, ES UN PRODUCTO BUENO QUE UN AMIGO ME ENCARGO QUE LE COMPRE UNO</li>
    <li> Great product like it very well one of the bes.t I owned in long time. Got here well packed and on time</li>
    <li> Used it first time just for cleaning up sideburns and around ears. Did a good job. Just used it again for all over same length cut and was extremely pleased with results.</li>
    <li> I have saved myself a ton of money by using this instead of going to a salon.  Worth the investment!</li>
    <li> I have been using this clipper kit regularly for over 4 years, and it&#x27;s still running strong.  I cut my own hair all the time and have saved over $500 in haircut costs alone.  I use some mineral oil just to keep it lubed.  I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s dulled a bit over the years, but not enough to make them difficult to use.  I would bet that there are many hair salon folk out there who would scoff at the quality of this thing, but you&#x27;re not paying hundeds of $$$ for salon equipment.  This is incredibly affordable, durable home clipping equipment.  Great investment.  I think 4 stars is very respectable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;::UPDATE::&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I changed my rating from 4 stars to 5 because I think that, for the money, you just can&#x27;t beat these clippers.  I&#x27;ve had this pair of clippers for at least 4 years and I&#x27;ve been using them regularly (at least 1-2 times a month).  They are still great and I have saved so much money because of them.  This product might get 4 stars if it cost more, but this is a steal.</li>
    <li> Wahl makes the best hair clippers, period.  Keep it clean and oiled and it should last for many years.  I&#x27;ve had this one for just over two years and have had no issues.  Comes with a lot of accessories.  I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair (close-cropped) since 1995 and this is my fifth set of clippers.  The first two were Sunbeam brand and didn&#x27;t last more than a year, which was not a bad deal for $15 each considering I have to cut my hair every three weeks, so over the course of a year, I save tons of money.  I&#x27;ve purchased three from Wahl now and they last for years (the one exception is the cordless Wahl I bought and threw in the trash because it lacked the power to consistently cut through my thick hair when corded and especially when cordless).  Not really a fault of Wahl, just the technology lacking.  Good product, don&#x27;t hesitate to buy it if you need a new set of clippers.</li>
    <li> We were very excited to get this product and start cutting our child&#x27;s hair. Upon use we discovered that the clippers are VERY LOUD. We bought these thinking they would be quiet set but were very wrong. Our two year old hates hair cuts and the noise of this does not help. His father also commented on how loud they were especially when close the ears. The set is very complete and the colors make it easy to find the guard you want. We are happy with the clippers overall as they cut the hair and are simple to use. I just would not recommend these to any family with small children that dislike loud noises.</li>
    <li> I am not someone who can &#x27;cut&#x27; hair, but with this kit, I don&#x27;t need to be! I was tired of paying $20 a month for my husband&#x27;s haircuts, which are not elaborate. I bought this set and after reading the instructions was able to provide him with a nice haircut, blended and just how he likes it. I am happy, he is happy, and this product worked great! The colored guides are so helpful and the how-to booklet is great. I think our family is going to get a lot of use out of this!</li>
    <li> This clippers with the color forks are sure a lot easier to find your size that you want. Then the older black  kind the the older clipper used.</li>
    <li> I used it more than half year. So I believe at least I used it 6~8 times. So i think that is worthy that. The reason it broken is not the quality of the product. It was because of me, keep doing the haircutting during the shower...</li>
    <li> This thing is awesome. I&#x27;ve read a couple of reviews about how &amp;#34;loud&amp;#34; this thing is. My little guy is now 4 years old. Since the day he was born he&#x27;s had a hearing condition in one of his ears that causes everything to be WAY to loud in it. So naturally, he was TERRIFIED of our old clippers (they sounded more like a weed eater or electric hedge trimmers). We bought this more the range of length in the guards than anything. If he was going to be afraid, at least we could cut his hair at reasonable lengths. But these things (while they obviously make noise) hardly bother him at all. He actually sits still and lets me cut his hair now. So worth the money for my family.</li>
    <li> I have used it several times now, it does just fine.  I only use one attachment but it has plenty, the combs and scissors are cheap, as expected in non professional kits, but then I don&#x27;t want to pay the professional prices for things I don&#x27;t even use.</li>
    <li> I have natural hair that I sometimes wear really short. These clippers have helped me manage my hair care needs.</li>
    <li> Used once so far, and worked fine. To me, it&#x27;s not noisy; it just has a sort of mellow hum, a by-product of the magnetic motor moving the blades back and forth... that doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish there was a storage tray built into the case for all the accessories, instead of just a plastic bag or unstructured storage container. Makes one have to spend more time searching through all the attachments.</li>
    <li> Successfully cut my own hair!</li>
    <li> Love my order am very please and will order from you in the future if you have something that I can use. Thank you very much</li>
    <li> Great buy.  Quality product with everything you need to cut your kiddo&#x27;s hair.  I bought because my 2 year old would lose it at the barber shop.  We got to scream it out at home and finally teach him cutting hair really doesn&#x27;t hurt.  Great purchase.</li>
    <li> affordable, flexible, functional</li>
    <li> so convenient and stable!</li>
    <li> No one knows your hair like you do.  And I have wanted to be able to shorter cuts but the stylist or barber would always do something wrong. But after the first attempt, I can give myself the exact hair cut that I have always wanted and considering I was paying $10 plus tip....the three haircuts I have given myself have saved me money.  I am a union Ironworker and I worked on an addition to the Wahl Clipper Factory where these clippers are QUALITY MADE RIGHT HERE IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.  BUILD UNION. BUY AMERICAN. I USUALLY HAVE TO SAY YOU MAY PAY MORE BUT YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR. THESE ARE NEAR THE SAME QUALITY AS THE PRO WAHL CLIPPERS YOU SEE EVERY BARBER HAVE AT THEIR STATION FOR A VERY AFFORDABLE PRICE</li>
    <li> great item for this prize. I don&#x27;t even know how much money I have saved since my fiancée started cutting my hair.</li>
    <li> Works great. Owned for 6 months now and they work great for personal use. No issues whatsoever.</li>
    <li> Great product and easy to use. I&#x27;ve been using it for six months now, and I really love everything about this kit. I like how it comes in a kit to store everything, and I like how this electronic clipper plugs into the wall rather than being battery powered. I had previously bought a rechargeable battery powered clipper that only lasted me a year, so this is a lot better.</li>
    <li> I even use this to shave my little Shit-tzu. Ha! it works great,</li>
    <li> I save SO much money investing in one of these! I cut my own hair, my son&#x27;s, my mom&#x27;s, and my daughter&#x27;s. really great and complete set, and super price! (at least when I got it for 25 a few years ago!) It lasted like 4 years! I have a short hair cut, so I use it often! I was impressed. The plastic that the blade is placed on finally wore down and the blade wouldn&#x27;t stay in place. Otherwise, I think I could have just gotten a new blade and kept going with it. the motor still worked fine!</li>
    <li> Makes cutting your own hair easy and affordable</li>
    <li> A great kit to do all my grooming needs. It&#x27;s everything in one small kit. The only thing you&#x27;ll need is a mirror!</li>
    <li> The Wahl 79300-1001 Home Pro 26 piece color coded haircutting system works well - really like it; would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> This looks pretty amazing, this will shorten your hair whatever you want, so what can your hair feel look like.</li>
    <li> no when i use them ,they blow up in my hand,big bang and smoke,then i only got a load of hair left on my head,not very happy</li>
    <li> Awesome product its so easy to handle.</li>
    <li> These clippers are great. The guides and instructions make cutting my husband&#x27;s hair a breeze and I had NEVER given a decent haircut before in my life !! They will pay for themselves in 2 haircuts! Couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with this purchase. Arrived quickly, no worries!!</li>
    <li> I like the color coded guards. I use this all the time to cut hair for my family.  When the time comes for a replacement I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this kit for a few months and I keep my hair relatively short. Luckily I&#x27;m able to use the attachments for the most part to get my hair cut, but it seems like some of the plastic attachments aren&#x27;t fitting as well onto the unit anymore. Everything else still works though and for the price it&#x27;s a steal!</li>
    <li> It came nicely packaged with all the contents in tact!</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for, this product is very usefull for me, am using it and happy to have bought it :D</li>
    <li> Purchased this for the whole family.  Great product for home use.  We use it for quick trims, cleanup of necklines, etc.</li>
    <li> Good clippers, they work well.</li>
    <li> I bought these mostly for the name brand. I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use them yet but I will very soon.</li>
    <li> The best clipper I have found so far.</li>
    <li> I  LOVE IT AND EZ TO USE!</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t mind the practice and occasional close cut, this is a great way to save some cash on haircuts, especially if you have a military-ish style.  To go out for a cut is almost $20!  This lets me cut my hair once a week to keep a neat high fade, and saves a ton of cash.  Best thing about this set is the 1/16&amp;#34; trimmer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned many different shavers over the years. But, none compare to this one. The machine is very quiet. It comes with a HUGE variety of clip sizes and has an outstanding price tag. I paid just $24.99. the shaver has a color coded clip size chart right on the shaver body. You won&#x27;t have to pick up each clip looking for the proper size, they are color coded. It also comes with a large variety of accessories. A brush to clean the hair from your neck area. The brush can also be used to clean hair from your shaver. Comes with some oil. An apron to prevent hair from getting all over you and more. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> Owned and used an earlier model of this product. After 15 years and countless haircuts we needed to update. All indications are that this will continue to serve us well for years to come.</li>
    <li> Wahl makes great products, and they have been doing this for generations. So I think my issues with this product is probably just personal preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For example, this clipper is heavy. Which could be a plus since it has to be durable for long term use.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the vibration is strong - to the point where it almost lost feeling in my hand&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, its a loud.&lt;br /&gt;So, if you do get this before you use it on your hair you may want to try holding it while on to see if you have any issues.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my husband and sons hair for the last thirty or more years.  Made plenty of mistakes,  but with these new color clip on and  combs, I am sure to get my boys looking very handsome. The prices of going to a shop has gotten outrageous.  So this saves money, I can do the hair cuts at any time and clean up is a zip with the apron that&#x27;s included&#x27;  The instruction are great.</li>
    <li> Excelente Producto. puntual y responsable el vendedor! gracias.</li>
    <li> Great shaver...but doesnt cut close just bare without gage. Close shave not happening.  But otherwise good.</li>
    <li> Pros&lt;br /&gt;+ Inexpensive&lt;br /&gt;+ Includes everything you need to maintain&lt;br /&gt;+ Clippers work well&lt;br /&gt;+ Color coded attachments&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The amount of attachments and quality of the clippers for the price is enough to satisfy me. The fact that this comes with everything I need to maintain the clippers is also an added bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;- Scissors&lt;br /&gt;- Case&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scissors aren&#x27;t the greatest and can cut up to 4 sheets of paper with some difficulty. For the neat freaks out there the case doesn&#x27;t really offer you any organized way to store all the attachments.</li>
    <li> Does a great job for the price, haven&#x27;t had any issues with it. I&#x27;ve owned it for several months and it&#x27;s saved a lot of money on hair cuts. Comes with a great guide for cutting hair too.</li>
    <li> I got these because my nephew has some which I&#x27;ve used on occasion. I&#x27;m glad to have my own!</li>
    <li> Purchased these clippers to replace a portable/battery operated pair we had for a couple of years.  These clippers work very nice and the color coding of the attachments helps also.  The clipper has a little weight to it and had to adjust to being able to maneuver it due to the weight compared to the little portable clipper I had.  All-in-all, this is a great clipper set.</li>
    <li> great quality and fast shipping. I used to go to hair salon to cut my hair but the cheapest hair salon offers  $20 for male hair cut and I need to tip around $5 so its kind a pricey. I just started to learn how to cut my own hair because to same little money and I&#x27;m kind a having fun.</li>
    <li> I read other reviews about it being loud but I have to say that it is quieter than my barbers pro clippers. They work good and Wahl has always made a good product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this system once to cut my 4-year-old son&#x27;s hair.  I am not, however, new to cutting hair, since I also used to cut my husband&#x27;s and older two sons&#x27; hair.  I&#x27;m proud to say that I taught myself and, due to the perfectionist in me, have never given anyone a &amp;#34;special.&amp;#34;  The Wahl 79300-1001 Home Pro 26-piece color-coded haircutting system helped me to achieve the results I desired, when cutting my son&#x27;s hair.  However, I found that, attempting to follow the instructions for use actually slowed me down, as I am a pretty precise, calculated, and fairly skilled &amp;#34;barber.&amp;#34;  Although I&#x27;ve not yet broken my clippers in, I can say that they cut well and get the job done.  I would recommend this item.</li>
    <li> these clippers are great please note that i have no experience with cutting hair but with these clippers i worked wonders on my little 2year head it comes with everything you could possibly need and with all the different grauds u can&#x27;t mess up</li>
    <li> 26 piece is just a marketing thing. The quality of the product (other than the machine and clips- Color Pro clipper, blade guard), are not good. It feels like cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flat top comb, medium comb, pocket comb, scissors, 2 hair clips, cleaning brush,  cape, neck brush - you will get quality  what you paid for...</li>
    <li> This clipper set is a great value and product. I&#x27;ve had Wahl clippers in the past and for the most part they worked well but, they were really loud. These clippers are very quiet and have a nice comfortable grip. We&#x27;ve had trouble trying to cut our 6 year old sons hair with the older clippers but with this set he doesn&#x27;t mind getting his hair cut at all.</li>
    <li> I purchased these clippers so that I could save a couple bucks a month on haircuts.  They are well worth it!  I watched a couple of how-to videos online with my fiancée.  Now she is my personal barber!  This kit comes with everything you need including all standard guards, blade oil, and combs.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for.a super price.  I have already saved more money than what it would cost for 4 of them.  It comes complete with instructions, the clothes protector that they use in a barber shop(although this one is made of cheap plastic), everything else about the kit is more than I expected for the price.  It definitely is 100% professional grade.  Great especially for larger families, because with the amount of money you save, you can afford to treat yourself or a loved one to something special.&#x27;</li>
    <li> I love the color coding, even info on cutter to cross check the size you are using...made using it extremely easy. The plastic hair cover is Ok but I will replace it with a cloth one...</li>
    <li> The best! Have been cutting my hair (and my son&#x27;s) for nearly 5 years now. Have tried other brands, nothing compares.</li>
    <li> Worth the money. Lots of great attachments and case. Husband loves it.</li>
    <li> It seems pretty great, but I have nothing to compare to. Basically, starts right up. The carrying case is handy, if a bit crowsded/unorganized. They could have at least moulded some slots to put the combs in and a pouch to put the smaller accessories+manual. They did at least add a mount to hold the clipper, and you can easily route the cord through the handle.  I wish the #&#x27;s/sizes were printed in a different color so they were more obvious -- nothing you&#x27;ll regret faster than using the dark purple when you meant the light purple! Frankly, they shouldn&#x27;t have re-used colors of different shades. I kind of hope to never have to buy a clipper set again... if this one does break, I&#x27;ll be sure to whine about it here!</li>
    <li> I was surprised at the &amp;#34;equipment&amp;#34; that came with the clipper. It&#x27;s easy to use. I expect it to last for many years.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately the first one i purchased was ear piercingly loud and smoked and blew up within seconds of turning it on, so you then replaced it with another one and I was hoping it was not going to do the same thing.  Unfortunately it did so I can only suggest that our power differences it too much for the product to handle even with the adapter I bought from Dick Smiths. It is such a shame as I have used Wahl for years  and have found them to be awesome and had no problems at all.</li>
    <li> This set is the best because it comes with everything you need and I&#x27;m a up coming barber and I only bought this for something&#x27;s only and I tried this clipper and it gives some good cuts but never tired to give a taper but my be ill try it out</li>
    <li> These clippers are awesome. They even have a half size blade cover so fades are super easy to do.</li>
    <li> The day I received them I used them. They are worth every penny.I probably shouldn&#x27;t say this but I also used them on my dog and they work better than the clippers for dogs.</li>
    <li> Saved and will save a lot of money for my family!</li>
    <li> This kit has been excellent for me as a beginner! I read the handbook several times and watched a few youtube videos and now I am cutting my husband&#x27;s hair. He is satisfied with the job I&#x27;m doing, and I really like the color coded guides. He said the cape that came with it made him feel like he was wearing a garbage bag, and we have to use his electric razor to get the perfect square neckline that he wants on his hair, but we are going to be saving lots of money with this kit in the long run!</li>
    <li> Promptly delivered, but 1 piece was missing when opened.</li>
    <li> Horrible cut. Do not waste your money.</li>
    <li> to perfect. helps save me and my friends money</li>
    <li> Years later, we still use this and it works just great! I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> What a fantastic clipper.  It came and we used it the same day!  Works well and cuts great!</li>
    <li> Decent clippers, came on time!! No complaints</li>
    <li> I love this clipper kit.  It works great and is easy to use.  My wife helps me cut the back and I do the top and sides.  Looks good and saves me&lt;br /&gt;$20.00, every three week or so.</li>
    <li> Great quality set of clippers that are easy to use.</li>
    <li> I bought this three years ago and it is still going strong.  I do 3 haircuts a month with them.  The clips seemed a bit flimsy when I first opened it, but they haven&#x27;t broken in 3 years.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Wahl for 30 years and the best part about that is it means a grand total of three clippers to cover tat span of time. These work great and last for a very long time. Great price for a great tool. This kit comes with a lot of different length guides, too many for my needs but great to give you all the options you need. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Good and durable i recommend for those who learning to cut hair.</li>
    <li> Works great and makes cutting hair almost automatic</li>
    <li> excellent product, really recommend it</li>
    <li> I initially wrote a review of this product giving it 3 stars because I thought it was used. Why did I think it was used? well because there were small black shavings on the blades that resembled someone&#x27;s hair and I thought it was used. But upon reading some comments in the reviews section, I found someone complaining about the same thing and when I looked at the reply to that review. A wahl&#x27;s representative said that the shavings aren&#x27;t someone&#x27;s hair but it is the shavings of the blade guard rubbing up against it during shipment. I believe it because when I saw the shavings on the blade initially I looked at it closely and it didn&#x27;t really look like someone&#x27;s hair nor did it have the texture of hair. I&#x27;m glad I came to the review section instead of just returning it. As for the quality of the product. It seems quiet (don&#x27;t forget to put the oil on the blade before you use it - the oil comes as part of the package) and it seems like it&#x27;s working as it should.</li>
    <li> I suppose the clippers would of worked well if they mentioned that it is a 110VAC clipper and not a 220VDC clipper. I also assumed that they would of known that in South Africa, as per Europe, uses 220VDC and that a special adapter had to be purchased for half of the price of which I paid for the unit. My clippers also made a loud noise when operating and would not go away even after trying to calibrate the tension spring. The shipping cost to get the unit shipped back was double to what I paid for the unit, and I wasn&#x27;t prepared to take a chance on getting my money back. I reduced the vibration and noise by placing a washer between the tension spring and magnet...but in the end, I was not happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> For somewhere around $25 in price, this clipper set is phenomenal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clippers do get warm when ran for a long time.  Other than that, these have served me well for over 10 hair cuts so far and they still cut like new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This kit is very complete, with cutting oil and a cleaning brush as well as all the guards.  The carrying case fits the whole set easily, but the guards could use a little organization.  I just leave my extra guards in the plastic bag they came in and shove that bag in the case, but Wahl could have done a better job organizing these guards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, well worth the money as this seems to be a durable, quality product.</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully and after using for over a year now, we&#x27;ve had zero issues. This has saved our family of 6 (4 of them boys!) TONS in haircut costs.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because I wanted to cut my own hair a female Faux Hawk style, well, I did cut my own hair with it but I didn&#x27;t know how to get that Faux Hawk I wanted; it was the first time I do it. Anyways, this clipper is great I have no complains about it, I also used the scissors to cut two of my (girl)friends&#x27; hair(s) and they loved what I did to their hair, I did &amp;#34;Scene&amp;#34; on them and I also used the clippers alongside the scissors to get that pointy look for Scene hairstyle and the Wahl 79300-1001 Home Pro did a great job on that. I love love love it. And I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Kit came with everything listed and it cuts my hair without issue.  Seems to be well built!</li>
    <li> Works well and has everything you need.  I laughed when I got it because I didn&#x27;t realized it EVEN came with a barber&#x27;s cape&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just got it so I can&#x27;t speak to the durability.</li>
    <li> Growing up, my dad used to cut my hair with an old Wahl clippers he used back when he was in the Navy. I was brought up with home haircuts and when I enlisted in R.O.T.C. the old clippers were brought out again. With my current employment, regulations require a military style haircut. Instead of paying $11 every three weeks, I decided to upgrade to a more modern and...</li>
    <li> Great for cutting guys or boys hair with great results. Love the color coded attachments. Saves money on hair cuts for the whole family. Got to have one.</li>
    <li> Works fine cutting my hair. No complaints.</li>
    <li> I used a wahl trimmer just like this for 7 years. Still worked fine but I bought a new kit, basically just to replace the ends which I had lost. These trimmers are powerful and durable and a perfect buy for a man who likes a buzz cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure how it would work for a barber or someone who cuts hair a lot, but for a monthly trim it is perfect for me.</li>
    <li> Terrible!  I was so excited,  and so let down.  They are so loud, they pull constantly, (yes they were oiled) and even though the hair I cut was very short,  I had to go really really slow or they would clog with hair!  TERRIBLE,  can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s a Wahl!!</li>
    <li> I keep reading complaints/comments about there being hair in the clippers...one thing you should keep in mind is at the factory they have to test the blades by cutting fake hair before they send it out, so just relax!</li>
