      <li>The Amazon price can&#x27;t be beat, I was paying the Vet more than twice this price.  </li>
      <li>used this product before, very good and cheaper than the brands, with the same ingrediants as the brand....</li>
      <li>Easy to use and very useful to me.</li>
      <li>here they are and for really cheap.</li>
      <li>So, I need this to be cheap because I&#x27;ll have to buy it for years.</li>
      <li>This ointment (grease formulation) is great for my dog who has dry eye.</li>
      <li>Great for dry eye syndrome.  </li>
      <li>Great produc for chronic dry eyet!</li>
      <li>I purchased this for my Rottweiler, as she has mild entropian.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t need a prescription and luckily found it on Amazon...</li>
      <li>The ointment must be really soothing for him because he easily lets me put it in his eye and the redness clears up in no time.</li>
      <li>Great price ... very soothing for dry eyes ...</li>
      <li>As soon as he sees me wash my hands in the morning after his breakfast, he stays right in place</li>
      <li>The doctor told me to apply a small amount, about 1/4\\&quot; to each eye daily, and lo and behold, his eyes are nice and bright and don&#x27;t tear.  </li>
      <li>the vet also said that i needed this ointment which i didnt buy at first.</li>
      <li>This works very well for her.</li>
      <li>and it didn&#x27;t really help with my condition at all.</li>
      <li>Shipping was fast but some of the ointment had leaked out onto the box, despite having been bubble-wrapped and mailed in a bubble bag.  </li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>The product is very affordable and does the job.</li>
      <li>These do the trick like many other options but these were cheaper at the time.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice and thick and coats the eye</li>
      <li>But it  keep the eyes lubricated,  ONLY USE it RIGHT BEFORE BED.  </li>
      <li>The dog&#x27;s eyes are well hydrated and clear and we aren&#x27;t finding eye-goo crusted on them in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>From the Pharmapacks vendor, it costs only one-third as much as the vet charges.</li>
      <li>But... it had had 0 problems so far</li>
      <li>so my chihuahua has so far avoided surgery.  </li>
      <li>There are other eye ointments available here on Amazon that are formulated entirely of white petroletum and mineral oil and that do not contain lanolin.</li>
      <li>The ingredients are exactly the same as what my vet had given me and in the same concentration.</li>
      <li>So, I tested it on myself first and there was absolutely no burning and despite not having eye issues, my eyes felt really clear and...hydrated?</li>
      <li>But 2% is quite a lot in comparison to other ointments and the purchaser should be aware of this if there&#x27;s any possibility that the lanolin will irritate your eye.</li>
      <li>He&#x27;s a bit elderly, 11 years old, and his eyes were constantly tearing.</li>
      <li>Only issue is it is quite thick and the tube continues to expel more ointment after the initial pressure of application.</li>
      <li>On the other hand it&#x27;s not something I&#x27;m raving about wildly to friends - it&#x27;s a good, solid, product for artificial tears for an animal (no idea how it would work with a human) but it isn&#x27;t something thrilling.</li>
      <li>I have to use twice as much of it as I do with other brands.  </li>
      <li>When we order eyedrops, we normally order enough to last several months.</li>
      <li>This is very similar to other thick lubricant eye ointments recommended for stroke patients in that it contains mostly sterilized petroleum jelly (83%) and mineral oil (15%).</li>
      <li>I have used this product previously and it works very well.  </li>

<li> I apply this to my dogs eyes prior to bathing to give a little extra protection</li>
<li> This was one of the products the vet sold us to help our dog with her dry eye condition.</li>
<li> The dog has chronic dry eye</li>
<li> I use this for my dog whose eyes get really dry during the winter months.</li>
<li> My guinea pig is blind in one eye and unable to produce his own natural lubricant</li>
<li> My eyes are very dry</li>
<li> I use to purchase Genteal for roughly $10 a pop.</li>
<li> the vet asked me if my dog sleeps with his eyes all the way closed</li>
<li> His eyes are wide after I use it on him</li>
<li> That&#x27;s not unusual in these eye ointments.</li>
<li> However the first couple of tubes you will probably waste as some as it get difficult to squeeze the tube when it gets low.</li>
<li> ointment is the quality of any other ointment on the market, and is affordable for me to use.  </li>
<li> He has some irritation due to a sty.</li>
<li> Rather than lubricate and soothe dry eyes, this solution burns when you apply it, no matter how little you use.  </li>
<li> The only complaint I have is that the tube itself is somewhat stiffer than other brands I have used.</li>
<li> After using Optimmune daily for 2 years, I found the artificial tears ointment while visiting a new vet.</li>
<li> The tubes are to hard, it make it harder to completely empty the tube</li>
<li> the cost considerably less.</li>
<li> They&#x27;re half the price here on amazon as they are at the vet -- and they work well.</li>
<li> I suggest squeezing less than needed and allow the excess to ooze out for application so as not to waste any of it.</li>
<li> This product was recommended to me by my vet for my little Jack Russell terrier.  </li>
<li> /&gt;I was a little hesitant to use this on him because I saw a review mention that this product burns.</li>
<li> I like it, not love it.</li>
<li> Wetness of the eye makes it hard to apply.</li>
<li> so I have to apply artificial tears ointment to it 2-3 times daily.</li>
<li> I thought it would be weird to put ointment in my eyes but amazingly not so much.</li>
<li> That makes it impossible to get the last 10% (or so) of the ointment out of the tube.</li>
<li> needless to say i will be buying from here and not the vet.</li>
<li> I have corneal dystrophy and cannot afford the expensive artificial tears ointment!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This was one of the products the vet sold us to help our dog with her dry eye condition. The vet charged us $35 for this same size tube. Buying it on Amazon is much better . It does seem to help her. We use twice a day</li>
    <li> The product is very affordable and does the job. I have an English bulldog that will need a lubricating eye ointment for the remainder of his life; thus, finding this product at an affordable price is a god send. I use to purchase Genteal for roughly $10 a pop. At $3 and some change, it much more manageable. Only issue is it is quite thick and the tube continues to expel more ointment after the initial pressure of application. I suggest squeezing less than needed and allow the excess to ooze out for application so as not to waste any of it.</li>
    <li> The price is great but the product isn&#x27;t.  I use the ointment myself, not on a pet.  I have to use twice as much of it as I do with other brands.  The tubes are to hard, it make it harder to completely empty the tube and they crack when you try to squeeze out the last of it.  The shipping time was great and so was the no shipping cost.</li>
    <li> i took my dog to the vet a while ago for a check up and when i told them i saw something in his eyes. the vet asked me if my dog sleeps with his eyes all the way closed and he dosnt. the vet also said that i needed this ointment which i didnt buy at first. when we went back yeaterday they added these drops on which was 25.00 and i have to use them everyday at night when he really goes to sleep. so i decided to look on here to see if i can find the same drops. here they are and for really cheap. needless to say i will be buying from here and not the vet.</li>
    <li> The same brand I was prescribed by the VA, just cheaper</li>
    <li> The Amazon price can&#x27;t be beat, I was paying the Vet more than twice this price.  Using the ointment every day for 2 years has worked to abate cherry-eye so my chihuahua has so far avoided surgery.  Shipping was fast but some of the ointment had leaked out onto the box, despite having been bubble-wrapped and mailed in a bubble bag.  Even so, I will continue to purchase this item on Amazon for the low price.  I don&#x27;t know whether the seller or the post office is to blame, but that&#x27;s why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.</li>
    <li> My eyes are very dry and I use this at bedtime.</li>
    <li> Great service and makes my eyes feel comfortable</li>
    <li> This is my second order of this product and it is everything I need.  I will re-order when I use my current purchase.    Thank You,    Ple777</li>
    <li> Great savings from purchasing on amazon instead of the vet. My dog doesn&#x27;t have a tear duct for one eye. So, I need this to be cheap because I&#x27;ll have to buy it for years.</li>
    <li> a good and cheaper substitute  for puralube. I apply this to my dogs eyes prior to bathing to give a little extra protection</li>
    <li> Has the thickness (83% white petrolatum) that makes it last. The only complaint I have is that the tube itself is somewhat stiffer than other brands I have used. That makes it impossible to get the last 10% (or so) of the ointment out of the tube.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice and thick and coats the eye well. I use this for my dog whose eyes get really dry during the winter months.</li>
    <li> My dog does not make tears in one eye.  These do the trick like many other options but these were cheaper at the time.  They do the same job as other tear ointments.  Buy them if the price works for you!</li>
    <li> This ointment (grease formulation) is great for my dog who has dry eye. If you have to use it on a regular basis, you will get use to getting everything out the tube. However the first couple of tubes you will probably waste as some as it get difficult to squeeze the tube when it gets low.</li>
    <li> When we order eyedrops, we normally order enough to last several months. However, if you want to try a product for a shorter period, try this. I think you&#x27;ll find it works just as well as the high-priced stuff you buy at the pharmacy.</li>
    <li> I use it wor my doge and it works wonderful,  His eyes are wide after I use it on him</li>
    <li> Easy to use and very useful to me.Thanks</li>
    <li> I was given this while in the hospital ... after I got out I tried to have my doctor write me a prescription for this.  I didn&#x27;t need a prescription and luckily found it on Amazon... I use this in my eyes several times a week.  Great price ... very soothing for dry eyes ... It does blur my vision but I use it when I&#x27;m going to bed.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Rather than lubricate and soothe dry eyes, this solution burns when you apply it, no matter how little you use.  This &amp;#34;ointment&amp;#34; may not be harmful to dogs, but I wouldn&#x27;t suggest it for humans.</li>
    <li> I tried to use this in place of prescription eye drops.  Not a big fan of the thickness and it didn&#x27;t really help with my condition at all.</li>
    <li> Great price. Saved $10 compared to what the vet charges.</li>
    <li> But it  keep the eyes lubricated,  ONLY USE it RIGHT BEFORE BED.  The lubricant keep your eyes foggy for sometime.</li>
    <li> Use all the time great</li>
    <li> will be ordering more</li>
    <li> I started buying this brand on Amazon in place of the one my vet sold me-- it&#x27;s about 1/3 of the cost. My guinea pig is blind in one eye and unable to produce his own natural lubricant so I have to apply artificial tears ointment to it 2-3 times daily. The ingredients are exactly the same as what my vet had given me and in the same concentration.</li>
    <li> My lab has a bit of an eye problem. He has some irritation due to a sty. The ointment must be really soothing for him because he easily lets me put it in his eye and the redness clears up in no time.</li>
    <li> Our vet prescribed these to our dog several months ago when the winter started making his eyes goo up. They&#x27;re half the price here on amazon as they are at the vet -- and they work well. The dog&#x27;s eyes are well hydrated and clear and we aren&#x27;t finding eye-goo crusted on them in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I kept waffling between giving this four and five stars. On the one hand, I do like the product and we&#x27;ve had no problems with it. Shipping has been timely and it appears to be identical to what we get at the vet (packaging, etc) and it works. On the other hand it&#x27;s not something I&#x27;m raving about wildly to friends - it&#x27;s a good, solid, product for artificial tears for an animal (no idea how it would work with a human) but it isn&#x27;t something thrilling. I like it, not love it. But... it had had 0 problems so far so I see no reason to subtract a star.</li>
    <li> Works just as well as the much more expensive brands.</li>
    <li> I have corneal dystrophy and cannot afford the expensive artificial tears ointment!&lt;br /&gt;This ointment is the quality of any other ointment on the market, and is affordable for me to use.  I am happy to have discovered this distributor.</li>
    <li> Good product. Great service. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have a hairless pet and one of his issues is that he doesn&#x27;t have eyelashes, so dust and dirt often get into his eyes causing irritation. I was advised to use an eye ointment to help his eyes out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little hesitant to use this on him because I saw a review mention that this product burns. So, I tested it on myself first and there was absolutely no burning and despite not having eye issues, my eyes felt really clear and...hydrated? I don&#x27;t know how to explain it. It was nice though :P&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this stuff is working great for him. Just two days and I am already seeing vast improvement in his eyes!</li>
    <li> If you have a dog and they need eye drops then this is the stuff to get!  It is in a gel form and you can rub it on with your finger.  Works great for my pug.</li>
    <li> After using Optimmune daily for 2 years, I found the artificial tears ointment while visiting a new vet. Now I only have to treat 1 - 2 times per week and the cost considerably less.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me by my vet for my little Jack Russell terrier.  He&#x27;s a bit elderly, 11 years old, and his eyes were constantly tearing. The doctor told me to apply a small amount, about 1/4\\&quot; to each eye daily, and lo and behold, his eyes are nice and bright and don&#x27;t tear.  The salve doesn&#x27;t bother him at all, and he actually seems to find it soothing. As soon as he sees me wash my hands in the morning after his breakfast, he stays right in place and I apply it. His eyes really look great!</li>
    <li> used this product before, very good and cheaper than the brands, with the same ingrediants as the brand....</li>
    <li> Wetness of the eye makes it hard to apply.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my Rottweiler, as she has mild entropian. This works very well for her. It keeps her from wiping her eye with her paw, as it keeps her eye well lubricated.</li>
    <li> This is very similar to other thick lubricant eye ointments recommended for stroke patients in that it contains mostly sterilized petroleum jelly (83%) and mineral oil (15%). But according to the box it also contains 2% lanolin oil. That&#x27;s not unusual in these eye ointments. Some of the best-selling and pricier ointments like Allergan&#x27;s Lacri-Lube also contain lanolin. But 2% is quite a lot in comparison to other ointments and the purchaser should be aware of this if there&#x27;s any possibility that the lanolin will irritate your eye. There are other eye ointments available here on Amazon that are formulated entirely of white petroletum and mineral oil and that do not contain lanolin. That said if the lanolin doesn&#x27;t bother your eye this is a good product at a great price.</li>
    <li> I just bought this for my dog and it works much better than what I was using before.  It keeps her eyes lubricated for longer and she does not mind when I apply the ointment.  Great product!</li>
    <li> Great produc for chronic dry eyet! Works a thousand times better than the $40.00 eye drops that I purchase at the Vet every month. Would hightly recommend.</li>
    <li> Great for dry eye syndrome.  Wouldn&#x27;t be without it.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product recommended by my veterinarian for my dog&#x27;s eyes. The dog has chronic dry eye and I apply this ointment before he goes to sleep at night. It helps immensely. From the Pharmapacks vendor, it costs only one-third as much as the vet charges.</li>
    <li> I thought it would be weird to put ointment in my eyes but amazingly not so much. It does what it is supposed to.</li>
    <li> I have used this product previously and it works very well.  I have three shih-Tzu&#x27;s with teir big eyes I ave the groomer use this hile getting their bt and the dryer doesn&#x27;t irritate if things are blown around.</li>
