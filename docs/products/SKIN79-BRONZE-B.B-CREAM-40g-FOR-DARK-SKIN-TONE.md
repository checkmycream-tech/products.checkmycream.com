      <li>so this one is good.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m Filipino by heritage so this perfectly matched my golden tan skin tone!</li>
      <li>For summer, when I&#x27;m a bit more tan, this would be great out of the bottle.</li>
      <li>Great for light tan filipino skin!</li>

      <li>I could even wear make up without applying power on top as it does not make my skin look oily !</li>

      <li>it feels really nice on the skin.</li>
      <li>it doesn&#x27;t have that light delicious floral smell, it makes my skin very shiny/ oily...</li>
      <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;Finish is very smooth.</li>
      <li>Be sure to let the product oxidize before you decide.</li>
      <li>Wish there were more color options.</li>
      <li>:)  </li>
      <li>My 40-something skin has never looked better.</li>
      <li>and I am 100% convinced it is authentic.</li>
      <li>But I can see if you have oily skin or combination skin, it might work better for you.</li>
      <li>Glad I tried it out</li>
      <li>I am fair skinned, but I am outdoors on a consistent basis enough so that I get a tan in spite of best efforts to wear protection.  </li>
      <li>Super happy and will be buying once I finish my first one.</li>
      <li>Love the light coverage and price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried it with the Orange and Pink and it works perfectly!  </li>
      <li>I use this bb cream to mix with other skin 79 bb creams are a bit light for my skin and it is perfect.</li>
      <li>The hot pink bb cream is quite light, but it goes on beautifully texture wise.  </li>
      <li>, i pump a little bit of this one and mix them to create my perfect shade.</li>
      <li>The Orange BB cream is just a tad light for me</li>
      <li>but this BB cream, made my skin bright and soft.</li>
      <li>The texture is light and medium coverage.</li>
      <li>I use the VIP gold and I love it very much.</li>
      <li>Feels super light as if I&#x27;m not wearing any make up at all.</li>
      <li>Then I saw this and was super excited they created a darker version, so I bought it.</li>
      <li>I would definitely recommend it for ppl who have a darker complexion that is looking for a good bb cream and for lighter skin users who would like to build their color by mixing it to get their wanted shade.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m currently using it as a primer for my eyes and it works just as good.</li>
      <li>While the bronze goes on nicely, after it has been applied (by itself or blended with the \\&quot;pink bottle\\&quot; bb cream)it feels somewhat \\&quot;tacky\\&quot; to the touch, for lack of a better description.</li>
      <li>BB Cream product can also be an excellent one for ebony skin, I&#x27;ll tell you why:  If you&#x27;re ebony skinned with very a very cool skin tone (too dark to be yellow toned, but don&#x27;t have any strong redness), and you find that most liquid foundations just pull too red or orange for you?  </li>
      <li>This blends well with the original \\&quot;hot pink\\&quot; skin79 bb cream to get the desired \\&quot;tone\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>When you put it on, it feels very light and natural.</li>
      <li>If you have combination to oily skin, you must have clean prepped skin first or else</li>
      <li>This may be a good investment for that kind of usage, this bottle will last you a very long time!</li>
      <li>It is sheerer than a regular foundation, though, which is nice for light-makeup days.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s light and easy with a nice subtle scent.</li>
      <li>Overall, I&#x27;m really happy with this product and can see myself buying it again in the future.</li>
      <li>a tiny bit of bronze mixed gives me a great color for my face.</li>
      <li>Very lightweight feeling!  </li>
      <li>Ordered and received one week later :)</li>
      <li>While this product is much too dark for me, I loved everything else about it.  </li>
      <li>This is the first BB cream that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>It works pretty well.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve worn  it with positive results in all those climates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love this stuff, I have been using the hot pink bb for a while now</li>
      <li>Who wants to be ashy looking?  </li>
      <li>Not too much is needed at all, otherwise you&#x27;ll see chalkiness.</li>
      <li>It really self-adjusts like nothing I&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so much lighter feeling on my face and it lasts all day.</li>
      <li>The formula is richer than I thought it would be for BB cream, which I know is meant to be very lightweight.</li>
      <li>i can&#x27;t use it by itself, not even when i get a tan haha.</li>
      <li>Not as thick as the Skin79 Orange and does not provide as good of a coverage.  </li>
      <li>It is made for more normal, combination or dry skin in my opinion as it seems dewey to me.  </li>
      <li>Natural looking and makes me looked very tanned!</li>
      <li>So far this is the only BB Cream that is not too light for my skin tone.</li>
      <li>I will probably mix this with my foundation if I get a tan to darken it and to add a high SPF.  </li>
      <li>What i do is if one of my other bb creams is way too light for lets</li>
      <li>Just a drop of this makes a huge difference and cancels out that extra red.  </li>
      <li>The bronze I bought from Katie the Babe as I read reviews that she sells authentic bb creams, but I have to say, it is so different then the pink one that I am doubting it&#x27;s authenticity.</li>
      <li>but it is such a thin consistency, again nothing like the pink, so not the best coverage.</li>
      <li>and although I love the other skin79 products, they had a gray after sheen that I didn&#x27;t like, similar to like that of sunblock.</li>
      <li>However, I discovered that if I mixed it with my other Skin79 BB Creams, I can get a better color match for me.  </li>
      <li>but my skin tone is much darker than what the hot pink was.</li>
      <li>I have always loved the texture and feel of this brand and the fact that a very small amount goes a long way.</li>
      <li>So I bought the pink skin 79 bb cream months ago and looooved everything about it, only thing was it is too light for my skin tone.</li>
      <li>At first I thought I would not get much use of this because the color is too dark for me.</li>
      <li>gray or ashen yuck!)This BB cream is great for darker Asian skin tones.</li>
      <li>asian bb cream that REALLY BLENDS with darker skin tones.  </li>
      <li>This provided seamless coverage</li>
      <li>Leaves a dewy natural look.</li>
      <li>The bronze almost matches my skin completely.</li>
      <li>It is perfect for the dewy, no-makeup look and also works well as a moisturizer base for your foundation.</li>
      <li>This product works wonderfully to cool the color down without lightening the actual shade too much.  </li>
      <li>I do this at night before I go to bed, and my skin is perfectly blank after a quick wipe down and ready to receive this product.  </li>
      <li>If I treat my skin right, this will last all day long until I want to take it off, even in humid weather, hot weather, dry weather, etc.  </li>
      <li>The shipping speed was impressive and she sent me two samples which I am very thankful for, but sad to say, I am considering returning it and buying it from soulglamour or directly from the skin 79 website, and if this is the real product then I won&#x27;t buy it from any other sellers because frankly, it sucks.</li>
      <li>I tried the Missha brand in shade 31 and that was way too light colored and felt very heavy on my face.  </li>
      <li>I tried a few other BB creams before this one, trying to find one that matched my darker complexion (most others made my skin look</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not really meant for dark skin people, just light brown people.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is the first BB cream that I&#x27;ve used. The formula is richer than I thought it would be for BB cream, which I know is meant to be very lightweight. It is sheerer than a regular foundation, though, which is nice for light-makeup days. For summer, when I&#x27;m a bit more tan, this would be great out of the bottle. For now, I will be buying a lighter BB cream and mixing the two. For reference, I&#x27;m an NC40 in MAC and Skin79 is closer to an NC42, I&#x27;d say.</li>
    <li> I bought this not expecting it to be so dark, but omg it was, so i can&#x27;t use it by itself, not even when i get a tan haha. What i do is if one of my other bb creams is way too light for lets say my summer skin tone, i pump a little bit of this one and mix them to create my perfect shade. So even though i can&#x27;t use it by itself i found a good use for it. Just like other skin 79 bbcreams it feels really nice on the skin.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, I have been using the hot pink bb for a while now but my skin tone is much darker than what the hot pink was. The bronze almost matches my skin completely. I actually now use the bronze and the hot pink together and apply it when I do contouring. Perfect shades together. I like that it doesn&#x27;t feel &#x27;make-up-y&#x27; and it looks like I&#x27;m not really wearing anything. Leaves a dewy natural look. If I want matte then I just throw some powder over it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my Mom, she likes the BB, but this was just off and even though the color was darker it just wasn&#x27;t the same.</li>
    <li> Great for light tan filipino skin! No breakouts and noticing it evening my skin tone after two weeks . Ordered and received one week later :)</li>
    <li> asian bb cream that REALLY BLENDS with darker skin tones.  I have always loved the texture and feel of this brand and the fact that a very small amount goes a long way.</li>
    <li> While this product is much too dark for me, I loved everything else about it.  It smells great and feels nice on the skin.  Very lightweight feeling!  Not as thick as the Skin79 Orange and does not provide as good of a coverage.  It is made for more normal, combination or dry skin in my opinion as it seems dewey to me.  I would not recommend this if you are oily as it will just make you  shiny!  I am a big fan of Skin79 so when I saw this, I had to try it.  I will probably mix this with my foundation if I get a tan to darken it and to add a high SPF.  Glad I tried it out and I have various options to make it work for me.    Bought this from Katie the Babe who always delivers an authentic product timely!    AMENDED 914/14:  At first I thought I would not get much use of this because the color is too dark for me. However, I discovered that if I mixed it with my other Skin79 BB Creams, I can get a better color match for me.  I&#x27;ve tried it with the Orange and Pink and it works perfectly!  The Pink BB cream has a gray tone to it so if you add a small amount of this Bronze BB cream, it cancels the gray undertone!  Perfect!  Who wants to be ashy looking?  :)  The Orange BB cream is just a tad light for me so when I mix the Bronze in with it, I have the perfect color as well!!  Orange is my favorite as it is made for oily skin and has a high SPF factor, but I&#x27;ve been using the pink because the Orange seems to be on back order.  :(   This is a must for everyone out there who loves the Skin79 BB cream, but don&#x27;t fit perfectly with the color match!  LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> I use this bb cream to mix with other skin 79 bb creams are a bit light for my skin and it is perfect. The texture is light and medium coverage. I have oily skin but I don&#x27;t like it when the bb cream is too thick because it feels uncomfortable and heavy so this one is good.</li>
    <li> My 40-something skin has never looked better. I switched from mineral make up.  I mix this with the lighter color for summer. No break-outs. Be sure to let the product oxidize before you decide. It really self-adjusts like nothing I&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
    <li> So I bought the pink skin 79 bb cream months ago and looooved everything about it, only thing was it is too light for my skin tone. It keeps my sin from getting oily, it provides great coverage, the floral smell is delicious, I fell in love! Then I saw this and was super excited they created a darker version, so I bought it. I received this product 3 or 4 days ago and I am disappointed! It is nothing like the pink one &#x3D;( it doesn&#x27;t have that light delicious floral smell, it makes my skin very shiny/ oily... It feels like I have been wearing makeup in the sun all day.. and it feels heavy, unlike the pink one. Its a nice color but it is such a thin consistency, again nothing like the pink, so not the best coverage. I had bought my pink one from seoulglamour and I am 100% convinced it is authentic. The bronze I bought from Katie the Babe as I read reviews that she sells authentic bb creams, but I have to say, it is so different then the pink one that I am doubting it&#x27;s authenticity. The shipping speed was impressive and she sent me two samples which I am very thankful for, but sad to say, I am considering returning it and buying it from soulglamour or directly from the skin 79 website, and if this is the real product then I won&#x27;t buy it from any other sellers because frankly, it sucks. I don&#x27;t understand why they would come up with a product that is SO different from the others. Anyone has any insight on this? Thank you.</li>
    <li> Love the light coverage and price.&lt;br /&gt;I also bought another bb cream.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with this quality product.&lt;br /&gt;Finish is very smooth.</li>
    <li> Natural looking and makes me looked very tanned!</li>
    <li> I use the VIP gold and I love it very much. I don&#x27;t get pimples using this product so I decided to try this bronze version. I didn&#x27;t expect it to be extremely dark for my skin. Since it is very dark, I only use a very tiny bit to mix with my VIP gold just to add color. The VIP gold is very pale and a tiny bit of bronze mixed gives me a great color for my face. This bottle will probably last me a very very very long time since I only use so little of it. I would definitely recommend it for ppl who have a darker complexion that is looking for a good bb cream and for lighter skin users who would like to build their color by mixing it to get their wanted shade.</li>
    <li> I tried a few other BB creams before this one, trying to find one that matched my darker complexion (most others made my skin look gray or ashen yuck!)This BB cream is great for darker Asian skin tones. I&#x27;m Filipino by heritage so this perfectly matched my golden tan skin tone! Feels super light as if I&#x27;m not wearing any make up at all. One pump of this stuff usually goes all over the face. You have to set it with powder to prevent your face from looking too oily. Overall, I&#x27;m really happy with this product and can see myself buying it again in the future. Definitely try this product if you have a darker skin tone and are looking for a Korean BB cream</li>
    <li> Is this product for black woman?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m hooked on this and will never wear foundation again if I can help it. It&#x27;s so much lighter feeling on my face and it lasts all day. I get fairly dark in the summer and this is the only BB cream that even comes close to matching my skin tone.  You do have to let it set before the color truly matches but that&#x27;s how BB cream works.  I tried the Missha brand in shade 31 and that was way too light colored and felt very heavy on my face.

    <li> Great coverage. Wish there were more color options.</li>
    <li> It works pretty well. It&#x27;s not really meant for dark skin people, just light brown people. I&#x27;m currently using it as a primer for my eyes and it works just as good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m hawaiian so I have tanned skin and this matched wonderfuly. I always wanted a product out of Korea.</li>
    <li> If you have combination to oily skin, you must have clean prepped skin first or else this product will do evil things to you during its tenure on your face during the day.  Wear will be greatly improved if you have a diligent regimen of makeup removal, exfoliating cleanse, tone, serum, moisturizer.  I do this at night before I go to bed, and my skin is perfectly blank after a quick wipe down and ready to receive this product.  If I treat my skin right, this will last all day long until I want to take it off, even in humid weather, hot weather, dry weather, etc.  I&#x27;ve worn  it with positive results in all those climates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This BB Cream product can also be an excellent one for ebony skin, I&#x27;ll tell you why:  If you&#x27;re ebony skinned with very a very cool skin tone (too dark to be yellow toned, but don&#x27;t have any strong redness), and you find that most liquid foundations just pull too red or orange for you?  This product works wonderfully to cool the color down without lightening the actual shade too much.  Just a drop of this makes a huge difference and cancels out that extra red.  Not too much is needed at all, otherwise you&#x27;ll see chalkiness. This may be a good investment for that kind of usage, this bottle will last you a very long time!</li>
    <li> I tried other BB creams and they are too white for me. This BB crème has great coverage, no so greasy, and feels light on my skin. I could even wear make up without applying power on top as it does not make my skin look oily !</li>
    <li> I love it! i switched my BB creams &amp; foudations with this one, I don&#x27;t use anything but this BB cream, made my skin bright and soft.</li>
    <li> So far this is the only BB Cream that is not too light for my skin tone. When you put it on, it feels very light and natural. It&#x27;s not moisturizing which doesn&#x27;t help my dry skin. But I can see if you have oily skin or combination skin, it might work better for you. The only issue I have, is when it oxidizes, it becomes too dark for my skin tone in the winter time. I have not yet tried it on in the summer, but it may work nicely since I am tanner then. For now, I may have to try blending another SKIN79 bb cream to match my skin tone. I wouldn&#x27;t call it the ultimate BB cream but it is a very nice product.</li>
    <li> Excellent Korean BB cream for my brown Filipino skin. It cleared blemishes and marks left by pimples in two weeks. It is perfect for the dewy, no-makeup look and also works well as a moisturizer base for your foundation.</li>
    <li> As other reviewers have said, this does have a bit of an orange undertone but not wildly so, and it doesn&#x27;t go on \\&quot;orange\\&quot; on my particular skin tone.  I am fair skinned, but I am outdoors on a consistent basis enough so that I get a tan in spite of best efforts to wear protection.  This blends well with the original \\&quot;hot pink\\&quot; skin79 bb cream to get the desired \\&quot;tone\\&quot;. The hot pink bb cream is quite light, but it goes on beautifully texture wise.  I gave this 4 stars because of the texture.  While the bronze goes on nicely, after it has been applied (by itself or blended with the \\&quot;pink bottle\\&quot; bb cream)it feels somewhat \\&quot;tacky\\&quot; to the touch, for lack of a better description.</li>
    <li> I love this bb cream!! I&#x27;m medium brown in skin color and although I love the other skin79 products, they had a gray after sheen that I didn&#x27;t like, similar to like that of sunblock. This provided seamless coverage but it wasn&#x27;t bulky - my skin definitely had room to breathe and it&#x27;s light and easy with a nice subtle scent. I like to use this to even out my skin tone and usually just layer or spot blot if there&#x27;s anything else to cover. This tiny bottle lasts a long time and does not clog my pores either. Super happy and will be buying once I finish my first one.</li>
    <li> It definitely covers up really well, but at the same time, it was really heavy and hard to remove. I would continue using it, but the color was actually too dark for me. I&#x27;m a tanned east asian, so I&#x27;m brown but with a yellow undertone.</li>
