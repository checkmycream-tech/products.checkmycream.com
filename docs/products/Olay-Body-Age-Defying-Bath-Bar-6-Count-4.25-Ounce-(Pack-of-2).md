      <li>loved the soap would buy again from seller</li>
      <li>It is not unscented but it&#x27;s a good scent.</li>
      <li>The lather is good too.  </li>
      <li>Quality is good couldn&#x27;t find it in store</li>
      <li>Your skin feels clean,soft and smells good all day.  </li>
      <li>All in all, a great body bar that I hope will continue to be available.</li>
      <li>It has a great clean scent.</li>
      <li>This soap smells great, its a clean scent, not overpowering, and it is great for my sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>I just love this soap.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>The downside is that you can probably get a better deal at a store.</li>
      <li>I was able to do that by way of a coupon</li>
      <li>I love the scent, it&#x27;s not \\&quot;too much\\&quot;,</li>
      <li>&quot; kind of smell but a little softer and more feminine.  very nice!</li>
      <li>The fragrance is mild and nice.  </li>
      <li>So it now has some of the original more luxurious, chunky feel while still allowing it to fit easily in one hand.</li>
      <li>so got it in online and quality is also good and feels very soft.</li>
      <li>sometimes it isn&#x27;t available at our store here..</li>
      <li>So I was very happy to discover with the most recent pack of Age Defying bath bars I bought, that Olay has gone back to a thicker bar (height-wise), but slimmer so that it&#x27;s easier to hold.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It also leaves the body feeling clean without any filminess after.</li>
      <li>I have been using Olay soap for many years now and it works better for my sensitive skin than Dove.  </li>
      <li>Olay, Age Defying Bath Bar is great for dry skin.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found that it&#x27;s much more gentle and moisturizing than the highly-touted Dove bar that I used to use, and each bar lasts longer.</li>
      <li>These were such a great deal -- a much better price than at my local drug store!  </li>
      <li>One of my favorite beauty products by far!</li>
      <li>Love the fragrance -- great soap to use when you have really hard water!  </li>
      <li>These moisturizing bars not only smell nice</li>
      <li>A handy tip as the bars seemed to get smaller with almost every purchase.</li>
      <li>I just love the fact that amazon offers coupons.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very light and can barely be detected after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>scent of the bar has changed a bit over the years (not quite as deep, rich and mellow a fragrance), but I still enjoy it, even though the fragrance is now a bit sharper.</li>
      <li>This is the only soap they I use and love it.  </li>
      <li>but they leave my skin feeling soft and smooth.  </li>
      <li>She says it leaves her skin soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>I first discovered this soap when house-sitting for a friend who used it, and it was the scent that attracted me, as well as the hefty size of the bar.</li>
      <li>(I used to use the original Olay pink bars, but the scent changed and was too strong), and I can&#x27;t find another</li>
      <li>Now, if they could only recreate the original fragrance!</li>
      <li>I still use a body moisturizer every day, but it&#x27;s nice to know that if I have to skip it for some reason, my bath bar won&#x27;t let me down.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a guy, but love this product because I have dry skin.  </li>
      <li>This discourages moths, makes my closets and clothing drawers smell great, and it also allows the bars to dry out a bit, which is an old trick for making a bar of soap last longer.</li>
      <li>Lathers very well.</li>
      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>Reasonable price compared to store prices.</li>
      <li>Even though the bars have gotten thinner and smaller over the years, I&#x27;ve remained a loyal purchaser.</li>
      <li>This soap is highly fragranced so if you are allergic to fragrance this is definetely not for you.</li>
      <li>Back then, the bars were very large and luxurious - more like an expensive French-milled bar, and almost too large to hold easily in one hand.</li>
      <li>This soap smooths skin meaning it exfolliates and too much exfollation on mature skin makes it drier</li>
      <li>Makes a nice thick lather and rinses off leaving skin feeling like lotion was applied.</li>
      <li>These bars are very creamy, hardly have a scent (good for my allergies) and last a long time.</li>
      <li>It makes your skin feel so soft.</li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised by this product.  </li>
      <li>and my skin is mature.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It also does not last as long as most other bar soaps.</li>
      <li>Later in the day, it came as a nice surprise to discover that I didn&#x27;t even miss the body moisturizer - my skin felt smooth, soft and not the least bit tight or dry.</li>
      <li>Every time I would find that the bars had been reduced in size yet again, I&#x27;d tell myself that if they got any smaller, I was going to have to find a new brand of body bar.</li>
      <li>I rec&#x27;d my order very fast and paid much less than I would have anywhere else...</li>
      <li>However, having used a body moisturizer after bathing since I was very young, I couldn&#x27;t really say just how well the Olay bar moisturized until one recent day when I was in such a hurry that I had to skip my usual body moisturizing routine after showering.</li>
      <li>so I notice my normal odor sooner than with other soaps I have used.&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The local Walmart stores used to carry this brand -- all of the sudden it&#x27;s nowhere to be found. Works great not just as a body wash, but is perfect for my face.</li>
    <li> I am so impressed with this soap. It makes your skin feel so soft. It is not unscented but it&#x27;s a good scent.</li>
    <li> It leaves you well mosturized.  It does not provide a deodorant so I notice my normal odor sooner than with other soaps I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also does not last as long as most other bar soaps.</li>
    <li> This is the only soap they I use and love it.  The downside is that you can probably get a better deal at a store. If you don&#x27;t feel like driving to get it then get it on amazon.</li>
    <li> I first discovered this soap when house-sitting for a friend who used it, and it was the scent that attracted me, as well as the hefty size of the bar.

I still use a body moisturizer every day, but it&#x27;s nice to know that if I have to skip it for some reason, my bath bar won&#x27;t let me down. Another big plus - this soap doesn&#x27;t leave any residue on the skin, or those white, powdery rings around nail cuticles like some soaps can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent of the bar has changed a bit over the years (not quite as deep, rich and mellow a fragrance), but I still enjoy it, even though the fragrance is now a bit sharper. I usually buy the six-bar packs, and when I get them home, I open the end of each box and put a couple of boxes in my closets and one each in my clothes drawers.

All in all, a great body bar that I hope will continue to be available.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Your skin feels clean,soft and smells good all day.  Makes a nice thick lather and rinses off leaving skin feeling like lotion was applied.</li>
    <li> Quality is good couldn&#x27;t find it in store so got it in online and quality is also good and feels very soft.</li>
    <li> These were such a great deal -- a much better price than at my local drug store!  Love the fragrance -- great soap to use when you have really hard water!  Lathers very well.</li>
    <li> These bars are very creamy, hardly have a scent (good for my allergies) and last a long time. Great value for the price!</li>
    <li> These moisturizing bars not only smell nice but they leave my skin feeling soft and smooth.  How I ordered twelve of these, I don&#x27;t know but I&#x27;ve put some of them in my lingerie drawer until I get to use them in the shower.  I find that bar soap is easier to use than body wash or gel,and it&#x27;s cheaper also.</li>
    <li> I always buy Olay soap, since it is moisturizing and has a great scent!  Reasonable price compared to store prices.</li>
    <li> Olay, Age Defying Bath Bar is great for dry skin.  It moisturizes great and lathers up nicely in the shower.</li>
    <li> I rec&#x27;d my order very fast and paid much less than I would have anywhere else...12 bars of soap!! Love It!!</li>
    <li> I just love this soap. It smells very good and so good for your skin. I paid just under $7.00 for 12 bars of this soap and to me that was an excellent price. I was able to do that by way of a coupon amazon was offering for this product. I just love the fact that amazon offers coupons.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite beauty products by far! I use this for my face and body. It has a great clean scent.</li>
    <li> This soap is highly fragranced so if you are allergic to fragrance this is definetely not for you. This soap is moisturizing for your body however I have very dry skin on my face also and my skin is mature. This soap smooths skin meaning it exfolliates and too much exfollation on mature skin makes it drier so found I could not use it for my face.</li>
    <li> My wife swears by this. She says it leaves her skin soft and smooth. I snuck this into the cabinet in order to be the emergency savior when she ran out of her overpriced imported Asian soap. She loves it, and so does my Amex.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised by this product.  The fragrance is mild and nice.  The lather is good too.  I didn&#x27;t care about the age defying claim, but rather the price.  I would buy again.</li>
    <li> I have been using Olay soap for many years now and it works better for my sensitive skin than Dove.  The price online is cheaper than at Walmart and I get it delivered to my door.  A great product that anyone with itching after bathing or showering should try.</li>
    <li> I get migraines, and it&#x27;s very difficult for me to find a body bar soap with a scent that doesn&#x27;t trigger one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Olay is one of the only brands I can use. I have tried unscented, but I like a little scent. I find that the Age Defying bar is the least scented of all the scents. It&#x27;s very light and can barely be detected after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It depends on what scents may bother you, but I have been using this almost since Age Defying came out (I used to use the original Olay pink bars, but the scent changed and was too strong), and I can&#x27;t find another I like more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also leaves the body feeling clean without any filminess after.</li>
    <li> This soap smells great, its a clean scent, not overpowering, and it is great for my sensitive skin.  You can also use it on your face.  I love the scent, it&#x27;s not \\&quot;too much\\&quot;, sort of a \\&quot;white soap\\&quot; kind of smell but a little softer and more feminine.  very nice!</li>
    <li> I use this body soap because my skin tends to dry out..sometimes it isn&#x27;t available at our store here..now I can get it shipped regularly and not have to hunt for it..thanks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy, but love this product because I have dry skin.  Since switching to this soap, much less of problem.</li>
    <li> loved the soap would buy again from seller</li>
