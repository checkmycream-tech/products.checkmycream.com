      <li>My teenage daughter uses Neutrogena acne stress control power foam wash and is very happy with the results.  </li>

      <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>Absolutely love it, it doesn&#x27;t even sting when using it</li>
      <li>and I produce more sebum.  </li>

      <li>Gets off all dirt and makeup and leaves your face super clean!</li>
      <li>Compared to earlier, this is amazing!</li>
      <li>I am a teen and I produce plenty of oil and after washing my face with this it feels good</li>
      <li>Yet to see full results but it seems like it is helping</li>
      <li>Neutrogena&#x27;s Oil-Free Acne Wash Foam Cleanser was my absolute favorite.</li>
      <li>- If you&#x27;re not, use the On-The-Go [works better if you keep it in your face longer (during the whole day, but DO NOT EXPOSE YOUR FACE, SUN CAN</li>
      <li>This is good for non-sensitive, non-dry skin with mild to moderate breakouts.</li>
      <li>and it really makes my face feel very clean.</li>
      <li>Basically I did quick research and started using a 5% Salicylic acid solution with micro-beads for 6 weeks</li>
      <li>oh well.. maybe I got lucky.</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t find this Acne Stress Control Foam Wash as effective, but it does the job better than the others I have tried (including Neutrogena&#x27;s other product</li>
      <li>works good, only the pump gave out and doesn&#x27;t spring back up, kind of a pain.</li>
      <li>I simple love this product!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s only 0.5% salicylic acid, about one-quarter the strength of most Clearasil overnight products, but that turns out to be good enough for me.  </li>
      <li>, this is how I take care of my face every single day and it became way better!</li>
      <li>Pills seem to do better than topical things.</li>
      <li>I have used many different types of cleansers with my Clarisonic Mia2.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products over the years, and this is the only one that keeps my skin clear, smooth, and blemish-free.  </li>
      <li>Rinses clean and keeps my skin clear.  </li>
      <li>I was actually doing more damage with the other product which was a proactive product which I am sure</li>
      <li>It has a somewhat strong, chemical scent; the same scent that is in all the Acne Stress Control products.</li>
      <li>Everyone in the house has had great success with this product (taking mild acne down to one blemish every few weeks or so).  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re sensitive to strong fragrances, you&#x27;ll probably want to steer clear of this one.</li>
      <li>Smells great and doesn&#x27;t dry your skin like other acne wash.</li>
      <li>But yes, it works and really suits my skin.</li>
      <li>I really like this acne cleanser.</li>
      <li>So I bought this product because of its low concentration and had good results within the first week(better than the previous 6).  </li>
      <li>But there&#x27;s no product who acts by itself, if you want to try out a new brand, buy the whole treatment!</li>
      <li>We have an Amazon subscription and receive a new shipment every 6 weeks, which is convenient and ensures she never runs out!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used many products over the years (except ProActive and others of that ilk) and this is definitely not going to help moderate or severe acne.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s $20 from a brand that normally sells their product for $8 on the Walmart shelf.</li>
      <li>This is my new go to cleanser.</li>
      <li>But I insist that you should keep trying out new products...</li>
      <li>I personally don&#x27;t need to use any other products from the rest of its line, cause the cleanser works its magic all by itself.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s foam, so it doesn&#x27;t clog your pores like so many creams, and it washes off easily (no more rinsing...and rinsing...and rinsing).</li>
      <li>Even used during Maine winter months does not dry out skin as much as soap.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It also helps clear up post marks.</li>
      <li>The size is very convenient and seems to last quite a while.  </li>
      <li>Nevertheless I use it daily and really rely on it, no one else makes a self-foaming acne/face wash</li>
      <li>(forget about stores), I&#x27;ve started buying it directly from neutrogena, which has been a godsend.</li>
      <li>The dryness and tightening are natural because it almost works like a chemical peel.</li>
      <li>I have quite sensitive skin</li>
      <li>Hydrating Acne Treatment, Triple Action toner and Rapid Clear</li>
      <li>People like me in their 30&#x27;s or older should only use a 0.5% solution without micro-beads.  </li>
      <li>I woke up this morning with 24 new tiny zits on my face, and they&#x27;ve just increased in number throughout the day.</li>
      <li>I am mid 30-s and had a acne breakout on my forehead after about 16 years of clear skin.  </li>
      <li>Just wet your face, pump how ever much you want into your hands, then</li>
      <li>So I did some more research about Salicylic acid and found out that as you age your skin starts to thin.  </li>
      <li>I have an oily face and this keeps my skin clear of acne; however, I am a middle aged female</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Form is not as efficient as gel</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products over the years, and this is the only one that keeps my skin clear, smooth, and blemish-free.  It has a nice smell and froths up deliciously into a foam.  One or two pumps are all you need for your face.  I hope they never stop offering this product!  I can&#x27;t find it in our local store anymore, so thank you, Amazon, for carrying it.</li>
    <li> love how it cleans the skin and works wonders on my son skin well rebuy</li>
    <li> My teenage daughter uses Neutrogena acne stress control power foam wash and is very happy with the results.  It is a great alternative to the acne products sold on infomercials on TV, and much more affordable.  We have an Amazon subscription and receive a new shipment every 6 weeks, which is convenient and ensures she never runs out!</li>
    <li> Great product! Works great for my skin</li>
    <li> Excellent product....</li>
    <li> I used to use the previous version of this cleanser, the orange liquid in the cylindrical bottle, but that was discontinued years ago. This is an excellent substitute, though more \\&quot;complicated\\&quot; with Stress Control and micro-whatever. It even has cucumber and other extracts in it which I could do without. Nevertheless I use it daily and really rely on it, no one else makes a self-foaming acne/face wash and I really can&#x27;t do with the waste involved in foaming a cream in your hands. Just wet your face, pump how ever much you want into your hands, then apply.&lt;br /&gt;As it has become increasingly difficult to find this online (forget about stores), I&#x27;ve started buying it directly from neutrogena, which has been a godsend.</li>
    <li> I love this product its the best facial cleaser out  there.</li>
    <li> I like the foam and scent of it. I have a very hard time with my acne so not much of anything works as well as I wish it would. Pills seem to do better than topical things. got on sale great with coupon code.</li>
    <li> Cleans well, but really dried me out. I am a teen and I produce plenty of oil and after washing my face with this it feels good but then my facial pH gets all unbalanced and I produce more sebum.  Would not recommend to any type of skin, just wash your face with water  0.25% salicylic acid is a joke</li>
    <li> Love this face wash! Gets off all dirt and makeup and leaves your face super clean!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  Rinses clean and keeps my skin clear.  Wish I could find it more readily available in stores.</li>
    <li> This is good for non-sensitive, non-dry skin with mild to moderate breakouts. It can be used daily in all but the driest winter weather. It has a somewhat strong, chemical scent; the same scent that is in all the Acne Stress Control products. If you&#x27;re sensitive to strong fragrances, you&#x27;ll probably want to steer clear of this one. The pump dispenser on the one I have seems to be faulty, but it isn&#x27;t broken and it still dispenses enough product. A little goes a long way, also. This cannot be depended upon to help clear skin by itself, but in a regimen of other products for acne-prone skin it&#x27;s a good and inexpensive option. Those with dry and/or sensitive skin might find this a little hard on their skin.</li>
    <li> THIS IS NOT GOING TO SOLVE YOUR PROBLEMS BY ITSELF!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should buy also 3-in-1 Hydrating Acne Treatment, Triple Action toner and Rapid Clear On-The-Go (most important!)&lt;br /&gt;All of them works perfectly together!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 - Wash your face with this product in the morning&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.1 - Use the toner + sun block if you&#x27;re going out...&lt;br /&gt;2.2 - If you&#x27;re not, use the On-The-Go [works better if you keep it in your face longer (during the whole day, but DO NOT EXPOSE YOUR FACE, SUN CAN BURN!)]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 - At night (before going to bed), wash your face again with Power Foam Wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 - Use 3-in-1 Hydrating Acne Treatment once in 2-3 days (you don&#x27;t want your face shiny nor oily)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, this is how I take care of my face every single day and it became way better! When I moved to the US, from Brazil.. I got A LOT of acne and red stuff in my face because of the different food and weather. I tried Pro-acne and it didn&#x27;t work as I expected or they advertized. But, bodies change from person to person. Maybe what works for me, it doesn&#x27;t for you! But I insist that you should keep trying out new products... But there&#x27;s no product who acts by itself, if you want to try out a new brand, buy the whole treatment!</li>
    <li> So, now it costs $20. You&#x27;re all wondering, why buy this? It&#x27;s $20 from a brand that normally sells their product for $8 on the Walmart shelf. Well, my friends, what we have here is a discontinued item. It works so well the world was scared of its effectiveness and took it off the market. It&#x27;s foam, so it doesn&#x27;t clog your pores like so many creams, and it washes off easily (no more rinsing...and rinsing...and rinsing). I&#x27;ve used it going on 6 years, and I&#x27;ll sell my plasma for extra money to purchase this before I try to find something else out there that works this well.</li>
    <li> Everyone in the house has had great success with this product (taking mild acne down to one blemish every few weeks or so).  Even used during Maine winter months does not dry out skin as much as soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have begun to stock pile in the event it is discontinued, please give it a try for yourself.</li>
    <li> Great  face wash for oily skin. Been using it for several years.</li>
    <li> I really like this acne cleanser. It doesnt irritate my skin which is great and it really makes my face feel very clean.</li>
    <li> I bought this because once a month or so my face breaks out a little bit, not much maybe one or 2 pimples. I thought I could use it all the time in between. Apparently not. I have been using this for over a month now and my acne has gotten worse! Instead of my usual one or 2.. My chin was covered! It made my face feel tight and dry and uncomfortable! Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> Smells great and doesn&#x27;t dry your skin like other acne wash.</li>
    <li> works good, only the pump gave out and doesn&#x27;t spring back up, kind of a pain.</li>
    <li> Yet to see full results but it seems like it is helping</li>
    <li> Neutrogena&#x27;s Oil-Free Acne Wash Foam Cleanser was my absolute favorite. That is the orange liquid foam wash. Sadly it was discontinued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t find this Acne Stress Control Foam Wash as effective, but it does the job better than the others I have tried (including Neutrogena&#x27;s other product lines).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As another reviewer pointed out, the dispenser is defective. I&#x27;ve been through a handful of these bottles, and all of them experienced pumping issues before the product was finished. I would have to manually pull the pump up to dispense again.</li>
    <li> I am mid 30-s and had a acne breakout on my forehead after about 16 years of clear skin.  Also mentioning that I have fair skin.  Basically I did quick research and started using a 5% Salicylic acid solution with micro-beads for 6 weeks and it did nothing.  So I did some more research about Salicylic acid and found out that as you age your skin starts to thin.  So if you are 13 you should be using a 5% and if you are in your 20&#x27;s you should be using a 2%.  People like me in their 30&#x27;s or older should only use a 0.5% solution without micro-beads.  So I bought this product because of its low concentration and had good results within the first week(better than the previous 6).  I was actually doing more damage with the other product which was a proactive product which I am sure works good for the kid in high school.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for almost 2 years.  Never had a single breakout.  You have to use it every morning and every night in order for it to work.  Best acne wash I have found in the market!  There is one little thing I didn&#x27;t like and it has nothing to do with the potency of this product.  I ordered 3 of these and one of them arrived without cap.  oh well.. maybe I got lucky.</li>
    <li> I have used Neutrogena Acne Stress Control, Power Foam Wash for a couple of years and it works great for me.  Keeps my oilyness in check. Will order this again.</li>
    <li> I love this product and am always frustrated that its availibility in local stores (Walmart and Targe) is hit or miss.  It is gentle, does not dry out my skin and a little goes a long way!!  I have an oily face and this keeps my skin clear of acne; however, I am a middle aged female so maybe acne is no longer an issue for me (it was when I was younger).  I have been using this product for several years now; twice a day.  My face feels refreshed after each use.</li>
    <li> I have oily skin and recently had an acne breakout, so I researched a lot of products and decided this was the best for me.  I only gave it 4 stars because despite my oily skin it dries it a lot after I wash my face, I would recommend to moisturize right after you use it, I am using the neutrogena clear skin sunscreen after I wash my face as a base and problem solved.  It is a good product and smells delicious.</li>
    <li> I have quite sensitive skin and my dermatologist recommended this foam face wash. Its not a magic potion to see results overnight. But yes, it works and really suits my skin. The dryness and tightening are natural because it almost works like a chemical peel. But in all, a great product and i totally love it.</li>
    <li> I simple love this product!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. But why is it so damn expensive??????</li>
    <li> This product sucks. This dried out my skin soo much. It made it flake and made my pimples bleed. It just made my skin a lot worse. But this worked amazing for my sister! she suffers with acne and her acne was gone in about a month! it just wasn&#x27;t for me! it might work for you.</li>
    <li> This cleanser is GREAT!! I personally don&#x27;t need to use any other products from the rest of its line, cause the cleanser works its magic all by itself. But is sucks how expensive it is now, and that you cant buy it at any store. It use to be about $6-9, so this price change is shocking and ridiculous!!</li>
    <li> Excellent. I have used many different types of cleansers with my Clarisonic Mia2. This is an affordable and effective product. It also helps clear up post marks. I have been using this for two months now and love it. This is my new go to cleanser.</li>
    <li> This product is great for those of us suffering with mild acne.  It&#x27;s only 0.5% salicylic acid, about one-quarter the strength of most Clearasil overnight products, but that turns out to be good enough for me.  I get the best results when I leave it on my face for about five extra seconds before washing it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the foaming nature of this facewash, as well as the light scent.  It doesn&#x27;t dry my face out, either.  The size is very convenient and seems to last quite a while.  All in all, I&#x27;m very happy with this product.  I&#x27;ve used many products over the years (except ProActive and others of that ilk) and this is definitely not going to help moderate or severe acne.</li>
    <li> I started using this a few days ago when I ran out of my previous cleanser.  Ohmygoodness. I woke up this morning with 24 new tiny zits on my face, and they&#x27;ve just increased in number throughout the day. My skin is red and peeling and painful to touch. I&#x27;ve never experienced anything like it. I vaguely remember not liking Neutrogena products from high school, but I thought I would give it a try again.  Badddd decision.</li>
    <li> My face has never been cleaner! It took about a week, and now I only have minor problems, which lasts for less than two days. Compared to earlier, this is amazing! Absolutely love it, it doesn&#x27;t even sting when using it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this acne foam wash for a few years now and it really helps keep my acne under control.</li>
