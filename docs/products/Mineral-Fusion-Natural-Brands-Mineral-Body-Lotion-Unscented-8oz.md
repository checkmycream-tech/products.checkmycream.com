      <li>I feel good that I&#x27;m not smearing questionable chemicals all over</li>
      <li>(most lotions cause me breakout and redness, even expensive face lotions for sensitive skin).</li>
      <li>This one is an affordably-priced miracle for my dry, sensitive skin!</li>
      <li>I generally stick to all-natural products with no fragrance (which is what drew me to this product), but this lotion definitely needed some fragrance added.</li>

    <li> I feel good that I&#x27;m not smearing questionable chemicals all over and it&#x27;s plenty nourishing for my dry skin, but not greasy at all.  I buy this unscented version, but will likely switch to the waterstone scent.  It is understated and wonderful!</li>
    <li> I am happy with this product.  Seems to moisturize well.</li>
    <li> Works great, doesn&#x27;t have any fake smells and is mild enough to use on my face (most lotions cause me breakout and redness, even expensive face lotions for sensitive skin). This was recommended to me by a friend that had the same sensitivities to lotions, and from now on I&#x27;m always recommending it.</li>
    <li> This is definitely not unscented; it smells like cheese. I generally stick to all-natural products with no fragrance (which is what drew me to this product), but this lotion definitely needed some fragrance added. Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I fell in love with this lotion the first time I used it. It has helped me hydrate with helpful, natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> This lotion is smooth, creamy and not at all heavy. I have been using it on my face as well as on my body and it doesn&#x27;t make my face feel greasy or oily. I use a pea size to moisturize my entire face. Another pea size for my neck.</li>
    <li> Gluten free lotion. I gave this as a gift and she really likes it. I haven&#x27;t used it though but assume its good</li>
    <li> This lotion is great. Has cocoa butter in it. Gives nice tingly feeling when you apply. Very relaxing. Not greasy at all! I&#x27;m using it for weight loss so that my skin stays firm.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife to replace the generic over the counter lotion she used to buy at target.  She has a sensitivity to some fragrances, and we also wanted to avoid any questionable chemicals while she was pregnant.  She&#x27;s pretty picky when it comes to her skin care products, but she loves this lotion.  If you subscribe and save, the price on Amazon is cheaper than what Whole Foods sells it for.</li>
    <li> As good as any unscented lotion!</li>
    <li> Great for people who are avoiding gluten in their diet and H&amp;B aid products. Goes on easy and light and lasts all day. Free of other nasty stuff too. :)</li>

    <li> This is by far the best body moisturizer I have used - non-oily and lasts all day.  No additives or toxins so no itching.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion so much. Non greasy and safe ingredients!</li>
    <li> This is wonderful stuff. It&#x27;s my go-to for serious skin care, and its effective for 24 hours without irritating. Yay! I buy the unscented version. I will be trying other products from this company, but they are hard to find in my neighborhood.</li>
    <li> One of the best unscented products on the market.</li>
    <li> When I use this lotion, it actually absorbs into my skin - as opposed to the petroleum based crap I was buying.</li>
    <li> this is not for me. it seems to take a long time to soak in. I also don&#x27;t like the lack of a fragrant scent</li>
