    <li> I use this on my brushes every day after applying makeup. It does a reasonable job in getting the brushes clean and disinfected. It&#x27;s not 100% clean - I can still see foundation tinting on my stippling brush, for example - but it does get most of the gunk off. I still wash my brushes once a week in antibacterial hand soap and a lot comes out, but I suppose for in between cleaning it helps keep bacterial transfer down.</li>

    <li> Smells good, good solid spray. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> It smells nice and it&#x27;s good for getting most of the makeup off your brushes. It doesn&#x27;t get everything off, but it does a pretty good job. I would recommend using this on a daily basis, but washing your brushes with brush shampoo once a week as well.</li>

    <li> Satisfied with merchandise</li>
    <li> This works great. I use shampoo and conditioner on the brush every couple of weeks and for daily cleansing this is good.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009W8UIVW/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_2</li>
    <li> Does a good job cleaning my brushes daily.  Gets my brushes really clean and it is very inexpensive.  I just wish it came in a bigger bottle so I wouldn&#x27;t have to reorder it all of the time.</li>
    <li> I like this cleaner.  It is easy to use and cleans and sanitizes my brushes very well.  The mild scent is pleasing.  This brush cleaner leaves my brushes fresh and soft.  It is not hard on the bristles at all.</li>
    <li> Bottle arrived broken, sprayer did not work, leaking. Had to transfer to another type bottle I had laying around. Not sure I will buy again. Liked the smell of the sanitzer.</li>
    <li> A few sprays and a good rub on a towel and my brushed seem clean after using them. All the make up on my white eye shadow brush comes right off</li>
