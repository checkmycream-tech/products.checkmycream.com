<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is the best perfume not to starong nice and lite and it smells like cotton candy and last all day and a very good price i would recommend this to everyone</li>
    <li> I USE THIS PERFUME WAY TOO MUCH. I CAN&#x27;T TELL YOU HOW MANY COMPLIMENTS I HAVE GOTTEN ON IT....IT IS ALSO SOLD FOR SUCH A GOOD PRICE IN TERMS OF HOW AMAZING IT IS. I EVEN BOUGHT AN EXTRA FOR MY BEST FRIEND BECAUSE SHE WAS STEALING MINE...I LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> I love this perfume and bought it at the mall for the first time. When I saw it here I just HAD to buy it. It came in what it seemed to be an original packaging, BUT it leaks every time I spray it. It smells good, but I believe it is not the original perfume, because it has an &amp;#34;after-smell&amp;#34;, which smells cheap. I was very disappointed and I cannot wear this!! For the price I guess I couldn&#x27;t really expect originality. I would not recommend this to anyone, and I will have to buy it at the mall next time.</li>
    <li> Love the smell. Just wished it was a little stronger. Seems a little weak to me. Great price though!! Overall good.</li>
    <li> I love it, smells amazing like stawberry grapefruit candy! I am very picky about perfumes and get sick of scents quickly but this one makes me want to smell my wrist all day long.</li>
    <li> Good Seller, nice product for this price.I would buy it again.fast shipping, fare price  of delivery cost.&lt;br /&gt;Easy purchasin.its realy not much to write about 10 dollars bottle</li>
    <li> Smells so good !! Definitely surprised at how nice it smelled considering the price. A girl at work paid 90 at the mall for the same perfume</li>
    <li> It was not really what I thought but ok.</li>
    <li> Receive item on time but the quality of the perfume is very low. The scent is not what I know.. compare to the previous one I had, this is like alcohol in a bottle. Disappointed :-[</li>
    <li> My husband first bought this perfume for me from the mall for my bday, LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!  Had to buy more when it ran out, decided to look for it on Amazon and so glad I did, it&#x27;s WAY cheaper!!!  I always get compliments when i wear this perfume. Its a must have!</li>
    <li> Smells amazing!!! All day wear</li>
    <li> I luv this scent. I have worn Pink Sugar a sweet feminine fragrance since it&#x27;s introduction into the market. I was satisfied until i smelled Pure Pink... OMG, i fell in luv with this scent.  It&#x27;s a beautiful fragrance.  I&#x27;m getting tons of compliments.  My only con is: i wish i&#x27;d bought this from Amazon, I was robbed.  i paid 45.00 @ the mall. Amazon is always the place to buy everything.</li>
    <li> Nice, light fragrance.  Great to wear day or night.</li>
    <li> Got Here Quick ;) Love Ir</li>
    <li> I love this perfume.  Smells nice and can&#x27;t beat the price.  Excellent everyday scent that I&#x27;ve received compliments on without being overbearing.</li>
    <li> I got exactly what I wanted at a incredible price!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this perfume. This is my 3rd bottle.  Every time I wear it, I get so many complements.</li>
    <li> My new favorite perfume..is light and fresh smelling I wear it daily no matter my mood</li>
    <li> my new wife made me buy it, cause she knows how much I love it! This smells amazing - sweet and not too strong - and what a great price!</li>
    <li> i l,ove this perfume its sweet but not cloying i cant really describe it...it reminds me of a color..it smells like the color purple. I have miss dior cherie, vancleefs feerie, amor amor, trishmcevoy 9, givency harvest collector perfumes,victoria secret heavenly forevr and all of thier good ones.....this one still beats them all out. guys stop me and want to know the name of the perfume, its soooo amazing. i kinda dont want to write this review im afraid one day itll be bought up</li>
    <li> will diffenitely buy more in the future. this is a light good smell. its my first time to used it and I like the smell..</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a sweet, fruity scent that is everything I expect in a perfume. It lasts until the next day! The packaging was beautiful as well.</li>
    <li> Karen Low Fragrance is wonderful for the spring and summer very soft and airy. #1 on my summer list....😍</li>
    <li> Wife loves it. It smells like candy but not overly sweet. Just beautiful.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance!!  I received this perfume as a birthday gift and liked it so much that I purchased it on my own!!  Very nice and feminine smelling.</li>
    <li> This perfume made my wife smell so good, that all the man were following  her around the store. I told them about your site. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I found this product on amazon for a much lower price than I could in the malls or stores. It is my husbands favorite parfume on me and my other one was almost empty! We needed a replacement but didn&#x27;t have money for the ones at the store. This was the right price for us. It is exactly the same as the other one I had and it arrived promptly and well packaged.</li>
    <li> My daughter looks this perfume and the price was great!!! I would highly recommend it and will be purchasing another soon.</li>
    <li> RUBBING ALCOHOL IN CUTE PACKAGE</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it! And it was so much cheaper than what they were trying to sell me at the mall!</li>
    <li> Came on the first day that it was said to.come in on.&lt;br /&gt;As for the product. Perfect!</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful, scent lasts...and is a sweet scent. Great value for a perfume. Very feminine, my daughter thinks it smells like Cotton Candy.</li>
    <li> Loved it ! Got shipped right away and the smell was the same as in you get it at the mall :) will have to buy another one I love the smell</li>
    <li> I get this perfume at least twice a year for my daughter she loves the smell. I was happy with the product and came before it said it would be here.</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume as a present for my best friend and also bought myself some.  If you like a &amp;#34;fruitier&amp;#34; scent then you will most likely like this perfume.  Isn&#x27;t strong and overtaking even if sprayed on heavily.  I will continue to buy because I get compliments on it all of the time.</li>
    <li> I like it, however it didn&#x27;t match my body chemistry. Gave it to my friend&#x27;s daughter. She likes the smell.</li>
    <li> Love this perfume soooo much I bough 3 at the same time!! it is the same perfume I bough at the &amp;#34;perfume outlet&amp;#34; for more than 3 times what I paid here. Incredible!!</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loves this perfume</li>
    <li> Nice I like it .It REALLY have that fruit smell. I recomended.</li>
    <li> Smells so good that my teenage daughter keeps borrowing it.</li>
    <li> I love this one! I like it a lot better than the Pure Couture (baby pink bottle). The smells is sweeter and less chemical smelling than the Pure Couture. It seems like I use less as well of this bottle. I will definitely be purchasing this again! Nice and cheap and I love how the bottle makes my bathroom look. :)</li>
    <li> I love this perfume!! It smells so sweet and at a great price too! Arrived quickly, great packaging, I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this smell of this! I saw it in the mall but it cost way too much, like $30 for the bottle I think it was. I got this and another bottle for the same price! Love them both.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance. It is very feminine and I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on it. Soft enough to wear as an everyday fragrance.</li>
    <li> This is a very sweet and long lasting parfum. Bought it as a Christmas gift and she, who received it, has fallen in love of the scent. I will definitely get a new one when this one finishes...</li>
    <li> Smell doesn&#x27;t stay that long.</li>
    <li> BEST FRAGANCE EVER. I BUY THIS OVER AND OVER AND OVER, ITS SMELLS LIKE SUGAR AND LAST FOR A GOOD TIME</li>
    <li> Smells amazing def a must buy</li>
    <li> I am not a fan of this perfume.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is ordinary nothing special.&lt;br /&gt;I sent it gift.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that i love is the design.</li>
    <li> The fragrance is unique and last all day. I get compliments regularly and my teenage daughter steals a spray or two more often that  I probably catch her. This was my second purchase of PINK by Karen Lowe. I bought this bottle again because my husband kept saying my new perfume was not as appealing to him as the PINK.  The price is pretty incredible too.  I actually hope this fragrance remains a secret! I hate to wear the same fragrance as everyone else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy this product agian!</li>
    <li> I love this perfume!  To me it smells like sweet grapefruit, but not in a \\&quot;too citrus\\&quot; kind of way.  Just a lovely, unique, sweet smell.  Not too young for me (I&#x27;m in my 30s).  A new favorite!  My boyfriend loves it on me too :)</li>
    <li> My order arrived only a few days after ordering it. And I absolutely love the smell of this perfume. I have girls from work wanting to know where I got it.....:)</li>
    <li> we bought that parfum for my little sis (13 years old), great smell for little ladies. :) unfortunately we bought it at our local mall and paid more than 50 dollar for it. could kick my butt (I mean husband) for spending that much on it.</li>
    <li> Took a risk and bought it for my wife who is a bit picky with perfumes and it turns out I knocked it out of the park! She absolutely loved it! She was very surprised by how good it smells and she&#x27;s been getting compliments on it. Very fresh and sweet smelling but not overwhelming at all.</li>
    <li> I found this at a perfume outlet in Vegas when looking for Escada Tropical Punch and loved it. spent $30 buying it and wanted one for myself after getting home. thankfully, Amazon carries it for HALF the price. it is my go to fragrance. I receive many compliments and inquiries about it. it&#x27;s a fruity floral smell that I absolutely love! for $15, you have nothing to lose.</li>
    <li> This perfume is 1 of the best i ever brought!I purchased this item last year around this time and i still have a little bit left and looking forward to buying another one from amazon.I originally seen this item at the mall &amp; loved the smell but it was around $30 so i looked on amazon &amp; found it have that price.I received plenty of compliments on the perfume its not strong, it has kind of a fruity smell, &amp; perfect for the spring/summer time!...you&#x27;ll love it like I do!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS... This is the 1st time I&#x27;m ever close to being done a perfume bottle this size and i will use every drop of it!!</li>
    <li> Handled in perfect, short time. Just what I&#x27;ve asked for. Great service</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance,  the package was well wrapped and came on time. I haven&#x27;t tried any other fragrances from Karen Low I, myself like to be able to sample the fragrances before purchasing because everything doesn&#x27;t smell right on everybody.</li>
    <li> I love the scent. It stays on for the entire day.</li>
    <li> I love the of this perfume actually I would order more...</li>
    <li> This perfume never gets old! I had been using this perfume for years, then i moved away from home and one day dropped the bottle and it broke and couldn&#x27;t find it in any stores near me so i was worried it was discontinued, but then i remembered Amazon always has those hard to find things and sure enough it was on here for much cheaper and got here very quickly! Im so happy because I missed this perfume for the longest time! Its more of a fruity sweet scent than a floral smell, just amazing.</li>
    <li> Great scent, great value</li>
    <li> i just i recevied my bottle of this perfume and it smells  wonderful it has a fresh garden sent that&#x27;s fulled with beautiful flowers along with a sweet and sexy! smell  all in one and it last awhile to i wasn&#x27;t gonna order it at first because i Naver heard of it before i didn&#x27;t wanna waste my money on something that i wasn&#x27;t sure if it smell good are not like i did in the pass with another perfume because just like this perfume it had alot of good comments on it but just wasn&#x27;t my taste so i gave it to my mom but i thought what the heck i&#x27;m gonna give karen low a try and it was worth it:) and good price to!!</li>
    <li> My girl was trying to buy this inside the store... until I showed her it on amazon.com&lt;br /&gt;Karen Low Pure Pink Eau De Parfum Spray for Women, 3.4 Ounce</li>
    <li> this is my second time buying this. i love the scent and it is the first perfume that hasn&#x27;t made me break out in a rash, as i am extremely sensitive to scents, fragrances, and dyes. it has a cute/classy scent, very girlie</li>
    <li> Great smell and last for a fair amount of time.</li>
    <li> very good my sister very happy</li>
    <li> Fresh daily wearable smell. Only downfall is it doesn&#x27;t last all day.</li>
    <li> most amazing fragrance everrrr</li>
    <li> I bought this product and compared it with one bought from the shopping Mall. The package look legit but the scent is a water down version. So don&#x27;t waste your money and go to a department store or nearby shopping mall.</li>
    <li> This perfume is so wonderful and I have got so many compliments from a lot of different people. I&#x27;m very satisfied with it!</li>
    <li> i love this sweet, not too strong pretty scent, good buy.</li>
    <li> I ordered this perfume because I have had it before but I pair $50.00 for the exact same amount and type of product. This was MUCH more reasonable and just as good as my other bottle. Shipping took about a week and was not in any way damaged. Great product.</li>
    <li> nice fragrance. initially smells flowery but smell improves after a few seconds. have worn it for 7 hours and the smell still lingers even after washing my hands several times.</li>
    <li> out of all the karen lows i own this is the&lt;br /&gt;best one its sweet not sickly sweet&lt;br /&gt;its strong last all day the best part&lt;br /&gt;its so pretty y just spray some on to&lt;br /&gt;smell y its that pretty im getting more&lt;br /&gt;befor the price goes up&lt;br /&gt;trust me this is her best to me out&lt;br /&gt;of all 4 i have tryed a 10 for sure&lt;br /&gt;great shipping too</li>
    <li> I love the scent, but it doesn&#x27;t last long at all....</li>
    <li> One of my favourite perfumes. It has a subtle floral scent and is extremely inexpensive.</li>
    <li> Love this scent and the price!</li>
    <li> My boyfriend bought this for me last valentines day at the mall and paid $70 for the same bottle! It is the best perfume ever and the smell last all day without it being overwhelming I always order 3 at the time</li>
    <li> I ordered this perfume based in the good reviews on Amazon. I was looking for some fresh, sweet fragance and good thing I wasnt wrong when ordering Pure Pink. It smells so delicious, the bottle is cute and last long in my skin. I am gladly surprised by the perfume as well for its price. Not all cheap things are a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I received what I order on the time frame I was supposed to.  Pretty satisfied! I love this perfume and can&#x27;t find it somewhere else. Ty!!</li>
    <li> At first you think it&#x27;s too sweet but then it settles down and you walk around smelling yourself all day. The price unreal under $16 for such a large bottle. Deals!</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance, doesn&#x27;t last as long as I hoped for tho</li>
    <li> I LOVE this perfume, but I made the mistake and bought it at a perfume place in the mall. It was $114.... Now seeing it online less than a year later really pisses me off. For as much as I paid, it wasn&#x27;t worth it. But for $14 isn&#x27;t a bad price for it.</li>
    <li> Love the scent and price. Not overpowering and it doesn&#x27;t give my husband a headache like most other perfumes. Will keep buying as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
    <li> Love the smell of it. and it is not expensive. I like it. It took to long to receive it though.</li>
