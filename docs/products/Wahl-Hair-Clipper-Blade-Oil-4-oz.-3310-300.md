<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Useful size and easy applicator tip</li>
    <li> Very good product totally recommend it. It makes the blades sound smooth and it works great.</li>
    <li> excellent blade oil.  like another reviewer, unfortunately mine didn&#x27;t come with a cap.  easily remedied by balling up a small piece of adhesive or silly putty and making your own cap -- problem solved.</li>
    <li> Works as expected. Shipped on time.</li>
    <li> seems like good oil for my clippers.</li>
    <li> As advertised, no complaints.  The little red cap even holds nice and tight to prevent spills.</li>
    <li> When using clipper oil I only apply every 2 haircuts.  Also, if you are cutting hair and you get a bit of a pull, place a few drops on the blades and let it run for a second before cutting hair again.</li>
    <li> Excellent lubricant for electric razor.</li>
    <li> good product to keep clippers oiled up and rust resistant.</li>
    <li> This oil works like it should and it last a long time.  We use it on other appliances too and the bottle is huge.</li>
    <li> Works great keeps my clipper blades sharp</li>
    <li> ON TIME DELV, GOOD PRODUCT</li>
    <li> A little bit expensive than I expected. But pretty useful.</li>
    <li> for my 4 year old trimmer.. great price.. great product..</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what can be said about clipper oil except that it is oil for clippers and seems to be oily!  LOL  Nice application with extended nozzle.</li>
    <li> The price per amount in the bottle was the first thing I noticed.  The bottle is easy to use and get just the number of drops you want. I have to say I never used Clipper oil before now.  Wish I had gotten this years ago, amazing how much better the small clippers work with one or two drops.  The bottle will out last me at this rate.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Works well on my clipper keeping blades lubricated and clean.</li>
    <li> This has worked perfectly for me. But this is actually a very large bottle for home-use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If ti were a barber shop I&#x27;m sure they could go through this quickly, but compared to the tiny bottles that come with a new pair of electric clippers.. I&#x27;m pretty sure this is going to last me the rest of my natural life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely no issues with lubrication though, and it seems thinner than the oil that comes with a new pair of clippers--- meaning less residue.</li>
    <li> Keeps my clippers well oiled.</li>
    <li> Good price for size and what I needed.</li>
    <li> With so many clippers, shavers, cutters, scissors etc. its good to have an appropriate oil to keep all these blades and cutters oiled and sharpened. Easily dispensed.</li>
    <li> large bottle good for lifetime. using on dog clippers</li>
    <li> Originally i bought this oil for my Wahl&#x27;s clipper; but now, i&#x27;m using it to lubricate my Victorinox multitools :-)&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really light and isn&#x27;t smelly as other oils.</li>
    <li> great oil, but my bottle was missing the red cap. thats the only reason I gave it a 4 star rating.</li>
    <li> Good applicator and storage. Easy to apply and does not leak.&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea whatsoever how to rate the oil. It seems just like what came with the Wahl hair trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;I removed one star not because there is anything wrong with the oil. I have not way to evaluate it,&lt;br /&gt;so raving about it seems inappropriate and deducting too much would be unfair. I would certainly recommend it and would buy it again. The amount provided for the money is generous, so I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be ordering it soon. I use it on both my hair cutting device and my beard trimmer.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wahl peanut and my wahl clippers this makes your blades last a long time and keeps the blade sharp</li>
    <li> Great oil, but it will last three or 4 life times. Wish they had a smaller size.</li>
    <li> flat out works! I have only used 1 drop  and the blades have been great for 6 months.</li>
    <li> The product was shipped fast....and it works great!  It will take us a very only time to use this up...you get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
    <li> I bought this oil because I needed something to lubricate the blades of my bread and mustache trimmer it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> I use to oil on my hairclipper So that i can cut my hair every month and it a great and i still have left for 450 hair cut to go.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my Andis clipper.  Having read other reviews, I did not remove the inner foil seal completely, instead I punched a small hole in it with a pen and I also put some teflon tape on the threads of the cap to ensure against leakage and it works beautifully on my clipper, the clipper actually seems to run smoother than with the original oil that was included in its packaging.</li>
    <li> This bottle will last a long time.  Works every bit as well as the small bottle that came with my clippers.  Can&#x27;t really say much more beyond that.</li>
    <li> I am not having any problems with using this product. It works just fine and I will buy more when needed.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s clipper oil. Nothing special. It worked fine</li>
    <li> This oil works better than 3 in 1 oil.  It makes the clippers sound smoother. I will use this on other clipper sets.</li>
    <li> Simple, inexpensive, gets the job done. Blades are lubricated and trimmer is running smoother than ever.</li>
    <li> a very Bad Product Will not Buy again</li>
    <li> A lot for a little price. Good deal.</li>
    <li> great product and the stuff last forever!</li>
    <li> My son uses the oil to keep his clippers well-oiled and says it works fine!</li>
    <li> This oil keep&#x27;s my hair clipper blade&#x27;s nice and sharp I would totally recommend it !!</li>
    <li> Works great for any machine</li>
    <li> Makes my clippers work so much better.</li>
    <li> It works--applies cleanly.</li>
    <li> This is a must have if you own any pair of clippers to keep them working and cutting in a smooth cut manner, and with this particular delivery spout it get the oil right where you need it to go.</li>
    <li> The oil is great for the price - - couldn&#x27;t find the similar Braun oil bottle around here, or had to pay more in shipping than the bottle cost.  However, the Wahl oil arrived with no orange screw on cap.  Now what do I do to keep it from leaking out if tipped over?!! Shipping quality control needs improvement - - very frustrating!!</li>
    <li> The small bottle of baby oil I was using for years to lube my clippers was years old and it was getting dirty.  So I was amazed to find this 4 oz. Wahl bottle in a retail store a couple of years ago to replace the old baby-oil bottle.  So far, I&#x27;ve used about 10% of the Wahl oil.  The bottle \\&quot;should\\&quot; last a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a couple of years being happy with the official Wahl oil bottle, it started making trouble a few month ago.  I&#x27;m suddenly unable to tip the bottle to apply oil without it leaking around the edge of the cap and down the side of the bottle.  The cap looks as if it screws onto the bottle, but they&#x27;ve apparently been glued together, so the cap can&#x27;t be tightened.  Not being able to tighten the cap wouldn&#x27;t be such an issue if it hadn&#x27;t started leaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Applying oil to the clippers is a somewhat delicate process.  My intention was to avoid chewing up the delicate plastic tip, which would happen by pushing it against the sharp metal parts, so I have never pushed on the tip or otherwise abused it.  Regardless, the cap assembly is failing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I&#x27;m going to have to learn that whenever I&#x27;m going to use the oil, I&#x27;ll have to prepare with a big wad of toilet paper to catch the oil that will escape from the around the edge of the cap.  The leak is dribbling oil as fast as the oil coming out of the tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My recommendation for future purchases is to get a smaller size applicator, whose oil might last only 5 years instead of 20.  At least if the smaller applicator fails when it gets old, not as much oil will be wasted.</li>
    <li> Bought this to go with my new clippers and I like the size for one thing, much better than the tiny tincture of oil that comes with the clippers and i like that the red cap actually screws on and the base of the nozzle has cotton or something in it to keep the oil from running out the sides. Will buy more of this when its time to refill, hopefully it doesn&#x27;t go off the market.</li>
    <li> It keeps the blades on the clipper nice and cool.</li>
    <li> You know those horrible little bottles of oil that come with your trimmer? The ones that don&#x27;t have a cap? The ones that spill oil all over your trimmer case or vanity drawer? Exactly.</li>
    <li> Appears solid, as expected, good transaction, thank you</li>
    <li> Keep your Wahl Clippers well oiled. Must have. Great deal and enough to last for a year or two. RAWR!</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s see......  review the clipper oil......&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s slippery and when you put it on the blades of your clipper they work smoothly....</li>
    <li> Maintains my clippers in good shape. Those who cut there own need this item.</li>
    <li> great price for what basically will be something due too its size will last for years in a personal use scenario if it is for work it is still enough to last a long time and is from a quality company,if you are looking for this and want something that will last this fits the bill</li>
    <li> Good deal, but haven&#x27;t installed yet</li>
    <li> I have never purchased oil for my clippers that I have had over 3 years. I was expecting a small bottle for the price. I was pleasantly surprised when this came in the mail and it was a BIG bottle. I&#x27;ll probably never have to buy clipper oil again. I was shaving my head tonight and the clippers were grabbing at my hair. (talk about great timing) I used just 2-4 drops around the edges and viola! they were cutting like a knife through butter.</li>
    <li> It is what it is.  Keeps your clippers moving along nicely.  The needle point tip lets you put the oil just where you want it. And the bottle is big enough to last you just about forever (unless your a professional groomer).  I&#x27;ve been using it on my dogs clippers for a couple of years now.</li>
    <li> I have used this product in the past for all of my electronic razors and some other uses around the house. The oil is very thin and light and does not cause build-up of residue. It works on a variety of items such as RC modeling, computer fans and other electronic motors and moving parts. I love this oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did have one issue which was not the fault of Wahl but rather Amazon. When receiving the oil, it was not packaged but just tossed into the shipping box with other packaged items. The oil was not sealed and the top dispensing cap had been cut off and the red cap was missing. It might have been a return or maybe Amazon was using it for their shipping department and mistakenly placed their bottle in my shipment. This did not affect my opinion of Wahl or Amazon as they were willing to replace it at no charge. However I did call Wahl who was very happy to replace the red cap which they did but them found out later that the dispensing cap was cut and the red cap would not screw on properly. They are now sending me a new bottle free of charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with the product and the support from both Wahl and Amazon.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a lifetime supply of clipper oil.  Unfortunately, mine did not come with the orange cap on top.  Needless to say, once I opened the bottle, I have no way of sealing the bottle.  I must now make sure it stays upright and hope it doesn&#x27;t leak.  Good quality item, but I wish it had the tip.</li>
    <li> Great item. Good price.  Would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> A nice big bottle of oil with the right kind of spout makes this product a no brainer.</li>
    <li> Prompt service. Quality product and a great value for what you get. I would definitely recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> I have an older Wahl beard trimmer so buying this was an easy decision. It effectively keeps the clipper lubricated.</li>
    <li> This is the good stuff. Great price and works great on our clippers.</li>
    <li> Works well. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll be decades before I need to ever order more of it.</li>
    <li> My Wahl clippers love it! Runs better.</li>
    <li> It works so far. Keeps my clippers running well.</li>
    <li> Great value. This will keep my conair clippers lasting a very long time</li>
    <li> i love it so much will buy more as soon as its done</li>
    <li> Greta for preseving your clipper and keeping the blades sharp.</li>
    <li> the electric hair clippers keep going and going with the help of this oil.  As long as you use the oil as WAHL recommends, you are good to go for years to come.  If you purchase new hair clippers, buy this at the same time.  A little bit of maintenance time goes a long way to keeping a product good.</li>
    <li> This blade oil works well, and is a good size for people with clippers and razors without running a business.</li>
    <li> Bought this item to give my son short cuts. Also bought blade oil and when applied each cut, works fine. I&#x27;m satisfied with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product with the Wahl personal grooming beard and mustache trimmer. The produce works exactly as advertised. What more can you ask?</li>
    <li> Good deal.  The little tube of oil that came with my Wahl Clippers finally ran out, but it should be quite a while before I run out of oil again with this good-sized container.</li>
    <li> great! i am very pleased with this!</li>
    <li> Buy this clipper oil because it comes in a really good bottle!</li>
    <li> Amazon shipped it without the red nozzle cap.  So I just keep it on the shelf upright. The oil does not evaporate.  Other than that, the product is good in lubrication clippers and electric razors.</li>
    <li> inexpensive, came on time and did its job</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Nice to have large container of  good blade oil to last a long time instead of that very tiny tube of blade oil that comes with hair and beard clippers. This large amount will last a long time and will keep my clipper blades sharp and smooth for sure!.</li>
    <li> Works better than any oil so far. I actually buzz my 4 months hair in one application. All my other oils would require me to use several applications. Very good.</li>
    <li> Great product l. Great price. This will last me for years.</li>
    <li> It works as advertised in the product description association with the listing.  I don&#x27;t have anything bad to say about it.  It does a great job clearing my old clippers (which had jammed up after a few years of use and no oil) in one application.  Easy, quick, no complaints.</li>
    <li> Solved my clipper problem. It was getting stuck, and this smoothed things out.</li>
    <li> Unless you are a professional barber or hair stylist, this 4 oz. bottle of quality clipper oil will last you for the rest of your life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got fed up trying to find the little bitty tubes of oil included with the clippers, and purchased this.  It is a very fair price, and is designed for your clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is really nothing else to ask for.</li>
    <li> yep really oils up the hair clipper very well</li>
    <li> This oil gets the job done. Plus, it&#x27;s convenient applicator tip makes oiling your clipper a breeze. You only need a small amount for effect so it should last a while.</li>
    <li> This bottle should last for about 50 years since I only cut my hair about one a month. Along with some new blades, my 10 year old clippers are as good as new.</li>
    <li> This oil is a good lubricant for Wahl clippers. No need to make a big deal out it. Oil is oil and this particular oil works.</li>
    <li> Oil is oil is oil. I&#x27;m a sucker for add on&#x27;s so I purchased this oil for some new hair clippers which I also purchased. No complaints.</li>
    <li> It is difficult to really review clipper oil...it is fine, it was convienient to just add it to another order and it was at a competitive price.</li>
    <li> Great oil for my clippers.</li>
    <li> Works great, great price for the amount you get. It has a screw on call so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it leaking out.it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> It works great for the clippers, as well as general household needs,</li>
    <li> Works great with my electric clippers.</li>
    <li> oil is oil, right. right but when the cap leaks all over, i&#x27;m not a happy customer.</li>
    <li> I applied this to my manual shaver and it is already smoother to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also used it on nose trimmer.</li>
    <li> Nice narrow applicator controls amount of oil dispensed</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s clipper oil. It oils clippers. Mission accomplished.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my Wahl clippers. Based on my usage over the last few times, this should last me several years.</li>
    <li> I think this is good oil for my Wahl Clippers I have model # NAC  or the home pro kit.  I used all the oil that the clippers came with and started using my clippers without oil at all for about a month and a half and put them away under my sink.  Without the oil my clippers started to rust and have problems and almost refused to run because it was so rusty.  I took it apart cleaned off the excess hair that has fell between the cracks and applied this oil everywhere on the blade.  I let it sit for a while and ran it.  The rust started to disappear as I continued to use the clippers and brought it back to life now it runs as well as it did when i first bought them a year and a half ago.</li>
    <li> I was worried about the price, but I must not have been paying attention to the quantity because it is a lot. The oil works grate on my clipper blades.</li>
    <li> Works like I thought it would. I don&#x27;t like having hair sticking to the clippers even when wiped off but oil is necessary.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this purchase... lower price and higher quality than the original parts  we receive from Waltz with the razor</li>
    <li> Arrived without the red cap. I&#x27;m sure the oil will work but what&#x27;s the use if it will just spill and ruin the area where it will spill.</li>
    <li> Its oil...what else can I say...</li>
    <li> does the job. delivered on time.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a Panasonic ER2403 to replace the oil that came with it, and it worked really good. Since it is 4oz, I placed it some oil in another (much smaller) recipient. Very good so far ;)</li>
    <li> great little bottle, am sure this will last for few years.</li>
    <li> Keeping my clippers rust free</li>
    <li> This oil works great, and it&#x27;s a lifetime supply unless you run a barber shop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this is a clear, lightweight mineral oil, suitable for any application where you need a light lubricant, so it&#x27;s also useful around the house.</li>
    <li> Very good oil.  Just be careful peeling the protective cover as it can scratch your fingers.  Better just punch through it with a sharp object.</li>
    <li> Works on any shaver or grooming device.</li>
    <li> The oil is great but the bottle stinks on ice. It is always leaking even when stored upright. It wicks out around the screw on cap.</li>
    <li> Good price and quality. Nice and thin lubricant works well with my electric razors and hair trimmers. Nice quantity for the cost.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected and works great. Hopefully this will extend the life of my Wahl clipper. Saludos!</li>
    <li> good for my top notch moser haircutter.</li>
    <li> Used WD 40 for years on clippers, and they would start getting a build up of&lt;br /&gt;oil.  This oil is more refined, and works very well on the blades.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s oil for my clippers. Nothing to describe here.</li>
    <li> A must for your clipper</li>
    <li> Works well.  I am not a clipper oil expert.</li>
    <li> Perfect for keeping my trimmer in an always ready state, and I never have to have a snagged hair again!</li>
    <li> Gave my old clipper a new life.</li>
    <li> The applicator for this was cut off and the lid was missing so there is no way to seal it and the opening is too large to apply just a few drops.  Returning it would cost as much as just ordering another bottle.</li>
    <li> This product shipped fast and arrived as advertised. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> This item arrived with the stem broken</li>
    <li> Seems to be good quality oil. The reason I purchased this over other oils available was the sprout. This makes it easier for me to apply the oil and not get the nib running with oil and oil everywhere.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s clipper oil. What more can I say? Wahl makes a great product. This should last quite a while. Thanks.</li>
