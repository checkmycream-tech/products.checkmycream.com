<li> And it lasts for a long time.  </li>
<li> Only reason I didn&#x27;t put down 5 stars is because it was loose in the box with my other purchases.  </li>
<li> Everything I expected it to be.</li>
<li> product was was Cover Girl produces, but showed up partially crumbled.  </li>
<li> Have tried other blush but nothing compares to this.</li>
<li> The product was good but the shipping was horrible!!  </li>
<li> and it was all busted up and half of it fell out when I opened it.  </li>
<li> it is easier to apply from the little case than it is to get the Dallas out of the box evenly on to the blush brush.  </li>
<li> The blush was so cracked up that I was not able to use it.</li>
<li> Been using this color for years, couldn&#x27;t find it in our small town.  </li>
<li> Have been using this product for at least 20 years.  </li>
<li> Prob not a good idea to order this type of stuff that is shipped through the mail.</li>
<li> Had it not arrived broken I would have given it a five.</li>
<li> Powder was broken upon receipt</li>
<li> it was busted :(</li>

    <li> Whenever I got the blush it was busted :(*</li>
    <li> Been using this color for years, couldn&#x27;t find it in our small town.  I was so happy to find it.</li>
    <li> Powder was broken upon receipt</li>
    <li> Everything I expected it to be.</li>
    <li> Great for my 13 year old daughter.  I use it too.  Adds a little color and looks more natural.</li>
    <li> Cover Girl is the only face makeup my skin can use. It must have higher standards, because I don&#x27;t break out with it.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for at least 20 years.  Have tried other blush but nothing compares to this.</li>
    <li> This is a product I use every day. The price was great, delivery prompt and would buy again</li>
    <li> Excellent quality blush: it has a bright yet natural color, not too much shimmer, long wear and a great price tag.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend.</li>
    <li> This is a great color if you have fair skin. Love it!  And it lasts for a long time.  Very inexpensive as well.</li>
    <li> Had it not arrived broken I would have given it a five. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> A very nice shade. It lasts a long time,</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m just so stuck on this color.  I love it!</li>
    <li> Great product!!! I found this on Amazon and the price was the best ever!! I plan to order this product again!!! Good value!!</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful color for shading the hollow of the cheek.  It applies very nicely and blends well with its included brush.</li>
    <li> I have used this blush for years!!! Great deal- its the best color ever!</li>
    <li> The product was good but the shipping was horrible!!  It was put in a box with a 20 lb bag of cat food unprotected by anything and it was all busted up and half of it fell out when I opened it.  The blush was so cracked up that I was not able to use it.</li>
    <li> Love the color. Is the same color I use in the MAC brand for a huge savings!!!!! Love a savings!</li>
    <li> product was was Cover Girl produces, but showed up partially crumbled.  Prob not a good idea to order this type of stuff that is shipped through the mail.</li>
    <li> my old stand-by.. I just keep going back to it...</li>
    <li> Only reason I didn&#x27;t put down 5 stars is because it was loose in the box with my other purchases.  My blush was cracked in one corner, but not badly.</li>
    <li> It just took a while to get to me but everything is good with the product.</li>
    <li> I bought this after seeing it on pinterest as a copycat for Benefit Dallas.  It is pretty much spot on in that regard.  I still have about 1/4 of a box of the Dallas and I find that I use this Cover Girl blush a lot more often b/c it is easier to apply from the little case than it is to get the Dallas out of the box evenly on to the blush brush.  And this is soooo much cheaper.  I will definitely never buy the Dallas again, now that I have found this cheaper copy.  The blush goes on smooth, evenly, and wears well all day.</li>
    <li> way too light for me but that is not sellers fault</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m African American with a medium skintone with (think light butterscotch) and this compliments my color nicely. It&#x27;s not too sheer, but allows me to build up coverage as well.</li>
    <li> Ordered it...got it 3 days later. I&#x27;ve used this product and color for years cause it lasts all day and matches my skin better than others I&#x27;ve tried plus has a natural look</li>
