### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>as someone that is barefoot a lot and has a family history of cave man feet, this thing is great!</li>
      <li>This worked perfectly!</li>
      <li>i love this thing!</li>
      <li>Does an amazing job on heels.</li>
      <li>They will make nice Christmas gifts.</li>
      <li>I asked her how she liked it</li>
      <li>I love this version even more!</li>
      <li>Better than anything else I tried.</li>
      <li>Love this gadget.</li>
      <li>my brother had the original egg</li>
      <li>worked great  the first time, but after i took the top off to empty it,  the cover did not snap back on</li>
      <li>I love the long handle, it allows me to reach my feet after having knee surgery.</li>
      <li>My heels are much softer,</li>
      <li>It does the job very well.  </li>
      <li>Much easier to use with handle.</li>
      <li>When I take it apart to clean it and than put it back together</li>
      <li>the reason for the minus one star is because the blade it came with doesnt stay securely on the handle</li>
      <li>The fixed handle makes things easier than the regular PedEgg (which is a fantastic product)... until you get up close and personal, at which point I wish the handle were removable.</li>
      <li>it is very useful at taking the thick callouses off of my heels.</li>

    <li> When I take it apart to clean it and than put it back together it doesn&#x27;t snap on and stay on</li>
    <li> Much easier to use with handle.</li>
    <li> I love the long handle, it allows me to reach my feet after having knee surgery.</li>
    <li> Works as expected. I had one before.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for a family member. I asked her how she liked it and she said to give it four stars.</li>
    <li> Does an amazing job on heels.</li>
    <li> It does the job very well.  My heels are much softer,</li>
    <li> worked great  the first time, but after i took the top off to empty it,  the cover did not snap back on</li>
    <li> smooths out calices on my foot HOWEVER after the 1st use the halves wouldn&#x27;t stay together.</li>
    <li> i love this thing! it is very useful at taking the thick callouses off of my heels. as someone that is barefoot a lot and has a family history of cave man feet, this thing is great! my brother had the original egg and i went with the handle (less work!) and it is the only thing that has worked like a dream! the reason for the minus one star is because the blade it came with doesnt stay securely on the handle so i had to use a little masking tape. it didnt bother me enough to send it back, but it may for some people.</li>
    <li> It is the only thing I have found that works for me. I have Neuropathy and Rheumatoid arthritis in my feet, which makes it so much harder to get to my feet.&lt;br /&gt;when I found the PedEgg with the handle I was sceptical but it works.  I have had mine for about a year and I desperately need new blades.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I can&#x27;t say anything bad about this thing!!!  It works for me when nothing else would because it reaches for me when I can&#x27;t reach due to the Rheumatoid Arthritis.</li>
    <li> The last pedegg we had did not have a handle or the emery pads.  I love this version even more!</li>
    <li> The fixed handle makes things easier than the regular PedEgg (which is a fantastic product)... until you get up close and personal, at which point I wish the handle were removable.</li>
    <li> It does the job but it makes a mess!</li>
    <li> Love this gadget. They will make nice Christmas gifts.</li>
