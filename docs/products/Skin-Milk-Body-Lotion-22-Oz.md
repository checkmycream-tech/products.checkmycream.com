### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Excellent product and Amazon buying experience wonderful!  </li>
      <li>you guys will rule the World with your marketing style and GREAT customer service!  </li>
      <li>Both are excellent.</li>
      <li>Excellent product.</li>
      <li>Best cream I have ever used.</li>
      <li>One of the best body lotions out there!</li>
      <li>but the outcome is great.</li>
      <li>At this great price, how could I say no?</li>
      <li>The Skin Milk body cream is great too, I use it as a hand lotion.</li>
      <li>but my skin smells great and feels great.</li>
      <li>This lotions smells great, is not greasy, and does not break me out.</li>
      <li>I love the smell of this lotion!!</li>
      <li>While the title says it&#x27;s wonderful, I believe Skin Milk Body Lotion is by far, extremely wonderful.  </li>
      <li>Skin Milk also makes an amazing body wash or as they call \\&quot;shower gel\\&quot;, although their body cream I&#x27;ve found to be not so desirable - it smells just as great, but is oily, doesn&#x27;t absorb well and seems to just sit on the skin.</li>
      <li>from that good moisture, not oily, I&#x27;ll buy again</li>
      <li>I used to swear by this lotion 3 years ago, but now the quality is not as good as it used to be.</li>
      <li>good for men and women.</li>
      <li>Love love love this stuff!!!</li>
      <li>Love love love it!!!</li>
      <li>I love it and it smells great.</li>
      <li>My favorite lotion!  </li>
      <li>Love this lotion!</li>
      <li>It gets the job done and you smell fantastic and feel great afterward.</li>
      <li>Great for after bath or shower, light and doesnt leave you feeling greasy or sticky.</li>
      <li>The scent is nice, too, like milk candy, or vanilla.  </li>
      <li>This is a great product with a unique vanilla scent, but not so overpowering as to burn just from the fragrance, like some.</li>
      <li>This has been my favorite lotion for years, it smells amazing and feels amazing while you are rubbing it on</li>
      <li>Awesome! Healed up my tattoo so fast:)</li>
      <li>So far, this is a very good lotion.</li>
      <li>and i love the shower gel</li>
      <li>I just love this product.  </li>
      <li>I love the coconut aroma of this body lotion.</li>
      <li>I love the Skin Milk line.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s more..</li>
      <li>Love all the Skin Milk products.  </li>
      <li>Glad I found it in Amazon, the package was well pack.</li>
      <li>Love this brand</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>, I had no terrible reaction.  </li>
      <li>And during the winter, when I use it the most, my skin stays beautiful and soft.  </li>
      <li>I am allergic to most scents but can use thislotion with no problem and enjoy the smell</li>
      <li>I love the clean light scent of this product.  </li>
      <li>good stuff, discovered it on a trip to New Mexico 5 years ago.</li>
      <li>Nothing beats the light vanilla scent, and the easy application.</li>
      <li>My FAV lotion light and non sticky.</li>
      <li>It has a light scent and lasts all day.</li>
      <li>but it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin smooth like i thought it would.</li>
      <li>I like the scent and the fact that its mineral oil and petroleum free.</li>
      <li>but for all my ppl that try to use mineral oil and petroleum free products know that for $9.99 its a give and</li>
      <li>I have keratosis pilaris, and I find that my skin feels relatively smooth, considering there is no cure for the condition.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not too strong and not too mild.</li>
      <li>Very gentle, love the quantity.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s creamy, rich, smells amazing, and disappears, leaving your skin very soft.</li>
      <li>Amazon is fantastic with their ability to ship quickly and efficiently...</li>
      <li>Still, the body lotion is very good, well worth the low price and highly recommended!</li>
      <li>After a hot bath, putting this on makes me want to sleep because of the nice gentle smell.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good for even facial use.    </li>
      <li>so I love it so much I buy it</li>
      <li>, I hadn&#x27;t realized how quickly I fell asleep with the soothing scent that kept drifting into my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It absorbs quickly into the skin, and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  </li>
      <li>Infact, my skin was probably the softest it has been my whole life, and the light scent had stayed over night.  </li>
      <li>The only thing I liked about this lotion is the scent, which reminds me of a milkshake.  </li>
      <li>the wonderful scent of this product line that has me addicted to it.  </li>
      <li>Surprising feel and ingredients at such reasonable price</li>
      <li>Leaves your skin baby soft with a mild milky clean scent!</li>
      <li>The fragrance is just right.</li>
      <li>It soaks right in to the skin and stops itching from dryness right away.</li>
      <li>Skin absorbs it really fast, leaves it smooth and hydrated with a light sweet scent for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Im</li>
      <li>I love the products and it&#x27;s gentle and mild enought to use daily.  </li>
      <li>Since there are many five stars ratings, maybe I didn&#x27;t use it often enough</li>
      <li>It melts into the skin for what seems like a better moisturizing and rejuvenating, skin-smoothing effect than many more expensive lotions.</li>
      <li>Makes my skin smell funny</li>
      <li>has the same sensitive skin &amp; its safe for both of us!</li>
      <li>The price was also good just starting to use my 2nd bottle now.</li>
      <li>The lotion is not as thick and doesn&#x27;t take as much effort to rub it all in, so it may be more appealing.</li>
      <li>and it smells so clean and fresh especially after showering with the gel.</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t see any real differnce when compared to Suave lotions.  </li>
      <li>It really softens your skin as well.</li>
      <li>I am always looking for a reasonably priced, high quality moisturizer, and I found it.</li>
      <li>Maybe it&#x27;s the main ingredient of coconut oil that I haven&#x27;t found in others.</li>
      <li>All in all, I highly recommend.</li>
      <li>My skin is very sensitive, and I have no problems with this line.</li>
      <li>Love it but needs a little bit of oil or something to make it last longer and the scent stronger!</li>
      <li>So far, I&#x27;ve use 2 bottles of this lotion</li>
      <li>The container was dingy looking, so I think it may have been an old bottle of lotion.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve got sensitive skin &amp; my baby</li>
      <li>I have highly sensitive skin</li>
      <li>It has such a light scent, that it doesn&#x27;t interfere with any other perfumes I may wish to put on after my treating my skin to this lotion.  </li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product to others to use daily.</li>
      <li>From reading other reviews, it looks like this lotion was discontinued, and I think this inventory is pretty old.</li>
      <li>For a time I was able to buy the whole line of products at my local Dollar Tree, but even they&#x27;ve seemed to discontinue them, sadly.</li>

    <li> Excellent product and Amazon buying experience wonderful!  Amazon is fantastic with their ability to ship quickly and efficiently...you guys will rule the World with your marketing style and GREAT customer service!  I can&#x27;t be happier with the product and Amazon!    Steve Gilbert  Denver  303-521-0520</li>
    <li> Awesome! Healed up my tattoo so fast:)</li>
    <li> I have this product along with the cream (in the jar). Both are excellent. The lotion is not as thick and doesn&#x27;t take as much effort to rub it all in, so it may be more appealing. It has a light scent and lasts all day. At this great price, how could I say no? I am always looking for a reasonably priced, high quality moisturizer, and I found it.</li>
    <li> I like the scent and the fact that its mineral oil and petroleum free. A lot fragrance and alcohol in it but for all my ppl that try to use mineral oil and petroleum free products know that for $9.99 its a give and take.&lt;br /&gt;Aside from that good moisture, not oily, I&#x27;ll buy again</li>
    <li> So far, I&#x27;ve use 2 bottles of this lotion but I don&#x27;t see any real differnce when compared to Suave lotions.  The chances of me buying this again is next to never.</li>
    <li> I got this product today and i love the shower gel but i don&#x27;t like the lotion. The lotion rubs in well but it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin smooth like i thought it would. This is my frist time using it i may come back in a month to see how i like it then.</li>
    <li> I have used this hoping it would help moisturize my skin but it didn&#x27;t help. It was even itchy during the winter, I have to look for something else to stop it. I will never use this lotion ever.</li>
    <li> This is a great product with a unique vanilla scent, but not so overpowering as to burn just from the fragrance, like some. It melts into the skin for what seems like a better moisturizing and rejuvenating, skin-smoothing effect than many more expensive lotions. I was sad to see it disappear from brick-and-mortar stores, but hope it stays available online. Maybe it&#x27;s the main ingredient of coconut oil that I haven&#x27;t found in others. It&#x27;s good for even facial use.

Still, the body lotion is very good, well worth the low price and highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but after a few days of using this lotion, I developed a rash on my arms and legs.  Since it was nowhere else on my body, I knew it had to be from this lotion.  A few days after I discontinued use, the rash disappeared.  The container was dingy looking, so I think it may have been an old bottle of lotion.  I definitely do not recommend this lotion.  From reading other reviews, it looks like this lotion was discontinued, and I think this inventory is pretty old.</li>
    <li> This has been my favorite lotion for years, it smells amazing and feels amazing while you are rubbing it on and after you feel you skin when you are done. My Hubby never put on lotion in his life but I had to buy another bottle of this for him because he uses it daily now in his dry skin and feet.  Our toddler has eczema and when we rub this on her after her baths it clears up. I recommend it for everyone in your household!</li>
    <li> One bottle lasts forever. I have keratosis pilaris, and I find that my skin feels relatively smooth, considering there is no cure for the condition.</li>
    <li> It smells like expired milk, after I applied on I have to take another shower to get ride of that nasty smell. I don&#x27;t know is the lotion go bad or what, but it do smell really bad.</li>
    <li> This lotions smells great, is not greasy, and does not break me out. I give it 4 stars because it is not as hydrating as another lotion I use. If price is a big concern this lotion will do.</li>
    <li> I love the Skin Milk line. It gets the job done and you smell fantastic and feel great afterward.</li>
    <li> While the title says it&#x27;s wonderful, I believe Skin Milk Body Lotion is by far, extremely wonderful.  I have highly sensitive skin so when I bought this I had expected my skin to react badly to it.  So the night I applied it and tucked myself in, I hadn&#x27;t realized how quickly I fell asleep with the soothing scent that kept drifting into my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I awoke the next morning, I had no terrible reaction.  Infact, my skin was probably the softest it has been my whole life, and the light scent had stayed over night.  I couldn&#x27;t believe how well it worked and didn&#x27;t make my skin feel oily or greasy, like other products did.  And during the winter, when I use it the most, my skin stays beautiful and soft.  I love this product.  I now use it after I take a shower, or before I go to bed.  Nothing beats the light vanilla scent, and the easy application.</li>
    <li> I used to swear by this lotion 3 years ago, but now the quality is not as good as it used to be. Not moisturizing at all!</li>
    <li> Skin absorbs it really fast, leaves it smooth and hydrated with a light sweet scent for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Im not one for products with scents because of the harmful chemeicals involved but this is something so minor it really doesnt do anything bad to your skin but nourish and for a lasting time.</li>
    <li> Love love love this stuff!!!</li>
    <li> good stuff, discovered it on a trip to New Mexico 5 years ago. Hard to find in stores here in the south.</li>
    <li> I love the products and it&#x27;s gentle and mild enought to use daily.  I would highly recommend this product to others to use daily.</li>
    <li> So far, this is a very good lotion. It&#x27;s not as creamy or thick as other lotions but it&#x27;s more..milky. I love it and it smells great. I&#x27;ve had trouble finding a lotion that doesn&#x27;t leave my skin greasy and this is the one! It&#x27;s only been a few days so far but my skin smells great and feels great. After a hot bath, putting this on makes me want to sleep because of the nice gentle smell.</li>
    <li> I love the clean light scent of this product.  I am allergic to most scents but can use thislotion with no problem and enjoy the smell&lt;br /&gt;It goes on like liquid silk and keeps my skin moistureized.</li>
    <li> I would suppose that it&#x27;a the wonderful scent of this product line that has me addicted to it.  I can no longer find it in my area and I would and will do whatever it takes to find it.  Tripling the price would not even deter me.</li>
    <li> Leaves your skin baby soft with a mild milky clean scent! I&#x27;ve been using this stuff since I was a teenager. One of the best body lotions out there!</li>
    <li> Have used this product for 9 years now. It&#x27;s creamy, rich, smells amazing, and disappears, leaving your skin very soft. For a time I was able to buy the whole line of products at my local Dollar Tree, but even they&#x27;ve seemed to discontinue them, sadly. But I&#x27;ve discovered I can use this body lotion on my face, too. It&#x27;s just slightly thicker than the facial lotion. But I have dry skin, so YMMV. All in all, I highly recommend. The price is so low for the one bottle you should give it a try.</li>
    <li> Best cream I have ever used. NOT greasy and not really much of a smell...good for men and women. It soaks right in to the skin and stops itching from dryness right away. Love this brand</li>
    <li> I have used this for years. It is so healing and it smells so clean and fresh especially after showering with the gel.</li>
    <li> My FAV lotion light and non sticky. Glad I found it in Amazon, the package was well pack.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion! I can&#x27;t find it sold anywhere in my little city so I love it so much I buy it threw Amazon! Thank you! I&#x27;ve got sensitive skin &amp; my baby has the same sensitive skin &amp; its safe for both of us!</li>
    <li> I bought my bottle from my local grocery store. The only thing I liked about this lotion is the scent, which reminds me of a milkshake.  The moisturizing properties, to me, are little.  Once I apply the lotion and rub it in, and as the minutes elapse, I feel the need to reapply. I did this for a while until I realized I wasted my money.  I even contacted the company about my experience with their product, but no response.  Since there are many five stars ratings, maybe I didn&#x27;t use it often enough but I believe I did.  I would use it after bathing or throughout the day, and each time I feel the need to reapply.  I haven&#x27;t bought anymore of this product or any other because of my experience.  For those who want to buy this product, buy it from a place that allows you to return it because you may have the same experience as I did.</li>
    <li> I love the coconut aroma of this body lotion. It&#x27;s not too strong and not too mild. The fragrance is just right. It really softens your skin as well. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this lotion!! I use this product all the time. I would recommend the bath wash as well.</li>
    <li> My favorite lotion!  It absorbs quickly into the skin, and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  The scent is nice, too, like milk candy, or vanilla.  The Skin Milk body cream is great too, I use it as a hand lotion.</li>
    <li> Surprising feel and ingredients at such reasonable price</li>
    <li> Love love love it!!!😍😍😍</li>
    <li> Great for after bath or shower, light and doesnt leave you feeling greasy or sticky. The price was also good just starting to use my 2nd bottle now.</li>
    <li> I just love this product.  It has such a light scent, that it doesn&#x27;t interfere with any other perfumes I may wish to put on after my treating my skin to this lotion.  I definitely recommend giving it a try.</li>
    <li> Love it but needs a little bit of oil or something to make it last longer and the scent stronger!</li>
    <li> Love all the Skin Milk products.  Very gentle, love the quantity. My skin is very sensitive, and I have no problems with this line.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin smell funny but the outcome is great. My skin feels like a baby again!</li>
