      <li>Love this.</li>
      <li>I truly do not care for wacky body soaps with scents.  </li>
      <li>The scent is okay</li>
      <li>The fat here is coconut oil which is pretty much the best fat ever for everything from cooking to lotion or hair care.  </li>
      <li>Although you can easily make a soap like this, this is the best simple soap premade for you.</li>

      <li>My skin felt nourished and clean!  </li>
      <li>The scent was clean and not overpowering!  </li>

      <li>This is great soap...not perfumy or fake-smelling, washes off instantly, feels very clean.</li>

      <li>I was so excited to try it that I opened it as soon as I got home and washed my hands.  </li>
      <li>Some people even make their laundry soap with Kirks Original Castile Soap.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure</li>
      <li>The lather is rich and fragrant -- not perfumey.</li>
      <li>arrived on time and I am just excited.  </li>
      <li>Prefer the original scent over the coconut but still a clean rinsing product that doesn&#x27;t leave soapy residue.</li>
      <li>the smell after getting really clean.</li>
      <li>I am happy with the product, however, I thought this was a three-pack, not just a single bar of soap.</li>
      <li>It levees your skin feeling nice and soft and does not levee A waxy feeling on your skin!</li>
      <li>It makes me not want to use a washcloth so I can get the full effect.  </li>
      <li>It lasts a long time and has a pleasant smell.</li>
      <li>I was drawn to the clean, fresh smell.  </li>
      <li>I thought it would make a good face soap, as it claimed to be gentle and natural.  </li>
      <li>Good product overall and worth the cost.</li>
      <li>I purchased this soap because I like the smell of coconut, and my wife, who is very sensitive to smells, is ok with coconut soaps.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s simply been amazing.</li>
      <li>This matters to many of us who are chemically sensitive.</li>
      <li>I love this soap, I use it on my hair and it make my hair soft and adds some curl.</li>
      <li>I could not even open my eye on my own.  </li>
      <li>Lathers well, not to keen on scent but itsupposed to be natural anyway.:-)</li>
      <li>I also like its distinct lack of a residual scent.  </li>
      <li>It will make your closet smell fresh plus</li>
      <li>This is a plain but very good, clean rinsing old fashioned soap.</li>
      <li>It brought back pleasant memories of how I felt after a bath as a very young child.</li>
      <li>I went to bed right after.  </li>
      <li>Today a wad of sudsy foam hurtled into my right eye.  </li>
      <li>Worked well, lathered great, very little scent.  </li>
      <li>From the FAQ page on Kirk&#x27;s website: \\&quot;Kirk&#x27;s fragrance is a special blend of mostly natural and some synthetic materials.\\&quot; Please update the ingredients list and product description for the Amazon.com entry for Kirk&#x27;s Original Coco Castile Bar Soap.</li>
      <li>This quickly progressed to an intense burning as I hurriedly tried to rinse it off.</li>
      <li>It might be all natural, but the odor is strong.</li>
      <li>As a side-note, a friend purchased this soap to use on her dog that has severe skin allergies because she thought it would be mild and gentle to the dog&#x27;s skin.  </li>
      <li>This soap is such a great standard for the others to aspire to.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m willing to pay for a quality product.  </li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t available in any store near me</li>
      <li>Your Dish, launder, hand and hair soaps most likely have animal fat and bye-products in them.</li>
      <li>At first it&#x27;s pretty drying, but since I had so many current boils and break outs, I didn&#x27;t apply any lotion afterwards.</li>
      <li>First, I used it to wash my hands and had no adverse reactions, so I decided to use it in the shower...</li>
      <li>First-</li>
      <li>The lather bubbles are much smaller and there are about a bazillion more of them packed together.  </li>
      <li>Oh absolutely!  </li>
      <li>and you have to rinse it off pretty well.</li>
      <li>Heck, this acted even quicker than my essential oil recipe did (3 uses versus 8 or sometimes more uses).</li>
      <li>: first, it is a very &#x27;soft&#x27; soap, meaning it dissolves quickly.</li>
      <li>I like the clean smell of it and the natural look and feel of the bar.  </li>
      <li>Really like this soap, it&#x27;s very gentle.</li>
      <li>Most soap is milled and used too quickly to properly dry.  </li>
      <li>I lived in Tidewater Virginia for 2 years with super duper soft water about 10 years ago and all it took was 1 shower with it to know it wasn&#x27;t going to work.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Have not used this for years, and although it lathers well the soap does not last very long. Not sure that it is worth the price of $4.50 for less than a month in the shower for two people.</li>
    <li> Buyers beware of Kirk&#x27;s Castile Soap!  I bought Kirk&#x27;s Castile Soap on a whim while shopping at a local market.  I was drawn to the clean, fresh smell.  I thought it would make a good face soap, as it claimed to be gentle and natural.  WRONG!!!  My face turned as red as a beet and I immediately experienced very painful burning.  I will NEVER use this soap again.    As a side-note, a friend purchased this soap to use on her dog that has severe skin allergies because she thought it would be mild and gentle to the dog&#x27;s skin.  Her dog nearly went mad.  It caused terrible burning and redness and the poor dog suffered horribly for it.</li>
    <li> I love this soap, I use it on my hair and it make my hair soft and adds some curl.</li>
    <li> Lathers nice. I like it. My wife isn&#x27;t crazy about the fragrance though so I won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
    <li> I wanted a bar of this soap to try making laundry soap.  Before I could get around to doing that, I wound up using it in the shower.  The lather from this bar is different than the Oil of Olay soap I&#x27;ve been using for lord-only-knows how long.  The lather bubbles are much smaller and there are about a bazillion more of them packed together.  It makes the lather SO SOFT and it goes all over without having to use tons of the bar.  I was VERY pleased when I rinsed it off and my body felt all &amp;#34;squeaky clean&amp;#34; like the liquid castile soaps that I have used before.  It makes me not want to use a washcloth so I can get the full effect.  I don&#x27;t feel a residue but I want to wash with it more because I love the feel of this lather.  I like the clean smell of it and the natural look and feel of the bar.  I found it in 3 packs at my grocer and it is now in regular rotation with the liquid tea tree soaps.  I&#x27;m getting better at going more natural in my skin care products and this was a good choice for me.  Knowing how soap is made helps too, it&#x27;s basically lye mixed with fat and then cured.  The fat here is coconut oil which is pretty much the best fat ever for everything from cooking to lotion or hair care.  A reviewer said to unwrap and store the soap so it can cure more, that is correct.  Really good soap gets better when it cures longer.</li>
    <li> This soap is awesome. Very simple and leaves you clean. Doesnt have a strong scent. Since it might have a high percent of coconut oil, it might make you a little dry sometimes but on the other hand cleans well. I made a pure coconut oil soap with low superfats and this cleans similar to it but doesn&#x27;t dry my skin as bad.  Although you can easily make a soap like this, this is the best simple soap premade for you. They use a good formula.</li>
    <li> As a long time user of natural soap I simply refuse to pay the price for Dr. Bronners or Tom&#x27;s of Maine. These cost way too much. So the other options are Kirk&#x27;s Castille Soap or Cal-Ben Five Star Soap. Also several brands of clear glycerine soaps are available, but these don&#x27;t lather very well. I bought both Kirk&#x27;s and Cal-Ben and tried them out. Both are excellent and very similar. Cal-Ben is 3 oz compared to Kirk&#x27;s 4 oz but it seems harder and more compressed, thus longer lasting. They both lather up about the same amount. Kirk&#x27;s has an Ivory type smell where the Cal-Ben has an extremely nice almond scent. The Cal-Ben seems to cut through dirt a little better. Kirk&#x27;s is a nice soap but I give Cal-Ben the edge. Both cost about the same.</li>
    <li> This is a great soap. Also I have to say how well it has cleaned some of my clothing. Do the consumers really know what is in are soap. Your Dish, launder, hand and hair soaps most likely have animal fat and bye-products in them. You know we don&#x27;t need that. And think how bad that is for your drain pipes. Plus I always look to see if a product is tested on animals, If it is I don&#x27;t buy it. Jerry</li>
    <li> This bar of soap has A great smell to it!  It levees your skin feeling nice and soft and does not levee A waxy feeling on your skin!</li>
    <li> My husband has found Kirk&#x27;s Castile bar soap is the only soap he can wash his face with that will stop his psoriasis from breaking out.  zour market stopped carrying it so we were very happy to find it online.</li>
    <li> I used to use this because it was cheap, lasts a long time, and lathers up nicely in hard water,  After becoming disenchanted with all the P&amp;G bars and special \\&quot;skin care\\&quot; products with fragrance and skin softeners, I gave it another try.  This soap is such a great standard for the others to aspire to.  Just leaves me feeling clean; doesn&#x27;t feel dry, but also doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m coated in silicone.  It&#x27;s a perfect morning soap on a washcloth before shaving and feels like it does a good job of opening up my pores and getting my facial hair to stand up for a nice, close shave.  I also like its distinct lack of a residual scent.  Even the others&#x27; unscented bars seem to leave me smelling soapy.  It&#x27;s a little more expensive than I remember, but now I just use it because it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like it. My skin started breaking out in blotches. Went back to Dove.</li>
    <li> my favorite soap .. nothing in it that is chemical and harmful to the skin .</li>
    <li> Prefer the original scent over the coconut but still a clean rinsing product that doesn&#x27;t leave soapy residue. Unfortunately the coconut version is also much more expensive and the choices were unclear on the order form.</li>
    <li> This soap is both kind to our environment and to our skin. I forgot what it felt like to feel really clean, until I rediscovered this soap after many decades of using the soaps that floats and soaps that leave a deodorant on the skin or unneeded oils on the skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the smell after getting really clean. It brought back pleasant memories of how I felt after a bath as a very young child.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m not a snob. i&#x27;m just a regular joe. i don&#x27;t drink cristal or stay in 12-star hotels or sleep on 5-million thread count sheets.  but since i used this soap several years ago on a whim, i&#x27;ve never used anything else.   this soap makes handfuls of creamy lather and cleans grime better than most bar soaps. it rinses off cleanly and leaves behind a very mild, clean scent. i even travel with it, leaving a bar behind when i check out of the motel or leave a friend&#x27;s house.  there are two possible downsides to this fantastic soap: first, it is a very &#x27;soft&#x27; soap, meaning it dissolves quickly. if you leave it on the little soap shelf in the stream of the shower, it will disappear way before its time. second, it can irritate very young, tender skin if it&#x27;s not rinsed promptly. keeping these qualities in mind, this is the only soap in my world. so i guess i&#x27;m a soap snob? so be it.  note- there&#x27;s a liquid version of this soap, and it&#x27;s good but not as good as the bars.</li>
    <li> This is great soap...not perfumy or fake-smelling, washes off instantly, feels very clean. Only soap I&#x27;ve used in the last 15 years. But paying $6 for shipping is ridiculous for a 4 oz. item. Buy in bulk or find a local seller.</li>
    <li> I grated this up and mixed it with washing soda and borax for homemade detergent and it works really well.  It does not foam up like store bought detergents, but it is effective.</li>
    <li> I bought this soap at walmart thinking it might help out with my dry skin. I was so excited to try it that I opened it as soon as I got home and washed my hands.  I went to bed right after.  The next day I got up &amp; took a shower. Wow! Big mistake. Every part of my body was burning especially my lady parts. I rinsed off thoroughly. By mid morning my hands were bright red like a chemical burn and my whole body was a light pink &amp; slightly stinging. Never again will I use this soap. I don&#x27;t normally have sensitive skin so I would use that as an excuse. 2 days later &amp; my hands just hurt and are still bright red :(</li>
    <li> So much less expensive than Dr. Bonners castile soap.  And it smells great as well.  Good product overall and worth the cost.</li>
    <li> Really like this soap, it&#x27;s very gentle. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> First- this soap burns the skin.  I was willing to be patient with it as other reviews pointed out that the burn will fade.  Okay that part was in fact correct.  For a while I was content with this soap.  But over time I started to notice that despite the deeply dry clean I was feeling in my skin I was constantly breaking out in acne.  This is not normal for me.  In fact this only happens when I use very moisture heavy soaps.  This one clearly is quite dry so utterly baffled I continued to use this soap.  Until today.  Today a wad of sudsy foam hurtled into my right eye.  Today I experienced new levels of pain.  This wretched bar of battery acid allowed me to experience misery in the shower that I thought was only saved for when I cut my ankle shaving.  Toothpaste splatter in my eye was not as horrible as this god forsaken bar of evil.  The screaming and flailing that resulted from the sensation of ten thousand shards of glass fired at my eye was enough ruckus to cause my fiance to run into the bathroom ready to fight off the knife wielding maniac who was clearly murdering me.  For ten minutes I forced my eye open trying to wash water into it.  I could not even open my eye on my own.  Thirty minutes later and my eye is still dry and sore.  Would I recommend this soap?  Oh absolutely!  If you are a Dominatrix seeking a new torment for your clients or an agent deep in the interrogation of a suspect and you need answers pronto?  Well then this is the soap for YOU!</li>
    <li> I have used this soap for decades, actually.  Worked well, lathered great, very little scent.  The last batch I used was HORRIBLE!  Turns out, Kirk&#x27;s Natural is only a marketing company these days, apparently has very little control (or concern about) the product, and farms out the soap making to whomever (perhaps the lowest bidder?).  Proctor &amp; Gamble made this soap for decades; the marketing guru&#x27;s at Kirk&#x27;s must have found someone to do it cheaper, and in the process, ABSOLUTELY RUINED THE PRODUCT.  It&#x27;s about as gentle as a handful of Comet cleanser.  Smells like someone mixed a bunch of various Glade plug-ins and stirred them into the batch.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong - I&#x27;m willing to pay for a quality product.  This sure ain&#x27;t it.</li>
    <li> Lathers well, not to keen on scent but itsupposed to be natural anyway.:-)</li>
    <li> I purchased this soap because I like the smell of coconut, and my wife, who is very sensitive to smells, is ok with coconut soaps. But the product I received smells nothing like coconut. It&#x27;s very fragrant. It might be all natural, but the odor is strong. I don&#x27;t like it at all, and my wife refuses to allow it in the shower because the odor is so strong and unpleasant to her. Oh well, I tried. Too bad this is going straight in the garbage.</li>
    <li> Kirk&#x27;s Castile Bar Soap is not for areas with soft water. I&#x27;ve been using Kirk&#x27;s Castile Bar Soap since the 70&#x27;s. It used to be called Kirk&#x27;s Castile Hard Water Soap. For those users who are getting dried out skin and reactions, it may be your water is soft and you&#x27;re not rinsing enough. I know from personal experience that using Kirk&#x27;s in really soft water is not a good idea. I lived in Tidewater Virginia for 2 years with super duper soft water about 10 years ago and all it took was 1 shower with it to know it wasn&#x27;t going to work. I could not rinse it off, especially out of a wash cloth to save my life! Once I moved to an area with relatively hard water I was delighted to be able to start using it again. My only complaint is that it&#x27;s a bit rough on the genitals so I use baby soap for that.</li>
    <li> I think this is the best soap out there and I&#x27;ve tried many many. It cleans you from hair to toes and leaves no residue. It doesn&#x27;t dry your skin either. The lather is rich and fragrant -- not perfumey. It&#x27;s too expensive on Amazon -- go to luckyvitamin(dot)com for $1.07/bar and cheap flat rate shipping.</li>
    <li> I am happy with the product, however, I thought this was a three-pack, not just a single bar of soap.</li>
    <li> This is the only soap I&#x27;ve found that does not aggravate my eczema.  It&#x27;s nice and foamy and thick and I can use it like I used to use regular soap.</li>
    <li> It is pure and non-allergenic AND works very well in hard water.  I have used it for years &amp; ordered it online when my store did not carry it.</li>
    <li> From the FAQ page on Kirk&#x27;s website: \\&quot;Kirk&#x27;s fragrance is a special blend of mostly natural and some synthetic materials.\\&quot; Please update the ingredients list and product description for the Amazon.com entry for Kirk&#x27;s Original Coco Castile Bar Soap. It incorrectly states that it is \\&quot;all-natural.\\&quot; It is not. This matters to many of us who are chemically sensitive.</li>
    <li> love this soap i have used it all my life every day, my father used it all his life also and my sons use it to</li>
    <li> I must first say, I am not allergic to coconut oil as I cook with it, take it internally for health reasons and use it on my skin.  Naturally, I thought that this soap would be a good alternative to all of the chemical laden soaps that are on the market.  Boy was I wrong!  As I began to shower with it, I began to get a burning sensation on my chest, face, and other areas that I would rather not mention.  Then my lips began to feel numb.  Not to mention, my skin feels like there is a chalky film covering it.  I&#x27;m definitely going back to Dr. Bronner&#x27;s peppermint soap.</li>
    <li> This is a plain but very good, clean rinsing old fashioned soap. Pretty Like Me offered great customer service too and was a pleasure to deal with.</li>
    <li> My search for the perfect soap is completely over!  Kirks Original Castile Soap is the best you can buy!  I truly do not care for wacky body soaps with scents.  They never seem to get your skin clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several friends kept telling me that this was the best however no one around here sells it so I was never able to try it.  I just happened upon it in Cracker Barrel and picked up a bar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh my!  The lather was unbelievable!  The scent was clean and not overpowering!  My skin felt nourished and clean!  I even washed my hair with it and it left a clean shine to my hair.  It was an answer to a prayer years in the making from a search for the perfect soap.  No more will I buy anything else!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you buy this by the case unwrap each bar and store them in you linen closet.  The longer soap sits out to \\&quot;dry\\&quot; the longer it lasts.  Most soap is milled and used too quickly to properly dry.  It will make your closet smell fresh plus the soap will properly dry and cure.  Dry soap will last several more months than soap that is not dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor and start using this soap!  Some people even make their laundry soap with Kirks Original Castile Soap.</li>
    <li> I am so thankful that I was able to find just what I was looking for.  For the last several years I have used Kirks Castile soap.  There was a neighborhood store where I could find this item.  Several months ago, the store went out of business.  I was frantic because I had no idea where I could find this soap.  I went online and put in Kirks Castile soap and whala! I found it and it was truly a good experience to find it here on Amazon.  And to top it off the order arrived on time and I am just excited.  Its the small things that make life worth living.  Thanks again.</li>
    <li> The product was known to have a fantabulous scent.  That&#x27;s why I ordered it. It wasn&#x27;t available in any store near me so I checked Amazon.com and lo and behold, there it was!  I recommend it highly! By the way, it used to resemble the scent of Ivory soap. Ivory soap doesn&#x27;t have this scent anymore.</li>
    <li> Love this. Grated it up and mixed with water to make body wash. Helped clear up acne as well.</li>
    <li> My skin is itching and burning after haveing been in contact with this soap. I&#x27;m pretty sure its the soap cause it was only after being in contact with this soap I started itching and burning.</li>
    <li> I wish I could find this in a brick &amp; mortar store, but oh well.  This is very good soap. It lasts a long time and has a pleasant smell. This is the only brand of soap my grandmother used, I think of her each time I use it.</li>
    <li> Great for acne inversa! I can&#x27;t begin to type n the formal name of my skin condition, but if you have it, you know it by the easier to pronounce name. I bought this soap on a whim since it was a great price. OMG am I glad I bought this! At first it&#x27;s pretty drying, but since I had so many current boils and break outs, I didn&#x27;t apply any lotion afterwards. The skin felt a little tight but within three uses, my break outs have already reduced. Heck, this acted even quicker than my essential oil recipe did (3 uses versus 8 or sometimes more uses). The scent is okay and you have to rinse it off pretty well. I had no burning or redness, but despite my skin condition, my skin is not really all that sensitive. I wish I started using this product YEARS ago. It&#x27;s simply been amazing.</li>
    <li> I bought this soap hoping that it would help with very dry skin, as it&#x27;s advertised as hypoallergenic, and gentle. First, I used it to wash my hands and had no adverse reactions, so I decided to use it in the shower... Such a bad idea. It made a really nice lather, but shortly after soaping up, I noticed a slight burning sensation on my nipples. This quickly progressed to an intense burning as I hurriedly tried to rinse it off. Hours later, they&#x27;re still burning, though not as intensely. I&#x27;m just glad that&#x27;s those are the only areas that seemed to react...😄&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this soap has a bunch of good reviews. Hehehe. So if you want to give it a try, go for it (I read the reviews before trying). Hopefully, the experience won&#x27;t be as bad. 😂</li>
