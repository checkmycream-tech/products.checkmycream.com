      <li>My daughters and my favorite fragrance.</li>
      <li>I love you Gaga</li>
      <li>The rollerball runs out a bit more perfume than you&#x27;d expect from most rollers, but it doesn&#x27;t leak when the lid is on</li>
      <li>It is not an original, but at this price, I&#x27;m satisfied with it :)</li>
      <li>Teenage daughter loved it!</li>
      <li>I was excited to find this deal because I love this scent.  </li>
      <li>Such a great price &#x3D;)</li>
      <li>However, it was cheap, but there is a reason.  </li>
      <li>This was a gift for, and the girl who recived it, liked it really much...</li>
      <li>The lotion is a bit more liquid-ey than most lotions I purchase, but in spite of the lack of creaminess it&#x27;s very hydrating without being overpoweringly fragrant</li>
      <li>great price, smells exactly the same as the store bought ones.</li>
      <li>Not a bad smell for the money.  </li>
      <li>Arrived quickly as well</li>
      <li>br /&gt;it&#x27;s not too strong but not weak and lasts all day</li>
      <li>Fast shipping, smells wonderful, much larger bottles than I expected</li>
      <li>Stronger is the sense of it last all day with just a couple of sprays, this one starts of strong and then dies off quickly.</li>
      <li>Sephora was selling one bottle of this perfume for more than this entire box.  </li>
      <li>All 3 products in the box smell amazing and exactly like any of the other &amp;#34;Fame&amp;#34; products I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
      <li>This would make such an incredible gift, it comes in a big fancy box that is pretty fun to open up!</li>
      <li>I love the smell of Lady Gaga, it is my favorite perfume and it just amazed me that I had been getting the 3.4 ounce bottle only for $22 when I could have been getting this whole set for less,</li>
      <li>and it is so much stronger than this one.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really use the lotion stuff</li>
      <li>the package came the next day and i am very pleased with everything i got for such a low price i recommend this product for anybody</li>
      <li>i highly recommend this product</li>
      <li>If it makes them happy, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
      <li>I love this black colored perfume it comes on clear, and the smell is divine</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a heavy, almost smoky honey flavour with hints of floral and a touch of leather beneath it that envelops you and stays strong for around 5 hours before beginning to fade.</li>

<li> Its not too floral, so you don&#x27;t feel like a little old lady wearing it.</li>
<li> /&gt;This came with the same perfume that I purchased before, but also came with a &amp;#34;roller&amp;#34; perfume as well as a lotion, for less than the perfume alone.</li>
<li> , it&#x27;s sticky and not really like lotion at all</li>
<li> only gripe is that it did not ship on time and was roughly a week late...</li>
<li> The perfume is diluted, I have the one I had previously purchased from the store</li>
<li> Yes, the black disappears once it&#x27;s rubbed in.</li>
<li> Even if your on the fence, this still costs less, so why would you purchase anything else?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> However, black lotion is just too weird.</li>
<li> what a steal considering how expensive perfumes are in stores.</li>
<li> You would be crazy to purchase these separately.</li>

    <li> Bought for my daughter for her birthday and she LOVED it! All 3 products in the box smell amazing and exactly like any of the other &amp;#34;Fame&amp;#34; products I&#x27;ve purchased. Would definitely buy again and am very happy with my purchase! Arrived quickly as well</li>
    <li> Great value. Use the rollerball for travel.</li>
    <li> love this hopefully i will buy this again</li>
    <li> GORGEOUS!!!! Smells amazing and the sizes are perfect!!! What an awesome gift! I will buy again!!!</li>
    <li> Bought for my wife.  She&#x27;s the GAGA fan of the family.  Got dragged to a couple concerts and now the perfume comes out.  Not a bad smell for the money.  If it makes them happy, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> SMELLS LIKE HEAVEN&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s not too strong but not weak and lasts all day</li>
    <li> Love it! One of my favorite perfumes. Such a great price &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> great price and my daughter, my daughter in law, and my sons girlfriend all loved this perfume....</li>
    <li> This was a gift for, and the girl who recived it, liked it really much... Perfect gift and chep as well. :)</li>
    <li> I was excited to find this deal because I love this scent.  However, it was cheap, but there is a reason.  The perfume is diluted, I have the one I had previously purchased from the store and it is so much stronger than this one.  Stronger is the sense of it last all day with just a couple of sprays, this one starts of strong and then dies off quickly.</li>
    <li> Great deal. It isn&#x27;t diluted.</li>
    <li> Perfection! Baaaa I love you Gaga</li>
    <li> I love Lady Gaga Fame Perfume...it smells amazing! This is a great set for a great price. However, black lotion is just too weird. It looks like you&#x27;re rubbing dirt/black oily substance all over your body when applied. Yes, the black disappears once it&#x27;s rubbed in. But, I still don&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve purchased the Gaga perfume before, then you already know this is an excellent product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This came with the same perfume that I purchased before, but also came with a &amp;#34;roller&amp;#34; perfume as well as a lotion, for less than the perfume alone. Even if your on the fence, this still costs less, so why would you purchase anything else?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only gripe is that it did not ship on time and was roughly a week late...missed my gf&#x27;s birthday. 4 stars for shipping-otherwise it would have been 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t recommend more. You would be crazy to purchase these separately.</li>
    <li> what a great buy!  the smell is perfect for day &amp; night</li>
    <li> My daughters and my favorite fragrance.</li>
    <li> Dosen&#x27;t get any better than this price! Love, love, love.  An $89 value for $17!</li>
    <li> i love the smell of this perfume it smells amazing!!! this is the 2nd time im purchasing the perfume but this time i thought it would be awesome to get the body lotion and the roller ball to carry around. let me tell you how AMAZING the body lotion smells and the perfume like i said smells amazing the package came the next day and i am very pleased with everything i got for such a low price i recommend this product for anybody i am always getting complaints on how good i smell this gift set is an awesome gift and if you just want the perfume the perfume has an amazing scent!!!! i highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> It is not an original, but at this price, I&#x27;m satisfied with it :)</li>
    <li> I purchased this solely because of the fact it&#x27;s Lady Gaga fragrance and ended up purchasing one of the most delicious fragrances I&#x27;ve ever owned. It&#x27;s a heavy, almost smoky honey flavour with hints of floral and a touch of leather beneath it that envelops you and stays strong for around 5 hours before beginning to fade. The rollerball runs out a bit more perfume than you&#x27;d expect from most rollers, but it doesn&#x27;t leak when the lid is on so it&#x27;s definitely purse-safe! The lotion is a bit more liquid-ey than most lotions I purchase, but in spite of the lack of creaminess it&#x27;s very hydrating without being overpoweringly fragrant</li>
    <li> As described ..very pleased!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, smells wonderful, much larger bottles than I expected so I&#x27;m very pleased with the price, what a steal considering how expensive perfumes are in stores.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of Lady Gaga, it is my favorite perfume and it just amazed me that I had been getting the 3.4 ounce bottle only for $22 when I could have been getting this whole set for less,smh.....I don&#x27;t really use the lotion stuff, it&#x27;s sticky and not really like lotion at all but the perfume smells soooooooooooo good, love it!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing it for 2 years, it&#x27;s one of my favorites...</li>
    <li> Teenage daughter loved it!</li>
    <li> Wonderful set for a awesome prize. Lady Gaga never disappoints.</li>
    <li> Really love the scent good deal.</li>
    <li> I love this black colored perfume it comes on clear, and the smell is divine</li>
