      <li>(I have a fair to medium complexion) but the fragrance was too strong.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think it would be suitable for people with oily skin</li>
      <li>I believe the medium version is better than the light one on my fair skin.  </li>
      <li>It goes on very easily and leaves a healthy glow.</li>

      <li>I used to love the color/tint of this product.  </li>
      <li>and I love this product.  </li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>but this seems to be fresher and better color.  </li>
      <li>and it doesn&#x27;t make my skin oily, just moist and healthy.  </li>
      <li>There is still a scent/smell, but I think it is better than the Jergens scent which I have also used.</li>
      <li>i love this lotion.  </li>
      <li>Love this product for face and the one for your body.  </li>
      <li>- so glad to find it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>so, I&#x27;m glad I could purchase it through this seller on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>more need to spend hours in the sun -</li>
      <li>I have dry skin anyway and find that despite the added sunscreen it makes a wonderful night cream.  </li>
      <li>(I am moderately fair and after 2 uses have a nice light summer color - natural looking).  </li>
      <li>Just make sure your face is really, really clean before you apply.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m also not a fan of the strong sunscreen scent.</li>
      <li>I break out easily with a lot of products but so far so good with one</li>
      <li>Does have a  light self-tanner odor which is why I prefer to use it in the evening.  </li>
      <li>Goes on smoothly and absorbs without being oily.  </li>
      <li>I have used the light version and the medium version.  </li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure if I liked this at first as it is VERY moisturizing</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the first sunless tanning product I&#x27;ve bought that doesn&#x27;t have that smell most of them seem to have.  </li>
      <li>Other than that I am happy with this product.</li>
      <li>I recently bought the L&#x27;Oreal Sunless Sublime Glow Daily Moisturizer for body, and have been very happy with it.  </li>
      <li>I have used it a long time and it doesn&#x27;t make me orange, just a nice summer shade of tan.</li>
      <li>But overall, I&#x27;d recommend this product if you&#x27;re looking for a healthy glow on your face without having to apply bronzers or foundations.</li>
      <li>These wipes are a lot better than the body tanner - my colleague actually asked me if I&#x27;d been to the beach!</li>
      <li>If anyone uses Bare Escentuals, I use fairly light.  </li>
      <li>I live in Florida but am rarely in the sun.  </li>
      <li>Really wanted to like the product.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also very moisturizing</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t expect much</li>
      <li>I wish it were available in the local stores, but since it&#x27;s not, AMAZON works!</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this item and the seller.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not super strong, but it&#x27;s there.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very sensitive to fragrances and ended up with a headache both times</li>
      <li>but since I have the opposite problem I am grateful to find a facial self-tanner that actually moisturizes well as most do not.</li>
      <li>I called L&#x27;oreal about this, and they were surprised that any companies were still selling this EXPIRED product!  </li>
      <li>Only downside is a slight aroma that might be considered less than pleasant by some, but it fades quickly and doesn&#x27;t bother me enough to stop using the product.</li>
      <li>It really gave my face that extra burst of color that I was looking for without going completely orange on me.</li>
      <li>Natural color w/</li>
      <li>No tan ever developed.</li>
      <li>I love the subtle natural color it gives to your skin.  </li>

<li> but this was suppose to give at least a \\&quot;glow\\&quot;...and didn&#x27;t deliver.</li>

    <li> I live in Florida but am rarely in the sun.  L&#x27;Oreal Sublime Glow WAS great for me ( WAS because I couldn&#x27;t find it any more until I checked Amazon.com. ) Now, I&#x27;ll have a &#x27;glow&#x27; agin.</li>
    <li> I like the product, but I don&#x27;t feel it is changing the tone of my skin. would like it to go darker. Good moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I was surprised to read negative reviews of this product. I was really happy with the results. It really gave my face that extra burst of color that I was looking for without going completely orange on me. The color starts to appear after about an hour of putting it on, and the more often you apply it (daily, every two days, etc.) the color will last longer. For example, if you only use it once a week, the color will probably only last 24 hours. But if you use it almost every day for seven days, the color will probably last you four or five days without having to reapply.     I&#x27;m also a big fan of the Sublime Glow for the body.    The only reason that I gave this product four stars instead of five is because it tends to clog my pores if I use it every day. But I also have acne-prone skin, so I have to be really careful when it comes to using moisturizer anyway.    But overall, I&#x27;d recommend this product if you&#x27;re looking for a healthy glow on your face without having to apply bronzers or foundations.</li>
    <li> i love this lotion.  i use it every morning after washing my face as a daily moisturizer and also spf.  i can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore, that&#x27;s why i ordered it off amazon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used L&#x27;Oreal Sunless Sublime Glow Daily Moisturizer for years as a moisturizer under my makeup.  My face always looks tanned, without the sun exposure.  I have been unable to find this in our local retail stores, so, I&#x27;m glad I could purchase it through this seller on Amazon.  It was packaged extremely well, and, it arrived in just a few days.  I highly recommend this item and the seller.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times but it seems to do the job. It&#x27;s not greasy and adds a little color to my face. I break out easily with a lot of products but so far so good with one</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure if I liked this at first as it is VERY moisturizing but I use it at night after cleansing and toning.  I have dry skin anyway and find that despite the added sunscreen it makes a wonderful night cream.  Just make sure your face is really, really clean before you apply.  Does have a  light self-tanner odor which is why I prefer to use it in the evening.  It works for daytime as well but I just use it on the weekend for daytime when I am not wearing any other makeup as it&#x27;s a little too heavy if you put anything over it.  I don&#x27;t think it would be suitable for people with oily skin but since I have the opposite problem I am grateful to find a facial self-tanner that actually moisturizes well as most do not.</li>
    <li> These wipes are a lot better than the body tanner - my colleague actually asked me if I&#x27;d been to the beach!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product.  I love the subtle natural color it gives to your skin.  I have pale skin and I use Medium.  It goes on very easily and leaves a healthy glow.</li>
    <li> I used it once a day for a few days and was not noticing a change. I decided to double my applications. I used it twice a day for a week. Not a hint of color. No tan ever developed. It&#x27;s good as a moisturizer and sunscreen, but not at all as a sunless tanner.</li>
    <li> I have been using this daily moisturizer for almost two years now and I love this product.  I use it all winter long here in Boston and it gives me just a hint of color, like I just got back from a relaxing vacation.  It doesn&#x27;t streak and works well with my other skin products.  In fact, I have had a hard time finding it so I am ordering two - one for my travel bag and one for home. The nice thing is it doesn&#x27; streak at all and gives just the softest hint of color.  Perfect for me!</li>
    <li> It helps my keep my face looking tan.</li>
    <li> Excellent my wife loves</li>
    <li> Want to bring a touch of color for the &amp;#34;shorts&amp;#34; weather after a super long cold winter....worked great and exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried them all, I love this one because it gives your skin a nice healthy glow and the color is perfect. It&#x27;s also very moisturizing so it gives you a perfect balance for your skin but the glow is amazing it plumps up the skin, I get compliments every time I wear it. I use it on my neck and chest too, great price and there is no smell! Try it you&#x27;l be glad you did! A+</li>
    <li> Really wanted to like the product.  The color match was good (I have a fair to medium complexion) but the fragrance was too strong.  I&#x27;m very sensitive to fragrances and ended up with a headache both times I used it.</li>
    <li> I have used the light version and the medium version.  I believe the medium version is better than the light one on my fair skin.  No orange tones for me.  Just a nice looking tan.  If anyone uses Bare Escentuals, I use fairly light.  There is still a scent/smell, but I think it is better than the Jergens scent which I have also used.</li>
    <li> I use this daily, but am not seeing much of a difference, unfortunately. Will keep looking for the best face tanning product.</li>
    <li> This is the best product for people with fair skin because it tans and looks natural !&lt;br /&gt;No more need to spend hours in the sun - and of course it is SAFER than the sun !</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried the fair skin one and thought I&#x27;d try this one......I can&#x27;t say I see a difference between the two, I&#x27;ll buy again.</li>
    <li> I have used this product since it came out and suddenly I couldn&#x27;t find it in the &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; places, such as drugstores etc.  I like the way it gives a little color and moisturizes my skin.  I use it daily and it doesn&#x27;t make my skin oily, just moist and healthy.  I wish it were available in the local stores, but since it&#x27;s not, AMAZON works!</li>
    <li> This works as far as color goes but is thick so just use a little.  Thickness makes it a little hard to smooth around evenly.  a little smelly too</li>
    <li> I use this product for 4 years and like it a lot. It was very cheap, but not expired so good deal.</li>
    <li> I recently bought the L&#x27;Oreal Sunless Sublime Glow Daily Moisturizer for body, and have been very happy with it.  It&#x27;s the first sunless tanning product I&#x27;ve bought that doesn&#x27;t have that smell most of them seem to have.  Now I&#x27;ve tried this stuff for the face, and it also works well (I am moderately fair and after 2 uses have a nice light summer color - natural looking).  However, the face moisturizer has that smell!  It&#x27;s not super strong, but it&#x27;s there.  It might not bother everyone, it&#x27;s just not the way I personally want to smell!  Other than that I am happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t show up until the 3rd day and turns your face orange. Buy the Sublime BRONZE, not GLOW. It works fully in 3 days and gives a beautiful bronze, not orange.</li>
    <li> After using for about a week, I started breaking out. Stopped using it and decided about 2 months later to try again but the same thing happened.</li>
    <li> I am impressed with this batch I received, I have ordered it before but this seems to be fresher and better color.  I have used it a long time and it doesn&#x27;t make me orange, just a nice summer shade of tan.</li>
    <li> I used to love the color/tint of this product.  But now any for sale are 4 years old and smell bad and don&#x27;t work..I called L&#x27;oreal about this, and they were surprised that any companies were still selling this EXPIRED product!  I returned it and got my refund,</li>
    <li> Product was as expected.</li>
    <li> Love this product for face and the one for your body.  Gives you a nice glow with out damage to your skin.</li>
    <li> (Joe&#x27;s wife again)  Another hard to find product - so glad to find it on Amazon. I don&#x27;t wear foundation - only moisturizer - and this is a moisturizer and skin bronzer with an SPF and &#x27;illuminates&#x27; as well.  Leaves my face looking a bit tan and dewy and also protects from the sun.  Goes on smoothly and absorbs without being oily.  Only downside is a slight aroma that might be considered less than pleasant by some, but it fades quickly and doesn&#x27;t bother me enough to stop using the product.</li>
    <li> I tan a lot but tanning the face is tricky. I don&#x27;t expect much but this was suppose to give at least a \\&quot;glow\\&quot;...and didn&#x27;t deliver. I&#x27;m also not a fan of the strong sunscreen scent. On the upside, my skin drinks this up and my skin stays moisturized throughout the day.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I use it year round. Natural color w/ no orangeness. It has just become part of my going to bed routine.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer, will say more when the product is completely used, good for winter  use as well, may purchase another.</li>
