      <li>Great item - perfect size.  </li>
      <li>Great product and price</li>
      <li>Works great for the buffing of nails and stuff</li>
      <li>and they do a great job.</li>
      <li>Great for sample packs and doing my own nails!</li>
      <li>Good service good product</li>
      <li>Good for sample packages and one time use...</li>
      <li>Perfect and fast delivery</li>
      <li>But they are handy for Jamberry parties. :-)</li>
      <li>Love these.</li>
      <li>Love being able to buy them in bulk.</li>
      <li>They didn&#x27;t come in the shrink wrap, which I didn&#x27;t like, but they were super cheap, so it would&#x27;ve cost more to return them.</li>
      <li>These nail blocks are awesome and just the right size to send to people with other nail accessories.</li>
      <li>I was expecting a teensie bit larger (more rectangular-less square) and a bit more grit to them.</li>
      <li>The size is economical and works well for prep work to do gel polish</li>
      <li>Super fast shipping</li>
      <li>I mean, these work for said purpose, but more for a one use &#x27;n&#x27; toss kind of way.</li>
      <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve ordered this product</li>
      <li>They were exactly what I wanted...</li>
      <li>Too small to be effective.</li>
      <li>Although you always want to be careful, they are great around the cuticle and not to harsh on natural nails.</li>
      <li>These are small, which is what I love about them</li>
      <li>These are as rough as nail files - I would never use them to buff natural nails!  </li>

<li> The other reviews through me off.</li>
<li> They are a little rougher than I expected being they&#x27;re a buffer.</li>
<li> These are hard to find, but 126 should last awhile.</li>
<li> I can use on a customer and throw them away and not feel bad about throwing away product.</li>
<li> These are &amp;#34;okay.&amp;#34; I was a bit disappointed in the sizes of each piece, however.</li>
