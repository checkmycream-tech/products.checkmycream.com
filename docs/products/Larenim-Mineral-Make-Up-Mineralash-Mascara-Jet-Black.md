      <li>Spreads well and has a great color, doesn&#x27;t clump when I use it.</li>
      <li>and larenim is a great choice.  </li>
      <li>This is lovely made with good ingredients</li>
      <li>This goes on nice but by the end of the day it has disintegrated off my lashes.  </li>
      <li>Nice packaging.</li>
      <li>This mascara does not clump and it separates my eye lashes nicely.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been trying to find a great vegan friendly mascara for quite sometime</li>
      <li>but I realize its not waterproof &amp; a healthy allergy option</li>
      <li>Most drug store mascara&#x27;s</li>
      <li>Since it&#x27;s supposed to promote healthy lashes, I don&#x27;t worry if it doesn&#x27;t all come off before bed anyway.</li>
      <li>DOES NOT IRRITATE MY EYES AS MANY OTHERS DO.  </li>
      <li>I love Larenim</li>
      <li>I also love that Larenim does not test on animals.</li>
      <li>This mascara is a nice and light and comes off easily.</li>
      <li>Natural looking full healthy lashes!!!</li>
      <li>I love this mascara because it is vegan and it also comes off easily when I wash my face unlike others mascaras I have tried.</li>
      <li>Very lumpy and does not look good when put on :</li>
      <li>Some reviews said this washes off easily.</li>
      <li>This goes on easily and does not feel brittle or cakey.</li>
      <li>Goes on smoothly and comes off easily.  </li>
      <li>- it smells like a cheap lip gloss.</li>
      <li>Floral, sweet, and powdery</li>
      <li>Not bad for a non-toxic mascara.</li>
      <li>LOVE NATURAL PRODUCTS.  </li>
      <li>I used to use popular commercial brands and they would burn my eyes.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s worth it to me.</li>
      <li>I love this mascara because it&#x27;s free of preservatives and other potentially unsafe chemicals that most mascaras have in them, and it also goes on smoothly (no clumps) and looks great!</li>
      <li>It mostly comes off easily with no special makeup remover, but it takes some effort to get it all off.</li>
      <li>I really like it despite the thinner coverage!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the first one I&#x27;ve tried</li>
      <li>-(dries on fast but eyelashes get stuck together .l will not buy again</li>
      <li>I really wanted to like this one</li>
      <li>but I would rather stick with the Sephora Full Action mascara which has the same safety rating from EWG.</li>
      <li>AS FAR AS SENSITIVITY IS CONCERNED!</li>
      <li>Secondly, it has a really unusual, old lady perfume smell.</li>
      <li>My old mascara was causing my lashes to cake together</li>
      <li>DO NOT USE IF YOU HAVE SENSITIVE EYES.  </li>
      <li>Does not irritate my sensitive eyes.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure what they were thinking with this product, the only nice part is the outside of the tube, which is a rubbery plastic.</li>
      <li>For starters, the wand bristles are so tightly packed together that you are basically just rubbing mascara onto the underside of your eyelashes as opposed to getting any sort of individual, or full coverage.</li>
      <li>Clumps a little, but worth it for the lack of mercury.</li>
      <li>I only use natural, mineral makeup now.</li>
      <li>I recently made the switch to all natural make up</li>
      <li>Smells a little funny, but works well.</li>
      <li>I find it much more pleasant than the horribly smelling, extremely toxic commercial brands.</li>

    <li> Not bad for a non-toxic mascara. Smells a little funny, but works well. Clumps a little, but worth it for the lack of mercury.</li>
    <li> I only use natural, mineral makeup now. This mascara is a nice and light and comes off easily. The only complaint I have is it doesn&#x27;t build your lashes - it coats them but doesn&#x27;t give the oompf! It does not irritate my eyes or shed off. I really like it despite the thinner coverage!</li>
    <li> This goes on nice but by the end of the day it has disintegrated off my lashes.  I&#x27;m also finding that my eyelashes are falling out one or two a day. It doesn&#x27;t seem to irritate my eyes but I would rather stick with the Sephora Full Action mascara which has the same safety rating from EWG.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara because it is vegan and it also comes off easily when I wash my face unlike others mascaras I have tried. It also does not clump on your eyelashes</li>
    <li> Great brush! Spreads well and has a great color, doesn&#x27;t clump when I use it. There is no strong smell to it. Nice packaging.</li>
    <li> Goes on smoothly and comes off easily.  Does not irritate my sensitive eyes.  I like that it does not contain all of the chemicals that other mascaras do.  I will purchase this mascara again.</li>
    <li> This is the best mascara I have ever used. No clumping. Natural looking full healthy lashes!!!</li>
    <li> I recently made the switch to all natural make up and larenim is a great choice.  It doesn&#x27;t smell weird, it&#x27;s vegan, it does not clump, and it will wipe off.  Most drug store mascara&#x27;s I&#x27;ve used in the past gunk on my eyelashes for ages. It&#x27;s the first one I&#x27;ve tried and I&#x27;m very happy with my choice.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to find a great vegan friendly mascara for quite sometime and this was by far the worst. It goes on great but starts to smudge off within an hour. I really wanted to like this one but I have no desire to look like a raccoon by 9am.</li>
    <li> This is lovely made with good ingredients and it goes on well and looks natural however it does smear to your under eye area after a few hours.</li>
    <li> DO NOT USE IF YOU HAVE SENSITIVE EYES.  THIS IS HORRIBLE ON THE EYES AS FAR AS SENSITIVITY IS CONCERNED! TOTAL WASTE OF HARD EARNED MONEY!</li>
    <li> I am a corn allergy sufferer and it is so difficult to find Corn free makeup, finally found one! One complaint is, it smudges a bit but I realize its not waterproof &amp; a healthy allergy option so it&#x27;s worth it to me.</li>
    <li> QUALITY MASCARA AT AFFORDALE PRICE.  LOVE NATURAL PRODUCTS.  DOES NOT IRRITATE MY EYES AS MANY OTHERS DO.  NO FLAKING AND NO CLUMPING!</li>
    <li> It runs under my eyes! I love Larenim but this was a waste of my money.</li>
    <li> I recently switched to mineral based makeup products and picked this up at my local health foods store because it&#x27;s the only local mineral mascara I could find. For starters, the wand bristles are so tightly packed together that you are basically just rubbing mascara onto the underside of your eyelashes as opposed to getting any sort of individual, or full coverage. Secondly, it has a really unusual, old lady perfume smell. Floral, sweet, and powdery - it smells like a cheap lip gloss. Why on earth I would want my eyelashes to smell like anything, I have no idea. I&#x27;m not sure what they were thinking with this product, the only nice part is the outside of the tube, which is a rubbery plastic.</li>
    <li> I have been using this mascara for years, as well as their eye shadows. I actually like the smell of this product. I find it much more pleasant than the horribly smelling, extremely toxic commercial brands. This mascara does not clump and it separates my eye lashes nicely. I also love that Larenim does not test on animals. I used to use popular commercial brands and they would burn my eyes. I have never had a problem with this one. Helpful tip - when the mascara starts to dry out, put three drops of contact solution in the tube and your mascara will last even longer!</li>
    <li> This mascara is very dried out.  I bought three so I don&#x27;t know what to do.</li>
    <li> Very lumpy and does not look good when put on :-(dries on fast but eyelashes get stuck together .l will not buy again</li>
    <li> I love this mascara because it&#x27;s free of preservatives and other potentially unsafe chemicals that most mascaras have in them, and it also goes on smoothly (no clumps) and looks great! This is my second tube.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m trying to replace all my cosmetics with vegan products so based on some searching and reviews, I chose this. My old mascara was causing my lashes to cake together and then I&#x27;d find myself pulling them out in clumps! This goes on easily and does not feel brittle or cakey. Some reviews said this washes off easily. It mostly comes off easily with no special makeup remover, but it takes some effort to get it all off. Since it&#x27;s supposed to promote healthy lashes, I don&#x27;t worry if it doesn&#x27;t all come off before bed anyway.</li>
