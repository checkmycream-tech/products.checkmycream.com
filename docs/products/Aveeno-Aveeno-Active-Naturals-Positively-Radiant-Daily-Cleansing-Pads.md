      <li>I have never used a cleansing pad with exfoliators I actually liked.  </li>
      <li>I will be honest...</li>
      <li>They suds up &amp; really do a great job at taking off makeup &amp; giving your skin a clean &amp; refreshed feeling.  </li>

      <li>Im glad it&#x27;s worked so well for everyone else.  </li>
      <li>I tend to use the pads more than once to save on money.</li>
      <li>I felt like they could have made about 10 more pads with the 28 that are in the container.  </li>
      <li>MY skin is more even, it&#x27;s smoother &amp; softer...</li>
      <li>I was able to take off all dirt and makeup as well as cleanse my skin.</li>
      <li>There is plenty of cleanser on the pads to be able to remove a face-full of makeup, even while rinsing the pad a bit in the process.  </li>
      <li>I found that the Aveeno cleaning pads were quite refreshing.  </li>
      <li>I thought maybe in the shower it would be ok, but still, no.</li>

      <li>Leaves you face feeling nice and clean.</li>

      <li>Always gets my face very clean without drying it out.</li>
      <li>This was perfect to take camping for my daughter and I to use every night, soapy gentle cleaner that really help get the dust off at the end of each day</li>
      <li>I eventually ended up using Clear Complexion pads and though they are great exfoliating and cleaning the skin...</li>
      <li>They make my skin feel smooth and healthy.</li>
      <li>Skin care is more important to me than makeup...</li>
      <li>Works well and easy to use.</li>
      <li>Like 4 layers of Bounty strong...</li>
      <li>I use them more than once because they lather so richly and after two uses, I clean my sink and vanity with them.</li>
      <li>The cleanser does a great job of removing oil, left over make up, and all without drying my skin.</li>
      <li>Amaizing i liked is so much</li>
      <li>Actually cleans your face &amp; it&#x27;s great that it has side for exfoliation.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great pads, I usually only get the positively radiant ones. I tried these a year ago and now I am hooked, since the pads are so big I cut them in half for more value.</li>
    <li> This product exceeds any other of this type that I have used for facial cleaning including creams, bar soaps, pads, cloths, etc.  These pads are packaged well and maintain their moisture and cleansing elements with a high degree of effectiveness.  The cleanser is gentle and thorough.  I travel with them and use them at home and cannot say enough good things about them.</li>
    <li> great for the gym bag or the car!  Always a refreshing pick me up whenever you need it!</li>
    <li> I work fast food so you can imagine how terrible that is for someone with sensitive oily acne prone skin. I went to spend some time with my sister straight after work one day and she had me use these and WOW is the best way to describe these wonderful things. My face felt completely clean like it cleaned away all of my makeup and i felt it cleaning my pores. I looked at my face the next day and it looked so much clearer than it has in years. I will definitely be buying some of my own and i recommend these to everyone who want a clear and clean face.</li>
    <li> My daughter uses these and told me to try them. They seem to be a bit more reasonably priced @ Wal-Mart. These are wonderful. They make my skin feel smooth and healthy. I tend to use the pads more than once to save on money. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Great Product! Great Seller!</li>
    <li> Great product! Actually cleans your face &amp; it&#x27;s great that it has side for exfoliation. It doesn&#x27;t come in flimsy container so you can be assured they won&#x27;t dry out because lead screws shut, not plastic stick covering like on most facial wipes!</li>
    <li> THese are my favorite cleansing pads. I love the scent and they are foaming and have 2 different textures. One side is a little smoother than the other in case you have sensitive skin. The rougher side really cleans well. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried this product b4 and I really like it! Now my 18 year old daughter loves it too and it helped clear her skin!</li>
    <li> Love these. They clean my face gently or with the exfoliating side and remove makeup verry well. Thought about giving 4 stars bc they should sell replacement packs of the pads instead of having to buy the big plastic tub of them so often. But the pads rock</li>
    <li> I will be honest... I really like these pads. Too bad they don&#x27;t come in a larger quantity! I typically started using Aveeno products to combat redness from the harsh chemicals I had to start using for my adult acne. I eventually ended up using Clear Complexion pads and though they are great exfoliating and cleaning the skin... I switched to the Positively Radiant pads and boy was that a smart move. These pads tone down any sort of redness I might have, as well as exfoliate my skin, and leave it feeling soft, clean, and moisturized. I am now 37 and moisture is a necessity for healthy and beautiful skim. Besides scrubbing my face with these and clean my neck, chest and behind my ears... Why not! lol</li>
    <li> I love this product! The Aveeno cleansing pads really cleans very well. I use foundation every day and this product is the only one that cleanses thoroughly and does not break my skin out. It removes all traces of makeup efficiently! Excellent product and price at Amazon!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Surprise to me, but you have to rinse off your face afterwards.  I was initially dismayed when I read this instruction because I had been looking for something I could use to clean my face very quickly when I don&#x27;t want to bother getting all wet.  This product will not work for that.  HOWEVER, it works remarkably well for what it does do.  I&#x27;ve only used them twice, but I already have noted an improvement in my skin.  (I have eczema and really sensitive skin, so the fact that these don&#x27;t bother me is amazing.  Them working well is just a bonus.)  The exfoliation side provides the perfect amount of \\&quot;scrub\\&quot; for me.  I&#x27;ve used other products that were much too rough.  I agree with the previous reviewer who stated that the pads are extremely large.  I will be cutting mine in half also.</li>
    <li> I JUST GOT THESE AVEENO POSITIVELY RADIANT DAILY CLEANSING PADS FROM WAL MART ON SATURDAY AND I LIKE THEM BECAUSE YOU CAN CLEANSE YOUR FACE AND EXFOLIATE YOUR FACE WITH ONLY ONE PRODUCT. I DIDN&#x27;T THINK THAT THEY WOULD WORK VERY WELL BUT THEY PROVED ME WRONG. SO I RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE WHO DOESN&#x27;T WANT TO DAMAGE THEIR SKIN WITH A PRODUCT LIKE THIS.</li>
    <li> I would like to say that this is the best facial cleanser I&#x27;ve had yet so far!!! Even though I didn&#x27;t buy it through Amazon.com but I just happened to hear about it through a make up youtube tutorial and I just bought it the other day and it&#x27;s already working wonders on my face. I really love the way my face feels afterwards. Like most facial cleansers they usually leave your face very tight and dry like but this one doesn&#x27;t.It really leaves my facial skin very soft and I really love that feeling. If anybody purchase this product will find out also that you will have to cut these facial pads in half because they are a big and to be honest that one half of the pad will cleanse your whole face because it has enough cleanser on it to sud up on your face so that will be my best advice to anyone is to cut these pads in half and use one half for the morning and the other half for at night before bedtime. Again, this is a great product and I would recommend it to anyone!!!!</li>
    <li> These cleansing pads are good, however I thought they would be a little bit different. I usually use the wipes by Ponds, the ones you just use to clean your make up off , without needing to add water. But I did still like these.</li>
    <li> Received these sooner than expected. They suds well and do a nice job....other reviews kept saying each pad is so large they had to cut them in half....I, on the other hand, found them to be the usual size one would expect. I not only wash my face, but also my neck, so the pads are just the right size for the task. Will most likely buy them again.</li>
    <li> Really just a soapy pad.  You have to use something else to then clean it off.  I prefer pads that will just remove your makeup and mascara.</li>
    <li> This is the only thing I&#x27;ve ever found that works for me. Everything else used to leave my skin red.&lt;br /&gt;It keeps my face fresh and smells good actually.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for at least 7 yrs - they are the ONLY facial cleansing product that thoroughly removes my makeup. Everything else, including the really expensive dept store cleansers, leaves behind residue that requires a cottonball/toner to remove. With the Aveeno pads, there is NO residue. I swear by them.</li>
    <li> This was perfect to take camping for my daughter and I to use every night, soapy gentle cleaner that really help get the dust off at the end of each day</li>
    <li> My daughter and I love these! Soft but cleansing but not drying! I will continue to buy these in the future.</li>
    <li> Wonderful facial scrub</li>
    <li> I am a 35 year old female, with adult acne.  I have tried every kind of facial cleansers possible, from the cheapest to the most expensive.  These cleansing pads are AWESOME.  It took about 2 weeks and my face it perfect.  The pads are really large and I cut them in half, and use one half in the morning and one in the evening!  I will never use anything else.  I also use the Aveeno Daily Radiance SPF 15.  Run to the store and try these!</li>
    <li> I love these. Minus one star because they are almost either too large, or too soapy. I cut them in half because I feel like I am wasting product at the end because their is a lot left in the pad. The cleanser is very gentle, and I really like the exfoliating side of the pad. Very useful for when I am in a hurry and don&#x27;t have time to do my whole skin care routine. I also like to use them in the morning if I need a quick cleanse or if I wake up and my face is a little oily.</li>
    <li> I love these but feel a bit profligate ordering something I could probably concoct at home. There appears to be some mild soap, witch hazel and aloe applied to compressed fiber pads which are disposable....Not very green. I use them more than once because they lather so richly and after two uses, I clean my sink and vanity with them. They don&#x27;t strip my skin of all of its oils and leave my face feeling fresh without any irritation. The only improvement would be to have the lotion and use my own wash cloths....</li>
    <li> Takes makeup off thoroughly, even non-waterproof eye makeup. Works quickly no scrubbing required. Not an effective exfoliant though it claims to be. I found it to be a bit harsh, so I rinse immediately after use and follow up with my regular gentle cleanser.</li>
    <li> Just as described and will purchase from again! :) loved the product too!</li>
    <li> I picked these up in real life thinking it was a new label/name of the Aveeno Positively Ageless Daily Cleansing Pads I had bookmarked on Amazon, and IT IS NOT the same formula! In the shower, after scrubbing my face with one of these pads, I felt a slight stinging, and when I rinsed it off, it didn&#x27;t COME off, continued to burn, and I had to rinse and rinse, and then use a different soap to get the chemical-feeling slimy film off my face. Even after that, after I got out and dried off, my skin felt like it was burning, and I had to put Bio-Oil on my face to get it to stop! I tried to use them once to wash my face at the sink as well, but there&#x27;s NO WAY to get them to rinse off that way, half the bathroom was doused with water and my shirt was soaked, trying to rinse this off! I thought maybe in the shower it would be ok, but still, no. I will use them up by carefully using them less than twice a week, but I am really tempted to return them instead! These are HARSH and make my face BURN, even after washed off with another soap and after moisturizer! NOT FOR DRY OR SENSITIVE SKIN! NOT AT ALL the same as the Positively Ageless pads! Like washing your face with acid!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t make my mistake, these are NOT these, it is a different formula! Buy these instead if you have sensitive skin: http://www.amazon.com/Aveeno-Daily-Cleansing-Pads-28/dp/B001R1VMSA/ref&#x3D;sr_1_13?s&#x3D;beauty&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1420707134&amp;sr&#x3D;1-13&amp;keywords&#x3D;aveeno+daily+cleansing+pads</li>
    <li> I have dry skin and do not like most of the face wash products in the market because they dry my skin. The Aveeno cleansing pads wash my face nicely without drying my skin and they are perfect for me. I also love the little bumps on the pads. I took the good advice from other customers and only use 1/2 of the pads ... save some money :)</li>
    <li> I had been using another brand that I can no longer get. I tried these through the subscribe and save program. The pad is amazing! I was able to take off all dirt and makeup as well as cleanse my skin. I have sensitive skin but this does not irritate it. I rinsed the pad and wiped off the residue and I was still removing makeup and dirt. Too bad there are only 28 instead of 30 to cover a whole month.</li>
    <li> This product is great! The Positively Radiant Aveeno products are all great. This one is better than great. The cleanser does a great job of removing oil, left over make up, and all without drying my skin. The pads have an exfoliating side that is wonderful - I&#x27;m over 50 but I&#x27;m told I have the skin of a much younger woman and I believe gentle, daily exfoliation is why. The other side is so soft, perfect for the delicate area around the eyes. There is plenty of product so that each pad does face and neck. I&#x27;ve used this product for years and will never use anything else for washing my face. Why change when this is ideal??</li>
    <li> I have bought these before from my local store and like them a lot. Your face feels really clean and refreshed after using these. They are a bit expensive, so I checked Amazon and found a good deal. I shared with my daughter and she likes them also.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many face washes, pads, scrubs you name it and this is by far my favorite. I&#x27;ve recently realized I&#x27;m allegic to something in most facial products so I&#x27;ve been trying a ton to figure out what works best on my skin. I tried the clearing complextion pads from Aveeno and while I didn&#x27;t have an allergic reaction to them, they did make my face break out. So I decided to give these a try and I&#x27;ve been using them for the past 2 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A tip for anyone buying these or using them. I usually find that I can cut them in half or into 4ths and they are plenty big enough to wash my face with. They last longer this way and they are never dried out when I finish the container.</li>
    <li> I like how my face feels after use, but it makes my skin dry so I must use moisturizer. I use this product 2 times daily and I think the pads are made way too big. I actually cut the pads in sixths and that&#x27;s really all you need for facial use.</li>
    <li> Speechless. This is my miracle cleanser. Cleared all pimple near my forehead area. And suitable for sensitive skin &amp;#60;3. Even my sister stole it from me XD and the pads are really big so I cut them into 4s. Scent is refreshing. Can I rate this 10 stars :)</li>
    <li> These are awesome to have on hand.  They suds up &amp; really do a great job at taking off makeup &amp; giving your skin a clean &amp; refreshed feeling.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I purchased this after a friend of mine recommended it.  I have very dry, sensitive skin so there aren&#x27;t many products that I really can use (even the so-called sensitive cleansers irritate and dry out my skin).  I didn&#x27;t have high hopes at all.&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions.  Wet my face, then washed with this.  It didn&#x27;t lather a ton, just a little bit.  The exfoliating bumps on one side were great.  Very gentle, but they actually felt like they were doing something.  I have never used a cleansing pad with exfoliators I actually liked.  This one is great.  The soft side is fine.  Nothing wondrous to report, nothing bad either though.&lt;br /&gt;After the first washing, I assessed my skin.  It left my skin a little tight (the only cleanser that doesn&#x27;t is CeraVe, so that&#x27;s not a surprise).  My face was noticeably very red after washing as well.  Typically, this is what happens to me and I wind up throwing away my cleansers right away.  I figured this was destined for the trashcan as well.  I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;The next morning, I went to wash my face, and I was shocked after looking in the mirror.  My skin was glowing.  I&#x27;m talking, that almost translucent, no one has skin this amazing, glowing.  I used it again, the following morning and night.  My skin protested.  I had dry patches in a few spots.  But I wasn&#x27;t willing to give up the glow I had after that first washing.  Now I&#x27;m using a gentler wash in the morning, and this at night.  My skin has never looked better.  I&#x27;ve completely given up foundation/tinted moisturizer.  I highly recommend this to anyone.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried this product b4 and I really like it! Now my 18 year old daughter loves it too and it helped clear her skin!</li>
    <li> Product was delivered very quick - my only issue is that you need to wash your face after you use the pad.  It&#x27;s very suddsy therefore you need to wash the suds off after you use the product.</li>
    <li> Amaizing i liked is so much</li>
    <li> I found that the Aveeno cleaning pads were quite refreshing.  They left my face feeling that chilled feeling after use.  They are scented with what I feel I can only described as the Aveeno smell- similar to their lotions, which is nice - not overpowering or perfumee.  The pads have a soft smooth side and a rougher side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros :&lt;br /&gt;-Not too harsh on the face -  I typically use St. Ives facial scrub but my skins been drier lately so I had to lay off - This does not cause my face to become overly dry.&lt;br /&gt;-The cleaning pads stay moist for long periods of time&lt;br /&gt;-Leaves your skin feeling smooth after the first use&lt;br /&gt;-A single pad contains enough cleanser to use 2x over&lt;br /&gt;-High quality buffing pad - Its very strong!  Like 4 layers of Bounty strong...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Huge container for the pads - there must be about 1 1/2 inches surrounding the wipes inside this container&lt;br /&gt;-Cleaning pads slightly too large - I felt like they could have made about 10 more pads with the 28 that are in the container.  They are about 2 inches wide and it felt a little \\&quot;bulky\\&quot; when cleaning my face.  I think I could cut the pads in half though and get twice as many uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall the actual results the product provide is worth the huge container and oversized cleaning pads because the bottom line is to have a clean, refreshed, smooth face and thats what the product delivers.  I would recommend this to others as a product to use.</li>
    <li> Not what I was expecting but it does get really really soapy</li>
    <li> I always come back to this.I usually buy in the store yet,since I have Amazon credit why not have it delivered.I have sensitive skin and this never fails.Love!!</li>
    <li> I bought these after reading an article in Consumer Reports.  I cannot say enough for how they cleanse and how gentle and thorough they are.  I think back to my decades-ago teen years and wish I had had them then!  For seniors with Alzheimer&#x27;s who like to pick at their skin they are also perfect, giving them nothing to pick at!  I highly recommend this above any and all soaps and all other cleansers I have ever tried.</li>
    <li> I really love this product. It makes your skin clean, smooth, and glowing. The pads are so big that I cut them in 1/2 and get twice as much product :)</li>
    <li> The product does what it is suppose to but they seem smaller to me. I use to be able to cut them in two to make the last longer but not anymore.</li>
    <li> The pads have cleansing skin soap and scrub side that does the job without tearing at your skin.  I use these to remove make up and to clean my skin even when make up is not used.  Other brands left my skin dry or feeling burned.  These truly left my skin &amp;#34;positively radiant&amp;#34;.  I recommended them to several friends and purchased more for my sister who has very sensitive skin.  Watta Deal!  Aveeno ..great price..great product</li>
    <li> These are perfect and gentle enough to use in place of facial scrubs. I cut these in half and use them once a week or so just as if I was using a facial scrub.</li>
    <li> I have seen a HUGE change in my facial skin in the last week, since I started using these pads! MY skin is more even, it&#x27;s smoother &amp; softer...my breakouts have even cleared up!! I cut the pads in half and use them in the evenings only, some days alternating with Aveeno Foaming Clear Complexion cleanser. In the mornings I use Aveeno Positively Radiant cream cleanser. I love the Aveeno line of products!</li>
    <li> I have been using these pads for quite some time now. I use the soft side of the pad and literally use them every day. If I run out and have to skip a day my face feels dirty. I love the softness and overall texture of my skin after using this product. I really hope they never discontinue them. A must have product and an awesome price!</li>
    <li> Works well and easy to use. Leaves you face feeling nice and clean. Pads are kind of too big but can be utilized more if cut in half</li>
    <li> I love these cleansing pads, they feel good and make your skin feel super clean and healthy.  My only complaint is the size-it is too big!  I usually cut them in half which makes them not round anymore and a little more difficult to use.  I wish they would make these about 3/4 of the size and add a few extra pads.</li>
    <li> Love these.  There is plenty of cleanser on the pads to be able to remove a face-full of makeup, even while rinsing the pad a bit in the process.  I personally can not use the scrubbing side of the pad because it is too harsh for my skin and causes breakouts.</li>
    <li> Love these! Always gets my face very clean without drying it out. Great price and excellent product. I never use anything else.</li>
    <li> I admit it.  Sometimes I just don&#x27;t feel like getting my face wet.  However, it is a pleasure to open this jar, grab a (thick enough) cleansing pad and rub my face.  Once I get that far, it is not so overwhelming to rinse my face in water.  People compliment me on my skin. Skin care is more important to me than makeup...this is handy and effective to remove both foundation and eye shadow (when I wear them).  At the very least I clean my skin and moisturize.  I&#x27;m in my sixties, but people thnk I&#x27;m in my forties (so they say).</li>
    <li> All the positive reviews are true, these cleansing pads are the best!  They get my face super clean, amazingly smooth, and remove makeup with drying my skin out.  I even use them to remove my eye makeup after all the suds rinse away.  I use these pads at night and a liquid Aveeno cleanser in the morning.  My face just does&#x27;t feel the same without them!</li>
    <li> I decided to try this product because of all the good reviews, despite the fact that I already own a Clarisonic for deep cleansing my face, &amp; I&#x27;m glad I did! These pads are very well constructed: the dotty side has just the right amount of abrasion to exfoliate my nose &amp; chin without irritation, &amp; the smooth side is gentle enough to clean my forehead/cheeks/eye area (I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s so I&#x27;m careful with these parts of my face as they are the ones prone to fine lines). The pads also lather up really well, rinse off easily, &amp; leave my skin feeling clean but not tight. Like several other reviewers, I also find that the pads are quite big, so I cut them in half. This means I get quite aot of mileage from one container: I use them every other morning, so at 56 halves, that&#x27;s about 3.5months! Not bad at all, considering one container is less than $6.</li>
    <li> Love these! So convenient! Exfoliates, and cleansing, removes make-up!</li>
    <li> I bought these thinking they were similar to makeup wipes, or oxipads, that you just wipe and go with.  Unfortunately, you need to rinse your face afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still like them though, they smell good, and I don&#x27;t only use them on my face.  I use them as &amp;#34;wipes&amp;#34; for my kiddos when they get dirt on their hands, or food on their face.  They work better than baby wipes!</li>
    <li> Great product. Cleanses as promised, no harsh ingredients and the scrubber side is effective. I continue with subscribe &amp; save and recommend highly.</li>
    <li> Great product!  The whole family uses it (including hubby and teenage sons).&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend for all types of skin.</li>
    <li> Great product. Love that is can help exfoliate your skin. I noticed a difference in my skin texture. It&#x27;s not horribly priced, but I still wish it was cheaper. The pads are super big, so I normally cut them into fours to get more use out of them. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I like the fact that the pads are so thick and can even be used twice but I&#x27;ve seen no major difference ,maybe its just my skin type</li>
    <li> Works great to exfoliate. Kind of tingled, which surprised me, but makes me feel like it&#x27;s working. Good buy. I highly recommend them!</li>
    <li> Very good cleans off makeup and leaves my skin feeling cleaner. I waited a couple months to write this review and I can say that dark spots on my face have lightened and my skin is looking clearer.</li>
    <li> I love this, my face loves it and I love it too. This is my only beauty secret along with a good diet and plenty of water.</li>
    <li> Although Aveeno is supposed to be great for sensitive skin, I sometimes find it a little harsh. These pads are good for a twice per week exfoliation, but if you use it two days in a row, you&#x27;ll feel some itching and tingling. I do like that each side has a different texture.</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s it.  No change, after 3weeks, in brown spots or wrinkles on my face.  I&#x27;m 42, and trying to undo some damage.  I didn&#x27;t expect miracles, but I expected to see an improvement.  There has been none...my face feels clean and soft...great...I can get that with other products that may actually do what they claim.  This was a waste of money I couldn&#x27;t afford to waste.  I have acne scars and brown splotches under my eyes.  I had hoped this product, along with the other positively ageless cleanser I bought to alternate it with, would help.  It didn&#x27;t.  Im glad it&#x27;s worked so well for everyone else.  Once I&#x27;m out, I&#x27;m switching to something else.</li>
    <li> I use this on my face and the shower and use the leftover to exfoliate my heals and elbows.  I really like it and have used very similar products with very large price tags.  This is just as good.</li>
    <li> They are a quite big so i cut them in half to get more use out of it. I would use this 2-3 times a week for the past couple of months and have not seen any improvement. If anything i broke out slightly more, nothing major. Not worth it my opinion.</li>
