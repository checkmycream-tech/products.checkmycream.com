### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great Price!</li>
      <li>Great Product!</li>
      <li>Nioxin 1 is great, but Nioxin 3 for color-treated hair is the best at conditioning and hydrating hair.</li>
      <li>Excellent Shampoo/Conditioner - purchasing in volume makes it more affordable than purchasing in a salon!</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s good product and I am satisfied</li>
      <li>Nice to find it at a great price and fast shipping.</li>
      <li>It seems to be able to almost heal any skin problem.  </li>
      <li>Without this product I would not be able to color my hair.  </li>
      <li>You&#x27;re never going to be able to find it for a better price than this either.  </li>
      <li>I have used this product for many years.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>I am using this product for many years and this tie I bought from this company</li>
      <li>Awesome product its a must use if you want full.healthy hair,have been using.it over 15 yrs,its actually pretty cheap as you get a gallon.lasts and lasts,very fast delivery and nicely.packaged</li>
      <li>Good value for the price and shipping was fast.  </li>
      <li>Received the gallon of Nioxin scalp therapy and it working fine.</li>
      <li>Free returns and easy refunds but still a pain...</li>
      <li>Great deal over buying locally!</li>
      <li>Scalp Therapy itself is great for my fine hair, it does not weigh my hair down like most conditioners and does not make it feel oily.</li>
      <li>I first bought this stuff from CVS (for much more money than what you pay here on Amazon by the way).  </li>
      <li>Love nioxin, so happy to be able to buy in bulk, buying at a salon is just too expensive</li>
      <li>I use this daily, this is the best price I have found, and they ship fast, and great with returns when I order the wrong thing.</li>
      <li>Fast Delivery!</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>I also use the Nioxin Scalp Treatment after getting out of the shower and my hair looks much fuller.  </li>
      <li>The bottles are packed really well, and I have never had one spill yet or break.</li>
      <li>I use the cleanser and scrub my hair gently, then rinse the cleanser out</li>
      <li>conclusion is that anyone who is wondering whether or not they should try Nioxin should absolutely go for it.  </li>
      <li>Gives plenty of body and very SOFT!</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t worry, it is normal and will eventually go away.  </li>
      <li>Nioxin shampoo and conditioner are great products if you have hair that is starting to thin a bit.  </li>
      <li>I was completely astonished when I started to see new hair growth all along the forehead area where I haven&#x27;t had any hair for years.  </li>
      <li>When I get out of the shower, I use the scalp Treatment and spray it directly on my scalp and then rub it in.  </li>
      <li>Exact same thing happened last year when I ordered cleanser, it changes to scalp therapy  </li>
      <li>The receding has not only completely stopped, but new hair is popping up all over the ex-receded hairline.  </li>
      <li>The shampoo (one gallon) will last you around 6 months and the conditioner (one gallon) will last you around 3 to 4 months, depending upon how much you use.  </li>
      <li>The shampoo will definitely last twice as long as the conditioner because it spreads and foams very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The first few times, you may experience a tingling all over your head.  </li>

<li> I even leave it in my hair everyday and just dry.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t use any other brand!</li>
<li> Well, that is not true for Nioxin.  </li>
<li> Unfortunately the quality of the NIOXIN products has gone down over the past couple of years due to the new ownership.  </li>
<li> Then, I use the Conditioner (Scalp Therapy) and massage it in to my head and let it sit for at least three minutes.  </li>
<li> The Scalp Treatment is the expensive part because it is sold in 10 ounce bottles (no large) for about $24 a bottle.  </li>

    <li> I have used the product for years, I love it, and a very good value in the gallon size</li>
    <li> Good deal. Would do business again.</li>
    <li> why i have no reciep Mỹ item yes?</li>
    <li> Love this product. Have used it for years</li>
    <li> Excellent Shampoo/Conditioner - purchasing in volume makes it more affordable than purchasing in a salon!</li>
    <li> Received the Cleanser twice not the Scalp Therapy. Free returns and easy refunds but still a pain... Scalp Therapy itself is great for my fine hair, it does not weigh my hair down like most conditioners and does not make it feel oily. Great product but still waiting to get the gallon size</li>
    <li> Nioxin shampoo and conditioner are great products if you have hair that is starting to thin a bit.  I also use the Nioxin Scalp Treatment after getting out of the shower and my hair looks much fuller.  You&#x27;re never going to be able to find it for a better price than this either.  I was paying around the same price for the 33.8oz bottle from the hair salon, so to get this gallon size container for about the same price is a no brainer.</li>
    <li> I am using this product for many years and this tie I bought from this company not only price was very good their service was excellent .</li>
    <li> You know how some things look good in a picture and when you get it you are disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;This will not disappoint you.</li>
    <li> As good as conditioner gets. I even leave it in my hair everyday and just dry. Gives plenty of body and very SOFT!</li>
    <li> Nioxin 1 is great, but Nioxin 3 for color-treated hair is the best at conditioning and hydrating hair.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years. I continue to use it and like it.&lt;br /&gt;Rod</li>
    <li> Love this!  I don&#x27;t use any other brand!</li>
    <li> Unclear by the product description that this is conditioner.</li>
    <li> I buy this buy the gallons because it is cheaper than buying it in the smaller bottles.  I just buy the pump separately and put the cleanser and conditioner in the shower.  It lasts a long time.  The bottles are packed really well, and I have never had one spill yet or break.</li>
    <li> I thought I ordered Cleanser and not scalp therapy. Exact same thing happened last year when I ordered cleanser, it changes to scalp therapy  and they sent out therapy. I didn&#x27;t even bother to send it back this year, I just reordered The Cleanser.</li>
    <li> Received the gallon of Nioxin scalp therapy and it working fine.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. It has made my hair grow thicker</li>
    <li> Wife loves this product.</li>
    <li> Good value for the price and shipping was fast.  Unfortunately the quality of the NIOXIN products has gone down over the past couple of years due to the new ownership.  It is a noticeable difference.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good product and I am satisfied</li>
    <li> Great value and my hair grows every day....it works!!!!</li>
    <li> Great deal over buying locally!</li>
    <li> Great Product! Great Price! Fast Delivery! Thanks!</li>
    <li> i have used nioxin for many years, excellent product</li>
    <li> I use this daily, this is the best price I have found, and they ship fast, and great with returns when I order the wrong thing.</li>
    <li> I first bought this stuff from CVS (for much more money than what you pay here on Amazon by the way).  At first, I figured i&#x27;d try it for a month with the hopes that it would maybe prevent further loss around the forehead which has been receding slowly for a decade now.  I was completely astonished when I started to see new hair growth all along the forehead area where I haven&#x27;t had any hair for years.  It has now been four months and my hair has doubled in thickness.  The receding has not only completely stopped, but new hair is popping up all over the ex-receded hairline.  Totally amazing.  I use it twice a day (morning and night).  I use the cleanser and scrub my hair gently, then rinse the cleanser out (it&#x27;s the shampoo).  Then, I use the Conditioner (Scalp Therapy) and massage it in to my head and let it sit for at least three minutes.  Then I rinse that out.  The first few times, you may experience a tingling all over your head.  Don&#x27;t worry, it is normal and will eventually go away.  After a couple of weeks, you will probably no longer feel that tingling sensation (dont know why, just the way it is).  When I get out of the shower, I use the scalp Treatment and spray it directly on my scalp and then rub it in.  The Scalp Treatment is the expensive part because it is sold in 10 ounce bottles (no large) for about $24 a bottle.  I wished I could buy that in a gallon bottle!  One 10 ounce will last you maybe 1 month.  The shampoo (one gallon) will last you around 6 months and the conditioner (one gallon) will last you around 3 to 4 months, depending upon how much you use.  The shampoo will definitely last twice as long as the conditioner because it spreads and foams very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My conclusion is that anyone who is wondering whether or not they should try Nioxin should absolutely go for it.  You have nothing to lose, and your hair to gain.  I wished I started years ago, but every time i read rogain bottles, it said that those types of products would not work on receding foreheads (only to be used on the middle of the head).  Well, that is not true for Nioxin.  It is awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!</li>
    <li> Awesome product its a must use if you want full.healthy hair,have been using.it over 15 yrs,its actually pretty cheap as you get a gallon.lasts and lasts,very fast delivery and nicely.packaged</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years. Nice to find it at a great price and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Love nioxin, so happy to be able to buy in bulk, buying at a salon is just too expensive</li>
    <li> When used according to directions, you cannot beat Nioxin products!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years because I have severe problems with eczema on my scalp and this product keeps it almost healed.  Without this product I would not be able to color my hair.  It seems to be able to almost heal any skin problem.  The only one that works for me is the product that is green and is the system 1.</li>
    <li> Delivered product on-time just as advertised.</li>
