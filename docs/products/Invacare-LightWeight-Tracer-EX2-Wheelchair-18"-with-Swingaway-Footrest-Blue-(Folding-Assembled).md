      <li>Very easy to load and unload in an SUV.</li>
      <li>Very easily handled.  </li>
      <li>The foot petals are also plastic and bend very easily.</li>
      <li>Then I looked at the name and model of old one and searched for it and found others agree it is a great chair!  </li>
      <li>Good clean and quality item</li>
      <li>Otherwise, this wheelchair is inexpensive and very comfortable.</li>
      <li>Invacare is brand we see most often in hospitals and clinic around here.</li>
      <li>was impressed that it was delivered in two days, but was only promised 7-10 days!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>, Assembled)&lt;br /&gt;The product is OK.</li>
      <li>Size, comfort and mobility of this product are all top notch</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s OK except the brakes no longer work.  </li>
      <li>So I was pleased with that</li>
      <li>This wheelchair is very well built, great quality.</li>
      <li>like to be able to get it in my car</li>
      <li>A pretty good chair for the price.</li>
      <li>Very good product and about 1/3 of the price they sell for at our local outlets.</li>
      <li>Just as described - high quality at a more than fair price.  </li>
      <li>It is sturdy and was easy to set up and easy to fold up to go into the trunk.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Wheelchair makers should have all settings easily adjustable, height from floor</li>
      <li>I needed an easy to handle, easy to fold light weight but strong wheel chair for my 90 year-old father.  </li>
      <li>It is easy to fold and is a fairly comfortable ride.  </li>
      <li>and it is  comfortable for the person using it</li>
      <li>So, make sure you get the right one.</li>
      <li>It gives her easily accessible seating that she can get in and out of comfortably from her walker.</li>
      <li>Quick delivery and worked out great for my Dad&#x27;s daily needs.</li>
      <li>This was a very reasonably priced wheelchair and the perfect size for the needs, it was an exact replacement of an older chair that was worn out and much cheaper than replacing the worn parts.</li>
      <li>But all functions well pretty easy to haul as it is a lighter weight one.  </li>
      <li>Vendor did a super job, arrived even before their estimate.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure this is a great product, since I&#x27;ve rented the very same one twice in the last 6 months.</li>
      <li>Wider version may be more comfortable for larger patients, plus wider version has longer arms.</li>
      <li>The size is right.</li>
      <li>That leaves you feeling like you are sitting right on the axel.</li>
      <li>It came right on time and well packaged.  </li>
      <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give a perfect rating was because the ad for this product I ordered and the picture says its all chrome and when the product arrived it was not chrome but a dark color.</li>
      <li>The problem is that the product was send out of the country and we do not have time to return the foot rest for exchange.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much</li>
      <li>The shipping was very fast also.</li>
      <li>We selected this company NOT because they had the lowest price for this item (they didn&#x27;t), but because the photo and item title were exactly the item we were looking for.  </li>
      <li>Their \\&quot;disclaimer\\&quot; means that they can send you pretty much anything they want to</li>
      <li>this wheelchair is user friendly, not too heavy or cumbersome to allow the person using it to get around easily</li>
      <li>suggest caution in dealing with Medical Department Stores, because you cannot rely on their photos or titles being accurate.  </li>
      <li>When we contacted Medical Department Stores, they informed us that the color and armrest features we ordered had changed and were no longer available.  </li>
      <li>I am really dissapointed in this chair.&lt;br</li>
      <li>And this is the very reason why we chose to purchase this product.</li>
      <li>They do not have the blue chair available.  </li>
      <li>Chair is built very well.  </li>
      <li>Reasonably priced.</li>
      <li>\\&quot;customer service\\&quot; was basically some disinterested people reading their scripts about why they weren&#x27;t legally required to do anything about the problem.  </li>
      <li>The product came in black as blue is no longer being manufactured, however the black is really cool with deco chrome; much more modern and elegant!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Bottom line, the Invacare wheelchair was OK and decent quality for the money, but not exactly what we ordered.  </li>
      <li>and I would highly recommend it to anyone needing one.</li>
      <li>Although it isn&#x27;t the best chair on the market, if you don&#x27;t need all the bells &amp; whistles (such as extra super light construction), this is a quality chair for everyday use around the house &amp; when compared to other chairs, it meets or exceeds the quality of much more expensive options.</li>
      <li>weight is also misleading, it is really heavy for most people to pick up even more so for the disabled.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve already had my father in it and tried pushing him on concrete, gravel and grass surface.  </li>
      <li>Put new brake handles on and deceided to keep it rather then repack and return.</li>
      <li>I live in it so it is useful.&lt;br /&gt;Would</li>
      <li>Moral of the story, know exactly what you want before buying online.</li>
      <li>Just be aware that if you send it back, you&#x27;ll have to pay for shipping plus a restocking fee.</li>
      <li>We had previously bought a slightly larger, heavier version and were well pleased.</li>
      <li>The chair arrived quickly, but was a different color and had a different armrest style than what was indicated in the photo and title.  </li>
      <li>so she stuck it in a room and continues using the old one.  </li>
      <li>I have nearly been tipped out forward because of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t really recommend this for everyone especially daily users.&lt;br</li>
      <li>choice.&lt;br /&gt;The seller was very helpful in helping me locate and purchase lost footrests for the 1996 unit that the nursing home where the relative resides lost.</li>
      <li>I had a 1996 Invacare Tracer that needed to be lent to a relative and we needed a new replacement for us.</li>
      <li>They did finally say that we could \\&quot;request\\&quot; a Return Authorization (not given automatically, as they would need to review the reason for the return), but reading through their Return policy showed that we would likely be responsible for the return shipping cost AND a 20%</li>
      <li>up and down is it - wouldn&#x27;t it be cool if the back could recline back a bit- or forward!</li>
      <li>I was surprised at how flat the chair became when I folded it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Medical Department Stores customer service informed us that there was a disclaimer in small print at the bottom of their ad that relieved them of any responsibility of making it right, even though they knew their photo and title were not correct and they hadn&#x27;t bothered to change them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Wheel chair works fine but the front wheel bearings are either poor quality or not properly lubed.  </li>

    <li> I needed an easy to handle, easy to fold light weight but strong wheel chair for my 90 year-old father.  I&#x27;ve already had my father in it and tried pushing him on concrete, gravel and grass surface.  It worked great.  I was surprised at how flat the chair became when I folded it.</li>
    <li> Very happy with wheelchair</li>
    <li> I live in it so it is useful.&lt;br /&gt;Would like to be able to get it in my car so I can shop.</li>
    <li> Heavier than my other chair.</li>
    <li> This wheelchair is very well built, great quality. It was delivered earlier than expected. I had to send it back because my mother needed a wider one. Just be aware that if you send it back, you&#x27;ll have to pay for shipping plus a restocking fee. So, make sure you get the right one. Otherwise, this wheelchair is inexpensive and very comfortable.</li>
    <li> This was a very reasonably priced wheelchair and the perfect size for the needs, it was an exact replacement of an older chair that was worn out and much cheaper than replacing the worn parts. The shipping was very fast also.</li>
    <li> two thumbs up for this wheelchair!  Size, comfort and mobility of this product are all top notch and I would highly recommend it to anyone needing one.</li>
    <li> Very good product and about 1/3 of the price they sell for at our local outlets.</li>
    <li> Outstanding quality, and great value at this price!&lt;br /&gt;I was impressed that it was delivered in two days, but was only promised 7-10 days!&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely do business with this company again.</li>
    <li> I am thoroughly disappointed with \\&quot;AMAZON\\&quot;,They have the same pictures even as in this review above,of the wheelchair as shown to me i.e,full arms rests.Accordingly I bought the chair as it was badly needed.The so called supplier,never heard of them before,sent a different chair.After so many complaints with the supplier &amp; with Amazon,I havnt got a good response.However,I have bought the full arms rest from some very good supplier,I therefore dont think I will get anything from Amazon again.They are acting ONLY as brokers.</li>
    <li> Just as described - high quality at a more than fair price.  Quick delivery and worked out great for my Dad&#x27;s daily needs.</li>
    <li> Good Deal, this is a good chair for the price! Although it isn&#x27;t the best chair on the market, if you don&#x27;t need all the bells &amp; whistles (such as extra super light construction), this is a quality chair for everyday use around the house &amp; when compared to other chairs, it meets or exceeds the quality of much more expensive options. I have no reservations in recommending this one, its kind of a no-brainer.</li>
    <li> It came right on time and well packaged.  I bought it for my mother who is recovering from a broken hip at age 87. It gives her easily accessible seating that she can get in and out of comfortably from her walker. She can use it to maneuver through the house and it fits nicely through doorways.  Good value for the price.</li>
    <li> Chair is built very well.  The size is right. The weight is something everyone should look at as this model is on the heavy side.</li>
    <li> The image they present is misleading.  They do not have the blue chair available.  Also the arm rests are different than represented.</li>
    <li> I cannot recommend Medical Department Stores after my recent disappointing experience buying an Invacare wheelchair.  We selected this company NOT because they had the lowest price for this item (they didn&#x27;t), but because the photo and item title were exactly the item we were looking for.  The chair arrived quickly, but was a different color and had a different armrest style than what was indicated in the photo and title.  When we contacted Medical Department Stores, they informed us that the color and armrest features we ordered had changed and were no longer available.  Checking with Invacare revealed that although the color HAD changed, they did still make the armrest style that we wanted (BOTH styles of armrests had recently been revised, but BOTH styles were still available).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Medical Department Stores customer service informed us that there was a disclaimer in small print at the bottom of their ad that relieved them of any responsibility of making it right, even though they knew their photo and title were not correct and they hadn&#x27;t bothered to change them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, the Invacare wheelchair was OK and decent quality for the money, but not exactly what we ordered.  Medical Department Stores \\&quot;customer service\\&quot; was basically some disinterested people reading their scripts about why they weren&#x27;t legally required to do anything about the problem.  They did finally say that we could \\&quot;request\\&quot; a Return Authorization (not given automatically, as they would need to review the reason for the return), but reading through their Return policy showed that we would likely be responsible for the return shipping cost AND a 20% re-stocking fee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest caution in dealing with Medical Department Stores, because you cannot rely on their photos or titles being accurate.  Their \\&quot;disclaimer\\&quot; means that they can send you pretty much anything they want to and you have very little recourse other than dealing with the hassle, expense, and re-stocking fees to return it.  I know that I will not be buying anything else from them.fees to return it.  I know that I will not be buying anything else from them.</li>
    <li> I received my Invacare LightWeight Tracer EX2 through insurance else where. As a person with a disability who depends upon their wheelchair daily. I am really dissapointed in this chair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it realy is not made to be sat in for any length of time. the seat is made out of thin vinyal. That leaves you feeling like you are sitting right on the axel. leading to backaches after sitting in it for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rims/handrails are plastic and they really ding up badly leaving sharp pieces of plastic in hands as you try to push yourself. The foot petals are also plastic and bend very easily. I have nearly been tipped out forward because of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is my opinion this is not really a wheelchair to aid in indopendece  for the user but  rather one for caregivers to use in aiding them in caring for someone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;light weight is also misleading, it is really heavy for most people to pick up even more so for the disabled. I wouldn&#x27;t really recommend this for everyone especially daily users.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** Note  invacare has added a small handle down by knee level this is not a feature on all tracer wheelchairs.</li>
    <li> I had a 1996 Invacare Tracer that needed to be lent to a relative and we needed a new replacement for us. The product came in black as blue is no longer being manufactured, however the black is really cool with deco chrome; much more modern and elegant! So I was pleased with that choice.&lt;br /&gt;The seller was very helpful in helping me locate and purchase lost footrests for the 1996 unit that the nursing home where the relative resides lost. I give the 5 star rating for the product as well as for the seller being over an above the call of duty in assisting my needs. Please note that Invacare Tracer is the only brand of wheelchair that I have ever seen at any of the VA Hospitals we have been to! If it works best for the VA to issue and to use in house, then rest assured it will be your best set of wheels if you need this type!</li>
    <li> We are HIGHLY satisfied for your AWESOME wheel chair and FAST shipping!  My mother had this chair and it was breaking down....terribly....  I got her another one locally but physically it felt so uncomfortable....just could not handle it so she stuck it in a room and continues using the old one.  Then I looked at the name and model of old one and searched for it and found others agree it is a great chair!  So I ordered it for your company.....because yours comes WITH the footrest....not sold separately like other companies who fool you with lower price only to find you have to ADD the footrests as extra!  We are so appreciative!</li>
    <li> the chair is constructed great just not what I wanted I wanted a blue chair and chair came in black will order again</li>
    <li> The wheelchair was everything it was advertised to be. Turned out it was a little wide for some of my doors. Returning it cost me a 25% restocking fee and $80.00 to ship it. I then purchased the 18&amp;#34; model which works wonderfully. Moral of the story, know exactly what you want before buying online.</li>
    <li> The chair is perfect and my Mother is comfortable. It comes assembled even though the description doesn&#x27;t indicate it is assembled . Happy rolling</li>
    <li> Since I had already read that it would come in black rather than the advertised blue I was not as disappointed as I might have been.  It is sturdy and was easy to set up and easy to fold up to go into the trunk.  It has been a lifesaver although I might have gotten one size smaller and saved some paint on my doorways.</li>
    <li> Arrived promptly and seems to be working well.  My husband made a pvc pipe extension for the brake handles because they were short and difficult to operate.  And there are no heel cups on the footrests so we are using footrests from a previous unit.  The chair is not blue, but that doesn&#x27;t matter.  It is easy to fold and is a fairly comfortable ride.  A pretty good chair for the price.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t come in blue like the picture shows!  A bit disappointed to receive black...  But all functions well pretty easy to haul as it is a lighter weight one.  Fits my mother well who is a short 5&#x27;2&amp;#34; ....</li>
    <li> arms cannot be turn around</li>
    <li> Good clean and quality item</li>
    <li> Met all expectations.  Very easily handled.  Portable.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK except the brakes no longer work.  So I ordered another chair from another company.</li>
    <li> Good quality for the money!</li>
    <li> Wheel chair works fine but the front wheel bearings are either poor quality or not properly lubed.  Have had to replace both sides.</li>
    <li> Not new obviously repaired. I took it to a qualified health service center. The tech said it should hold my husband&#x27;s 180# weight. Put new brake handles on and deceided to keep it rather then repack and return. We will see if the rewelded wheels will hold up if not my next purchase will be from a different company.</li>
    <li> Just what we were looking for.</li>
    <li> This is my second Tracer EX2</li>
    <li> This is swell made wheelchair. Unfortunately, we had to return it, as it was just not sized right. The arms were much to high for the intended user, and very uncomfortable for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wheelchair makers should have all settings easily adjustable, height from floor( this one had 2 options), height and length of armrests, adjustable backs for height and pitch(straight up and down is it - wouldn&#x27;t it be cool if the back could recline back a bit- or forward!</li>
    <li> Invacare LightWeight Tracer EX2 Wheelchair 18\\&quot; with Swingaway Footrest-Blue (Folding, Assembled)&lt;br /&gt;The product is OK. But I order the foot rest as shows the picture, and I received different ones, because the foot rest come in different shipment; also the color we request blue, but we received bray. The problem is that the product was send out of the country and we do not have time to return the foot rest for exchange.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure this is a great product, since I&#x27;ve rented the very same one twice in the last 6 months. And this is the very reason why we chose to purchase this product. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give a perfect rating was because the ad for this product I ordered and the picture says its all chrome and when the product arrived it was not chrome but a dark color. I didn&#x27;t bother returning or calling about this is because I just can&#x27;t deal with the return issues involved.</li>
    <li> this wheelchair is user friendly, not too heavy or cumbersome to allow the person using it to get around easily and it folds handily when not in use and it is  comfortable for the person using it</li>
    <li> While it&#x27;s not what you call lightweight, it is a quality product.</li>
    <li> This is a well designed chair and constructed with lightweight sturdy materials. Very easy to load and unload in an SUV. At 36 pounds, it might be a little awkward lifting from a car trunk. I haven&#x27;t tried---just speculating. Reasonably priced. A great alternative to the hassle involved in getting a Medicare rental. Some rentals are reconditioned used chairs.Attractive finish on the metal part.&lt;br /&gt;The physical therapist suggested using foot long 3/4 PVC pipe to extend brake handles. Perfect fit. PVC may be spray painted black to match the chair and not be conspicuous..</li>
    <li> Having used a rented wheelchair just like this one, it is just what we expected.  With the excellent price from Amazon, the cost will soon be covered through the eliminating of rental charges.</li>
    <li> We had previously bought a slightly larger, heavier version and were well pleased. Bought this one and gave it to elderly parents. Worked great, and passed through narrower residential doorways. Invacare is brand we see most often in hospitals and clinic around here. Wider version may be more comfortable for larger patients, plus wider version has longer arms. However, measure your doorways, the wider version may not pass thru.</li>
    <li> Vendor did a super job, arrived even before their estimate. Very good quality product at a fair price. I would recommend this product and this vendor to anyone.</li>
    <li> Great chair, from great seller !</li>
