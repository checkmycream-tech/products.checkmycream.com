      <li>Great hairspray!  </li>
      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>BEAUTIFUL!!!!</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t quite make it out, but it&#x27;s very pleasant.</li>
      <li>Good brand, recommended!</li>
      <li>Not too happy with results of using this....</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t eliminate all the frizz, but it does help a great deal.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Really nice product!</li>
      <li>, it has a pleasant not overpowering scent.  </li>
      <li>All in all a good product.</li>
      <li>This is a good hairspray that will help do away with frizzy, flyaway hair.  </li>
      <li>Good hairspray.  </li>
      <li>John Frieda Frizz Ease Keraflex Flexible Hold Hairspray is a good product.</li>
      <li>Good hairspray, it has what I consider a medium hold</li>
      <li>However this is a good product</li>
      <li>For me, it&#x27;s a good touchup spray, but not an all-day hold.</li>
      <li>When it&#x27;s humid, even the best hairspray (had to use tons) left my hair &amp;#34;sticky, semi-frizzy&amp;#34; at best.</li>
      <li>Did I mention that I LOVE this hairspray?!?</li>
      <li>I have hair that is super susceptible to frizz, so to have a hairspray that addresses this problem is ideal.</li>
      <li>It is very light yet provides good hold.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s absolutely amazing.</li>
      <li>I honestly believe that this helps with my frizz.</li>
      <li>I liked it both ways.</li>
      <li>The spray comes out nice and even, no complains.</li>
      <li>It has a pleasant smell that isn&#x27;t strong at all.</li>
      <li>This has a very light hold.</li>
      <li>The spray is very light.</li>
      <li>Another great feature, is that you&#x27;re able to use your flat iron even after the product is on your hair, which works out great if you have to retouch your ends.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The styling combs glide through nice and easy.</li>
      <li>I have always enjoyed John Frieda products and this is no exception.  </li>
      <li>I think a pump spray would be a better applicator for this, giving you more control and flexibility in how it&#x27;s used.</li>
      <li>I love this hairspray.</li>
      <li>I love a hairspray with a lovely scent; it&#x27;s like a bonus to me.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave my curls crunchy at all, but keeps them in for most of the day.</li>
      <li>It also does not have a smell that is too overwhelming</li>
      <li>It does give some shine, and being able to use it before or after styling is a bonus.</li>
      <li>This use to come in a pump spray and was much more concentrated and went where you sprayed it.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also a very large bottle for the price so a good value.</li>
      <li>To keep your style in place, you can easily use another more holding hairspray over this.</li>
      <li>I have been using L&#x27;Oreal Elnett for many years (before it was available in the US)</li>
      <li>--I wish I could adjust it to spray more lightly.</li>
      <li>Wow, what a great hairspray.</li>
      <li>The spray is very dispersive, but the hold is good and also flexible.  </li>
      <li>It is a good product since I really dislike sticky, glue like hairspray where you cannot even get your fingers in there to separate out the curls.  </li>
      <li>It would be good for a person who just wants to do their hair, and then spray all over to keep the moiture out, but not do any styling afterward, and does not demand a strong hold.</li>
      <li>I was excited to try this product, because I love John Frieda shampoo and conditioners.</li>
      <li>Easy to style even once applied.</li>
      <li>and I would easily buy it again.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell either which I like.</li>
      <li>However, it isn&#x27;t a terribly strong hold if that&#x27;s what someone is looking for.</li>
      <li>It has a flexible but strong hold.</li>
      <li>It does not  provide a strong hold either.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fine.  </li>
      <li>It has a good hold, but not stiff, sticky or crunchy.</li>
      <li>To be honest, I wasn&#x27;t expecting as much control from a &amp;#34;flexible hold&amp;#34; spray.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;After blow drying, I lightly spray my roots to ends.</li>
      <li>I would literally pay 4x the price for this fantastic hairspray.</li>
      <li>Thank you so much JF!!!</li>
      <li>I have used a lot of Frizz Ease products and usually love them, they really keep the frizz out.</li>
      <li>Overall, I thought the hairspray was good at the jobs it was marketed for: controlling frizz and allowing hair to maintain a softness and flexibility.</li>
      <li>This keeps my hair in place while also being nice and soft.  </li>
      <li>True to its claims</li>
      <li>Very good hairspray, holds shape well without being too stiff or sticky.  </li>
      <li>This hairspray has a really faint (but pleasant) smell, which is good for those who don&#x27;t want a strong odor or those who suffer from asthma or allergies.</li>
      <li>My normal routine is a leave in conditioner, mousse and a very light hairspray.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to help with static, which is one of my main reasons for needing hairspray at all on the stacked bob style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The reason for the 1 star deduction is that it sprays so much, so quickly</li>
      <li>It does a really good job of keeping those down and at bay, while still leaving your hair flexible and easy to manage.</li>
      <li>My hair is very fine and soft and flyaway.  </li>
      <li>I kept touching my hair all day and it remained soft, nonsticky, and nonfrizzy.</li>
      <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s a really good product</li>
      <li>right what a joke!.This stuff will never hold my hair.</li>
      <li>a litlte right after applying the spray.</li>
      <li>I love the product, but I wish there was a little more control to the force of which it can be applied.</li>
      <li>like that it is not heavy or sticky, and I can easily comb through it.</li>
      <li>It comes out in a very fine mist and it can be used as a pre-styling tool spray (I tried it with the flat iron).</li>
      <li>Note that they don&#x27;t claim to be natural, it utilizes a combination of polymers, with a fine mist spray.</li>
      <li>Unless I get a keratin blowout or a good flat iron, my hair doesn&#x27;t lay smooth for long without some type of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This spray is particularly helpful in the winter months when dry heat normally causes my fine hair to become full of static.  </li>
      <li>Love how it holds the hair, and you can still comb through it and re spray when necessary.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t  have that &amp;#34;hairspray&amp;#34; small, just a nice light scent.</li>
      <li>It continues to work the next day without having to add more spray.  </li>
      <li>I like this hairspray and will be purchasing more in the future and looking for the additional items in the John Frieda</li>
      <li>so you can still brush out and restyle your hair after using it without first making a trip to the shower to wash the spray out.  </li>
      <li>The Frizz Ease Keraflex not only controls frizz, but also problematic static.  </li>
      <li>Gives a hold that is lighter than I am used to for my long hair but did nicely to hold my natural waves when I sprayed it on my damp hair and scrunched.</li>
      <li>It is, however, an awesome choice when you want to control some frizz, especially those little short frizzy hairs that can take over around your hairline.</li>
      <li>It goes on SO light but provides a great protection against the heat and provides hold without leaving any sticky residue or making it difficult to comb my fingers through after curling to create a soft wave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>have been using the hairspray for the last few days, and while it won&#x27;t take the place of hair mousse, it is certainly a great addition to my hair care products to hold my style.</li>
      <li>That being said, I did really like the John Frieda</li>
      <li>Overall I&#x27;m happy with this product and would definitely purchase this in the future.</li>
      <li>This John Frieda spray works very well in this regard.</li>
      <li>I hesitated to try this hairspray because it isnt cheap, but then I saw that JFwas offering a money back guarantee</li>
      <li>I spray this lightly over my hair and it definitely held my style.</li>
      <li>However, if I were looking for a more &amp;#34;finished&amp;#34; look instead of soft beachy waves, this would definitely accomplish that too.</li>
      <li>spray some of this directly on a stubborn cowlick that is right at my temple.</li>
      <li>You get better coverage with this spray than with other squirt spray bottles.</li>
      <li>Because of this flexibility it does not have a super strong hold but it also does not leave hair stiff and brittle.  </li>
      <li>The hold is decent, but too crunchy and leaves too much residue.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> As someone naturally curly hair I can&#x27;t get away without using product in my hair. My normal routine is a leave in conditioner, mousse and a very light hairspray. When it comes to hairspray I prefer something that doesn&#x27;t leave my hair stiff, cause frizziness and allows my curls to move freely. This product meets up to all of those requirements and it doesn&#x27;t excessively dry my hair out. And although it is a bit spendy the size is quite large and should last for some time. Overall I&#x27;m happy with this product and would definitely purchase this in the future.</li>
    <li> The aerosol flies all over the room!  What a mess.  What does get on my hair isn&#x27;t just &amp;#34;flexible&amp;#34;...it&#x27;s non-existant.  This use to come in a pump spray and was much more concentrated and went where you sprayed it.  Will not order again.</li>
    <li> I have always been a big fan of John Frieda products and this hair spray is no exception. The spray is a very firm yet flexible hold my style all day. The spray comes out nice and even, no complains. This product will be on my purchase list.</li>
    <li> I honestly believe that this helps with my frizz. Since I have naturally curly hair I have frizz, its a way of life. I have learned to accept it. However, this hairspray helps to tame my hair. This doesn&#x27;t give me white flakes in my hair and it doesn&#x27;t look greasy or give me that &amp;#34;build up&amp;#34; look of hairspray. You know when your hair looks like a helmet, and its shinny from all the products you have used? Well, that doesn&#x27;t happen with this hairspray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I do like this one I noticed that my curls tend to sag, droop, are not as bouncy at the end of the day. I think I will invest in the stronger hold hair spray next time, hoping this elevates the problem. I have loose curls and not tight ringlets, so I am unsure if that is one reason why my curls look droopy at the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either way, I do like this product and I think it does tame the frizz. It doesn&#x27;t eliminate all the frizz, but it does help a great deal.</li>
    <li> To be honest, I wasn&#x27;t expecting as much control from a &amp;#34;flexible hold&amp;#34; spray.  True to its claims, the Frizz Ease Keraflex provides a reliable hold to your style while still allowing you to comb through with ease.  You will notice that the spray adds a definite texture to your hair, making it easier to manage.  Yet, unlike competitors, you will NOT notice any white residue or dulling after your comb-through. This spray is particularly helpful in the winter months when dry heat normally causes my fine hair to become full of static.  The Frizz Ease Keraflex not only controls frizz, but also problematic static.  My only negative comment is the force at which the spray comes out of the can.  The spray come out with enough force to actually move your hair where it is being applied.  There is not really enough control with the application to allow you to apply a lighter amount of product to areas of your style such a softer, shorter bang.  I love the product, but I wish there was a little more control to the force of which it can be applied.</li>
    <li> The hair spray works as expected for this price point. Note that they don&#x27;t claim to be natural, it utilizes a combination of polymers, with a fine mist spray. Easy to use, no sticky icky stuff, no frizz, tried with moist hair and then used hair styling iron - no problems, on dry hair no problems. Hair held up fine during a typical work day in office. The styling combs glide through nice and easy. Good brand, recommended!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not much of a hair spray person as I don&#x27;t like, \\&quot;crunchy\\&quot; hair. So when I do need to use hair spray I want a flexible hold one. This John Frieda spray works very well in this regard. It doesn&#x27;t leave my curls crunchy at all, but keeps them in for most of the day. It doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell either which I like. It&#x27;s also a very large bottle for the price so a good value.</li>
    <li> I have used the product several times since it arrived.  It works as promised if you follow the directions when styling your hair using a heated curling iron or any other heat producing product.  It continues to work the next day without having to add more spray.  It is a very large can so should last a long time.</li>
    <li> Great hairspray!  Love how it holds the hair, and you can still comb through it and re spray when necessary.  I have light and thin hair down to my shoulders, but this hairspray does not weigh it down.</li>
    <li> I have been using L&#x27;Oreal Elnett for many years (before it was available in the US) so I&#x27;m partial to that product. That being said, I did really like the John Frieda Frizz Ease Keraflex Flexible Hold hairspray&#x27;s hold and the way it felt once on my hair; very similar to Elnett. It has a good hold, but not stiff, sticky or crunchy. Easy to style even once applied. The reason for the 1 star deduction is that it sprays so much, so quickly--I wish I could adjust it to spray more lightly. Other than that, it&#x27;s a really good product and I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> This has a very light hold. It has a pleasant smell that isn&#x27;t strong at all. It comes out in a very fine mist and it can be used as a pre-styling tool spray (I tried it with the flat iron). It doesn&#x27;t seem to help with static, which is one of my main reasons for needing hairspray at all on the stacked bob style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it is not heavy or sticky, and I can easily comb through it. However, it isn&#x27;t a terribly strong hold if that&#x27;s what someone is looking for. It does give some shine, and being able to use it before or after styling is a bonus. For me, it&#x27;s a good touchup spray, but not an all-day hold.</li>
    <li> Not too happy with results of using this.... Did not expect it to not have some holding power... May work some on frizz but need to follow up with a hair spray to give it holding firmness. My hair is very fine and soft and flyaway.  Was hoping Frizz ease would do both for me..</li>
    <li> I have always enjoyed John Frieda products and this is no exception.  The spray is very dispersive, but the hold is good and also flexible.  You get better coverage with this spray than with other squirt spray bottles.</li>
    <li> I hesitated to try this hairspray because it isnt cheap, but then I saw that JFwas offering a money back guarantee so what did I have to lose! This is the BEST hairspray I&#x27;ve ever used!!  I&#x27;m not exaggerating at all when I say I&#x27;ve tried hundreds of hairsprays. I have fine, frizzy hair that is somewhat manageable when the humidity is low but crazy frizzy when there is any moisture in the air at all. When it&#x27;s humid, even the best hairspray (had to use tons) left my hair &amp;#34;sticky, semi-frizzy&amp;#34; at best. I decided to give JF a try on a day when I wasn&#x27;t working and it was 85 degrees and 60% humidity. First of all, there was hardly any smell at all and my hair was totally soft to the touch after I sprayed it. No helmet head! I was thinking, yeah right what a joke!.This stuff will never hold my hair. I then went out in the soupy weather and expected an instant afro. OMG my hair stayed exactly the same as when I sprayed it. I kept touching my hair all day and it remained soft, nonsticky, and nonfrizzy. WTH? Not sure what this stuff is made of but it&#x27;s absolutely amazing. I would literally pay 4x the price for this fantastic hairspray. Thank you so much JF!!! Did I mention that I LOVE this hairspray?!?</li>
    <li> Hair stays soft and in place at the same time. I have thick, straight Asian hair.</li>
    <li> This is a good hairspray that will help do away with frizzy, flyaway hair.  It is \\&quot;flexible\\&quot; so you can still brush out and restyle your hair after using it without first making a trip to the shower to wash the spray out.  Because of this flexibility it does not have a super strong hold but it also does not leave hair stiff and brittle.  This product is close to odorless and any small chemical scent it possibly has is not unpleasant and quickly become unnoticeable soon after spraying.  Apparently John Frieda now offers a whole line of anti frizz products that uses some \\&quot;magic\\&quot; chemical potion utilizing polymers to battle hair frizz and aid seriously damaged hair or just split ends and flyaways.    I like this hairspray and will be purchasing more in the future and looking for the additional items in the John Frieda frizz ease line of products.</li>
    <li> Gives a hold that is lighter than I am used to for my long hair but did nicely to hold my natural waves when I sprayed it on my damp hair and scrunched. Doesn&#x27;t  have that &amp;#34;hairspray&amp;#34; small, just a nice light scent.</li>
    <li> Very good hairspray, holds shape well without being too stiff or sticky.  No overwhelming hairspray odor.  All in all a good product.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair.  If I blow dry it, it gets frizzy.  In the winter, going out with wet hair is not fun and allowing it to air dry isn&#x27;t always possible.  On those occasions, this has SAVED me!  I used to throw it in a ponytail to hide the frizz. Not anymore!  Now I spray it with this John Frieda Frizz Ease and sculpt it a bit with my hands/fingers.  BEAUTIFUL!!!!</li>
    <li> Holds your hair in place, yet you don&#x27;t have that &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; hair feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Light scent.  No &amp;#34;fogger&amp;#34; when you use the spray bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And again, at the end of the day when you finally get home and run a brush through your&lt;br /&gt;hair, you aren&#x27;t pulling your hair out due to the hair being &amp;#34;glued&amp;#34; together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really nice product!</li>
    <li> Wow, what a great hairspray. It is very light yet provides good hold. I did not find it has an odor, as others have indicated on their reviews. I have hair that is super susceptible to frizz, so to have a hairspray that addresses this problem is ideal.</li>
    <li> I have used a lot of Frizz Ease products and usually love them, they really keep the frizz out. This hair spray keeps down the frizz, but it goes on really dry. I prefer a spray that goes on a little more damp, so i can position my hair a litlte right after applying the spray. This spray is a dry mist, so it cant really be used the way I like. It does not  provide a strong hold either. The spray is very light. It would be good for a person who just wants to do their hair, and then spray all over to keep the moiture out, but not do any styling afterward, and does not demand a strong hold.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fine.  I&#x27;ll use it up, but it&#x27;s not anything I&#x27;ll go out of my way to buy.  I love a hairspray with a lovely scent; it&#x27;s like a bonus to me.  If you like unscented hairspray, I can tell you that I don&#x27;t notice any smell at all, once the chemical hairspray smell has dissipated.  That may be a bonus for some of you.  As for combing?  I don&#x27;t notice any difference at all between this product and any other drugstore hairspray.</li>
    <li> Works quite well.  I&#x27;m not a huge lover of hairspray because it always feels too sticky to me.  This product has a less sticky feel but still held my hair in place.  I have curly hair and it helped tame my frizzies down in my ponytail.  It also does not have a smell that is too overwhelming</li>
    <li> Holds my curly hair without stiffness.  It is a good product since I really dislike sticky, glue like hairspray where you cannot even get your fingers in there to separate out the curls.  This keeps my hair in place while also being nice and soft.  A little goes a long way.  You can use a curling iron with this hairspray but I found using a round brush and the spray to work very well on my bangs.</li>
    <li> Rating this 4 stars, because it&#x27;s &#x27;winter&#x27; here in the South, and very low humidity. I have frizzy, curly long hair and my go to hairstyle is a bun or a long braid. Unless I get a keratin blowout or a good flat iron, my hair doesn&#x27;t lay smooth for long without some type of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the hairspray for the last few days, and while it won&#x27;t take the place of hair mousse, it is certainly a great addition to my hair care products to hold my style. The main thing I like, is that there are no flakes, even though I use a lot of hairspray. Another great feature, is that you&#x27;re able to use your flat iron even after the product is on your hair, which works out great if you have to retouch your ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the scent of the hairspray is faint, so spritz away!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ETA: You use this product on dry hair only!</li>
    <li> this has a very odd smell to it. I can&#x27;t quite make it out, but it&#x27;s very pleasant. It sprays really hard and fast, so make sure to hold it WAY back from your face. I mean, the spray is so strong it actually blows my hair out of place. The hold is decent, but too crunchy and leaves too much residue.</li>
    <li> I put my hair up almost every day for work, so I go through a LOT of hairspray! I was excited to try this product, because I love John Frieda shampoo and conditioners. This hairspray has a really faint (but pleasant) smell, which is good for those who don&#x27;t want a strong odor or those who suffer from asthma or allergies. This hairspray is intended to help control frizz and maintain a &amp;#34;flexible&amp;#34; hold: meaning that it doesn&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re wearing a helmet on your head! Overall, I thought the hairspray was good at the jobs it was marketed for: controlling frizz and allowing hair to maintain a softness and flexibility. Personally, for the updos I wear to work and the gym, I need a hairspray that has really firm hold. I don&#x27;t want my hair falling down halfway through a business meeting or a gym class. I would recommend this hairspray for hairstyles that need frizz control and a touch of hold. However, if you are looking for hairspray that will hold your style in place for 8+ hours, this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
    <li> I love this hairspray. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair stiff or sticky, it holds well and still feels soft. Great product!</li>
    <li> I typically flat iron or use a curling wand on my hair at least 5 days a week, and this product has been a GREAT addition to my routine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After blow drying, I lightly spray my roots to ends. It gives the roots a little lift and provides texture to hold the styling. It goes on SO light but provides a great protection against the heat and provides hold without leaving any sticky residue or making it difficult to comb my fingers through after curling to create a soft wave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t even needed to give a second spray after I&#x27;ve finished styling because the initial spray for texture and volume also provides hold throughout the day! However, if I were looking for a more &amp;#34;finished&amp;#34; look instead of soft beachy waves, this would definitely accomplish that too.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t a hairspray to use when you don&#x27;t want your style to undo itself. It is, however, an awesome choice when you want to control some frizz, especially those little short frizzy hairs that can take over around your hairline. It does a really good job of keeping those down and at bay, while still leaving your hair flexible and easy to manage. You can even brush through it, and not lose the less frizz effect of this product. To keep your style in place, you can easily use another more holding hairspray over this. My main complaint with this is the fact it comes out at a pretty powerful rate, and you can&#x27;t really be that precise about how much you spray on your hair. I think a pump spray would be a better applicator for this, giving you more control and flexibility in how it&#x27;s used. But apart from that, I really like this product and am so pleasantly surprised.</li>
    <li> Good hairspray, it has what I consider a medium hold and it is flexible as the name and description state.  I like it, it has a pleasant not overpowering scent.  As for Frizz Ease, I didn&#x27;t find that it did this as well as I hoped. However this is a good product and I would easily buy it again.</li>
    <li> John Frieda Frizz Ease Keraflex Flexible Hold Hairspray is a good product. It has a flexible but strong hold. I spray this lightly over my hair and it definitely held my style. Plus, I could still run a comb through it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spray some of this directly on a stubborn cowlick that is right at my temple. While it needed a good, direct blast, this product was able to calm down my crazy cowlick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t saw how well this product handles humidity. It&#x27;s dry and cold here but, based on how it&#x27;s handled everything else, I have high hopes for the summer.</li>
    <li> John Frieda Frizz Ease Keraflex Flexible Hold Hair Spray.  Good hairspray.  My hair is black and very curly, hold was good with no white flakes on my dark hair, and you could touch it and it was not hard.  Its not hot right now, but help pretty well while at the gym.  I will buy again. I used this hairspray both while blow dried into loose waves and naturally curly. I liked it both ways.</li>
