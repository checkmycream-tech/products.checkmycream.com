    <li> I was thrilled to pieces when I found this on Amazon. I am so glad I didn&#x27;t spend the 500 on the &amp;#34;Clear Cube&amp;#34;. This is the exact same thing (literally) for a fraction of the cost. Great quality product worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I LOVE my make up organizer.It looks nice sitting on my bathroom counter!&lt;br /&gt;Best of all...I&#x27;m organized!&lt;br /&gt;I do my make up in record time now because I know where all my products are.</li>
    <li> I love this item. It fits all of my beauty items. Great quality, very sturdy, very chi. I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Got this last month and it was so nicely packaged. I did not find one scratch. This is worth the price. I find it really elegant and it is huge! I thought the product would be cheap looking but I was wrong it is very sturdy and well put together. No assembly needed. You should buy it.</li>
    <li> Amazing and absolutely perfect! Well packed, worth every penny and exactly like the one Kim Kardashian owns! To the T! You can find how amazing it looks with all the makeup on my Instagram account @samirivera Happy Buying everyone! I highly recommend this as I have searched years on end for the original and feel for the price I paid on this item it was well the investment and price, would buy another one of my makeup gets out of hand lol!</li>
    <li> I waited a while to order this product because of the price and I wanted to make sure I was getting the best quality item available.  I could not be more pleased and wish I had ordered it sooner.  The product came quickly, wrapped securely and in excellent condition.  This product is well made, sturdy and fits an amazing amount of makeup products.  I highly recommend this beauty cube!!</li>
    <li> This organizer was delivered within days of order and arrived in excellent condition.  It was packed very well.  The item is quite heavy and is obviously made of acrylic and not plastic.  Perfect for make-up organization; the divider inserts are great (make sure to remove the saran type film from them before placing in the drawers).  More beautiful than expected!</li>
    <li> I just received my Beauti Cube today and its gorgeous!! And BIG!!! I can&#x27;t wait to organize my Makeup in it. Unfortunately one of the drawers is chipped, and the bottom drawer won&#x27;t open. Im sending it back but will reorder again.</li>
    <li> Best purchase of this year.  Holds everything!  Only down side, some of the dividers were too long to work.  However, I did not need them.</li>
    <li> It is beautiful and so useful. I love being able to find everything I need in the morning. I use it for makeup, makeup brushes, hair clips and ties. It is truly awesome...CAN NOT say enough!!!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this cube.  I just love it.  I am a makeup junkie so now all my items are in the cube and it makes for easy access.  Love Love it.</li>
    <li> This really is a nice, sturdy acrylic make up cube.  I looked at the more expensive cubes, and couldn&#x27;t see the value for twice the price.  It looks beautiful and arrived in 2 days with no scratches or marks in the acrylic.  I chose this one vs. other similiarly priced cubes for 2 reasons:  it included dividers (a must for true organization) and it had a closing lid.  I didn&#x27;t want an open top because of how dusty my room gets and didn&#x27;t want dust in my stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t give this 5 stars because I am now wishing the top was another drawer vs. a lid because this thing is so tall, I can&#x27;t access the stuff in the top when I&#x27;m sitting down at my make up table (and I am 5&#x27;10&amp;#34;).  Then I was hoping I could put nail polish in the top - but the bottles are too tall (the top is the same depth as the drawers).  So, I&#x27;ve repurposed the top by storing bangle bracelets instead of makeup - which I needed the space for anyway so no loss in the end.  Doing that still left me with more than enough room for all my makeup - including several large eye shadow pallets.  Also, the lid has no handle - why not??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite my lid issues, I really would recommend this as a great cube for someone looking for a professional way to organize/display your makeup who wouldn&#x27;t be satisfied with a flimsy, cheap cube.  I really am happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Within 8 months and only gentle use, three of the drawer pulls have fallen off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: Upon repairing the pulls today I discovered that several of the joints between the sides, front, and bottoms are coming apart.</li>
    <li> I really do love it, I just wish the dividers were worked better, i love how i can see all my make up!</li>
    <li> This is exactly as expected! I love how organized I am now with my makeup! Definately a great buy for what I needed it for!</li>
    <li> Fits everything of mine and is stylish and very sturdy. I didn&#x27;t know if I should order based on others negative feedback but I took a chance and SOO glad that I did! LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Love This make up organizer. Its made of great thick acrylic and holds so much product. Its a great buy. Came very fast two day delivery. The package was secured and wrapped well. Great buy worth the money.</li>
    <li> While this is invariably expensive for something that is just going to store other expensive things, the unit itself is great. It solves disorganization, allows for better visualization and use of makeup/beauty items, and makes your makeup collection look like a kind of art piece, if clear acrylic containers full of organized stuff is your kind of thing. It has a strong chemical, acrylic kind of smell, one that hasn&#x27;t really faded in almost a year, but that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s made of, so it&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
    <li> One of my drawers came cracked! Contact me the piece overall is nice but I&#x27;m not happy about this cracked drawer.</li>
    <li> I WISH THEY WERE A BIT THICKER BUT THEY ARE WELL MADE AND VERY USEFUL FOR ORGANIZING</li>
    <li> Took several weeks researching all of the make up organizers. Finally when I made up my mind, it was out of stock!! But, I never gave up. When it became available I bought it. The Beauti cube is very nice. I am extremely impressed.  Reasonably priced as well.  Under $200.I feel like a Beverley Hills movie star!!! Highly recommend as top of the line.</li>
    <li> Love this makeup case! It is perfect!! Fits everything, looks great. I am so pleased!! Will never buy another makeup case!</li>
    <li> LOVE!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know this is expensive, but it is very well worth the money. Amazing organizer &amp; beautiful to look at. I tried to substitute using other organizers, cheaper acrylic drawers piled on top of each other) but was never happy with the result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This SAVES you from cluttering up your bathroom, vanity, etc and is beautiful to look at.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the price is bothering you I would highly suggest to just save up for a while (which is what I did) and then purchase - you won&#x27;t regret it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m calling it a splurge but the longer I have this the more I think it may actually be a necessity; def. one of those things you wonder how you ever lived without.</li>
    <li> I love it so much, I now have two.  One on each side of my dresser. Well made, great quality.</li>
    <li> i love this! i just got it, and it was very well packaged. i love this better than the high costing one I&#x27;ve seen. loving the price too</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Nice quality&lt;br /&gt;Size&lt;br /&gt;Look&lt;br /&gt;Very useful&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Dividers that came with do not fit that well&lt;br /&gt;The x dividers to me were a waste takes up precious space!</li>
    <li> Got this for my fiance for xmas.  She has a LOT of makeup and this was something I caught her eyeing (well to be fair she was eyeing the $400 lucite ones which i can&#x27;t afford).  Anyway, she uses this every day and told me she loves it and all at a cost FAR cheaper than the &amp;#34;celebrity&amp;#34; brand which btw has the exact, if not almost exact, dimensions!</li>
    <li> I was so excited to receive my makeup organizer.  When I finally received my package I opened the box which the makeup organizer was boxed really well. As I took it out there was a huge Crack on the side of it. And the lid was super glued. So I couldn&#x27;t even open it! I&#x27;m very unhappy . Besides that it would of been perfect ! I would of gave it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Very clear acrylic, only slightly off colored, but not really noticeable. Thick, good quality. Came cracked on one drawer, impossible to find a way to contact shipper or company so no way to have this issue taken care of. For the price, thats not acceptable. Otherwise good buy.</li>
    <li> product size was amazing. Thought I had too much makeup and realized with all the extra space i still had I need more. One of the shelves first came cracked but after calling the company I ordered from, RDI, they replaced the shelf with no problem! I love this product and would recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> All my makeup, nail polish fits perfectly. It&#x27;s really nice.</li>
    <li> This product was exactly what I was looking for. I wish the drawers were just a little deeper, but that&#x27;s not enough to make me unsatisfied with this purchase. I am over the moon with how this looks on the counter as well as what it holds. My favorite purchase as of late!! Arrived on time and in once piece.</li>
    <li> Came a little broken but not very noticeable, I was too last to send it back and wait for a new one. Don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth 160$, it&#x27;s great quality but ain&#x27;t worth the money!</li>
    <li> Great gift that my girlfriend actually loved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth all the money.</li>
    <li> Quality of cube is excellent the acrylic is thick and sturdy and it was packaged well by the seller I am glad I purchased it holds all my make up items.</li>
    <li> i had makeup cluttering my tiny sink area in my tiny bathroom … just piling up making me cringe!  i ordered this and it is huge!  fortunately i was able to put it over to the side of my sink and put everything in with a lot of room to spare!  it is beautiful and now that all my makeup is inside my tiny basin area looks clutter-free, bigger, and beautiful!  i just love it!</li>
    <li> This is a great product and such a space saver.  I love being able to see all my makeup and brushes, lotions, etc..in one place.  However, when I got the organizer one of the lid hinges was cracked &amp; is broken.  The lid still opens &amp; closes, so I&#x27;m not going to return it.  I would suggest something other than acrylic hinges.  It wouldn&#x27;t look too bad if the hinge were a chrome plated silver or something.  I belive that all customers want a sound, solid product.  Additionally, the squeeking when opening and closing the lid is like nails on a chalkboard...terrible!  That would also be solved if a traditional lid hinge was used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the piece is very nice and looks great on my bathroom counter.</li>
    <li> This came with two broken acrylic sliding rails and so the drawers didn&#x27;t work and the drawer divider came broken. I contacted the company directly and they were very accommodating and sent me a whole new case the next week. I am very happy with my product now. It has a great amount of storage for all my beauty good and looks great. Good value for the price.</li>
    <li> I bought my clear cube organizer about two years ago and even featured it on my blog. In general I have been pleased but I also had trouble with the handles. I have had three break off over the past two years. As they break my husband is replacing them with a clear acrylic knob that we are drilling trough the plastic to attach like traditional hardware. I wish they had done this from the beginning.</li>
    <li> Just got mine today ... Little expensive, but OMG way worth it!  Got all my stuff in it, so didn&#x27;t realize how much stuff I really had.  That reason alone ...worth the price... packed VERY well and the inserts fit very well.</li>
    <li> I love the organizer but drawer handles comes off. It is something that can be superglued back but inconvenient.</li>
    <li> Definitely for the girlie girl! Beautifully made organizer! Heavy, sturdy, and super clear acrylic. The organizer came nicely packed w heavy duty styrofoam encasing it and double sided plastic to prevent any scratches. I love how it came w 4 sets of drawer inserts: 2 X and 2 H...they fit well inside the drawers...just right, not too snug which I like because I didn&#x27;t want it to scratch the inside acrylic. The drawers slide in and out really well and don&#x27;t get stuck as you pull them out. I agree it is a bit pricey, but not as pricey as the actual Kardashian cube...@ $500 (incl shipping) I couldn&#x27;t bring myself to pay that much for acrylic! LOVE how it looks on my bathroom counter/vanity area!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s perfect! Easy to assemble and (so far) sturdy.</li>
    <li> My make-up organizer arrived and it was packed very well, so nothing came shipped broken. It was already put together, so all I had to do was add my dividers. It holds all my make- up and more! Before I had my make-up and back up make-up in about 6 different bags.... I could never see what I had, so mostly just used a few. Now I can see everything... All my lip glosses, lipsticks, eye shadows, etc. It&#x27;s great and I love the fact I can see everything to choose from with the organization it provides. My husband also likes the fact that he has more counter space because its so convenient to put away and keep organized. Great purchase, speedy delivery and loving my new organizer! Just like the one on the Kardashians show, but priced right! Highly recommend this product for its durability, storage and price :-)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m loving my acrylic cube. the quality is great and the size is perfect. it&#x27;s worth every penny. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> .... My love for this item. Really. The quality was amazing.. I was afraid it would arrive damaged so I over-nighted it... So so happy.. Ordering another soon... Please put up double drawer one though!! And thank you!!:)</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter and she absolutely loves it! Everything is right where she wants it and exactly what she wanted!</li>
    <li> Love, love, love my beauty cube!!!! Has made my life so much more organized &amp; has reduce the time it use to take me to get ready too! The only downside is that the second drawer from the bottom had a chipped off corner which fell off when I was unwrapping it. Looks fabulous in my dressing room though!!!!</li>
    <li> I just got this EXACT makeup cube for Christmas and I couldn&#x27;t be happier! The product doesn&#x27;t look or feel cheaply made and holds tons of product. I moved ALL of my makeup into my cube last night and I was pleasantly surprised it fit all of it. A definitely noteworthy item and worth the $$$.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I asked for this exact item from my husband for Christmas; read the reviews; overall LOVE this product. It comes with inserts for all drawers that you can add in yourself or remove them which is a PLUS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m just over the moon about it! Will buy another as my collection grows .... :)</li>
    <li> Looks beautiful on my countertop in my bathroom, I can keep my make up organized and see what I have in each drawer, the wrapping for delivery is pretty good also, I&#x27;m not sure that it&#x27;s really worth what I paid for. But still a decent quality and good looking item.</li>
    <li> Came cracked in 200.pieces its no good</li>
    <li> Bought as gift for my daughter.  Would have given 5 stars except it arrived with a small crack and co would not replace.&lt;br /&gt;Other than the crack, it is a nice heavy piece and has a lot of room.  Daughter is very happy with it.</li>
    <li> LOOOOOOOOVE IT!!!!!  soooooo worth EVERY damn penny!!!  works so good &amp; the Quality is AMAZING!!!  LOVE, LOVE LOVE IT!!!  SO HAPPY I PURCHASED THIS!!!</li>
    <li> I just love this Cube, for the price it&#x27;s amazing and well worth it.  I received it in 4 days and it was packaged really good.  I totally Love, Love this cube.  Thanks Amazon</li>
    <li> I ordered 2...and both were damaged. I knew one may have been and it was a lower price...but the one I got full price it was also broken up</li>
    <li> Nice and sturdy item.  Good looking too.  Finally, I have a bathroom that looks they way I&#x27;ve always wanted; pared down, organized, and tidy.  I never have to go looking for what I have.  It&#x27;s all organized and I can easily find what I need.</li>
    <li> Received the product nice makeup case but I need to return it, there was a substantial crack on the top shelf. Quality looks nice besides the crack in it. Looking into ordering it again.</li>
    <li> Beauti Cube is large and should hold plenty of makeup, but I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars because it was received damaged.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging was not damaged, however the face of the bottom drawer is chipped on the left side. I&#x27;m returning for replacement and will update review when received.</li>
    <li> Beautiful acrylic cosmetic drawer. It seems very durable and sturdy. I&#x27;ve had it for a month now, and I am very satisfied. The drawers are very roomy and fits all my makeup I wanted to put in there. Also, it came with more dividers than I anticipated, which was a nice surprise. I gave it 4 stars because it came with a small crack that i figured would be too much of a hassle to return and didn&#x27;t bug me much anyway.</li>
    <li> I am pretty picky and I think this looks great. It is nice, heavy acrylic. I haven&#x27;t seen the real, super expensive Clear Cube version in person before so I can&#x27;t say whether it looks any different, but I am very happy with this purchase. I think it&#x27;s a great product and the price is definitely much lower than the real thing. Very happy I went with this one from Beauti Cosmetics.</li>
    <li> This was easy to assemble and perfect for storing my makeup.  You can see all of your products and it is easy to find what you are looking for.</li>
    <li> I have looked at a ton of make up organizers and I am pleased with my purchase. It was packaged well however it still arrived with a very small crack in the acrylic. The crack wasn&#x27;t significant enough for me to return the purchase. It would only be noticeable if someone were to completely inspect it. I have a lot of make up and it is finally stored comfortably in this organizer. If not for the very small crack I would give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> A very practical, clean and visual way to store your makeup and beauty accessories. It looks great on a vanity table and makes your professional or personal makeup applications a charm.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love, love, LOVE my new makeup organizer! Everything has a place! This is very well made. It came double boxed with styrofoam ends. It was wrapped in plastic then in bubble wrap. Yes it is a little heavy. Well worth the price. I would recommend this to everyone!</li>
    <li> I LOVE my case! Sturdy and fit all my makeup. I thought it would be too small, but the drawers are spacious and the dividers included helped make compartments. I do wish, however, that the top lid was removable. I put things that stand tall such as sprays and bottles up there, but still, a great buy!</li>
    <li> Amazing! Great quality and perfect for a makeup addict like me to keep all my makeup organized.. It&#x27;s clear so easy to see things and find what you need :)</li>
    <li> I ordered this to keep some of my make-up organized in my bathroom. I love it. It shipped extremely quickly. Wonderful seller. I would buy this again &amp; again.</li>
    <li> This makeup organizer is amazing! It is the best price I found. It also came with 4 drawer organizers included.  The quality is great. It is very sturdy. So happy to finally have my makeup organized and no longer have to dig thru a makeup bag anymore! Thanks for a great product.</li>
    <li> Just received my organizer today! Yay! It arrived very quickly and via FedEx. It is so thick and extremely well made. Cannot wait to get all of my items in it. Not certain if I will use all of the seperators that came with it. There are quite a few.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice, heavy, and of great quality.  There&#x27;s enough room for a lot of my make up.  It&#x27;s now all in one place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been wanting something like this since I first seen the one on Kim Kardashian&#x27;s bathroom sink.  It&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> I just received the 5 drawer/with lid and have been giddy with anticipation of organizing my massive collection of makeup and beauty products.  I agonized for close to a year debating if I should purchase it or find an alternative that is less expensive.  My husband finally convinced me to go with the Amazon item.  It arrived well packaged and I did unwrap it immediately however; I hadn&#x27;t had time to put it to use so I left it until today.  I began to arrange my items and discovered what I thought was a piece of plastic Saran wrap stuck on the bottom drawer and went to remove it and Waaaa...Sniff*. It was a crack right in the corner bottom drawer front. I will contact the company to have it returned and another shipped out.  .. the dividers that fit into the drawers appear to be far too short to form the X or H in each drawer.  It&#x27;s SOO weird&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sept 3/12&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After contacting the company regarding the dividers I discovered it was my error and the dividers for this item are meant to \\&quot;float\\&quot;. I mistakenly thought they should be form an H and an X however; it was a different unit I had been looking at and thought that was what I had ordered. Just got them mixed up.  Duh!  I apologize to Frank at Beauti Cosmetics for the mistake.  The drawers are lovely and I will be keeping them and not</li>
    <li> it holds so much while keeping items visible and accessible. i wish i&#x27;d bought it sooner.  it is sturdy and well-made.</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful piece.  I love all the room and how beautifully it displays whatever you put in it.  Their customer service is also top notch.</li>
    <li> This Make Up Organizer is everything I hoped it would be! It arrived quickly and there was no assemlbing. I have now had the organizer for 6 months and have had no issues with it at all. I love that I can see my make up without having to search. I recommend it to everyone I know and always get compliments when people see it in my room.</li>
    <li> I am a make up junky and this is definetly what I needed to get my make up organized. I&#x27;m well on my way to a sencond case! LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!! Came soooo fast too!</li>
    <li> My husband ordered this for my Christmas present, it arrived pretty quickly and it looked awesome but I quickly noticed 3 different cracks on it. Obviously we returned it because it&#x27;s an expensive item to just keep around if it&#x27;s damaged. I just ordered another one yesterday but it will arrive after Christmas, no biggie, but I do hope this one comes in a good condition. I&#x27;ll update this review once I receive it.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing organizer for all your makeup plus extra :) I always had issues finding my makeup cause it was just all over the place. I was  looking around for something until I came across this product, yes it is a little spendy but so worth the money. I read all the reviews for this product before buying it and took a chance. I love it! My makeup is all organized, easy to find, easy access to everything. Love the drawers! Don&#x27;t hesitate, it&#x27;s a great buy.</li>
    <li> It exceeded my expectations.  Very sturdy, very roomy.  It holds a lot.</li>
    <li> Within the first month a handle broke off.  Now another handle has broken.  I emailed Amazon to complain about this, but got no response.  I need two drawers replaced. Cannot even open these drawers without the handles!</li>
    <li> Great organizer. Super pricey. My friends and family face dropped when they found out how much I spent on it. But it&#x27;s a great investment piece! It organizes all my makeup and I know where every little item is located. It just basically organized my whole life. My husband actually can find things that he needs in this.</li>
    <li> I love my Beauti Cube. Great product for half the price of the Cosmo Cube!</li>
    <li> This is super expensive but worth it. it was packaged very well and came assembled. You can change the drawer dividers to how you see fit and they also have a removable poly film to prevent scratches.&lt;br /&gt;I have a few of these now and like how the top drawer flips open for easy access.</li>
    <li> Very nice! plenty of room for makeup. I love the smooth pulls.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this cube!!!  I was scared to buy this because I was worried it wouldn&#x27;t meet my expectations and it&#x27;s pretty costly. But I love it and the seller packed it really well. Not a scratch on it. It arrived quicker than expected. It&#x27;s beautiful!!  I&#x27;m so glad I bought this!  The drawers slide out well and it appears to be very sturdy. Just spend the money on it. You won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping, arrived in perfect condition, great quality, all my makeup fits in it. Love it!</li>
    <li> The acrylic make up organizer is the best purchase I&#x27;ve made all year! The shipping was fast and easy. The product it&#x27;s self is made extremely well and is at a great price. I researched online and a box similar to this can cost up to $600! I love the design of this item because of the top lid that can open and close, other acrylic makeup organizers do not have this feature.</li>
