      <li>This is the best brand I&#x27;ve tried for dry shampoo.</li>
      <li>best dry shampoo on the market.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the same price to buy the package of 3 here as it is to buy one can in the store, so it&#x27;s an incredible value as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Smells decent, gives you good volume &amp; does what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
      <li>However, it doesn&#x27;t work well with my fine hair, which there is a lot of.</li>
      <li>I tried a few ways and found for best results</li>
      <li>Use well on light colored hell.</li>

      <li>I have tried many different dry shampoos, and this one is by far the best.</li>
      <li>It smells good but not too powerful and makes your hair fluffy and immediately clean.</li>
      <li>I have tried pretty much all dry shampoos that amazon has to offer, this is the best by a long way</li>
      <li>About half this price at the drugstore/walmart/target, and really good.  </li>
      <li>It does leave powder in your hair, so if you are brunette be aware.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
      <li>It takes away the extra oil from my hair while still leaving a healthy looking shine, softness, and lots of body and volume.  </li>
      <li>Love this dry shampoo.</li>
      <li>I do prefer my $45 dry shampoo better</li>
      <li>You can&#x27;t get a better dry shampoo for this price!</li>
      <li>Dove products seem to stand for a pretty high quality and this shampoo is not an exception.</li>
      <li>Maybe I&#x27;m just using too much.  </li>
      <li>works really well between shampoos,,</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found other brands to work better</li>
      <li>Definitely other brands I&#x27;ve had more luck with.</li>
      <li>The smell is decent too.  </li>
      <li>great for women who need to touch-up little bit of oiliness at temples/forehead, know no need for daily shampooing just for that little area.</li>
      <li>Better than any other dry shampoo I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>This dry shampoo is way better than other brands I have tried.</li>
      <li>The only complaint is the scent is very very strong.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it only thing though if you spray too much it will leave powdery white stuff.</li>
      <li>Not terribly expensive, and will extend your time between shampoo with average residue.</li>

<li> I have dark brown to black hair and after rubbing the product in and brushing it out I don&#x27;t have any powder residue showing.</li>
<li> I like the smell of this one, and I do think it provides volume, but I have a hard time getting the white powder look to absorb into my brunette hair, and sometimes I think it leaves me a little gray.  </li>
<li> I use dry shampoo at least twice a week.  </li>
<li> So sad Amazon doesn&#x27;t carry this anymore.  </li>

    <li> freakin&#x27; love this stuff. best dry shampoo on the market.</li>
    <li> I did not buy it from amazon but I really liked it so I wanted to let other people know about it. It smells good but not too powerful and makes your hair fluffy and immediately clean. Dove products seem to stand for a pretty high quality and this shampoo is not an exception.</li>
    <li> This dry shampoo is way better than other brands I have tried. I used it on my dark blonde hair and it looked like I had just taken a shower, no powdery residue like I have had with other brands. It has a light feel that is unnoticeable and it smells great too. It&#x27;s the same price to buy the package of 3 here as it is to buy one can in the store, so it&#x27;s an incredible value as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product 100% to anybody.</li>
    <li> I have tried many different dry shampoos, and this one is by far the best. I first found this in store and tried it and loved it! Smells great, any grayness combs right out, and adds great volume! The best I&#x27;ve found for oil absorption too. This time I&#x27;m ordering online because this is a great price!</li>
    <li> works really well between shampoos,,</li>
    <li> Smells great I&#x27;ve used it only thing though if you spray too much it will leave powdery white stuff. Use well on light colored hell. Otherwise perfect</li>
    <li> I could never have enough dry shampoo. The only complaint is the scent is very very strong. I don&#x27;t have problems with residue.</li>
    <li> This is the best brand I&#x27;ve tried for dry shampoo. It also smells great. I feel like the bottle doesn&#x27;t last as long as it should, but I also have had that experience with all the brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> This is the best dry shampoo I have tried for the price.  All they others I have tried do not work as well. The smell is decent too.  I do prefer my $45 dry shampoo better but I can&#x27;t afford it all the time.  It does leave powder in your hair, so if you are brunette be aware. But if you follow the directions you should be ok. I love it for my blondish hair because it make it look freshly highlighted.</li>
    <li> Smells decent, gives you good volume &amp; does what it&#x27;s supposed to. It can leave a bit of a powdery residue so be sure to shake it well during use &amp; comb it through afterwards. Not the very best of the dry shampoos but a solid offering from Dove.</li>
    <li> Fast shipment and great product!</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t get a better dry shampoo for this price!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  Better than any other dry shampoo I&#x27;ve tried. Only drawback is that the can empties so fast, so the price is hard to justify. But, I just love the way it gives my hair more body and feels so good on the scalp. I only give it 4 stars because of the price relative to the number of uses you can get from a can.</li>
    <li> I have tried pretty much all dry shampoos that amazon has to offer, this is the best by a long way</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok.  I use dry shampoo at least twice a week.  I like the smell of this one, and I do think it provides volume, but I have a hard time getting the white powder look to absorb into my brunette hair, and sometimes I think it leaves me a little gray.  Maybe I&#x27;m just using too much.  Definitely other brands I&#x27;ve had more luck with.</li>
    <li> About half this price at the drugstore/walmart/target, and really good.  I have tried much more expensive brands that do not work as well.</li>
    <li> Not terribly expensive, and will extend your time between shampoo with average residue. I suggest spraying roots and let it dry while doing your make-up or getting dressed. Finger comb or lightly brush for some lift and freshening. Caution against using too much or using more than twice between washing as you&#x27;ll get a funky texture to your hair.</li>
    <li> Works well, smells good</li>
    <li> This smells pretty good- not like baby powder, which I&#x27;m not a fan of.  However, it doesn&#x27;t work well with my fine hair, which there is a lot of. I was excited to find something for a decent price, but my hair ends up looking greasy and messy (in a bad way) after just a couple of hours. I&#x27;ve tried using this both before bed and when I wake up, and have had no luck.</li>
    <li> Love this dry shampoo. It takes away the extra oil from my hair while still leaving a healthy looking shine, softness, and lots of body and volume.  I can&#x27;t comment for dark hair, but my hair is a strawberry blonde that naturally lightens in summer.  Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> So sad Amazon doesn&#x27;t carry this anymore.  This was the BEST dry shampoo I have ever used.  It was a great value too.  Please bring this back Amazon!!!</li>
    <li> great for women who need to touch-up little bit of oiliness at temples/forehead, know no need for daily shampooing just for that little area.</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair feeling chalky. I&#x27;ve found other brands to work better</li>
    <li> I swear by dove dry shampoo. Love the smell. Love the way it blends, adds volume and soaks up oils. I have dark brown to black hair and after rubbing the product in and brushing it out I don&#x27;t have any powder residue showing.</li>
    <li> Leaves gray marks in your hair.  Probably best on light colored hair.  I tried a few ways and found for best results use the night before.  I wouldnt get again.</li>
