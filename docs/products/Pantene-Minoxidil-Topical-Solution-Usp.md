      <li>Great product, great price on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Makes my hair feel great and look great.</li>

      <li>Love it!!</li>
      <li>I feel the thickening treatment more than lived up to the advertising!!</li>
      <li>/&gt;The smell is very nice herbal smell with a touch of floral, but it is still quite unisex and not too girly smelling.  </li>
      <li>I noticed a great deal of difference in the look and feel of my hair and am very happy with the shine and healthy look and  feeling I have received since use.</li>
      <li>I used the kit that came with the Age Defy shampoo and conditioner, but I am most impressed with the thickening treatment.  </li>
      <li>God gave me many wonderful assets but &amp;#34;good hair&amp;#34; was not among them.  </li>
      <li>but it is the best product I have tried and will have to do until they find something that can help you grow more hair or have less-fine hair.</li>
      <li>Okay, I think I am the perfect person to be a guinea pig for this product.</li>
      <li>The best product from pantene, i love it, and that price is so good too, in wallgreens it cost 20 dollars.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t worry about the pleasant smell...</li>
      <li>in all, if you have thinning hair and want a boost at the top of your head, this is not an inexpensive solution, but it does work, and remarkably so!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought this from the store few months ago. Anti-aging, clean refreshing smell. Directions are Pump near the roots and massage through your scalp. So I did after I shampooed and towel dried my hair.  I enjoyed the smell and the shine and the root lift like feel.  I wash my hair everyother day. I made sure the front of my (crown/ and bangs)  are covered. First, I noticed that I didn&#x27;t need to touch up my roots as much.. I thought this is wonderful, at first, then I noticed that so much of my bang hair is falling out. It was getting worse.. I could see the shrunken roots at the end of each lost hair.  My bangs were getting thinner, and the scalp was starting to show more. I thought may be this is transitional, some hair treatments that thicken hair speed up the hair turnover first.. I kept using it for like 3months. The hair loss continued and was getting worse. Then I decided to take a closer look at the ingredients, there it was CAFFEINE!!!!! You know the science behind using caffeine? It shrinks blood vessels (in layman terms) hence it &#x27;s good to pack a bleeding wound with coffee grounds..  put tea bags around tired eyes to lighten dark circles . To put it at the root of your hair, on your scalp, means lessening blood supply to your hair root. That&#x27;s why my hair roots didn&#x27;t need that much touch ups, it slowed down growth, that&#x27;s why my scalp was getting more visible. And the areas I took care of, where the areas of my scalp were the scalp areas with the most loss .. I threw away the rest down the drain ( throwing away a nice smelling product or anything is not my thing). Shame on a company where the basics of science or at least common sense is lacking. The funny part, I quickly reviewed the ingredients before I bought it, to make sure There is no silicones were there. Did not catch that caffeine part.  If you are enjoying the nice fresh smell and the shine great, enjoy it while you still have hair.. Or skip the roots and use this pretty pricy gel thing to have anice smell on your hair. But on your roots?? You might be bold .. Literally !!!</li>
    <li> A little disappointing.  Not worth the price.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical as I&#x27;ve tried numerous different things to make my hair at least appear thicker. My hair has become very thin and it is very noticeable at my part at the roots. I have only used this twice and I have ALREADY noticed a difference!!! I&#x27;m in shock! Couldn&#x27;t be happier!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I just wish it didn&#x27;t cost so much. But it goes a long way. I use it every morning along with the age defy shampoo and conditioner. I noticed within a few days that my hair was thicker, especially along the part line. My hair is shoulder length and after a month of use I noticed I was shaking my head and could feel movement and not just limp hair. And I had more control when I style my hair. I will definitely continue to use this product and I highly recommend it for anyone who wants thicker hair. No, it&#x27;s not a miracle worker and you won&#x27;t have a head of thick hair if you have fine thin hair but the improvement is impressive.</li>
    <li> This product seems to be working out for me.  The thining hair and bald spots are less noticeable.  I wold recommend this for sure.</li>
    <li> My mom loves this stuff!</li>
    <li> I was so excited to use this product based on the rave reviews from several hair magazines.  At first, this worked AMAZINGLY!  My fine, thin hair was noticeably thicker to people who were unaware of my new product.  However, after 5 daily uses according to the pump amount indicated on the bottle (something like a dozen pumps per usage), my scalp became very irritated.  It had red bumps, almost like a heat rash, was broken out, was itchy, and then I found the product to no longer thicken my hair as it did originally.  I have fine, thin hair, and I am careful to use products that enhance and not make my thin hair more obvious.  My scalp is sensitive, and I have used Pantene products in the past with no scalp irritation whatsoever.  I am very disappointed with this product.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair fuller every time I use it.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like it.  I thought it left a residue on my hair.  Made it very heavy and very greasy.  Did not like it.</li>
    <li> WOULD LIKE TO TRY THIS PRODUCT, BUT IT SEEMS THEY ARE OUT OF STOCK AND I CANNOT GET A REPLACEMENT VERY FRUSTRATING.  WAS ABLE TO FIX THE CAP.  IT COMES IN TWO PIECES WHICH NEED TO BE SEPARATED TO WORK  WISH THEY HAD EXPLAINED THAT ON THE PACKATE.</li>
    <li> I was very happy with this product and the price I acquired it for</li>
    <li> I have used Pantene Pro-V for several years.  Being older and the texture of my hair changing, I find this product restores luster and&lt;br /&gt;actually makes my hair feel younger.</li>
    <li> I have tried a number of products to help with thinning hair, including Nioxin products.  This is the only thickening treatment that is working for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it every day for the last 4 months.  I find that 7 pumps is enough (instead of the 15 pumps stated in the instruction).  It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down nor does it make it feel greasy.  I do find it a bit drying, however.  I always make sure that I use my leave-in conditioner with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the initial purchase, I signed up for the subscribe and save program.  It is the best price I&#x27;ve found!</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this and will definitely buy more. I love this stuff. It makes my fine, thin hair thick and lasts till the next day. I typically use the high end salon products to accomplish what this can do. I definitely would recommend.</li>
    <li> good price&lt;br /&gt;good product</li>
    <li> This is a good product which is easy to appy.it makes the hair feel thicker and really silky. This is the best thickening product I have used.</li>
    <li> The product seems to work well enough - There are no miracles, but the Pantene product does help thinning hair.</li>
    <li> works well but amazon just doubled the price.Shop around.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful.  It thickened my hair without making my hair dry and difficult to manage.  I am thrilled with the way it works.</li>
    <li> Thought I&#x27;d try a less expensive/different thickening treatment and found Pantene&#x27;s to be ineffective.  After showering I lost considerable amounts of hair and will return to using Aveda&#x27;s Invati scalp treatment.</li>
    <li> Leaves hair sticky.  Does not thicken hair.</li>
    <li> This is a good product for fine or thinning hair.  I use more than the directions recommend, and have good results.</li>
    <li> My hair is more than a foot long, and I have used this product for four months.  My hair is straighter and less tangled.  I also am sure that it stays in a clip at the nape of my neck better, because it would fall out of a clip before I started using this product.  That is probably due to thickening.  I will continue to use the AgeDefy every day.</li>
    <li> I tried this product thinking it would thicken my hair but it really didn&#x27;t do anything for it.  It might work for someone else but this is not for me.</li>
    <li> I started using this product a few weeks ago and I love it.  I noticed in the first 3 days that I wasn&#x27;t seeing as much hair in the shower when I washed my hair.  After 6 days my hair seemed thicker and fuller.  I use it every day and love it.</li>
    <li> This stuff really seems to be working on my soooo thin hair.  It must be used as directed to achieve results.</li>
    <li> I have fine thin hair, and this product has been a miracle for me. My hair looks better than it has in years.</li>
    <li> This product felt like I was spraying water on my hair. I am not sure how it was suppose to help, not a thickening agent that coated the hair nor did my hair appear any different when I used the product. Not sure how it would be healthier.</li>
    <li> This stuff actually works! Like others said, the look of having fuller hair only lasts until you wash it again, so you do need to keep using this if you want to keep having hair that appears kess thin. Not a permanent treatment. But well worth it. And it&#x27;s easy to use on wet or dry hair.</li>
    <li> I used it on Caucasian man and I could see a difference and thickening, but when I tried on my edges on my hairline, I did not see a difference at all on my coarse ethnic hair.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to use on coarse hair for people of color.</li>
    <li> horrible product  - didn&#x27;t work, makes my hair fall off more and get thinner.</li>
    <li> If they every quit making this I will cry. It adds thickness and body, without adding stickiness or that product gunky feel. My hair is just soft, and thick with volume.  When my hair is still damp from my shower, I spray it all along my roots all around my head. You can&#x27;t seem to use too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I age I have definitely noticed my hair is getting a bit thinner. Which I hate, because I have always had a ton of hair. It&#x27;s fine in texture, but I&#x27;ve always had so much that I never worried about it. But, I can tell this year that perhaps I am starting to lose some and it was killing me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; first bought it as part of the Age Defy three pack, that included the shampoo and conditioner. The shampoo and conditioner are terrible- I actually threw them away after the first time I used them! So, don&#x27;t waste your time on that starter three pack would be my opinion.</li>
    <li> She is so young looking !!!</li>
    <li> Totally can&#x27;t tell that it does anything. On the other hand, at least it doesn&#x27;t make my hair gummy or flake, either, so it doesn&#x27;t hurt anything. Whether I use it or not, I don&#x27;t see a difference. There&#x27;ve been times when I&#x27;ve looked at my hair or run my hands through it and wondered, &amp;#34;Did I apply that stuff today? I can&#x27;t remember.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t expect any miracles.  It did add a little bit more body to my hair.  It&#x27;s not that expensive of a product so it&#x27;s worth giving it a try atleast once.  I&#x27;ve heard people say that it only works on straight hair,  but I disagree, my hair is extremely curly and I had results.  You can buy this product in the store and save on the shipping and handling and waiting by the mail box.</li>
    <li> My daughter told me about this product so I decided to try it. It has worked wonders on my 72 year old hair!!!!!</li>
    <li> I really like this and will order it again.  It leaves my dandelion fuzz smooth and manageable.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I have been using it for over a year and it really helps me to lose so much hair. I can tell if u don&#x27;t use it every day. I have fine hair and it doesn&#x27;t make it greasy either.</li>
    <li> I am only sorry I left it at home while I am on vacation.  It requires a little concentration during application, but it does work.</li>
    <li> Light weight and feels good. I didn&#x27;t notice any difference, but I like it.</li>
    <li> Okay, I first received this as a sample to try and with in a week was on Amazon buying it. If they ever stop making it I will seriously cry. You spray and rub it in your scalp, my thin hair actually feels thicker and I am losing less hair when I shower. No greasy residue, still use my regular products, just added this one. You have to try it if you have thin hair.</li>
    <li> For my very fine and oily hair this product worked best on the second day after shampooing. I would spray it on as per instructions on my dry hair and scalp and as it dried my hair became noticeably fuller and had more body. I am hoping that it will be sold in South Africa soon cos with the exchange rate, would not be able to buy it off Amazon too often, much as I like the product.</li>
    <li> This is the best volume-creating hair product I have ever used. Ever! I have very fine hair and have tried every thickening/volume product out there. Some work to varying degrees, some don&#x27;t. This not only works, but it does not leave any residue.&lt;br /&gt;It seems to function more as a root lifter than anything else, but it does it extremely well. I part my hair in pieces all over and give a spritz to the roots in each section  - about a dozen spritzes altogether. There&#x27;s a snap-on spray head cover that keeps the product from caking in the sprayer so you never have to run it under hot water to open the spritzer.&lt;br /&gt;My hair looks and feels fuller than with any other product I&#x27;ve tried before, including the super-pricey celebrity salon products. I hope they never stop making it.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product. also very good with hair growing</li>
    <li> I honestly could not tell a difference with this vs a good mousse.  Also thought the application was messy and cumbersome.</li>
    <li> I have baby fine hair and this product puts fullness and body in my hair.  It is a super product.</li>
    <li> So far so good.  I use it every day, especially if I am out in the sun here in Florida.  Seems to be doing a good job.</li>
    <li> After using this product for about two weeks, my dad said that it seems to start working. It&#x27;s not very obvious to me that his hair got thickened though.</li>
    <li> I am still experimenting with this product. I am not yet sure if it&#x27;s working to add volume to my hair or not. I can&#x27;t tell if the weather or the shampoo and conditioner are also contributing to a slightly fuller head of hair. But I will continue to observe if it&#x27;s working. I will check out the reviews to see how it&#x27;s working for other people.</li>
    <li> Because my hair is baby fine, the product made it greasy even when used in minimal amounts.  Perhaps for thicker hair, it would do the trick.</li>
    <li> This thickening treatment is fantastic and it does what it promises, it makes your hair feel so thick with out the stiff feeling.  I have stocked up on this product along with the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> Contains alcohol, which drys out the hair.  Does not increase hair thickness.</li>
    <li> This product works great.</li>
    <li> my wife loves this stuff.</li>
    <li> I have straight, fine hair (and not a lot of it).  I needed something to give my hair some body without making it stiff and this is the perfect product.  It is easy to use - just a few sprays at the routes, tossle your hair and then blow dry.</li>
    <li> I have hair that has become very fine and a lot thinner with age so I bought this product with great expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the product for a week and noticed no difference whatsoever. In the end I was having to tip it into my hand and apply it manually as the sprayer blocked after about 4 uses and it was coming out (with difficulty) in a squirt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A complete waste of money and a gimmick in my opinion.</li>
    <li> AMAZING PRODUCT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thinning hair for no known reason...probably over dying and over straightening!  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this product (along with the shampoo and conditioner) and very seriously in ONE day I saw a difference!  My hair feels and looks not only thicker, but is shiny!  My hair looks and feels thick and full!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is very literally paper thin, but doesn&#x27;t appear that way anymore!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a keeper and certainly worth the money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will purchase again!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to rate this product because it&#x27;s nearly impossible to use because the pump sticks down and you have to constantly pull it back up to use it.  It&#x27;s too much of a pain for the money.</li>
    <li> Fantastic!  Makes my hair look so much thicker than it actually is.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my late twenties yet I&#x27;ve already noticed my hair toward the front of my scalp thinning. I don&#x27;t mean those fine baby hairs closer to my temples; I mean the hair right above the middle of my forehead. I think it might have to do with spending the last seven to ten years trying to achieve that 40&#x27;s/50&#x27;s &amp;#34;lift&amp;#34; (see pictures of Marilyn Monroe or Rita Hayworth to see what I mean), with any number of hair products and styling tools, as well with certain recent stresses and environmental changes. Either way, I&#x27;ve been searching for &#x27;something&#x27; that will make my hair thicker up there--just there, nowhere else on my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I heard about this product in Cosmo and how it, along with a few others, helped another girl who had a similar problem. I have to say first it came packaged with a few other items I ordered, but I noticed the box looked a little damaged/roughly handled. It also looked like some of the bottle&#x27;s contents might have been squeezed out already. Not sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, I started using the product since before Christmas and have been using it regularly since. I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference. I do, after I first apply the clear gel to the front part my scalp, notice there&#x27;s a bit more body, but that effect--if it even lasts a whole day--will immediately disappear the minute I wash my hair the next morning. I haven&#x27;t noticed any cumulative effect either, after almost two months of use. Really there hasn&#x27;t been much of difference between this product and what a regular hair gel could do for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also noticed some irritation/itchiness after I apply this product to my scalp. It isn&#x27;t too intense and won&#x27;t last two long, but for a few hours after I first apply it it bugs me a little. In addition, I&#x27;ve noticed when the gel dries it will sometime leave a white, flaky residue that might be visible (and might be the source of the itchiness, but I&#x27;m not sure).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I think there are probably other productsout there that work better for less money. I won&#x27;t be buying any more Age Defying Thickening Treatment.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  It works!  Gives volume to hair.  The directions suggest using it everyday for a week, however, I did every other day and got fine results.</li>
    <li> Made my hair feel thicker.  But does not do anything extraordinary like regrow hair.  It is cosmetic and one time use results, nothing cumulative.  But I do like the product a lot and will buy again</li>
    <li> I had taken a clinical trial with the Pantene thickening treatment and my hair was measured every  3 months and it works.  Not hugely but there was thickening of the hair.</li>
    <li> Take note that the product doesn&#x27;t disclose how you use it until you open the box.  Basically you have to put repeated parts in your hair using 15 full pumps and massage it in every day. Basically soak you scalp to your ears. That takes a lot of product, too much time, and too much work on a daily basis. I would return it if I could. I feel they intentionally failed to disclose what was involved to get you to buy it.</li>
    <li> Worked to thicken the strands of hair on my head, which helped minimize the appearance of thinning hair and visible scalp.  My hair dresser even noticed less hair in her comb at my next visit.</li>
    <li> So suprised and disappointed that this product did not work at all.  I had hopes...oh well.  Money wasted I guess.</li>
    <li> I have thin, fine hair. This makes my hair feel thicker, makes it shiny too. My hair feels just wonderful!</li>
    <li> Amazingly good product.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this treatment for very long, but so far it seems to give my fine hair more body.</li>
    <li> While nothing really makes my hair thicker, this is the best product ever for adding body and helping my hair stay in shape all day.</li>
    <li> This product did not really reduce my falling hair, though the strands look healthier. Appreciate the improvement nevertheless. Am on my second bottle and have ordered more. Can be applied on damp or dry hair.</li>
    <li> Great stuff, I&#x27;ve been using since it came out and it definitely has made my hair look and feel thicker!</li>
    <li> not exactly what I expect from this product,but shipped on time</li>
    <li> I guess OK, I found it a little drying.  Not sure if I would repurchase.  I have not been using the quantity recommended.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like the sticky, residue feeling left in my hair.  Won&#x27;t be finishing the bottle so don&#x27;t know if it actually works.</li>
    <li> Since i am 73 i noticed in the past year that my hair had thinned quite a lot and  this product gives my hair a fullness that i had lost and is only needed to be applied once a day.  it helps to hide the fact that my hair has thinned so much that you can see the scalp.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a year and you can really see and feel the difference in my oh so fine hair.</li>
    <li> I could tell a huge positive difference in my hair after the first application!&lt;br /&gt;Consistent use yields even better results - I almost love my hair again!! :)</li>
    <li> This stuff smells awful! I could only stand the smell for 2 days. Didn&#x27;t seem to do much, either. It&#x27;s very watery.  I went back to my Wen styling cream.</li>
    <li> After around two months after I added the thickening treatment I went to my hair dresser and she said,&amp;#34;you have an inch and a half of new hair growing all over your head.&amp;#34;  I didn&#x27;t really notice until she mentioned it.  I use all 3 other products, but had just started using the thickening treatment.</li>
    <li> I see real improvement in my hair, but it doesn&#x27;t work miracles.  So 4 out of 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I can truly say that finally a product that works as it says. Not a miracle, but definitely thickens hair.</li>
    <li> Love it, makes my manly hair smell like a sexy woman.&lt;br /&gt;It really helps thicken my hair after just 1 use.</li>
    <li> Loved it! will be getting more,My moms hair has really gotten thicker and the thin spots are going away.Thanks so much</li>
    <li> Love this product for my fine hair. Costs more in stores. This is a no brainer.</li>
    <li> I am 55 years old woman and I been using this product for a month and it did not do anything for me. I read the reviews at amazon and it sounded like a good product so I tried it but NO my hair is still thin and no thickening at all.  I am using  the shampoo and conditioner for agedefy pantene and my hair still falls off alot. Don&#x27;t waste your money this does not work. I been using Nacho Shampoo and it seems to be doing a better job. My hair isn&#x27;t falling off as much.</li>
    <li> I used this for the first time today. I am going home from the office now (noon) because the smell is so strong that my eyes are watering and burning. I hoped the smell would go away, but it hasn&#x27;t. And the burning/watering of my eyes is getting worse. Otherwise, though it made my hair feel a little stiffer, it also made it dull. Usually my hair is quite shiny. Today, I have dull hair and a strong smell that is sending me home early to shampoo it out. I hope I can return it.</li>
    <li> My hair actually does feel a little bit thicker after a month of use, but as others have said, I&#x27;m not exactly sure what this product is supposed to be doing.  I use a volumizing shampoo, which I assume is roughening my hair cuticle a little, so the shampoo may also be washing off this product, if it&#x27;s supposed to be accumulating.  Is it supposed to be accumulating?  Sometimes it leaves an annoying white residue, sometimes not.</li>
    <li> I have fine straight hair. This Age Defy Advanced Thickening treatment really worked great for me and my hair. The style looked great and the thickening helped it to stay all day. If you need more body in your hair this is a good way to go.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Will never stop using it Great seller!</li>
    <li> First time i used it i was happy the next few times it made me upset .It made my  hair have this weird greasy look and I&#x27;ve washed it and nothing it hasn&#x27;t came off my hair . I bought two bottles and I&#x27;ve pretty much wasted my money on this product it was a let down .</li>
    <li> This product works as advertised, at least for me.  I have very fine hair that is thinning in the front.  Have been using it for a few weeks now and have noticed a difference.  Won&#x27;t call it a miracle yet but I don&#x27;t feel as self conscious.</li>
    <li> i got this for my mom, who is in her 60s and losing hair.  she tried it a couple of times, according to the instructions.  she has very fine hair.  maybe it would work better for ppl w thicker follicles.  this product made my mom&#x27;s hair look really greasy. didn&#x27;t notice any thickening effect.</li>
    <li> I did not notice any change in my hair using this product; however, will finish using until gone; but most likely will not buy again.</li>
    <li> Of course, I tried it.  I try anything that says &amp;#34;thickening&amp;#34; for my baby fine hair.  So far nothing has compared to the Pantene&lt;br /&gt;thickening spray that they USED to make.  Naturally, they discontinued it, a problem that Pantene seems to have---in my&lt;br /&gt;limited experience.  Can&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> Its OK first use made my hair thicker but very dry</li>
    <li> Pantene Pro-V Expert Collection AgeDefy Advanced Thickening Treatment is the best product of this type that I have ever used.  It gives my hair more body, and it&#x27;s so easy to use.  Just squirt it on, work it into your hair and scalp, and style as usual.  It really works great for me!  I give it five stars.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  I can see a difference in my hair when I don&#x27;t use it.  Really helps to add body to my hair.</li>
    <li> It definitely makes my hair appear thicker.</li>
    <li> This product has thickened my hair</li>
    <li> I have very fine, thin hair.  I was skeptical of the claims that this product would make my hair appear thicker, but it has done that for me.  I use it in conjunction with the Pantene 7 signs of anti-aging hair line.  So far, I don&#x27;t find it to be drying.&lt;br /&gt;I have found that I do not need to apply as much as the directions state.  This is a good thing, as it is expensive.  Pantene puts out coupons regularly, so that helps some.  Still, it is hard to spend so much money on a product without knowing if it will work.  In this case, I am glad I did.  I hope this product stays around for a long time.</li>
    <li> Really a good product. I can see the difference in using it after a few days. Wonderful results</li>
    <li> I have fine hair so have tried lots of products.  Some work to make your hair feel thicker.  This product does not.  And it was painful to throw it away, since it was expensive.</li>
    <li> At first I loved this hair product. My hair was noticeably thicker. However, after using this product for a month my scalp and hair are extremely dry. I usually have oily hair, but now my hair is hay like. I wish this product hadn&#x27;t dried my hair out because it definitely makes my hair thicker.</li>
    <li> I was not sure what to expect from Pantene Pro-V Expert Collection Age Defy Advanced Hair Thickening Treatment. The name itself takes so long to say that it is almost intimidating!  I have been doing hair for quite a few years now, so I realize that not every product lives up to the hype.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hair treatment comes in a clear plastic bottle which has a pump top on it.  The pump top has a cap that locks into place so it helps prevent a clog from happening over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is very nice herbal smell with a touch of floral, but it is still quite unisex and not too girly smelling.  I have tested this on a man and woman with two different types of hair.  I have tested it on hair that is medium thick but color treated and thinning, and I have tested it on baby fine hair which takes a lot to give it body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In both cases, you squirt a tiny dot of clear gel on the scalp.  I only used it on the top of the head, however, as that is all I really needed to see it work.  By making about six parts on the scalp and putting a dot the size of a lentil on the front middle and back of each part (from front back toward the crown of the head) it was easy to massage the gel into the scalp where it absorbed easily and quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This process only takes about five minutes tops if you are really deliberate at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that in both cases, the results were instant.  The hair was immediately thicker and stood up straighter from the scalp making it look thicker immediately.  By using it every other day, the results seemed to stay well, but if I waited longer than that between applications, the results did not stay well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each treatment seemed to increase the thick appearance a little until the hair did look nice and thicker than it was before.  I noticed on the medium thick hair (which was thinning on top) that the results were much more dramatic than on the baby fine hair.  However, the baby fine hair was also remarkably thickened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;Makes hair look thicker after first application&lt;br /&gt;Unisex fragrance&lt;br /&gt;No itching or flaking&lt;br /&gt;Not sticky&lt;br /&gt;Absorbs into scalp&lt;br /&gt;Does not make hair dirty&lt;br /&gt;Very effective with small amount&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;Has to be used daily or at least every other day&lt;br /&gt;Results depend on constant use&lt;br /&gt;Expensive for amount purchased&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, if you have thinning hair and want a boost at the top of your head, this is not an inexpensive solution, but it does work, and remarkably so!

No bad reactions or side effects over a longer period of use make this a nice way to boost hair that needs a bit of a boost for thicker appearance.  I was pleasantly surprised at how well it worked and highly recommend it.ed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;Makes hair look thicker after first application&lt;br /&gt;Unisex fragrance&lt;br /&gt;No itching or flaking&lt;br /&gt;Not sticky&lt;br /&gt;Absorbs into scalp&lt;br /&gt;Does not make hair dirty&lt;br /&gt;Very effective with small amount&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;Has to be used daily or at least every other day&lt;br /&gt;Results depend on constant use&lt;br /&gt;Expensive for amount purchased&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, if you have thinning hair and want a boost at the top of your head, this is not an inexpensive solution, but it does work, and remarkably so!

    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Thickening Spray along with the shampoo and conditioner for 6 weeks.  I love it.  My hair is back to being shiny and bouncy with much body and it&#x27;s definitely fuller and thicker. It also doesn&#x27;t seem to get frizzy anymore even when I&#x27;ve been out and about in the rain.  Also amazing.  My hair is just above shoulder length and all one length.  I use the 15 pumps all over my scalp - I do it in 3 sections - 5 - 5 - 5.  But then I use another 10 pumps throughout my hair.  I love my hair feeling and looking so clean and full - not what I call \\&quot;gummy\\&quot; at all - I hate that feeling.  Before using this line my hair was lifeless and very brittle along with being flat and thinning. I have tried so many products to help with my thinning hair - this is a miracle.  My hair has not been this great for many years - I&#x27;m thrilled with these products but especially the Thickening Spray.</li>
    <li> Okay, I think I am the perfect person to be a guinea pig for this product. I have thin, fine hair, straight as straight can be. plus, my hair is long. I am 44 and it is also thinning a bit. I used it according to the directions, and I my hair does seem a bit thicker and looks a bit better than it does without it. Now, don&#x27;t think this is going to give you princess hair or something but it does look thicker and feels good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback is that I saw it costs almost $30. A typical person probably wouldn&#x27;t spend that much on hair thickening. Or maybe they would? I&#x27;d say this would last a couple of months so if you want to spend $15 a month on thicker hair than you would probably give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> If you have hair like me - I have blond shoulder-length hair, it&#x27;s light and thin and gets oily on day 2 - it&#x27;s a pain, and only beautiful freshly washed.  I found using a gel just does not work for me.  Pantene&#x27;s gel, while claiming to thicken hair, just made it sticky, and i did try it more than once, using less next time around.  It was so sticky and oily-looking, I had to wash my hair all over again.  I found dry shampoo works much better for me, I currently use either [[ASIN:B000XYPNMS Oscar Blandi Pronto Dry Shampoo Powder, 2.5 Ounce]] in shake powder or [[ASIN:B000ULRBSI Rene Furterer Naturia Dry Shampoo 3.2 Ounce (150 ml)]] in spray powder.  I prefer Naturia, but the spray can is poorly designed, and it sometimes releases all the powder on it&#x27;s own.  So in summary, if you have oily thin blond hair that gets disgusting on day 2.. stick to dry shampoos.</li>
    <li> but I believe the research and I&#x27;m sure they tested it or they couldn&#x27;t say it increases the diameter of each hair! So I&#x27;m using it on faith!  I tried it in the past alone, but didn&#x27;t notice a difference.  So I stopped using it.  But recently, L&#x27;Oreal Paris came out with the Advanced Haircare Volume Filler Thickening Shampoo, conditioner, fiber amplifying concentrate in shower treatment. I have been using those (one bottle shampoo &amp; conditioner and 4 weeks of the amplifying concentrate) and they work!!  I actually feel the difference in my hair!  It is thicker!  So I bought the Pantene thickening treatment again to add to the effects of the L&#x27;Oreal stuff to see if it makes it even thicker!!  I also bought Rusk thick spray (after gently towel drying my hair, I spray detangler, wide tooth comb through, use the Pantene thickening treatment on the roots, rub that in, use a leave in conditioner or argan oil on my ends, then spray with the Rusk thick spray and blow dry) and noticed the Thick spray does work too - makes the hair feel even thicker!  So hopefully this product will just enhance the effects and thicken my hair.  By the way, in case you are trying to find someone with similar hair to yours, I&#x27;m caucasian, have waist length, natural (no extensions, no dye), fine/thin hair (but lots of hairs on my head if that makes sense).  So basically I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this on it&#x27;s own, but in addition to the other products I mentioned, I think it helps.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had been  looking for a product that would add volume to my hair as it is very fine and flat. Read good reviews on Pantene Pro V Expert Collection AgeDefy Advanced Thickening Treatment, 4.2 fl. Oz. I wasted no time in purchasing. Received product in 2 days with Amazon prime. I used the product for the first time and even though it made my hair feel weird, I guess because it makes ir feel thick, the product actually worked and my hair looked great. The reason I&#x27;m only giving 3 stars is because I hated the look and feel of my hair after the second time I used it. It just made me feel like my hair was dirty. You&#x27;re supposed to use it every day for 3 days to keep the look and feel. I&#x27;ll use it again but not more than 2 days straight.</li>
    <li> After using a &amp;#34;leave in shampoo&amp;#34;  I lost approximately 25% of my hair with evident thinning and parting in the back.  In desperation i stumbled upon the Pantene Age Defy Collection.  I have used this product, their volume shampoo, and gingerly the conditioner as well for a year with excellent results.  There is regrowth now of a few inches, which may or may not be related to this product.  After moving, I went to a new hairdresser, who greeted me with &amp;#34;Come over here and let me get my hands on that beautiful thick, gray hair!&amp;#34;  That was music to my ears!</li>
    <li> I love the Age Defy shampoo and conditioner, but this gel doesn&#x27;t appear to provide any volume at all - and makes my head itch.</li>
    <li> Compared to Nioxin, its somewhat the same, this is less expensive but I am not convinced my hair is any better overall.</li>
    <li> I love products that actually do what they&#x27;re supposed to do, and this is one of them.  Easy to use and great results.</li>
    <li> I think this stuff works, I have waist length thick but fine hair and it is hard to get the volume I want, but the shampoo conditioner and serum together seems to make my hair a lot more willing to do the styles I want.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have fine and oily hair. Washing it every day is a must unless I use a dry shampoo. I have found that this product really does what is says it will do. Normally my hair will wimp out and lie flat within a few hours after styling. Now my hair feels fuller, the style last through the day and the next day my hair appears less oilier. Before I had used a lot of mouse and hairspray just get a style to hold in my hair, now I just use a small amount of each. It has been about two months since I began using this treatment and now apply a lesser amount than the directions indicate. I am very happy with this product and will continue to use it. Hope this review helps.</li>
    <li> For the last few months my hair has felt rough to the touch, breaks easily, and within a few hours of styling my hair was frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;After the first application my hair feels softer and has more volume without frizz.&lt;br /&gt;Didn’t need the whole 15 squirts the instructions called for and I have longer than shoulder baby fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;I am a big fan of Pantene products and I will purchase this item again in the future.</li>
    <li> I have not used this consistently enough to date to give it a fair rating I hope to put it to more frequent use in the future before giving it a plus or minus rating.</li>
    <li> Has made my hair fine thin hair easier to work with, seems to be thickening.  I&#x27;ve only been using for a month but intend to continue.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like it as it didn&#x27;t work as advertised. Would I recommend it to anyone else. No I wouldn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my early 30s and have been dealing with thinning hair for awhile, on the top of my scalp. Dermatologists have told me that there&#x27;s not some underlying medical cause. (I suppose that&#x27;s good news, but I wish that there was some treatment for my hair!) I have tried rogaine, and didn&#x27;t like it because it didn&#x27;t really help me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this Pantene Thickening Treatment for a few months. I use it once a day, after I shower. I have only recently started using it in combination with the shampoo and conditioner from the line. (I&#x27;m never sure if you really need those other products, or if they&#x27;re just trying to sell you more stuff.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I have been pleased with the results. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m regrowing more hair, at least on the very front of my head. I know that this might take longer, and I will be so happy if I do start to re-grow. But I have definitely been noticing that my hair is THICKER. That makes me very happy. I usually wear my hair in a loose bun, and I&#x27;ve been noticing a big difference in the thickness of my bun. My only suggestion for others who use this product is that I find it necessary to wash my hair just about every day. If I skip a day or two, then the product builds up on my scalp (even if I&#x27;ve rubbed it in thoroughly) and you get white flakes that look like dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s enough of an improvement for me to keep using this product. I have also been using Biotin, so that may also be helping.</li>
    <li> I use this product after using AgeDefy shampoo  &amp; conditioner. I&#x27;m  been losing my hair for a few years now. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of other products but none compare to these. It  seems like I have a lot more hair.  I&#x27;m 74 with fine hair that has never been color treated &amp; is mostly dark brown. I would recommend  this product anyone with thining hair.</li>
    <li> I am over sixty, have thinning, graying hair, and have hid it for years under a wig while I tried everything under the sun to get something presentable. I tried the whole Age Defy combination of shampoo and conditioner and serum, and was disappointed, but when I used the Pantene Color Safe for Increased Body shampoo and conditioner in combination with the Age Defy serum and Tresemme  Thermal Creations Volume Boosting mousse after shampooing, I finally had success!(I had been using the Color Safe shampoo and volumizing mousse with very modest success before trying the serum.)  The wig has disappeared and everyone I know is asking who does my hair! (I am the only one who touches it - I cut and style it, and use no color!) I shampoo about every 2-3 days, depending on the weather and how active I am outdoors, and use the serum as directed every morning. It doesn&#x27;t regrow hair, but it does make mine attractive enough that I am finally happy to show it off after years of hiding. Everyone&#x27;s hair is different, and one person&#x27;s success might not be another&#x27;s.  I learned from years of trying what works for me and what doesn&#x27;t.  Amazon&#x27;s prices are so good, if you need something like this, it&#x27;s worth a try!</li>
    <li> the reviews lead me to believe that this product would produce a significant difference in my hair.  All I can say is its OK.  I have always had fine, thin hair.  This helps a little...but really no better than a good volumizing mousse.  I see suggested retail on this product is $20.  Lets just say I am REALLY happy i didn&#x27;t pay $20 for this or I would be really upset.  Glad it was only a bit over $5.  But I would not order it again.</li>
    <li> Not sure what I expected this product to do but I don&#x27;t feel like it did much.  I used it daily until I ran out but I don&#x27;t feel my hair got noticeably thicker or that I stopped loosing as much hair.  Do not think I will buy it again but I&#x27;m not sorry I tried it.</li>
    <li> This stuff works! Wonder!!!!!!! I love it! My hair has improve since using the product!!!! It has gotten thick I love it!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s too bad I can&#x27;t find this anywhere locally because it really works. Really - as well or better than the salon brand products you get at Ulta or Sephora and at a fraction of the price. I have fine, thin hair, but you&#x27;d never know it when I wear this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m just 26 but I have thin hair. I use this product as a root lifter to add volume to my hair and it really works. It makes my hair soft and gives nice volume. I would say it works best on dry hair. It really lifts them up from the roots and makes them look thicker!</li>
    <li> This does nothing for me whatsoever.  Not sure if I didn&#x27;t receive original product or what (this unfortunately has happened before when purchasing from Amazon..) but I might as well use water. The good thing is that it doesn&#x27;t make my hair brittle or sticky or leave a coating like others have mentioned (like I said, no better than water..), but it also does nothing to thicken my hair. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> My stylist is somewhat critical of Pantene products, so i was skeptical, but decided to try their AgeDefy Thickening treatment after reading a review in a beauty mag. Wow - I am so glad I did!  It has given me more volume than products 5x the price ever achieved.  I&#x27;m not sure why it isn&#x27;t more popular or readily available in my local stores, but I will definitely be buying more.</li>
    <li> The product works well, I did not see my hair regrown but I noticed that my hair stopped to fall. What I did not like was the perfume on it, for me it was way too strong. My opinion is if you do not have problem with strong essence so it is the product for you. Again, a believe it will work, It is just not for me because my allergy to perfume.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not sticky like other products and easy to use. The fragrance is not over powering and I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so envious of all the reviewers who have had excellent results from this product but I&#x27;ve found it to be worthless for me.  I have always had baby fine, thin, straight, fly away hair which is now thinning on the top and sides.  I can see my scalp easily through my hair so I&#x27;d hoped this would make the scalp a bit less visible.  It doesn&#x27;t.  In fact after shampooing and using the product daily for 14 days my hair looks thinner than ever and has absolutely no lift or volume.  My hair looks better if it isn&#x27;t shampooed daily. When it is shampooed daily it&#x27;s totally limp and flat. Something in the product makes my scalp look quite pink for a while.  Perhaps it&#x27;s the alcohol stimulating the scalp?  Back to the drawing board I guess.  How disappointing!</li>
    <li> I use it everyday and it seems to be helping my hair a little each time I use&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> used daily and could not see any difference</li>
    <li> Does make hair seem thicker. Does not cause new hair growth, but definitely improves appearance of hair. Have to make it part of evening beauty regimen for best results.</li>
    <li> Did not like it made my hair feel coated and sticky. I did not like the feel or smell of this product. I did not like that you had to apply it daily.</li>
    <li> It Works!  Gave me enough body to cut my hair three inches shorter and now it looks so full.  I use about 10 sprays..</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t notice any difference at all in my hair. I used to really love Pantene products but this is the second one I have purchased that doesn&#x27;t do what it claims to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is fine and wavy. This just didn&#x27;t do anything at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointing</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d say I have a normal head of hair, but I&#x27;d also call my hair fine. Baby fine, wavy hair. Like cobwebs, but without the creepy, sticky texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product made no difference whatsoever. I&#x27;ve been using it for four weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It cost nearly $20, and some time applying to selective &amp;#34;parts&amp;#34; in my towel dried hair (above the ear, as directed.) I even experimented with spraying the product onto my fingertips and massaging it into my scalp near my neck. The only actual perk of using this product is that the denatured alcohol kept my roots from looking dirty - which is a plus for those who find that daily shampooing dries out the ends of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing. Nada. Zip. Won&#x27;t be buying any more of this glorified root lift.</li>
    <li> I have fine, thin hair and this really works great.  I have tried everything and I finally found a product that makes my hair feel thick. I will make sure I have plenty on hand.</li>
    <li> I was excited to get this product. The first time I used it, I washed my hair, applied the product as instructed and there was an intense stinging or burning sensation. The only way I can describe it like a reaction to the product. At that time you&#x27;d think I would have washed it out but I didn&#x27;t. I haven&#x27;t had that problem since just that first time. My hair does appear thicker at least.</li>
    <li> I use as described and I see no difference except my roots are clumpy, even after brushing it out after drying. Additionally, in the last week I have noticed that everywhere I used this product, I get a white paste. Very embarrassing to have noticed this at work; where it ran down my forehead, a white paste. Along my part, a white paste. What&#x27;s up with that? Will not be using it after washing my hair anymore; only sometimes at night before washing in the morning. And when this bottle is gone, I won&#x27;t buy any more. I have noticed no positive change in my hair and the bottle is half gone.</li>
    <li> Received this product well. It seems to work somewhat, making my hair seems thicker on top. I sure hope it does a lot more and perhaps permanent thickness. Thank you.</li>
    <li> This really does make thin, fine hair look fuller, thicker, better.  It&#x27;s expensive if you use it lavishly, but worth every penny.  I notice it right away if I skip using it for two days.</li>
    <li> This product makes it look like I have more hair.  It&#x27;s easy to use.  I won&#x27;t go anywhere without it.  It doesn&#x27;t dry the hair like some hair thickening products.  The most important beauty product I own.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works well (to my surprise). It makes your hair fuller and softer.  I don&#x27;t use as much as they tell you to (up to 15 squirts per hair section), I only use 3-4 squirts. I have short hair. You can barely see my scalp.  Will buy again, but the grocery store or pharmacy is half the price of Amazon.</li>
    <li> I used the whole bottle but, it did not make any changes to my hair.</li>
    <li> OMG- this was the worst experience ever. I used this on my fine highlighted hair to add volume. It looked great, fluffy, full- I was very pleased and then- wham! It started to burn- not itch but BURN. Everywhere I had put it on top of my head above my ears. I waited an hour hoping it would go away because it looked good. No way. Just got worse. Finally I rinsed it in cold water- over and over again. Still burning. So I got my aloe plant and put some gel on my scalp. A little better but still burning. Went to the pharmacy the next day to look for a treatment or something and they advised me to take an allergy pill which I did. 12 hours later the burning finally stopped. Please note- I have never been allergic before to any hair product. I have used ones with caffeine and alcohol before. The pharmacy said that a lot of people have problems with Pantene because there are so many chemicals in it. Please be forewarned.</li>
    <li> I did not notice instant results, but after about 2 to 3 weeks my edges were noticeably thicker. I do think with continued use it helps to thicken the hair over time.</li>
    <li> I had very high hopes for this based off of the reviews and all the hype it was getting in magazines. Although I used it as the directions stated, it left my fine hair no more tick, plumped, or volumized than anything else I&#x27;ve tried. It does smell nice, and will blow dry relatively fine out of my hair (no real stickiness or crispiness). Alas, it does not give the extreme thickness or volume I was hoping for, so I will not buy this again, and the hunt continues.</li>
    <li> I will order and reorder this item.....I do not like  it-----I LOVE it. Take it on trips and won&#x27;t go without it!!!!!</li>
    <li> Good product.  It&#x27;s not messy.  AND IT WORKS!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t see a lot of difference but it does no harm.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after trying things like ovation and keranique and it worked IMMEDIATELY! This product is wonderful and I couldnt be happier. I have really thing, lumen hair on the sides of my head and it makes me look almost bald. I tried this product not thinking it woudl work and I will never be embarrassed to wear a pony tail again. HIGHest of recommendations.</li>
    <li> WHEN THE PRICE IS DROPPED ON THIS PRODUCT I WILL RECOMMEND IT TO MY MANY FRIENDS.  IT IS TRULY A THICKENER.</li>
    <li> This product does not do what it describes.  Do not waste your money.  I have fine, slightly thinning hair, and was hopeful that this may help the situation a bit.  I wasn&#x27;t looking for \\&quot;wow\\&quot;, just a little something.  But apparently all that got thicker was Proctor &amp; Gamble&#x27;s bank account, thanks to my $22 purchase.  If you really have thin or fine hair, you&#x27;d be better off buying rogaine at a similiar price - at least it has a chance of working.  I love Pantene conditioners, but this stuff is junk.</li>
    <li> Use it every time I wash my hair...with my thin, fine hair...I need the volume.</li>
    <li> Alcohol stings sensitive scalp</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  It gives my baby fine hair a thicker, fuller, look and feel,  while being weightless and making it feel very soft. I love it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about 2 weeks now.  I don&#x27;t know how long to wait for results but I&#x27;m definitely going to keep using it.</li>
    <li> I really think it&#x27;s working. My hair looks so much fuller (when I remember to use it every day).</li>
    <li> Pantene Pro-V AgeDefy Advanced Thickening Treatment did a wonderful job thickening my hair. I am more than pleased with what it did. I will be ordering more when I run out.</li>
    <li> I definitely noticed that less hair fell out in the shower when I started using this product but overall it didn&#x27;t make my hair feel fuller. Now that I&#x27;m done using it, more hair is falling out again but I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll re-purchase.</li>
    <li> I have thinning baby fine hair this is the first thickening product I have ever used that did not weight my hair down or make it look greasy. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Sorry, Pantene Pro-V Expert Collection AgeDefy Advanced Thickening Treatment.  You do NOT do what your description says you do.  I faithfully used this product on the roots of my hair to supposedly give my hair lift and body.  It did NOT happen.  I am bitterly disappointed as this was a somewhat costly purchase.  It absolutely does nothing to give your hair any body, and I will throw it away.  What a rip-off.</li>
    <li> I was very excited the first few times I tried this product because my hair felt thicker than normal.  It created some volume that my hair normally doesn&#x27;t have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is very fine but has some curl to it, and when I put this product on the first time, my hair appeared to be thicker but it was difficult to keep it curled.  I opted for a wavy style in order to keep the volume and it worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I continue to use it hoping for better results but I think this is all I&#x27;d get.  Though it still gives some volume to my hair -despite the weighing down, it has not really improved the overall thickness of it.  Once I wash this off, the faux volume goes down the drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also noticed that my hair is a bit drier than normal and I wonder if it is because the first ingredient is alcohol.  I had bigger expectations but I think I will not be buying this product any time.</li>
    <li> This really works,,,I&#x27;m going to use it only for special occasions as if you use it daily it doesn&#x27;t work as well. My hair is very, thin and oily, and first time I used it I didn&#x27;t have to shampoo my hair for 4 days,,And it actually looked twice as thick! That was the best, as now if I am traveling for a few days at a time I will use an hair will look great...Good product</li>
    <li> Really works if you use it as directed!</li>
    <li> I began using this product about 8 months ago when I noticed that my hair seemed noticeably thinner on the top of my head.  Since using this treatment I have found that my hair is fuller and I can no longer see scalp showing through my hair.  I have been very pleasantly surprised with the improvement!</li>
    <li> My hair really feels thicker and coated without feeling greasy...i have fine baby hair but lots of it and i really feel like my hair which is down my back to bra strap level has weight....</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair and as I turned 60 noticed the top is getting thin, now I have two issues...honestly, I really have three issues and the third one is the depression I feel over all this!  I am a &amp;#34;product&amp;#34; queen, I try everything!  The Pantene Pro-V scores way above average!  I did try two other products before finding the Pantene.  After the first use I didn&#x27;t see any results, went back and read over the instructions &amp; says to spray each part 3 times...the second time I used it correctly and I could see a big difference (WOW!) &amp; now up to day 10. If you have the same hair issues as me I would strongly recommend you to give this a try.  BTW tried the conditioner and made my hair WAY too soft, tried it again using only on the ends but got the same results.  I follow with Phytovolume actif volumizer spray on the roots for styling.  I strongly recommend the Phyto too, it does what is says...VOLUME!</li>
    <li> After a couple of uses, I gave the product away to a colleague.  I found that it left my hair extremely dry and I had to use an olive oil cream to achieve a semblance of sheen to the hair.  I had so much hope when I saw this product, but I am now using something else to help in hair growth rather than this product which appears to simply add volume.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product.  I have tried every root lifter, hair thickener, mouse, out there.  I could open a beauty supply store with all the products I have.  I bought this on the off chance that it might work.  I saw that Pantene had teamed up with Olay to make this root thickener.  I put the liquid on the tips of my fingers and massaged in to my scalp. After that I kind of fluff it up. If you don&#x27;t do that there is no difference. From what I read it is only for the scalp.  It is a clear liquid, easy to use. There is a smell when first applying however it dissipates quickly.  It made my thinning baby fine hair have so much volume at the roots; my hair seems so much thicker... I was amazed by the difference.  Using this product daily on wet or dry hair; I can no longer see the bare spots on my scalp.  I am thrilled with this new product and am going to stock up.  It seems as soon as something is made that works they change it, i.e. Nioxin, Ojon.  You do have to use it per instructions in the leaflet that comes with the product. I don&#x27;t think it is supposed to be used on the length of the hair. My next purchase will be the shampoo and conditioner.    UPDATE: I have purchased this twice once at Walmart and on line.  I had the two bottles side by side and noticed that one is thicker than the other.  One looks like water, the other thicker one has air bubbles in it.  I now wonder if the first bottle was diluted with something.</li>
    <li> My wife really wanted to try Pantene Pro-V Expert Collection Agedefy Advanced Hair Thickening Treatment.  In her view, it is hard to tell if this product will make your hair look thicker, but it does do a number of other things that are worth mentioning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, her hair is much more fluffy with using this product.  Now does fluffy hair look thicker?  Maybe, but not in the way she expected.  She reports that her hair is much more manageable and looks good for more than one day using it.  She usually has oily hair and using this product helps keep it less oily (even the next day).  Using Pantene Pro-V Expert Collection Agedefy Advanced Hair Thickening Treatment also helps keep the \\&quot;flat\\&quot; hair look away, which does help look hair look thicker too.  The product also smells great (I even noticed).</li>
    <li> I gave this a try after a friend said she&#x27;d read a positive review in a magazine. I am now over 2 weeks into using it, and I am really impressed. My hair really does feel and look thicker and I&#x27;ve had a few people ask me &amp;#34;what I did to my hair&amp;#34; because it looks different. I think the main thing I notice is that the thickness and manageability I get from this actually lasts. I prefer to wash my hair every other day, and other products I use (hair thickening blow dry syrums etc.) last a day but seem to get a little &amp;#34;funky&amp;#34; or wear off the second day. But since using this, my &amp;#34;nice&amp;#34; hair lasts. I do use it every day, as recommended, which means I use it on dry hair every other day. I was initially worried that using it on dry hair would be weird, but it really isn&#x27;t. Will be interested to see how my hair does once we are in the warmer, more humid months.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product because I have always had baby fine hair--the kind where my hairdresser has actually said to me, \\&quot;You grew up but your hair never did.\\&quot; As I hit my 30s and some thyroid and other hormonal issues hit, it started growing even thinner. Eventually it got so bad that if my hair wasn&#x27;t styled right, you could see my scalp in the back of my head. Needless to say, that was rather devastating for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one product that has helped is [[ASIN:B00188IFHS WEN® Lavender Cleansing Conditioner 16oz]], but I still wasn&#x27;t 100% happy with the end result. Well, I can honestly say, having used Pantene AgeDefy Advanced Thickening Treatment for over a month, that I feel like I really AM defying age. With the very first treatment I saw immediate and dramatic results. My hair didn&#x27;t lie so flat against my head and my thin spot was much less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product packaging says that at Day 14 \\&quot;Hair achieves maximum thickness,\\&quot; and to be fair I didn&#x27;t notice much more thickening between Day 1 and Day 14. Nevertheless, I am thrilled enough with the initial results that I will not be without this product again. It is not cheap, but I believe it to be worth every penny it costs. And for me, it lasts a long time. I only need about eight pumps (as opposed to the manufacturer&#x27;s recommended 15 pumps) so a bottle goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A tip: Most hair care products that are applied to my scalp just plaster my hair to my head, and if I apply this product upright, I do find that to be a bit of the case. So here&#x27;s how I use it: I dry my hair (which is long and straight) upside down, with a volume attachment on my hair dryer, until it is almost dry. Then, still bent with my head facing downward, I apply the thickening treatment to my scalp and finish drying that way. When I flip my hair over, Voila! instant volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE this product and can&#x27;t imagine living without it now. I would give it 10 stars if I could. Thank you, Pantene!</li>
    <li> My hair is thinning and I purchased this product to help with that problem.  Only used for a couple of weeks, no results yet but I will love it if it works.  Easy to use.</li>
    <li> It don&#x27;t work.  Don&#x27;t waste your money. I tried it and it didn&#x27;t do a thing.  My hair is thin.  I thought this is what I need because one of the women&#x27;s magazines suggested it.  Money wasted.</li>
    <li> Yes it did my hair looks so much fuller</li>
    <li> I recently purchased Pantene Pro-V Expert Collection Age Defy Advanced Hair Thickening Treatment on a whim thinking \\&quot;I&#x27;ll give it a try\\&quot;.  After almost two weeks of use,  I can definitely say I&#x27;m glad that I did.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is color treated, over 40 and fine.  I am currently growing out the layers and bangs so that adds to the limp lackluster style I&#x27;ve been dealing with of late.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first few uses of this product - as directed, sprayed on my roots and massaged in with my fingertips, I noticed that my hair was looking much, much better throughout the day.  The product does not cause any heaviness in my style which I really like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use my other styling concoctions but this will become an added tool in my daily quest for luscious locks!!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I love the shampoo and conditioner my hair is back to looking thick and shines again, people have made comments on how good its looking. I also have a sensitive skin and this does not make my scalp itchy</li>
    <li> Never mind thinning hair as you age...my hair has always been baby fine. So reading the exaggerated manufacturer&#x27;s claims, such as \\&quot;thickens existing hair, so it&#x27;s as if you have up to 6500 more hair strands,\\&quot; and \\&quot;for hair that acts up to 10 years younger,\\&quot; I could not wait to start my morning regime with Pantene&#x27;s thickening treatment product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself has a subtle appearance and fragrance. I followed the manufacturer&#x27;s instructions exactly. The first couple of days, I did not see a difference; except for maybe the first day I thought my hair looked thicker...self-fulfilling prophecy, perhaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the end of the first week, after I washed and styled my hair, it started to feel limp and look limp too; it also was not easy to manage. So, in all honesty, I could not reach the 14-day manufacturer&#x27;s recommended time frame in order to reach maximum thickness. I went back  to my other thickening products (I have a variety of go-to products on hand).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though most of the other reviewers have raved about Pantene&#x27;s Pro-V Expert Collection Agedefy Advanced Hair Thickening Treatment, I did not achieve any of my desired results. In the thick of it, there&#x27;s no poof to the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stacy Lytwyn, Marketing Guru/Motivational Speaker/Journalist&lt;br /&gt;Author: CONSUMMATE CONNECTICUT: DAY TRIPS WITH PANACHE</li>
    <li> I have very thin and fine hair and try everything I can find.  It&#x27;s not bad, helps some, but it lacks in giving enough extra body.  I&#x27;ll use the two bottles I ordered but will keep looking.</li>
    <li> I have been blessed with what one may describe as &amp;#34;good hair&amp;#34;: straight, shiny, and very thick in my younger days as I had a lot of it.  However, it is also very fine and as I reach my late forties (with the ominous &amp;#34;f&amp;#34; word birthday in my near future) I find my hair thinning, especially around the temples and forehead.  This seems entirely unfair as it has no problem popping out in other places on my head.  Thus far I have used it for slightly more than the fourteen days the ad says it will take for changes to show and, much to my pleasure and surprise, it is actually working!  The hair around both my forehead and temples appears to be much thicker and it is helping with breakage I was getting from styling.  While not the hair of my youth, one can no longer see my scalp around my temples, the area where it was most obvious.  A little of of this product goes a long way.  After almost three weeks of daily use, I have not even reached one quarter of the bottle.  I would guess for the average user, one bottle would last about three months.  Not only am I recommending this to you, I called my sister and recommended it to her.  I will definitely be buying this product again!</li>
    <li> I am only 36 years old but have fine thin hair that got thinner after having my children. I think this product is amazing. My hair is so much fuller and healthier looking. I have tried everything and I finally found the answer.</li>
    <li> Maybe it works for other people, but not for me. It&#x27;s a telatively thick gel and I&#x27;m not sure what it&#x27;s supposed to do, but I have not seen any results at all. Nice smell though.</li>
    <li> I am 62 years old, with white hair (wouldn&#x27;t color it) and although I always had fine, THICK hair that is now a thing of the past!  Although I still have a good head of hair, the scalp is showing through more on the top of my head! BUMMER! I purchased the Pantene Pro-V Expert Collection Agedefy Advanced Thickening Treatment and was AMAZED, literally!!(my hair appeared THICKER at the scalp and no more embarrassing pink areas on the top of my head) In one treatment, it seemed to thicken the \\&quot;look\\&quot; of my fine hair! I have always received compliments even in the grocery store on my long, white hair and this \\&quot;product\\&quot; has brought it back to its former glory. I can go 2 days with the Thickening Treatment producing those glorious effects before washing. I am absolutely SOLD on this product for me! Thanks, Pantene for making the Agedefy Advanced Thickening Treatment and THANK YOU, AMAZON, for selling it at such competitive prices!&lt;br /&gt;(Remember, women in your sixties, that experts [found on the instructions on the Agedefy Thickening Treatment] say when your hair now grows in it comes in FINER at our age than when younger!)</li>
    <li> This product really works well and results are as stated by company.  I use it daily along with this brand&#x27;s shampoo and conditioner and have so far (2 months) had very positive results</li>
    <li> I was very pleasantly surprised at the outcome I am getting from the Pantene Pro-V Expert Collection Age Defy Advanced Thickening Treatment.  After two weeks, I am finding that my hair looks thicker at the scalp.  I am using the treatment with the Age Defy Shampoo and Conditioner.  My hair has more body, a lot less flyaways, and feels and looks softer.  I think this one is a keeper.</li>
    <li> Upon reading about this product it sounded as if this would be great for my hair since I have noticed it thinning quite a bit.  I use it daily but I have not received  the thickening as desired.  I look forward to my continue use of this product because I think that it is great.</li>
    <li> I received this from Amazon Vine to review.  I have always had baby fine and thin hair. Getting older makes it even thinner and finer! I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot because I&#x27;m pretty much the perfect customer for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The box says to use fifteen pumps over your head from front to back. That&#x27;s easy enough but it will take you another 5 or so minutes in the morning to apply and spread the product throughout the hair. You can apply it to dry hair too. I have but it leaves a residue like mousse or hair gel. This product does have a pleasant but soft scent that doesn&#x27;t make me sneeze-PLUS!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use it every day, but when I do my hair is fuller and has much more body. Not as full as I wish it would be, but it is noticeable. Daily use is encouraged to get the full benefit of this product, so I&#x27;m sure that would make even more of an improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is a little high but I think its worth it. I&#x27;ve used a lot of pro and drugstore products that didn&#x27;t&#x27; deliver on the promises they made.  This product does create some volume and doesn&#x27;t make the hair stiff like mousse can.</li>
    <li> I have very thin, fine hair.  I have been using this about 2 to 3 weeks, and I can tell a difference in the feel of my hair.  There is a look of more fullness, too.  I&#x27;m really loving what it&#x27;s doing for my hair.</li>
    <li> Seems to work well, hair feels thicker and softer.</li>
    <li> I like Pantene products and so decided to take a chance on this hair thickening treatment and thus far, I&#x27;m not disappointed.  It has made my hair thicker, or at least I think so, but what happens when I stop using it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My box did not come with instructions so I followed what the bottle said to do.  Perhaps I used too much product but after three days use, my hair, although thicker, had lost its usual shine.  And, one thing which I did not like at all was the scent.  I use perfume all the time and I could not distinguish between the Pantene and my Guerlain perfume, which I much prefer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If my hair is thicker in six weeks than it is now, I&#x27;ll buy a bottle to continue the thickening process.  But, if not, well I&#x27;ll just cough it up to nothing ventured, nothing gained.</li>
    <li> Results and reviews for this product will likely vary depending on hair type and length.  I have long hair, which generally makes my hair look normal in thickness when I wear it down, but it&#x27;s not.  My sides are more thin than the back and nape of neck area.  I use this product primarily (following the directions) on my scalp on the sides (above ears), my bang area and along my defined part.  These are the areas that I feel are the more thin and limp.  The amount you need to use will depend on your hair.  I probably use 4-5 pumps on each area  - carefully parting, spraying, and rubbing into my scalp when hair is damp.  I love this product because it is not thick, gel-like, sticky or irritating. I&#x27;m the kind of customer who can&#x27;t stand using those type of products.  Oh sure, I have a counter full of them because I try many with hopes of it working, but goo, sticky or waxy just doesn&#x27;t work for me.  Compared to other popular products, I do not think the scent is overwhelming or clashes with perfume or cologne.  If you&#x27;ve used other Pantene products, you can expect basically the same type of scent.  I am sensitive to many products and this does not irritate my scalp even during the dry, winter months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend putting on damp hair and then blow-drying for best and fullest results.  I&#x27;ve put on damp hair and let air dry, but did not get the optimal result.  At first, I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was losing less hair, but then I did notice my brush truly did have less strands in it, less on my shoulders after blow drying and less on the bathroom carpet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will your hair feel and look super thick?  Um...no, but it will look like you&#x27;re having a good hair day and you will notice less shedding hairs with use of this product.  Also, it did not make my particular hair, which is fine and dark look greasy at all.  I think if this occurs, just cut back on the amount you&#x27;re using.  I will be buying and using this product in the future.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really see how it can thicken the hair as is claimed but regardless, it APPEARS to thicken the hair. As we age women lose their hair fairly evenly over the head so that our not-so-lovely pink scalps show through our hair styles. After one use this product seemed to cover up those spots.  It will cost you about $18 a month to keep using it but for me it is really worth it. I&#x27;m very happy with this product. I should mention that I don&#x27;t think my hair is as shiny, but personally I&#x27;d rather have hair that covers my scalp</li>
    <li> I am amazed; I did not expect to be.  I massage (aaah) the gel on just on the top and sides of my scalp (I have shoulder length/board straight natural blonde/gray hair &amp; am in my late 50s) and let dry. Later, I add a bit of water to the top/sides and do a quick blowdry.  Viola! Instant volume and thickness.  It did take a few wks to get to this point. I am a realist and know I will never get my scalp to fill in completely, but this is like a miracle. Don&#x27;t worry about the pleasant smell...it goes away for those who don&#x27;t like it. Chill, people...this goes on easy and it will become part of your quick daily routine...not hard at all to apply (like some folks relate...geez), is not goopey (IT IS A GEL for goodness sake)!  I LOOOOVE it and will never be without.</li>
    <li> I know this is an age defy product but I was using it on my daughter&#x27;s hair which is thin, fine, and long.  There isn&#x27;t much to it and would love to see some volume to her hair.  I was hoping that Pantene Pro V Thickening Treatment would help but it hasn&#x27;t made any difference.  I pump the product on her hair part and along her hair line and massage it in with my fingers before coming it out.  Her hair air dries and then looks like it always does.  I may try blow drying it to see if that has any change but not holding my breath.</li>
    <li> I had read some reviews on minoxidil (Rogaine) that made me hesitant to try it.  I thought I would try this product to see if it would work before actually using the medicated stuff like Rogaine.  To be fair and just to make sure, I gave this product 4 weeks to work.  I thought I would see a difference in my hair at the end of that time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pantene Age Defy Advanced Hair Thickening Treatment is cool on application; it was cold when I first put it on because we&#x27;re in the dead of winter right now, so if you have a lotion warmer that takes bottles, it might be a good idea to warm it a little as it was shocking to the scalp when I first put it on.  The nozzle protrudes half an inch out, so if you read the instructions and follow them, i.e., use the nozzle to part your hair then squeeze the top, it actually makes it easy to apply. I don&#x27;t have thick hair anymore, so I didn&#x27;t have to clip my hair or what not to get to other parts of my scalp.  I would just use the nozzle to draw a line through my scalp every half inch or so to part the hair, use my other hand to hold the hair, then squeeze the pump along the part to spread the product.  To do the back I just bent my head over and did the same thing. After feeling that my whole scalp is uniformly coated with the product, I massaged my scalp for a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I tried this, I got a slight headache afterwards, maybe because the product was so cold, or maybe because I massaged my scalp too hard.  I read online reviews elsewhere on this product, and it did say that the caffeine in it might cause a mild headache.  I guess it&#x27;s like the stop smoking patch: this product probably releases a small amount of its caffeine into the scalp to promote the hair growth.  (If I haven&#x27;t mentioned it yet, caffeine is the active ingredient in this product.  So if you&#x27;re sensitive to caffeine or react to it, then I suggest don&#x27;t use it at all or, if you still want to use it, apply it in the morning so you at least get the normal benefit of caffeine in the morning.)  I normally apply this every night after shampooing only because I wasn&#x27;t sure if it left some sort of after-smell on the hair that, if mixed with other hair styling products, would leave my hair smelling awful.  The bottle does say you can apply it to your hair before you normally style your hair, but I haven&#x27;t done that.  It&#x27;s very soothing, though, massaging your scalp after applying the product.  I never got the headache again after the first night, so it might not even be connected to this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 4 weeks, my individual hair strands appear the same, but I did see some fine hair growth on the top of my head.  I wouldn&#x27;t even notice if the tiny hairs were not all sticking up.  The new hair growth is finer than my other hair.  I also must mention here that 2 weeks ago my doctor changed my birth control pill.  As every woman knows, hormones also affect hair growth and hair loss, so that change might also have played a factor with the new fine hairs I saw.  Another thing I noticed is that a few days after using this product, the fallout in the shower is not as much as before. The nightly massaging, this product, and my new medication might have contributed to the new hair growth, though, and I&#x27;m hesitant to attribute all the new hair growth to this product without being sure about it, and that&#x27;s why I just rated it 4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m overall satisfied with this product. I would like to see more of a change, though, like no hair fallout in the shower at all like they say you can get from minoxidil. But since this product is not medicated at all, it&#x27;s unrealistic to expect that.  Besides, this costs way cheaper and doesn&#x27;t have the side effects of minoxidil that most people experienced, like the hair fallout that reverts to what it was before they used the product or they totally lose what hair they gained when they stopped minoxidil.  I just added this to my hair care regimen and made it part of my shampoo/conditioner/hair styling shopping list.  I haven&#x27;t stopped using it yet, but I don&#x27;t think there will be much difference in terms of hair growth if I did, but the fallout might revert back to what it was before.  This is a topical non-medicated product, so I feel very safe using it long term, even if the results are far less than what one would expect with a medicated one.</li>
    <li> Love how this product gives my fine hair volume when I style it.</li>
    <li> It seems to work pretty well. My hair has thinned due to medications, but it feels fuller since I started using this.</li>
    <li> Amazingly I do notice a difference. I have very fine, thin hair that is also quite short. I apply it to the root as suggested and it definitely adds body without feeling gooey and clumpy.</li>
    <li> I am still using my first bottle, but so far, I think it works. My hair is fuller, nd I feel more confident. The problem is Thst my scalp has been super itchy. After reading previous reviews, I think it must be the alcohol. And I do use a leave on conditioner from another company because my hair felt like it needed it. I love the product so much though, I might use the cream conditioner that goes with it to see if that help.</li>
    <li> Very fine thin oily hair also color treated and very long. This has made a wonderful improvement in dullness, fuller hair, manageability  I have seen less hair loss in my brush. And oddly I don&#x27;t have nearly as much oil production in between washes and can go longer without needing dry shampoo or a wash. That&#x27;s an excellent perk. It has a very strong alcohol odor to me as that&#x27;s the first infredient. Some may find it drying but as noted I have very oily hair so I personally find it a plus. My hair appears much thicker and styling is just easier due to the strands being plumped up. I don&#x27;t notice this continues after I wash until I put the product back in my hair when wet. I notice the best results tho in day two three after I wash as opposed to putting it on freshly washed wet hair. Rarely do I find a hair product I will repurchase. However this has worked so well I will continue to buy. It&#x27;s easy to use as the longer nozzle allows easier placement at the roots. I do half squirts all over after randomly sectioning  with my fingers and nozzle. Then rub in on that area before putting more product on the next section. It works much easier and it dries quite fast. A full squirt is too much imo for me so half works better. And it&#x27;s still super fast.</li>
    <li> I actually think this product helped my very fine hair.  Just not sure if I need to keep using it or does the hair reach a certain point and then the product doesn&#x27;t work any more?  Not sure.</li>
    <li> Thicker &amp; Fuller!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am on my third bottle and have had exceptional results!!! I have always looked for a product that I would not have to wash my hair and apply gel every morning to get the fuller appearance that I desired. I simply spray Pantene on the roots of my hair and rub and style my hair with my fingers. I have short hair and it works perfectly.[[ASIN:B0098JU8TC Pantene Pro-V Expert Collection AgeDefy Advanced Thickening Treatment, 4.2 Fluid Ounce]]</li>
    <li> Makes my hair look fuller, would buy again.</li>
    <li> If you need to perk up your hair and add a little shine to it as well, look no further.  Rather than water, use a couple squirts of this in the palm of your hand and carefully add to hair, running it through your entire head of hair slowly to cover all the strands and maximize the thickening power.</li>
    <li> I have been using the treatment for just over a month, and am very happy with the results. Being in my 60s,with breaking,long ,dyed ,grey hair,I needed help. This treatment is wonderful,easy to use,and affordable.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say that I have seen any difference from using it so that is disappointing.  I still use it though.  I gave it a 3 because there is no odor which is nice and it does not cause flaking as some products do.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair look like I haven&#x27;t wash it.  Tried a small amount - that did nothing. Tried a little more, still nothing.  Added a little more and my hair looked dull and even felt kind of sticky.  Don&#x27;t know what some of the reviewers raved about.  Won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff and it actually works. Makes my hair feel great and look great.</li>
    <li> Though I am not &#x27;aging,&#x27; my hair is very fine and thin looking.  I have tried every type of volumizing and thickening shampoo, conditioner, spray mousse, you name it...  I haven&#x27;t found many that actually work without leaving my fine hair with a sticky or heavy residue.  My hair falls flat very easily and it takes a really supreme product to actually create a thick/volumuous style.... and this one just doesn&#x27;t do it. Also, I&#x27;ve never been impressed with Pantene in general because they tend to use silicones, SLS, alcohol - basically ingredients that will likely damage your hair over the long term.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you have fine, limp and/or oily hair, this product will probably not help you thicken or give you a volume boost.  But, maybe it works better on those who have thick strands of hair.</li>
    <li> Though it says it&#x27;s safe for dyed hair it is NOT!  My dyed-haired sisters beware.  I used it once and noticed a very strong smell of alcohol.  I used 1/2 the recommended amount and within a few minutes noticed that my roots had been stripped.  I was close to needing a touch-up (thank god) but the little bit of gray that had been showing was now a full-on strip o&#x27; gray.  Sending it back.  Thankfully Amazon has a great return policy!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried the Diamax hair thickener, and while its good, this one simply works better for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s nonsticky, and just disappears into my hair and I can use it whether my hair is wet or dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair gets frizzy in humid weather, so if your hair has more texture, you might not like this product as much as I do. Overall recommended.</li>
    <li> i love this I can really feel a difference in my hair it seems to have so much more body, I am thrilled I have very fine hair, thank you Pantene</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 38 years old and after having two children in the last 5 years, my once thick and shiny hair is much thinner and has lost a lot of it&#x27;s shine and luster. Childbirth combined with age have left my hair flat, slightly frizzy and dull. The first two times I tried this spray I didn&#x27;t see any difference, but the third time I used it I was super impressed with how much thicker my hair looked and felt and my normally flat hair had some texture. My hair hasn&#x27;t looked this thick and full since I was in my 20&#x27;s. Also, when the spray is applied to the scalp there is a cooling sensation that I find very pleasing. After using this spray for about a month, I&#x27;m so pleased with the results and the only downside is that it dulls what little shine my hair has left. If you want noticeably thicker hair and are less concerned with shine, then this product is truly great.</li>
    <li> I have dreadfully fine, straight hair and I can never resist a commercial for a new miracle hair product so after seeing the ads for this one and not finding it locally, I was happy to find it on Amazon.  It is a product that you have to use everyday - on either dry or wet hair - and then can use your regular styling products and methods.  It seems in about a week you get the max performance.  If you stop using it you will notice it.  If it helps my pathetic hair, I&#x27;m sure it will be great for people with better hair! I think I will have to keep using it forever.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I have fine hair, but can&#x27;t use most volumizers because they irritate my skin.  I noticed more volume immediately, but got the full effect after a week or so.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The best product from pantene, i love it, and that price is so good too, in wallgreens it cost 20 dollars.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something that worked for my hair and this stuff really does the trick.  I ordered it again after getting the first shipment.</li>
    <li> I think this product makes my hair look thicker.  I will continue to use it.  Great for fine thin hair.</li>
    <li> Good product but not what I really need.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Pantene products for a long time, but this was the first one that did not do what it was touted as being able to do.  It is essentially a very expensive root lifter, but it leaves a gunky feel and is dulling.  I paid the full early price and wrote to Pantene to ask for a refund, which they sent.  It was just too pricey to toss without recompense.</li>
    <li> I do have fine, thin hair which certainly has only gotten thinner as I&#x27;ve aged.  I love the AgeDefying shampoo and conditioner and added this to my hair care regime.  I wash my hair every other day and the product recommends that you use it every day.  My hair is very oily even though I&#x27;m over 60.  If I use this on the day I don&#x27;t wash my hair, it makes it appear even oilier.  So I use it only after shampooing.  I put the product on in 4 or 5 different sections and then rub my fingers under my hair to distribute the product along my scalp.  I allow a few minutes for the product to absorb before I add my normal mousse and then blow dry as normal.  It does make my hair look fuller and adds that little bit of height to the top of my head that was exactly what I&#x27;ve been wanting.  Since I started using the AgeDefying products, I have noticed a significant reduction in the amount of hair in the drain trap and also on my brushes.</li>
    <li> My order was delivered quickly and my hair appeared much thicker with the first use.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product as part of the 3 piece Pantene Prov Age Defy Collection, I used the Pantene Pro V Age Defy Shampoo and  Conditioner with this product Pantene Pro-V Age Defy Advanced Thickening Treatment. I have been using this product for about 1 month now, 3-4 times per week after shampoos. I noticed a great deal of difference in the look and feel of my hair and am very happy with the shine and healthy look and  feeling I have received since use. However, my hair is thin and has been getting thinner with age. I was hoping this product would aid me on making my hair look thicker. I have noticed a very slight improvement. It is making my hair look much better so I will continue using it, I am hoping with longer use my hair will appear to look thicker.</li>
    <li> I have been using this now for about 4 weeks.  I do think that I am noticing less hair in my brush and I also feel that my hair does have a bit of a thicker feeling.  I have baby fine hair and also have sensitivity to products but this seems to be working out for me.  I am definitely planning to continue using it.</li>
    <li> I tried this product after seeing it in my local CVS. I had not read any reviews of it prior to my purchasing it. While I was not especially impressed by the shampoo and conditioner I feel the thickening treatment more than lived up to the advertising!! I typically wash my hair every other day. Because of the thin and flat texture I usually have to work hard to make it look full and healthy on that second day. With the Pantene thickening treatment used daily my hair now has a full and healthy look every day!!  It is shinier and feels so thick to the touch.  I am very pleased with the product and will be ordering more soon!</li>
    <li> There are so many products that promise sooooo much, and do not deliver. This product is fabulous, and like I said in the &amp;#34;HEADLINE&amp;#34;, it works!</li>
    <li> I love the Product because it DOES what it says! I will keep buying it!  It can be used on wet or dry Hair.</li>
    <li> have spent a small fortune on hair products for my fine, thin hair, this one does the trick! recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical that this hair treatment would do much if anything but to my surprise it has made my hair thicker and is better looking in some thinner spots.  I was sure of this when my hairdresser at my last appt. asked me if I was using something different on my hair because it looked thicker.  I hadn&#x27;t mentioned to her that I was using the product so I was pleasantly surprised when she said this.  She told me to keep doing whatever I was doing because my hair looked better.  So I will definitely continue to use this Pantene product.  Thanks Pantene!</li>
    <li> This product helps make my hair appear thicker,  especially on the back . It is convenient and easy to use on bad hair days.</li>
    <li> This gel was featured about 18 months ago on the Today show, for giving hair a thicker, fuller appearance.  It really does work, and I am happy with it.  In order to keep the thicker effect, it&#x27;s necessary to use the treatment daily.  It doesn&#x27;t matter if you use it on wet or dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind the hair will APPEAR to be thicker and fuller.  The Pantene treatment does not actually make your hair come in thicker, but it temporarily swells the hair shaft so that it looks thicker.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The thickening treatment does make my hair looks noticeably thicker after using.  I had people comment about how thick my hair looked right away.  It has a nice smell too.  Tne bottle last several months so a little goes a long way.  Well worth the money!</li>
    <li> I always had tons of hair, but due to illness my hair has gotten thinner over the last couple of years.  After reading all the positive reviews I had high hopes and couldn&#x27;t wait to try this product.  When I ordered from Amazon I thought I&#x27;d found a gonga deal as one of the offers was for nine dollars and some change with only 99 cent shipping.  This was the lowest price and I&#x27;ve always had good luck shopping on Amazon.  I assumed their sellers had all been vetted so it never occurred to me to check further before ordering.  The product arrived in an envelope with zero padding or protection (for a bottle of liquid).  It was not in the box so the instructions that the bottle said to follow were also missing.  The bottle was not as full as it should have been and was crudely taped shut.  I wasn&#x27;t convinced that the bottle I received even contained the product it was supposed to so not being sure what it might be I did not use it.  So I would say if you&#x27;re going to order avoid Third Heaven Discounts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I straightened this out with Amazon (who has excellent customer service in situations like these) and bought a bottle from Target.  After all the anticipation of finally using a product I was now convinced would be the answer to my hair volume issue...what an anti-climax. I followed the directions carefully but I could have achieved the same volumizing results had I used plain water.  The only thing it did was make my hair slightly greasy feeling.</li>
    <li> I have ultra-fine hair. I am so glad I discovered this product! With regular use, it thickens each hair strand and helps prevent breakage, too. And it&#x27;s not just my imagination - out of the blue recently, my hairdresser commented that my hair seems much thicker. I have finally been able to grow my hair longer with the use of this product. I will keep buying this product the rest of my life as long as it&#x27;s available. I highly recommend this to anyone with fine hair. This is the best beauty secret ever.</li>
    <li> This product got great reviews in Allure magazine, I agree with other customers. Will definitely order this hair product again.</li>
    <li> I like this product, my hairs look thicker just make them a little oily that is why I gave it 4 star!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for the last two years. It&#x27;s helped restore my hair and has made it a little thicker. It&#x27;s not a miracle worker but it does help. I&#x27;ve been buying it in stores and just recently discovered it&#x27;s sold here. I will be buying from this site from now on.</li>
    <li> Happen to put Dr. Oz on one afternoon and heard  how this product would be beneficial to giving hair a less thinning look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really does work.</li>
    <li> Worst of all was it had a bad reaction to my scalp, it made me break out in a rash-like pimples and scalp visibly red. HORRIBLE STUFF! Sorry, but it just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> Product wasn&#x27;t bad.  It gave you a lift and a fuller look but seem to make hair a little dull.  I use it every once and awhile when I feel like a fuller look when curling hair.  I would recommend to at least try it, might work differently on others.</li>
    <li> I use this every time I wash my hair and I swear it makes my hair fuller.  I have fine, thin, colored/highlighted hair.  After washing, I spritz a few times along part lines, wait a couple of minutes, use my styling gel and my hair is ready to style.  Every day use is too much for my hair but if I need a quick perk-up between washing, this does the trick.  But, I have to wash my hair the next day for sure.</li>
    <li> Sadly even though this comes highlighly recommended by good house keeping it did not work on my fine curly hair. So I will give this product a miss</li>
    <li> This is the only hair product I can say with 100% certainty makes a difference in my hair...IMMEDIATELY. I only use this on days that I wash my hair and do it after I&#x27;ve detangled my hair, before it has dried. I only use 5 pumps total on my scalp above the ear line because I have extremely fine hair, so I don&#x27;t need a lot of any products. I don&#x27;t like this on dry hair because it can get sticky, but I never, ever have a problem when I apply it to my dry hair. I started using this about 2 years ago and have been hooked ever since. Love love love this!!!!</li>
    <li> Since my hair started thinning over ten years ago I have probably tried every product on the market  advertised to thicken thinning hair. This is the first product that actually works. I don&#x27;t know how it works, but it does appear to thicken my hair. People have even commented on how thick my hair is. And by ordering on line through Amazon, I am able to find this product for a fraction of the price it sells for in the stores. (When you can find it in the stores, it does tend to sell out quickly.) Use it as directed, and like magic, your hair will thicken. I highly recommend it!!</li>
    <li> So far I like this.  I&#x27;ve only used it twice but it seems to make my hair look fuller and it feels thicker.  I&#x27;m 48 and am noticing my good hair days are becoming less frequent.  Hopefully it will continue to perform well.</li>
    <li> still hoping it works- the jury is still out</li>
    <li> Never had anything work so well on my hair, and told friends about it and they are believers...</li>
    <li> Makes my thin hair feel lusher</li>
    <li> Did not do anything more than what other products I have used, now and in the past, in fact less.</li>
    <li> Great product. I will order again.</li>
    <li> It really didn&#x27;t do much, but I couldn&#x27;t use it regularly due to the fact, I use Rogaine and Moose along with hair spray and to add more was to drying.</li>
    <li> My hair is beyond baby fine to the point that it is difficult to see a single strand,  I&#x27;m not kidding.  God gave me many wonderful assets but &amp;#34;good hair&amp;#34; was not among them.  Pantene&#x27;s Thickening Treatment is best at strengthening my hair and thereby giving a fuller appearance.  I have tried many expensive products on the market to improve the appearance of my hair and this is as good, if not better than anything I have used.  At this price, I would recommend anyone with fine fair to just try it for 30 days.</li>
    <li> Recommended by a friend with thin, fine hair like mine.  I used as directed twice daily massaging etc.  It left my hair with some volume, and a nice shine, but saw nothing as far as real thickening.  I have moved onto Aveda system for thin hair....very expensive by comparison, so I&#x27;ll finish the products and we&#x27;ll see.  Don&#x27;t really think any of the products really thicken the hair,---I&#x27;m just looking for a little help after being hospitalized and hemoglobin was low....our skin and hair are reflections of what&#x27;s going on inside the body, so i&#x27;m hoping for a little improvement.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used better products by NEXXUS.  This product did not thicken my hair at all.  Not worth the special order.</li>
    <li> I have used this daily for the past month and have not seen any difference with my hair.  In my opinion it doesn&#x27;t work and it&#x27;s expensive.</li>
    <li> I am not sure if this really thickens your hair over the long term, but it definitely gives hair a fuller, thicker appearance without any stickiness.  It&#x27;s super easy to use.</li>
    <li> I am 48, hypothyroid, and recently had surgery for a pelvic mass. Prior to the mass&#x27; discovery, I began losing a lot of hair, far more than ever. Even my 11 year old daughter could see the loss. I bought two bottles of this product for 25 cents a piece. Clearly I plan to go back and buy a lot more. First-time use was tonight. Wow, I can tell a big difference. My hair cut is a rather simple bob with the front part much longer than the back. It falls about 3 inches or so below my chin and is asymmetrical and layered-looking because of my part. I have always had a thick head of hair until I hit my 40s. That is when I saw the greatest thinning of my hair. But this product fluffed up my hair considerably. I do not color my hair though I do have grey &amp;#34;highlights&amp;#34; in the front part. This product softened my hair, gave it a lift so my layers are more visible, and actually holds my hair together, meaning I may not need hairspray to keep my hair out of my eyes. So for a first time use, I really like this product. It has worked better than any other hair thickening product I have used thus far. I hope I continue to have the same results. Prior to using it, I washed my hair with Roux anti-aging shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> I use this product mostly in the front and crown of my head to help me style my fringe off of my face.  I have long hair that can fall in my eyes and this product does seem to thicken up the fringe and keep it back off my face.  And while I don&#x27;t notice much &#x27;thickening&#x27; (I already have fairly thick hair) it does seem to add body.  My hair just seems to go into place and look better when I use this product.</li>
    <li> I first read about this product in a recent issue of _Allure_magazine, where they described it in an article about beauty \\&quot;breakthrough\\&quot; products that were truly different from others on the market.  Since I turned forty last year, I&#x27;ve noticed that my hair has started to thin a bit, so I was eager to try this out, and I like how it plumps up your hair strands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package comes with a detailed set of instructions. To apply this product, you part your hair in sections, and apply three pumps of product to each parted section, for a total of five times (or 15 pumps) to cover your whole scalp. You can use it when your hair is wet or dry, and are supposed to use it once or twice a day.  It&#x27;s also supposedly safe for color-treated hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have fine hair, you need to be careful about using quite that much; the first time I did so, it left my hair a soggy, greasy messy and never absorbed in.  I&#x27;ve found that if I use maybe four partings and around 10 pumps total, I still get good coverage without it looking greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, while this product is supposed to be good long-term for the strength of your hair, the first ingredient listed is denatured alcohol, which is very drying on the hair.  I was surprised to see it listed, and am unsure if it will end up drying out my hair (which can be picky/sensitive about alcohol) over the long haul.  The other ingredients include niacinimide, water-soluble dimethicone (so it&#x27;s Curly Girl-friendly, if you&#x27;re following a no-silicone/no-sulfate hair routine), caffeine, panthenol, some polymers, and fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance in this is also very light and \\&quot;clean\\&quot;-smelling; I really like it, and it doesn&#x27;t interfere with any of my perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update my review to see if I notice any long-term difference, but so far it does thicken up the hair after each use.</li>
    <li> I have always had fine hair and as I age it is getting thinner.  I am always on the look out for a hair product that can give me thicker looking hair and maybe stop me from hair loss.  This product goes on easy, it says to pump it many times where you part your hair, I also put some on other areas also.  Then you massage it in for one minute.  It does not seem greasy at all or too thick, just the right texture for me.  I do not notice any odor also as some have said.  What I really like is that, I can put it on at any time of day and my hair will not look greasy or like I have product in it, in fact, once I style my hair, it looks thicker.  I have seen some improvement and have not noticed bare areas lately.  I know that nothing will give me thick movie star hair. As long as it&#x27;s an improvement and makes my hair seem fuller and no bare areas on my scalp, I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> I am not a big Pantene fan but after reading the article in Allure about this product I had to find it. Walmart was the place I was able to find the display. This isn&#x27;t cheap but if it works I would pay the price. Plus if I didn&#x27;t like it I knew I could return it. So nothing to loose. I also picked up the matching conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the treatment that night like it states. Which is from the ears up on the root area. I didn&#x27;t use as much as it states because I didn&#x27;t want to make my hair greasy or flat. But it dries quickly and not sticky!  As you massage it in you start to see the volume! I have also used it on wet hair and it works just the same.I have not experienced and drying from this product either. I have used it for a week now and must say I am impressed. This is the first line I have ever used from Pantene that is good and works.</li>
    <li> This stuff works. Immediately. Love it and will continus to use it regularly. Havent used it long enough to notice any dulling. Just fullness and bounce. Love it!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome!!! It really does work...I&#x27;ve only used it twice so far and I love it. It really does make your hair look and feel fuller. Not only that but it makes your scalp have a very clean feeling. I have tried everything there is to try to make my hair look and feel healthier including drinking and pouring vinegar on my hair yuckkkkk...I loved it so much I went and bought another bottle in case once my first one runs out and I can&#x27;t find it anywhere. I think if that happened at this point I would probably cry. I also bought a double supply of the shampoo and conditioner in this same line. They are awesome as well and smell really clean. Hope you love it as much as I do. I&#x27;m pretty sure I found my miracle products!!!!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t really reach for this to kno if it works makes my hair feels weird when I do happen to use it</li>
    <li> I have been on some anti seizure medication that causes my hair to thin and break easily.  I have been using vitamins, drinking more water, changing my diet, trying every single hair care product on the market, switched to satin pillowcases, wearing a sleep cap, no heat tools, etcetera for my hair.  My hairdresser told me to keep my hair moisturized in order to stop all the breaking.  I saw this product and thought why not give it a whirl.  I&#x27;m getting married in a year and I would really like to have long healthy locks to style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I have been using the shampoo, conditioner and the thickening serum.  The consistency of the shampoo is very thick and doesn&#x27;t lather like most shampoos.  It rather smooths on.  The conditioner is also very thick and while the bottle does not give any directions to use, my hairstylist recommends letting sit for 3 minutes, combing through with a wide toothed comb and then rinsing with cooler water.  Hot water is your hair&#x27;s enemy.  When I leave the shower I use the anti thickening serum which is a liquid spritz, I spray three spritzes down my center part, and then lift my hair with a comb and spritz several more times along the roots.  I let my hair air dry for about 10 minutes before using any sort or hair dryer or styling aides.  Sometimes I use a blow dry speed up spray from Kenra so that I am not blow drying my hair for extended periods of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this Pantene system for almost four weeks.  I have less hair in my comb.  Less hair pulls out when I take out ponytails.  My hair looks fuller and thicker from the roots all the way down to the ends.  My hair is extremely shiny and bouncy.  My hairdresser wondered how much I was paying to keep my hair moisturized.  My ends are not snagging and breaking like they have in the past, they are very smooth and snag free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is not as flowery as Pantene normally is.  It is very clean as you can expect from Pantene, but not at all overpowering.  This product may or may not reverse aging, but it definitely has kept my hair healthier then it was and it is keeping my dreams alive that I can grow it out.  This product delivers healthy hair.This product may or may not reverse aging, but it definitely has kept my hair healthier then it was and it is keeping my dreams alive that I can grow it out.  This product delivers healthy hair.</li>
    <li> I love Pantene products, but this one is a bust for me. I have straight, fine hair and I&#x27;ve used this product for four straight weeks. I honestly can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s doing anything for my hair. If it is, I&#x27;m pretty much ignorant to it. I can&#x27;t see a difference in growth or thickness. I&#x27;ll keep using it until it runs out. I do have to say that I enjoy massaging it into my hair and feeling that cool sensation. If I notice anything different by the time the product runs out, I&#x27;ll buy another. But so far, nada.</li>
    <li> my hair nature is thin and soft , but latley I started to lose wieght and here the problem statred to lose my hair . after using it I saw alot if changes . defenitly it will be on my regular purchase from now on.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t even get a comb through your hair after using it. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. I threw it out.</li>
    <li> I have noticed that my hair is getting fuller. I am very happy with this product from Pantene Pro-V-Expert Age Defy Thickening treatment.</li>
    <li> Actually performs better! than expected. Read Elle article on this product, before it&#x27;s release to public re/it&#x27;s research development and how it actually works and the item works even better than I had hoped. I have hypothyroidism and have lost a great deal of my previous Really thick head of hair which has been very distressing and article actually made the claim that thinning hair is the biggest cosmetic concern for women. Will def purchase again if it remains at this price</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I am 43 and have thinning hair. I have been using it for about a month and I do think it makes my hair appear thicker. The scent is OK  and I find it easy to apply. Unfortunately, there must be an ingredient that does not agree with me - maybe the alcohol - because my scalp is really itchy and has become irritated, mainly in the front where I tend to apply the most product. So I will have to stop using for awhile. Too bad because I did feel like I saw some results.</li>
    <li> My hair has responded perfectly to this hair treatment.  Even my hair dresser noticed the difference.  My hair is softer and shinier.  I have terrible hair so anything that works is miraculous in my estimation.</li>
    <li> Great product, great price on Amazon. I saved $5.00 per bottle buying in bulk on Amazon. My hair much fuller and easier to style.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure how to feel about this product. I&#x27;ve been using it as the directions say and have yet to see a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 thumb up&lt;br /&gt;1 thumb down</li>
    <li> I found the Pantene Hair thickening Treatment to be easy to use and it had good results.  My hair is a little thin on the crown and I noticed that I had more body in that area.  You can use this product wet or dry, I used it on my wet hair only so I cannot say how well it works on dry tresses.  I noticed my hair held a curl fairly well too.  The one drawback I have was I have very sensitive skin and I noticed for the first few days of use my scalp was a little itchy but I became accustomed to the product after a week without any problems.</li>
    <li> This is a very strange product.  It dispenses like a fine, clear spray.  You apply it directly to your scalp at the roots.  Then you smooth it into your hair and out to the ends.  Let it dry naturally.  It does not leave a noticeable residue on your hair.  It also doesn&#x27;t feel like you need to immediately shampoo it out as you do feel with similar products.  I don&#x27;t notice any odor to the product after a while.  It dries out so you don&#x27;t see it after 10-15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;My issue is that I don&#x27;t seem to notice that it has done anything at all.&lt;br /&gt;I am always cautious about these sorts of things because sometimes I think we see results from something because we are expected to see results.&lt;br /&gt;I am ambivalent about this product.  I really recommend that you save your money.</li>
    <li> I like it but it&#x27;s too time consuming to apply it the way they recommend.  I put it on my fingertips and distribute it through my hair.  I also use a volumizing mousse in addition to this product. It doesn&#x27;t make my baby fine hair too soft and my scalp feels clean.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 weeks and do see a difference.  It&#x27;s not supposed to grow new hair, but I&#x27;m honestly seeing some fuzzy hairs popping up - maybe they were breaking before I started with this product.  My hair seemed to be thinning on the sides but I think it&#x27;s improving so I&#x27;ll continue to use this. daily.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product.  Hair is thicker and easier to handle, all my bald spots are totally cover.  Really love this product.</li>
    <li> I noticed a slight increase in volume.  I alsol need to use a volumizing mouse with this to ge the volume I want.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a month and am very pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to use, gives body and luster to my hair and I have noted that my hair feels thicker and easier to style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike similar products, there is no build up on my scalp and it has not affected the color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product for people with thin, fine hair.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a couple of years now.  At first I was using TOO much! All I do now is 4-5 squirts on the crown of my head and massage it into my scalp. I use almost everyday weather I  wash my hair or not. The most surprising result has been No More Hair in the drain! I don&#x27;t know if it is not breaking off or not falling out but my hair feels and looks fuller. this is a scalp and root product. Don&#x27;t work it into the strands it will just build up. Great product, just can&#x27;t find it in the store anymore.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s so my hair is thiner now. I have very baby fine hair to begin with. I also color my hair, and that doesn&#x27;t make things any better. I used this product just two times and someone complimented me on my hair and asked what I did different! The product is really easy to apply an does not leave my hair feeling weighed down. I also got it for a great price and free shipping! I will definitely be ordering this product again!</li>
    <li> Love it! Unfortunately, I have thinning, fine hair. I bought this product on a whim and I&#x27;m so glad I did! From the very first use, it thickens hair and gives it a healthy shine. I will definitely buy this product again!</li>
    <li> Works wonders.  Very happy with the results in just four weeks!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had thin, fine hair.  I&#x27;m in my thirties now, and it&#x27;s starting to be noticeably thinner and finer in texture.  I had hoped that this product would help.  Sadly, it did not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used the product every day since I bought it - I haven&#x27;t skipped a single day.  I have applied the product according to the accompanying directions each and every time.  Results are supposed to be noticeable fourteen days after first use; I&#x27;m halfway through the bottle (I purchased and started using in mid-January) and nothing has changed. My hair doesn&#x27;t look or feel thicker or fuller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is just a waste of time and money.  It does nothing for the hair apart from give it a funky smell.</li>
    <li> This is the ONLY product I have tried for super baby fine thin hair that actually WORKS. Not greasy. It does not weigh hair down. My hair looks healthy and has stopped breaking off. You don&#x27;t have to be old for this product to make your hair. It would be good for anyone with super baby fine hair.</li>
    <li> This is my first day using the Pantene pro v thickening treatment I am not losing my hair or anything but I have always had very very fine hair I looked up any way possible to thicken my hair that I struggle with everyday until today I found online the Pantene thickening treatment I got the shampoo conditioner and the spray and I have got to say I see a total transformation of my hair in 1 wash!! I would 100% recommend it to anyone looking to try! A little pricy but totally worth it!!!!</li>
    <li> Noticed a marginal difference, but did not leave my hair feeling stickly.  It is too soon to see any real results.</li>
    <li> I had enough product to use one time, but just that one time made a HUGE difference in my normally baby fine hair. As I grow older, my hair gets thinner and thinner. I have tried many products that leave my hair sticky, gooey, and tacky..but not this. My hair is visibly thicker and softer and full of life. I love it love it love it!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Just got it a week or so ago and really like how it makes my hair feel thicker. Whether it thickens it permanently I don&#x27;t know but I am very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not in the age group this product is aimed at, but my hair has been getting finer over the last few years, so I thought I would give it a whirl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, it left my hair dull and feeling really gunky and gross.  It did feel thicker, but the thick feel was because it was coating my hair shafts with a layer of product that dulled my hair&#x27;s shine and made it limp.  Sadly this just didn&#x27;t work out for me.</li>
    <li> I recognized after a couple of uses that this product can deliver. My hair, which has been thinning rapidly and loosing its glory day luster and fullness, appeared to take kindly to the daily use of this product. Of course, the changes are subtle and it does not take a crystal ball to know that the only way it will work is with continuos use. Sort of like Occuvite for the eyes: they provide key ingredients to assist the functions that govern the eye and keep them healthy.&lt;br /&gt;Pantene Pro-V Expert Collectiion Agedefy Advanced Hair Thickening Treatment 4.2 Fl Oz sounded just what the doctor ordered (sort of speak), for with the passing of time, and a light attitude to the kind of things that today have got me quite concerned, suddenly it seems I am racing against time to slow down premature deterioration of my hair, in this case. I am sure it applies across the board: dental, eyes, heart, lungs, there are just too many to count and avoid stressing out, but I did realize that some kind of treatment for the hair was in order.&lt;br /&gt;Once the hair starts loosing ground, and little areas appear more deserted than usual, it is time to act or settle for a hat. I thought this product was the right step, and wether was my intense desire to believe that the product could indeed help, darn it if I did not feel that it was working and I was doing better than before I started using it. But like I mentioned it would be naive to say that with the 4.2 Fl Oz I received thanks to amazon, that my issues were over. Far from it, but I felt that with proper continuous use it had what it takes to deliver health and restore strength to hair that has seen way too many summers and equal inclement weather. Grooming is not an easy thing, and I for one, never did worry past the point of having clean hair, perhaps even using the wrong kind of shampoos along the way. As we all know, not all products are created equal, and some are more equal than others.&lt;br /&gt;So for now, I am giving my vote of confidence to this product to the rating of 4 Stars. Time, of course, might dispel my confidence, or on the other hand, strengthen it like I the hair I long for: strong and durable. A year perhaps? I can only attest to the one I used that has made me want to keep using it. 4 Stars.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sort of a hair junkie, so I&#x27;m pretty critical of hair products and for the most part, they usually do part or some of what they claim to but this product is the bomb.  I&#x27;m on my second bottle and I love it. I can use it on wet hair, dry hair, in fact, all the time, even twice a day and there is no build up plus it really makes my hair feel thicker.  This product was recommended by Allure magazine as one of their top products and I can certainly see why.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I had the chance to order this for a Vine review, and I figured either I&#x27;d try it--not that my hair is thinning, mind you, it&#x27;s just that my head seems to feel colder and colder on top with the coming of each winter!--or I&#x27;d see if my wife wanted to try it, since she&#x27;s been saying it feels like her hair is getting thinner as we both age (funny how that happens simultaneously!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soon as it arrived, my wife grabbed it and started using it regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instructions say to use the product after washing your hair, while you&#x27;re drying/styling it. You pump a little bit down where your hair is parted, and then you comb it into your hair. Presumably, it creates a buildup of something that encases your strands of individual hairs and over time gives the feel and appearance of thickening that hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife has been using it for about 3 weeks, and we both think it&#x27;s starting to make a difference. Her hair feels a little fuller on the top, where she concentrates most of the application. It may be lightening her dark (dyed, sssh, don&#x27;t tell) hair color a bit. We&#x27;re going to look to see if that trend continues. But even if it is, it&#x27;s barely noticeable, and she&#x27;ll be coloring it again anyway pretty soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m beginning to think it&#x27;s worth a try for me, too. I&#x27;ll update this review if I can pry that container out of her hands!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Agedefy Shampoo and Conditioner with really great results for about a week on my long, highlighted, baby fine hair.  I gained some major bounce and shine with those products so I decided to try the thickening treatment as well for some extra volume.  After a couple of uses I have to say I am really loving what I am seeing and would like to continue to use it, but I am a little concerned about using a hair dryer and flat iron after using the thickening treatment.  I can&#x27;t find any information on Pantene&#x27;s website or from reviewers that confirm if this is truly safe to use with heat styling tools.  One reviewer on another site claims she has chemically relaxed hair and after using this product and then flat ironing, her hair broke off!  :(  Mine is only highlighted, but I am concerned after reading this.  Will hold off on using it again until I can find out more info.</li>
    <li> I pretty much read the list of ingredients of any product - sometimes AFTER I bought it. Like many other&#x27;s who reviewed this product, I was kind of confused about where to apply the spray, the description on the box made it sound as if the product would affect the EXISTING hair, so rubbing it into your sculp didn&#x27;t seem to make much sense. So, I kind of sprayed it all over my very long hair, and it seemed to look fuller. What what concerned me was the fact that the FIRST ingredient listed (which is usually the ingredient that is most prominent in the formula) was Alcohol denat. I even called the Pantene customer service, and the lady gave me this big lecture on how alcohol is not alcohol, and fatty alcohols are actually good for your hair. She was right - only that Alcohol denat. is NOT a fatty alcohol, but a short chain alcohol that dries out hair, as all the experts seem to agree. I believe that the appearance of thicker hair is something like a \\&quot;micro-frizz\\&quot; caused by the hair \\&quot;brissling\\&quot; from the dryness....I am returning this product for sure, since I believe it being harmful for my hair in the long run...and might give Pantene another call to tell them that they should train their customer service representatives a little better on their products.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product but it was disappointing in terms of the promised results.  Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> After just a few days, this did make my hair seem a little thicker.  However, it completely dried out my scalp.  Thicker hair isn&#x27;t better if it comes along with really noticeable dandruff and an itchy scalp.  As others have noted, the first ingredient is denatured alcohol, so I guess it&#x27;s not a big mystery as to why my scalp is so dry.  If you can tolerate it, then awesome.  For me, I got a very unwanted side effect.</li>
    <li> this product can make your hair look and feel thicker. It does not help you grow more hair but it is the best product I have tried and will have to do until they find something that can help you grow more hair or have less-fine hair. I, however, do not like the applicator they have on the bottle. The turret-style allows it to spin in any direction which is unnecessary and allows the applicator to wander away from where you are trying to aim it.</li>
    <li> A liottle hard to use. I would rather have had a product I could shampoo in and not dribble on scalp</li>
    <li> This product works.  This treatment gives my hair body.  I like the feel of my hair and it holds my style longer. My hair feels soft .  Love it!</li>
    <li> After reading some of the comments, I decided that my best course of action was to use a leave-in conditioner in addition to this product.  Without the conditioner, it leaves my hair feeling dry and stiff.  Otherwise there is a very noticeable difference regarding the texture and fullness of my hair.  I believe this gives much better results than any other \\&quot;root lifter\\&quot; on the market.</li>
    <li> I fell for the hype (&amp;#34;It&#x27;s like you have 6500 more strands!&amp;#34;) because I so badly wanted it to be true.  This goop sticks to your hair like a coating of crud, makes your hair stiff, and most certainly does not give the appearance of thicker hair.  You&#x27;d be better off with that spray-on junk you see on old infomercials.  Pantene, what were you thinking?</li>
    <li> I have thin hair. This does add volume.</li>
    <li> I used the kit that came with the Age Defy shampoo and conditioner, but I am most impressed with the thickening treatment.  The one I used had no scent at all and it was easy to apply to my roots. I have hair that is longer than shoulder length and has been looking rather limp and fine, probably because I&#x27;m getting older. This stuff adds body, lift and youthfulness to my hair. I&#x27;ve used it about 5 times, I&#x27;d say I saw a result by the third time I used it.  It doesn&#x27;t make my hair heavy, sticky or dull and I don&#x27;t use hairspray at all.  I would spend a lot more to find a similar product, definitely worth a try!</li>
    <li> Won&#x27;t be purchasing this again. I will just stick with using my current product. Saw this in a magazine &amp; thought it would do wonders as it was stated. Not worth $20, especially because it doesn&#x27;t last that long.</li>
    <li> All in all, I was pretty disappointed with this product. I didn&#x27;t notice any permanent or long-term difference in the thickness of my hair. Rather, it acted more like a ridiculously over-priced hair gel: it made my hair feel thicker while I had the product in it, but once I washed it out there was no discernible change (even after using it every day as directed). Had this not been so expensive, I would not be so disappointed. As it is, this is a total rip-off. You can find their supposed \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; trifecta of ingredients (caffeine &amp; B-vitamins) in Garnier&#x27;s Fall Fight line for a fraction of the cost. If you really want to try this product I&#x27;d recommend instead buying the Fall Fight line for the nutritional value along with some cheap hair gel for the temporary volumizing effect - you can save yourself $12 and get the same results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it two stars for the temporary volume-boosting effect and for the scent, which is by far the best thing about this product.</li>
    <li> this product really works, have thinning hair in front and sides. since I started using this I have noticed a difference in how my&lt;br /&gt;hair looks. will continue to use this.</li>
    <li> I am 67 and while I had great hair when I was young, I inherited my my mother&#x27;s age related thinning hair.  I really hate it.  I see people my age with thick hair and they look so much younger.  I disliked getting my picture taken because all I would see is my pink scalp peeking through my very light blond hair. No matter how I styled my hair, I could see my scalp.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for about three months now and my hair is dramatically better.  My jerk husband no longer tells me I am balding. He keeps asking what my secret is.  If he was nicer i would tell him. My hair may be a little drier but I could care less - it looks so much thicker and I no longer look like there is a road in the middle of my scalp.  I only use it where my hair is thin. It does look better when my hair is clean but who wants dirty hair anyway.  I didn&#x27;t notice any particular fragrance so that doesn&#x27;t bother me. I am extremely happy with this product. I use the shampoo, conditioner, and gel.  I tried many other products before with no success. They better not discontinue it.</li>
    <li> Holy hair gel. This product is fantastic.  I received a sample and It does everything it says it going to do and more.  Their is truly no need for another hair product.  I am running out to buy more.</li>
    <li> A simple test of efficacy...less hair in the brush!  I like that!  Also, not sticky or tacky in any way.  This is not a styling product, it&#x27;s a treatment and it works!</li>
    <li> I have thinning hair on top near the front. This product does seem to thicken the hair. I don&#x27;t use it everyday as suggested because I don&#x27;t go out everyday. It also has a nice smell. I would recommend trying this product before anything more expensive...you just might be surprised.</li>
    <li> I thought this product would add volume and make my hair feel/look thicker....however, it merely makes my hair slippery and floppy!  Maybe having smooth, silky hair is what they&#x27;re going for, but it does not work for me.  I&#x27;m looking for thicker-looking hair (hence the name gave me hope!)!</li>
    <li> As soon as I started using this product, I notice that my hair looked thicker and it still had that natural look.</li>
    <li> I have been using this on my baby hairs. I have noticed a little more thickening by at the cost of an oily residue being left behind. Im very particular about the texture of my hair and skin around my face and scalp. after i few hours i could handle the feeling it left behind and have stopped using it altogether. I guess if you&#x27;re someone who doesn&#x27;t mind product in your hair, then this wouldn&#x27;t be an issue. but for me, someone who likes their hair free of products and au natural it didnt work out</li>
    <li> It is difficult for me to commit to using this everyday for 30 days.  It is not all that convenient.  However, I do think it has helped give more body to my hair.</li>
    <li> I used one entire bottle of this, and was not particularly impressed.  My hair may have looked a bit thicker while using it, but nothing earth-shattering, and it was kind of a pain to apply (I need things that will result in less time getting ready, not more).  I&#x27;ve read that you need to use it forever to continue having results, and that sealed the deal for me - the difference was just not great enough to have to add this to my routine every time I wash my hair.</li>
    <li> Probably will need to use it longer to see striking results&lt;br /&gt;as promotional lit promises, but so far so good.</li>
    <li> The only product that ever worked for my hair was made by Sally Hansen called thicken-it. Discontinued and I have been searching for something ever since. Keep trying to replicate the Thicken-it with no luck. This did nothing for my hair.</li>
    <li> Not sure if i will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I was surprised that this works as well as it does!  Does plump up the hair slightly where it is thinning.  Has a pleasant scent, although I actually wish it doesn&#x27;t, since the fragrance probably means it contains certain chemicals I try to stay away from.</li>
    <li> I am a guy and I like to use this product to give my hair a little extra volume.  It is also a great styling product and a way to refresh your hair.  I will continue to buy this product.</li>
    <li> I think it works, but the smell is little nauseating.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful!  It is not instant result but by following the directions and using it regularly, you will see a definite improvement to your hair.  It acts to thicken  hair and give the hair a fuller feel and appearance!</li>
    <li> This is the product I was hoping to find. It improved my pathetic hair the first time I used it. I have old lady cotton candy texture and my hair is thinning badly.  I follow directions, using 15 pumps on my scalp and massaging it in. It looks and feels much thicker and the bare spots are magically filled in. I thought a wig was my only hope, until I tried this. Thank you. Pantene.</li>
    <li> Arrived promptly. Does what it says.</li>
    <li> Having used this product only a few times, these are my initial review/ thoughts on Pantene&#x27;s new AgeDefy Thickening Treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The preliminarys: First off, I am over 60 [guess I qualify for the \\&quot;age defy\\&quot; part] and have baby fine natural blonde hair [I do have it professionally \\&quot;lightened\\&quot; so it would be considered \\&quot;color\\&quot; treated]that is in a short \\&quot;above the ears\\&quot; pixie style cut. I previously used another well known expensive \\&quot;hair thickening\\&quot; brand that has the exact same promises and ingredients [I actually compared the ingredients list of the two brands]that Pantene&#x27;s AgeDefy does. However, that \\&quot;other\\&quot; brand left my fine hair with a noticeably dull film which made it feel rather dry, so I stopped after a few weeks of use, also it did not react well with my usual texture spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros after a few uses:&lt;br /&gt;#1 The Pantene product is less expensive {$40-$50 bottle vs less than $20 for same amount]; #2 Pantene seems \\&quot;lighter\\&quot; in texture than its counterpart.I applied it to towel dried hair as per directions and then proceeded with my normal texture spray and blow dry. I&#x27;m impressed, Pantene&#x27;s HTT did not leave a \\&quot;dull\\&quot; film on my hair and it did not seem to \\&quot;interact\\&quot; [get sticky, dry, brittle feeling] with my normal texture spray. My hair&#x27;s texture did feel slightly more thick. But it&#x27;s impossible to say after only a few uses, that it will indeed live up to that promise. I&#x27;ll take a wait and see attitude on the \\&quot;promise\\&quot; part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons after a few uses:&lt;br /&gt;non so far but stay tuned, I&#x27;ll report back after a few months of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jan 3 2013 Update:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Pantene AD for over a month and after several weeks of use I did begin to notice that it \\&quot;dulled\\&quot; my hair a little though not as much as the pricier brand did. It may be due to my hair being color treated just not sure [box does say safe for color treated hair]. I believe that it has improved the texture of my hair so I&#x27;ll continued to use it. To avoid the \\&quot;dullness\\&quot; I started using it before bed then washing my hair in the am styling as usual without using the Pantene; then repeating the \\&quot;Pantene AD-sleep-wash-style-Pantene AD\\&quot; routine each day. So far works for me!</li>
    <li> I have been using this thickening treatment for a few weeks now and I am seeing a noticable difference in texture and fullness.  I have been using it everyday so as to give it a good try before reviewing.  The box says that the product is supposed to have a better result after regular use and I feel that this is the case.  I have been pleased so far and will be purchasing this product when it runs out.  I used to get loose perms years ago just to achieve some fullness but this is cheaper and easier on my hair!</li>
    <li> Before I review this product, I think that you should know a bit of background. I am 50+, with fine, thinning hair. Using a product that will thicken my hair is only part of what someone like me needs to do, but I consider it an important part. Many products appear to thicken hair, but in reality are simply coating the hair shaft. I was very pleased to see that not only was this not the case here, but that I actually saw results the very first time that I used it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read the directions closely, as I did not want to do anything that would make my hair fall out faster than it already it. I color my hair, so the product had to be compatible with that process. The instructions are very clear, and the product is very easy to  use. I use it in the morning, and I use it when I wash my hair. (The product can be used on either wet or dry hair.)I have been using this product for over two weeks now, and am  very pleased with it.My hair looks and feels fuller, thicker, and more lively!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a welcome addition to my daily hair routine. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I have been using Pantene Pro-V Expert Collection Agedefy Advanced Hair Thickening Treatment for a couple of weeks now and I LOVE IT! I was worried about build up but so far that has not been a problem. I have very fine hair and after having Thyroid Cancer it is much thinner than it use to be. The Pantene Pro-V really makes my hair look fuller without being stiff like mousse and gels do. It also feels healthier and it smells great. I hope I continue to see improvements and if the build up shows up I will update. As it stands now, I would recommend trying it.</li>
    <li> Most of my life I have worn my hair short because once it gets longer, it&#x27;s just limp. I can&#x27;t do anything with it. I have to pile on the styling products to get it to do anything and then it&#x27;s stiff. I really hate that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product though. It smell so incredibly good, and I just love the way my hair smells. Also, it really does a good job of thickening my hair so when I style it, it looks much fuller than it normally is, and it gives me a nice style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product won&#x27;t weigh your hair down or build up on it either. In fact, you have to rub in on your scalp, at the roots for the best effect, but complete instructions are included, so this really is an easy product to use. It will only take you a few minutes each day, and you&#x27;ll be happy with the result you get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part is that you can use this with any other styling products you may use, whether it&#x27;s hairspray or some type of mousse or gel. It won&#x27;t dry your scalp, and you&#x27;ll love the way your hair feels. Not only is it stronger and thicker, it&#x27;s also softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended for anyone who has baby fine hair like me. You won&#x27;t be disappointed, and the bottle will last you quite awhile, so it&#x27;s well worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jinger Jarrett&lt;br /&gt;Author [...]</li>
    <li> Pantene Pro-V Advanced Hair Thickening Treatment does a Decent Job of Adding Volume and Texture BUT it isn&#x27;t the best product on the market for this purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very thin, baby fine hair and so I am always on the lookout for products that will help give my hair a little body and texture.  Honestly, I don&#x27;t expect much because very few volumizing products live up to their hype and over the years I have learned to accept the fact that you really can&#x27;t put in what nature left out.  Mostly, they either do nothing at all, or they weigh my hair down with such a heavy coating that my naturally fragile hair falls flat under the weight.  Some products have even broken off my hair, and believe me, I cannot afford to lose any!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing will make thin hair become thick and luxurious, but there are a few products out there that give a little extra texture and minimize the problem.  This hair thickening treatment appears to be one of them.  It is not a miracle by any stretch of the immagination, but will add a small amount of substance to fine, thin hair.  It is lightweight and doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down, and I am satisfied that in the short term, Pantene Pro V can help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have three criticsms though:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  While the product does add a little light texture, it makes my hair a little dry and less soft and shiny.  This is a common side effect of most volumizing products that I have tried because most of them contain alcohol, and Pantene Pro-V is not unique in this.  It is simply a trade off you sometimes have to put up with in order to get hair that has slightly more substance.  Not a problem for people with short hair because it is cut often, but I have long hair and I have to work hard to keep it in good shape.  For that reason, the alcohol is a deal breaker for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  The instructions on the bottle are complicated and time consuming.  I like products that I can just apply quickly and go about my life.  This bottle came with detailed instructions that involved parting hair every few inches and applying individually to each section of hair.  It was so daunting that I didn&#x27;t even try the product for several weeks.  When I finally got around to using it, I just applied a generous amount to each fingertip and with all ten fingers, I massaged it into my scalp and used a wet comb to distribute it throughout my hair.  I takes seconds to do this, and the instructions are an absurd waste of time.  If you try this don&#x27;t feel that you need to follow the bottle instructions.  Just apply to the scalp, comb through, and be on your way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  The pump mechanism is poorly designed and poor quality.  I actually spend more time struggling with that wicked pump than I do applying the product to my hair.  Only this morning, I tried to pump some product into my hand and the pump nozzle shot off of the bottle and went flying across the room.  I had to find the pump nozzle and re-attach it to the pump because you cannot use this product without a working pump.  Just immagine how frustrating it would have been if I had been painstakingly parting my hair every few inches, holding it in place with one hand while I struggled to get the annoying little pump to work with the other hand.  YIKES!  Cheap junk.  Just sayin&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line:  The product itself is decent but doesn&#x27;t work any miracles.  The alcohol is drying, making Pantene Pro V something I wouldn&#x27;t use on a regular basis.  For a different thickening treatment that is alcohol free and does a better job of volumizing than Pantene, check out Aubrey Organics - Calaguala Fern Hair Thick/Conditioner.

    <li> I prefer to wash my hair every other day or else it gets very dry.  However, since I have fine hair, adding this product to my hair on the days I didn&#x27;t wash it made my hair feel weighed down and a little greasy.  I tried to use as little as possible but it still felt wrong.  I gave the product to my mom to use and she is having better results, but she washes her hair every day.  My hair appears thicker when I use a spray in root lifter such as [[ASIN:B003USIB9Q Pantene Pro-V Fine Hair Style Spray Gel, Root Lifter, 5.7 oz.]] or [[ASIN:B006WVCCUW Garnier  Fructis Style Hi-Rise Lift Root Booster, Extreme Hold, 5.1 Fluid Ounce]].</li>
    <li> I researched many products that would help thicken up my hair and I have to say this product showed a noticeable change with a few weeks. Last year I had Gastric Bypass and one of the complications from this surgery is that my hair began shedding and thinning. I am always looking for something that can help me deal with this thinning or just slowing down the process and The Pantene Pro-V Expert Collection Agedefy Advanced Hair Thickening Treatment has seemed to help me some. I like that it soaks into my hair almost immediately and I can start styling my hair soon after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the bottle because it is perfectly designed to make applying the product that much easier. I also use a light oil to prevent my hair from being dry and brittle and this combination has done wonders for me because using the thickening treatment all alone can sometimes dry out the edges of my hair. The benefits of this product outweighs the negatives, so if you have to add another product to this to get the benefits then you will enjoy what the Pantene Pro-V has to offer.</li>
    <li> This product works!!  My hair is fine and thin.  After using the hair thickening product for gust one week my hair is fuller and looks hreat!</li>
    <li> This product is right up there with the more expensive similar products offered by Nioxin . Adds density &amp; volume and does not leave hair sticky.</li>
    <li> Nice product.  I have thinning hair and this seems to help.  It certainly hasn&#x27;t hurt (unlike some other products I tried!)</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair - I was the little girl who couldn&#x27;t wear barrettes because they slipped right out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in my mid 30&#x27;s and started using this as my hair thinned out post pregnancy.  I noticed very definite results.  My friends commented without my asking.  No kidding.  I can actually wear my hair down now some days, which I used to not do because it was just so thin/fine.</li>
    <li> It has given me help with the problem of thinning hair.</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t do anything it professes to do....made my hair baby fine, lifeless and fly away....Don&#x27;t waste your money!!!!</li>
    <li> I used this product in conjunction with the shampoo and the conditioner and I followed the directions exactly. I purchased these items because of the many glowing reviews at Amazon. Sadly, the product did not work for me AT ALL. I have had much more success with Toppik and Folicure lines and can recommend either of them.</li>
    <li> I first ran across this at a local store. I am an older lady with very very fine hair. The words Advanced Thickening jumped out of the description on the box so I HAD to have it. My friends, I am so glad I cued in on that impulse! The claim that it can make you look like you have 6500 more strands of hair is true. Two weeks of using this everyday AS INSTRUCTED performed a modern miracle for my hairs appearance! Even my bangs look much fuller. Makes me feel that I look really much cuter....LOL&lt;br /&gt;  Don&#x27;t give in to the temptation to put it on more than once a day.That can make your hair feel \\&quot;dippity dooed\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;  I highly recommend this product. I love it so much I added it to my subscribe &amp; save items that I receive once a month from Amazon.Com. That way I know&lt;br /&gt;I will always have it to use everyday.</li>
    <li> But not sure it&#x27;s the slam dunk reviews make it out to be.  Makes hair fluffier. I still don&#x27;t understand how it makes hair fuller in 15 days. Build up of product? More hair growth? That&#x27;s very vague.</li>
    <li> This product is easy to use and works on my hair as it claims.  Not greasy and dries fast and makes My hair feel a little thicker.</li>
    <li> I lost a lot of hair due to multiple surgeries over a short period of time; I did not realize, but apparently having anesthetic creates hair loss.  I have been very self-conscious about it and have been very happy to find this product.</li>
    <li> I have tried this for over a month and this product does make my hair feel and appear thicker  I think it is a pretty good product for this price!!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t do exactly what it says/</li>
    <li> this is it for me! i was on a medicine that caused my hair to thin. This product is perfect for my hair type. Long/Straight. It smells amazing and it really adds fullness where it is needed and helps control my aging hair. Its worth the extra few dollars for a product like this. I have had in my hair routine for over a year and its my third time ordering. I hope they never discontinue there Age defy line because it all has really worked for me. not sure on other hair types but my hair looks awful without using it!</li>
    <li> Did not like this product at all . I tried twice with just a few pumps but perhaps because my hair is ultra fine and thin it just weighed it down and made it look greasy</li>
</ol>
