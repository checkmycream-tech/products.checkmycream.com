      <li>If I could eat this perfume, it would be my favorite meal.</li>
      <li>Yes, yes I love this.</li>

      <li>Hope they continue to carry this, I simply love it.</li>
      <li>I love the way it mixes with my body chemistry.  </li>
      <li>I just love this perfume.</li>
      <li>and so glad I found it on line because I don&#x27;t see it in stores.</li>
      <li>I checked google and found it here on Amazon for a better price.  </li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I bought four of these because I love the fragrance.  </li>
      <li>Expressive, elegant, classical parfum spray</li>
      <li>It is a lovely fresh scent that does go on kind of strong, but smells very fresh and clean.</li>
      <li>It really smells good, kind of like a classic floral.</li>
      <li>YOU SHOULD ALWAYS READ THE FINE PRINT</li>
      <li>Yet you were able to quickly get it to me.</li>
      <li>very smooth nice 2 wear anytime of the yr last</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had people stop me in the grocery store and said they were following me around to get up the nerve to ask what it was because it smelled so good.  </li>
      <li>It is like no other parfum I have ever purchased hopefully this will be available for many years to come.</li>
      <li>every single time I wear it someone asks what it is I&#x27;m wearing because it smells so good.  </li>
      <li>Really mature. :)</li>
      <li>This was a birthday present for my daughter which was excited to get this perfume as it is not in the stores any more, so I made her day</li>
      <li>Very nice and not strong.</li>
      <li>It starts out sweet, but then settles down into a very feminine fragrance, light and refreshing.</li>
      <li>Thank you so much Amazon!</li>
      <li>AND I WAS VERY DISAPOINTED THAT IT DID NOT COME IN A BOX!</li>
      <li>THOUGH THAT WAS VERY TACTFUL.</li>
      <li>One bottle will last a full year because if you wear too much, it is overpowering.  </li>
      <li>The box I got must have been pretty old.  </li>
      <li>I just had to have this one because it smells almost exactly like Andron that I used to wear in the early 80&#x27;s.  </li>
      <li>I would advise to smell this in a department store first unless you like smelling, um, mature.  </li>
      <li>This fragrance was powdery smelling and it reminded me of an older woman.  </li>
      <li>I am particular about my fragrance.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend Daniellel.  </li>
      <li>At first it is a little sweet</li>
      <li>I sometimes have difficulty finding new scents that I like</li>
      <li>and I have got more compliments on this than the more expensive ones that I have used!</li>
      <li>Wow!  </li>
      <li>The mail could not get here fast enough.</li>
      <li>I love this perfume but it is very hard to find now.  </li>
      <li>I would not say it is bad, it just is more for someone who likes that clean but powdery smell.</li>
      <li>I had tried a tester of this in a store but it was kind of expensive there.  </li>

<li> I had purchased a tester a few months back and decided to try it last week.  </li>
<li> other one&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> so I purchased this product based on the other reviews of it on Amazon</li>
<li> but then it settles down</li>
<li> I won&#x27;t and don&#x27;t use any other cologne!  </li>
<li> It is a delicate yet earthy floral, which becomes warmer as the day wears on.  </li>
<li> Then, something turned for the worse.  </li>
<li> as fake.</li>
<li> Very disappointed in this product.</li>

    <li> Wow!  I have worn this perfume for years -- ever since it came out on the market.  One bottle will last a full year because if you wear too much, it is overpowering.  You will get tons of compliments on this perfume.</li>

    <li> I smelled this in a magazine and could not wait to buy it, especially with all the wonderful reviews it had. So, I ordered it.  The mail could not get here fast enough. When it arrived, I ripped through the box like I was a child on Christmas day.  I pulled the bottle out, and it might have been my imagination, but there was almost a ray of sunshine displayed on the bottle.  Then, something turned for the worse.  I sprayed it.  I was thinking or rather hoping that the little old lady that sprayed out would dissipate and the rock star smell that I remembered would bust through like a bull in a china shop.  Well, that did not happen.  The little old lady was still there, quieter now, thankfully. I would advise to smell this in a department store first unless you like smelling, um, mature.  Really mature. :)</li>
    <li> I just love this perfume. It&#x27;s been discontinued. Very happy to find it.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend this product to all my friends.</li>
    <li> Excellent scent will recommend to all</li>
    <li> I love it. It last all day.</li>
    <li> I bought four of these because I love the fragrance.  It&#x27;s a terrific price and so glad I found it on line because I don&#x27;t see it in stores.</li>
    <li> The box I got must have been pretty old.  The smell doesn&#x27;t last on me at all.  Very disappointed in this product.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume but it is very hard to find now.  I&#x27;ve been wearing it for 3 years now and every single time I wear it someone asks what it is I&#x27;m wearing because it smells so good.  I&#x27;ve had people stop me in the grocery store and said they were following me around to get up the nerve to ask what it was because it smelled so good.  I hope they haven&#x27;t discontinued it.</li>
    <li> This one was good.&lt;br /&gt;The other one&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;W as fake.</li>
    <li> I am ordering this for second time. this is my regular work wear perfume. At first it is a little sweet but then it settles down and I have got more compliments on this than the more expensive ones that I have used! I love it!!</li>
    <li> This perfume sales for $40.00 a piece at retailers. She loved it and she also loved the fact that we saved money. The gift was perfect.</li>
    <li> This fragrance was powdery smelling and it reminded me of an older woman.  I would not say it is bad, it just is more for someone who likes that clean but powdery smell.</li>
    <li> Hmmm Hmmmm Good! If I could eat this perfume, it would be my favorite meal. But since I can&#x27;t eat it, OMG!!! I will wear this as one of my most favorite choices of perfumes. If you haven&#x27;t tried it, please do. You won&#x27;t regret it. I&#x27;m so glad that I was able to find it through Amazon. Their prices are the absolute BEST! Thank you so much Amazon!</li>
    <li> This was a birthday present for my daughter which was excited to get this perfume as it is not in the stores any more, so I made her day</li>

    <li> Yes, yes I love this. Very nice and not strong. Smells wonderful. Hope they continue to carry this, I simply love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Danielle by Danielle Steel for a couple of years--it replaced a fragrance I had used for over 40 years. It is a very light fragrance but I am amazed at how many people compliment it no matter where I go--even from strangers I walk by when out shopping. I am very loyal to a fragrance once I find one that works for me--I plan to stick with this one indefinitely!</li>
    <li> I love this perfume and am elated that I found it for an excellent price!  I would recommend this to everyone!!!  I have purchased 15 bottles in all......I hope that doesn&#x27;t make the price go up! :-D</li>
    <li> I would highly recommend Daniellel.  I have purchased some of the best colognes from fine department stores, but none stayed with me all day.  When I purchased Danielle and wore it, I started receiving compliments even at the end of my work day.  I stayed with me all day.  I have been hooked on Danielle now for over 5 years.  I won&#x27;t and don&#x27;t use any other cologne!  IT IS THE BEST FRAGRANCE I&#x27;VE EVER USED!</li>
