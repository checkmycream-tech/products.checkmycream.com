      <li>The best thing I&#x27;ve ever used on my aching sensitive skin</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s very light and doesn&#x27;t make your skin feel greasy.</li>
      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>Great for days when my skin is very irritated...</li>
      <li>I wish they could put this in a squeeze bottle or a pump to make it more sanitary and hold some of the antioxidants in.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s working properly, I m satisfied</li>
      <li>Great skin cream, I would recommend to anyone with sensitive  skin.  </li>
      <li>and they had great, natural products.  </li>
      <li>Makes my skin feel silky smooth.</li>
      <li>Makes my skin so soft and smooth, I have really sensitive skin and this product is amazing! !!</li>
      <li>It feels light and airy.</li>
      <li>I have acne and rosacea and have tried many moisturizers trying to find the right one.</li>
      <li>I was attracted to the price compared to the original cream price.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the money!</li>
      <li>Nice to find a product with natural ingredients.  </li>
      <li>Perfect for dry sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>After using this product my skin felt fresh and hydrated.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth the try.</li>
      <li>You only need a tiny bit and it goes on great.</li>
      <li>Goes on smoothly and smells nice, but I definitely need something more heavy duty for nighttime.</li>
      <li>Shipping was fast too!</li>
      <li>It helps my skin from becoming too red from hot flashes, and when under stress.</li>
      <li>If you have oily skin just be more conservative with it because it will make you oily, but hasn&#x27;t broke me out like most thick &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; type moisturizers tend to do.</li>
      <li>It is lightweight and absorbs fast.</li>
      <li>I agree with other reviewers that a pump would be much more sanitary.</li>
      <li>Pevonia is very creamy and not thick like other products that are actually more drying because of their thickness.  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t really noticed that it has helped with my sensitive skin or anything, but it does help alot with the dryer patches I can get from cleansers.  </li>
      <li>I have been scouring the counters looking for a lotion that is moisturizing yet gentle on my sensitive, rosacea prone skin.  </li>
      <li>I either wake up with fresh skin or red and blotchy skin that burns.</li>
      <li>My skin is very sensitive and this line did wonders for me.</li>
      <li>My grandmother has very sensitive skin</li>
      <li>The lady recommended this cream for my sensitive skin, and paired with Aloe it does wonders!</li>
      <li>I recommend this product to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Not harsh.</li>
      <li>It has been my staple ever since, providing rich moisture without being overly heavy, and no reaction at all from my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Recently I went to see an esthetician for the first time in my life for dry, flaky skin - she recommended this product and gave me a sample.</li>
      <li>This, combined with discontinuing use of Neutrogena Fresh Foaming Cleanser (a makeup remover and cleanser in one - too harsh for my face) solved the issue.</li>
      <li>Just the right consistency, not too heavy.  </li>
      <li>I like this face cream, it goes on smoothly and does not irritate my sensitive skin, however is not quite heavy enough for my dry skin, especially in winter months.  </li>
      <li>I was introduced to this product a couple of year ago when the effects of chemo had my skin very dry and itchy, but also very sensitive.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive and very dry skin.  </li>
      <li>I have used this product before, but the price became to high on other websites.</li>

    <li> Great product awesome seller</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s working properly, I m satisfied thank s !!!</li>
    <li> I like this face cream, it goes on smoothly and does not irritate my sensitive skin, however is not quite heavy enough for my dry skin, especially in winter months.  I found myself putting on 2 layers, and at the price was not worth repurchasing.  I agree with other reviewers that a pump would be much more sanitary.</li>
    <li> I have purchased 2 jars for my husband as he has been using this cream for over 7 years now.. I was attracted to the price compared to the original cream price. However, the quality and the skin reaction my husband experienced from this jar that I got from Amazon was terrible!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took us a while to diagnose and determine the reason behind the dark spotting and allergic skin reaction he had expeienced,, After all it was form this poor quality cream form this specific vendor that I think is not original and a cheap replica!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the spotting on his face is not healed and we lost the money!!</li>
    <li> Great product, as with most Pevonia items. This was a good choice for winter dryness. Makes my skin feel silky smooth.</li>
    <li> Great skin cream, I would recommend to anyone with sensitive  skin.  Just the right consistency, not too heavy.  It&#x27;s worth the try.</li>
    <li> Love this face cream! Makes my skin so soft and smooth, I have really sensitive skin and this product is amazing! !!</li>
    <li> I have been scouring the counters looking for a lotion that is moisturizing yet gentle on my sensitive, rosacea prone skin.  This produce seems to be doing just that. I don&#x27;t wake up with dry patches or the flush, red undertones when applying this before bed. It is also smooth enough to wear under makeup without creating a think or sticky base. Also, a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Great for days when my skin is very irritated... Pevonia is an excellent product.</li>
    <li> I have acne and rosacea and have tried many moisturizers trying to find the right one. This is the only one I have found that does not make my face turn red. It is a little expensive but it is worth the price to have a moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or cause breakouts. The only complaint is the jar packaging. I wish they could put this in a squeeze bottle or a pump to make it more sanitary and hold some of the antioxidants in.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive and very dry skin.  Up until I discovered Pevonia I had a very difficult time moisturizing my skin.  I have continued to find something cheaper that would do the trick but have been unsuccessful.  Pevonia is very creamy and not thick like other products that are actually more drying because of their thickness.  I love this product and have been using it for years!</li>
    <li> I have used this product before, but the price became to high on other websites. Now I found it on Amazon and very glad to be using it again. It helps my skin from becoming too red from hot flashes, and when under stress. It is lightweight and absorbs fast. And does not make my skin too oily.</li>
    <li> The best thing I&#x27;ve ever used on my aching sensitive skin</li>
    <li> Recently I went to see an esthetician for the first time in my life for dry, flaky skin - she recommended this product and gave me a sample.

    <li> Used this product for years and it is the best</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this product a couple of year ago when the effects of chemo had my skin very dry and itchy, but also very sensitive. It has been my staple ever since, providing rich moisture without being overly heavy, and no reaction at all from my sensitive skin. This is definitely my \\&quot;go to\\&quot; for facial moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Nice to find a product with natural ingredients.  Not quite thick enough for the sometimes brutal cold and wind, but easy on my sensitive skin.  Calms redness, soothes dryness.  Careful around the eyes, though.  My eyelids seem to have a slight reaction to it.</li>
    <li> This cream is perfect for sensitive skin. My skin is irritated by almost everything and trying a new cream or moisturizer is a scary deal for me. I either wake up with fresh skin or red and blotchy skin that burns. After using this product my skin felt fresh and hydrated. It&#x27;s very light and doesn&#x27;t make your skin feel greasy. This also lasts a long time since you don&#x27;t need a lot of it. If you&#x27;re looking for something that serves an upkeep purpose I would try this out.</li>
    <li> My grandmother has very sensitive skin and this is the one product that doesn&#x27;t irritate her skin! A great value to keep my Oma happy and looking young!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  I am a licensed Esthetician and when I was in school they were using the Pevonia line and they had great, natural products.  My skin is very sensitive and this line did wonders for me.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to write a review on Pevonia since I have never tried it, but I have bought it for my daughter-in-law before, and she loves it! Shipping was fast too!</li>
    <li> Was introduced to Pevonia when I went to a spa. The lady recommended this cream for my sensitive skin, and paired with Aloe it does wonders! Goes on smoothly and smells nice, but I definitely need something more heavy duty for nighttime.</li>
    <li> Perfect for dry sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Wonderful cream for skin with tons of allergies and sensitivities.  It absorbs so beautifully but truly moisturizes as well.  Not harsh.</li>
    <li> I like this product but can only use it at night because it is a thicker cream.  I haven&#x27;t really noticed that it has helped with my sensitive skin or anything, but it does help alot with the dryer patches I can get from cleansers.  If you have oily skin just be more conservative with it because it will make you oily, but hasn&#x27;t broke me out like most thick &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; type moisturizers tend to do.</li>
    <li> You may think 1.7 oz is a little bit; however, this goes a very, very, very long way. You only need a tiny bit and it goes on great. It feels light and airy. Definitely worth the money!</li>
