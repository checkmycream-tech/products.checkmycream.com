<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Goopy cream for old people with dry skin (like me).</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful cream at an amazing price!  I decided to try it after reading some of the reviews and have not been disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is good stuff. You can also find it at Costco. Great to use for severly dry cracked skin.</li>
    <li> I like how this cream makes my skin feel overnight and when I wake up. It doesn&#x27;t make my skin oily, however, I only gave it 4 stars because I get little dry patches around any minor break out and I doesn&#x27;t get rid of that type of dryness. But this is my second tub of this and I love how it moisturizes.</li>
    <li> Great for dry skin and especially in the winter. Thick, rich cream - but not excessively thick or heavy and pore clogging. I used this on my hands and face. The jar is huge, lasts forever.</li>
    <li> Very nice, seemed to really last and had a mellow smell to it</li>
    <li> I am used it for long time ago is really good product for your skin and price is great, I do love it!</li>
    <li> This stuff is FANTASTIC!!!  I had really rough cracked and dry feet.  I started using this cream a few years ago and within a month my feet were smooth and soft.  I&#x27;ve used it every day since and no longer have a problem with dry feet.  It&#x27;s great for all your dry skin needs.  I think I&#x27;ve sold more of this cream for Amazon than anyone!  I highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> Very nice cream, and great fragrance!!!!  Great for super dry or cracked skin or fingers!!</li>
    <li> Great moisturizing cream.  Both me and my husband use this after showering.  Helps keep our skin soft and if you have dry skin, it helps stops the itching.</li>
    <li> My whole family uses this....GREAT price for the size. It works great.</li>
    <li> This is my &amp;#34;most favorite&amp;#34; cream, it works great to get rid of scars and is wonderful on dry spots, make sure you by two jars at once, you will go through them they are so fantastic</li>
    <li> I have been using this moisturizer for many years on my body after showers and before bed. I recently got a bad sunburn from the beach and when it peeled, I was left with patches of red, raw skin. As soon as my skin calmed, I began applying Genes every few hours, especially before bed. Within two days, my sunburn completely healed and I also noticed that it prevented more pealing from occurring ! If only I used this cream as soon as I was sunburned. Perhaps it could have prevented all of the damage and moisturized my skin better than aloe after sun products . Great stuff!</li>
    <li> Been using this product for years, and love it. Can&#x27;t get it at the places I&#x27;ve been buying it, so had to order it. Hard to find now!! Service was fantastic!! Item arrived in just a few days!!</li>
    <li> So glad to find this wonderful creme!</li>
    <li> I found it suspect that the full list of ingredients is not listed openly on Amazon.  After doing a bit of research I found them, and while this moisturizer has many excellent ingredients, it also contains many pretty scary ones, which I would never use; here is the complete list:    ingredients: distilled water, safflower oil, glyceryl stearate and PEG-100 stearate, tocopheryl (vitamin E), sesame oil, isopropyl palmitate, mango seed oil, shea nut butter, collagen, stearic acid, ceteareth-20, sweet almond oil, macademia nut oil, cetyl alcohol, brazil nut oil, panthenol, octyldodecanol, caprylic/capric triglyceride, propylene glycol, vitamin A palmitate with vitamin D3, ascorbic acid (vitamin C), triethanolamine, sorbitan stearate, pure plant essences known as essential oils (fragrance), methylparaben, phenoxyethanol, propylparaben, allantoin, butylparaben, pemulen, annatto, and caramel    Some of the ingredients I would never use are:  methylparaben, phenoxyethanol, propylparaben, butylparaben    If you are interested to know why I&#x27;d never use them, look them up here:  [...]    It&#x27;s sad that lotion and cosmetic companies are so reckless with our health and include such dangerous ingredients in our products.  If you think about it, lotions are just as important as food as they get placed on and penetrated into our bodies through our LARGEST organ, our skin.  I think it&#x27;s time we demanded more from our personal products manufacturers.</li>
    <li> I originally bought Genes&#x27; Vitamin E Creme to use as a body creme for my dry skin.  Then, I thought I would try it on my face.  WOW, works beautifully on my 63 year old mature skin.  Plumps up my skin.  Will never buy those expensive department store face creams again!</li>
    <li> Genes vitamin E creme is fantistic. I use it on my hands and feet which are very dry and it has really made a difference.</li>
    <li> I have to admit that I&#x27;m old. I started to see tiny winkles on my face, around my eyes....I tried a couple of products, including the famous La Mer. None of them helps. To be fair, La Mer is not intended for winkles and I cannot afford keeping using it even if it is. Things changed when I found this creme on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I have heard that collagen and VE can help to smooth the skin but most of such products are expensive. The GENES cream is very cheap comparing to the other products. If only used on the face, it can probably last for over a year! I tried it and I think my tiny winkles are tinier in less than a week! My skin looks much better. I only use it at night though as it is kinda oily.&lt;br /&gt;For your reference, the La Mer I once bought is about $140/1oz. For one oz, the GENES cream costs less than a dollar!</li>
    <li> If you are looking for something to help speed up skin healing after laser, chemical peel, or acne scarring (maybe even sunburns) then you have found it. I definitely have with this product. This thing is unlike other moisturizers out there that has harmful mineral oil as one of their main ingredients. Use this at night to revitalize your skin--this thing is full of beneficial vitamins, you will notice how soft and even-toned your skin feels after just several days of use. Sam&#x27;s sells the 16 oz. for just a little over 8 dollars so if you have Sam&#x27;s nearby just go pick up one from there to save yourself some money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I disliked the jasmine-y floral scent to it, but after a while I  actually started to like the smell more and more, it reminds me of a spa or a vacation lol.&lt;br /&gt;The only \\&quot;downside\\&quot; (I don&#x27;t even want to call it that) I can think of is the lack of spf on this thing so I tend to not use it during daytime.</li>
    <li> I bought this beautiful skin care product from Sams. I totally love it.it smells heavenly . It smells so natural and my skin just loves it. I have small marks on my hands. But after applying this cream they slowly started to fade . My skin is looking bright now. This is so creamy , a little goes a long way. So a bottle should last atleast 5 months. I highly recommend this product to others . It is almost half the price ( online price ) in Sams. Thanks for reading my review.</li>
    <li> Works great but it leaves me smelling like an old lady..</li>
    <li> I find this product to be very versatile and extremely useful in relieving itchy dry skin on the face, neck, and other parts of the body that are prone to dryness and flaking.  After a few weeks of use my skin has been restored to its former luster.  This creme is pleasant and easy to use, and smells nice and clean without being perfumey.</li>
    <li> Got my shippment yesterday.            I took 1 gave 1 to my mom. Taking into account the comments posted I was not surprised by it&#x27;s thickness, nor the nutty smell.             What did surprise me was the way my skin loved it. I put some on all over including my dry feet the minute I got it in the mail. And even after a few hrs. my skin still felt moist and smooth.              With other lotions I&#x27;d have to reapply during the day, mostly my hands. So because of the strong nutty smell I reapplied it all over just before bed and wake up so soft and smooth. So I think that&#x27;s the way I&#x27;ll go from now on. After I see how it wears during the day.            I do relative Foster care. So I applied it after my dad took his bath, I did as some posting suggested applied it on damp skin and it did go on smoother and I didn&#x27;t need as much.             So unless something changes this will become one of my favorite things.  But because of it&#x27;s strong smell and it not being really easy to apply I gave it 4 out of 5 stars.    04/26/11 Revision...I just got my second order...thats how much I love this product. I still had the same problems memtioned by others. It&#x27;s thickness...so I combated that my alway putting a little water on my hands before applying it anywhere. That really helped in the application...and it allows the product to last longer cause I&#x27;m not using so much.     I still apply it every night and I still wake up feeling smooth and refreshed. And my bedding has that heavenly nutty smell...I still HIGHTLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!! Only Con is that it cost me with s/h around $14.50 per bottle...but it&#x27;s better than most other lotions of like.</li>
    <li> I have psoriasis, mostly knees and elbows. I use an OTC psoriasis cream with zinc and Genes swiss collagen cream to help keep scaling under control. I have used prescription creams and many diffrtent OTC creams to help control the psoriasis with little success.I apply the Genes at least twice a day and especially at bedtime for good results.</li>
    <li> I bought this cream to treat a skin disorder called Diffuse Generalized Granuloma Annulare.  I have had it since I was a baby (35+ years), and the only 2 things that have completely resolved it at any time in my life are steroids (oral or topical) and pregnancy.  Since it isn&#x27;t practical to stay on steroids, or stay pregnant forever, I have been searching for something else (non-pharmaceutical) to try.  I came across several testimonies that topical Vitamin E had completely resolved cases of Granuloma Annulare, so since it is now the worst it has ever been for me, I am giving it a shot.  Just received the cream and have only used it twice, but WOW!  Even if it doesn&#x27;t clear up the skin condition, it sure makes my skin soft!!  I will update in a few months as to whether or not it has improved the Granuloma Annulare, but I can say for sure right now that this is the best cream I have used.  And it has a pleasant smell, a lightly lotioned scent.</li>
    <li> I have been using this lotion for years.  When I got pregnant, I didn&#x27;t dare try anything else to prevent stretch marks.  It works like a charm.  I love it and I will use it for the rest of my life.  I do not use it on my face, but anywhere below my neck is perfect.  This stuff rocks!</li>
    <li> I had it before--it is all I expected it to be!  B Justice</li>
    <li> My wife has using for years and loves it.</li>
    <li> Great for dry skin and sunburn relief, I have used this for years!</li>
    <li> This is the BEST skin care product I have ever used.I&#x27;ve been using it for a while now and as my supply dwindled I worried,as the local store I bought it at no longer carried it.This stuff is essential for beautiful skin.It leaves your skin very soft and smooth and it gets rid of any dry skin and fights lines and wrinkles.It smells wonderful and it&#x27;s very economical.The big jar will last for a while.I recomend this to anyone wanting beautiful healthy skin.</li>
    <li> I really Have a very sensitive skin especially in new york weather!! Combination to oily pimple acne and blemishes dryness and everything! Of i dont have acne, i am prone to have acne scars and the darkness wont go away for months.  I spend hundreds of dollars and trial and error of many products from do it yourself and online purchases and going to the dermatologists and all recommendations. I saw this with my friend and just let it go and i saw my sister using this, since they have beautiful skin already, i didnt bother. But its getting cold here in newyork. I want to hydrate my skin, and i got so confuse of all the beauty products and i was thinking using coconut oil but i get tired of it. I stumble on this coz i remember my sister is using this, NO REGRETS!!!!!!! For only 2days of using it all the redness of my acne scars faded!!!!!!!!!!!!! Usually if its winter its cold my scars turns to red! But now its gone! God is good after all the tears and worries and money spent on beauty products I found the miracle cure!!!!!!! My skin is so soft and radiant! i hope this works all year round! All seasons of beautiful skin :) thank u so much for making this product and amazon for quick shipment! I rarely give a product review!!! Believe me try this!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have used some of the most expensive, department store and boutique skin care lines out there.  I discovered this through the recommendation of my elderly mother who uses it everywhere, inlcluding her face!  I was appalled that she would use this on her face but her skin looks pretty great for 78 years old.  I decided to try it.  Shocked to find out that it works as well as Creme de La Mer on my skin and a huge container of it is $6 at Sam&#x27;s Club.  I also use it on my arms, legs, neck and chest.  For that kind of savings, I can put it anywhere that I want younger looking skin.  And that is what you will get for a FRACTION of the cost.  It does have a very strong smell but I don&#x27;t really care.  Some of the expensive ones only make your skin smell nice and don&#x27;t moisturize as well as this.  I am sold... but not from Amazon!</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer in the dry climate that I live in.</li>
    <li> I have EXTREMELY dry skin. My fingers are like sandpaper in the winter and I can actually peel the skin off my heals and toes in thick strips. The doctor prescribed a lactic acid moisturizer that worked great, my hands and feet were smooth as baby skin, but the insurance company stopped covering it, so I decided to make my own concoction using Genes and an over the counter lactic acid. It was great. I got the same effect as the Rx. I can&#x27;t find any other vitamin E product that works as well.</li>
    <li> Perfect for men and women.  Creamy with faint smell, works on dry skin areas comfortably.  Heels, elbows, no problem.</li>
    <li> Recently, just for the heck of it, I decided to browse Amazon for a moisturizer based on average reviews. I came upon Genes vitamin E creme. There were so many great reviews about it so I decided to buy it just to try. Right around this time, I had a really dry little patch right under my eye and I had no idea what was causing it. It might have been the cold weather or something. I received this item right away because I am a prime member. I was very excited to try it and right on the same night I received it I used it before I went to sleep. It&#x27;s true what everyone else said, this was a bit on the heavy side, a little oily due to the vitamin E I presume? But my face definitely felt moisturized afterwards. The next day, I was so amazed because the little dry patch under my eye was reduced dramatically! unbelievable! I would think that any type of product would take time to show results but this creme only took a night. I cant believe how affordable this BIG tub of moisturizer is! Im not sure if this product is for me since I dont really have sensitive skin. And I did not experience any sting the first time I used it like some other people mentioned here. Overall, this product is simply AMAZING! &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> This is the most effective skin product we have found, it actually works.</li>
    <li> This was a good buy.  The cream comes in a large jar, and a little goes far because the cream is very thick and rich.  It has a pleasant but very faint scent.</li>
    <li> Much cheaper in Sam&#x27;s, but a very nice product for dry skin. It&#x27;s rich and not to creamy. You don&#x27;t have to constantly rub for it to absorb like some vitamin e creams.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like this cream. It is very greasy and it does not absorb. I used it for a month and did not noticed anything. I did not noticed any changes in skin at all. Will not purchase again. I am surprised why so many people like it. Plus there are a lot of harsh preservatives in this cream, not a healthy chose I made.</li>
    <li> I have used the item before and just think that it&#x27;s all I needed to use for my problems.  I would recommend this product to all that have the dry skin for all over the body.  The price  was also OK.</li>
    <li> I really hate lotions and the way they feel. That being said I have no issues with this product! I had severe sun burn on my face and once the heart dissipated I extensively used this. I healed almost a week sooner than my friend who relied on aloe Vera. Throw in any variables you want, i was burnt worse.   This cream also helped to fade two scars i had from burning myself at work almost a year ago. Furthermore, it heals small cuts and scrapes ridiculously fast. It is a miracle product in my opinion.</li>
    <li> very nourishing - large container - lasts a long time!</li>
    <li> A friend told me it&#x27;s getting rid of her scars so I am hoping it will do the same for me!</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic skin cream. I use it twice daily from head to toe. My skin is sensitive and I&#x27;ve even switched from my facial moisturizer to using this terrific cream and I have no problems. Unless someone is allergic to any of the ingredients, this is the way to go. Makes my skin sooo soft and smooth. It&#x27;s a yellow moisture-rich cream that is very, very emollient. My skin feels so soft and smooth after application. Have never found any of the commercial creams in the retail stores that can come close to its softening and moisturizing. If I wash dishes, or hand wash anything, I always follow up and use this cream on my hands. In winter, this is a godsend for dry skin. Have finally found a really good cream and the way I use it, I&#x27;m glad it only comes in 16 oz. jars. Unlike a few other reviewers, I find the fragrance light and pleasant. And it is very, very calming on the skin for those of us with seborrheic dermatitis: it won&#x27;t heal it, but it feels absolutely wonderful and stops the pain and itch.</li>
    <li> This product is thick, makes your skin feel fresh and even-toned, and feels great on the skin. I would recommend this product to everyone is see and know. Please try you will love it!:):)</li>
    <li> So good I gave it to my mom. Will buy another for myself. Much better than most of my creams. Wonder why it&#x27;s not in the grocery stores.</li>
    <li> I use this cream daily and I believe it is very good the skin on my face especially.  I have been using this for a number of years and I am so glad you carry it because I was having trouble finding it.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, Lois</li>
    <li> I have been using Genes Vitamin E Creme for almost a year now, and I think it is a great product.  I lather it on at night after a shower, and it makes my skin feel soft and supple.  When you can&#x27;t afford La Mer, buy Genes.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> love this. its thick but it really helps with my dry and sensitive face.</li>
    <li> DOES A REALLY GOOD JOB ON MY ALLIGATOR AGING SKIN!</li>
    <li> Not too bad of product, could be price a little cheaper as for what it actually does. Although would not buy it again I think!</li>
    <li> Living in the the driest state of the union, I have finally found the best answer for dry and sensitive skin.  Genes Vitamin E Creme is it.  It can be used on hands, body and especially face and neck.  If you have dry/sensitive skin, Genes Vitamin E Creme is marvelous!  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Not as good as I expected.</li>
    <li> I should give it 3 stars for being in expensive but it just stays on my skin. After shower I have to wait 20 min before I can put clothes on, it creams on top of your skin,Almost as if it is not getting absorbed. I have a white paste on my skin when I use it:(For me it was a waste of money, I will use on my hands and may be feet till its gone. Wont buy again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! I had a lesion that the dermatologist called   actinic keratosis. They told me that they could remove it but it may leave a scar or I could \\&quot;keep\\&quot; it. I kept it but not for long.  A few months later I ran across Genes Vitamin E cream. I used it once a day at night and like magic that lesion disappeared! Now I use it on moles and they shrink! Its great. When I use it under my eyes I pat a little water on it to mix because it is so thick. Makes the lines smooth out.</li>
    <li> I use this all over after showing and love it. It takes very little to do the trick and absorbs quickly. The scent is fine and not flowery so I don&#x27;t feel like I am wearing perfume. I also use most nights and still feel soft the next morning. My very dry skin is looking better especially my legs.  I am also using the Tree Hut Shea scrub once a week which is helping.</li>
    <li> i love this cream. it make my skin feel so good. I use it on my face and neck.</li>
    <li> I love this cream! I have very sensitive skin and found this cream more than 10 years ago...and have no plans to change moisturizers.</li>
    <li> Best cream ever! Hardly any smell at all so great if you are sensitive. I use it on my face and have been for years--and have very sensitive skin. No reaction to this product. Also great for very dry hands.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;ll make ya shiny, but it&#x27;s worth it. My skin loves this stuff.</li>
    <li> I had high hope about this cream because of the great reviews. However, the first time I used it on my skin, I got itchy and tingling sensation. It is also very greasy. I am going back to my Aveeno.</li>
    <li> My skin is extremely dry, especially during winter time.  The only cream that ever works for me is Eucerine, but it is pretty expensive and I use a lot of them.  I found Genes on Amazon, and decided to give it a try because so many people raved about it.  After using it for 3 weeks, I really like this product.  It is indeed for \\&quot;Dry and Sensitive Skin\\&quot;, and it is a huge bottle that would probably last for 5-6 months. Most importantly, it really keeps my face moisturized and smooth. Great buy!</li>
    <li> Positively the best crème product I have tried to date, not only for my cracked and dry feet (nothing to date is even close), it is the best shave crème I have ever used, your face and body will love you for using it.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin and have searched for years for something to sooth it.  This has been the best so far.  I found it that it IS greasy, despite reports to the contrary, but I still like it.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for years and it is the best crème on the market.</li>
    <li> My aunt was visiting from out of town, and asked to borrow some face cream.  Had her fill her jar with my Gene&#x27;s cream.  She has been using a brand for years, and was very pleased.  She wanted all the details, name, where to buy, so I sent her a jar.  She swears it made a big difference in her skin.</li>
    <li> I am temporarily living in a dry area and my skin absolutely craves moisture. I&#x27;ve never really been satisfied with any of the \\&quot;night cremes\\&quot; that i&#x27;ve used in the past until I found this one! It does go on pretty thick, and it does have a bit of an odd smell, but since I only put it on at night it really does not bother me at all. I also chose it because it says it is not only for dry skin, but also for sensitive skin, which I have, so this product is perfect for me! It does not clog my pores and does not make me break out of give me any kind of rash. It just feels soothing when I put it on. I have been using it for a little over a year (same jar) and I have not only noticed that my skin feels softer and looks brighter, but my scars from my acne appear to go away quicker!! I&#x27;m still battling the acne and this creme helps me keep up with the scars by not only healing the old ones, but preventing new ones.   Funny story:   I left the lid off over night and the next morning I was disappointed to find that there was a hard film on top of the lotion. I thought it was ruined. I scrapped the top off and threw it away. Sometime later I did it again, but this time I didn&#x27;t have time to deal with taking the film off just yet, so I put the lid back on and went about my day. Later in the evening I came back to the jar and opened the lid, expecting the hard film to still be there, but it was gone! Somehow it went back to normal!! It has other strange properties as well, like, as I use it, it leaves no residue on the sides of the jar as the amount inside goes down. It&#x27;s almost like a very moisturizing putty that can heal itself. Never had a creme like that before!</li>
    <li> Pros: Works quickly, improves dry cracked feet, quenches dry patches, works well for sensitive skin, great value, lasts all day    Cons: Very thick making it easy to over-apply (which can leave you feeling a bit greasy)      ***UPDATE*** January 17- I wouldn&#x27;t suggest putting this on your face if you have sensitive skin. I tried this on a small inconspicuous neck/face area and the skin was dry the next day like I might have a reaction with continued use. Gene&#x27;s still works extremely well for the rest of my body but I am sticking with CO Bigelow&#x27;s Deluxe facial moisturizer for my face. I included a link so that you can see what it looks like, if you&#x27;re looking for a face lotion. [[ASIN:B00276K6T0 Bath &amp; Body Works C.O. Bigelow No. 301 Deluxe Facial Moisturizer Replenishing Formula for Most Skin Types 2 fl oz (59 ml) Travel Size]]        Normally 3 days of use would not be enough to convince me to write a review for a product but I am truly impressed. I purchased this product after reading rave reviews. I wasn&#x27;t expecting the same results I read about but I got them anyway!   I&#x27;ll do my best to make this review comprehensive and update after longer use.      Backround:  I suppose part of determining if this info will help you is knowing how my skin compares to yours. Although, I am well into my twenties now, as a baby I suffered from eczema. As I got older my skin improved and was no longer inflamed but is still very dry (with a few extremely dry patches) and very sensitive (I have many allergies).       Product Packaging:  This product comes in a very simple yellowish cream colored plastic jar with gold lettering. The container is sturdy but do your best not to drop it. I am clumsy and have already broken the lid after dropping the jar onto the tile floor in my bathroom... twice. (I moved the rest of the product into a spare mason jar)      Product Use and Results:  3 days of use:  Genes creme is very thick. The first time I used it I had trouble spreading it. I would suggest using it immediately after showering when your skin is still a bit wet to avoid waste. Immediately after the first application I was worried that it was so thick that my skin would not be able to soak it up. After a few minutes those worries were put to rest. THIS PRODUCT WORKS!!! My skin has improved dramatically with only three days of use. I apply the creme once in the mornings after showering and it lasts all day (a miracle for someone with skin like mine). Yesterday I mixed a little plain johnson and johnson&#x27;s baby lotion into my hand with it before application to make it a bit thinner and more easy to spread. That worked very well so if you find this product too thick you might try that. I had dry patches that were so pronounced they looked like scabs and now those areas are as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom! I can&#x27;t believe it! Also, if you have dry cracked feet this product is for you! I applied genes to my dry feet and put on a pair of fluffy house socks on top. A few hours later I took the socks off to check and my feet were much improved (after only ONE application!). Bottom line, this product works and is worth the money.</li>
    <li> This cream is fabulous. After I broke by ankle I used this cream extensively on my feet. I really believe massaging genes into my foot each night after soaking it, really helped it to heal faster. My feet have no callouses or dryness ont them - feel like baby skin!!</li>
    <li> LOVE IT! The quality of the cream is excellent. It&#x27;s rich and smooth. i put on my face every single night (not during day as it doesn&#x27;t have SPF) and you feel the difference in the morning. No allergy reaction. There is no artificial scent which i like it very much especially for putting on the face. BTW, I ordered two and one of the products was broken. I contact them and the after-service was way above of my expectation. I am really happy with the service.</li>
    <li> this product was recommended to me by a friend, I am happy with the results and have now recommended it to other friends and family members who have started using it. Leaves the skin feeling soft and smooth</li>
    <li> Wonderful product- I use it everyday and my skin is so soft now. I have sensitive skin but Genes does not irritate me at all. I use it on my face as well as all over my body (it&#x27;s best to put it on right after you shower and blot dry).</li>
    <li> I mainly use this product for my body. I&#x27;ve notice my skin is a lot nicer and smoother. No problems.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for years. I LOVED it for my body. Kept my skin sooo soft, smooth and even toned. After finishing my last jar I went to a local store and re-upped for the next month. Low and behold I happen to look at the ingredients and saw &amp;#34;organic mineral oil&amp;#34; listed as the third ingredient. I was shocked because I didn&#x27;t remember seeing that ingredient on previous jars. I checked an old jar that I was almost done with and low and behold that ingredient was not there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mineral oil tends to just sit on my skin, never quite absorbing and leaves me dry. I can&#x27;t use products with mineral oil on my face because it causes an allergic reaction and rash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Knowing this,  I tried the &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; version anyway and I definitely can tell the difference. My skin isn&#x27;t as soft in the morning after my evening shower. The suppleness I once had is gone!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am soooooo disappointed! Why did the company feel the need to change my beloved cream??. :( Now I&#x27;m on the search for a new body cream. What a shame.</li>
    <li> This creme is quite heavy and can be used only at night. I&#x27;ve noticed a change in my complexion after a few days.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive for a lifetime supply</li>
    <li> It is a very good product which worked very well on my chemo sunburn. I will also use it for my coming radiation!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent body creme! I have been using this for years and I&lt;br /&gt;have bought this for my Mother and Aunt. It relieves itching and also preserves&lt;br /&gt;the skin from abrasions, too!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for two years.  I live in Colorado  at about 6500 feet, and spend my summers at an average of  about 9500 feet.  The air here is very dry and in the  winter  the dryness is is extreem  I use this daily.  My face and my  scalp are my primary areas.  This is not a cure.  Still, it does  provide comfort.  I use small amounts a few times each day.  In my scalp; I rub it in with vigor and it looks ok with my textured  cut.  I keep it with me all day to relieve itch and dryness.</li>
    <li> My family just loves this product!.  I have to buy my mom a few jars a year. It&#x27;s thick and creamy. Really really moisturizes skin. Ideal for someone that likes that coating consistency. I like it on my legs the best. I can only find it online, not at any stores.</li>
    <li> I use it on my face after shaving. It&#x27;s very heavy so a little bit goes a long way. Blemishes are so slowly disappearing. I have sensitive skin but this treats my skin extremely well. I personally enjoy the smell. Recommended</li>
    <li> This cream is outstanding for your skin. It is very emollient and keeps skin looking fresh. I highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> I have been using expensive ESTEE LAUDER face cream for 10 years, when I ran out of my ESTEE LAUDER this time though, I could not afford to buy more, because the Estee Lauder Re-Nutriv cream is $85 and I have been having hard financial times. When I was telling the Estee Lauder sales lady that I could not afford Estee Lauder anymore she recommended that I buy GENES VITAMIN E FACE CREAM, because it was the same exact thing for a less price (A true Angel). She told me to buy and it give it a try, because that was what she was using for years. I bought it and sure enough I feel like I am using my very expensive Estee Lauder cream, It is a miracle I found this cream. I even told my family and friends and now they are buying it to give it a try. It is heavy so a little goes along way, use it morning and night. I also use Original Dove soap to wash my face and I find that to be a perfect combination of products.</li>
    <li> I used this cream on a surgery scar and it is almost invisible.  The cream is amazing.I would recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by an old college friend who had the worst case of acne scars.  They use to run deep into his skin like tiny moon craters and were berry red in color.  I always felt bad for him.  When we saw each other again after a year, I was simply amazed by the smoothness, dewy look of his skin.  When he gave me the link, I hesitated because I was more sold on those department store cosmetic \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; products.  After another year went by, I saw him again and his skin is still as clear, dewy and fresh as ever.  In fact, there was nary a trace of his acne scars.  By then, I was just convinced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using my first jar for about 3 weeks and admittedly, I see the same, wonderful results. My skin is healthier, more dewy-looking and fresher than ever.  I&#x27;m taking off one-star because I wished they added some spf factor.  I have oily skin and when I use this with my Cetaphil spf50 during the day, it makes my face more oily so I have to layer on a lot of powder.  Other than that, I&#x27;m sticking with this product forever.</li>
    <li> This cream just arrived the other day. I have to say it smells wonderful! Sort of a clean, light lemon scent with a hint of vanilla perhaps? The cream goes on my skin and is easily absorbed. I&#x27;ve used it on my face and body - it feels great going on; my skin is moisturized and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  I think I am going to love, love, love this product.  I plan on sharing my \\&quot;discovery\\&quot; with my gal pals because I think they will love it too.  The price is very reasonable and when combined with other items from Amazon I got free shipping. You can&#x27;t beat that!</li>
    <li> Well, with so many reviews I thought it would be a good purchase to get this cream for my face. No matter how much you put into your face it looks like you put kitchen oil. It is gooey. it does not absorb. it is very shine..  for that price what I was expecting.. A good cream usually is expensive.  Anyways, I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> So let me start by saying this lotion is good stuff, it has natural oils and vitamins like A and E for good skin health. Now before you buy this and think your going to put it on and go and do things think twice! This stuff smells like a nursing home and i only use it before bed, so when i have it on what i smell like is not an issue. So if you want something that just works and don&#x27;t mind a odd but not horrible smell try it out.</li>
    <li> fades age spots on chest and hands</li>
    <li> I bought this to use on my pregnant belly. Although it is quite luxurious and smooth feeling, the smell is reminiscent of grannies and lingers all the live long day. I only used it about 5 times before giving up. Does its job, but literally not worth the headache.</li>
    <li> Could not live without it.  This is a great product.</li>
    <li> I used this stuff a ways back, a model I knew now in her late 60s who still had beautiful skin told me she used this stuff, gave me a container. This is the kind of stuff you always want to have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many lotions claim different things, I&#x27;ll leave it to the readers to do their own research.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not a doctor, here is just what I&#x27;ve noticed when using this cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use it on an iritated part of skin, bandage, skin is back to normal in overnight (Ever had that irritation near your hip from your jeans rubbing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use it on a cut that has closed up, accelerates the healing process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use it on you face after a shave, all the aftershave you&#x27;ll ever need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adds a nice healthly look to your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the above is what my experience has been. I apply it regularly to my face every morning and it looks and feels good. I don&#x27;t know the science behind this, I just know that when I use this once, I never have to use mostiorizer for the rest of the day. You can easily go more however I prefer putting it on daily. It also has excellent healing effects.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for years. I originally found it at Sam&#x27;s. I&#x27;ve always had problem skin and when I started using Genes I started getting compliments on my complexion. Yes, I use on my face and a few little dabs will do. It absorbs quickly and is a great makeup base. I use it head to toe and it does fade blemishes, especially age spots. In addition a diabetic relative finds it helps keep their feet healthy. Why spend big money on little jars of moisturizers, rejuvenating lotions or creams when you can buy this amazing product by the pound at a very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> m Skin is so soft and i em verry happy</li>
    <li> My sister introduced me to Genes Vitamin E Creme and I love the product.  It has made my skin soft and fresh with each daily use.  Even sunburn finds relief when the Genes Vitamin E Creme is applied.</li>
    <li> Diabetics often have difficulty with dry skin.  This stuff keeps my face looking youthful, takes care of rough patches on my elbows,  moisturizes my hands from washing dishes, and keeps my feet from cracking from dryness.  I absolutely love it, and can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
    <li> I read the comments of others before you buy this cream, the truth I think I think very high expectations and perhaps that is why I am not satisfied with the results. More than 2 months I&#x27;ve been using this cream, and although I have clarified the spots on my face that left the adult acne, has not entirely erased, possibly expect a miracle and I do not see beyond that. I will not say it&#x27;s a bad cream, because it is not .. acne constantly attacked me in the last month, has not reappeared, so I think that there are already many pros of this product, however I remove these stains so unpleasant ... continue to use and I build a lot of patience .. drentro&#x27;ll be back 3 months to tell that has happened since then. excuse my English, I use a translator: (</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard great things about this cream.  Have only had it a day, but it goes on very smoothly, and still felt hydrated at the end of the day.  The jar is much larger than expected.  It should last quite a while.  Thanks for the fast shipping!</li>
    <li> love this cream really moisturizes well</li>
    <li> I am a 40 years old Asian women with oily skin with miserable breakout history. I have ugly scars from acne breakout, big pores, and discolored patch on my cheekbones. Out of desperation, I paid a lot of money for department store, Drugstore, HSN, French, and Korean products for 20 years yet my skin never improved. I found the best result When I take off make up with Ponds, Clinique liquid soap(or any acne liquid soap), followed by this cream. Scars are much lighter and skin tone improved slowly but surely.&lt;br /&gt;Jan 2013 update; I tried retinol and chemical peel only to find out that my skin has hyperpigmentation tendency. This explains why Clinique increased melasma on my cheeks. My skin tone is very light for an Asian but it did not matter. Added Noxema before or after genes cream. Clear skin, smaller looking pores, no shine, no breakouts, very happy.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my surgical scar. Like it slot.</li>
    <li> I have psoriasis and even with RX and Dr. suggestions for creams, genes Vit E Cream has been the most help. No cures are there but it is a wonderful help. Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Josia</li>
    <li> I have purchased this large jar of moisturizing crème more than once, although one jar usually lasts over a year for me.  I use it liberally to combat &amp;#34;alligator skin&amp;#34; on my shins, &amp;#34;crepe skin&amp;#34; on my forearms, &amp;#34;dishpan&amp;#34; hands, and even use it as a moisturizer on my face and neck.  The scent is lovely, light, and not overpowering.  Nor does this cream leave me feeling &amp;#34;greasy.&amp;#34;  I tend to be allergic to many cosmetic creams on the market, but this has been a delight to use without any problems.  I will continue to order this product in the future.</li>
    <li> AMAZING! This is what I call a real moisturizer. I&#x27;m not sure about the collagen effect though but I don&#x27;t care. This cream moisurizes really well and smells like heaven. It&#x27;s very soothing and I think it doesn&#x27;t contain harmful chemicals cuz I use it on my body after shaving and it doesn&#x27;t burn, it also makes the skin less itchy so I really love it. Another thing is that I wash my hands excessively with hot water and always felt bad about the roughness of my hands in winter although I always use other products, kinda expensive hand creams but this cream is better than anything I ever used. Trust me on that, buy this cream if you need to add some softness and pleasant odor to your body</li>
    <li> I have mild psoriasis on my elbows and knees and if I don&#x27;t take care and moisturize those area, it would get worse and flare up even more. I was on the hunt for Vit E lotions to help calm my mild psoriasis and was researching product on Amazon and couldn&#x27;t have been any happier to have came across this. I&#x27;ve used many types of lotions and creams on my skin but nothing moistures my skin and helps my psoriasis (make it almost invisible) like Gene&#x27;s Vit E creme. I&#x27;ve notice that when I get lazy and skip using this creme for nightly for a week, my dry psoriasis patches on my elbow and knee becomes visible and scaley.  I&#x27;ve been using this creme for a few years now and will continue to do for the long haul as long as the quality of the product stays this good. Beware that the creme is a heavier type and you can feel it on top of your skin. I would recommend using it right after the shower when the moisture on your skin will help dilute the creme a little so applying the creme all over the skin will be a bit easier. Or I would recommend using this creme at night to wake up to smooth skin because I don&#x27;t like the thick lingering feeling on my skin during the day. The only reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars is there are parabens in this product, otherwise it&#x27;s a fantastic product.</li>
    <li> Love this creme, my skin looks radiant as long as i wear this product, great body and face moisturizer. Buy it again and again</li>
    <li> One jar of this stuff has lasted my entire pregnancy, with daily use. Compared to other &amp;#34;belly creams&amp;#34;, this stuff is super-affordable and works really well. Once I started really starting to show, my belly would start to get itchy, but this always helped calm it down. It&#x27;s also great for massage--thick enough that your skin won&#x27;t absorb it immediately. While everyone says that stretch marks are a pre-determined, genetic thing, I either have really great genes (ha.), or this stuff helped keep them at bay. Nary a one in sight and I&#x27;m 38 weeks.</li>
    <li> I have used Genes Vitamin E Cream for over 10 years and credit this cream for my smooth complexion.  At 51 years of age, I have very faint laugh lines - nothing more. I apply the cream at night before bedtime and in the morning under my makeup.  My skin feels soft and never dry.  I also use this cream on my neck and chest and have no age related issues there, either. Once, while traveling, I arrived at our destination and discovered I left my Genes at home and   had to purchase a different cream because I could not find Genes.  After two days on the &#x27;replacement&#x27; cream, my skin felt dry and tight.  Needless to say, now, when traveling, I double check and make sure I pack the Genes!  Last month while shopping with my daughter, the sales clerk asked me if my sister might be interested in an item ... she thought my daughter was my sister! Thank you Genes!!</li>
    <li> My chiropractor recommended this cream and I love it. I use it on my face and hands and I think it&#x27;s helping reduce my wrinkles! I&#x27;ll be buying more soon!</li>
    <li> I have used this cream on my face for about 5 years and it is wonderful.  People always tell me I look younger than my years and Gene&#x27;s cream certainly helps me.  It makes my skin supple, soft, and the cream immediately seems to hide wrinkles.  The cream goes on thick but within minutes it absorbs and does not feel heavy at all.  For travel I put some of Gene&#x27;s Cream in one of the small sample jars that I get from department store cosmetic companies.  Cannot be without this amazing cream!  My only wish is that it had an SPF variety for day time use.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get it from here but I got this from Sam&#x27;s Club for $7.50. It&#x27;s much more affordable to get it at Sam&#x27;s rather on this site (Amazon Prime isn&#x27;t too merciful with Strictly-budgeted College Students). But this skin cream works like a miracle. I have skin blemishes all over me and I tried every treatment on the market. Even Neutrogena won&#x27;t get past the acne prone dark spots on my back. So, I tried the skin cream after showering with Black Soap and it relived my dry skin and healed the light-colored blemishes. The dark spots will take time for the skin to be completely clear and healthy-looking. It&#x27;s feels a little greasy but it works. This is a must-have for anyone who wants healthy and soft skin. Give it a try! You&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
    <li> I have tried many other creams, including expensive ones.  But this is the best I have ever used, and it is inexpensive enough to use on my whole body.  My skin looked years younger immediately.</li>
    <li> As  far as the PRODUCT  is concerned, I already love it, BUT I take GREAT um bridge at amazon using slick tricks to hit my checking acct for an unauthorized 78 dollar recurring charge while I am out of state and less able to take such a hit from my DISABILITY stipend!!! Be warned,, papers are filed, and upon my return, FEDERAL complaint will be filed !!! I am EXTREMELY dissatisfied with amazons business practices, and will NEVER make ANY purchases through amazon ever again!!!</li>
    <li> I will admit I am a product junky and will try anything once, for this reason, I buy most of my products from places that have a 30 day return policy, like all the TV shopping networks.  I have purchased products as high as $100 only to find that they were nothing to write home about (or even to spend time reviewing on line!)  I found Genes at Sam&#x27;s club one day last winter while shopping in Sam&#x27;s  My face was feeling very tight and dry and I couldn&#x27;t stand it, so I bought this cream because it was cheap and I just wanted immediate relief until I got home.  It was sitting on the shelf right next to the $29.99 Oil of O&#x27;lay and picked up this big yellow jar for $7.99.  I just wanted something fast.  I opened it in the store applied a small amount to my face and continued shopping.  I did not notice any of the tingling that others mentioned feeling.  The smell was not that bad or even strong.  Yes it is greasy and it is thick, but it absorbed quickly into my skin.  I figured I would wash my face as soon as I got home (or even in the restroom right there in Sam&#x27;s if I felt a reaction to it....WELL LET ME TELL YOU....It is the ONLY thing I use now.  I LOVE THIS STUFF and you can believe all the other reviews you read here.  This is a miracle cream.  I also want to say, I don&#x27;t find it so thick I have to add water or any liquid to it, but I guess each person has their own preference and experience.  For me it went on easily (and it was greasy) the greasy feeling went away quickly leaving my skin smooth and rehydrated.  I think this is amazing stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is olive toned with freckles and I am 54 years old...I had a shallow kind of dull facial skin for a few years.  Since I have been using this, my skin tone has evened out, and I have to say, my skin looks so pretty and I look really good for a 54 year old.  They fine lines I have seem to have receded (I will not say they disappeared, but I will say they have not gotten deeper or multiplied.  It looks like myskin is reversing.  I will not use anything but this now.  I wish GENES has a skin cleanser to use with it (I like sets of the same product).  OH the deep \\&quot;thinker\\&quot; lines I had on my forehead have all but disappeared and I am serious here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not one to spend a lot of time putting lotion all over my body, but the results I have experienced with this on my face have encouraged me to rub it on my elbows, rough spots on my knees and my feet.  I found it to revitalize all the skin I tested it on.  What was a real eye opener was on my hands.  I rubbed a little on my hands and put some white cotton gloves on, my hands look younger and healthier than I ever remember them looking.  Amazing.  Actually this is a true story...I had a paper cut on my finger that I could not get to heal because I type a lot and I kept spiting it open.  I would put a bandaid on it and it would heal a little and then I would pick it and open it back up.  then I noticed that it was gone suddenly and I realized it was on the finger that I stuck in the jar to get the cream out...seriously it was gone in one day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so I need to tell you, if you are in Pittsburgh, you better get to Sam&#x27;s before I do because I go every two weeks and pick up two jars, because I&#x27;m afraid it will disappear there and I won&#x27;t be able to find it again.  Sam&#x27;s supply in Pittsburgh is diminishing!  Get this stuff, it&#x27;s amazining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated 11/26/2013 - Just want to point out that I am still using this stuff and still loving it!!! I still have not finished the first jar I bought and I do smear this stuff on my face.  Now that it is getting cold I will more than likely put even more on my face to keep it from drying out in the heated office I work in and then cold Pittsburgh temps.  And I have not cleared out the shelves at my local Sams. I stocked up on my supply - but so did Sam&#x27;s...LOL!  I have now converted 3 other people at my office.  This is the best $7.99 I have ever spent.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff please don&#x27;t ever stop selling it. It is the best vitamin e cream I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
    <li> Too oil for face and cause breakout, and no improvement at all after using for awhile</li>
    <li> My sister in Shreveport once sent me a jar of this amazing Vitamin E Creme.  I used it often and needed more and found the same jar on Amazon.  You will love it, I hope.  Anne J.</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading the good reviews. It is a good moisturizer but I found it to be a tad greasy for my liking.</li>
    <li> I bought it because it has so many good reviews, but it did not work for me. It causes skin irritation, dry and red.</li>
    <li> This is a nice cream. It is a little greasy.Put on a little at a time and let it sit</li>
    <li> I use this product on my body and face after a shower. It helps keep my body moisturized and isn&#x27;t too greasy. I also noticed it has improved my skin texture with regular use. The combined benefits and cost of this product earn it five stars from me.</li>
    <li> Works beautifully! Good service.</li>
    <li> This is what my dermatologist recommended I use after having aome lesions burned off my face and arms with liquid nitrogen. Her nurse actually gave me a tiny sample of it. This stuff helped eliminate the usual itching and burning feeling.</li>
    <li> I have been using this item for sun burns, after shave, any sort of mark on the skin. This Product is excellent. I highly recommend it. It gets the job done regardless of the price.</li>
    <li> This is one of the few cremes that works in the desertic area I live. It is thick so you have to allow time to soak into your skin. The container lasts for a very long time-dont need much!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0016ZZW7E GENES Vitamin E Swiss Collagen Creme - 16 oz (2 PACK - Total 36 oz)]]</li>
    <li> Smells like old lady perfume.  Very moisturiz</li>
    <li> Curious, I looked up methylparaben, phenoxyethanol, propylparaben, butylparaben as the reviewer below mentioned. All four are harmless ingredients, some which aid in preventing the growth of fungus and other bacteria. By all means don&#x27;t let that review scare you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I picked up a jar of this lotion at Sam&#x27;s Club to use on my diabetic husband&#x27;s dry skin patches on his hands, legs, and feet. In only two weeks it has already healed up the painful cracks on his fingers and some on his feet as well. We will continue to be regular users of this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this in a nail salon with very low expectations.  This has been nothing short of a miracle.  It is thick (as mentioned) but blends well and absorbs quickly for me (not as quick for my husband who has extreme dry hands).  But even more than that, the difference in my cuticles and nails is amazing.  I burned my finger cooking and immediately put this on...the next morning, blister but NO pain at all.  I had a terrible cut from a knife in my dishwasher, as it was healing I put this on it and NO pain! So, in addition to wonderful soothing skin benefits, it helps me heal tremendously fast.  (And I break out from EVERYTHING) I have no skin irritation at all from this.</li>
    <li> Wish I had known about this years ago!! What  a difference it has made (and still does) in my appearance!! YES, at my age (70) I have lines, but this product diminishes them.  This is a real value for the money $$ and will buy it again..I am even bragging about it and will tell people where I got it!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank You&lt;br /&gt;K. Fiore, NH</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and is wonderful for very dry skin</li>
    <li> When the package arrived I opened it up to find the top of the vitamin cream was completely off. Thankfully nothing was spilled and everything stayed in the container. Besides that it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> This stuff is fantastic. I have dry skin and use on my face and body at night--it is just so smoothing and moisturizing. It is a large quantity and I would definitely re-purchase.</li>
    <li> I use this for a night creme. It is thick but not very greasy. It seems greasy at first. It makes my skin look and feel healthy.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product  for several years. My husband and I use it every day for dry skin. It is excellent.</li>
    <li> I have had the face of Rosacea for years.  Red, dry cheeks, etc....But after a few days of using Gene&#x27;s Cream, my skin is soft and clear.  With no sign of redness.  Amazing!  I have worn makeup for years just to hide the redness.  But today I went out makeup free!  With no sign of red cheeks.  I can&#x27;t wait to get some for my sister as I know she will love it too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would 100% recommend Gene&#x27;s Cream.  This cream is the perfect mix of ingredients to actually improve your skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several months.  Helps keep my skin soft.  It lasts a very long time.  Good product.</li>
    <li> this is the best creme for older skin, you can also add essential oils to smaller amounts to massage in.</li>
    <li> so far I like it a lot.</li>
    <li> I love this cream, used to get it at SAMs club, but no longer a member. A great value price wise.</li>
    <li> Great product, Price too high. Used the product for a long time. The stuff really works,  Will buy at Sam&#x27;s next time.</li>
    <li> I love this cream because it absorbs in to the skin and leaves my skin very soft and NOT heavily perfumed.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and my skin is so much healthier with it than without it.  My local store stopped carrying it - I&#x27;m glad I can get it through Amazon.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how big of a container this was! It&#x27;s a huge amount of product for the price. My first thought were that the lotion is pretty thick though so a little does not go a long way. I really have to use quite a bit when applying to my body. The smell isn&#x27;t bad and it&#x27;s a bright yellowish color. I like it so far. It seems to work good.</li>
    <li> I find this to be a highly effective moisture cream.  It has a pleasant smell, spreads out easily and really helps my skin.</li>
    <li> Have used it for two years to replenish moisture to skin.  It works where other products failed to produce desired results.</li>
    <li> Love it. Have used it for many years and will continue for many more.  Goes on greasy but doesn&#x27;t stay greasy.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because it says it is good for sensitive skin. I tried using it on my hands, and they started burning, and I never used it again. I gave this to my mother who seems to like it. However, I would not recommend this product to those who truly have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> The ingredients in the product have been shown to cause:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Developmental/reproductive toxicity&lt;br /&gt;Ecotoxicology&lt;br /&gt;Endocrine disruption&lt;br /&gt;immunotoxicity&lt;br /&gt;Biochemical or cellular level changes&lt;br /&gt;Cancer&lt;br /&gt;Organ system toxicity&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;source:&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> This is just the best winter creme I&#x27;ve ever used.  I couldn&#x27;t find it in a local store, so I hunted it up online.  Makes a tremendous difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> I gave this product five stars because it helps with scars from burns, mosquito bites, and acne scars!!</li>
    <li> Amazing since the first use. I very satisfied with him, I will ask again,&lt;br /&gt;And smelled very nicely like the smell of baby. thank you</li>
    <li> I originally bought this for dry skin and it has done wonders. Also works nice for sunburns and has kept the stretch marks from my second pregnancy in check.</li>
    <li> My mother really likes this stuff on her legs, I find it a bit greasy myself, but it really helps her itchy legs more than anything else she has tried.</li>
    <li> During my second pregnancy, a patch of eczema popped up on my calf and I tried everything in the drug store (include a couple of prescriptions), but nothing helped. That eczema stayed for a year before I got this cream at Sam&#x27;s. Cleared it up. No more alligator elbow (as my husband calls it), either. I have combination skin, and some areas are very dry, while others are prone to break-outs. Have never had breakouts while using this cream. Regular lotions just don&#x27;t do it for me, anymore. This is my one and only all-over moisturizer now. Love it!</li>
    <li> This is the best creme to put on right before you go to bed and right after you get out of the shower if you have dry skin!  Especially in this cold winter weather.  It&#x27;s amazing!  I have never woken up and had my legs feel sooo soft and smooth.  I actually tried it at my friends house and fell in love. Ordered it the next day.  Sender got it here very quickly too.</li>
    <li> Started using this to rub on scars.  Now use it on face and neck also.  Helps skin to look younger and smoother.</li>
    <li> This is thick and greasy and lucious on the skin.  Wouldn&#x27;t wear it during the day, but at night is works wonders on the skin and it smells great.</li>
    <li> i have lupus and nothing including prescriptions works on my rough skin I use this on my whole body including face and it is amazing have ordered and reordered over a 2 year product will never use anything else,,,,although Sam&#x27;s club does have it much cheaper at $7 a jar</li>
    <li> This creams is magical!!!&lt;br /&gt;Normally I have problems with acne but this cream doesn&#x27;t make any reaction.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for three months and I love the way my skin looks. ☺♥</li>
    <li> I read a review which made me very concerned about some of its ingredience in this Genes Cream, methyl parable, phenoxyeparaben, prophyparaben and buthlpataben. It was said that these ingredience causes breast cancer. Need some feed back.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years not, because my skin is so sensitive  ,this is the first that has never been harsh on my skin, Thank you !!</li>
    <li> My Mammaw (grandma) introduced me to this product.  It is also sold at Sam&#x27;s Club.  I love it.  It feels like heaven on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She uses this for her nails because she loves to garden.  We all know that Vitamin E is good for your hair and nails.  I liked this product because not only does it feel like heaven on your skin after a long day, but it also has a nice, very light smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hands are indeed thankful for this particular cream.  It is worth the investment.  It will last you for at least one year.</li>
    <li> I had two patches of skin cancer removed from my face about 7 years ago.  Since then the two areas have been dry and rough.  I have tried many different types of sking creams to soften the skin and nothing worked. I recently bought Gene&#x27;s Vitamin E skin cream and it has helped a great deal.  I have only been using it about two weeks and the two dry rough spots are much better. One spot is gone and the other is about 75% better. I have also started using it on other areas of my body and my skin is much softer.  This is the best cream I have purchased for dry skin.</li>
    <li> Wifey uses it for preventing stretch marks while pregnant. She swears by it and I guess I can&#x27;t argue, she still looks great ;)&lt;br /&gt;But, I&#x27;ve used it when I ran out of lotion and it works great. Very moisturizing, little to no scent. Great for sensitive skin too.</li>
    <li> It hydrates very well, even my husband uses it! It is a very thick creme so a little goes a long way. Not oily once absorbed in skin.</li>
    <li> best hand cream in the world.</li>
    <li> very nice, and low price, i use it in every winter, good for dry skin, can&#x27;t found any cream better than this one</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used lots of different skin products...including some expensive Retinol based and several with a preponderance of natural ingredients. This product was chosen based on the ingredients. My fiancee is an Esthetician and she felt the ingredient list was sufficiently holistic to give it a try. I&#x27;ve had very good results. Smoothing out lines and wrinkles, hydrating and plumping up skin under eyes...a healthy glow to skin on face. You can get it for $8 plus tax at Sam&#x27;s club or for convenience order it here.</li>
    <li> I really like this one does not close spores to make you hot, and my Grandsonm</li>
    <li> I have used it for about 6 years.  I bought it at Sam&#x27;s club.  I am no longer a member but I was happy to find it at Amazon and I bought 4 for my daughters so they would leave my jar alone.  You don&#x27;t need a lot at one time for it to do the work.  We all love it.</li>
    <li> Love it well buy more when I run out. So soft really works on dry skin.use it ever day face arms</li>
    <li> I love this product, but I recently went to Sams Wholesale club and could have purchased it for 4.00 less - I was not happy about this as I have trusted Amazon to have great prices - won&#x27;t order this again.</li>
    <li> Love this product! It has worked great on soothing my dry skin in the winter, works to soothe a sunburn, and also keeps my face moisturized! Super! Super! Super!</li>
    <li> I read a revue by S.Comacho. She said she had purchased this for $6.00. Can someone tell me where to buy this product for $6.00?&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;Sandra</li>
    <li> My wife, for whom I ordered this product, is very happy and in fact this was the second time I had ordered it for her via Amazon.</li>
    <li> Love it.  This is the only crème that I can use on my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Buy all the time, very good product vitamin e cream both my wife &amp; I use nightly</li>
    <li> Very good for dry skin)</li>
    <li> This stuff is GREAT! I used it while pregnant and only got one tiny little stretch mark. Was it my genes or my Gene&#x27;s?</li>
    <li> This cream is amazing! I don&#x27;t even know how to describe it, feels like cold, fresh spring water on your face on a very hot day. And after I applied, my skin had a peachy feeling (without the fuzz). It is not a heavy cream and works very good with my dry skin but I don&#x27;t know how well would work for an oily skin. I&#x27;m using it for few days only so I have no idea how anti-aging it is but my dry, 50 yrs old face looks and feels revived.</li>
    <li> I was advised about this product from one of my sisters.  She raved so much about it that I decided to purchase it.  I enjoy the texture of it and how it makes  my skin feel.  I gave one of my friends a jar of it and she really loves it.</li>
    <li> I think that the product was very good, leaves the skin mostured and I have a bad problem with rosacea, and is really easy that my skin act up, but with this product has not being a problem. I didn&#x27;t gave it 5 stars because it gets very thick if you put some more, but over all is a very good product.</li>
    <li> poor packaging, it looks like fake</li>
    <li> So creamy and a great purchase price.</li>
    <li> The vitimin E cream came right on schedule and I am very pleased with my purchase.I placed a second order a week later and  had the same experience again.</li>
    <li> I buy this for my mom and myself help to hidrate the dry skin, I will recommend to any body with the dry skin problem,</li>
    <li> This is a staple in my house for battling dry skin during winter months. It works wonders! I wouldn&#x27;t use it in the summer because it&#x27;s too heavy, but perfect for the winter.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over 10 years and really like it. I used to get it at SAMs Cllub but I dropped my card there when I went looking for another source I found it here.</li>
    <li> Cost effective. Makes my aging skin feel very nice without feeling greasy.</li>
    <li> This vitamin E cream is wonderful for moisturing your neck and face. The size is huge 16 OZ&lt;br /&gt;It arrived very fast and was packaged well.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this product again. It works well for dry skin and sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love my Vitamin E Creme!  I use it after a bath and through out the day when I wash my hands.  My skin has gotten softer &amp; smoother since I started using it.  What I love about it, I can use it on my face and neck plus all over my body!  I don&#x27;t have to use 3 or 4 products all the time.  It will make your skin (on your face) have more oil so I don&#x27;t use it before putting on makeup but I do use it at other times on my face.  Just a little goes a long way so it doesn&#x27;t take as much as you would think to cover the whole body!</li>
    <li> This is like liquid gold.. I use it on everything...even bruises...</li>
    <li> Heavy cream.  I don&#x27;t use this when I know humidity will be high.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best products on the market. I order online because the nearest store I can buy this product is 35 miles.  I love it on my skin.  My daughters love it too.</li>
    <li> moisturizer a little bit</li>
    <li> I bought this item about a year ago when I needed a new lotion for my face. I didn&#x27;t like it at first because it felt very heavy and I had trouble putting make up over it. I used it for my legs every so often, and I liked it but I eventually just stuck it in the back of the cabinet. Recently I developed a very large and embarrassing dry flaky patch of skin on my face. I used Jojoba oil and various lotions to try and get rid of it, but nothing was working. I got very discouraged. I remembered I had this lotion and I put a bit on the dry patch. I went to sleep and in the morning the patch was GONE!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So even though I do not like it for an every day lotion, it does WONDERS for horribly dry skin. Thank goodness I had this lotion!!</li>
    <li> I needed some vitamin E cream for stretch marks, and so far this cream was a LOT for my money and available for Prime as well. It&#x27;s made my skin soft so far,and we&#x27;ll see how it does with stretch marks.</li>
    <li> I have a horrible, flaky patch of skin RIGHT under my eye;  it&#x27;s discolored and I swear it looks like I have a black eye. Dermatologist diagnosed contact dermatitis, probably caused by the eye makeup remover I was using. He prescribed a cream, that even with my insurance, was *700* dollars. Needless to say I didn&#x27;t get it. I spotted this stuff at Sam&#x27;s Club and thought, &amp;#34;What the heck.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I swear to you, it&#x27;s helping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dry patch isn&#x27;t totally gone, but it truly does seem to be responding to this cream. I tried every other lotion/cream I had at home...and this seems to actually be working. Try it!</li>
    <li> Love it! I use it a night as moisturizer all over face and bdy. Smells clean. Arrived quick!</li>
    <li> I expected more.  It moisturizes my skin for an hour or two, and then all dry spots are dry again.  This creme doesn&#x27;t heal, only softens for a couple of hours</li>
    <li> I use Genes Vitamin E Cream as a hair and scalp treatment it makes my hair soft and shiny very easily to comb.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a huge amount, so I can spread it everywhere quilt-free.  I keep one by my bed and added some collagen and hyalonic to it and use it only for my face.  love it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been in Afghanistan for a year and a half (and counting) and the water out here is absolutely terrible; it&#x27;s full of chlorine and other skin drying material. Anyway, after about 2 months of being out here I started to get this pry patch on my left breast but I thought it was ring worm until I showed a friend and she told me that it was dry skin. Well my guy friend introduced me to this lotion shortly after but I was a little reluctant at first being that I have sensitive skin....all I can say is WOW!!!! After about a week it completely cleared up. It&#x27;s also safe to use on your face, it makes my face glow. I&#x27;ve been using it everyday now for about 8 months and I get compliments on how beautiful my skin is all the time. I would 100% recommend to a friend...this is the only lotion I will use FOREVER lol...I&#x27;m serious tho!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this cream. It&#x27;s not fancy or high tech. It&#x27;s just simple, soothing and basic.&lt;br /&gt;I slather it on every night before I go to sleep. My skin is plumper and softer. My forehead lines are not gone but I think it&#x27;s time to look at Mr. Botox for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was also recently scratched on the face by a woman I  was trying to help during an epileptic attack. It was a nasty scratch but not very deep. It hurt very much.&lt;br /&gt;And here it is 6  days later and my skin is almost completely healed. I used this cream and tea tree oil applied many many times during the day and the scar is almost gone now. It has healed and now only a slight faint pink line remains. WOW!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a BIG TUB. Seriously. It will last you six months at least.</li>
    <li> On the advise of a friend I tried this product. It has helped the skin on my hands and arms very much.</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of creams as I have sensitive skin and strongly believe in applying quality products. I discovered this in Sam&#x27;s Club and absolutely love it. I have introduced it to friends and family and everyone is hooked now!  Must try.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best \\&quot;winter\\&quot; cream I&#x27;ve ever used. My skin stays soft all day long! It is a bit on the oily side, which isn&#x27;t a problem for my alligator skin. I will be purchasing a few more tubs to keep on hand. No pun intended :)</li>
    <li> To be blunt, this stuff smells disgusting.  It is the cheap, perfumey scent that I associate with old women who don&#x27;t bathe frequently.  As a lotion it is not that great.  It goes on sort of waxy and turns really white, which takes a few minutes to fade.  It doesn&#x27;t absorb very well and feels greasy for a long time.  And the scent never goes away.  I first used it on my hands and had to wash them about 5 times before they stopped smelling.    Do not buy this unless you have no sense of smell.</li>
    <li> I have extremely dry, cracked heels and the rest of my feet are very dry and flakey. I used this 2 nights with socks on after  application and my feet are as soft as a babys behind. I have used  many creams in my life and none have done what this has done for me. I rushed back to my local Sams Club and bought 4 more jars. I am afraid they will run out. I was so, so sceptical because I have spent loads of money on creams and lotions and nothing touches this...NOTHING!PLEASE DO NOT STOP MAKING THIS. I AM TAKING SOME TO MY PODIATRIST BECAUSE IT DOES NOT EVEN COMPARE WITH PRESCRIPTION CREAMS HE HAS GIVEN ME.!</li>
    <li> Over the years, I have been using many hand cremes... in Wisconsin winters, its a necessity..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very surprised as to how well this works. It made my hands feel soft.. Other creams, I had to apply a few times a day.. this one, once or twice a day keeps my hands soft!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Folks - don&#x27;t be dissuaded because it is cheap.. This is better than any other hand creme you can buy! Really! try it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ps: I found this for almost half Amazon&#x27;g price at Sams club - around $8 at Sams.. Sorry Amazon.. you have to adjust the price.. Even if prime shipping.. you should not be charging twice, yes?</li>
    <li> My friend recommended this to me. I love lathering it on after a bath and to put on some fuzzy socks. Only complaint is the smell. I generally buy unscented but w the socks I can tolerate it.</li>
    <li> This creme works great!</li>
    <li> My sister uses this crème.  I tried hers and thought it was a bit greasy at first but quickly realized that it was being absorbed into my skin and the greasy feeling disappeared quickly.  I immediately picked up my computer, logged on to Amazon, added this to my cart and keep it nearby at all times.  My skin is in better condition than ever!</li>
    <li> I love this cream.  I&#x27;ve used it for over 5 years and it is thick and creamy, but very absorbing. You can turn the jar upside down and it is so thick nothing would fall out.  I used to buy it at Sam&#x27;s Club (cheapest price) but our store closed so there isn&#x27;t one nearby. Glad to find it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Genes Vitamin E Creme Swiss Collagen for about 4 years now. It says on my skin much longer and it does not have that greasy feeling after applying it. I live in New England, and the cold temperatures here dries the skin so much and so fast. Genes Vitamin E solves all that, and keeps my skin moist and protected.</li>
    <li> Wonderful for dry skin.</li>
    <li> Genes Vitamin E Creme Swill Collagen Complex Moisturizing Creme is AWESOME.  I have dyshidrotic ecxema and nothing works except for this!  I use this cream every morning after I shower on my feet and my ecxema disappeared.  I didn&#x27;t think I would ever find anything to help with this condition, but I did!  I will never use anything else again.</li>
    <li> Love it, I have used it thru both pregnacies and I have no stretch marks!</li>
    <li> I live in the desert and this product really works. It softens your skin and lasts all day without feeling heavy or oily.</li>
    <li> great! I really love it.</li>
    <li> I just bought 1 jar from SAMs Club for less than $8 plus tax. It is a 16oz jar. The cream seems to work well for dry skin.  I see results when I apply it to neck and my hands.  The smell once you get use to it, it is okay.</li>
    <li> I have used Genes Vitamin E Creme for along time. It was first recommended to me by my physician at the time. I&#x27;m glad I finally get a chance to write about it.&lt;br /&gt;I think the world of skin care has become unlimited. A product for any issue you might have.  I have very dry skin.  I much prefer moisturizers to lotions and creams. I do a lot with my hands so I can&#x27;t use products that leave a greasy residue on my skin or my hands.  I need a product that really soaks into my skin and only leaves soft skin behind.  Genes Vitamin E Creme does exactly that for me. I use it as a moisturizer on my face and especially on my hands and feet.&lt;br /&gt;In the southwest, when you damage your skin aloe vera is great.  I then use Vitamin E Creme to help heal the skin and minimize scarring.  It&#x27;s very rich and concentrated so a little goes along way.  If you have gone through countless products that claim not to be greasy but still are, give this product a try.  This is a big jar and will last a long time even with daily applications. I have recommended it to many throughout the years and still do.</li>
    <li> good deal, useful, scar healing.</li>
    <li> My friend had a fall, badly cut his face around his eye socket. His doctor told him about this particular skin cream to use as the wound healed, to prevent scaring. Doctor recommended it over anything he could prescribe. So, I have some chronically dried skin. I bought some for myself and I&#x27;ve used nothing else since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The container itself is surprisingly large. It is down right sturdy. One could reuse the container to store nails or something in it after it is empty. The container, when empty, is not as yellow as when it is full. The cr&amp;egrave;me is yellow. It is soft, light, and whipped to the touch. It is easy to spread, but it spreads more like a paste than lotion - even thicker, high-quality lotion. There is so much of it for the cost, I&#x27;m actually a little wasteful with it. It has a nice fragrance, but not too overpowering for a man to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a better price at Sam&#x27;s club in the store. About $8, I think. Sorry Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice cream..Wonderful rich cream.  The jar lasts a long time.. I sometimes mix it with my regular cream.</li>
    <li> Love this.  I tried just vitamin E oil and that irritated my skin.  This lotion has vitamin E and it is for sensitive skin and does not irritate the surgery area.  Fast delivery and thank you for an excellent product!</li>
    <li> I am really disappointed .. was so looking forward to try it out after a girlfriend suggested it. The scent is so strong and unpleasant to me that I don&#x27;t want to use it. Tried to ad some perfume to change the scent but that didn&#x27;t work. I am not saying that it is a bad product it just doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> My mom uses this under her face make up every day. She looks much younger than her true agen</li>
    <li> For those of you who may have dry feet and calluses. I am here to tell you that this is a wonderful product. I use this along with the EMJOI MICRO-PEDI BATTERY OPERATED CALLUS REMOVER. This creme really keeps your feet soft and lovely. 5 star product!!!!</li>
    <li> It is okay.  It is definitely good for dry winter skin.  The smell is tolerable.  It will last a long time, and I will use it, but I will not repurchase.</li>
    <li> Smells fine stays moist on skin just dont over do it! I have used it for years and I have sensitive skin! Loreal hydra renewal burnt my skin and made it red so went back to this!</li>
    <li> Someone gave me a jar...first time I used it I thought it was a bit greasy...it took about 20 seconds for it to totally absorb...best stuff for winter dry skin...I&#x27;ve given it to several others...one friend put it on her desk for folks to use...everyone has come back to ask WHAT IS THAT STUFF?  IT&#x27;S FABULOUS!  Works on all parts of the body.  FYI: Sam&#x27;s Club sometimes has it for $5 per jar!!  sorry Amazon.</li>
    <li> It works for me!!! I find it noticeable, with softer &amp; smoother skin after using it for 3 weeks. When rubbing onto face, you feel the skin absorbs fast, though somehow greasy but smell is pleasant and mild. The size of the bottle worth the price &amp; product quality. Absolutely will use it continuously!</li>
    <li> this really works for dry skin.  smells good and goes on thick and really moisturizes your skin better than anything i have used.</li>
    <li> This cream is Excellent!  I use just a little on my face in the winter and all over my body all year round.</li>
    <li> It truly is amazing. You can use it anytime of day and get great results. But a noticinle difference is when I wash my face at night lather this on and in the morning wake up to a glowing face!!!</li>
    <li> I brought this product in Jan/2012 and still have it 12/2012. I am going to buy another one next month. my skin looks amazing, I am over 30 and my skin is smooth, clear, no wrinkles and radiant. I like this product a lot!!!! If you want even toned skin, no wrinkles, no pimples, no blackheads please buy this product. a little goes a long way so don&#x27;t use too much. this product can be used up to one year. It works on my dry to oily skin.</li>
    <li> One of my v close friends introduced me to this creme and i absolutely love it in the winters. If you put it at night and even day, it lasts for a longtime without your face/skin feeling dry. I don&#x27;t like to use this in the summer but some people might.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly on skin !!!</li>
    <li> My husband loves this cream. It&#x27;s rich and has a nice smell, and it helps with his dry skin.</li>
    <li> Very effective at softening and moisturizing.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I purchased it all the time from a local club. However, they no longer carried it. This is some freat moisture. It also removes stretch marks, ance scars, discoloration, sunspots, and scars honsetly just about anything...In my opinion. I would recommend this cream to anyone. Of course you have to use it daily. Or at least I do. Three times a day. Vit E is known to removed unwanted scars/marks. Overall great product and awesome price.</li>
    <li> Genes Vitamin E Creme Swiss Collagen Complex Moisturizing Creme for Dry and Sensitive Skin 16 oz. Very good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never received package due to packaging damage at the Post office.</li>
    <li> I recently had major knee surgery and was left with 4 incision scars. About a week and a half after surgery, I began applying Genes Vitamin E Cream to them and I have noticed a significant difference in how they look. They are less red, smaller, and thinner than they were before I began applying. I would recommend this to anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to be left with post-surgical scars.</li>
    <li> My daughter has extremely dry skin and this helps.  She has tried numerous other lotions, but this one keeps her skin better.</li>
    <li> Genes Vitamin E Crème is a great moisturizer for face and body.  I use a little under my makeup and goes on beautifully.</li>
    <li> I had knee surgery, and the scars were forming keloids.  My surgeon recommended applying Vitamin E to them twice a day.  I bought this jar based on some of the reviews.  I&#x27;ve been using this cream for about 6 weeks on those fresh scars, along with some older ones, and all of them have become much smaller.  The largest keloid is now about 1/4 the size it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The jar is huge.  I know it says 16 ounces right on it, but somehow I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be so large.  In 6 weeks, I&#x27;ve hardly made a dent.  And I love the scent!</li>
    <li> this is what you need! nothing else! It is simply one of the best products out there.  Dont be out the loop and purchase something mediocre!</li>
    <li> Another old time lotion that I use all over my aging skin.  I am in a wheelchair so tend to get dry skin especially on my feet.  I love it, the Collagen tightens the skin while leaving it soft as silk.  Please don&#x27;t ever stop making this Genes lotion!</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely wonderful, and has made a huge difference in my very dry skin!</li>
    <li> Very good quality and price---very pleased!</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer for dry skin</li>
    <li> I used this creme at least a few times during pregnancy. I had no stretch marks after delivering my baby the only place had stretch marks was where I didn&#x27;t  think put the cream ( on my sides and leg)</li>
    <li> Very fast delivery! I have heard so many good things about this cream and I cannot wait to try it!</li>
    <li> Super nice cream!!! Love it</li>
    <li> like the consistency of the Vitamin E Crème.  Would possibly reorder in the future.</li>
    <li> Love this cream it really helps dry skin - use it in the desert.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a month, and at 26 weeks along I have no stretch marks. It&#x27;s also great for a facial moisturizer, although when used alone it makes my face look shiny. Fine under make up. I don&#x27;t have the shine issue when used anywhere else on the body</li>
    <li> This works better for me than the prescription cream that I was prescribed by my doctor for my dry face patches.</li>
    <li> I have very dry cracking skin on my lower legs due to diabities, this product works very well keeping my skin moist and from cracking.&lt;br /&gt;5 Stars</li>
    <li> Love it so much I ordered 2 for the price of 1!  Very nice mild smell and most importantly very emollient.  Highly recommend</li>
    <li> I hope they never stop making this stuff!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like it in the first place, because it&#x27;s creamy on my skin once you put it on. But my sister-in-law keeps telling me it&#x27;s very good one. So I tired it again. After a few minutes, I feel my skin very soft and smooth and it stays for the entire day. Since I have tried so many other brand, I think this one is better with affordable price. Now I use it every day, specially in this dry winter season, it make you feel really good !</li>
    <li> I use this everyday... it is wonderful!</li>
    <li> At 65 years old - I have used alot of different cremes - received this one as a gift and was so happy to find it on Amazon.  It has been wonderful to my skin - smells great and is not greasy.  Even my daughter loves it.  Also great on you face.  I really am so happy to have found it here.  Can&#x27;t get enought of this cream - plus read the label - it has wonderful ingredients in it.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my best friend who needs hand creme all of the time.  My daughter uses it when she comes home.</li>
    <li> My nail tech recommended it for my dry heels.  It really does moisturize.  I could see the difference in the first few days.</li>
    <li> Very very bad&lt;br /&gt;One star is too match</li>
    <li> Great product, Delivery on time.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected. Shipping was good.</li>
    <li> My daughter has eczema on her fingers and we&#x27;ve tried everything.  This cream helps the best.</li>
    <li> It has a mild pleasant smell  and moisturizes very well. It keeps your skin smooth and soft.No more dry skin for me</li>
    <li> Amazing cream. Wish I had found it sooner! I use it primarily for my face but I have used it on my body and works just as well. Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Great cream!  Really makes my skin feel soft instead of so dry!  I know I will continue to use Genes Vinamin E Swiss Collagen in the future.</li>
    <li> I have used this before, I loved it, and it lasted a really long time, and the label was nearly worn off.  I tired to find it again at several different stores and could not, so I was thrilled to see Amazon had it on line.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Amazon!</li>
    <li> I use this while doing a massage. Good stuff: not too greasy, with no smell. For those who like Obsession, you will want something else.</li>
    <li> Product feel good just got it, haven&#x27;t used it much for me to give a fear review</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several years and it&#x27;s wonderful.  It makes your skin feel so soft and silky.  Would recommend everyone to try it.</li>
    <li> I honestly loveeeeee this cream! I tried it for just a week and I see tremendous improvement ! I use it on my stretch marks! And it&#x27;s actually helping it to fade! I also use it on my dry feet! It helps to make them feel smooth. I even apply this cream to my face! My face looks great! I would encourage everyone to try it. It also has a nice light sent</li>
    <li> The best cream really works on super dry skin</li>
    <li> This is a huge jar, with nice ingredients for a very low price!  This should last me a good long time, because I only use a small amount on my combination dry patches of skin!  It&#x27;s heavy, but it sinks in after about ten minutes, and seems to stay put!</li>
    <li> I buy and use this moisturizing cream regularly. It keep my skin moist and hydrated. It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
    <li> I have spells where my skin gets super dry, flaky and causes me to itch (especially on my legs). Everything I try only relieves it temporarily. Genes Vit E Creme has become my solution and I think it&#x27;s amazing.&lt;br /&gt;PROS: Deeply moisturizes my skin, makes my skin supple and healthy shiny. I love to put this on before I go out in shorts and a tank top because it makes my legs and arms glow and look sexy. Also, a LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY. This creme is very thick and in the three months I&#x27;ve been using all over my body (not my face), it barely looks used. It has not caused me any allergic reactions or bumps.&lt;br /&gt;CONS: It is very thick and I don&#x27;t find that it absorbs in quickly or cleanly. But then, if it did, it would be as useless and offer the short-term relief that all the other light weight products on the market do. I use it before bed so it has time to soak in, or I make sure to give it time to absorb before I get dressed or go out.&lt;br /&gt;Note: I have not tried it on my face, so I can&#x27;t comment on it&#x27;s performance for this area.</li>
    <li> I work as a demo person at Sam&#x27;s Club and we have demonstrated this product several times. The very first time I did it, I bought a jar to take home because it felt so good on my hands in the store. I didn&#x27;t really think that using it on my face would be a good idea, as I am prone to breakouts and have acne scarring to prove it, but I tried it anyway just to see. Let&#x27;s just say that I&#x27;ve never looked back or bought another moisturizer. No breakouts, no dry spots, just soft skin everywhere (face, arms, feet, you name it). The jar lasts forever since a little goes a long, long way with this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent could be better, but honestly...it doesn&#x27;t cling to my skin or linger around long enough to make a difference anyway.</li>
    <li> It moisturizes well. Once it&#x27;s absorbed leaves skin feeling very soft.&lt;br /&gt;My issues with it:&lt;br /&gt;the smell. it smells of old ladies. I can&#x27;t find another way of describing it. A cloying baby powder smell? But not one you would associate with the softness of of a baby. Its weird and strong. Find myself reluctant to use it because of the smell. Try mixing with a spritz of scent you like to alleviate the issue. There are so many good products to try out there, I really do think this particular issue will prevent me from purchasing this product again.&lt;br /&gt;Second issue, maybe a pro for some: VERY greasy. Takes a while to rub in and absorb which if you are in a hurry makes for an awkward dressing process.</li>
    <li> works well, very moisturizing</li>
    <li> I finally got the product that was ragging the reviews from sites of Youtube, bloggers, google, and amazon just to name a few. So I bougt it for my stretch marks after having a child and growth marks. I just got it in the mail and Im excited. I took a shower and immediately tried this product and felt the difference Ive never felt with ANY lotion. The smell is fresh and not overwhelming or overbearing. It didnt make me itch or feel really oilly. I cant wait to see some results.</li>
    <li> Best creme ever !!! Thanks so much ! ! !</li>
    <li> Best cream ever 4 extreamly dry skin.  Been using it for 7 yrs now.  Can&#x27;t go wrong. I use it on my face mostly cause I have really dry skin and you can use it all over ur body and feet too.  The only problem I have is the availablity in stores, It&#x27;s only sold @ Sams Club or online.  It used to be sold thru Walmart, but not anymore, sad :(  Anyway, I&#x27;m just glad that I can still get it online cause I don&#x27;t live anywhere near a Sams Club.  Peace  :)</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by my dermatologist 5 years ago. Bought my first one from him and it was expensive. Then I found out Sam&#x27;s club and Amazon only sell it. For the price you pay it does a wonderful job. Lasts a long time. Use on my face 2 times daily and my body after showering. I have spent so much money on very very expensive moisturizers. Can not come close to this product. I am 65, and this cream keeps my face almost wrinkle free and soft. It is a nice thick cream. Pricing is out of this world for what it does to your skin texture. Would never ever consider purchasing any other moisturer. Have gotten several friends hooked on this item. Do not even try any other cream, just buy this. You will love it</li>
    <li> Love this cream. It is thick and rich. It calms my itchy legs and is easy to use from the jar as you can control the amounts need easier.</li>
    <li> My uncle told me this cream was the best and he was right. I tell everyone about it.</li>
    <li> Great fast shipping!!!</li>
    <li> My wife has been using this for years and loves it. At 81 she looks 61..........Well worth a try. She did..</li>
    <li> I love this creme,it is awesome! My skin loves it so much I will continue to buy it.</li>
    <li> Twenty words...here goes. Before retiring for the evening I like to use Genes to remove the make up off my face. I do NOT use it to remove eye make up. Then I wash my face with Dove soap and pat dry. ;-D</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter per her Dr.  She had surgery recently and her doctor recommended applying this everyday to her surgical incision. It&#x27;s been two weeks since her surgery and her incision looks so good.  It is also good for burns, scars, etc.  Try it!</li>
    <li> The cream is yellow and it takes sometime to absorb. Though it doesn&#x27;t dry out easily. It will take a long time to finish the whole jar.</li>
    <li> It smells nice, but that is about the only thing I like about this product. I have some minor scars on my stomach and I have been applying this product now for a few months onto them and nothing has changed. It applies thick and smears everywhere, you can&#x27;t really apply it to a small area, you have to rub it in  a bigger area because of the way it spreads. It doesn&#x27;t absorb well into the skin at all, you have to spend some time rubbing it in. I am very disappointed in this product.</li>
    <li> I have very bad calluses on my feet.  Since using this product I have no more calluses!  Love this product!  Would recommendM</li>
    <li> Super moisturizing; I can use it on my face without breaking out; and so cheap!  I use this as my basic body lotion but I&#x27;ll also use it on my face in the winter, especially around my eyes.  FYI: they sell it at Sam&#x27;s Club (at least the one in Castleton (Indianapolis), Indiana) for around $8.  They might have it at other Sam&#x27;s Club locations as well.</li>
    <li> This cream is amazing. It is thick and goes on easy. Takes a little to soak in the skin, but it makes my skin feel silky and smooth.</li>
    <li> I suffered for years (at least 10) with Psoriasis and tried every treatment know to the medical field.  After being discouraged I then  started a self-induced regimen of lightly exfoliating in the shower and following with this creme.  Within months (2 or 3 at the most) all of my dry flaky patches were gone and three years later they still are. If you have this problem it can&#x27;t hurt to try and I thank God everyday for his guidance in trying this regimen.</li>
    <li> creamy, smells ok, mixes well with other oils,  gives skin a brilliant glow, lasts long enough, even works for those cracked heels! great price!</li>
    <li> a very practical products that works effectively.  This is a really good buy.  I would recommend this to everyone who would like to diminish their wrinkles.  Just use this everyday with a clean face that&#x27;s it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this creme for years and could no longer find it.  I hadn&#x27;t even considered trying to find it on Amazon.  So glad that I thought of it!</li>
    <li> Works great on a scar I have from recent surgery.</li>
    <li> Seems moisturizing, but I could not bear the smell!!!</li>
    <li> I found this years ago at SAMS CLUB. I and several family members LOVED it. I am so happy that I found it here on Amazon! This is the best moisturizer I have ever used. The 13.00 price is a steal and comparable to Sams price. This tub lasts a very long time. I am 55 years old and have always had very sensitive facial skin. I am VERY choosy about what I use on my face. Normally I would NEVER use a body cream on my face. This stuff is so gentle, has a great, gentle, clean scent.  It is fantastic for your entire body especially in the winter. Although you should NOT tan, it is great for  post sun. Forget department store, high priced, &amp;quot;perfumey&amp;quot; &amp;quot;miracle&amp;quot; creams. This stuff is fantastic and a GREAT DEAL!!!!</li>
    <li> Fixed all my skin woes in Afghanistan. Nothing else would. Great stuff.</li>
    <li> It is by far the best cream I have ever used. It leaves my skin feeling soft and moisturized. I would recommend it to anyone!!</li>
    <li> This cream is fantastic.  It is creamy and not greasy.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this.</li>
    <li> I like the texture of the cream and all the ingredients in it. The price is excellent. I give it a 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with dry, itchy, eczema-prone skin on my legs for the last couple of years.  I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different products.  I was starting my usual round of &amp;#34;nothing&#x27;s working, so try something new&amp;#34; when I stumbled across this cream.  The reviews were fantastic and I figured I had nothing to lose.  This is the first and only thing that has worked for me.  In a little over a week my skin is doing great!  Really, it&#x27;s just calm, smooth, little to no itching, my rashes have cleared up. I had a nasty scratch on my leg which had scabbed over and it has healed much more quickly than usual after using this cream.  Had an itchy spot on my leg yesterday and applied some of this cream immediately - calmed it down better than my anti-itch cream and didn&#x27;t flare back up.  I had gotten to the point where I had to reapply moisturizer to my legs before bed but now I can just put this on in the morning and it&#x27;s fine for the rest of the day.  Even tried it on my face when I was especially dry and it felt wonderful, no bad effects - just a little irritating around the eyes, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for that area.  If you&#x27;ve tried everything and nothing&#x27;s working, try this.  And, yes, it is quite thick but I don&#x27;t find it sticky or overly greasy - when you have super dry skin you don&#x27;t mind a little grease.  It does absorb.  I also like the smell, it&#x27;s soothing, not overpowering and fades.  Wonderful cream, I hope they never stop making it!</li>
    <li> I first bought this at Sam&#x27;s to use as a body cream for dry skin in the winter. It worked so well on my arms, legs and feet that I tried using it as a face cream. I normally use Olay Regenerist Daily Regenerating Serum which I have been using for a couple of years. But when I tried the Genes Vitamin E Cream Swiss Collagen Complex Moisturizing Creame on my face it had such a moist and soothing feeling that I kept using it as a facial moisturizer. After a couple of days I eliminated the Olay regenerates product in the morning and just used this instead. I had it sitting on the bathroom counter and I reapplied a little a couple times a day when I would think of it. After a couple weeks I noticed that some of the fine lines around my eyes were practically gone. The deeper lines between my nose and mouth didn&#x27;t disappear but they definitely looked softened and less prominent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know that there isn&#x27;t a magic cream that can completely get rid of wrinkles, especially at my age, but this product has actually made more of a difference than any of the pricier creams that I&#x27;ve purchased in the past including the Olay Regenerist Serum. And the nice thing is that this cream is a fraction of the cost of any of the other products I&#x27;ve used. And a little goes a long way because it&#x27;s very thick and rich. The only complaint I have is that the fragrance is a little strong. It isn&#x27;t an unpleasant scent; it smells kind of like an old-fashioned cold cream. I would just prefer less of it or none at all. In fact, if Genes Vitamin E Cream came in an unscented version, I would purchase that. Two thumbs up for a great product. I wish I would have discovered it sooner.</li>
    <li> I use this excellent moisturizer everyday.  I&#x27;m age 82 and find it keeps my skin quite supple and smooth.  Couldn&#x27;t do without it.  I recently made a trip away from home for about a week, so packed the whole 16 oz. in my carry-on bag, only to be told by the TSA (idiots) that it was beyond the 2 oz. allowed, and was made to pitch it.  I was miserable and my skin was very dry for a week while on my trip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was glad to return home  to be able to use this excellent moisturizer--really makes a difference in how my skin feels.  Perhaps it would be  nice to have it also packaged in 2-oz containers for carrying in luggage or purse while on a trip (and to satisfy the TSA&#x27;s requirements of no more than 2 oz.).  I love the  package in 16 oz. jars, as it lasts a long time and is always handy and easy to use, not the least bit greasy, just a great everyday and night-time moisturizing cream.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Given as a gift the results are so amazing I had to get more! My skin is the softest it&#x27;s ever been. You don&#x27;t need a lot, a little goes a long way !</li>
    <li> I bought this and Sweet Bee Magic to compare because I am always looking for good skin products to try and decided on these two for the amount of positive reviews.  I have been having problems with combination skin and acne and at my age!! :(  Where my skin had always been flawless, I was now having scars from acne healing and wanted something to heal my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The jar is HUGE! I guess I didn&#x27;t look at the size when I bought it but when I opened the package and saw how much the jar contains- I was pleased with the volume for the price.  (16 oz)  Sweet Bee Magic is only 2 oz and I paid nearly the same amount of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the first night, I decided to wash my face my face with a cream cleanser and put on SBM- The consistency of the formula in the jar is pretty solid but melted easy to the touch.  I put on a light coat and went to bed.  The next morning, I felt the film still intact on my skin and I did not notice any improvement. I actually felt it attracted dirt to my face even though I know that is not that case. So no change in appearance but I was less than pleased that my skin didn&#x27;t soak it in which is unusual being that I live in a desert climate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next night, again I cleansed my face and tried the Genes- it felt pretty good and was very lotion like. I don&#x27;t have sensitve skin so i did not have any tingling like other users have felt. I went to bed.  The next morning when I woke up- I was amazed how soft my skin felt and how clear it looked.  It seemed to diminish alot of darker scars and soothe my red acne overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever since then, I have been using it at night, in the day, on my face, neck, decolletage, hands and arms.  My olive skin soaks it right up with no greasy residue or clogging of my pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know I should give SBM more of a chance- but I am going to use this daily and will report back what changes (which I hope will continue) I see within 30 days.  If you have combination skin, olive skin or acne prone skin that is not super sensitive- I suggest you try. I have a feeling this will become a staple in my beauty routine.acne prone skin that is not super sensitive- I suggest you try. I have a feeling this will become a staple in my beauty routine.</li>
    <li> I recommend this product to all women who are having trouble with their skin.&lt;br /&gt;This product exfoliates and moistuirzes, leaving the skin very soft.</li>
    <li> Nice amount and good lotion. I felt a skin change within a week! I would do some major exfoliation and then put this on.</li>
    <li> This lotion is great to soothe dry, cracked skin.  I used it on my hands all winter (dry southwest mountain winter), and my hands have not suffered a single day.  It is also excellent at preventing and repairing wind-burned cheeks after a day on the slopes. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I have only had the product a few days, however I like the way it makes my face feel and it has a nice smell&lt;br /&gt;I use at nights and over the weekend.</li>
    <li> Had been purchasing at SAM&#x27;S.  This works amazingly well for me. Better than the expensive cream moisturizer. I have fairly sensitive facial skin.</li>
    <li> Just ordered the second jar.One for the upstairs and the other for the downstairs since my husband travels the house with it. My husband hates putting anything on his face but I was able to convince him to try this and he loves it.I love it as well!A great product! Awesome lotion that keeps your skin moisturizer!</li>
    <li> This is a very potent lotion which caused my allergies and asthma to act up.  It also felt like it literally just sat on top of my skin so I was very greasy all day.  Wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> This is the best cream around. I love love love it. Constantly buy it and can&#x27;t tell enough people about this product.</li>
    <li> Hands down best lotion ever. I&#x27;m 24 and my nurse friend recommended it. Worth every penny and more. So silky after using it. It&#x27;s the miracle cream.</li>
    <li> Great basic cream for softening dry areas.</li>
    <li> This is THE best healing cream I have found.  I know some reviews state there are some &amp;#34;harmful&amp;#34; ingredients included, but I don&#x27;t care.  I had a severe injury requiring a cranioplasty and this cream has worked wonders on the scar.  It has worked better than liquid vitamin E which btw if you don&#x27;t know is cut half with absorbic acid which is a very bad skin irritant, which is to help with shelf life.  It has worked better than &amp;#34;Frankenscar&amp;#34; as well, and I will continue using this and recommend others to as well.  Best scar healing cream period.</li>
    <li> I like this cream, it absorbs fast and leaves skin soft and smooth.  I use it a lot , good size container.  Smells really good without too much &amp;#34;perfume&amp;#34;  just right.</li>
    <li> very good moisturizing cream. I can tell a difference in my skin and will continue to purchase. It is a great creme.</li>
    <li> I am so shocked!  I took before and after pictures of my skin before using Genes and was amazed now looking at my after picture.  It hasn&#x27;t been a quick fix but it does work. I have been using Genes for three months now and believe me it is a excellent product.  The lines are less noticeable, rough skin is gone and I do look younger.  The product is thick and luscious, and last a long time.  The tub is huge.  This is the last skin crème you will stick with. I know it&#x27;s my brand forever!</li>
    <li> This jar contains 16oz of the moisturizing creme. I have one at home and one at office. I used them 2-3 time per day. I felt my skin is getting smooth and comfortable.</li>
    <li> Used while pregnant and no stretch marks at all!</li>
    <li> works great on my new tattoo</li>
    <li> smells good, goes in quickly.</li>
    <li> I do not have sensitive skin and have never had a problem with any other product I have used. This cream causes my skin to break out in a rash and have a burning sensation as well. Horrible skin rashes from it. BEWARE!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok but no the best</li>
    <li> I am a nearly 28 year old fair skinned female, with years of going against nature (tanning/burning) at least in my tween and teen years.  For all of my twenties so far, and a few years before I haven&#x27;t sunbathed, but have not used sunscreen regularly.  I will tell you what I like about this product first in case you would like to skip the rest of the review, and then I will give details on what I have used that didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product:  My skin is very very dry this winter, and I attribute it much to pregnancy because I have never had such dry hands in my life.  Nothing has really helped make them feel just normal.  I would say for my hands, this product probably helps about 80-90% if applied once or twice a day, but I have not been using it religiously for that.  I actually started using this on just cleansed, warm, and damp skin on my face and neck and that is where a huge difference has been seen.  Due to pregnancy or winter or aging (I cry a little inside), my face without this seems as another put it - miserable.  Even with exfoliating, I find that foundations look splotchy and patchy after a few hours.  There are mini lines that show up more evidently with expressions and let me just tell you, dry skin simply makes you look older.  And I haven&#x27;t had that issue til this winter.  But anyhow, when I exfoliate, cleans and apply this to my damp face afterward, it seems to plump up my skin, make it look more seamless (the pores stop shouting at me), and the lines are seriously reduced.  You can&#x27;t see the lines in pictures without zooming in probably ( my sister might think I&#x27;m crazy for talking about lines), but when its your own face, you notice when your skin starts to act like memory foam and faint lines appear.  I also should mention for moisture, I use this product with Olay night cream for sensitive skin that I got cheap at Ollies (always looking for a deal) and between the two of these, one of them must be helping the pregnancy/age/sun spot that has appeared on my face.  I was horrified when it appeared I think during pregnancy, but with consistent use of this and Olay its hardly noticeable.  I&#x27;ll try to remember to update if it totally goes away or if it does once I have our daughter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I have used that did not work:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Dermatologist prescribed retinol - tore up my face.  I wish it could work since its considered a near miracle anti-aging product, but now that I have genes and am on the hunt for a full regimen that helps, I&#x27;m not worried about relying on retinol.  Also, the retinol seemed to make my skin worse int terms of pores/lines/redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Hydroquinone-  I wanted to brighten and even out my skin tone so I found this Fade cream product (white jar blue writing, I think its just called Fade Cream maybe Palmers?).  It seemed to help somewhat but you have to be very diligent about sun screen.  I am kinda worried that between that and the retinol, maybe that is why the hyper pigmentation appeared in the first place.  So I am now on the lookout for a product that is great for evening out skin tone and texture, but without the huge risk of making the problem even worse.  After all before using retinol and hydroquinone, I had absolutely NO hyper pigmentation spots -  just uneven skin tone.  This is what led to looking for gentler(!), more natural supports for my skin rather than aggressively trying to control it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apple Cider Vinegar-  Sigh.  I did try this, and it did make my skin softer per the many Pins on Pinterest with instructions on how to dilute it with water and applying it to your face as a toner. Basically it needs to be really diluted, and applied with a cotton ball as a toner.  It didn&#x27;t do any miracles for my skin - it make the texture softer, but I was more red (I&#x27;m prone to redness), and my skin seemed like it was being stripped of its moisture.  Instead on Amazon there is sold a product called Thayer&#x27;s Rosewater or something like that.  I believe ithas aloe vera in that.  I would like to try that for a toner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not going to list ever estee lauder product I have tried as well as other brands, because I never used them enough to give a fair review.  I&#x27;ll just say I really like this product as a moisturizer and anti-aging product.  If anyone has recommendations for a day cream with SPF (the only thing this seems to miss, since it is so moisturizing), cleanser, exfoliant, any of those things that are effective but gentle - let me know in the comments.  I would greatly appreciate it.  I hope this review was helpful, I will probably update over time if and as my skincare regimen changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; [...].try that for a toner.

    <li> Loved this product and the way it made my skin feel. It just soaked into my skin and I felt soft all day.</li>
    <li> Update: yep third ingredient is organic mineral oil! I&#x27;m returning to Sam&#x27;s club. No longer a fan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original review: I use this rich cream on my natural hair and my skin.  It has good ingredients and stabilizers that may put off extremist. The cream is emollient with a subtle fragrance. I add aloe in summer for a lighter lotion emulsion. Great in winter as is. To me it even has a plumping affect on fine lines. Love recapturing the dewiness of youth. Love how soft this leaves my afro. I now purchase at Sam&#x27;s for a better value.</li>
    <li> Love this cream make my skin feel so soft</li>
    <li> Smooth, creamy texture. My skin absorbs quickly. It is very soothing. I bought one for a neice who has EB as I have been told it diminishes scarring.</li>
    <li> This creme is so effective on dry skin, my mom&#x27;s feet would always get dry and she would pick at the skin by habbit which causes bleeding and such, but after using this creme for two weeks her feet never gets dry and she never get the chance to pick at them again, lol</li>
    <li> For years, I have been using  Genes Vitamin E Crème Swiss Collagen Complex. Then the store that usually sold it was out the several times I tried to buy it.  So my daughter Terri who swears by Amazon, told me to try Amazon.  Of course Amazon was selling it and even less than the previous store! I use Vitamin E Crème at night, summer or  winter, on my legs &amp; arms.  Now since I had a knee replacement, I use it on my knee scar.  Plus that, since I bought two of the Genes&#x27;s Vitamin E Cremes, I have an extra one waiting to be used!</li>
    <li> This is my all time favorite creme! I use it on my whole body! It makes my skin and feet so soft during the summer when I wear a lot of shorts and tank tops. I usually only put it on at night as it is kind of a greasy feeling until it fully absorbes. I dont mind that because it is worth it! I only apply it to my face if my skin is feeling extra dry. I was afraid it might cause breakouts. Everyone comments on how healthy my skin looks its a must have!</li>
    <li> Feels great on face.  Not harsh. Lasts long time. Use on face only.</li>
    <li> This is a rich cream that I leave in my bedside table to put on my feet and hands before retiring. In the morning, my feet and hands are soft and rejuvenated.</li>
    <li> I bought this while researching organic and more skin friendly products for my skin. Ive been using this for over a month now and my skin is noticeably softer and it stays moister now. The water where I live is very hard and the fall/winter used to dry out my skin badly. Happy to report that this is no longer the case. It smells great and if you don&#x27;t have dry skin you can mix it with your regular lotion/cream (my husband does this). You only need to use a small amount to get the job done, It rubs in very nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling oily. I&#x27;ll be buying this again when I finally run out.</li>
    <li> Have been buying and using Genes Vitamin E Creme for years.  My skin is very sensitive to a lot a skin products, but I have never had a problem with this creme.</li>
    <li> best product. very moisturizing</li>
    <li> I like this creme much better than I expected. It&#x27;s smooth and rich and has a mild scent and absorbs nicely. The jar is large and is lasting a long time. A good buy, and I&#x27;m picky about my lotion! I use on legs/body.</li>
    <li> Wonderful moisturizing cream. This was a &amp;#34;refill&amp;#34; order.</li>
    <li> I use this more on neck and hands I love this</li>
    <li> I would have loved to be able to use this product enough to right a thorough review, but I could not handle the smell of this product! It has a very distinct smell, not so different than what one would smell in their grandmother&#x27;s 90&#x27;s cosmetic products.</li>
    <li> This is the best cream and it&#x27;s such a good price</li>
    <li> This is a great, thick cream and I&#x27;m happy with it - with the exception of the fragrance. It has a very strong, unpleasant smelling fragrance. I&#x27;d recommend smelling this in the store before you buy to make sure you like it!</li>
    <li> Pea size is needed for the face..... The change in color tone is clearly visible after 15 days of use!!! My husband&#x27;s &amp; mine, skin glows. The face skin has one tone overall now....... Moisturises the skin very well!!! Completely happy!!! The product is huge, will last for six months for sure (if used only on face)</li>
    <li> Genes Vit E Creme is as good as any top of the line brands, if not better for your skin, for a fraction of the cost! I appreciate the size of this jar, it&#x27;s large enabling me to use it everywhere my skin needs it - this is a Wonderful product!</li>
    <li> This is a very, very good creme. I have been using it for over 20 years. I highly recommend this creme.</li>
    <li> THEE best moisturizer on the planet! I don&#x27;t think this company is aware of the miracle in this jar. I have been using his moisturizer for over 10 years. Not kidding. There were times when I ran out and had to use other brands and my skin was not having it. I always felt like I wasn&#x27;t quite moisturized or had to use more when I used other products. Sam&#x27;s Club was the only place I could find this and I usually stock up like a mad woman. The only thing that didn&#x27;t sit well with me was the price. It cost under $8 at Sam&#x27;s Club but I understand that a profit needs to be made. Delivery was prompt and the product was intact.</li>
    <li> Good for the entire body; face, arms, legs and feet. It also gives one a a nice glow.  Regrettably if I speak too well of this product it won&#x27;t be available the next time I go to order it.  Lol.</li>
    <li> Beware, what used to be my favorite cream, has changed their formula!!!  When I first saw this cream, petroleum was listed as an ingredient 2nd from the bottom. I don&#x27;t like petroleum products on my skin but because there seemed to be so little I tried the cream and LOVED it.  Glanced at the ingredients on a new container and &amp;#34;organic min. oil&amp;#34; is listed as the 3RD ingredient!!!  Who do they think they are fooling.  There is nothing organic about mineral oil! Furthermore when I checked the web site their ingredient list has NO petro chemicals listed at all and when I tried to email from their contact form the link is broken.  Guess they don&#x27;t want to hear from concerned customers.  Will not be buying this product anymore.</li>
    <li> Great product for a great price.</li>
    <li> no longer use JASON, they cut corners now with poor ingredients and alcohols. this is the best!</li>
    <li> This is the 20th container of this creme that I have purchased. No words can explain what it does for your skin. Buy it and find out for yourself!</li>
    <li> This is very thick to put on, but my skin feels really supple when I wake up. The only con, which isn&#x27;t necessarily a con, is that it smells like lotion like maybe lubriderm or something similar.  If that doesn&#x27;t bother you, then you should definitely get this item.</li>
    <li> Excellent cream, my boyfriend is a dermatologist, he swears by this cream, I have used it and I see the results</li>
    <li> Nice and creamy. Works well on my excessively dry skin. Only thing, the smell is very strong. It can be overwhelming.</li>
    <li> This is thicker than most night cremes.  I like it, but don&#x27;t seen any wonders in it.  Price is reasonable.</li>
    <li> Thickkkkkk. Makes it hard to rub in but smells good and will moisturize.</li>
    <li> We use this cream a lot to help with dryness and scarring.</li>
    <li> LOVE THE CREAM AND I CAN&#x27;T FIND IT ANYWHERE ELSE</li>
    <li> Love this product!  After being burned, i used this product and am pleasantly surprised by the lack of scars after 4 months of healing.</li>
    <li> I love this cream!  I bought it at Sams.  I can&#x27;t believe some of the stuff people are saying about this cream, like the bad ingredients, and the smell.  The smell isn&#x27;t that bad, and the ingredients, has anyone looked at the ingredients in their deodorants?  Don&#x27;t let other people&#x27;s bad reviews turn you off.  Try it for yourself.  What didn&#x27;t work for them might be perfect for you, like it was for me.</li>
    <li> Almost as good as Nutra-e!!  A little stickier but still GREAT results!!!  You won&#x27;t be sorry you purchased this one ...</li>
    <li> I workout and when my weight fluctuates suddenly, I get stretch marks. Well I have stretch marks on both of my deltoids(shoulder/breast area) and was looking for something to help them fade. They used to be really ugly but after 6 months of using this right after I shower, the stretchmarks have faded drastically to the point where it is not even visible from a couple of feet away. They are still there, but I have a feeling that they will be almost completely gone by the time I run out of the cream&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My the way, the bottle is still 3/4 full. Practially all still there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this for your stretchmarks and use it constantly.</li>
    <li> This is a HUGE container!! It will last a long time, I bought mine beginning of Nov and have barely made a dent in it. May I add I apply it morning and night to my face and chest. And the results are amazing. I recommend this with Retinol, plus St Ives Collagen and elastin moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I am an african american young man and this product works wonders for my skin. A small amount goes a very long way. It leaves my skin feeling very moisturized and rich. Typical lotion simply doesn&#x27;t work its way into my skin like this does. Its a little more pricey than your typical jergens, but at the end of the day, you get what you pay for. This moisturizer has a very rich scent to it. It is not overpowering at all and certainly doesn&#x27;t smell \\&quot;too feminine\\&quot;. I dont use any other type of lotion or moisturizer on my skin and I often receive complements on how rich my skin looks. My grandfather introduced me to this product about 3 years ago and I&#x27;ve been hooked ever since. I plan on using this product for the rest of my life! Dont buy into any of the negative reviews. I have recommended this product to all of my friends and they have nothing but great things to say about it.</li>
    <li> Nice and creamy.  Absorbed well and leaves my skin feeling pampered.  Genes Swiss Collagen Complex is an excellent buy.</li>
    <li> I have spent lots of money over the years, and bought many product to use on my extra dry feet! Nothing has ever worked until I came across this moisturizing creme. It has worked a miracle on my feet for sure.</li>
    <li> The genes cream works really well on the most stubborn dry skin. I find it particularly helpful on my hands, elbows, and feet. Those areas are always dry and feel flaky when I touch them. Using the vitamin E cream once a day has revitalized those portions of my body. It&#x27;s not too thick or heavy like a lot of other creams which is also helpful. It soaks into the skin instead of rubbing off of my clothes or work area. The only downfall is it irritates my face. I gave it a try but it&#x27;s not the same on my face as the rest of my body. I have to use retinol cream for that- [[ASIN:B009WK0M6G Retinol Cream (Vitamin A) - 2 oz. + FREE St. Ives Renewing Collagen Elastin Advanced Body Moisturizer Gift Set]]. The retinol cream moisturizes but firms and reduces wrinkles which is only really a problem on my face, no need to use it on the rest of my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both creams don&#x27;t take too much to spread out and last for quite a while as a result. It&#x27;s good to have healthier skin. It&#x27;s saved me a lot of pain and hassle!</li>
    <li> This is a terrific product! I have very fragile and dry skin on my arms. This product has left my skin feeling refreshed and soft. This is a very soothing product and highly recommend this for dry aging skin.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product, only 8.00 at Sams</li>
    <li> Love this Vitamin E Creme!! I make my own lotions and have tried several and this one here has me as a loyal customer!! Good price too!</li>
    <li> I live in Arizona and use this product on a daily basis. It moisturizing my skin without it feeling greasy.</li>
