      <li>good stuff arrived on time</li>
      <li>Good moleskin.  </li>
      <li>Good value for the bucks.e</li>
      <li>This is what a feature that I LOVED about it.</li>
      <li>I was wearing good support shoes, wool hiking socks, and liners, and I STILL got blisters!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>a great many uses from covering blisters to using on bow grips to absorb sweat.</li>
      <li>I like the make your own size option compared to the pads.</li>
      <li>Kind of flimsy.</li>
      <li>However, in this application (fairly form fitting cleats)</li>
      <li>Always good to have some of this handy for more than skin uses.</li>
      <li>product came quickly, i.e., before the promised date and was a great value.</li>
      <li>When I was ready to take it off, all I had to do was soak my feet (ahhhhh!) or take a shower (delicious after hot &amp; sweaty hiking!)</li>
      <li>nice easy to use moleskin, nothing fancy</li>
      <li>Works ok for plantar fasciitis.</li>
      <li>Better than buying the precut.</li>
      <li>I have used these over the years, many times purchasing as peel offs with two inch square dimensions.</li>
      <li>I bought this for my wife, she uses pieces on her foot when she runs and says it works great to keep her shoes from rubbing too much.</li>
      <li>(see http://www.amazon.com/Why-You-Really-Hurt-Starts/dp/0942664027) that need to be replaced regularly, and this product is perfect for my needs.</li>
      <li>This was the saving grace of my rim-to-rim hike of the Grand Canyon.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I got blisters.</li>
      <li>This tape works excellently - every bit as well as what you purchase at the drug store - and you pay about the same for 15 feet of it as you do for about 8 inches at the drugstore.  </li>
      <li>While it&#x27;s not awful, I had done close to 7-8 miles of intensive hiking when it rolled up in my sock.  </li>
      <li>My opinion is not that many fold know about moleskin.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m sure this will be plenty.  </li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t give the product any more than 3 star.&lt;br /&gt;Co</li>
      <li>I didnt get a blister and the fabric held up, but when I took it off, it peeled a top layer of skin off.</li>
      <li>but I will not be ordering more.</li>
      <li>Very useful !</li>
      <li>This moleskin-on-a-roll is great value, easy to cut to size, and it actually sticks (as well as or better than the Dr. Scholl&#x27;s brand, which costs many times more)!</li>
      <li>shoes.&lt;br /&gt;Price was right Great product and quick deliverry</li>
      <li>I like being able to purchase a large roll at a good price.</li>
      <li>recommend the product it is a large quantity for a good price and is quality too.</li>
      <li>I am happy it was not expensive as it isn&#x27;t worth what even what I paid for it.</li>
      <li>At our shoe accessory company we enclose a square of moleskin with all of our orders for our customers to make their shoe clips more comfortable.</li>
      <li>She plays on a top tier competitive soccer team and at times the combination of practices and games take a toll on her feet, even with cleats that seem to fit well.  </li>
      <li>The tape form, is a good idea, and if you can store them properly, a good long term purchase for the price.  </li>
      <li>As other have stated, the adhesive on this product isn&#x27;t the greatest.  </li>
      <li>Removes easily after use.</li>
      <li>and it made the break in period easy as pie.  </li>
      <li>I gave The seller a 5 star because he was accomodating and easy to deal with</li>
      <li>Strong adhesive.  </li>
      <li>If anything I would say the adhesive is TOO strong.</li>
      <li>The moleskin works great on both; I love that I can just cut what I need, so I don&#x27;t need a huge bandaid around my big toes, or showing on my heels.</li>
      <li>This item works fine.</li>
      <li>Super value!</li>
      <li>Bought this Moleskin at a great savings over the moleskin I found at local pharmacy&#x27;s, Target and Walmart.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had no trouble with adherence or removal, and the tape provides good protection against blisters.</li>
      <li>So to protect and prevent more of the same, I purchased this product as it seemed to have a good quantity/price ratio.</li>
      <li>Slap some moleskin on hotspots, and you&#x27;re good to go for several more miles.  </li>
      <li>That is true but a product called \\&quot;Goo Gone\\&quot; will remove it easily.</li>
      <li>I use a lot to wrap my toes  before running and this is very economical and does the trick.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m delighted that Amazon took this back and credited my account.</li>
      <li>It sticks fine at first but then as it warms with walking the adhesive softens and the whole moleskin pad starts to migrate across your foot leaving a snail trail of sticky adhesive which does a much better job of sticking to your sock than the moleskin it was originally on.</li>
      <li>but it was adequate.  </li>
      <li>My feet tend to scrunch these up really quickly in sneakers.</li>
      <li>It stays on after the shower and dries quickly just by standing on a towel for a bit.  </li>
      <li>It is a strong adhesive tape better than a band aid, more secure with an extra soft pad.</li>
      <li>Keeping this in my backpack and first aid kit!</li>
      <li>This works good, doesn&#x27;t come loose if feet get sweaty.  </li>
      <li>Moleskin is very comfortable in contact with skin and is super strong so it holds loose pieces in place.</li>
      <li>She eventually developed some very significant blistering.  </li>
      <li>I taped up 4 spots on each foot where I normally get blisters on week+ hikes, and only got one blister during the 8 day hike, instead of the normal eight bisters I normally get, so I was very happy with that!</li>
      <li>JUST COME IN RIGHT TIME FOR ME</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Apparently,I didn&#x27;t know how xheavy would be when used with moleskin.Not worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> This item works fine. It arrived on time as promised and it works as advertised.</li>
    <li> Excellent value, however it is VERY hard (and sometimes painful) to take off. I used this as a heel bone callus protector and it worked great. I didnt get a blister and the fabric held up, but when I took it off, it peeled a top layer of skin off. I used it on another trip to prevent blisters on my pinky and I had no issues. If you have soft or previously blistered skin, the adhesive can pull the top layer of skin off.</li>
    <li> Do not recommend this product on feet. My wife has used this about a month. She now uses Goof Off to removed the excess glue after each use...Definitely a pain and not worth saving a buck. Compare this with the Dr Scholls&#x27;s Moleskin Plus which I purchased at the same time. Same protection, but with easy removal and clean up. Only Dr Scholls for us.</li>
    <li> This is an affordable moleskin and in general works ok, but does not have the staying power that I would prefer and may come loose under certain circumstance.</li>
    <li> At our shoe accessory company we enclose a square of moleskin with all of our orders for our customers to make their shoe clips more comfortable. We have been very happy with this vendor and their product.</li>
    <li> Reading the other reviews about this item makes me wonder if the vendor sent me the incorrect product.  This Moleskin is advertised as \\&quot;extra heavy\\&quot; which it is not.  In fact, it is extra light.  I have two other brands of Moleskin, Premier and Dr. Scholl&#x27;s.  Both are heavier than this product, which is the thinnest Moleskin I have ever used.  In order to protect an ankle bone that is sensitive to the pressure of a boot, I have to use at least two layers of this product. Another reviewer mentioned that the adhesive is difficult to remove. That is true but a product called \\&quot;Goo Gone\\&quot; will remove it easily. This product is reasonably priced, which helps to prove the old saying \\&quot;You get what you pay for.\\&quot;  I intend to keep it but I will not be ordering more.</li>
    <li> Joke. Xtra heavy duty ?  Its about as thick as the cardboard of a cereal box. Very misleading.</li>
    <li> I ordered the 2 x 5 and wow that is a lot of moleskin.  It is very thick and I am pleased with the product I just didn&#x27;t realize how much I was in for when I ordered it.  So it is a very good deal and you can add them to other kits.  I tend to make first aid kits for friends and family so I&#x27;m sure this will be plenty.  I don&#x27;t imagine ever having to buy anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend the product it is a large quantity for a good price and is quality too.</li>
    <li> My feet tend to scrunch these up really quickly in sneakers. I wish it had stronger adhesive. Maybe I&#x27;m using it wrong?</li>
    <li> Sticks well and great value!</li>
    <li> This tape works excellently - every bit as well as what you purchase at the drug store - and you pay about the same for 15 feet of it as you do for about 8 inches at the drugstore.  I&#x27;ve had no trouble with adherence or removal, and the tape provides good protection against blisters.</li>
    <li> I just hiked a 80 mile section of the AT last week. Bought this Moleskin at a great savings over the moleskin I found at local pharmacy&#x27;s, Target and Walmart.  I was a little concerned after reading some reviews where some said it didn&#x27;t stick well. Others said it did stick well.  I found an article that was posted in a backpacking magazine about preventing blisters, and they suggested to use Compound Tincture Benzoin (CTB) before placing moleskin or tape to make it stick much longer (regular Benzoin won&#x27;t work, it has to be the Compound). I bought a 1oz botton of CTB at my local REI for $10 (Amazon also sells it but I didn&#x27;t have enough time to get it delivered before my trip). The CTB and this brand of Moleskin combo worked great !!  This moleskin lasted for 2 and 3 days on my feet before I had to replace it.  I taped up 4 spots on each foot where I normally get blisters on week+ hikes, and only got one blister during the 8 day hike, instead of the normal eight bisters I normally get, so I was very happy with that! Definitely will buy this brand again.  Pam</li>
    <li> Very slightly thinner than Dr. Scholls, but the amount offered and cost makes it well worth it.  I use a lot to wrap my toes  before running and this is very economical and does the trick.</li>
    <li> It leaves a sticky residue that is hard to wash off, it got all over my shoes and roller skates.</li>
    <li> Took this with me to Philmont, New Mexico with a group of Boy Scouts.  Helped save some feet on the trek!</li>
    <li> Use it to line my boots so it doesn&#x27;t damage tights/stockings</li>
    <li> My foot dr recommended me for my callouses. It works great.</li>
    <li> works like it did when I used it in the Army</li>
    <li> I ordered the moleskin because I needed some protection in a pair of boots I purchased. The product was delivered in very prompt manner and was exactly what I expected. I would certainly do business with this company again.</li>
    <li> I like to do long day-hikes on the Appalachian trail, so my feet can get pretty beaten up by the end. Slap some moleskin on hotspots, and you&#x27;re good to go for several more miles.  You can&#x27;t beat the price for what you get. I&#x27;ve bought strips of moleskin in a store, paid the same price, but only had enough for 2 hikes. I don&#x27;t think I will run out in years.</li>
    <li> Hopefully I never need it!  But have it...</li>
    <li> Wonderful product to modify arch supports in shoes. Durable and made with quality. For those of us with bad arches this product is very helpful</li>
    <li> One whole hell of a lot of moleskin for 10 bucks. It&#x27;s like a lifetime supply. I wrapped up my toes for a 200 mile bike ride and it worked great.</li>
    <li> Recently my doctor prescribed a knee brace for me and it was causing blisters on my skin in one area.  I lined the area with the moleskin and it worked like a charm --- no more blisters!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product came quickly, i.e., before the promised date and was a great value.</li>
    <li> I used this product while breaking in a new set of riding boots. However, I&#x27;ve continued to use it with said boots as well as a set of very expensive Tory Burch flats that just love to eat the hell out of my heels. I&#x27;ve never had a problem with poor adhesive. If anything I would say the adhesive is TOO strong. My only complaint would be that sometimes I have to shower with them still on in order to peel them off without hurting my delicate ankle skin.</li>
    <li> I got this because I kept getting giant blisters on the ball of my feet from playing ball. I am now using a combination of spenco insoles, thorlo basketball socks to wick moisture away and moleskin. I cut a square to put on the ball of my feet.     the good part is i haven&#x27;t gotten any blisters since     the bad part is the moleskin comes off my foot and ends up on the top of my foot so i take my socks off in  between every game and put a new one on. not sure if it&#x27;s really helping at this point</li>
    <li> Good amount of moleskin for price.</li>
    <li> Best product for the price anywhere!!! Buy over n over!!</li>
    <li> Good moleskin.  A little thinner than I&#x27;d hoped for - but it&#x27;s still good.  Strong adhesive.  Does the job well.  Wish I could find a roll that is truly padded.  This claims extra Heavy...I think they mean extra strong...which it is strong.  Just not extra padded at all.  This minor description flaw is all that holds me from 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I use moleskin everyday in my job and always order from assorted sellers on Amazon. I thought I would try this \\&quot;extra heavy\\&quot; moleskin and what a disappointment! Not only is it not extra heavy but extra thin! It&#x27;s not as comfy as \\&quot;normal\\&quot; moleskin and doesn&#x27;t stay put to bottom of foot - at the end of the day when I take off my shoes, it&#x27;s bunched up and floating around in my shoe. This is the cheapest moleskin I&#x27;ve ever seen - doesn&#x27;t do anything at all. I&#x27;ll stick to Dr. Scholl&#x27;s and some other company.</li>
    <li> Thick enough to prevent blisters but thin enough not to bunch up or cause creases.  Adheres to skin well.  Removes easily after use.</li>
    <li> This was purchased to for my daughter.  She plays on a top tier competitive soccer team and at times the combination of practices and games take a toll on her feet, even with cleats that seem to fit well.  She eventually developed some very significant blistering.  So to protect and prevent more of the same, I purchased this product as it seemed to have a good quantity/price ratio. Moleskin can be quite expensive with the amount we go through if purchased at the corner drug store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the product, I would agree with some of the other reviewers in that it is a bit thin.  However, in this application (fairly form fitting cleats) this might actually be an advantage as something too thick might not be as comfortable.  The tape seems to stay securely where placed and hasn&#x27;t been a big problem to remove.  The ultimate measure however for us is that my daughter&#x27;s feet are in much better shape than ever before.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not as thick as I needed and wanted.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s mole skin. What else can be said. It works as expected.</li>
    <li> First of all I took the time to measure and it was 15&#x27;1&amp;quot;. Great value and thickness was perfect.</li>
    <li> The adhesive is non existent and useless, so weak that the pad will not stick to itself!  Don&#x27;t bother you will just end up throwing it away.</li>
    <li> Holy moly....&lt;br /&gt;When some of the reviews said this was thin, I thought it wouldn&#x27;t be THAT thin..&lt;br /&gt;I have bought a name brand that is thick and have bought  a rite aid brand that I thought was &amp;#34;thin&amp;#34;. But this stuff is way thin... It is the thickness of one of those foamy  band aids, if I had read a review that told me the thickness was compared to that, I wouldn&#x27;t of even tried it !!&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t normally return things, usually a hassle , I&#x27;ll just double it up and hope it will help my painful foot !!&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money... FOR REAL ..</li>
    <li> As other have stated, the adhesive on this product isn&#x27;t the greatest.  While it&#x27;s not awful, I had done close to 7-8 miles of intensive hiking when it rolled up in my sock.  However, I imagine if you are using this for less strenuous activities, you wouldn&#x27;t have a problem.  I will try buying the tincture that has been suggested to use in addition to this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, the length and price is unbeatable and will probably re-buy if I ever run out!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t stick that great</li>
    <li> Walk for exercise and sometimes have difficult time finding the perfect walking shoes, thus get blisters.  Have spent a small fortune on those packages of moleskin pads to cut up for various parts of both feet to avoid those nasty blisters.  This works good, doesn&#x27;t come loose if feet get sweaty.  Like it.</li>
    <li> Always good to have some of this handy for more than skin uses.</li>
    <li> Not as thick as I had hoped for.</li>
    <li> The moleskin is thick enough to help ease the discomfort from the Morton&#x27;s neuroma that my wife has, and the long tape is a convenient and effective way to let us cut and shape the pads that she needs.  I think that this is also a very cost-effective way to get moleskin pads if you have a lot of need for them.</li>
    <li> Great product does the job. My opinion is not that many fold know about moleskin. It is a strong adhesive tape better than a band aid, more secure with an extra soft pad. This stuff works to combat blisters rubbing etc esp new shoes.&lt;br /&gt;Price was right Great product and quick deliverry Thanx</li>
    <li> helped a lot with blistered feet!</li>
    <li> I agree with reviewer, Glen -THIS IS NOT HEAVY DUTY MOLESKIN!!! IT IS ABOUT TWICE AS THICK AS A SHEET OF PAPER.  I am surprised that Amazon even allows this seller on Amazon - it is such a blatant case of FALSE ADVERTISING.  I will definitely not buy it again.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Amazing! Did a 30 mile AT hike and thank god a friend brought this stuff. I really needed it for all the burners and blisters i had.</li>
    <li> Send a little of this to my Marine recruit in each letter. Goes undetected by his drill instructor and helps with the blisters.</li>
    <li> good value, good quality</li>
    <li> I have used this product a couple of times now.  The problem is the adhesive is awlful to remove!!  I had to go and purchase adhesive remover pads to get the stickness off my feet.  There does not seem to be a problem with it sticking, just can&#x27;t get the glue off!!!  WON&#x27;T buy this brand again!!</li>
    <li> This moleskin-on-a-roll is great value, easy to cut to size, and it actually sticks (as well as or better than the Dr. Scholl&#x27;s brand, which costs many times more)! Of course, not everyone needs this much moleskin ... but I make pads for my shoes to treat Morton&#x27;s Toe (see http://www.amazon.com/Why-You-Really-Hurt-Starts/dp/0942664027) that need to be replaced regularly, and this product is perfect for my needs.</li>
    <li> nice easy to use moleskin, nothing fancy just a roll of moleskin with a great many uses from covering blisters to using on bow grips to absorb sweat.</li>
    <li> Keeping this in my backpack and first aid kit! A really good protection for breaking in new shoes and long hiking trips</li>
    <li> This is anything but heavy,thinner than what I have used before. I had to try to double it and of course,neither of the pieces stuck. It has almost no adhesive on it. Terrible. I am happy it was not expensive as it isn&#x27;t worth what even what I paid for it.</li>
    <li> Was not extra heavy. Kind of flimsy. Not as good as dr. Scholl&#x27;s.  Works ok for plantar fasciitis. Preferred dr. Scholl&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Being advertised as extra heavy moleskin, it surely didn&#x27;t seem extra heavy. It was about half the thickness of the moleskin I bought at Walmart. You get a lot for the price, and it works if you only need a lightweight moleskin. But if you are looking for thick moleskin, I would chose something different.</li>
    <li> This was the saving grace of my rim-to-rim hike of the Grand Canyon.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I got blisters. I was wearing good support shoes, wool hiking socks, and liners, and I STILL got blisters!&lt;br /&gt;I kept my feet dry, so it stuck well. Some other reviewers complained that it came off when it got wet. This is what a feature that I LOVED about it. When I was ready to take it off, all I had to do was soak my feet (ahhhhh!) or take a shower (delicious after hot &amp; sweaty hiking!) and it would peel off with no icky, sticky residue.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be keeping this in my hiking kit!</li>
    <li> Beware, &amp;#34;extra heavy&amp;#34; is a very misleading description of this product.  If you&#x27;re looking for something &amp;#34;thick&amp;#34;, then this product is not for your.</li>
    <li> This product is not extra heavy also the edges fray. The adhesive does not come off of your skin. This purchase was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Best Moleskin for feet  Thank you</li>
    <li> This really is economical rather than buying small amounts at a time. You just just cut it to the shape and size you need.</li>
    <li> Good stuff.  Better than buying the precut.</li>
    <li> Protects my feet and toes from blistering lengthy walks and especially on long hikes.  Great price and product.</li>
    <li> I have a few pairs of shoes I like, but they chew up my heels and ankle bones.  This roll of Moleskin is thick, sticky, and free of any frills (like pre-cut-to-inevitably-the-wrong-size or whatever).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously, you HAVE to cut it with scissors.  So, if that&#x27;s a problem for you, maybe get one of the fancier versions.</li>
    <li> In all fairness this product was not marketed for hiking / backpacking which is what I purchased it for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are purchasing this for blister care / avoidance for backpacking and hiking this is not your product.  The fabric is just not thick enough and the adhesive is too aggressive to place over tender or blistered skin.  It would work similar to duct tape if you caught a hot spot early.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long and short for hiking / backpacking purchase a padded moleskin.</li>
    <li> Moleskin is very thin, but the problem is the adhesive.  Removing the moleskin leaves a layer of adhesive on the skin.  It will not wash off with soap and a washcloth.  You can loosen it from the skin with nail polish remover, but you end up scraping off the adhesive with your fingernail, and then it sticks to your fingers. Bits left behind begin to cause contact dermatitis. Do not apply this product directly to the skin as you would regular moleskin.</li>
    <li> this is the weight moleskin i used to purchase as dr. scholls and as such is just what i wanted.  i found dr. scholls not very sticky after it sat in the drawer a number of months.  now i am wearing a brace and need the tape consistently, so it will not sit in the drawer.  this tape is at least twice as sticky as dr. scholls, which has presented another problem for me: it actually is so sticky i need to put paper tape on first so that my skin is not pulled off when i remove the tape.  any suggestions?</li>
    <li> Great stuff! In use it in my shoes if there is a rubbing issue on my feet. I just adhere it to the shoe itself. Very useful !</li>
    <li> Good quality moleskin with a good adhesive but it can be difficult to cut if your scissors aren&#x27;t as sharp as they can be.</li>
    <li> Good moleskin, I was disappointed that it was not in any kind of packaging.  It seemed like my order was just pulled off a giant roll and shipped.  This makes me a little nervous since I would most likely be applying this to a blister.</li>
    <li> This moleskin has great adhesion, plus it is difficult to impossible to find unpadded moleskin at retail stores any more. Super value!</li>
    <li> So I use moleskin for those pesky underwires that pop out of bras sometimes and try to stab you. Works very well but the underwire tends to break through that as well.</li>
    <li> I bought as a recommendation for shoes that break the skin of your feet. I had 2 pairs that gave me blisters on my big toe, and a pair of new shoes that tore apart the heel zone on both my feet. I don&#x27;t walk much while on the office, but walking to and from the car, and whatever I needed to walk inside the office was enough for me to be in pain and with bloody feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to wear thick bandaids which worked for the toes, but didn&#x27;t work for the heel as they came off. The moleskin works great on both; I love that I can just cut what I need, so I don&#x27;t need a huge bandaid around my big toes, or showing on my heels. I just cut a little piece, enough to cover the zones that blister and it works wonderfully. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the moleskin coming off, or leaving adhesive on my skin</li>
    <li> Excellent value for the money.  This moleskin stays in place very well and does not leave behind too much residue when you remove it.</li>
    <li> Thicker than the mole skin available in local stores, In a roll you can cut exactly what you need, The price is not the cheapest but reasonable for a quality product.</li>
    <li> No complaints whatsoever.  A much better price performer than the little drug store packages.  Easy to cut, excellent adhesive.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> item as described.  Sent to military personal who used it while in the field</li>
    <li> Bought this to protect my hand from the sharp edges of my cast. Worked like a charm. When it gets dirty, just peel it off and put on more. I used about a half roll during the 6 weeks my arm was in a cast.</li>
    <li> What we needed shipped fast!</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I have problems with both of my feet - I feel like I&#x27;m walking on pebbles (neuroma I believe) and a 3 inch piece of moleskin placed on the front of the bottom of each foot makes walking much easier. The best thing is that it stays put - and I go to the gym every day and then shower.  It stays on after the shower and dries quickly just by standing on a towel for a bit.  It remains on all evening.  I can&#x27;t say enough about the quality of this - it&#x27;s inexpensive and makes my day so much easier on my feet!</li>
    <li> The company was reasonable but the product called Extra Heavy Moleskin was very very thin. It did not meed the description.  It certainly wasn&#x27;t Extra Heavy, I would rate it as the thinest I have seen on the market. Good for some peoples needs but not what the description stated. The company was prompt in answering my complaint and said I could return it but it wasn&#x27;t expensive and it would cost me more to return it than try and use it. I have to use 4 thickness to get the same thickness that another company offered called Extra Heavy. The company said that the manufacturer calls it Extra Heavy so that is what the seller calls it. I gave The seller a 5 star because he was accomodating and easy to deal with but I don&#x27;t give the product any more than 3 star.&lt;br /&gt;Co Co</li>
    <li> Works great but the adhesive used was a pain to remove.  No blisters though and I hiked the desert for four days so the product definitely works, albeit a bit gooey after the fact.</li>
    <li> It works--No latex.  Granddaughter is a runner and she has enjoyed using it to hold the Spenco 2nd sking Gel Squares in place.</li>
    <li> Great moleskin.  A bargain price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s moleskin. A lot of moleskin. Good moleskin. Everything you would ever want or expect from moleskin.</li>
    <li> Great buy.  I purchased for my son in Basic Training.  I don&#x27;t think he used it because he had no problems with his new boots - I purchased for him to prepare - but I believe he shared with friends.</li>
    <li> A must for hikers who get foot blisters. Been using moleskin for years and wouldn&#x27;t trust anything different. Don&#x27;t leave home without this.</li>
    <li> JUST COME IN RIGHT TIME FOR ME AS I NEED IT. IT HERLPS I DO NOT HAVE TO RUN AROUND THE DRUG STORES.</li>
    <li> I use mole skin to cushion the back of my heel when running. I like being able to purchase a large roll at a good price.</li>
    <li> Good value for the bucks.e</li>
    <li> Just what I needed for my first aid kit.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a fix for underwires that have poked through the fabric in my bras. It works great.</li>
    <li> We used moleskin in the Marine Corps, but have not thought about it in the intervening 20 years.  Got a new pair of Doc Marten boots and got mega blisters breaking them in.  Put on the moleskin and it made the break in period easy as pie.  Happy to endorse this product.</li>
    <li> A new application for Moleskin.&lt;br /&gt;Use it to cover the forehead pad of any PCAP mask.&lt;br /&gt;The Moleskin is very comfortable in contact with skin and is super strong so it holds loose pieces in place.</li>
    <li> Worke wonderfully the cure all to wearing any shoe</li>
    <li> Moleskin does what it&#x27;s supposed to.  Much cheaper to buy it by the large role.  Definately a great product for the price!  If your kids wrestle or practice jui jitsu it&#x27;s a must to keep there knees and scabs from bleeding through all the time.</li>
    <li> My husband has a sleep apnea machine and uses these on his nose where the mask sits.  It doesn&#x27;t keep the mask from sealing but keeps it from irritating his skin.</li>
    <li> If you run or hike, you need this for friction control over hotspots to prevent blisters; if you already have blisters, you need this to make your moleskin torus-shapes. I like the make your own size option compared to the pads.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife, she uses pieces on her foot when she runs and says it works great to keep her shoes from rubbing too much. The only issue I had with this brand is that it frays along the edges a lot more than others she has tried.</li>
    <li> Product as described, didn&#x27;t realize it was adhesive,  but turned out to work for what I wanted.  Very good product.</li>
    <li> Received promptly.  Wasn&#x27;t as thick as the last moleskin I had but it was adequate.  That&#x27;s why it only got 4 stars; however, I would order again.</li>
    <li> Thought I was ordering r Sholes brand .....This stuff is junk!!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking it was like the Curad Moleskin I&#x27;d be using for years and IT WAS NOT! The adhesive was weak at the corners such that the &#x27;moleskin&#x27; curled up and got stuck on my socks leading to more problems after a long run. At the end when removing the moleskin it tugs hard enough to remove the softened skin underneath. If you have all but leather tough skin, pay the extra money and go for the brand used in hospitals and by Physical Therapsts. I&#x27;m delighted that Amazon took this back and credited my account.</li>
    <li> As described.  Great product.</li>
    <li> The roll of EXTRA HEAVY moleskin was thinner than the one I purchased at the local store.  I was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> good stuff arrived on time</li>
    <li> Seems like a great price but you get what you pay for. This moleskin is fairly thin. Certainly not \\&quot;Extra Heavy\\&quot;. It is thick enough to prevent a blister but not thick enough to provide any padding. The adhesive leaves much to be desired. It sticks fine at first but then as it warms with walking the adhesive softens and the whole moleskin pad starts to migrate across your foot leaving a snail trail of sticky adhesive which does a much better job of sticking to your sock than the moleskin it was originally on. I&#x27;ve found this to cause hot spots from the increased sock friction. Might be OK for people who only do short walks (&lt; 5 miles). I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for runners/joggers.</li>
    <li> Thanks - Will order again!</li>
    <li> I have used these over the years, many times purchasing as peel offs with two inch square dimensions. The tape form, is a good idea, and if you can store them properly, a good long term purchase for the price.  Thumbs UP!</li>
