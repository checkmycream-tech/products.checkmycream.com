### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I found it on Amazon.com and was so happy!</li>
      <li>Perfect product!</li>
      <li>This is the perfect color for my hair.  </li>
      <li>Sandalwood is perfect for my hair type.</li>
      <li>The product is great &amp; and does what it says it will do...:0)  </li>
      <li>so happy box color can fix my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>also use Ion Color Brilliance from Sally Beauty which is a good product, but when I don&#x27;t have time to get there, I will use the Clairol NI.</li>
      <li>My good friend is in hair school.</li>
      <li>Now my hair is a cool light brown perfect for the summer.</li>
      <li>This new version seems to be equally excellent.  </li>
      <li>It turned my hair into a shiny, healthy, non-brassy or warm, light-brown, hazelnut color.</li>
      <li>- the color booster is very rich and effective.  </li>
      <li>My hair feels better too bleach kills hair.</li>
      <li>They put toner in my hair that looked ok.</li>
      <li>The more I looked at it</li>
      <li>Love this color and always get compliments on it.....</li>
      <li>After you find the color that suits you, you will be pleased with the results...:0)</li>
      <li>This is my favorite shade.  </li>
      <li>My hair always looks shiny and healthy after coloring.</li>
      <li>To spare myself more stress, I choose to to damage control myself.</li>
      <li>/&gt;UPDATE May 8, 2013: I still love this color and haven&#x27;t found anything better, but they have changed the formula again, and now you have to apply the product to damp hair once more.</li>
      <li>I think this new kind is just as good.  </li>
      <li>And the nice thing about semipermanent dye is it doesn&#x27;t fry your hair like the permanent kind with real bleach.</li>
      <li>It does not damage your hair and gives it a great shine and very natural looking color.  </li>
      <li>My hair easily turns brassy, and so I have to be cautious when coloring it.</li>
      <li>But the teacher said we should use a not so strong bleach.</li>
      <li>works fine, color fine, conditioner fine,</li>
      <li>and it worked fine on my honey hued hair.</li>
      <li>I have colored my hair with #10, Sandalwood, for years with fabulous, long-lasting results.  </li>
      <li>I feel really pretty again and received many complements reassuring the coloring success!</li>
      <li>Natural Instincts is the best: it&#x27;s a real bargain, easy to use and completely natural-looking.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not as saturated as a permanent hair color, but that OK with me, as the dye functions more as highlights and not total coverage.</li>
      <li>It is so very pretty on me.  </li>
      <li>though I&#x27;m a light  brunette, I find dark blonde works best for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Used this and it evened it out whole head nicely to a light brown...</li>
      <li>Nice tones and shades not an overall color block.  </li>
      <li>I have used the natural instincts for many years on and off.</li>
      <li>you need full and lasting gray coverage, you would be better off with a permanent color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I used one color wash packet (I would need two boxes to color my entire head) and left it on for 5-6 minutes and it blended the three colors in my hair together nicely and subtley more like a glaze.</li>
      <li>It evened out the color and made most of the brassy yellow go away.</li>
      <li>2 week later packet is okay</li>
      <li>Yes, the product arrived on time and is exactly what I ordered.  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find this color in any store around here for a long time.</li>
      <li>After four weeks, PRIOR to the color wash, my hair definately had an orange tone more so than normal.</li>
      <li>Be sure to apply to clean, DRY hair - the previous formula specified application to clean, DAMP hair.  </li>
      <li>My natural highlights are light golden blonde.</li>
      <li>With the new formula, you apply it to dry hair which is more convenient.</li>
      <li>After using Color Oops, which removed all of the dark color, but left my hair bright orange, I applied protein filler for 20 min.</li>
      <li>could still see a slight color change as my hair got longer, but much, much better and much healthier.  </li>
      <li>I will still use Natural Instincts, but they could do a better job on the color refresher and make it so that it can be applied to dry hair again.</li>
      <li>This dye is semipermanent, which I don&#x27;t know why is not more popular.</li>
      <li>I had her give me lots of chunky high lights.</li>
      <li>Just a note that sticking as close to your natural color as possible is a good idea and also, to repeat two things I read in other reviews and found to be true, note that the instructions are for the color to go onto damp hair (not dry) and that the color refresh packets, for whatever reason, seems to add a lot of warmth (red) to the hair.</li>
      <li>It never gives me any brassiness whatsoever, and the color is very natural looking.</li>
      <li>Thanx to Clairol Natural Instincts!</li>
      <li>So I had orange hair with dark roots and light ends.</li>
      <li>I only left dye on for 10 minutes, but next time will stretch it out more because my greys were not covered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have not noticed any difference in color results between the old formula and the new one.</li>
      <li>My natural color is medium-to-dark brown.</li>
      <li>I have about 10% gray, and while it doesn&#x27;t completely cover it, it does make the gray blend in and look like soft highlights for about 1 to 1 1/2 months.</li>
      <li>ran out and get this cool dark blond.</li>
      <li>I love that I don&#x27;t worry about roots growing out because the fade is slow.  </li>
      <li>I finally got tired of spending so much time and money on dramatic color changes and was very happy to realize that this non-permanent color really makes me hair look healthier, shinier and adds a nice little kick to my natural color, turning mousey into a pretty dark blonde.  </li>
      <li>It was difficult to decide to put anything on my hair, but I am very glad that I got the nerve to do it</li>
      <li>and I streak in dark cool blonde platnum shades at home every six weeks</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using the 10 Dark Cool Blonde, but I think an updated version from the store.</li>
      <li>My complexion is &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; and this is a cool ash dark blonde.  </li>
      <li>My hair is naturally Mousey/Dishwater Blonde</li>
      <li>for the new formula, I actually prefer it to the old one because with the old one you had to wet your hair before applying the color.</li>
      <li>But I decided to try one box worth of colorwash on my long hair (which is naturally dark brown, but is highlighted blonde at the salon 1-3x a year</li>
      <li>I used one box of the Dark Cool Blonde with a cap to streak in and tone down my 3 month old blonde highlights and blend in my roots.</li>
      <li>Last summer my hair had gotten majorly bleached out by working outdoors, and as my medium brown roots grew in I had a strange drastic look.  </li>

<li> the more I hated it.</li>
<li> I left it on for 20 to 25 minutes, otherwise the gray coverage would have been poor.</li>
<li> so not sure I can use it.</li>
<li> /&gt;Great stuff for fixed a bad color job.</li>
<li> Well needless to say it did not come out as planed.</li>
<li> all the bad reviews about the touch up color packet I think I will just throw that out.</li>
<li> I almost didn&#x27;t try it because of all the bad reviews I had read.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t be shocked at the color of the refresher packet - with Sandalwood</li>
<li> Do not use the 2 week booster as suggested as it actually stinks !!</li>
<li> and it was a horrible brown/orange shade.&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My good friend is in hair school. I had her give me lots of chunky high lights. We were trying to get my dark brown hair blond. But the teacher said we should use a not so strong bleach. Well needless to say it did not come out as planed. They put toner in my hair that looked ok. After a week the toner was out and my hair looked yellow brassy with all different shades. The more I looked at it the more I hated it. Some of my hair was still my natural dark brown so it just looked like a mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ran out and get this cool dark blond. It evened out the color and made most of the brassy yellow go away. Will have to wait and see how long it lasts. My hair feels better too bleach kills hair. I was scared to die it again because of extra damage. I have used the natural instincts for many years on and off. I think this new kind is just as good.  Now my hair is a cool light brown perfect for the summer. I am so happy box color can fix my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With all the bad reviews about the touch up color packet I think I will just throw that out. I don&#x27;t want to risk messing my hair up again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great stuff for fixed a bad color job.</li>
    <li> I used the Color Wash from the Dark Blonde box of Natural Instincts bought in Feb of 2012 and it worked fine on my honey hued hair. I almost didn&#x27;t try it because of all the bad reviews I had read. But I decided to try one box worth of colorwash on my long hair (which is naturally dark brown, but is highlighted blonde at the salon 1-3x a year and I streak in dark cool blonde platnum shades at home every six weeks the rest of the time). I used one box of the Dark Cool Blonde with a cap to streak in and tone down my 3 month old blonde highlights and blend in my roots. After four weeks, PRIOR to the color wash, my hair definately had an orange tone more so than normal. The color wash wasn&#x27;t what tinted it orange, it&#x27;s the product.  So I had orange hair with dark roots and light ends. I used one color wash packet (I would need two boxes to color my entire head) and left it on for 5-6 minutes and it blended the three colors in my hair together nicely and subtley more like a glaze.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to find this color in any store around here for a long time. I found it on Amazon.com and was so happy! People can&#x27;t tell I even color my hair when I use this color, as it just covers the gray and is the same color as the rest of my hair. Thank you amazon!</li>
    <li> My story: A disastrous coloring job by a \\&quot;professional\\&quot; hairstylist, turned my light brown highlighted hair into a muddy, oversaturated, and dull mess. To spare myself more stress, I choose to to damage control myself. After using Color Oops, which removed all of the dark color, but left my hair bright orange, I applied protein filler for 20 min. and then used Sandalwood. It turned my hair into a shiny, healthy, non-brassy or warm, light-brown, hazelnut color. My highlights are also still visible. I feel really pretty again and received many complements reassuring the coloring success! Thanx to Clairol Natural Instincts!</li>
    <li> Been using for years. This batch did not cover the gray.</li>
    <li> I have colored my hair with #10, Sandalwood, for years with fabulous, long-lasting results.  This new version seems to be equally excellent.  Be sure to apply to clean, DRY hair - the previous formula specified application to clean, DAMP hair.  Don&#x27;t be shocked at the color of the refresher packet - with Sandalwood it is ORANGE - the color booster is very rich and effective.  Natural Instincts is the best: it&#x27;s a real bargain, easy to use and completely natural-looking.</li>
    <li> I have naturally dark blonde/light brown hair with a lot of red undertones. My hair easily turns brassy, and so I have to be cautious when coloring it. Sandalwood is perfect for my hair type. It never gives me any brassiness whatsoever, and the color is very natural looking. I have about 10% gray, and while it doesn&#x27;t completely cover it, it does make the gray blend in and look like soft highlights for about 1 to 1 1/2 months. After that I will start to see the gray showing up, and I know it&#x27;s time to color again. My hair always looks shiny and healthy after coloring. It also gives my hair some fullness because it deposits color on the hair, thereby making it appear thicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the new formula, I actually prefer it to the old one because with the old one you had to wet your hair before applying the color. With the new formula, you apply it to dry hair which is more convenient. I have not noticed any difference in color results between the old formula and the new one. The two week refresher is an added bonus and will give your color a boost as it starts to fade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope they never stop making this color because I haven&#x27;t found anything that compares!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE May 8, 2013: I still love this color and haven&#x27;t found anything better, but they have changed the formula again, and now you have to apply the product to damp hair once more. This extra step makes the product more difficult to use because it&#x27;s hard to tell if you&#x27;ve missed any areas if your hair is already damp when you apply the solution. Also, the color refresher seems to have changed. It tends to make my hair yellow-looking, and I do not use it anymore. I will still use Natural Instincts, but they could do a better job on the color refresher and make it so that it can be applied to dry hair again.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect color for my hair.  It does not damage your hair and gives it a great shine and very natural looking color.  My complexion is &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; and this is a cool ash dark blonde.  It is so very pretty on me.  It was difficult to decide to put anything on my hair, but I am very glad that I got the nerve to do it and I will use this color from now on.</li>
    <li> works fine, color fine, conditioner fine, 2 week later packet is okay, I like this because it fades and I never get the undone line</li>
    <li> Last summer my hair had gotten majorly bleached out by working outdoors, and as my medium brown roots grew in I had a strange drastic look.  Used this and it evened it out whole head nicely to a light brown...could still see a slight color change as my hair got longer, but much, much better and much healthier.  Nice tones and shades not an overall color block.  I only left dye on for 10 minutes, but next time will stretch it out more because my greys were not covered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though I&#x27;m a light  brunette, I find dark blonde works best for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a lot of red undertones, and no problems with this &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; dye bringing them out.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite shade.  Hard to find in my local stores.</li>
    <li> Perfect product! It colors without damaging my hair.</li>
    <li> This dye is semipermanent, which I don&#x27;t know why is not more popular. My natural color is medium-to-dark brown. My natural highlights are light golden blonde. But you see, I started going gray, which just looks blah and greasy against the brown. So I use this stuff about every 4 weeks and it only covers the greys. It&#x27;s not as saturated as a permanent hair color, but that OK with me, as the dye functions more as highlights and not total coverage. And the nice thing about semipermanent dye is it doesn&#x27;t fry your hair like the permanent kind with real bleach. The only problem is I can no longer find this shade in stores. Amazon to the rescue.</li>
    <li> Yes, the product arrived on time and is exactly what I ordered.  There is no need to fear that it will be expired or the wrong product - everything was exactly as it should be.</li>
    <li> One of the three boxes of Sandlewood hair coloring had half of the coloring agent gone...so not sure I can use it.</li>
    <li> Love this color and always get compliments on it.....</li>
    <li> I wanted to specify the color I used in the subject line because it seems a lot of reviewers have had trouble with colors that turned their hair reddish tints.  My hair is naturally Mousey/Dishwater Blonde and I have experimented with all kinds of hair color.  I finally got tired of spending so much time and money on dramatic color changes and was very happy to realize that this non-permanent color really makes me hair look healthier, shinier and adds a nice little kick to my natural color, turning mousey into a pretty dark blonde.  I love that I don&#x27;t worry about roots growing out because the fade is slow.  Just a note that sticking as close to your natural color as possible is a good idea and also, to repeat two things I read in other reviews and found to be true, note that the instructions are for the color to go onto damp hair (not dry) and that the color refresh packets, for whatever reason, seems to add a lot of warmth (red) to the hair.</li>
    <li> The product is great &amp; and does what it says it will do...:0)  After you find the color that suits you, you will be pleased with the results...:0)</li>
    <li> MY+perfect+color+that+I+can+now+find+only+at+Amazon.++Thank+you+Amazon</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the 10 Dark Cool Blonde, but I think an updated version from the store. This color works well for me, since my hair is medium brown, highlighted to a dark blonde.  I do have gray roots, I&#x27;d say about 50%.  This *blends* the gray. I left it on for 20 to 25 minutes, otherwise the gray coverage would have been poor. I think this will probably last me 3 to 4 weeks, but I wash my hair daily.  Nothing obnoxious about this and it left my hair shiny with blended roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like the color refresher packet - I throw it out. I tried it once in a different color and it was a horrible brown/orange shade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need full and lasting gray coverage, you would be better off with a permanent color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use Ion Color Brilliance from Sally Beauty which is a good product, but when I don&#x27;t have time to get there, I will use the Clairol NI.</li>
    <li> Have been a LONG-time user of this product and why in the world did they change it ??  Do not use the 2 week booster as suggested as it actually stinks !!</li>
