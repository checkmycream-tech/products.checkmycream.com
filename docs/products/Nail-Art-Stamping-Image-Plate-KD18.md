    <li> I love Hello Kitty so when I found this I just had to get it. All the designs work just fine.</li>
    <li> This stamp plate has the cutest stamps and it works great! Surprised for something Hello Kitty that it was so cheap! It did take me a few minutes to get the blue cover off the stamper, it was really stuck on! But that wasnt a probelm, I would definitely reccomend this plate for anyone who loves stamping and Hello Kitty!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my six-year-old niece who loves Hello Kitty. It works great, and while she still needs help using it&#x27;s easy enough that I think she&#x27;ll be stamping her own nails after a few more tries</li>
    <li> I was excited about this plate and when I got it, I tried it immediately and was very sad. Any of the hello kitty and bears did not pick up but the other little designs did. It was like hello kitty was too intricate of a design to pick up :(</li>
    <li> This stamping plate is awsome! It works great for me. Its deep enough for it to stick to your stamper.</li>
    <li> I received the shipment super fast. Even before the expected date. The plates look good, exactly as pictured on site.  This plate has great designs and has a great price.  It fits Tightly in the Bundle Monster case pockets.  BUT Be very aware! This Seller charges an astonishing $3.50 Per Item Shipped for Shipping charges! I paid $50 for a 2oz envelope! I didn&#x27;t notice the charges until I received an email that the order was shipped. Find sellers that charge a flat rate fee.</li>
    <li> Same review as the other, scratches on plates</li>
    <li> These are super cute and work great</li>
    <li> Works great. Seller was good and gave instructions on how to use the plate. I use regular nail polish and it was fine.</li>
    <li> This HELLO KITTY nail art plate is beary cute I Love teddy bears and Hello kitty this was a really good buy for myself as well as for my nail art collection.A must for any Hello Kitty fan or collector.</li>

    <li> Terrible. It does not work. My wife tried to use it, but the arts did not print in the&lt;br /&gt;nails for some reason. So I am not satisfied at all with my purchase and I do not&lt;br /&gt;recommend it!</li>
    <li> I love this stamping plate! All the images are deep enough and you get the full image on the stamper. There&#x27;s a blue protective film that comes on it, so make sure to peel it off before you use it. The blue film comes off easily. You will need to buy the stamper and scraper since it does not come with it. I&#x27;m very happy with this stamping plate and would recommend to get it.</li>
    <li> When I received the template I was super excited because kitty is too cute.  Unfortunately the plate did not pick up color so I am unable to use it. On the other hand the seller was great when I contacted in regards to the problem.  Seller refunded plate and shipping costs.</li>
