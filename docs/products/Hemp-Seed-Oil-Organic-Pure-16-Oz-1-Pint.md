      <li>So make sure not to use it on your eyes!</li>
      <li>Honestly, this just didn&#x27;t work with me.</li>
      <li>Turns out this works WAY better for my skin than anything else I&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
      <li>This hemp seed oil is fantastic!  </li>
      <li>and my skin has never looked better.  </li>
      <li>Also, I take some every day for the health benefits and love it.</li>
      <li>The product that I ordered was called Dr. Adorable Hemp seed / Cannabis sativa  and</li>
      <li>and it was okay.</li>
      <li>and they both love this product as well</li>
      <li>GREAT taste, premium quality, fast shipping...</li>
      <li>i use it for my massage and the clients love it..</li>
      <li>and I truly love what this oil does for my hair</li>
      <li>but it is better than fish oil.</li>
      <li>My hair is softer and more manageable.  </li>
      <li>delivery was always  fast and the packaging was great.</li>
      <li>but I do feel it&#x27;s worth swallowing, good stuff.</li>
      <li>This product is wonderful from head to toe and gets used every single day..</li>
      <li>Well, my hair loved it so much</li>
      <li>But hey, if you decide to use this type of oil, remember there are many other great benefits from it. :)</li>
      <li>Will be ordering more, quick shipping</li>
      <li>This is a great carrier for essential oils</li>
      <li>the one that I received was designed for edible/ dietary supplementary.&amp;#34;Why was the bottle so cheaply assembled ?</li>
      <li>There is a light grassy scent to the product that will fade once applied.  </li>
      <li>this works great for my husbands back.</li>
      <li>Love the hemp oil, delivery was so fast, rub it all over my body, much better than baby oil.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone who makes their own products.</li>
      <li>I originally bought this for my acne.</li>
      <li>Recently I&#x27;ve been adding lavender essential oil which smells great and helps soothe my skin more.  </li>
      <li>Made from hemp, all natural, what&#x27;s not to love.</li>
      <li>Everything I&#x27;ve received from dr adorable has been shipped quickly and wrapped properly.  </li>
      <li>After restocking on Tea Tree Oil, my eyelashes began to grow back healthy.</li>
      <li>Even using the oil alone makes a big difference :)</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!!</li>
      <li>i only order my oils from Dr Adorable as its real deal.</li>
      <li>, scalp makes it more soft, the hair gets really soft too</li>
      <li>Also used it on my sisters hair which was a tad dry and brittle prior, now it&#x27;s more soft and easier to manage :)</li>
      <li>really recomend this oil</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t really notice much difference except my face seemed calmer.</li>
      <li>I use it for my dry hands and dry skin, I think it is good for a lot of uses.</li>
      <li>I received my order within 18 days only to find that it did not match what was originally advertised.</li>
      <li>On a desperate whim I bought this product over a year ago honestly based on more hearsay than science.  </li>
      <li>I bought a little more</li>
      <li>It never got rid of my acne, but I assume it did prevent new ones from developing.</li>
      <li>However he did mention that it works much better than his 800 milligram ibuprofen.we will usually fill up about 6 capsules</li>
      <li>I had heard about many positive effects and benefits from Hemp Seed Oil but not the same from Grape Seed or other similar oils.</li>
      <li>.. I believe it&#x27;s keeping me looking young..  </li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
      <li>What I did like was it was light to use, so it didn&#x27;t feel heavy in my face.</li>
      <li>I use it as a topical skin treatment and it works really well.</li>

    <li> Everything I&#x27;ve received from dr adorable has been shipped quickly and wrapped properly.  And the products are always great!  I won&#x27;t get my hemp from any other vendor</li>
    <li> Will be ordering more, quick shipping</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone who makes their own products. Even using the oil alone makes a big difference :)</li>
    <li> sure makes great salad dressing with vinegar, put it on everything, i use to oil my skin, scalp makes it more soft, the hair gets really soft too</li>
    <li> Love the hemp oil, delivery was so fast, rub it all over my body, much better than baby oil. I put mine in a push dispenser bottle to get just the amount I want. Made from hemp, all natural, what&#x27;s not to love. Also no scent, which I like.</li>
    <li> I used this oil in a mixture of other oils (macadamia nut, avacado, etc) to use on my hair as a treatment and it&#x27;s worked great! Also used it on my sisters hair which was a tad dry and brittle prior, now it&#x27;s more soft and easier to manage :)</li>
    <li> GREAT taste, premium quality, fast shipping...!&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU*****</li>
    <li> My daughter is in college and is about to graduate with a dual degree in Massage Therapy. This is going to be a Christmas gift for her as I had also purchased several Essential Oils and was looking for a base oil that she could use which not many people would be allergic to. I had heard about many positive effects and benefits from Hemp Seed Oil but not the same from Grape Seed or other similar oils. So, the results are yet to be determined.</li>
    <li> I use it as a topical skin treatment and it works really well. I would definitely recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I use it for my dry hands and dry skin, I think it is good for a lot of uses.</li>
    <li> the doc is the best supplier of quality oils and butters...even one you did know you would use!</li>
    <li> This hemp seed oil is fantastic!  I have been using it as a face cleanser and my skin has never looked better.  My pores look smaller and my acne has cleared up.  Also, I take some every day for the health benefits and love it.</li>
    <li> This oil is. Wonderful.. I use is as a way to message my muscles and any aches and pains.. This product is wonderful from head to toe and gets used every single day.. I&#x27;ve given a bottle to my mother and niece and they both love this product as well.. I believe it&#x27;s keeping me looking young..  There is a smell that is very subtle however I won&#x27;t waste on drop</li>
    <li> I bought this product in the 4oz size as a trial.  Well, my hair loved it so much I bought a little more 16oz.&lt;br /&gt;My product arrived as stated this time and I truly love what this oil does for my hair and so does my friends who come visit and use my hair products.&lt;br /&gt;This oil adds great sheen.  My hair is softer and more manageable.  I may try another hemp oil with a less expensive price point and if I don&#x27;t like it I will stick with this brand.</li>
    <li> I get complimented on my skin all the time.  I highly recommend it!! I have purchased it several times and plan on continuing it</li>
    <li> I originally bought this for my acne. I had read great reviews about using Hemp Seed Oil for acne. Honestly, this just didn&#x27;t work with me. I have the occasional pimple here and there, some blackheads, and sometimes whiteheads. I have tried it as a face cleanser and it was okay. I have also tried it as topical. It never got rid of my acne, but I assume it did prevent new ones from developing. What I did like was it was light to use, so it didn&#x27;t feel heavy in my face. I didn&#x27;t really notice much difference except my face seemed calmer. I have also used this for dryness and it did worked wonders! Although, I haven&#x27;t used it in awhile. I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing it is NOT good for is eye makeup removal! One day, I ran out of Tea Tree Oil to remove my mascara and decided to try the Hemp Seed Oil. BIG MISTAKE. My eyelashes become brittle, short, and started breaking off. This was after only two nights use. After restocking on Tea Tree Oil, my eyelashes began to grow back healthy. So make sure not to use it on your eyes! But hey, if you decide to use this type of oil, remember there are many other great benefits from it. :)</li>
    <li> As described by seller. No problems.</li>
    <li> I know everyones skin is different but this oil does wonders for my skin. It has a nutty smell but fades in less than minute.</li>
    <li> Great price, and delivery. i tend to search the internet for comparable pricing, and this place one this time. Will look again for other things.</li>
    <li> It smells. Didn&#x27;t expect it to smell.</li>
    <li> this works great for my husbands back. It does not completely take away the pain, but he doesn&#x27;t use it regularly. However he did mention that it works much better than his 800 milligram ibuprofen.we will usually fill up about 6 capsules and he&#x27;ll take with water. You will do that a few times a day</li>
    <li> i use it for my massage and the clients love it.. i know it has a limited shelf life so i mix fractionated coconut oil and its the best massage glide ever. i only order my oils from Dr Adorable as its real deal. delivery was always  fast and the packaging was great. one of my clients feedback was after massaging him with the hemp oil few days later his harmones is like working overdrive. hemp oil has great uses and yea for those people who never smoke week before. it has a grassy smell but  IT IS NOT OVERPOWERING . all you can do is just put some  lavender essential oil  in it and you are good to go.. at the time of writing this .. my 2nd bottle of hemp will be arriving tomorrow (JANUARY 8, 2014). i have recommended hemp seed oil to my friends and spreading the word about its great benefits not just for the skin or hair but it is better than fish oil.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and I struggle with eczema.  I&#x27;ve been to a couple doctors and 2 different dermatologists for my eczema and the only thing they gave me was steroid creams/ointments which just made it worse.  On a desperate whim I bought this product over a year ago honestly based on more hearsay than science.  Turns out this works WAY better for my skin than anything else I&#x27;ve ever tried.  Recently I&#x27;ve been adding lavender essential oil which smells great and helps soothe my skin more.  Now I&#x27;m using this as my all over moisturizer too because if it helps improve my eczema why not?  There is a light grassy scent to the product that will fade once applied.  This is a great carrier for essential oils (I&#x27;ve used lavender, peppermint, rosemary &amp; tea tree oil).</li>
    <li> I made mayo with this,.. oh so good ,. fresh tasting flavor ill be making salid dressing as well as other things</li>
    <li> really recomend this oil it&#x27;s very good for skin, hair, joints and even for cooking if you want but I personally don&#x27;t like the smell</li>
    <li> tasty! just kidding. I chase it with orange juice but I do feel it&#x27;s worth swallowing, good stuff.</li>
    <li> I received my order within 18 days only to find that it did not match what was originally advertised. &amp;#34;Why&amp;#34; was there no label or product seal ? The product that I ordered was called Dr. Adorable Hemp seed / Cannabis sativa  and the one that I received was designed for edible/ dietary supplementary.&amp;#34;Why was the bottle so cheaply assembled ?</li>
