      <li>I love that!</li>
      <li>I love these!</li>
      <li>TO CHANGE INTO BEFORE I GO OUT FOR THE EVENING WITHOUT HAVING TO DEAL WITH THE TIME IT WOULD TAKE TO POLISH MY OWN NAILS</li>
      <li>These did the trick, held up nicely, and I even put the jewels on.</li>
      <li>a day.&lt;br /&gt;The best part of this product was that i received many compliments and everyone thought they were real!</li>
      <li>Okay, these are AMAZING for me.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m totally in love with the Impress Nails.</li>
      <li>I love these nails.</li>
      <li>Overal it was an ok product.</li>
      <li>I ride horses and have playful puppies and use a lot of lotions etc...) and to top it off</li>
      <li>and they stay on for a week or more.</li>
      <li>plus so I&#x27;m sure for a lot of people they do.......</li>
      <li>Love these things....</li>
      <li>Will be purchasing more</li>
      <li>These nails are ok.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite brand of stick on nails</li>
      <li>and once I removed them the top of all of my nails have been peeling.</li>
      <li>Will be buying them again for sure.</li>
      <li>/&gt;That said, why I love these nails:&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>They are awesome for weddings, or parties, or vacation, especially when you can&#x27;t pack nail polish remover or all your stuff, you don&#x27;t have to worry about nail polish or manicures chipping!</li>
      <li>I could have used them, they are a nice colour and perfect length for everyday activities.</li>
      <li>Super cute, shiny, and easy to apply!</li>
      <li>I ordered the Kiss brand because the size 0 fits my thumbnails perfectly but with this product in particular they were closer to a size 3, very narrow.&lt;br /&gt;Wish</li>
      <li>but the thumbs fit better</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re trying this brand for the first time, DO use the alcohol wipe thoroughly on each nail before application, and pick the sizes in the set that best fit the curve of your natural nail.</li>
      <li>I like to have nails but don&#x27;t have time to go to a salon &amp; prefer the option of easy removal if I want to.</li>
      <li>Most importantly be sure to find the right size for you nail.</li>
      <li>When I realized which end was down and which was up they went on perfectly.    </li>
      <li>I reapplied with nail glue and it was fine.</li>
      <li>It might be important to note that I use and abuse my hands though.</li>
      <li>I wouldadd this color to my subscribe and save if it was available.</li>
      <li>Overall, these are great.</li>
      <li>If I polish the nail surface with a smooth file, then clean with some polish remover, the nails will stay for longer.</li>
      <li>She clean peel and stick.</li>
      <li>But y&#x27;know, that probably means you can get more than eight minutes out of real manicure, so just go do that,</li>
      <li>Its not bad</li>
      <li>They have been doing this now for over a month and have peeled off into the quick.</li>
      <li>you lucky jerk.</li>
      <li>The nails inside were luckily undamaged.</li>
      <li>There have been some people complaining about how long they last, but they were perfect for me</li>
      <li>And they look real!!</li>
      <li>Had to actually get my own nail glue to prevent them from falling off.</li>
      <li>These are the best pre-glued false nails I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
      <li>To remove, use one nail as a sort of wedge to push between another nail and your own nail, starting at one side and working your way across right through the adhesive.</li>
      <li>They are very flexible (even when I&#x27;ve been taking godmode doses of biotin and they&#x27;re feeling pretty strong) and everything just peels off them in sheets.  </li>
      <li>I used them once on Halloween and had about a 65% success rate for the night (I spent a lot of time putting them on and making sure they were secure.</li>
      <li>However, this wasn&#x27;t one of my personal favorite color choices</li>
      <li>I love these nails because they are more flexible and &amp;#34;squishy&amp;#34; than most, which allows them to better conform to my natural nails and to take a heavy beating when I&#x27;m working with machinery or accidentally slamming my hands into metal or heavy objects.</li>
      <li>I tried these Impress nails a while back and at first didn&#x27;t like them because they popped off easily.</li>
      <li>NEVER had any damage to my real nails using these.</li>
      <li>I really like them.</li>
      <li>I like that they are ready to come off after a week or two</li>
      <li>My natural nails are pretty bad, but my good friend who uses them too, hers are very healthy.</li>
      <li>For longer real nails, you may not like it.</li>
      <li>THANKS</li>
      <li>You can&#x27;t find proper sizes for your fingernails without spreading them all out, then good luck finding the match for the other</li>
      <li>Even if you do get them on for longer than 10 minutes, they will surely betray you if you plan to use your hands for anything other than admiring their beauty.</li>
      <li>In fact I bite my nails, so they&#x27;re very thin, break easily in the rare occasions I&#x27;m able to let them grow, but Impress never caused any damage to them!&lt;br</li>
      <li>The others I used popped off in less than 24 hrs (some within a couple hours) and that was with the brush on nail glue--and to top it off many of the other brands screamed &#x27;press on nail&#x27;-</li>
      <li>I LOVE HAVING A BLACK PRESS ON NAILS</li>
      <li>Lasted less than a week more like 2 days...still served their purpose though.  </li>
      <li>and I was so glad to see that they had black.</li>
      <li>Mainlining biotin, rubbing things into my cuticles, countless bonding basecoats and fancy topcoats and miracle products, &amp;#34;gel style&amp;#34; polishes, every application technique possible - never gotten more than 48 hours out of a home manicure in my life.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I have bought two of these impress nail products and from my experience as long as you cut your nails shorter than the false nail, take off any previous nail polish, wash your hands afterward in warm water, buff, and use the prep pad included-Everything will look and work great.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re super easy to remove (I just delicately pull them).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My recommendation is, if you like a design Impress offers, go ahead and get it but use real nail glue.</li>
      <li>The size is shorter than other fake nails, which for me is perfect.</li>
      <li>If you choose the right size there should not be any gaps and application is much simpler than other adhesives I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Oh, one last con: although they last long, you should avoid using them for things we usually use nails and don&#x27;t realize (opening a bracelet or watch, scratching your own skin, or anything for which we use nails as \\&quot;tools\\&quot;), except when using with super glue, of course...</li>
      <li>They look like a professional manicure, they stay on tight for a week or more (with added glue if necessary)</li>
      <li>The glue keeps them from chipping/shredding/etc... and pulling them off is fairly easy even without soaking them as I do because I&#x27;m impatient but I would recommend soaking them first because it does hurt a bit to pull them off dry.</li>
      <li>I used to go get my nails done professionally</li>
      <li>Never painting my natural nails again.</li>
      <li>I think this is a product where having kinda flexible natural nails is a plus?</li>
      <li>I want to Love them but the only issue I have is the thumb sizes on the short length are insanely short... if they fixed the thumb then I would totally give them 4.5 stars.  </li>
      <li>Loved these false nails!</li>
      <li>Lasted less than expected but still ok</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t worn them long enough to comment on the length of wear -- but I will say this, a lot of people have mentioned that the nails are not wide enough, and I thought that was the case too for me, until I realized I was fitting the nails upside down!</li>
      <li>but the size are not wide for my nails</li>
      <li>With that, these will absolutely stay on as advertised, even if you&#x27;re a bit rough on them.</li>
      <li>longer and my left hand, less on my right.  </li>
      <li>After trying this brand for the first time I tried several other brands of &amp;#34;press on nails&amp;#34; that were a bit cheaper thinking all would be created equal</li>
      <li>If you have Super Turbo Hard</li>
      <li>Yes, the &amp;#34;text appeal&amp;#34; color is just very high gloss black.</li>
      <li>These easy to put on false nails are my solution.  </li>

    <li> Super cute, shiny, and easy to apply!</li>
    <li> Yes, the &amp;#34;text appeal&amp;#34; color is just very high gloss black. If you&#x27;re trying this brand for the first time, DO use the alcohol wipe thoroughly on each nail before application, and pick the sizes in the set that best fit the curve of your natural nail. With that, these will absolutely stay on as advertised, even if you&#x27;re a bit rough on them. I&#x27;ve done three days and still had to work to remove them. To remove, use one nail as a sort of wedge to push between another nail and your own nail, starting at one side and working your way across right through the adhesive. These are for a single use.</li>
    <li> Okay, these are AMAZING for me. Here&#x27;s the deal: my nails suck. I have tried it all. Mainlining biotin, rubbing things into my cuticles, countless bonding basecoats and fancy topcoats and miracle products, &amp;#34;gel style&amp;#34; polishes, every application technique possible - never gotten more than 48 hours out of a home manicure in my life. Even Shellac starts coming off in a week. I really don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m that hard on my nails and I have been convinced I was doing it wrong because nothing would stick. They are very flexible (even when I&#x27;ve been taking godmode doses of biotin and they&#x27;re feeling pretty strong) and everything just peels off them in sheets.  I put these on Sunday night. I cleaned off my nails with rubbing alcohol before noticing the prep pad, so then I used that too. Applied one hand at a time then watched TV while pressing down each nail at the middle and then along the sides as suggested. I was careful with water that night but took a shower the next morning, and also filed the corners a bit rounder and filed off the little nubbin at the end. It&#x27;s been 3 days now so that means they&#x27;ve already outlasted any manicure I&#x27;ve given myself, and they don&#x27;t feel like they&#x27;re going anywhere, so I&#x27;m callin&#x27; it. Never painting my natural nails again. TEAM STICK ON. They don&#x27;t look or feel particularly fake or obtrusive - about like when I&#x27;ve gotten shellac.  I have a theory - I think this is a product where having kinda flexible natural nails is a plus? I&#x27;ve slipped up and used them to open key rings etc a few times and it feels like the give my nails have under them is kinda picking up the slack. If you have Super Turbo Hard As Steel Talons I can see these popping off the second you move wrong. But y&#x27;know, that probably means you can get more than eight minutes out of real manicure, so just go do that, you lucky jerk. If you have bendy nails and can&#x27;t keep polish on, though, give these a try!</li>
    <li> I wear these all the time.  I have thin nails, going to the nail salon where they sand the nail bed, doesn&#x27;t work for me because eventually the nails get so thin that they start to crack easily.  These easy to put on false nails are my solution.  I clean the nails with acetone and then press and hold the false nail to the bed.  They remain on for about a week; longer and my left hand, less on my right.  When a nail comes off I re-clean the nail and then select a new false nail to replace it with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend that you use gloves for washing dishes, cleaning and the like so the nails last longer.  I don&#x27;t swim so I don&#x27;t know how regular swimming would effect the longevity.</li>
    <li> These are the best pre-glued false nails I&#x27;ve ever tried. That said, the glue on these still barely holds for a day on my nails, but my job requires physical labor and my hands are often covered in harsh cleaning chemicals, so false nail wear is a frustrating game for me. If you want pre-glued nails that last a long time and your hands don&#x27;t go through the type of abuse mine do, then these are your best bet. I love these nails because they are more flexible and &amp;#34;squishy&amp;#34; than most, which allows them to better conform to my natural nails and to take a heavy beating when I&#x27;m working with machinery or accidentally slamming my hands into metal or heavy objects. I wear these nails with Kiss&#x27; Maximum Speed nail glue which holds for about a week, and with touch ups I can keep these nails around for two weeks or longer.</li>
    <li> My friends and I got these (not this color, some insane ghetto pattern) as a funny joke for a polo fields day once... turned out they stayed on for over a week! Ever since then we have been getting them instead of acrylics or manicures. My natural nails are pretty bad, but my good friend who uses them too, hers are very healthy. Neither of us have noticed any negative side effects from these press-on nails, in fact I never noticed any damage. Then again, I only take them off once one or two has fallen off, I wait until the adhesive is loose already, so it&#x27;s not really a big deal. They are awesome for weddings, or parties, or vacation, especially when you can&#x27;t pack nail polish remover or all your stuff, you don&#x27;t have to worry about nail polish or manicures chipping! We both wore different colors of these to our vacation in Mexico-- we were there for 5 nights, 6 days, in the pool and ocean CONSTANTLY and they didn&#x27;t come off! And everyone is always commenting on how they look so good. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Lasted less than a week more like 2 days...still served their purpose though.  Lasted less than expected but still ok</li>
    <li> Loved these false nails! There have been some people complaining about how long they last, but they were perfect for me and they lasted a week, just as the box says (which is great because I liked to change my nail color up every week). I have bought two of these impress nail products and from my experience as long as you cut your nails shorter than the false nail, take off any previous nail polish, wash your hands afterward in warm water, buff, and use the prep pad included-Everything will look and work great. Most importantly be sure to find the right size for you nail. If it is too big or too small, it wont even last you a day.&lt;br /&gt;The best part of this product was that i received many compliments and everyone thought they were real! :) awesome.</li>
    <li> Not a big fan of fake nails in general, but needed something quick in time for a wedding. These did the trick, held up nicely, and I even put the jewels on. Received compliments on them and a few people thought they were my real nails.</li>
    <li> I LOVE HAVING A BLACK PRESS ON NAILS TO CHANGE INTO BEFORE I GO OUT FOR THE EVENING WITHOUT HAVING TO DEAL WITH THE TIME IT WOULD TAKE TO POLISH MY OWN NAILS I WILL BUY THEM AGAIN WHEN I RUN OUT THANKS</li>
    <li> The plastic faux nail polish bottle used to store the nails arrived cracked nearly in half inside the package. The nails inside were luckily undamaged. I ordered the Kiss brand because the size 0 fits my thumbnails perfectly but with this product in particular they were closer to a size 3, very narrow.&lt;br /&gt;Wish I could have used them, they are a nice colour and perfect length for everyday activities.</li>
    <li> I used to go get my nails done professionally but it just is too expensive and I work a night shift so making it to daytime appointments is always hard for me. I tried these Impress nails a while back and at first didn&#x27;t like them because they popped off easily. I have read may reviewers say they stay on for a week plus so I&#x27;m sure for a lot of people they do.......However, I decided to try them with a brush on nail glue (just brush it on my nail not the false nail; the false nail already has an adhesive soft glue on it) and then press them on and they stay on for a week or more. And they look real!! After trying this brand for the first time I tried several other brands of &amp;#34;press on nails&amp;#34; that were a bit cheaper thinking all would be created equal and I was wrong! The others I used popped off in less than 24 hrs (some within a couple hours) and that was with the brush on nail glue--and to top it off many of the other brands screamed &#x27;press on nail&#x27;- which obviously you don&#x27;t want people to know your nails are press on. They just looked fake all the way around. I was actually relieved when they popped off. But these do not look fake at all. They look like a professional manicure and they do stay on tight for a week (for me only if I use a brush on glue with it. It might be important to note that I use and abuse my hands though. I ride horses and have playful puppies and use a lot of lotions etc...) and to top it off they do not damage your nails even with the brush on glue added to it. I feel they actually protect my nails. The glue keeps them from chipping/shredding/etc... and pulling them off is fairly easy even without soaking them as I do because I&#x27;m impatient but I would recommend soaking them first because it does hurt a bit to pull them off dry. I now have the black and the French on my subscribe and save because I hope to continuously use them. I like that they are ready to come off after a week or two so I can keep switching around colors. I wouldadd this color to my subscribe and save if it was available. Overall, these are great. They look like a professional manicure, they stay on tight for a week or more (with added glue if necessary), they do not damage your nails, it is wwaaaaaaayyy less expensive than getting them done professionally, it is extremely quick to put them on and take them off, and the don&#x27;t damage your nail.</li>
    <li> I want to Love them but the only issue I have is the thumb sizes on the short length are insanely short... if they fixed the thumb then I would totally give them 4.5 stars.  I tried medium length but they were to long but the thumbs fit better, it&#x27;s like on the short length the thumb is just a bit bitter then the middle finger... not the correct proportions on the bed of the nail or length I try to make it work. East to put on last 1-2 weeks, and they DO NOT hurt your nails I love that!</li>
    <li> I love these nails. My only complaint is they don&#x27;t have a lot of colors vs. sizes, and also that you can&#x27;t find them in all CVS. So I buy in CVS when I can find, and also in Amazon the colors I can&#x27;t find in stores.&lt;br /&gt;Some colors in Amazon are cheaper than CVS, but then with delivery addition, it&#x27;s the same... Besides the extra bucks at CVS...&lt;br /&gt;That said, why I love these nails:&lt;br /&gt;- After I select the sizes, it actually takes me 5 minutes to put them on!&lt;br /&gt;- They look real!&lt;br /&gt;- They shine! Colors are beautiful!&lt;br /&gt;- The size is shorter than other fake nails, which for me is perfect. For longer real nails, you may not like it. It&#x27;ll not cover them.&lt;br /&gt;- NEVER had any damage to my real nails using these. In fact I bite my nails, so they&#x27;re very thin, break easily in the rare occasions I&#x27;m able to let them grow, but Impress never caused any damage to them!&lt;br /&gt;- If I polish the nail surface with a smooth file, then clean with some polish remover, the nails will stay for longer. My record is 6 days (including swimming pool, moving day, etc...)&lt;br /&gt;- If I want them to last longer, I can use super glue and they&#x27;ll be just like regular fake nails.&lt;br /&gt;(super glue does damage my nails a little, so I only use them in very extreme situations).&lt;br /&gt;- They help me stop biting my nails.&lt;br /&gt;- They&#x27;re super easy to remove (I just delicately pull them).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, one last con: although they last long, you should avoid using them for things we usually use nails and don&#x27;t realize (opening a bracelet or watch, scratching your own skin, or anything for which we use nails as \\&quot;tools\\&quot;), except when using with super glue, of course...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m totally in love with the Impress Nails. However, this wasn&#x27;t one of my personal favorite color choices but, they do go with almost any outfit.</li>
    <li> I wore these for a week and once I removed them the top of all of my nails have been peeling. They have been doing this now for over a month and have peeled off into the quick. imPress nails damage your nails. I wouldn&#x27;t not recommend to ANYONE. Rather, I am warning everyone what they do to their nails after wearing for just 5-7 days.</li>
    <li> to small must have been made for asian women</li>
    <li> Its not bad but the size are not wide for my nails so I gave them away to someone else</li>
    <li> They are the perfect quick manicure. What a deal on savings. She clean peel and stick. (And file if you want, but I just get the short length.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They last about a week and Im guilty of gluing them back on for another. :)</li>
    <li> These nails are ok. I haven&#x27;t worn them long enough to comment on the length of wear -- but I will say this, a lot of people have mentioned that the nails are not wide enough, and I thought that was the case too for me, until I realized I was fitting the nails upside down! When I realized which end was down and which was up they went on perfectly.    **EDIT**  15 minutes after I wrote this review my nails started to peel off. So, the sticky pad inside the nails suck. I reapplied with nail glue and it was fine. My recommendation is, if you like a design Impress offers, go ahead and get it but use real nail glue.</li>
    <li> I hate these. I used them once on Halloween and had about a 65% success rate for the night (I spent a lot of time putting them on and making sure they were secure. I might have even used extra adhesive). Since Halloween I have tried using the other sets as they are. It&#x27;s annoying because:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The nails are disorganized in this little faux nailpolish container. You can&#x27;t find proper sizes for your fingernails without spreading them all out, then good luck finding the match for the other hand.&lt;br /&gt;2. The adhesive is terrible and does not stick. Every time I would go to peel the adhesive for the next nail, the previous nails would pop off.&lt;br /&gt;3. Even if you do get them on for longer than 10 minutes, they will surely betray you if you plan to use your hands for anything other than admiring their beauty.</li>
    <li> I am a mom so I do a lot of hand washing. I like to have nails but don&#x27;t have time to go to a salon &amp; prefer the option of easy removal if I want to. I tried several different brands of press on when I found these. I really like them. They stay on for a couple of days through all of the dishes, cleanups and handwashing I do which is impressive. If you choose the right size there should not be any gaps and application is much simpler than other adhesives I&#x27;ve tried. I would not recommend using the charms however.</li>
    <li> Love these things....I put mine on a tour bus and it took about 20 minutes and they lasted the 4 days of my trip and only one popped off (just put another on there).  I did notice some seemed short and some seemed longer. But they looked just like acrylic nails. I will buy these from now on instead of subjecting myself to manicures for big money and unsanitary practices! Not sure how they will last doing real house work and such...but for trips, it was perfect!</li>
    <li> I love these! This is my favorite brand of stick on nails and I was so glad to see that they had black. Will be purchasing more</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t stuck to well even when I followed the instructions. Had to actually get my own nail glue to prevent them from falling off. I wouldn&#x27;t buy these again. Just get your nails done at a nail salon.</li>
    <li> Awesome nails. Great quality.  Will be buying them again for sure.</li>
    <li> Lasted less than a day</li>
    <li> I loved the color. I only have it three stars because it&#x27;s too flexible to work with. Overal it was an ok product.</li>
    <li> You haven&#x27;t used these yet?  They are fab!  Try them!</li>
