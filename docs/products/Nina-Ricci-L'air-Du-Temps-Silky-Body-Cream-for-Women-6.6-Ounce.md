      <li>However, the aroma is much more intense than I expected, especially when you first open the jar.</li>
      <li>I have tried to reach the company, first by email; their response was to tell me to call their customer service dept, which I did, only to be told to leave a message, to which they have not responded.  </li>
      <li>Not heavy, but will carry me thru the day.  </li>
      <li>I do not like loud perfumes.  </li>

    <li> I love this fragrance, wearing it for years.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this scent for years and nothing else. I&#x27;m 50 now and as a child I can remember my mother wearing this. The body cream is so luxurious, absorbs well with no greasy feel. The scent is light but lasts. I have so many people come into my office and say that it smells so nice and have had them say the same to me.</li>
    <li> YES YES!!! I LOVE THE SMELL AND I FEEL GOOD WHEN I WEAR NINA Ricci</li>
    <li> We buy this for her every year at Christmas time.  She loves it and  looks forward to this special treat.</li>
    <li> Thank you so much for having these items that are difficult to find. I do appreciate your services and customer friendly approach.  L&#x27;air Du Temps by Nina Ricci is an old product but one of the best. Thank you for having it in stock. Made my Christmas much nicer!!!!!</li>
    <li> THIS IS A GREAT FRAGRANCE I HAVE USED FOR YEARS.  THE FRAGRANCE IS VERY UNIQUE AND SPECIAL. IT HAS A VERY FRESH AND UPLIFTING FRAGRANCE WHEN I USE IT.</li>
    <li> I love the scent, light and fresh with just the right amount of fragrance. It is very pleasant and not heavy like some Seniors tend to lean toward and yes my wife is a Senior.</li>
    <li> One thing I would say in describing myself is that, &amp;#34;I like all things lady&amp;#34;.  From my point of view, one of the finer things about being a lady is smelling wonderful.  I am a discriminate lady as well.  I do not like loud perfumes.  I also like to smell pleasing and not insult the senses of myself or those around me.  Sung has been a product I have used since it was created many years ago.  Also, one of the greatest things about Sung is the fact tht it makes a body cream.  Nothing like a wonderful, long hot bath and then to moisturize your body all over while still slightly still damp. Body cream does an excellent job of softening, moisturizing and oh so soft and sweetly scenting the body before slight spray of perfume to top it off.  Usually, by layering in this manner, I&#x27;m good for about 18 hours.  There is no compliment I enjoy more than being out in public somewhere and, man or woman, stranger remark to me that I smell so nice.  Sung does a body good--kinda like milk, huh?</li>
    <li> I have used this since the 70&#x27;s and love it.</li>
    <li> Leaves my skin really soft, and smells fantastic.  Not heavy, but will carry me thru the day.  I do love it.</li>
    <li> Wonderful! Very pleased with product! Have used this scent in all other forms; first time to find body cream. Will re-order.</li>
    <li> This is so creamy and thick, will last a long time. So silky smooth, it is worth the $50!&lt;br /&gt;Smells so good, clean smell just like the perfume.</li>
    <li> Wonderful satiny body cream</li>
    <li> When I opened the jar, I knew right away that this body cream was old. It was an awful brownish colour and didn&#x27;t smell right. I returned it right away and expect a full refund, including the shipping cost. I will never order that product online again.</li>
    <li> Was great to get a product shipped to my front door. A really great buy. I will not have to drive out of town to purchase this product anymore.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find this in the stores so it&#x27;s great purchasing it here.  When you wear the body cream the beautiful scent stays with you all day so no need to freshen up.  The cream is so luxurious and a small amount goes a long way.  Fast shipping and delivery.</li>
    <li> This body cream is extremely smooth and silky, and it feels lovely on the skin. The aroma lasts for a long time. However, the aroma is much more intense than I expected, especially when you first open the jar. The company explained that they have a very fresh batch, so maybe that is the reason.</li>
    <li> Please, please keep selling this product!&lt;br /&gt;Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regards,&lt;br /&gt;Ilia</li>
    <li> I have used this body cream for over 40 years, and was delighted to see it offered at a really good price, so bought 2!  Bad move!  The first jar was discolored, had pools of oil ( fragrance?), and smelled rancid! The second jar was also bad!  I have tried to reach the company, first by email; their response was to tell me to call their customer service dept, which I did, only to be told to leave a message, to which they have not responded.  I have finally called Amazon; they have said they will follow up, and get this resolved.  I&#x27;m hoping they have another source that will have this wonderful product at a reasonable price.  To be continued!</li>
    <li> Love it! Thanks - smells WONDERFUL!</li>
