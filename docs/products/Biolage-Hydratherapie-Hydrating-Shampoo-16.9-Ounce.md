<li> The bottle was in good condition, so I&#x27;m not sure what was wrong.</li>
<li> Makes my hair so soft, not weighed down.</li>
<li> I have curly long hair.</li>
<li> This shampoo has a management quality as it tames grey hair and restores some moisture to it.</li>
<li> I do change out my use of different shampoos, but this one is always within that change, due to the hydration factor that is has for my hair type.</li>
<li> Made my scalp really dry.</li>
<li> When using a professional shampoo/conditioner, one only needs to use a small amount as it is not watered down llike OTC.</li>
<li> My hair is color-treated but for some reason Biolage&#x27;s shampoo for color-treated hair (pink cap) leaves my hair feeling like I need to wash it again.</li>
<li> My hair and scalp is less dry after just 3 uses.</li>
<li> I would recommend the after shower leave-in conditioner, as the any wash-out conditioner will weigh hair down and leave it looking greasy.</li>
<li> so fluffy, thick and shiny, bouncy-healthy looking, and I swore off brands like Panten and Herbal essence as they made my hair flat and dull looking after only a few washes, HOWEVER,</li>
<li> It is so expensive at the salon</li>
<li> I was a sad panda.</li>
<li> I use this as body wash because it is expensive and makes my girlfriend mad.</li>
<li> And the shampoo smells awful.</li>

    <li> What can I say.  It&#x27;s the best of the best!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of Biolage products. This shampoo is great and leaves my hair feeling clean and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down. I would recommend the after shower leave-in conditioner, as the any wash-out conditioner will weigh hair down and leave it looking greasy.</li>
    <li> Got this product on time and the seller was kind enough to provide free conditioner and body lotion(biolage) I would want to continue buying from this seller in the future as they definitely know how to keep their customers happy!</li>
    <li> Normally I love Biolage. I buy it when I feel like splurging. I love the scent. My husband recently purchased these for me. I was so stoked to use them. And the shampoo smells awful. It smells like it&#x27;s been kept in a musty closet. The conditioner was normal. It still lathers. The bottle was in good condition, so I&#x27;m not sure what was wrong. I was a sad panda.</li>
    <li> So for awhile I was only using organic shampoos because they made my hair o so fluffy, thick and shiny, bouncy-healthy looking, and I swore off brands like Panten and Herbal essence as they made my hair flat and dull looking after only a few washes, HOWEVER, brands like Nexus and Biolage, altho pricey, always makes my hair look good for an extended period of time, when I tire of all the organic brands, and smells awesome too...</li>
    <li> Currently live in Colorado where it gets very dry in the winter.  Have been using this product for years and simply love it.  It keeps my hair moisturized, soft and vibrant.</li>
    <li> I buy this for my hubs, he loves it</li>
    <li> This is all we use, love it</li>
    <li> Makes hair a little too fly away.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing. I have curly long hair. It makes my hair feel clean and not dried out. Love it.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. I use it about once a week. It&#x27;s my &amp;#34;special&amp;#34; shampoo, when I want my hair to feel EXTRA special. It feels so good, it lathers nicely, I love the smell, and it just makes my hair feel so clean and light</li>
    <li> This shampoo works well for my fine, dry scalp and hair as well as my husbands daily use. I do change out my use of different shampoos, but this one is always within that change, due to the hydration factor that is has for my hair type. The company gave me an excellent price on the shampoo and it was received as expected.</li>
    <li> It made my hair drier than before i started using it</li>
    <li> This shampoo has a management quality as it tames grey hair and restores some moisture to it. It also has a nice smell.</li>
    <li> Just what the Dr. ordered.</li>
    <li> We have used this shampoo for years and it is great and no build-up!  It is so expensive at the salon so we are glad you carry such a great product.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo!  Been using it for years and wouldn&#x27;t think of changing.</li>
    <li> I love the fragrance and how it makes my hair feel but it dries out my scalp.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. My hair is color-treated but for some reason Biolage&#x27;s shampoo for color-treated hair (pink cap) leaves my hair feeling like I need to wash it again. This shampoo does the trick, every time...and it smells amazing.</li>
    <li> This is the only shampoo that I use. If you want young looking and feeling hair this is the product to use.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent seller.</li>
    <li> This product is definitely another one of my top 100 products used in my household.  I&#x27;ve used Biolage products for many years.  My daughters and I discovered Matrix products when they were teens (they now have teens of their own) and they&#x27;ve been on our bathroom shelves since that time.  This product is great for me since I hate the residue left from some types of volumizing shampoos.  As I get older, I find I do need the hydrating shampoo which leaves my hair feeling silky smooth.  What can I say?  Given my choice of the great shampoos out there, I choose Biolage.</li>
    <li> This old hair loves it.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! The scent and the way it makes my hair feeel. My hair is colored and I could probably get away w/o conditioner. The cost is also very good! When using a professional shampoo/conditioner, one only needs to use a small amount as it is not watered down llike OTC. Thanks for selling this at a great price!</li>
    <li> It and the conditioning really made a difference in my hair, shinier love it</li>
    <li> This is really a good product, very gentle &amp; leaves hair so manageable; I really like their hairspray, too; usually they sell only in salons.</li>
    <li> Amazing shampoo for dry/flaky hair. My hair and scalp is less dry after just 3 uses. Leaves hair feeling soft.</li>
    <li> i am using this shampoo from last 3 years i never had any complaints. i am very much satisfied with this.</li>
    <li> FOR THIS PRICE?! i thought ehhh no-what if its &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34;? but i said ok ill just try it.. i am in love- its like im at the salon everytime i use this, and whenever i see it in stores i smile knowing i saved about 50% buying it on amazon. clean smooth hair everytime, and i get compliments on how my hair smells from my boyfriend! love love love this</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for as long as I can remember, it always does a great job of cleaning my hair while nourishing my ends. I have thick, wavy and frizzy hair that gets a lot of heat from blow drying and straightening and love what this does for me.</li>
    <li> I use this as body wash because it is expensive and makes my girlfriend mad. Sometimes I just squirt it on the ground if she is on my nerves!</li>
    <li> Made my scalp really dry.</li>
    <li> My favorite shampoo.  I wish it wasn&#x27;t so pricey, but it is worth it.  Salon quality!</li>
    <li> love that I can get this product w/o the salon price!</li>
    <li> Makes my hair so soft, not weighed down. It smells and feels clean!</li>
