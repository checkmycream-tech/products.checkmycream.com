<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I believe everyone should use a sonic tooth brush. It cleans the teeth and gums really well. The vibration at first is weird, but after multiple uses you will adapt to it.</li>
    <li> Sonicare toothbrushes work very well.  My teeth feel cleaner than they ever have with a traditional toothbrush.  I bought one of these (Flexcare), and it lasted 3 years and 4 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had used the basic Elite series for a while, but the screw-in brushes got gross and smelly, so when the toothbrush died, I got the flex care. I like the snap on brush heads for these brushes.  These are great brushes and do a great job cleaning, but I think they are too expensive and they include features I never used (and would bet most people don&#x27;t use).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When this one died, I decided to go with the most basic Sonicare toothbrush that had the quadpacer and this style of snap-on brush head. At the time of this review, that ends up being the Gum Health Sonicare, which is $80 vs. the Flexcare at $130.  So far, I&#x27;m happy with the gum health toothbrush, but it&#x27;s only been a week. It&#x27;s not quite as sleek as the Flexcare, but given that I never used the advanced features of the Flexcare, I feel like I&#x27;ve made a smarter purchase this time around.  We&#x27;ll see how long it lasts though.</li>
    <li> This was supposed to be an improved model. The toothbrush section is improved because it is not longer open to a space to collect moisture and build up fungus, but the controls are too easily pressed and the function changed in the middle of brushing ones teeth.I would prefer having my old one, but after about 6 years the battery died and could not be replaced. That is another problem that also exisits in this newer one. I would not buy it and would send it back if I could.</li>
    <li> This is the only toothbrush I own. I have owned several through the years. I get the best results at my dentist&lt;br /&gt;from this toothbrush. I can&#x27;t live without it, and my grown children own them as well. It is the BEST toothbrush&lt;br /&gt;on the market.  Can&#x27;t say enough about it. It is pricy but worth every penny. Just hang on to the receipt and if you have&lt;br /&gt;any problems, Sonicare Customer Service is excellent. They are quick to replace your toothbrush if you have any&lt;br /&gt;problems.</li>
    <li> I love how the Philips Sonicare makes my teeth feel, its like I just came from the dentist. My teeth/mouth stays clean all day.</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush.  It is much silent then the Sonicare 2 toothbrush.  It leaves your gums feeling great and healthier</li>
    <li> The product is excellent, once you try it you fell the difference of brushing with regular toothbrush, I simple just love it!</li>
    <li> This is our second Sonicare. The first one was bought about almost 3 years ago and it started to show signs of stress break (this is a common issue found by doing a search on the internet). However, we really enjoyed using it and it cleans our teeth really well. Overall oral health have improved and we even got the kids version for our kids. Would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Been using one for the past 2 years! Needed a refreshed model. Works amazing and makes trips to the dentist a breeze!</li>
    <li> I feel like I had a cleaning at the dentist&#x27;s office. I am never going back to a regular toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter and she says &amp;#34;it changed my life&amp;#34;.  So obviously, she thinks it is a great product.</li>
    <li> This is a replacement for my wife, who has been using one for several years. Is identical to what she has been using.</li>
    <li> I would like to give this an outstanding review. It is comfortably designed, easy to use with automatic timer etc., leaves my mouth feeling clean and fresh, allows my teeth/gums to receive consistently good reviews from my dentist and dental hygienist, retains its charge through the week, and is convenient for travel as well as use at home. The only reservation is that the FlexCare toothbrush I purchased earlier stopped working after only 18 months. I regret its untimely demise. Definitely consider purchasing as it is a very good toothbrush. Just be sure to keep your receipt and warranty in a convenient location.</li>
    <li> This is my second Philips Sonicare Toothbrush, and I just love it. It gets my teeth much cleaner than a manual toothbrush, and the timer keeps me from cheating on the time I spend doing it. My dental checkups are better, too.</li>
    <li> Old sonicare died on me.  This is a more elite model than my previous one.  I actually like it better. The toothbrush head isn&#x27;t as cumbersome and makes it easier to clean.</li>
    <li> Have owned other sonicare tootbrush for about 12 yrs. and this new one performs up to its stated expectations. All pros, no cons about it. I completely recommend this product. Not much more to say.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush cleaned my teeth very well, but only lasted about 2 months before it broke down.  This is the second Sonic toothbrush that only lasted a few months.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000UK2W4C Philips Sonicare FlexCare Rechargeable Sonic Toothbrush with Sanitizer]]&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Sonicare toothbrushs for the last 14 years. I highly recommend them to everyone. I also have the Sanitizer and now wouldn&#x27;t be without one. They are both excellent products and worth every penny. My last one was the Flexcare and I love it.</li>
    <li> I am ok with it as my 6-year old electric toothbrush (Sonicare too) finally gave up on me. I thought the one I just got would be 6 year technologically more advanced: great size indeed, the battery is a good as the old one: excellent duration: over 3 weeks between charges. When I insert the brush head, it doesn&#x27;t go all the way to the bottom, a little gap stays in between it and the brush itself. I hope that&#x27;s a glitch of the brush head and not of the body, otherwise, this will be a lemon.</li>
    <li> I upgraded from an Elite 7300 to this model and I am glad I did.  The slimmer handle takes just a little getting used to if you are used to a bigger handle but I really like the streamlined feel to it.  The toothbrush attachment is so easy to afix to the base and the toothbrush head itself seems to reach much better.  There are several choices for cleaning, including shorter and longer brushing cycles as well as massage and gentle options.  I am experimenting with all of them and the main button is easy to use and it is very simple once you get in the habit to select which option you want.  If you like to stick with the same type of cleaning every day than it will do just that as well. The toothbrush is quieter than my old model and it really feels less abrasive even though it does a great job of cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not buy the model that had the sanitizer because I knew I would never get around to using that part so I did not want to pay for a feature that I most likely would not use. With that said, the charger for just the toothbrush is fairly small and does not require lining up the toothbrush like some previous models.  I am very happy with this toothbrush.</li>
    <li> This is easily the best toothbrush, manual or electric, that I have ever had. My dentist recommends that I brush without toothpaste for better cleaning using the two minute routine.  Then I use the go care (1 min total) setting to bush with toothpaste. My teeth feel fresh and smooth overnight when I brush before bed. I need to follow a routine the next morning or I will forget to brush.  Amazing machine.</li>
    <li> Everyone should use a sonicare...it cleans teeth and gums like nothing else. I will never go back to an ordinary toothbrush.</li>
    <li> The new sonicare toothbrush is very different from my well over 10 year old model.  It works probably better than the older one.  I was surprised that it was not sold with at least one more spare brush.  Anyway, it does what it is supposed to do and seems easy to travel with.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush does an excellent job of teeth cleaning.  However, it continues Phillips tradition of making poorly engineered parts that are non repairable and designed to fall apart so you have to buy new ones frequently.  In my case, this toothbrush failed after about six months.  When I went to take it apart to safely discard the environmentally polluting (read CHEAP) battery per instructions I found the failure was simply a screw falling out of the vibrating mechanism. Per Phillips instructions, the process of taking it apart to repair it or replace a battery is non recoverable (ie destructive).  However, I was able to put the screw back and put it back together with some effort. In summary, using a non changeable poor quality battery and depending upon a screw to hold the vibrating mechanism together is such bad engineering it can&#x27;t be anything but purposefully designed in obsolescence.[[ASIN:B0013TVEWA Philips Sonicare FlexCare Rechargeable Sonic Toothbrush]][[ASIN:B000UK2W4C Philips Sonicare FlexCare Rechargeable Sonic Toothbrush with Sanitizer]]</li>
    <li> My daughter gave me a Sonicare toothbrush 8 years ago that I used until I \\&quot;traded it in\\&quot; for a newer model. The brush handle is slimmer, the recharger less bulky, the toothbrush head formed for easier manipulation on those back molars. The Sonicare brushes are essential to my good oral health.  I appreciate the FlexCare options of the brush and use the different modes for different needs .  Good choice for me to upgrade.</li>
    <li> To give you some context, I&#x27;ve owned two Sonicare toothbrushes and four Oral-B toothbrushes over the last 17 years, including the ever popular 3D/8850 and the \\&quot;Triumph\\&quot; 4000/5000/9000 (whatever number they&#x27;ve decided to use this year).  I have never used the Oral-B sonic brush, mostly because it has mediocre reviews and requires different brush-heads anyway.  If I&#x27;m going to invest in all new equipment, I might as well buy the one with 4.5 stars...  I have found this particular Sonicare to be the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used, and not necessarily for the reasons you might expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, what attracted me to Oral-B in the first place: it does a good job cleaning teeth and the standard brush-head is a very small, circular brush.  I always found the enlarged brush-heads or cross-action brush-heads too gimicky, uncomfortable, and less effective.  I would usually get 10 days to a charge, most brushes came with hard PLASTIC travel cases, which prevented them from being switched on inadvertently and discharging during the outbound flight of your vacation/business trip.  In short, after 17 years of using several Oral-B brushes, I would consider myself a loyal customer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons of the last couple of Oral-B brushes can be found in the reviews I&#x27;ve written on the relevant pages, although it&#x27;s hard to keep up since they keep switching model numbers to confuse the customer.  Basically, there are three types still available: a very basic version that has the oldest style of charge and a chunky handle, a newer version with 40,000 revolutions per minute AND 3D back-and-forth motion (oscillation) AND the \\&quot;Triumph,\\&quot; which has the same specifications but an even chunkier handle to accommodate the LCD display.  Either of the latter two are fine, although the charging circuit for my Triumph failed after barely a year, which is what made my mind up to switch to Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros of the Sonicare are manifold: it&#x27;s smaller, lighter, quieter, simpler, can be had with \\&quot;compact\\&quot; or regular brush heads.  The best feature for me is that it holds a charge for two full weeks, even though it&#x27;s so much lighter.  The weight may seem insignificant, but it all adds up when you travel on a daily basis.  Then there&#x27;s the results: my teeth are definitely cleaner.  That absolutely surprised me, given how gung-ho I&#x27;ve been about Oral-B all these years.  My teeth are smoother, whiter, and I&#x27;ve noticed that the red wine stains that usually affect my teeth between dental cleanings have disappeared, without the need for a dental cleaning.  Is the difference huge?  No, but it is noticeable, and it was a pleasant surprise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought the Sonicare and Oral-B would be very similar user experiences: both brushes have the little cut-outs every 30 seconds to remind you to change the set of teeth that you&#x27;re currently brushing.  It&#x27;s not too intrusive and I&#x27;ve always liked it.  This Sonicare completely cuts out after 2 minutes, unless you press the little button in advance to give you 3 minutes or 1 minute.  I don&#x27;t mind, since 2 minutes is all I ever shoot for (and you can always turn it right back on if you really need to).  The battery indicator has 3 little levels, similar to the Triumph.  So, objectively, they both clean teeth and have almost identical bells and whistles.  Subjectively, they feel very different (different brushing motions) and have different results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why not 5 stars?  Well, this particular model came with a soft cloth travel case, which I fear will lead to discharging (first trip with it is scheduled for next week - I&#x27;ll be bringing the included compact charger with me).  Also, I can&#x27;t get to the very back of my teeth quite as easily as I could with the small circular Oral-B brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To Oral-B, I would say you just lost a customer because you couldn&#x27;t be bothered to update your brushes with Lithium Ion batteries.  To everyone else, I&#x27;d say if you&#x27;re choosing between the two, the latest Sonicare brushes beat Oral-B on every dimension..</li>
    <li> works mechanically great,  but the brushes are very stiff and even when you buy &amp;#34;their&amp;#34; soft ones,  they are still too stiff for sensitive gums.</li>
    <li> I got this toothbrush right at a year ago when I learned that excessive crunching and sawing with my manual toothbrush had resulted in my need for a $1,100 torture procedure a.k.a a gum graft.  My new periodontist swore by the Philips and said that he&#x27;d been using one for 15 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I bought the FlexCare because I liked the idea of the sensitive setting.  At first everything went well. Then, I too, encountered the vibrating brush head that wobbles off when I first changed to a new brush head.  I thought the head was defective, like many other people, and went through a couple packs of expensive heads before getting a pack that seemed to stay on properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then about 2 weeks ago, out of the blue the brush began to turn itself on!  This happened in the middle of the night two different times.  Talk about a way to be woken up in the night!  This thing just going off, rattling across the bathroom counter.  We&#x27;d press the off button and sometimes it would stay off and other times it&#x27;d cut back on 10-15 minutes later.  I left it off the charger so that the battery would run down all the way.  Once that happened, it would not re-charge.  If I put it on the charger, I can hear a slight humming noise and see what looks like little sparks behind where the green light should be glowing.  My husband told me to take it off the charger before I set the bathroom on fire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also agree the the control buttons are poorly located. I was forever hitting one while in the middle of brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, now I don&#x27;t know what to do.  All the reviews about Customer Service make me not-so-excited to try to send it back.  On the flip side, I was told that the use of the brush was helping my gums and if I kept it up, hopefully I would never need another graft (the most painful thing EVER)</li>
    <li> If it wasn&#x27;t for the fact that the shaft broke with even the smallest of drops, I would give this product five stars.  Some might think that isn&#x27;t fair, but at $120+, and no warning label of its&#x27; fragile shaft, it deserves one star.  Go with the Oral-B brushes with a floss action head- comparable clean, without the egg shell shaft.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is too complicated. it&#x27;s as if Sonicare was trying too hard to add features that the toothbrush simply doesn&#x27;t need.  I&#x27;m  actually considering going back to my previous Sonicare Elite.  If you have to read the instruction manual more than once (or even at all) I say it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
    <li> For a long time, I was hesitant to shell out the $100+ to invest in an electric toothbrush, but after some heavy pressure from my dentist, I decided to buy this one. I&#x27;m completely glad I did. I&#x27;ve been using it for about two months now, it&#x27;s been at least 3 months since my last cleaning, and my teeth still feel like I&#x27;d had them cleaned yesterday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive teeth, and the standard mode is a little too intense for my teeth to use regularly, so I use the sensitive mode. I haven&#x27;t had any problems or discomfort with that, and as I said, my teeth feel amazingly clean, so I don&#x27;t think the performance suffers at all from using a less-intense brushing mode.</li>
    <li> I bought this toothbrush as a replacement for the last Sonicare toothbrush that I left behind in a hotel room. I&#x27;ve been using this product for over two years and I love it. It has several options for different cleanings, even a sensitive setting, and it is easy to use. It is timed for two minutes so you get a full brushing. It even has a setting for a quick brushing that lasts for one minute instead of the usual two minutes. It has a nice little interrupting vibration to let you know when to switch quadrants of your mouth. Using this toothbrush leaves your teeth with the same feeling as having your dentist performing a cleaning. It will take a little getting used to at first, but it is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery stays charged for weeks and the travel charger is pretty compact. The full charging takes about 12-15 hours. The battery indicator is pretty accurate and will let you know when you need to charge it. Even on the lowest level and it turning orange, I still get another 2-3 days of brushing out of it. The replacement brushes run about $20 for three. But those can last 2-3 months each.</li>
    <li> I had a two year old Sonicare that I fried when I took it to Europe.  I am so glad the new Sonicare handles both currents now without a transformer.  I really like the new design.  I feel my teeth get cleaner because I can reach all my teeth better, plus I feel it vibrates more for a better clean. It is also much easier to keep clean.</li>
    <li> I bought this same tooth brush from Amazon back in 2009 in a set for my wife &amp; Myself which is the Flexcare Deluxe Edition set,  it comes with 2 of the RS 950 body&#x27;s 4 brush heads two chargers and one ultraviolet head cleaner which is a great deal. This system really gets your teeth super clean. One word of warning, If you constantly remove the brush head from the body everyday to place it in the ultraviolet cleaner the tip on the main body where the brush head attaches will loosen and pull out of its socket and render it useless, which is what happen to my wife&#x27;s (After 3 Years Of Use) the other day which is why I just ordered this replacement. I use the travel charger and only remove the brush head when it needs replacing and clean it by turning it on and running it under running water. We love our Sonicares and I would another for myself tomorrow if mine broke.</li>
    <li> The new Flexcare Sonicare toothbrush is comfortable to use and does a better job cleaning my teeth than my older model. The timer insures that I brush for the correct amount of time, but I also like the Gocare timer that is shorter for those hurried times. The battery lasts a long time before needing recharging so I don&#x27;t need to carry the charger for shorter vacations. I would definitlely recommend it.</li>
    <li> The old sonicare toothbrush works like brand new.  Would not buy a new style one ever again.  I bought 4 of them from Costco not a one of them will last very long on a charge.  Next time going to buy Oral-B.  Should of kept all the old ones.  Does Sonicare have people write reviews for them?  There is no way we just got a bad bunch.  They were bought a few months apart and they all did the same thing. I would of never bought the second set if I had read the reviews.</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush. This is my first electric toothbrush investment and I refuse to ever go back to using a regular toothbrush. Once you use it you can feel the difference in how clean your teeth feels immediately. I would recommend this product to everyone. As an added bonus it stays charged for a good amount of time so you don&#x27;t have to keep it on the charging base if you don&#x27;t want to.</li>
    <li> I loved this toothbrush so much for the two years that it worked. It was my first electric toothbrush and it changed everything about my dental health. Unfortunately it died (or actually the opposite, it started turning on at random hours of the day and night unprovoked) just days after the two year warranty ran out. While the customer service department was perfectly nice about it, they were not willing to budge on the strict two year warranty and I am out of luck.</li>
    <li> I was really happy with this tooth brush and I also used their older model. I like this improved model better because has a signal for when you need to switch teeth sides and power holds on for much longer.&lt;br /&gt;I could never go to a regular toothbrush again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complain was that after almost two years, the power button stopped working and toothbrush turned on randomly. It was 3 weekes before going out of warranty so I talked with Customer Service and they sent me a new one. They were really helpful and got the replacement within a week!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a Sonicare toothbrush for several years. That one finally died (the battery wouldn&#x27;t keep a charge). I like this new one and the new features that it has that my old one didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> This is my second Sonicare toothbrush and 2 different dentists have said my teeth and gums are amazing.  The hygenists say I don&#x27;t leave anything for them to do.  I have a permanent lower retainer and it is spotless.  Many of my friends and family use it on my recommendation.  I like this model because the brush heads are smaller so less landfill.</li>
    <li> Prior to buying this toothbrush I had used the battery-powered Crest SpinBrush for several years, and while it cleaned my teeth much better than a manual brush, I was always frustrated with its bulky brush head (I have a small mouth) and grew tired of the ebb-and-flow of the batteries: working great at full power and pitifully weak towards the end of their life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter the Sonicare FlexCare toothbrush, with its small brush head and built in rechargeable battery. At first, the sonic vibration took some getting used to, and I had to learn to turn it off before removing it from my mouth to avoid getting spray everywhere. The only thing that still bothers me is the buzz I get if the plastic part of the head touches my teeth (I try to avoid it, but it still happens from time to time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the performance, it cleans wonderfully and in less time that the SpinBrush did, and it&#x27;s easier to reach my back molars with the small brush head. I don&#x27;t use the timers or brushing routines (the timer alarm was easy enough to turn off, but the brush still automatically turns off after two minutes, which is mildly annoying), however, I do occasionally use the &#x27;Massage&#x27; setting. I love the fact that the Sonicare retains the same level of power, even when the battery is only at 25%, and it&#x27;s ultra-easy to charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with the Sonicare, and highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This is a great toothbrush. This is my third Sonicare purchase in 8 years and I can&#x27;t imagine using anything else!</li>
    <li> Much better than the previous version.  It is really nice that the batteries can be replaced.  I also like the smaller, pop-off brush head.  Eliminates saliva and gunk from accumulating in the screw top.  It keeps the unit as a whole cleaner.  The smaller charger and travel case are much easier to pack for trips as well.  The unique charger design that allows the cord to be stored inside is a very nice touch.  The additional brush modes are nice to have, although I don&#x27;t really ever see a use for the \\&quot;massage\\&quot; mode.  The quick clean is nice when you don&#x27;t have time for the full 2 minute brush cycle.</li>
    <li> This was recommended to my daughter by her orthodontist.  It has worked very well for her in keeping her teeth really clean and healthy with having braces on.  There is even a massaging mode to stimulate the area around the gum where it is difficult to clean if you have brackets on your molars. Good luck and happy brushing!</li>
    <li> I was forced to purchase a new Sonicare toothbrush after my previous one died. I was going to look around for a different brand since I was kind of upset it died 30 days after my warranty ended, but immediately found that I am way too attached to my Sonicare. I looked around and found this one on Amazon (after a lot of searching) and have to say that it was a GREAT buy! The issues that I found in my previous Sonicare were fixed in this version (including the use of magnets which made a mess inside the brush head&#x27;s base). I swear by Sonicare toothbrushes and I honestly feel naked without it. My teeth feel unbelievably clean! A very worthwhile purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update (10/27/13): It&#x27;s been over 3 years since I have purchased this and it&#x27;s still going strong! Just make sure that you *DO NOT* leave this thing on the charger at all times and you shouldn&#x27;t have any problems with the internal battery. I only charge mine when it is blinking yellow (telling me to charge it), and the battery still lasts between 1.5 and 2 weeks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update (5/30/14): Still going strong! The battery still lasts about 1 1/2 - 2 weeks before needing to charge it overnight. As stated in my previous update, only charge it when it blinks yellow and the battery should last a long time.</li>
    <li> Prior to acquiring this model, I had over a year&#x27;s experience with the Philips Sonicare Elite toothbrush, which I was using on my dentist&#x27;s recommendation (and, frankly, after a fair amount of dental work). I needed something that would provide good brushing and I found the basic principles of the Sonicare system to be helpful, so I understood the system and what it could do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This FlexCare model, however, is a big step up over the Elite series. This is less cumbersome and has some very useful (and easy) choices in modes of operation: it even has a \\&quot;Go Care\\&quot; 1-minute quickie routine if you&#x27;re pressed for time. The charger, if reduced to its travel mode, is very small and it, and the brush/handle assembly, are very compact, much more so than the Elite. The \\&quot;beep\\&quot; that signals the time the user spends on each quadrant of his/her teeth is clever and means you will be spending the right amount of time on your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush is cheaper to replace, is a lot simpler (the Elite toothbrush includes much of the mechanism) and, if more than one person uses Sonicare, means that you need have only one handle, a considerable savings as we&#x27;ve found the older Elite really needs one handle per user because of the clunky nature of the screw-on toothbrush. The FlexCare toothbrush is much smaller, has a nice series of colored rubber gaskets to distinguish one from another, and snaps on and off easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One point to stress that the manual does not: the Sonicare system really does need a light touch on the handle -- like holding a flute -- to save wear on the brushes. And a light touch is all that&#x27;s needed, a lot better than using a manual toothbrush with too much force. Given the fact that dental work is costly, this toothbrush may save far more than you&#x27;d think. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d used Sonicare products in the past at the advice of pretty much every dentist who ever looked at my bad gums. My old Sonicare would no longer take a charge (little did I know that the battery could be replaced), and I tossed it. Fast forward to a few months back when my hygienist recommended this new and improved Sonicare to me (at which point I found out about the old battery in my previous one). I bought it right there at the dentist office, started using it, and when I went back 3 months later, my gums were noticeably in much better shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to use, effective, makes my teeth feel super clean, is idiot proof for proper dental and gum care, and I have no complaints aside from cost and then the cost of replacement heads (though the 3 pack for $25 here on Amazon is a better deal than I&#x27;ve seen in stores). My gums are worth it.</li>
    <li> After seeing some of the preliminary reviews, I was excited to try this.  I had an electronic toothbrush, probably about 10 years ago, and I stopped using it for some reason I can&#x27;t remember.  I think that was a Braun.  Since then, I&#x27;ve bought a couple of Crest spin brushes.  I used to think they were all pretty much the same, but the Sonicare is in a whole different league.  Besides the superior cleaning you get with the sonic action, my favorite parts are the timer that tells you how long to brush in one area and the different modes.  I like the massage mode but will use the clean mode for daily use.  Since I hadn&#x27;t used an electric toothbrush for a while, I used the Easy Start mode, and that was nice, but I think most people can probably handle jumping right in to clean mode.  I also find the brush to be comfortable in my hand.  This product is highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I have owned the 2 prior models of this brush. Although not all of the updates are great, most of them are. No more obnoxious gunk between the brush head and the handle! The charger is better designed and easier to keep clean. The battery seems to last forever, even when the indicator lights claim there isn&#x27;t much power left. Most importantly, the brush leaves you with a cleaner and cleaner feeling mouth and than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no regrets upgrading to this brush from the Sonicare Elite. It is arguably the best consumer dental hygiene product available. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love this new brush, cleans very well. however i only paid 119.00 for mine at the dentist office and it came with 2 brush heads compared to the one at amazon</li>
    <li> Lightweight, small, easy to use, recharges quickly, I like the \\&quot;massage\\&quot; feature, it feels quite different from the normal vibration. My teeth feel smooth and clean when I&#x27;m finished. I believe it is far superior to my previous rotating head toothbrush. I also like the fact that if you accidently hit the On/Off switch in the middle of a brushing sequence, when you press the switch again, it will continue from where you were in the brush cycle rather than restarting from the beginning of the cycle. Pricey, but worth it in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I upgraded from an Oral-B.  Several friends recommended Sonicare, so I gave it a try.  This model is definitely much slimmer and quieter than the Elite series, which was selling point for me.  The extra brushing modes are extras, and really weren&#x27;t that important.  I&#x27;m hoping it lives up to the marketing and that my next visit to the dentist is much shorter!  I did a full charge up and down on the battery, and so far it lasts more than a week between charging...good news for vacation!</li>
    <li> im sure its great BUT i cant even get the brush head to stay attached. it keeps falling off every time i use it and doesnt &#x27;click in&#x27; at all.&lt;br /&gt;customer service was no help. i think the product is faulty and i will be returning it for a new one. ill try it again i guess.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Sonicare at my dentist&#x27;s recommendation since they first came out.  Spending the extra money on the Flexcare was well worth the investment.  I especially like the smaller brush head and the additional timing features.</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd Sonicare toothbrush, and I&#x27;ve been a big fan so far.  I bought this one because my existing model had the problem with stuff building up inside the brush head and it was very hard to clean out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with all the positive reviews as far as the improved design, lighter weight, more options, and it&#x27;s much easier to keep clean than the previous model.  However, the metal shaft on mine came loose within a few months and got so bad that I finally called Norelco for service.  I gave them the model number and serial number and they immediately offered to send a free replacement, with a postage-free box in which to return my broken one.  That was over two weeks ago, and it hasn&#x27;t arrived yet.  I phoned back a couple days ago and was told it was on back-order and should arrive within a few more days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The service representative was friendly and I didn&#x27;t have to wait long on the phone, but I have noticed that several other reviewers here on Amazon have had the same problem I have had.  I&#x27;m wondering how long my replacement will last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, when it worked, it was excellent, but it should not have broken so fast and the replacement shouldn&#x27;t take so long to be shipped from Norelco.  Meanwhile, I&#x27;m using my old model which I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t throw away.  It still works fine after more than two years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit, one week later: I just phoned the company again because after 3 weeks, I have still not received my replacement.  I was told that the toothbrush is still on back-order and mine hasn&#x27;t been shipped yet.  They have no idea how long it will be, though they agreed that it shouldn&#x27;t take as long as it has.  I was also told that this model has had issues with the metal shaft \\&quot;dislodging\\&quot;, which is what mine did.  So, be warned that there is a known issue, and that in spite of the warranty, you may end up waiting a while for your replacement if you get a bad one.  In Norelco&#x27;s favor, all of the phone representatives I&#x27;ve spoken with have been polite and helpful, but unfortunately, there&#x27;s nothing they can do to speed up the process.  I&#x27;m not ready to say I&#x27;d never buy another Sonicare, but I will certainly look at the competition when I get my next toothbrush.  This is just bad PR and bad product support from Norelco, which amounts to very bad business practice, especially during a recession. Are there really that many people shelling out $130+ for a toothbrush right now?helpful, but unfortunately, there&#x27;s nothing they can do to speed up the process.

    <li> 1. I have used sonicare for awhile and will continue&lt;br /&gt;2. Their quality has begun to slip.  I was given 2 flexcare as gifts and both don&#x27;t charge anymore. Probably used them for a year.  Don&#x27;t have the receipt and good luck getting sonicare to replace it even if you have the product in hand.&lt;br /&gt;3. Unfortunately I have a bunch of heads so I opted to replace it with the healthywhite and if that thing goes then sonicare is out.&lt;br /&gt;4. Quality matters&lt;br /&gt;5. Go with the cheapest as you really don&#x27;t need the silly features they are trying to add to this product.&lt;br /&gt;6. It needs to work, it needs to charge, and it needs to do this for a minimum of 3 years without fail.</li>
    <li> Unbelievable quality and precision toothbrush.  You only think you are bushing your teeth with anything else.</li>
    <li> I had the Oral-B prior to buying this product, and if you&#x27;re choosing between them, don&#x27;t hesitate a moment to purchase the Phillips Sonicare instead.  It&#x27;s far superior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Oral-B has a small round rotating brush.  It&#x27;s hard to get enough toothpaste on the brush, it doesn&#x27;t rotate very fast, and it has a mechanical head, which means that water and gunk can make it&#x27;s way into the body of the toothbrush.  I actually went back to a regular brush and threw out the Oral-B.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sonicare however (this product,) is the best toothbrush bar none that I&#x27;ve ever owned.  The charger doesn&#x27;t get dirty because it charges inductively, so there are no electric contacts to get dirty, and the brush head vibrates magnetically with no mechanical connection, so gunk doesn&#x27;t get into the body of the Sonicare.  To clean it you just pop the brush head off and rinse.  Both ends of the Sonicare are sealed.  Brilliant!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other things I like about the Sonicare are that you can set it at two speeds, the brush head is small so it&#x27;s easy to brush my wisdom teeth without gagging, and the head vibrates very fast, unlike the Oral-B.  It runs a very long time on a charge, too, so if you&#x27;re going on a two week trip you won&#x27;t have to bother bringing the charger.  It will probably last a month on a charge, in fact.  But it&#x27;s best not to discharge a rechargeable battery too deeply, for long life.  Especially because the battery is sealed inside the body.  It also has a charge indicator, so I recharge it after it&#x27;s gone down one bar on the indicator.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using electric toothbrushes for more than a decade and finally found the one I like.  I started with the round heads from OralB and they were ok, but then the sonicare technology picked my curiosity.&lt;br /&gt;The price for Sonicare was ridiculous (still is) but eventually I found a justification to get it. Loved the actual brushing but I didn&#x27;t get this model, nooooo  back then the best I could get was one of the Essence model. Why?, why do these people have the brains to create a magnificent tool that cuts the cleaning at the dentist chair in more than 60% but make that ridiculous brush head. The head on the \\&quot;Essence\\&quot; model is an invitation for germs and cruddiness.&lt;br /&gt;OralB has a nice, easy to keep clean brush head, why re-invent the wheel?. Fortunately Sonicare saw the light and came out with this FlexCare model that (similar to OralB)allows the user to keep the underside of the brush heads clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush work great. Brushing the same times a day I used to with other brushes my cleanings at the dentist are no longer a nightmare. I sit, they look all over and just compliment me on the lack of tar or any build up, the process takes about the same it takes the strong cycle on my regular morning brush.</li>
    <li> Love this toothbrush - really does the job. I found it at the best price at Amazon as well.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how wonderful a toothbrush can be!  My teeth feel like I just went to the dentist every night and every morning!  The tarter that is so hard to remove, even by a dentist, is now removed!  Teeth that were stained and yellow are now white!  I just can&#x27;t believe what this toothbrush can do.  I have used a Crest electric toothbrush for years.  I wish I would have known about this Sonicare a lot sooner.  Yes, it is expensive.  But, it is well worth the money I spent!  If you are undecided about spending this much money on a toothbrush, think again.  Just do it and you will be glad you did!</li>
    <li> I read over many of the reviews for both this version of the Sonicare, as well as the version that comes with the UV sanitizer.. My hygienist strongly recommend either the FlexCare or an Oral-B Complete.. Most helpful with this recommendation was the fact that my dentist&#x27;s office does not sell any of these products, so I felt I was getting an unbiased recommendation.  Unfortunately for me, that left me to deciding between the two.  I opted for the Sonicare, since I have had two Oral-B products in the past, and neither one impressed me.  Also, I decided for the version without the UV sanitizer.  The specific model I purchased was the FlexCare+ HX6922/03, which I believe is the most current version of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush does a fantastic job of cleaning your teeth.  After you are done, your teeth really do feel much cleaner, and the Sonicare does a very thorough job.  One thing I should note -- I did not purchase mine from Amazon -- instead, I went with a discount online toothbrush retailer, which sold it for $95.  Therefore, the contents of my box may differ from what is offered here...The model I purchased  says &#x27;Professional&#x27; at the bottom of the box, and from what I understand, this may be the version that is sold in dental offices.  It comes with the toothbrush, 2 ProResults brush heads (1 compact &amp; 1 standard), 1 Deluxe charger with cord wrap and brush head storage, 2 travel caps, and 1 hard travel case.  Additionally, the model I purchased has 5 cleaning modes:  Clean (standard 2 minute clean), Gum Care (2 minute clean, followed by 1 minute for getting back to problem areas), Refresh (1 minute &#x27;quick&#x27; clean), Sensitive (2 minutes, reduced speed for sensitive teeth/gums), and Massage (for stimulating gums).  I use the &#x27;Clean&#x27; mode exclusively, and it works quite well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have mentioned, it is important that you do not power on the toothbrush until it is in your mouth.  Failing to do so will result in toothpaste all over.  BUT, if youve used electric toothbrushes before, you should already know this.. Also, don&#x27;t remove it from your mouth while its on, or you&#x27;ll experience the same issue.  One of the things that bothers me slightly is that occasionally I will hit the shaft of the brush head against one of my teeth, and its not the most pleasant experience -- it doesnt hurt, its just annoying when it happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to post this review to bring up two things that have been mentioned in many of the reviews I have read that Philips seems to have fixed:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Changing the mode while brushing -- many people posted that it was possible (and very easy) to inadvertently change the mode while brushing due to the fact that the mode button is right near where your hand would be holding the brush.  On the model that I purchased, you cannot change the mode while the brush is on -- you must power it off first, fixing that first problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Remembering the previous mode used -- while I use the &#x27;Clean&#x27; mode exclusively, other reviewers complained that the unit should remember the last mode used.  Some people prefer to use the &#x27;Sensitive&#x27; mode all the time, and found it annoying to have to change to their preferred mode everytime they used the toothbrush.

Also, don&#x27;t remove it from your mouth while its on, or you&#x27;ll experience the same issue.  One of the things that bothers me slightly is that occasionally I will hit the shaft of the brush head against one of my teeth, and its not the most pleasant experience -- it doesnt hurt, its just annoying when it happens.

    <li> OK, so I&#x27;ve never written an Amazon review before, but I really just had to write one for this amazing little device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a big tooth-brusher, I must admit - I tend to procrastinate more than I should, but I am LOVING this new FlexCare toothbrush. It&#x27;s so fun and easy to use, I&#x27;m finding I want to brush my teeth 3 or 4 times a day (but restraining myself)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really not even like brushing - it just seems to blast the dirt off my teeth. I honestly believe they&#x27;re already whiter after just two days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The timer is awesome - 2 minutes broken into 4 30-second quadrants - and really appeals to my engineering mind, since I know exactly how long each session will last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really don&#x27;t think the brush needs all those complicated modes - just my own opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve recently begun purchasing very high quality items that will (hopefully) last a long time, work great, and just make me feel like the wealthiest guy in the world. I started with cooking equipment (butcher knife, bamboo cutting board), and now count this toothbrush as one of those purchases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A $125 toothbrush?!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, it&#x27;s close to if not the best toothbrush you can buy - you and your dentist will be amazed at the results.</li>
    <li> This product is the best electric toothbrush on the market.  You never realize how long it takes to brush your teeth properly until you have the timed toothbrush that is counting on you to brush for 2 minutes.  It is easy to use (once you get used to the rapid brushing action) and easy to clean.  Your mouth is fresh and your teeth will be shining!</li>
    <li> I would buy this product again any day.  I have owned the oral B and this product is definitely superior.  Sonicare is the best on the market.</li>
    <li> A friend convinced me to try an electric toothbrush insisting that I would fall instantly in love with it.  Unfortunately that wasn&#x27;t the case.  The toothbrush is great and I&#x27;ve had no problems with it but it takes some getting used to if you&#x27;ve never used one before.  You have to be more aware of how you&#x27;re brushing and what you&#x27;re doing.  I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I&#x27;ve taken the toothbrush out of my mouth while brushing to either spit or get a better angle and the next thing you know toothpaste is spattered all over your bathroom mirror because it vibrates like crazy.  It was funny the first couple of times but it just got annoying.  Now that I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks and I&#x27;ve adapted to the quirks I actually enjoy it.  My mouth and teeth definitely do feel cleaner and more fresh using this brush, especially if you try to go back to old school brushing after using it consistently even just a few days.  My favorite feature is the timer that lets you know when to change brushing areas.  I haven&#x27;t really used many of the other features like the gum massage setting because it kinda creeps me out a little.  Anyway long story short... or long... it took me awhile to adjust to the new brush but now I find myself not wanting to be without it.</li>
    <li> Nice unit, works great. The only con is it is very easy to hit the function button while in use causing the output to change.</li>
    <li> Best toothbrush we have ever owned.  Various speed settings change the time and degree of cleaning.  Easy cleanup, and brush seem to last without showing wear.  Nice stand and brush holder, but wish there was a third for my son.  I am glad I chose not to spend extra on the ultrasonic cleaner after reading other reviews.  Highly recommended.[[ASIN:B0013TVEWA Philips Sonicare FlexCare Rechargeable Sonic Toothbrush]]</li>
    <li> This is the first sonic toothbrush I&#x27;ve owned and used.  I&#x27;m loving it and would recommend to anyone.  No issues or durability concerns.</li>
    <li> I tried the oral b triumph before, I didn&#x27;t like the small head. I switched off to a manual toothbrush, bad idea, even though I didn&#x27;t think I was brushing too hard, I ended up causing a lot of gum recession. Now I have the flex care. I get great results and I don&#x27;t rip up my gums in the process.</li>
    <li> Excellent toothbrush which really cleans at the gum line as well&lt;br /&gt;as tooth surfaces.  Had been using a WaterPik, which I thought was&lt;br /&gt;doing a good job until discovering it doesn&#x27;t diminish plaque as&lt;br /&gt;well as the Sonicare.  FAST shipping from this seller, also.</li>
    <li> This is a great toothbrush--worth the difference in price to have a product that works so well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Sonicare Elite for years but when my third one quit recently I replaced it with the FlexCare. It is a much improved version of the Elite.&lt;br /&gt;-The slender design makes it more comfortable to hold.&lt;br /&gt;-The way the brush snaps into the handle is great. Fluids do not remain inside the brush housing, causing a buildup of gunk and bacteria. You don&#x27;t have to unscrew the brush every time it&#x27;s used to prevent that.&lt;br /&gt;-I like the options for the different cleaning speeds and timing.&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s a great product and I strongly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This new model works much better than the older Sonicare model. Smaller to hold and travel with, easier to keep  toothbrush head clean (gunk doesn&#x27;t build up), has different mode cleanings (one for a quick brush when i&#x27;m running late for work and another mode that&#x27;s longer and also lower setting that massages gums), quadrant beep so you know when to switch sections on your teeth. Overall this product is great and I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase. I highly recommend this model!!!</li>
    <li> This is the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever owned, but I&#x27;ve come from a long line of cheap 15 dollar ones.  The 30-second interval is quite helpful to me, to make sure I get every inch of my mouth sparkling clean.  And when I say clean, I mean it!  This toothbrush has your mouth feeling even better than if you just came from the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also keeping clean very easily, the way the brush head comes off makes sure that no gunk can get inside - which is a good thing because the brush is seemingly sealed shut from prying screwdrivers.  The downside to this is that the battery is not replaceable.</li>
    <li> the first one we had lasted two years and had an excellent impact on my oral health (mainly health of gums).  When it stopped working (motor &amp; battery fine, transmission broke) it took several months before we replaced it and i noticed a steady decline in oral health. Product is simple to use, simple to maintain, and a key element to long term overall health.  More overall body ailments (and severity of) are being linked to proper oral health which this product helps to provide.  i sound like a dentist which i&#x27;m not but protect your health by protecting your mouth--pony up for the $100+ toothbrush, it&#x27;s worth it.  (oh ya, and it&#x27;ll only take a week to get used to the bristle movement but you will)</li>
    <li> No problems with the product at all. The price does seem a bit high tho, the reason for docking it one star. I particularly like the slimmer design over the older model, and the new snap on brush attachment is a HUGE improvement over the old style screw-on connection.</li>
    <li> Only reason I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that I wish it beeped a 5 second warning before it shut off, but other than that little thing, I really like this product!  This is the first electric toothbrush I have ever used and I don&#x27;t think I would switch to another brand!  Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> After years of using Sonicare, I upgraded from the Elite to the FlexCare.  In my opinion, it has more brushing power and no cleaning maintenance than the Elite.  With FlexCare you don&#x27;t have to remove the brush head to clean it where water leaks inside.  They can die on me sometimes and I have to rebuy one.  Im on my second FlexCare in 2 years, but my boyfriend&#x27;s first one still works.</li>
    <li> I have been using an older Sonicare for many years and loved it.  This new one is even better; my teeth feel very clean and gums feel great as well.</li>
    <li> Wow...What a great toothbrush. Love the 2 minute timer. The charge lasts 2-3 weeks.  I will never go back to a manual toothbrush again. That just cleaned feeling lasts all day!!  The last time I went to the dentist he remarked how healthy  my teeth and gums looked and wondered what I was doing differently.</li>
    <li> We have used the various versions of Sonicare for perhaps 15 years. This one does a good job, but we had one brush (so far) that would not stay on the motor. We phoned Sonicare and they sent us two more. So all is well as long as it is not a common problem.</li>
    <li> My wife and I have been using this toothbrush for years, and we both love it. So much so, we now each have our own so we don&#x27;t have to keep swapping brush heads. The various modes are great and well thought-out, and the massage is nice from time to time. The hygienist approves of the work it&#x27;s doing, so that&#x27;s a Good Thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After several years, our original one finally died -- and a replacement was next-day shipped from Amazon without hesitation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GET IT!</li>
    <li> Love it so much! Makes my mouth so fresh and so clean!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m off Philips Sonicare for life.  While the device works well for a while, it&#x27;s extremely poor quality.  My first lasted about two years.  The second about a year.  The third perhaps 8 months.  Manner of death was the same each time, which indicates a serious design weakness or manufacturing problem.  Ordering a Braun today to try as an alternative.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended this toothbrush so I purchased it about a year ago. So far I&#x27;ve had no problems with the day to day functionality of the toothbrush, and I like that it has several brushing cycles to choose from. I especially like the \\&quot;Go Care\\&quot; brushing cycle for mornings or for when I&#x27;m short on time. Though the length of this cycle is shorter, it still leaves my teeth feeling really clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I&#x27;m not giving the toothbrush 5 stars is because, although it&#x27;s slim, easy to hold, and easy to brush with, the placement of the main control button on the brush could be better. The button is unfortunately located right where you tend to hold the brush when brushing your teeth, so I have occasionally accidentally turned the brush off mid-cycle. Phillips must have anticipated this tendency because if you accidentally turn the brush off mid-cycle and then you immediately turn the brush back on, the brushing cycle picks up right where it left off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush comes with a pedestal (which is also the charger)and two pegs to hold extra toothbrush heads. I have found that unless you completely dry off your toothbrush, a ring will form on the pedestal in the spot where your toothbrush sits. I&#x27;ve also noticed that grime can accumulate in the crease of the rubber base of the toothbrush. I&#x27;m kind of a neat freak so this annoys me, but it&#x27;s pretty minimal and you may not even notice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the Sonicare FlexCare is an efficient and effective toothbrush that keeps my teeth squeaky clean.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended the Sonicare Flexcare.  Pricey - but worth it.  I like how it feels and it seems to clean better. Will found out at my next appointment!  Has a charger that converts to a travel charger as well.  Nice design with choice of functions.</li>
    <li> My dentist told me I was brushing too hard and I should think about getting a toothbrush with a clutch.  The first time I used this I felt like I had brushed my teeth for the first time.  My dentist visits have been great ever since.</li>
    <li> You can polish your teeth rather than just brushing with this device.&lt;br /&gt;Since the brush rattles, touching the brush to your teeth may cause noises.&lt;br /&gt;Now, I use only two minutes for my teeth (exactly two minutes) after having this device.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for an excellent electric toothbrush that will make your dental hygienist happy....look no further. This is it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This \\&quot;kit\\&quot; contains:&lt;br /&gt;1 Sonicare Flexcare rechargeable toothbrush handle which is the \\&quot;business\\&quot; part of the tooth brush.&lt;br /&gt;1 ProResults brush head that fits on to the handle. This brush should be replaced every three or so months.&lt;br /&gt;1 Smallish (3.5\\&quot; x 3\\&quot;) multi-voltage \\&quot;deluxe\\&quot; travel charger with \\&quot;cord wrap\\&quot; and \\&quot;brush head storage\\&quot; (two tiny pins on the back hold extra brushes, should you have them...yippee!)&lt;br /&gt;1 \\&quot;Hygienic travel cap\\&quot; which is a clear plastic \\&quot;dust\\&quot; cap that fits over the brush when not in use.&lt;br /&gt;1 \\&quot;Luxury soft travel case\\&quot; which is a cheap plastic fold over case with a \\&quot;Phillips\\&quot; label on the front. This case will only hold the toothbrush, not the charger so if you are taking a trip the poor little multi-voltage charger goes without it&#x27;s own case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sonicare makes several toothbrush models. FlexCare is a good choice because it allows the user to select three brushing modes: regular, sensitive, or massage. These three modes operate for two minutes each. There are also two additional pre programmed brushing time routines: the \\&quot;Go Care\\&quot; which is a one minute routine for the person with poor-to-fair dental habits and the three minute \\&quot;Max Care\\&quot; combined clean and massage cycle for the truly obsessive-compulsive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Are these timers really necessary? No, absolutely not! Are they helpful? Yes! I admit to cheating on my brush time. Having a little buzzer going off every 30 seconds is a helpful reminder to switch to the next quadrant before my sleep befuddled head hits the medicine cabinet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another nice feature is a battery life gauge which lets you know when its time to recharge, should you be the kind of person who does not store the brush on the charger when not in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charge on these brushes lasts a long time. In fact, you can travel with just the brush handle for up to a week with out the need for the charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My household has been using these brushes for a while now. We have the FlexCare model that comes with two handles and a UV sanitizer charger base and a travel base. The reason for purchasing this new single unit is that someone (who shall go unnamed) tried to replace the brush and somehow, someway bent the metal pin attachment on the end of the handle. I have no idea how this happened because this metal pin is in no way fragile....but there you have it! Unfortunately, Phillips does not sell just the handle, you have to purchase the entire new kit and this kit is the least expensive one available.sh handle for up to a week with out the need for the charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My household has been using these brushes for a while now.

    <li> All I can say is WOW! this is an amazing device! I have had mine for nearly three weeks now and the difference is obvious.  My teeth and gums look and feel better, and every time I use it, it feels like I just left the hygienists office. Even this little stain I have had most of life because of the way two teeth overlap, is shrinking to the point of disappearing! It is quite expensive, and I&#x27;m sure I won&#x27;t get to spend as much time with my very cute, very sweet hygienist that cleans my teeth every six months.  But I also have the feeling that I won&#x27;t have to spend as much time with my not so cute, not so sweet, (although very good and professional) dentist! THAT will make whatever this thing costs, WORTH it!</li>
    <li> I believe this tooth brush significantly improves my oral health as compared to a manual toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has more features than the [[ASIN:B0019ZEVZU Philips Sonicare HealthyWhite Power Toothbrush]] which means that it costs more and has an extra button which I accidentally press frequently which switches it to a different mode.  All I use is the standard mode.  The HealthyWhite would have been both cheaper and more convenient.  I fell into the trap that says more features are better.  I would choose the simpler is better choice if I was to do it over.</li>
    <li> Product had reasonable delivery, and arrived as advertised. This was a replacement for my wife&#x27;s existing sonicare, and the new one is working quite well</li>
    <li> I was forced to buy this electric toothbrush after my old Sonicare finally gave out after about 12 years. With my old one it was getting hard to find the proper brush for it. What I really like about the new Sonicare toothbrushes is that they seem to have solve the problem with gunk building up under the brush where it inserts into the holder. Much easier to clean. The new one seems to brush more vigorously than the old one. The instructions are clear and after reading some comments. I shut off the break in to full power period. When the toothbrush arrives it builds up to full power during the first week or so. I&#x27;m hoping this one can last at least half as long as my old did. It has lithium batteries which are better than the Ni-cads the old had. I wish Sonicare would make it so the battery is replaceable. I noticed the price went up to since I bought this a couple of weeks ago. The only problem I can see is Amazon dithers around with an order when ever it&#x27;s a free shipping order. It seems like they&#x27;re trying to push you into going for a paid shipping order. Zappos does it for free and they&#x27;re quick. I just happen to order sandals two days ago and they came today.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush does a great job but after three years and seven months it died.  In the last six months it would buzz without warning.  I only used the first setting for maximum brushing. After trying the other two settings they seemed unnecessary to me.  My new Phillips Sonicare will be one with one setting and at a cost of more than one-third less.</li>
    <li> We bought this toothbrush last Christmas to replace our several years old Braun toothbrush that we could no longer find replacement heads. We should have stayed with the Braun! The Sonicare has puked out after less than 10 months use.</li>
    <li> one minor flaw: water can get inside the charge base and cord wrapper through the circular opening. please fix this with the next version update.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is great for brushing your teeth as long at the head doesn&#x27;t break and become wobbly.  Luckily, the first time it happend It was under the warranty and they replaced it with no problems. When I called about this one they bascially said i&#x27;m out of luck.  The new toothbrush did not come with a seperate warranty and they would be more than happy to send me a $10 rebate to purchase another one.</li>
    <li> This is my second Philips Sonicare toothbrush. What surprised me was the fact that now they only give you one brush instead of two like my last one. The plastic mold in the box still has a space for two but one is now empty. If they are going to short you one brush, at least change the molding so it&#x27;s not so obvious you&#x27;re getting stiffed.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush has improved my gum health dramatically, as a dentist I take very good care of my teeth, brushing with a manual toothbrush is ok, but brushing with the Sonicare Flexcare you receive the benefit you would from a prophylaxis from your dental hygienist (minus the scaling and probing). This is especially good for people who don&#x27;t floss, I&#x27;m not saying not to floss but the people who refuse to, it does a good job getting in the interproximals like floss would but again is no substitute for floss. I would recommend this toothbrush to my patients any day and I do. I sell this toothbrush at my office. It sells out almost weekly. Worth the price in my opinion!</li>
    <li> I PURCHASED THIS PHILLIPS SONICARE TOOTHBRUSH TO REPLACE AN OLDER MODEL.  HAVE BEEN USING THIS BRAND FOR MANY YEARS.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED BY MY DENTIST, PERIODONTIST AND ORAL SURGEON.  THIS IS THE BEST ON THE MARKET AND AMAZON HAS A VERY COMPETITIVE PRICE AND I DIDN&#x27;T NEED TO RUN AROUND TO SHOP OR STAND IN LINE.</li>
    <li> my teeth are clean...which is what I wanted... it works while traveling without the charger which helps reduce the luggage by even a little</li>
    <li> Moved up from a 3 or 4 year old sonicare (not sure what model) and have to say this version is great.  It holds a charge and does a great job of cleaning my teeth.  The profile is a good bit smaller than my old sonicare which makes it easier to pack when traveling.  The head and handle come apart easily which makes cleaning both easy as well.  Wish it was a few dollars less expensive.</li>
    <li> I got this toothbrush on the advice of a friend who was studying in Dental School at the time. I was reluctant to try electric toothbrushes because I thought they were for lazy people. I had broken my right thumb at a ball game, several years ago, and while my hand was in a cast, I used one of the cheaper AAA battery powered, rotating brush. That experience was a disappointment so I went back to my regular brush when the cast was gone. But Sonicare is truly is a fantastic cleaning machine and leaves the mouth feeling almost as clean as after a dental visit. I have now owned and used it for over two years. Still runs beautifully although battery life may have gone down a bit. I&#x27;ve read reviews that suggest that this may be the best toothbrush out there (Although if you are buying now, check out the newer Flexcare+ model, which has a better carrying case) I prefer the slim design of the Flexcare than the fatter models from both Philipps and Oral-B. Also I read a review that said the Elite model&#x27;s refills can have stuff growing inside them unless you clean it regularly. A lesser problem on this brush. I like both the 1-minute and 3-minute modes on this, but both I and my hygienist wish they had a 2-minute option. The only drawback I see in Sonic toothbrushes is that they are a bit loud in the mouth, and some days when I am half asleep or it is late night, I don&#x27;t want so much ruckus in my mouth, and I choose the regular brush. Vibration causes noise and your ears are right there. Philips can&#x27;t fight Physics, so don&#x27;t hold it against them. While traveling, this is a much heavier toothbrush to carry, so on some trips I take the regular brush. However, if the trip is longer than seven days, I immediately notice the drop in dental hygiene. This has become a necessity. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> The same week I order the Sonicare FlexCare I had scheduled my semiannual cleaning.  My dental hygienist highly recommended this cleaning system without knowing I had already order it!  She explained the technique for using the Sonicare and what she liked best about her FlexCare brush.  I could not be more pleased!  While some may consider the price point high, I believe it is worth every penny!!</li>
    <li> My teeth are so clean every time i use this that i feel like i just left the dentist office. And my teeth are definitely whiter.</li>
    <li> I am stealing this review from someone else because I agree with it almost exactly. The only difference is I dont consider mold a minor issue, I had to throw it away, because I am not sticking a moldy toothbrush in my mouth every morning. On the other hand I will probably by another one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush works well but there is a (very) minor thing that drives me crazy about it. When you put on the head, there is this weird space in-between the head and the brush. No matter how much you push it down, it doesn&#x27;t go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worse than just being annoying, it creates mold. If you don&#x27;t proactively clean the area once a week, mold will build up because of the moisture trapped there. Gross!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(In addition, it&#x27;s too easy to push the buttons accidentally while you are brushing). Bad design overall in so many ways! \\&quot;</li>
    <li> This is the second Sonicare we have owned.  The first one started to go downhill after two years - the brush was getting wobbly and the sonicare was wearing out.  We got the same kind because we really like it.  We were without it for one week (we wrongly chose not to bring it with us on vacation) and after one week of using a regular toothbrush, I was so glad to get back to my Sonicare.  I like the \\&quot;prompts\\&quot; that tell you when to move on to another part of your mouth and the \\&quot;to go\\&quot; feature when you are rushed.  I drink a lot of tea which stains teeth and the Sonicare keeps them looking a lot whiter than if I used a regular toothbrush.  And my teeth always feel like after I have had a dental visit.  I would definitely recommend the Sonicare.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0013TVEWA Philips Sonicare FlexCare Rechargeable Sonic Toothbrush]]I love it very much.  Ohave some brush heads.  It works very good Kathy Hering</li>
    <li> Does a great job cleaning your teeth.  Another strength is that the battery lasts forever after being charged.  Unit looks great as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the toothbrush is connected to the handle with a tiny metal piece which after 18 months stopped fitting into it&#x27;s slot - and thus caused the unit to stop being useful.</li>
    <li> The Philips Sonicare toothbrush range utilises ultrasonic cleaning (as used in hospital sterile service units to clean the gunk off surgical instruments) in addition to the physical vibration of the bristles on the teeth. You don&#x27;t need to move or agitate the brush: just hold it to the teeth upper, lower, left, right, inside, outside then rinse when finished. A timer is incorporated which issues an audible signal every 30 seconds, repeated four times to ensure upper left, upper right, lower left and lower right areas are cleaned properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve had other makes of electric toothbrush in the past which use the word \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; in the product description but few actually employ genuine ultrasonic cleaning technology like these from Philips (the Oral B range also uses genuine ultrasonic cleaning).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The heads are removable for transportation and may be changed or renewed regularly, and in our case there have been no issues with the head working loose as reported by a minority of reviewers here. If you have two toothbrushes in the bathroom, the handles come colour-coded so you don&#x27;t get mixed up. However if you do have two brushes, an irritating minor issue will soon become evident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions for use insist the toothbrushes should be kept on the charging base (a clever device which works well and only exposes sealed plastic to sealed plastic, so is effectively waterproof). However keeping both brushes on the charging base is simply not possible as no twin charger is available, so if you have two brushes then they have to be charged alternately. Almost no bathroom is fitted with more than one electric razor/toothbrush power socket, so buying two separate chargers will not solve this problem. This is a minor design fault, as mentioned by another reviewer, which quickly becomes obvious (and slightly irksome) to the new user.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another consideration is that these are almost the most expensive electric toothbrushes on the market, but worth it if you value good dental hygiene. Again, in our case they have proved to be 100% reliable in service so over time the initial outlay evens out.dental hygiene.

    <li> I&#x27;ve only had my new Sonicare Flexcare system for one week, and am still in the initial \\&quot;set-up stage\\&quot;.  Can tell the difference in the cleanliness of my teeth when I brush as compared to the Braun I&#x27;ve used for the past 15 years.  The only disappointment for me is that my husband can&#x27;t use it.  I don&#x27;t really notice the vibration when it&#x27;s running, but he made his living as a welder and his wrist and hand can not stand to hold on to the unit--too painful to use.  So now we have a Sonicare and a Braun in our bathroom.  If there was not a noticable difference between the two I would sent the Sonicare back, however there really is a difference between the two systems.  Also the compact brush works very well in my mouth because it is small and allows me to brush back behind the molars.  If you are considering a purchse I really think it is a quality investment in your dental hygiene and you really do not have anything to loose, as Sonicare has a 28 day  return policy if not 100% satisfied with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Feels just it like it should - amazing.  This thing buzzes and buffs your whites to a shine.  No more nasty tarter buildup for your dentist to shake his finger at.  Seriously, it&#x27;s good at breaking that stuff up, especially on those rear molars.  I imagine their slogan could be \\&quot;once you go sonicare.... \\&quot; you know.</li>
    <li> We bought the SonicCare Flexcare in 2008. Within 8 months my husband&#x27;s toothbrush broke. It just died, it would not turn on. Customer service said that we must always have the unit on the charger, which we were not doing. So a new toothbrush was sent out to us. Which was great. Then 4 months later my sonic care broke. I always had it on the charger as customer service told us, but that didn&#x27;t stop mine from vibrating strangely and stopping after a few seconds. So once again we called customer service and after following their steps and still unable to get the toothbrush to work properly we got a new one in the mail and returned the old one. So this happens 2 more times. In all we are on our 4th replacement. The 2 year warranty expired so we can&#x27;t get a replacement. This is the worst Sonic Care. We never dropped it we never traveled with them, they just sat on the chargers as advised by customer sevice.  I don&#x27;t understand how there is an average of 4 1/2 stars. My old sonic care, the heavy clunky one lasted 6 years, these barely make it through 8 months. I wish I could say we got a lemon, but 4 in a row? That&#x27;s just not logical. Customer service is great, so at least we got 2 years out of the 100+ we spent on the set.</li>
    <li> I have used electric toothbrushes for several years, since having received a recommendation from my dentist (who is probably getting some kick-back from Sonicare, but I still like him since he takes care of my five crowns which I have received as a result of a childhood injury).  The previous toothbrushes have lasted 2+ years easily before the electric/magnetic motor broke.  This toothbrush after 5 months has started to turn itself on randomly at night (such that it now sleeps in a closet with the door closed and a couple pillows on it to muffle the noise.  I don&#x27;t know how long I can take it, but the thing should be under warranty,of course the Philips warranty web site is currently down (or maybe it&#x27;s alwasy down?!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice is, save your money, use a floss regularly, don&#x27;t drink too much alcohol, stop smoking and use a regular, soft head toothbrush, you will probably be just as well off and you will not have to worry about the electronic pandemonium that could ensue.  If you do buy this toothbrush save the warranty information or use a credit card that will stand up to Philips and Amazon, because Amazon is not going to help you with the warranty issue.</li>
    <li> My last sonicare recently died, and despite being annoyed that it only lasted 2.5 years, I love sonicare toothbrushes so bought a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My last one was a healthy white toothbrush, which I thought I liked, but I have to admit the flexcare seems much better. Maybe they just get weaker after a couple of years, but after only one week of brushing with the new toothbrush my teeth are whiter and my gums look healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the full clean mode, which includes the gum massage, and think it&#x27;s working great!</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush, but after 18 months it is not working properly.</li>
    <li> Since using a flexcare myself, I&#x27;ve bought one for all my children and grandchildren....not because I have lots of money (I don&#x27;t), but because I&#x27;ve never had a toothbrush make so much difference in my dental health.  Before using it, (and I did have a good electric toothbrush) I had pockets in my gum line which I couldn&#x27;t get rid of no matter how much I flossed and brushed.... now, no pockets, very healty gums.  Also whiter teeth.  Talk with anyone who&#x27;s started using the Sonicare flexcare... most everyone says it&#x27;s made a difference.</li>
    <li> My dentist advised me that I had gum disease which might lead to tooth loss.&lt;br /&gt;After using Philips Sonicare FlexCare for one year my dentist advised me that my gums are healthy.</li>
    <li> The product Sonicare flexicare rechargeable brush is really a marvalous product for oral care.&lt;br /&gt;Now I want to know the product number for ordering its additional brush head modal number please provide information immediately.&lt;br /&gt;regds&lt;br /&gt;kaushal</li>
    <li> Like clean teeth? This is it!</li>
    <li> I bought this almost a year ago works great it is smaller than my 1st one so it is easy to work with I would recommend anyone to buy this once you use one of these it would be hard to go back to a regular toothbrush  gets your teeth really clean</li>
    <li> Thia was delivered in a itmly fashion and the product as good as described. Easy to uses and clean. I took it on a two week vacation and had plenty of power for the entire time without recharging!</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush.  It was recommended by my hygienist and though I hesitated to buy it, I&#x27;m very glad I did.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is powerful and gives you a real nice all over cleaning. It also has some nice options for different cleaning styles and time settings to make it more useful even when you need to run out.</li>
    <li> Finally replaced the \\&quot;first generation\\&quot; Sonicare, and what a difference!!!!!  The improvements made have all been positive and awesome.  Added features, such as \\&quot;Massage\\&quot; really a Plus.  Great Product.</li>
    <li> Received this as a gift. It takes some adjustment if switching over from old manual toothbrush. Didn&#x27;t like at first but quickly got used to it. Does a good job, my dentist noticed a difference. Price seems a little high but I didn&#x27;t research any others.</li>
    <li> I have been reading others on here relating this product to other \\&quot;ordinary\\&quot; powered tooth brushes. The reason this one is on the high end of the price spectrum, is the fact that it uses the same technology your dentist uses to remove plaque. Ultra-sonic waves, that blast plaque, and help disperse it, which is the entire point of brushing your teeth. Other models can not compete at plaque removal if they are not using these ultra-sonic technologies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now anyone that has ever been to a dentist, and had a cleaning with what seemed like a water pick, instead of the regular sickle type, pain makers, knows the difference between the two. And there is no faster, more effective way than to combine that sonic/water sickle, which we can not get for home use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the next BEST thing. Ask your dentist on your next check up. I don&#x27;t buy all the hype about the different models, they all effectively do the same thing, just with a different face and a jazzy name. Any of the sonicare brush sets will do.</li>
    <li> Love Sonicare, purchased this last year when my other one died after 15 years of use.  Battery holds a good charge</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m trying philips make for the second time.  The first brush was an elite and after just a couple of years the battery stopped charging.  I&#x27;m happy with the flex mainl.  Iy bought it cause of the good price of 109.00 on Amazon</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothbrush for over a year now and am a Sonicare customer for nearly a decade.  It has a ton of features and is very easy to use.  If you&#x27;re looking for a Sonicare brush, be sure to buy one that has the \\&quot;pacer\\&quot; feature to help you time your brushing (like this one).  The cheaper models still clean your teeth but don&#x27;t give you the audio cue when brushing.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with this brush.</li>
    <li> Battery holds a charge over a long period of time, and it does a fabulous job of cleaning your teeth.  would highly recommend</li>
    <li> Having used an Elite Model for a few years, we upgraded to the newest Flex.  Two problems:&lt;br /&gt;1. the user interface needs a bunch of work.  Buttons are placed such that it is difficult for me to complete a brushing sequence without touching one of the speed buttons to slow it down.  Big fingers don&#x27;t work with this model.  Do they even test these with users?&lt;br /&gt;2. As recommended, after a few months we bought some new heads.  After using the new heads for two weeks, they started falling off the toothbrush every time we try to brush our teeth.  Googling the problem shows several thousand hits with apparently a similar problem.  One reviewer reported that the company (Philips) said some bad brush heads got manufactured, but I don&#x27;t think that is the problem, as we&#x27;ve tried multiple heads.  I&#x27;m not about to spend any more money on buying very expensive brush heads that may or may not be defective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try another brand.  These are way too expensive anyway.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Only wish it would have come with more than a single brush head -- maybe an assortment of the options available to be able to make an informed choice for refills.</li>
    <li> I ueed Amazon.com to purchase the item because of convience and price. I purchased the Philips Sonicare FlexCare Toothbrush upon the recommendation of my Dentist. It is everything he said it was.  It really does the job.  No plaque buildup as far as I can tell and I no longer have to floss which I hate to do.  It is well worth the purchase price if it keeps the falseteeth away.  My wife purchased another model of the Philips Sonicare FlexCare Toothbrush and has been using hers for a month or two before I started to use mine.  She really has a sexy smile now and causes me to take notice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the different settings and cycles. I like the 2 minute cycle with the 30 seconds for each quarter of the mouth with a beep to signal change to a different part of the mouth.  In the beginning it took about 2 uses to become accustom to it.  It does tingle at first and if you don&#x27;t keep your mouth closed you will find it will give you a shower as well as anything else within 3 feet.  But after a few uses this is no longer a problem as the directions in the manual indicates.  It is much longer then the handle of a regular manual toothbrush and it took a couple of uses to get use to the extra length.  IT GETS THE TEETH CLEAN.  My teeth appear to be whiter as well.  I can&#x27;t wait for my next 6 month checkup and cleaning.  Hopefully this toothbrush will put the hygenist on the unemployment list and cause my dentist to go on welfare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Less toothpaste is required as you put just a small amount on the brush as \\&quot;a little dab will do ya\\&quot;. The sonic part of the brush really does work. After you finish the brushing your mouth really feels clean and that feeling lasts for a long time.  I had some tough roast beef get stuck between my teeth and the sonic part dislodged it in a flash.  I don&#x27;t need tooth picks any more.  Again more people out of work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mechanically, it is rugged, well designed and built.  Thus far, I have had no problem with it.  The control button are easy to use and the LED lights are easy to see and I have no problem seeing which cycle I am using. It is very easy to keep clean by wiping the handle portion with a cloth and removing the brush portion and rinsing. Eventhough, the electrical part of the toothbrush appears to be well sealed I am careful not to get that part soaking wet.  I purchased replacement brushes from Amazon.com as well.  The storage/charger is convinient and I will be testing the travelability in a month or two when I go to West Africa.  It sure beats the old fashion toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend the purchase and use of this product.use and the LED lights are easy to see and I have no problem seeing which cycle I am using.

    <li> I have been using the Sonicare Flexcare toothbrush for several years.  Just had to replace the one I had and so I bought the newest model.  It&#x27;s just as good as the other one, only it&#x27;s NEW!!  Really helps if you have any gum problems like I have had since the early 1990s.  When I learned about the Phillips Sonicare toothbrush, I  was very well impressed and have been using one since early 2000\\&quot;s.  It helps to keep your dental exams at EXCELLENT.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the first generation for years and was satisfied.  This newer version is lighter, faster and definitely feels like it is cleaning more efficiently.</li>
    <li> This Sonicare flexcare is my first sonic toothbrush. I thought the spinbrush was really a big step up from a manual brush but the sonicare is way better. Within a couple of weeks I noticed my teeth and gums had a huge improvement and some stubborn stains were improved as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT the way the heads are shaped with a dramatic arch it seems the designers only had the front of the teeth in mind &amp; I found there is plaque build up behind my lower front teeth that is from not being able to sufficiently apply the bristles to that area (short of holding the brush at a 90 degree angle upward and leaving my mouth open while spittle spews onto the mirror and down my shirt, which makes the dramatically long front upper bristles pummel the soft under-the-tongue tissue). Flossing nightly has not prevented this since one can not wrap the floss around the entire bottom of each tooth (thus the importance of a brush such as Sonicare!) I&#x27;m going to start using a manual toothbrush in that area and buy some plaque remover, now that I see what a problem it&#x27;s become.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still recommend this item for the overall health of gums and teeth but this is a big problem for me and hopefully I can warn others so they don&#x27;t suddenly realize that the plaque has built up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Also just a note, if you are searching toothbrushes because of a film in your mouth or constant bad breath, I recommend researching Candidas Albacans because these could be symptoms of bacteria overgrowth from overuse of sugars and starches in your diet, a very under-diagnosed illness.)</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is far better than any I have ever used. I cleans my teeth so well that they feel like I have just come from the Hygenist. I was slow to spend the extra money but it was well worth it!</li>
    <li> My whole life I&#x27;ve been a dentist&#x27;s dream come true. I couldn&#x27;t imagine I&#x27;d ever go to the dentist and have less than 4 cavities -- usually more like 6 or 8 with a root canal and crown thrown in for good measure. Every time I&#x27;m lectured about how I need to quit drinking pop. Well, to be honest drinking pop is one of my 4 fundamental reasons for living, not gonna happen folks. I got this device at COST from my periodontist, on a whim, and now after 8 months of flossing every-other-day and using my Sonicare 1.75 times a day (trying for 2!) -- I went to get a tooth cleaning and heard compliments from the hygienist and dentist. Unbelievable. No cavities. They didn&#x27;t even mention pop except to suggest I swish with water so it won&#x27;t stain my exposed root surfaces so much. HA! 20+ years of lectures from dentists about proper brushing technique, all for nothing, the tens of thousands of $ in fillings might all have been significantly reduced with just this.(By the way I *am* brushing mostly by aiming the Sonicare into my gums at an angle and mostly ignoring the surface of my teeth, as instructed.)</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t visited my dentist in nearly 5 years (yes, gross I know), and bought this when he recommended it to me to correct the gum abrasion that was happening in my mouth.  Apparently I was brushing too hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two minute setting is awesome, and using this toothbrush has become a very normal ritual.  At first, the feeling of the Sonicare head was very strange at first, but you get used to it after a few days.  Sometimes, I will use the one minute Go Care setting if I feel as though I&#x27;m extremely rushed.  Normally, I use the sensitive setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read some of the negative reviews here, and feel as though if the buttons are getting in the way of your brushing, it means you are gripping the toothbrush handle way too tight.  A gentle grasp of the handle with a few fingers along with gliding the toothbrush head along your gum line is all that needs to be done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery lasts just about forever, and normally do not need to charge until 3 or 4 weeks later.  I took this on a two week vacation without any problem at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not needed to change my toothbrush head yet, but have removed and reattached it during my vacation multiple times without any problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think my only complaint would be that I wish you could set a default brush mode.  I have to set it to sensitive mode each and every time I brush.  I believe it defaults to the Go Care mode.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, don&#x27;t forget to floss.  This is obviously not the magic answer to the lack of flossing, but it will surely help with those hard brushers like myself.</li>
    <li> I bought this product in May 2009 - great brush!  Yet a touch over a year it just stopped working.  So I called Phillips and it had a 2 year warranty so they replaced it.  Great...happy again.&lt;br /&gt;Well fast forward a year and a half later the replacement brush just died, simply stopped...again.  Sorry but a product that costs around $140 in my book should last longer than a year, year and a half.  Put the cost of the replacement heads and this is ONE VERY EXPENSIVE TOOTH BRUSH!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phillips if and when you improve your product I&#x27;ll come back but until that time you lost a customer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REVIEW UPDATE:  I took the unit apart and I now see why it, and probably way, the other one just stopped working - water corrosion.  The seal at the top of the unit allows water to get into the electronics and corrode them.  Designed to fail.  The unit maybe has $8 worth of parts in it so you&#x27;d think that for a $100+ item they would make the seal better especially since it&#x27;s made for water exposer.  Zero excuse Phillips...poorly made product.</li>
    <li> After using my brush for a couple of weeks, I noticed the brush doesn&#x27;t have any vibrations. Amazon replaced it with a new brush. But after only two weeks, the brush refused to work again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no choice but asking for refund from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Philips is destroying its own reputation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rate it one star because it works for a couple of weeks any way.</li>
    <li> I bought this over a year ago. I had another model of the Philips Sonicare toothbrush before that and really liked it so decided to buy this one. The replacement brush heads are reasonably priced and don&#x27;t need to be changed that often. The battery lasts long so you don&#x27;t need to leave the stand plugged in if you&#x27;re conscious of your energy footprint. The device has a battery light to show how much it&#x27;s charged and the toothbrush is comfortable in your hand while brushing. The brush head does a nice job of cleaning your teeth and getting in close to the gums (as long as the brush isn&#x27;t overused). My only issue with this toothbrush is the stand. The brush just sort of sits on top of the stand, which makes it pretty easy to knock over. My old brush kind of sat in a cradle, which kept it upright and made it much more difficult to knock over when you are working with a small amount of counter space. Overall, great product and no real complaints other than gravity.</li>
    <li> I ordered one of these and after using it for a month, the bottom of it smelled horrible, like a gym bag full of sweaty clothes. Amazon replaced it and the replacement had the same problem. It seems that over time, as the plastic on the bottom gets in contact with water, it develops this horrible smell. I have never had this problem with any other toothbrush or other device used in my personal care routine.</li>
    <li> This is my 4th SonicCare.  I have used these for years, and have replaced them as the battery wears out.  I am very disappointed with this particular unit.  For some reason, the quad-pacer program doesn&#x27;t work properly, the unit shuts off inadvertently, and the timer is intermittent.  I am even having problems with the simple standard cleaning mode.  This is a big disappointment to me, because I used to swear by this Phillips product. No more.  I will try to get it replaced thru Amazon, but I have disposed of the shipping packaging; not sure how this going to turn out.  Keep the packaging if you buy one these, you may need it.</li>
    <li> I have been a loyal user of Sonicare products for over 15 years. Each toothbrush handle on average has lasted 4-6 years. Purchased the new Flex care two years ago. The toothbrush lasted 6-9 months. Called Sonic Care and they apoglized stating the Flexcare was a new product and they had a bad bunch. They quickly sent a new handle. 6-9 months later the replacement handle no longer worked again. Called again and this time because the original purchase was over two years ago they will not replace the new toothbrush sent 6-9 months ago. No apologize this time. No explanation for the short duration time the product was active. Understand they do not want to indefinitely send me a new toothbrush every 6-9 months on a purchase made in the past. However, now I lack the confidence to purchase a new Sonicare toothbrush based on the performance of the last three owned. Have the children&#x27;s Sonicare toothbrush for a year and so far the kids brush has worked fine. Not sure why the adult Flexcare is so unreliable. I think it maybe related to the mechanism of removing the brush heads and the thin metal bar the heads rest on. Do not want to return to the old Sonicare e-series (so gross to clean). I would not recommend this product unless you want to deal with your toothbrush only lasting 6-9months.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush only lasted 1yr before the motor became erratic and non fuctional.  The brush did a fine job for almost a year.  Built in obsolescence no doubt.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;re on out third of fourth generation of Sonicare toothbrushes, and are still happy campers. I generally don&#x27;t like it when things go through design changes, but the newer, smaller heads and slimmer brushes make getting to the back teeth much easier. And believe it or not, our dogs like them too (they have their own)!</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd Sonicare in 11 years. Ever since I first started using the Sonicare my dentist visits were a breeze! I got this one recently to replace my last one, and I didnt want/need the sanatizing station and all the other extra stuff that comes with the other Sonicare kits. All I can say is, If you&#x27;ve never had a Sonicare and you are thinking of a better way to keep your teeth clean and gums healthy GET THIS NOW!! :) I really like that this new one has a Lithium Ion Battery opposed to the older Ni-Cad battery. LOVE IT! YOU NEED ONE!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so great, I even take it with when I go on vacationl</li>
    <li> Everytime I brush my teeth it feels like I just came back from a professional cleaning at the dentist!&lt;br /&gt;Highly Highlyyy recommend it!</li>
    <li> It is quite an improvement from the old model: lighter in weight hence easier to use; the new battery lasts much longer.</li>
    <li> I always put off buying one of these. I recently had gum surgery and this was highly recommended. I have had electric toothbrushes in the past but they don&#x27;t compare. This one is awesome. I love the different options of cleaning you have - Clean, sensitive, massage, go care and max care. I also love how it gives you an indication when it is time to change quadrants in your mouth. Great item! Should have bought years ago!</li>
    <li> I bought this product at my dentist recommendation. I used to brush my teeth very well, but my dentist said the plague keeps building between my teeth as they are no perfectly aligned. This product has made a difference in just few weeks that I have used it thus far. I feel refreshed after using this product. It is not how hard you brush it is actually how good you brush and this product does a pretty good job in cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that for initial few days you will notice lot of vibration in your mouth, which would feel very odd, but after a week of usage the vibration will be less bothering. This is the only price that you would have to pay to use this product IMHO.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with my recent purchase of the sonicare electric toothbrush.  It is user-friendly and durable.  It features a longer brush time and a shorter one so I can have more flexibility in how long I brush my teeth.  Excellent product!</li>
    <li> This is the second FlexCare toothbrush I have owned. The first lasted about 3 years (not a bad run!). When that toothbrush broke and I had to go back to \\&quot;regular brushing\\&quot;, it was a real eye opener as to how great the FlexCare is. My teeth / mouth did not feel clean without it. I really like the timed settings because the force me to take time and work on each section of my teeth. Also I feel that my gums have gotten much healthier with consistent use of the FlexCare. Before trying the FlexCare I had noticed some receding of my gums especially around my front teeth. This was reversed after about 2 months of FlexCare use. Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another note: I previously owned the FlexCare that has the sterilization chamber (not sure what the actual name is). It was a good idea, but got dirty quickly which felt like it was defeating it&#x27;s very purpose. I actually prefer the regular charging stand. Easy to use and easy to keep clean.</li>
    <li> I have had several of these toothbrushes both for me and for my husband. The head barely vibrates now and even when you turn it on and put it under water, it doesn&#x27;t move the water. I tried turning it on and putting it on my hand. It makes noise but doesn&#x27;t vibrate anymore. I called the company and they said it had turned 2 years old so I&#x27;m on my own. I have bought several of these and the vibration to clean my teeth is minimal, very disappointed especailly for the price of these.&lt;br /&gt;dee</li>
    <li> Was given this last Christmas to replace a 3 yr old Sonicare, which had worked well.  I am a big fan of Sonicare (teeth really feel clean after using) but this 2nd one has just broken on me after 10 months.  The spindle on which the brush sits is now loose and as a result it makes a loud rattling noise when used.  I will probably get another one and put it down to bad luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do be aware that they are really susceptible to mould on the rear of the base - having owned two of these I have learned that the grippy rubber makes it impossible to remove once it gets on.  You really have to be diligent in rinsing and drying the handle after using it.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t understand the point of an electric toothbrush until I got a new dentist, who explained that something like a Sonicare vibrates faster and therefore cleans better than a manual toothbrush. I&#x27;ve had more than my share of cavities, so I picked up a Sonicare Flexcare and have been very impressed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This gadget is very well designed, and as I was learning to use it I kept getting the feeling that Philips thought of everything. (It&#x27;s almost like an Apple product in that way.) The charging base comes apart for portability while traveling; the brush handle fits to the base without any metal connections, so there&#x27;s no risk of shock in the bathroom; the brush handle is even waterproof for those who like to brush in the shower. My wife and I share a handle, and the charging base has two pegs to store our brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that this model includes &amp;#34;massage&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;gum care&amp;#34; modes, but I haven&#x27;t been able to figure out what those do or how to use them. I&#x27;ve read the manual, searched the Philips website, and Googled for other product reviews, and I haven&#x27;t found anything more explanatory than the names of the buttons. I really don&#x27;t see the point of including a feature if nobody knows what it does, so if I were buying this again I&#x27;d look for a model without these extra modes and try to save a few bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I would definitely buy a Sonicare again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: The motor died suddenly (while brushing) after five years of daily use. I guess that&#x27;s a good ROI, but it seemed so well made that I expected it to last indefinitely. I called Philips and they said it was out of warranty but gave me a 15% off coupon for a new toothbrush from their website. I ended up just coming back to Amazon and buying a new one here.</li>
    <li> I bought this new Sonicare toothbrush to replace a 3 year old model.  After a week or so, my teeth noticeably felt cleaner.  I was skeptical that it would work better than the older model, but it does.  I highly recomment it.</li>
    <li> This is the fourth Sonicare toothbrush we have purchased and all have been great.  Very reliable and easy to use and keep clean.  A wonderful addition for anyone&#x27;s oral hygiene.</li>
    <li> I really like the toothbrush. However my second replacement toothbrush died just after 3 months of usage. It doesn&#x27;t recharge anymore. First toothbrush died just right after the year of usage. A warranty is for the year so I couldn&#x27;t return it. Bummer. Very dissapointed...</li>
    <li> I have been using the Sonicare Elite 7300 brush for a couple of years now, so it was no surprise to me that the FlexCare line is also a very good brush.  All-in-all, using the new FlexCare is not all that much different than the Elite series, it feels about the same despite the advertised 80% less vibration.  That being said the vibration does not bother me at all.  The two biggest differences I noticed with the FlexCare are the significantly smaller handle size, which could be good if you have smaller hands and the somewhat larger brush head size, which I kind of like, because it seems to clean more areas faster.  Of course the new ProResults brush head also means that I can&#x27;t use the same brush heads that I have already bought for my older brush, but I like the new head design and also the way that it just presses on instead of screwing on like the older heads did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for all of the brushing modes and cleaning routines offered with this brush, I have not even bothered with them, I like brushing my normal 2 minutes (30 seconds each quadrant) which is what the standard clean mode does, so that is what I use.  The charger station is also nice because it can hold two extra brush heads so that up to 3 people can share the same space easily.  It also has a \\&quot;travel charger\\&quot; which is just the main charger without the extra brush head spaces and also a cloth-like travel case.  The battery life also claims to be longer than any of the previous versions, so taking this on longer trips without even worrying about the charger is more of a possibility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, in conclusion, I never had any problems with my Elite series brush and I don&#x27;t expect to have any with the new FlexCare either.  It also seems to work just as well if not better and I have had wonderful dentist check-ups for the past several years with no cavities and very little plaque despite the fact that I only brush once a day, so I&#x27;m pretty happy with the Sonicare brushes and plan to use them for a long time to come.  If you are switching from a regular manual brush up to this it does have a little bit of a weird feeling at first, but other than that first week or so of getting used to it, I really have nothing negative to say about this product.me.

    <li> This is my 4th or 5th Sonicare toothbrush and my 2nd Sonicare, FlexCare.  I have used these toothbrushes for approximately 14 years.  The last Sonicare Flexcare that I had was a replacement and upgrade by the company when the sonicare that I had purchased previously became defective. I have always experienced great customer service with this company and their product is great. [[ASIN:B0013TVEWA Philips Sonicare FlexCare Rechargeable Sonic Toothbrush]]</li>
    <li> This is my second Sonicare product and I remain very impressed. I previously used the Elite for two years and my only annoyance was the design of the Elite brush head and handle. The Elite brush consisted of a screw-on dome that no matter how hard I tried to keep it dry and clean on the inside, it would always get dirty and gross and there was no way to clean it. Similarly on the Elite handle, a deep well that the magnet from the brush head would insert when brush and handle were joined would also collect dirt and was impossible to keep clean. This wasn&#x27;t a health issue but it was just gross to look at when you disassembled the brush after each use. I found that if I didnt disassemble, a black mold type substance would grow. Even taking it apart after every use would not deter this growth eventually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new Flexcare brush fixes all of these issues. Gone are the deep crevices and unreachable traps for dirt and moisture. The brush head simply inserts onto a pin on top of the handle. The handle on the Flexcare is smaller than the Elite. As for the reduction in sound and vibration, I can&#x27;t agree with the packaging because it sounds and feels the same as the Elite to me. There are many more cleaning modes however I just use the clean mode as I did before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both products clean my teeth nearly as good as the dentist. I always thought an electronic TB was a waste and was finally convinced by my dentist to try one. If you never have used one, you will be amazed at the difference from a manual brush. It takes some getting used to but you will see and feel the difference. See for yourself. After a couple of weeks try a manual brush and your mouth just doesnt feel clean at all. The package contains a charger, travel pouch, travel charger, UV brush sanitizer, 1 regular and one small brush head. My only gripe is that the travel pouch is soft where the Elite had a hard plastic case that held and cradled both the handle and brush. The new cloth pouch offers no protection from crushing or keeping the brush from hitting and possibly scratching the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions say you can put the handle in the dishwasher however at this price, I&#x27;m not brave enough to try that one. A Great product. If you are shopping for an electric TB, this is the one to get. Your teeth and gums will thank you. I also endure less scraping at the dentist since using this product so that alone is worth the price of this product.m crushing or keeping the brush from hitting and possibly scratching the handle.

    <li> This is my first experience with an electric toothbrush. My dentist recommended that I start using one, but with so many choices on the market, I didn&#x27;t know what to buy. After reading tons of reviews, I finally settled on the PS FlexCare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought the whole electric toothbrush hype was a bunch of baloney, but was willing to give it a try, and though it took a little over a week, I have noticed a remarkable difference after brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading the directions, and popping the brush onto the base, I was worried about the small gap between the brush and the base. Even though the book says that there is a small gap, I was sure that it would get gummed up, but it doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of the three modes, I typically brush in the \\&quot;clean\\&quot; mode. Sometimes when I&#x27;m brushing, I accidentally tap the button that changes the modes, and it bumps to \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot;. Not a big deal, just thought I&#x27;d mention that this happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have absolutely no complaints with this purchase, and am overall enthusiastically happy about it, and wish that I&#x27;d started using one of these years ago. I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing if my dentist observes a difference at my next checkup. I like this so much, that I&#x27;ve gotten my husband to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As much as I like this brush - and I got it for a good price - when this bites the dust, I will chance a less expensive model as a replacement.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m quite happy with it so far, works great, easy to use. However, the travel pouch is a little chintzy, a hard case would have been nice.</li>
    <li> I have been brushing manually since I was taught how to brush my teeth. I am a smoker and a coffee drinker, yes, and my dentists have always given me a hard time. I see all the work they go through to get my teeth clean. I have been going for checkups every 6 months for last 6 years or so. About 7 years ago, I had 6 veneers put on at a top University with the best staff and equipment, and they recommended that since I smoke, that I should go more frequently to ensure oral health. Over the last 6 years my veneers have taken on some staining, so I have been looking into alternative methods of tooth cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, after my hygienist recommended the Sonicare toothbrush system, I thought I would check into it. I Paid 140-ish at a BIG box store for the system with one proresults head. I bought an extra 3 pack of proresults heads so my wife and I could use the system together, for an additional 30.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I unpacked it last night, and my first impression was that the charger seemed light and cheap, but the brush itself felt very solid and compact. I glanced over the quickstart guide and I was impatiently waiting for the unit to charge. The unit looks very attractive on the counter, which is a big deal since I do not have much space. My wife and I were tired of seeing our manual toothbrush handles sitting in a pool of slimy leftovers in a decorative toothbrush holder (YUK!), so we threw all that away. This unit looks great!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After some time charging, I gave the unit a go. I was not affected by the sonic pulsations that I have heard other people complain about with other brands. I do have a few sensitive spots, but I was not too bothered by the noise or sensation. It reminds me of that great little tool the dentists have that uses water and sonic waves to BLAST away tartar and calculus off of my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 2 minutes of working on the distal lingual surfaces, I had a look and WOW! It removed the few months of stain build up which I usually get on those interior surfaces. I should note here that I do not floss everyday like I should, instead I floss every other day or longer when I feel the need. I know I know (I&#x27;m lazy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth feel very smooth and are already showing signs of whitening. I may be able to go to a yearly checkup instead of every six months now. I will wait and see what the dentist says. All in all, if you are a smoker, a coffee drinker, or if you have veneers or other dental work you will love this product, it REALLY works!faces.

    <li> Since there are many other reviews, I&#x27;ll just mention the highlights. I&#x27;ve been using the low-end Sonicare model for years and was happy with it, except for poor nickel cadmium battery life. It was annoying to have to throw away an expensive toothbrush because the battery would no longer charge. I&#x27;m hoping the lithium ion battery in this model will last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This model does seem to get my teeth cleaner. It feels like it&#x27;s doing a better job, and after getting used to it the low-end model feels really wimpy. I like the LED battery indicator because I travel a lot and don&#x27;t have to guess about when the toothbrush needs to be charged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint about this toothbrush is that it has some useless features that annoy me. For example, it turns itself off when it thinks you&#x27;ve brushed long enough. I always have to turn it back on. It&#x27;s not a big deal, just dumb. There doesn&#x27;t seem to be any way to disable this feature. The instructions indicate you can disable the \\&quot;Quad pacer\\&quot; feature, which I did, but the toothbrush still turns itself off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a toothbrush in this price range, it&#x27;s surprising that it doesn&#x27;t come with at least one extra cleaning head, or a holder for the spare heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m very happy with this toothbrush and plan to use it from now on.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I grew up with a Sonicare in the house, but through college just used manual toothbrushes. The Sonicare Flexcare is even better than the originals! I tried my friend&#x27;s electric toothbrush (competitor&#x27;s equivalent) and I am a MUCH greater fan of the Sonicare. It&#x27;s lightweight and small, so you avoid the feeling like your putting a powertool in your mouth.</li>
    <li> I had the old Elite model and like so many other reviewers, it kept getting gunk under the screw cap that was part of the brush attachment.  Secondly, it was much larger.  This model addresses my complaints with my previous model and adds additional features that will continue my allegiance to this product!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t get the ultra-violet light sterilization attachment because of my lack of space around my sink area.  But I&#x27;m not sure I would have anyway.</li>
    <li> My dentist always complained about my bleeding gums during my dental checkups, but the standard measures to desensitize gums, such as frequent brushing and flossing, weren&#x27;t working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dentist suggested that I try an electric toothbrush. I read the reviews on Amazon and chose this one because of its gum care features. After 6 months of brushing with this toothbrush, I returned to the dentist and my gums have stopped bleeding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothbrush is more expensive than the other Sonicare models, but I bought it because I thought I needed its gum care modes. In reality, the regular brushing mode was enough to desensitize my gums, and the fancy massage modes remain unused. If I were to make this purchase again, I would have chosen one of the cheaper Sonicare models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Good for gums, very long battery life (20+ uses)&lt;br /&gt;Cons: A scaly buildup forms between the brush head and toothbrush. Removing brush heads can be difficult -- difficult enough that the brush head breaks in half when I try to take it off. Too expensive for the unnecessary features.</li>
    <li> I had an older model of  Sonicare and this new model is more compact and superior in brushing action.  However, the personalized brushing button needs to be recessed.  It is too easy to activate the button and change the mode of brushing while using.</li>
    <li> My original Elite 7300&#x27;s \\&quot;on\\&quot;button wore out after four years.  I decided to purchase this new model, the Flexcare, and use the smaller brushes. It really does a great job and has multiple settings for clean and massage. I did not buy the unit with the brush cleaner as you can clean the brushes with mouthwash and get the same results as mentioned to me by my dentist. The dentist also recommended Sonicare products, which has dramatically improved my dental hygene!</li>
    <li> Much better than the battery powered model I replaced; gives you the same fresh mouth feeling you get right after a visit to the dentist</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is amazing.  It is gentle on the gums, and cleans my teeth better than any manual toothbrush I have ever used.  I have noticed the amount of buildup on my teeth has decreased as a result of using this toothbrush as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush is able to clean the hard to reach places like the back teeth, around my permanent retainer, and in the deep groves of my molars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The timer is a great feature and the different settings allow you to find the brushing setting you&#x27;ll like best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like almost anything else, you get what you pay for, I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I have had two Braun&#x27;s over the years but on my Dentists advice I recently got the FlexCare.&lt;br /&gt;The battery holds a charge for a very long time and it&#x27;s attractive with the lights and all.&lt;br /&gt;I now find myself using both the FlexCare at night and Oral B in the AM as I still like the smaller round brush head of the oral B.&lt;br /&gt;The SoniCare runs so fast and the buzzing and vibrating can be un-nerving at times. Perhaps in time I will get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;The SoniCare seems to clean better especially at the gum line. I would have liked a little longer handle and the two minute timer and brief 30 second&lt;br /&gt;pauses are distracting and not really needed. The massage function is OK, but again not really needed.&lt;br /&gt;All in all a good cleaning instrument with long battery life.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a Sonicare toothbrush for several years now and I think they are great. My dentist is always very impressed with how clean my teeth are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This new brush features a MUCH better streamlined design. The older Sonicare brushes had a design flaw in which water would get caught between the brush part and the handle, allowing mold to grow. Not so on the newest models. They are sleek and functional.</li>
    <li> An avid Oral-B fan of many, many years, but finally decided to make the investment, and clearly a huge step up, after having this toothbrush recommended to me by two different dentists as the perfect tool for my sensitive teeth. Well what can I say? My teeth have never felt this clean (it still feels clean as I type this at 4pm - and the last time I brushed my teeth were this morning at 8am). That fuzziness that you sometimes get later in the day is something of the past and I simply cannot stop touching my teeth with my tongue. It&#x27;s crazy clean!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The intensity of the brush takes some getting used to, and I do think that I might chip a piece off one of my other teeth every time it comes in accidental contact with the top of the brush head, but so far so good! All teeth are still in tact and very, very clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, another note. I was tempted into buying the brush with the sanitizing station option, but ended up just getting the plain one and saving some money. So far I have not felt an ounce of regret and I don&#x27;t think you will either. This version comes with a small charger (flat base) that also fits neatly inside a bigger one to make it more stable. There&#x27;s also none of the &#x27;gunk&#x27; build-up I had to rinse off my Oral-B brush after every use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five stars - well worth the investment.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a dentist and this is an HONEST review from my own personal experience (no sonicare affiliation!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;-does a very very thorough job of brushing and cleaning.  Once you have sonicared, I guarantee you will never go back to a manual toothbrush.  On the days when my brush is charging and I have to brush manually, my teeth just feel so unclean in comparison.&lt;br /&gt;-is still gentle during cleaning.  This is a big problem with a lot of the other brushes I&#x27;ve encountered (either used or read about in the dental literature).  Many other electrical products on the market also do a good job of brushing, but they tend to be TOO aggressive and abrasive, so in the end they end up brushing away your gum and leaving you with gum recession and sensitivity.  Sonicare does a thorough but gentle job, leaving your gums intact in the long run.  Many of the rotary-styled brushes out there (ie, OralB) are just too abrasive and end up brushing away your gums.&lt;br /&gt;-can be shared!  If you have a spouse, you can use the same base, just switch the attachment heads.  The manufacturer designed this with it in mind, as you can choose from 3-4 different \\&quot;ring\\&quot; colors to put on your attachment head.&lt;br /&gt;-easy to clean and stays clean, does not rust or get dirty at the base (this was a problem I had with an older model, so I&#x27;m glad to see that they&#x27;ve changed it!)&lt;br /&gt;-water resistant/friendly, so you can also use it in the shower during those rushed mornings&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;-mainly, the price.  Compared to most other electrical toothbrushes on the market, it&#x27;s relatively expensive.  I would ask your dentist to see if he/she has coupons.  Even the attachment heads aren&#x27;t cheap, and I would suggest getting coupons or using rebates whenever possible (ie, if I had to buy them through retail I would go to Bed Bath&amp; Beyond and use a 20% off coupon from the store)&lt;br /&gt;-long charge time, it takes about 18 hours for the base to be recharged once it is out of battery&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please remember that no matter what brush you use, you still need to floss!!! :-)you still need to floss!!! :-)</li>
    <li> My wife finally talked me into buying this toothbrush for her after about 2 or 3 years.  We got an extra head so I could try it out too.  I absolutely love it...you feel dentist-clean every morning and night.  I have to admit it, she was right.  :/</li>
    <li> I always thought of it as a chore of necessity. I never imagined that I would actually look forward to brushing my teeth. I absolutely love how my teeth feel. It is even better than after I have been into the dentist for a cleaning.&lt;br /&gt; Initially the sonic vibrations were a little intense, but after using it a few times I found that I was used to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are on the fence, take the leap! My only regret is that I did not buy this years ago.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush does an EXCELLENT job cleaning, and is not uncomfortable to use! Sonic toothbrushes remove plaque so effectively because they basically cause the saliva to flow around the plaque and destroy it. It does cause an initial \\&quot;tickly\\&quot; feel, but that is typically gone after one or two sessions. My only issue is that it turns off after two minutes, when I&#x27;d much rather just continue brushing. Guarantees better teeth in 28 days.</li>
    <li> Purchased after reading reviews of comparison of Philips Sonicare products.  My husband likes it more than his old one.</li>
    <li> I purchased this toothbrush in December.  In less than a month the brush head started coming off each time I used it.  I called Phillips for assistance.  They were very helpful and said that they would send a new one out and pick up the old one.  I said that I would try a new brush head first and would call back if that didn&#x27;t correct the issue.  I did change it out and it worked for about one week before it started coming off again.  I have called Phillips and they are sending a new one now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Sonicare toothbrushes for about 6 years.  I have never had a problem with the tops that have threads.  Hopefully this is just a defective brush.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product but the stem onto which the brush fits and which enters the handle seems to be now disjointed in the handle so that the motion no longer transfers to the brush. There is no info about the warrantee on the product nor is there info on just buying a replacement handle \\&quot;flexcare(non-plus) without the sanitizer nor the 2nd handle. Since I can get two handles and the sanitizer plus brushes for $129, I would think I could get just a replacement handle but there&#x27;s no info on this on the Amazon site which shows the handle by itself but when clicked on takes you to the page with the whole unit. The Phillips site also show the handle separately but refers to vendors for pricing.</li>
    <li> I bought this in May 2013.  Now in December 2013, the toothbrush fully charged does not run.  Even holding the main button, the brush goes off and on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Total waste</li>
    <li> Very light and it runs and runs. Used it on a 10 day trip and it never needed a charge.</li>
    <li> I am plesed with the purchase, especially the ability to select different approaches to cleaning my teeth, especially the \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; selection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ruth B. Jones</li>
    <li> I bought this product after rejecting the the Sonicare Flex Plus. This product has a rechargeable handle,a brush and a charger, which are all I need.Further my blind wife can handle this one with out the bells and whistles on the Flex Plus which were a hindrance rather than a help.</li>
    <li> I have happily used a Sonicare Elite Pro since 2004 and while it was a great product, I did have a few issues with it.  The handle was bulky, the battery gradually weakens after the first year, the screw on heads are expensive and gather this kind of sludge underneath them, and the rubberized grip gets moldy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Flexcare has solved all of those problems AND it is much more powerful.  I am so happy with it.  In as little as two days, my teeth were looking whiter and I have zero plaque.  The heads are also a much better value.  I share the flexcare with my wife and the new pull off heads are faster and easier to change.  The Flexcare is a great step forward for Sonicare and I am sure it will last even longer than my Elite Pro!</li>
    <li> does everything it claims to - my teeth have never felt cleaner, and i can already tell they&#x27;re whiter after a couple weeks!</li>
    <li> I purchased this toothbrush in Jan. 2011 as recommended by my dentist.  It came with a 1 year warranty.  While it worked, it was great.  I felt like it really cleaned well, although I don&#x27;t agree with the claims that it will whiten your teeth.  But I liked the clean feeling and how it forced you to brush for 2 minutes, no matter how much of a rush I was in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, not even 3 months out of my warranty it BROKE!!  I tried everything.  I googled troubleshooting solutions, youtubed it... tried all the suggestions and it still wont work.  I called Philips directly for troubleshooting help and explained what I tried and \\&quot;Sid\\&quot; literally said, \\&quot;oh well, you&#x27;ll just have to buy a new one\\&quot;.  Excuse me???  I can promise you on my mothers grave I will never buy a piece of junk with the name \\&quot;Philips\\&quot; on it EVER AGAIN, let alone another one of their defective tooth brushes!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE*** I just got off with \\&quot;Carmen\\&quot; Customer Service with Amazon.com and not only was she understanding to how upset I was with the Philips people, but even though I was out of my return window by 2 months, she issued a full refund and I just have to mail the toothbrush back to them.  OMG!!!!  I have never thanked a person so much in my life!!  I told her I will definately get another toothbrush, but NOT one made by Philips!!!. Thank you soooooooooooooooo much Amazon customer service... I was soooo frustrated over this, thank you!!</li>
    <li> I had an old Sonicare Elite that was no longer holding a charge, and so I asked my dentist to recommend a new one; he recommended this. I&#x27;m very happy with it, the brush itself feels very precise and stimulating. It also charges very fast and holds it a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the positioning of the button that switches mode (not the main power button - the other one). It&#x27;s too easy to press it while using the brush, which then switches it from the mode you want to the next mode, and it&#x27;s not easy to then intentionally put it back where you wanted it without interrupting your brushing. So I find I have to hold the handle at a somewhat unnatural angle to avoid hitting that button. I wish they had designed it so that the mode button was disabled when the unit is on, since I doubt anyone would intentionally switch modes in the middle of a session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, though, I am very happy with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; /rob&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS - OK, I just thought of one other minor gripe: the shaft of the brush head, just where it enters my mouth, had a little \\&quot;mold mark\\&quot; from where the plastic was formed - a little raised circle about a millimeter across that interrupts the otherwise smooth surface - that causes a little irritation on my lip during use. Sheesh, you&#x27;d think they&#x27;d make sure these things were completely smooth!</li>
    <li> I had the older model with a larger head and the bristles were much harder. I like this one and the charge is amazingly long. So, if you have the $ for it this is the one to do. I took it on a two week trip no charger neeeded. I love it! It isn&#x27;t as harsh as the older model.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried just about every electronic toothbrush on the market (Sonicare Elite, Braun, Ultreo, and Waterpik), and the new Sonicare Flexcare beats them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Using the regular setting for a two-minute brush leaves my teeth feeling clean, the cleanest of any of the brushes I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Multiple power settings include a low power gum massage that&#x27;s just great.  This massage feels as though it stimulates blood flow to the gums, and that just has to be helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Plus, for new users, there&#x27;s an Easy Start program built into the brush that allows the brush speed to start slow and increase in power over several days.  For users familiar with electronic brushes, however, starting with the regular (full power) setting won&#x27;t be a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. The charger is solid and heavy enough to avoid the tipping over problems I&#x27;ve experienced with some other brushes.  And there&#x27;s a place to conceal the excess wiring beneath the charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. The replacement brushes are reasonably priced.  I won&#x27;t be spending the price of a new setup every year just to get new brush heads.  And I appreciate the fact that Phillips is not holding their customers hostage for replacement brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, the new Flexcare is just about perfect.  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> For most people, tooth brushing is a necessary but boring chore.  If you brush incorrectly or quickly, you may end up being a permanent fixture in the periodontist&#x27;s office.  Alas, this has happened to me, much to my dismay.  To keep your teeth and gums healthy, you might want to try an ounce of prevention:  the Sonicare Flex Care 910 Toothbrush.  It&#x27;s rechargeable (a full charge lasts for two weeks), features a timer to tell you when to move on to another section of your mouth, and includes three cleaning modes.  In addition, the \\&quot;easy start\\&quot; feature enables you become gradually accustomed to your new cleaning routine.  The grip is very comfortable and the brush head is easy to maneuver, even in hard-to-reach areas.  I still don&#x27;t love having to brush my teeth, but since it&#x27;s a necessary evil, I am thankful to have the Sonicare brush to do most of the work for me.  Along with proper flossing (which you should never neglect), it&#x27;s one of the most helpful ways to make sure that you don&#x27;t end up with serious gum problems.</li>
    <li> Short and simple: This fantastic brush is just like the other Sonicares but without the screw-on design flaw of the other Sonicare models. The other models, which are still being sold everywhere, have this hideous design where the saliva and other brushing liquids seep down into the inner mechanisms of the brush which pool up in a really disgusting way. This new design eliminates all that slew of slime. This brushing action is fantastic just like the older one.</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying I go to the dentist 3 times a year for a cleaning. I have porous teeth and have had a lot of dental work done when I was younger including braces for 6 years. I drink coffee once a day and brush after and I am a light smoker (less then 1/2 pack a day). I&#x27;m sure both the coffee and smoking contribute to staining, but I know people who do 10 times more of each and have no staining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had the Sonic care elite e series for probably more then 10 years. It lasted longer then I ever expected. The battery started failing, so I figured it has more then served it&#x27;s time and I wanted a new one. I looked at the ones with the sanitizer, but with limited room on the counter, I decided against it. I think the sanitizer is over rated anyway. Unless you&#x27;re a germ freak. Besides, I clean my brush heads in a light bleach/water mix every so often and I always replace the heads at least every 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My last dentist appt. was in July over 2 months ago. So far I have virtually no signs of staining and I would typically see signs by now and anxiously await my next cleaning which isn&#x27;t until Nov. I would say I&#x27;ll give it another month and then it will be a better indication of how well it works, but so far I am pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vibration is a bit more intense then my elite series, but it is also a more powerful brush. If you aren&#x27;t used to this kind of brush, it may take a little getting used to before you don&#x27;t feel like your head is going to vibrate off your neck :) But seriously, it&#x27;s doing it&#x27;s job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a special mode you can use (Easy-start) to ramp up to normal use if the vibration is more intense then you like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I GAVE IT 4 STARS BECAUSE (I would of given 4.5 if I could)....... The mode button is in a bad spot. I constantly hit it while brushing changing the mode and I have to switch it back. I usually brush my teeth when I&#x27;m in the shower. It&#x27;s just easier for me and it avoids a potential mess that only a electric toothbrush can produce. So perhaps my hand it more prone to moving around on the handle because it&#x27;s wet, but I still feel the mode button is in a bad spot and too sensitive as well. Other then that, it&#x27;s a great tooth brush. Definitely worth the money. For those complaining about the price, you get what you pay for.oduce.

    <li> awesome product! My dental hygenist recommended it to me. I would highly recommend it to others!</li>
    <li> This was a replacement for the essence (which after 4.5 years the rubber seal around the power button tore). I do like the bigger handle of the essence a bit better, but I like the brush head mechanism more on this model (the old one got gross under the brush head - really hard to keep clean - unless I just have an abnormal amount of bacteria in my mouth, but that&#x27;s a topic for a different day). This model, the brush head just pops off and the base is all sealed with no gaps to get mucked up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So all in all, a suitable replacement. I don&#x27;t use the different modes.  It comes with a nylon travel pouch (I prefer a plastic one for ease of clean, but not a deal breaker).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And a reminder for those replacing old toothbrushes, do make sure you remove the battery prior to disposal - be earth friendly!</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is awesome. It is a little pricey, but absolutely worth it. I am not a fan of electric brushes at all, used many, but by far this brush is the best. It leaves your teeth squeaky clean, and feels good while you use it. Does not damage gums, and it actually ramps up over 2 weeks to full power so that you are not jarred by its power. It&#x27;s also smaller than any I&#x27;ve used before. Pricey, but worth it.</li>
    <li> I have been using these brushes since 2000. My first one lasted 7 years and it was by far the simplest design and the best. Since my original one died I am now on my 3rd one, yup 3 newer Sonicares in the last 5 years. They still work great but there are 2 major flaws with them. First the new blue bristles that tell you when its time to change the brush head, mine always loses its blue in about 6 - 8 weeks, a far cry from the original brush head which lasted for 3 months. The brush is never even used up in 6-8 weeks you can feel the difference when its time to change the head. So ignore the blue. But my biggest complaint is the new design of the head. They used to make the head so the hard plastic case screwed onto the brush holder, which sealed out most of the toothpaste fallout from your mouth, which was a decent design. Now they make them so you just push them onto the base. My problem with this is that you get build up of nasty gook under the base, unless you are like me and remove the brush and rinse and dry it after each use. Even if you do, which I do, there is still a mold issue at the base where the white rubber seal encloses the metal tip. No mater how well I dry it or the fact that I wipe it clean after every use there is still a bit of mold that starts developing along the white rubber seal in the crevice. This bothers me to no end. There should not be mold or any sort of black build up especially if I am rinsing and drying it all the time. I started doing this with my newest one to see if the problem still happened and yes it does. So whereas I love the way my teeth feel when I am done brushing and I won&#x27;t switch back to a traditional brush I find the new design to be a major flaw and a big profit for Phillips. I am convinced they changed the design of the brush head so they can make more money by selling more heads sooner then necessary, but don&#x27;t buy into it, that new head should last for at least 3 months even if that blue is gone. The mold is another issue.issue.</li>
    <li> The Sonicare has a great 30 second interval so you make sure to spend enough time on all the places. When you use it for the first time you&#x27;ll wonder why you didn&#x27;t buy it earlier. If a $100 purchase saves you time, pain, and money at the dentist, then its a great investment!</li>
    <li> I liked the product a lot in the beginning.  My teeth felt cleaner and looked whiter.  Then it stopped vibrating.  I emailed Phillips, was under warantee, eventually got a head replacement - BUT this one has such a \\&quot;hair trigger\\&quot; that it&#x27;s impossible to complete a brushing without having it slip into other speeds or turning off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The solution seems quite simple to me: Move the controls down to the very bottom of the shaft.  A user will obviously need to grip it from the middle, right where they now have the controls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be shopping for a better product.</li>
    <li> It works so well that it took away the limestone that I had behind the lower teeth. Furthermore, it is very quiet.</li>
    <li> I replaced an Oral B Sonic toothbrush with the Philips Sonicare FlexCare.  I chose the FlexCare from reading reviews and am very pleased with it.  It does a great job cleaning and has more options than the Oral B that I was using.  I love the battery display.  A great feature, so you always know where you stand on battery and the battery lasts FOREVER!  I leave it off the charger except when the battery needs charging.  I got it December 1st and have only had to charge it once since the initial charging.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Has a very high quality feel. The highest quality feeling electric toothbrush out there.&lt;br /&gt;-A single battery charge lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;-Teeth feel really clean after brushing.&lt;br /&gt;-2 minute timer helps you time your session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Brushing can feel a bit too intense sometimes. Yes, your teeth feel very clean afterward, but I wonder if this toothbrush can be too rough on my gums/teeth sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;-The settings can be confusing and you have to read a not very user friendly black and white manual to figure things out.&lt;br /&gt;-A bit pricey.&lt;br /&gt;-Tooth brush refills aren&#x27;t cheap either.</li>
    <li> So I have had this tooth brush for about a month and it works great. It was delievered in the time frame specified. I like that it has a really good battery and I don&#x27;t have to charge to often. It cleans my teeth really well, and I love that it has a timer for when I am brushing, that way I don&#x27;t cut it short. My mouth feels really clean when I am done. I haven&#x27;t checked out the other brush head options for my model yet but plan to soon. I also like that the base holds more than one brush head so that when there is more than one user there is a place to store others brush heads, and the head have color rings so you don&#x27;t get confused as to which one is yours. I don&#x27;t like the fact that the base is sits kind of awkwardly on my sink top. I have a 30\\&quot; sink top with intergrated bowl and back splash, but part of that may be the outlet located in our bathroom. Anyway, I love this product and am making it work. That one issue is not that big of a deal to me. I bought this tooth brush because I don&#x27;t have dental insurance anymore. I wanted to minimalize the probability of getting cavities or having other teeth/gum issues as I am hitting my 30&#x27;s and a full time college student. I don&#x27;t have the money to have any work done if something goes wrong so I hoping this will suffice till I can get insurance again.</li>
    <li> The toothbrush works well but there is a (very) minor thing that drives me crazy about it.  When you put on the head, there is this weird space in-between the head and the brush.  No matter how much you push it down, it doesn&#x27;t go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worse than just being annoying, it creates mold.  If you don&#x27;t proactively clean the area once a week, mold will build up because of the moisture trapped there.  Gross!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(In addition, it&#x27;s too easy to push the buttons accidentally while you are brushing).  Bad design overall in so many ways!</li>
    <li> My rating is both for the brush and a most excellent customer service experience. My brush died after 8 months. I went to the online customer service portal - something I always dread in the &#x27;Information Age&#x27; - I was assisted immediately by a polite and efficient fellow who asked only a few questions then set me up with a replacement (with a pre-paid shipment label to send the old one back). Amazing! No B.S., no fine print. For this I would highly recommend this brush.</li>
    <li> This is a great product at a great price. I like the detachable heads and that they are cheaper than the prior model. Also, it is lighter than my two prior Sonicare models.</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush. I have been using this for months now but have no regrets about buying this one. I did my research and this one came out on top. You cannot go wrong with Philips!</li>
    <li> The brush does a good job of cleaning, and for this it deserves high marks.  However, the placement of the power button and mode adjustment button is HORRIBLE. During about half of my brushing sessions, I am inadvertently hitting the mode button - which slows down the brush - or hitting the power button - which turns it off.  These interruptions do not help keep my teeth clean!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a Sonicare user since 2005 and cannot imagine going back to a regular toothbrush. I like the variable brushing modes on the Flexcare but am not sure it is as durable as the basic model -- my first Sonicare lasted over 4 years. That being said this is a great purchase.</li>
    <li> Cons: None&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: quality product, works with the UV care care stand as a replacement toothbrush.  Great price on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comments: It&#x27;s hard to go back to the old way of brushing teeth.  I bought the HX6910 as a replacement to the HX6930 brush.  All features match, only difference is the color.</li>
    <li> My flexcare sonicare has hardly been used, but it&#x27;s so cheaply made that it&#x27;s not even effective anymore with limited use.  I purchased the device less than 2 years ago, but they are not honoring my warranty.  DO NOT BUY -- it&#x27;s false advertising.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the results I&#x27;m getting from this product. Within weeks after using the Sonicare FlexCare my dental provider commented on the improvement of my dental status...that in itself is reason to give it a high rating.</li>
    <li> This is the first time i have ever owned an electric toothbrush. Obviously I do not have any to compare this one to, but judging from how my teeth feel and look this past month, I&#x27;m totally impressed. Only bummer is that I wish I would have gotten one of these sooner!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t had one gum infection since beginning to use Sonicare brush. I&#x27;m sold on it to maintain good gum health.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Sonicare products for years and they have been very good.  I would recommend them to anyone who uses or wants to try this type of product.</li>
    <li> I chose this model rechargeable toothbrush this purchase because of the additional feature it offered.  This FlexCare brush allows you to select either a regular cycle or a longer brush/massage cycle. The longer cycle gives you an extra minute of brush time, which is enough time to thoroughly clean all mouth surfaces, including the tongue and the roof of your mouth. It gives you a true cleaning experience.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t be happier. It works great.</li>
    <li> I bought the Philips Sonicare FelxCare for myself about a year ago.  My wife borrowed it ocassionally and then asked for her very own.  The product is excellent.</li>
    <li> The Sonicare toothbrush set is a wonderful buy and priced right.  A visit to the dental hygienest will confirm the effects of brushing with this toothbrush. Remarkable results and so easy to use.  Thank you, Amazon.com</li>
    <li> Cleans thoroughly with a noticeable difference after the 1st use. It is simple to use. Light weight and comes with a travel case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it. I was introduced to Phillips Sonicare FlexCare a couple of years ago while in Europe where I travel often. I liked it so much that I bought  this one to use while in the US. I&#x27;ve used other power toothbrushes but none has done the job like Phillips Sonicare FlexCare.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve used Sonicare toothbrushes for years, on advice from my dental hygeinist long ago, and could never go back to regular manual brushing. I&#x27;ve tried it, i just can&#x27;t get my teeth as clean feeling.  I used the Braun initially, i liked it, no complaints.  This was many years ago.  Then i tried the Sonicare, i loved how it left my teeth feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were a few things i didn&#x27;t like about the Sonicare.  The main one, the worst thing, was the gunk that would build up inside the brush head, no matter how i tried to avoid it. It was high maintenance to keep it clean inside, and despite those efforts, periodically i would throw them away and get a new one because they became so nasty and i couldn&#x27;t get my fingers into all the places where the gunk built up to clean it out.  Needless to say, it was expensive to have to replace the whole toothbrush, maybe once a year or more, even though it still worked ok.&lt;br /&gt;i think this was really the only thing i didn&#x27;t like about that toothbrush--it was the Elite series model.  It was still worth it to me to replace them. I get plack inside my teeth, that&#x27;s why the hygienist recommended the Sonicare in the first place, and it really helps to reduce that, much better than using an old fashioned non electronic toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So--when i saw this new flex care model from Sonicare, i had to buy one on the spot even though i had come to the store (Bed Bath and Beyond)(coupons in hand) to just buy new brushes for my old Sonicare.  I love how it&#x27;s smaller and easily fits in the hand, it&#x27;s light, and it&#x27;s very powerful. It looks less obtrusive than the Elite. But best of all, it&#x27;s designed in a way so that there is no way for the brush to get any built up nasty gunk inside it.  It&#x27;s a simple small brush design that fits over the end of the handle, no mechanical parts, no dark damp compartment where things can grow. And the sterilizer is nice too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s clear enough that the Sonicare company wanted to make an advance in the quality of this product with this new design.  One of the known downfalls of this kind of tooth brush has been accumulation of bacteria and the dreaded gunk. I had searched the web for some kind of solution to this and found that it was a common problem.  It&#x27;s hard for me to imagine now how this design could be improved on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;as another review said, this tooth brush should be used with a very light touch, lightly holding the brush up against the teeth, the brush moves very fast and pressing down very hard will just interfere with what it does so well.  I find this difficult, i tend to want to press down more than is necessary. I think it&#x27;s probably not good for the motor.  But habitually i&#x27;ve tended to press down more than what would be best.  Again, it needs to be just lightly held against the surface of the tooth.

    <li> This item does it all at the push of a button.  I use it not only to clean my teeth but also for the gum massage function.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I had this same Sonicare toothbrush for a few years and then it eventually died on me so I had to buy a replacement one. I love the different settings on this brush (extra clean, sensitive etc) and it cleans very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest gripe is cleaning it when I remove the brush head - it&#x27;s hard to clean around the plastic/rubbery part that holds the metal pick to which the brush head attaches.</li>
    <li> Has many new features that the older Sonicare models didn&#x27;t have. I am very happy with this purchase. Not only is it invaluable for teeth cleaning, but it and it predecessor Sonicares have made a tremendous difference in the healthiness of my gums.</li>
    <li> the vibration is better designed to get between teeth-to-gums and teeth-to-teeth. oral b is more like a sanding machine and makes me concerned about enamel wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the color of this item is more of a light pastel green and not blue as on many images. it does come with only 1 head -- kind of skimpy there -- which is the standard \\&quot;pro\\&quot; size. if it were the compact size i doubt it would wrap around several teeth properly as this one does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a great thing is the deluxe charger. what this means is that there is a cap on it that allows you to stand up two brushes but if you remove the cap on the charger base, then it becomes travel compact, less than 2 inches wide! i really like that part of the design.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s face it, from the times our mothers insisted that we brush thoroughly, we have failed miserably. Electric toothbrushes have been on the market for many years, but most people don&#x27;t use them. Now a new generation of sonic toothbrush has hit the shelves. The real question are these toothbrushes going to replace the buck and a quarter manual brush on your sink?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The answer is surprising, they should. The Phillips Sonicare brush has three speeds, one for massaging gums, one for sensitive teeth and gums and one for cleaning. The instrument has a built in thirty second timer set so each quadrant gets a full thirty second treatment. It is a lot more convenient the egg timer my mother gave me in the sixties. On top of that it is hard to ignore. If you move to a new quadrant before the momentary pause, you tend to feel a bit guilty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the real test of this toothbrush is how your mouth will feel after using it. It is much like the sensation after a visit to the dental hygienist. When your dentist recommends this brush, follow the advice. You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> I think those who are looking for a lighter weight and smaller diameter handle will be pleased with this version. It cleans as well as the regular Sonicare, although it took me a few sessions to get used to less force and less time in brushing (I have the E9800)while using the initial program setting. This is also a very good brush for those w/ gum erosion or sensitive teeth. Since you can get the one w/ the santizer for only $10 more, I&#x27;d suggest that combo. I also have the regular Sonicare santizer which works well, but it also costs around $50, so the combo listed here is a better deal. I really think Philips has overtaken the electric toothbrush market for a few good reasons-quality brushes, desired features, durability, easy to find replacement heads, and THEY ARE the one brand recommended by the 2 different dentists&#x27; offices I have gone to in the past year.</li>
    <li> I want to stress that this brush works superbly.  My 3 stars are for the value/bang for your buck aspect of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used three other electric brushes besides this one.  One was a very early model Sonicare, the other two were Braun Oral-B models.  ALL of them worked great.  The three other brushes I&#x27;ve used have all had excellent durability.  And I never had a single cavity with any of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are really just two major differences between these two brands.  Brauns tend to have smaller heads and they have a kind of rotating pulsing motion.  Sonicare models have more of a vibration motion and, in my experience, tend to tickle a bit more.  Your mileage may vary.  In my experience, Braun brush heads also tend to be a little cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the electric toothbrush makers make claims about being the \\&quot;best.\\&quot;  However, as one major dental site commented, \\&quot;There are currently no studies that we are aware of that compare objectively electric toothbrushes. The choice is really a personal one.\\&quot;  If you look at multiple objective dental sources you&#x27;ll find the same kind of advice - choose according to your own preference, not the PR spin of the companies making the brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This specific model has 3 cleaning modes, 2 \\&quot;routine\\&quot; modes, 2 minute timer, a quad pacer (30 seconds per quarter of your mouth), and a few other lesser features.  The thing is, all of these exist on many other brushes, many of them about $50 (or more) cheaper  than this one.  If you&#x27;re looking for just a good electric brush then I can&#x27;t recommend this model.  For about $50 less you can get, for example, the Braun 8850 . . . or the Sonicare e5500, to name just two.  They both have most of the exact same features as this model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the exact same money you can get the Oral-B Triumph 9900 with Smart Guide.  That model tells you, graphically, when you&#x27;re brushing too hard (which causes major permanent gum damage) and when you need to replace the brush head.  Those are the kind of extras I&#x27;d be willing to pay for.  All the extra modes and timers I find to be a bit useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: This Sonicare model works and works well&lt;br /&gt;Cons: It&#x27;s over priced for the features.  There are better choices on the market.brush head.  Those are the kind of extras I&#x27;d be willing to pay for.

    <li> My wife and I have been using the Philips Sonicare Rechargeable Toothbrushes for several months. My wife has been using the model sans UV Sanitizer and has been pretty happy with it. The rechargeable base is interchangeable with the higher end model (which includes the Sanitizer), allowing my wife and I to share a unit (and give us more bathroom counter space). This particular model offers the same three modes of brushing that the higher model does. Initial setup involves plugging the base unit into an AC outlet and letting the brush charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush easily fits into its charging unit, and does a thorough job in cleaning our teeth and gums, especially in harder to reach places. The three modes are easy on sensitive teeth, and apply enough pressure to clean the gums without causing them to erode. The unit itself is easy to clean and maintain, and appears to be well thought out in terms of both holding the toothbrush, as well as placement of the mode buttons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is important to note that brush refills are on the expensive side, but, from our experience, the brushes themselves appear to last longer than conventional toothbrushes do. We very much like our Philips Sonicare toothbrushes and would recommend them to others wholeheartedly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Sonicare toothbrush for years because simply it cleans my teeth and gums really well and my dental hygienist can attest to that - better checkups since I started using it. My only complaint with the older models is that they were harder to clean. I did it anyway, but this one makes it a lot easier to clean AND easier to put the brush on and take it off. It&#x27;s also lighter and has more options for different brushing modes if you like those. So glad I bought the new model!</li>
    <li> After careful consideration and research, I decided to get this toothbrush over any other Sonicare. I&#x27;m not disappointed at all! I was thinking of getting the UV light, but in the end, you have to replace the brush heads so it&#x27;s unnecessary. I couldn&#x27;t feel the increase in power over 7 days though. I didn&#x27;t feel it was too rough or that I had to get used to it. I felt so clean after the first use. My husband uses it too, just changes out the brush and it comes with different colored rings to help you distinguish whose is whose. The only thing is it has been 3 months and certain areas are not getting clean anymore but it may be time to change the brush head.  I also use it on my tongue for a few seconds and it doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
    <li> Really like the multiple setting options...very effective toothbrush, does a good job cleaning and doesn&#x27;t take up much space.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a replacement for a Sonicare with UV Sanitizer (which had the same toothbrush handle with settings) that didn&#x27;t last 4 months. Hope the battery lasts longer on this one.</li>
    <li> This is the second Phillips Sonicare toothbrush I&#x27;ve owned - the first one lasted less than one year and the second (this model) lasted only five months.  In both cases, the power \\&quot;wand\\&quot;, onto which the brush attaches, broke away from the motor.  Two strikes and Phillips is out.  Ordered an Oral-B as a replacement.</li>
    <li> I have used Philips Sonicare toothbrushes for years. I like this one the best because of its portability and slim style. It does a great job on cleaning teeth</li>
    <li> After a recent visit to dentist I was under a dilemma whether to purchase  Sonicare Flex care or Oral B 3000. I believe that I have made a great choice. It literally knocks out food particles which my previous  spin brush did not ever do. I could even feel that clean polished finish with my tongue. I was always under the impression that a spinning action would give a better cleaning but I was wrong and don&#x27;t let the small soft bristled brush fool you.&lt;br /&gt;Just select the GoCare mode and you are on the road to healthy  teeth cleaning process. It was  love at first touch. I just registered the product and I got 6 months extra warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:-&lt;br /&gt;Just came back from the dentist, my hygienist was impressed at the way my teeth stayed clean after it was cleaned a couple of weeks  ago. Thanks to flossing and SONICARE.. and she went on saying she&#x27;s an easy person to impress even with clean teeth. I just smiled back with my clean 32 thinking in the back of my head...if she was 15 years younger..&lt;br /&gt;Long story short this one bring the smile back. I have noticed the difference in a week</li>
    <li> Sonicare FlexCare R910 made a huge mistake releasing this toothbrush.  I have had two different models before and never had a problem.  This electric toothbrush is a piece of junk the buttons are too high on the handle where you hold it so I am constantly changing the mode.  This brush is extreemly loud, and mine is now acting up and not working properly.  DO NOT BUY!</li>
    <li> My wife purchased the Sonicare FlexCare toothbrush for me nearly two years ago.  It has substantially improved my teeth and gum health.  I was so impressed with the quality and effectiveness of this product that I purchased one for my in-laws.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product for those who want to take good care of their teeth and gums.  Our family dentist, without knowing we switched to this toothbrush, began telling my wife and me how healthy our gums looked and how little plaque was building up on our teeth.  Using his toothbrush gives you a clean and fresh feel in your mouth as if you had a professional clean by a dental hygienist, every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to doing an outstanding job of cleaning your teeth, removing plaque and caring for your gums, the toothbrush is sturdy, easy to clean and shows no signs of wearing out (even though the same unit has been used every day for 2 years by me and my wife).  When our FlexCare is at the end of it&#x27;s useful life, we will certainly replace it with another Sonicare toothbrush.  We think it&#x27;s wise money spent for your oral health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also recommend using Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe &amp; Save service to purchase new brush heads.  The service is efficient, care-free and the pricing is excellent.</li>
    <li> This is my second flexcare toothbrush and I love it just like the first.  I tried a couple of others in between and didn&#x27;t care for them at all.  It&#x27;s small handle fits my hand and the whole thing is easy to keep clean. Perfect!</li>
    <li> I was in the market for an electric toothbrush and after some searching I decided on the Sonicare line.  I figured $100 would be the perfect price point to get towards the top of the line without spending too much.  After a few uses I&#x27;m very happy with my decision.  There is a big difference between the results of a regular toothbrush and the Sonicare.  If your in the market for a new toothbrush I recommed this model.</li>
    <li> Small brush head so you can get all the way in the back. Much better than crest spinbrush pro from duane reade</li>
    <li> I really like the timer. My old Sonicare didn&#x27;t have a timer so I would end up brushing too fast not doing a good enough job. Now I get every part of my mouth with an even amount of brushing. Also it doesnt get as dirty as my old one. A really great toothbrush.</li>
    <li> As with previous Sonicare toothbrushes, I am quite happy.  I especially like the feature of \\&quot;Quick Clean\\&quot;--a one minute option for when you just want to freshen up.  I find I brush much more often.  As always, Amazon was very quick to send the purchase to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MB</li>
    <li> I floss daily, but each checkup at the dentist ends up with a lot of plaque cleaning and hints that I buy a Sonicare brush.  So I bought this model after looking at the reviews. After one week I am very impressed. I see now how the super high vibration with the very small tip of the toothbrush can clean the gum line effectively. I use the setting that allows 30 seconds for each quadrant of teeth before transmitting a little beep. Still floss as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Downside is that foamy toothpaste tends to dribble out of my mouth while I get each and every toothe. It&#x27;s also expensive (but hopefully worth it).</li>
    <li> The Sonicare FlexCare was recommended by my hygienist for cleaning and messaging my gums. After using, my teeth felt clean and smooth. I really like being able to choosing different modes and speeds. I also like the size of the new FlexCare. Easy to use and clean after brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon had the best price and fast delivery. Very happy with Amazon.</li>
    <li> You&#x27;ve decided to invest in a good toothbrush - but do you really want to spend this kind of cash on a toothbrush every year? After 12 months of use, my unit&#x27;s battery has become so weak that every single time I use the brush the &#x27;recharge me&#x27; light blinks - even if I&#x27;m just using it for 20 seconds. So the charger is always plugged in on the counter, and my husband and I alternate charging the darn things every day and night just to get our 2 minutes of brushing in.  I like the way it cleans my teeth, although the horrible smell when you change the brush heads - and the evil slime that builds up in there - is disquieting. I&#x27;d try Oral B next time.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve had the Flexcare toothbrush for about 2 months now.  The biggest improvement (over the Sonicare Elite one we had) is that it is quieter and brushes with less force (though it is said to be more effective in tests for plaque removal).  I also like the slimmer handle,the smaller head and lighter weight.  A negative is there are several choices for brushing mode and there is the chance you will accidentally change to another mode without knowing it by hitting the wrong button.</li>
    <li> My dental hygienist says best model on the market.  I have to agree.  Curved brush does a great job.  Fantastic product.</li>
    <li> I had never used or owned an electric toothbrush before I bought this one, and I feel in love as soon as I used it with my Spry toothpaste... I feel like I just left the dental office each and every time that I brush my teeth... I have been super happy with my toothbrush.. My son even uses is (different head of course) but he has used it since he was two years old...</li>
    <li> I have had this toothbrush for 3 years and this morning it finally died. I brushed twice a day and only charged it when the battery was low. Shortly after 2 years the selector button to change mode broke, luckily i was stuck in normal clean mode. This made the Flexcare Sonicare into a lowly HX6511. Shortly thereafter I began having problems with the main button. The problems seem water related which to me is inexcusable in a toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this because of the high price and the poor durability.</li>
    <li> I have had my new Sonicare Flexcare for several months now and I am very pleased with it&#x27;s performance. After my original Sonicare bit the dust after a long 10 year lifespan, I simply had to purchase another. This one cleans your teeth very well. The handle is more slender than my original and really makes it easier to hold and not as heavy. I like the newer batterycharging stand. Easier to clean and not as bulky looking. You won&#x27;t be disappointed with it. I rate it a 10 star product and highly recommend to everyone!</li>
    <li> The SoniCare toothbrush has a range of sonic vibration intensities so that it can be adjusted to the vibration intensity you need and made stronger of softer for your wife or husband. It is also an improvement over older models in that cleaning is easy with just a water rise, The older models had lots of places for junk to accumulate.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this sonicare toothbrush.  It does an excellent job cleaning the teeth and I like the features.  Would highly reccommend to anyone.  Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I suspect most of the people reviewing this product wrote the review before they had to change the brush.  I bought a 3-pack of replacement heads with the main unit, after a couple of months it was time to change the head.  The instructions say pull the old one off, push the new one on.  Seems simple enough, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not so much.  The new head didn&#x27;t feel firmly connected and fell off when brushing.  I tried twisting, pushing hard, you name it.  Eventually I found some online forums that said replacement heads were sometimes defective so I tried another.  It was a little tighter but still fell off during the first brushing.  I tried the third, same thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m now stuck with a base unit without a brush head.  I refuse to buy yet another replacement pack so I&#x27;m going to try Oral B instead.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product, you&#x27;ll get to use it until you need to replace the brush and then it&#x27;s useless.</li>
    <li> Very nice product, so far it work well. Keept the brush in your mouth otherwise will splash all over. I have seen some improvement with the gingivtis.</li>
    <li> Purchased these for my entire family, great toothbrush and very good for traveling (battery easily lasted a week and would last another week without a problem I am sure).</li>
    <li> Every time I go to see my dental hygienist, she comments on how clean my teeth are and healthy gums are.  The Phillips Sonicare does a great job!</li>
    <li> The travel case does not prevent the toothbrush from switching on in your bag at airports.&lt;br /&gt;The travel case offers no protection from damage due to pressure from other objects (such as when packed in a bag).&lt;br /&gt;Compared to solid plastic cases, it offers no protection.&lt;br /&gt;It describes the travel case as a luxury travel case. I see no signs of luxury in the design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose this product over other entries in amazon due to the inclusion of a travel case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the toothbrush itself, the battery is not replaceable.&lt;br /&gt;There are several modes, you only need one. It operates identically to their cheaper models.&lt;br /&gt;The profit margin on these toothbrushes must be huge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush cleans your teeth well.</li>
    <li> You&#x27;ll never want to use a regular toothbrush again.  This toothbrush really makes your mouth feel clean and fresh.  It has a massage setting that is great for your gums.  I like the ease of changing brush heads.  You simply pull off one and slip on the other.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My wife says, \\&quot;Amazing\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After two brushings (night/day), we both agree that our teeth still feel smoother/cleaner from the morning brushing over 12 hours ago. We are both looking forward to brushing our teeth again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After owning for two brushings, I would think that any model Sonicare would clean better than any normal tooth brush that I have ever used. I purchased this one because of the massage/sensitive feature, just in case we needed it, which I don&#x27;t feel we do after using it, but I don&#x27;t regret the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reviews I&#x27;ve read say to get a model that uses the \\&quot;new\\&quot; brush heads due to price and cleaning. That would be my minimum requirement on a repeat purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe the more expensive ones clean better, but we are very very happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update- glad we got the sensitive, my wife doesn&#x27;t like the other setting</li>
    <li> When I was using the Sonicare in an area in my mouth with deep pockets, I was using too much pressure. I was trying too hard. It was making the area tender. My dentist said that if I continued, my gums would have started to recede and in time the bone would have started to shrink. He said that it was a good product (and I agree) but be careful of the pressure. Just let it set against your teeth and move it along when its time.&lt;br /&gt;The only negative I have is that I can&#x27;t just turn it on without using one of the timed choices.</li>
    <li> I had the original Sonicare for years.  I came to Amazon to get the brush refill.  I decided to check the reviews &amp; was SO glad I looked.  It was recommended to buy this Sonicare Flexcare version instead.  I am SO happy with everything about it.  The cleaning movement is FAR better, it feels like I&#x27;m at the dentist, getting a SUPERIOR clean.  But, by far, the BEST part is the new design keeps the brush itself very clean.  Wonderful design, no gummy inside to get grossed-out by!</li>
    <li> Wow. What a toothbrush, what an experience. I enjoy this gadget every day. So does my wife. Mine was purchased b4 my wife&#x27;s and has shown signs of wear (see pic attached). The other one has not shown any signs of wear. The brushes are super durable. The charge lasts &amp;#34;forever&amp;#34; and the charger charges the battery overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 30/12/2005 - added pics that show the cord wrap feature of the charger</li>
    <li> After hearing from my dentist how much better my gums are since I started using this Sonic Toothbrush, I never plan to go back to a normal toothbrush.</li>
    <li> This is my second Soniocare. The first on lasted 2 months beyond the warranty date. But it works so well that I am going to try again. Seems like an $80 toothbrush should last more than 2 years. Especailly since it costs about $30 a year for replacement brushes for a single user. It looks, handles and performs great. Longevity is my only complaint.</li>
    <li> Very happy with my Sonicare toothbrush. I&#x27;ve never felt like my teeth were so clean - I can&#x27;t believe I ever used a regular toothbrush. I wish the replacement heads weren&#x27;t so expensive, but overall, it&#x27;s totally worth the money. I rarely have to charge the toothbrush - that is a huge plus for me.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my daughter who has severe problems with her teeth due to radiation treatments.&lt;br /&gt;She loves the toothbrush and feels that it is making a difference in her oral care.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I decided to switch from a regular toothbrush to this gem without looking back. The first time you use it, it feels like you just had a cleaning. There are different settings to choose from, and the slim design fits well in your hand. This toothbrush will hold a charge like anything i&#x27;ve ever seen. This toothbrush does an amazing job and I couldn&#x27;t imagine going back to a manual. My hygienist has remarked about the positive changes in my mouth after switching to this brush. The only drawback is the price.</li>
    <li> I had used an Oral B Rechargeable for years and my dentist convinced me to buy the Phillips Sonicare Flexcare. He said the Flexcare was an improvement over the previous Sonicare models and he uses this new one as well. He was absolutely correct. I especially like the battery life of 2 weeks on a full charge, for travel. AND, there is a very nice hard case for travel with this as well. I think the description said a \\&quot;soft case\\&quot; but that is just not correct. It has a durable, nice travel case. Also, the larger- standard brush is great. I went ahead and ordered three to have here. I don&#x27;t care for the smaller- compact brush head, it is just too small in my opinion... This brush cleans VERY well, feels great, and is a pleasure to use. It is also a little smaller, more compact than the high-end Oral B as well. I like the brush-action of this one much better than the Oral B and most clinical studies (I have an Master of Science in Health Admin.,,show me the evidence etc.) I found and reviews showed a little to moderate advantage of the Sonic Flexcare for preventing tarter buildup and overall cleaning vs. the Oral B.. I can NOT recommend this enough. A close friend of mine that&#x27;s a Hygenist also recommended this one and said not to spend the extra money on the Ultraviolet (UV) model, just extra money etc. etc. and not needed. I am PLEASED, get it, you will be also...</li>
    <li> I purchase a lot of stuff on Amazon, but never cared to take the time to leave a review before. But I&#x27;m so pleased with this toothbrush it has prompted me to leave my first review. I purchased this product on January 21, 2010 and it is still going strong! Not having dental insurance, I try to do everything I can at home to take care of my teeth and cut down on potential dental costs. When I started using this toothbrush, I had some tartar build up on my back molars. Yes, tartar,not plaque. The hardened, calcified stuff. Within six months of using the Sonicare FlexCare toothbrush (used in combination with Colgate Tartar Control toothpaste - don&#x27;t know if that made any difference), without any visits to the dentist, that tartar was gone and I was amazed! This is the first sonic toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used so I can&#x27;t compare it to any others, but I have been nothing but pleased with the way it works. A truly great product!</li>
    <li> I bought 2 of these toothbrushes and both quit working within 2 years. My Oral B toothbrush I have had over 5 years is still working. I am researching what to get for my boys but I can&#x27;t forget that these didn&#x27;t work for very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would rather have this vibrating action than the circular motion of the Oral B but I hate to spend so much money and take the chance it will stop working. My dentist&#x27;s assistant suggests getting this toothbrush again because she thinks they are the best to get (or a similar model).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the brushes simply quit charging and the other will only make a humming sound, although it does charge.</li>
    <li> I began to experience gum recession and on the advice of my dentist and my friend who had a similar problem and had to get gum grafts (yowza), I bought this. It&#x27;s been great. It cleans well, the charge lasts for several weeks, and my gum issues haven&#x27;t gotten any worse.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush performs very well. I use it multiple times a day for the last 3 months. I bought this brand because of the recommendation of my dental hygienist. My teeth seem to be very clean compared to the manual brushes I have used in the past. I like the features of this toothbrush, especially the timer that prompts when to move to the next quadrant  of my teeth. I also like the various optional operating modes although I rarely use them. I occasionally accidentally touch the off switch but now I hold the brush differently and seem to avoid this problem. This brush has exceeded my expectations. The price was right also.</li>
    <li> great brush for travel! The charge truly lasts for 10 days which is the longest I have tested it for and it was still going strong.</li>
    <li> Worked great for three years. Husband&#x27;s dentist was wowed by the difference in his teeth.  I&#x27;m thinking it should have lasted over three years, but i&#x27;m ordering a replacement nevertheless.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product.  I received it very quickly, and it was packaged properly.</li>
    <li> I really like Sonicare, but this one is the best one I have had yet.  Great size, a little smaller than earlier versions and much easier to travel with.</li>
    <li> THis is my second Sonic Toothbrush.  It does a great job.  It&#x27;s easy to use, and is well designed.  I wouldn&#x27;d hesitate to buy another.</li>
    <li> I freaking love this thing. The first time I used this I couldn&#x27;t believe how smooth and clean my teeth and mouth felt. I was really as if I had just left the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little strange at first, but you get used to the sensation. I also love that it has a timer on it, so you spend just the right amount of time on each section of your mouth. (And according to this timer, I was never brushing for long enough with a manual toothbrush.) I would recommend this brush to everyone. My mouth doesn&#x27;t ever have an \\&quot;I just ate\\&quot; film on it like it used to throughout the day. Always so fresh and so clean, clean.</li>
    <li> AS AN ACCOMPLISHED PROFESSIONAL A GREAT SMILE IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME. I HAVE BEEN VISITING MY AUTHODONTIST FOR APPROX 1 YEAR FOR INVISALINE TREATMENT TO IMPROVE THAT SMILE. DURING ONE OF MY VISITS THE ASSISTANT POINTED ME TOWARDS AN AD POSTED IN HER OFFICE IT WAS THE SONICARE TOOTHBRUSH. SHE EXPLAINED THAT THIS WOULD INCREASE MY ABILITY TO KEEP MY DENTAL HYGIENE AT ITS BEST, SHE WAS ABSOLUTLY CORRECT. SHORTLY AFTER YOU START USING THIS ITEM YOU WILL FEEL THE DIFFERENCE IN THE SURFACE OF YOU TEETH AND IT MOTIVATES YOU TO USE IT MORE OFTEN WITH SPECTACULAR RESULTS.THANKS TO AMAZON FOR OFFERING THIS ITEM ON SALE.THANKS PLEASANTLY SURPRISED D. JOHNSON.</li>
    <li> This is the third Sonicare toothbrush I have purchased either for myself or other family members. The first was purchased a bit more than two years ago and is still going strong-after being used at least twice each day. Another lasted a little over a year for my wife before it started having problems charging and turning off- had to knock off two stars for that. To be fair, her toothbrush developed a slight tear in the brush stub seal, so that may have allowed moisture to enter the handle body. Still, the seal failure should not have occurred from daily use. I am careful to keep the handle clean and dry, so perhaps that helps even if the sealing is imperfect. I also let the battery run down until the brush ceases operating- then I fully recharge it (takes about a full day) before putting away the charger.  I easily get two weeks of daily use (minimum twice a day, three on weekends) before it requires another recharge, and that is with using it in the full clean mode. By the way, I found a place on E bay where you can get a replacement battery if/when you need one. Just perform a search for \\&quot;Sonicare FlexCare\\&quot; and you should be able to find it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why did I state that &#x27;the results are worth it&#x27;? I had changed dental insurance companies and therefore dentists. Because of that, professional teeth cleaning was put off for a year and a half. My new dentist remarked how clean my teeth were (this was after using the Sonicare toothbrush for that entire time period) and noted how improved my scores were over the previous cleaning record (I do keep track). My previous dentist always wanted to perform cleaning three times a year due to plaque buildup. Could simply be due to the differences in the professional staffing, but I tend to doubt it.</li>
    <li> About ten years ago, I bought a twofer, Sonicare Elite, at Costco and still have one of them, as a back-up, if I ever have to get my new Sonicare FlexCare repaired.  This new R910 Sonicare Flexcare is a treat to use:  It is now, very lightweight and more hygienic because of the improved design of the head, eliminating the old, screw-down collar that collected moisture and got real grungy.  The new shaft has a lightweight, rubber grip.  And, you don&#x27;t have to hold it in your palm, like a baseball bat, but between your fingertips, more like a flute. (I also discovered that there is a small, plastic sheet from the factory, over the control face, which can be removed, just like the plastic sheet over the microwave panel when it&#x27;s just out of the box.)  I especially like the variable brushing settings, from \\&quot;regular\\&quot; to \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; to \\&quot;massage\\&quot;.  Personally, I like to brush for 2-4 minutes and then do a massage on the gums for another 2 minutes.  The charging base is smaller and lighter, along with a space, (when you remove the bottom cover), to wrap the cord, when traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I only accidentally hit the power button, once.  If you&#x27;ve, previously, had an Elite, it may take you a few days to get used to the new narrow, lightweight design.</li>
    <li> My Sonicare FexCare model lasted only 2 years before failing.  My previous Sonicare (E-series) was still working well after 5 years when I inadvertently left it in a hotel.  The quality of Sonicare toothbrushes appears to have declined, and I refuse to pay $250 for another model Sonicare that may last no longer than the FlexCare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A disappointed customer who used to swear by Sonicare procducts.</li>
    <li> Ive never been a fan of the tooth brushing routine.  This toothbrush makes it fun and worthwhile!  My teeth feel like they have just been cleaned by the dentist...year round!</li>
    <li> I bought my Sonicare on the advice of my dental hygienist in Dec., 2008. It worked very well for 2 years.  I loved the way it cleaned my teeth and I never had any trouble with brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I did not understand that the battery was not replaceable.  After 2 years, just out of warranty, it ceased to hold a charge.  Philips has offered me a 15% discount on a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot afford to spend $125.00 on a new toothbrush every 2 years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I&#x27;ve given it 3 stars because it cleans well, but does not last long.</li>
    <li> We have used Oral B rotary type electric toothbrushes for years- I have a 7 year old daughter and wanted to try something for her. This toothbrush is great becasue it has a small head and it really works great- just like when they use the ultrasonic brush at the dentist&#x27;s. I am buying one for myself. I bought extra heads so I  could share my daughter&#x27;s but after I puuled them off a few times, one started to separate- I don&#x27;t think the brush heads are designed to be taken off frequently.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo2U1H2QBOB6J5]]I did a lot of research on which toothbrush to get. After much reading I got this one and now I&#x27;m regretting it. I just sits in the cradle and refuses to charge. No matter how clean I get the charger or which outlet I use. Then it started making a weird half-on/half-off humming sound. The buttons no longer work to adjust from clean to sensitive, etc. I&#x27;m worried Philips is going to give me a hard time on the return - I&#x27;ve read that they do. After spending over a hundred bucks I just want something that works for at least a few years. Frustrating.</li>
    <li> A couple months ago I went out of town and just took a regular tooth brush. After using my Sonicare for so long a regular tooth brush seemed like I wasn&#x27;t even brushing my teeth. Never again will I go out of town without my Sonicare.</li>
    <li> Good points:  It cleans very well, is fairly quiet, charges quickly, and a charge lasts over a week with two of us using the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad point: The first handle failed mechanically in about a year--it buzzed, but the brush didn&#x27;t move.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Philips replaced it.  The second handle failed electronically in about a year; the charge indicator lights went out, and the handle wouldn&#x27;t recharge.  Call placed to Philips and resolution pending.</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no patience for trying to time my toothbrushing sessions, but with this brush I don&#x27;t have to worry about it. It is set to time each quadrant of your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Max Care setting is for the dentist recommended amount of time to brush your teeth. I usually use that one, but for those times when I am on the go, there is also Go Care, which is a faster setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can even turn off the brush during the sessions so that you can spit when you need to and it will pick up where you left off! I didn&#x27;t know it did this for about the first couple of weeks I had it! I thought it had to stay on the whole time or it would start the timer over, lol!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each session takes you through clean, sensitive and massage settings. If you don&#x27;t want to brush your teeth on a timer, you can also choose one of those settings individually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you keep it plugged in all the time, the charge can last you a while. I went on a cruise recently for four days and didn&#x27;t bring the charger (although it&#x27;s small enough to not be a big deal to bring along!), but the brush lasted me the whole weekend, without plugging it in!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love that it doesn&#x27;t take up much room on my sink, the stand/charger is small, and the design of both the stand and the brush is very sleek. It also comes with a plastic cover to put over your brush when it&#x27;s not in use. And a cute travel case to take your brush with you (does not carry the carger, only the brush), I can even fit a travel-size Sensodyne Pronamel toothpaste in the case too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this brush!</li>
    <li> I had no problems at all. The price was the best I found. It was easy to order, and I received it in just a few days from placing the order. I received it in the orginial package and I been using it and loving it. I use to use a Oral B rechargeable toothbrush, but this one is 100% better.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, this unit failed after 7 months of use.  The shaft went on it (wobbly).  I bought a second unit and had the same failure in 6 months.  Stay away from this model.  Unfortunely, there is a design problem.  I have used Sonicare tooth brushes in the past without these design problems.  Suggest you buy an older model (Essence model can be found at Costco) that is tried and true.  This model is a tremendous disappointment.</li>
    <li> I bought this Sonicare toothbrush less than a year ago. The head that it came with died within 2 months. After I put on the replacement head, I found it difficult to clean. It began to grow some dark mold (or something like that) on the base and then it crept into the space between the head and the base and actually infected the rubber. I&#x27;m going back to an earlier version which lasted me a long time and sure was a whole lot cheaper.</li>
    <li> I really liked this toothbrush while it lasted, but then it just died at about the year mark.  If I&#x27;m paying $120 for a toothbrush, I expect it to last longer than that.  If I could open the toothbrush and replace the battery (which I am guessing is the problem,) then it wouldn&#x27;t be so bad, but it&#x27;s impossible to access the battery without breaking the casing.  I was disappointed since it was my first electric toothbrush and now I&#x27;m debating whether I should go back to the standard model.</li>
    <li> The brushes worked exceptionally well, and for that reason I paid their premium.  HOWEVER, they break.  This is my second try with Sonicare, I thought maybe they upped their quality with all these positive reviews.  I was wrong.  They made it smaller, added some more buttons, but is still breaks too soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This flexcare one first broke within the warranty period and they sent me a new one.  The replacement broke 1 month after the warranty ended and they refused to replace it again.  Now I have two landfill hazards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For what these cost, they should go like the energizer bunny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m now in search of an alternative to Sonicare, I suggest you do the same.  And if more people rate this low for breaking, maybe they will improve their product.  Like I said, when it works its great, but it should last.</li>
    <li> Philips Sonicare FlexCare Rechargeable Sonic ToothbrushBe detailed and specific. What would you have wanted to know before you purchased the product?&lt;br /&gt;Not too short and not too&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;very  good i recommend</li>
    <li> Was a gift for my son who stills loves and uses it!</li>
    <li> Thank you! teeth could not be happier.</li>
    <li> This is the third electric toothbrush I have tried in the last year and this one stands heads and shoulders over the other two.  The first I tried was the [[ASIN:B000V4O1UA Ultreo Ultrasound Toothbrush]] which always felt awkward and replacement heads were expensive and not in my local stores.  On the other hand, the Phillips Sonicare just seemed to fit the first time.  Perhaps I am more adjusted to the feel of electric toothbrushes, but this one did not feel like I was brushing with a tennis racket.  Also, replacement brushes are readily available and reasonably priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second brush I tried was the cheaper [[ASIN:B00132FUNG Waterpik Sensonic Professional Toothbrush]], which I was very happy with it.  But a few friends kept raving about their Sonicares so I figured I better try one. The Sonicare probably costs twice what the Waterpik costs but it&#x27;s worth it.  It was kind of like driving a BMW when you are used to driving a PT Cruiser.  The Waterpik was good and got the job done, but this brush just had a feel of quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush also has some great features, like the quick brushing, and although I didn&#x27;t try it, there was a setting to ease new users into the world of electric toothbrushes. I have to say I&#x27;m am not that into the whistles and bells, I just wanted my teeth brushed, and I feel this brush was noticibly better than the other two.  It&#x27;s a well constructed, effective brush and my first recomendation to anyone looking for a brush. If you want a cheaper brush, I was happy with the Waterpik, but I would lean toward spending the extra.</li>
    <li> The Sonicare Flexcare brush is certainly the most effective cleaner/massager I have ever used.  I bought it at the repeated urging of my dentist.  I had been using an Oral B electric, which was effective.  Indeed I was quite satisfied until I started with the Sonicare.  It gets into more spaces, loosens debris better and maintains gums better than a rotating brush.  I use a saline solution (1%) only - no toothpaste - and my teeth come out literally squeaky clean in two minutes of brushing.  I have only had it for a few months, but I have had zero problems.</li>
    <li> I had an elite model but this is much better.  First it has spots for multiple heads which allows more than one person to use the device.  It does a great job of cleaning your teeth and has some nice options/features that improve upon the prior elite model.</li>
    <li> After two minutes with this thing in the morning, my teeth feel clean all day. It took some getting used to this (I was had been using an Oral-B, and the movement of the brush head is completely different) but ultimately, I find using this brush more soothing--and more effective. Isn&#x27;t that the perfect combination?</li>
    <li> Was using a medium vs. soft hand tooth brush, either a Oral B or Reach. This only has a soft bristle but with this product you only notice an improvement. I have many eroded enamel areas near the gum line which were tender with normal brushing. Tenderness has resolved and teeth feel similar to hygienist&#x27;s cleaning results. Fewer episodes of \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; getting stuck between my teeth. Yes it does automatically turn off after 3 minutes but just turn it on again and away you go.  It will be interesting to see what my checkup will show when I see the dentist again.</li>
    <li> I have used SOnicare for a long time but this new one is the best I can recomend it to everyone&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GIveit a try and you be pleased</li>
    <li> I have been using Sonicare Toothbrushes for years and when I needed a replacement there was only one logical solution..Buy a new Sonicare..  I love this brush and it really does a great job removing plague too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using an older Sonicare model, the \\&quot;Essence 5300\\&quot; on which the switch was beginning to go out.  I decided to upgrade to a Flexcare model and am very glad I did.  The Flexcare has been a great improvement all around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-New Lighter, Slimmer Handle&lt;br /&gt;This is probably the first thing you&#x27;ll notice if you&#x27;re coming from an older Sonicare handle, and it is a very welcome improvement.  The FlexCare handle is small and feels much better in the hand than my old bulky 5300 handle.  The unit is actually longer than my old brush, but that&#x27;s not a big deal at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-New ProResults Brush Head system&lt;br /&gt;The new heads are great.  Sonicare moved the tuning fork from the head to the handle, which means smaller brush heads than on the old models.  A 3 pack of the new heads is the same price as a 2 pack of the old heads, making them actually a better deal for a superior product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-No More Crud in the Handle!&lt;br /&gt;The biggest problem with my old brush was that old toothpaste/drool/water tended to collected in the space where the handle connects to the brush head.  It would get all moldy and gross if you didn&#x27;t clean it out regularly.  Thankfully, this problem is completely gone with the Flexcare handles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Lithium Ion Batteries&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve waited a long time for Sonicare to upgrade from inferior NiCd batteries, and they finally have.  With Lithium Ion, you don&#x27;t have to worry about battery capacity decreasing over time, or a memory effect.  The new batteries charge faster, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Quadpacer&lt;br /&gt;This is basically a beep that goes off every 30 seconds while brushing, reminding you to switch to a new area of your mouth.  It has appeared in previous models (not my 5300 though), and is nice if you&#x27;ll use it, but I tend to go at my own pace as I focus more on problem areas in my mouth and less on others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-5 Total Brushing Modes/Routines&lt;br /&gt;There are 3 selectable \\&quot;modes\\&quot;: clean mode: (2 minutes broken into 30 second segments), sensitive (a \\&quot;gentler\\&quot; clean mode) and massage (the brush pulsates for gum stimulation).  Go Care Routine shortines the standard 2 minute clean mode to 1 minute, while Max Care is a longer, 3 minute cycle that includes both clean and massage mode.  I set the brush on clean mode and tend not to use the other options, but some may find them useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-More Environmentally Friendly&lt;br /&gt;Although buying a new product of any sort will always have a negative environmental footprint, these new brushes are better than the old models due to their Li-Ion batteries, reduced bulk, and lower waste in the smaller replacement brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Price&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s be clear on this: a Sonicare toothbrush is a luxury product.  You&#x27;re paying a lot more up front, and you get to keep paying more every time you buy replacement heads.  Surprisingly, heads for Flexcare units are actually a cheaper than the older models; you get 3 Flexcare heads for the same price as 2 of the old heads.  The per head price is still several times what it would cost to buy a new manual brush; but for me the superior cleaning is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Noise&lt;br /&gt;-Flexcare models are louder than older models.  I&#x27;m not sure why this is, and supposedly vibration has been reduced in exchange, but the noise can be too much for some.  The UV sanitizer also makes a quiet electric \\&quot;hum\\&quot; when plugged in with the door closed, even if the UV bulb isn&#x27;t run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Buttons can be depressed while brushing&lt;br /&gt;A couple of people have complained about accidentally hitting 1 of the 2 buttons on the handle while brushing.  It hasn&#x27;t happened to me, but for completeness I&#x27;ll include this as a possible con.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush is a vast improvement over my previous brush, and has fixed most of the problems I had without introducing any significant new ones.  The fact that replacement brush heads are actually cheaper than on my old brush is a big plus.  I highly recommend the Flexcare brushes as a great upgrade to any toothbrush, electric or manual, that you&#x27;re currently using.</li>
    <li> I was used to the E series. Those heads had to go every 2 months for me.They wouldn&#x27;t even last the 3 months as claimed. This brush head is STILL WORKING FINE. I don&#x27;t get it, but I still have the extra brush heads that came with the unit. As I said before it is light, easy to clean and very maneuverable. I can&#x27;t imagine any improvement!</li>
    <li> Best tooth brush I ever had</li>
    <li> This is the best toothbrush I have ever used and bought one for my husband after enjoying mine so thoroughly.&lt;br /&gt;After just 6 months of using this toothbrush instead of a manual, my reqular dental cleaning showed just a minor fraction (10-15%?) of the tartar and buildup that I previously had at my 6 monthly cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price on Amazon was amazing and shipment was lightning fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The base design is so clever!  The tiny travel charger slips underneath and inside a slightly larger base (although still a small footprint), creating a more stable support for everyday countertop use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only potentially non-positive comment I have on the toothbrush is that there are too many different functions, if you are the kind of person that chooses one and sticks to it.  It certainly doesn&#x27;t detract from the amazing way the brush works and, at Amazon&#x27;s low low price, I didn&#x27;t even bother to look for a toothbrush with fewer functions.  With that said, I do appreciate additional programs such as &#x27;GoCare&#x27; - the quick touch-up brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will never regret buying this toothbrush.  Our whole family has converted!!</li>
    <li> The person who comments on my review is correct. There is an \\&quot;EasyStart\\&quot; mode for new users. You simply put the handle on the charger and hold down the power button. It will vibrate once if EasyStart is turned off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine died after 8 months with only one person using it. The shaft on top broke or disconnected so it would no longer vibrate the brush. Replaced quickly with warranty service.</li>
    <li> Nice product - but I expected it work for more than 10 months having plunked down close to 100 dollars.&lt;br /&gt;Disappointing!</li>
    <li> I purchased this item 18 months ago and am already on my second warranty replacement for the same issue.&lt;br /&gt;I do love this toothbrush, but the warranty is only two years - given that I haven&#x27;t gotten one to last a full year yet, I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll buy another Philips product when this one dies.</li>
    <li> This is a great toothbrush which cleans well, but the battery lasted less than 2 years. So, I gave it 1 star.</li>
    <li> This is the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used. My dentist specifically recommended this brush, and he was right. It is great.</li>
    <li> The toothbrush replaced an older model that was broken when I packed it in my suitcase.  They are very sensitive but effective devices.  I enjoy using the toothbrush,  It fit on my old stand that has the uv cleaner.</li>
    <li> we have had two of these.  both stopped working.  Sonicare won&#x27;t replace.  save yourself the trouble and buy something else.</li>
    <li> I had used Oral B 3D el. tooth brush for almost 10 years and it did a great job but......................I just switch to Sonic toothbrush and it is even better. My teeth have whitened 2 shades. I was amazed. Just wish I had started back years ago. Fantastic toothbrush coming from someone who had used the best Oral B el. toothbrush!</li>
    <li> I had a Sonicare a few years ago, and when it finally quit, I bought an Oral B rotary.  I didn&#x27;t feel the Oral B did as good a job and have gone back to the Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleans the best of all the electric toothbrushes I have tried.</li>
    <li> Would give five stars for ease of use (once you get used to it). But the batteries have failed twice. Thankfully there is a 2 year warranty and they have replaced it both times. Kind of a hassle though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have noticed gum health improving somewhat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One issue is the white waterproof seal on the top can get dirty and grow mold easily. So it needs more than a quick rinse to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the couple of issues I would keep buying this.</li>
    <li> This new model is much slimmer and lighter than its predecessors.  While expensive, the Lithium Ion battery should provide a longer life.</li>
    <li> After a problem with another Amazon vendor not shipping my order, Ordered direct from Amazon.com with overnight shipping and everything was as promised receiving it the next day before I left the country.  Product is such an improvement over the older models I have used in the past.  Smaller and lighter unit is much easier to use.  More modes to work in and charge light very useful.  New style battery much better with more uses per charge.  Best of all is both small size AND that it can be used in any type of power plug.  A big plus for me here in Thailand (where my girlfriend had blown up one of the older model chargers for my old Sonicare by bypassing my power converter)is that I can plug it into ANY power plug on my travels around the world.</li>
    <li> I used the first generation Sonicare Advance for many years, because I thought it was a great improvement over a manual toothbrush.  The FlexCare is the \\&quot;advanced\\&quot; Advance - there is just no comparison.  Most importantly, my teeth felt cleaner with the FlexCare than with the Advance.  But there are many other advantages of the Flexcare as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The FlexCare is much easier to hold because of its rounded shape, slimness and lighter weight.  That makes a significant difference when you&#x27;re holding and moving something around in your mouth for 2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that&#x27;s the same between the two models is the 30 second beeps which signal you to change the area being brushed.  But now, instead of just one two-minute brushing mode, the FlexCare has several options which are easily selected by a push of a button.  You can do a 1 minute \\&quot;quick\\&quot; brush when you&#x27;re in a rush - and the brush will beep every 15 seconds instead of 30.  Or you can do a 3 minute \\&quot;maximum\\&quot; brush which includes a 30 second brush plus a 15 second gum massage for each area.  The gum massage is a nice feature - I liked the feeling of just a gentle massage.  You can even opt for just the gum massage without any brushing.  And for people with sensitive teeth, there&#x27;s a sensitive mode (although I haven&#x27;t tried it.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other seemingly minor features were actually very user-friendly details that really won me over.  First was the brush head attachment, which unlike the Advance, is a single piece which is designed so that excess water that drips down the side of the brush can can be wiped off.  Any of you Advance users out there know that excess water can easily collect between the two pieces of the Advance brush head and create yellowish-brownish gunk between the two pieces, unless you always take the two pieces apart and wipe them regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second was the charger base.  It includes a cord wrap, which you can use to hide the excess cord within the charger so that you don&#x27;t have a long cord snaking around your sink.  Also, when the cord wrap is removed, the charger converts to a smaller travel size.  And a travel case is included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In trying to improve the Advance, Sonicare was thinking of not just the performance of the brush, but how to make it easier and more flexible for the user.  And they certainly succeeded.  I recommend the FlexCare for top gums and teeth.rd snaking around your sink.  Also, when the cord wrap is removed, the charger converts to a smaller travel size.

    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past couple of weeks (since the date of my last visit to the dentist for an exam and cleaning) and am very happy with it--it&#x27;s very easy to use, and it seems to be doing a great job.  The proof of its effectiveness and value will come some six months from now, however, when I return to the dentist&#x27;s office for my bi-annual visit.  I will report back then with a final evaluation, based on the results of that visit.  Until September...!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;September update:  the improvement was noticeable, my dentist was very pleased.</li>
    <li> I have used other Sonicare products for a number of years, but have found that this unit easily surpasses other products.  It has great features, is very easy to use, and most importantly, seems to leave you with feeling that your teeth are very clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit and charger are quite compact (and the charger has a base that can be removed to make it smaller for traveling) , so don&#x27;t take up a lot of counter space.  As a result, the toothbrush is quite manueverable and easy to use, an important feature if you use it for the recommended 2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush is very easy to use, in that you basically push a button to descide which of the clearning modes you want to use (basically there is a 2-minute clearning cycle, with the option of a one-minute quick clean or a3 minute cycle that works in a minute of gum massage.  There is also a light that indicates how well charged the battery is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One nice feature of the toothbrush is that it briefly stops (i.e., for a second) as you brush to remind you to move the brush to another quadrant of your mouth, helping assure that your brushing is complete. After two minutes,  the unit shuts off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an excellent product that does a great job and is easy to use. It really helps meet your brushing needs in that you can set it for different lengths of time (also there is a setting for sensitive teeth).  The feature that tells you to move the brush to another part of your mouth is very helpful and really makes it easy to give your teeth a thorough brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Love this toothbrush!  Excellent quality and nice looking.  Easy to handle, comfortable to hold and most importantly does a great job cleaning my teeth.  Take good care of this brush and it will last a long time.  Worth the extra dollars you&#x27;ll spend for the quality. Two thumbs way up for this toothbrush! !</li>
    <li> I was hoping to walk in to my dentist and hear &amp;#34;wow, all your 4-5 pockets are down to 1-2&amp;#34; but, alas, didn&#x27;t.  I only heard mostly my dental health worsened.  I had my dentist re-educate me on how to use it, I did but still no improvement.  I went back to manual tooth brush.</li>
    <li> My husband had some problems with his gums and the dentist recommended he try this for a month and also have a professional cleaning during that time.  His gums had major improvement in only one month.  He says his teeth have never felt so clean and he will never go back to a regular brush.  Our dentist also said the sanitizer feature on the other model is unnecessary.  I am going to start using one too.  The price has recently gone up by almost $40 since we bought it here, so you might want to shop around.</li>
    <li> I used to suffer from gingivitis between teeth cleanings and sometimes it could get pretty bad. After switching to this toothbrush, it completely disappeared. Yes, I sound like an infomercial, but in this case it&#x27;s the truth. These toothbrushes are excellent and I thought to write this as I&#x27;ve just returned from my first visit to a new dentist. One of the first questions the hygienist asked me was &#x27;Do you use a Sonicare?&#x27; I think that says a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I have to consider this value for money. It&#x27;s expensive, and the new brush heads are expensive, but still, it&#x27;s gotta be cheaper than the dental treatment I imagine myself needing if I don&#x27;t use this. The hygienist also said something about (and I paraphrase), &#x27;biofilm&#x27;, that gets on your teeth and causes decay. A normal toothbrush can&#x27;t get this off, but a Sonicare just breezes through it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, it&#x27;s reliable, the charge lasts a long time, the gum massage function seems a bit kooky, but feels nice, and it has a timer to ensure that I brush properly. If ever mine breaks, I will immediately order a new one. I have to call this the perfect toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I have used an Oral-B sonic toothbrush for several years.  I have been quite happy with the results I get from it.  I wondered whether there is something better so I selected this toothbrush.  Quite simply, I am amazed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed is that this toothbrush is lighter.  Second, the head has a thinner stem than my current toothbrush, making it easier to maneuver around my mouth.  Third, the toothbrush seems to hold a charge longer than my current toothbrush, and it seems to hold one longer than when my current toothbrush was new.  Fourth, this thing is loaded with settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothbrush features three two-minute cleaning modes that are selectable from the handle.  The most vigorous mode is \\&quot;Clean,\\&quot; followed by \\&quot;Sensitive,\\&quot; and then \\&quot;Massage.\\&quot;  As you are going through the routine, a beep sounds every thirty seconds to let you know to move to another quadrant in your mouth.  The toothbrush shuts off automatically at the end of these modes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two other modes serve other purposes.  GoCare is a one minute routine for quick cleanings between regular brushing.  MaxCare features a two minute \\&quot;Clean\\&quot; period followed by a one minute \\&quot;Massage\\&quot; period.  I like this brushing mode the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people may find the various modes to be overkill.  I personally like the MaxCare feature and the ability to choose between \\&quot;Clean\\&quot; and \\&quot;Sensitive.\\&quot;  Those choices may not seem like a big deal until you have oral surgery.  I do not use all the modes, but who knows, some day I might.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Good:  Easy to maneuver around your mouth with the slender head.  The charge lasts a long time.  This model has lots of features.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad:  Whoa!  This model is expensive.  Most sonic toothbrushes are expensive when compared to your typical manual toothbrush, but this one seems expensive for what you get.  I confess that I really like this model, but I struggle with the price.  Also, all that money and only one brush?  Wait until you see how much replacement brushes cost!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a lot of ways to brush your teeth.  Sonic toothbrushes are nice because they help massage your gums in addition to cleaning your teeth.  The built-in timer is nice too.  However, you have to justify spending quite a lot on this model, and then spending even more on replacement heads.  I love this model and will use it until it breaks, but I doubt I will purchase anything as fancy (read expensive) to replace it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The four stars are for the features.  It would have been five stars but for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!here are a lot of ways to brush your teeth.  Sonic toothbrushes are nice because they help massage your gums in addition to cleaning your teeth.  The built-in timer is nice too.

I love this model and will use it until it breaks, but I doubt I will purchase anything as fancy (read expensive) to replace it.    The four stars are for the features.  It would have been five stars but for the price.    Good luck!</li>
    <li> Recently I had been seeing (actually feeling with my tongue) plaque deposits on my teeth and decided to try out a power-brush. Being a kind of buyer that believes in spending a little more but getting the best product I finally bought the Flexcare toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While reading reviews that said \\&quot;feels like dentist clean\\&quot; I was like yeah right, as if its really that cool, its essentially a  vibrating toothbrush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, I was so damn wrong :) The first time I used it, immediately I could feel that \\&quot;clean gap between the teeth\\&quot;, just like you do after flossing. It was such an awesome feeling that immediately I felt nice spending $100.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and after the second use this morning, I could already feel a difference in the plaque, its much less! hurray! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this toothbrush to anyone who wants that just flossed feeling every morning.</li>
    <li> I use twice daily, keeps my teeth clean and my gums healty. It has cut out some of my dentist visits.</li>
    <li> I have owned various Sonicare toothbrushes over the years.  My dentist originally recommended it.  I noticed a vast improvement in my gums and brushing from the beginning.  And so did my dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This latest model I find to be even better.  It is easier to hold and maneuver and the increased brushing power is noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like about this product.... you are &#x27;forced&#x27; to brush for two minutes.  Now granted this model does give you a &#x27;quickie&#x27; option, but unless you are really in a hurry why would you use it, when the 2-minute brushing is the recommended way to go?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the smaller charging unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also really like the new way the brush heads attach.  The older models screwed onto the base unit and invariable you needed to often unscrew the brush and clean where the two attached.  Water/dirt ALWAYS accumulated.  This new model just pops right onto the base....no place for water/dirt/toothpaste to gather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like about this model, and it is really a minor annoyance, is that you can easily while brushing hit the buttons and cause the brush to shut off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all a great improvement to a great product.  My teeth are happy and so is my dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.  It does exactly what it says and more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned this for 1-year now, and I am perfectly happy with the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;__________________________________________&lt;br /&gt;THE GOOD:&lt;br /&gt;After one year of using it about twice a day, every day, it still works just as well as the first time. The battery is great; I&#x27;ve gone as long as a week without having to charge and even after a year can still go several days without charging (though there is certainly a difference in vibration intensity between a full charge and low charge).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Included travel case is also a very handy, useful bonus. Didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d use it much but I have quite a few times, and it&#x27;s perfect for when I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comfortable to hold as well, and easy to keep clean. Still looks like new and all I ever do is rinse it off for a few seconds after each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Teeth and gums also feel great after brushing, much better than a toothbrush. I did use a normal toothbrush on a handful of occasions over the past year and I definitely feel that even when I brush for longer, I never feel I&#x27;m getting &#x27;quite as clean&#x27; of a result compared to the electric. Or maybe I just lost my toothbrush technique/comfort, certainly possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is of course no substantiated proof that it is better to brush with an electric. That said though, my dentist has complimented me on particularly good teeth/gum cleaning and health over the past year, but that&#x27;s more likely due to the convenience and effectiveness of this brush making it easier for me to stick to the habit. Either way, it&#x27;s definitely a good thing in favor of the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, brush heads seem to last longer/perform better than past electric brushes I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;ve been perfectly content going through about one head every quarter, which at ~$20-30/year isn&#x27;t bad!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;__________________________________________&lt;br /&gt;THE BAD:&lt;br /&gt;I will agree with another reviewer, in that for the price you&#x27;re really not getting much improvement over a typical electric brush you could likely find for a good $30-$50 cheaper. I used a ~$40 Brawn electric brush for 2 years before this, and there wasn&#x27;t too much of a difference in upgrading to this (despite the price being much higher). Although, it does appear they&#x27;ve lowered the price quite a bit over the past year, which I definitely feel is appropriate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, I found the other modes for brushing rather useless. I played with it for a while, but at the end of the day turning tooth brushing into a project wasn&#x27;t for me. I look more for the quick, convenient, result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;__________________________________________&lt;br /&gt;IN SHORT:&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Durable, reliable, long-lasting.&lt;br /&gt;- Good, long-lasting battery, and easy to charge.&lt;br /&gt;- Comfortable to hold and use, easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;- Convenient travel case included.&lt;br /&gt;- Excellent in cleaning teeth/gums.&lt;br /&gt;- Replacement brush heads of good quality and value.&lt;br /&gt;- Helps keep teeth-brushing &#x60;fun&#x27; and as less of a chore, making it easier to develop and keep good dental hygiene habits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Price is much higher than other mostly equivalent models (but who knows, maybe they would&#x27;ve crapped out by now?).&lt;br /&gt;- Extra settings/modes relatively useless (subjective, of course).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look forward to getting another 1-2 years out of this before considering an upgrade, and will definitely aim for Sonicare again. Happy customer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***EDIT 10/11/2012&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This, bumps the product up to a 5-star from my original 4-star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m about a month away from the 2-year mark, and I started to experience problems with the brush. The vibration was losing strength, and causing a loud grinding noise when any pressure was applied. It still worked as normal for a while, but progressively got worse to the point where the brush was hardly vibrating at all. This was incredibly discouraging as it wasn&#x27;t all that old of a toothbrush (and expensive!), but I caved and was willing to repurchase a new one as I was very happy with it otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Low and behold though, before purchasing I noticed a 2-year warranty. I called up customer support and in 5 minutes I had a brand new replacement brush (a free head included!) on the way, at absolutely no cost to me, one month before the warranty ended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, seriously. A brand new and completely free brush and brush head. No shipping costs, no service costs, no charges at all. And very painless over the phone; great customer care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yes, while I did have to deal with a faulty product, the astounding customer support and warranty replacement program more than makes up for it. 5-stars.chase a new one as I was very happy with it otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Low and behold though, before purchasing I noticed a 2-year warranty.

    <li> This model works well but no better than the more basic all-white one which has the same brush heads and performance without the unnecessary extra modes.</li>
    <li> Since I have extensive dental work, my dentist recommended using this toothbrush to prevent cavities.  This is supposed to be one of the top models. Of course, I have no way of telling whether it is superior to other products - I still need periodical cleaning - but a study [...] conducted by the Northwest University Dental School indeed shows that Sonicare is a bit superior to Braun Oral-B.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the layout of control buttons on this toothbrush could be improved.  It is easy to accidentally push one of the two control buttons, which can result in stopping the device in the middle of cleaning, or spraying the toothpaste all over. This could be a problem for older people or those with impaired dexterity. For that reason I give it only four stars.</li>
    <li> Normally I don&#x27;t write reviews of products I purchase (probably out of indifference) but in this instance, I feel compelled to state my experiences with a woeful dental product. SonicCare is touted to be the King of Brushes, but its anything but. I have had two SonicCare toothbrushes - in a bit of irony, one was given to me by a friend who was a dentist - and both broke down within a year. Whats more is that to repair these, they were going to charge me as much as it would have been to purchase a new one! (I had gone back to the store after the warranty period so I had to resort to asking about out-of-pocket costs) Well, I nearly blew my stack. Whats more is that if you leave them standing near or on water, the rubber material grows mildew very quickly. Word to the wise, stay away from SonicCare brushes.</li>
    <li> I love my electric toothbrush.  In retrospect, I can see that I might not have needed all the variations of brush speed that come with the Flex Care model.</li>
    <li> She is always tooth blooding with classic brush no mater how soft it is.&lt;br /&gt;But it&#x27;s better with new brush.</li>
    <li> This unit failed after less than a years use.  It was clearly a design issue (admitted by them) which allowed water into the unit.  Customer service sent me prepaid shipping label and a replacement unit, but made it clear that only the original warranty would be honored if there were additional problems.  Alas, the replacement unit has failed -- it indicates it is fully charged, but the &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; button has stopped functioning.  It is now slightly past the original warranty date and frankly I won&#x27;t even bother to contact Phillips.  I also won&#x27;t be buying another Sonicare brush.</li>
    <li> So, there I am shopping for a new toothbrush. I was ready to pay as much as maybe $5 if it was a really good brush. What possessed me to pay $150.00 for a TOOTHBRUSH, I will never know. I always return things when they don&#x27;t measure up to their hype and I was prepared to return this as soon as i tried it because, quite frankly, no toothbrush could be worth $150.00.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it I was hooked. It is a different experience. My gums are healthy and teeth look great. My wife immediately wanted her own brush after trying it once.  The clincher was being at the dentist today.  He has used a sonicare for a couple of years and thinks they are great. He says he can tell when his patients use one of these electric (electronic??) toothbrushes. Their gums are healthy, their cleanings are easier and, it seems to him, people have fewer dental problems.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush really does a great job of cleaning even with a soft brush, so long as you apply a bit of pressure. The one drawback is the built-in timer that, so far as i can tell, cannot be turned off.  The company has decided how long you should brush and to carry out their intentions, the timing mechanism beeps once a minute. It&#x27;s not the sound that is so objectionable but rather the fact that the beep slightly zaps the brush off your tooth surface, breaking your rhythm and causing the brush to miss the spot it was about to brush. This happens twice per cycle and after three minutes the brush automatically turns off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t appreciate that my toothbrush has that much of a mind of its own. I would much prefer making my own brushing decisions!</li>
    <li> This Sonicare electric toothbrush is, simply put, an excellent product.  I&#x27;ve been using a Braun (which I believe is the same as Oral B) electric toothbrush for years, and it does not compare with this newest generation of dental hygiene products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This model comes preset with a step-up program that gradually increases the speed of the brush head over 14 uses until it reaches maximum effectiveness, a feature designed especially to those new to electric toothbrushes.  Although I&#x27;ve used an electric toothbrush for years, I decided to try out the pre-programmed sessions to see how it worked.  On the first day, the toothbrush sounded like a bee in my mouth; it was gentle, with enough high-speed vibration to clean my teeth better than my old, full-speed Braun.  Over the fourteen uses -- I did it in a week, but those new to electric toothbrushes might want to use it only once a day at first -- the brush lost its whine and gradually moved to its final, more authoritative vibration that cleans exceptionally well.  Even at maximum power, this toothbrush does not vibrate through my entire skull the way my Braun does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The coolest part of the Sonicare is the option of selecting different modes.  The sensitive teeth setting is more like a mosquito than a bee; although I have sensitive teeth, I find that the regular cleaning doesn&#x27;t bother me and is more thorough.  You  may select \\&quot;Go Care\\&quot; (a one-minute touch up between regular brushings), \\&quot;Massage\\&quot; for the gums, and MaxCare for a 30 second tooth brushing following by a fifteen second gum massage for each quadrant (total time &#x3D; 3 minutes.)  To remind you to switch \\&quot;quadrants\\&quot; of your mouth, the pitch changes slightly.  After the routine time is up, the toothbrush stops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First time electric toothbrush users should note the instructions about angling the brush head and moving gently side to side.  You do not move the brush much yourself as you would with a traditional tooth brush; otherwise, you&#x27;ll irritate or even rip your gums.  My dentist has always advocated using an electric toothbrush once a day, not twice, with a traditional brush doing the work for the second brushing, although I find that the Sonicare, unlike my old Braun, is gentle enough to use twice.  Still, users might not want to throw out their toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sonicare comes with a stand charger, one standard brush head, user identification bands, a soft carrying case, and a plastic cap to protect the brush head while traveling.  Those who have smaller mouths will want to buy the optional [[ASIN:B000FEF1VO Philips Sonicare Elite (E-Series) Replacement Brush Head, Compact (2-Pack)]] since it&#x27;s not easy maneuvering the head behind, say, the front teeth.  If you are concerned about sanitizing the heads, you might prefer to buy the version with the sanitizer ([[ASIN:B0012AOO1I Philips Sonicare Flexcare Professional with UV Sanitizer]]), although you can always buy a sanitizer separately later ([[ASIN:B000V5Z4J6 Philips Sonicare UV Sanitizer]].)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only two complaints about this product:  you cannot attach it to the wall to keep counter space free, and the automatic stop feature is annoying if I&#x27;m not quite done brushing. The inability to mount it on the wall is especially frustrating since the handle is incredibly easy to knock off the charger.  Some people might not like the fact that it tickles like the Dickens when you hit the roof of your mouth while on the brushing speeds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this toothbrush. Electric toothbrushes promote oral health through both cleaner teeth and gum stimulation, and the Sonicare is an exceptional entry into the market.our gums.

    <li> I love the way my teeth feel after using this toothbrush.  There is simply no comparison between the Sonicare and a cheap electric toothbrush (let alone a \\&quot;regular\\&quot; hand held).  The vibration takes a couple of uses to get accustomed to, and I&#x27;m not sure it would feel great if you have overly sensitive teeth. There are different settings which are essentially different time settings (for a quick clean or a longer clean).  Not sure how critical the feature is, but it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is just one annoying feature of the toothbrush.  The controls for the different speeds and timing are all on side of the handle, and I am constantly hitting them accidentally while I&#x27;m brushing, either turning it off, or changing the mode mid-session.  Not the end of the world, and I&#x27;m not sure what other design would allow you the options this brush provides.  That is the only reason that I give this brush 4 and not 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I used to think that any power toothbrush would be as good as the next. Then I used the Sonicare and it has blown away all expectations and completely transformed my impression about electric toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this toothbrush has given me an unbelievably long lasting clean taste. It probably gets everything you&#x27;re going after when you brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a quick brush setting and a longer mode for a thorough scrubbing with a timer to remind you to switch to different areas of the mouth. That&#x27;s an invaluable feature!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. I liked the step-up power cycle feature which increases the intensity of the vibrations gradually over the first 14 brush cycles and hits peak only once you&#x27;ve had the chance to use it for a week to two (depending upon how many times you brush daily).&lt;br /&gt;2. The brush is ergonomically designed to be easy to a) Hold b) Brush c) clean d) carry in travel pouch&lt;br /&gt;3. Gum Massage feature: Lower frequency vibrations help.&lt;br /&gt;4. You can wrap the excess length of the power cord in the base and hide it from view.&lt;br /&gt;5. I have not replaced the brush on its base for about 3 weeks now and it is still running on half charge. This thing has an amazing battery life!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. Hmmm...let&#x27;s see. None!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They designed this one really well and I&#x27;d be interested in knowing how they plan to improve upon this. Maybe send someone home to brush your teeth for you.</li>
    <li> Bought this product for my teen son.  It&#x27;s very quiet and he tells me it does an amazing job and feels great.  Took a little getting used to, but it has a program for acclimating the user to the vibration.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dental hygenist. I can see and feel a difference with my teeth. I wish I had gotten one much sooner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;The Cadillac of Tootbrushes.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Love this toothbrush.  Why I waited so long to buy it is beyond me.  My teeth feel like I just came from the dentist for a teeth cleaning.</li>
    <li> This was recommended by dental hygienist to improve my gums and it has worked very well. I like the 2 minute timer to brush 30 seconds for each section. Toothbrushes are small so they reach tight areas.</li>
    <li> This is a replacement for the original one I bought from my dentist several years ago.  The original one started loosing it&#x27;s charge faster and faster and then finally the post that the brush snaps on to dislodged inside the handle so it would not &amp;#34;sonic&amp;#34; so to speak.  I love the brush and my cleanings with my dentist are much better over the years now.  This brush for me gets way back into the corners where it&#x27;s hard to brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the negatives ... way toooo expensive.  it&#x27;s difficult to justify $100+ for a toothbrush.  Second, you can&#x27;t change the batteries yourself.  You can go online to youtube and see people that have disassembled them and replaced batteries, etc, etc ... but it&#x27;s just not worth it to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So right now the cost is worth the good teeth for me.  We&#x27;ll see how long this one lasts.</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush. You can feel how clean your mouth gets. I like that it has several tie setting for different situations.</li>
    <li> I love my new sonicare.  My dentist recommended it and scared by the prospect of gum disease (they seemed fine to me), i decided to abandon my manual brush. I researched other brands and sonicare models, and was told by others not to skimp on the quality - that sonicare was the best. Have been using it for about a month along w flossing, and my dentist said my gums look much healthier already!</li>
    <li> Before we used Braun OralB. We are very satisfied. However, we ordered this one to give a try to it. Revelation! It is great. I believe it is better then previous electric toothbrush we had. Probably the heads are more expensive. Quite important: the handle is much lighter then OralB.</li>
    <li> Great product - has many cleaning options with great results - easy to use and has a long charge life - I really like the 2 minute clean cycle with the 30 second reminder to change cleaning location.  After you brush, it really feels like you had your teeth cleaned at the Dentist office. This product was actually recommended by my own Dentist as I get a lot of tarter build up.  Glad I made this purchase.</li>
    <li> This is where you really get to take a \\&quot;BITE\\&quot; into technology. I highly recommend this unique dental care system for those who have and or are predisposed to gum disease and tooth decay. I have some friends that haven&#x27;t visited a dentist in several years and have incredible teeth and gums and use a traditional manual tooth brush...oh well, lucky them. It&#x27;s all about genetics and with this dental care system you can really beat the odds of genetics and increase the health and longevity of your gums and teeth.</li>
    <li> I have used the older model, I think the Advance one, for years.  I finally needed to replace it when it would no longer hold a charge.  I was comfortable with the larger handle but was using the updated brush heads that are similar to the heads on this model. This model works just as well as the Advance model.  It retains the same timing signals, speed and sonic vibrations as the older one.  My exception to giving it a full 5 stars is that when brushing it is too easy to trigger the other sonic settings when not desired.  The feature button is too sensitive or perhaps poorly located so when holding the handle in your hand, it becomes easy to touch this button.  The on/off button is OK.  I am not sure how the button location could be changed in future designs or suggest a better one, but that is my only \\&quot;gripe\\&quot;.  It&#x27;s just a matter of getting used to the new style.  I do feel that the quality or the \\&quot;feel\\&quot; of the newer model is not quite as good as the older one, but it&#x27;s minor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 06/27/12:  I have gotten used to the handle and button placements.  I am very happy with this brush.  Works as advertised and holds a charge \\&quot;forever\\&quot;.  Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Yes this toothbrush is a little expensive, but once you start using one, you won&#x27;t want to go back to what you used before.  This is my second one, the previous one lasting a little over four years.  When the first one quit,  I immediately started looking for a new one.  This was the best deal out there.</li>
    <li> philips did their homework &amp; got this one right.  easy to use, timer works great, brushes are interchangeable, and instructions are clear.  my teeth never felt cleaner, even after just leaving the dentist.</li>
    <li> This was an upgrade for me. I had an earlier model of a SONICARE brush and was very happy with it till my husband got this one for himself. This is the Cadillac. It had various cycles and speeds---very versatile. Stays charged for I know a week at a time maybe longer. The only negative would be the longevity of the unit. If you are offered an extended warranty--take it. Seems like it was 3 weeks after 1 year on my husbands first one -- it died. BUT he turned right around and bought the same one--so that tells you something....I would recommend this brush to anyone that wants to keep their teeth...LOL.</li>
    <li> the performance of this product is phenomenal !!  I liked it so well, I bought one for my wife.  She like it so well, we are buying another for our vacation cabin.  Clean feels like I just left the dentist after cleaning, except my gums do not hurt!!</li>
    <li> Been using it for many years.....reversed my gum disease. Teeth feel extremely clean. Always get a good report from my dentist since I have been using it. Got some junior ones for the grandkids.</li>
    <li> My husband bought me this toothbrush I think back in 2008? To date I am still using it. I guess you have to take good care of it like cleaning it, wiping it dry after you use it and it will last. I bought my brother and his wife another model, their broke after a year and I know why. Because they never even took off the brushhead and cleaned the connecting part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has enhanced my dental health. I haven&#x27;t not had a single cavity since I started using it and every time I go see a dentist they always comment on how health my gum is.</li>
    <li> Love this toothbrush which works great. My last one only made it 3 years before blowing itself apart from the vibrations.  I took my old broken brush apart and it&#x27;s truly amazing how so much electronics AND battery are all so neatly jammed together. I suspect the main problem with the brush is the constant vibrations ripping it up.. eventually. I will keep buying this brush since it really does work. So, thirty bucks a year isn&#x27;t a bad investment v. the dentist.</li>
    <li> My old (identical model) Sonicare finally gave out after several years of daily brushing, twice a day.  This toothbrush is everything I want in a dependable, effective and well designed.  I particularly like the battery level indicator, lacking on the other Sonicare models.  I use the quad pacer to ensure I do an adequate job in my mouth.  My hygienist compliments me every time on the lack of plaque and my healthy gums.</li>
    <li> I had purchased the Sonicare Flexcare Plus rechargeable toothbrush that came with the UV cleaner and additional brushing modes.  I wanted to purchase a 2nd toothbrush to keep in an additional bathroom but I felt I didnt need all of the features of the Flexcare Plus that I don&#x27;t tend to use, so I purchased the regular Flexcare product.  This toothbrush does still come with a few different brush settings as described in the product description, but again, I really only use one setting to brush my teeth so I dont find the extra modes necessary personally.  It does the same job as the Flexcare plus and I have never had any technical issues with it.  This is a great rechargeable toothbrush for anyone who doesn&#x27;t see a need for all of the extra bells and whistles that may not even be used.</li>
    <li> I bought this in December 2011, it has been awesome! My mouth has never been so clean feeling and my teeth this white! charge last long, charger is great, functions are all usable, the brush heads are expensive but way cheaper that a dentist. This is my favorite toothbush so far and its a bonus the my girlfriend and i both can use it via the color coded bases on the brush heads. Major flaw, stopped working in 8 months, i am currently going through Phillips to get a replacement since it has a 24 month warranty and depending how smoothly the process is i will be leaving my review at 4* or bumping it up to 5*.</li>
    <li> I had a Sonicare for many years and this flex-guard replaces it. This one handles and cleans better and actually makes my mouth feel better, so I am using it more often.</li>
    <li> This Sonicare brush has an auto shutoff function after two minutes (recommended brush-time length), and at each 30-second interval it will stop for a brief second to let you know to \\&quot;switch quadrants\\&quot;.  There is also a silver button you can push to select \\&quot;Sensitive\\&quot; mode, for your gums, and \\&quot;Go Care\\&quot; mode, for those that need to finish quick.  The quality of debris removal is very good and my teeth feel squeaky after I brush.  It&#x27;s no replacement for flossing though, I still floss every night, but the Sonicare does a good job getting most of the debris out and off my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that the brush head tends to get really dirty inside.  I took the brush off and looked into the little pocket to find really nasty stuff in there.  It kind of bothered me so sometimes I soak it in alcohol by take the brush attachment off, and wipe the metal rod.  Also, don&#x27;t leave your brush wet on the bottom.  The rubber part tends to mold and it gets smelly.  So make sure to wipe it dry before you leave it on the counter top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I charge my battery only when it tells me to so I can&#x27;t comment on battery life when it comes to daily-charging.  I&#x27;ve had my brush for over two years now.  When I got this I was charging this about twice a month, and now I charge it twice, maybe three times, a month.  The battery life is pretty good and the power is still just as good.  As the battery weaken you will notice a decrease in power so make sure to promptly charge it when you need to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The set comes with two brush heads (a small and regular) but the brush head replacements are quite pricey!  I&#x27;d suggest buying them in bulk for cheaper or try and use your brush longer than the recommended time.  I generally use my common sense to determine if the brush head has hit its life&#x27;s end.  But don&#x27;t wait too long because a bad bristle will decrease cleaning results.  The charging dash is kind of awkward.  It is a little wobbly sometimes it&#x27;s hard to see where the prong goes into but it does it&#x27;s job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got my Sonicare brush for $50.00 at my dentist&#x27;s office.  Yes, I know, \\&quot;What a deal!\\&quot;, but after using it, I think I would recommend it even for its normal price ($116.00 on Amazon), I certainly think it&#x27;s worth the results and it will last you a long time.  I can&#x27;t say that it decreases cavities because I have generally healthy teeth but I do notice my teeth feel cleaner.  If you are into oral health, this would be a great investment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. Great clean.&lt;br /&gt;2. Function options allow different styles of cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;3.

    <li> Really liked it, much better than Oral B.&lt;br /&gt;It is after a long time that I have liked anything made by Philips!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This  Toothbrush has some features that are useless  for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish brush heads had options of harder medium etc!</li>
    <li> The toothbrush died after about a year. The first time it died, it was in warranty and Philips sent me a replacement. The replacement also died after about a year, at which point it was no longer in warranty, and customer service wouldn&#x27;t make an exception. My husband&#x27;s also died after about a year.</li>
    <li> I love my toothbrush! It is my second one, as the first stopped working after about 2 years. When I go for my dental check up, I have almost no plaque buildup on my teeth, and I believe it is due to brushing twice a day with my Sonicare. I liked it so much I bought 4 more for family members!</li>
    <li> This is my first electric toothbrush, so nothing to compare it to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little hard getting used to the &#x27;tickling&#x27; sensation for the first several brushings, but after that, I like it!  It&#x27;s quiet, my teeth feel much cleaner than with a manual toothbrush, the 4 quadrant beeps are very useful for timing, so is the 1-minute &amp;#34;Go&#x27; cleaning when I&#x27;m in a hurry.  Haven&#x27;t traveled with it yet, but looking forward to taking it fully charged on short to medium trips without the base.</li>
    <li> This is my third Sonicare Toothbrush and after four months of use, I prefer either of my earlier units.  The the \\&quot;mode\\&quot; selection button is flush with the surface and is located where your hand normally rests while brushing your teeth. This results in constant changing of modes while brushing your teeth.  Also the smaller handle diameter is not as comfortable if you have large hands.</li>
    <li> This new electric toothbrush by Philips has a wide bristle range and special angled neck to provide better tooth coverage and a deeper clean.  It makes it easy to reach hard to get to places in the mouth.  In addition to a good cleaning job, it helps prevent gingival bleeding. The instructions say that it is gentle on orthodontics, dental work, veneers, implant material and sensitive teeth.  I agree.  There are several models of this toothbrush.  It isn&#x27;t inexpensive (about $ 125-$130 each), but if it helps you maintain good mouth health with lower dentist expenses, it&#x27;s well worth the money !</li>
    <li> Packaging: The packaging of the device was appealing and organized. The pictures and the white coloring definitely inspired cleanliness. The listing of the features of the toothbrush on the box was short but still informative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Portability: The toothbrush comes with a travel case that is compact enough to fit in most toiletry bags, however, the brush head needs to be detached in order to fit in it. The charger is very compact and readily able to travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Operation: The R910 features 3 brush modes: clean, sensitive, and massage. The clean mode was very intense and takes a little while to get used to, however, once you do it is definitely the most effective mode. It gets teeth very clean as the vibrations are at a significant amplitude. The sensitive mode is a good compromise if you have very sensitive gums. While it does not clean as thoroughly as the clean mode does, it is sufficient for daily use. I would personally not recommend using the massage mode. I felt that it did not make my gums any less sensitive than the sensitive mode, but the difference in cleanliness was noticeable. The R910 also featured timers and personalizeable routines which I didn&#x27;t find useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: Overall, I would say that the toothbrush is very good. The brushes modes are definitely more effective than normal brushing. While the personalizeable routines weren&#x27;t very useful, the brush modes more than made up for it.</li>
    <li> I have never used an electric toothbrush before this one - the \\&quot;old-fashioned\\&quot; way always seemed just fine.  But since our dentist has recommended that we use a sonic toothbrush (he made no specific brand recommendations) I decided to give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another reviewer has compared this brush to a \\&quot;bee\\&quot; in your mouth.  I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s more like a jackhammer - at least to begin with.  It took several days and some adjustments to my brushing style before I started to get used to it.  I still find it annoying and almost painful when the shaft of the brush head accidentally touches my teeth but with practice I&#x27;m getting better at avoiding that.  My previous habit was to brush for a very long time, but this model gives a slightly different buzz every 30 seconds to prompt you to change which part of your mouth you&#x27;re brushing.  I&#x27;ve gotten used to that as well, and am able to time myself a little better now so that I&#x27;ve covered all the teeth in each section.  It still feels like it stops rather abruptly, however, when the 2 minutes are up but I guess I can always turn it back on, right?  Unfortunately, us \\&quot;low-tech\\&quot; brushers don&#x27;t get up to speed so quickly, and I&#x27;m still trying to figure out all the features this brush has, but it seems to work well on the standard setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But lest you think I&#x27;ve hated this brush, I will agree that it leaves my teeth feeling exceptionally clean.  I don&#x27;t know if it works any better than the Braun Oral B that my wife and kids use, but I can feel a definite difference to a \\&quot;manual\\&quot; brush.  My gums also feel better, and my thinking is that a sonic brush might be healthier for them.  I like the feel of the rubberized grip, although the buttons are right where you hold it and I&#x27;ve accidentally pushed them before.  And my only other complaint is that it comes with only a single head.  For the high price of this model I would think it could have included a few.  But overall, I&#x27;m sold on this one and will continue to use it... and try to figure out all those other features.re out all those other features.</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush. One thing that really made the difference for me is the fact that there is significantly less vibration that other products I&#x27;ve used so far. Believe me, I love the tickle I get from holding the brush handles of my Ultreo Ultrasound, but after a while it gets irritating. What the makers of FlexCare have accomplished is to practically eliminate this buzzing in their product (by as much as 80% according to the statement on the box).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another interesting feature has to do with the bristles. I feel like I&#x27;m reaching some parts of my mouth a lot easier and I believe it has to do with the fact that FlexCare offers a wider sweeping motion and the bristles are more rounded than the average toothbrush. This combination makes for a more pleasant experience when after turning off the bathroom light and heading to bed, I feel refreshed. I guess the toothbrush does make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> After several months with no problems and a great dental checkup I have to say that this is one of my personal favorite tooth brushes.Most importantly is the cleaning.This brush does an awesome job,aside from a cleaning at the dentist I haven&#x27;t found better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The size is smaller than other electric tooth brushes I have used which is a plus for me.It fits comfortably in hand and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with accidently switching it off while in use as I have with other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush head is a nice size and feels comfortable in my mouth.It is not small but not huge either.Plus the replacment heads are easy to find and a reasonable price which is very important over the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like being able to adjust the speed for when you need a more thorough cleaning and if you have sensitive teeth and gums you can always start at the lowest setting and work your way up to a faster speed at your pace,this would be very helpful if you are not accustomed to using electric tooth brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found that the battery holds a charge well and so far is still doing so.Plus the low battery warning is nice so it dosen&#x27;t run out in mid-brush.Aside from just trying them out I don&#x27;t really use the programmed settings.It&#x27;s not that there is anything wrong with using them I just like brushing the way I always have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The FlexCare is a bit pricey but other than that I have no complaints.I liked this brush so much I bought one for my 8 year old daughter who has had dental problems since she first got teeth and she has had no problems using it,and loves it as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned a Philips Sonicare before this. I dont remember the model. But it was their top-of-the line brush about 4 yrs ago. It stopped working since the little green button got jammed. Both that model &amp; this one have it sealed. So you cant fix it yourself, God forbid that happens. So go easy on that button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the brushing action is concerned, if you have NEVER used a sonic brush before, then yeah - its great. I&#x27;ve read some reviewers stating toothpaste flying about. You have to be a \\&quot;leetle stoopid\\&quot; not to figure around this, if you dont get it right the first time. Just apply the paste about on all your teeth till there&#x27;s nothing sitting on the brush head. Then operate it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another comment was that the brush is a little loud. No its not. And I live in a quiet environment. Its not noiseless of course. Someone near you will hear it. Not the neighbours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a massage mode that is quite nice. You still brush with the same bristles really. But the pulses are more controlled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 2 min brush cycle beeps every 30 secs or so to remind you to change position. Again, that&#x27;s not a new feature over the old brush. Also, the most important point is  IMO, the brushing action. I dont consider it to be superior to the prev Sonicare Elite. It did not feel that way at least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have one advantage over the older model. No housing recess for the magnets. So there&#x27;s no stinky gunk buildup in that chamber. You&#x27;ll appreciate this if you owned the earlier models. Otherwise, disregard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a good brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No I did not waste money on the sanitizer. Use Hydrogen Peroxide 3% from your friendly, or otherwise neighbourhood chemist. The sonic action with the peroxide should shake the hell off any bacteria in the bristles. Dont waste money on the sanitizer please.</li>
    <li> I like the R910 much better than my previous Sonicare 4100. The unprotected brush head is a huge improvement. I find the slimmer body easier to hold and maneuver, and it takes less room in my travel bag. I&#x27;m hoping the Lion battery in the R910 lives longer than the 3 years I got from the NiCad in the 4100. The second button is somewhat annoying, as I frequently push it accidentially and unexpectedly end up doing something to my teeth other than giving them a normal brushing...</li>
    <li> I have had this brust for over a month now and it does a better job than oral B. There is less chances of it damaging the gums since it is pressure sensitive and excessive pressure to the brush will cause it to stop.&lt;br /&gt;Only negative is that the large brush head just doesn&#x27;t get into the narrow corners. Will try the compact head to see how it works.&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great product.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a Christmas gift and the recipient tells me he is very impressed and would recommend it highly to anyone looking to replace their older model.</li>
    <li> i bought this back in october... i loved it at first until the head shaft came loose under the seal-in december. according to instructions you should be able to tighten it back up-NOT THE CASE. i attempted to send back but got stuck with the headache of shipping and handling-it isnt cheap! i was so disgusted with this expensive piece of crud that i just said the heck w it and tossed it... SAVE YOUR MONEY-STICK TO TOOTHBRUSHES</li>
    <li> Use it twice a day, has worked well for years now.</li>
    <li> Mine broke after 5 months. There&#x27;s a big noise when I turned it on and it  vibrated more than it should. Then I contacted the customer service. The first time they said they would send me a replacement since it&#x27;s under warranty. They said the replacement would arrive in 10 days. 2 weeks later I was told it would probably take half a week longer. Then the third time I was told they were not sure when it would be sent to me. Now it&#x27;s been more than one month and I still haven&#x27;t received the replacement.&lt;br /&gt;I feel that I was cheated since the beginning.</li>
    <li> Excellent toothbrush - easy to use and highly recommend</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush! Mouth/teeth always feels clean and fresh after brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that the rubber portion of the brush starts to come off after two years of usage (the brush has a two-year warranty and should anything happen, their customer service is great), even with carefully washing it after each use. The button became inoperable after two years but I upgraded to a Sonicare DiamondClean White Edition recently and noticed that they got ride of all those rubbery parts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, just a really great toothbrush and I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to purchase Sonicare&#x27;s products.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;  Your mouth feels great after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;ve gone through three of these now.  It&#x27;s a toothbrush, so it just sits on the sink and doesn&#x27;t get abused at all.  Sill, every couple of years I find myself ordering a new one because the previous no longer turns on or charges.  At over a hundred bucks a pop, I&#x27;d expect these to last at least twice as long.</li>
    <li> long battery power ( over 2 weeks for me) and very reliable. Good size and variety of functions although I use mine in a basic mode only.</li>
    <li> Engineers look at functionality in a simplistic mechanical way.&lt;br /&gt;Designers look for artful symmetry in design.&lt;br /&gt;Both failed to collaborate to design a functional piece that takes into account human anatomy as well as basic physics. To place on/off/change buttons at the singular location, the fulcrum of our toothbrush lever, which is where the human hand needs to balance the forces of pushing against the teeth while still holding, shows a lack of creative collaborative thought.&lt;br /&gt;Offsetting them slightly to either side would solve the problem of accidentally hitting those buttons. Having a programmable disable feature once brushing begins is another solution. Having buttons slightly recessed with a thin slide to cover is another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Interesting that manufacturer testing &amp; research of how quickly the non-replaceable enamel is worn down by our now more abrasive head speeds that information is not being shared and makes me wonder what teeth will look like after years of use. Especially when combined with the more abrasive \\&quot;whitening\\&quot; toothpastes that have been out these past few years.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the sonicate series of toothbrush units for almost 10-years and I&#x27;m convinced they have saved me from a lot of cavities and improved my overall  oral hygiene.  Now, I will say that if you get 18-24 months out of one of these then consider yourself lucky.  That&#x27;s just the way it is with today&#x27;s technology and I&#x27;m okay with that.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> There is nothing that cleans your teeth as good as a Sonicare.  My gums have improved and that makes me very happy!</li>
    <li> The vibration was so harsh and the brush was so stiff that it knocked my crown loose.  Flexible GUM picks work better.</li>
    <li> I never thought I would actually crave a good tooth brushing until I got my Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I eagerly anticipate every chance I get to use this bad boy.  I want to get one for everyone in my family for Christmas this year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My smile is GLEAMING!</li>
    <li> My teeth and gums feel really clean since I&#x27;ve been using this.  Would purchase again.  You can use it to massage or to clean teeth at various strengths.</li>
    <li> Does good, I have some gum issues so the low sonic setting is nice, especially combined with the extra soft heads.  The batteries seem to last 2 years or so, but don&#x27;t keep it on a charger, only charge when it get down to less than one bar.</li>
    <li> The second Sonicare we have owned. It is easier to change and clean the heads in this unit versus the previous elite model with the screw on brush..</li>
    <li> Be careful of ordering Sonic toothbrushes. Amazon sells one that is not Phillips Sonicare, for a very high price. Mine broke down in under a year. The Phillips models are the best but the best prices I have found are at Costco.</li>
    <li> I like the timer!  It beeps when it&#x27;s time to move and cuts off when you&#x27;re done!  It gives me one less thing to think about!</li>
    <li> battery literally lasts forever on this thing. I&#x27;ve used sonicare flexcare for almost 6 years now and will never go back to a regular toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Please let me if know where if I can  purchase replacement brush heads for the Sonicare Flex Care Sonic Toothbrush locally in Houston TX</li>
    <li> I have had this unit for a while and had to replace it as the center shaft inside the unit broke, rendering the toothbrush worthless. This was a very expensive toothbrush. I am very disappointed in the quality and would not buy this unit ever again.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Philips honored the warranty as the unit stopped taking a charge after about 11/2 years.  They replaced the unit very promptly.&lt;br /&gt;Fred</li>
    <li> I have been using Sonic toothbrush for years, and it does its job. The only thing my dentist ever said to me was &amp;#34;you brush your teeth Too clean&amp;#34;. FYI, this does not save you a trip to your dentist for teeth cleaning every 6 mon.</li>
    <li> This is so far above any other tothbrush I have used.  I was very pleased with the results and clean teeth like I have only felt after getting my teeth professionally cleaned.</li>
    <li> Philips Sonicare FlexCare Rechargeable Sonic Toothbrush are great tooth brushes, small slim and easy to work. Battery life is very good.&lt;br /&gt;Small problem they can be trouble some but Philips customer servcie and warranty exchange system compensates for tyhe couple of failures.</li>
    <li> This is that product that when you get it, you realize how lousy of a job you&#x27;ve been doing brushing your teeth all these years.&lt;br /&gt;After a single use, my teeth felt like i&#x27;d just gotten my teeth cleaned at the dentists office.&lt;br /&gt;Ya, it&#x27;s that good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do other brands work as well or better? Doesn&#x27;t even matter to me.&lt;br /&gt;This one does precisely what I purchased it for.</li>
    <li> Philips Sonicare? NEVER AGAIN. This brush works great otherwise, just the battery is terrible and quite frankly a lot of money to spend for it to go bad in such a short period of time.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this toothbrush.  I like the different modes, I like how slender it is, and this design doesn&#x27;t get all gunky like the previous sonicare brush I had.  It is a great toothbrush.</li>
    <li> My 8 year old Sonicare toothbrush died 2 weeks ago after a long and happy life, putting me back in the market for a new rechargeable toothbrush. I already knew I wanted a new Sonicare just because I had been so happy with my old one. I purchased a Philips Sonicare FlexCare from Amazon (the best deal I could find in any store!) and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it. Had I known how improved this newer model would be, I would have ditched my older Sonicare a long time ago to get this one! The brush head is a lot smaller, the toothbrush is lighter and the rechargeable base is a lot smaller too. Did I mention that clean feeling no other toothbrush can give you? If you don&#x27;t have a rechargeable toothbrush, you have to get one of these. There&#x27;s a reason they say Sonicare is the best. It is! You not only won&#x27;t regret it, but you&#x27;ll instantly develop an addiction to brushing your teeth. A bit pricey, YES, maybe, but considering the difference that it makes in your mouth, it&#x27;s worth every penny. Happy brushing!</li>
    <li> I previously owned this same item and needed to replace it so I knew what to expect.  I received the same quality item, as expected.  I did save $70.00 on my purchase through Amazon over buying from a regular walk-in store and received it within a very short time with free delivery.  Very happy on my purchase!</li>
    <li> This is a great toothbrush. Definitely keeps my teeth cleaner than regular brushing. I love the timing mechanism that lets you know how long to spend on each section. The only drawback is that you have to keep purchasing the heads every three months and at about $8 a head, that&#x27;s a lot!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent electric tooth brush.&lt;br /&gt;At my dental check up, the hygienist noted marked improvement.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly reccommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare toothbrush for many years, my previous one died after 8 years.  I&#x27;ve tried other ones before but none of them work as well.</li>
    <li> Best investment I&#x27;ve ever made for my teeth! When the hygienist raves about your teeth (and never previously did) you know you are doing something right!</li>
    <li> Which is rare.  Okay, normally, I wouldn&#x27;t have given another philips product another shot given that I have had really bad experiences with their other products and they have all died very quickly with light use.  Okay, I received this as a replacement due to a previous sonicare (which was a gift) malfunctioning.  Okay, I thought it was a one off with the previous one so I thought okay, i&#x27;ll give it a shot and it lasted way less time.  This thing was dead in under 6 months.  All I did that *could* have caused it something that would speak volumes to this thing.  All I did that was \\&quot;out of the ordinary\\&quot; was wipe away some of the gunk accumulating between the brush and the handle with a napkin with some alcohol on it.  Nothing too invasive.  After this, it completely died.  It took it about a week to go from weak vibrations to almost non-existant vibrations as in they were so faint that I could barely feel them there.  It&#x27;s inexcusable for a brush this expensive to die like this over just a simple cleaning (which I have done on everything from 20 dollar Oral B Vitality brushes to more expensive ones) with no issues but for this to die that quickly from the same level of treatment.  This was my 2nd failure of a Sonicare (the 1st one just suddenly died after changing out heads as well).  I will never buy another Sonicare product again, i&#x27;m going back to Oral B.  That aside, if you are fine with frequent failures, I must admit their warranty service is good and the toothbrush does well at cleaning your teeth.  Just don&#x27;t invest in a lot of heads because you probably won&#x27;t get the same model back in the warranty exchange (I didn&#x27;t).</li>
    <li> Worked one week and broke.  Nothing else needs to be said.  Poor quality, piece of junk.</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush.  Until it stops working.  Over the years I&#x27;ve owned 3 different models and each one was replaced which under warranty and then when the replacement died I bought the newest model.  My most recent replacement toothbrush just died and I&#x27;m definitely looking at other brands for a replacement.</li>
    <li> Grabbed it to replace my old Sonicare which died. It has performed admirably so far and I see myself using it for the foreseeable future.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s takes a little while to get used to it, and after 5 days I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m quite there yet. I still get a chill down my spine when my tooth touches the handle. However, my chompers do feel much cleaner. This thing is very well made and hopefully I&#x27;ll get fully accustomed to this thing soon.</li>
    <li> This purchase was a replacement for the identical item which lasted several years and then would no longer re-charge its battery. The only complaint I have is that it is a bit clumsy to hold while using. Placement of the controls is such that it is too easy to inadvertently press one of the control buttons during use, due to the fact that, in order to hold it during use, your hand covers the controls. However, in the week it took to receive the replacement, I was miserable. My mouth never felt clean. I had either actually forgotten how to use a manual tooth brush or the difference was even greater than I recalled. I also have the Phillips water flosser but I would not recommend that. It&#x27;s very hard to use and doesn&#x27;t do much.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended this to me, and my hygienist has since thanked me as the amount of plaque buildup has decreased by a significant amount.</li>
    <li> This is my second one -- my travel brush. They work well but I prefer to use the diamond brush heads with these to get a more thorough cleaning.</li>
    <li> Actually just the switch wore out, so there was no question of replaceing it or going back to the dark ages of oral hygiene.</li>
    <li> Using a manual toothbrush means when I am tired or in a hurry, I inadvertently skimp on brushing.  Not with the Sonicare, it tells me when I can move from the front side to the back side and then from top to bottom or vice-a-versa, depending on where you start.  There is also a in a hurry feature that gives you a quick brush for the aforementioned skimping situations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was annoying when the head of the brush would touch the tooth when I was getting used to it, but now I no longer notice it when it happens.</li>
    <li> First, I don&#x27;t own this model because I don&#x27;t need the extra features.  I own a cheaper Sonicare with replaceable AA batteries.  I&#x27;ve read all over the places that people complaining the rechargeable products won&#x27;t hold the charge after a short period of time.  Products including wireless land line phones, cell phones, shavers, rechargeable Sonicare, rechargeable tools, ..., you name it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a new wireless phone with 2 handsets several years ago.  Both of the handsets could not hold the charge after one month of usage.  Each handset has two AAA NiCd rechargeable batteries.  I took the batteries out and found out that one of the batteries in each handset has died. Replaced them and both handsets have been working fine until now. Yes, I&#x27;m an electrical engineer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is my finding why the rechargeable batteries failed to hold the charge.&lt;br /&gt;1. Product manufacturers use the cheaper battery (usually NiCd) which has inferior material and no QC at all.&lt;br /&gt;2. NiCd has memory effect. Study by your own as what it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How to use rechargeable products correctly:&lt;br /&gt;1. If the product comes with lemon batteries(like my case above), then the following does not help.&lt;br /&gt;2. Although Lithium and NiMn batteries are claimed to have no memory effect, I don&#x27;t 100% believe it.&lt;br /&gt;3. Regardless the type of batteries in the product, do NOT place it on the charger after each use.  Put is aside not charging.  Only charge it when the batteries are depleted.  Suppose a new rechargeable can be charged 1000 times, you use one count each time you rest it on the charger.  There is an explanation on chemical reaction with electricity but I don&#x27;t intend to go over with it here.&lt;br /&gt;4. Yes, the battery will loose power through its internal drain.  Still, do NOT charge until power is completely out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope it helps.  I&#x27;m not going to answer questions here because I want to live a simple life.</li>
    <li> I has having some tooth sensitivity and someone recommended this tooth brush to me. Since I started using it my teeth don&#x27;t hurt anymore (I brushed too hard). Comes with one head, the brush, and the base. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for an electric brush. The price might be a turn off but my mother has had the same base for 8 years now and it still works as it should!</li>
    <li> I tried the Sonicare and was really surprised by how powerful it is....even in the the \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; setting. This just seems like too much. Saving time brushing will usually mean you are brushing too hard, and likely cause gum recession and tooth abrasion. You need to brush softly, but for between 2-3 minutes, 2-3 times/day (as well as flossing, which nothing can replace). \\&quot;No pain, no gain,\\&quot; does NOT apply to toothbrushing. I certainly would not recommend this for your teeth. I think if they can tone it down 75%, it might actually be good. The gum \\&quot;massager,\\&quot; mode makes no sense. Proper tooth and gingival care has more to do with the prevention of accumulation of plaque, etc., and \\&quot;massaging,\\&quot; the gum is just a great marketing idea. I think the only people who really need to use an electric toothbrush are those with dexterity issues, etc., and they may benefit from the use of an electric toothbrush, but the trade off, e.g. recession, etc., may not be worth it. Also, you can&#x27;t really try to put less pressure on it, because then it will not clean that well. I can also tell you that you will spurt toothpaste all over unless you wait to turn it on when it is in your mouth...the vibration is just that harsh. If you accidently hit your tooth with it, and you will, you will feel like there is a jackhammer in your mouth! I know there are a lot of people out there who are huge fans of these....I am not one of them. If you are still considering this item.....You only get one head, so if you want to share this (if you are a fan) you will have to spend more on another head. It does come with different colored rings so you can identify different brushes, but those rings slip around, perhaps because of the harsh vibration (I pressed pretty hard to put the two pieces together). The actual quality is very good, and it feels sturdy and not cheaply made. I just cannot recommend something that makes my teeth hurt after using it, no matter how it feels, or how cool it looks (and it does look pretty cool and hi-tech). For about two-three percent of the cost of the Sonicare (and no operating cost) you can have a superior instrument to keep your teeth and gums healthy.s look pretty cool and hi-tech). For about two-three percent of the cost of the Sonicare (and no operating cost) you can have a superior instrument to keep your teeth and gums healthy.</li>
    <li> the brushes slipped off due to the vibrating head. This after about one month. And I haven&#x27;t been able to use it since because the brushes continue to fall off. I gave it a 5 star rating for the great cleaning, and 1 for a lasting duration &#x3D; 3 star rating. Now if I could only find that manual.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my third unit in about a year. Right at the top I must say the customer service from Phillips is fantastic, in each case a fast phone call and a new unit arrives in the mail along with a pre-paid shipping label to send the faulty one back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first two failed when the brush head started to wobble and did not transmit vibrations to the business end. Inspection showed the metal shaft loose in the brush. Customer service indicated this had been a problem and they were supposed to re-engineer it. The second brush had the exact same problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The third brush seems to gotten over the loose shaft and had been working fine for the past four months. This morning it was dead as a doornail. The battery was fully charged but nothing happened when I pushed the button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once again a very pleasant person on the other end of the phone listened to my story and now I&#x27;m waiting for my fourth brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ironically prior to buying this I had bought a cheaper model, the Essence. Each time the Flex fails I revert back to the cheaper model and it works just great. I&#x27;m sure at some point I&#x27;ll have gone too long for a free replacement and I&#x27;ll just use the other one full time. I&#x27;d never buy a new Flex model again after my experiences.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a replacement for a previous Sonicare that I&#x27;ve had for years.  I like this one even better.</li>
    <li> I loved the Philips Sonicare Rechargeable Sonic Toothbrush for its excellent dental cleaning and the fact that the vendor charged a fair price.</li>
    <li> Best toothbrush on the market. Great improvements over older models are well noted. Dentist vists go like this now: \\&quot;No cavities, gums look good, teeth are looking good\\&quot;. It&#x27;s cheaper than oral surgery and easy to do. Whitens your teeth, dentist clean feeling aftewards. Will continue to purchase from this product line whenever I need a replacement. Last model lasted 5 years!</li>
    <li> I decided on the FlexCare after getting a recommendation from a friend that has used this model for 2 years. The most dramatic difference for me between a manual toothbrush and this Sonicare Flexcare toothbrush is that my teeth feel cleaner longer. I am completly satisfied with my purchase and would recommend this toothbrush to anyone. I really like that the toothbrush provides you a signal (every thirty seconds) to inform you to move to your next section to brush and that the main program makes you brush for two minutes (like the dentist recommends). I have also noticed with the use of this Sonicare toothbrush that I have a lot less plaque at the gumline. I look forward to my next dentist visit (I better not have any cavities!).</li>
    <li> The brush heads sell for about 400 times what it costs to make them. Look at that before buying.</li>
    <li> wow. An excellent product. Wish I had pulled the trigger years ago. Cleans much better than toothbrush. The stimulation is great. It really does feel just like a cleaning at the dentist. I drink lots of coffee and unfort., smoke. The Sonicare removes all stains. A toothbrush could never do this.&lt;br /&gt;The massage feature is real nice.&lt;br /&gt;The device is small and fits perfectly in the hand. Very slim; not noisy.&lt;br /&gt;Buying one for my daughter now...</li>
    <li> I had a Sonicare before which worked for two years. The old brush head had a tendency to accumulate gunk where it attached to the battery part of the unit. This newer model does not have that issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush works well. I noticed a difference in the health of my gums when I wasn&#x27;t using it. The only downside to this model seems to be that it is easy to hit the \\&quot;off\\&quot; button. I minor inconvenience.</li>
    <li> I have been very happy with these toothbrushes.  But I have had two of them die on me, both in about 5 months time and three in one year.  They work really well, then before they die they start to vibrate harder and seem like &#x27;supper brushers&#x27;.  Then they start dying down.  They still run but within a week, they get less and less vibrations then just a tinny hum.  They both have done the same exact thing.  I have moved residences when I was onto the second one so I know its not to do with voltage or something like that.&lt;br /&gt;I know it&#x27;s bad but I just by a new one from a retailer and pack the old one into that packaging and take it in for a full refund.  The retailer in-turn sends it back to Phillips and Phillips will credit the retailer back for the defective item.  This saves me time, aggravation and shipping costs from a warranty claim.  I&#x27;ll keep doing this until they stop selling this model or Phillips address this issue and stops selling bad units.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: 7-19-11&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now onto my FORTH toothbrush!!!  All of them have died in the same fashion.  I need to lower my rating to one star now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: 12-20-11&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now onto my FIFTH unit now.  I hope a potential buyer reads this and realizes that there is a quality issue here.  Also,  just to note after having this toothbrush a couple years I never use all the features it offers, just the regular cleaning cycle. I highly recommend you buy the Sonicare that just has on and off as I&#x27;m pretty sure I am like 95% of consumers of this toothbrush and only use the one setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: 7-11-12&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not even seven months later the latest brush is dying.  Unbelievable!  It&#x27;s a GREAT brush when new, but now it&#x27;s barley vibrating.  Well you know what&#x27;s next... I&#x27;ll buy a new one and return this one.  I really love these toothbrushes, they just die way too soon!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit:3-28-13&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sixth one died now...  Well lets try number 7!!!</li>
    <li> Works great. Love the new head style and the longer lasting battery than our old style screw-in head sonicare.</li>
    <li> When it works, it&#x27;s great. But it broke after less than 1 year of use. The motor is making huge noise but doesn&#x27;t provide as much motion.</li>
    <li> Our Sonicare rechargeable toothbrush finally died. Had it a long time. Went to Amazon.com, only place, and ordered a new Phillips Sonicare FlexCare Rechargeable Sonic Toothbrush. Just love it. Works beautiful and had many features to use at a good price. Fantastic!</li>
    <li> Love this toothbrush! It gets my teeth very clean!</li>
    <li> Love this.  Gift for my husband!</li>
    <li> bought this 1 year ago and it died a couple of days ago. I did not believe many complaints about its quality, now I do.</li>
    <li> The only features I used were the regular cycle and the &amp;#34;go&amp;#34; cycle (lasts one minute total).  However, after less than two years, the unit starting coming on by itself while on the charger, and when I press the &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; button it won&#x27;t start. It&#x27;s acting funny, just like the one I had before (similar one, which had a similar problem but that happened within a year, so it was under warranty).&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m buying the basic one with just one button. Hopefully, that one will last longer than two years.</li>
    <li> Wonderful and came in record time!</li>
    <li> I have been very pleased with the results of using the Sonicare Toothbrush.  I tend to &amp;#34;over brush&amp;#34; my teeth, so the timer in this toothbrush helps me to stick to an appropriate time of brushing.  I am sure the same would be true for those who tend to &amp;#34;under brush&amp;#34;.  Good product, I would and will purchase it again. (Nothing lasts forever)</li>
    <li> My second Sonicaire toothbrush and I love it. Fewer speeds but more noticeable difference between them. The &amp;#34;Sensitive&amp;#34; option is gentler while still highly effective. The perfect toothbrush!</li>
    <li> This is a great electric toothbrush...I highly recommend it.  It is programmable for short or long tooth rushing sessions.  The toothbrushes last a long time and are available  at Bed,Bath,Beyond (with a coupon) formless than on the Phillips website.</li>
    <li> Good toothbrush but it only lasted two years. I&#x27;ve had others; we&#x27;ve used these since they first came out. They get fancier, and don&#x27;t last as long. Early models did get weaker over time. This morning, this one just switched to such a weak vibration now that it is useless-in the middle of brushing my teeth! Went to Phillips web page, followed all their instructions, none of those things apply or work. So they make these for more money now, and they barely outlast the warranty! We&#x27;re going to try to submit it and see what they do....and in the meantime, since I have a supply of brushes, I&#x27;ll order their cheapest model. No more deluxe crap from Phillips!</li>
    <li> I bought this toothbrush on July 2nd, 2010 and it stopped working on November 3rd, 2010.  It didn&#x27;t even last three months.  I wonder who will be responsible for the $100 I lost.&lt;br /&gt;You can contact me at iclare@racsa.co.cr</li>
    <li> This sonicare has changed my whole way of cleaning teeth! It is so easy and feels great knowing my teeth are getting really clean. It is a little pricey but totally worth it. I love that it is rechargeable so I never have to worry about batteries.</li>
    <li> I have been using a Sonicare Elite for around 11 years. It was beginning to visibly wear and battery life was deteriorating so I decided to replace it with a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the size of the new handle. The buttons are placed such that the settings can be inadvertently changed. It would be nice if Philips could devise some way to unlock them for setting changes, maybe by holding a button for a few seconds. I doubt that I will ever change the settings from what they are currently. But this is not that big a deal. The brush head is a much simpler design than the Elite version and MUCH less likely to harbor residue that goes stinky over time like the Elite head. The new heads are also less expensive than the Elite heads, likely due to their simpler design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charging base is very nicely designed and a big improvement over the one that came with the Elite. Cable management is improved too. I doubt I will separate the two pieces of the base for travel. If I am going to be gone long enough that I might need to recharge, the whole thing is small enough to take along.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, so good!</li>
    <li> I recently bought the Philips Sonicare FlexCare toothbrush. I did compare this model with the Braun but, liked the SoniCare features better. Great design, great battery life, great feel great brushing modes and great results. My Hygentist had recommeded that I look at electric toothbrushes to help reduce plaque build up. I tried a cheaper model and did not see any results but, this model really cleans and whitens. I like the vibration, weight, design and having my mouth feel like it was professionaly cleaned. It does take a about a week to get totally adjusted to the correct angles and feel but, it is worth it. I would not want to be without it now and did use my manual toothbrush just for giggles and it was like stepping way back in time. I had no idea that a good high end toothbrush could be such a wonderful tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Philips&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GW, Baltimore</li>
    <li> I bought 2 Sonicare Flexcare for my wife and me to replace older versions.  First checked Consumer Reports and found the product highly rated.  Then checked around for a good price.  Found the price on Amazon, although not inexpensive, still much lower than other sources.</li>
    <li> I had this toothbrush for three years and it just broke. The warranty is only for two years. Sonicare will not replace the defective product! DO NOT BUY!</li>
    <li> Glad I bought it. I swear my teeth are whiter now after using it for a month or two. no regrets.</li>
    <li> This is my first electronic toothbrush and I love it! I reviewed all the ones out there and even went to check them out at Bed Bath and Beyond. My teeth feel amazing and super clean. You do get used to the vibration and I like the 30 second reminders to change positions. Amazon has the best price by far for the toothbrush, but for the replacements I found a package of 7 for $35 at Costco... so pile away!!</li>
    <li> This is my third Sonicare toothbrush, and I must say that this is the best one to date.  They changed the design to make it easier to clean, and the brush is not as aggressive on the gums.  15 years of great checkups thanks to sonicare!  Amazon had the best price by a large margin.</li>
    <li> Over all, it does perform a good job but bettery life is short.&lt;br /&gt;I had an old model before this one and that one had a lot longer bettery life.&lt;br /&gt;Good tooth brush!</li>
    <li> This latest Sonicare product was a replacement for my original Sonicare tooth brush.  It&#x27;s the best product to keep your teeth as clean as possible.  I will replace it again, down the road, when the time comes.</li>
    <li> Purchased based upon Amazon critiques.  Works better than expected.  Teeth much smoother than with hand brushing or my old Oral-B.  Uses much less toothpaste, a bit hard to apply to the brush, which has a small head.  Still follow with floss and a Listerine rinse.  Not due to see my dentist for a while, which will be the acid test.  But, so far, I am very satisfied with the produce.</li>
    <li> Bought this toothbrush a year ago.  In the past few days, my reliable electric toothbrush started to act &#x27;possessed&#x27;.  To elaborate, the lights on the toothbrush would turn on in the middle of the night, even when it wasn&#x27;t plugged into the charger.  I saw that the lights might be affecting the battery life so I put it on the charger.  Long story short, the handle doesn&#x27;t seem to be holding any more charge and I decided to look for another electric toothbrush.  When I went back on Amazon, it reminded me that I bought it on there so I checked the warranty for it.  I found that it has a 2 year warranty so I decided to call the number on the Phillips Sonicare website.  I talked with a real person and described the situation with her.  After our discussion, she helped me get a new Sonicare toothbrush handle to replace the faulty one I have!  I will have to send in my broken handle but I was originally going to buy a new one or look into an Oral-B.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The call took less than 10 minutes and the outcome was better than I expected.  Saved myself $110 from buying a new electric toothbrush and looking forward to having clean teeth again!  :)  Amazon and Phillips Sonicare, you rock!</li>
    <li> Now I no longer have to worry about damaging my gums or tooth surfaces. I use it without applying much pressure, and I just move it around gently. I&#x27;m a compulsive brusher and have an old groove in one tooth, at the gumline. To me, it&#x27;s worth it just to protect my teeth and gums from further wear. Also, it feels really good--a nice oral massage. I can tell my mouth is getting much cleaner. A sister recommended this one to me, because it has made her periodontal pockets smaller and healthier over time. Her dentist and hygienist can tell the difference immediately when they look at her mouth.</li>
    <li> This is the second one I&#x27;ve bought and NEITHER of them has lasted more than a year. For $100+ the damn thing should last more than a year!!! I&#x27;m completely frustrated with this brand and am looking at some other brand for my next toothbrush because Phillips quality SUCKS.</li>
    <li> I love my electric toothbrush it does what it says and more it also has a great massage feature for your gums.</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t buy any other toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I like this toothbrush but there is a complaint about it. That is why I take out a star.&lt;br /&gt;I do not like the way it attracts dirt and other bathroom particles.&lt;br /&gt;Also the base its not supportive enough for its weight.&lt;br /&gt;It would be nice if the power cord wouldn&#x27;t interfere with its balance and if it would be a bit longer and somehow stay put,instead of hanging in the air.&lt;br /&gt;The brush is a bit to small and gets wasted easily which can get pretty expensive.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s all the complaint:).</li>
    <li> I bought this item 2 yrs. and 11 months ago and it has already started to act up.  I don&#x27;t know what warranty there is on this product but it seems that for the price I paid, It should have lasted longer.  I&#x27;m disappointed and will probably go back to my Oral B.</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd Sonicare product over the last number of years and it replaces an older model that wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge any more. It&#x27;s a great brush and cost almost half as much on Amazon then it would have cost me to buy locally.  I use it everyday and love it.</li>
    <li> I HAD ANOTHER BRAND, LIKE THIS ONE BETTER.  I HAVE USED  AN ELECTRIC BRUSH FOR YEARS, LIKE THIS ONE MOST OF ALL SO FAR&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WELL, I HAVE HAD THIS BRUSH FOR ABOUT SIX MONTS, I STILL LIKE THE MAIN BRUSH, BUT I AM GOING TO BUY ANOTHER BRAND VERY SOON, GOING BACK TO ORAL B.  THE REASON, WELL THE BRUSHES THAT ARE AVAILABLE HAVE TO BE THE VERY WORST BRUSHES I HAVE EVER USED.  THE OPNR THAT CAM WITH IT WAS FAIR, I ORDERED  3MORE RECOMMENDED BY AMAZON, NOW THAT WAS A MISTAKE.  THE FIRST BRUSH LASTED ABOUT FOUR MONTHS, THAT IS ABOUT AVERAGE, THE FIRST NEW BRUSR IS WORN OUT AFTER LESS THAN ONE MONTH.  NOT ONLY DOES IT NOT LAST, IF IT WERE ANY SMALLER, YOU WOULD HAVE A DIFFICULT TIME FINDING IT.  I AM NOT PLEASED AT ALL, SO IF YOU CAN NOT GET GOOD BRUSHES, THAN THE HANBDLE IS WORTHLESS.  WHAT A SHAME TO SPEN THAT MUCH AND THEN JUNK IT, THAT I CAN NOT AFFORD. I HAVE LOST ALLRESPECT FOR PHILLIPS.</li>
    <li> wife loved the first one til it died 2 1/2 years later. now we have another one to replace it. dentist said her teeth look amazing after the start of use from the first one. price of refill head is a bit much</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for someone else, and I hear so many great raves about it.  He loves all the options, thinks his teeth are cleaner than they have ever been, and I might get one for myself!</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush.  My teeth are so much cleaner and the feeling lasts all day!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this toothbrush!!</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush, I just use the main setting (2 minutes) and it makes my teeth so clean!  Partnered with the Reach Gum Care floss, it feels like I&#x27;ve been to the dentist! :)</li>
    <li> Results have been quite good. I am happy that we made the switch from the traditional toothbrush.  Sorry we didn&#x27;t make the switch sooner.</li>
    <li> This makes your teeth seriously clean. When used correctly, the head lasts much longer than you would expect. My dental hygienist I&#x27;d always impressed with my teeth so clean.</li>
    <li> great product.  Like how it works</li>
    <li> I first bought a Sonicare electric toothbrush in 1996 for about 90 dollars. It was a beast, but it always cleaned the tough parts of tartar and plaque off my back teeth with ease. Everyday felt like a visit to the dentist. It finally died in 2010-an amazing run for a rechargeable battery. I obviously wanted a replacement, and much to my surprise the line has expanded. The cost is reasonable, considering its close to the 1996 price.&lt;br /&gt;The obvious differences are:&lt;br /&gt;-Easier to clean heads&lt;br /&gt;-Longer life between charging&lt;br /&gt;-smaller form factor&lt;br /&gt;-Smaller and easier to get into the back areas.&lt;br /&gt;-Nifty battery display.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush lasts so long on a charge it&#x27;s been nearly a month since I got it and I&#x27;m still on 50%.&lt;br /&gt;The brush has a higher frequency and is faster-a little offputting at first.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s been great and the difference between this and a manual brush is an order of magnitude.</li>
    <li> 3 minutes with thesis like 10 minutes with a regular brush only much much better for my teeth and gums.</li>
    <li> By far the best oral hygiene product available.  Makes thorough tooth brushing a breeze.</li>
    <li> I rarely write reviews, but this toothbrush is so bad I just need to warn everyone.  I have been using an Oral B toothbrush for years, but tried to switch to Sonicare because I heard it was so much better.  This thing is week.  My teeth never felt fully cleaned.  I am returning this and buying a new Oral B.</li>
    <li> I loved my original sonicare brush that lasted for so many years that I lost count. This flexcare broke in three months. The new pop on brush head is handy, but full of issues. The metal shaft that you pop the brush head on broke--now the brush just sort of flops around. I called customer service and found out that this is an known issue with this model. They are sending me a new one, but in reading reviews I found that other people are on their third or fourth replacement. I say stick with the older models.</li>
    <li> Vast improvement over the model I had 4 years ago. For I while in the last year I was using cheaper version of electric Sonicare toothbrush and there is no comparison. Thank you Philips!</li>
    <li> One of the best toothbrushes I have ever used.  The multi function options are great.  This is also a good gum stimulator. The replacement heads are expensive but last a long time.</li>
    <li> The unit&#x27;s battery has failed and will simply not charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the way this product performs, but I&#x27;m not sure what the anticipated life of this product is supposed to be. For $120 (plus the cost of replacement heads), it ought to last longer than 16 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, this product has a 2 year warranty, so I called Philips CS. The rep asked me to try to reset the unit by placing it on the charger base and pressing the power button for 10 seconds. When that didn&#x27;t do anything, she simply asked for the model and serial numbers (as well as my address) and said a replacement would be sent out (with a return mailing label to return the dead unit). I don&#x27;t know if the replacement will be a new or refurbished unit, but so far dealing with Philips CS has been hassle free. Now we&#x27;ll see how long the replacement unit lasts.</li>
    <li> Purchased in Oct &#x27;10 on eBay (brand new), but b/c it was a third party seller Philips said the warranty was void.  I am fine with that, but it shouldn&#x27;t have stopped working after 5 months.</li>
    <li> And that&#x27;s the plus and the minus. I do like the way this works but every couple of years or so it dies on me so I&#x27;ve had to get new ones. It may be that it doesn&#x27;t travel well so I&#x27;m trying it now without taking it on trips</li>
    <li> This is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used one of these for years. This was a replacement purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was exactly as advertised, arrived sooner than expected, and save me some money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> The Sonicare does a wonderful job of brushing. My complaint is the design.  The button for changing Modes is in the wrong place and too sensitive. I am constantly inadvertently hitting the mode button while brushing. Very irritating.  I would get a model without the mode button.</li>
    <li> I tried to save by buying the cheaper model, but that was such a bad idea.  I returned it to Philips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to buy this again because my wife missed it more than I did.  Pricey, but great.  Very powerful.  Although, I like having the UV light cleaner charger instead of this plain charger.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the Sonicare for about 2 months now and I love it.  My dentist said that she doesn&#x27;t normally tell people to use a Sonicare unless they really need it, but that it&#x27;s going to make your teeth feel like they&#x27;ve been polished every time you use it.  It does make my teeth feel clean afterwards and it&#x27;s so much easier to brush my teeth well.  I had trouble knowing how long to brush my teeth, so the timer is probably one of the best features.  The nice thing about the newer versions of the brush, like Flexcare, is that they have cheaper brush heads, especially if you buy them at Costco.  35 dollars for 7 heads.  They recommend that you switch out heads every season, so 4 times a year, but you might be able to get away with longer.  The battery life is great.  I can take this on travel with me and it&#x27;ll last at least a week, brushing twice a day.  I never ended up using the extra modes, even though I thought they were nice to have.  For people who are new to using the brush, it may feel awkward so they have the brush move slower at first and then get you up to normal speed, for the first 10 times or so.  If you&#x27;re already used to it, you can bypass the break-in speeds.  Just read the manual for instructions.  The carrying case will keep dirt off the brush, but you&#x27;ll have to pull the brush head off to get it in there.  It won&#x27;t stop anything from hitting the button and activating the brush, either.  So you may want to invest in a hard case if you want to travel with it.  I didn&#x27;t end up getting the UV cleanser because I didn&#x27;t see any point in that--you&#x27;ll just be replacing heads every so often.  Since when did you ever UV clean your toothbrush?  I never did, and I never plan to.  Saves you a little bit of cash.  The newer brush is lighter and better with energy usage compared to older versions, so that was part of the reason why I chose this one.  Great brush, I definitely recommend to everyone if you can afford it.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush has exceeded my expectations.  The grip and feel of the handle is excellent and the options provided are a pleasure to use, and I use everyone of them (clean, sensitive, and massage). Also, this brush performs far better than the previous Sonicare I owned; as a matter of fact, I am now brushing more than I ever have. I made my decision based on reading other reviews just as you are doing now. Then, I went to a drug store to hold one in my hand--that did it. I came home and ordered it. Amazon is the way to shop and I have made several purchases with them and have not been disappointed yet.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush really makes your teeth feel clean and I like the timer which indicates how long to spend on each part of your mouth.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Philips Sonicare toothbrush for years &amp; the FlexCare, for last 3-4 years &amp; it is the best product out there for brushing teeth. I have had the best check ups since using FlexCare &amp; is supported by my dentist. My dentist office tells me using the FlexCare, they have noted a huge improvement in most of their patients. I recently purchased a replacement in May 2011, from Amazon &amp; rate their service as superior. I ordered it standard delivery &amp; came sooner than they indicated.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is expensive but SO worth the money. After using it for a year, my dentist could notice the difference. I feel like my teeth aren&#x27;t clean anymore unless I use my electric toothbrush - it has a timer to tell you how long to brush and when to switch to different areas of your mouth and is really easy to clean the teeth in the way back of your mouth as well. Holds a charge for a long time and I always find the replacement heads on sale at one place or another. Plus, multiple people can use the same tooth brush if you use the color coding disks!</li>
    <li> Same as described, good product..I love it</li>
    <li> This is my second Sonic electric toothbrush.  I finally wore the first one out after years of great service.  I was so impressed by the great cleaning job it did, I bought ones for my wife, both sons and my mother.  Can&#x27;t get a better endorsement than that.</li>
    <li> Very inexpensive tooth electronic brushing and performs it in half the time of a regular toothbrush.  Bought two for the family for Xmas and they use every day religiously. My dentist says it is the best way to brush.</li>
    <li> My dentist strongly recommended this toothbrush so I gave away my OralB, which had been with me 3 years (and is still working by the way).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first two brushes were sent back under warranty. The third lasted until 2 days after warranty expiration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this price, quality control shouldn&#x27;t be an issue... but unfortunately it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the brush is working, it&#x27;s great. It has helped my dental checkups for sure.</li>
    <li> I have always been skeptical about electric toothbrushes. I always brush vigorously with a regular brush, often getting through one in little over a week. So how could these expensive tooth ticklers be any better than that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I don&#x27;t know how but within 1 week of getting my electric brush my teeth were far whiter than they had ever been before. Every time I brush my teeth I feel like I&#x27;ve just come back from the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What really pleases me is the battery life. I travel a lot for work and would be confident that this brush will not need charging whilst away on a 2 week trip - even when brushing 3 times a day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have the slightest desire to buy an electric toothbrush get it! You will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never felt so clean. I&#x27;ve spent a good chuck of my life living in a \\&quot;spin-brush\\&quot; lie. I want to tell my past self to buy this tooth brush, but I can&#x27;t figure out how to do this yet. Shine on you crazy tooth brush.</li>
    <li> This is a great toothbrush, but I don&#x27;t use most of the features.  I wish I had purchased a less expensive model with standard settings.</li>
    <li> I love the Sonic-care advanced cleaning system, and the price on Amazon was way below a certain well known discount store. Every time I use it, it feels like I have just left a cleaning appointment at the dentist. Really good! Try it, you will like it!</li>
    <li> I got the Philips Sonicare Flexcare upon the suggestion of my Dentist.  It took about a week for me to get use to the vibration but once I did I thoroughly enjoyed the clean without the abrasion of using a \\&quot;medium\\&quot; toothbrush which was ruining my gums.  I really like the fact it holds the charge for at least a week with 2 brushes a day so I can travel without the charger.  I also love that it lets me know when to move on to clean the next quardrant of the 4 areas needing to be addressed.  The only downside is I still use a medium toothbrush to brush my tongue but that&#x27;s it.  I am a true convert to the electric toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I bought this one to replace an older Sonic that I&#x27;ve had for the past six years. My old one served me well, but this newer model seems much more powerful. You can really feel the difference between brushing with a Sonicare toothbrush compared to a traditional non-electric toothbrush. Your teeth just feel much cleaner and the Sonic is especially great at removing food items that tend to get stuck in your teeth, such as popcorn. Yes, flossing works wonders, but if it&#x27;s late at night and you don&#x27;t feel like flossing till the morning, the Sonicare always comes through when a traditional brush just won&#x27;t do.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll admit, this is my first electric toothbrush that cost over 20$.  I was going to buy an Oral B Pro 5000, but these were on sale for much cheaper.  The flexcare is the comparable model to the Pro 5000, so I went with it for that, and also because I try my hardest to avoid P&amp;G products because of their tendency to test on animals.  Granted, I know they&#x27;re not testing their toothbrushes on animals (though, that may help with lab animal dental care!) it just seemed like a worthy plus for Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived, the packaging was surprisingly easy to break through, and I set about to charging it for 18 hours... just kidding, that&#x27;s what the package says but I ended up charging mine for about 6 hours before using it for the first time.  What?  I just couldn&#x27;t wait!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had purchased two of these (one with the sanitizer) because I was unaware how easy it was to change brush heads.  It&#x27;s literally just one placement.  No screwing, you just place the head with the brushes facing the \\&quot;panel\\&quot;.  Now I realize I definitely could have just gotten one toothbrush for my spouse and me to share.  Unfortunately, I just don&#x27;t feel like a good person returning a toothbrush for no other reason than my own disbelief!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My GOODNESS!  This thing is powerful.  The first time I used it, I actually wasn&#x27;t sure I was going to be able to handle it.  I only used it for about a minute, gingerly pressing it to my teeth before pulling it back, and this was on the sensitive setting.  What power!  It&#x27;s now been a week, and now I can make the full three minutes of the \\&quot;Max Care\\&quot; setting and I look forward to an extra thirty seconds or so on the massage setting, which I just run over my gums where they meet my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what the settings are from what I can tell.. max care is three minutes of alternating toothbrushing gloriousness.  It alternates regular speed with the massage.  The massage is formulated for your gums, so I&#x27;m not sure if there&#x27;s any benefit to this being in your toothbrushing routine.  Go care is a minute of the standard speed, which apparently is for those of you who can&#x27;t spare an extra minute to brush your teeth. If you neglect to choose go care or max care, you apparently get 2 minutes of \\&quot;Clean\\&quot; setting with little breaks in which it&#x27;s suggesting you move to another quadrant of your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I initially thought the little breaks were because I was pressing too hard and it was automatically stopping for that reason, but no.. perhaps I should have read my manual instead of just assuming.  I wasn&#x27;t pressing, really. ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading my manual, I also learned that my first time wasn&#x27;t even as powerful as it could have been!  Apparently for the first 15 uses it doesn&#x27;t vibrate at full power in an attempt to get you used to the toothbrush.  If you read your manual, you can find how to turn that option off.  I also learned it doesn&#x27;t even have a setting to alert you if you&#x27;re pressing too hard.  I thought that was kind of standard for expensive toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow- this item has made my teeth so happy.  They&#x27;re dentist clean on a daily basis, and I had to use a regular toothbrush as I forgot to pack mine for an outing and was appalled at how \\&quot;unclean\\&quot; my teeth were.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Gets teeth wonderfully clean&lt;br /&gt;-Lightweight&lt;br /&gt;-Aesthetically pleasing&lt;br /&gt;-Simple operation, made even more simple by reading the manual&lt;br /&gt;-Nice options and settings&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Nothing to alert you of if you are pressing too hard&lt;br /&gt;-Price point could be considered high&lt;br /&gt;-Very STRONG and something to get used to at first&lt;br /&gt;-Creates a lot of saliva, which your husband WILL fling at your just-washed bathroom mirror&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I think it is the MOST WONDERFUL ITEM I&#x27;VE PURCHASED.  Well.  This week at least.  Again, keep in mind that I have no electric toothbrush to compare this to.outine.  Go care is a minute of the standard speed, which apparently is for those of you who can&#x27;t spare an extra minute to brush your teeth.

Pros:  -Gets teeth wonderfully clean  -Lightweight  -Aesthetically pleasing  -Simple operation, made even more simple by reading the manual  -Nice options and settings  Cons:  -Nothing to alert you of if you are pressing too hard  -Price point could be considered high  -Very STRONG and something to get used to at first  -Creates a lot of saliva, which your husband WILL fling at your just-washed bathroom mirror  All in all, I think it is the MOST WONDERFUL ITEM I&#x27;VE PURCHASED.

    <li> We went through 4 brush handles. I&#x27;ve bought the two-pack from Costco twice. Each time the handle lasts about 1-2 years (daily use). I finally switched to Oral-B. I like the feel of the Sonicare better (feels cleaner after brushing) but I can&#x27;t justify having to buy a new brush so often when it is so expensive.</li>
    <li> This is the one that works. We even take it on trips with us all over.</li>
    <li> This is my second Philips Sonicare Toothbrush in 13 years.  The first one lasted a long time.  This new slim style head is very nice.  It stays much cleaner than the old style I had.  What I don&#x27;t like about this toothbrush is that I have trouble keeping it from rolling on the counter when trying to apply toothpaste to it.  I have trouble keeping my hand/fingers from hitting the power button which turns it off while in use.  It has several settings and you have to keep pushing the button to travel to the setting you want to use.  I use the same setting every time, and it would be nice to have it &amp;#34;stay&amp;#34; on that choice.</li>
    <li> this is my third one of this product. lasts a long time and battery charge lasts quite a while. good job cleaning teeth</li>
    <li> I like the brush and the cleaning action.&lt;br /&gt;I used my previous Sonicare for 10 years or so until the battery was no longer capable to hold the charge.&lt;br /&gt;Another positive thing about this brush that the replacement heads are not as expensive as my earlier model was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a couple of negative things about this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The on/off switch is very sensitive. A minor touch can activate it. This combined with the soft \\&quot;Travel pouch\\&quot;, leads to frequent self turn-on when it is in your travel bag. Even though you know it will turn off in 2 minutes, you start digging for it when you hear it buzzing. I think Philips should come up with a retrofit solution to fix this problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My other, smaller, complaint is about the grip. When it gets wet (or slimy)during its use, it becomes unnecessarily difficult to hold in your hand. The rubberized handle is smooth and combined with its small diameter it requires multiple readjustment in your hand while brushing.</li>
    <li> Got this for my son, and his &amp;#34;grades&amp;#34; from the dentist have consistently been better since!</li>
    <li> I have used Sonicare toothbrushes since they were first marketed, and love them. The Flexcare design is so much easier to keep clean than the earlier models, but the need for all the different speeds is a bit absurd. I never use them. Also, the placement of the button to change speeds is very poorly located, right where you hold the handle. Every time I use the brush, it inadvertently changes speed and is very annoying to have to stop and reset. VERY poor design, and wish I had purchased the same brush without the speed choices.</li>
    <li> This product was not reliable and with average brushing (once or twice a day) the toothbrush stopped working quickly after I purchased it. I do not recommend this vendor.</li>
    <li> I used to be a promoter of this toothbrush because it work well but now I have to issue a warning!  This is a relatively expensive brush and is supposed to last 3-5 years.  I have had two brushes each lasting just over 1 year.  In contacting the company twice and asking them to explain why a brush that is supposed to last 3-5 years has only lasted a fraction of that time for two different brushes, they say there is nothing they can do.  I do not expect a free brush as this brush is now out of warranty but I do a \\&quot;real\\&quot; discount on a replacement.  Phillips offered a 15% coupon for their online store which will not be up and running for 2 months. This remedy is hardly practical as I need a brush now. If they stand behind their product and their store is unavailable why can&#x27;t they offer a discount at any retailer?  Further, 15% is too low.  If you read online you will see many posts about this brush breaking.  Too bad it isn&#x27;t reliable because it was a great brush; anyway expect it to last 1 year and then with a hassle you can get the second year under warranty and then you are done.</li>
    <li> Works exactly as advertised.  Visibly reduced the plaque on my teeth after just one use.  Would definitely recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended a few years ago and I tried it.&lt;br /&gt;Initially it felt like a micro-jackhammer in my mouth. That was some STRONG vibration!  I almost couldn&#x27;t continue...but then slowly I got used to it.  It has made a big difference in my oral health.&lt;br /&gt;My wife and I share it (with our own separate heads of course)&lt;br /&gt;Then about a year later, it died.  The mechanical \\&quot;drive\\&quot; linkage inside broke.&lt;br /&gt;Philips replaced it on warranty.&lt;br /&gt;Just recently (two years later), it died again.  Same issue- mechanical drive linkage broke.&lt;br /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s a great design...options are good and it&#x27;s got a nice slim feel in the hand.  Charging is good.  And it really helps your teeth and gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But...on the down side:&lt;br /&gt;Expensive for what it is!&lt;br /&gt;Brush heads are astronomically expensive!...$30 for (3) half-size toothbrushes?  Seriously? As if the unit were not expensive enough already.&lt;br /&gt;THE DRIVE TRAIN IS OBVIOUSLY OF POOR DESIGN/MATERIALS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really on the fence whether we will purchase another one or not.&lt;br /&gt;Even if they charged another $25 bucks to make the damn thing durable, I&#x27;d probably do it.  It&#x27;s just that I&#x27;m already paying a Mercedes price but still getting a Kia durability.  Once I&#x27;m paying more than $100 for a darn toothbrush, that sucker better LAST!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;grumble...grumble...&lt;br /&gt;EDIT/UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;I have a coupon from my dentist for $10 off a new Sonicare.  Amazon says it&#x27;s invalid. I contacted Philips and they said only the dentist can tell you where to use our coupon.  Philips does not know how to redeem it. My dentist doesn&#x27;t know; they just stick coupons on the shelf.  Philips told me they would give me new brusheads.  i thought that was funny, since my toothbrush is now broken.  Then they offered to give me 15% off a new toothbrush if I ordered on their website...\\&quot;would I like to accept that offer to use when Philip&#x27;s website is not down and being fixed/repaired?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously.  Even with a 15% discount, their price is still almost 20% more than amazon.  Now I&#x27;m going to pay full retail for another Flexcare?  Maybe this one will last a year and a half?  That&#x27;s my average so far.&lt;br /&gt;The funniest part?  Philip&#x27;s tagline is ...  \\&quot;Sense and Simplicity\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Isn&#x27;t that charming?t, their price is still almost 20% more than amazon.  Now I&#x27;m going to pay full retail for another Flexcare?  Maybe this one will last a year and a half?  That&#x27;s my average so far.&lt;br /&gt;The funniest part?  Philip&#x27;s tagline is ...  \\&quot;Sense and Simplicity\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Isn&#x27;t that charming?</li>
    <li> Over 25+ years I have purchased countless Sonicare brushes for family members and Christmas gifts. My dentist always comments on how great my teeth and gums are. However, I have to give the latest Flex Care Plus 1 star because it has been a major disappointment. After the first year mine stopped working. Several months later my daughter called to inform me hers stopped working, too. The company replaced them under warranty but 1 year later they both stopped working again. The company rep told me they should last for 3-5 years but, even though the replacement was 1 year old, the warranty is for 2 years from the date of purchase. In the past, I have not had trouble with their product but this Flexcare should be advertised as a disposable tooth brush because it only lasts a year.  I feel $175 for 2 year use is an exorbitant expense for each toothbrush. Today I will purchase an Oral B in hopes it will last longer.</li>
    <li> Great product for short term.  Battery has to be replaced often.</li>
    <li> A good way to clean your teeth. Slim design help you to hold better and the vibration is quite strong. I like it a lot.</li>
    <li> Finally decided it was time to get ride of the Elite 7500. The new brush cost less and does a bit better job. Sonic&#x27;s will last a long time if you always leave then on the charger.</li>
    <li> I started out with a Colgate Spin Brush until I was convinced I would like and use an electric tooth brush.  Once I was convinced and wore out the cheap one, I bought this one. My favorite feature is the multiple options of how rough it will brush.  I use either sensitive or normal clean depending on how tender my gums/teeth are that day.</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase of this toothbrush.  I&#x27;ve owned the previous one for several years.  It works great, cleans your teeth, is gentle on your gums, and holds its charge for many brushings.  A good investment in keeping healthy teeth.</li>
    <li> This is a replacement for an earlier model finally died after almost 5 years.&lt;br /&gt;Since using these toothbrushes I have spend less time in the dentist chair.&lt;br /&gt;Of course you have to brush 2-4 minutes twice a day.</li>
    <li> The price is  $125.00 less than C.V.S. drugstore. The product is the same as what is sold for $225.00. This is the best place and price I could find ! ! ! !</li>
    <li> The battery in this toothbrush lasted 6 months. Total waste of money.</li>
    <li> I bought this toothbrush brush based on a recommendation from my hygienist.  I was skeptical but I thought I&#x27;d try it.  I discovered it&#x27;s not just another power toothbrush but rather a professional teeth cleaner.  It takes a little getting used to but hang there...... the results are worth it!  I&#x27;m glad I laid down the bucks for my dental health.</li>
    <li> This lives up to its hype. The timer lets you brsuh upper and lower each for a total of 2 minutes. There are settings for brushing and gum massage. And it has a handy travel charging component. It is far superior to the Oral B we used to use.</li>
    <li> This is the one. they should rate this one in horsepower. Hands down best I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and the timer helps me brush longer. I noticed my teeth were whiter after the first use.</li>
    <li> This model uses a lithium ion battery (the HealthyWhite also uses Li-ion).  This is the reason I chose this product over oral B or the other cheaper sonicare models. All the Oral-B models that I could find used either NiCad (toxic) or nickel-metal-hydride (NiMH). Previous experience with NiMH batteries that they wear out quickly.  And since you cannot replace the batteries in rechargeable toothbrushes, I didn&#x27;t want to have to purchase another one in 2 years.  I&#x27;ve had very good luck with Li-ion batteries in laptops, cameras, phones, etc.  They hold their charge better and last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Justifying the price is difficult.  Although I got a very good deal at a warehouse store for the flexcare with 2 handles and UV sanitizer.  The replacement brushes are also more expensive.  However, if I can get a few more years out of this because it uses a better battery, then the price will be more comparable to cheaper models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as cleaning ability, I feel that it is doing a better job than I would do with manual brushing.  I would be surprised if the cleaning ability is significantly better than the oral-b models.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000EHNDD0 Philips Sonicare Elite e9500 Custom Care Power Toothbrush]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;excellent product--perfect for more complete dental care-</li>
    <li> As usual, this Sonicare performs great... My teeth are noticeably more white, and feel very clean.</li>
    <li> It works awesome.  I find that my teeth feel really clean compared to the manual toothbrush.  It holds it&#x27;s charge for up to a week.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve written another review of this product years ago. This new version is even better.  BUY ONE.  It cleans your teeth like the dentist does -- every day. If I had to buy one of these every year or two, it would still be VERY worth the price.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, should have bought one a long time ago. Get&#x27;s your mouth and teeth much more clean than a regular toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I purchased a Philips Sonicare from my dentist.  The initial unit failed within six months.  He gave me a replacement unit.  That has now failed within 24 months.  These units are relatively expensive. Unless I&#x27;m an outlier, these appear to be very poorly manufactured.  Further, Philips customer service was only marginally helpful, offering to replace the unit if it was within warranty but not for 10 days.  This is a long time when you&#x27;re talking about your toothbrush!  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this company, which appears to make shoddy products and not to care about its customers.  Buy from Philips&#x27; competition!</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is excellent.  I bought my first one 4 years ago and I swear by it.  The only complain I have is the lack of a replaceable battery.  My first one lasted over 4 years.  At over $100 this is a bit pricey.  I honestly don&#x27;t know why this thing is so expensive but it works well.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the timer.  I am smart enough to know when I have finished brushing my teeth.</li>
    <li> I love the brush and the way it works, but I have had two fail in the last 3 years.  The first time the unit stopped vibrating and they replaced it.  The second time, it started turning on and off randomly (sometimes in my cabinet), and they told me I have to buy a new one.  So get it if you want a nice toothbrush, but plan on replacing it soon after the warranty runs out.</li>
    <li> The sonciare flexcare has changed our lives.  my wife is willing to kiss me once again.  Anyway,seriously, this retailler got the tooth brush to us quick and with no problems.  Good pricing compared with other vendors.</li>
    <li> I love this Sonicare, it&#x27;s the second one like it that I have bought, love it to get into the nooks and crannies and get my teeth clean without having to get carpal tunnel syndrome from my old &amp;#34;manual&amp;#34; toothbrush. This one re-charges fast, stays charged for more than a week, (with three people using it), and is durable, (yes, I have dropped once or twice).  The different settings allow me to brush my teeth thoroughly without brushing my gums too hard, causing tooth sensitivity and pain in my gums.</li>
    <li> My husband and I used this toothbrush everyday and it does a great job cleaning our teeth and gums.  However, we have owned a new version of this toothbrush once a year for the last three years and that is my biggest complaint.  We have to purchase a new one every year because the prong that attaches to the heads to the motor either loosens, the motor begins to lose vibration, or there is some weird glitchiness I might be inclined to blame on a malfunctioning battery.  I would love it if this toothbrush was repairable, as in I could crack it open, reseat parts, change parts, or just be able to tinker it back to life.  I don&#x27;t enjoy spending 100 bucks on average for a toothbrush once a year.  I really do expect it to last longer which is why we&#x27;re no longer using the sonicare brand.  After replacing the toothbrush 3 times and having 3 of them die after a years service we were offered the Crest Spinbrush by our dentist to try and I have to say that so far I like it. But that&#x27;s another review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recap:  Toothbrush brushes great but loses 2 stars for cost and lifecycle/longevity.</li>
    <li> I bought this toothbrush one year ago to replace my Sonicare Elite.  Overall I think the toothbrush does a great job.  I mean, let&#x27;s be honest - any electric toothbrush is going to clean your teeth well.  The only differences are the design, the features and the brush head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Design - lighter than my elite, but one SERIOUS issue.  The built-in stand on the bottom that it balances on isn&#x27;t big enough!  So, when you put your toothpaste on the brush and set it down for a second, if you nudge it it rolls right over and \\&quot;pastes\\&quot; your counter.  This happens to us at least once a week and is so irritating&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Features - truthfully, I don&#x27;t use any of them.  The recommendation is for two minutes so that&#x27;s what we do.  I think the features are really a waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Brush head - the toothbrush&#x27;s design with the new heads is the best.  For anybody with an older model using the old screw-on heads, I know you&#x27;ve spent a crazy amount of time cleaning nasty stuff out of the top of your toothbrush where the head screws on.  The new heads are the best and completely eliminate the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m happy we purchased it.  I wish we had one with a sensor that tells you when you&#x27;re brushing too hard since this is an issue for me, and I REALLY wish the stand on the toothbrush was better so it didn&#x27;t tip over.  Very annoying and it seems like it would be so easy to fix!</li>
    <li> Everyone should have a sonicare. There is no other everyday care system for the mouth that compares with this machine. It&#x27;s like having your favorite dentist in the bathroom.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0019ZEVZU Philips Sonicare HX6711/02 HealthyWhite 710 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]][[ASIN:B0019ZEVZU Philips Sonicare HX6711/02 HealthyWhite 710 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]]the main problem for me is the vibration... for anyone who has an issue with  hyper- sensitivity ... this can be a major problem.... no option  for pulsate or a slow down...  makes my tongue  feel awful on every level... too much money . vibrates through my whole head. this is the first of this type and model. never again!</li>
    <li> My teeth feel so much cleaner after using this for only 3 days.  I am a regular brusher, at least twice a day sometimes 3 times, and my teeth usually feel clean with just a regular brush.  But after using this for only 3 days now my teeth feel like I just left the dentist and had a cleaning.</li>
    <li> I have had my toothbrush just over the 2 year warranty period and it simply stopped working. Sonicare told me I must go buy a new one because none of their toothbrushes are repairable. They offered me 15% off the retail price from their store (which is more expensive than Amazon). My previous Oral B toothbrush lasted 10 years, I think I&#x27;ll go back.</li>
    <li> I’ve been very satisfied with my Sonicare Flexcare toothbrush.  It is light, easy to use, and the battery stays charged a long time.  My teeth feel cleaner since I’ve been using the Sonicare.  I would recommend this toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I recommend.  My old one gave out on the head.  I think I was too aggressive with it when popping on the brush head and broke the connector.  But this is a great electric toothbrush.  Get&#x27;s the job done without damage to my gums.</li>
    <li> Dentist told me I should get this it works great.  Cleanings at the dentist are much quicker now great product</li>
    <li> I had one for more than 4 years. Bought this one as gift. Best electric brush. Cleans perfect. Your gum would be healthy in a few months. Your teeth would be clean after the first couple weeks. Your dentist would appreciate you for using this brush. Replace heads every 3 months.</li>
    <li> After 2 years the toothbrush keeps turning on by itself and there is no way to repair it or be replaced since my 2 year warranty is over. Up until that point, it was fine. Just a future heads up for those keeping it long term!</li>
    <li> My first rechargeable toothbrush was the Phillips Sonicare Essence that I kept for 4 years, and I was very impressed with it. When the battery started wearing down and the toothbrush had to stay on the charger till next use, I just decided to upgrade. After reading many reviews, I decided to purchase the FlexCare. I charged it upon arrival, and it lasted 10 days before the battery indicated it was low. Things I&#x27;ve noticed: The Flexcare is very nice, it is powerful, light weight, it has more vibrations and settings such as massage, max care and a few others. It also has a battery indicator instead of just dying when it&#x27;s low. The design of the replacement heads are better than the Essence, excess toothpaste and stuff doesn&#x27;t accumulate under the brush head, it slides on and slides off, and securely fits when attached. The handle has a type of vulcanized rubber on the back for a better grip, compared to the Essence that has a slick plastic finish. The FlexCare feels significantly lighter than the Essence, and leaves your teeth feeling clean and polished, like coming from the dentist. With that being noticed, I have also noticed that the settings such as clean, sensitive, Go Care and Max Care don&#x27;t significantly differ, it seems they are just on a variable timer, the vibration doesn&#x27;t seem to intensify, the settings just allow the cleaning segments to last longer than others. However, the massage feauture does allow the brush to have a different rythmic vibration that feels good on the gums. I like the product, I&#x27;m happy with it, and I would recommend it to someone looking to upgrade or someone just looking for a great toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I tried this toothbrush beginning in January 2012.  I liked it very much.  It cleaned more thororghly than the Braun I had been using.  When it suddenly quit, I ordered a replacement from Amazon.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush works extremely well getting my teeth clean, Charge in unit lasts several weeks even with regular use, I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Both my husband and I have been using this product for eight years.  The initial brushes we bought had begun to lose their charge more rapidly and the mechanism was wobbling somewhat on one.  We decided we liked them more than what has come out since and purchased two new brushes of the same kind.  We find that we consistently get good results and our dentist concurs.  Couldn&#x27;t give any item we own a higher \\&quot;we&#x27;re pleased with it\\&quot; rating!</li>
    <li> The toothbrush itself is good, but the customer service is TERRIBLE.  My brush stopped working after a year and a half, and they just told me to buy a new one--as if I was stupid for not thinking about that in the first place.  The supervisor I spoke with also told me that these toothbrushes are only meant to last for 3 years.  When I buy a toothbrush that costs over $100, I expect it to last longer than that.  I can buy a lot of other electric toothbrushes for that price that will last much longer than 3 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Think carefully about whether you want to invest over $100 into a toothbrush, just to have to spend another $100 in 1.5-3 years.</li>
    <li> I love having the timer every 30 seconds.  I think it does a better job than a manuel toothbrush.  Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> Needed to replace my previous Sonicare, which was great, but was a little surprised to find such a variety of products!&lt;br /&gt;Chose this one because of the rechargeable feature - good for travel,  and nice to not have it on the counter all the time at home. Didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d use the various &amp;#34;modes&amp;#34; much, as I was just looking for a replacement for the toothbrush I&#x27;d liked before that didn&#x27;t have all those features.&lt;br /&gt;I used my previous Sonicare pretty much only in the mornings for a full cleaning, supplementing with a manual toothbrush at other times of day. Have discovered that the easy-to-use &amp;#34;Go-Care&amp;#34; routine does a much better cleaning job than the manual toothbrush, and the process takes about the same length of time! Nice! I&#x27;m also appreciating the seemingly more effective brush head. Very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> Yes, it really works!  However, it is not very easy to set the various operational features on this toothbrush!  One has to refer to the &#x27;user manual&#x27; to see which buttons to push and in what sequence.  There needs to be a simple &#x27;return to basic operational mode button on this one!  That aside, it works very well and lasts a really long time between required chargings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would have been nice if it came with a replacement brush head, though.  The color brush head shows a replacement is needed soon - after two months of use at a lower &#x27;strength&#x27; setting.  Nicely built and comfortable to use.  But, the On-Off switch button is quite sensitive and I&#x27;ve accidently turned it off more than once.......</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for years, and this new one is better.  I like the slim body and small charging stand.</li>
    <li> I have had the unit for 4 1/2 years and it worked great.  Had to toss it though as the brush does not stay on the handle when it vibrates.  This is not something that I can fix and new heads do the same.&lt;br /&gt;I took off a star because for the amount you pay it should not break like this.</li>
    <li> Got this for my husband. He loves it and it&#x27;s still going strong as of today. Favorite type of toothbrush by far!</li>
    <li> Really quick 2 minute brushing and you feel like you left the dentist! I have had this for over a year now using it almost daily in the shower as well and it still works perfectly fine. Highly reccomended.</li>
    <li> This is an expensive toothbrush, and it does a great job. My only complaint is that over time from use all the soft plastic parts will deteriorate eventually breaking the seals and killing the toothbrush. No one likes having something expensive die, especially when it&#x27;s supposed to be &#x27;sealed&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The newer ones have less of this plastic, likely for the reason mentioned above. Also, you really don&#x27;t need all the modes, the newer, cheaper, single mode brushes are way better.</li>
    <li> This is a replacement for my old Sonicare because the battery was not holding a good charge. This one works real well and has a new lithium battery whose charge last much longer. The handle is a little touchy and it is easy to mistakingly change settings.</li>
    <li> I just bought my second one.  The first was purchased Sept 2009. The trick to a long life is do NOT store it on the charger.  ONLY charge rechargables when the battery requires it.  This will extend battery life dramatically.</li>
    <li> My daughter talked me into getting this toothbrush. She gets great reviews with her dentist and only has minimal scraping for cleanings. They never have to use that dreaded water pik for cleanings. When you first use this toothbrush, your whole body feels like it is vibrating. But like the directions say, after a few days you get used to the feeling and it doesn&#x27;t bother you. After using you will have that clean, smooth feeling on your teeth like you do after a professional cleaning. Great product!</li>
    <li> My new Philips Sonicare toothbrush cleans my teeth better than a regular toothbrush.  I would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> At the recommendation of my dental hygienist, I bought this Sonicare toothbrush a year and a half ago.  I find it definitely more effective than a regular toothbrush.  Also easier and maybe quicker to get the job done.  The vibrating head was a little hard to get used to at first, but I adapted soon enough.  This particular model has a lot of settings, but I only ever used two of them (Clean and Sensitive).  So, for me, the other features were wasted.  Next time, I&#x27;ll get a simpler model.  And the next time will be soon, because recently the indicator lights that show which setting the toothbrush is in went out one by one.  The brush still works, but telling which mode it is in has become a problem.  It&#x27;s also begun to jump between settings on its own while in use.  I guess a year and a half is a pretty good run, although for the price I expected it to last longer.  In any case, the Sonicare vibrating toothbrush system is so effective that I will surely get a (simpler) replacement.</li>
    <li> I decided to buy another Sonicare toothbrush in 2011 after using my good old Elite Pro (this one is also awesome cause it is still working and never had a battery replacement in 8 years).  Anyway, the metal head came off while I was brushing.  Called them and they replaced it right away.  It was the fastest call I ever made.  They didn&#x27;t question nor ask me to send them a picture.  They just replaced it and sent me a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend this product to everyone because of its craftsmanship and customer service.  Good Job Philips.</li>
    <li> I resisted this for a while but it is all its cracked up to be and QUIET, love it, great</li>
    <li> After 7 yrs. my Sonicare finally died, I chose to replace with the exact model.&lt;br /&gt;The price was the best I found online and delivered in less than a week.&lt;br /&gt;It was new and unopened.  I&#x27;d recommend this product and merchant to&lt;br /&gt;Family and friends.  It has kept my gums pink and healthy, no more pockets,&lt;br /&gt;My dentist is very impressed as well!</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush.  Works nicely and keeps my teeth and gums happy and healthy.  My dentist always raves about my teeth and gums and applauds me for using this toothbrush.</li>
    <li> This was a replacement for my last one.  Love the toothbrush but it does not last.  Second one in six months but i am willing to pay the price for a great brushing experience.  I can never brush without a sonic but they gotta mkae it last longer.</li>
    <li> This is a replacement unit I bought after the first one was worn out after using it for 5 years. Over time I saw real results: less plague and my receeding gumline came back.&lt;br /&gt;Sonicare is really worth the money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Philips Sonicare Toothbrushs for years and just love the product.  I feel like it does a much better job of taking care of my teeth and gums then brushing with a regular toothbrush.</li>
    <li> For a product this price, I has expected this to work longer. Taken together with the fact that I bought another Philips toothbrush before this one that died after a couple of weeks, this makes me think that Philips quality is not all that great.</li>
    <li> bought this for our daughter and she loves it.  Lives up to its advertising.  We have had these for years and love the perfromance and quality.</li>
    <li> I really like this brush.My husband also uses it and loves it as well. We have had no problems so far,but have not had it long.</li>
    <li> This brush is very easy to use because of the shap and tilt of the neck.  It gets easily into small, back places in the mouth and does an excellent job of cleaning over all.  It is also very portable.</li>
    <li> I have been using Sonicare for years.  When I have dental check ups and&lt;br /&gt;cleanings I always get good comments on how good I do at home keeping&lt;br /&gt;my teeth clean.</li>
    <li> I have bought several of these... myself, girlfriend, brother, mother, gifts... everyone loves this tooth brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Noticing positive results immediately. This is my second Sonicare and really like the smaller head and different modes on this model.</li>
    <li> everything was ok and ir works great my gums are fine now !&lt;br /&gt;thank you  very much for this product</li>
    <li> What a great product!  I&#x27;ve used the Sonicare for years and have great experiences when I have my teeth cleaned!</li>
    <li> I bought this toothbrush recently. I feel it is a value purchase. It take care of the dental care needs and takes your experience one step further to unique. Fast strokes and far reach.  Prior to this Toothbrush I had a Oral B battery-operated brush which was not economical and wasn&#x27;t as a strong a brush as the Flexcare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothbrush has 5 modes of cleaning. I normally use the clean mode which I believe is the fastest and most basic mode. That is what you will need most of the time. The handle grip is remarkably thinner than the Essence model and Oral B old models. I can say one of the thinnest and most comfortable handles in the market. The travel bag is another interesting feature which makes the experience great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe Flex care  comes in two models. The basic model, that I own, does not have a UV cleaner for the brush but I heard that feature is not worth the extra 30-40 dollars you have to pay to get the non-basic model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I totally recommend the product.</li>
    <li> We bought one of these toothbrushes in 2008. (Not from Amazon). The first one went wrong and luckily we got it replaced under warranty. (We kept the receipt). Now that one has gone wrong...just won&#x27;t work, even though all the lights are on and the heads have been cleaned or replaced. I understand there is an internal rechargeable battery that must ware out. If you go on YouTube, there are videos on how to fix it, but it doesn&#x27;t seem that easy. Will probably end up plonking down the cash for a new toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I love the feel of the toothbrush and it&#x27;s hard to go back to a manual one after you&#x27;ve used the electronic one. I like the smaller heads as they make it easier to get around the back teeth. My husband has a lot of gum and pocket issues, so it seems to keep all that in check.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: Paying so much for a toothbrush, I would expect it to last a good 10 years, but I like the result you get from using it. Will probably stick with this brand as we have several spare heads. Heads are expensive to buy.</li>
    <li> I tend to press too hard when I use this brush, because I feel it doesn&#x27;t get between my teeth otherwise.  This increases the wear on the bristles, so I have to change heads more often (and they aren&#x27;t cheap).  Still, it beats the manual method.</li>
    <li> I bought two of these, for both me and my wife for the holidays. For years we both used the cheaper electric toothbrushes from the stores. They never lasted more than a year or so. Compared to those, this toothbrush is awesome. It is super quiet. My old one would wake up my wife sometimes if she was already sleeping. And really does vibrate even though it doesn&#x27;t look like it. I only hope it lasts more than a year.</li>
    <li> Best investment in oral hygiene I ever made.  My dentist and oral hygienist agree.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to matter that much that I have over-extended the life of the brush.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had several Sonicare toothbrushes over many years. In almost every instance in our family of 4 we have had at least 2 break. Sonicare used to replace it using the records they had when you registered the product. This is no longer their policy. Now, you must somehow file all your toothbrush receipts, and reproduce it when you have a broken unit or they tell you to pound sand. I guess they think you might have gone out, cleverly stolen someone else&#x27;s broken tootbrush and now are tyring to take advantage of the 2 year warranty. They have cleverly thwarted a skam consumers are trying to put on the company. Moreover, after reading all the reviews on Sonicare and Oral B at various sites I have concluded that there is not a meaningful difference in performance. With Sonicare you are guaranteed horrible customer service and at least a 25% greater purchase price on the original unit and replacement heads. You make the call but after being a loyal Sonicare customer I have gone to Oral B.</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas present for my mom.  She loves it and is happy to have a Sonicare (her very old one finally bit the dust).  She&#x27;s happy, so I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> This is hands down the best tooth brush i have ever owned hands down.  if you want that fresh from the dentist feeling every time you brush your teeth this is the brush for you.  the various modes and built in timer means that there is no more worrying that you didnt brush your teeth long enough or didnt spend enough time in one area.  it also comes with a convenient little travel pouch.  another thing to note is the battery life of this thing.  i charge it less than once a month which makes it great for travel as it is one less thing to pack (the charger).  i liked this product so much i recommended it to many friends and have even purchased one as a gift. definitely would buy again .</li>
    <li> I can massage my gums and clean my teeth better.  This will prevent gum disease.  I clean at night with the Sonicare, and with a regular toothbrush in the am.</li>
    <li> For those with sensitive gums and teeth the gentle setting is wonderful. It massages while cleans and leaves your mouth feeling as though you&#x27;d just left the hygienist.</li>
    <li> It makes my teeth feel cleaner and they look whiter.  I got good kudos from my dentist on how my teeth look  That&#x27;s a plus .</li>
    <li> But with this item I brush twice a day 2 minutes each time.  I wish I would have bought this sooner.</li>
    <li> My dentist made me buy this, and every time I use it I feel like I had a cleaning at the dentist. Once you use it, even the first time, you&#x27;ll realize how badly you&#x27;ve been brushing your teeth all these years using a manual brush. You&#x27;ll be disgusted with yourself and look at everyone else who doesn&#x27;t use one like they have garbage mouth. Really! I hate brushing my teeth, but using this actually makes it fun. You will WANT to brush your teeth. I have SUPER expensive veneers that cost just under $50k, and this is what I use to take care of them. I hope that&#x27;s enough to convince you.</li>
    <li> The Philips Sonicare FlexCare is easy to use and cleans teeth and gums well.  Was recommended by our dentist and benefits are quickly seen and felt. I was using a regular replaceable battery brush that would not clean as well as needed.</li>
    <li> Updating my review here.  I meant to do this a while ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off phillips replaced both of my handsets so I actual have a spare when one does die.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;second I made a remark to my dentist about how the sonicares kept breaking on me and he actual told me that the newer models have some give in the post to stop people from brushing too hard with them.  If you press too hard you will over time damage this \\&quot;feature\\&quot;.  Apparently you can recede your gum line by pressing too hard with the sonicare and other electronic brushes.  I think phillips could of done a better job explaining why this new design is in place and warn people.  For those of you like me who didnt know about this now you do.  I left my original review below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**********************************&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the sonicare toothbrush line since 1998.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first unit lasted until 2002 when I purchased a elite model because my sonicare original broke (battery still worked but unit wouldn&#x27;t vibrate).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That elite model lasted me until may of 2010.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a flexcare elite with uv sterilizer in may of 2010 it died in April of 2011!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this flexcare in April of 2011 and it died the exact same way today as the last one did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush began to vibrate violently for probably 3 days and then this morning it \\&quot;clicked\\&quot; and lost all power.  I can here it vibrate still but the head gets none of the power.  I now have 2 base units that have died in the exact same way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will call them tomorrow but I find it completely unacceptable that I will now need to buy a new one every year.  Such a successful product with such a successful legacy and they have clearly decided to \\&quot;cheap out\\&quot; just like every other manufacturer on this planet. I hate the race to the bottom and try my best to buy premium items that I would hope last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i will update my review after I talk to phillips and see how they will handle this.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been using these for years and they are the best for keeping your teeth clean. Our dentist office sells them.</li>
    <li> By far this is a good investment in your dental care (besides the regular visits to your favorite dentist). I have owned one ever since they came out and I was never disappointed with the results or the performance of the product, this was purchased as an upgrade, it gives you plenty of options and the best part is the timer that let&#x27;s you know that you have brushed your teeth for the recommended amount of time without having to look at your watch. Easy!</li>
    <li> Going on two years since I got it for Christmas.  I still love it.  The battery life is great.  Expensive, but I feel the value is there.</li>
    <li> My kids love this - and was our 2nd unit in 4 years - the 1st unit broke after 3.5 years - but this one hardly lasted 6 months.  Started making noises and shaft pulled out.  Will not buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE - MARCH 27 2012&lt;br /&gt;Just before throwing it in the garbage - I contacted Sonicare via their web chat service - described what happened.  Within about 5 minutes they had a new one on the way to me as an in-warranty replacement, along with free shipping back of the old one.  So - I feel good about their service recovery and hope the new one holds up longer than the 1st one.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these on my dentist&#x27;s recommendation, and it worked fine...through the warranty period...and then died. The second one made it for 8 months. The replacement Philips sent didn&#x27;t work at all. Clearly the company is having issues with the batteries, given that they won&#x27;t charge or won&#x27;t hold a charge. But of course no one is admitting that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also be aware that a lot of the rebates Philips offers are full of \\&quot;fine print.\\&quot; I&#x27;ve gotten maybe 1 out of 3 of the rebates I&#x27;ve sent in for. In one case, they \\&quot;lost\\&quot; the UPC code I mailed in. I don&#x27;t know whether this is incompetence or  policy, but I&#x27;m now looking for an alternative toothbrush just because I&#x27;m so very, very tired of dealing with Philips&#x27; fumbling bureaucracy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given how much the unit and brush heads cost to buy and how little it costs the company to manufacture them overseas, you&#x27;d think it could get the rest to work. But no. As usual, it&#x27;s cheaper to train people to be courteous than to give them the tools to be effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d have posted this on the Philips website, but (no) surprise: Reviews there are censored. Mine was rejected.</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush, I had an Oral B before I purchased this particular one and it is a lot less noisy. My teeth always feel smooth and clean after I brush with Sonicare. The battery gets me a little over 2 weeks on the short brush setting and I pack it whenever I travel and go camping also. The toothbrush head is small and easy to change and dispose. I liked it so much that I bought a second for a friend.</li>
    <li> Fabulous product. An absolute neccessity for dental care. It takes years to wear one out and when that happens it&#x27;s replacement is new and improved.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my third one. I keep buying the same one because the dentist said my teeth have greatly improved since I started using this brush. Before this brush, I used several other kinds of electric toothbrushes so it wasn&#x27;t because I switched from manual to electric. (I did add GUM Flossers to my routine though.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I discarded the first one because the battery wouldn&#x27;t charge after nearly a year. Philips replaced it for me at no charge because it was within a certain period of time from purchase. The second one also just died after approximately the same amount of time. Also the battery wouldn&#x27;t charge but the manifestation was somewhat different. It&#x27;s unfortunate that I have to keep replacing them but I will continue to do so if my oral health depends on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are wondering why the battery doesn&#x27;t charge, I really don&#x27;t know. With the first one, I was very diligent about wiping it dry before putting it on the battery charger. With both I was very diligent about charging only after it they were on empty. I wish I could advise how to avoid your battery dying but I don&#x27;t know. My husband has the same brush and his second one still works but his second charger died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides the battery life, I have only one other complaint. There is a gap between the brush head and the body of the brush. It&#x27;s supposed to be there according to instructions but I constantly have to wash that area out and sometimes the brush head even falls off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final tip: As with any electronic toothbrush, you should not apply it strongly to your teeth or use it for too long in one sitting. It&#x27;s so easy to do because it&#x27;s so easy to brush that you can lose yourself in a book and brush forever. I developed the equivalent of papercuts in my teeth in the places that I brush the most and hardest so try to avoid that.</li>
    <li> Philips offered a two-year warranty on my unit, which was just as well as the first unit died mysteriously after a year.  They sent a replacement without issue, which started malfunctioning about a year after receipt--a raspy sound from within and the head stopped vibrating.  While they worked they worked very well indeed, but be prepared to replace your unit.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my son for Christmas (a little late) but so far he thinks its great!!  Would recommend to all!</li>
    <li> Love small head on brush and the charge lasts over a week! An excellent buy, was surprised with the travel bag.</li>
    <li> So far so good.  Won&#x27;t take it in the shower this time.  Last time the shower may have killed our previous sonic toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I have owned this tooth brush for years now. Great product. I read so many reviews on toothbrushes before I bought this one. I like that it times your two minutes. It took some time to get used to the vibrations rather than a regular brush but it feels great on the gums. It is a simple design and that&#x27;s why I like it. Nothing fancy like some people want but perfect for me. Brush heads can be expensive but then which ones aren&#x27;t? Good buy.</li>
    <li> My husband and I both use Sonicare Flexcare toothbrushes and are very please with the product. We had no problems when we needed to return one after a year and a half. Arrived in our home in just a few days. The return of the old toothbrush was very easy too. Just put it in the return package and dropped it in a Fedex box outside our post office.</li>
    <li> I bought the FlexCare to replace the [[ASIN:B00008BFXJ Philips Sonicare Elite]] model I bought several years ago. The brush head design of the FlexCare is a major improvement. The old style Sonicare models had a hollow under the head which basically collected grime. The new style has a smaller head with a flush attachment point. Makes it much much easier to clean underneath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel that the Sonicare does a great job cleaning my teeth and was the model my dentist recommended when I asked what would do a better job than a standard brush years ago. My dentist is still recommending this line, so I upgraded to this model when the Elite crapped out on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Admittedly I have not tried other electric toothbrushes, but I can say with confidence that this brush does a much better job than a manual toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Have been using the Sonicare system for last 8 years, and last dental visit showed ZERO plaque .  Even dentist was amazed.  With 3 settings, and 2 program modes, its a great way to save your teeth and gums.  Newer models have more bells and whistles, but for the money, this one is a great starter system.  Heard that Philips used to have lifetime warranty, but now its only 2 years.  Oh well, last tootbrush lasted 5 years, so I can&#x27;t complain.  Would not hesitate to recommend this to anyone asking for a good way of keeping healthy gums and plaque free teeth.  I&#x27;ve tried the Braun system, and I didnt like the rotating head, which caused abrasions on my teeth along the gum line .  Not so with the Sonicare system as the head only moves side-to-side, so on your teeth, its an up-down motion.</li>
    <li> This is a REPLACEMENT for the initial Philips Sonicare FlexCare Rechargeable Sonic Toothbrush which lasted exactly the life of the warranty--2 years to the day.  It is THE BEST toothbrush I have ever owned.  My dental checkups are remarkably better since I began using the FlexCare.  The dual voltage travel charger was a major factor in making the initial purchase.  It is the best travel aid that I have purchased in years.  Others that I have encouraged to purchase the FlexCare are also sold on this toothbrush.  Nice design, versatile, great gift.</li>
    <li> I have purchased 4 Sonicare products over the past 12 years,  these toothbrushes seem to fail quickly now that Philips owns the brand (i.e.  they employ cheaper construction or have engineered for limited lifespan?). Battery charges but mechanical failure so no ultrasonic cleaning action.  It should be possible get more than 54 weeks lifespan from a 120 dollar product.  The original Sonicare (pre Philips) I owned worked for about 6 years!  I won&#x27;t  spend this much again, the cheaper models work as well... Disappointed in what used to be a great dental cleaning product.</li>
    <li> This is the next best thing to a dentist cleaning. It is a wonderful very effective toothbrush. My teeth feel like I just had them cleaned every single time I brush. Highly recommend this product. My dentist says there is a big difference in the plaque on my teeth between visits.....almost none. Love this and will own one for life.</li>
    <li> Awesome toothbrush!  Love that my teeth &amp; gums get a deep clean within two minutes.  Using this has equalled good dental checkups the past few years. Worth the investment.</li>
    <li> This is our third Phillips Sonicare rechargeable toothbrush.  My spouse and I each have our own, which are still going strong after 2 years.  We are so pleased with ours that we wanted to get one for a relative as a gift, having full confidence that it is a great toothbrush.  It leaves our teeth feeling really clean, and we like the different modes and timers.  We know there are cheaper ones available, but having had such a good experience with this brand in the past, we wanted to stick with a tried-and-true product.</li>
    <li> I thought my oral B toothbrush was good but this is amazing! I bought one for my son and plan to get them for the ret of the family.</li>
    <li> You know these are the very best things going. If you want clean white teeth then you have to get one of these. I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare for many years and I&#x27;m sold. This new smaller head is perfect.  I will never buy anything else.</li>
    <li> This was my first ultrasonic toothbrush and it worked really well for me. After cleaning the teeth, you fell that they are so clean that you have a desire to constantly check that cleanliness with your tongue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is also very important, is that I get less tartar to be cleaned by my dentist and my gums almost never bleed while I am cleaning my teeth (which was the case when I used a regular brush).</li>
    <li> I work in a dental office and we recommend Sonicare brushes.  This one is my favorite, but we can&#x27;t get it from our supply reps anymore.  I love the timer and the smaller brush heads.</li>
    <li> They recommended this brand of electric toothbrush.  Because I have sensitive gums, the sensitive and massage setting brush without hurting me.  And, the bristles fade when it&#x27;s time to change the brush.  Great item!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this exact item for yrs..  Dentist recommended.  I love it.  My current one started acting &amp;#34;funny&amp;#34;, so I jumped quick, hopefully being able to replace it with same.  Yeah for Amazon.com, once again you came thru.  It was delivered quickly, no problems.  Based on my Dentist&#x27;s advice to use such, I would recommend this to everyone, however, check with your Dentist 1st, everybody&#x27;s needs are different.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product although as other raters have expressed I don&#x27;t understand why it comes with only one toothbrush head when the packaging clearly indicates that there should be two.</li>
    <li> Travels well but did not care for nylon travel bag.  I prefer the hard case but my husband thinks the nylon case is lighter for traveling.  It is easier to clean.  The unit switch current from 110 to 220 is fantastic</li>
    <li> The best mechanical toothbrush on the market.  Does a great job.  I have tried them all and this one is the winner.  Thanks</li>
    <li> Switched from another major electric tooth brush maker and really liked the sonicare.  Holds a charge well.  Brush is clean and gentle.</li>
    <li> Stopped working right after the warranty ended.  Just buy the cheapest one, works the same and they always stop working after a couple years.  If they made it last forever Philips would probably go out of business.</li>
    <li> I love that I feel like my teeth are brushed for the appropriate amount of time without me having to time it. The only problem with this tooth brush is that this is the 4th one in two years. There are two of us who use this brush with the interchangeable heads but I don&#x27;t know that that is why the motor seems to wear out.</li>
    <li> This was a recommendation from my dentist.  He was absolutely right!  Have had it for about 2 weeks. That&#x27;s all folks.</li>
    <li> Keep my teeth nice and white and easy to use and recharge.  I also like the sanitizing option on my stand.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best, most effective electric toothbrush I have owned. I only wish the rechargeable battery had lasted longer.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is great. The quadrant timer is so useful. My teeth feel substantially cleaner after each use. Expensive, but worth it.</li>
    <li> Next best thing after the dental hygienist.  A plus - it does not need to be charged more than once every two to three weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT PUBLISH MY LAST NAME.</li>
    <li> They do a much better job than a manual tooth brush.  Travel charger is very handy and the toothbrushes run a very long time on one charge.</li>
    <li> I bought this toothbrush after trying water pics and rotary brushes. There is no comparison, this one does a great job of cleaning your teeth.</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush, but mine died after 18 months and I bought a new one.  Also, brush heads need to be replaced every 2-4 months and are not so cheap...</li>
    <li> Once you own a Sonicare, you&#x27;ll never own another electric or manual toothbrush. It&#x27;s that good. It&#x27;s expensive; it&#x27;s worth it, though. Your teeth will thank you.</li>
    <li> Philips has a good reputation or quality products. This toothbrush system incorporates some unique devices. The brushing routines are broken down into three modes; Clean, Sensitive and Massage. The latter will induce a tickling feeling. This device has a \\&quot;quadpacer\\&quot; which times the cleaning of your mouth into four quadrants, which is a nifty feature to make sure you brush long enough. This can also be deactivated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charging stand is a little less sturdy than most but has two other places for brushed. Each brush can also be color coded for family use. Unlike a similar model by Ultreo, the brush heads are smaller. They are also much cheaper, coming in sets of three. The entire unit is approximately $30 less expensive than Ultreo. The overall look is slimmer. The carrying case is flimsy, unlike the hard plastic Ultreo case, but for the value, Philips Sonicare comes out ahead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Quadpacer is a big selling point along with the smaller sized brush heads. You can be sure that you are brushing long enough and more thoroughly with this unit. The variety of brushing modes is also designed for the varied user.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think that this toothbrush would be much different than the less expensive ones you can get over the counter now. Boy was I wrong.&lt;br /&gt;This does an amazing clean job! My teeth, gums and tongue feel cleaner, longer through the day since I&#x27;ve started using it.&lt;br /&gt;Besides the great job it does cleaning, there are a number of good points about it. First, it doesn&#x27;t take up much space, which is a big plus. Second, it is very elegant looking, attractive. It charges in about 4 hours, which really isn&#x27;t too long. A travel case comes with it, which is perfect to take with you instead of traditional toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;The brush end appears to be delicate, but it is actually pretty strong. If you happen to press too hard while  you&#x27;re brushing, it stops. That is a big plus so you don&#x27;t do damage to your teeth or enamel.&lt;br /&gt;The vibrations this thing sends out as it&#x27;s working feel like a wonderful massage to your mouth. I have to say, that&#x27;s my second favorite thing about this. You don&#x27;t get that feeling with the others.&lt;br /&gt;But it&#x27;s the cleaning job that has sold me. I&#x27;ve brushed my teeth at bedtime and woke up with a clean mouth! Amazing.&lt;br /&gt;I strongly recommend this to everyone. It is more expensive, but well worth the investment.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m essentially a lazy person. But after a year in which we spent five figures on dental bills -- gum disease is really awful -- we got religion when it comes to oral hygiene. Yes, I really *do* brush twice a day, floss, and all the things I&#x27;m admonished to do on my quarterly cleanings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We bought the older Sonicare units two or three years ago -- the \\&quot;Elite\\&quot; models. So when Amazon gave me the opportunity to try this new version through the Vine program, I felt that I could do more than say whether this *type* of product is worthwhile. I can give a real-world compare-and-contrast with the less expensive Sonicares.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short: yeah, it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Amazon description gives you the basics of the way these gizmos work. The rechargeable brush vibrates in a way that does a deep cleaning, far more than you&#x27;d accomplish on your own. And the timer forces you to spend the right amount of time brushing. That&#x27;s true of both the Elite model and this FlexCare model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The FlexCare has a few extra features, most of which I appreciate. Primary among them is that it has multiple settings, not just on and off. You can choose a two-minute mode or a one-minute mode; the brush gives you a loud hum and buzz-change to let you know when it&#x27;s time to move to the next tooth quadrant (top outside, bottom outside, etc). The two minute setting includes a few seconds of massage for each quadrant, too, which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush also has a setting for sensitive teeth (which would have mattered back when I still had the gum disease), and a massage-only setting (which is okay, but I haven&#x27;t yet found a use for).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The FlexCare is thinner, which makes it more comfortable for my small hands. The replaceable stem-and-brush is thinner, too, and they plug in rather than screw on. Mostly this is a boon for cleaning the brushes, as our older Sonicares could collect all sorts of goop; we had to unscrew &#x27;em and rinse them out at least a few times per week. This model also charges faster than the Elite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint -- which is minor -- is that the button which you use to change the setting is a little hard to whack. It takes a distinct effort rather than a gentle touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, though, this is a great brush. If you care about your teeth, do get one!e Elite.    My only complaint -- which is minor -- is that the button which you use to change the setting is a little hard to whack. It takes a distinct effort rather than a gentle touch.

    <li> I had always wanted to try an electric toothbrush so was very pleased when this product came available via the Vine program.  I have been using the battery-powered toothbrush for years but didn&#x27;t realize how much more power the electric would have.  I am totally impressed. I like the \\&quot;Smartimer\\&quot; letting me know exactly how much time to spend on brushing, I also like the fact that I don&#x27;t have to spend as much time flossing.  The Phillips Sonicare seems to take much of the excess plaque that I usually had to use floss for, thus really shortening the time I have to spend.  The design of the handle is very comfortable, not as unwieldly as I thought it might be.  I agree with those who have said that the handle does not fit quite as tightly on the charger as I would like making it very easy to tip off, but that is a minor complaint.  The travel case is a nice addition.  Only my next dental visit will tell for sure, but I definitely anticipate good news.  I am totally impressed and recommend this product highly as do most dental professionals.</li>
    <li> I also like many others here had their sonicare toothbrush die after three years and was looking for a replacement.  I have been using the flexcare for a couple weeks and found each of the functions useful, like maxcare and clean.</li>
    <li> For those you of you who are in need of help choosing a sonicare toothbrush your search is over! This is the best electronic toothbrush i&#x27;ve ever used. I have used an older braun oral-B that crapped the bed after only a month of use! Not sure what happened there but that brush was decent. Then came the oral B vitality. What a worthless brush that is. Yes, it&#x27;s cheap but you don&#x27;t get half as many rotations as you would with the older oral-b models. Can&#x27;t forget after a year of use I was lucky if the charge would last a full week without having it sit in the charging cradle. You could also tell as the days went on that it was losing it&#x27;s power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That Being said here are the pro&#x27;s about this toothbrush:  Smaller head then of the past sonicare toothbrushes. The charge definitely lasts more then a week without charge! I would say it would last just about a full 2 weeks without it sitting in the charging cradle. 2- compared to my oral b, i really love the \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; action you get with the toothbrush. I&#x27;ve had stuff stuck in my teeth plenty of times and instead of using floss(which is a better choice) i just use the one minute\\&quot;go care\\&quot; selection and bam, it blasts it away!. 3 you may not find this important, but the battery indicator is a luxury. I didn&#x27;t have this with my past electric toothbrush, and without warning would have a dead toothbrush half way through my brushing!&lt;br /&gt;4 All the different modes. When i say modes i really mean the \\&quot;clean\\&quot; , \\&quot;go care\\&quot; and max care\\&quot; i believe these are the best and most used. The clean mode is for 2 minutes worth of cleaning, go care as i&#x27;ve mentioned above is for a brief 1 minute brushing for in between brushings, and the  max care is my favorite- three minutes  or 2 1/2 minutes of cleaning. 2 minutes of regular cleaning with about a minute extra of messaging.  I can&#x27;t forget the great feeling you get AFTER using this toothbrush. You get that just been cleaned by the dentist feeling- Nice and smooth every time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The extra modes that can be used with the 2 minute \\&quot;clean\\&quot; massage and sensitive setting really aren&#x27;t needed since phillips added the\\&quot;max care\\&quot; that includes the massage with regular cleaning. The sensitive could come in handy but i never use it&lt;br /&gt;2- the toothbrush automatically shuts off! if you aren&#x27;t paying attention you might not have the best teeth cleaning that day. i dont really find this to be a huge problem. If i&#x27;m having one of those days and it just turns of, i just turn it on again and finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3- this toothbrush is a bit pricey! Although i&#x27;m very happy because i chose this toothbrush over an older model due to the fact that this had more features, was the newest out there AND  it was cheaper or about equal to the price of the older model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those looking to buy this toothbrush just take the plunge! To save some money do not buy it with the uv sanitizer. That&#x27;s a major rip off and how much does that really work? When the bulb breaks you have to dispose of it properly due to mercury! so much for going green. Excluding the price, the few \\&quot;extra\\&quot; unnecessary modes, this is worth your money. I have never had such a good cleaning in my life excluding from the dentist.  I love this toothbrush so much i use it at every opportunity.des that can be used with the 2 minute \\&quot;clean\\&quot; massage and sensitive setting really aren&#x27;t needed since phillips added the\\&quot;max care\\&quot; that includes the massage with regular cleaning.

    <li> This is a fantastic product! My hygienist has recommended a Sonicare tooth brush for years and finally I got one. It is so easy to use and you actually get better results in less time, so it&#x27;s very efficient. My problem area is behind my bottom teeth; even with a regular tooth brush I just accepted all the plaque build up all these years! I am 28 now and it&#x27;s time I started taking better care of my teeth and gums. Since I have been using this Sonicare toothbrush with regular flossing and mouth wash, I have noticed that my breath is fresher, even in the morning and for some reason I don&#x27;t get headaches often like I used to, so I give credit to having excellent oral health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a must have for your health and smile!</li>
    <li> This is a great toothbrush.  I bought them for everyone for Christmas.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on lesser brands.  This one is expensive but worth it.</li>
    <li> this is my first automatic toothbrush so i can&#x27;t compare it with another one. i have no complaints about it. it was recommended by my dentist to help me clean my teeth better, especially in the back because i had borderline periodontal diseases and pockets in my gums. i&#x27;ve been using it for a few months (with the compact head on sensitive mode) and in addition to using listerine and flossing, my dentist told me there was dramatic improvement with the health of my gums and teeth. so i think it works. amazon had the cheapest price at the time i bought it (back in august) too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased at least 4 Sonicare brushes, and this one will be the last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While they work well enough out of the box, they are poorly designed -- the mode switch is right where you are sure to press it when you hold the device normally and don&#x27;t mean to -- and they do not last long enough to be worth the money. This one has had the shank where the brushes attach become so loose that the brush no longer transmits any cleaning motion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Calling Sonicare got me an offer of a discount on a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t a well engineered or well made product and the manufacturer doesn&#x27;t care about you.</li>
    <li> First some background.  We, my wife an I, have used Sonicare for many years.  Our dentists have given both of us excellent reports on our dental hygiene.  This is to say that the Sonicare toothbrush does an excellent job of cleaning teeth and gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As mentioned, we&#x27;ve been using the Philips Sonicare for many years.  Several months ago, we went on a vacation in Europe.  Most European countries use a different electrical system than we use in the United States.  More specifically, Europe uses 240-volts for their electrical outlets.  In the Unites States, we use 120 volts.  So, our existing Sonicare toothbrushes (designed for the Unites States) wouldn&#x27;t work in Europe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We purchase these new Sonicare toothbrushes (those that are the subject of this review) specifically to use for our trip to Europe.  We&#x27;re pleased to say that these toothbrushes worked very well in Europe.  Essentially, they worked the same as our U.S. toothbrushes worked in the U.S.  When we returned to the U.S., we discovered that they work equally well on U.S.  That is, they work very well on both U.S.  voltage (120 volts) and European voltage (240 volts).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, the big advantage of these toothbrushes, besides their excellent tooth-cleaning ability, is that they will work in most countries of the world.  If you&#x27;re traveling, or even it you&#x27;re not, these are excellent toothbrushes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in the process of getting my second warranty replacement. This is only within a 6 month period. The toothbrush works great for cleaning your teeth, like nothing else. However, the toothbrush will start to occasionally make a bad vibrating noise on the inside like something is coming loose or breaking. Then it just gets worse and worse. Eventually it starts to loose its brushing effectiveness. Both brushes that I have had have done the same thing. The first did it within the second month. The second lasted a little bit longer, but only by a few months. Unacceptable for the price of the unit. We&#x27;ll see what happens with the third brush. If it fails I will be changing to a different product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** I&#x27;ve now had this third brush for a while now and it seems pretty goo. The first 2 I had were problematic. Maybe just bad luck. This one works well and I&#x27;m happy with it. ***</li>
    <li> It runs and cleans teeth beautifully. I do like it and think it does and extraordinaire job. However. there is a very thin covering of the front where all the on/off. lights, programming is. The thin slippery covering is about half off,,,,I do not know what function this cover performs.  I don&#x27;t this one is doing it&#x27;s job. I hope that it does not leak.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is a vast improvement over the Philips e-series I used to use.  For people like me who have gum disease, it offers a special setting for massaging the gums--either as part of your regular brushing or as a different cycle.  Very useful.  Unlike the e-series (Elite, Essence), this brush comes as one solid piece, so there&#x27;s no nasty mold building up in the handle.  I like this one so much that I got another one for my spouse.</li>
    <li> I have owned a Sonicare toothbrush for many years, and would never go back to a manual toothbrush.  There is nothing better for cleaning and brightening your teeth and preventing tartar from forming.</li>
    <li> After radiation treatments on my jaw, my dentist insisted I get this toothbrush.  Expensive, maybe, but worth it, she said.  She was right.  I appreciate the little beeper reminders to change areas (my mind tends to wander), and the beep when the battery is getting low.  I just had my first check-up after my purchase, and 3 of my tooth gum numbers had improved from the previous time!  Also, I usually come home from the dentist feeling my teeth with my tongue because it feels so clean, but noticed there wasn&#x27;t a bit of difference in my &#x27;tongue feel&#x27; this time.  Can you beat that?</li>
    <li> My first Philips Sonicare - love it, love it, love it!!!I was skeptical about all the hype but after using it, I realize it lives up to it all!Great options, very effective (leaves that nice clean feeling after going to the dentist&#x27;s) - Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Amazing.  After the first use my teeth felt as clean as if I had just gone to the dentist.  I have since bought these for everyone in my family.  I have convinced several friends and colleagues to purchase them also.  I won&#x27;t ever go back to my old toothbrush.  Maybe I should be a sonicare flexcare salesperson.  Lol</li>
    <li> The one positive: After owning several Sonicares over the last 20 years, starting with the very first model -- before Philips bought the original company -- I bought the new FlexCare mainly because the older models had a tendency to collect black mold under the brush head casing. My old Sonicare worked fine, but the mold issue was important to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new models have corrected this issue with a more waterproof seal between the brush head and the wand -- the brush head simply pops on and off on a pin that sticks up from the base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose the FlexCare chiefly because I missed a feature that was on my very first Sonicare -- a gentle speed in addition to the regular speed. The Flexcare choices seemed to offer that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The many negatives: However, the FlexCare has a frustrating design flaw in that the Mode choice button is directly below the On/Off button. And although the product instructions in the box say specifically that you must make your mode choice before turning the toothbrush on -- that you can&#x27;t change modes while brushing -- the exact opposite is the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Mode button is just where it&#x27;s natural to hold the toothbrush while brushing, and every single time I&#x27;ve used the FlexCare, it keeps changing modes in the middle of brushing because part of my thumb touches the Mode button even when I consciously try to keep my thumb on the On/Off button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I see no difference between Clean (the choice at the top of the totem pole) and Sensitive (the next choice down). And Massage, which I thought would be another gentle choice for massaging the gums, is rough and hard -- like going over a bumpy road -- not soothing at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I&#x27;d asked my dentist which of the new Sonicare choices I should get, he said to get the simplest one -- and I highly regret that I didn&#x27;t follow his advice. I am so frustrated with the FlexCare that I&#x27;m ready to throw it out after a few months&#x27; struggle with it and to buy a new Sonicare EasyCare at about half the cost of the FlexCare. (The EasyCare also has the new, slimmer pop-off brush head design that circumvents the old mold issue.)onicare EasyCare at about half the cost of the FlexCare. (The EasyCare also has the new, slimmer pop-off brush head design that circumvents the old mold issue.)</li>
    <li> I want to congratulate folks at Phillips/Sonicare on hiring the most talented engineers money can buy. With a precision of a swiss time piece they manage to estimate the life cycle of the battery to die right after the warranty expires. When I say “right after” I truly mean it. So you are stuck with a great piece of hardware that you have to throw it away because the batteries are non-replacable.&lt;br /&gt;This is my 3rd (and last) toothbrush from them. In anger I had purchased Oral-B 7000 and could not be happier.&lt;br /&gt;Sonicare vs Oral B&lt;br /&gt;Sonicare handle feel more ergonomic than Oral-B&lt;br /&gt;Sonicare vibrations feel more intense, Oral-B feels more mechanical&lt;br /&gt;Sonicare  non replaceable battery (deal breaker for me at this point) Oral-B removable battery&lt;br /&gt;Oral-B separate display showing your brush time, warns you if you are pressing too hard. In addition, it has a nice LED light on the toothbrush itself showing you if you press too hard.&lt;br /&gt;Sonicare- I always hated the crud one had to clean between the head and the unit. In addition if you are not religious enough about it, you will start getting mildew right under the rubber seal on the bottom of the handle. None of those issues are possible with Oral-B.&lt;br /&gt;My overall feeling is Oral-B is more of a no nonsense get the job done type of toothbrush. While Sonicare is still riding on its ultra high rpm technology making you feel like your teeth are cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line- both are great toothbrushes, but unless you are ok shelling our $150 every 2-3 years, Oral-B is a better buy.&lt;br /&gt;Last but not least- Your experience may vary, but my teeth are cleaner with Oral-B. Not sure if a smaller head does a better job or it’s the technology itself, but I have definitely less plaque.</li>
    <li> Fantastic toothbrush. Best thing about it is the lithium ion battery. Means it lasts a month between charges and every time you brush its 100% power.</li>
    <li> Dentist recommended. Have had this for 2 years with no issues. I live the timer for each quadrant of my mouth. A great product to help minimize gum disease and encourage healthy gums and teeth.</li>
    <li> First one worked around 6 months second one worked only a month. I am so disappointed. Too expensive for this quality. I am so mad at my husband, after the first one was last only 6 months he still bought the second one. There are many better brands out there and also cheaper. Why did my husband pick this brand?</li>
    <li> This is the second one I purchased in the past few years and both died in less than 2 years and the company refuses to replace.  Save your money and go with another brand that will last longer.</li>
    <li> This was a replacement for the one that died. No problem with this item. I would purchase it again when the new item dies in about 5 years.</li>
    <li> This is my first ever rechargeable toothbrush.  I love how my mouth feels after brushing.  It holds the charge well, and is great for travel (comes with a travel pouch).  But it has all sorts of buttons - none of which I ever use.  I think on/off + speeds would be sufficient.  Also, I&#x27;m not sure this is the case with all of these types of toothbrushes, but you need to be real careful to remove the brush head and clean where it attaches, at it can get &amp;#34;moldy&amp;#34; fast.  That seal doesn&#x27;t seem to work so well...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the brush, but I think there are cheaper options that would fit my needs.</li>
    <li> I had used a Sonicare toothbrush for years, and then switched to a different type of brush, and used that one for a few years, but now decided to go back to Sonicare again. This toothbrush is an upgrade from the one I used before, and it&#x27;s a nice one. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a month now, and I&#x27;m starting to see some results. I have stains on some teeth, especially, around veneers, and they are getting lighter now. I also like the feature of having different options: for sensitive teeth, gum massage, quick one minute brushing, etc. My only issue is with the design of the &#x27;option button&#x27;, it&#x27;s too easy to accidentally hit it while you&#x27;re brushing, and it switches to a different program without your intending to do so, which I&#x27;ve done a number of times now. I just became more aware of this, and always try to be careful not to touch it. Otherwise, this is an excellent product, and I&#x27;m glad that I got it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Soniccare for a few year&#x27;s following dentist recommendations.  Has always worked well, multiple modes, and it does a better job than I could using a normal toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush and reasonably priced. I&#x27;ve had Sonicare brushes before and found them reliable. Unfortunately sometimes I walk around while brushing and dropped the previous one and bent the shaft.</li>
    <li> This is the second Phillips Sonicare we have owned. The first one suffered a sudden demise when it was only 2 years old, nit we decided to give the product another chance. Hope that this one lasts longer. It works well, my teeth feel clean and polished and it hasn&#x27;t irritated my gums with its scrubbing action. If it proves sturdy, it is a very nice, if pricy product.</li>
    <li> great for keeping gums and teeth healthy</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and every once in a long time it needs to be replaced, and I will never replace it with anything else.  My cleanings at the dentist are a breeze thanks to this procduct.  Use this evyerday, twice a day and floss and you will have beautiful healthy white teeth.</li>
    <li> This is the third Philips electric brush I have owned.  My oral health and cleanliness of my mouth is due in full to this amazing cleaning machine.  It is a bit pricy,but in the long term , worth it as I have had no cavities or gum disease in over 10 years.The average machine lasts about 3 years.  My dentist is awed that I only need a cleaning once a year and that is minimal.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Purchased this toothbrush as a gift and within 6 months of use it had to be shipped back to the company because it stopped working. The brush has once again stopped working and the company offers a 2 year warranty on the original purchase product only...not the replacement. So after not even 2 years the brush is junk and Philips will not stand behind their product...the best they could do is offer 15% off my next purchase. No thanks Philips!!!</li>
    <li> I got this cause my dentist recommended it.  I had a battery powered Sunbeam cheapo. Up &amp; down motion. No, didn&#x27;t do the trick.  The Phillips pulses-vibrates at an incredible high speed.  Nice brush. Well made.  Had it over 2 years now. Fine!</li>
    <li> BUYER BEWARE...I have this toothbrush, and loved it up until the day it started malfunctioning.  It comes on in the middle of the night, and sometimes won&#x27;t stop...runs until the battery is out.  Other times it will pulse on and off continuously.  It either runs or pulses until the batter runs completely down.  I called Philips, and they&#x27;re willing to replace it if I have a receipt.  But, I can&#x27;t find the receipt, so I guess I&#x27;m out of luck.  In reading other comments on the internet, it&#x27;s a common problem with Sonicare toothbrushes.  So, even though I don&#x27;t have the receipt, I would think Philips would make good on it given that they&#x27;re fully aware of the problem.  I may by a Braun Oral B, but I&#x27;ll not buy another Sonicare. If you buy one, make damn sure you keep the receipt, because from what I&#x27;ve been reading, it will have problems.</li>
    <li> This is the finest rechargeable toothbrush I have ever had.  It has many different options.  My teeth feel like they were just cleaned at the dental office.</li>
    <li> My dentist gave me a terrible report on my gums and teeth last visit.  She suggested that I purchase the Phillips Sonicare Flex Care Toothbrush to try to correct my problem.  This visit she was impressed the results.  100% difference.  I would recommend this product&lt;br /&gt;to everyone.</li>
    <li> Great! This is a good item and it will be use for a long time to come.  I like it.</li>
    <li> goog tool to keep hard to reach area clean, even by using once a day tartar built up prior to using this brush is gone after 12 days!</li>
    <li> I bought 2of these for my family after I bought one at an auction. Infer learning how to brush without tickling myself silly, I don&#x27;t know how I lived without this. All of our teeth are amazingly clean and they feel terrific.</li>
    <li> I went on vacation and forgot my sonicare brush.my teeth didn&#x27;t feel clean all week with a regular brush.as soon as I got home I brushed with the sonicare,and felt so much better.I won&#x27;t forget it again</li>
    <li> My teeth feel so clean and refreshed after brushing. After using it for a month or so, I made a visit to my (2) dentists and they were amazed at how much better my teeth and gums were. They were surprisingly improved.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great toothbrush and I&#x27;m hoping it lasts just as long as the the first one did, over 3 years.</li>
    <li> I loved this toothbrush and it worked great, but it always fails completely after a certain amount of use. I&#x27;ve had this toothbrush replaced 3 times, and it just failed again for a 4th time (out of warranty, unfortunately). Each time, the device failed in the same way: the vibration would slowly dampen until the toothbrush made no movement at all. Each time, it seemed something was mechanically wrong. The toothbrush would be fully charged and make an electric noise, but no movement. Perhaps I brushed too hard! When you pay big bucks for an electric toothbrush, you hope it&#x27;ll last you for years to come--so I wouldn&#x27;t advise purchasing this one.</li>
    <li> This cost about $130 new. Now I see that it is less, but the warranty is for two years and mine broke pretty much exactly after two years. This means you will pay $50-$65 a year for a toothbrush. It did a good job while it worked, but I am disappointed that mine suddenly stopped working without any real cause.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush did a good job cleaning - much better than a manual toothbrush - but it stopped working after 2 years.  For over a hundred dollars, this is very disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just bought an Oral-B... we&#x27;ll see how it goes.</li>
    <li> Ive used a sonacare for years. I like this new flex-care, the massage mode is good for my gums and it switches to that mode at the end of each segment for a few seconds. The button on the handle is easily pressed which will switch mode so you&#x27;ll need to learn how to hold it....and that takes some getting used to.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m merely echoing other reviewers&#x27; remarks that this seems to be a well-designed and well-constructed product, but I&#x27;m astonished that a premium electric toothbrush like this would be shipped with only one brush head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update, after several months&#x27; use: The brush has an annoying design defect--the brushing mode is too easily reset inadvertently, and you can&#x27;t tell which mode is selected except by cycling through all of the five modes so as to light the indicator LED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2: First off, Sonicare--to their credit--has eliminated the design defect I criticized directly above. My original toothbrush suffered brain death after just 7 months of use. Again, to their very great credit, Sonicare had a replacement brush on my doorstop almost before I reported the problem. It&#x27;s this replacement brush (as of 1/15/13) that&#x27;s been nicely redesigned: you can no longer inadvertently reset the brushing mode while you&#x27;re brushing your teeth. It can, however, be conveniently reset when the brush is turned off. Clever design thereby eliminating an annoying quirk. And I&#x27;m still wowed by the courtesy and efficiency of the 1-800 people I talked with.</li>
    <li> This was a replacement purchase for a Flexcare that broke.  The controls are somewhat different and not as intuitive as my previous model but OK after I got used to it.  Package only contains a single brush even though there are spaces for 2 in the packaging.</li>
    <li> This worked great up till now.. no reason it just stopped. i thought perhaps it was the battery and called philips to find out that the warranty is 2yrs... however!! they have a grace period of 6 months and are sending me a new toothbrush base!!! Now that is good customer service.. i don&#x27;t have it yet but should get it within 10 biz days.. if i don&#x27;t update this, then that means we are a ok!</li>
    <li> If you haven&#x27;t used an ultrasonic toothbrush, you should.  After using the sonicare, using a regular brush feels gross.&lt;br /&gt;Tickles a bit at first but after the 2nd day you will be used to it. Cleans like no other!&lt;br /&gt;You probably do not need all of the features of the more expensive sonicare brushes, though. I have only used Clean mode which is what all of them come with.&lt;br /&gt;Be aware, their money is made on the replacement brush heads, which will add up.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great product!</li>
    <li> This was a replacement for an older Phillips Sonic model that had served me well for many years.  The ability of old battery to hold a charge had been waning and was down to less than 2 minutes.  I ordered this model to replace it.  The Lithium-ion battery in this new model is a more powerful technology.  The toothbrush itself has a few new features and it works very well.  It takes up less space and seems to have greater vigor in cleaning my teeth.  I am very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> Got this in October 2012, is broke towards the end of 2013, I got a replacement from Philips and now that has broken a little over one year later. I like how it performs but it is obviously made with cheap components which make it unreliable, its hard to justify the cost for such poor reliability...</li>
    <li> Bought this in October of 2009. It works great, definitely better than what my hand can do. Sadly it stopped working today. For some reason water got into the circuit board and damaged it. Now I have to order another one... or give Oral-B a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Either this is bad luck or it might be the product itself, but my other 2 Sonicare failed to charge/stopped working 2 months later after this unit failed! I bought one on Amazon and got 2 from the Costco bundle. Overall 3 out of 3 sonicare toothbrush failed 2 1/2 years later. All experienced the same problem of being unable to charge. When the toothbrush is placed on the charger it just vibrate every few seconds. It no longer turns on and will not take a charge. Ticking time bomb???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I eventually bought an Oral-B and felt that it cleaned my teeth better than the Sonicare did. I&#x27;ll be sticking with Oral-B from now on. I really like the circular motion of the head better than the back and forth stroke from Sonicare. However one trade off is that the it is noisier and uglier than sonicare toothbrushes.</li>
    <li> My electric toothbrush and my flosser  have eliminated dental bills except for - alas - the ones associate with the problems of aging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have crowns older than most people!</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended that I purchase the Philips Sonicare toothbrush. I hestiated because of the price but now that I have the toothbrush, I am really impressed with how well it cleans my teeth.</li>
    <li> Comparative shopping results, this same product at Walmart saved 120.00! I&#x27;ve owned this same brush for several years and was shocked at the prices in retail stores</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had several of these over the past few years.  At first they work great.  Then they loose power and give a weak clean.  Replacement brushes are rediculously high cost, over $10 each and they are not better made than the typical $3 toothbrush.  The newest set of genuine Phillips brushes I bought don&#x27;t fit the handle well.  They&#x27;re hard to put on and hard to remove. The most recent handle I bought failed in a few months but they did replace it after I paid to send it back.  They sent the wrong model, however.  They sent me a cheaper model.  I gave up and accepted it.&lt;br /&gt;I was going to buy another as my current model is dying but I noticed under country of origin it says: \\&quot;USA or Imported\\&quot;. I read this as \\&quot;made in China\\&quot;.  I&#x27;m going to buy the Braun.  At least I know that&#x27;s made in China.</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush, every time I use it, I feel like I just stepped out of the dentist office! It&#x27;s awesome and definitely worth the price!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Philips for over 9 years.  I read reviews about one of the other models not have the button where you can select what mode you want before you power on.  I did not like the fact I had to replace my last one in two years, but since I like the feel and design of the Philips, I purchased another on.  I hope this one last a little longer.</li>
    <li> It was my second sonicare , started to turn on by itself after one year, I was abroad so could not exchange it. Bought another one - diamond care - AGAIN after one year the same situation, addressed the issue to Phillips , customer service promised to send a replacement.</li>
    <li> I needed an electric toothbrush that I can use overseas with 220 volts and this is just the ticket.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Excellent and durable brush. Heads need changing every 2-3 months. Reminder to use less pressure than normal toothbrush or gum recession / sensitivity can happen.</li>
    <li> I bought this a little over a year ago when our Sonicare died after almost 5 years of use (both my husband and I use it). This one just died at a year and 20 days old. Sadly for me, it&#x27;s 20 days over the return policy date. We LOVE this brush. The dentist and hygienist always complement me for flossing so well when I visit them every six months (I don&#x27;t floss at all). I&#x27;ll spend another $100 on it because it&#x27;s worth it but if it dies again in a year then I&#x27;ll have to look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I purchased mine in December of 2012. It lasted about a year and a half of very normal use. Well, my toothbrush began turning on all by itself and was difficult to turn off again. This continued for a week, where I would wake up at night, hearing it running in the bathroom. I had to get up, turn it off, only to wake up an hour later with it running again! I eventually had to sleep with my toothbrush, so when it turned itself on, I could quickly turn it off at bedside, without having to get back up and walk to the bathroom. Maybe it had something to do with all the ghost reality shows I had been watching on TV, but eventually it died (thankfully!). And at the expensive price paid, that Philips included ONLY one brush head is just plain greedy. Come on guys! And further, I never even knew what program I was using. My finger often touched the touch sensitive little silver button while brushing which then changed the mode, so I rarely knew what mode I was in and really did not care to take time to figure it out. I do think it did a great job of brushing, which was why I bought it, along with the knowledge that my last Philips electric toothbrush lasted a very long time. Not so this model, which has now ended my relationship with Philips, given the price paid. I deducted 1.5 stars for product longevity and for waking me up at night; 1 star for poor implementation of the programs, which are basically useless IMHO; and a half star for only including one brush head given the high price of this toothbrush. I would recommend Oral B and tests of equivalent models I&#x27;ve seen have shown Oral B to out clean the Philips. And hopefully, you will be able to sleep at night!</li>
    <li> Overall it&#x27;s been a good toothbrush.  First full charge lasted for a little over a month.  No complaints at this point.</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush so much that I bought two of them. It is OK, I had the other one for over three years before it went out, but that is about $50 per year for just the toothbrush, not even the heads. I feel like this model has a rubber backing that may not be the sturdiest. I&#x27;ve had my second one for about 2 years and it is doing the same thing - the rubber balls up like I am doing some vigorous brushing. Trust me, although I do brush for the full two minutes twice a day, I am not doing anything out of the ordinary. I think for my third Sonicare, I may check out a different model. I will never use another type of brush again as my checkups at the dentist have been an A+ since using Sonicare. Get one today if you are not using one! I converted my husband and my parents... we are believers, now just give us the kool-aid.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush was my first foray into the Sonicare line and I must say I love it and I&#x27;m very impressed.  I used to use my simple Spin Brush.  I&#x27;m so glad I upgraded to a permanent fancy toothbrush.  I haven&#x27;t even had a chance to use all of it&#x27;s capabilities but I have no complaints so far.  My teeth are clean and sparkly, and the vibrations are intense so you know you&#x27;re getting a great deep cleaning of your teeth.  Of course it&#x27;s a bit pricey but I think you get what you pay for.  I caught this one sale for about $94 so it wasn&#x27;t too bad at the time.</li>
    <li> I have been a Sonicare user since 2004.  I have gone through 2 models in that time span.  This is my third purchase; my last purchase, in 2009, just died on me.  I am re-purchasing the FlexCare Model for several reasons.  It is a great toothbrush,  I have all of the other accessories (travel charger, UV toothbrush head cleaner).  My husband still uses this model for his toothbrush (we got ours originally as a two pack at Costco).  I saw no real reason to switch to the DiamondClean model (and my dentist agreed).  This model provides all that you need in an electronic toothbrush and comes at a significant discount to the DiamondClean model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to my dentist, the real breakthrough with the DiamondClean was the new brush head ([[ASIN:B0086VIA3O Philips Sonicare HX6063/64 Diamond Clean Replacement Brush Heads, Standard, 3 Pack]]), which are compatible with the FlexCare brush.  My dental hygeine routine includes flossing nightly with floss picks([[ASIN:B00763M03O Oral-B Complete Floss Picks Mint 90 Count]]), brushing with the Sonicare FlexCare and Sensodyne Isoactive Toothpaste([[ASIN:B002BT27OA Sensodyne Iso-Active Multi-Action Toothpaste for Sensitive Teeth &amp; Cavity Protection-4.3 oz]]), rinsing with Listerine ([[ASIN:B0014CXT6K Cool Mint Listerine Antiseptic Mouthwash (2 X 1.5lt)]]), and an application of GC MI Paste (not available on Amazon at the time of this review, google this product).  I get a gold star at each of my dental check ups!  Sonicare FlexCare plays a big role in this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for taking the time to read my review, and I hope you found it helpful in making a purchase decision.</li>
    <li> Works great, so impressed with my a couple of weeks later ordered on for my wife, she loves hers as well.</li>
    <li> We love our Sonicare brushes and brush tips. I wish the brush heads lasted longer before they suggest to replace them, but I would recommend this brush over any other as its powerful.</li>
    <li> This is a great one!  One of my favorite features is that it shows when it needs to be recharged.  It is slim and you can travel with it conveniently.</li>
    <li> Use the long narrow heads, helps get around those back teeth. Will improve gum health. Works much better than the old model I had that lasted for years until I couldn&#x27;t get the heads. I wouldn&#x27;t be without it. Haven&#x27;t had a cavity since I started using Sonic years ago. Don&#x27;t cheat run the full length of the timer</li>
    <li> I requested to have the existing unit which was just 2 years old replace with a new unit, as the old unit was vibrating to such an extent we could not hold it in our hands. We have used the electronic toothbrush with excellent success, but it seems that early breakdown, and obsolescence is a very strong factor in  your manufacturing this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marty Kaplan</li>
    <li> I like the different settings the brush has.  I wish the brush bristles were softer.  It gets the job done</li>
    <li> I fell like this is a very good product.  And they were at a good price.  I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> No problems after over a year!</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research before I chose this particular model.  Why is it unique you ask.  Because it has modes that the others do not, so that I can brush my teeth &amp; GUMS in one mode and interval.  I personally think this has made a huge difference in my dental checkups since I have not had any issues or problems since I started using this toothbrush!</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd one. The first last over 15 years? Can&#x27;t really remember. However, it finally began to die and I replaced it with this newer model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel they have improved the overall device plus the brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I have is that I sometimes accidentally hit the button while I&#x27;m brushing and end up changing the program in mid brush. Only a mild complaint.</li>
    <li> luv it. Works great, does everything advertised. You get what you pay for perfect. nothing more to say very happy w/ purchase.</li>
    <li> Glad I listened to my dentist because my teeth are much cleaner with this sonicare than they were with my old manual or crest spinbrush.  Very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Just got my sonicare and used it for the first time and wow...felt wonderful! I think I will love using this.  The massage setting  is a nice feature. I think I will be brushing my teeth a lot longer! lol</li>
    <li> This is the absolute best toothbrush.  Took it on a two week vacation and it never need charging - used twice a day or two minutes each time.</li>
    <li> I think the toothbrush is great.  I like that it has a one minute and two minute brush settings and also the easy mode.  My disappointment is that when the battery wears out then you must throw it away.  It would be nice to be able to replace the battery.  It does a great job of brushing without hurting your gums.  Make sure NOT to keep it plugged in all the time.</li>
    <li> Have used the Original Sonicare 15 yrs ago but this one is the BEST.  No bells and whistles.  A must if you like electric brushes.</li>
    <li> Finally replaced old Crest electric toothbrush with this excellent rechargeable unit.  Works better than I had hoped--holds a charge for over a week with 2 and sometimes 3 brushings a day.  I leave the charger in the drawer and bring it out when I need.  Love the Sonicare experience, including the 2-minute timer, and I feel like I&#x27;m getting a good brush.</li>
    <li> I love the different settings - my sensitive gums have responded well to the massage setting, which is gentle and really pleasant. Super cleaning power means my dentists visits are more pleasant as well. :)</li>
    <li> I had used a mechanical toothbrush of a leading competing brand for years. Dentist told me to get this because my gums were wearing away, and I like it a LOT better than my old mechanical toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;Brushing twice a day it goes for at least 2 weeks without charging.</li>
    <li> My older Sonicare Flexcare toothbrush died after 2 years of use.  My original one also had the UV light but I don&#x27;t know if it was a gimmick or if it really worked but I really didn&#x27;t use that feature.  Once it died, I wanted to find a replacement, and this one was pretty pricey, but not as pricey as the one that that had the UV light.  This works fine, and after using it, my teeth definitely feels cleaner.  As the product says, there are couple of modes you can use. I just use the regular mode, where it turns off after 2 mins of use, which is I guess the time you should spend brushing your teeth.  If you finish before it turns off, that means you aren&#x27;t spending enough time brushing. The other mode is the gum massaging feature which I don&#x27;t use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Replacing the head is easy but kind of tough, meaning you need to pull the head off, so if you&#x27;re not that strong, or you have a broken wrist, it might be a challenge for you.  This set also comes with a little pouch for when you travel but you need to take the brush head off first in order for it to fit.  If this one breaks down, I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> She love the Sonicare.  I do not like being told how many words to write, that&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t do reviews often</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  My teeth feel clean and fresh for many hours after brushing.  It is a little intense at first, but you get used to it, especially knowing how great your teeth will be when done.  We only have one shot with our teeth and this product will help make sure they stay clean.  The timer is a great feature as it keeps those with ADHD focused enough to stay on track for the allotted time.  There is a quick mode that is a nice addition.  Holds charge for a long time.  Came with a nice carry/travel bag.  Well worth every penny spent.  Highly recommended.  This was my first rechargeable toothbrush and will be the only one I use from here on out.</li>
    <li> this toothbrush lasts very long and it is very reliable. i like phillips toothbrush better than the braun electric toothbrush</li>
    <li> Got this as a replacement for the same model that I&#x27;ve used for several years.  My dentist says that my gums have been in much better shape since I&#x27;ve started using it.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ll I must say,  this badboy really gets my chomppers clean!!!!  I go down on many a whisker biscuit and nothing makes my teeth as sparkling fresh as this unit do.  It even knocks out any renegade pubes that happen to be lodged in there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving the fur burger is best.  IT Rules!!!!</li>
    <li> This toothbrush was decided upon because of previous reviews indicating it didn&#x27;t get moldy down the middle of the toothbrush.  Previous Philips brushes used had this problem so Philips replaced one with the Flexcare.  While the Flexcare didn&#x27;t get moldy, it broke after 9 months of use.  The metal spindle (the thing that the toothbrush is pushed down on) came loose and will not hold a toothbrush any longer.  Philips customer service apologized for this problem but said since it was already a replacement for a moldy brush previously purchased, there could not be a warranty replacement.  It seems a product, regardless of how it was received, should last longer than 9 months.  How disappointing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a few different of the Sonicare toothbrushes, and they&#x27;ve all worked about the same.  This one is no different, good value for what you get.</li>
    <li> my dental exams since using this item have really improved. seems to remove placque and improve gum health. dentist agrees</li>
    <li> These things never die. This model is nice and slim and light.  Get the replacement heads cheap at Costco, and you&#x27;ll have a product that will last you forever.  A full charge lasts about 2-3 weeks.  Solid product.  I will keep buying Sonicare products.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush worked OK, but broke down 10 months after purchase (bought in Apr 2012, stopped working in Feb 2013.  That&#x27;s unacceptable to me.</li>
    <li> I love this tooth brush, as much as you can love an object. I can&#x27;t live without this tooth brush.</li>
    <li> Definitely disappointed with this toothbrush model.  I had other Philips Sonicare toothbrushes and they lasted three years and longer, but this one apparently was not of the same quality.</li>
    <li> I have this tooth brush for two weeks and love  that it lets you know when your two min: brushing is done. and my teeth just feels clean. I would recomend.</li>
    <li> I purchased this Sonicare to replace an older model Sonicare that I had. I like that the handle is a lot thinner and easier to hold. I like having different brushing options, my older Sonicare only had one. The Sonicare cleans very well, I may have something set wrong since I feel the new Sonicare isn&#x27;t as \\&quot;strong\\&quot; as the old one. I just started using it and thought I had followed the directions to deactivate the Easy Start feature but will need to go through it again. I have used the Sonicare brand toothbrush for years and have gotten go results with it and a great clean feeling. Good dental checkups too. All the Sonicares are pricey but they are well worth the money for the results you get.</li>
    <li> I like it as a replacement for a sonicare previously owned. It&#x27;s slimmer design and easier clean and replacement head is an improvement.</li>
    <li> I love this product because it is not awkward from the previous Sonicare I had.  It is very light to use, though I wonder how affective it is with such a small brush head.  It takes a bit to getting use to compared to the regular tooth brush, but the product is great to have, especially since it is recommended by my dentist and the Fone School of Dental Hygienists in Bridgeport, CT.</li>
    <li> Had one of these puppies for 3 years.  It was great until it started randomly turning on.  I called customer support with receipt in hand and they said it was due to a fuaulty seal on the bottom which leaked water into the base and broke it.  Because it was past the warranty, the DID NOT SUPPORT THE PRODUCT and gave me a whopping 15% discount from their online store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No thanks Philips.  Recall your product if it is faulty.  Support it if there is a known issue.  I will not be purchasing any more Philips products based on their absolute lack of customer service and product backing.</li>
    <li> This brush is very nice indeed. Its design is sleek and easy to hold with a no slip surface that works well. I like how well it cleans. Also its very easily cleaned after use so this is a plus compared to the earlier G series.</li>
    <li> Very nice and easy to hold unit. Has enough battery storage for me to take just the brush on short vacations.</li>
    <li> our previous one gave up after 3 years.  could not wait to get the new one.  Since I have been brushing with this toothbrush my dentist allowed me to again cut back from three to two yearly cleanings.</li>
    <li> This is the second one purchased. We Wore the 1st one out. Will get another when this one quits working.</li>
    <li> Used this brush for about 2 years until it recently died.  I recently replaced it with the Sonicare (2 Brush) Platinum edition because of the cost difference.  I now miss my Flexcare which is easier to hold (slimmer, and has a rubber grip on the back of the handle), and has 2 buttons (v. one) to turn on/off, and select a mode.  My only real complaint about the Flexcare was that the base discolored and so did the handle. But I decided to save money and buy the Healthy White Diamond Clean Platinum edition, and now really miss my old Flexcare.  Additionally, you can purchase much smaller brush heads for sensitive teeth with Flexcare.  However, the good news is that those smaller brush heads fit the Platinum edition as well.  Flexcare is a great brush, your teeth will almost feel as clean as after a dental cleaning, but it is definitely pricey since it has to be replaced every couple of years.</li>
    <li> This is a much more powerful toothbrush than Sonicare&#x27;s first generation line of toothbrushes. Way more powerful, and my teeth come out feeling great after every brush. The charge can last all week if you brush twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s also a hidden wire tuck compartment underneath the base. Very cool.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare toothbrushes for years and the last one failed after a year.  I called Phillips and they sent a replacement and a return shipping container.  Good customer service.</li>
    <li> This is the version I loved, Its replacement E series left much to be desired</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had Sonicare toothbrushes in the past and the more advanced one I purchased is great.  I will definitely stay with Sonicare for my dental needs.</li>
    <li> Until the battery died way too soon (2 years), this was an excellent toothbrush. It had more features than I needed: never used anything but Go Care and Max Care (never used Clean, Sensitive, or Massage).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My previous model (Philips Sonicare HX6932/10 FlexCare RS930 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush), lasted four years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buying another Sonicare, but a cheaper, lesser-featured model.</li>
    <li> My flexcare was only a few months out of warranty when it stopped working.  Contacted customer service and they said I couldn&#x27;t send it for repair, but I could buy a new one from their on line store with a 15% discount.  When I pointed out that it was still more $ than what I could buy here on Amazon, they abruptly ended the chat session.  The guys name was Allen and I&#x27;ve never encountered such horrible service.  From reading the other reviews, that is their typical way of treating customers.  I&#x27;ll never go back to them.</li>
    <li> Very pleased and recommend!</li>
    <li> This is a great product for the money.  I kept my first one for 10 years.  These are built to last.</li>
    <li> Works well. Button for changing modes is poorly placed and is inadvertently actuated frequently while brushing teeth. Convenient charging station. Easy to maneuver.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my third one in two years.  Philips has been great and replaced both of the handsets that just quit working one day.  It&#x27;s basically just a battery and a small motor so I imagine they charge $100 in order to be able to afford replacing it every 12 months......</li>
    <li> My last sonic toothbrush died and it took me a few months to get it replaced. There was a huge difference when I went to got my teeth cleaned and the condition of my gums when i didn&#x27;t have the sonic toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I take it with me on trips and I dont need to bring a charger with me on a typical 5 day trip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like how it has a timer built-in that changes the vibration to let you know how long you have been brushing.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by my dentist to prevent damage to my gums because I was brushing too hard. It does what it is supposed to do. Most products fall short in some way. This one doesn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I love the sonicare line, My first sonic toothbrush over 10 years ago was a godsend. Now things have gotten even better with the sonicare line.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had my Flexcare for maybe 2 years now and its still going strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, my teeth have never felt better, and I like how I can chose a massage option with this to stimulate my gums. It really helps erase stains, without making my sensitive teeth worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did drop off 1 star for two reasons. Overall price (including price of replacement brushes) AND weirdo parts that are hard to clean. I have to immerse the bottom/top in alcohol once a week (the part that sits on charger, and the part that holds brush) or it gets the funkiest smell ever. That never happened with my old sonic brush.</li>
    <li> I love this tooth brush.  It really does make a difference in cleaning teeth and messaging gums.  The first brush broke due to a design defect that the company said it is &amp;#34;working on&amp;#34; , according to tech support.  I received a new brush quickly.  The defect allows the brush mount to break loose at its base in the handle.  Your brush will almost  stop vibrating when this happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It should be noted that this model has been replaced by a new version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tech support is very helpful.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a replacement to my older Sonicare toothbrush.  I cannot remember the model number, but it was OLD!  The first thing I noticed was that it was uber lighter than my previous one due to the lithium ion battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can most certainly tell the difference between the two. My teeth are slick after I brush, like when you just leave the dentist.  And I love that it doesn&#x27;t need to sit on the charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason for four stars and not five was the price.</li>
    <li> This is my second one of these, and I still love it.  I love all the functions and the long battery life.  Like this stand better then the one I had with the blue light germ killing thing.  This takes up very little space on my counter.  Teeth end up way cleaner using this.  Dentist says my gum health has improved.  There are cheaper models on the market, but none do as good of a job as Sonicare.</li>
    <li> REVIEW WRITTEN AFTER 1.5 YEARS&lt;br /&gt;--------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;5 stars toothbrush, 0 stars docking station.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this toothbrush after a very expensive dental cleaning to avoid future dentist visits. The toothbrush itself works great, and keeps my teeth and gums in good shape.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the docking station charger is has broken on me twice (stopped charging the brush). The first time was about 8 months after purchase. I was able to get the station replaced free of cost under warranty (2 years). Now in Feb 2015 the replacement docking station has broken again. I have contacted customer support for another replacement. However my faith in the reliability of the toothbrush is now shaken.&lt;br /&gt;I am still under the two year warranty. However if the docking station continues to break every 8 months next time I won&#x27;t be.</li>
    <li> Best  toothbrush ever! Got it after my dentist recommended it to me. So many settings and my teeth feel cleaner than they ever had. I would recommend getting the one with the sanitizer.</li>
    <li> My wife and I did a bunch of research and product price searching before buying. We decided to buy it here because it was the best price we could find. Toothbrush came 1 day earlier than expected and is a great product.</li>
    <li> Already have 3 of these and needed a 4th.  A much better deal than at my local grocery store.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I received my first Sonicare FlexCare around 2006 or 2007 when they came out, as part of a Bzzagent campaign.  It was replaced under warranty, and the battery finally went bad.  I noticed a huge difference in the way my teeth felt, as well as how white they were within days of using it.  I have had excellent dental checkups as well.  When it died, I couldn&#x27;t wait and immediately replaced it.  I considered buying the more expensive, new brush, but didn&#x27;t really see any different that would justify the expense.  I have the sanitizer as well but I rarely use it!</li>
    <li> Purchased this one as a replacement for one gave me years of excellent service and great dental checkups..  Loved the first, love the second.</li>
    <li> Sadly, I had to replace my original Sonic care. Had it for about eight years. This one is more lightweight. The charger base is different. If you put it out on the counter, it&#x27;s more prone to knocking over. Mine&#x27;s in a cabinet so it&#x27;s not too much of an issue. The on/off button is more sensitive than the original toothbrush. I accidentally shut it off nearly every time I use it which messes up the timer. When I first used the Max Care option, I thought the toothbrush was defective as the last bit of brushing has a different motor sound. But all in all, it&#x27;s a good toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I hate having to take the time to brush my teeth, but I love clean teeth. The sonicare line has the best electric toothbrushes out there. Before electric toothbrushes I would brush and brush and still the dentist would say I was doing a bad job of brushing. With the sonicare line I never hear that anymore. Now my hygenist says I have nice clean teeth. My dentist says I take good care of my teeth. And I always have that fresh from the hygenist clean teeth feeling... but I still go to the dentist once a year for cleanings and checkups.</li>
    <li> I have had this model for about 2 years. I like it so well that I bought one just like it for my husband.  It does keep a charge about 3 weeks as advertised.  It can get dirty but is easier to clean up and to keep clean than an earlier model I had.  It does a great job cleaning.</li>
    <li> As a mechanical engineer, \\&quot;the little things\\&quot; matter to me.  The cheesy base this comes with slides all over the counte due to the chintzy rubber \\&quot;anti-skid\\&quot; pads that Sonicare chose to specify in order to save 2 cents per brush.  I had some small, clear, 3M rubber pads on hand and solved the problem, after cleaning the base with rubbing alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why should I have to do this with a toothbrush in this price level?  My original Sonicare&#x27;s base remained in place for a decade.  It also used a \\&quot;plastic ring design that made reinserting the brush into the charging pad a cinch. Not so with this one, which uses a relatively tiny charging \\&quot;male\\&quot; that inserts into the female base of the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush offers five different brushing routines, but isn&#x27;t \\&quot;smart\\&quot; enough to remember the last chosen setting.  Hence, it must be reset each time you brush unless the default setting is your preferred setting.  Additionally, the mode select switch (silver color) is poorly positioned and is prone to being inadvertently switched to another brushing mode during use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A well designed brush would include a \\&quot;lock\\&quot; for the mode select switch, which would \\&quot;remember\\&quot; and lock the last setting and require 5 - 10 seconds of continuous pressing prior to being unlocked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush is not a well thought out and thoroughly engineered product and I&#x27;m thinking about returning it.  People should be fired for this.</li>
    <li> These are the best product for oral hygiene. Feels like you just left the dentist&#x27;s office having your teeth cleaned every time you brush.</li>
    <li> A wonderful addition to dental hygiene, and a great price.</li>
    <li> I ordered this toothbrush to replace an older but similar Sonicare toothbrush.  The order was shipped promptly and the product was  exactly as described.  Love the replacement more than than the original.</li>
