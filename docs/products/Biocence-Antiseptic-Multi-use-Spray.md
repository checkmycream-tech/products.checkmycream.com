      <li>(This was the 2nd time he had tested positive for MRSA...</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know when or if either infection will come back, but if it does I know I can make a choice to use a simple product made from simple things of the earth and experience quick positive results without any pain or discomfort.      </li>
      <li>When Neosporin did  not work on a wound on his arm, he used Biocence  and that started to clear the infection almost immediately.  </li>

      <li>I never encountered any itching, pain or the common out come of the red spot turning into an large pimple and, best of all no scaring that is usually left behind after the typical two week healing process.    </li>
      <li>By the time he woke up the following morning, he was back to his old self and moving around again like he was a puppy!  </li>
      <li>The outcome inspired me to contact the Biocence company directly and express my gratitude and during the conversation I mentioned I had suffered from a nasal infection for 15 plus years that made the inside and outside edges of my nostrils inflamed and constantly scabbed over.</li>
      <li>It kills toenail fungus, staph, and many other hard to kill viruses!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> It is too early to say if it worked or not.  I&#x27;ve only used it for a few weeks.  I&#x27;ll know better in another few weeks if it&#x27;s starting to clear up. I have a toenail fungus and it still too early to say.  Have a good day.</li>
    <li> My family and I have used Biocence for the past 2 years and it&#x27;s without a doubt the best antiseptic on the market. It&#x27;s great for cuts and bruises. A few weeks ago I accidentally cut myself slicing some fruit. Needless to say I was upset and bleeding all over the country. I wiped the wound off and applied Biocence to the cut. I let it air dry for a couple minutes and then reapplied. I applied it several times during the coarse of that day and each time let it air dry. I was amazed at the results from the first application. It definitely helped relieve the pain from the cut but also seemed to start healing the cut immediately as if adding a protective layer over the wounded area. I continued using Biocence on the cut for 2 days straight and by the second or 3rd day it felt great and was pretty much back to normal. It&#x27;s all natural but works fast. Like all natural ointments or medicines you have to apply it often and consistently to realize its full effect. The product also works great as a disinfectant for eliminating germs and bacteria of all kinds. My grandmother was diagnosed with C-diff which is a nasty staph infection. She got this as a result of a hospital stay after having a heart attack. In order to treat the C-diff we used Biocence everyday to fight off infection and keep her room free from germs. She also used it religiously on her hands and we sprayed it anywhere that germs could spread during that time. It helped tremendously. C-diff is very contagious and since Biocence kills staph infection on contact, it was a great thing to have at that time. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I ordered the Biocence spray just to keep on hand so if I did encounter a break out from the staph infection I contracted 6 years ago from providing home care for a family member recovering from a brain tumor removal procedure, I would have it on hand and ready to use at the first sign of an outbreak.     Approx. 3 weeks after receiving the product I had an infection show up on my thigh. I sprayed it on the noticeable red spot before it progressed to the surface, let it air dry and then reapplied it again. I left for an out of town job a few hours later and had forgot to pack the Biocence. The following afternoon I remembered to take a look at the flare up and much to my surprise the red spot was gone. I never encountered any itching, pain or the common out come of the red spot turning into an large pimple and, best of all no scaring that is usually left behind after the typical two week healing process.    The outcome inspired me to contact the Biocence company directly and express my gratitude and during the conversation I mentioned I had suffered from a nasal infection for 15 plus years that made the inside and outside edges of my nostrils inflamed and constantly scabbed over. They suggested I try the Biocence nasal spray. I received the Biocence nasal spray a few days later and immediately opened the box and administered the spray as the bottle suggested. Just for curiosity, I only used the nasal spray once to see what the outcome might be. Once again much to my surprise, within 24 hrs all the inflamed sore areas and the scabs were gone. That was two months ago and I&#x27;m still free of the pain, and sores that I lived with for 15 years plus. I do suggest using the product as suggested to achieve the best possible outcome. I just like to experiment with suggested dosages and frequencies so I can determine what amount works best for my own biology.     I don&#x27;t know when or if either infection will come back, but if it does I know I can make a choice to use a simple product made from simple things of the earth and experience quick positive results without any pain or discomfort.      Biocence is a king among all the jesters in the market place and made from 100% plant products. What a saving grace for humanity and the environment. If your still using alcohol based hand disinfectants produced from too many products that you can&#x27;t even begin to pronounce, I suggest filing them in the bin and procure a product that works and works fast.    I always champion products that meet or exceed their claims and Biocence is one of those products that has the potential to change the world without using unnatural petrochemical derivatives.</li>
    <li> worth every cent!  Used on psoriatic spots no medicated creams or ointments able to affect.  Daily spray has under control</li>
    <li> It kills toenail fungus, staph, and many other hard to kill viruses!  The fact that it is made from all natural ingredients makes it even better.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. Not only did it provide the anti-infection component for healing, but it appears to accelleate the healing process</li>
    <li> Keeps my face clear of acne. Feels good on my skin.  Also use it on my arms.&lt;br /&gt;I like the way it smells.</li>
    <li> As a parent of 3 I&#x27;m all too familiar with bandaging cuts and scrapes. I was not aware of MRSA until some of our friends were infected with \\&quot;this common antibiotic-resistant bacterium that causes skin and soft-tissue infections in healthy people, but can lead to invasive, sometimes fatal, infections in seriously sick patients and in those with weak immune systems\\&quot;(Dr. Aaron Milstone of the Johns Hopkins Children Center). The MRSA wreaked havok on their daughter and then both parents leaving scars on all of them.       Biocence is amazing and I recommend it to every parent I meet. This antiseptic spray is an \\&quot;all natural, organic botanical antimicrobial drug\\&quot; and it kills the \\&quot;super bugs\\&quot; including MRSA on contact.  This product also exceeded the FDA standards as a topical antiseptic. The best part is it is alcohol free so it won&#x27;t dry out your skin.    I replace my 4oz bottle when I change the batteries in my smoke detectors. I sleep better at night (well, when my twins let me sleep through the night) knowing my children are safe.</li>
    <li> My daughter had staph infection.  I was reluctant of giving her the antibiotics because of her reaction to strong antibiotics so I sprayed this on her infection.  It disappeared by the next day. It is pricey, but the effectiveness of this product is worth it. It goes a long way. I will never be without it in my medicine cabinet. Great for any skin conditions.  I developed psoriasis for the first time and one spray eradicated it.</li>
    <li> My 90 year old father has been using Biocence for the last 6 months. When Neosporin did  not work on a wound on his arm, he used Biocence  and that started to clear the infection almost immediately.  It is also very effective at clearing toe nail fungus.</li>
    <li> This product has saved me from multiple  operations and hospital stays. Biocence does exactly what it says.  In my situation...it&#x27;s a life saver.  ALL medical fields should know about this product and promote it.</li>
    <li> Our 7 yo son got a staph infection on his thigh this summer. We lanced what we thought was a fire ant bite, but our son was in excruciating pain, screaming, and the amount of infection (yellow pus) that came out was incredible for the small sore it was. Confounding. :-/ At this point, we didn&#x27;t realize it was anymore than just an infected bug bite. Over the next few days, inspite of using Sovereign Silver, essential oils, antibacterial soap, and topical antibiotics, the sores spread and his skin was fevered and he didn&#x27;t want to be touched. So we took him to the pediatrician, who immediately upon seeing it, said, &amp;#34;Yep, that&#x27;s staph.&amp;#34; Not just staph, but MRSA. (This was the 2nd time he had tested positive for MRSA...about 6 months earlier, he&#x27;d had it in a blocked eyelash follical, but it healed on it&#x27;s own.) This time the pede scripted us a stronger antibiotic ointment and oral Bactrim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have you ever read the side effects of Bactrim? He has had numerous gut flora issues and food intolerances, so I was scared to death to give it to him! So a friend lent us his bottle of Biocense, which we used on my son&#x27;s leg 3x a day for about 6 days. It took several days to notice any healing and more areas needed lancing, which were incredibly painful for my boy. But by the 6th day, his skin started flaking off and he was healed. I&#x27;m thrilled we had the chance to use Biocense and keep our boy&#x27;s intestinal system and the rest of his body safe from the Bactrim! I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I used on a rash that became infected.  Pain free and very cool, even as the rash is in a place that&lt;br /&gt;is constantly rubbed on.  I&#x27;ve used many other products.  This stuff is unbelievably&lt;br /&gt;fast and wonderful.  Highly recommend; as it&#x27;s all natural too!  Akron Ohio</li>
    <li> I had a sinus infection and tried something. I sprayed it into a small bowl of water and took an eye dropper and put it up one nostril and put my head back and let it go through my sinuses and then out my other nostril. Long story short...in a few days no infection, no headache, no dr. appt, no need for antibiotics....it just dissipated.</li>
    <li> I use this product whenever I&#x27;m sick. I usually always get strep throat and this product works absolute wonders for me.</li>
    <li> We are a family of 5 who has been using Biocence for several years. We&#x27;ve been able to drastically reduce the need for antibiotics as a result of using Biocence internally. We spray it under the tongue (2x&#x27;s a day) to ward of strep throat &amp; sinus infections when we feel them coming on (it can be used mildly as a nasal rinse as well). The number of ear infections our kids get has been reduced (put a little Biocence on a q-tip &amp; wipe around ear canal). It&#x27;s cleared up diaper rashes. We use it on scrapes &amp; cuts to keep infections from setting in &amp; to speed up the healing process. It&#x27;s been used to prepare for surgeries multiple times (apply to surgical area a few times a day for 3 or so days leading up to surgery to prevent hospital acquired MRSA). My husband travels frequently &amp; keeps a bottle handy to spray down his head rest on the plane, as well as the most germ prone areas of his hotel room. And last but not least, we use this as a hand sanitizer. I can&#x27;t say enough about the effectiveness &amp; number of uses for this all natural product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Angela (Texas)</li>
    <li> Gave it to a friend for a staph infection.  Cleared it up quicker than antibiotics.  Keep it around just in case.</li>
    <li> I am a missionary and run a project in Ethiopia www.gracecenterfoundation.org. We are very blessed to have found Biocence. It has saved many lives including the lives of my children. We use it externally for head fungus and other sores but also internally. It works especially well for a stomach flu or gastro intestinal problems. The amazing thing is that it doesn’t just cover the symptoms, it actually kills the virus or bacteria. I used to be sick for weeks from food poisoning and the many other issues that come with life in Ethiopia. I just use a couple sprays when I start to feel sick and it usually kills it before the illness really starts. I thank God for Biocence.</li>
    <li> Wonderful Product and really does work.  Used on bed sore and completely healed quickly.</li>
    <li> This is a product that will ALWAYS be in our home.  Our son had his appendix burst and had to spend some time in the hospital.  Our family stayed many hours visiting over the 3 days and we got MRSA.  We now have a 20 month old who gets staph here and there.  We immediately see the red bite looking sore and spray this on it and within 3 days it is gone!!!  She does not go to the Dr for it and she does not take antibiotics....BIOCENCE WORKS!  It saves us.  Our neighbor had a ingrown toenail that was cutting her skin...she used this and it was gone in a week...she had tried everything from the store and nothing but BIOCENCE worked!  Our Dog has bad skin and gets sores from flies....its terrible....until now....we use BIOCENCE on his sores and within days they are gone.  I can&#x27;t say enough about this product.  It should be in everyone&#x27;s medicine cabinet.</li>
    <li> Great for dogs too ... my pooch is very old and was not feeling too good.  I thought the day had come as he would not eat and would not even go for walks.  The night before I was about to take him to the vet, I sprayed Biocence in his water dish.  He drunk water through the night and he seemed to like it.  By the time he woke up the following morning, he was back to his old self and moving around again like he was a puppy!  Save me $$ from vet bill!!!</li>
