      <li>But I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll be perfect for wiping off my eye makeup at the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>good quality</li>
      <li>Good for toners and makeup removers.</li>
      <li>Really nice cotton wipe for taking off eye make up.</li>
      <li>I was hoping to immitate the wonderful saleswoman at Shisheido who was able to soak a couple of cotton squares, gently pull them apart, and then place them on my face for a mini-facial.  </li>
      <li>: so far, i think the best cotton pad is probably found at Daiso ($1.5 for 150 pads).</li>
      <li>It feels so nice :)</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s soft, i use it to remove makeup or to apply toner, very good quality.</li>
      <li>and they seem to do a better job of cleaning any remaining soap/wash residue off my face.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll do just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My favorite cotton for skin toners.&lt;br</li>
      <li>LOVE IT.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can find a better product else</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>More to be used like a cotton puff.</li>
      <li>I love Shiseido&#x27;s cotton pads</li>
      <li>So glad to find this product.</li>
      <li>Sure they aren&#x27;t the cheapest</li>
      <li>My toner that used to disappear too quickly now does not leaving more money in my pocket!</li>
      <li>I use this for my electronic cigarette wicking material and is very clean, no bleach residue</li>
      <li>I may have to give the Leed cotton sheets a try but for now this Daisan Being brand is pretty good.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also pretty good at soaking up the toner</li>
      <li>Cheap but high quality, great value.)</li>
      <li>EASY TO USE AND CLEAN.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>One piece of cotton pad can be easily turned into 3 pieces.</li>
      <li>and it arrived very quickly</li>
      <li>The sheets are really fine</li>
      <li>Though I do love them for things like first aid as well!</li>
      <li>you get a huge pack of them</li>
      <li>When you tear it into two parts it&#x27;s not so smooth.</li>
      <li>They make doing moisture masks a breeze, which by the way are FANTASTIC.</li>
      <li>all natural cotton is good on your skin</li>
      <li>And you don&#x27;t need to use very much, in fact I was able to use one square for both eyes.</li>
      <li>They separate easily and I am then able to use one side for my toner and one for witch hazel; they are very absorbent</li>
      <li>but they&#x27;re well worth it!</li>
      <li>and I even used them to clean my dogs ears.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t be used to clean of my make up since I feel the cotton will all grip apart</li>
      <li>They are ridiculously soft and unbelievalby absorbant when you put any kind of lotion on them.</li>
      <li>not bad.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve come to realize that Japanese cotton products are far superior to any I&#x27;ve been able to find in the US.</li>
      <li>I love that the cotton sheets don&#x27;t absorb all my product and that it goes directly to my face.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just worth the price.</li>
      <li>the cotton pads are so fine and smooth, very different compare to the ones from CVS.</li>
      <li>I too am a user of the famed Japanese Skincare Revolution method and the lovely Chizu Saeki</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I can now order through Amazon and not have to search for a Japanese market.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been looking everywhere for quality cotton squares that aren&#x27;t as expensive as Shiseido&#x27;s (which, imo, are the best around) &amp; these Daisan are just what I&#x27;ve been looking for.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a nice and soft cotton pads you should try this, you can always double the pas if you want it thicker since there&#x27;s 222 sheets</li>
      <li>They aren&#x27;t quite as capable of taking a beating as those cotton round thingies, but these are incredibly soft and gentle, and great for taking off eye makeup, or swiping a toner across your skin.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;- super soft cotton, feels great!&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>, you really can&#x27;t beat that.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Although these cotton squares didn&#x27;t work out as a facial mask - they are simply fabulous for removing eye make-up.</li>
      <li>They work really, really well</li>
      <li>They are about 2&amp;#34;x3&amp;#34;, and don&#x27;t really stretch.&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;First off, these sheets are undoubtedly cotton and are VERY absorbent.</li>
      <li>It stretches very well.</li>
      <li>BUT that does not mean woe is you!</li>
      <li>Mmmm, so soft!!!</li>
      <li>If it&#x27;s possible to be strong and soft at the same time, than these fit the bill.</li>
      <li>If not, these are much better than the average cotton pad.</li>
      <li>You can actually SPLIT these cotton sheets apart and tug them to make bigger and more accommodating to your face.</li>
      <li>High quality cotton sheets.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d definitely purchase these again the future - they&#x27;re a great alternative to our standard, bulky, American cotton balls/squares.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend this cotton pads.  </li>
      <li>I love these things, my only complaint is that I wish I had a better holder for them since they don&#x27;t fit well in the round thing I used to use for my cotton rounds.</li>
      <li>They are very soft and u can pull them apart if you don&#x27;t want a thinker piece.</li>
      <li>Very soft and leaves almost no lint on my face.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very soft.</li>
      <li>I purchased Shiseido cotton pads in the past and enjoyed them.</li>
      <li>Note: if you love super thick plush cotton balls or pads that can soak up ounces of product and still feel dry</li>
      <li>Unlike cheap cotton pads these don&#x27;t fall apart and pill leaving pieces of cotton mess everywhere.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re just as soft, but thinner than the Shiseido pads.</li>
      <li>Feel soft on skin and will not leave residuals.</li>
      <li>These things are so soft yet durable.</li>
      <li>I usually directly do this without putting on my hands.</li>
      <li>They might be a little more expensive than the ones I usually buy from Wal-Mart, or Target, or Ultra 3 - but in the long run they are a much better bargain and a much more luxurious way to remove eye make-up.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re useless as masks, but I love the quality and texture so much that I&#x27;d buy them again for my toner application.</li>
      <li>I honestly don&#x27;t mind how thin the pads are because I only use two (one each eye) to remove my eye makeup and to use my toner.</li>
      <li>These pads are very soft as well as strong and Yet not overly thick, especially when peeled apart.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not rough on my skin!</li>
      <li>I mainly use these for my acid toner because that is just something that I don&#x27;t want to have prolonged exposure to my hands since it causes them to dry out and peel.  </li>
      <li>I love that they are already so thin, but then I can peel them apart and make them thinner and last longer.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is a little tough to gently pull them apart into thinner sheets, and once I was able to accomplish this feat and placed them on my face -</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> great value with great price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d never used the product before and looked at what feels like a million different options on amazon.com before deciding on ordering these \\&quot;sheets\\&quot; (based on quantity:cost and product reviews) - I wanted something to use to put toner on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I&#x27;m still getting used to how thin the sheets are (compared to the cotton squares I&#x27;ve been using for years) everything about the product is great. I like that because the sheets are thin I&#x27;m creating a lot less waste than with cotton balls/squares. The sheets are really fine and they seem to do a better job of cleaning any remaining soap/wash residue off my face. I haven&#x27;t tried using them with nail polish remover but I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll do just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d definitely purchase these again the future - they&#x27;re a great alternative to our standard, bulky, American cotton balls/squares.</li>
    <li> I purchased Shiseido cotton pads in the past and enjoyed them. Since I have zero brand loyalty, I thought I&#x27;d give these a try. They&#x27;re just as soft, but thinner than the Shiseido pads. They didn&#x27;t tear when wet, but they aren&#x27;t as sturdy as I&#x27;d like. If you have access to Shiseido, buy those. If not, these are much better than the average cotton pad.</li>
    <li> My favorite cotton for skin toners.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this product for about 4 years.  I&#x27;m glad I can now order through Amazon and not have to search for a Japanese market.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just worth the price. When you tear it into two parts it&#x27;s not so smooth. But still they will not leave anything on your face using a toner to mask myself.</li>
    <li> It is not too big but it can be divided to two layer. Good for toners and makeup removers. Great value I uploaded the images of how I use this. You can separate it dry or wet.   Middle pic Is not separated. I usually directly do this without putting on my hands. Just to show you guys. Hope this will help.</li>
    <li> Really nice cotton wipe for taking off eye make up. Feel soft on skin and will not leave residuals.</li>
    <li> It is a great product. One piece of cotton pad can be easily turned into 3 pieces. I always use both tap water and some toner to wet the cotton pad. After putting the separated 3 pieces on my face, I can leave them on for 3 minutes. That is my everyday facial mask routine!</li>
    <li> I purchased these because I use a very expensive glycolic acid toner and I was tired of all the product I seemed to be wasting. These pads are very soft as well as strong and Yet not overly thick, especially when peeled apart. They separate easily and I am then able to use one side for my toner and one for witch hazel; they are very absorbent so I only need to use a small amount for my entire face and neck. Unlike cheap cotton pads these don&#x27;t fall apart and pill leaving pieces of cotton mess everywhere. After using these I can&#x27;t go back to the other kinds! Sure they aren&#x27;t the cheapest but they&#x27;re well worth it! My toner that used to disappear too quickly now does not leaving more money in my pocket! A definite recommend and repurchase!  Note: if you love super thick plush cotton balls or pads that can soak up ounces of product and still feel dry these are not for you. Though I do love them for things like first aid as well! Perfect!</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t split apart into sheets like I have seen with another Japanese brand.  You can pull it apart like in the picture, but the inside is all fuzz, not smooth like the outside layer.</li>
    <li> I LOVED THIS! It feels so nice :) It&#x27;s not rough on my skin! It&#x27;s also pretty good at soaking up the toner I use~</li>
    <li> I am loving this stuff! I too am a user of the famed Japanese Skincare Revolution method and the lovely Chizu Saeki has not lead me wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, these sheets are undoubtedly cotton and are VERY absorbent. They make doing moisture masks a breeze, which by the way are FANTASTIC. They are not as big as I initially expected (they&#x27;re a bit smaller than a credit card) BUT that does not mean woe is you! You can actually SPLIT these cotton sheets apart and tug them to make bigger and more accommodating to your face. I can now make a single cotton sheet into three cotton sheet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use four sheets every session making my stash usable for 55.5 sessions.  Since I only do these moisture masks about 2 to 3 times a week, this is going to last me quite awhile and I&#x27;m definitely looking to repurchase when the time comes!</li>
    <li> LOVE IT. EASY TO USE AND CLEAN.&lt;br /&gt;I WILL TELL OTHER PEOPLE ABOUT THAT.ENJOY IT IN DAILY LIFE. THANK YOU!</li>
    <li> The one of the cotton sheets was opened,spilled shampoo or detergent over the bag and sheets. I only saved like 1/4 cotton sheets can use. It&#x27;s really weird that cotton sheets had plastic bag wrap it still have a problem.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend this cotton pads.  These require less liquid and stays moist.  I&#x27;d recommend it. ,,,,,, ,,,,,,,,, ,,,,,, , , , , , , , ,</li>
    <li> I use this for my electronic cigarette wicking material and is very clean, no bleach residue</li>
    <li> not bad. good quality</li>
    <li> Soft, but very thin, when wet it can easily fall apart if you use it a bit hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can find a better product else where.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(NOTE: so far, i think the best cotton pad is probably found at Daiso ($1.5 for 150 pads). Cheap but high quality, great value.)</li>
    <li> Not what I expected - difficult to pull apart into layers for make-up remover because it is fuzzy on the inside, which is how I wanted to use it.  More to be used like a cotton puff.</li>
    <li> Very soft and leaves almost no lint on my face. I can use less skincare product with these cotton pads. Love it.</li>
    <li> It is expensive and always leaves cotton residue on my face.</li>
    <li> Love these!!  They aren&#x27;t quite as capable of taking a beating as those cotton round thingies, but these are incredibly soft and gentle, and great for taking off eye makeup, or swiping a toner across your skin.  i don&#x27;t recommend these for, let&#x27;s say, sewing into a dress, but if you&#x27;re buying these to make a dress out of them, I&#x27;m not sure my advice will be valuable to you anyway.  Mmmm, so soft!!!</li>
    <li> After watching a YouTube video of a makeup guru using Leed cotton sheets instead of regular cotton pads to remove her makeup, I decided to make a similar purchase. These cotton sheets are not like an ordinary cotton pad. They&#x27;re thinner and helps save product. If you put makeup remover or toner, the cotton sheet stays hydrated longer than regular cotton pads. They still leave somewhat of a cotton residue on the face but it&#x27;s definitely not to the extreme that cotton pads do. I may have to give the Leed cotton sheets a try but for now this Daisan Being brand is pretty good.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s soft, i use it to remove makeup or to apply toner, very good quality. and it arrived very quickly</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking everywhere for quality cotton squares that aren&#x27;t as expensive as Shiseido&#x27;s (which, imo, are the best around) &amp; these Daisan are just what I&#x27;ve been looking for. They&#x27;re affordable, made well, leave no messy cotton residue behind, and help make a little bit of product go a long way. I&#x27;ve come to realize that Japanese cotton products are far superior to any I&#x27;ve been able to find in the US. I&#x27;m so grateful to online stores like Amazon for offering access to international brands I probably would&#x27;ve never discovered otherwise.</li>
    <li> I was looking for the cotton squares mentioned in the book &amp;#34;Japanese Skincare Revolution.&amp;#34;  You&#x27;re supposed to stretch out cotton squares, saturate them with lotion and water, then mummify your face with it for 3-5 minutes until your skin hydrates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These squares are not it.  They are about 2&amp;#34;x3&amp;#34;, and don&#x27;t really stretch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- super soft cotton, feels great!&lt;br /&gt;- thick and plush, very absorbent&lt;br /&gt;- you get a huge pack of them&lt;br /&gt;- all natural cotton is good on your skin&lt;br /&gt;- you can peel then into 2 sheets if you want&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- expensive, considering these are basically flattened cotton balls&lt;br /&gt;- leaves cotton residue on your face no matter what&lt;br /&gt;- don&#x27;t stretch&lt;br /&gt;- not ideal for Japanese Skincare Revolution&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to make a Japanese face mask, buy the actual cotton &amp;#34;Paper Face Mask&amp;#34; packs that Amazon sells.  You get 100 and they are pre-cut into mask shapes.  They work really, really well (you can check out my review over there).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up using these cotton squares to apply toner to my face.  They&#x27;re useless as masks, but I love the quality and texture so much that I&#x27;d buy them again for my toner application.</li>
    <li> I like these cotton squares because it does not scratch your face.  They are very soft and u can pull them apart if you don&#x27;t want a thinker piece.</li>
    <li> I use this for lotion mask. Perfect! It stretches very well. It&#x27;s very soft. So glad to find this product.</li>
    <li> High quality cotton sheets.</li>
    <li> The cottons i thought was very thin. I love Shiseido&#x27;s cotton pads but it&#x27;s pricey so I opt for this. I honestly don&#x27;t mind how thin the pads are because I only use two (one each eye) to remove my eye makeup and to use my toner. If you&#x27;re looking for a nice and soft cotton pads you should try this, you can always double the pas if you want it thicker since there&#x27;s 222 sheets, you really can&#x27;t beat that. Overall I like this it doesn&#x27;t absorb the product that you put on it; no product is wasted.</li>
    <li> after applying toning lotion and wiping my face, i would often find bits and pieces of the cotton on my face. it&#x27;s not that different from any cotton pads one can get at a US supermarket.</li>
    <li> Second time purchasing these and I still will continue to repurchase them. I love that they are already so thin, but then I can peel them apart and make them thinner and last longer. I love that the cotton sheets don&#x27;t absorb all my product and that it goes directly to my face. I mainly use these for my acid toner because that is just something that I don&#x27;t want to have prolonged exposure to my hands since it causes them to dry out and peel.  However, I have tried a diy mask by using my hydrating toner and it works great for those as well.</li>
    <li> good quality of cotton pads and there are a lot! the cotton pads are so fine and smooth, very different compare to the ones from CVS.</li>
    <li> I was hoping to immitate the wonderful saleswoman at Shisheido who was able to soak a couple of cotton squares, gently pull them apart, and then place them on my face for a mini-facial.  Unfortunately either due to my ineptness (or maybe I should just buy the Shisheido cotton pads) I just didn&#x27;t get the  result I was hoping for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a little tough to gently pull them apart into thinner sheets, and once I was able to accomplish this feat and placed them on my face - I looked like a refugee from a failed medical experiment.  All of those uneven, half-soaked, misplaced pieces of cotton scattered across my face just didn&#x27;t do it for me.  But I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll be perfect for wiping off my eye makeup at the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although these cotton squares didn&#x27;t work out as a facial mask - they are simply fabulous for removing eye make-up. They are ridiculously soft and unbelievalby absorbant when you put any kind of lotion on them. And you don&#x27;t need to use very much, in fact I was able to use one square for both eyes. Also, they don&#x27;t fall apart like cheaper brands do. If it&#x27;s possible to be strong and soft at the same time, than these fit the bill. They might be a little more expensive than the ones I usually buy from Wal-Mart, or Target, or Ultra 3 - but in the long run they are a much better bargain and a much more luxurious way to remove eye make-up.</li>
    <li> This cotton pad is too thick and it would taste a lot of product. I can&#x27;t be used to clean of my make up since I feel the cotton will all grip apart</li>
    <li> I love these things, my only complaint is that I wish I had a better holder for them since they don&#x27;t fit well in the round thing I used to use for my cotton rounds. These things are so soft yet durable. I use them on my face, to remove eye make-up, nail polish and I even used them to clean my dogs ears. I will be buying these again.</li>
