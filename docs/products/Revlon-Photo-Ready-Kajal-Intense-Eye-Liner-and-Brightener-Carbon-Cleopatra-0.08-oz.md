      <li>Great eyeliner!</li>
      <li>this is perfect liner, of course they all smudge</li>
      <li>this is perfect.</li>
      <li>One of the best eyeliner&#x27;s i&#x27;ve used</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great tool!!</li>
      <li>Awesome product.  </li>
      <li>This kajal is just awesome.</li>
      <li>all are very good</li>
      <li>Great Product.  </li>
      <li>Gives me a lot of control and great pigment.</li>
      <li>good product would buy again</li>
      <li>You will love how easily it glides on!</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t find it in stores any more.</li>
      <li>love this product also  </li>
      <li>I always love Revlon n</li>
      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>So glad i found this online.</li>
      <li>I tried it a couple of times just to make sure and</li>
      <li>not waterproof...smudges easily..frequently need to be sharpened...not easily applies...</li>
      <li>I love this top, and it&#x27;s so pretty</li>
      <li>It is also convenient to carry around and is fuss free in application and handling.</li>
      <li>Thank  you so much!!!</li>
      <li>Great eyeliner, smooth application, long lasting.</li>
      <li>Super fast shipping.  </li>
      <li>Either way, I probably will buy at a drugstore the next time to make sure it&#x27;s the product and not the seller&#x27;s fault.</li>
      <li>I like having the highlighter on the opposite end and the product blends easily.</li>
      <li>The pencil works well and does not smudge readily.</li>
      <li>I  have very sensitive eyes, but so far the product has not irritated my eyes.</li>
      <li>I did like the ease of use and final look, so I&#x27;m giving a positive rating.</li>
      <li>Revlon Photo Ready Kajal are of the same consistency (which would not be wort my money) or perhaps this one has been sitting awhile at the seller&#x27;s location exposed to heat.</li>
      <li>every time I had to find a mirror and try to clean my under eye mess.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I expected.  </li>

<li> The only reason I give it 3 stars is because when I went to sharpen it, a chunk of the kohl went down the garbage.</li>
<li> Honestly, I&#x27;ve only used this product about three times since receiving it, for the simple fact that I only use it when applying false eyelashes, and that&#x27;s not an everyday event for me.</li>
<li> I use the darker half and have had no occasion or use for the brightener end.</li>
<li> The dark liner from your eyelids falls under your eye after just a couple of hours and it looks like you have very dark circles.</li>
<li> but I like little smudgy look</li>
<li> Not sure if all eyeliners</li>
<li> One of the worst eye liners I ever used.</li>
