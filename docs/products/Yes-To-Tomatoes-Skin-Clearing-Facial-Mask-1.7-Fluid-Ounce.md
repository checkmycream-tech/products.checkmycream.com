<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> love this product. really clears the pores and leaves you with smooth skin.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it yet but I have a feeling it will be good!</li>
    <li> Works well, but smells weird.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had skin issues for more than 15 years.  I wish I could buy a lifetime supply of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells kind of weird but after you&#x27;ve used it once, you&#x27;ll notice a difference.</li>
    <li> This is the only product line that actually works on my face. I can tell a huge difference in the overal health and look of my skin compared to when I used name brand products such as clearasil or clean and clear. This is now the only product that I will use on my face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been dealing with adult acne since my son was born two years ago, and stumbled upon the Yes To brand about a month ago. Having tried everything else, I gave the Tomatoes line a shot.... and fell in love with it. I use this mask 1-2 times a week in conjunction with the Yes To Tomatoes Daily Balancing Moisturizer and Yes To Cucumbers Daily Gently Cleanser. My skin is softer, healthier looking, and my breakouts are clearing up nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The container for the mask is rather small - it fits in the palm of my hand easily. However, a little of the mask goes a long way; it spreads easily and only a thin layer is needed. It washes off easily with warm water. While the smell from the Tomatoes line isn&#x27;t as nice as the Cucumbers, I&#x27;ve found that it&#x27;s really grown on me and I&#x27;ve come to enjoy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other reviewers complained of their skin feeling burned or being red after using this, and I have experienced a little redness after washing off the mask. I attributed it to a mix of hot water and scrubbing with the wash cloth, and have had no issues with my skin since using this product. With that said, I would steer clear of this mask if you have sensitive skin (or it you don&#x27;t really experience breakouts too often) as it seems to be a problem for some people.</li>
    <li> A sample packet came on something else i bought so I decided to try it. Well this stuff burnt the heck out of my face! I didnt even leave it on for 30 seconds, the burning was that painful. Now all around mouth and lips feel like i slammed my face down on a hot stove after getting lip insections. The pain has been constant for about 7 HOURS. Id say about a 7 or an 8 out of 10 pain level.</li>
    <li> What a great product for such a great price.  I have combination skin with adult acne, and this mask does a great job at helping to clear my skin.  It is gentle but effective.  I use it a few times a week, and I generally leave it on for a bit longer than the recommended 5 minutes.  It has practically no fragrance, and the fact that it&#x27;s 98% natural is a nice plus!</li>
    <li> I have gluten allergy and when I get a cross-contamination my face breaks out terribly, and this is the only mask I&#x27;ve ever found that helps calms my skin while not over drying it or hurting the sensitivity of my skin.  I love this mask!  I&#x27;ve been purchasing it almost religiously since I discovered it almost two years ago and I go through a container every 1-2 months.&lt;br /&gt;However the last two containers have done something incredibly weird for me.  The mask doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly but rather won&#x27;t stay on my skin at all and gets all crumbly.  It&#x27;s not dried out, it just won&#x27;t apply to my face at all.  Last time this happened it had been a couple weeks since I had used it and there was just one or two applications left so I just tossed it and bought a new one.  But this time right after opening it immediately did this and I am SOOO disappointed.</li>
    <li> It isn&#x27;t all that great, it made my skin softish. I had to stop using it because it caused me to break out kinda badly - i guess it doesn&#x27;t work for everyone. I didn&#x27;t, however, break out to the carrots one.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I think it works great and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all, which I think I have pretty sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> As a spot treatment it&#x27;s awesome. The smell is pleasant and not overwhelming. As an all over face mask? My skin was immediately irritated after I put it on and when I washed the mask off it was red and over sensitive. I splashed cold water on and that seemed to help soothe my skin and I left it free of any products so I wouldn&#x27;t over-irritate it. I&#x27;ll use the mask as a spot treatment until it runs out, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be purchasing again. I love the Yes To brand, but this mask just didn&#x27;t work out as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for an all natural product for years and now I&#x27;ve found it! This facial mask feels wonderful and it leaves my face feeling refreshed and just all over better.</li>
    <li> I am not sure if the others who reviewed this use the Yesto tomatoes or Yesto Cucumbers line. I use the Yesto tomatoes face wash and the Yesto cucumbers night lotion (unless my face is very dry I use the Dermae vitamin E cream). This mask is wonderful. I have very sensitive skin and it did not cause any inflammation or discomfort at all, it seems more hydrating than for acne. I am really glad they came out with this! If you use this line of skincare I would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I like this face mask. I use it more of an overnight treatment. Put it on your pimples ivernught and by morning they&#x27;re much better! Only reason I rated 4 is because its a small amount for a pricey amount but overall good!</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t used a face mask for years, but was feeling like it was time to incorporate something a little different into my skin regimen. I try to stick with natural products, so was happy to find this mask from yes-to. Every time I use it (once every/other week) my skin feels so soft, my complexion looks smooth and clear, and I feel like it helps firm things up a little too. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Yes! This stuff is awesome. I use it once weekly and it definitely does the job. My skin is clearer and softer. I will continue to use this... Application and removal is easy and quick... I&#x27;m not a fan of complex beauty regimens and this fits the bill perfectly.</li>
    <li> Loved this noticed a difference right away. i wash y face while in the shower and then dry my face and put this on after and my face is brighter and i can see the tiny red pimples starting to fade away</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this long enough to know if it helps with clearing blemishes but it certainly hasn&#x27;t caused any like some other face products has. It also makes my face super soft and makes me feel like im at a spa while I have it on</li>
    <li> UPDATE: Had to stop use of this product as my acne was out of control after a few months of using this product. I switched to Proactive since my acne has gotten so severe while using the Yes to Carrots. I wish this product had of worked, but it wasnt strong enough or maybe was causing more break outs on my face! Ugh...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A small jar, filled with a lot of power! This is a great product! I use it a few times a week and I really like it. The container is small, but the mask inside it awesome. You dont need much, and it applies easily. After you apply, I waited about 5 minutes and allowed it to dry. It came off nicely with a wet towel and then I just splashed water on my face to remove any left over mask. My face felt so clean and fresh after I used this too. I also noticed that my acne began to clear up after I used it once. Highly reccomend!</li>
    <li> Gentle, but still effective. Skin feels great and glowing after use. With my acne, it took about 2 weeks, using about 3-4 times a week and my breakouts have come under control. The blemishes I do get are smaller, less painful, and clear quickly. I use it twice a week now. I like the smell and it is not too drying/harsh like some masks for acne tend to be. I like to apply when my skin is damp and a little of the mask goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I use this about twice a week to really clean up and tighten my pores.  It keeps my acne from getting full-blown and has kept my face from appearing too red.  I use this with the daily scrub, and have noticed a big difference in how my skin feels and behaves.  I would definitely recommend this product (and the entire Yes to Tomatoes line).</li>
    <li> I am in late 20&#x27;s and have worse acne now than I did in my teens.  A friend recommended I try this mask considering my problems with my skin and I was hesitant, but I am glad I did!  It does not solve my acne problem, but it does leave my skin so soft and hydrated and reduces a lot of the redness and inflammation in my skin.  I love using this mask, and use it once or twice a week.  I highly recommend giving it a try for those of you struggling with acne.</li>
    <li> love this stuff! good for those days when you feel that your skin is just full of gunk and when it&#x27;s breaking out.</li>
    <li> This mask didn&#x27;t work AT ALL as a 5 minute mask, but after reading some other reviews I started using it as an overnight spot treatment and it worked wonders. I&#x27;ve been using this every night and apple cider vinegar every day for about 4 days, and my moderate acne has almost completely disappeared. I think the mask helps prevent those awful acne scars too which is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be fooled by the amount of product given. It seemed expensive for so little to me, but a little goes a LONG way with this stuff. I think I have enough for a year even using it daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very, very happy. Works way better than Yes to Tomatoes spot stick.</li>
    <li> My skin is sensitive, unpredictable, and prone to &#x27;adult acne&#x27; (fun, right?) and this mask has been SO helpful. I use either this mask or their cucumber mask every evening between cleansing and moisturizing and I really believe it has significantly helped my skin to be more consistently clear. I&#x27;ve recommended it several times.</li>
    <li> Love this face mask I am the type of person to do a lot a reviews before I buy a product the smell is a bit strong but the mask itself is great</li>
    <li> A GREAT FACE MASK FOR ANYONE WHO SUFFERS FROM ACNE. I LOVE THE FACT THAT THIS PRODUCT IS CRUELTY FREE. GREAT PRICE</li>
    <li> I bought this because of the excellent reviews and because I already use the yes to tomatoes acne gel, but this burned like crazy.  I wiped it off and my face was bright red and sore for at least half an hour.</li>
    <li> OUCH!  I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin at all and this product burnt the crap out of my face.  I didn&#x27;t even leave it on 5 minutes.  And it smells like hamster urine to me, reminded me of when I was a little kid and i had to clean my pet hamsters cage.</li>
    <li> I bought this from my local Target store ($15) thinking it would be pretty great, but it was the exact opposite for me. I like using clay and mud masks to help get rid of my black heads and keep my pores small. I used this product for a month almost everyday and it did nothing for me. I spent way too much for nothing. I&#x27;m never doubting my Mint Julep Mask ever again. That stuff really works for a fraction of this over priced stuff that does nothing. Plus you get so little for what it costs. Not worth it and I would not recommend this item.</li>
    <li> I used this mask last night after I bought it at target. I left it on for about 7 minuets before it started to become uncomfortable.. I used a warm washcloth to take it off and noticed that where the mask had been my face was bright red, hot and almost itchy. I used cool water on my face, like the directions say, and it barley helped. For almost 3 hours my face was bright red, hot and uncomfortable. I tried ice cold water, non-scented lotion and the only thing that helped was time. Not to mention that when I woke up today I was breaking out even worse than yesterday.. Everyone has their own reaction, but for something that&#x27;s had so many people with bad reactions its definitely not worth the money.</li>
    <li> My Holy Grail! I&#x27;ve got very oily, sensitive, acne-prone skin and large-ish pores on my cheeks and nose. I don&#x27;t really have a problem with pimples on a daily basis, but once in a while (or more like once a month...) I get horrible breakouts, I&#x27;m talking like 10-15 pimples on my face at a time. The painful, red kind that usually take a while to clear up. This mask makes my breakouts go away 3 or 4 times as fast as normal. When I feel a breakout coming on, I&#x27;ll apply this mask and rinse off 15 minutes later. By then the pimples are usually only half the size they were pre-mask, no lie! I&#x27;ll then apply my usual face lotion and use it as a spot treatment at night, and my pimples are significantly smaller. It&#x27;s one of the only products I&#x27;ll trust when I&#x27;m breaking out. When I&#x27;m not breaking out, I&#x27;ll use this once or twice weekly to clean up my pores and what not. I feel like this helps prevent breakouts if you feel one coming on. Also, makes your skin feel soooo soft after using! I&#x27;ve repurchased probably over 10 times now. Definitely worth it!</li>
    <li> This worked really well for me as a weekly mask - dries out greasy skin, seems to make pores less noticeable temporarily, made my skin soft.  The jar is quite small though.</li>
    <li> When I opened it, the container was 1/3rd empty. It looked like someone took a scoop out of it, not really sure what that&#x27;s about. The product itself was great, it makes your skin feel great and leaves it bright after usage.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had adult cystic acne (I&#x27;m 27 years old) for a year now, and I&#x27;d really just about given up on finding a solution.  No joke, I used this mask once, and my ongoing blemishes were smaller, and after continued use I have had no outbreaks in the two weeks that I&#x27;ve been using this mask (2-3 times/wk).  I started using the three-step Yes to Tomatoes Acne treatment system at the same time, but I think the credit goes to this mask.  Like some other reviews have mentioned, I use the mask on burgeoning zits overnight, and they are nearly gone by morning.  I can&#x27;t stress how bad my acne was, and how much better it is now.  It really has been a miracle for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Others have mentioned feeling burning and redness from this mask, and I have had that reaction twice as well.  It went away in a matter of a couple of hours, and I feel it&#x27;s worth putting up with for reduction in acne symptoms. It hasn&#x27;t happened every time I use it, though.  Just monitor your skin, and make sure it&#x27;s not on for more than five minutes.</li>
    <li> I have balanced/oily skin with large pores on my nose, cheeks and forehead, as well as sebaceous filaments (those little gray dots) on my nose. One use of this mask has tightened everything up: my pores are noticeably smaller, and my nose is smooth. I could actually see the mask pulling oils out of my pores while it dried. In addition, the small breakout on my chin calmed right down. My skin looks smooth and even.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An hour after the mask came off, my face feels moisturized and not dry or stripped. I love the organic ingredients and the lack of parabens, phthalates and sodium laureth sulfates. I highly recommend this mask, and will check out other Yes To products in the future.</li>
    <li> I have been getting facials since I was 12--and at 45 I can tell you I have searched high and low for a mask that actually works and this one is the BEST one I have found so far. I use it 1x a week and even added it on as a subscription with Amazon so I never run out. My tween has started to get blackheads and I use it on him now too--can never start them too early on good skincare!</li>
    <li> I love all the Yes To Tomato Products.  I use the Tomato cleansing wipes every night, the Tomato Mask every other day and the Yes to Carrots Night Cream every night.  I started getting a lot of chin acne due to PCOS which is a hormonal imbalance.  It was driving me insane as I have never experienced this before.  After I started using these products I noticed a difference within the first week.  I recommended them to my sister because she is have a lot of acne during her pregnancy.  Since the products are mostly natural her doctor said she could use them.  They all are worth the money.  (Using my husband&#x27;s account so this is coming from a woman)</li>
    <li> This item u sent is not usable it&#x27;s exactly like rubber waste of my money really am very disappointed by this</li>
    <li> This product feels, looks, and smells like clay. It shows results fast. after one use I have found that it does add a glow to your skin. It leaves your skin feeling nice also. As the other reviews suggest the container is small. BUT thats&#x27;s okay. you only need a small amount to spread a thin layer over the skin. If you dont use this more than 1-3 times a week. It should be pretty long lasting.</li>
    <li> Fabulous mask! I love the whole yes to tomatoes line but this mask is a favorite. Can also be used as a spot treatment</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this last night.  I had to comment after one use.&lt;br /&gt;I washed my face with a simple soap, smoothed the mask on &amp; waited for about 7 mins.&lt;br /&gt;How my face felt as I rinsed the mask off surprised me.  Usually my face feels tight &amp; I have a tough time scraping all of the product off.  Not with this.  My face felt soft &amp; moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;I went to bed right after and slept for about 4 hours.  I went to the restroom and was amazed at how my face looked in the mirror.  Prior to use of the mask, I noticed a red lump that clearly wanted to cause trouble.&lt;br /&gt;There was no trace of it now.  I&#x27;m serious.&lt;br /&gt;Also, there was a blemish on my cheek that reduced about 20-30% in size.&lt;br /&gt;I liked the way my face looked &amp; felt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not hesitate to purchase this.&lt;br /&gt;I find this to be a well-formulated product that actually proves to be effective.</li>
    <li> I plan on using the mask every other night.  The first time I used it I felt a tingling sensation and was worried my skin was too sensitive for it.  But no red marks or pain.  It felt great, and fingers crossed it&#x27;s the cure to my adult acne.</li>
    <li> I love the way this mask makes my skin look and feel! The black heads on my nose are a lot less after this mask. However, they do return in a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use it as a spot treatment if I have a breakout. I leave it on the spot overnight, and it greatly reduces the pimple by morning (much better than the Yes to Tomatoes roll on spot treatment).</li>
    <li> I love the way this mask feels on my skin, It tingles only slightly when I put it on but then that sensation goes away.  Never have had an adverse reaction to it yet and i have somewhat sensitive skin.  This product works well for me and it&#x27;s such a small bottle that even if it hadn&#x27;t i wouldn&#x27;t feel bad for trying.</li>
    <li> The Yes To skin care line is amazing. I love that it is almost 100% natural and I use it several times a week. I alternate the Skin Clearing Tomatoes Facial Mask with the Carrots softening Facial Mask and my skin has never looked better! I also use the Carrots facial cleansing scrub a couple times a week. I love these products and plan to make them my whole facial cleansing system.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite mask it leaves my skin so soft.</li>
    <li> First of all, i bought this product having used some of the other products from this line that worked nice for me. In my eagerness to have nice skin for the weekend, i didn&#x27;t bother to test it out on a small patch of skin first (always test it on a small patch first). I read the instructions and followed them. Five minutes later i wipe the mask off and, lone be hold, i had chemical burns in the exact form the mask was put on! It has now been almost two hours and it has gotten worse, my face is now hot and almost scarlet colored, not to mention the odd texture on the skin around my nose! Which is in bright contrast to my pale skin. I let it breath for a while, then i used the \\&quot;St. Ives Fresh Face Apricot Scrub\\&quot; (which i love) to make sure i got all of the \\&quot;mask\\&quot; out. I DO think that the burns will be gone in a few hours, but this is no recompense for the products ability&#x27;s to irritate my skin to the max. All in all, this product was an extreme disappointment!!</li>
    <li> I love this brand - my skin is sensitive and combination. This is the only brand so far that I have tried products from that have actually worked! No skin irritation, just smooth skin afterward. I love it. However, it is hard to spread on face as it dries quickly!</li>
    <li> I have combination skin and this mask has helped the most when it comes to clearing up my skin. The smell is not the best but it&#x27;s not terrible either. I love this product and will be buying again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 26 year old men and I bought to help me with my oily skin and it works wonders and I got it for $9 which is a great price!</li>
    <li> Amazing! this product is a must buy. My skin has never had a glow like this before. Even my BROTHER noticed and he is now hooked on it too. Use it 2x/week.. Seriously recommend this product even if you dont have acne (I dont)</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t break out after using it and my skin feels amazing afterwards.</li>
    <li> I love this mask!  I saw results right away - my skin was super smooth and glowing after I used it.  Also, I have sensitive skin, but this mask caused no skin irritation, which is great!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! It smells so good and really works great. It has a refreshing felling on your face and I would recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> This mask makes my skin feel so soft afterwards!  It also does a really good job at clearing my skin.  I always feels so clean after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 starts is because my roommate used it too and it really dried her skin out.  However, I had no problems so it must really depend on your skin type.  I would say I have normal skin... it&#x27;s not overly oily or dry.</li>
    <li> Just like some other reviewers, I had the problem of a very red skin and a burning sensation where I used this product. I&#x27;m assuming that it&#x27;s because I used too much, too quickly, but only time will tell. I will see if this continues, but as of now, I would definitely not recommend this product if you have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> My skin feels incredible after every facial mask. I use it about two or three times a week. It tightens my skin and leaves a nice texture. You need to try it. The price is great so trying it once won&#x27;t break your bank!</li>
    <li> First off I LOVE the smell of this stuff, and secondly it feels so good putting it on my skin. I love how it feels and I love the consistency of it. This stuff helped in clearing my acne, but I would only use it once a week since the bottle is so small... a little bit goes a long way though. It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling dry or right afterwards, but feeling refreshed. I would definitely buy this product again!</li>
    <li> This has dead sea mud (clay?) and lycopene in it, which are supposed to clear your skin. I like this mask, as it definitely smooths my skin (the clay is slightly exfoliating) and the smell is quite nice, but I don&#x27;t think it really clears my skin. At least, I&#x27;ve been using it a couple of times a week along my jawline and T-zone, both places I have acne that I&#x27;m trying to clear...and it&#x27;s not clear yet. I&#x27;ve been using this for several weeks, semi-regularly, now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use a salicylic acid spot treatment, which I see results with after use. So - if you want smooth skin (no dry flakes or anything) use this. If it happens to work to clear your skin, good for you! I&#x27;m happy for you. It just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> The first couple of times I used this mask it wasn&#x27;t a remarkable experience, but I just used it for the third time and my skin is red and irritated. I&#x27;ve moisturized twice and it is helping a little, but I will not buy this product again. My acne isn&#x27;t that bad, I&#x27;ll just live with it rather than the red puffiness I&#x27;m rocking now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never written a review but I find them very helpful when purchasing face products especially acne healing products. I&#x27;ve suffered from acne since I was 13 years old. I&#x27;ve used everything on the block down to peels nothing has worked...until I can across this product after 1 use I saw instant results I had a cystic bump those hard red ones on my face for 2 days I put the mask on and left it on for 30 mins.....it was gone when I washed my face!!! That&#x27;s why I writing because I feel like this worked instantly. I can&#x27;t wait to see what it does by next month I will write a follow up review!!! I&#x27;ve also used the stick and that works but not as fast but you&#x27;ll definitlynseevavreduction in size and color in 2-3 days!!! I&#x27;m a believer of the Yes products!!!</li>
    <li> Who would have thought tomatoes. I like this product.  It makes my skin so soft. I would recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> I thought maybe it was a coincidence when my pimples were gone the next day until my room mate used it and it worked for her too. When I feel I&#x27;m getting under the surface pimples (big, red, painful, can&#x27;t be popped and scar) I use this and sometimes they are gone as soon as the next day. The only other product I ever found that worked this well was pretty expensive and got discontinued. When I use it a couple times a week I don&#x27;t break out much at all. A lot of people don&#x27;t realize most of the products they use are too harsh and actually can help cause breakouts. (Sulfates shouldn&#x27;t be used on your skin or hair at all) This line is clean and gentle on your skin. And very inexpensive considering!</li>
    <li> I love the smell, it feels wonderful on, and it absorbs oil without drying my face out. When I wash it off, it feels like I&#x27;ve already put moisturizer on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The container is fairly small, but a little goes a long way. I&#x27;ll definitely continue to buy this product.</li>
    <li> I used this product and upon taking it off noticed that my skin was bright red and sensitive. Maybe I&#x27;m allergic but I personally will not be using this specific kind again.</li>
    <li> This mask really works if you have oily or acne prone skin and is great for clearing up patches of dry skin too.  Don&#x27;t know what my face would do without this at least once a month!</li>
    <li> I would definitely recommend this product. I apply the face masque once a week for extra help with clearing up my skin. It smells great, and it feels great that it is naturally derived ingredients.</li>
    <li> This is a great product all natural works great feels awesome on skin. My face was so soft after using and a little lasts a long way.</li>
    <li> I never had breakouts then around 21 years old I got major acne! I&#x27;ve tried everything from cheap stuff to pro active! Nothing worked until I started the yes to tomatoes line!! AMAZING STUFF!! My face is so clear now!! Mose def worth the try! I use the Mask, Repairing Lotion, and Spot Stick!</li>
    <li> Best mask ever!  It lasts a while too.  I use it about 2 times week and a jar can last me around 5 or 6 months.  It definitely clears up skin around your breakout areas and neck.  Definitely will buy again.</li>
    <li> My favorite mask.  I bought the sample size at Target, but they no longer carry the tub.  It feels sort of like a clay mask, drying very tight.  I like to put it on 10-15 min before I shower.  It does great at pulling dirt out of your pores, but it doesn&#x27;t exfoliate.  The Neutrogena Benzoyl Peroxide cleanser/mask is the best I&#x27;ve found, but it is so harsh it always leaves my skin red for hours afterwards and requires pampering with lots of moisturizer.  Yes to Tomatoes causes my face to flush for maybe half an hour tops and my regular moisturizer is enough.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it is in a tub--not as hygienic.  I will repurchase when I run out (not likely to be soon).</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think this did anything. It doesn&#x27;t go on right and the jar dried up after a while.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use this with other products from the line, such as the full three step, but I do use this when I feel a breakout coming on along with the tomato skin wipes. The smell isn&#x27;t too great, but this mask is wonderful for diminishing acne even before it begins to form a head! My only complaint is that I wish the jar was bigger. The picture gives the impression that it&#x27;s a much wider pot, but it&#x27;s actually quite small and much like the size of Clinique containers.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle of the Yes To Tomatoes Skin Clearing Mask.  It&#x27;s been a pleasant experience.  I use it twice a week ( I leave it on for 30 - 45 minutes) and I notice the difference right after using it.  It brightens up my skin and helps heal acne and blemish.  There is definitely improvement on my acne-prone skin.  I still have acne here and there especially during the menstrual cycle but with the help of Yes To Tomato mask, the problem is not as severe.  It is one of the best facial masks that I&#x27;ve used in the recent year and I&#x27;ve used a lot masks. And one thing that I absolutely like about this product is that it&#x27;s not super expensive.  So no harm to give it a shot!!</li>
    <li> This product works really well. I feel like it is sucking all the grossness out of my skin. I use it after I workout or go for a swim to deal with the dirt, sweat and gunk. I didn&#x27;t believe products like this existed: it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin it just makes it look better. But I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for severe acne.</li>
    <li> This is my first time i&#x27;ve purchased Yes to Tomatoes! products, and oh my goodness I am in love! I like the fact that they are very natural-like, and work pretty fast, like you can see results almost instantly (1 day). I use this mask like once every 2 weeks, and my face feels great, it does not make my skin dry or break-out, it leaves it with a very soft feeling. I do wish it was a bigger bottle because they are a little pricey but, I mean, you don&#x27;t need to use a lot of product to get great results. So, if you are looking for an amazing clearing facial mask, this is the one!</li>
    <li> I do like this mask but I&#x27;m not 100 percent convinced it is clearing my face up. I want to say it is helping but I can&#x27;t be sure. It seems like it helps sometimes and other times it doesn&#x27;t seem to help. Third time using this product, still undecided. Might try something else next time.</li>
    <li> As other reviewers have pointed out, this comes in a very small jar. That said, it doesn&#x27;t take much of the product to cover your face. I did find, though, that I had to work fairly quickly to cover the entirety of my face since the product starts to dry soon after application and, therefore, becomes difficult/impossible to spread, requiring you to then use more of the product. Next time, I shall move a little more swiftly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the smell of the mask--it has a mild, natural scent, not unlike a scent one might encounter when getting a facial at a spa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I felt mild tingling on my cheeks as the product dried completely, but it was not an uncomfortable feeling. When I removed the product with a damp cloth, I did notice that my cheeks were red and still a bit tingly but it was not in the least concerning. The redness and the tingly feeling subsided completely after a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The result of just one use of this product was rather astounding. I have large pores on my cheeks and they were noticeably smaller after just one use of the mask. Call me impressed! I use the Acure Organics product line (cleanser, moisturizer, toner, night cream, etc.) and although the line works rather well and I highly recommend it, it took weeks for me to notice any visible improvement to my skin&#x27;s problem areas. For the Yes to Skin Clearing mask to work so noticeably well after only one application is just phenomenal indeed.</li>
    <li> wife happy with it. will buy more</li>
    <li> really really gentle and effective. if your skin is sensitive like mine this facial mask is perfect for you. smells nice too</li>
