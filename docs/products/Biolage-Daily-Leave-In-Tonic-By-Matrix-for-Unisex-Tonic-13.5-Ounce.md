      <li>It makes my hair feel soft and not greasy.</li>
      <li>Unfortunately does not smell good.</li>
      <li>so I used this spray to calm my hair down in the morning</li>
      <li>Apparently they changed the formula.</li>
      <li>I think the product had been sitting clear in the back of storage for years and just recently found.  </li>
      <li>The product is light and moisturing and creates softness without weighing hair down or making it stiff or sticky.</li>

    <li> The product is light and moisturing and creates softness without weighing hair down or making it stiff or sticky. What&#x27;s more I had a very gratifying experience dealing with Pharmapacks, the retailer, when the pump on the bottle would not work. After trying their suggestion (shake bottle), I informed them that it still wouldn&#x27;t spray out and was told to keep the bottle and they would send out another one pronto. They apologized for my inconvenience. Kudos to them. And I can still pour the first one out out in my hand and use it that way :-)</li>
    <li> This product work great for de-tangling my long hair after it is washed.  Makes for an easy comb through without weighing down fine, straight hair.</li>
    <li> Great product. Hard to find in stores now!</li>
    <li> Great value.  Cheaper than stores!</li>
    <li> This product arrived on time and I love it!</li>
    <li> Very disappointed with this product from this company. The bottle appeared old and dirty, as if it was reuse. I question if the product inside is what I actuallyordered.  I had another bottle and compared the look and smell, which seemed different. I don&#x27;t know if the product is so old the chemicals have broken down or if it simply was a false product in the bottle. I can&#x27;t believe this company looked at the bittle and thought it would be a good idea to send it. I think the product had been sitting clear in the back of storage for years and just recently found.  You wouldn&#x27;t display a bottle like that on a store shelf, so why would you think it&#x27;s ok to mail to a customer. I will never waste my money again with this company again.</li>
    <li> Apparently they changed the formula. Does not detangle and soften as it used to. Would not buy again. Need to find a better leave-in conditioner.</li>
    <li> This has been a good old go to for the past 20 years I haven&#x27;t really found a better leave in conditioner. I find it hilarious that&#x27;s some users say it smells like vagina, because this product smells really good, whereas vagina, not so much.</li>
    <li> Works great for curly, frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> The product I received is still the daily leave in tonic, but is in a different bottle than pictured, and has a different scent than the previous bottle I used (I assume a different scent for the different packaging). It would have been nice to know, but still does a great job.</li>
    <li> Great for hair that tangles easy. I can get a brush through my hair when it is wet. I also spray it on my hair to protect it before a day at the beach and before swimming.</li>
    <li> This conditioner smells horrible!!! ( It smells like you know what).I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the price. I have tried other biolage hair products before, which I&#x27;m very satisfied about, but this one is very disappointing!</li>
    <li> Great product, Good price. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Good for untangling my hair without being weighty.</li>
    <li> Same product (size and ingredients, obviously) that you find in stores (if you can find it, that is.)  I&#x27;ve had a lot of difficulty locating this Matrix product in stores, but the other Matrix and Biolage products, like shampoos, conditioners, and styling products are virtually everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;When I do find this product, I end up paying around $18-$20 at the store.&lt;br /&gt;  Not here!  Thanks for the savings!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately does not smell good. The one I bought at the salon a couple of years ago smelled really great.  This one is just not a pleasing smell and I can&#x27;t figure out why. I love this line of products, though, usually</li>
    <li> Great product for lake/pool hair.  I keep this stuff in my beach bag because it untagles and once dry, leaves your hair non freezy</li>
    <li> The product works well as a leave in conditioner, but I was a bit disappointed that it didn&#x27;t smell better. It doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell and I had hoped it smelled similar to other Biolage products. Works for long hair after showering to detangle and prepare for brushing.</li>
    <li> Leaves your hair nice and soft. Makes my hair curly instead of frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to everyone who needs a little love and care for their locks.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product have used it for roughly twenty years and it works the best for my liking.</li>
    <li> Great leave in strengthener for the hair. Helped repair my color damaged, limp hair strands. Also adds body and bounce.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many products to de-tangle my fine hair.  This is the only one that works.  It is fantastic and smells great!</li>

    <li> Love this product.  It makes my hair feel soft and not greasy.</li>
    <li> Wonderful customer service. Smell of product is unpleasant.</li>
    <li> I have short, platinum hair and was looking for something to add additional moisture to my hair (beyond conditioner in the shower).  This works well.  I try to go a few days without washing so I used this spray to calm my hair down in the morning so I can style it for the day.  It works well with my flat iron and my hair feels good.  I use this with Keratin Complex by Coppola Infusion Keratin and Pravana Shine Serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the reviews commenting that this doesn&#x27;t smell right.  I would have to disagree.  Perhaps it is the seller they are purchasing through.  I bought mine at a Beauty Supply Store for Beauticians (need license) and it smells fresh and quite lovely, AND the smell dissipates.  Win. Win.</li>
    <li> This is Very Good , I think It does what it saids</li>
