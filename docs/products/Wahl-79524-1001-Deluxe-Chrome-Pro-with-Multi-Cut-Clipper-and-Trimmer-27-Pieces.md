<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> We got this four years ago in 2011 and it is still working like new in 2015. My wife had never cut anyone&#x27;s hair before but quickly got the hang of it with this kit. We have saved at least several hundred dollars since getting. My only regret is that we did not get it sooner.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this purchase.  After 2 haircuts - the wife took a little long with the first - but is now quite proficient - the clipper has paid for itself.</li>
    <li> I have used a small wahl bullet trimmer for years to give haircuts. My new full size clipper does not do as a good a job. I was dissappointed. I have tried adjusting, but it just doesn&#x27;t seem to cut very well.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this trimmer!!  It failed on me the second I used it to cut my son&#x27;s hair.  I had an old one purchased from [...] and it worked well for many many years until it died this year.  I purchased this product because its good review here. It worked well the first time. The second time I used it about a month later , there was low noise from the motor, and it failed to cut any hair.   I was really disappointed about the low quality of this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this Wahl 79524-1001 Deluxe Chrome Pro for the express purpose of saving money on hair cuts. Even a simple cut and trim job nowadays runs about twenty bucks. So I figured if I could cut my own hair they would pay for themselves after the first two uses. This is an awesome set, with plenty of cutting attachments, accessories, and the highly useful little battery-operated trimmer. The only negative thing I could add is that the Wahl trimmer itself is not made out of metal but plastic, although this doesn&#x27;t detract from my overall satisfaction. It is a very hefty and solid piece of machinery and handles cutting hair very well. I love the fact that you can adjust the cutting edge by simply flipping the thumb-lever on the side of the trimmer. This comes in handy when you&#x27;re cutting your hair and want to adjust the depth of the cut on the fly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will suggest that you take your time getting familiar with the trimmer and the many attachments, because it does take a bit of practice-and-error to get cutting your hair down to a science. For me it was no biggie since I shaved my head the first time I used it and have been keeping my hair short since then (utilizing the different length guide combs included). Each straight guide comb comes with a number stamped on the attachment itself which designates their cutting depth - they range from 1 through 8. There are other guides for specific tasks; left and right ear taper, eyebrow trimmer, and ear trim guide. The included accessories are nice - a pair of shears, a mirror, a water spray bottle, two hair clips, small bottle of oil, and trimmer cleaning brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me the greatest accessory is the small battery-operated trimmer. This has come in handy for so many hair cutting tasks that I sometimes find myself using it more than the main trimmer (you can even trim your mustache and beard with it!). Overall I am extremely pleased with this purchase and if you want to save yourself some money on hair cuts I would recommend the Wahl 79524-1001 Deluxe Chrome Pro to anyone.the Wahl 79524-1001 Deluxe Chrome Pro to anyone.</li>
    <li> This was my second purchase from Amazon.com.  It, too, was a wedding shower gift for my nephew.  I was so excited that it arrived before the wedding; after reading it was on backorder.  He loved it!  And of course, used it right away to look his best for his bride!</li>
    <li> What can I say? It is VERY quiet. Works very nice. Had more attachments then you will ever need. Comes with oil, brush to clean it, mirror, cape, etc. If the price works for you, this is more than just child&#x27;s play. This is a serious machine and is the same one used in many barber shops!</li>
    <li> Great unit, been using it for two years now no problems.</li>
    <li> I cut my hair with this set last week. came out perfect!. ran a number 2 across the top and adjusted the blade for a fade on the sides and came out just like it would at the barber shop. cutting the back is hard at first but just get a decent sized mirror to look at the back. I also have the Andis styliner II for my shape up and clean it up with a straight blade razor. Now that i cut my own hair and comes out perfectly, im going to save a load of money by not having to pay at the barber shop.</li>
    <li> I love the Multi-Cut Clipper, but the trimmer never worked which was really disappointing because trimming is an intrical part to giving a good hair cut.  I requested a replacement for the trimmer, but was told I would have to mail and return the entire kit which was really most inconvenient. They didn&#x27;t offer me any other options, and I need the clipper and attachments weekly, so the returning and waiting for a new kit to be sent was not something I could do.  I would have to say that I&#x27;m NOT satisfied with this purchase and will not buy from them again.  Further, this is the first time I&#x27;ve ordered anything from Amazon that didn&#x27;t work or arrived damaged.  Makes me a little reluctant to order from Amazon again.  Wish I would have just bought a set of clippers at Target.  Vicki Carlin  Spring Green, WI</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had probably 3 or 4 other clippers in my life and this one ranks up there with the best.  I&#x27;ve had it for a couple of months and so far it&#x27;s worked well.  Cuts very well without pulling hair.  The only issue that I&#x27;ve had with it is that sometimes when using the short attachments, it&#x27;s difficult to blend hair (make a nice, even transition from shorter to longer hair).  Maybe I&#x27;m just not used to using this one yet, who knows?  But all in all, it&#x27;s done a good job.</li>
    <li> I am quite happy with the Wahl hair cutting clipper..the only thing I would have like a guide that would cut the hair a little longer as I am a female that because of health reasons cannot go to the beauty shop..the longest cutting guide is a bit shorter than I would have preferred my hair to be.</li>
    <li> muy buen producto pero lo que no me gusto es la capa que trae que es de muy mala calidad lo cual hace que no se vea nada bien en comparacion al resto de articulos que tare el estuche</li>
    <li> I recently started cutting my own hair (whats left of it) and opted normally for the \\&quot;cheapest\\&quot; wal-mart special set of clippers.  So when I saw these so cheap on Amazon and the Wal-Mart website I was a little skeptical that they could be anything more than what I was used to using.  WOW was I amazed at the quality of a sub $30 set of hair clippers!  These feel exactly like being at a barber, super fast smooth cut with no snags or hiccups.  They were aligned and oiled right out of the box and were cutting my hair within 10 minutes of unboxing.  What used to be a dreadful 20 minute \\&quot;buzz\\&quot; cut is now a 5 minute walk in the park.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cannot comment on longevity due to only owning this set for 2 months however for the price, they paid for themselves during the first cut!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comes with a boatload of good quality accessories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall 5 star product at an unreal price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t hesitate!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUY IT NOW!</li>
    <li> Has just about every accessory you can think of; combs, clips, guards, cape, scissors, etc.  The small personal groomer works just as well as the full size clippers.  I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Made in USA!!!   I used the razor to cut my hair and it did the job with ease and fast!</li>
    <li> This is a great deal of a quality set of trimmers for the money you pay. In the nice, pocketed carrying case, there are two professional quality trimmers and every clip you could ever need. Everything is very sturdy, the trimmers are quiet, and the carrying case fits everything very easily and snugly. I recommend buying this package for anyone from college student to professional.</li>
    <li> it looks like a toy. bad finishing, mostly were the covers meet. also, it can&#x27;t be used were 140/230v electricity is used.</li>
    <li> 1 of Wahl 79524-1001 Deluxe Chrome Pro with Multi-Cut Clipper &amp; Trimmer, 27 Pieces  Sold by: Amazon.com LLC  Reason for return: Missing parts or accessories  Details: this order arrived incomplete to my place i openend the box today and just came clipper but did not arrived the mini clipper (Trimmer)please send miss itemResolution:</li>
    <li> I have used this product twice since purchasing and it works well. The many attachments make the job easy and comfortable. I would recommend the Wahl as a good value product.</li>
    <li> The Wahl is absolutely perfect. It&#x27;s smooth, quiet, and efficient.     I&#x27;ve been giving myself haircuts for years using other products (like conair clippers) the other ones are just garbage. Some people have said you can just buy the $10 ones and get the same result, there is absolutely no merit to that judgement.    The guides clip on easily and stay on. They are nice and firm and do not bend (up to the number 8, I&#x27;ve heard the 10 and 12 will bend, but I do not own them.)     Yes, the mirror it comes with is small but you should be giving haircuts in front of a full wall mirror anyway. Bigger handheld mirrors can be purchased at pharmacies for less than $5. It also comes with multiple combs of different sizes and flexibility, which is nice.     And the mini clippers are great for trim and getting around the ears. I even use it to shape my beard.    I do have to be careful that when I give myself a cut, sometimes my thumb will accidentally shift the lever that adjusts the length (only by 1/8th of an inch, but it&#x27;s noticeable). Something to be careful with when using.    If I have one complaint its that the case it comes with is hard to keep organized, I usually just toss everything in after I&#x27;m done. This usually means I have to spend a hot minute looking for the right size guide before I start. Even if you use the pockets everything will shift around when you move it.    My brother also uses these clippers and he&#x27;s had his for years and he has never had any mechanical issues with it, and are just as quiet and smooth as a new one.</li>
    <li> I have been using these clippers regularly for the past two years and could not be any happier with the quality and price.  It is worth investing in a good set, and I was happy to see that these are made in the U.S., unlike Wahl&#x27;s competitors and some its lower end models.  The bag is acceptable, though there does not seem to be any good way to hold the variety of accessories that come with it.  The mirror is a bit too small to be useful, but I bought this set for the clipper and other items and can get another mirror at the store for a few bucks.  All in all, I would purchase this same set again and highly recommend it for folks that want to save time and money on going to the barber.</li>
    <li> Pros: I use the #1 attachment to close-crop my hair and it&#x27;s easy to do.  Comes out looking great with minimal amount of time plus saves me the twenty bucks a month I would&#x27;ve had to pay for the same outcome.  Quick, effective, and has already paid for itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Loud.  That&#x27;s all I can think of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was delivered right away and have used this appliance for the past ten months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  The small trimmer stopped working soon after this review.  The clippers are still going strong.</li>
    <li> I would recommended this to anyone who wants to cut their own hair. Worked better than I ever thought it would.  Price of two hair cuts and it has paid for itself. Good quality and worth the money.</li>
    <li> I just opened it and went through everything. It feels nice and heavy. I tested it out and it is very sharp...looking foward to having it a long time!!</li>
    <li> Overall, my husband is very satisfied with this product.  He said , it doesn&#x27;t cut as low as he would like it to, but it gets the job done and it&#x27;s not as noisey as the last clippers we brought.  That one was a disaster.</li>
    <li> The first thing I noticed was the weight. It feels well built. The second thing I noticed was Made in USA. Happy surprise. So far it works perfectly.</li>
    <li> my last set of shears is by wahl and i bought that one in 1995 or so. its 2012 and i&#x27;ve just now replaced that one [using the old one as a back-up if i need to]. i presume this one will give me just many years or more of good service.  lots of attachments; and an ear-trim...which is an upgrade for me and will come in quite handy as it was always hard for me to do this free-hand.</li>
    <li> Got my kit and used it once.  Works well.  There were two missing pieces in the kit.  I called Wahl, and they sent the pieces to me right away.</li>
    <li> Really useful device. Also, you can buy cheaper one since there is not many differences between this model and cheaper one.</li>
    <li> I read the 200 5 star reviews and bought it only to find out that the best thing about this product was the Free shipping. First of all, it is LOUD. When I say loud, I mean, imagine a jet fighter flying over your house (I know because they do) and then think that in your dang ear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cutter has managed to do several things: 1.not cut my hair, cause my ears to ring, piss off my wife, give me a bad haircut, waste $35, and make me irritated that I&#x27;ve got to look for another cutter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take my word for it, don&#x27;t buy this. I am an avid Amazon shopper and I buy things based on reviews and people tend to give better reviews than they should for products that don&#x27;t par up. I am not that person. The kit is nice but the main clipper is an oversized, hard to use, extremely loud vibrating paper weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t get what I paid for. I paid for a cheap clipper kit and what I got was a clipper kit without a clipper in a very nice package!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;Although I did not take advantage of the offer, I just read that Wahl offered me a full refund/replacement based on my poor review. I&#x27;m sure that higher end Wahl products are good and perhaps it is the voltage difference that had caused my problems (Japan has 100v vs. 110). Either way, I bought a different brand cheap-o and it works fine. I raised the stars because I find it very cool that a company would try to fix bad experiences based on a poor product review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 12-13-2013&lt;br /&gt;I felt bad for giving this product a bad review. To be honest, I still use the clipper kit accessories for cutting with my other $20 Con-air clipper unit. It might just be that I got a bad unit but it is likely that the other units are fine. For the price, you can&#x27;t beat it. Plus even though I don&#x27;t use the main clipper, I do find the battery operated mini clipper quite nice.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for months to shave my head and keep my beard trimmed really close to my face. You have everything you could possibly need for shaving, trimming, and cutting here. Great package for a good price.</li>
    <li> I bought this set about 2 years ago hearing that the Wahl brand was the best.  My mom had a set of Wahl clippers that lasted over 20 years.  Apparently quality has gone downhill.  Here are a list of the pros/cons for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;- Comes with a lot of attachments&lt;br /&gt;- Really liked the combs for trimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Trimmer extremely poor quality - works on batteries but never kept at the same speed.  Even with a fresh battery it would speed up and slow down to the point of not trimming at all.  We threw it away within a month&lt;br /&gt;- The scissors are as sharp as children&#x27;s craft scissors.  Tried them once and went and bought real hair cutting scissors.&lt;br /&gt;- The clipper was ok for the first year and a half.  Nothing amazing but it worked.  Died on me yesterday after only 2 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the clippers died on me yesterday I borrowed a friends Andis and was stunned at the difference.  I didn&#x27;t realize how bad the Wahl was until I tried these.  I thought that having to run the clippers over the hair multiple times was normal.  Apparently it isn&#x27;t.  My kids haircuts were done in less than half the time and looked so much better.  The trimmer is heavy duty and cut perfectly.  It didn&#x27;t tickle my kids as much either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I realize that the Andis is a lot more expensive but I figure I save that amount by not having to take the kids to the hair dresser every couple months and it&#x27;s cheaper than buying a new wahl every two years.</li>
    <li> This is a really great product.  My husband can now cut his own hair and we save so much on the monthly barbershop bills</li>
    <li> The very day there clippers arrived, I used them. Very easy to use, no hair tugging, no pain, just clean hair cut. Fantastic and money saving. Thank you</li>
    <li> I bought this to use on my dog to save on having him clipped professionally. It did the job, but it definitely isn&#x27;t good for precise clipping. It is also very heavy, so my arm got fatigued rather fast. My last gripe is that doesn&#x27;t feed very fast, and I had to continually pull it out of his fur and remove the build up of fur from the blades. This might work fine for human hair, but I can&#x27;t recommend this for use on an animal. Additionally, the second, smaller trimmer broke after one use.    If you can afford it, go with Oster. I should have.</li>
    <li> Bought these clippers to stop going to the barbershop.  They have already paid for themselves.  Great cut, not loud, even works on my 2 year old son.</li>
    <li> The product works fine but Amazon should be more upfront with the fact that you may be receiving a used or refurbished product. I took my clipper out of the bag and noticed that there were short bits of hair all over the blades. This doesn&#x27;t affect the quality of the product but obviously someone had used it before me and the sight was a little gross, especially when you paid for a new item.</li>
    <li> I first got this clipper a few months ago from amazon.  It worked great the first time, but the second time I tried to use it, it made a terribly loud noise, really rendering it unusable.  I went for a few months without a clipper before getting one at Target yesterday. But I accidentally got the same make and model, and guess the results? Even worse! I turned it on, and after a few short seconds, the clipper made that same terrible noise and then actually sputtered out and died.  I&#x27;m returning it tomorrow.    Don&#x27;t get this clipper!</li>
    <li> not much to say, nice product. fast shipping, good price. works like it should, with plenty of options.</li>
    <li> Excelente equipo para el corte de cabello y uso para la barberia o peluqueria, lo recomiendo 100 por ciento a todos</li>
    <li> I first saw this in Kohl&#x27;s for lot more $$$$. I&#x27;ve used Wahl products in the past.   The clipper is VERY good using. Fits contour of hand, easy to manuever.  I&#x27;ve had my hair trimmed using Oster products and THIS Wahl does same job, for a lot less money.  The 27 piece accessory kit is filled with useful items. I haven&#x27;t used the trimmer yet.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my husband and he loves it!!!  He has already used it and this will save us money down the road since he can cut his own hair.</li>
    <li> When I recieved it, it was used by somebody before me.  Please careful when you buy these items.</li>
    <li> I received these clippers in the mail, opened the box and had cut my husband&#x27;s hair, (very professionally looking, I might add) in less than 30 minutes. Now that I&#x27;ve done it, I feel confident that I can do it in about 10 minutes. And the time and money we&#x27;ll save is a great thought. We&#x27;re very busy and now I can cut his hair at home whenever we have a chance and it&#x27;ll save at least $20 per month. So the product will be paid for next time (the second time) I cut his hair. Thanks Wahl for a great, American Made!, easy-to-use product.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something with which I could cut my own hair, and this fit the bill perfectly. The small trimmer is a great addition, and the attachments are super useful. The nylon bag is a little flimsy, but it doesn&#x27;t diminish the overall value of this product.</li>
    <li> I would recomend this product to anybody. Although the tiny trimmer is a little weak, the clipper definately makes up for it. This is a great deal and everything works great!</li>
    <li> Everything is great. The wahl performes flawlessly... except for the little one. That tiny trimmer is practically junk. Don&#x27;t try trimming the back of your head below the main cut cuz that little motor just can&#x27;t hande it. If i could redo my purchase, i would buy the chrome kit without the tiny trimmer. I thought it might have been the single AA battery inside, but i replaced it, and still- its just the little engine that never could. Stick with a Wahl, just not this package. Your paying 20 bucks for the tiny trimmer anyway.</li>
    <li> I received the hair trimmer and almost immediately did my first haircut with it. Because of the very useful attachments and ease of use, I was able to do most of it by myself. My second haircut a couple of weeks later almost paid for the product. It has performed up to my expectations and I will probably never have another $15+ haircut. The Wahl Pro Kit will have saved its purchase price about halfway through my next cut.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s alright.  It feels good in the hand.  The blades it comes with don&#x27;t get as close of a cut as others I have had.  My kid dropped it on the tile floor and there was no damage.</li>
    <li> so far so good.works alot better than previous models..always had a problem with the power cords shorting out..we will see how this one does</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research before buying this hair clipper &amp; trimmer. I absolutely love the clipper but the trimmer has a funky on/off switch and nothing like the old trimmers where the rocker type switch was very solid and built well. This new trimmer needs to be improved some but all in all a fantastic set, especially for the money. Wahl is probably one of the top clippers you can buy.</li>
    <li> We have been very pleased indeed. I say we, because I cut my husband&#x27;s, as well as my 3 son&#x27;s hair with these things. I get done so much quicker than with my old set, and it doesn&#x27;t jerk their hair because it can&#x27;t handle the job, like my old clippers did. Now, my guys line up happily, to get their relaxing haircut. I would definitely recommend that people continue to purchase these. Wahl has really come thru. I would like a roomier container with hard sides but, all in all, I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> The clippers work great and they come with everything you need to get started using them. Thank you!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cape is a bit flimsy but other than that, the set works well to get you all the basics if you want to start cutting hair at home.</li>
    <li> It was definitely used before. Has a cheap feeling to it. The portable trimmer broke after first use. The electric trimmer works well though.</li>
    <li> I bought this one and have used twice, so far so good. Definitely recommend to others.</li>
    <li> You should buy this clipper, the price is non expensive,the quality is really good, for home and beginners, this is a great choice.     The service with amazon.com is an experience that you should try. BUY IT!, BUY IT.</li>
    <li> This Wahl Clipper set is a good product for the money.  I have been using Wahl for many years and they make a great product.  I will continue to use Wahl products in the future.  This set was well worth it.  It arrived to my house 3 days earlier than originally stated.  Product was packed well and shipped properly.  Comes with a lot of attachments and extras.  Although the mini clipper did not meet my expectations, I still like this clipper set.  I do wish the clipper set came in a hard shell case as opposed to a fabric one.  But, I thankfully saved the old hard shell case from my old Wahl clipper set and the new one fits in there real nice.  And another nice little tid-bit...the attachments from my old Wahl clipper set fits this NEW Wahl clipper set with no problems.</li>
    <li> These hair clippers are really nice, they have multiple hair cutting guides. The instructions for using this product is very easy to understand. The kit is very compact and comes with a really nice zippered pouch for travel purposes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not really good at writing reviews,so I&#x27;m going to keep it short.. First i take the trimmer out of the plastic bag,i put in a battery.. so far so good.. Oh wait.. 20 sec later it stops working  note that the batteries were brand new so there&#x27;s no way that could be the problem,the trimmer just simply stopped working ,no power at all.so i say to myself ugh well at least i have the clippers right?WRONG,i began using the clippers and this time 4 minutes later the blade falls apart.a screw driver took care of it the first time but then it continues to fall apart...even after adjusting the power to it&#x27;s lowest setting, i don&#x27;t know but it looks like im going to need a power drill to keep this thing together. anyways overall it wasn&#x27;t worth the nearly 50$ in my case(so much for keeping it short) But beware of this product.It&#x27;s better to be safe then sorry i guess</li>
    <li> even with the proper transformer it made a lot of noise and i called the comp. and they said it needs to be used in 50hz not 60hz or s/t like that....but looks like a nice set</li>
    <li> Really good set of trimmers, Wahl is the only way to go.  Almost $20 cheaper than Wal-Mart.  WE actually purchased it there first and I found it cheaper online, so we took it back. I just love getting a deal!</li>
    <li> blades were not properly aligned upon first use. the side blade adjustment did not work properly. i&#x27;ve used wahl clippers for many years and this one is one of the worst. my favorite clipper was the multi-colored one that had a different color for each clip size. never used the included trimmer.</li>
    <li> This is the second set of this clipper set I have purchased.  The first is still going great after three years and the second will be a gift.  I keep my hair short and this set is perfect for doing it myself.</li>
    <li> Clippers have been wonderful.  Cutting hair without making appointments and then  saving money too.  The purchase has already been paid for and now another set for college will be coming.  College students hair gets long but being able to keep up with cut is fantastic. Summer made the adjustment to short hair that much easier.  Recommend getting oil asap with item as this is absolutely necessary for future</li>
    <li> My wife started giving my family haircuts to save the hassle of finding time on the weekends for a trek to the barber shop.  We settled on this set and we love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: 1) The Clippers are professional quality.  They feel sturdy and well built.&lt;br /&gt;  2) It comes with a myriad of attachments, but you won&#x27;t use most of them unless&lt;br /&gt;  you cut your hair really short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: 1) You have to buy longer attachments like [[ASIN:B000FL6HEC Wahl Clipper Attachments #12 And #10 Guide Combs]]&lt;br /&gt;  if you want your haircuts not so short.&lt;br /&gt;  2) The scissors in this set aren&#x27;t great.  You&#x27;ll find yourself looking for another pair in the future&lt;br /&gt;  if you use scissors a lot on your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a great set with a fantastic clipper, which after all, is really what you&#x27;re paying for here.  You&#x27;ll add attachments and possibly better scissors as the needs arise, but with a convenient carrying case, this is definitely the set to start out with.</li>
    <li> I bought this product and 4 days later I was given an email saying it was backordered and the site should not have had the clippers up for sale on amazon. I went back to the site days later and it was still up there for sale not saying anything about the backorder. They need to stay on top of what they have posted and fix it instead of making me wait days before saying they could not get the product for me</li>
    <li> The Wahl Clipper we ordered came in a very timely manner.  It was everything we wanted and are pleased with the quality, cost, and the number of attachments that are part of the set.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> The big clippers are sturdy as you would expect and do a good job, the little battery powered S-clipper however is about the same quality you would expect to buy at the dollar store.  I can&#x27;t believe Wahl put their name on this piece of junk.  It slows and even comes to a stop depending on you hold it.  Maybe buy the Wahl clippers but avoid the S-clippers if you can.</li>
    <li> Very sturdy.  Has a great feel to it.  And after a few uses....it would have paid for itself.</li>
    <li> Great price for the 27 piece set. Comes with everything you need. Trimmer is solid and doesn&#x27;t feel cheap. Should last quite some time as long as I take care of it. Would definitely recommend this to others.</li>
    <li> I bought the 24 piece kit of this same trimmer model at [...] for about $27, including shipping. So far they work very well. I have extremely fine and thick hair and these clippers cut right through it without a problem. I use the #8 on the crown, the #6 for the middle and the #4 for the sides (blending the sections in with the taper tool and \\&quot;rocking it out\\&quot;), and the #1 to clean up the back and around the ears (I never bother with the ear tapers) in addition to just the bare razor to round it off on the neck.  When I&#x27;m done doing all of that I wet my hair and whip out the scissors to finish the top with a nice point-cutting (taking out a few mm chunks off of the hair using your fingers to not cut it too far down and in at a very slight angle) to give it some attitude and dimension because it just looks wrong all precisely one length on the longer cuts, you NEED to do this to not make it look like you did it yourself - trust me, my former stylist did this every time and it truly does make a difference.  I can&#x27;t comment on the other guide combs or accessories because I haven&#x27;t used them yet. However, the guide combs do NOT fit snugly over the clipper and this is why they are reportedly \\&quot;loud\\&quot; and rattle. It&#x27;s not a huge deal, but does merit knocking off 1 Star as they should fit the clippers properly and this might also be why some people report the guides bowing and breaking if not handled with utmost care during their use. And that is the second reason I have taken a star off, because the guides are pretty flimsy and most likely will break at some point if handled roughly. But, for $10 or so you can replace the lot of them - not such a big deal.  On the other hand, I&#x27;m disappointed that the #10 and the #12 guide combs are not included in the higher priced kits as they only cost Wahl approximately 25 cents to make and SHOULD be included, if only as a courtesy to the ladies. It costs almost $20 with the shipping to order them from Wahl&#x27;s site, and just as much if not more elsewhere (shipping is way more expensive than the items and is almost not worth it).  They also only supply you with a tiny little bottle of clipper oil that most likely won&#x27;t last you more than 3 months of cutting your hair every 1 - 2 weeks, as you do with shorter cuts like what this provides. As far as I can tell it&#x27;s just your standard mineral oil that you can pick up a huge bottle of at any grocery store or pharmacy for just $1, but which Wahl wants to sell to you at $5 for just a few ounces!  Overall this is a fine economy haircut kit that can save you hundreds of dollars a year and pays for itself in three to five uses, depending on what you paid for it. Just don&#x27;t buy this (or any other clipper kit) and expect to be able to do it just like the pros. It takes a lot of practice to get it just right and also to get to the point of being able to do the fancy stuff! Be prepared for your haircuts to suck for a while when you start doing it yourself, especially the back.  __________________________________  2/12/2012: I would just like to report that these clippers are still working just fine and all of the guide combs are intact after dozens and dozens and dozens of uses. The clipper itself is just about ready for a servicing (removing the blade to clean the little trapped hairs out). And I have started using the mineral oil with them without any problems so don&#x27;t go wasting your money on the asininely expensive &#x27;wahl clipper oil&#x27; that comes in a miniscule dropper.  You&#x27;ll know when you need to apply some of that oil to them when they start pulling at your hairs a bit (and every clipper will do that if they get dry; no matter what you paid for them).  Happy cutting!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t had this long enough to know if it&#x27;s going to last but we&#x27;re very happy with the product and all the accessories that come with it, especially for the price - the additional battery-operated trimmer is great! We have three guys who use this regularly in our household - it is quiet, quick, and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this item for over a year and it still works great. The only slight issues I&#x27;ve found are that the individual clipper heads bend a little allowing them to slide off. You can bend them back easily since they are plastic, but it&#x27;s a bit annoying. Also, the on/off switch is awkward. However, with the price so cheap, and the Amazon prime shipping it was well worth the little complaints.</li>
    <li> I bought this set as part of a promotion with a mail-in-rebate, and for the price I paid, It was a good deal. The clippers work pretty well, however often start to make a VERY loud buzzing noise while in use; this is resolved by applying pressure to the metal plate (annoying). As for the included trimmer - might as well throw it away. Even with brand new batteries, the thing lacks power to reliably cut hair without pulling.</li>
    <li> Great product for the price. I would only add one thing, it seems as if the lowest guard(1) does not cut as close as my last trimmer did. I thought it was just me but it&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s the same size ( 1/8 inch ) but does not cut as close. That&#x27;s my only complaint, if you can really call it a complaint. Overall great product and price.</li>
    <li> My 23 year old son has been cutting his buddies hair at college for the last 4 years to earn a few bucks. I gave him this set for Christmas and had him cut my hair as a first test. We were both impressed! He could not believe how nice they cut. I could not believe how nice my haircut looked. The little trimmer was awesome as well. Supper sharp stuff that cut great. Highly recommended..</li>
    <li> I saw reviews about getting used items but thats why i ordered through amazon. Brand new and everything included. they cut great and even my dad was surprised and he has used his share of clippers. on budget, get thee and you wont regret it.</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of Wahl hair clippers and this one did not let me down as usual. Sleek look, many attachments, and an absolute steal for the price! HIGHLY recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had it for about two months now and used it twice.  With haircuts costing $15 I&#x27;ve gotten my money back already.  Even if it explodes in a fireball tomorrow it was worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> Used it for three hair cuts, it works great, easy to use, cuts very clean. Also the price was lower at Amazon than the price on the Wahl web site.</li>
    <li> We have had this product about a month and made two or three cuts. It seems to work great and be a product worth getting to save money on haircuts in these tough economic times</li>
    <li> We bought this hair trimmer after having bought another at the store which turned out to be total junk.  This one works great, it comes with a whole set of equipment, a mirror, scissors, etc. It works well and cuts well, definitely a good quality device.    We&#x27;ve only used it once so far so I cant say how long it lasts but so far we are pretty happy with it.</li>
    <li> Wahl is a long-time company with a good reputation so, I bought with confidence. Was not disapointed. Lots of items for the price.  Really liked the small battery operated cutter too.  Many vibrating armature cutters are very noisy.  The Wahl cutter is quiet in operation.</li>
    <li> This is my second Wahl product. Bought my first clippers about 17 years ago and still going strong. I cut my own hair about 6 times a year so that&#x27;s 1, 2, 3, 4...a whole lot of cuts. Bought this set more for the rest of the kit rather than the main clippers. Anyway, it worked great right out of the box. No adjustments necessary. Now, if I could just lose all my hair like the rest of the men in my family, I would not have to worry about this stuff so much.</li>
    <li> This may be obvious to some, but read the little booklet that tells you how to cut hair before you take these clippers to your little one&#x27;s head.  I had no idea there was a piece designed specifically for the ears (brilliant!).  I sure wish I had known that before my husband gave our son a mini mullet around the ears.  I&#x27;m pretty positive his next hair cut will look better.  Overall, the clippers work great and the kit gives me more than everything I need.  After two or three cuts it buys itself (and maybe by then I&#x27;ll even be good at it).</li>
    <li> I have think hair that grows very fast. After 2 weeks, my hair starts to get annoying as it doesn&#x27;t feel short anymore! I decided to cut it myself after countless times driving to my stylist every 3 weeks and waiting for over 30 minutes to get a cut. All that time wasted for what is probably the easiest style...a simple short \\&quot;crew\\&quot; cut! It takes about 5 minutes! After reading some reviewers claiming that it too noisy, I was surprised that mine was soo quiet! No complaints here. I grabbed a hand mirror (large one) and started cutting the front with #3, then #2 to blend towards the back, and #1 for the sides and back. I was amazed at how good the clipper easily cut through my thick hair! This was too easy. Sure, holding a mirror and trimming was a little tricky at first, but you soon can cut by just feeling the contours of your head. I could cut my hair blindfolded! The small cordless trimmer is great for finishing touches. The trimmer was solid and strong! I can now save $300 a year on haircuts, gas, and time! Also, I can trim every week to maintain that fresh haircut feel. I wish that I had bought this years ago!</li>
    <li> Reveived this package after a week. Opened it,found the clipper is used, some black beards or hairs still there. THis is the first time I get a dishonest product from Amazon.</li>
    <li> My son likes me to cut his hair.  We always have issues with the clippers.  The have held up well, actually better than the others that we have purchased.</li>
    <li> Best investment I&#x27;ve made to date. I cut my own about hair twice a month and a 45 dollar investment saved me hundreds of dollars if not more.  With proper maintenance it still works like new 2+ years later.  The only issue I have is the smaller clippers just gave out.  I suppose I could have gone with 4 stars for this but for the cost savings for those looking for a buzz (or more complex based on your skills) makes it worthwhile for those who do low volume work.</li>
    <li> Works very well, small trimmer is excellent. One downside is attachments do not have small bag to hold them. Overall well worth purchase.</li>
    <li> We used the clipper and trimmer just once and it worked great.  We are very happy with the product.  After 2 1/2 trims we will have saved more money cutting ourselves than going to a barber.  The product works well.  I tried the trimmer on my husband and worked slowly.  Since it was my first time cutting hair I started in a place where it was not so noticeable. I followed the video and instructions. It was lots of fun.  I did have to go back and fix a few problem areas after the hair was washed and dried but it was really quick and easy.  I would highly recommend the product...at least so far.</li>
    <li> My old trimmer died out after 10+ years. So far the Wahl is a great replacement and it comes with a nice storage case to boot. The key to keeping a good set of trimmers is regularly oiling the blade and cleaning out the hair build up</li>
    <li> I bought these clippers with the intent purpose of, as closely as possible, a shaved haircut.  The problem is, the metal guard of the clippers are simply too large for that use.  I had an old pair of worn out clippers (which necessitated the buying of this particular model) and it performed admirably for many years.  So I took the guard off of it and put it on the Wahl clippers and now I have a great pair of clippers that cuts at the length I want.  Some people probably won&#x27;t care about this as, frankly the difference between the two guards is literally maybe an 1/8 of an inch, however it makes a difference to me.  Other than this one detail, the clippers are great, much quieter than my last set, cuts hair easily, weighs a decent amount (which I don&#x27;t mind) and comes with a ton of accessories (most of which I have no use for, but appreciate nonetheless).  So if you are shaving your head as I do, you might want to consider another pair of clippers (or at least considering modifying them as I did), anybody else should be good to go with these.</li>
    <li> Prior to purchasing these Wahl clippers, I&#x27;d bought a different brand that wouldn&#x27;t cut hair at all. I tried them one time and threw them in the garbage. These WAhl clippers cut beautifully and are exactly what I was looking for. I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to recommend them.</li>
    <li> The kit comes with everything you need to do haircuts (at least clipper based haircuts) at home.  It works great, cuts cleanly and evenly, and it&#x27;s quiet.  The trimmer works well also.  The only complaint I have about the kit is the cape that it came with.  The cape is essentially a glorified garbage bag.  We used the old cape from the previous kit.  Other than that, it&#x27;s an excellent buy and works like a charm.  If longevity is a problem I&#x27;ll repost.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t have to spend alot of money to get what seems like the best clipper set money can buy.  Very satisfied with this purchase. The clipper cuts great through thick hair, and the multiple attachment combinations make it great for different trimming techniques.  I like to trim up my 5 and 2-year old sons hair every few weeks, and so far this kit has made it much easier, and the results are better than my old set.  I like to use the longer 3/4\\&quot;, and 1\\&quot; attachments so I don&#x27;t have give them only crew/buzz cuts.  I can leave the top longer, and taper the sides and back with smaller attachments.  Even has an angled attachment for around the ears.  Not to mention the cordless trimmer, also very nice for around the ears and neckline.  That&#x27;s all folks from a true do it yourselfer!</li>
    <li> The Trimmer and accessories included are good quality, and serve as a complete kit for all of our families hair cutting needs.  We&#x27;ve owned other Trimmer brands and have been disappointed, but after doing some research and owning these for about a month we are very happy.      Pros:   --Price is right, especially for everything included.  --Good Quality    Cons:  --Doesn&#x27;t make me look like Brad Pitt</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift..... to one of the most anal and very OCD people&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, they &amp;#34;love this set&amp;#34; ,  can&#x27;t praise it enough, and I was in SHOCK.  They said they couldn&#x27;t find anything they have ever liked and wouldn&#x27;t trade this one for any of the others they have ever tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Believe me, that&#x27;s a recommendation that would be hard to earn.</li>
    <li> I use my clippers to give myself a buzz cut once or twice a week.  The battery powered trimmer never worked, but the actual clippers were great...for about a year.  Not all the attachments fit correctly, but that didn&#x27;t matter because I didn&#x27;t use any.  After about a year, the power switch became difficult to switch to on, and would not stay running unless you were holding the switch a certain way.  Now I am unable to return or exchange and have clippers that are useless.  I have recently read other reviews where the customer had the exact same problem, but a lot sooner than I did.</li>
    <li> This was a replacement for a Conair that was about 15 years old. Price was a factor in the purchase. I tried to get a nice package of product for the best price. I got my money worth but the quality of the clippers is less than my Conair. It cuts nice but the adjustment on the side has no \\&quot;stops\\&quot; so I can never get it in the same place once moved. The plastic guards are cheaply made with flimsy plastic. Thankfully my Conair guards fit this one. I would not recommend this product to anyone. On the bright side, Amazon was fast shipping!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son.  He uses it weekly and loves it.  I&#x27;m buying another one for my husband. I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these sets back in the 1998 or &#x27;99 and it still works perfectly. The only difference between my old one and these new ones is that my clipper has a plastic covering. I trim my hair with this trimmer about every 6 weeks to 3 months. Works like new! If you buy this you should also buy a bottle of clipper oil to keep the cutter new and so it doesn&#x27;t rust. I bought a 4 oz. bottle of Andis clipper oil at Wal Mart recently for about $5. That should last you a heck of a long time! This clipper set is 5 stars and very convenient to own. You can also use this for \\&quot;man grooming\\&quot;. Just use a really short guard or no gaurd depending on the length you want. Haha.  Great clipper set.</li>
    <li> I purchased my clipper set 4 weeks ago.  The clippers give me the close shave I desire.  I utilize the facial trimmer to shape up my beard.  The clippers are very sturdy and of high quality. I am shocked at how low the price is for such wonderful quality.  The company included several pieces in the clipper set, a mirror and scissor to name a few.  Hope you all enjoy your clipper set as I have.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I bought a hair clipper.  I used it a few times and it performed very well.  The grip was very nice and the cut was very smooth.  It was also very quite.  You cannot go wrong with this even for the first time.  The guide combs are included so that you can have precision cut.  This is a very well made clipper and I am so happy with the purchase.  The best part is the cordless trimmer.  My wife helped me trim the neck and behind the ears and did a fantastic job with it.      I liked the storage bag it came in and find it very handy to carry on luggage.  I wish it was a little more organized.  Most of the stuff just fluttered all around.  This is not a problem any more since I put all the combs in a Zip-loc bag.     When I first opened the box, I was not that impressed with the look of it because the chrome is just plastic.  But for the price, this is a grate buy.  It works as advertise and I use it every other weeks.  No more Great Clips, its all my wife and Whal.</li>
    <li> Received these clippers early and they were just as described. I have used them several times and have had no problems, I cut my hair short and can use them on myself, they have already paid for them selves.</li>
    <li> The clippers work just fine.  I do not regret the purchase.  I clip my husband&#x27;s hair with them.  I tried to clip my dog&#x27;s fur but he has a very thick undercoat that the extensions won&#x27;t go through it.  They work just fin where his coat is not as thick though.</li>
    <li> It is good.&lt;br /&gt;I am satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;By the way, try it with the smallest comb guide.&lt;br /&gt;I tried it with a large comb guide for the first time, and I had to go to the barber&#x27;s for correcting my mistake!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for this Clipper and trimmer combo for a long time, finally got a good deal in amazon. I liked this 27 pieces because its a complete set. Clipper is good and easy to use, trimmer gives a fine touch. My wife didn&#x27;t know how to clip n cut hair but this device is so simple that after following instructions she cut it in a perfect way. I have bought this about 2 months ago and it has given its price value already... So every new hair cut will be like free. I like it.</li>
    <li> I like the feel and action of this trimmer.  My boys have very thick hair and this cut through it unlike some other models.  Time will tell though.  Love the additional clean up trimmer.</li>
    <li> good product for his price. the only negative from this product is the battery operating trimmer lots of noise and the battery dont last more as 20 minutes.jacob puister costa rica</li>
    <li> This item was a much better option for me than going to the salon and paying $15 each time for a buzz cut.  This has all the things I need to do it myself, and then some!  Very satisfied with Wahl.</li>
    <li> This clipper works excellent. It has plenty of attachments. I would highly recommend this model to anyone interested in cutting your families hair.</li>
    <li> At first, this unit was hard to adjust. It was waaaay too loud and clattered uncontrollably. With adjustment of the screw on the side and a little tweaking it finally worked and gave me a great haircut! The mini trimmer is very convenient too. The guide combs are marked very poorly though and its hard to see which is which. The other added pieces (mirror, combs, scissors etc...) are basically useless add-ons. But overall, it works quite well.</li>
    <li> These are great clippers, sharp and easy to use. They come with lots of accessories, some better than others. For example, the cape is just a thin piece of plastic, the spray bottle probably holds an ounce of liquid, and the clippers are kind of cheap too.. but other than that, it really is a nice product!</li>
    <li> I bought this gift for my boyfriend as a Christmas gift and he LOVED it. Great price and great quality clippers for men. It came with everything he needed and the clippers did not heat up in his hand like another clipper that he borrowed from his friends. It also came with an instruction book on how he should start cutting his hair and everything fits nicely in the pouch for easy storage. Great buy!</li>
    <li> For years I have gone to the Hair Cuttery for a $12 dollar crew cut. I was always in and out in less than ten minutes. I figured I should invest in a trimmer and do it myself. The Wahl comes with a ridiculous amount of attachments for almost any length or style you desire. The machine itself is dense and heavy. It feels like a professional trimmer. Just four cuts and I am ahead of the game. This is an excellent piece of machinery.</li>
    <li> i know a great product when i see one..this product is a well built quality product, i use it for my kids. i love all the different accessories it comes with.. you wont need anything else.. the only problem i have with this clipper is that its kind of loud..but i m use to it by now..</li>
    <li> Best investment I have made In a long time!! These have already paid for themselves! I know cut my boyfriends hair at home as well as cutting the hair of my daughters with the scissors that have come with it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve noticed other customers reporting the same issue, the power switch starts to fail (and eventually completely breaks) after limited use.  I expect I got around 6-7 sessions out of this before the switch started to fail.  10-11 uses later and it&#x27;s nearly impossible to turn on.</li>
    <li> Excellent product except for trimmer being made in China.  You think that  Wahl would have made the trimmer in the USA also.  No we have high unemployment but give it to the Chinese.</li>
    <li> Well worth the money. I just received this hair trimmers. Trimmers are very well made. Attachments are very practical. Only problem I have  is with The scissor. It  is not  sharp enough for cutting hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a Wahl home kit set for about over a month and finally I found one with a great price. I received it within a few days and I&#x27;ve had it for over a month and it works great. I would definitely refer it to a friend or family.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll make it a quick and simple. Ordered this thinking it was the better one compared to the Wahl 79520-3101 which my son has which I always used.. Though it might have more pieces and it has a chrome finish upon opening it and inspecting it I boxed it up in a heart beat.. The main reason is the print on the cutter attachments are Very Very small. Ended up returning it and order the Wahl 79520-3101 which is much easyier to read and make out which size cutter attachment.</li>
    <li> Feels just like the clippers a the barber shop! Comes with many haircut length attachments. I would definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only bought two hair clippers in my lifetime. A Conair one which was pathetic, and this Whal clipper.   I&#x27;ve had this set for over 3 years and it still runs beautifully! Very sturdy. I know they say to oil clippers frequently, but honestly I haven&#x27;t done so in over a year and it still runs great. The extension pieces also fit snug even after 3 years. I also like that they aren&#x27;t too pointy like the Conair ones that practically dig into your skull. The ONLY thing that I didn&#x27;t like about this set was that the small trimmer eats up the battery very quickly, and the on/off switch is messed up to where I have to keep my finger pressed on it. Other than that it cuts pretty well.  All in all, I would definitely recommend this clipper set.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend and we are very happy with it. It is very fast and the clippers work perfectly! I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I previously owned a set of cheap wahl clippers, I bought this as a replacement but didn&#x27;t expect much of a difference (a clipper a clipper how different could it be?)  I was very surprised when I went to cut my hair, these new ones did it perfectly on the first pass, were quieter, went incredibly smoothly, and I finished in half the time. The overall quality of the guards and accessories seems to be better than the previous set as well.  I could go into more detail, suffice to say overall I&#x27;m very impressed with these clippers I expect they&#x27;ll work great for years to come.</li>
    <li> For a few months now, I have been borrowing my roommates trimmer, which is fairly discussing. I got this and it was amazing, I gave myself a proper haircut in minutes. No waiting in line, easy to read instructions, all the accessories I need and more. After two uses, it pays for itself. I would recommend this to anyone who does their own hair or does professional styling for their friends or in a shop.</li>
    <li> I got this item about a year ago, and since then it&#x27;s been one trouble after the other.&lt;br /&gt;The machine overheats and is literally too hot to handle after about half an hour or so.&lt;br /&gt;The plastic pieces are the most ill-fitting piece of cr*p I&#x27;ve ever had the misfortune of fitting--they ruin my hair cuts every time when they fall off.&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, like they say, it never rains it pours, the adjuster shouldn&#x27;t be called that at all since it seems to have a life of it&#x27;s own. It changes position constantly making the clipper a nightmare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely would not be hoodwinked again into buying another product of a shadow of a fading glory that is Wahl. I will only recommend this product to an enemy.</li>
    <li> Heavy weight unlikely to be suitable for many. Low rating based on the uncomfortably loud noise generated by this trimmer.  Unclear whether this is a design fault or it arrived with a mechanical fault.  Caveat emptor.  Another Wahl trimmer, purchased in Japan, works well and is silent by comparison.</li>
    <li> Very nice quality product.  The accessories are a little loose in the case, but work well and made of thick plastic.</li>
    <li> I have had several clippers in the past few years as i cut my own hair. I have spent upwards of $50 for a clipper set that felt cheap and ended up lasting a short amount of time. Wahl makes a very excellent and easy to use clipper. The trimmer included feels cheap as it runs off a AA battery, but it does cut well. Clippers themselves are very quiet, sharp and comfortable in the hand (anyone who cuts their own hair will understand what i mean). Enough guides to do your whole head (facial hair, eyebrows, ears, and head hair).</li>
    <li> I have been using a Wahl clipper for the last 20 years. They were always very sturdy and well made. This is the first new clipper I&#x27;ve purchased in the last 10 years. This Wahl clipper is very cheaply made. it is light and plastic and will probably not last very long. It is VERY different from the old Wahl clippers. I am wondering now if everything they make is cheap. No apparent way to find out...</li>
    <li> The clipper does a great job but is a little bit heavy.  The blades give a very even cut.  I especially like the trimmer.</li>
    <li> I am thankful that I found such a high quality product at a great price.   I am very pleased with this item.</li>
    <li> Works great and the sound it makes isn&#x27;t that loud. The only problem is that sometimes when I turn it on, it messes up and makes a weird really loud buzzing noise. It&#x27;s hard to explain but it sounds like it broke. But I just turn it off and re-adjust the clipper and it&#x27;s back to normal</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been happy with the product so far.  It does as good as a job as they do at the haircut place.</li>
    <li> Being a military family, we&#x27;ve saved SO much money over the years by cutting hair at home.     We used these clippers a couple of times, and I have to say that giving haircuts is so much easier!    Very precise, gives nice close cuts, easy to use, easy to clean, wonderful storage case, comes with so many accessories!     They are kind of loud, but that doesn&#x27;t bother us as it just means they are powerful.      Definitely worth it!</li>
    <li> Awful, I had to throw it away after a few uses (and I bought an Oster instead that I like). It was really impossible to use because of vibrations: The whole machine shakes when you use it.</li>
    <li> Works great.  My 1st attemp at haircutting and the product made it extremely easy.</li>
    <li> This a very good clippers.All the attachments fit tight and work good.It comes with everything you need to give A nice haircut</li>
    <li> I bought this for a Christmas gift for my son in law and he absolutely loved it.  I&#x27;m so pleased!  He used them almost as soon as he got them out of the box!  I definitely recommend this seller.  The clippers arrived on time (3,000 miles away fro me!) and they were in the best of condition!  My son in law&#x27;s happy, my daughter&#x27;s happy, so I&#x27;m happy!  Thanks so much for this!</li>
    <li> These work great. With all the attachments you can get a super great looking Hair cut..</li>
    <li> I have been using it on my two year old and my 70 year old father. Works great for people who don&#x27;t mind having a less fashionable haircut.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  My wife has never cut hair before and did a great job with this system.  I have a military hair-cut so granted, it isn&#x27;t too difficult.  I would highly recommend this product to novices and experts.</li>
    <li> Was very pleased with this purchase.   Been cutting hair for over a year now, and my last set of cheap Ebay clippers went out. After reading many reviews on this product I decided to take the plunge.   The clippers are nice and heavy, the cutter is aligned perfectly and very sharp. Cuts like a hot knife through butter. The many assorted attachment combs are great. I especially like the ones for trimming/tapering around the ears. This whole set made my haircut even easier and more blended.   The included trimmer is nice. It&#x27;s small and quiet and uses one AA battery. I used a rechargeable Ni-MH battery to power it with. Glad I did for the little trimmer sucked the life out of that one battery.    Overall it is one of the best investments I have made to date. Well worth the price!</li>
    <li> very good&lt;br /&gt;execelente the product, purchasing and shipping geestion.&lt;br /&gt;I congratulate</li>
    <li> Clipper set comes with a ton of attachments, but is way to loud. You can hear it from the outside. Not very good overall</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews and searched different models before choosing this model.  I like the cordless touch up mini clipper that came with.  I have had several cheap ones before and this one seems great.  I used it for the first time a week ago.  People said its loud.  Every pair of clippers i have owned have been loud, so in my opinion, it wasn&#x27;t any louder than the rest.  It has a screw to adjust the speed if you have low voltage outlets.  I thought that was clever.  Overall, I think this is a great item at a great price.</li>
    <li> This is the second one of these trimmers I have purchased and am very pleased with it.  Lots of extra attachments with this one too.</li>
    <li> My wife has never cut hair.  We opened the kit followed the included instructions and whoila!  It paid for itself.  She has even begun using the scissor shears on her and my daughters hair.  Iys an excellent beginners kit.</li>
    <li> I bought this to save money by cutting my own hair.  So far I have used it twice.  The money I saved from going to a hair stylist has paid for it, so now it will be saving me more money as I continue to use it.  Not sure how long these things hold up, but for this price I can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> I needed a new wahl set, cuz the ones I had were older than me. These give me a clean cut all around with no small clumps.</li>
    <li> I got tired of my cordless beard trimmers dying on me.  This Wahl rocks.  The combination of large cutter and small battery operated trimmer is excellent.  A week after recieving this clipper, my wife even cut my hair.  I love this purchase.</li>
    <li> This is our second Wahl clipper.  The first lasted 20+ years and my son took it with him to the Army.  This new one lacks the quality of the first.  The primary problem it the connection of the motor to the blade is plastic.  The plastic works loose from the blade, causing the clipper to stop working.  It requires a simple disassembly to fix the trouble (2 screws)but it is annoying to have to do it every 10-15 minutes.  The $10 Conair clipper that we bought from Dollar General work much better.  The extra doodads that come with the Wahl clipper are nice, but unnecessary.  The scissors are junk, and who needs 12 different guides?  4 guides are enough for our family anyway.  If I could return the Wahl clipper for a refund, I would.</li>
    <li> Buying and receiving this Wahl clipper was so easy and the resulting great performance kind of gives a feel well attitude in this sometime rip-off the consumer mentality we have fallen into. The machine is much better in performance than my last two. Smooth and quiet doing a great cutting job.</li>
    <li> It sucked at first it was working great but after 3 haircuts it started to to be loud and it wouldnt stop</li>
    <li> Trimmer is excellent for cutting the sideburns. Overall im very satisfied and would buy it again in case if the shipment would be done on time. Amazon delayed with shipment for like 5 days. The rest is even cheaper than anywhere else for me when i saw the prices. Shopping is good if the shipment would be on time.</li>
    <li> These clippers have already paid for themselves like ten times.  They feel powerful and do not pull on your hair like those Con Air clippers.  It has some weight to it and the steel feels sturdy.  The best thing is they are made in the US which supports our workers all while being more reliable than cheap Chinese products. Overall I would recommend Wahl clippers over other brands, after all most barbers carry this brand.  (Note only hair clippers are US made all the cordless wahl stuff is made in China...ewww)</li>
    <li> If you need a product to get a really close cut on African American hair, without tugs and pulls, this is not the product.  It&#x27;s not as close as other Wahl products, nor as sharp.  But if you need the guides for various longer styles it should be great.  I gave it to my dad for that reason.  Also, the battery edger is basically a toy.  If you really need a edger or trimer, you&#x27;d be better off buying a plug-in or rechargeable.</li>
    <li> The Wahl 79524-1001 Deluxe Chrome trimmer boasts a durable motor for a less noisy sound from this device. It also has a smaller trimmer which is perfect for shaping the sides and back edges of hair.     This is a five star product-</li>
    <li> This clipper &amp; trimmer kit is the best we&#x27;ve ever purchased.The clippers and trimmer were very sharp , making the cutting prossess very smooth . I love the Wahl 79524-1001 deluxe chrome pro.</li>
    <li> We have used this clipper set for 4 or so haircuts and it works great!  Plenty of attachments make trimming hair a breeze!</li>
    <li> I recently bought this clipper set and it works fine.  Havent had the chance yet to really test the clippper but so far so good. I got rid of my Andis clipper because it kept pulling my hair and the power wasn&#x27;t sufficient.  The wahl clipper glides pretty smooth when cutting although it does still tend to pull my at times but that may be due to user error. The trimmer is an added bonus with this set since it is difficult to get around the ears and neck with regular clippers.  Overall, I am satisfied with this purchase considering the price and what you get.</li>
    <li> I used it the first time yesterday and I felt so great! With the previous clipper, I always call people&#x27;s name when it pull my hair many times....  Yesterday, I used this new Wahl clipper the first time and I did not call any people&#x27;s name !! As I am getting older, I can not afford to lost more hair. People said the pulled hair won&#x27;t grow back. I love this Wahl clipper and I got a big bottle of oil with it. I hope it won&#x27;t pull my hair for next 2 years. The barber comb does not have sharp teeth but the guide combs have sharp teeth. It can hurt you if you try to cut hair in a hurry. The noise is actually less than my last clipper with less vibration. I find it quite comfortable to hold it for 10 to 15 minutes. For that low price, I give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, easy to use and very durable. I would very highly recommend this product to friends.</li>
    <li> I hate this product it doesn&#x27;t remove any hair am almost bald and like to shave my head any way so i bought this item only to remove the little hair i have which isn&#x27;t much and it couldn&#x27;t even do that.I suggest do like i&#x27;m about to spend more money on a real set of clippers may be a lot of money but at least you&#x27;ll be satisfied.As for the person selling this item thanks for nothing.</li>
    <li> This is our second clipper in 2 years and so far, so good. It has a little bit of weight and power to it which I like. I do my husband&#x27;s hair and occasionally my 20-something son&#x27;s. As long as you keep the blades oiled (included) it does not pull and does a nice job. I am not a professional and I only do basic cuts/trims which is easy to do with this tool. I use the included scissors to trim eyebrows (yes, they&#x27;re that long) and around the ears. I do not bother with the little battery-operated clipper included...no power and a waste. Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Product works very well and is easy to use.  Reasonably priced so it pays for itself quickly.</li>
    <li> I have tried to cut my husband&#x27;s hair numerous times in the past, but I always end up having to send him to get it professionally cut to fix the horrible job I did!  Well, we are trying to cut costs now and thought maybe it would go better with a nicer set...in comes the Wahl Deluxe Chrome Pro.  I bought it based off the overwhelming number of positive reviews, and we have not been disappointed!  Our old set pulled at my husband&#x27;s hair, which made it a painful experience for him.  This clipper didn&#x27;t pull at his hair at all.  It was very easy to use.  There is even a little booklet inside showing proper technique for cutting hair, which proved invaluable to me.  First use and it looks like a professional cut!  The scissors are sharp, it comes with many accessories, and the carrying case is very nice.  Wonderful set which I would recommend to anyone.  You can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> For the price you can not go wrong for a set of clipper. The clipper was shipped on time and was delivered faster then most other shipper.</li>
    <li> I got the order pretty fast with no problems. The products works great. no complains on my end.  will order next time if i need to</li>
    <li> Just got this clipper and found it a breeze to use.  It feels sturdy and clips well.  It wasn&#x27;t loud and the instructions were a big help.  If you have an uncomplicated haircut like mine, the biggest job will be sweeping the floor afterwards.    You might even get lucky if you buy this in June--there&#x27;s a $10 discount for Wahl products bought through Amazon if the cost is $39.  This item is sometimes above and sometimes below.  Either way, it&#x27;s a great buy.</li>
    <li> The fact that it offers 27 piece makes this item hard to pass up on. Upon recieving still no complaints. The true test will not come until I put them to use</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very noisy and as a brand new product it&#x27;s not as sharp as it should be so who knows how it becomes after some usage.</li>
    <li> I received the Wahl clipper fairly quickly, and it came in a nice pack. I was at first intimidated by the amount of stuff inside the bag: looking at the plastic poncho it felt like I was taking up hair-cutting as a profession, but the poncho was quite useful in my first experience cutting my own hair.    The manual was very clear, and the clipper worked very well. I could use the clipper without any attachments to trim my beard as well. Overall, very satisfied and happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I do like this product and it seems well built.  My only compliant is that, while there are many blade lengths, there really should be one more for shorter hair.  The shortest attachment really doesn&#x27;t cut that closely.</li>
    <li> this was a gift to my grandson for Christmas. He was very thrilled with it. It was what he wanted most. He had one before and was not thrilled about the product. I searched the network and found this one, and I was glad I did. Thank you</li>
    <li> This clipper set is excellent.  I have pretty thick hair so I started with a higher guard and worked my way down to a 3.  It basically has everything you need.  Definitely a great product.</li>
    <li> I used this as soon as I got it.  Even though I have never cut hair before, with the easy to follow instructions, I was comfortably using the Wahl clipper and trimmer inside of 15 minutes.  I couldn&#x27;t cut the hair on the back of my head, so my wife volunteered to cut it for me, even though she had no experience herself either, and she did a great job in about 5 minutes, after following the instructions provided.  Great product, feels and looks professional, paid for itself immediately!</li>
    <li> mi firts hair machine    its beautifull, confortable, the heat is no problem, the numbers 1,2,3,4,5,6 etc, never fall of the machine, they are firm    there are too many accesories, i dont recommend buying all of them, unless you want to cut hair for profession,     amazon send it in a really big box, that cost money when send it to venezuela,     thats all</li>
    <li> I found this product to work just as I expected.  I don&#x27;t plan on opening a hair styling shop with the kit but it will work for taking care of my needs.</li>
    <li> I received the Wahl 27 piece clipper in great condition with all pieces and a zippered case.  The clippers are very solid and quiet running compared to what I expected with such a reasonably priced unit.  It has all types of cutting height guides including a L and R hand guide for around the top of the ears.  It gave a nice cut without any pulling of the hair.  It will not take long to pay for this set.</li>
    <li> finally i found whate i was searching for since long time. it is really verry nice. it is cheap, safe, easy to use, can be carried any where. all styles you will find. but, its sound is high and there is little vibrations while using; i think this is the only disadventage.</li>
    <li> the clippers look so good, and I couldn&#x27;t wait to get them on my head to give myself a no 3 haircut.  Problem was, that in Australia we run all our appliances at 240 volts and the clippers are set to USA standards....  Bummer... so I went to the electric shop here to get the correct adapter to reduce the voltage, I can get that that for 50 bucks, which costs me more than the clippers.Then the salesman tells me that I will need another adaption?? That will correct the vibrations that make the product rattle and sound like a motorbike...It is set on 60 something or rather and we run on far less than that....   Otherwise the product looks fantastic and I am upset that I can&#x27;t use it unless I fork out more money...  So be aware Australians Walh clippers need two electric adaptions if you are going to buy it from amazon and the USA....   all the best ...  Hairy eric</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for the past 3 years and finally decided to get a new set of clippers. These clippers are fantastic. They cut well come with a bunch of accessories. What&#x27;s not to love? Well, there is one thing... these clippers are incredibly LOUD. I feel as if I might go deaf in one ear if I&#x27;m cutting too close to it. It&#x27;s not just annoyingly loud, I feel like if you really sat there using them for the entire duration of a haircut, it would be bad for your hearing.</li>
    <li> I bought this set for $23.00 and could not be happier.  At about $15 dollars a cut (w/ tip) for a professional barber this set pays for itself in 2 haircuts!  You really can&#x27;t go wrong for less than a dollar for each piece.  I am absolutely satisfied with the overall quality and feel of the clippers and would recommend this to everyone (as I am now).  Enjoy it! SAVE MONEY!</li>
    <li> what a sweet deal. This product has given me and my roomate 2 haircuts and up until now I am really satisfied with this product. It trims really smothe with no pull and I would definately recommend this product to anyone who is trying to save some money and cut their own hair</li>
    <li> Nice and professional... I&#x27;m such a genius.  Love the small trimmer.    The big one works good too, but need to clean every time.</li>
    <li> Spend a few more bucks and get a better model without a cordless trimmer. I received mine and the trimmer doesn&#x27;t even work. The worst part is I didn&#x27;t find out until months later because I rarely use a trimmer.  Thank God I was able to borrow one from another stylist or my guest would have gotten a free haircut and looked like they didn&#x27;t even get one.</li>
    <li> The small trimmer should have come with a battery.  Both the clippers seem to be well made.  As for the rest of the items, I found they were quite  cheap and could have been left out of the package.  the cape looked like a kitchen garbage bag and we are not sure that the scissors would have cut paper.  but for the price the clippers were worth it.</li>
    <li> Bought this set for my son who is always stealing my husband&#x27;s 20 year old Wahl clippers. Since those still worked so well, I chose the Wahl brand over the others. My son loves them and it&#x27;s a great value for the package. Couldn&#x27;t find anything like this in the store.</li>
    <li> I really haven&#x27;t used all of the product yet.  I have used the trimmer and it is all that it said it was.  I haven&#x27;t had a need to use the clipper as yet but based on other Wahl products I am sure that I will be more than pleased.  This trimmer set replaces one that is over 30 years old that we inherited from my father.  This has many more attachments than the old one.  So far I have been more than happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> This is very good quality and complete. It is easy to use. For simple cuts on buys or men, it pays for itself in 2-3 uses! Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I will only be direct and forward with my opinion on this product:    Pros:  - Great clipper for head hair.  - Powerful, cuts even wet hair.  - Great variety of heads and shave level.    Cons:  - Very inconvenient as beard trimmer.  - The small trimmer is rubbish; it is not efficient, and doesn&#x27;t provide continues power, it goes slow and fast (even with new batteries).  - Doesn&#x27;t work under shower and not water proof.      So basically, if you&#x27;re looking for a beard trimmer, this is not the tool for you, trust me. You may need to look into other medium size trimmers that work specifically for small body areas (like face) and works cord-less under shower too, if possible.    However, if you&#x27;re maniac about shaving your head at home, and buzzing your head off. This might be just the tool for you. It&#x27;s a good hair clipper.</li>
    <li> I have only used this twice so far and it works well.  It has many clipper sizes and is easy to use.</li>
    <li> This is a great, quality product. I bought it as a gift for my dad who is a hairy guy. He uses it to trim his head and back hair, and it has worked well for him.</li>
    <li> This might have been an okay hair clipper if it actually clipped hair. Seeing as how it got a lot of good reviews, maybe mine was just faulty but it would pluck hair on the back of my head which was pretty unpleasant. It was decent on short hair, but not great either. I would have to do a lot of passes to get a fairly even cut. The power button is sometimes hard to operate as well.     The little mirror is useless because it&#x27;s too small and I threw out the \\&quot;cape,\\&quot; which is basically a large plastic bag and is totally useless. The little trimmer is actually okay for finishing around the ears and the neck. The attachments are decent and stay on tight and are easy to clip on and off.    I threw this away recently and bought myself a professional Andis BGRC. I should have bought it earlier, since I have been, and will be cutting my own hair for a while. I suggest investing in a professional clipper if you want to clip your own hair for at least a couple years as they&#x27;re more powerful and more durable. I went through 3 of these cheap clippers before finally settling on a professional clipper and I am absolutely satisfied.</li>
    <li> I have been through three of the &#x27;rechargeable&#x27; trimmer/clippers over the last few years. They work well in the beginning, but the power, which leaves you wanting to begin with, fades over time with cycling of the battery and eventually they die. As expensive as the good ones are ($40-$90), it is cost prohibitive to repair them, so they get chucked into the trash and a new one is purchased. I was tired of throwing my money away and for years I have admired the heavy duty looking trimmers I have always (and I mean forever) seen used by hair professionals. They look like they are indestructible. I also equated the quality with cost and assumed that as a tool of a trade they would demand a steep fee to acquire one. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Well whaddaya know? The Wahl is a very similar version and it is half the price of the rechargeables... it works better, smoother and with less effort.... comes with a veritable toolchest of attachments including some combs, a scissors and would you believe it even has a bib wrap to cover the shoulders of a client! Heavy? yup... and it feels like it will last forever. Vibration? Absolutely, just like the ones my barber uses.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Want something that will do the job... every time? This item is a winner!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with these clippers. I have bought at least three different clippers before this, and none worked. These ones are very sharp and have great parts to it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s well known that Wahl makes the best hair clippers.  But the accessories that come with this kit are horrible.  The guides are flimsy, and the teeth get caught in various orientations.  The mirror is a joke.  The trimmer that came in my kit is absolutely terrible; its motor does not run at a consistent speed, and it sounds like it is running out of batteries, even when the batteries are fresh.  The oil dispenser is cheap and awkward.  And lastly, the carrying case is bad for organizing all the parts of the kit.  I had Oster clippers before that had a much better carrying case.  This is basically just a bag that lets all of your parts bounce around without any sort of organization.    It&#x27;s clear that Walh&#x27;s strategy is to pour all of their energy into their clipper, and absolutely minimal energy into the other accessories.  Shame on them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if its louder or has more vibrations, but the second time I attempted to cut my 3 year old and 17 month old sons&#x27; hair with it- they both freaked out - begging me not to use it. I managed to get a few swipes in on both kids and the outcome was pretty bad. Even the ice cream prize that accompanies haircuts wasn&#x27;t enough of a consolation prize. So the next night, back I went to the $15 buzzer I had bought from Kohl&#x27;s and the kids happily ate their ice cream and let mommy go about her business- fixing the damage done from the night before.     And as exciting as 27 pieces sounds- it didn&#x27;t offer the transitions I needed to give the boys an even, faded cut. I usually use 1/8\\&quot; along their neckline and fade to a 1/2\\&quot; on top. It comes with the same 3 sizes, (1/8, 1/4 and 1/2) but the results weren&#x27;t as nice. Not as smooth of a transition.  The small, battery buzzer that comes with it, is cute and didn&#x27;t scare the kids quite as much, but it only makes the \\&quot;bare-est\\&quot; of cuts. So if you have a squirmy kid (what 18 month old isn&#x27;t?) you get bald spots. Although its funny, its not what you were hoping for. Overall, a disappointing purchase.</li>
    <li> I began cutting my hair about a year ago and was using my old oster from costco that was maybe 5-7 years old. I had a lot of broken guards and the blades were starting to make a lot of noise. I did some research and found these to be a decent set for the price. It has so many guards and the clipper itself cuts really solidly. I like the extra trimmer to cut the sideburns. I cut my hair every 2 or 3 weeks now and have no worries that it isnt cutting evenly. If it does cut unevenly its my fault! Overall im very satisfied and would buy it again. Amazon was even cheaper than walmart for me when i check the prices. Go do some shopping.</li>
    <li> The mirror is to small, and the cape the it comes with is like a trash bag, other than that, pretty good so far.</li>
    <li> This is a really good Wahl hair cutting set.  The clipper is sturdy, but  nice and light to use. There are numerous attachments including a trimmer, clipper, two different combs, clips, scissors,  oil, and every conceivable size clipper attachment that you are likely to need. My husband is thrilled, and as I am the person cutting his hair, I am thrilled also. Great value for money and as usual, super fast shipping from Amazon, thak you.</li>
    <li> These clippers perform very well, great investment. All of the attachments fit fine, and the clippers give an even cut. The little trimmer is also very good for evening out the cut. All in all this will save me alot of money on haircuts.</li>
    <li> These clippers are amazing.  I feel like I have a real set of clippers that a barber would have.  It comes very neatly packaged and the case it all is stored in works perfectly for storing it the bathroom without losing pieces and have wires all over.  Great product and great buy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a professional, and I don&#x27;t require a lot out of a haircut.  Like many, I just decided to save a few bucks and run a 3-guard over my own head once a month or so.  I went with the Wahl name, and I have no complaints after a year of great (and free) haircuts.  The clipper is heavy and solid, which makes it easy to control.  It&#x27;s not too loud, but the vibration will leave your hand buzzing for a minute afterward.  It came with tons of accessories in a great zipper carrying bag.  I use the mirror, combs, ear-trim tool, and a couple of different guards to manage my hair and my beard (you&#x27;ll obviously still need a razor for any close shave work).  I used the little mini-trimmer for quick touch-ups, but it quickly ran its [included] AAA batteries dead and I haven&#x27;t replaced them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Wahl clippers are easy to use (I&#x27;m left-handed, and it&#x27;s no problem) and easy to clean, with no maintenance necessary.  They have definitely met my high expectations and exceeded my needs.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the quality and performance.  I use this to cut hair for both of my boys.  It comes with every last tool I need to do a job equal to or better than the one they get at the barber shop.  Will be cutting their hair at home from now on.    Just have a vacuum cleaner on hand, and after you finish cutting, vacuum the tools in this kit as well to keep everything clean.  Best to apply a tiny bit of oil (comes with the kit) to the blades after every cut to keep things running smoothly.    Doesn&#x27;t heat up quickly like some less expensive units.</li>
    <li> The only problem with these is that when I went to cut my son&#x27;s hair along his neck line it actually cut his skin and caused him to bleed.  I have to use the small trimmer for finishing touches.  Also it appears that the blade is crooked.  I will probably remove the two large screws and see if there is any way to straighten them out rather than deal with the huge headache of trying to return the thing.</li>
    <li> I like the feel of this model in the hand. The switch is sturdier, and the motor is quieter. I&#x27;ve owned a few Wahl&#x27;s, and this is the best so far</li>
    <li> This is the best set of hair clippers I have bought yet. They cut even and very smooth, I didn&#x27;t have the usual missed hairs all over the side of my head that I usually have from the barber shop. They are not loud like the really cheap sets I have and the accessories make it very easy to cut your own hair. Another bonus is the cordless trimmer which is great for touch ups.</li>
    <li> The product works great but make sure you get a NEW one and not USED. Saw another review that stated clippers were covered with hair and the product was clearly used when purchased as new.  Sounded a little strange when I first read it, but the same happened to me!  Clippers had chunks of hair, spray bottle still had water in it, and scissors were clearly used as well.  AMAZON DID MAKE THINGS RIGHT AND SHIPPED ME A NEW ONE THAT THAT WAS INFACT NEW.  But the fact remains that a new one was purchased initially and a used one was sent.  Other than that, product is fine.</li>
    <li> The Wahl 79524-1001 Deluxe hair clipper is a great value when you consider the cost of a hair cut , it comes with many attachments, runs smooth and effortless and plugs in, so power not a problem. I wanted my hair to be close but not bald, so I use the Wahl without any attachments. I use it about once a week and I find I can maintain the look I want in just a few minutes. I have had several compliments. I also believe with little practice the Wahl Clipper can manage any hair cut and have it look professoinal. I would recommend the Wahl Clipper to anyone family and friends.</li>
    <li> Purchased this about 5 months ago. These are the first clippers i have ever purchased, and they have been good to m. Comes with a variety of options, and the smaller shaver is battery powered, just wonderful, it also comes with a sheet to cover those who&#x27;s hair you are cutting which i really nice.</li>
    <li> THANK YOU FOR A GREAT HAIR BUZZER.USED IT TWICE WITH NO PROBLEMS.ALSO IT INCLUDES ALOT OF GREAT ATTACHMENTS LIKE AN ATTACHMENT TO CUT AROUND THE EARS.JUST MAKE SURE YOU USE ALOT OF OIL THE FIRST COUPLE TIMES NOT FOR JUST THIS ONE BUT FOR ALL BUZZERS.</li>
    <li> Tried the product at the start of vacation...in case I really messed up my hair could grow back some. Easy to use and did a nice job. But I don&#x27;t think it came with all the different size attachments. Also, hand mirror is really too small to be very useful.</li>
    <li> The price was good, for what all you get with this set.I love the hair clippers, the case, and all that is included except the trimmer; the \\&quot;trimmer\\&quot; is useless....</li>
    <li> the only bad comment I have for this product is that it is a bit loud. other than that, works very well.</li>
    <li> I have purchased two sets of these. I thought that perhaps the first set was defective and I had gone past the warranty time. Based on a price I bought a second set. Let me tell you the many clippers that a battery-operated junk. Once you take them apart to clean them they do not go back together again successfully. Customer service that Whal is nonexistent. These are cheap imported crap!!! Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Do exactly the job the way it supposed to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of accessories (27 pieces). Complete set comes with everything inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great Bargain!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good Brand!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product because I wanted something I could use to cut my sons hair (I like to keep it really short) and my husbands hair (he likes it longer on top).  This set comes with a wonderful set of combs that give you a lot of options.  Overall I am very happy with the quality of these clippers and the combs that came with it.  The clippers are very quiet (this was very important to me because my son is 8 months old and the noise of our old clippers scared him) and cut very smooth and evenly.  I love the little trimmer for cleaning up around the neck, ears and side burns.  The hair clips and scissors are low quality...I threw them away after I tried to use them on my husbands hair.  So if you are buying this set because it includes those items, I would get a different clipper set.  But if you are looking for all of the attachment pieces and a great set of clippers you will be very happy!</li>
    <li> 2 more haircuts and it&#x27;s paid for! Best of all were the quality and price! It took just minutes to master and I love my haircut!</li>
    <li> The clipper that came in this set were useless. After just one use, it stopped working.   The trimmer however was quite good. I have been using it for a few months now and has worked quite well.</li>
    <li> I never really cut my own hair needless to say i was a little scared but i got these for a awsome price and fast in a few days after ordering these i got them i open them up and i was all smiles i cut my hair for the first time and it was so easy the guides made it easy and in less then a month they payed for them self&#x27;s i went for spending 60 bucks a month on hair cuts to doing it my self the trimmers are cool to a must have if your a do it yourselfer like me</li>
    <li> I purchased this kit for my niece, ... who is intersted in cosmetology.  This kit gives her a number of tools that as she learns more, can upgrade each device piece by piece.  This is a great starter kit.</li>
    <li> Wahl is a great brand, the Deluxe Chrome Pro has everything I need for hair cut. The quality is very good. I highly recommend this product if you are looking for some handy hair-cut tools.</li>
    <li> This hair cutting kit works very well and has everything needed to achieve a quality home hair cut. Works much better than my old clippers. I&#x27;m very satisified with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I had a $10 Vidal Sassoon Clipper which was plain painful to use, used to tangle my hair, wasn&#x27;t sharp enough, used to make a mess and would take forever to cut hair. This Wahl is everything that Vidal Sassoon wasn&#x27;t. I bought this after much research and almost to point of resigning myself to getting my hair cut by a stylist.    In short, the cutting surface is sharp and powerful, like the ones used in salons (I used to wonder how is it that the stylists clippers cut so effortlessly compared to mine) and in my case just 1 pass of this clipper was enough to cut it to the level I want. What used to take 1 hour to cut now takes only about 10 minutes, and I was able to do it on my own! It has many attachments and extras which may or may not useful but the clipper itself is a gem -- powerful and painless.</li>
    <li> Works great for my needs. Adequate choices for desired length. So far my accomplishments are \\&quot;Buzz\\&quot; hair cuts and neck and side burn trims. Easy to do and looked very good. Saved a bundle of money. More than paid for the clippers. I recommend this item.</li>
    <li> This product and the instructions are everything Wahl claims. I say this is a definite buy.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000I1S18Y Wahl 79524-1001 Deluxe Chrome Pro with Multi-Cut Clipper &amp; Trimmer, 27 Pieces]]  High quality product. Works very well. It&#x27;s versatile and easy to handle. Now I&#x27;m going to get my haircut at home and avoid the time and cost of going to the barber. Would like to have the battery powered trimmer slightly larger powered by a C or D cell battery.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for about 4 weeks now.  One more buzz cut and I&#x27;ve paid for the trimmers!  It took my wife a couple of times to get used to trimming my hair, but now she is amazed at her work and how easy it is to use the trimmers..... I do a #2 buzz all over the head.    So far the trimmers have cut well and seem to be a quality product.</li>
    <li> Since I bought this clipper set my husband never even pays for a haircut anymore. The Coopers are professional grade and do a really great job. I love that it has almost every accessory you could even think of for really great price.</li>
    <li> Well i wanted something for personal use .... thinking this would be good for personal use so ordered ... but it can very well stand for a professional hair cutter.... its amazing ... quality is also really good ....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve cut my husband&#x27;s hair for almost 14 years.  I started with a Wahl kit when we first got married, but the clipper was a bit heavy.  When I saw a Conair kit on sale, I bought that and used it for a few years, but one day the motor of the clipper died during the middle of the cut which made my husband very nervous.  Luckily, we remembered that we still had the older Wahl clipper and I was able to finish the cut without a hitch.    After the Conair trimmer died, I knew I should get another clipper.  I also knew I could trust the Wahl name, so I decided to buy a whole new kit - mostly because it was on sale.  This purchase was well worth it.  The little Wahl trimmer consistently works 10 times better than the Conair trimmer ever did and just uses AA batteries so there&#x27;s no cord to deal with.  The big clipper surprised me... it weighs almost as much as the old one we bought almost 14 years ago.  After using the new clipper, we decided that maybe they just can&#x27;t make it much lighter and keep the quality high (which seemed to be Conair&#x27;s problem: lighter, but less quality).    In a nutshell:  1.  It&#x27;s a great kit.    2.  The little trimmer is light, powerful, and easy to use.  3.  The big clipper is not-so-light, powerful, and works great.  4.  The case and other accessories are nice.  5.  Yes, I recommend it.</li>
    <li> this got great reviews, maybe cause my hair was damp it seemed like a real chore to shave down, my last buzzer was great don&#x27;t remember what it was though, this one is heavy and corded, catches on sink and the extra trimmer seems really cheap and required a double aa battery so it&#x27;s not that strong, first item I got off amazon that I&#x27;ve been unhappy with it worked but took a long time and didn&#x27;t do that good a job, needed to use the scissor to finish it off, if I bought local I&#x27;d return it, though they&#x27;d probably charge me a restock fee for amazon and only give me partial payment back and charge me for shipping back, so I&#x27;ll take the loss and inconvenience, luckily I should only have to endure this every six months or so.  Buy one local so you can return it if unliked is my advice.  this is an update, I trimmed spots I missed while my hair was dry and it worked much better.</li>
    <li> This thing is a joke. I just received it in the mail and tried it out. The cape is literally trashbag plastic with a string on it. The scissors feel like they are disposable. The mirror is for dolls. The accessories obviously were made by the lowest bidder. I have owned two Wahl products in the past and felt happy with previous purchases. I will no longer buy Wahl products without trialing them first.   My favorite part was that they tried wave the Made in America flag. Most of the funk was made in China and assembled in US (just put in the box?). Wow. 100% pure funk.  Strangest of all was that I looked at the ratings on Amazon. and showed that they were solid. Must have a bunch of folks overseas contracted with Wahl to write stuff.  I think Amazon should stop selling this product. Perhaps a better marker of buyer satisfaction is how often folks send an item back. I am sending mine back today...they day I got it.</li>
    <li> I bought this in the beginning of the year, the first few I used the 1 clip and everything was good and as I started using the upper clips I noticed that it was very flimsy and not sturdy enough to use to cut hair, and that each clip was not the same as the others some had see through numbers, some were small print and some were big print, like they grabbed them from different series of clippers. I decided to actually buy this particular brand because of the (almost) silence of the clippers I heard off of my uncles, once I got mine, oiled the blades, chose my clip, and started buzzing my boyfriends hair, did the line up everything was good. Then the next day my brother asked me to buzz his hair, I was excited to show him the silence of the product, but when I turned it on it made a noise so loud that it was worse than other clippers I had used. So now when I use my clippers I dont know if its going to be silent or if its going to scream at me, I even tried to tweek it using the side screw but no luck. And so after using it for a few months I noticed the blade kept going crooked, so I tried to realign it but it keeps going back crooked, so now when I cut hair it looks like I missed hairs on my boyfriends head. And FYI I take really good care of my clippers with cleaning, oiling so I know its not me. I would ask for a refund, but I think its a little to late to return:/. But there is one thing I like from the whole product is the trimmer, I use them to do line ups ( since no clip cuts the skin ), trim my boyfriends mustache, trim his eyebrows, line up his beard ( yes I know hes a pampered man:) ). So all around in this review the trimmer is the star of the product, wish I could say this about the whole product, but in my experience its true.</li>
    <li> Thats why you buy it, right. I went for the upgrade to this model and it works great for my balding head.The little portable is also great for quick touch up. The mirror and scissor are a joke. Now if I can find someone to cut my hair I,d be in business.</li>
    <li> After using Wahl clippers that had been used since the 1940s to trim my husband&#x27;s hair, his brothers&#x27; hair, his sons&#x27; hair, his grandsons&#x27; hair and of course his own hair which was clipped by his wife by this time and up until just a few weeks ago    -- no kidding!  when the clippers had to be pronounced as worn out and finally just quit cutting hair it was time to purchase another one.  Wahl, of course.  With a change of blades and a drop or two of oil, it might have continued on for .... who knows how long?</li>
    <li> I ordered this thing from the amazon.Please dont sell this product no more.It does&#x27;not even work.When I see it and i felt like stupid.</li>
    <li> Good stuff very well made in the good old U.S.A. The set came with good lnstructions and a handy dandy carrying case.</li>
    <li> Definitely a great set of clippers and attachments that come in a convenient storage case, but the only thing that isn&#x27;t included is a set of ear plugs.  When I first used the clippers (as well as each subsequent use), I was amazed at how extremely loud they were. Thankfully, I had a pair of foam ear plugs and now I wear them each time I use the clippers. I shouldn&#x27;t have to, but that is all that makes using the clippers bearable.  Quality product, just way too loud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---UPDATE---&lt;br /&gt;Still love the product and after a few uses the loudness went away and functions similar to any clipper you would see in a barber shop. The angled attachments make blending my hair simple (for those times I don&#x27;t feel like going to the barber). Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I use this to cut my hair as well as trim my beard.  Used it three times so far and works great.</li>
    <li> Pays for itself with two hair cuts. Very easy to use, even when cutting your own hair. Works great and has a ton of attachments to cut hair to any length.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed at the quality of this product. The clipper attachments were flimsy and bent from side to side when in use requiring you to stop and straighten them out. Also the clipper just didn&#x27;t cut that well. Compared to my old clipper the quality and evenness of the cut was very poor. I returned the product</li>
    <li> The clippers seemed fine but the rest of this kit: scissors, cape, etc.. is CHEAP. The cape ripped the first time I used it and the scissors stuck together as I used them. You are better off buying the clippers and then finding the rest some where else.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for people who want to cut their own hair.  It works really well, and the little battery operated trimmer is a great little tool.  I use it for shaving every five days.</li>
    <li> The clipper works great, just like any other clipper. The length options are good as well and typical. However, i believe that there should be some adjustments for the trimmer. There wouldn&#x27;t be a need for extra parts, just make either the trimmer compatible with the clipper adjustments OR the clipper adjustments compatible with the trimmer. Also, I use this at work and so I carry it around in a bag. Be sure to take out the battery, because it easily turns on and can wear out very very quickly. There should be some sort of locking setting so this won&#x27;t happen.</li>
    <li> These clippers simply just do not cut close enough for me, and they also appear to be cheaply made. I wish I never wasted my money on this cheap bundle. Next time I&#x27;ll spend a few extra bucks and buy a professional model, something similar to what the barbers cut hair with.</li>
    <li> Shopped around for this purchase...Style and durability was a must,and at this price,you&#x27;ve met all my expectations again!&lt;br /&gt;The quality of this clipper&amp;trimmer set,surprised us once again Amazon.com,especially the price!No more Barber shop for my men!And with the hair grooming savings in my home, I&#x27;ll be able to treat myself to a purchase!</li>
    <li> These clippers are great. They run smooth and cut great everything came with the product and works like professional clippers.</li>
    <li> When turn on makes a horrible sound. When i brought it, i thought the cover was metallic, but not, PLASTIC</li>
    <li> I purchased these clippers about 5 months ago to start cutting my own hair. I got about 6 good haircuts with it, but unfortunately ran into one large issue. The more I used it, the gradually harder it was to move the power switch on and off. Eventually, the power switch jammed completely, and I was no longer able to turn the thing on. I sent the clipper to Wahl to get it repaired, paying around 15 dollars for shipping, and got it back around 2 weeks later. I used the clippers twice since then, and now the power switch is back to being jammed. This thing is no better than a paper-weight to me now. I really regret purchasing this clipper, and will be purchasing a new pair from a different brand sometime very soon.</li>
    <li> My husband has had no problems with the set and he loves it. He used to go get his hair cut and with doing it himself. Not to mention, he&#x27;s already paid for it and will continue to pay for it over and over again. :)</li>
    <li> This is a well known brand in hair clippers and lot of proffessionals use them so I thought It would be safer buying what I suppose to be a high quality product. I bought this set a year ago for home use. Just a couple hair cuts a month which it should last some years without breaking down. I keep by the book all recommendations for safety and good care. However  a continuous loud noise started suddenly (like something was lose inside). I took it to a wahl representative in my country and he told me that he wasn´t able to fix it because that sound came from the springs inside and those replacement parts are not available. He somehow managed to low the noise but it still feels very discomforting hair cutting with that sound around your head. I talked to a professional hair cutter and she told me that when that happens to her she just trow the clipper away and buy another one. So, in my oppinion, if you look for some clipper that lasts do not buy this one. I should have rated one but I was very happy with mine until this happen so I rather rate it with 2 stars.</li>
    <li> I have been buzz cutting my own hair for years now and my old Wahl was a true champ.  I decided to retire it and bought this one...  Meh.  It is decent looking and comfortable in the hand but the bottom line is that it misses hairs regularly.  Sometimes I catch them right away and for others 2 or 3 days later I will be brushing my teeth and notice a single hair sticking out twice as long as all the others.  Is it annoying enough to replace it?  Nah.  Would I do it again?  Nah.</li>
    <li> Excellent service!  This item has all the bells and whistles you need for trimming and cutting hair.  Great buy!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s saved me dozens of salon visits! Paid for itself in a month or two. Tip: Wahl website has basic hair cut guides that got us started.</li>
    <li> I bought mine 2 weeks ago and i did not use it until last night.  You can qualify for the $5 rebate at their website, but very few people would know about it unless they visit the     I had used wahl a couple times before, and i was always impressed by its functionality.    This kit is simply awesome although the parts appear really cheap, like the body cover and the mirror, but idc.    I was really hoping that they would include the size 10 and 12 but it seems that you must call up Wahl and purcahse it then which really sucks..    IT COMES WITH A 5 YR Warranty, i hope their customer service will be good    This is how i see it.    I get a hair cut once a month. With this i will get atleast 10 haircuts a year &#x3D; $150 saved    and in the 5 year which i intend to use this i will have saved $750 on haircuts.</li>
    <li> These clippers did not make it through one hair cut.  We obviously were given a bad set because the actual clippers literally fell apart in my wife&#x27;s hands as she was cutting my hand.  The casing around the clippers came off as she was trimming exposing all of the interal wires.  We were able to finish the cut (very carefully without electricuting either of us) before we sent the clippers back that day.  These clippers got a high review from other purchases, that&#x27;s why we bought them, but it obviously didn&#x27;t work out for us.  They did cut very smooth when it was working.  Also, my wife complained about them vibrating so much it put her arm to sleep.  Two stars for the smooth cut.</li>
    <li> Have Bought Many Walmart clippers before and they barely cut and after a year are dull and don&#x27;t work.    This Clipper is very sharp and all the attachments are worth it</li>
    <li> My wife uses this to cut our family&#x27;s hair.  It seems heavy duty enough for family use.  (Obviously a pro would want something more substantial.)  Recommended.</li>
    <li> This is my first time with a set of actual hair clippers, although I have used the smaller trimmers that take a razor blade or something similar.  I expected to go down to a smaller  attachment but when I got down to a 5, I decided that it looked good and so I quit while I was ahead.  (Pun intended.)  There is a wide variety of attachments and I really like the smaller clipper that uses a battery and is handy for light trimming around the ears and neck.  The mirror included is small, but I have 2 larger mirrors to use so that is not a problem for me.  I debated for a long time about getting a full set of clippers and attachments but after reading the comments on Amazon and watching some of the videos on You Tube of people doing their own hair I finally decided to get a set of clippers.  The  option of doing your own hair whenever you want is an advantage and convenience.</li>
    <li> the edges of the clipper hurt your face/head ( they are not smooth )&lt;br /&gt;i had the cheaper version( which they don&#x27;t make anymore) and that was way better but i dropped and broke it so im stuck with this for now</li>
    <li> Excellent product --- I am thrilled that I purchased it --- and at such a great price!</li>
    <li> Cuts very well.  As good as you will find at a great value.  As always Amazon is the best store around.</li>
    <li> The unit arrived in good shape with all included items. While this offering by Wahl does have a few more included items overall its the same Wahl trimmer that can be had at around $20 here on Amazon and at most discount stores. The &#x27;powerful&#x27; motor sounds and acts exactly like a $20 model we have had for a year.     If you are looking for a more robust or capable model by Wahl this is not the one you will want to purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought this clipper after seeing that it got great reviews, and had an instant $10 off coupon attached to it.  I really like the portable trimmer for my neck and sideburns, and the main clipper has all of the pieces that you could ever need.     The reason I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars - I had to return the first one, because it got rust on the main clipper.  I didn&#x27;t run it over any water, but I did use the oil that was included but not a lot.  Amazon was great with the return, and I&#x27;m very happy with my new one.</li>
    <li> A bought it as gift for my fiance he said the clipper worked excellent but the trimmer did not function as good.</li>
    <li> I often go without shaving my face for a week, sometimes two.  Shaving with a blade then becomes a 30 minute (or longer) ordeal, as the blade clogs with hair after every inch or less of the razor&#x27;s path.  The Wahl hair clipper set to its shortest length makes short work of cutting the beard down to a one-day stubble which can either be shaved with a blade or left uncut as is popular these days.</li>
    <li> this clipper was missing the two screws which hold it together, and therefore the back of the clipper came right off, revealing the wires inside. I have not yet contacted the manufacturer, so I do not know how their service is. In addition, despite the clippers being labeled \\&quot;chrome\\&quot; they are made out of plastic, something that becomes evident when they come apart... which is why they really should have included the screws</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned 3 of the old clippers including a Wahl. This is the quietest one I&#x27;ve used. It doesn&#x27;t have the vibrations the old ones had either, which bothered one son alot when I cut his hair. Another son has used it to trim up his whiskers too and found it great for that! It doesn&#x27;t pull like razors can! I can&#x27;t think of anything wrong with the trimmer at all.     The storage case would have been better if it was hard bodied and had a way to put the guide combs so they were easier to select from.</li>
    <li> Great for the price, and the little battery operated trimmer is fantastic. I am a licensed cosmetologist who cuts childrens hair, and the size and versitility of the small trimmers are worth it&#x27;s weight in gold.</li>
    <li> (This first paragraph was added on 12-30-2008) As an opening note - the clippers are actually made right here in the USA and not China.  Sure there are a few Chinese parts in the kit but by and large it&#x27;s American!  I could change the title to, \\&quot;Great Wahl of Sterling, Illinois\\&quot; but that doesn&#x27;t exactly roll off of the tongue - y&#x27;know?  Now on to the original review in its entirety and totally commercial free:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the past several months I have been contemplating taking matters into my own hands and just shaving my noggin at home and saving a trip to the barber/salon/blood letter.  After consulting with friends and colleagues and with my own experience with the brand I settled on a Wahl trimmer.  Once my decision was made I guided myself to Amazon to start the search.  After looking at the different kits and options I settled on the Deluxe Chrome kit with 27 pieces.  I don&#x27;t know about you but when I see the words &#x27;Deluxe&#x27; and &#x27;Chrome&#x27; in the same sentence you have my undivided attention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered-up the kit and thanks to some technical wizardry and a dash of PRIME the clippers arrived in 2-days.  I was pleasantly surprised when I opened up the box to find a nice black zippered case complete with the clippers, the smaller clippers (for neckline, sideburns, etc.), a plethora of guards ranging from the cue-ball to 1\\&quot; in length, over-the-ear trimmer guides (left and right), an eyebrow guide as well as combs, scissors, a hand-held mirror, a drape and clip, clipper blade oil and a brush for keeping the unit clean and in tip-top shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I decided on an appropriate guard and clipped it onto the clippers.  There is a good snug fit which is met with an audible &#x27;click&#x27; assuring you that the clipper guard is properly set.  I then stretched out the amply long cord (maybe 6 feet long??) and plugged in the clippers.  I clicked on the unit fully expecting something quite loud.  Happily I was wrong.  These clippers are extremely quiet and very stable and steady in your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the real fun.  I started buzzing into my hair like a crazed minnow farmer (?) watching my trimmed locks falling into the tub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:  I did this while seated in our large garden tub... there was NO WATER in the tub but I thought this would be a good place for a haircut as the clean-up would be a snap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I worked the clippers through my hair going from back to front; front to back; then side to side until the desired effect was achieved.  My Bride and our two angelic cherubs soon made an appearance to see just what Daddy was doing.  Happily my wife totally approved of the look, the cut and the cleanliness of the finished product.  My Bride took the smaller clippers, plopped-in an AA battery and did a bang-up job cleaning up my neck area as well as around my ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clean-up was a snap.  I just took off the guard, used the included brush and cleaned off all of the trimmer heads.  After cleaning-up I packed everything away in the black case and was readying myself to hop out of the tub.  My Bride had brought in our Dyson (sidebar:  if you&#x27;ve never used a Dyson vacuum you are missing out on one of the finer pleasures on earth) which made quick work of sucking up my hair out of the tub.  Our girls enjoyed watching Daddy&#x27;s hair swirling in the clear Dyson canister.  They are easily amused.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line - the Wahl trimmer/clipper is a great tool, quiet and efficient and priced better than I could find locally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh - and by the time I cut my hair with this twice - it&#x27;s paid for!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Edited on 12-30-2008 to add:) I have owned these clippers for approximately 388 days (or for you stats geeks out there):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  * 33,523,200 seconds&lt;br /&gt;  * 558,720 minutes&lt;br /&gt;  * 9312 hours&lt;br /&gt;  * 55 weeks (rounded down)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and it&#x27;s been nothing but a great experience.  If I were to hazard a guess I have used them 9 or 10 times so they are WELL paid for.  The unit operatesas it did fresh out of the box, the cut is still great and nothing has been pitched aside or thrown away... except for my cut off hair, of course. I&#x27;ve not used all of the guards but have settled on a few &#x27;go to guards&#x27; that made the cut with me (pun).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I still stand by my original assessment of the clippers and would buy them again knowing what I now know.  Great item.  Great investment.  Great ROI (Return On Investment).n away... except for my cut off hair, of course. I&#x27;ve not used all of the guards but have settled on a few &#x27;go to guards&#x27; that made the cut with me (pun).

    <li> I have owned a dozen or so clippers over the years.  This is the most I have ever paid for the lowest quality.  The previous one I bought cost $13 and lasted five years, it was the same size as a professional clipper.  I saw this kit and thought I was in for a treat.  The clipper is about 60% as big as I am used to.  The guards are very flimsy.  The oil dispenser broke as the plastic container is a micron thick.  The &#x27;mirror&#x27; is like a barbie toy, seriously.... silver paint on a mirror shaped plastic base?  silver paint &#x3D;/&#x3D; mirror.  I will never buy a wahl product ever again.  Anyone saying this is four or five stars, I saw one say \\&quot;Just Like the Pros\\&quot;... you have never seen another clipper or you are being paid to post reviews.  This is a ridiculous piece of garbage.  At least I got a really good laugh at the &#x27;mirror&#x27;</li>
    <li> Great product, but I had a mix-up with my order and received a different brand device. I had to return it and purchase the same model elsewhere to meet my deadline.</li>
    <li> Love it it works great very easy to use and all the pieces was there. very light and easy to travel with</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a pair of Wahl trimmers for a long time in retail stores, with no luck I turned to Amazon.  Got the clippers at are real good price, and the chrome accients are very nice.  I would suggest this product for anyone who uses clippers.</li>
    <li> I was a shipped a used item initially. I returned it and requested another one.  Again got shipped a refurbished item with mirror broken and scratches on the clipper.    Wahl is just pushing their returned goods through Amazon.  Amazon services are excellent and probably are not even aware of the contents Wahl is shipping to customers.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a lot of sets of clippers before and most of them were cheap and junky. This set is not of that kind; these run great, smoothly, even feels like quality in your hand. Cut easy and has easy care.</li>
    <li> Buy a complete set of these in May 13, 2008 and is still alive and without any problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With 4 years and 7 months is a time long enough to say that this product is recommended.</li>
    <li> Multi-cut trimmer is quite heavy but does the job.  The little trimmer that comes along with it is a waste.</li>
    <li> I bought these clippers about 4 months ago and I have probably cut my hair with them about 6 or 7 times.  After this period of time, they immediately went bad or dull and it kept snagging my hair (I normally have short hair).  They were abnormally loud and my wife was warning me not to use them.  Not listening to my better half, I used the clippers, I had to torture myself by finish up and it was very painful.  Afterwards, I immediately threw those clippers away and I would never buy Wahl products again.  A complete waste of money!</li>
    <li> Trimmer works well and only uses one battery.  It cuts clean and is just what I need to trim neck hairs.</li>
    <li> This product is what I was looking for. It is hard to find a clipper that is good enough to shave your head. This works perfect and comes with a smaller clipper which is great for getting your ears and touch ups on your head.</li>
    <li> These are great clippers, definitly worth the investment.  My husband used these as a boy growing up and he is now 31 and finally had to replace them... they lasted that long.  He shaves his head so he uses them every 2-3 days.  We bought the exact same thing again.  This brand is great!  Highly reccommended.</li>
    <li> I have had these clippers for 6 years and they still work as new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con: the trimmer is crappy! I didn&#x27;t feel that these clippers deserved a star less because everything else is great. I love these clippers!</li>
    <li> We love this trimming kit.  We use it for personal trimming, and the small trimmer is great for small places.  It will knick if you aren&#x27;t careful, so use caution.  Storage case is nice as well.</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd clipper in last 4 yrs. The earlier clippers are no longer working, don&#x27;t know what exactly the problem was. I bought this clipper after one of my friend suggested it. As of now its working fine, though I am not a professional hair cutter but it works good for me.    Thanks to suresh(my friend).    regds  sachin</li>
    <li> This set pays for itself after only a few haircuts, while allowing you to trim, reshape, or style in between haircuts to always look good. The clipper itself is of high quality and feels elegant and has an ergonomic shape to fit your hand. One of the main reasons why I purchased this deluxe set was that it comes with the additional extra clipper, which was awesome the first few haircuts to easily clean up the neck, around the ears, and hairline. However, after just a few haircuts it started randomly not turning on, and now it doesn&#x27;t seem to at all. That is why I gave it 4 stars. Also adding to the number of stars was that the mirror is of cheap materials and a little small, but a mirror is a mirror I guess. As well as the cape, which feels and looks like a large white trash bag with strings. As long as they do their job, I&#x27;m fine, although I guess I was expecting a higher quality from those two pieces. One more thing since I cut my hair very short and therefore need to blend very well is that I wish a deluxe set would include a size 0.5\\&quot; and 1.5\\&quot; blade guard rather than just jumping a full size (i.e. size 1 to 2). Otherwise, these are all minor details that would usually give this set 5 stars...just the non-functional small clippers dropped it to 4, although this may just be a problem with mine. Good investment tho!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*UPDATE*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dropped my clipper and the blade broke. However, now this set gets 5 Stars. It is because of the excellent service Wahl provides as a warranty, it is 5 years for this! I sent in my large clipper with the broken blade and the little extra shaver that stopped working to Wahl and they fixed both at no charge (other than shipping to them of course). As a bonus, they also sent me a new cape which is of much better quality than the original as well as sending me the 2 blade guards I wanted for free (just ask and they&#x27;ll gladly send them to you...otherwise they are $5 each on their website). Excellent service plus anytime it breaks in the next 5 years I will easily get it fixed. 5 STARS.</li>
    <li> This is a great package at a great price. My girlfriend has been using it to cut my hair for a few months now, and the money we&#x27;ve saved has more than paid for this set. I get a buzz cut, but there are plenty of supplies here for more complex hairstyles. Overall, terrific investment.</li>
    <li> This Wahl clipper and trimmer set is awesome. I bought it to maintain my facial hair as well as my normal hair. It does great on both, trimmer is very detailed and cuts great. The clippers are quite, they cut great with no troubles. I liked this so much that I bought the same set for a friend of mine, that had a passion for cutting hair. She loves her set, as well. The set comes in a nice little zip up organizer keeping everything nice and neat. If you buy this you will love it.</li>
    <li> i have owned Wahl clippers and trimmer/liners before and this is just not up to their usual standards. i think this is a cheaply made bundle to cash in on the bargain consumer rather than a good set for a great deal.  the plastic pieces to adjust the length were mostly bent out of shape right out of the box. the clippers don&#x27;t cut anywhere near as well as my previous Wahl clippers. same thing with the trimmer. as a matter of fact the trimmer is so small it makes it mistake prone when trimming around the neck and side burn areas.  i&#x27;m disappointed that i went for a cheap bundle when i should&#x27;ve bout a quality set like the one i had before.</li>
    <li> A good set. So far, the best I ever had. Clipper is comfortable, does not get hot like others and cuts very well the hair. Trimmer is a little noise</li>
    <li> The Pros:This iteam is great. The Wahl Deluxe Chrome Pro  clipper feel great. It have an ergonomic feel to it. The carring case is nice and compact. It has pockets and storage spaces for all 27 pieces. It should be enough to cut any style hair.  &lt;br /&gt;The Cons: The Batter operated trimmer Goes throuh batteries like crazy. &lt;br /&gt;Currently I&#x27;m in Iraq and with the conversion my clippers are extreamly loud when i cutting my hair. I dont know if its a conversion problem from 220v to 110v. &lt;br /&gt; Over all I am satified with my purchase.</li>
    <li> The item was shipped quicker than stated, much quicker. The product is factory new and works like a champ. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I have now used the clippers a couple of times and can say that they are a great product.  It was very sturdy in my hand and felt like a professional quality trimmer.  There was no jamming or binding of the clippers - it glided through my hair with no problems (although I do have fairly thin hair, hence I cut it very short).  I only used the trimmer and not any of the attachments - I cut my hair very short using the blade only and no length guide - so I can&#x27;t comment on those.  However, I must agree with other posters that the case could use some work - all of the pieces pretty much fly around loose in the case and there really isn&#x27;t a good way to store everthing.  Wahl should have designed the case differently, so that there would be a place to put each accessory (kind of like how a CD binder works).  Again, this doesn&#x27;t affect me much since I don&#x27;t use the attachments.   I highly recommend these clippers and would recommend to a friend in the market for doing their own trimming at home.    July 2008 Update: Still using these clippers every week to keep the close cropped look and they work great.  Just brush them off and oil the blades with the included brush and oil after each use and put them back in the drawer.  I&#x27;m able to get the whole head in about 5-10 minutes.  I just clip in the shower stall before I shower, scoop up the cut hair and wash the rest down the drain.  And the included mini-clipper is great for getting a very close cut on the back of the neck and sideburns.  It isn&#x27;t meant for much more than that, but does a great job - I use it about 1-2x a month and haven&#x27;t had to change the battery yet (8 months later).</li>
    <li> I have been through a lot of hair clippers and this is one of the best choices personally.  Cuts very smoothly and some of the attachments help and come in handy.  I recommend it for any beginner just starting out and those who have experienced many failed machines.  This product will be of greay use.</li>
    <li> Lots of power. I like the storage bag it comes in. I Would buy again.</li>
    <li> My wife and I cut each others hair and having owned other brands nothing comes close to the quality of the Wahl clipper. Price is great and made in the USA is great to. Replacement blades are even available. Great investment.</li>
    <li> This is the best pair of clippers i ever bought.  They work well and now i do not have to travel so far to the barber shop with gas prices so up.</li>
    <li> I purchased this trimmer to use on my husband&#x27;s hair.  Having NEVER used one before I was both amazed at how well it worked, and MY ability...I&#x27;m so good now that I even trim my grandsons hair!!!</li>
    <li> Compared to my older trimmers the Wahl is built much better.  It is easy to use and has many attachments to choose from.  The only problem I encountered while doing my sons hair was that it can actually draw blood.  I took off the attachments and was trying to clean up around the front of the ear when I nicked him.  Then doing the other ear I got him again.  The old trimmers just didn&#x27;t have the power to do something like that so I was caught off guard.  All in all I think they are good trimmers but just require a little more care then other trimmers.</li>
    <li> This set of clippers is great for the money.  Nice and quiet when turned on.</li>
    <li> When I bought these, I got them for around $30 for the set.  I&#x27;ve been using a different set to cut my son&#x27;s hair and was in need for a new set.  This set has been great so far.  It cuts well and I don&#x27;t have to go over the same area a few times like I did with my old clippers.  To the person who said it cut her son&#x27;s skin... I have no clue how she would have done that if she was using them properly.</li>
    <li> Before purchasing the Wahl kit I reviewed several clippers on Amazon and various other sites.  It was an anniversary gift to my boyfriend to help him start saving some money.  For being two college kids with no hair cutting experience the Wahl worked extremely well.  It was easy to hold, and a powerful machine.  I was able to give my boyfriend an excellent haircut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a warning about using it: you have to press pretty hard against the head to make sure it&#x27;s an even cut.  That makes sense when you think about it because if you were to just glide along above a scalp, your 3/4 inch is more like 5/8 and it can make your scalp look goofy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were so surprised that the oil spray bottle came full and ready to go, and that it came with a drop cloth for hair.  It is a wonderful kit for beginners and it paid for itself in just 1 month.</li>
    <li> These clippers work very well.  I am very please with the way they cut hair and how easy they are to handle.  Nice.</li>
    <li> So easy to use even for a first timer. I became a barber overnight. It does an excellent job. Easy to handle, quiet with good instruction on how to cut hair.</li>
    <li> Well, what can I say, except that this is a solid, professional-grade clipper, and although it&#x27;s loud (which is why I gave it 4 stars), it&#x27;s great for trimming head hair, facial hair or any other hair.  I haven&#x27;t tried the trimmer, but I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s just as fantastic.  I&#x27;d recommend this product since I know I&#x27;ll be using it for years.  Bottom line: great value, solid product.</li>
    <li> I used to get my hair cut once every 2-3 weeks, at over 15$ per cut with tip. I&#x27;m so mad at myself for not buying one of these sooner. I did 2 trial runs with my brother-in-law&#x27;s version from another company and ironed out all the kinks in my tactic, and now on the third try with my own, I&#x27;m practically a pro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This unit feels and functions just like a real barbershop buzzer. Very sturdy but not overly heavy. I had no problem 1 handing it behind my head and I&#x27;m no bodybuilder! The main cutting plate is solid steel and when you turn it on, it really makes the same hard CLUNK sound that the professional ones do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buzzing the sides and back with a #2, the hair clumped together in balls that I easily slide into the sink, so it didn&#x27;t get all over the bathroom. Remember to gather all this hair with a tissue and throw away at the end! or your sink will be clogged in no time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only owned it a week and used it once so I can&#x27;t comment on it&#x27;s longevity, but I have a feeling this purchase will definitely pay for itself a few hundred times over before it dies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This package btw is the same as the more expensive one listed here but comes with the attachments and it&#x27;s cheaper! I haven&#x27;t tried the little extra guy that comes with it though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also as a side note, it comes with all number buzzer levels up to 8! I didn&#x27;t even know they made an 8. So after I was done with my sides, I used that one on the top of my head and it gave just the right amount of trim so that I didn&#x27;t even have to use a scissor on the top. Its easily still about a 1-1.5 inches long up there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely get this unit and stop paying for haircuts!</li>
    <li> a great product.  Works well, has lots of useful accessories and was a reasonable price</li>
    <li> These clippers came with nice attachments and a nice bag.  They work good but wow they are loud.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to cut my son&#x27;s hair. The first time I used it my son complained saying that it was pulling his hair. I didn&#x27;t know what was wrong so I went to read the instructions. I noticed that the clipper blades were not aligned like the one in the picture. I fixed it and after that my son did not complain anymore. I think the clipper does an okay cutting.</li>
    <li> the machines are great(big and small one). but i have a problem with the plastic accessories(mostly the detachable combs for the machine), most are too big and they are damaged from the machine easily. if they were metal it would have been prefect.the big one is a bit noisy, but i can live with that for now. great product though.</li>
    <li> I use this to cut my own hair and it works great! Have tried others and this is the best yet, would definately recomend!</li>
    <li> I bought this to trim my son&#x27;s hair.  I was really looking forward to using a kit that had all I needed in it, and I thought this was it.  The pieces included with the clipper are nice, and the outward appearance of all of the items gives the impression that they&#x27;re well-made.  However, I was shocked the first time I turned the clipper on - it drove my wife and dog out of the room and I immediately turned it off.  I couldn&#x27;t believe it was that loud!  Even after adjusting the \\&quot;power screw\\&quot; to the correct adjustment (loosen until you hear the clattering sound, and then tighten until the clattering goes away), the clipper was still too loud to be used next to someone&#x27;s head.  Adjusting until the clipper is operating at an acceptable volume renders the blades nearly immobile.  It&#x27;s not the pleasant buzzing that you hear when sitting in the barber&#x27;s chair - it sounds like a piece of construction equipment!  I guess this proves the adage \\&quot;you get what you pay for.\\&quot;  I would gladly pay 20-30 dollars more for something that won&#x27;t leave my kids deaf after they get their hair cut!  My recommendation is to look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Purchased the Wahl to cut my husband&#x27;s hair. Previously we used a Conair but the Wahl is far sturdier. It feels good in the hand and the cut is superior. I love all the different attachments and carry case is great to keep everything organized. It is well worth the money.</li>
    <li> We have used this to cut my hair for years now and it still works great. We have saved hundreds in hair cut costs. Not to mention the convenience.</li>
    <li> I bought these clippers almost three years ago, still work great.  Just keep them cleaned and oiled and they will last a good long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These clippers paid for themselves after three uses.</li>
    <li> We are pleased with the quality of this product as well as all the accessories that were included.  Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Saved thousands of dollars on hair trims.</li>
    <li> Hard to find hair clippers that actually work right for me.  This product exceeds my expectations.  I will definitely be purchasing this product again sometime in the future..</li>
    <li> Broke after 2 weeks of normal use. Mailed to Wahl, they fixed it broke after another week. Sent back, Wahl sent me a brand new one. Broke after 2 weeks. I am done with Wahl.</li>
    <li> The Wahl Chrome Pro is really good value for the money.  The clipper does vibrate but it&#x27;s very easy to get used to it.  As for the noise level, it&#x27;s EXACTLY the same noise level as any regular barbershop&#x27;s own tools.  I just got done shaving my hair off after attempting to do my own haircut (with a regular pair of scissors -- lesson learned) and the Wahl Chrome Pro saved me a rescue trip to the barber shop.  The result is exactly the same as I would have gotten at the barber shop except my ends around the ears and back of my head aren&#x27;t perfect, as it&#x27;s hard to do those areas when you&#x27;re cutting your own hair by yourself.    You&#x27;ll be able to cut 1\\&quot; or lower of your hair using the various clip-ons that are provided.  Also the clipper operates through electricity, so you&#x27;ll need an outlet nearby (it&#x27;s wired).  Though it&#x27;s not wireless, I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s like this because I don&#x27;t want to spend extra money for batteries.  The trimmer operates on a AA battery.  The scissors that come with it look exactly like the ones my barber shop use (but just a tad smaller).  I like that it comes with the mini spray bottle so you can dampen your hair easily without pouring water all over your hair with your hands.    I was surprised that some of the items were actually Made in the USA.  The clipper and one of the combs were both made in the USA.    Make sure you have a good area to work with because clean up can be a pain with all that hair falling down.  Washing the clippers was very fast and simple.  The clipper itself was a little tricky to clean as you don&#x27;t want to mix water and electricity but it&#x27;s manageable with Kleenex tissues.    Could the product be better?  Of course.  The case, while durable for cloth, could have been made hard for added durability.  The provided mirror could have been bigger.  They could have provided more clips (for greater than 1\\&quot;).  But all in all, the product is great for the money.  I would not hesitate in recommending the Wahl Chrome Pro to a friend.    I&#x27;ll miss going to my local barbershop, but I won&#x27;t miss spending all that money spent paying for haircuts and the agony of figuring out how much I need to tip someone for doing a job I could do at home!</li>
    <li> Works really well.  A little heavy, but that&#x27;s ok.  Way better than the clippers that I had before.  Only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is the cape that comes with it is so thin it&#x27;s like a plastic bag.  Other than that I love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never cut hair in my life but I have two boys, aged 2 and 3.  Taking them to get their hair cut is an ordeal, plus costs me $25 a visit.  I did some research and chose this pair of clippers thinking heck, it is worth a shot.  Though I was nervous about making them look like cancer patients, it was easy and they look great. I just used the longest guard and went against the \\&quot;grain\\&quot; of the hair, like the Wahl website said.   Actually, I think they look better than when I was paying someone else to do it with scissors.  And the clipper set will have paid for itself the next time I cut their hair.  Highly highly recommend.  If you&#x27;re wondering if you can do this at home--YES, you can.  I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
    <li> I bought this item because I buzz my head instead of getting hair cuts. I have owned old trimmers and this one has a lot more powerful motor than the cheaper ones. It cuts a lot better and includes all the tools you would need to get a great hair cut.</li>
    <li> good clippers, they are kinda heavy, at least from what i&#x27;m used to, but no big deal...it would hurt if you dropped it on your foot. Hubby and boys like them, they don&#x27;t pull their hair, lots of attachments, but no separate bag for them, overall, good though!</li>
    <li> Just bought it to use it to cut my dogs hair, it did ok job but not worth the price, since CONAIR is just 14 bugs at MARSHALLS or ROSS and does the same job. So, not worth the price though did the job.</li>
    <li> My husband is in nursing home, and his illness makes him so very warm most of the time. Instead of bothering a downtown beautician to come there to cut his hair every couple weeks, I knew I could do it as I&#x27;d done so before. The Wahl arrived well packaged, with everything included, on Saturday and I immediately used it to cut his hair which made him a happy fella! Many thanks for the prompt delivery!</li>
    <li> First time ever attempting a home haircut. The assortment of guides certainly made this easy for a complete novice to use. Basically, put the right guide on use it, switch to the next one and go. I used 5 of the guides total and very satisfied with the results. I used the ones that left the hair the longest first so I had room to fix anything I didn&#x27;t like but I didn&#x27;t end up needing to fix anything. I&#x27;m not sure that this is the way to go for anyone wanting over 1\\&quot; length hair but anything under 1\\&quot; and you&#x27;re set. Nice complete kit with a strong quiet motor in a nylon case with room for everything. I couldn&#x27;t have asked for better!</li>
    <li> Saved myself tons of money cutting my hair myself , wahl is the only way to go , I saved not only money but time going to the barber shop</li>
    <li> the best value for money</li>
    <li> Is a good trimmer but sometimes it pulls my beard</li>
    <li> Worked great for the first few hair cuts, but after that, get dull quickly.  We still use it because we&#x27;re cheap, but is takes several passes to get it done.</li>
    <li> Functions were alright. But every second time turned on, it made very loud and unbearable noise. Was trying to fix the loosen screws but did not find anything loosed. The article returned.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a discount store set of clippers that I paid $12 for to cut my husband&#x27;s hair for the last couple of years, so I am definitely no professional in critiquing clippers. But I used this tonight (after properly oiling the blades) and WHAT A DIFFERENCE! In one easy stroke, all the hair pieces were cleanly sliced off, as opposed to my previous clippers that took 4 or 5 strokes. It&#x27;s powerful and heavy duty. There are more than enough clippers attachments, and the scissors were even super sharp and useful. I can&#x27;t get over how inexpensive this investment was for such a great product. Thank you again Amazon!</li>
    <li> Tossed my still working 10 year old Wahl for this replacement.  Works as designed, and a great price.  Extra battery powered trimmer is a nice extra.  That too works well.</li>
    <li> What I like:  - Very powerful - I have thick hair and this clipper cuts smoothly while other clippers just chocked.  - It&#x27;s power is adjustable by a simple screw.  - Lots of guiding combs.  - The trimmer is a wonderful bonus and I bought guiding combs for it to use as a beard trimmer on travels ([...])    What I don&#x27;t like:  - The other accessories&#x27; quality is very poor - the scissors, 2 hair clips, cleaning brush, blade oil bottle, mirror, spray bottle and the cape. If you really need these items you should consider buying them separately.    Summary:  Great clipper and trimmer for a great price! I had a Whal clipper for more than 20 year and it worked amazingly well - very reliable. This one doesn&#x27;t fall behind and does a wonderful job.   I think that Whal should either improve or remove their accessories as they are doing a disservice for their clipper. Nonetheless - Five stars!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had any real issues with products from Amazon. However,this was a huge let down. The clipper came and looked used (with bits of hair all over it) just like one of the other reviews had warned. Also the free trimmer broke after about a week. Wahl is a great clipper producer, but this product was second hand and sold as new. STAY AWAY.</li>
    <li> Pure junk broke after a month</li>
    <li> This kit is simple.  It includes all the necessary equipment.  My wife cut&#x27;s my hair and I save lots of money every year.</li>
    <li> Used for several months, clean, sharp cut on head and face. Adjust nice, quiet, and no sharp edges. Small trimmer works good also but I seldom use it. Oil about once a month. I’ve used trimmers like these on my beard for over 35 years and this is probably my third and best unit.</li>
    <li> Just opened box today. Very poorly build quality with imported cheap plastic part from China. Noise level is comparable to machine gun fire. It is so loud it will scare any kids within 100 feet.  The blades are not parallel as the top blade is at an obvious angel to the bottom blade. Over heated in less than a min that&#x27;s too hot to hold. There is no way of fixing it.  Completely junk.</li>
    <li> I have always used Wahl products and always had good experiences.  I used this once with no problem.  The second time I used it the thing would begin to vibrate out of control making an extremely loud high pitched sound.  I would have to slap it against my palm to to get it to stop and sometimes it took a couple of whacks.  After I took it apart and learned that the vibrator is made out of cheesy plastic.  The piece just barely went through the slot and had enough play to slip out.  I tightened the screws as tight as I could but it kept happening.  Sometimes if you adjust the slide it will stop.    The thing is pretty quiet when it works correctly but when that plastic piece slips out and it makes that loud vibrating nose it scares the crap out of you.    I still use it and put up with it as I didn&#x27;t save my reciept.  I would avoid this one.  Maybe Wahl has a better model.  Even if you have to pay more for the better model it will be worth it as this one is not that good at all.</li>
    <li> Have only used it twice but both times it cut great... no pulling! Watch out with the ear attachments though.. it is easy to cut the hair too short, but once I get used to it I know it&#x27;ll work awesome!</li>
    <li> Cuts through my hair pretty well.  Pretty quiet too.  Haven&#x27;t used the mini yet, but the full powered plug in clipper does the trick.</li>
    <li> I decided to be the guinea pig and cut my own hair with this in the mirror. Came out great and it was the first time I ever cut hair. I cut my hair that was shoulder length too and it still workhorsed it&#x27;s way thru it. Used a #2 on the back/sides and a #5 on top.</li>
    <li> Given the price and the title of the product I thought I am buying that the professionals use. But I was wrong, even the cheap 10 dollar does a better job of clipping the hair.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for trimming sideburns, tapering the back of your hair, etc...  It&#x27;s well constructed with plenty of power.  The different length clip attachments are really handy depending on the length you want to style your hair.  It comes with a secondary battery operated clipper for travel or when you don&#x27;t have power outlet access.  I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is a really good product. Has a lot of what the barber uses, no need to go all out for a home cut. Only problem i have is when i used the number  1 piece, i wasn&#x27;t on tight, every now and then it would come off and i couldn&#x27;t cut my hair in peace. It could just be my clip that came damage. Other than that great product!</li>
    <li> Gave 6 haircuts with this and couldn&#x27;t be happier. The Powerdrive works well and cuts through the thickest hair. Only knock is the detail trimmer is noisy, but bearable. Not bad for [...] bucks. Already paid for itself.</li>
    <li> Nice powerful clipper.  The attachments make it easy for my wife to give me a buzz cut.  The included comb, mini clippers and scissors even make it easy to get a straight neck line and side burns.  As a lesson learned, use the ear guide combs for a perfect tapper around the ears, otherwise you end up with a bit of a chunky look.</li>
    <li> I like all items in the pack, except the small trimmer. It doesn&#x27;t works well even after loaded with newly charged batteries. Anyway, price of the pack is actually lower than many similar products with only one clipper. The clipper is quit powerful and very convenient to use with combs.</li>
    <li> Works great  not as describe I am happy with purchase</li>
    <li> Excellent quality. This product is perfect, it has all characteristics indicated. I have long in use it, and work  correctly.</li>
    <li> I have saved myself a lot of money by having vaguely coordinated friends and family cut my hair. clipper are professional grade and work like a charm. Easy instructions for the minimal maintenance needed. Trimmer is not great but the clippers do all of that work too.</li>
    <li> This is my second Wahl set and I have to say I&#x27;ve been very pleased with the results and value. First, the clippers are strong and cut through hair with ease. I&#x27;ve tried some brands over the years that are not so powerful (and as a result the clippers pull your hair rather than cut it). So the Wahl was a pleasure to use. There&#x27;s also a boatload of attachments included, so I am sure everyone will be happy with the tons of haircutting options they have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, value-wise, this set cannot be beat when compared to the barber. At just over $20 dollars, this set is paid for after just a cut or two. While Wahl clippers last for years and years, even if you throw it in the trash after 2-3 uses, it&#x27;s still a great deal. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> bought this clipper set for $25 and it is worth every cent. I have so far cut my hair twice using this and it works fantastically well. No problems whatsoever.</li>
    <li> decent clippers for the price, still using them after 5 years</li>
    <li> Decent product. Comes with a nice zip case, and pretty much everything you&#x27;d need to give a haircut. The barber&#x27;s cape was kind of a joke--it was cheap plastic garbage bag quality, so I ended up throwing it out after the first use. Zip case is nice to store all the parts.     My main criticism of this product is that it is called \\&quot;Chrome Pro\\&quot; yet, it contains no chrome whatsoever. Don&#x27;t call it chrome if it&#x27;s not actually chrome. The shiny parts of the clippers that look like crome are cheap plastic.    Overall, a good deal for your money. Cheaper than going to the barber at $16/cut!</li>
    <li> bought this set for my daddy and he&#x27;s funny about a lot of things but this one in particular i got no complaints which is a breath of fresh air coming from him. it was part of his christmas gift and he appreciated this more than anything and what he doesnt kno is that it was the cheaper of them all.  not only that but i had broken his clippers before giving someone a hair cut so it was well needed and i couldnt have picked a better brand because his old clippers was also Wahl but he had them for over 25 years.</li>
    <li> I used this to cut my husband&#x27;s hair. After 1 haircut the smaller trimmer no longer worked, &amp; after the second the main clipper/cutting device began making a very loud buzzing noise. I literally won&#x27;t cut my husband&#x27;s hair without us both wearing ear plugs as it is as loud as our lawn mower! On the other hand, the main clipper still cuts hair well &amp; we have enjoyed the multiple attachments for different lengths. I&#x27;m looking into buying my husband a new set, because the noise &amp; lack of trimmer are too annoying &amp; inconvenient.</li>
    <li> I have four grandsons ----all in sports-they wear they hair very short.  Financially this product saved them a ton----they no longer go to the shop/salon for cuts---they in fact do each others hair!</li>
    <li> The Wahl 79524-1001 Deluxe Chrome Pro is a quality hair trimmer that gets the job done. If you trim your hair weekly, like I do, this trimmer will last 3-5 years. If you trim your hair weekly, make sure to apply oil on the blades at least once each month, and be sure to replace the cutting blades every 12-18 months, as they become dull after many uses. I highly recommend this hair trimmer.</li>
    <li> All in all amazing product. I personally just use the 1 and 2 guides and the trimmer, but all the extra stuff is nice to have. You can really feel the quality of the clippers when you turn it on and the trimmer feels solid too.  Note about the trimmer: when I first started using mine, the motor sounded like it got weak quickly but it turned out that it just needed a drop of the included oil.</li>
    <li> Wahl makes it easy to \\&quot;do it yourself\\&quot;.  I have successfully given myself a few haircuts, and am pleased with how easy it is to add on an attachments, and get great results.  I feel like I am cheating on my barber, but Wayl makes this so easy.  The guys at work have joked about starting men&#x27;s night, so we can sit in the garage, drink beverages, and commence with the trimming.  There are a few of us who have become basement barbers, so why not make it an event.  With the attachments, I won&#x27;t even mind if Mike has a few too many before grabbing the trimmer.  It is that easy.</li>
    <li> Good equipment. however, the instructions make it sound a little too easy to cut hair if you aren&#x27;t a hairdresser. Is harder than it seems. I would also like to have a 1 1/2 inch trimmer, instead of the maximum one in this kit that is only 1 inch.</li>
    <li> I bought this item on 4/26/11.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d been looking for a set to cut my own hair for about two yrs.&lt;br /&gt;The set has a great range of sizes and quite a lot of accessories, thankfully, all the items shown in the picture were included.&lt;br /&gt;It seems to have everything I need and cuts well, I like it.&lt;br /&gt;The only critical thing i&#x27;d say, is that my little personal white Peanut trimmer, trims better than the trimmer in this case, so I dont use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy.</li>
    <li> We purchased these clippers for my husband. He uses them mainly to shave his head (no comb-overs anymore). Thus far it&#x27;s doing a good job and is fairly quiet and easy to use. The extra guides that come with it aren&#x27;t too practical, although there are plenty of them if you prefer to use them, we find they clog too easily.   His last set of Wahl clippers are still going strong after many years but Hubby decided he didn&#x27;t want to share clippers with our Schnauzer anymore so now he&#x27;s got his own.</li>
    <li> Great gift for mom! she had a old one that was dying and running out of attachments. she loved this!</li>
    <li> clippers don&#x27;t self sharpen and wont cut even after being cleaned.  the clippers suck! i would not recommend. hate them</li>
    <li> These are still being used to this day.  This Wahl unit could probably go a couple more years.</li>
    <li> great item use it alot</li>
    <li> Been using the whole time since I bought it over three years ago and still works great.  Have saved quite a pretty penny in that time.</li>
    <li> This set allows me to cut my own hair, without paying the $20+ it costs to go to a salon. Everyone assumes that I go to a barber to have my hair cut, as doing it myself looks just as good with the help of this kit..</li>
    <li> With the scissors, trimmer, carrying case and all the accessories i have everything I need to cut the boys hair!</li>
    <li> The reviews are always a roll of the dice. I read both good and bad for this, but based on past experience with wahl, I decided to buy it. The clipper pulled more hair than it cut. I tried everything, but it was too painful for me to use, much less to use on my son. The small clipper broke after 1 use. I am quite disappointed.</li>
    <li> Was use on one and all  from the kids to the dog. Does a great job and last a long time.</li>
    <li> I use this weekly and love it.  Works great.  I cut my own hair with the #2 and the tapered guides.</li>
    <li> This is a high quality plug into the wall clipper/trimmer set. The actual clipper and beard trimmer are the stars of this set and the other items are merely ok. The trimmer has a good weight to it and feels plenty powerful. Good product overall!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product as a Christmas gift for my brother.  It was a great price considering all of the pieces in the set.  My brother loves his Clipper set and recommends the product to others.</li>
    <li> I never used a clipper to cut my own hair before but it seems to work great, I do wish they had one more attachment for very short hair. Otherwise 3 uses and it pays for itself.</li>
    <li> My brother-in-law wanted a hair clipper. So, I ordered this Wahl-kit for him. I have cut his and his brothers hair twice. It has already paid for itself. It does a great job with the assortment of attachments. I find it very comfortable to the hand and relatively quiet. The little beard trimmer is a handy extra with with this package. My brother-in-law said to me, \\&quot;It beats going to the barber at todays prices\\&quot;! It should...\\&quot;He don&#x27;t pay me for a haircut\\&quot;!</li>
    <li> My son wanted his own clippers and after reading several reviews on this, I decided to get it for him. He was thrilled with it. It works like a charm and so far he has no complaints. It can handle his sometimes unruly, thick hair without any problems. The clippers are sharp and you can choose whichever trimmer to use (after all you have several to choose from). I saw the same clippers for way more than what I purchased it for here. If you have thick hair, you should think about investing in this. I got the product less than a week of purchase and it comes with a case to fit every bits and pieces in. Great product!</li>
    <li> So I did a lot of research on various models before deciding upon this one.  Used this on my husband and toddler son this past weekend.  So, here&#x27;s the breakdown:&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s: Very efficient, clean cutting, well made blades, no pulling on the hair. It is much more powerful than other clippers I have used.  It was quiet for the amount of power it packs.  It is more powerful than the clippers I bought for cutting my pet&#x27;s fur (which those are usually very strong to begin with).  The kit includes both the clippers and a trimmer, guards, combs, mirror, neat carry case for 35$.  Great price for what all is included.&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s: Guards are difficult to snap on sometimes.  Hopefully this will change as I break them in more with further haircuts for the boys.  Because of its powerful motor, the vibrations from the clippers are very strong.  That bothered my baby boy somewhat.  The cape included in the kit is a garbage bag with 4 strings attached to it (it&#x27;s not a real cape).  Invest in a better cape if you cut hair regularly.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend this.  We have had two other clippers for the humans and one set for the pets.  Now with this new one, I think it&#x27;s the best of them all, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> I bought this to avoid having to make an appointment to get my hair cut. I&#x27;m just too busy and tended to let my hair quite long between cuttings. This clipper has 10 combs that attach and you can cut your hair that length with the longest being 1 inch. I thought heck I can cut my own hair with this. And, it worked. It was easier than I thought it would be as well. I used a mirror to block the back and it turned out ok too. I was quite pleased. No more $15.00 haircuts and wasted time. Now I can cut as often as I wish. It also has a smaller clipper that works quite well too. I didn&#x27;t even know about it until I opened up the package. Comes in a zip up case to keep everything together. Should have done this years ago.</li>
    <li> i bought this crap from amazon and it came with no screws holding the clipper housing together . how is that even possible ? it&#x27;s still usable but the housing will come apart if you dont hold it right, that&#x27;s a hassle while cutting hair.  i contacted amazon about it and they did nothing. piece of crap.</li>
    <li> Purchased around year ago. Has all parts needed for great haircut.&lt;br /&gt;I am giving 4 stars because it seems that the knifes needed sharpening after only 5 uses.</li>
    <li> Just used the hair clippers and they worked very well.  Was very pleased that they provided so many different numbers and had an opportunity to experiment with different sizes.  A little heavier than I expected, but I&#x27;ll get use to it.  Very easy to figure out and assemble. Was very pleased by the packaging.</li>
    <li> The price was good, for what all you get with this set. The only bad thing was that I received 2 around the ear trimmer attachments that were identical, and no eyebrow trimmer attachment. That makes me wonder who puts these sets together, and what else I will find not working or misplaced, as I use the set more.</li>
    <li> I owned another brand clipper for many years before this one and it got lost in a move so we picked this one up and it appears great so far.  Very sturdy and looks just like one that would be used in a salon.  I am extremely with the purchase thus far.</li>
    <li> I ordered this set of clippers to replace a conair set I have owned for about 6 years.  I thought Wahl was supposed to be a good brand, I was apparently wrong.  The clippers were heavy, they vibrate excessively, they pull your hair, the guide combs were very thin plastic, and the trimer was just horrible all around.     As heavy as they were you should be able to drop them numerous times, (or run over them with a car) without any problems.  My previous set weighed about half as much and I never had any problems with durability.      They vibrate way more than any set of clippers I have ever used.  I have been cutting my hair for 12 years now and I have never owned or used a set of clippers that vibrated this bad.  Between the vibration and occasionally pulling my hair rather than cutting it, I had a headache by the time I was done.      As heavy duty as the clippers themselves were, the guide combs were the exact opposite.  They were made of very thin plastic.  As I was cutting my hair the combs would move around and stay in different positions. It was the same with all of the combs that I used.  They just would not stay strait.  They also looked like they were from 3 different sets.  Between all of the guide combs they had 3 different markings and designs on them, but they were all poor quality.      The trimmer was not heavy duty at all.  It was made of very thin cheap plastic.  It was also very loud. I couldn&#x27;t even trim around my ears with it because of all the noise.  They also felt sharp.  It was uncomfortable trimming my neck and when I was done I had red marks all over.    These are by far the worst clippers I have ever used. I am returning them and I will never buy this brand again.</li>
    <li> Got it when expected, works perfect. No complaints to sender, so order with confidence and the assurance that everything described will be shipped.... well at least i got everything!</li>
    <li> after reading the reviews, I gained the confidence in purchasing the trimmer and I am fully satisfied with its performance though I had used it once so far. But the first impression is the last impression, I believe.</li>
    <li> Bought this since my husband is in the USMC and needs his hair cut every week. We&#x27;ve used both the main clippers and the little battery operated clipper as well. The main clipper works great, tho we have only used it a handful of times so far. The little battery operated clippers are a little louder (which is expected) but seems to work well too. The accessories seem like a bit much for our needs but if the clippers last we may find more uses when our son is older and needs hair cuts as well. As a first time user of clippers these seemed a little intimidating but I&#x27;ve grow much more comfortable and definitely recommend as a quality pair of clippers.</li>
    <li> This is a great quality product, at a decent price, quick service, overall good experience with amazon and this product. Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> I use this often and love it</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husbands birthday and was very excited for him to use. Once he turned it on it was SO LOUS I could not even hear my DOG bark. My dog was barking at the LOUD vibrating sound, to top it off my husband couldnt even cut his hair with it because it was vibrating so much he could not keep a steady hand. What toppe dit off we smelled a BURNT smell. It was horrible we would never buy this brand again.</li>
    <li> Goodbye barber shop. It works like a horse and since I do my own haircut.</li>
    <li> This a WINNER.  My wife has been cutting my hair for 3 years with this and not problems at all.  GREAT product, no problems and would buy another if mine ever died.</li>
    <li> I purchased these clippers and when I received them (I recieved them early ) I tried to use them and they did not work. They were pulling my sons hair out. I wrote and told them they got another one sent out really fast. I used the printable postage, it was easy peasy. When I got my new clippers I used them and they are awesome. They are powerful cut nice and smooth. I am extremely pleased with their customer service and how fast they handled my return.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned at least 4 different Wahl clippers, and I was a little disappointed with the Chrome Pro.  The on/off button seems to make the unit \\&quot;jump\\&quot; when turned on, and it&#x27;s not a very smooth operation with a lot of extra humming and buzzing.  The attachments also seem a little cheaper than from previous models I&#x27;ve purchased, so I&#x27;ve been using the old attachments.  I really like the trimmer... it&#x27;s great for side burns and trimming around the ears, and I only put a battery in it when I need it.  The canvas carrying case is nice, but it could use a handle for easier transport.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the last Wahl clipper I had better, the Wahl 79900B Clip-N-Trim.  The hard case, with handle, was even nicer.  The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about it was the trim feature because it broke after a while (although, I did drop it).  The operation of the on/off button was much smoother too.  In hindsight, I should have purchased another one.</li>
    <li> Bad quality. When turn on makes a horrible sound. When i brought it, i thought the cover was metallic, but not, PLASTIC, and a very bad quality plastic. I live out of United States, That´s why i can´t return the equipment</li>
    <li> All I require is a simple 3 all around so for that purpose it is great! I did notice however that the main cutter piece does get significantly hot. The blade also isn&#x27;t as sharp as I would like so some hairs tend to be stubborn.. Not bad for the deal I got though and works for my needs</li>
    <li> Sent me the wrong piece set but refunded the difference money to me. Same product and husband says it works great.</li>
    <li> This is my second Wahl clipper, first was a different model. I use it to clip my head and beard once per week, without any guard. And I&#x27;ve cut other people&#x27;s hair with it, with guards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- great price for everything you get&lt;br /&gt;- solid construction even though the body is plastic&lt;br /&gt;- many accessories&lt;br /&gt;- secondary small clipper/trimmer, great for travel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- without a guard, the edge of the clipper (not the blade) is too sharp/pointy. If you&#x27;re not at the right angle, it catches skin. (reason for 4 and not 5 stars... but this won&#x27;t matter to you if you use guards all the time)&lt;br /&gt;- it gets very hot after 10-15min of use. If you&#x27;re going to use it with and without adapters, do the trim work without adapters first, before it gets too hot.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m reviewing this 4 years later (yeah, I know...). This is probably the best set of clippers that I&#x27;ve ever purchased. I do agree with others that the included trimmer is a bit cheap, but it does the job just fine unless you&#x27;re trying to use it on a cat or a wookie. There are enough clips in this set that you can do pretty much anything with it, and after 4 years my set is still running strong.</li>
    <li> Perfect hair cutters for home use. I purchased them to save on barber visits... I have two boyz and they are not picky about their hair styles for now (7 &amp; 10 years)... So, this is the perfect kit to use at home.</li>
    <li> Buy this product and it(he) has turned out to be very good, easy to handle and excellent quality</li>
    <li> This product is certainly not the best pair of clippers I have ever used, but it works very well and is modestly priced.</li>
    <li> this is the best 40 bucks a single guy w/ short hair could spend. seriously. saves me so much money and i look better more often :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Oyster and Andy&#x27;s brand clippers in the past and they held up for a couple years each, but it&#x27;s usually the attachments that break or constantly slip. They also feel a bit weak, making sounds that indicate that it&#x27;s starting to jam and require more mindful clipping technique.    This set of clippers feel much more powerful. It seems to go through hair much easier. These can probably feel right at home at a military basic training camp where the clip through big piles of hair without jamming. I also feel like I need fewer passes to get an even cut. The attachments feel snug and the plastic seems to be a more flexible type rather than the stiff brittle kind which I think would hold up better and be better on hair in theory.    A definite improvement over my prior clippers in quality.</li>
    <li> My husband has used this the past few years, and is still happy with it...Just finally getting around to reviewing it haha</li>
    <li> These clippers were great at first, after 2 cuts they became EXTREMELY LOUD.  They must have broke as they were not this loud before. I am going to return them and try another pair, hopefully this time they will be ok.</li>
    <li> Very good trimmers - after 3 haircuts, we&#x27;ve already made our money back!  The big clipper is working great.  The small trimmer goes through batteries quickly, but works well.    When buying clippers/trimmers, I&#x27;d recommend getting a Wahl with many attachments like this one!</li>
    <li> This clipper set has been great.  I bought it about 6 months ago for the purpose of learning to cut my husband&#x27;s hair.  He gets it cut regularly (every 2 weeks) which amounts to about $500 a year and I think that&#x27;s outrageous.  This is much more economical and is a lot easier to use than I thought it was going to be.  It comes with all the size attachments, and you can adjust the blade from a short to long setting with or without the attachments.  I&#x27;ve managed to learn how to do a great (if I do say so myself) blended cut with a small flip (think: police officer) without much trouble.  I&#x27;m so happy with the amount of money we&#x27;ve saved and ease of use with this product.</li>
    <li> My wife has used this numerous times to trim my hair.  Very easy to use and well worth it.  The battery operated trimmer would be better if it was corded.</li>
    <li> I can only give good grades. Good quality. I use perfectly. I am going to buy another one for my friend.</li>
    <li> Love this my husband and I both use it. Me for *cough* private areas I was actually scared to do that at first but actually is awesome and quick wish I&#x27;d done it before. Nice set though has a lot of guards for different uses. Love the extras. Def a must have for grooming.</li>
    <li> This machine lost power a month, I was not satisfied with the purchase that is why people will have confidence to shop online</li>
    <li> Was going to get my husband the balding clippers... But was too scared he&#x27;d take a chunk out.  These work wonders and are so much better than store bought cheapies we have went through.</li>
    <li> Does not work very well</li>
    <li> This thing is a precision instrument.</li>
    <li> Real nice set.  More pieces than you may actually need but you never kknow!</li>
    <li> Large clippers heavy and cumbersome to use. Attachments for large clippers cheap, flimsy and don&#x27;t stay attached. Small clippers eats batteries like 1st wife ate bon-bons. Surprised Wahl would put their name on this junk. I&#x27;ll be going back to Remington products.</li>
    <li> we had a similar set from Wahl for 5 years. it worked great, very quiet until I dropped it to tile floor.     We bought this set as a replacement. it works great too.     i would give 5 stars for my previous set. This set gets only 4 stars because although it has more pieces in this kit, there is no brush, which is one of a few pieces that we really need.</li>
    <li> Bought the product on June 22, 2011. This is my first trimmer, I used to go to Great Clips before that and pay them $12 including tip once in a month. I use this trimmer twice a month now, don&#x27;t have to worry about the extra hair since i am cutting them too often :). Very easy to use, I was a little worried after reading other people&#x27;s reviews about the noise, but believe me there is nothing like that. It has a pretty decent noise, does the job in 15 mins. Has everything you would need to trim your hair. Used 4 times with no issues, definite recommend.</li>
    <li> I purchased this less than a month ago so I cannot give a very thorough review and I don&#x27;t know how it will stand up to the test of time, but I do know that both the clipper and trimmer are great so far. My husband has VERY THICK (\\&quot;brillo pad\\&quot;) hair and the clipper cuts through his hair with ease. It doesn&#x27;t seem to be any louder than other hair clippers I&#x27;ve ever seen/heard/used.</li>
    <li> We owned our last clipper set for a very long time and I was tempted to stay with the same brand but I saw this one on Amazon and I decided to change it up.  I am certainly not disappointed.  This set is the closest to a professional set that I&#x27;ve ever seen and for the price it is great!  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> The product arrived as advertised and everything worked.  This would be an excellent value except it will get very loud all of a sudden while trying to cut hair.  It is so loud that I refuse to use it anymore and will buy another brand.  I bought a cheapo brand approx 15 years and it worked great all those years.  I&#x27;ve used this one 3 times and I&#x27;m fed up with it.  Believe me, move on to another clipper!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good hair cut set for $35. I love the hair clippers, the case, and all  that is included except the trimmer; the \\&quot;trimmer\\&quot; is useless. The   clipper attachments fits perfectly, It&#x27;s good to do fades with the taper levels,  but the clipper cuts slower on more textured, thick hair; so if you  know you have textured, thick hair, buy a more powerful clipper.  Without the trimmers I would rate it a 5. It&#x27;s the best cheap clipper  I ever bought.</li>
    <li> All the items appeared and felt cheap. I bought a better one in Walmart for $14.99  with out all the other useless 27 pieces.</li>
    <li> Not at all what I expected, bought this item for my grandaughter (she&#x27;s a haidresser) and she could not use the clipper, it pulled the hair so bad, thankfully she was able to use the other parts. Would not recomended</li>
    <li> I use this a couple times a year to cut my own hair, and it all works fine and is made of good quality.  I&#x27;ve had cheaper sets before, but this one is with the extra 10-15 dollars.  Very nice!  The small trimmer is, however, very, very loud, but everything else is fine.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair clipper set so that my wife could cut my hair, and now I use it to cut my sons hair. The main clipper feels&lt;br /&gt;Iike it is well made, and cuts well. Comes with many attachments that make cutting hair easy, and a nice pouch to carry everything in. My disappointment was with the mini-trimmer that comes with the set. It&#x27;s pretty much a piece of junk. Very cheap plastic feeling, and never really worked well. I actually ended up just throwing that piece away. Overall, good set, but the mini-trimmer is garbage.</li>
    <li> I use this to buzz my 10 year old&#x27;s hair.  It leaves lines in his hair and it doesn&#x27;t get all the hair, and I go over it and over it.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> love it got it fast too</li>
    <li> Does a great job. Quiet---with a nice low hum. Got it for Christmas, and very happy I don&#x27;t have to return it.</li>
    <li> Clipper works well, nicely designed, but how the Pro in the name came to be is beyond me. The small battery operated extra unit does not have blade adjustment settings and the main cutting clipper is not particularly sharp. However, it&#x27;s worked, for personal use, but nothing greater than average. Truly a case of 2.5 rating.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my husband.  Need to keep him looking good!  He loves this little travel kit.  Hope that it lastest...can&#x27;t keep him out of the mirrors...</li>
    <li> I have a 1/2 terrier and 1/2 poodle so he has a fine, wiry outter coat and a heavier, soft undercoat. These work like a charm. they don&#x27;t pull and stay sharp. I keep them clean and use the Oster cleaner solution regularly.</li>
    <li> I used this model (1 user moderate to heavy use - head, beard, and body) for 12 months before the motor gave out. It had good reviews, so understanding that I&#x27;d give better attention to it&#x27;s maintenance - I purchased it again; this time with suggested maintenance it lasted only 6 months . . . never again.</li>
    <li> Now I give my husband a hair cut once a month or so. Easy to use does a nice job. Husband doesn&#x27;t have to go to barber.</li>
    <li> Excelente producto tal como lo es la marca Wahl para equipos de afeitar, el vendedor lo envió a tiempo y realmente llegó rápido y en muy buen estado.</li>
    <li> I personally don&#x27;t use everything that came with the kit, but for the price, and cutting my hair for years now I&#x27;m easily saving money(paid $35).  Granted all I do is give myself a buzzcut which is rather simple minus seeing the back of your head.  I have yet to replace the blades, and they have never tugged on my hair at all(brand new blades from a haircutter did this to me quite a bit once).  I haven&#x27;t really used the mirror as I feel it&#x27;s too small to be of much use, the scissors are nice for when I have a stray hair or a few that didn&#x27;t get cut evenly(sometimes personal error).  The Cape is rather cheap and will fall apart easily, though when cutting my hair myself I never use it(would be in the way most of the time).  A couple times when turning the trimmers on there has been a puff of air felt near the switch, they still work fine but it does worry me a bit, as it had an odd odor too.  The small trimmers are a great addition for working on sideburns.</li>
    <li> I have had Wahl products before and was not dissapointed with either the quality of the clippers or the assortment of attachments that came in the package. They work and feel like professional quality parts for a fraction of the price. I would highly reccomend this product for anyone interested in cutting hair at home.</li>
    <li> I bought an ear and nose trimmer for Christmas, but I was not please with what I got. I was under the impression that it had more than just the ear and nose trimmer (the picture showed way more items than what really came with the product and there was no description). Lucky for me, my husband&#x27;s birthday is a few days after Christmas and I found this. It was exactly what I was looing for, I wish I found this before I bought the other item for Christmas.  I had no problems with shipping and it was not damaged. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Good for buzzing your own melon. It seems like the #2 is a little long though, so dropped to a one. That was my only small issue. Other than that it has done the job. I should note that I do no blending, fading, or tapering. So I can&#x27;t really speak to that.</li>
    <li> Received item and first thing noticed, the mini trimmer was DOA and wouldn&#x27;t work! The bigger trimmer is very loud and I can&#x27;t seem to adjust it! Too bad I can&#x27;t return it as I&#x27;d probably give it back. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> the cordless mini clipper does not work when we put batteries in it...tries multiple times and does not turn on</li>
    <li> As a family of 5, we spend a lot on haircuts. It adds up. This is an amazing set that saves many of us from having to get monthly trims -- we do it ourselves! -- and it&#x27;s easy to use. My husband trimmed his and my son&#x27;s hair really nicely on the first try. Really, he did as good a job as any barber. I was very impressed... and even more impressed with the money we&#x27;ll be saving.</li>
    <li> Excellent piece, very good quality works perfect one of improves them of the series, 100% recommended, does not have comparison. ccs-vzla</li>
    <li> After about 15 or so uses, this \\&quot;Pro\\&quot; clipper by Wahl started sounding like a jackhammer and no amount of adjusting or cleaning would fix it. It was either quiet (but wouldn&#x27;t cut) or incredibly noisy. No in between.&lt;br /&gt;  I take care of my stuff like I want it to last forever (never dropped or even bumped, even connected a wrist cord to the loop just to be sure) but my first experience with a Wahl product might be my last.</li>
    <li> What a great product, and great price. I bought this one due to the reviews, and am glad I did. These clippers are great, they work great, are easy to use, and comes with a handy pouch to put it all in. The only reason I gave it four stars is because it is hard to read the size number, but other than that, I&#x27;m very happy with this product.&lt;br /&gt;Even if it only lasts for a few more haircuts (I hope it lasts longer than that), it has already paid for itself three times over, and the best part... I don&#x27;t have to leave a tip!</li>
    <li> I mow my hair with this thing once every two weeks and it&#x27;s still going strong. Couldn&#x27;t be easier. The ONLY complaints I have is that the included mirror is a bit cheap, and the switch on the hair trimmer is a bit glitchy and it&#x27;ll cut off if you bump it while in use. Those are the accessories though, and you shouldn&#x27;t even need the mirror for your standard crew cut. The clipper itself justifies the thirty-three bucks I paid... Of course, I see the price is a bit higher now... But for what I paid, it&#x27;s 5/5 stars.</li>
    <li> This is a quality hair trimmer set. The large buzzer unit for the head works great. I don&#x27;t have any problems with it catching hair at all and \\&quot;tugging\\&quot; or missing spots either. The smaller trimmer for the neck and sideburns is great too. It has a nice angle to it for working around the back of the neck. Lots of accessories are nice too. The \\&quot;barbers cape\\&quot; they provide is a joke though. I thought it was a plastic garbage bag. Overall, though, I bought this for the razor, not a cape, and I don&#x27;t let that take away from the great quality product Wahl delivered.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these clippers for a few years now.  I trim my beard with them and buzz my head.  I&#x27;ve never oiled the blade and they work just as good as the day I bought them.  If they ever die I will certainly be purchasing another set.</li>
    <li> Muy buen articulo.De muy buena calidad. Envió satisfactorio. Llego sin ningún detalle. excelente elección. Muy buen precio. Gracias, agradecido. A!</li>
    <li> It cuts hair pretty well and feels nice and solid. Has a bunch of combs and stuff from 1-8 and angled ear guides.  After owning it for a few months it stopped turning on, but after a few days it just started working again.</li>
    <li> I use this to cut my dogs hair and it works great. It has everything you need. Ive used it quite a few times and it still works like new. Definitely a good buy.</li>
    <li> Ordered this product a while back , Wahl has always been a great clipper set compared to conair . It cuts great and always give me the results I want when it is in use. Came in great condition and was shipped and received on time.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with this purchase; I love that I get two clippers and a variety of length-attachments.  I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it whatsoever. I&#x27;m sold.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a hair trimmer made by Apple, what I bought was this. The grip is comfortable but the trimmer is large, heavy and cumbersome. The vibration is pronounced when operating. The on-off switch is coarse to operate and too small. The small battery powered trimmer is a nice accessory but it feels like it came from the dollar store and it speeds up and slows down with a mind of its own (with new batteries). The soft case is large and holds all of the accessories. Their are several differnt size cutters to accomodate most needs. If you drive a Dodge Ram, this is your clipper. If you prefer the Honda Ridgeline, looks somewhere else. Though it functions as promised, it feels as though the design has not been refined since the 70&#x27;s. I would not buy this trimmer again.</li>
    <li> These clippers are better than other brands I have seen for twice the price. Very high quality and whisper quiet.    The trimmer is amazing how it works longer and has more power on a single AA battery than any rechargeable trimmer I&#x27;ve used.    I would highly recommend this item.</li>
    <li> trimmer is useless and the clipper is not powerful enough for a clean shaved had....  wahl usually is way more powerful than this.  over all it comes with a great package but if u don&#x27;t need all the stuff don&#x27;t bother u can buy a better one from wahl for the same price but with less extras..</li>
    <li> the clippers are average the trimmers are pure garbage they dont cut anything and you need a battery for them not a good product i been cutting hair for 15 years the quality is poor you can go to any store and get this quality</li>
    <li> this multi-cut clipper and trimmer set is great for when your on the go and need a hair trim or cut great for traveling without the visit to the barber</li>
    <li> The clippers themself are excellent.  The trimmer, however, being battery operated lose power quickly.</li>
    <li> Looks stylish and does the job very well. The mini version is kinda silly. Battery doesn&#x27;t last (uses single AA battery) long. Maybe 2 full trims with it and it&#x27;s time to replace the battery. Maybe a rechargeable will do you good. I was able to cut my son&#x27;s hair without any experience. Just by doing the obvious. My wife cut mine three times already, and the last time she did was as good as the barber himself! I usually shave it all, Tried #2, #1 and 0 (this last one on the longest setting). It comes with many accessories which I don&#x27;t care much about but they are there if you ever need them. I do like that it came with a plastic \\&quot;sheet\\&quot;. A cheaper version of the ones the barber uses to protect you from getting dirty with your own hair. The whole package is worth it though! It paid itself on the 3rd haircut since I was spending about $40 a month.</li>
    <li> I had ordered this a very long time ago. Originally i wanted this for myself, but when i got an email saying that it sold out- AFTER I had bought it they refunded me. never got around to reattempting to buy it. like i said before WTF</li>
    <li> It works, and I shave my beard with it every other week. Seems to hold up fine, and the small razor works pretty good too, though it eats through AA batteries with continuous usage. Not a huge deal as the trimmer isn&#x27;t as critical and AA batteries are cheap.</li>
    <li> Totally shaved his head while he slept.</li>
    <li> the smaller one fell apart</li>
    <li> This hair cutting item was very nice, but it wasn&#x27;t the one I wanted. Good for styles with different clippers and trimmers.</li>
    <li> This is a replacement for a generic-brand clipper set I had, and I&#x27;m very impressed by the quality. The blades are obviously a high carbon machined steel, much better than other equally-priced clippers I&#x27;ve had, and they cut superbly without any drama or clogging. Cable is flexible, noise is average, cut is great.  The supplied pouch is nicely made and has enough room for all the supplied extras. Got extra stuff like scissors and mirror that I didn&#x27;t need but won&#x27;t say no to... I especially appreciate the taper guides that make trimming hair at the back of the head so easy. The plastic guides are probably the weakest part of the package, but there&#x27;s a good selection and the quality isn&#x27;t bad at all for this price; I&#x27;ve seen much worse plastic with all the Chinese-brand packages I&#x27;ve tried. In fact, I haven&#x27;t been able to find any clipper with really good quality guides at less than 10 times this price, so...  Haven&#x27;t tried the trimmer. Seems okay, but have no real use for it.  Overall, very happy with this purchase. Says it&#x27;s USA-made, too, so glad to recommend it.</li>
    <li> Bought this last month I am very happy with, has everything you need to turn you into a professional hair stylist.</li>
    <li> We bought this because our son likes his hair very closely cut; like many pro athletes.  He and I went to the same barber for years, and frankly, I got tired of paying $15 to just watch her put a guide on her clippers and just buzz through with his haircut in 5-10 min or less.  She did a great job, but after watching her for years, I knew I could do that and save a little money at the same time.  Trimming and shaping around the nape of his neck takes some practice, but that&#x27;s been the only part with any challenge.</li>
    <li> The large clippers are quality and have operated very well for many months so far. They are well balanced, have plenty of power, and all the attachments you would need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nose/ear hair trimmer works reasonably well. The light is not helpful at all and not really needed. Battery life is fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair trimmer was very cheap and stopped working within a couple months. It&#x27;s kind of a throwaway item and should not play into whether you buy this system or not.</li>
    <li> I have three young boys. This tool saves the cost and time to take a trip to the barber not to mention the cost of each haircut. Great time saver and money saver. Good quality at a fair price. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been using this for more than a year to give home haircut and simply love it!  It&#x27;s easy to use, has a lot of accessories for different hair cutting options, and has proven to be very durable.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> does a great job on my husbands hair an i can do it as it is almost impossible for him to get to a barber</li>
    <li> This trimmer was purchased for my teenage son.  He has started to do his own haircut on a monthly basis.  He indicated to me that it was the \\&quot;best purchase\\&quot; we have ever made in our lives and worth every $$ dollar we spent.</li>
    <li> This is a great set for our at home hair cuts. I have even used it when cutting our standard poodles hair and holds up to that great as well.</li>
    <li> This is great for home cuts. I spent $ 70 and have had weekly fades for five years. Learn to work the adjuster and attachments you can have your own barber shop in house. Take care of it</li>
    <li> I love this clipper to cut my husbands hair, cuts like butter!.  We have tried lots of clippers and this is the best.  Purchased 3 years ago and is still great!  I have only used 2 of the attachments and am sure it would be substantially cheaper if you could find just a basic set.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve given my kids several haircuts with this set, and I love it.  I want to cut my own hair with it, and might, it&#x27;s just too good of a deal!</li>
    <li> Great hair cutting kit!</li>
    <li> My wife cuts my hair and it works great without clogging. I only need three of the attachments so the rest is a waste for me but it was a great buy.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, works great!</li>
    <li> complete package.  does everything you need it to do</li>
    <li> Great haircutting kit. Has everything you need and works great. Clippers may over heat. So far so good. Not the same as one of those professional clippers from oster or andis but it&#x27;s enough to give the family and friends free haircuts.</li>
    <li> I love this clipper set. I will never go back to the cheap set, because they dont cut worth a damn.&lt;br /&gt;This set so far is the best and for the price it is not that bad.</li>
    <li> This unit is just amazing. I use it regularly to groom my hair and my 2 year old son. We have saved ton of money when we started to use this unit. Sometimes my wife also uses it for slight trimming and adjustments. It&#x27;s a total Return on Investment. The two handheld units are well built and are very sturdy. The rest of the accessories are slightly budget-built. I would highly recommend this unit if you are looking for an in-house salon kit. Hope this review helps.</li>
    <li> I used this product about 30 times to cut hair.&lt;br /&gt;It broke about a month ago. I used once or twice a month at most.</li>
    <li> Wahl makes the best clippers and trimmers. I have no problem with this product. It works well and easy to use. This is basically a complete hair grooming kit. Most importantly, it saves me money with every use. I keep my sideburns trimmed between visits to the barber. The chrome on the product makes the clipper and trimmer a lot more attractive. My only complaint is that the plastics provided in the kit feels cheap and are of decent quality. I paid $37.03 for it, which is a good deal. Overall, it is still a good product and I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Very nice unit very sharp and easy to use and clean. Would certainly recomend to anyone who home trims or hair cuts, works especially nice as I have a very heavy beard.</li>
    <li> I used this for about 7 years with no problems. My girlfriend cuts my hair about once a month. The battery powered trimmer didn&#x27;t impress me but I just use an electric razor for my neck anyway. Good quality from Wahl.</li>
    <li> not as powerful as the set it replaced..you could have kept some of the accessories and made the motor stronger</li>
    <li> have to return the item. It is not such good quality. Well, you can not expect mush with this price however i wish the quality would be much better. I returned the item</li>
    <li> This is the only thing I&#x27;m using for cutting my hair now. It has been 2-3 year since we bought it and it still working great.</li>
    <li> I have been cutting my own hair now for 15+ years since I was a young teen. In my youth my grandmother would cut the families hair — to save money? So cutting and snipping were in my veins. I bought this bad boy after having some power short in a very old Wahl. I took it upon myself to have my very own, being that I take my looks serious, especially when the &#x27;do&#x27; is a large part of the look. I wish I knew the technical or professional terms to describe the quality of the clipper, but I don&#x27;t so you will be left with a very layman&#x27;s review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It cuts, and it cuts well. I have had not a single issue with this guy in the few years I have owned it. It rocks! At the time, it was the most premium model I could find for my needs. The mirror that came with it stinks though. It&#x27;s blurry and somewhat warped, but it can do the job if need be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alas this past year I began to bald, the hair receded and thinned a bit on top. I knew this day would come, but I&#x27;m not ready to go shaved bald just yet. I have been taking a cue from Jude Law&#x27;s playbook and hawking it. The clippers&#x27; are getting more of a workout now, as I must more frequently shave the sides to keep them from overgrowing the top. Still working as good as the day I got them, even with some neglect — I don&#x27;t oil them as much or often as I should — but they show no sign of rust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth every penny. Not to mention it came with a bonus mini beard/mustache trimmer which gets used every other day. Now that is a deal. Buy it.</li>
    <li> Wow, what a piece of junk, which is suprising coming from both Wahl and Amazon.  I can&#x27;t even turn off the small razor.  It&#x27;s on if the battery is in place... period.  There&#x27;s no turning it off as long as the battery is installed.  Terrible design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The worst $30 I&#x27;ve spent on Amazon.  Bummer.</li>
    <li> As described. Happy Customer.</li>
    <li> I love this set up. It works great on all my dogs. Except one. It doesn&#x27;t like to cut finer hair and it took me 3 hours to get the hair down just a little bit on a snousher. I ended up finishing him with scissors. But other than that one dog the clippers work amazingly on the rest of my dogs.</li>
    <li> These work excellent with poodle dogs</li>
    <li> Plastic combs feel cheap and kind of sharp on the edges. The clipper itself is great quality and everything works fine after two years of casual use.</li>
    <li> VERY LOUD and Vibrates a lot.  I use this on my kids and they don&#x27;t like the noise.  I know it will last forever(if I don&#x27;t throw it away first), but way too loud.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son and he told me it was excellent and he is very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I have a Wahl cutter that I bought about 15 years ago and it still works great (I think back then it was still made in the USA).  The only reason I bought this one is because I had trouble finding replacement guides, and the ones that I could find were about the same price as buying a whole new package.  This one that I just bought is very cheaply made (made in China).  The blade kept pulling my hair; everything from the cord, the scissors, the guides, the combs were all very poor quality.  I&#x27;m hoping my old cutter lasts forever, because I don&#x27;t think I will ever buy Wahl again.</li>
    <li> Bought mine about two years ago and it is still going strong.  Great for a quick haircut or trim.  Has probably saved me on the order of $500 if I were to total the times I have used it for a haircut. Definitely worth the price!</li>
    <li> Máquina muy buena y silenciosa. Combo completo y útil. Venden repuestos.&lt;br /&gt;La máquina pequeña no es regulable, sino que corta en un solo nivel.</li>
    <li> Great quality product, I have used other brands which they only last a few months, but this product is long lasting. I use to cut my hair myself and trim my beard both with the multi cut clipper, the only disadvantage and its why I don&#x27;t give the 5 stars is that the compact trimmer needs batteries. Any way I love this product and I&#x27;m sticking with this brand. I sure recommend it.</li>
    <li> great product use it twice a month still runs like a top cant go wrong here, even the small trimmer works great loves batteries but works great</li>
