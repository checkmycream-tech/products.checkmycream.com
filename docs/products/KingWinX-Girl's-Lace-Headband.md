### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I&#x27;ve read all the reviews on this product, and if you&#x27;ve never tried  &amp;#34;COTTON CLOUDS-100% Cosmetic Cotton&amp;#34;, do.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the BEST OF ALL THE REST!!!</li>
      <li>If it was any good, I would be ordering them in bulk.</li>
      <li>Face care is very important.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s okay</li>
      <li>You can&#x27;t use just one you have to use more</li>
      <li>I got them for my face, but being more of a material than a cotton square, they should work well for gun cleaning also.</li>
      <li>Love what it does but the taste is not the grgreatist.</li>
      <li>So, have to use many to prevent this problem</li>
      <li>You can purchase 100 in a bag of good, old fashioned cotton balls for $.89 at any Market Basket in the country and they hold liquid.  </li>
      <li>Very nice facial pads.</li>
      <li>These are just as listed and they are very &amp;#34;thin sheets&amp;#34; of cotton pads which is exactly what I was looking for so very satisfied with product.  </li>
      <li>These are GREAT for wrapping facial hair on my maltese very absorbent for tears</li>
      <li>If I could read Chinese, I daresay, I could say for sure that this is what I ordered.  </li>
      <li>They are exactly what you think they are haha</li>
      <li>If you pull the real cotton pad from both sides, it&#x27;ll break.</li>
      <li>I will be more careful when ordering this type of product again.</li>
      <li>tried using it with my skin toner, but it doesn&#x27;t hold liquid well (because again it&#x27;s not made of cotton, and it&#x27;s very</li>
      <li>They are decent.</li>
      <li>Plus 25% of the box was empty, but filled with cardboard.</li>
      <li>These are not individual pads; they&#x27;re on a roll like toilet paper, and each individual pad is about the size of a business card and the thickness is slightly greater than the thickness of a tissue folded in half, which is actually far more absorbent!</li>
      <li>I will use the more expensive cotton pads in the future---in this case you get what you pay for--they are adequate</li>
      <li>so really you don&#x27;t actually get 200.</li>
      <li>I was going to throw these away, then decided to use them to clean around the tight spaces of my bathroom sink, but I won&#x27;t buy these or anything else from the same source again!</li>

<li> 200 pieces will last me a long time!</li>
<li> It only fit for doing this,for making mask,it is small and thin.</li>
<li> Took a very long time to arrive.</li>
<li> /&gt;Not only the pads but the package box is also very crappy (and was dusty when I took it out of the Amazon box).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> It is very thin ,but with very high efficiency to remove the old horny and dust.</li>
<li> they are like little squares of facial tissue.</li>
<li> A bit pricey, photo deceiving, box mostly empty...</li>
<li> I was expected thicker cotton pads but received very flimsy and thin pieces of cotton that fall apart when used.</li>
<li> The texts on the package box are written in Chinese and the broken English translation.</li>
<li> No worth it</li>
<li> it&#x27;s difficult to get out just one at a time and oddly the entire package was written in Chinese characters so if there was any instruction on the package with any explanation I couldn&#x27;t read it.</li>
<li> dip a little astringent with the cotton puff, clap the face</li>
<li> and quality is up but to few</li>
<li> It was a waste of cotton.</li>
<li> This product is to thin and extremely tiny.</li>
<li> All these cotton pads are a waste of money.  </li>
<li> The packaging would be my only complaint, because they are so thin</li>
<li> ie:  finger nail polish remove, toner for the face any small task around the house that calls for cotton balls</li>
<li> Not what I expected, to thin.</li>
<li> I pulled really hard, but it doesn&#x27;t even change the shape of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> I mean...</li>
<li> there are so so small and thin than it doesn&#x27;t work at all...</li>
<li> /&gt;Worse yet, we have a right to know when a product is made in a country that has no manufacturing controls and regulations – we&#x27;ve all heard the horrific stories about factories in China, and this product is used on the face!  </li>
<li> And it&#x27;s really thin.</li>
<li> These are cotton, just way too thin.</li>
<li> thin kleenex.</li>
<li> Scary.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s made of plasticky artificial fiber.</li>
<li> Too bad they were flimsy.</li>
<li> So thin!!!</li>
<li> i hate it,  </li>
<li> Very disappointed.</li>

    <li> All these cotton pads are a waste of money.  You can purchase 100 in a bag of good, old fashioned cotton balls for $.89 at any Market Basket in the country and they hold liquid.  ie:  finger nail polish remove, toner for the face any small task around the house that calls for cotton balls - the job will be well done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They (sellers) are just making one big profit - stop buying them.</li>
    <li> I just wanted to give it a try. If it was any good, I would be ordering them in bulk. Too bad they were flimsy.</li>
    <li> So thin!!! Need a bunch of it to wipe anything. Plus 25% of the box was empty, but filled with cardboard. Any reason? hmmmm...</li>
    <li> I mean...they&#x27;re cotton squares. Why are you even reading the reviews? They are exactly what you think they are haha</li>
    <li> Too flimsy. I was expected thicker cotton pads but received very flimsy and thin pieces of cotton that fall apart when used.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected, to thin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read all the reviews on this product, and if you&#x27;ve never tried  &amp;#34;COTTON CLOUDS-100% Cosmetic Cotton&amp;#34;, do.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the BEST OF ALL THE REST!!!</li>
    <li> i hate it,  don&#x27;t sale it.</li>
    <li> Love what it does but the taste is not the grgreatist. I use it for hydration after working in the Florida heat all day.</li>
    <li> They are decent. Nothing to brag about. Took a very long time to arrive.</li>
    <li> On the package, it says &amp;#34;100% combed absorbent cotton&amp;#34;, but it&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s made of plasticky artificial fiber. If you pull the real cotton pad from both sides, it&#x27;ll break. But this one doesn&#x27;t. I pulled really hard, but it doesn&#x27;t even change the shape of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried using it with my skin toner, but it doesn&#x27;t hold liquid well (because again it&#x27;s not made of cotton, and it&#x27;s very thin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only the pads but the package box is also very crappy (and was dusty when I took it out of the Amazon box).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brand name &amp;#34;Rosallini&amp;#34; makes you think it&#x27;s an American brand, but it&#x27;s made in China by a Chinese producer. The texts on the package box are written in Chinese and the broken English translation. (ex. &amp;#34;Usage: dip a little astringent with the cotton puff, clap the face gentlely.&amp;#34;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe Amazon is selling something like this. I&#x27;m a long-term Amazon customer, but I&#x27;ve never seen anything like this before.</li>
    <li> These are cotton, just way too thin. One ply tissue is about the same thickness. A bit pricey, photo deceiving, box mostly empty...</li>
    <li> not the size i needed</li>
    <li> Not the item as described! Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I got them for my face, but being more of a material than a cotton square, they should work well for gun cleaning also.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s okay and quality is up but to few</li>
    <li> The thickness is just enough to me for getting makeup liquid. And it&#x27;s really thin.</li>
    <li> there are so so small and thin than it doesn&#x27;t work at all...</li>
    <li> I will use the more expensive cotton pads in the future---in this case you get what you pay for--they are adequate</li>
    <li> This product is to thin and extremely tiny. I have to use four to five just to feel like I got a grip on it and can actually use product on them. It was a waste of cotton. I see why they show two fingers holding the pad. It makes it look way bigger than what it is. You can&#x27;t use just one you have to use more so really you don&#x27;t actually get 200. Will never purchase these again!</li>
    <li> These are just as listed and they are very &amp;#34;thin sheets&amp;#34; of cotton pads which is exactly what I was looking for so very satisfied with product.  The packaging would be my only complaint, because they are so thin it&#x27;s difficult to get out just one at a time and oddly the entire package was written in Chinese characters so if there was any instruction on the package with any explanation I couldn&#x27;t read it.</li>
    <li> These are not cotton pads.....they are like little squares of facial tissue. 200 came in a box about 2&amp;#34;x2&amp;#34;x4&amp;#34;. I can&#x27;t think of any use that I would recommend them for.</li>
    <li> Not what I wnated. I need 4x4 to do facials not to remove make up.</li>
    <li> These are GREAT for wrapping facial hair on my maltese very absorbent for tears</li>
    <li> Photo and description are deceptive. These are not individual pads; they&#x27;re on a roll like toilet paper, and each individual pad is about the size of a business card and the thickness is slightly greater than the thickness of a tissue folded in half, which is actually far more absorbent! Quite ineffectual. Based on the reviews, we aren&#x27;t all even getting the same thing! So it&#x27;s hit or miss with each order!&lt;br /&gt;Worse yet, we have a right to know when a product is made in a country that has no manufacturing controls and regulations – we&#x27;ve all heard the horrific stories about factories in China, and this product is used on the face!  I, for one, want to know what chemicals are (potentially) in this – I would NOT have bought this if I&#x27;d known it was made in China!!!  I was going to throw these away, then decided to use them to clean around the tight spaces of my bathroom sink, but I won&#x27;t buy these or anything else from the same source again!</li>
    <li> It is very thin ,but with very high efficiency to remove the old horny and dust. It only fit for doing this,for making mask,it is small and thin.</li>
    <li> If I could read Chinese, I daresay, I could say for sure that this is what I ordered.  200 pcs in a 1.5 x 2 x 3&amp;#34; box with no company name. Scary.  I would not use these on my face or anywhere else for that matter.&lt;br /&gt;Listing needs to denote these are made in CHina, are not a household name. Actually they appear to have no name.&lt;br /&gt;Returning asap.  I will be more careful when ordering this type of product again.</li>
    <li> Very nice facial pads. 200 pieces will last me a long time! Face care is very important.</li>
    <li> Not at all what I expected.&lt;br /&gt;Very thin kleenex. No worth it</li>
    <li> Way too flimsy, see through, open weave-everything soaks through to your hands.  So, have to use many to prevent this problem</li>
