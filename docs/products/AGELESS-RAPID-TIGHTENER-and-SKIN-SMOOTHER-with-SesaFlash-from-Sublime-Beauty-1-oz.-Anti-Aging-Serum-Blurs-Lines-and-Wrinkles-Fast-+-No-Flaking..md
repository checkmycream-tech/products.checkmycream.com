<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay....but doesn&#x27;t stay tight for long. You can feel it working. For that price I will not buy again.</li>
    <li> Been using this for a few weeks.  Love the way its smoothed the wrinkles on my face.  iA little goes a long way.  Sublime makes great products and has great customer service!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It is the best that I have tried.  I noticed results after a few days.  I will definitely reorder again and again.</li>
    <li> Used this on my feet and they&#x27;re softer than our babies bum. Wonderful product!</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum for a couple of weeks now. I can feel this serum really tighten up on my skin.  My skin feels so much softer. It doesn&#x27;t take much so it should last a long time.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Easy to use and no mess!</li>
    <li> Great product!  I have been using it for about two weeks.  I love the way, my face looks and feel after using it,  skin looks hydrated, glowing and more youthful as claimed by friends.  I am satisfied with it so far.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t had this too long; but it seems to work as promised. My skin feels tight immediately after application. Haven&#x27;t noticed any long term affects, but short term results are very noticeable.</li>
    <li> To me, this product is amazing.  I can actually feel it tighten my skin as I&#x27;m applying it.  I have always been told I look younger than I am, but since I&#x27;m 51 and have been told I look 35, I&#x27;ll take it!!!</li>
    <li> This was a waste of money. It didn&#x27;t work. It was horrible. I hate wasting money on things that have reviews that claim it work.</li>
    <li> This is such a nice product. It comes in a nice little pouch and I applied it after my shower. My skin tightened and my face felt smoother so it does what it says it will do. I was very happy with the outcome on just one application. My wrinkles were minimized and hours later, my face still feels tightened. I will continue to use this wonderful product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this two days now and see no change in my fine lines at all.  Maybe they&#x27;re not fine enough to be down sized? Not sure. On the good side, I have a sensitive complexion and this did not make me break out.</li>
    <li> Omg. This is great. My face looks 10 years younger. Got this at a special price for my honest review but I am so hooked.</li>
    <li> I use this in conjunction with the serum and the moisturizer.  These products are amazing and will replace more expensive items that I&#x27;ve been using which do not work as well as these.  It lasts all day and goes on well with my liquid makeup.  Best next thing in lieu of getting expensive procedures.  Love it!!!</li>
    <li> Did not meet expectations.</li>
    <li> Great product, keeps my skin soft and tight.</li>
    <li> Love It!!!!!  You can feel the tighting as it dries on your skin. I use it around my eyes and it doesn&#x27;t flake. I put my makeup on as usual and it smooths out the small lines.</li>
    <li> This product really works! It goes on silky smooth and does not flake off. You will see immediate results, I had people complaint my smooth skin after only 2 days! Love this product!</li>
    <li> Best ever!!!  The description about what this tightener does is exactly what I have seen on my face.  I have fallen for other products promises only to be disappointed by falling short.  This products does not only work, this products goes the full distance.  Please do yourself a favor and try this.  You deserve it!!!</li>
    <li> It makes my face feel drawn and so I have to apply moisturizer on to feel comfortable. I hope that doesn&#x27;t counteract the tightness.</li>
    <li> I am writing a non-biased review on this product as it was discounted to try it out and write a review.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it to my mom and she loves it so far.</li>
    <li> This work perfect as a makeup primer it really did tighten my skin so my pores were less apparent and makeup application was much more smoother, it is light weight and refreshing. It has become a part of my makeup routine</li>
    <li> This does make your skin look nice, but don&#x27;t attempt to use it with liquid foundation. Your foundation just bunches up and doesn&#x27;t blend. Use with powder only or no makeup at all, but  I would skip if you want to use this as a primer.</li>
    <li> You can actually FEEL the difference in your skin. Not to greasy works wonders!</li>
    <li> Tightened doesn&#x27;t begin to describe it. Just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Just received this product yesterday and put it on last night and all I can say is WOW!!!! Tight, smooth skin almost immediately!!!</li>
    <li> Love it makes my skin look great in an instant</li>
    <li> Honestly, for the price I paid, I can&#x27;t really see any difference. I feel a tightening feeling but don&#x27;t see any visible changes</li>
    <li> I actually liked this product. worked well with a primer and mineral make up</li>
    <li> I love this serum! It works great. I can definitely see that this serum works well with my skin. Excellent product that I am happy to recommend. It’s worth a try using this serum because I am happy with it. Can’t wait to see greater results months down the road. Sublime products are awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received this product to try and I am sharing my honest opinion</li>
    <li> The minute you put it on you can feel  your face tightening up . I will continue to use this product for long term benefits.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see any change in my face , did nothing for me just waste of money ! :(</li>
    <li> Definitely made my skin &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; tight however there was no visable difference.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t speak to the long term effects but I can definitely feel an instant tightening on my skin as it dries.  After my first use, I did have some dryness but a little extra moisturizer fixed that issue.</li>
    <li> This is a must have in your makeup bag! Worked the very first use. I noticed a substantial difference of line reduction on my forehead since that&#x27;s where the lines are the deepest. You can feel it tightening after you apply it, however it doesn&#x27;t leave your face feeling dry or like you have a mask on. I followed up with Sublime moisturizer after letting it dry. My skin looked so smooth and soft overall. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks, I like how it feels on my skin... haven&#x27;t noticed anything dramatic yet but hopeful :)</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite purchases that I have made! I have tried many anti-aging/ wrinkle creams and this one is one of the best tried! It comes as a pump container and very little is needed at a time. You can feel it actually tightening your skin. I have been using this for about a week and I definitely notice a difference! The crows feet around my eyes are minimal and the creases in my forehead have lessened! Overall, this one is a winner! A+++  received discount for honest and unbiased opinion</li>
    <li> I received this product, it was just as described .I have been using it and I already find my skin smoother and softer .This is a great beauty product to have in your makeup kit .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This product is a skin smoother serum that instantly blurs wrinkles and lines, There is no flaking. sesaflash is derived from sesame,it is the proprietary new-generation rapid smoother. This anti aging serum includes Matrixyl and Renovage. and makes a visible difference in your skin and erases wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; SesaFlash works in less than 10 minutes to smooth over lines and tighten skin. Matrixyl and Renovage also help you towards more youthful skin.This high quality serum also includes  aloe,green tea leaf and olive leaf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions are clear as to how to use, if you want nicer smooth and soft skin this product is for you .I highly recommend this product you can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome!! My skin is unbelievably smoother and feels so much tighter and I haven&#x27;t even been using it very long. I am really impressed with the results that I&#x27;m getting with this. My frown lines seem to be improving. My crows feet is fading. Of course there still there but with continued use of this, I can see a big improvement coming. It absorbs well into the skin. I absolutely love it!! Will definately be purchasing more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this a couple of days but have noticed skin tightening.  Have already gotten a couple of compliments with people telling me I look younger!  :)</li>
    <li> Very nice! Not thick or no residue</li>
    <li> Left my skin taught and soft....will keep using</li>
    <li> This works, made my skin tighten up and my fine lines less noticeable.  It was a little tacky but I may have used to much, but I don&#x27;t mind because it worked.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product for the person that is in the market of being proactive about their skin&#x27;s health and their beauty regimen.  This product is not sticky, a little goes a long way, and there is no scent making it suitable for both men and women.  I use it over my entire face, neck, and even hands.  I feel great having this product in my skin health arsenal.  A good buy.</li>
    <li> It really does the job!! Love it!!</li>
    <li> It does do something, not dramatic but you can tell a bit of a difference. It&#x27;s an additional step for me so I only use it once in a while.</li>
    <li> This product really does what it says TIGHTENS! I&#x27;ve used Sublime products since the company started at least 10-12 months, and have not been disappointed with any of them. I particularly use this on my neck knowing that I&#x27;m proactive in fighting &amp;#34;chicken neck&amp;#34;. Get this now don&#x27;t procrastinate!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. Makes face look much younger !</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work.i have been using for more than 3 weeks and I haven noticed a difference with my skin</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product! This is the best product I have tried to date to help my skin look and feel better. It has worked beautifully diminishing the appearance of lines and wrinkles and giving a a more toned definition to my skin.  I will continue to use this product and I highly recommend it  Sublime Beauty scores a 10 on this product!</li>
    <li> I have had this product for a week and I love it !  I use this in the morning before makeup. It needs time to dry so don&#x27;t put it on directly under foundation 5-10 minutes is sufficient. Something I didn&#x27;t expect is that the pores on my face look smaller which I love! It smells good but not over powering.  I would definitely recommend this item.</li>
    <li> I used it the first time and feel smoothing skin.</li>
    <li> I have used many products  , But this one truly does work. I love it.  I am waiting to order more</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m trying to help prevent, so I can&#x27;t say I have seen too much difference, but my skin is looking great. Has a nice glow and feels very hydrated.</li>
    <li> Feels great. I use it twice a day. Seems to make skin smoother and tighter</li>
    <li> This feels nice and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  However, I haven&#x27;t noticed any effect on wrinkles or fine lines after a week of use.</li>
    <li> This is absolutely amazing I saw a difference in the first week</li>
    <li> Average at most.  Not bad, but didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
    <li> At Christmas I ordered the 3 separate product gift box. I am 64, and have always taken good care of my skin. The 3 products in the gift box were absolutely wonderful. I am sold on Sublime and would recommend the brand to anyone interested in a quality skin care regime. I must admit I was disappointed with Sublime Ageless Rapid Tightener.Probably Due to the miraculous results I have received from Sublimes other products. However, as I stated I am 64 not 20 or 30.  I say go for it, if you are at an age where you have years ahead to advance your skins suppleness. I think through the stress of the last few years,i&#x27;m finally ready for a more aggressive lasting product. No not surgery, I feel nothing wrong with aging gracefully. But I&#x27;m used to looking younger than I am and not yet ready to throw in the towel.</li>
    <li> This product lives up to all it promises. My neck area is becoming a problem for me. I have tried many products, some with no results at all and others with minimal results. THIS Tightener actually tightens. I use a smaill drop on my face but my neck is my main area of concentration. I check  in the mirror a few times a day to make sure it&#x27;s results are still there-and they are. Every day. Every time.</li>
    <li> I am using it for tow weeks , I recommend it to my sisters! They love it!</li>
    <li> I did not find this product useful at all.</li>
    <li> Sublime Beauty Ageless Rapid Tighter has become part of my daily beauty regimes. It came in a cute slim 1 oz spray pump bottle. I&#x27;m thinking it should last me at least 30 days or longer if I continue to use it daily. I felt tightness and smooth skin right away under my eyes and forehead. I did find out that less is more, so don&#x27;t over-do it when applying. It really does work wonders to your skin/appearance. You can feel it actually tightening your skin soon after applying people, so it&#x27;s a must purchase. This is my first ant-aging skin tightener ever used and I am pleased with my purchase.  I did received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> I really like this serum!  It tightens when it dries. It stays a little sticky but when I put my moisturizer over it, my face feels firm but soft.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really amazing! After 1 day my skin looked awesome.  I&#x27;m a skeptical person so i wasn&#x27;t expecting this to be as good as the reviews... But it really is!</li>
    <li> This is another excellent product from Sublime Beauty...I love these products</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t notice a difference.</li>
    <li> Can instantly see improvement in texture and tighting of the skin and it last, plus seem to have an a lasting effect.</li>
    <li> I waited until I used the entire bottle before posting a review. The product smells nice and applies easily, when it dries it feels like a face mask which is what I assume they mean by tightener. I noticed no skin smoothing at all. When applied it feels like a thin layer of glue that will crack if you make any expression.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using an entire bottle I noticed no difference in my skin. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Does not &amp;#34;lift&amp;#34; skin at all. I would like to return this. I am not satisfied, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for awhile now. It is a non scented serum. I use it on my forehead and crows feet area. It does instantly tighten its amazing! It does feel a little sticky but it dries. I do put it on last, on top of my make up &amp; bronzing powder. Doesn&#x27;t flake off. Have worn it all day today &amp; skin still feels tightened.  Love the tight feeling.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful. Have been using just a short time and it leaves your face soft, silky smooth.  My skin feels tighter around my eyes and my cheek skin seems to be tighter and firmer. Would definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> easy applicator, noticed a difference within first week</li>
    <li> Received this recently and already see a difference in my skin. Lines are less noticeable and my face appeared to be having a lifted appearance  absorbed quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky feeling. Thank you&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still using this product, thank you. Goes on so easily and also goes well with any face cream I use to apply afterwards.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks now, and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised at just how well and quickly it works!  I also really like that, aside from the immediate results, it contains ingredients that will help improve my skin with long term use.  The only caution that I would add is be careful not to put too much on, or it will &amp;#34;pill&amp;#34; up on your skin after it dries.  I love the clean, fresh scent, and I will certainly purchase this product again and look forward to trying others from this company!</li>
    <li> I can honestly say I see results with this product! I was surprised despite all the similarly positive reviews on Amazon that I read prior to purchasing. Immediate and Long-term effects too!&lt;br /&gt;I definitely plan on re-purchasing and will try another product in the line when I do.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with  your product and feel sure I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> This tightener has left my skin feeling softer and younger.  I can see my pores have reduced in size and are less visable.  I am hoping for even more benefits in tightening as I continue to use this, especially around my jawline.  I will continue to use this daily and will update this review if I continue to see these great results.</li>
    <li> Starting using this product and within 2 days I recieved compliments at how youthful I looked and I wasn&#x27;t wearing any makeup!!!! I CAN&#x27;T WAIT to see what one month of use will bring me!!! Already ordering my second bottle!</li>
    <li> I like this product so far. It goes on easily. It does dry a little sticky and makes my face feel a little tight, but I use my regular face cream over it and it&#x27;s fine. It IS a tightener, so I guess my face feeling a little tight is a good thing.</li>
    <li> I started using this product about a month ago and haven&#x27;t seen much improvement as far as wrinkles, but I haven&#x27;t been really diligent about using it every night.  I like the way it feels when I apply it.  There is a really smooth texture and it does feel like it tightens my skin.</li>
    <li> unfortunately, ordered the serum for my mom&lt;br /&gt;and received a day cream instead&lt;br /&gt;very disappointing</li>
    <li> This is really a great product.....it doesn&#x27;t peel like some really expensive tighteners. It goes on, does the job - I usually wait until it&#x27;s dry and then I can put whatever I want over it.</li>
    <li> As a woman in my mid 40&#x27;s I am in a battle to keep wrinkles at bay so I jumped at the chance to try this tightener at a discounted price during a promotional period to test for quality and review.  First of all, let me tell you about my face.  I have been using various products since my early 20&#x27;s so I don&#x27;t have wrinkles.  My goal is to keep them away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product comes in a pump dispenser, which I prefer over a jar.  It is clear and has a very mild scent which is quite pleasant.  Once you put it on, you don&#x27;t smell anything though.  The tightener was easily absorbed into my skin and within seconds, you can feel a tightening as it dries on your skin.  It is not tacky at all once it dries and it leaves your skin very soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are planning on wearing it under your makeup, you need to apply this product at least 20 minutes before applying makeup to give it a chance to thoroughly dry.  After my shower, I put this product on and then get dressed and do my hair followed by makeup to give it time to be thoroughly absorbed.  I have experienced no issues with my makeup when I have followed this process.  Overall, I am very pleased with how this product makes my skin feel.  I own several products from the Sublime Beauty line and have not been disappointed with any of them.</li>
    <li> I can honestly say I have never done anything better for my skin than buy the sublime beauty products. I  bought all the products they have and can&#x27;t decide which one I like the most. My face will never be the same.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff. I love the consistancy, it reminds me of egg whites, start sparingly with your application it travels far on the skin and the feeling when it drys is immediate tightness. I believe my skin does look creamier after using it for awhile, I think my skin tone is more even also- big plus.</li>
    <li> It did absolutely NOTHING.</li>
    <li> So far I haven&#x27;t used the Ageless Rapid Tightener long enough to say if it is working but I do really like how it feels when I apply and how my skin feels! I love this product line, and I will continue to use many of the products from this line and hope to see continued results!</li>
    <li> This is the perfect product for tightening your skin.  Your skin feels tighter and younger and makes applying makeup that much easier.  You can use it every day to get a mini &#x27;face-lift&#x27; for your skin.  I love how it makes my skin feel.</li>
    <li> Ladies, I LOVE this Ageless Rapid Tightener &amp; Skin Smoother (ARTSS). I am a real person and a real woman who has not only bought $100&#x27;s of product with promises. I&#x27;ve bought $100&#x27;s worth of products on Amazon and I have not once left a product review whether good or bad.  For me to leave a review the the product HAS to be excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said before, I have tried many products with many claims and ALL except for Clinique has failed.  I know..I know &amp;#34;If Clinique does so well, why are you looking for something else?&amp;#34; Because Clinique has many unnatural ingredients...but the last product I tried I had made up my mind, I was going to stick with Clinique.  I came upon this product because I was looking for a instant wrinkle reducer that did not flake.  When I received ARTSS, for my it did not give me the instant results I was looking for but I like how it tighten my face so I continued to use it. FYI: I do not have a bunch of wrinkles every where which it would seems to be easier to tighten, I have (had) a deep crease laugh line and was seriously thinking about a filler.  The ARTSS has dramatically reduce the crease, in a short week in a half now, something Clinique could not do.  So, I am going to keep using this awesome product and see what happens.  I will let you ladies and gents know with a follow up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Customer Service A++. Kathy emailed me several times before I responded to her email.  Which says to me that this company cares about who they sell their products to. Thank you Kathy!!!  No less than 5 stars!</li>
    <li> This skin tightener works really nice!  You can feel the lotion working after only 10 to 15 minutes.  I&#x27;ve tried it on one side of my face and can definitely see the difference when comparing that side to the side with nothing on it.  Definitely smooths out the lines and wrinkles for me.  Love having this in my &#x27;tool kit&#x27; when I want to touch up the aging face.</li>
    <li> I buy so much on Amazon but rarely write a review.  I had looked up the many reviews written about this product and I should have listened to the one and two star ratings. This product does not work.  I hate that I wasted money on it.  Over 50.00 and it basically gives you the feeling of very slight skin tightening for a few minutes and then does not make your skin look any different.  Trust me...I wanted it to work.  Unfortunately I pretty much knew before I bought it that it probably wasn&#x27;t going to do much.  But I hoped it might give me a little tightening around the jawline.  I can honestly say I&#x27;m writing this review in the hopes that I can save one person from not wasting their money on this product.  I definitely lived and learned on this product.</li>
