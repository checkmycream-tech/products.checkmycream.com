<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This bag does not look like it is pictured. It is completely flat there is barely any room to put anything except a piece of paper. I might as well have printed a picture of it cut it out and glued it to cardboard.</li>
    <li> Giving this one to a dear friend!  Can&#x27;t wait to see her reaction!!  So cute!!!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s actually a decent size. bigger than I expected. loving it. but it&#x27;s more for the look than use I tell ya that.</li>
    <li> Smells like rubber even after I aired it out and sprayed febreeze on it</li>
    <li> This looks cooler in the picture than when you get it. I bought this for my sibling who was kind of disappointed. It barely opens also so I&#x27;m not even sure what the use for this is. Unique, but not what expected. So if you are looking to use this as a functional purse/bag, I would suggest buying something else.</li>
    <li> Shipped quicker than expected. Had a funny smell but went away after a month or so. Looks cute, gets a lot of compliments.</li>
    <li> The good - It is the one I bought. Funny bag.&lt;br /&gt;The bad - Get what you paid for quality. And if you don&#x27;t want to messed up the shape, you basically can&#x27;t put a wallet in it. It has to be something small or thin: a phone and cards/cash without wallet.&lt;br /&gt;The ugly - Chemical/plastic smell is super strong. I don&#x27;t know what they use in China, the other 2 fun/cheap bags I bought from Chinese seller smelled as bad as this one. I opened it and put it out at the porch for 2 days to let the smell out. It&#x27;s better, but still smells like cr**p.</li>
    <li> This absolutely the cutest purse ever. I wish the inside was a little bigger. But I still give it a 5</li>
    <li> Did not meet my expectations at all</li>
    <li> I love this bag. It is so adorable. It is small, but you can see in the pictures that it&#x27;s small. The bottom unzips and expands so there is more room inside. It does have a funky smell, but air it out. It&#x27;ll be fine. Its an $11 bag. It&#x27;s not a Fendi bag. Don&#x27;t expect something expensive. It&#x27;s perfect, and I plan on ordering more of them.</li>
    <li> Very happy with service and item.</li>
    <li> So cute and it does look like the picture. It is on the thin side but I could fit all the things I need.Only thing bad is that it&#x27;s got a plastic smell but other then that I love it!</li>
    <li> LOVED the bag got here faster then i expected was very happy with the choice i mad.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s definitely different. People are always asking me if it&#x27;s a real purse and where I got it. This is not for people who like a roomy bag. I can comfortably fit my phone, lip gloss, and a couple other small essentials. For the price and the compliments, I would definitely recommend making the purchase!</li>
    <li> The 2-D design is great.  It looks just like the picture.  However, the bag itself is only marginally functional.  Its zippered top makes entry more like an envelope with an expanding bottom of approximately 2 inches.  I would like to see the bag have a little more accessible volume.</li>
    <li> It is exactly as shown. Very cute, but leaving no room to hold much of anything.</li>
    <li> Super cute got to because it was cute and glad I did... it is small but I can get past that..</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful bag, great conversation piece, do not expect it to hold much but buy it anyway! It also came earlier than expected delivery window.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very cute but it&#x27;s virtually useless. It does look very much like a cartoon but the opening to put anything in the purse is extremely small. I could maybe fit some money and a slim phone. Not much else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For that reason, I give it a three star rating. If you&#x27;re looking for something that can hold all of your items, buy something else, but if you just want it for the look, go for it!</li>
    <li> Very limited storage. Cool looking though...</li>
    <li> Small but really cute! Fit my phone and my wallet, but for its purpose that&#x27;s all I needed. Looks just as pictured.</li>
    <li> Adorable, size of inside a bag a little  small.</li>
    <li> I can barely fit my fingers inside.</li>
    <li> just like its pictured!! but you can barley put anything in the bag which sucks xD</li>
    <li> Super cute!  It is small on the inside - but it&#x27;s too cute to care about that!  Now I wish they would make shoes to match!!</li>
    <li> Super tiny inside. Looks bigger in picture</li>
    <li> not practical cannot hold much.  Fragile-handle ripped out!!! But very cute</li>
    <li> Purchased one for my wife and one for my daughter. These look amazing!! They look just like the picture.</li>
    <li> this bag is deffenitly an eye catcher however getting things in and out of it is a hassel. small space I barly can fit my hand in there without it getting burned by the matterial.</li>
