      <li>these are really nice, but as i glued them on they started cracking a tiny bit, as if they didnt work well with the glue.</li>
      <li>and I thought having the 2 different colors would be nice.</li>

      <li>The tips are pretty, but I am upset I did not receive what I thought I was buying, so if you are buying these because you want what is shown in the picture then DO NOT buy these.  </li>

      <li>and there was sizes ranging from almost that of a kid all the way up into larger sizes that could accommodate for a (relatively large) man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love the blue ones, the pink and orange ones kind of make my nails just look dirty, as if i have yellow fingernails.</li>
      <li>the only problem that I have is that there are not many sizes to choose from so you have file them to get them to fit right if your nails are not the A typical nail size.</li>
      <li>so they offered me different tips.after agreeing on the clear tips they have the seller contacted me asking if I would just take a refund</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Bought these to wear on my vegas trip. I buy tips then take to the nail salon and have them put acrylic over them. Got a lot of compliments on the tips. Great fresh bright colors. Will buy again. Wish they came in a nail case so it will be easier to grab an just put on nails. The cases that has the numbers. Instead of digging through the seperate bags.</li>
    <li> I really like them I&#x27;m just not sure how to blend them onto my fingers. I&#x27;ll just have to experiment a little.</li>
    <li> each tip is for a different finger. I feel that i was sent the leftovers. none of them match at all. rip-off</li>
    <li> They worked good for me but when my sister was buffing them the sparkels came off but other than that their amazing</li>
    <li> i really love the nail tips and they very pretty and sexy too! they are going to perfect for holidays</li>
    <li> Was not what I executed  items are must smaller, other  were what I expected and I like them, thank you</li>
    <li> The nail tip were to small,my nailbed is to wide so I&#x27;m return for Nail Decal &amp;#62;Gold&amp;#62;Music&amp;#62;Note&amp;#62;Stars Metallic Water Transfer #GD06 $2.25 From:Vince Stafford #4885</li>
    <li> I really enjoy the look of these. the only problem that I have is that there are not many sizes to choose from so you have file them to get them to fit right if your nails are not the A typical nail size. But the glitter is fantastic. very shinny and I think they will look wonderful on.</li>
    <li> I love the color blend i recommend this product to everyone</li>
    <li> WORTH IT:) These are absolutely beautiful! Same as the image, but BETTER! Love the colors, great buy! AND they came within a week of ordering!</li>
    <li> THE TIPS WERE SHIPPED IN A TIMELY FASHION THAT WAS GREAT. THE TIPS THEMSELVES AREN&#x27;T AS BRIGHT AS IN THE PICTURE AND CRACK UNDER ANY KIND OF PRESSURE NO MATTER HOW MUCH ACRYLIC/GEL/WHATEVER YOU PERFER TO USE ON THEM.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed. I was really wanting these tips and I did not receive what I ordered instead I received different colored tips. there was 10 different colors and 10 sizes so there was not a same color for any nails to match if this makes since. I contacted the seller they said I could have these ones and they would send me the right product. they did not have it in stock so they offered me different tips.after agreeing on the clear tips they have the seller contacted me asking if I would just take a refund and I explained to them I just wanted a product I wanted because I would order it anyways..so after about 2 weeks of emails they send me one saying the Chinese holidays is up so they don&#x27;t know if that item will be in to ship that I basically had to take a refund. I am not happy I waited for a month to get them and expect something else....will not buy from this seller again!</li>
    <li> They were some broke in the center of the nail. I guess they were too thin, they are very pretty.&amp;I tried to wear some of them.</li>
    <li> Mid-rating because I canceled the order. I can&#x27;t say that it is liked or disliked</li>
    <li> I love these nail tip. .. there very pretty. ... I&#x27;m very satisfied with them</li>
    <li> They crack the very next day</li>
    <li> filed down to use as regular nails and very easy to do look is nice and easy to wear not heavy</li>
    <li> Great naiks they come as pictured but really thick nails</li>
    <li> The biggest thing that I do not like about this listing is you do not get the tips shown in the picture! Instead you get ten tips for each size and they are all different.  Each tip size includes a light and a dark sparkling purple, sparkling grey, light sparkling pink,  sparkling medium pink, sparkling hot pink, sparkling white, sparkling baby blue, sparkling aquamarine, and a sparkling pink with black zebra stripes.  The tips are pretty, but I am upset I did not receive what I thought I was buying, so if you are buying these because you want what is shown in the picture then DO NOT buy these.  Tips sizes include 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9, and 10.</li>
    <li> fabulous colors i addore those colores.if you want a attention and a good compliment then a poping color is what you need.</li>
    <li> good shipping time and the nails were awesome. I use these with my gel polish and they work perfect together</li>
    <li> I ordered these because I liked the pic it showed and I thought having the 2 different colors would be nice. However when I got them every size nail is a different color. I don&#x27;t think I will use them they don&#x27;t match at all or do I think this was advertised correctly.</li>
    <li> I LIKE THEM VERY MUCH HAVE NOTING TO SAY THEIR VERY CUTE :) BUY THEM!!!! I LOVE THEM HAVE NICE COLORS NOTHING Eles SAID XD</li>
    <li> Love the colors put them in my private nails for my self</li>
    <li> Love the mix of colors I like that it&#x27;s organized by size so it makes it easier to know measure</li>
    <li> This purchase came very early and was packaged well with all the colours as described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Im glad there was varying sizes because i have really tiny hands and tiny fingers and there was sizes ranging from almost that of a kid all the way up into larger sizes that could accommodate for a (relatively large) man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application was easy and I simply put clear acrylic over these and allowed them to dry, shaped them and went on my way! Im sure there are other ways of using these but for what I wanted they were perfect and looked great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good purchase and a good seller!</li>
    <li> I love the blue ones, the pink and orange ones kind of make my nails just look dirty, as if i have yellow fingernails.</li>
    <li> I love them!! They are beautiful on. They fit good. And I will buy more of them. The price was great.</li>
    <li> these are really nice, but as i glued them on they started cracking a tiny bit, as if they didnt work well with the glue. i didnt really apply weight when aplying either. but when i cut them down to the length i wanted which is usually 1 inch, they became one color , not really the ombre color i was hoping for.</li>
    <li> Very colorful, very pretty, can&#x27;t wait to start using them, also love receiving them almost two weeks early.</li>
    <li> I love the sparkels and colors! Works great.  I love this seller.I added extra glitter on the tips of the nails pictured.</li>
