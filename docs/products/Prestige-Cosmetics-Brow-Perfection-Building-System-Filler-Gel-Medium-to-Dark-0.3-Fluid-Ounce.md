### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Wonderful.  </li>
      <li>Great!</li>
      <li>I love this!!!</li>
      <li>This is amazing!!</li>
      <li>I bought it hoping it might help, but it&#x27;s even better than I thought!!  </li>
      <li>For the price you get a good deal.</li>
      <li>The coverage is not quite as good as it would be with a powder</li>
      <li>Love it and recommend it unconditionally!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>but I think it&#x27;s a good way to fill in my brows in the mornings when I don&#x27;t have time to be precise with a powder.</li>
      <li>I would not compare it to top brand brow builders whatsoever.</li>
      <li>I am pretty pleased with this product!  </li>
      <li>I have nothing to compare it to, but the price is good, color is good and goes on as expected.</li>
      <li>I have never used anything for my eyebrows before, but as a first time user, this was very easy to use.</li>
      <li>Again, use a light touch when applying.</li>
      <li>When its this cheap expect cheap results.</li>
      <li>Super easy and quick to use.</li>
      <li>I wear it daily &amp; will definetly order more:)</li>
      <li>Overall I&#x27;m very happy with the product and will definitely not be using brows pencils now that I&#x27;ve discovered it.</li>
      <li>As good or better than some of the more expensive brands.  </li>
      <li>This color is perfect for dark dark brown hair :)</li>
      <li>Looking at the wand with the color, you can see little hairs/fibers, which freaked me out at first, but they adhere nice and smooth, attaching to your existing hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t run or come off, even in hot, humid weather.</li>
      <li>so this lash building gel is exactly what I needed.  </li>
      <li>I can only surmise that most of the high ratings and reviews are bogus.</li>
      <li>Much lighter than described.</li>
      <li>Thanks for the timely shipment.</li>
      <li>i really wanted to buy the Anastasia Beverly Hills brow gel but just not ready to pay that price yet, so wanted to try a more affordable product</li>
      <li>Once I put the dark color on, I brush it lightly with a clean eyebrow brush and it looks very natural.</li>
      <li>Honestly, I can&#x27;t believe some of the beauty products I&#x27;ve been receiving from Amazon lately.</li>
      <li>It fills in &amp;#34;sparse&amp;#34; or gray-haired areas with a natural look.  </li>
      <li>I ordered this product to build up thickness in my brows, however when I went to put it on it was literally like a hair gel that never dried.</li>
      <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried a gel liner so I can&#x27;t compare it to other brands, but I can say that it thickened my eyebrows while still maintaining a natural appearance.</li>
      <li>You have to be a little bit careful about dried fibers kind of getting in the way during application,  similar to some mascaras.</li>

<li> Not as expected.  </li>
<li> but it&#x27;s a little darker than I expected.</li>
<li> So why spend $20 when you could spend less than half of that?</li>
<li> You just need to use a little bit to achieve your look.</li>
<li> My brows are thin due to age and hypothyroidism and partially gray</li>
<li> This is nothing but a wet, sloppy mess.</li>
<li> Color comes out too thick and clumpy.</li>

    <li> Wonderful.  Thanks for the timely shipment.</li>
    <li> Great! For the price you get a good deal. This color is perfect for dark dark brown hair :)</li>
    <li> Color comes out too thick and clumpy.</li>
    <li> Would like it to be a tad darker.</li>
    <li> As good or better than some of the more expensive brands.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I use this over my eye pencil, to help set the color. It works well but it&#x27;s a little darker than I expected. Once I put the dark color on, I brush it lightly with a clean eyebrow brush and it looks very natural. It doesn&#x27;t run or come off, even in hot, humid weather.</li>
    <li> I love this!!! Even went back and ordered some for my sister!!! I wear it daily &amp; will definetly order more:)</li>
    <li> Super easy and quick to use. The coverage is not quite as good as it would be with a powder but I think it&#x27;s a good way to fill in my brows in the mornings when I don&#x27;t have time to be precise with a powder.</li>
    <li> A little on the brow goes a long way but it does last and last.  It fills in &amp;#34;sparse&amp;#34; or gray-haired areas with a natural look.  Again, use a light touch when applying. I&#x27;ve not used the highlighter because I don&#x27;t care for shimmering products.  That&#x27;s just a personal preference and not a reflection on the product.  I bought it strictly for the brow filler.</li>
    <li> This is amazing!! My brows are thin due to age and hypothyroidism and partially gray so this lash building gel is exactly what I needed.  I bought it hoping it might help, but it&#x27;s even better than I thought!!  Love it and recommend it unconditionally!</li>
    <li> i really wanted to buy the Anastasia Beverly Hills brow gel but just not ready to pay that price yet, so wanted to try a more affordable product and I like this.

    <li> Not as expected.  Much lighter than described.</li>
    <li> Works well but need some hair.</li>
    <li> After debating for an hour or so on whether or not I should get the Anastasia brow gel or Benefit&#x27;s Gimme Brow for $22ish each or this for  $7, I opted to get this! I am pretty pleased with this product!  I have never used anything for my eyebrows before, but as a first time user, this was very easy to use. Looking at the wand with the color, you can see little hairs/fibers, which freaked me out at first, but they adhere nice and smooth, attaching to your existing hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The day after receiving this, my mom bought Benefit&#x27;s Gimme Brow, which also uses fibers to attach to the hair you already have. She said she couldn&#x27;t tell a difference with the end result! So why spend $20 when you could spend less than half of that? I like to use a brow pencil as well to add to my eyebrows, but in the pictures I provided, I did not use a pencil, just this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product to build up thickness in my brows, however when I went to put it on it was literally like a hair gel that never dried. I would not compare it to top brand brow builders whatsoever. When its this cheap expect cheap results. I would not buy this again.</li>

    <li> Maybe it&#x27;s me but this did nothing for my brows that mascara couldn&#x27;t do--it looks like mascara--goes on like mascara, smudge like mascara, etc., etc., so I am back to using my eyebrow pencil; it&#x27;s not worth it to return.</li>
