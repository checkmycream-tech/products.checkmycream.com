### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Wonderful product for winter skin problems.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Finally another amputee told me about this wonderful ointment, Aquaphor and I&#x27;ve been using it for years.</li>
      <li>probably one of the best healing ointments on the market.  </li>
      <li>Excellent product</li>
      <li>Since it isn&#x27;t perfect, we&#x27;ll give it 4 stars.</li>
      <li>It worked beautifully in all situations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The no touch applicator is great for adults, not helpful for baby.</li>
      <li>Yes it&#x27;s petroleum based, but that is one of the great things petroleum is great for.  </li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>Great price for three of these lotions.</li>
      <li>It worked great for me</li>

      <li>Fascinating to read about the history and development of petroleum jelly on Wikipedia.</li>

      <li>Greasy but works - good for times you can cover with socks and relax.</li>

      <li>I tried it on her, and it seemed to be okay, although she is not experiencing any irritation, yet.</li>
      <li>Many Years ago I was in an accident</li>
      <li>It takes about 5 seconds to pull the plastic tab off the top and then unscrew the applicator to rip off the foil underneath.  </li>
      <li>products that are more like a lotion.  </li>
      <li>It always does the job well, and what I like the most is there aren&#x27;t any overpowering fragrances to irritate you.  </li>
      <li>On the plus side, it keeps the grease off my hands and works ok to spread a filmy layer of ointment.</li>
      <li>Thankfully it has no detectable scent, but once you get some on your hands you better not be touching anything else.  </li>
      <li>You have more control over where the lotion goes.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
      <li>I also found it to be my favorite lip</li>
      <li>I have used Vaseline for many years on my lips, but I am now an Aquaphor fan for this use as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I find it to be more of a hassle than a help.  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>and we&#x27;ve tried more products than I can count.  </li>
      <li>You can put it on the top of your hands without getting it on the palms.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
      <li>She has tried many lotions and cremes with varying degrees of comfort, none doing all that well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love Aquaphor because</li>
      <li>I love love LOVE Aquaphor.  </li>
      <li>While this applicator is a good idea for any lotion, it is particularly useful for this texture and thickness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It works better than the prescription ointment my dermatologist prescribed, and I can order it when needed without a doctor visit.</li>
      <li>I can easily apply lotion to problem areas without getting the lotion on the palms of my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It absorbs quickly and is not greasy, so your skin looks and feels good quickly.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I personally liked the touch free applicator this comes packaged in and thought it was quite sanitary and easy to use without getting my hands greasy.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Aquaphor is our first stage of defense and it does a good job.  </li>
      <li>and it does a pretty good job.  </li>
      <li>that means the aquaphor must be a pretty good product.  </li>
      <li>Once you squeeze some of the ointment on your skin, the foam tip can be easily and comfortably used to rub in the ointment without having to use your hands!</li>
      <li>It is the best at rapid healing of dry, chapped, and damaged skin.  </li>
      <li>This is a good amount to have on hand - plenty, but not too much to carry in a pocket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>if the quality Eucerin lotion and the easy to uses applicator.  </li>
      <li>product is recommended my most physicians that I have gone to for my itchy problem and this container has a cool squashy orfice on it so that I can distribute the cream without using another hand.  </li>
      <li>So, go light -</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is a great product for healing irritated skin and one I wouldn&#x27;t be without, especially during the winter.</li>
      <li>It leaves a light film and should be applied</li>
      <li>Requires vigorous rubbing to apply hands free.</li>
      <li>I sound like a poster girl for the ointment</li>
      <li>/&gt;The primary drawback?</li>
      <li>As others have noted, this product is kind of greasy feeling and doesn&#x27;t really absorb well but</li>
      <li>Great for Tattoos, chapped lips, sunburns, especially the face/nose, cracked feet</li>
      <li>Anytime I&#x27;m getting a bit too raw, I rub a bit of this wonderful ointment on the area and the healing begins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I did not use the &amp;#34;touch free applicator on the Aquaphor since I am concerned about keeping it clean and uncontaminated.  </li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m really excited to have found this product.</li>
      <li>It does work great on chapped skin, dry parts of hands in the winter...</li>
      <li>Works great for dry skin</li>
      <li>- I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
      <li>I love it because it works well and fast.</li>
      <li>I gave it a try, and found it works better than straight Vaseline for this as well.  </li>
      <li>We&#x27;ve never had a full diaper rash</li>
      <li>This is great for putting on wounds or other areas that have eczema or irritation.</li>
      <li>Luckily, I did not need to do it that way.</li>
      <li>The winter flaky, cracked skin healed fairly quickly after we started using Aquaphor.  </li>
      <li>So while I can highly recommend what comes in the tube, the package design itself could be better.</li>
      <li>I have found that using an intensive moisturizer first, like vaseline lotion or curel, and then coating it with a very light layer of this protectant at night before bed to be really helpful in softening and healing skin.  </li>
      <li>There are many reasons why I like this new dispenser:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>We seem to use Aquaphor quite a bit at my house - the kids prefer it over Chap Stick because there is no taste or smell, and it&#x27;s also good for dry hands.  </li>
      <li>It does not get absorbed and if you wanted a mild waterproof coating on your hands this is probably the product for you.  </li>
      <li>This is an excellent product for the instant relief of dry skin or chapped lips.</li>
      <li>This stuff goes on with the consistency of petroleum jelly and provides a good barrier of protection for very dry or irritated skin, but it&#x27;s not something that absorbs well like a hand</li>
      <li>Gentle and scent free this product has an applicator also to avoid getting it anywhere but</li>
      <li>I just unscrew the top like the old version of this and don&#x27;t use it.  </li>
      <li>Well, the right leg has won out so</li>
      <li>a strong smell Aquaphor is an effective rescue that helps me in my uphill fight against skin dryness and one of the few products that I have been using for years and years.</li>
      <li>I liked this Aquaphor product but will likely not use it very often.  </li>
      <li>For this user it was a surprising mess that had to be removed with paper towels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very, very greasy.</li>
      <li>People, like me, who take diuretics daily have that medication affect the moisture of our skin and need something more than just a creamy and quick absorbing lotion to maintain the semblance of normalcy.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It takes a bit longer to &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; but it is an extremely effective curative treatment for very dry skin.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also good for any skin irritations, scratches or little scrapes.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried this product.  </li>
      <li>I question how sanitary this is, especially when there are more than one person using it.</li>
      <li>This does the job, but there are some things to be aware of first.  </li>
      <li>I was first introduced to Aquaphor when my son was a baby and suffered from eczema.</li>
      <li>(most of the time), but the ointment seems to gather at the rim of the applicator even after short use.</li>
      <li>thought the Aquaphor was okay, but it did not to work as well as Neutrogena Norwegian Hand Cream for me.  </li>
      <li>It is quite greasy at first, but eventually it will soak into your skin and hydrate it.  </li>
      <li>highly recommend Aquaphor!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I liked this Aquaphor product but will likely not use it very often.  It is based on petroleum jelly, so is quite greasy and not really for daytime use.  I used it on my hands prior to bed and it did soften up my hands and result in a water resistant layer that stayed on the next day for a few hand washings.  I also applied to my lips overnight and it worked fine, similar to Chapstick.  I did not use the &amp;#34;touch free applicator on the Aquaphor since I am concerned about keeping it clean and uncontaminated.  It seems to be a hard sponge-type ring that you can use to smear around the cream.  I just unscrewed the dark blue cap and it had a standard hole that the thick ointment squeezes out of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought the Aquaphor was okay, but it did not to work as well as Neutrogena Norwegian Hand Cream for me.  Norwegian Hand Cream made my hands softer, more hydrated (less wrinkled) and lasted longer than the Aquaphor.  I will likely not repurchase the Aquaphor.</li>
    <li> In the winter months I have occasional breakouts of severe dry skin and dermatitis, especially on my legs. I use Aquaphor Healing Ointment to provides an extra layer of protection on the irritated areas of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t apply the Aquaphor all-over, only on the affected area. First I use Eucerin&#x27;s daily moisturizer (or one of several other body-butters) to keep my dry skin from getting itchy and irritated. Then I apply the Aquaphor on the red flaky patches. It is a little greasy and takes a few minutes to absorb into the skin. It leaves a light film and should be applied sparingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually get relief from the itching and flaking skin overnight and within days the redness has faded. It works better than the prescription ointment my dermatologist prescribed, and I can order it when needed without a doctor visit. With no dyes, fragrances or preservatives, it&#x27;s gentle on my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bottle has a new-style touchless applicator. On the plus side, it keeps the grease off my hands and works ok to spread a filmy layer of ointment. On the negative side, it has a stiff feeling and ointment builds up at the edges and needs to be wiped off before the cap is put back on. Not a big problem, just something to remember or you will end up with a greasy cap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product for healing irritated skin and one I wouldn&#x27;t be without, especially during the winter. It also works well for chapped or cracked lips - my husband likes to use it for that.</li>
    <li> Aquaphor Healing Ointment is basically a version of the old standby Vaseline Petroleum Jelly marketed by the same  company that makes Eucerin.  It is not a moisturizer by a healing ointment intended to protect and soothe irritated and chapped skin.  It does prevents moisture loss without adding moisture.      I personally liked the touch free applicator this comes packaged in and thought it was quite sanitary and easy to use without getting my hands greasy.  This is a good product to have on hand during the winter months if you live in a cold weather climate where chapped lips and hands are a fact of life.</li>
    <li> Aquaphor has a good rep as a lip balm (it is odorless and tasteless) but it is an effective skin cream too.  I got a little careless with the grill, and Aquaphor (and an icecube) managed to prevent pain and blistering.  This is a good amount to have on hand - plenty, but not too much to carry in a pocket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The touch-free idea is that the tube ejects a blob of the cream (you only need a little) onto the applicator pad, which is the spongey blue end of the tip.  It&#x27;s a unique idea to my knowledge and very effective, though of course if you use only one hand, you have to thumb off the cap.  Luckily, I did not need to do it that way.</li>
    <li> The pediatrician recommended Aquaphor. It works well to heal dry skin and as a barrier to prevent and heal diaper rash. I use it for my dry, cracked hands and lips and I see improvement within a day. I love it because it works well and fast. So I always have some in our home. It does leave a greasy feel, even when applying a little, so I am careful as to when I apply it so I&#x27;m not touching and leaving it on everything. The 4 stars is because of the new &#x27;touch-free applicator&#x27;. I just bought a new tube with this and it&#x27;s pointless to me. Basically for the reasons others have described. I prefer the regular tube no applicator. Also, I think the statement on the tube &#x27;soft foam tip allows for convenient one hand use with no greasy feel&#x27; is misleading. It is greasy feeling once you apply and the applicator is messy. I really don&#x27;t mind the greasy feels as it&#x27;s just the nature of the product and what makes it work well.</li>
    <li> Great price for three of these lotions.</li>
    <li> Easy applicator tip is awesome!</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this ointment. I&#x27;ve been using it on my feet, which get very dry, especially when the weather is cold. Since using this stuff once per day, I&#x27;ve had no problems with dryness or cracking at all. It&#x27;s even helped my heels, which I thought might be beyond help. The touch-free applicator is great...makes the process easy and much less messy. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> ....for healing tattoos.</li>
    <li> What can I say about Aquaphor.  I use it for everything.  It is a joke in my house.  If you...use Aquaphor.  Great for Tattoos, chapped lips, sunburns, especially the face/nose, cracked feet, cuts on dogs, etc., etc., etc.</li>
    <li> Works great for dry skin</li>
    <li> The no touch applicator is great for adults, not helpful for baby. Requires vigorous rubbing to apply hands free. Great product.</li>
    <li> I love love LOVE Aquaphor.  My dermatologist gave me a sample as I am allergic to first aid ointments such as Bacitracin and Neosporin.  Aquaphor creates a skin shield and seals and protects while the skin is healing.  You just reapply after getting it wet.  Since the dry skin on my fingers sometimes cracks in the winter, I use Aquaphor instead of hand cream.  It is quite greasy at first, but eventually it will soak into your skin and hydrate it.  Which brings us to this new Touch-Free delivery system. Touch Free Application is a very good idea as I literally have to take two tissues to close the jar after applying it to my hands.  This applicator is easier to use because the cap just slides on and off.  There is a hard foam dark blue disk where the ointment comes out, and you just wipe off the Aquaphor there and pop the cap back on. It is an improvement over the screw on caps.  Whether you buy the old tube, or jar, or this new Touch-Free, just know it takes about 15 minutes for the ointment to soak into your hands.  Sometimes when in a hurry, I just wipe my hands on my arms or legs, or on a paper towel.  I feel Aquaphor works better on dry skin than any expensive hand creams I have used.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Aquaphor on my babies&#x27; bottoms whenever they&#x27;re a little red.  We&#x27;ve never had a full diaper rash so I stick with what works.  Having said that, the foam applicator on this is pretty nasty if you think about it.  You don&#x27;t want something to be used again.  I just unscrew the top like the old version of this and don&#x27;t use it.  There&#x27;s still the little spout so it&#x27;s not a big wide open circle and you can easily just get a little dab out without touching the rest of the tube.&lt;br /&gt; This has the consistency of Vaseline so it&#x27;s not for everyday moisturizing use.  It does work great on chapped skin, dry parts of hands in the winter... things like that.</li>
    <li> The lil lady has had an issue with her hands getting really red, itchy, cracked, dry, the whole nine yards. She has tried many lotions and cremes with varying degrees of comfort, none doing all that well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lately they were cracked so bad she was having trouble moving fingers without additional cracking and pain. This ointment immediately soothed her hands enough to where she can use them without pain and additional cracking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;re still trying to determine the reasons for the irritations, but at least with this lotion she can function. Since the problem areas are both hands, she doesn&#x27;t have much use for the sponge applicator, she just unscrews it and applies like a regular tube. For smaller areas the applicator woks well.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  My current chemotherapy makes my skin very fragile, and I use a lot of Udderly Smooth skin creme.  It&#x27;s good, but not easily transportable.  This Aquaphor Ointment is also great for my skin, with the added bonus that you can keep it in a purse and use it in a few seconds with no mess..</li>
    <li> As the nights get colder and the heat becomes a necessity, my skin suffers i the form of extreme dryness. Aquaphor has been a got to remedy in the past but frankly that megajar it came in meant it was hardly handy.  The 3 oz tube of Aquaphor Healing ointment can fit in the bed table drawer, a relief especially to dry cracked heels.  If you haven&#x27;t used Aquaphor before know that it is a little greasy when you first put it on, but it does provide a protective coating against the elements.</li>
    <li> We seem to use Aquaphor quite a bit at my house - the kids prefer it over Chap Stick because there is no taste or smell, and it&#x27;s also good for dry hands.  It always does the job well, and what I like the most is there aren&#x27;t any overpowering fragrances to irritate you.  Also, purchasing it here on Amazon in the larger size would be convenient as I only seem to find the small tubes of it at my local store.</li>
    <li> Eucerin&#x27;s lotion is a thick and effective moisturizer.  I love Aquaphor because if the quality Eucerin lotion and the easy to uses applicator.  I can easily apply lotion to problem areas without getting the lotion on the palms of my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It absorbs quickly and is not greasy, so your skin looks and feels good quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The size is convenient for one-handed use and travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend Aquaphor!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love Aquaphor Healing Ointment, I have loved it for years for my hands.  It is the best at rapid healing of dry, chapped, and damaged skin.  It is very similar to Avon&#x27;s Moisture Therapy Intensive Cream, but I actually prefer the Aquaphor because it absorbs more quickly.  Try it after a job that is hard on your hands, like yard work or painting (which normally would affect my skin for at least 24 hrs) and you&#x27;ll see how much better your skin feels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get a chapped place on my nose that is cracky and painful every year when the weather turns colder in the fall.  Every time, I have used Vaseline on it to heal it, and it takes about a week or longer.  Just a last week ago, the chappy place showed up for this fall, and I tried the Aquaphor instead.  I was thrilled to find it healed overnight, I still can&#x27;t quite believe it!  So thankful to not have to deal with this chapping for longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just noticed last week when dealing with my nose, that the bottle says it can be used on lips too.  I gave it a try, and found it works better than straight Vaseline for this as well.  I have used Vaseline for many years on my lips, but I am now an Aquaphor fan for this use as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative thing I have to say about this product is the touch-free applicator. I find it to be more of a hassle than a help.  It reminds me of the stain removers that come in bottles with a scrubber attached, which I also don&#x27;t care for and don&#x27;t buy anymore.  They spread alright, but make a mess of the bottle, and product is left behind smeared around on the applicator.  I am not a clean freak, but this is still weird to me. I prefer to unscrew the applicator as if it were a lid, and dispense the product straight from the tube.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product for the instant relief of dry skin or chapped lips. Gentle and scent free this product has an applicator also to avoid getting it anywhere but the place you want it applied. The applicator makes me want to be the only one that uses it however and it does leave a greasy feeling and is slow to absorb into the skin. However it is a very effective product for hydration and healing of any skin area that needs it.</li>
    <li> This stuff goes on with the consistency of petroleum jelly and provides a good barrier of protection for very dry or irritated skin, but it&#x27;s not something that absorbs well like a hand cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to use it mostly for my hands and feet that get really dry as the weather gets colder, but I always put cotton socks and cotton gloves after I apply it, because it&#x27;s an ointment and I don&#x27;t want greasiness all over my clothing or bedding. It&#x27;s also good for any skin irritations, scratches or little scrapes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The touch-free applicator isn&#x27;t that helpful to me because I&#x27;m not going to apply it to the the bottom of my feet and then put some on my lips or face using the same applicator. Ickk. Maybe if you&#x27;re using the tube for only one purpose (like diaper rash for instance), then the touch-free applicator might be useful. Just mark the tube somehow so you don&#x27;t forget, lol...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ointment itself is pretty good as long as you don&#x27;t mind the gooey petroleum consistency, but a regular tube or a tub container might be better if you&#x27;re using it for multiple purposes. 3.5 stars.</li>
    <li> I have a particularly dry skin, especially in the colder weather months. The tops of my arms itch so badly that at times I could draw blood scratching them. In the past, I&#x27;ve used cortisone-based creams, and skin lotions to help with this. They will give me temporary relief, and then I repeat the process. Aquaphor is different. It goes on thick and greasy. It protects the skin and seals it to contain the moisture and prevent dryness. There is no analgesic in it, nor menthol or steroid. It is basically petroleum jelly with a few inactive ingredients. It does the trick on my dry arms. It also works on my knuckles.&lt;br /&gt;My wife just began radiation treatments and I noticed a brochure for Aquaphor in the lobby. It is recommended for healing the skin where the radiation is applied. I tried it on her, and it seemed to be okay, although she is not experiencing any irritation, yet. I assume it would work on minor burns too.&lt;br /&gt;The applicator is there but I don&#x27;t see any purpose other than keeping the grease off your hands. I question how sanitary this is, especially when there are more than one person using it. You can still apply it manually, however, and avoid using the applicator.&lt;br /&gt;I marked this down one star, because I think it is too high-priced for what you get.</li>
    <li> Aquaphor works like magic on skinned knees or other common abrasions such as carpet burns.  You just coat the area with some Aquaphor, and it coats and soothes the area.  You can even put a bandage over the treated area for extra protection.  I think it promotes clotting and scabbing to it starts healing faster, and it also keeps dirt out of the area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried it as a ointment for dry/cracked skin and I actually prefer other products for that use case...products that are more like a lotion.  As others have noted, this product is kind of greasy feeling and doesn&#x27;t really absorb well but instead coats and promotes healing.  The applicator on this is only OK, not a key feature in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, every household medical kit should have at least a small dose of Aquaphor in it.</li>
    <li> I like the idea of this balm. I&#x27;m not sure I like the balm because it is petroleum based but haven&#x27;t we been using petroleum based for most of our lives?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve done a little experiment with myself using this product.  At bedtime and after my shower I put this balm on my right leg and foot and my other cream that is somewhat petroleum based on my left foot and leg in a slathering motion.  Well, the right leg has won out so that means the aquaphor must be a pretty good product.  I am a middle aged woman who has lost most of the moisture I ever had in my body.  Taking a shower takes the rest of it out so after my shower I am all itchy and I have a 30 minute session of trying to put it all back on or in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is recommended my most physicians that I have gone to for my itchy problem and this container has a cool squashy orfice on it so that I can distribute the cream without using another hand.  Simply remove the lid and squeeze for the cream to come out and proceed to rub it around with a somewhat harder sponge that is on one end of the tube.  It worked great for me but if I were a little older and had arthritis I might find it difficult to disperse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thought that although the disperser spongy thing might work it also might hold germs....or not.</li>
    <li> Aquaphor Healing Ointment is 41% petrolatum jelly.  Thick sticky goo.  Thankfully it has no detectable scent, but once you get some on your hands you better not be touching anything else.  You will be leaving this &amp;#34;ointment&amp;#34; on every surface you touch. It does not get absorbed and if you wanted a mild waterproof coating on your hands this is probably the product for you.  Or maybe a burn victim who would be wrapping their hands up right after application.  For this user it was a surprising mess that had to be removed with paper towels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are other products that can heal and product your hands, and the majority of them are not quite the mess this product is.  Not recommended.</li>
    <li> I was first introduced to Aquaphor when my son was a baby and suffered from eczema. That&#x27;s when I realized how helpful it could be for my hands in the winter when they become incredibly dry and cracked, sometimes to the point of bleeding. I also found it to be my favorite lip treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The primary drawback? It&#x27;s very, very greasy. I know that&#x27;s almost an necessity when it comes to dry skin treatment. But rubbing it in can be a mess. I find myself wanting to use it, but having to wait because I know I need to be on the computer or doing other things with my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that is where this particular packaging of Aquaphor comes in very, very handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This 3 oz tube has a foam tip applicator instead of the normal lotion lid. Once you squeeze some of the ointment on your skin, the foam tip can be easily and comfortably used to rub in the ointment without having to use your hands! In fact, the applicator is so effective that I have been able to reduce the amount of ointment I use because it massages the ointment into my skin much more effectively than my fingers can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this applicator on smooth stretches of skin such a legs or torso. But, I&#x27;ve also used it to work the ointment into extremely dry patches between my fingers. It worked beautifully in all situations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that the foam applicator takes some getting used to as far as how much ointment to use. It&#x27;s easy to get too much, especially if you&#x27;re used to using Aquaphor. And, it doesn&#x27;t pull back into the tube if you over-squeeze. It just gets caught in the foam. So, go light - you can always squeeze out more!</li>
    <li> This is great for putting on wounds or other areas that have eczema or irritation. It is a little expensive here (not sure what the price is at the store) but you only use a small amount. I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> Greasy but works - good for times you can cover with socks and relax.</li>
    <li> The applicator really can be manipulated with one hand.  This is an advantage if one is squeamish about ointments, or has limited use or reach with the hand needed to apply. The petrolatum ointment is the good product we have come to expect from the Aquaphor brand.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve used Aquaphor for years as part of our care for our son&#x27;s eczema under the direction of his dermatologist.  He&#x27;s mostly grown out of it, to the point where we rarely need things like topical steroids, but we still use Aquaphor and Cerave to treat dry spots before they get worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aquaphor is our first stage of defense and it does a good job.  If we catch things early enough a few treatments usually does the trick.  Depending on how he&#x27;s doing we will alternate with Cerave.  We&#x27;ve also used Aquaphor to help prevent diaper rash on our toddlers if we happen to run out of Vaseline and it does a pretty good job.  Overall Aquaphor is one of our go-to products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However the &amp;#34;Touch-Free Applicator&amp;#34; on this leaves a lot to be desired.  It&#x27;s no less messy than a normal tube and since the lid isn&#x27;t flip top you can&#x27;t use it one-handed.  Instead you have to use one hand to take off the cap, squirt out some ointment and then put the cap back on.  If it&#x27;s just you, that&#x27;s a minor hassle.  If you are trying to get it on a young child that a hassle you can definitely do without.  So while I can highly recommend what comes in the tube, the package design itself could be better.</li>
    <li> This does the job, but there are some things to be aware of first.  This is not a moisturizer,  as one might expect.  It&#x27;s actually a protective coating for damaged skin.  It&#x27;s also somewhat heavy and oily or greasy.  I have lots of problems with eczema, dermatitis and just plain scaly dry skin, not to mention cracked heels and hands in cold weather.  I have found that using an intensive moisturizer first, like vaseline lotion or curel, and then coating it with a very light layer of this protectant at night before bed to be really helpful in softening and healing skin.  Also, not a huge fan of the applicator here, It&#x27;s a low quality sponge type applicator, with a hole in the middle where the ointment comes out.  Unfortunately, it&#x27;s really not easy to use, and if you want to carry this in your bag or purse, you have the added problem of the product leftover on the adhesive getting on the cap, then in your bag, etc.  I prefer just opening the top as if the applicator is not even there, which renders that little extra totally useless for me.</li>
    <li> I got this with the idea of putting it on my poor cracked heels, and the product and no-touch applicator work very well for that.  Just keep it by the desk and put it on whenever, not adding to the morning or night-time already lengthy ritual. I googled petrolatum, and found out it&#x27;s petroleum jelly. Fascinating to read about the history and development of petroleum jelly on Wikipedia. However, I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily want to use this on chapped lips after applying it to feet, just sayin&#x27;.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried this product.  It takes about 5 seconds to pull the plastic tab off the top and then unscrew the applicator to rip off the foil underneath.  I&#x27;m not really sure what the purpose of the applicator is; it&#x27;s not really touch-free because the ointment comes out in a glob and you pretty much have to use your hands to rub it in, or at least \\&quot;try\\&quot; to rub it in.  Plus the applicator is way too big if you want to use it on your lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like I&#x27;m putting petroleum jelly on my hands it&#x27;s so greasy (and the tube has written on it \\&quot;no greasy feel\\&quot;).  The only active ingredient in this is 41% Petrolatum, commonly known as petroleum jelly (I looked up Petrolatum on Google).  I even did a test; on one hand I put petroleum jelly and on the other this Aquaphor and I couldn&#x27;t really tell any difference in the feel or greasiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After putting a small glob of this on my hands (which get very dry here in the desert), I rub lotion on top so my hands don&#x27;t feel as greasy and so I could actually use my hands without leaving grease marks everywhere (like on the tube itself). For me this is way too greasy to use on a regular basis, but I will use it when my skin gets so dry it cracks.</li>
    <li> Many Years ago I was in an accident and I became an amputee. After getting a prosthesis, some of the areas on my body became raw and painful with all the new rubbing to areas of my body that were never rubbed like this before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried several different creams and lotions, but relief was hard to find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally another amputee told me about this wonderful ointment, Aquaphor and I&#x27;ve been using it for years. Anytime I&#x27;m getting a bit too raw, I rub a bit of this wonderful ointment on the area and the healing begins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always keep a tube of this miracle ointment around me, it really helps.</li>
    <li> A bit pricey but probably one of the best healing ointments on the market.  My husband and I suffer from extremely dry skin and we&#x27;ve tried more products than I can count.  I went online and the medical experts recommended staying away from lotions and anything with a high alcohol content.  Of the 5 ingredients recommended for an ointment, this product had 4 of them.  My hands have never been so soft and my husband has had the same result. The winter flaky, cracked skin healed fairly quickly after we started using Aquaphor.  We&#x27;re using it on other dry body areas and are thrilled with the results.  If you don&#x27;t like petroleum jelly (i.e. Vaseline), this is not the product for you. It takes awhile to work into the skin and I usually wind up wiping my palms so as not to get my keyboard all messy.  As an extra bonus, it has a soft foam applicator that keeps the mess to a minimum. Excellent product - I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it. I sound like a poster girl for the ointment but I&#x27;m really excited to have found this product.</li>
    <li> I use Aquaphor Healing Ointment on my 5 month old baby&#x27;s red scaly patches on his tummy and chest. I actually didn&#x27;t know that it was primarily a protectant and not a moisturizer. Although I needed more of a moisturizer AND protectant, I am still very happy with this product. I just apply it with the applicator on his chest and tummy and then zip his jammies up without ever even rubbing it in. I do like that you don&#x27;t have to get your hands greasy with it (most of the time), but the ointment seems to gather at the rim of the applicator even after short use. I don&#x27;t mind, but I did have to rub it off with my hands eventually (hence, making the whole touch-free applicator pointless). I love that there is no smell, and its gentle enough for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Our son has very sensitive skin on his face.  He also has a tendency to stick his tongue out and lick the corner of his mouth when he&#x27;s concentrating really hard (I know, a little odd, right?).  Anyway, this causes him to get some really bad rash on the corners of his mouth (not his lips).  Regular lotion actually makes it burn and chapstick doesn&#x27;t seem to cut it.  This aquaphor is the only thing we&#x27;ve found that actually seems to work. We will just put a little on his skin (not lips) at bedtime and usually by morning the red area is completely gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The applicator tip works for wide areas of skin, but not small areas of skin.  It is too hard to spread on small areas of skin.  So, you&#x27;ll still end up using your finger.  Since it isn&#x27;t perfect, we&#x27;ll give it 4 stars.</li>
    <li> My 6 year old son had this strange habit of licking his bottom lip.  Sometimes he can lick it so much throughout the day that his bottom lip becomes red, raw, and dry.  This is the type of situation in which you would use Aquaphor Healing Ointment.  First off, it&#x27;s going to protect the raw area from the elements.  And in my son&#x27;s case, it&#x27;s going to protect his skin from his tongue.  Yes it&#x27;s petroleum based, but that is one of the great things petroleum is great for.  That was what we were using prior.  The touch-free applicator makes is so much easier to apply rather than spreading around a glob of petroleum jelly with out finger.</li>
    <li> There are many reasons why I like this new dispenser:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I have used Aquaphor in the past and have found it to be very effective in keeping moisture in and re-moisturizing very dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;2. Your hands don&#x27;t get messy. You can put it on the top of your hands without getting it on the palms.&lt;br /&gt;3. You have more control over where the lotion goes.&lt;br /&gt;4. You are less likely to over-squeeze and end up with more lotion than you really need and have to find other places to put it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who are not familiar with Aquaphor, it&#x27;s important to note that it is a thicker lotion than most hand/body lotions or creams. It is closer in consistency to Vaseline (a bit softer), a sort of jelly. While this applicator is a good idea for any lotion, it is particularly useful for this texture and thickness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes a bit longer to &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; but it is an extremely effective curative treatment for very dry skin. People, like me, who take diuretics daily have that medication affect the moisture of our skin and need something more than just a creamy and quick absorbing lotion to maintain the semblance of normalcy. Not that I don&#x27;t use creams as well but, without being medicinal or having a strong smell Aquaphor is an effective rescue that helps me in my uphill fight against skin dryness and one of the few products that I have been using for years and years.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product for winter skin problems.</li>
