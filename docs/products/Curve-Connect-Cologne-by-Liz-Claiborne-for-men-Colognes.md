      <li>Should I say more, when a woman say you smell great the product pay itself.</li>
      <li>The smell is quite good, but honestly when it comes to longevity, it doesn&#x27;t stay for a couple of minutes even.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love it smells good and it  came as promised</li>
    <li> It has a nice fresh air smell will a small hint of cedar wood. Everyone loves it and its one of my favorites. The price is usually always very affordable on Amazon.</li>
    <li> fragancia poco duradera</li>
    <li> Ladies love it point blank period</li>
    <li> THIS PERFUM MAKE ME CRAZY IS THE BEST, LOVE THE FRAGANCE AND THE SHIPPING WAS FASTER, I RECOMEND U :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay, the smell is a little out dated and doesn&#x27;t last very long.  It&#x27;s definitely for a younger age group.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband for Christmas. Should have done my research before hand. Smells a little to woodsy for me. But he seems to like it.</li>
    <li> Out of all of the Curve products I&#x27;ve tried this so far has been the best...a nice soft scent that will get attention when someone is in your radius</li>
    <li> Very weak fragrance which doesn&#x27;t last. Good for after shower spray, but not for impressing ladies. I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> Received item quickly and as described, thanks!</li>
    <li> i got this for my dad and he loved it very much</li>
    <li> My son loved it the scent of this curve connect. He already used this for long time.</li>
    <li> I bought this for myself a couple weeks ago.  Its a great scent...not too strong, but not too weak.  Would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Fairly middle ground fragrance, just ok, lasts awhile just the scent itself is ok, take it or leave it you won&#x27;t be missing out.</li>
    <li> Will buy again!!! Great Product...Great Seller!!</li>
    <li> Not a good buy from the Curve line, expected more from Curve, wears off in less than 1 hr. Bought it for my husband who was not impressed.</li>
    <li> my favorite love the smell</li>
    <li> Smells great the girls love it!!</li>
    <li> Wonderful, always turn heads and get compliments whenever I wear this scent</li>
    <li> I picked this up on the recommendation of a friend and being on sale for like 15 bucks I figured what the heck nothing really to lose. Turned out to be a great scent and smells exactly the same as the sample I got at the mall so I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s the real deal and at an unbelievable price. All in all I couldn&#x27;t be happier got a great cologne at a great price</li>
    <li> Has this sort of cherry scent. Smell good</li>
    <li> I like this scent. Very sweet smelling like cherry pie filling or something bit in a good way</li>
    <li> My NEW favorite cologne.. Curve hit a GRAND SLAM Home Run with Connect!! Drives my wife crazy haha, and randoms can&#x27;t get enough of it when i&#x27;m out with the fellas.. Also, for the price, I&#x27;d not think twice about gifting it to my friends n family..</li>
    <li> Decent smell, cheap price.... Overall just OK.  Doesn&#x27;t last very long on skin, stays a little longer on clothing.</li>
    <li> Softer sweeter, woody scent.  Good evening scent. I still favor original curve. But this is nice and the price was very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Powder, floral, spice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like a bouquet of white flowers in a cedar wood vase.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews before I bought this item and to my surprise my bf really loved it he really don&#x27;t like change but I don&#x27;t like old spice do it does smell pretty nice on him</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like like this fragrance at all, the curve crush is great,love the chill but I am so sorry i bought this fragrance for my husband. It smell so horrible on him I could not take the scent so i just threw it in the garbage. My Son loves the curve Chill because, girls tend to hug him more when he wears it.</li>
    <li> I received my order very promptly as promised.  Although, I was surprised to see that the bottle looked a little different than the one shown.  Mine actually was clear except for a band around the bottom.  I actually recall the scent lasting longer the past times I have purchased the cologne directly from a store, but it could just be me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,</li>
    <li> My daughter chose this for her Daddy at Christmas,he enjoys very much and uses everyday,I hope he gets something just as nice next year</li>
    <li> Ah, here it is then, finally. But...it smells Really good Still compare to others i have tried , ladies love to smell it when their are near me. just wonderful</li>
    <li> Great cologne! Decided i needed to get myself more cologne!. so i thought about Curve. Ive heard people talk about it and in the malls and etc its rather expensive!. Ordered it online, shipped fast and before you know it, it was here and I WAS USING IT! Great service , would recommend</li>
    <li> I smelled this in a store the other day.  It is identical to Axe Excite (the purple one).  If you like that, then you should get it.</li>
    <li> Smells awesome,and last all day.</li>
    <li> The smell is quite good, but honestly when it comes to longevity, it doesn&#x27;t stay for a couple of minutes even. I even spray in between 10 to 15 sprays each time, and I can barely smell it, it&#x27;s projection is so weak.</li>
    <li> This keeps me smelling super good all day. A couple sprays and I&#x27;m&lt;br /&gt;Out the door. Girls always tell me I smell good. Love it</li>
    <li> I also bought this one for my husband for his Christmas present. so hopefully he will love this one to. First time he will try it. Smells Nice scent is heavy when you first spray it on.But Fades away after you wear it.</li>
    <li> Love this scent and great price for there big bottle.</li>
    <li> for the price, this is worth it. scent last throughout the day and it is not too strong. i would recommend to someone who wand a cheap everyday cologne.</li>
    <li> The shipment was really fast and i love the service from Amazon everything i get from u i awesome. I like the perfume a lot and is going to be a gift for my boyfriend in Valenti&#x27;s Day, so i am sure he gonna like too.</li>
    <li> This is a very large bottle for a great price, honestly this is not my favorite cologne but I wanted to try it out. I doubt I will ever purchase this again but I do recommend this cologne for a younger male.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best for the younger generation&lt;br /&gt;Awesome price for a large bottle&lt;br /&gt;Fast easy shipping and I was happy over all</li>
    <li> This is a great cologne for dates or when your trying to impress someone. This is one of the best smelling colognes I have ever used</li>
    <li> I LOVE THE WAY THIS SMELLS. MAKES MY MOUTH WATER FOR MY HUSBAND. THE ONLY DOWN IS THAT OTHER WOMEN LIKE THE WAY IT SMELLS TOO! LOL!</li>
    <li> I have it Ginny girlfriend. Smells nice but is too fruity for me</li>
    <li> This is a scent that is no longer manufactured, according to some of the perfume retailers that I have spoken to. For this reason, I was suprised when I  found it on Amazon. When I opened it, the bottle and packaging seemed identical to the one I bought directly from a store a few years ago. However, after a few sprays, it&#x27;s apparent that this is either a knockoff or a watered down version of the original scent. It is not strong and hardly smells like the original, it smells more like hand sanitizer. This is common fake perfumes, such as ones you would find at a swap meet</li>
    <li> The cologne leaks out the nozzle whenever the cologne is being sprayed. It appears to be the nozzle head that is at fault and for this reason I am not pleased with the item I received.</li>
    <li> I love Curve products, I got this for my boyfriend and I love when he wears this! Of course nothing beats the original mens Curve, but this smells awesome</li>
    <li> My husband loves this cologne!!!</li>
    <li> A friend was telling me to try this cologne, he said the ladies love it and it was no lie. Gotta have more.</li>
    <li> my girlfriend at the time loved this smell.&lt;br /&gt;Couldn&#x27;t get her hands off me.&lt;br /&gt;A smell you won&#x27;t go back on and it won&#x27;t disappoint.&lt;br /&gt;I could go as far as saying that this is the best smelling cologne I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
    <li> Smell is ok but it lasts just a few minutes. I was disappointed with this product. I won&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> I like the scent, and you get quite a bit for the money, but the scent doesn&#x27;t last a long time.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful sexy fragrance for a man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is bold, spicy and refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Makes ladies want to slide their seat a little closer just to get a whiff of this wonderful scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice smell that is mellow and a tad fruity. It doesn&#x27;t seem to last the day though compared to some others I have had.</li>
    <li> Very different for curve ,but very good smelling</li>
    <li> I love this perfume since I was 14. now I&#x27;m 19 and still love it! The smell is awesome, makes you feel confident with yourself, and let me talk about compliments: 10/10. 100% recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Shipment was super fast. I ordered it on april 10th, and received on april 11th.</li>
    <li> I  found this cologne at a local Marshalls. The .5oz for $dollars. It smelled so good, I had to have more. Thank you Amazon, couldn&#x27;t find it know place else.</li>
    <li> GOT THIS AS A FATHERS DAY GIFT, AND SUCH A GOOD PRICE.</li>
    <li> I do not know what happened with the first couple of sprays but after using it for a while, i must say it is pretty good. the scent last for the day and it is not loud. it gives off a kind of smooth sexy smell.</li>
    <li> My husband &amp; daughter loved this, my daughter was here when he opened his gifts, &amp; she fell in love with it. Great choice!!</li>
    <li> A very nice and sensual cologne plus its at a great price I would definatly recommend it  to anyone who likes the brand</li>
    <li> Cologne smells very good. Love the curve products! If you like the others you&#x27;ll love this</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS COLOGNE AND BUYING IT THRU AMAZON HAS MADE IT EVEN MORE ENJOYABLE. THE PRICE I PAID FOR THIS ENABLED ME TO PURCHASE ANOTHER ONE TOO, NOW YOU CAN&#x27;T BEAT THAT CAN YOU. I LOVE AMAZON AND WILL PURCHASE EVERYTHING FROM THEM FROM NOW ON, YOU SHOULD TOO.</li>
    <li> He smell so good.......i could jus eat him up and i like boobs so its like a win win for me</li>
    <li> very nice smell !....its a good cologne spray i really don&#x27;t no what more to say !...ok the next time I just won&#x27;t write a review !...to many words required !</li>
    <li> I smelled this on a male coworker of mine and was intoxicated. I was actually surprised when he told me it was Curve cologne. It smells sooooo good and was purchased as a Christmas gift.  The price was good and the shipping was fast.</li>
    <li> Husband didn&#x27;t like it as much as I did.Had too much of a fruity coconut smell for him.I ended up using it on my 8 year old son after his morning routine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not in to giving bad reviews so I won&#x27;t but this is ok at its best its cool for the money if your just getting it and you have many other colognes to pick from but don&#x27;t make this your top pick i won&#x27;t i have 2 other curve&#x27;s curve crush and curve wave and this don&#x27;t compare to them in my sight but its a cool buy for a back you cologne</li>
    <li> Great product and Great service! I&#x27;m a happy Client!</li>
    <li> Great quality and quantity for the price, no issues shipping arrived way earlier than expected, very satisfied overall, will purchase again in future.</li>
    <li> I give it a 1☆ because the scent literally lasted for 5 seconds had to spray all over until someone recognized I had this on</li>
    <li> Not a fan. Perhaps I got a bad bottle, but mine did not smell good. It smelled more like unisex perfume mixed with air freshener. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend. I used it on my laundry in the drier because I felt bad for wasting it. I am getting a better cologne next time.</li>
    <li> It a mind blowing fragrance filled with an array of flavors. Whether your out on the town, a casual bistro,  or just entertaining at home. This scent will have people guessing.  I simply love the scent. Its an ice breaker, so don&#x27;t fumble, cause you&#x27;ll be wondering about the one that got away.</li>
    <li> GREAT VALUE FOR THE PRICE. PRICED HIGHER IN STORE.</li>
    <li> My has been looking for this cologne for me for over a year. It smells great and shipped fast.</li>
    <li> this scent is unbelievable! my girl cant get enough of it every time i spritz a little on my shirt</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way. This fragrance, although light in it&#x27;s scent, carries a somewhat fresh and captivating odour. It&#x27;s a fragrance that you can Connect with  immediately!</li>
    <li> Great price for $17. These usually cost like $30 at target. Smells good.The bottle is just red, the cologne is clear.</li>
    <li> I bought this cologne for my grandson for xmas and I just know he will love it! And I loved the price!</li>
    <li> The cologne was perfect for my son who didn&#x27;t like the original Curve cologne. It smells good. A good value &amp; fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Gave it as a Christmas gift to my 19 year old son and he loved it. Great price.</li>
    <li> Good price, but I guess there may be a reason for the ones that cost $75. I took a shower, gave myself a shot of this Curve Connect and my wife didn&#x27;t even notice it... seems like I may have gotten colored water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I certainly don&#x27;t understand the posts where the significant other was all over the man wearing this stuff, unless they have the olfactory ability of a German Shepherd.</li>
    <li> I love this cologne..it was more than I had expected can&#x27;t have enough of it will be sure to buy again. I am loving it.</li>
    <li> Smells good on my husband.. Nice and light! The scent lingers</li>
    <li> Orderd without smelling it good choice. Recommend if anyone is reading post and trying to order. And the price is great</li>
    <li> This cologne does not have any distinctive scent. I think it is best I had bought it in store instead of online. Then maybe I would have gotten the real thing. I am sure what I was sold was not genuine.</li>
    <li> During valentines day me and my husbsnd was in Macy&#x27;s he smell it and and said wow this smells good but it was a bit pricey,i came home went on amazon when i saw the price their was not questions ask an it came on valentine day this is a must have</li>
    <li> I love Curve, it&#x27;s my favorite Cologne on my husband. However this just didn&#x27;t work for us. It does have a cinnimon odor but hard to describe. Won&#x27;t order this again.</li>
    <li> Great price great product. The ladies love it on my sexy body. Has unique smell. Not musky not fruity .different but good. You wont regret.stay up player......</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t wait to use it. It smells amazing and the scent really lingers and last for a long time. I would definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> This cologne is on the sweeter side and smells very nice. Unfortunately I cannot rate it too highly because it simply does not last very long on my skin. I&#x27;m talking 3-4 hours at the most. I have to reapply at least once during the day, and if I&#x27;m out all day forget it. Happy with the smell, but very disappointed in the longevity.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews i knew i had to have went out an bought a bottle the 4 oz bottle is HUGE for the money actually under $20.00 dollars. The fragrance is MASCULINE yet subtle ..surely to attract the opposite sex .FACE IT ..THIS IS WHY WE BUY COLOGNE !! WE WANT THE FEED BACK FROM FEMALES!!! AN THIS ONE WILL DO IT !!!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about buying cologne I had never heard of or smelled. I&#x27;ve always been a fan of Curve products so I figured this couldn&#x27;t be that bad. I just opened the package and it smells amazing. I think this might be my new favorite fragrance.  I&#x27;m about to order another bottle just in case they decide to stop making this soon.</li>
    <li> I love the sweet fragrance of this cologne even do is kind of chip but  it&#x27;s a good quality the fragrance stays on the clothes even after washing it.</li>
    <li> I get compliments from women at work when I use it. Should I say more, when a woman say you smell great the product pay itself.</li>
    <li> It smells nice. It only takes one or two sprays and you will be good to go. dont know what else to say since its going to be personal preference if you like the smell.</li>
    <li> I should have gotten my usual one instead, this is okay, worth the money and that is all to it. Smell does not last long!</li>
    <li> Biggest chick magnet since Elvis shook his hips!</li>
    <li> I personally love curve, unique smell, brand new and you cant beat that at a good price. Highly reccomend it.</li>
    <li> This is for a gift.  It&#x27;s a wonderful fragrance and a great value.</li>
    <li> it smell good but it doesn&#x27;t last at all. I barely smell it, I know I shouldn&#x27;t smell it and others might smell it even if I don&#x27;t. In this case is not like this, you can notice the scent only if you put your nose on the shirt. It would be awesome if it last at least a pair of hours.</li>
    <li> Love the smell. Received a lot of compliments. This is one of the few places that have it for a great price. definitely going to continue purchasing this from here</li>
    <li> LADY KILLER SMELLS GREAT WITH LOTS OF POSITIVE COMPLIMENTS</li>
    <li> Not as good as the original men&#x27;s curve... but this is a good one to alternate with. Might be nice to purchase with another curve, as well.... so you don&#x27;t get immune to the smell. Its a super strong scent... but I still like it on my husband. Very masculine &amp; not too overpowering.</li>
    <li> I have used this Curve product for a few years and really like it.  Can&#x27;t find a better deal than online.  My wife also appreciates it&#x27;s fragrance.</li>
    <li> This scent is soooooooo great. It&#x27;s delicious and intoxicating. My husband wears this and I can&#x27;t get enough of it. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> this perfume sends him to Venezuela</li>
    <li> From the time I first got a whiff of this cologne she three years ago it has ranked as one of my most beloved fragrances. I highly recommend it to those who like hints of tobacco flower and related base notes.</li>
    <li> This cologne gets you a lot of attention ..lasts all day. Smells great ....must buy .I always use this cologne...its my secret weapon.</li>
    <li> This cologne I like too its have a good smell</li>
    <li> Regular curve is much manlier than this. I wear it anyway but I&#x27;m pretty confident in my manhood. Not the best though,</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the smell of this cologne. People are SHOCKED to know it&#x27;s made by Curve. I love having a great smelling cologne at a even fantastic price!!! Good buy!!! Women really dig the smell of cologne.</li>
    <li> Smells good but doesn&#x27;t last all day</li>
    <li> Cologne arrived right on time and perfectly as described. This item is worth every dollar I paid for it. 4.2 oz of one of my favorite scents for under $20 is almost a steal!</li>
    <li> es muy bueno y tiene una fragancia suave y le encanta a mi esposa lo recomiendo aroma 24/7</li>
    <li> I knew this cologne would smell good before i even bought it, mainly because I am pretty sure a woman knows what a man should smell like.</li>
    <li> its pretty good, i liked it.</li>
    <li> Cool! this is an attention, getter!</li>
    <li> Apart from the fact that I was unhappy with the packaging, the perfume was already used. Not happy at all. Did not meet my expectations.</li>
    <li> This product goes hard for the money it costs. I spray it on when I go out with the fellas, or while playing sports it gives me the edge because women don&#x27;t expect a guy to wear cologne at the gym but this is perfect for it.</li>
    <li> I like the smell, although when you first spray it it seems a bit feminine/flowery, but throughout the day it sustains a nice pleasant scent.  Have already gotten compliments on it, and the bottle is actually very large for the price you pay.</li>
    <li> It smells alright. It has a strong smell, and it gives me a head ache though. But as long as if my husband won&#x27;t spray much on him, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
    <li> The smell is clean and sexy, masculine for sure, with woodsy and mildly sweet under-tones.  My only objection...Smells great but its appealing aroma is gone way too soon!  My husband smells wonderful when he wears it and so does the immediate environment where he sprays.  It&#x27;s a delicious cloud of \\&quot;come hither!\\&quot;  Love it!</li>
    <li> My Curve came in record time and the amount of product for the price I paid was outstanding compared to major dept stores. PLuss the co did a nice job on packing and value add samples of other wonderful aromas. Great Job.</li>
    <li> Bought this due to cousin saying her husband would like this at Christmas exchange we due every year. Found out though it was HER that liked it lol  But no complaints, he likes it as well.</li>
    <li> Smells like cheap cologne, I don&#x27;t know, is not for me</li>
    <li> Amazing smell, my wife approved after just 2 sprays. Will definitely re-buy.</li>
    <li> Love this item the best of all the curve at amazon I think never can really tell because amazon has so much great products but I give curve connect 5 stars any day!!</li>
    <li> This curve is ok I have had most of the others and they was much better but that just my opinion.</li>
    <li> Exact item I was looking for at a great price. Smells good, the ladies love it. Can&#x27;t go wrong with buying it.</li>
    <li> Where i live this cologne is about 35-45 Dollars per bottle i bought 2 of these for myself so they can last me a long time. The shipping was super fast and a lot of girls love this. It has a smooth smell to it. Its not a strong cheap smell like a lot of colognes out there. I have been using this cologne for about 5-6 years now and i don&#x27;t get tired of it. Who would with such good results and such a great price. I&#x27;ll buy another as soon as I&#x27;m down to one bottle.</li>
    <li> This cologne for the price is the best in quality and quantity. I recomend thisproduct.&lt;br /&gt;Liz Clairbone have great scences for all type of persons!</li>
    <li> I believe the toilet spray smells better then the cologne but still a great smell</li>
    <li> Hard to find this scent in stores and it is my sons favorite.</li>
    <li> Amazing smell not to strong not to weak I were it almi every day</li>
    <li> This is the first time I purchased this cologne and I like it better than the original. I was really surprised with the scent of this product It is a very pleasant scent. I will recommend this cologne to everyone.</li>
    <li> Smell&#x27;s  good and last all day, nice light smell.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorites Colgne but this curve red from Amazon i order didnt smell like the same one in Macy&#x27;s.I would not recommend this colgne to no one..</li>
    <li> Thank you! Very fast!!</li>
    <li> Bought this as a Christmas gift for my future brother in law.  He loved it.  Great product and would highly recommend if you are a fan of curve.</li>
    <li> Not bad. A bit stronger than most Curve colognes.</li>
    <li> great deal and great scent</li>
    <li> I prefer regular curve.</li>
    <li> Excellent,..thanks,..</li>
