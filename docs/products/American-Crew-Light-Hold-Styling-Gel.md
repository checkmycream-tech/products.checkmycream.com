    <li> Its great hair gel that smells good, if you like Crew products you will like this one. It does a good job at providing a firm hold.</li>
    <li> A little thinner than what I usually get in a bottle. I end up getting too much out of the tube. Still is good stuff.</li>
    <li> Buy this instead of the Crew Texture Lotion!  Easy to use but would agree with other reviews that a different container would be an improvement.</li>
    <li> Great item - works really well and you don&#x27;t need a lot to keep a good hold!</li>
    <li> Watery! Makes a mess!</li>

    <li> I want to love this but it is way too watered down so it just shoots out of the tube and so alot gets wasted</li>
    <li> I dislike the tube.  Difficult to control amount dispensed.  Also seems too liquid.</li>
    <li> Too light, not enough hold. Kind of watery and doesn&#x27;t hold well. The American Crew Firm Hold is the way to go.</li>
    <li> works perfect. This is a large tube and will last me a year.I wish the hole that shoots out product was smaller. It alaways squeezes out more than i need.</li>
    <li> Not firm enough, I always use light hold but is typically is more firm than this. .too liquid</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what has changed - but it just isn&#x27;t the same old &amp;#34;crew&amp;#34;. I won&#x27;t be buying anymore.</li>
    <li> Good price and delivery</li>
    <li> The bottle that was sent to me was at least two years old.  Crew has updated all of their packaging with orange lettering and this bottle had the old purple lettering.  Should be noted when you order that is outdated.</li>
    <li> As advertised. Light hold.</li>
    <li> Gel is gel and I&#x27;m sure this is fine. I was disappointed when I received a different container than what is shown. I was going for something smaller to fit in my luggage. Honestly I had no idea how big 8.4 oz was. Here is what I got: [[ASIN:B001229LC8 American Light Texture Lotion 8 45oz]]</li>
    <li> Great product and price.</li>
    <li> Best product in its category ever - finally!</li>
    <li> Did not like the scent of the gel.</li>
    <li> I used to love this gel a few years ago.  It had good hold and didn&#x27;t flake.  I think they changed the formula, though, as now it flakes quickly and leaves my hair looking like I went through a snowstorm.</li>
    <li> This product is watery compared the the American Crew gel sold at my local Fantastic Sam&#x27;s hair salon.  You don&#x27;t even need to squeeze the bottle. The product just drips out.</li>
    <li> Makes hair look good.</li>
    <li> This gel feels greasy after 8 hours in your hair. I think there are better products out there, it seemed like a good idea at the time</li>
    <li> Good product - does not flake like some other gels. It has a light to mediun  hold depending on how much you apply.</li>
    <li> While the gel itself is good the tube is prone to leaks.</li>
