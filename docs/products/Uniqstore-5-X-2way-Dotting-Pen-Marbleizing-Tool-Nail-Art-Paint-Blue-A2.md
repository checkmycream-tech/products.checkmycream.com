    <li> Dotting tools are a must have for anyone who is interested in nail art. I have had these for around 8 months and I LOVE them! The price is great and it makes nail art so much easier.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t beat this price! Just buy them, they&#x27;re perfect and versatile (the smallest ones are great for straight lines even). Definitely would buy again and recommend these to others.</li>
    <li> It is a good product. Like the sticks are nice and sturdy but the bag it comes in is cheap as hell. But I guess that shouldn&#x27;t really matter.</li>
    <li> Made putting my rhinestones on so much easier. Not having to struggle to pick them up. Good price for this item..</li>
    <li> These are great tools.  A bit heavier than I thought.  I found them hard to do my non dominant hand as I was too shaky.</li>
    <li> I have already used these tools, and I love them. In this set of five, you get 3 different size tips eventhough you get five dual sided pens. This may coem in handy if you are doing different colors at once. I kept three and gave 2 to my sister so we each had a set with all 3 different size tips.  Also you can do different size dots depending on the amount of nail polish you place on the tip. Overall, I am satisfied with the way the product functions and looks.</li>
    <li> Awesome product ! Works amazingly just one tiny problem one of the metal part fell off . Just had to glue it back on other then that awesome item.</li>
    <li> The dotting tools work really good. Now I&#x27;m happy and I can do my nails.</li>
    <li> Shipping took a while, but the tools were fantastic!</li>
    <li> These dotting tools are perfect for beautiful manicures! They have dotters on both sides, and so they are very easy to use. They arrived in time, and the packet wasn&#x27;t bent or anything. Highly suggested!</li>
    <li> Really cute and love to play with them making new design in my nails</li>
    <li> Good quality dotting pens. You really get what you pay for with this product. Nice thick handle and metal tips.</li>
    <li> On one side of these dotting pen they have a different size while one the opposite side they are all the same size, and for the price it is a good buy. I use mine for my polymer clay, which it&#x27;s working out great for me.</li>
    <li> I have been doing lots of nail art and needed the right tools for the job. These work great and they are cute too. Great price. Really like my dotting tools :)</li>

    <li> First time ordering, received as on date promised, very good and fun to use, quality is good.  I love it!</li>
    <li> these r great I use them evrydy, I use them wen I&#x27;m cleaning polish from around my nails &amp; wen I&#x27;m placing FIMO CANES on my nails!!!!</li>
    <li> The dotting tool worked pretty good, but some of the sizes are the same. Also, after a couple uses one of the silver pieces fell off. I was able to fix it with crazy glue, but I didn&#x27;t think it would have fallen off so soon.</li>
    <li> I am always doing my nails with different designs, with the different sizes it really helps make my designs stand out.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price. The seller sent product in mint condition. And we love the tools/pens my daughters do different nails with designs weekly. Thanks a Bunch!!</li>
    <li> Took awhile to arrive ( about 25 days.) But its exactly what my daughter wanted.</li>
    <li> You really can&#x27;t beat the price and dotting tools are a MUST for getting those perfect circles when doing your own nail art. I love the fact that the tools are able to create so many different sizes of dots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order to really get a perfectly round dot, just make sure that you are dipping the tool into enough polish.  In addition to being awesome for creating dotticures, you can also use the tips to pick up small rhinestones and gems by simply dipping the end of the tool into a bit of clear coat first. The gem will stick to the tool and then you will be able to place it anywhere you like perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are new to nail art, this will make a HUGE difference in how professional your designs look when they are all finished, go ahead and splurge on these $2.00 tools. I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>

    <li> One side has different sizes the other side has all the same size but its ok for what I paid for it</li>
