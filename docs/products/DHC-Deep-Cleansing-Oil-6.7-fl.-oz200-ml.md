<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is the only makeup remover I use. over 5 years I try so many different one but i stay with this!</li>
    <li> I use this every night and have for several years.  It makes the skin feel sliky.</li>
    <li> WONDERFUL ONLY TAKES A SMALL AMOUNT AND LAST FOREVER.  SO EASY TO PACK TO TAKE ON VACATION</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several years to remove makeup and gently cleanse my face. It&#x27;s completely effective and although its not cheap it lasts me several months.</li>
    <li> Since a trip to Italy in 2006, I came home with a need to find something to wash my face with that had olive oil. It led me to the DHC skincare line, and the best, best cleansing oil for all skin types. Unlike any bar soap...even in this line, this cleanser will not dry and it will not be greasy. There are many products at DHC I use all the time. They have a scalp cleansing shampoo that is very gentle, something called skin velvet that you but on before your foundation that is like nothing else, a toner that balances without drying. They have monthly sales where you can try something, and give you  4 free samples with every order. It is easy to get free shipping, and there is a reward program.  DHCskincare.com  you are lucky to have this available on Amazon, it was not when I was on my search.</li>
    <li> Like all the four and five star rating reviews this cleanser works great, even on my 42 year old, oily Japanese skin. What really surprised me was that it&#x27;s a GREAT make-up brush cleaner. I use Bare Minerals original powder foundation and clean the powder brush with the cleansing oil. I use a couple of pumps on a DRY brush, each side or until the bristles are coated and gently massage the oil in. Then I rinse the brush under running water until the water runs clear. I place the brush in a towel and gently press the excess water, re-positioning the brush on a drier part of the towel. I leave the brush out over night to air dry. The next morning it feels like a new brush AND very soft.</li>
    <li> I have been using DHC products since 2006 and this is the product that got me started.  I received a sample in a catalogue that I got in the mail and couldn&#x27;t understand why any one would put olive oil on their face.  I have combination skin and am prone to breakouts in my T-zone. I decided to give it a try.  I thought I would need soap and water to remove all that oil but to my amazement, it all came off when I splashed some water on my face.  Even more amazing to me was how smooth and fresh my skin felt afterward.  The next day, I placed an order with DHC for a set of skin care products and haven&#x27;t used anything since.  My skin has never been smoother or brighter and the Q10 cream even has eliminated the crepiness in my undereye area.  People can&#x27;t believe that I am 50 years old and that I have 5 grandchildren.  DHC has something for every age, gender and skin type.  If this product isn&#x27;t your cup of tea, I highly recommend checking out their website to see if there is anything that might be better for you.</li>
    <li> Best product for removing all make up</li>
    <li> I tired this product from a sample in the mail. When one uses this one must apply to dry skin. Do not wet your face first. Massage the oil into your skin and then rinse and your skin feels so clean and fresh. It does not hurt your eyes if you get the oil into them. I was so impressed that I turned my mother on to it and friends. My mom bought a years supply she liked it so much. DHC has a lot of other great products too but this is one of my favorites.</li>
    <li> I have normal/dry skin, and love this oil. It removes all traces of makeup without drying or leaving a greasy feeling. I use it before I get in the shower and it gets every bit of mascara off without stinging or leaving you bleary-eyed.</li>
    <li> You have got to try this! I know you are think that it will leave your face greasy, but it does not! It takes off makeup better than any makeup remember that I have ever used, and I am 59. I quit using soap on my face about 20 years ago, and stay out of the sun as much as possible. I was a sunbather for many years. It has taken a toll on some of my skin, but nightly treatments of good lotion, serums and what is on the market I have tried. I would say that DHC has some of the best products around. But, this.....I will never go without! It even takes off waterproof mascara well. No more vaseline on my eyes now. I can see when I go to bed now. Be sure and get it rinsed off well. Get the little sponge that is covered in terry cloth to go with it. Much easier to use than wash cloth. Try it Please! You will never be without it again. As you can see this is one of my longest reviews....that is because this is a great product! Oh! I have been told several times that I look like I am 35 to 40 years old, so I must be doing something right. Don&#x27;t use soap on you skin!</li>
    <li> The delivery was perfect - but this product just did not work for me.  My skin is incredibly oily and this just aggravated it even more.  But I had to try it because it did come highly recommended.  Oh well.... back to the drawing board.</li>
    <li> i like the idea of cleansing my face with oil instead of makeup wipes since it drags across my skin but when i started using this i was fine. then i started to break out not sure if its the cause of it. im not wearing makeup as much so i dont have to use this but i still breakout.</li>
    <li> Comparing with the cleansing oil from Shu Uemura, it has competitive price and I don&#x27;t have any problem/ alergy on this product since 2002.  It is very soft tough and of course washable.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say this takes off waterproof make up but it does take off regular makeup.  I like how it does not dry out my skin, an alternative to harsh facial cleaners.</li>
    <li> removing makeup is OH SO MUCH easier with DHC. It doesn&#x27;t strip my skin/natural oil at all. Very easy to wash with water and leaves nothing on your face.</li>
    <li> Bst cleansing oil out there - so thick, luxurious, and washes off perfectly cleanly. I only wish it werent so, pricey. However, a bottle lasted me 7 months and that is using at least 1 pump every day.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Have used it for years and plan to continue to use it in the future.  It removes mascara better than any other product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I got a free sample of this product at my health club. I was a little skeptical, being an olive oil product, thinking that I would need to totally rewash my face with my cleanser to get the oily feeling off - was I wrong! I was amazed at how easily my waterproof makeup came off, and at how soft, silky and clean my skin felt after I rinsed it off. I still do have a full skin care routine, but each step now involves all DHC products and it begins with the Deep Cleansing Oil.</li>
    <li> A friend at work suggested I try this product because I needed a good makeup remover. She brought me a sample and I have been in love and recommending it ever since! DHC has tons of great products but this one is the best! You start with clean DRY hands and a dirty DRY face. You only need a squirt of this stuff. You rub it in all over your face, neck and eyes. The dirt and makeup comes right off!! Once you rub it in good you will rinse with warm water and follow up with a regular facial cleanser and your normal routine of washing your face. It leaves your skin feeling so soft and moisturized. Fantastic stuff! You can go on their website dhc care . com and order a catalog and they send you 4 samples of products just for ordering the catalog!!</li>
    <li> I have been searching for years for a product that would clean my oily, acne prone skin and unclog my pores.  I was searching the internet and found a posting from someone describing this product in conjunction with the St. Ives&#x27; apricot scrub and sure enough they are truly a dream come true.  I use this product at night and in the morning I use the apricot scrub.  I&#x27;ve been using this combination for about 8 months and my skin has never looked better.  Trust me when I say that I have really oily, acne prone, and incredibly sensitive skin. I have to be very careful with the products that I use.  This combination has really kept my pores clean and they look smaller to boot.  I was constantly using those pore strips and now I don&#x27;t need to anymore.  I believe the secret to the success of this product is that oil does a much  better job cleaning oily skin than water and other cleansers do.  I was skeptical at first and was afraid to put this on my skin (it looks just like olive oil), but I can verify that it definitely works.  I am a steady customer of this product and I&#x27;m really glad that I can order it from Amazon instead of just from the DHC site.</li>
    <li> I had heard all the great things about oil cleansers but this product broke me out. Buyer beware.</li>
    <li> The reason why I love this product is b/c it easily dissolves make-up, I don&#x27;t need to spend much time trying to completely clean my face with cotton balls.</li>
    <li> This is a good product, but I think I could make my own cleansing oil for much less. I also find that pure jojoba oil is better at clearing pores than this.</li>
    <li> I use this on my face. It cleans my face and feels good afterwards, not oily or dry, just good. It is fast.</li>
    <li> I used a trial size of this product someone gave me and it blew me away!  I was fresh out of the shower, had washed my face (or so I thought!), and then tried this product.  I just couldn&#x27;t believe the black dirt that came up on the cotton ball!  Unbelieveable.  And my skin felt so soft and supple afterward, not at all greasy.  I&#x27;m a believer and recommend this product to the hilt.</li>
    <li> I recently started using Tazorac and my skin is getting very dry. Also, I am looking for a facial cleanser to completely remove my mascara. I saw this on a review and decided to try this oil cleanser. Though, it made my skin feel nicely moisturized, it did not completely remove the mascara. I think it my be a bit too oily, even for my dry skin. The jury is still out...</li>
    <li> I purchased this oil after reading all the great reviews. I am older now and thought it would be wise to use something such as a cleansing oil to take off all my makeup. Well, it doesn&#x27;t. I use Maybelline regular mascara and not once has it taken off my mascara. And even though, I don&#x27;t have really dry skin, it made my skin feel dry. I would rather use Almay eye makeup remover and then another type of cleanser. Way too much money for what it does.</li>
    <li> I just got a sample of this stuff in the mail the other day. I used it last night to take off my makeup. It is the BEST product I&#x27;ve ever found to remove even the toughest eye makeup! It got all of it off, and I have NEVER found a product that gets all of my eye makeup off. Very glad to have found it!</li>
    <li> This is a great cleanser.  I have mature, somewhat dry skin, and I use this cleansing oil every night.  It gently removes all makeup, including eye makeup, and leaves your skin feeling soft and clean.  It lasts a long time, because you only use a little.  My daughter uses it also, and loves it as well.</li>
    <li> I have been using dhc products for over a year now and love them.  In my 20&#x27;s I was able to use just about anything on my face.  Now, after having had 2 kids and in my 30&#x27;s, my skin is definitely more sensitive.  It&#x27;s not the least bit dry but it is sensitive normal to oily skin.  That being said.  I love this cleansing oil. I was skeptical to try it, being that it is an oil but it truly is amazing.  Cleans the face and leaves it soft and clean and not the least bit greasy.  For the review that complained about having oily patchy skin.  You can&#x27;t expect this to cure your skin problems.  You have to have a skin care routine.  You can start with this product to remove make up and such.  Dhc recommends an actual cleanser for step 2 after using this for step 1 and then toner and of course moisturizer.  Obviously if you have problematic skin you&#x27;ll want to use something after this step that targets those problem areas.  But I love this cleanser.  It has worked amazing for me.  Love the simple ingredients too.</li>
    <li> I adore this cleaner to lift my makeup.  I follow up with a foaming cleanser to sweep away what this oil has lifted.  Acne: subdued. Make-up: Removed.  Wunderbar!</li>
    <li> This is my first oil based cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;I used one pump onto my palm and noticed a very thin liquid and as per instructions, I gently rubbed it onto my dry face at the end of the day after normal wear makeup application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I enjoyed the relaxing feeling of massaging the oil onto my skin and was very surprised that the product removed my makeup with ease.&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive, older skin (40&#x27;s) and found it relatively kind to my skin type.&lt;br /&gt;The product suggests to not use it as an eye makeup remover, but I was curious to see how well it would perform.&lt;br /&gt;DHC removed my eye makeup with ease, but I was left with a tight feeling around the eye area - pretty good for a product not meant for the eyes!&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely purchase again, especially due to the low price tag, it out performed many expensive leading brands</li>
    <li> So basically, I don&#x27;t really use make-up except for the occasional bb cream. However, my interest was piqued by the claims that it removed all dirt and impurities. And boy does it do it well. My face feels so clean and purified every time I use this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only bad thing about this is that there&#x27;s too little! I wish they gave you a larger bottle...</li>
    <li> I purchased this stuff because of the many glowing reviews it received, and I wanted to see for myself how well I would like it.  I did not like it, and it did not appear to do much for me.  My skin did not feel as if it were cleaned.  I feel better using cetaphil or even anthony logistics over this.  will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> DHC is the best!  It not only cleans your face but keeps it moist which helps keep the wrinkles away and softens my skin at the same time.</li>
    <li> I have been a DHC customer since 2006 and I haven&#x27;t looked back since then. The Deep Cleansing Oil is the franchise product of the mail order skin care line, and for good reason......IT WORKS!! If you are someone who wears makeup/foundation on a daily basis, then this is definitely for you because it removes every trace of makeup, grime and everything in between out of your pores. It leaves your skin soft sans oiliness and with daily use, your skin becomes cleaner and clearer. Now it may seem counter productive to apply oil to your skin to clear out your pores, but I tell you this product rinses completely clean,  and there is absolutely no residue left on your skin. I have tried darn near every product from DHC and perhaps only one time have I been disappointed but as far as skin care goes I will never use another skin care line again and the four free samples you recieve with every order you make are a good way to try out different products because not everything will work for your skin. I suggest the Deep Cleansing Oil Travel Set to get you started and I don&#x27;t believe you will be disappointed!!</li>
    <li> I have used Shiseido cleansing oil but DHC deep cleansing oil feels smoother on my face and I can wash it off with foam cleanser with warm water without using a tissue.  It can easily remove makeup, including water proof mascara, although I use eye make up remover before using the cleanser. Good product, I don&#x27;t think I would go back to Shiseido cleansing oil. Thanks to my cousin for recommending the product.</li>
    <li> No instructions (at least in English).  It seems to work OK, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s for me.  I&#x27;m too &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; in my cleansing habits, and my face didn&#x27;t really feel clean.</li>
    <li> i bought this as a cheaper alternative to my usual cleansing oil. it gets the job done, but for some reason i have broken out more with this than my usual oil. probably won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> This takes off thee most STUBBORN makeup EVER! I use one pump and massage my face for a while making sure I get everything off...it feels absolutely oily but I assure you it is not when you wash it off...FYI this product ships from korea if you didn&#x27;t know. I did not know and there is a DHC everywhere in asia basically but next time I think I will order from the actual site as they give you points and credit towards future purchases or maybe even discounts..item ships to you in roughly 2 weeks so it&#x27;s pretty fast coming from korea...I got mine in as little as over a week but less than 2 weeks. I don&#x27;t use much makeup so I use this only when I apply makeup and it really does work HOWEVER...when I wakeup I get 1 or 2 pimples (the kind that is very easy to pop and has a white head on it) not a big deal but I don&#x27;t like pimples and only receive them hormonally..now I&#x27;m not sure if this is because of the product or the foundation I am using since I am new to the foundations and the DHC cleanser...I got ALOT of sample foundations from basically all the makeup counters to see which one worked well with my face so I&#x27;m not sure what the pimples are from...I know for a fact I get pimples using shiseido so I will update in the future to let you know where I&#x27;m getting these pimples from. I don&#x27;t know if I will repurchase again or find another oil cleanser but I will update in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;8/21/16&lt;br /&gt;I was still using this all these years until this year when I switched to BareMinerals Oil obsessed cleansing oil. Same concept, diff ingredients. They are both good honestly but I do enjoy the lavender scent using the Bareminerals. DHC is still a good cleanser and I might go back but for now I am sticking with the one I have.</li>
    <li> Amazing cleanser-had always wanted to try it and so glad I did! My skin has been transformed and I  am thrilled--will most definitely be ordering again and again!</li>
    <li> I have found if you rub this oil into your skin and massage it for 2-3 minutes, you can unclog your pores. I can feel sand like oil deposits rubbing right out of the skin and also any dry skin is removed. When you rinse it, comes right off and your skin feels skilky smoooth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil for years.  It melts off makeup, even stubborn waterproof eye makeup.  I massage it in then steam it off with hot washcloths and it keeps my pores beautifully clear.  As an oil it&#x27;s not drying at all.  I also have very sensitive skin with rosecea and this helps calm it.</li>
    <li> I use this as a makeup remover, and its the best one I have ever used. I truly feel like ALL of the makeup, dirt and grime is removed with DHC Cleansing Oil.  This is a cleanser, so there&#x27;s no need to wash afterwards, but I still use a light cleanser because I have problems with break outs on my chin area.  This oil has a nice scent and nice consistency which is not as &#x27;oil like&#x27; as real oil. This product has been the same for years and it&#x27;s definitely one of DHC&#x27;s most popular and best selling items.</li>
    <li> This cleanser is great. I thought the oil would be difficult to work with but it is so smooth and gentle and washes right off. Even 1/2 squirt is enough! Love it!</li>
    <li> Every makeup-wearer ever should have this. I have really breakout-prone skin and for the vast majority of my life have not been able to wear makeup since it would always either cause outbreaks because the gentle cleansers I have to use on my skin couldn&#x27;t lift it or I&#x27;d have to use really strong soaps that would dry out my skin (and then cause it to grease itself extra...leading to not only irritated skin, but breakouts!). Since starting a new, more professional job, I really felt like I had to do something for my makeup since my company has a very particular image they like presented. After reading about this on a Japanese beauty site, I decided I had to try it and was happy to see that it made its way to Amazon. It&#x27;s WONDERFUL. It gets all the makeup off while actually moisturizing my skin. I don&#x27;t need to follow it up with a harsh face wash or toner to fully clean my skin. I&#x27;m so grateful to this product since it has opened to me a whole portion of culture that I could never partake in before. :-)</li>
    <li> This wonderful product has made the ugly pores on my nose shrink to almost nothing. I&#x27;m so surprised that an oil could do this - I was always trying drying cleansers.  This is a delight to use and so pleasant and gentle. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I like this oil cleanser for most of my face but found I cannot use it on my chin area or I break out.</li>
    <li> Would have never imagined an oil to clean my face but cannot imagine ever using soap again.  This is just fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used a facial toner afterwards just to see if it does in fact remove all of the make up and it really does.  Highly recommend it for &amp;#34;aging skin&amp;#34; particularly.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good to remove make up.&lt;br /&gt;and it is economic price. so I recommend this DHC deep cleansing oil. :)</li>
    <li> my daughter is extremely pleased with this purchase. her slight acne is non existant now. yeah!! yay! great! buy it.</li>
    <li> 1st step of all great skin care at night should start with cleansing oil that takes off the sunscreen, makeup, heavy duty eye makeup etc. Followup with foam cleanser and the rest of the routine. It makes the skin very supple for the foam to take the dirt off.</li>
    <li> I tried this product to substitute shuemura oil cleanser, but it is sticky and heavy. I just don&#x27;t like the texture. It works well to remove makeup.</li>
    <li> It was never so easy remove mascara and make-up like with this product. Skin stays so smooth and clean. Love it!</li>
    <li> I bought this on Aug 24, didn&#x27;t use it until September so I can say it&#x27;s been almost 3 months. My skin is combo oily with my nose and chin area being pretty oily, sometimes even my cheeks and forehead are too ;-; Anyways, I think this is the reason why I&#x27;ve been left with clogged pores, these tiny fleshy colored bumps trailing along my jaw line/lower to upper cheeks. Along with these bumps, stubborn pimples have found a home around my chin area (which could be hormones). I&#x27;ve used like 1/5 of the bottle over this time. This product at this time (fall) is not the right one for me at the moment. It does do a great job of clearing eye makeup.</li>
    <li> This is the best facewash ive ever used. Dont think of it as ew its oil though. Its not like that kind of oil. You will not feel oily and this dissolves dirt and makeup so well. You girls know when you use a facewash and you get out of shower and you STILL have the traces of mascara under your lower lashes?? not with this! This is a very good high quality product. DHC products are absolutely amazing!! Worth the price. Try it. You will be loyal for life. Not just for people wearing makeup. My skeptical boyfriend uses it now too after me telling him its not like cooking oil silly!! Actually I wish he didnt like it lol i dont wanna share</li>
    <li> I love the deep cleansing this gives me and how it leaves my skin feeling after cleansing. I would definitely reccommend this to anyone - skin type doesn&#x27;t seem to matter, it JUST WORKS!</li>
    <li> It is great to remove all my makeup, yes, it is really greasy, but after remove all make up, wash your face, that will give you the perfect touch.  I love it, it removes everything.</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic.  Using it as a daily cleaner it leaves your skin so soft and supple. A little pricey but worth it.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to DHC about 10 yrs ago when I moved in with my then boyfriend/now husband. His X used this stuff and her mail was still coming to our house, so I decided to give one of the free samples that came, a try. Of course after I promptly told our mail lady that his X no longer lived here! Anyways, I used this amazing deep cleansing oil. I was really skeptical at first. I mean, oil on your skin and it&#x27;s supposed to cleanse as well? Hmmmm. Well, it worked! and it worked amazingly well! I love this stuff. It&#x27;s like the fountain of youth in a bottle. Okay, it&#x27;s not THAT good, but pretty darn close. I branched out and tried some of their other products and found that my tried and true favorites are the Deep Cleansing oil, the virgin olive oil moisturizer, the under eye cream and the daily night time moisturizer. I won&#x27;t go anywhere without these gems and I use them religiously every night and every day. I have had compliments on my skin ever since using DHC. It&#x27;s a wee bit pricey but I have used products that were double in price and didn&#x27;t work at all. So, my motto is, if it works, use it!</li>
    <li> It just feel so clean but not dry after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I used it as normal cleanser, wet face and hand and apply it then rinse.&lt;br /&gt;felt not much differences than other cleanser&lt;br /&gt;Then my friend told me use it directly with dry hand and face,then rinse it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can see/feel the dirty stuffs are gone!&lt;br /&gt;Use it the right way and use it every day even you just have sunscreen.</li>
    <li> I just love it and I have been using this product for about 3 months now, and I can truly say it has made a great difference in my complexion! I just love it and now on the look out for more products made by DHC. This cleaners is all natural, made from pure virgin olive oil it leaves my skin so soft and smooth, now my skins feel healthy and it has a glow with it. My husband and some friends have told me that my skin looks great. Also I have noticed that some fine lines in my face have smoothened out. I use it twice a day, in the morning and in the evening. Would highly recommend this product, even though it is oil it will not leave a greasy feeling after you wash it off. Anyone that wants healthy, younger looking skin without harsh chemicals this is so far the best by far!!! I will stick with this one. No allergic reaction either and I still have about 1/2 of the bottle left so a little goes along way. You will not be disappointed and the price on Amazon is great!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  It&#x27;s a super make up cleanser.  I have oily skin. It keep my skin moist and not oily.</li>
    <li> I used this a few years ago and let my supply run out and never got around to buying more. The current make up I have been wearing is very hard to remove so I bought another bottle of the cleansing oil. It removes the makeup without pulling and tugging at my eyes. Well worth the price charged!</li>
    <li> This melts away my sunscreen, foundation, mascara, eyeshadow and eyeliner like a creamy eraser!  I was given this as a birthday present back in 2006 and I&#x27;ve been attached since.  Really nice olive oil scent which feels so natural but luxurious.  Also, does not dry out my skin.</li>
    <li> Seemed to be deep cleaning but I think I&#x27;m breaking out worse since i started using it. I can&#x27;t get used to putting oil on my face either.</li>
    <li> Wanted to like this product so much! But after 2 weeks of switching over to this cleansing oil, my face became dry and bumpy, with patches of red over my cheeks. Don&#x27;t know what the problem is, but switching to something else.</li>
    <li> I have been purchasing cleansers for over 50 years, and this DHC oil is the  best I&#x27;ve ever found.  I have dry skin and need products that leave my skin feeling moist and smooth.  This oil works well, taking off all makeup easily. The pump is added bonus. Small size is great for travel, and large size is a bargain, as you use very little product to get a really clean face.  I use it nightly, sometimes just removing it with tissue before adding  overnight facial products.  Oh, and my aesthetician tells me I have wonderful skin ( for my age, anyway), which I attribute to daily cleansing with DHC, moisturizing, and sunscreens get with Elta MD SPF 40 sunscreen.</li>
    <li> the best make up remover I ever used before! It is good! I like it very much! It is so good!</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical of using OIL to cleanse my face, but this is a wonderful product.  Just a small bit dissolves make-up right off.  Leaves my skin feeling so soft and clean.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Shiseido cleansing oil and wanted to upgrade, and went for DHC. I would say DHC is more easy to glide on your face and more lubed feeling. It does its job of removing face foundation, power, eyeshadow.  You may need eye make up remover for some type of mascara, liner. I still need to use eye make up remover to clean out the residues, but all other face make ups are okay using DHC alone. I was hopping DHC cleansing oil would be more hydrating than Shiseido because it is olive oil base, but it was not! My face feels little dry after washing with a warm water. I wonder if using an extra pump would make it more hydrating. I use 2 pumps for my face and this bottle looks like would last about 3 months max.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product for removing makeup and cleaning your face without drying it out. It seems a little pricey for the amount you get, but it is easier to remove than regular olive oil.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use it on daily basis. Only once a while,  I use this to wash off my makeup. It works great. Never caused any breakout. I will purchase more in the future.</li>
    <li> I love this, it so completely removes even the toughest eye makeup like waterproof mascara, but is so gentle, never drying, and rinses completely clean.  Wonderful for &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; women who want to avoid drying cleansers.</li>
    <li> I love this facial cleansing oil!! I noticed immediate results and its so easy to use. Massage onto dry skin and wipe off with a warm wet washcloth, skin is clean and moisturizer. Tone and texture are amazing!</li>
    <li> I really like using this dhc deep cleansing oil on my face, it just feels so good. My skin looks good too, I will continue using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thank you DHC</li>
    <li> The makers of DHC Deep Cleansing Oil recommend using your fingertips for washing instead of a washcloth, which I like.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use a washcloth on my face, preferring to use my fingertips only, and a mild scrub once a week.  Most cream based cleansers are either too mild to remove makeup using your fingertips only, or the cleanser is heavy and leaves a residue unless you scrub with a washcloth.&lt;br /&gt;DHC Deep Cleansing Oil does an excellent job of removing any grime and/or makeup while being gentle on my skin, and it leaves no residue.  For that I would have given it 5 stars, however just getting the oil from your fingertips to your face is almost impossible without some of it leaking between your fingers, and this is not an item you can easily pack for travel.  However I doubt that any other type of dispenser would be better.  Oil is oil and not easily contained, but I love the product and will continue to use it.  And the price is right.&lt;br /&gt;The product comes with a plastic collar that keeps the plunger in place while in shipment, I&#x27;m assuming, but I&#x27;ve kept it for travel and will try placing the product in a zip-lock bag.</li>
    <li> The cleanser leaves a bit of an oily residue and does not seem to remove all of the sunscreen i need to wear in the CA sun.  I will finish this container, but plan to try something else next.</li>
    <li> This oil does a very good job of cleaning the face. My only wish is that it was recommended safe to use in the eye area to remove eye makeup.</li>
    <li> There is literally nothing this oil cannot remove. It will easily break down everyday makeup, theater makeup, face paint, and waterproof mascaras. There&#x27;s no rubbing or long wait time involved. All you need to do is thoroughly massage about 1-2 pumps of this oil over your face with dry hands, then rinse off thoroughly with water. (This oil contains emulsifiers so yes, it will dissolve off your skin with water.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It removes EVERYTHING in one go and is super gentle on your skin. I highly recommend this for anyone who wears makeup daily or has sensitive skin because it won&#x27;t strip yoru skin of oils and it also won&#x27;t cause any flushing or irritation as some makeup removers can. One bottle lasts me about half a year of daily use, so the price may seem a bit high but it&#x27;s a good investment in the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: The main component is olive oil. If you&#x27;re sensitive to that oil, avoid this product.</li>
    <li> All the magazines are talking about cleansing your skin with oil and coming out with all new products. This product is always been one of DHC&#x27;s best seller. I have been ordering DHC products for over 5 years, but I did not try this product until after I read several magazine articles in Vogue and Glamour on using oil to clean the skin. It works well at removing makeup and not oily after feel. I have reordered this product three times and I use it night and day.</li>
    <li> I had gotten this from a friend who swears by it, and I was dubious since cleansing with oil didn&#x27;t make much sense.  However, massage it into dry skin, and then rinse off, and it leaves your skin very soft and not at all dry.  I have trouble with a lot of soaps being too drying for my face, but this is great.  I was surprised to find that it also pretty much got rid of my post-partum flush of tiny zits all over my shoulders and upper chest.  I didn&#x27;t try many products to get rid of that acne, assuming that since soap didn&#x27;t get rid of it, nothing would.  Well, the oil cleanser does!  Cool stuff!</li>
    <li> Love this oil! Removes makeup so we&#x27;ll and doesn&#x27;t irritate eyes! Leaves skin clean and not oily . Gave 4 stars bc it&#x27;s a little pricey but will def buy again</li>
    <li> Great Product! Great Price! Fast Shipping!  This is the only product that takes off my foundation and waterproof mascara. I will use this forever!  :)</li>
    <li> Horrible...the product has a rancid smell...due to the olive oil being old. Very disappointed in amazon. They need to inspect the quality of their product.</li>
    <li> I have always used this brand, and it is wonderful for removing eye make up. Product ordered as expected. Love it!</li>
    <li> My face feels clean, smooth and soft.  Have been using this product for over 10 years. I hope it&#x27;s always available.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great.  I have tried many, many other products but once I found this I couldn&#x27;t believe how well it works. Simply put one pump on your fingers, rub on your face (including eyes) and the makeup dissolves, including hard to remove mascara.</li>
    <li> Product made my skin feel very smooth, which is important since I have &amp;#34;senior&amp;#34; skin, and live in an arid part of the country.</li>
    <li> For the nights when I am too tired to shower or even get ready for bed, I brush my teeth and wash my makeup off with this cleanser. It feels just like rubbing olive oil on your skin so if that bothers you, be aware. It cleans, moisturizes and removes makeup all in one step. I massage it into my dry skin then rinse off.</li>
    <li> this stuff has kept my horrible acne at bay for weeks now. I usually try a cleanser and it works for a few days and then the acne returns with avengence. This stuff smells great, feels great and keeps acne away! its strange at first to not use a sudsy soap on the face, but once you get past that, its awesome. I will order again and have ordered other things from this line.</li>
    <li> Best make up cleaner ever!</li>
    <li> Probably the best facial cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used and I have both oily skin and rosacea.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace the mac cleanse off oil when I ran out.  They are very similar and both remove water-resistant eye make-up and sunscreen well, but this is cheaper.  It does smell lightly of olive oil.  I will repurchase unless a cheaper and effective drugstore option becomes available.</li>
    <li> i love this cleansing oil. I have finished 3 bottles. It works very well to remove all the makeup and even waterproof makeup. After i use the cleaning oil, i use my cleaner to wash my face again. i feel very clean and fresh. Love it!!</li>
    <li> If you have acne prone skin and wear makeup this is the makeup remover for you!  Removes all makeup easily and gently without using much effort.  You can open your eyes with this stuff on your eyelids and it doesn&#x27;t sting at all.  My acne lessened quite remarkably when I started to use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can only buy this in Asian stores in their beauty aisle or here on Amazon.  If you don&#x27;t live near any Asian stores or don&#x27;t feel like buying such a small item from Amazon then I also suggest Philosophy&#x27;s Oil Cleanser.  It works the same way but I wouldn&#x27;t open my eyes with it on my face.  It stings a lot.</li>
    <li> As a guy I decided to try as sunscreen and sweat can be difficult to remove completely and this does it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really am amaze on how this washes whatever you had on throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;After long days you can definitely feel that clean.</li>
    <li> AMAZING cleanser. I&#x27;ve tried so many cleansers, but this one is just beyond amazing. Not only takes everything off, including all eye makeup/mascara -- but also improves skin, somehow. Someone else also mentions how it &amp;#34;pushed out&amp;#34; her blackheads and shockingly, the same thing seems to be happening to me. I&#x27;ve had blackheads on my nose my whole life and they&#x27;re just impossible to manage. But since starting to use the DHC oil, the pores seem to be pushing out the debris....and clearing up. They definitely are looking somewhat smaller, which is wonderful! Just a lovely cleanser to use! LOVE it!</li>
    <li> I use this cleansing oil as a precleanse.  The first step in my cleansing process.  It emulsifies with water and dissolves and makeup, oil, dirt, etc. that is on the skins surface.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It cleans and it goes on like it&#x27;s going to be greasy and hard to wash off, but it washes off clean and leaves my face very soft and NOT greasy!  It&#x27;s good for getting off makeup too.</li>
    <li> One pump on my palms, I gently Massage the oil to my face then I splash a little water on my face and continue massaging it and it will foam up a little bit ... then rinse thoroughly.&lt;br /&gt;It easily and gently removes the make-up and it doesn&#x27;t dry up my face after I cleanse, unlike other cleansers I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;I have dry skin so this is the perfect cleanser for me, it doesn&#x27;t leave out an oily finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is well recommended.</li>
    <li> My all time favorite! Don&#x27;t harm my eyes, cleans very well! I use it everyday, all you have to do is rubbing it gently on your face in circles.</li>
    <li> I gave this cleansing oil three stars because I feel like it&#x27;s a really great makeup remover. It gets rid of foundation, primer, sunscreen, and most importantly mascara very well. Sometimes I think other makeup removers don&#x27;t get rid of mascara as effectively as I would like them to. They always leave behind a mess that I have to remove a second time. This one gets rid of the worst of it and the most I have to do after rinsing is follow up with a q tip and a little bioderma. It fulfills it&#x27;s purpose phenomenally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  That being said, I do think that it has it&#x27;s drawbacks. For one, I feel like it takes a while to completely emulsify and rinse away. I&#x27;ve tried shu uemura&#x27;s cleansing oil a/i and when I use that I just have to massage a few splashes of water into my skin to emulsify and it rinses away pretty quickly. This one I have to keep adding water for what feel like a few minutes and I often have to follow up with a cream cleanser to feel like my skin is clean. I also have dry skin and sometimes this oil can leave my skin kinda tight and dry. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d keep using it if I didn&#x27;t use a dry skin serum in my routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  So yeah. It&#x27;s a great makeup remover for the price it&#x27;s being offered at and if you have normal or oily skin you should consider giving it a try. If your skin is on the drier side like mine you might want to look at other options (boscia have a great cleansing oil and shu uemura of course) or you might want to use it and use some other products to make sure your skin doesn&#x27;t get dried out.</li>
    <li> DHC is the best cleansing oil i&#x27;ve used, hands down, and gives me no adverse effects at all.  i&#x27;ve used some other brands (which i won&#x27;t name) that actually sting my sensitive skin and/or cause breakouts.  i purchased a backup bottle of DHC oil, but i am only just now reaching the bottom of my initial bottle after 18 months.  one pump is more than enough for even full coverage foundation, waterproof mascara, and false eyelashes.  i have never had a problem with this stinging even my most sensitive areas, like around my nose, and it doesn&#x27;t even irritate my eyes.  it has no scent, either, aside from a mild olive oil scent which i imagine just comes from the product&#x27;s ingredients.  i should note that while i use it for makeup removal, i also use it as a general daily cleanser whether i&#x27;ve worn makeup or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;additionally, i know there are a couple schools of thought, but i use the shiseido method of oil cleansing, which is to say that i don&#x27;t steam DHC into my face.  i just massage it into my skin for 1-3 minutes (depending on the amount of makeup i wore on a given day), wet my hands a bit, and massage that water into the oil on my face.  the oil emulsifies with the water on my hands and turns milky; i repeat these steps until there is no emulsification, indicating that the oil is completely cleansed from my face.  then i follow with a cold water rinse and i&#x27;m done.</li>
    <li> Wonderful!  DHC products are the best!</li>
    <li> This DHC oil is very similar to using Shu Imura&#x27;s oil which is too expensive for a cleanser.  I have used Shu&#x27;s before and I can&#x27;t tell a difference in the results except that DHC might be a little thicker oil (not that it&#x27;s a bad thing).  Saves time by removing eye makeup and cleansing face with one product. Removes mascara with no problem along w/ face makeup and oily grime on the face. Love that it comes in a pump too. My 14-yr old daughter said that it got her blackheads out, and this was on the first day she used it. I did not check her nose to see if it was true. But she is an intellegent girl so I didn&#x27;t doubt her. I was amazed. I don&#x27;t have blackheads of my own.     Tips for using oil:    -- Use clean, dry hands and apply to a dry face.  Not sure if it will work on wet skin.  You can apply then jump into the shower, but it rinses off easily in the sink too.  Nowadays, I use it to remove my eye makeup and use another cleanser on my wet face, just to try a new cleanser with more skin benefits.    -- If you have other skin conditions, I&#x27;d recommend that you also use a specialized cleanser afterwards.  For me (oily/combo non-sensitive skin), it gets my face so clean that I don&#x27;t have to use a toner unless I have extra time on my hand (like never).    -- I pump some into my left palm, apply to forehead, nose, and right cheek with right hand fingertips (only lightly to closed eyes so that it doesn&#x27;t drip into eyes), then wipe the remaining oil in my palm on my left (untouched) cheek so as not to waste any product.  After I spread the oil evenly all over, I massage the oil into face with fingertips to remove face makeup. After that, I gently rub eye liner from both bottom lash lines, then rub each top lid while closing the eye, and rinse with water. Takes only one pump and 2-3 minutes to do all that.     -- Avoid getting too much oil near the inner corners of the eyes even when closed.  I think I remember it stinging a little if it gets in eyes.    -- My daughter at times has blemishes so her shower routine is to cleanse w/ the DHC oil, get in the shower, and then use LaRoche Posay BioMedic cleanser with a Clarisonic brush to really get her face clean.</li>
    <li> Ah....to wash your face with olive oil...heaven. Soothing and a wonderful scent.  Not oily.  Best DHC product, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since DHC first started selling in the US. Like others, I was very skeptical about putting oil on my oily skin, but after using a couple of samples and having it leave my skin squeaky clean after rinsing, I became a convert- almost a zealot. I can&#x27;t imagine ever being without it again.</li>
    <li> This works really well for my dry skin. I typically use Philosphy cleanser and still do, but this cleanser is just as mild and effective. You can even get in your eye and it won&#x27;t sting, but it will be blurry for a few seconds after you rinse. It gets everything off beautifully and has no smell. it rinses off completely clean and leaves the skin fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen or felt any difference in my skin. But it does remove all my eye makeup. Don&#x27;t think I will buy again..</li>
    <li> This product leaves your skin feeling so clean and soft! Not dried out like other cleansers. Would definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> This is perhaps my #1 go to product as it removes makeup better than anything out there. Apply to dry skin, massage for a few minutes (tissue off) and rinse. Unlike cold cream or coconut oil, it rinses clean easily.  (I recommend tissue removal prior to rinsing so you don&#x27;t end up clogging your sink.)</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about 12 years to remove my make up. I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else! After I use this I wash with the DHC mild soap to get all the make up and oil off. I typically order directly from DHC but this was actually less expensive to order on Amazon. I still order the mild soap directly though.</li>
    <li> An excellent cleanser for your face. Non -greasy.  Product rinses off very well and leaves skin feeling fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> You would think that your face would feel oily after using this but it doesn&#x27;t. Your face feels wonderful and clean and believe it or not, it rinses clean and leaves no oily residue. Amazing product!!!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I have rosecea and my skin is so sensitive. My skin loves it and I&#x27;ve tried so many brands like cetaphil, cerave, aveeno, Clinique, neutregena, Roc, just to name a few. This stuff beats them all!</li>
    <li> i tried a sample of this product last year for the first time and fell in love with it. No other product on the market cleans my makeup/face as well as this product does. who would think that since it is oil based it woudl work. I have oily skin and after washing with this product my face is clean and perfectly mosturised. I have it on auto purchas so i don&#x27;t mis sout. the 6oz bottle lasts about 2 months you don&#x27;t need much . you need to ensure your hands are dry when you put the oil in your hands and rub directly on your face. note it also take out water proof mascara and eyelliner and doesn&#x27;t damage your lashes.</li>
    <li> This is the first time to use oil cleaning. Seems much cleaner than requelar cleanser. I also used lotion after the cleaning. My skin felt great.</li>
    <li> This is the best cleaning oil I have ever used.  You just put one pump from the bottle in the palm of your hand, and with your fingers of the other hand smooth it over your face and eyes.  Does not burn your eyes.  It dissolves in water, so that when you take off your eye makeup and foundation, you just wipe your face with clear warm water on a washcloth and the makeup is gone.  And it does not stay on the washcloth because it all rinses out of the cloth.  It is truly wonderful and I would recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t do without it! Absolutely THE BEST!</li>
    <li> This may seem counterintuitive. Clean your face of dirt and oils with an oil? Yes! Absolutely. The product is an oil cleaner, based on olive oil. One pump does your entire face. Considering the size of the bottle, you&#x27;re going to love how long it lasts. Not only does it last long, it is non-irritating, and perfect for the cold weather when skin is dry and irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil dissolves all the dirt and grime that can build up on the skin. It also dissolves my wife&#x27;s hard-to-remove mascara and makeup. The best part is once the product is on the skin you can leave it on for a bit, and it transforms into a soothing, moisturizing mask. I don&#x27;t know if that is an official use or not. It just works so well that way. Then when you wish to remove it, a splash of cool to warm water instantly breaks down the oils and dirt. It washes away so easily, much easier than you might expect from an oil. Fantastic. I love that I can buy it at Amazon. The DHC company is great, but this is the only product I buy from them so I&#x27;d rather get it here.</li>
    <li> This potion is the best makeup remover that I have ever used! It will remove your makeup completely (including waterproof mascara!) and leave your skin beautifully soft! Try it! You&#x27;ll love it!</li>
    <li> Tried Shiseido and Eve Lom, this is better.</li>
    <li> Best ever cleanser for removing makeup, especially eye makeup.  A part of my nightly routine.  Can&#x27;t be without it.</li>
    <li> Great product! Very mild, and deep clean the pores, I&#x27;m oily type of skin and very sensitive. But it doesn&#x27;t bring me acne, it cleans all foundation and make ups out, but eyes should still use eye makeup remover. Anyway. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This product has made my skincare routine much more efficient. You must have dry skin though, for both your hands and your face! Don&#x27;t rinse it off unless your makeup has been completely dissolved or it may not do the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leaves no residue, gentle but it works very well. I have sensitive acne prone skin so I&#x27;m big on makeup removal and so far my skins really improved in the past few months since using this instead of my philosophy cleanser.</li>
    <li> My favorite cleanser. Doesn&#x27;t make your skin feel tight and easily removes every bit of eye makeup no matter how stubborn.</li>
    <li> I love this product - It easily removes my makeup and I do not need to use another cleanser afterwards. It is non drying - I have tried other cleansing oils and feel like they leave a residue. This is a pretty good price and lasts quite a while.</li>
    <li> I was worried about this potentially clogging my oily, acne-prone skin but it has done the opposite. Using this, in conjunction with an exfoliant has helped loosen up some of the clogged pore plugs in my oily, blackhead-ridden T-zone. I can sometimes literally feel those grainy little clogs come to the surface and pop out of my skin as I&#x27;m massaging this oil on my face. This dissolves my makeup and sunscreen with very little effort too (no more scrubbing with face wipes!) Since I am quite oily and acne-prone, I make sure to follow up with my regular cleanser after using this to remove any residual oils left behind. My face feels silky smooth, clean, and hydrated. This works better at removing oil/dirt/makeup from my face than any cleanser I&#x27;ve used by itself. There is a slight olive oil scent (which I like). Not all oils work the same on everyone so make sure to patch test a small area for a couple of days with a sample to make sure this doesn&#x27;t break you out. It&#x27;s a little pricey, but I think I enjoy it enough to repurchase the full bottle.</li>
    <li> Great for fast and easy make up or sun screen remover. One pump does it..I just rub it on my face then get in shower.  It takes off all make up easily.  Also lasts a long time because you don&#x27;t need much.</li>
    <li> I have an oily t-zone. I use this before I use exfoliating salycylic cleansing pads. This 1-2 punch approach to nighttime skin care dissolves the dirt and make-up. Sometimes I just use the DHC oil, rinse really well and then use astringent. It works so well!</li>
    <li> Expensive but works well if I rinse with it twice and then follow up with a regular foaming cleanser to remove any oily residue left behind.</li>
    <li> This oil really cleans and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling stripped.  I purchased this cleanser with the nighttime moisturizer and I will buy again.</li>
    <li> I like to use this oil as a gentle makeup remover at night. It&#x27;s important to smooth it onto your dry skin with dry fingers -- no water. Use your hands to massage it into your skin. It will gently remove makeup and grime. Then rinse with water and/or cleanser. I have sensitive skin and this works better, with no irritation, than anything else I&#x27;ve found. It rinses easily -- I usually just rinse with warm water.</li>
    <li> love it.. Love it... love it</li>
    <li> I have very dry sensitive skin, which still tends to be acne prone around my chin.  This stuff is wonderful!  It gets all the makeup off my skin and does a great job of removing my mascara as well.  It leaves me feeling clean but not dried out.</li>
    <li> I washed my face with this last night for the first time. I have combination oily skin and use HD matte foundation (it&#x27;s waterproof/sweatproof) and water proof mascara as part of my daily makeup ritual and this managed to remove all my makeup with ease. As I was using it I could see the makeup just melt/dissolve away. When I use my regular face wash (Shiseido Pureness line) I&#x27;ve noticed that there&#x27;s still makeup residue left on my towel when I dry my face. With this product, my face wiped clean and there wasn&#x27;t a trace of foundation or mascara. So, I believe it&#x27;s better than my normal face wash. The only downside for me is that (surprisingly) my skin felt a little dry afterwards. I had a few blemishes and when I woke up the next morning, they seemed to diminish and my skin normalized. I hope after more frequent use my skin will adjust accordingly and normalize. Overall, I think it&#x27;s a good product especially for removing caked on makeup.</li>
    <li> Great for removing makeup...and while you do not need to cleanse your face again after washing with it, you could probably benefit from using a toner. Also likely not a great fit for people with oilier skin but its great for dry skin and during winter months.</li>
    <li> Always my favourite!!!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t live without this product!! This oil dissolves even waterproof mascara in seconds without rubbing.  You simply apply to dry face, message a few minutes and rinse off with warm water. Removes all traces of makeup gently and thoroughly!!</li>
    <li> Hands down to this Japanese cleansing oil! Critically acclaimed to be most of beauty blogger&#x27;s HOLY GRAIL product! Saw this in youtube from many beauty gurus so I decided to try it! It definitely removes all my makeup, literally even my waterproof mascara with no hustle and bustle! Saved me from buying a separate eye makeup remover! Love the fact that it is made from olive oil so it is definitely natural. No wonder it is a Japanese staple makeup remover. Didn&#x27;t have to buy the expensive shu uemura cleansing oil because DHC CLEANSING OIL does the same work and a lot more inexpensive! Will buy more!! My skin is feeling even cleaner every after wash! Definitely my favorite!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a staple item - been using it for years!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my third bottle - can&#x27;t live without it! This product will take your makeup right off, without any residue and leaves your skin nice and soft.</li>
    <li> I have very oily, sensitive skin so I am very hesitant about trying new products.  After I read the reviews, I decided to try this.  I love this product.  I use it to remove my makeup, which it does completely, even eye makeup.  There is no oily residue after I wipe this off with a wet cloth. My makeup is completely gone in one quick step.  My face feels soft after I use this oil.  I will continue to use this daily.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and was delighted to find it on Amazon to save a few dollars.  The down side was I ordered another product by DHC and they were sent in different shipments.</li>
    <li> Great to use before you cleanse your face.  Prevents cleansers and soaps from dryng out your skin.  Probably more suited to those who have moderate to dry skin.</li>
    <li> Leaves my skin feeling fantastic!  It feels clean but hydrated--just the way you always thought your skin should feel! This works much better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried. I now look forward to washing my face each evening.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. A little goes along way and it is so hydrating.  I have noticed especially in the morning that I wake up and my skin is still hydrated, which is great for me as I am in my 50&#x27;s with mature skin that seems to get drier every year.&lt;br /&gt;Got a sample and tried it and that first look in the mirror the next morning hooked me big time! Am excitingly awaiting my first bottle!</li>
    <li> This is a great product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s alright! Haven&#x27;t used too much, just tried a little to see if that&#x27;s real.</li>
    <li> The best cleanser ever! Makes my face feel so good!</li>
    <li> Have used this product for years and love it. I have dry, sensitive skin and this cleanser leaves it soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else. This takes off all my makeup...no matter what I wear...without a greasy filmy residue. And it is fast.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my dry skin..! I was slightly afraid to buy a Japanese product due to radio active and stuff&lt;br /&gt;but it&#x27;s good so who cares</li>
    <li> I love the fresh clean smell and the way it easily removes make up without over drying.  I would recommend.</li>
    <li> This is a really good cleanser to get makeup off. I use this first to cleanse then follow by a skinceuticals cleanser</li>
    <li> I am in my mid 40&#x27;s and struggling with acne that is even worse than when I was a teenager.  My friend who recommended it to me has oily skin, but I have very dry skin, so I didn&#x27;t think it was going to work for me.  This product has cleared my skin and reduced the size of my pores, which I love.  My face feels clean and my skin looks clear - even below the surface.  It removes my makeup including the bullet proof mascara I wear every once in a while.</li>
    <li> Best product I have ever used that removes makeup first and then cleanses my face. Leaving my skin very clean but soft.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t...i don&#x27;t even know how i lived without this. I wear a lot of make up because im darker skinned and had really bad adult acne which left scars so id always be afraid i was leaving make up on my face after washing every night, but not with this. Literally two pumps inn my hands and on my face and a little rubbing..make up, gone. Yes even water proof mascara. My face it&#x27;s very sensitive,  oily dry combo but this doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy oily feel after i rinse. Rises clean off. Nor does it dry out my face. Its smooth and clean after, so i can wash my face and the face wash actually does its job. My skin has improved in that it doesn&#x27;t break out that much anymore if at all :)&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with how easy it is to use too. Also i use it to clean my make up brushes.</li>
    <li> I am a bit of a product &#x27;junkie&#x27;, especially skin care products, and have used probably hundreds of different products for skin cleansing and makeup removal, and this is the top one so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin prone to breakouts and hives, normal in oiliness. I wear makeup almost daily, and the foundation I  use is pretty high coverage, so I need a good cleanser like this to get it all off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use vitamin E oil to remove my eye makeup/mascara. This doesn&#x27;t entirely remove my waterproof mascara. I am fine with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is amazing that an oil can be formulated to be not oily, and to foam up and clean as well as this does. Don&#x27;t let the oil part scare you off, if anything this would be good for oily skin and makeup removal, it&#x27;s borderline drying.</li>
    <li> I have been using DHC Deep Cleansing Oil for years.  i wouldn&#x27;t think of going to bed without using it first even if I had no make-up on.  It is simply the best at leaving your skin soft and smooth and clean!!!!</li>
    <li> This is my first face oil cleanser. Does not break out my oily/sensitive skin. This oil washes away facial dirt and makeup. I do use a soap free gentile sudsy cleaner afterwards and 20% glycolic pads, then moisturizer.</li>
    <li> BEST makeup remover I have ever used. Melts away all makeup, even waterproof mascara. Just massage it onto your face add a little water, continue massaging and wash off. LOVE IT! Update: May 2015. Still using DHC cleansing oil. I now use a drop of it to clean my eye gel liner brush tip every day after use - no more eye infections.</li>
    <li> very oily but i guess mineral oil are all like that. Used it once. Not recommended for summer. Delivery was really fast. Thanks a lot</li>
    <li> the cleansing oil became milky when wash my face.....not too dry for my oily skin.....and it&#x27;s soft  nothing irritated feeling....and the shipping speed is not so bad even if it just standard shipping plan~~~~~i like it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used various oils on my face but have been reluctant to use one for cleansing. I purchased this while it was on sale and it is one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made! I thought the methods I was using to clean my face were effective but seeing how much more the DHC Deep Cleansing Oil removed after my face is &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; is amazing. Can&#x27;t imaging my daily routine without this product.</li>
    <li> This works great. It thoroughly cleans my face and rinses off completely. I will re-order this.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t live without this. Shu Uemura&#x27;s cleansing oils are amazing as well, but I&#x27;ve noticed that they&#x27;re not as effective as DHC&#x27;s at removing makeup or rinsing away cleanly. I love the Shu Uemura fragrance, and I love their oils (as they&#x27;re the ones who pretty much invented the cleansing oil); especially the Whitefficient formula - - but at $81 for a bloody bottle that isn&#x27;t as great as DHCs is just ridiculous. I don&#x27;t care how amazing their eyelash curler is, no cleansing oil is worth nearly three times the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is meant to emulsify immediately with water, so you have to use it with dry hands and dry face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it&#x27;s great by itself for most people, as it rinses cleanly - - but depending on your skin type and the type of skincare regimen you have, you might want to follow up afterward with a gentle cleanser. I use LaRoche-Posay&#x27;s Effaclar Purifying Foaming Gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is a godsend, and it takes EVERYTHING OFF. I can rub it gently on my eyelids, and it will dissolve my eyeliner (Urban Decay 24-7 Glide-On Eye Pencil - - quality stuff that does not budge; especially with UD&#x27;s Primer Potion) cleanly. Even if it gets in my eye, it doesn&#x27;t burn, sting, or dry my eyes out. Cold water or warm water, it immediately emulsifies and goes down the drain, and it leaves my skin soft, completely clean (without overdrying!), and ready for the next step.</li>
    <li> Like most, I was skeptical about using oil to thoroughly cleanse my face and not clog pores.  But I&#x27;m almost through my second bottle now and I will always use it.  Great smell, fantastic texture, and absolutely delivers as promised.  I would highly recommend using this as a part of your daily cleansing regimen.  I use it at night, but use a Clarisonic with either CeraVe or a foaming cleanser in the mornings.  VERY effective!!</li>
    <li> I have tried just about everything on the market to clean my face and this is by far the best product I have used. Make-up is removed and my skin is left feeling moist. I am very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it as your only cleanser, but it removes eye makeup better than any of the ones you have to shake and hold on your eyelid with a cotton pad.  It is far easier to just rub this on all over your face and eyes, then rinse it off.  No worries about tugging on delicate skin.  No Q-Tips to remove the last traces of mascara.  Even the waterproof stuff just rinses away.  You can easily remove the last traces of the Cleansing Oil itself just with your usual cleanser, if you&#x27;re worried about residue.  But frankly, it does rinse pretty clean.  I have always ordered it directly from DHC, but I was delighted to find it on Amazon, since I have a Prime account and can get free shipping!</li>
    <li> Great for taking makeup off. I don&#x27;t wear makeup very often, but I used it a few times and it worked like a charm. Does not leave you oily, but if you have sensitive skin I would recommend trying a sample first.</li>
    <li> I use this product as a precleanse to remove makeup followed by my favorite foam cleanser. It works great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a few years and love it.  It is excellent for removing make-up completely and seems to soften my skin.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product because it is so good for my skin. It will remove heavy eye make up&lt;br /&gt;and anything on your skin and leave your skin feeling clean and refreshed. It&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s healthy, formula is easy to analyze, does it&#x27;s job very well:) I was a bit worried because my skin is quite dry, but it turned out to be a very successful purchase. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Feels so good! I use it to massage my face, and it comes off leaving it sparkling clean, and not dry.</li>
    <li> I have been usingbthis,it is wondeful</li>
    <li> And a lovely herbal scent.  I enjoy using this product to remove my eye make up (I&#x27;m super-goth and cake it on!).</li>
    <li> This stuff feels like alchemy or magic.&lt;br /&gt;How on earth does an oil clean your face?&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless, my black eyeliner dissolves right off with this stuff, no need for another step of makeup remover.&lt;br /&gt;Works great!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use everyday but when I do I love this stuff.  It didn&#x27;t make me breakout which I am prone to.  Just be sure to cleanse with something very light like cetaphil or cerave just to make sure you get all of the oil residue off your face.  I definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I received a sample, and fell in love immediately.  I use this each evening at bedtime to remove my makeup.  It&#x27;s surprising how well an oil can clean your face, and yet, rinse off so easily!  It leaves my skin feeling so clean and fresh.  Will keep using it!!</li>
    <li> I just love this cleasning oil. Actully I tried other brands, but this works the best. I have used three bottles.&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
    <li> Usually I just use makeup wipes to get all my makeup off, but thanks to reddit I decided to try this out.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m amazed with it, really no better word to describe my reaction. What I love the most about this oil is that it dissolves with water; it rinses off so easily, along with all that makeup... and still leaves just enough oil to keep your face feeling moisturized. I use this stuff day and night and just love it, I feel like I&#x27;m going to using this for life!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wish I had found out about this years ago... so much easier, faster, and better for my skin! Not to mention well worth the price; this&#x27;ll last me much longer than a pack of wipes would.</li>
    <li> My child was on Accutane, and as a result has very dry, easily irritated skin.  This product both cleanses perfectly and help retain moisture in the skin, so much so that I think I&#x27;ll have to try it for myself!</li>
    <li> Definitely helps with getting the makeup off.  I pair it with a facial cleanser; leaves the skin nice and smooth.</li>
    <li> My face is not clean until I use this. If I run out, I feel all my pores are congested. I double cleanse with Deep Cleansing Oil instead of cleansing second with soap. I love it and I have recently added the Extra Virgin Oil as my moisturizer and my skin is glowing and in heaven.</li>
    <li> Let me first say, I LOVE this product. I have combination skin and I was looking for a deep cleansing product that wouldn&#x27;t strip my skin of its natural oils and still wear away at my daily makeup. My daily makeup routine consists of primer (both facial and eyelid), bb cream, liquid liner, and diorshow mascara. When I use this product at night, I find that the oil completely dissolves my facial makeup, but upon rinsing, there are still traces of mascara under my eyes. I use eye makeup remover after using this product and rinse again with cold water. It would be nice if this oil took off all my makeup, but I don&#x27;t find it too inconvenient to take that extra step of cleansing. If you don&#x27;t wear a ton of water resistant eye makeup, then this is a five-star product for you. It gets the job done, is packaged conveniently in a pump bottle with a screw-off top (to get the last of it) and has a very mild scent. I use two pumps every time I cleanse and one bottles lasts me well over 3 months. I use this product every night and I&#x27;m definitely guilty of stockpiling this product :} hope you enjoy it as much as I do ^^</li>
    <li> this was my second bottle and first bottle and it really cleans my skin well and gentle on my skin( sensitive and red skin),</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used cleansing oils for a long time. My recent favorite was a lotus seed one I purchased from Japan, but I used up all of that and so I bought this DHC deep cleansing oil. Though the smell isn&#x27;t comparable to lotus flowers, besides the smell it&#x27;s really good.&lt;br /&gt;Just one pump is enough and remember to not wet your face or your hands before application. Massage it into your face and neck and clean off all that makeup; it&#x27;ll leave your skin nice and supple and not dried out.&lt;br /&gt;I suffered from horrible acne before switching to cleansing oils; I learned that my skin will rebel to harsh chemicals and the way to attack acne (at least for me) isn&#x27;t to hardcore attack it but to gently and slowly treat it with skin-friendly ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;So give it a try if you haven&#x27;t already, I think you&#x27;ll be just as happy as I am!</li>
    <li> I have tried several types of cleansing products to remove my makeup. This is the best one. Mild on face, but cleanse very well. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 49 years old and I have combination skin.  I&#x27;ve used lots of makeup removers and cleansers over the years but this seems to be the best for my skin.  I use an eye makeup remover to take off my mascara and then use this to clean my face and remove tall the rest of the makeup.  I like that it&#x27;s a water rinse-able oil and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  I like it even better that I found it on Amazon cheaper than I&#x27;ve been getting it at DHC and there&#x27;s free shipping.  Can&#x27;t beat that!  I recommend DHC Deep Cleansing Oil for combination skin.</li>
    <li> Made my skin GLOW!!! It has been a long time since my skin looked this good. This will always be my facial cleanser.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this product.  buy it and you&#x27;ll see why.  it is the best product out there for makeup removal and leaves your skin soft and clean.  I LOVE IT!!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the DHC cleansing oil for years.  It removes the toughest make up (including waterproof mascara) easily. No more tugging at your eyes with cotton pads.  I take 2 pumps and apply to a dry face.  Rinse with water and watch it all disappear. Beware, you must wash your face after using the oil.  My daughters use it as well.  I&#x27;ve tried other cleansing oils, Bobbi Brown, Jose Maran and they do not compare.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> My skin is the best it has ever been after using this product.  I used to have acne on my face and tiny bumps on my chin.  Everything I tried (face wash, acne creams, etc.) just made it worse and made my skin super dry.  I finally decided to try this after reading reviews for the Shu Uemura and Josie Maran cleansing oils and hearing that the DHC was better.  I&#x27;m so happy with the results.  This product goes on so smooth and when you wash it off your face is left feeling clean and not at all dry.  There is no greasiness to it whatsoever.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Nothing takes makeup off like DHC Deep Cleansing Oil.  Nothing.  And, I think I&#x27;ve tried them all....Try it, you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
    <li> I tried this as a sample and I loved it - it gets rid of makeup easily and leaves your skin feeling soft and moisturized, which is hard to find in a face wash. The issues I have with this product. Two things - first, the price. I mean, really, the main ingredient is olive oil, nothing too fancy to justify the $30 a bottle. Second, which is the reason I won&#x27;t purchase a full bottle - it has parabens in it, which I am avoiding so as not to further increase my chances of getting cancer! I was very surprised to find it in the ingredients list since most high end beauty products no longer contain parabens. I hope DHC is working on removing parabens from their products since I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m not the only customer they&#x27;ve lost as the public is becoming more aware of harmful ingredients.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 30, and i finally found the best facial cleansing and make up remover product out there. My make up just melts off and is excellent for aging skin like mine as well as acne prone sin, again, like mine.  This also works great for cleaning your make up brushes. When i used soap or detergent on them they wold fall apart over time because it was too rough on them and brushes cost $money$ if you want good ones. So this not only removes stubborn thick and waterproof make up but will clean and pro long your make up and foundation brushes as well.</li>
    <li> Great to remove make up.</li>
    <li> Broke me out baaaaaaad</li>
    <li> dried my normal skin out after cleansing. would not repurchase.</li>
    <li> had tried a sample of this and loved it, what I received seemed different, not bad but I have other cleansers I prefer</li>
    <li> This is the best makeup remover out there!  I have searched near and far for a good makeup remover and this is definitely it!  You just rub the oil into your skin (with no water) and then rinse.  It strips off everything as well as stubborn waterproof steelproof mascara!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had acne forever. I am 63 years old now, and I can tell you I&#x27;ve tried every acne product on the market.  I kept using face scrubs and acne face washes, and medicated lotions that did nothing to clear up my skin. This product washes off with water and leaves my skin clean and soft. Make up comes off easily.  Yes, even mascara and eye liner!  And it&#x27;s working to heal my skin!  I will never use anything else!</li>
    <li> First let me say that I have been using DHC products for years and love them.  I was always curious to the rave reviews this product received and the boasting from DHC that this is their most popular selling item.  Soooooo I finally broke down and bought it.  I have very dry mature skin and this crap is useless.  I agree with the other reviewer that it just does not remove my eye makeup and my skin actually feels taunt and incredibly dry after using it.  I&#x27;ll stick with cetaphil face soap from now on.</li>
    <li> This is a product I have been always used. It can remove all the cosmetic you take without having any harm on you</li>
    <li> I use this olive oil product to wash my face at night.  It is very good at removing makeup, and does not leave an oily film like other products I have tried.  DHC is a great company.</li>
    <li> This product is amazingly simple. At the end of a long day, I used to remove my makeup with three different make up removers. Now, I simply use this olive oil based cleanser and my skin is not only clean, it&#x27;s returning to a smooth, supple surface, instead of the over drying from the previous products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no hesitation recommending DHC products to anyone interested in simplifying their cleansing and skin care regime while improving the overall appearance and suppleness of their skin.</li>
    <li> Very effective for removing makeup, but tough if you wear contacts while washing.  Becomes blurry with oil for a bit.  Rinses off clean.</li>
    <li> Gental and easy to remove make up</li>
    <li> This was a great oil for removing makeup.  I usually used this for removing makeup then used my normal gentle cleanser after just to be sure I got everything.  I just wish I didn&#x27;t use it up so quickly!</li>
    <li> I LIKE IT ,I LOVE IT ,,I LIKE IT ,I LOVE IT ,,I LIKE IT ,I LOVE IT ,,I LIKE IT ,I LOVE IT ,,</li>
    <li> This product is very concentrated.  I use it nighly to remove my makeup.  Love how it feels on my face and it works great getting all  traces of makeup off.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first that an olive oil face wash would actually do all that it said it would.  When I first used it, I couldn&#x27;t believe the results and that it took all my makeup off completely and thoroughly.  I was just amazed.  My skin felt so clean and fresh without feeling oily as one would think.  It&#x27;s an amazing product and wouldn&#x27;t use any other.</li>
    <li> Used product for years. Little goes a long way. One pump, massage all over face, work into problem areas, wipe off with tissue and rinse off. Wash face as normal. Your skin feels clean after just rinsing off.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several years now, ever since I got a free sample in the mail one day.  My husband has very sensitive skin that breaks out anytime he tries a new product.  However with this, he never did.  If he starts breaking out due to stress he washes his face with this once or twice and it clears right up.  I love that I can use this to clean my face and remove my makeup.  One easy step!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An earlier review made me giggle.  Of course, it&#x27;s oily.  It&#x27;s olive oil!  But it really regulates oil production in your skin.  I used to be shiny in the T-zone and now I&#x27;m rarely shiny, even in summer.  This is appropriate for oily skin and summer usage too.  Try it, you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
    <li> Keeps skins soft and smooth. Goes a long way. Good value for price. I would recommend to others. I saw it in SAMs Club yesterday, too.</li>
    <li> Best makeup remover especially when followed with Mild Soap. It cleanses every scrap of makeup, mascara, foundation etc, better than any product out there. I have used it for years and years, will never use anything else. No breakouts, no irritation, no filmy residue. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Removes eye make up better than any other product I&#x27;ve tried.  Very gentle.  Rinses easily and leaves skin feeling soft, but not greasy.</li>
    <li> no scrubbing, squinting, swearing as you remove gunk from your face. I don&#x27;t usually wear much makeup but when I do wear some, esp. eye makeup, I am thankful this lil guy is waiting in my bathroom, &amp;#34;come home to momma&amp;#34; :)</li>
    <li> I was skeptical but I am now a believer!! This deep cleansing oil works beautifully, with very little smell and no residue. Just a small amount cleans off my makeup and leaves my skin feeling fresh.</li>
    <li> A must have!!! I cant&#x27;t imagine how I survived removing my make up with out this products all these years. My skin is VERY oily, ridiculous. I get black and white heads no matter what expensive make up products I use. I even own a clarisonic mia brush and this product is so great, you don&#x27;t even need the brush. It&#x27;s magic. I have had only 2 pimples ever since I started using it, and I use to break out every week, because my pores were clogged. Not anymore!!! Not with this wonderful DHC Deep Cleansing Oil miracle product. I tried the Oil Cleansing Method a couple of years ago, you basically use jojoba oil and castor oil to remove the dirt and impurities from your face and that did not work for me at all. So, if you had a bad experience with other oils like I did, trust me on this one, it will not disappoint you.</li>
