      <li>It was a good investment.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s all good.</li>
      <li>My scalp would be happiest when I shaved every 4th day which the Headblade didn&#x27;t do so good at.  </li>

      <li>The blades are a good quality.</li>
      <li>you are gliding those blades along a glassy surface that has never been so smooth, so frictionless, so perfect...</li>

      <li>I love these razors!</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d avoid this unless you want to see how many cuts you can make on your head!</li>
      <li>(luckily I love my husband&#x27;s head!).  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Fortunately, I got this as a gift and didn&#x27;t have to buy; but I won&#x27;t be buying on my own.</li>
      <li>time I thought hey, if 2 is good then 3 will be better.  </li>
      <li>I have been using Head Blades for four years now great way for bald guys to have a clean head thank you.</li>
      <li>Great for bald heads and at a super bulk rate...  </li>
      <li>Perfect and works great , super fast shipper, thats all I have to say but need four more words to submit this</li>
      <li>it gets clogged; and very easy at that.  </li>
      <li>I have been quite pleased.  </li>
      <li>Great makes shaving much faster and smoother.</li>
      <li>Those work OK, but I think this cartridge is better.</li>
      <li>but with more work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not yet sure how many shaves</li>
      <li>I will buy more as a gift to my &amp;#34;head shaving&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>I was already balding as it is, and I&#x27;m so glad I decided to shave my head.</li>
      <li>I love how it works.  </li>
      <li>Simply the best head shaving solution I ever used!</li>
      <li>You won&#x27;t find a better deal anywhere else.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It should be noted that the design of the headblade is best for the head and does not work well on the back of the neck or around the ears.  </li>
      <li>I actual get the best feel with a blade that has been used for three days and lasts a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I love my HeadBlade H3.</li>
      <li>love my headblade.</li>
      <li>Once you train your self and do it daily it becomes the best balding shave I have found.  </li>
      <li>To cut myself so many times in one shave--unheard of.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found this</li>
      <li>I LOVE these.  </li>
      <li>burn I love it.</li>
      <li>Makes the job easier, faster and performance for removal of hair is outstanding.</li>
      <li>I like these more than the 4 or 6 bladed ones, these seem to be able to rinse out the hairs easier than the 4 or 6 bladed ones</li>
      <li>They do feel better than the two blade model.</li>
      <li>These cartridges have good durability and consistent quality.</li>
      <li>This would be a good product if the blades were a bit higher quality.  </li>
      <li>This is by far the best product on the market for shaving your head on a consistent basis.  </li>
      <li>The wheels on the shaver seem to keep the blades at the perfect angle and the blades provide a easy very smooth shave with little effort.</li>
      <li>The Headblade seemed like a good solution, its design implied it would follow the curvature of one&#x27;s head more naturally.  </li>
      <li>Using this product you can ensure a clean, safe, and close shave for your head.</li>
      <li>I have alternated back and forth from my Gillette mach 3 turbo to see which I liked better and must say I like my mach 3 turbo much better.</li>
      <li>The downside is that you&#x27;d better have that sunscreen ready at all times or you&#x27;ll be able to fry eggs up</li>
      <li>you shaved your head daily then this might be the best for you, but I like to go two or three days between shaves and the hair gets gummed up in the blades too much.</li>
      <li>Ok I started shaving my head a month ago and right after the buzz cut I used the head blade Triple blade.</li>
      <li>Works great, nice clean shave with very little shaving irritation.</li>
      <li>but when thinking about it and anything else in today&#x27;s world that makes me go \\&quot;hmmmm\\&quot;, the only thing I can think is that this design was chosen because of money...money because you&#x27;ll be more apt to change the blades out and instead of taking the time to clean it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It seems more natural since I have used it for years and it seems to do a better job of shaving with fewer strokes.</li>
      <li>The wheels, it&#x27;s the first thing you notice when pulling this beautiful bumblebee colored work of american ingenuity out of it&#x27;s box...</li>
      <li>These are excellent blads though that clean out nicely not leaving hair stuck in the blade or between blades.  </li>
      <li>They do last a good while too.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve use them before becuase they are safe and fast.</li>
      <li>I only wish the blades would flush out the hairs better!</li>
      <li>and then when you put those three blades of fine german craftsmanship to your dome you realize instantly that there is a great need for the tread because....</li>
      <li>Gets me a perfectly smooth shave every time without much razor burn.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll get on one blade, but so far I love these blades.</li>
      <li>They are very sharp, be sure to take care :) would buy again</li>
      <li>As most of us Baldies know, electric is less close but more convenient while blades shave closer.  </li>
      <li>I usually have to pay $8-$10 per pack, so at this price  this is a great deal.</li>
      <li>It is very unusual for me to cut myself.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re someone who can&#x27;t shave his scalp more often than 2x a week, personally I&#x27;d advise buying a different razor, but if you can shave frequently the Headblade does a pretty good job once you get the hang of it.  </li>
      <li>the only thing that would be a bit better would be for Headblade to make an adaptor to clip in the Gilette Fusion Pro Glide blades which shave even closer.  </li>
      <li>Do not rush shaving with a fresh blade and rinse very often.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been shaving my head entirely bald since 2006, and have used the Gillette products a lot, but have mostly just been using headblade cartridges since I first found them in a store awhile back.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This product exactly matched my requirements.</li>
      <li>I started shaving my head 5 years ago and love the look and feel, not so much the chore of doing the actual shaving.  </li>
      <li>Its not a bad razor for head shaving per say, but it depends on how frequently you can shave your head without getting bumps or scales in retaliation from your scalp.  </li>
      <li>As a long time head shaving guy, I usually have to go over certain spots many, many times to get it smooth.</li>
      <li>because of this little derivation, the inside of the blade fills with hair and effectively stops shaving hair.  </li>
      <li>Really like the ease of use for the headblade products.  </li>
      <li>Recommend them highly!</li>
      <li>The razor comes with an adapter for the sensor blades but the refill only includes the ones that will fit the head blades.</li>
      <li>have just ventured into safety razors for my face and those blades are much sharper.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Maybe quality is not on the highest level but this shaver functions very well</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve had everything from blood baths to too much</li>
      <li>I have not ventured in on learning to use a straight edge on my head or safety razor.  </li>
      <li>Once you get the hang of it and become comfortable with how you hold it, using it becomes second nature.  </li>
      <li>It works very well and he really loves it.</li>
      <li>Much closer shave.</li>

    <li> Works great, keeps my head nice and smooth, just like my wife likes it!</li>
    <li> Simply the best head shaving solution I ever used! I will buy more as a gift to my &amp;#34;head shaving&amp;#34; friends and family.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe quality is not on the highest level but this shaver functions very well and I truly like it a lot!</li>
    <li> These are for my husband. He has been using these head blades for several years. For any man who shaves their head this is a great product. And on amazon you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> My Dad has cancer, so he shaves his head.  He is quite shaky, so we tried this product so he wouldn&#x27;t cut himself when shaving.  It works very well and he really loves it.</li>
    <li> Items being returned.</li>
    <li> I have been using the head blade for a year now.  I love how it works.  It was recommended to me by a friend.</li>
    <li> I have to tell you that at first I was leery about this head shaver, but after using it, I was blown away at the ease of the shave and especially the results. As a long time head shaving guy, I usually have to go over certain spots many, many times to get it smooth. The wheels on the shaver seem to keep the blades at the perfect angle and the blades provide a easy very smooth shave with little effort. I&#x27;m not yet sure how many shaves I&#x27;ll get on one blade, but so far I love these blades.</li>
    <li> this was a gift from my husband he said it is not the same as the original one I had bought him the will so I believe are a little different however he does like it there&#x27;s nothing like head blade I would definitely buy again</li>
    <li> I like these more than the 4 or 6 bladed ones, these seem to be able to rinse out the hairs easier than the 4 or 6 bladed ones</li>
    <li> I have been using Head Blades for four years now great way for bald guys to have a clean head thank you.</li>
    <li> replacement blades are the correct blade for my head shave system. Will continue to buy replacement blades in the future.</li>
    <li> The only way to shave your head!!  I&#x27;ve been using these for years and the product.  You will too, so get it now!!!</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;ve used HeadBlade for a few years now, and I usually purchase the double blade pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time I thought hey, if 2 is good then 3 will be better.  WRONG.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades are much closer together than the double and as such can&#x27;t pass long hairs out the back as easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you shaved your head daily then this might be the best for you, but I like to go two or three days between shaves and the hair gets gummed up in the blades too much.</li>
    <li> I made the switch to Headblade years ago when I decided to start shaving my noggin&#x27;.  I LOVE these.  Between the blades and the design of the handle, it makes shaving my head way easier.  You can get about 2-3 shaves out of each blade depending on the thickness of your hair (I have pretty thick hairs).  The only downside is that I have trouble finding them at any local stores, so I usually order them online.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the headblade with Gillette Atra and Sensor/Sensor XL cartridges. Those work OK, but I think this cartridge is better. I&#x27;ve been shaving my head entirely bald since 2006, and have used the Gillette products a lot, but have mostly just been using headblade cartridges since I first found them in a store awhile back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problems I have had with these cartridges are that they go dull a bit quicker than I&#x27;d expect them to, and can be pricey. I buy mine in bulk here on Amazon to save money. I used to buy them in a drug store. Not a great idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like using a headblade, I highly recommend trying these cartridges if you haven&#x27;t already.</li>
    <li> My husband has been using the Head Blade system for at least 8 years now and will not go back to a disposable straight razor.  This razor system helps alleviate cuts on the scalp, esp. when used with the Head Blade &amp;#34;Slick&amp;#34; prior to shaving his head. He recommends highly.  He found out about this great razor from another gentleman who had to shave his beautiful head of hair for a community play and he also recommended this product.</li>
    <li> Not able to remove previous blades and insert new ones. No instructions. Stymied!</li>
    <li> It gives me the close shave that I want.  I have tried other blades and they just don&#x27;t get to the level of closeness I want. This is the BEST.</li>
    <li> ....these are my go-to blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to the Sport+Triple blade combo after finding the ATX a little bulky for me.  I have been quite pleased.  Even though I can shave my head with any number of blades or clippers - I have found that, for me at least - the Sport+Triple Combo is the smoothest. Proglides aren&#x27;t bad and can match the Headblade but with more work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A tip for guys having a hard time with these - if you&#x27;re like me, and you&#x27;re used to pressing your skin some as you shave your face in order to get it smoother. Don&#x27;t do that with these until you&#x27;ve had a chance to use it and can gauge how tight it will shave your skull with zero pressure.  Adding pressure without &amp;#34;getting&amp;#34; the movement and feel of a &amp;#34;push&amp;#34; blade is a sure-fire way to cut yourself.</li>
    <li> I bought this item for my balding husband who was in the military and used to the &amp;#34;close&amp;#34; head shave.  I must admit it really takes any stubble all the way down and makes his head shinier than ever (luckily I love my husband&#x27;s head!).  The downside is that you&#x27;d better have that sunscreen ready at all times or you&#x27;ll be able to fry eggs up there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside I see with this product is that it requires multiple blade changes which can really add up...but what the heck...nothing&#x27;s perfect now, is it?</li>
    <li> Delivered as advertised. The included adapters are for the head blades only. The razor comes with an adapter for the sensor blades but the refill only includes the ones that will fit the head blades. The blades are a good quality. Came with an coupon that was expired 6 months.</li>
    <li> use on my hubbys bald head!! works wonderful !! They are very sharp, be sure to take care :) would buy again</li>
    <li> I think the new HeadBlade ATX design is very awkward, so I bought a replacement HeadBlade Sport directly from the company when my last one wore out (I could only find the ATX in local stores). Although they have designed the new ATX cartridges to retro-fit all prior models, I think the attachment method for those cartridges is also inferior to this older design. These cartridges have good durability and consistent quality. I have been using a HeadBlade daily for about 10 years.</li>
    <li> Any man who shaves his head will find this razor to be sent from heaven.  Makes the job easier, faster and performance for removal of hair is outstanding.</li>
    <li> I have been tinkering around with this product for a while and I&#x27;ve had everything from blood baths to too much stuble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;m using HB4s (maybe not for everyone) with my Sportster and it is the perfect combination for me! Steelhead close and no need for my styptic pencil!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lovin&#x27; it!</li>
    <li> This is the best method for shaving your head.  Works great, nice clean shave with very little shaving irritation.</li>
    <li> close shave but not a large enough box</li>
    <li> This product exactly matched my requirements. I&#x27;ve use them before becuase they are safe and fast. I would recommend the product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have been using the HeadBlade for over 2 years now. It takes me about 3 minutes to shave my head in the shower. The only time I cut my head is when the blade is getting old.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years now, when I decide to embrace my baldness. Using this product you can ensure a clean, safe, and close shave for your head. So far the only place I can find it is through amazon. It was a good investment.</li>
    <li> The triple Blade cartridges work great the only thing that would be a bit better would be for Headblade to make an adaptor to clip in the Gilette Fusion Pro Glide blades which shave even closer.  These are excellent blads though that clean out nicely not leaving hair stuck in the blade or between blades.  Recommend them highly!</li>
    <li> Four stars as I think they are a wee bit overpriced. They do feel better than the two blade model. They do last a good while too.  If you gonna start shaving your head, look at Headblade stuff. It&#x27;s all good.</li>
    <li> I started shaving my head 5 years ago and love the look and feel, not so much the chore of doing the actual shaving.  As most of us Baldies know, electric is less close but more convenient while blades shave closer.  I personally can&#x27;t use a electric shaver, my scalp reacts negatively to it so I used to use a Fusion razor and would shave 2x a week on average until a friend of mine told me about the Headblade he used.  The Headblade seemed like a good solution, its design implied it would follow the curvature of one&#x27;s head more naturally.  I&#x27;ve tried both the twin and triple blades in my 11 months of using this razor and have during that time, nicked and cut myself every now and then compared to not at all with my Fusion.  I noticed that if I shaved every other day, the Headblade did a decent job of letting me smooth out my dome.  But if I let more than two days go by, it would take a lot longer to shave my head in the shower, and often I&#x27;d collect a few nicks along the way for it.  The problem became the frequency, my scalp rebelled despite using pre-shaving products designed to minimize ingrown hair follicles and other pitfalls of shaving one&#x27;s scalp frequently.  My scalp would be happiest when I shaved every 4th day which the Headblade didn&#x27;t do so good at.  Its not a bad razor for head shaving per say, but it depends on how frequently you can shave your head without getting bumps or scales in retaliation from your scalp.  If you&#x27;re someone who can&#x27;t shave his scalp more often than 2x a week, personally I&#x27;d advise buying a different razor, but if you can shave frequently the Headblade does a pretty good job once you get the hang of it.  The friend who first recommended it to me still uses his Headblade daily, I however went back to my Fusion.</li>
    <li> I love my HeadBlade H3. I tried the H4 and thought they were awful so I switched back to H3. They don&#x27;t sell H3&#x27;s in stores I&#x27;ve noticed so I have to get them on Amazon now.</li>
    <li> Really like the ease of use for the headblade products.  Have used these blades for awhile and would recommend to anyone shaving your head.</li>
    <li> RETURNED, product was open</li>
    <li> It works awesome and I don&#x27;t cut my head!  I only wish the blades would flush out the hairs better!</li>
    <li> Great product. Gives clean shave and very sharp. Be very careful because you could cut yourself .</li>
    <li> Perfect and works great , super fast shipper, thats all I have to say but need four more words to submit this</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found this, I HATE paying for razor blades. With this quantity, I won&#x27;t have to buy anymore for a year. The headblade is great, I&#x27;ve been doing it for over a year. I was already balding as it is, and I&#x27;m so glad I decided to shave my head. Makes life easier and the wife loves it. You won&#x27;t find a better deal anywhere else.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t get these in the store anymore everyone started to only carry the new 4 blade. Found these and bought a 6 month supply for under $30. Can&#x27;t beat that.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;...it&#x27;s you and me baby, headblade...&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I sing that to foreigner all the time!&lt;br /&gt;Dammit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love my headblade. This is a great way to get a quality blade at a good price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Todd.</li>
    <li> Ok I started shaving my head a month ago and right after the buzz cut I used the head blade Triple blade. Do not rush shaving with a fresh blade and rinse very often. I rushed and carved out some tear drop chunks out my scalp which bled a lot. That is not the head blades fault for cutting me I was rushing. I have alternated back and forth from my Gillette mach 3 turbo to see which I liked better and must say I like my mach 3 turbo much better. It seems more natural since I have used it for years and it seems to do a better job of shaving with fewer strokes. I shave my head every other to three days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give this a try and experiment.</li>
    <li> I have been using these blades for about 3 to 4 years now. I tried the double blade design but they werent right for my head and cut every pass. these blades dont cut often and do a great job.</li>
    <li> The headblade system is the only one that glides over your head which eliminates cuts and nicks.  This is by far the best product on the market for shaving your head on a consistent basis.  This is the only product I will ever buy.</li>
    <li> This would be a good product if the blades were a bit higher quality.  That is the one problem that I have with it.  I like the way it curves around your head, but with the head, you need a good blade.</li>
    <li> Head Blade is the way to go for a shaved .Easy to use.Best used in the shower.wash head with witch hazel afterwards.</li>
    <li> Note the quantity, more then i expected, now I&#x27;ve got a supply that will last me at least a year.</li>
    <li> I have been using a regular safety razor to shave my head for about a year; this product was recommended as a way to simplify the shaving process. Unfortunately, it cut my scalp on the first pass through and I ended up with 5 bandages on my head for several days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve moved on to an electric razor, which is not as short as my prior safety razor, but leads less blood on the towel and fewer bandages on my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d avoid this unless you want to see how many cuts you can make on your head!</li>
    <li> Great makes shaving much faster and smoother. I get a lot closer shave with less razor burn I love it.</li>
    <li> Product was as described and shipped before promised</li>
    <li> Great for bald heads and at a super bulk rate...  We use these everyday for the closest shaves.  Good stuff</li>
    <li> This I found to be the best shave for my head.  The blades point forward instead of down like a normal razor and the key to a great shave is to do it daily.  If you wait 2-3 days I would not recommend.  The reason is that you need to learn to shave differently than you do now.  You wear it like a ring on the ring finger with the last finger apply pressure to the back wheel.  If the pressure is not on the back wheel then the blade will dig in.  Guess the result.  Once you train your self and do it daily it becomes the best balding shave I have found.  I have not ventured in on learning to use a straight edge on my head or safety razor.  However, I have used all the named brands store razors and electric razors.  If you wait more than 2 days the hair is long enough for the blade to pull forcing the blade down and the wheel up with the same result as not putting enough pressure on the wheel with the change in hair density.  I actual get the best feel with a blade that has been used for three days and lasts a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have just ventured into safety razors for my face and those blades are much sharper.  Safety blades are way better than multiple blades, but it will be a long time before I think about using that on my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It should be noted that the design of the headblade is best for the head and does not work well on the back of the neck or around the ears.  Areas where you have indentations.  For those areas use what you would use on your face.</li>
    <li> So all in all it&#x27;s not too bad a blade.  Once you get the hang of it and become comfortable with how you hold it, using it becomes second nature.  I did cut myself on the first use, but new blades always seem to nick me.  Here&#x27;s the bad though...it gets clogged; and very easy at that.  In looking at and comparing the Headblade blades with standard blades, I&#x27;ve found that the back of the Headblade blade is completely enclosed...because of this little derivation, the inside of the blade fills with hair and effectively stops shaving hair.  Also, because it is completely enclosed in the back, it is frustratingly difficult to clear the hair from the blade.  It becomes even worse when using the Menthol shave gel that Headblade makes because the gel is so gummy.  Not sure who designed this blade but when thinking about it and anything else in today&#x27;s world that makes me go \\&quot;hmmmm\\&quot;, the only thing I can think is that this design was chosen because of money...money because you&#x27;ll be more apt to change the blades out and instead of taking the time to clean it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately, I got this as a gift and didn&#x27;t have to buy; but I won&#x27;t be buying on my own.</li>
    <li> I love these razors! Gets me a perfectly smooth shave every time without much razor burn. Hiiiighly recommended for those who Bic it!</li>
    <li> The wheels, it&#x27;s the first thing you notice when pulling this beautiful bumblebee colored work of american ingenuity out of it&#x27;s box... You see the tread used for the wheels is the same tread used in the audi commercials when drivers are gliding across glass-like roads with complete control and then when you put those three blades of fine german craftsmanship to your dome you realize instantly that there is a great need for the tread because.... Oh mein Gott! you are gliding those blades along a glassy surface that has never been so smooth, so frictionless, so perfect... the angles are perfect, the grip is immaculate, and results are perfection. You may cut yourself the first couple of times but that&#x27;s due to the driver not the car...</li>
    <li> I purchased the Headblade Sport Ultimate Head Shaver and started using regular shaving cream and decided to try Headslick shave cream. This is the perfect companion to the shaver. Much closer shave. Purchased these extra blades</li>
    <li> I usually have to pay $8-$10 per pack, so at this price  this is a great deal. I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have used the 4-blade model for months with no issues, sometimes going two weeks between shaves. No issues at all. As soon as I put the 3-blade in, I cut myself. Again and again. I ended up with a half dozen cuts, two of them pretty bad. It hurt so bad I had to sleep with a hat. Not to mention that it clogged up incredibly fast, and was pretty difficult to clean. And for all that, the shave was not as close as the 4-blade version. I&#x27;m 31 years old, and I&#x27;ve used a lot of razors in my life. It is very unusual for me to cut myself. To cut myself so many times in one shave--unheard of. Maybe I&#x27;m doing something wrong, since so many other people have loved this model. Me? I&#x27;m returning mine, and I will never consider it again.</li>
    <li> you can&#x27;t beat the price</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaving cartridges because my husband was always complaining about his dull blade so buying in quantity seemed to be the way to go.  They arrived just fine and as promised in a few days however I have been listening to him lately complain about the blades getting dull pretty quickly.  Don&#x27;t know is we got a bad batch or they just don&#x27;t last very long.</li>
