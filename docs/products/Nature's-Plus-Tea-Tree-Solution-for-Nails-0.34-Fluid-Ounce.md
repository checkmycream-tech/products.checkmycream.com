### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Working great on my toe nails!</li>
      <li>best nail fungus killer</li>
      <li>Excellent product and finding results gradually .</li>
      <li>Great product and appears to work well.  </li>
      <li>They are almost all better and SO happy!</li>
      <li>Good TTO tingles a bit upon application, and this is no exception.</li>
      <li>Thursday Plantation is much superior.</li>
      <li>It will take a good 6 months before I see any benefits but am very confident this will work.</li>
      <li>This, however, is the one they intended for nails, and the nail brush attached to the cap makes it very easy to apply.  </li>
      <li>This is best performed by a professional groomer.</li>
      <li>Works great for that haha.</li>
      <li>but the symptom was overwhelming the oil&#x27;s healing property.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ll post a bit more info on how I got rid of it.</li>
      <li>A more thorough description of the product&#x27;s ingredients:&lt;br /</li>
      <li>Love this product, after using for two weeks my nail fungus is almost gone..</li>
      <li>It works better than anything your doctor can prescribe, without messing up your insides.</li>
      <li>one day I had a drop of this oil on my healthy finger accidentally which I did not wipe straight away but smeared all over my hands as I thought it was good and antiseptic.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and comes with an application brush.</li>
      <li>very good  as expected ..</li>
      <li>Thursday Plantation is NOT cruelty free.</li>
      <li>Originally got this for my boyfriends foot fungus issue, but he never used it.</li>
      <li>And it has been shown to have mild antiseptic</li>
      <li>This is the original, genuine Australian TTO, very potent and very oily.</li>
      <li>Just like the straight solution, this one has a strong tea tree component</li>
      <li>Not a strong scent like most these which I am glad!</li>
      <li>Would probably not buy again because i could make my own concoction in larger amounts.</li>
      <li>It starts right on the spot I applied this oil after a couple of days</li>
      <li>She will be able to tell you how to care for your nail better than I. Mine took six months to grow back properly.</li>
      <li>This really does work!  </li>
      <li>But my nails are now healthy and tea tree oil/solution on my nails within that routine was KEY.</li>
      <li>&amp; I can really start to notice a difference.</li>
      <li>It seems to take forever, then one day you realize your tow looks normal again!</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t wait until my nail looks 100% normal again!</li>
      <li>I tried prescription and OTC topical remedies and OTC&#x27;s like Tea Tree Solution is better than the prescription topical.  </li>
      <li>the essential oil off-gasses quickly.</li>
      <li>The new nailsl that are growing out are clear.</li>
      <li>I did see my smalls toes clear up</li>
      <li>I will never have my nails professionally manicured again.</li>
      <li>To early to tell if it works completely</li>
      <li>This is a well packaged item for use on your nails if you have developed fungus.</li>
      <li>I still have a bit of a scar under the nail as the whole thing was caused by stubbing my big toe.</li>
      <li>but it is slow treating this fungus as are most products that are OTC.  </li>
      <li>This stuff absolutely works but you have to be patient and follow a routine every single day.</li>
      <li>Topical medications alone are usually not curative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>A natural antiseptic, essential oil, steam-distilled from the leaf of Melaleuca</li>
      <li>and I used it believing it would heal it, while wondering why the affected areas always seem to get worse after application, but convincing myself it was not because of tea tree</li>
      <li>After washing, I would thoroughly dry the nail and surrounding area, cut back any nail that had grown enough to be cut, clean out dead skin, and apply the tea tree oil, working it under the nail as much as possible.</li>

<li> : The essential oil of this Chinese Herb is widely used for its fruity, flowery fragrance.</li>
<li> Every - single - day, for six months, while the toe nail grew back in.</li>
<li> You should cut the nail back behind the dead, infected part in order for the product to work right.</li>
<li> It allows the tea tree oil to remain moist and active on the area being treated for long periods of time.</li>
<li> If you have a bad case, you will need to buy more than one bottle, since it will take about six months for the nail to regrow.</li>
<li> Came as expected.</li>
<li> It helps with a wide range of maladies.</li>
<li> I will not buy any tea tree oil product from any other vendor.</li>
<li> I have tried other brands but Tea Tree Solution For Nails</li>
<li> If your skin is exposed due to a cutback, you can brush it on.</li>
<li> Unlike most other base materials, PEG 200 does not support the growth of fungi and other microorganisms.</li>
<li> The primary constituent of this natural ointment base material is ethylene, which is usually made by the dehydration of alcohol or the collection of gases from ripening fruit.</li>
<li> Nail fungus takes a long time to treat, and nails grow slowly,</li>
<li> Particularly, I found it useful for an infection I had in two nails after a horribly botched manicure.</li>
<li> I previously purchased straight Tea Tree oil from this company, and was unhappy about the \\&quot;drippiness\\&quot; of the solution when used for toenails.  </li>
<li> Nothing worked &amp; I ended up cutting my toe nail too short one day &amp; it never grew back because of the fungus.</li>
<li> Use this every day and your nail fungus will disappear in a few weeks to a few months.</li>
<li> Purchase in small units</li>
<li> &amp; I&#x27;m sure that made it worst than what It was.</li>
<li> Slowly.</li>
<li> The treatment (to avoid the expensive and dangerous prescription option) involved a few holistic/OTC items applied several times a day for about 9 months.</li>
<li> did not notice this was the culprit for the bad rash for a long time,</li>
<li> Without such a base, the tea tree oil could evaporate before it had a chance to kill all of the fungi.</li>
<li> It was nasty, hard, and yellow.</li>
<li> Every single time I use this oil I have horrible rash.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a difficult one to overcome, but with patience of applying and cutting it off will work.</li>
<li> LA**SIL pills are dangerous.</li>
<li> and when it looks like its all cleared up keep using it another month killing a bad nail fungus is a war and can take a year  depending on how bad it is....</li>
<li> I now realized that putting the acrylic nail was the worst idea ever</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Using for Nail fungus but it is slow treating this fungus as are most products that are OTC.  To early to tell if it works completely</li>
    <li> This is a well packaged item for use on your nails if you have developed fungus. The brush works well . I brush it on and under my fingernails like I would mail polish. I do them between manicures, which I do myself. I have already seen a difference in a month. The new nailsl that are growing out are clear.</li>
    <li> A product that does seem to get the &amp;#34;funk&amp;#34; out. It does definitely dry out your fingers&#x27; and toes&#x27; tips only because its part of the healing process of ridding that fungus. It&#x27;s a difficult one to overcome, but with patience of applying and cutting it off will work. Wish there were something out there that worked faster and proficiently though. Would probably not buy again because i could make my own concoction in larger amounts.</li>
    <li> I give 3 stars Bacause did not cleare my nails</li>
    <li> Excellent product and finding results gradually .</li>
    <li> Came as expected. Hope it works as advertised.</li>
    <li> I am still using this product. It will take a good 6 months before I see any benefits but am very confident this will work.</li>
    <li> Originally got this for my boyfriends foot fungus issue, but he never used it. So I put it in a bottle of water and dish soap and fight my ant problem with it. Works great for that haha.</li>
    <li> WARNING! Thursday Plantation is NOT cruelty free. This company DOES test on animals!</li>
    <li> I discovered the wonder that is Tea Tree oil, when living in the UK. It helps with a wide range of maladies. Particularly, I found it useful for an infection I had in two nails after a horribly botched manicure. The treatment (to avoid the expensive and dangerous prescription option) involved a few holistic/OTC items applied several times a day for about 9 months. Was this a pain? Oh yes. But my nails are now healthy and tea tree oil/solution on my nails within that routine was KEY. It works better than anything your doctor can prescribe, without messing up your insides. If anyone is using this stuff for a similar infection, comment here and I&#x27;ll post a bit more info on how I got rid of it.</li>
    <li> I did see my smalls toes clear up but it just couldn&#x27;t help my big toes. Finally I went to the doctor and he prescribed La**sil pills, which made my hair fall out.  LA**SIL pills are dangerous. I tried prescription and OTC topical remedies and OTC&#x27;s like Tea Tree Solution is better than the prescription topical.  I will use Tea Tree Solution again if ever I need to. I will never have my nails professionally manicured again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s taking forever but it is working</li>
    <li> This stuff absolutely works but you have to be patient and follow a routine every single day. After washing, I would thoroughly dry the nail and surrounding area, cut back any nail that had grown enough to be cut, clean out dead skin, and apply the tea tree oil, working it under the nail as much as possible. Every - single - day, for six months, while the toe nail grew back in. It seems to take forever, then one day you realize your tow looks normal again!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and comes with an application brush.</li>
    <li> Every single time I use this oil I have horrible rash. It starts right on the spot I applied this oil after a couple of days then itchiness gradually expands to the surrounding areas.&lt;br /&gt;I did not notice this was the culprit for the bad rash for a long time, as when I used it I already had a seasonal rash and I used it believing it would heal it, while wondering why the affected areas always seem to get worse after application, but convincing myself it was not because of tea tree but the symptom was overwhelming the oil&#x27;s healing property.&lt;br /&gt;Then one day I had a drop of this oil on my healthy finger accidentally which I did not wipe straight away but smeared all over my hands as I thought it was good and antiseptic. Then 2 days later the rash started with itchiness and tiny blisters. I tried it again after several months to the toes and I had this rash again. So now I am 100% sure.&lt;br /&gt;I do not know if it is because of this product or I am allergic to the tea tree itself, though.</li>
    <li> very good  as expected .. .. . . .. .. . . .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ...</li>
    <li> I have been struggling with toe nail fungus since 2007. Nothing worked &amp; I ended up cutting my toe nail too short one day &amp; it never grew back because of the fungus. Decided to put an acrylic nail because I was embarrassed of having one toe with a tiny greenish nail that didn&#x27;t want to grow and fungus that didn&#x27;t want to go away. I now realized that putting the acrylic nail was the worst idea ever &amp; I&#x27;m sure that made it worst than what It was. I&#x27;ve become fed up with this fungus &amp; based on the reviews I decided to try it. I have been using this since October &amp; I can really start to notice a difference. My nail is finally growing. Slowly. But I see progress. Will definitely buy another bottle if I need to. Can&#x27;t wait until my nail looks 100% normal again!</li>
    <li> the essential oil off-gasses quickly. Purchase in small units</li>
    <li> best nail fungus killer I ever found but you got use it every day twice if you can and when it looks like its all cleared up keep using it another month killing a bad nail fungus is a war and can take a year  depending on how bad it is....</li>
    <li> I will not buy any tea tree oil product from any other vendor. This is the original, genuine Australian TTO, very potent and very oily. I bought some from Edens Garden, and I can&#x27;t use it. It is watered-down and does not work. This is the one you want. Also, this is the bottle you want if you are putting it on your nails. It will get the oil deep under your nail by osmosis. Just hold the brush at the nail line and you can feel it seep in. If your skin is exposed due to a cutback, you can brush it on. Good TTO tingles a bit upon application, and this is no exception. Use this every day and your nail fungus will disappear in a few weeks to a few months. If you have a bad case, you will need to buy more than one bottle, since it will take about six months for the nail to regrow. You should cut the nail back behind the dead, infected part in order for the product to work right. This is best performed by a professional groomer. She will be able to tell you how to care for your nail better than I. Mine took six months to grow back properly. It was nasty, hard, and yellow. Now it&#x27;s a normal-looking nail. I still have a bit of a scar under the nail as the whole thing was caused by stubbing my big toe. That will eventually fade with time. If not, I will have to have another cutback procedure.</li>
    <li> This really does work!  I have tried other brands but Tea Tree Solution For Nails Thursday Plantation is much superior.</li>
    <li> Love this product, after using for two weeks my nail fungus is almost gone..</li>
    <li> I previously purchased straight Tea Tree oil from this company, and was unhappy about the \\&quot;drippiness\\&quot; of the solution when used for toenails.  This, however, is the one they intended for nails, and the nail brush attached to the cap makes it very easy to apply.  Just like the straight solution, this one has a strong tea tree component - the smell makes toenails (and toes) smell fresher.  Nail fungus takes a long time to treat, and nails grow slowly, so I can&#x27;t speak to its effectiveness yet.  I am using this in combination with Terbinafine (Lamisil), a systemic therapy, since even Lamisil has only a 42-60% one year response rate.  Topical medications alone are usually not curative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to tea tree oil, this contains PEG-200, undecylenic acid, and litsea cubeba oil.  A more thorough description of the product&#x27;s ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;  * Melaleuca Oil: Tea Tree Oil. A natural antiseptic, essential oil, steam-distilled from the leaf of Melaleuca alternifolia.&lt;br /&gt;  * Litsea Cubeba Oil: The essential oil of this Chinese Herb is widely used for its fruity, flowery fragrance. Aromatherapists have historically used it for cramps, indigestion, liver pains, headaches, insomnia, migraine, nervous tension and stress. And it has been shown to have mild antiseptic effects.&lt;br /&gt;  * PEG 200: The primary constituent of this natural ointment base material is ethylene, which is usually made by the dehydration of alcohol or the collection of gases from ripening fruit. It allows the tea tree oil to remain moist and active on the area being treated for long periods of time. Without such a base, the tea tree oil could evaporate before it had a chance to kill all of the fungi. Unlike most other base materials, PEG 200 does not support the growth of fungi and other microorganisms.</li>
    <li> Working great on my toe nails! You have to use it daily. I use it morning and night. They are almost all better and SO happy! Not a strong scent like most these which I am glad!</li>
    <li> Great product and appears to work well.  Still using it on my toenails.</li>
