### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I&#x27;m very impressed with this product</li>
      <li>Happy brow growth!</li>
      <li>I bought 2 brow brushes which work exquisitely with the product.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
      <li>works great!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very happy to say that my brows looks a lot better than before!</li>
      <li>lol</li>
      <li>LOL</li>
      <li>It works great on my lashes too.</li>
      <li>According to the reviews, this product works great for some people, so maybe it will for you too.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy to flaunt the Lashes &amp; brows of my youth once again.</li>
      <li>All of the Skinactive products i have tried are great.</li>
      <li>you&#x27;ll be glad you tried this stuff!!</li>
      <li>Hope it continues  :o)</li>
      <li>would say itis a good product for the price and would recommend this product&lt;br /&gt;for</li>
      <li>i am very pleased with the product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using the KGF serum for lashes for months now with NO problems-I love it!</li>
      <li>arrived quickly and a very good price.</li>
      <li>You do not need to spend $100+ for effective beauty treatments.  </li>
      <li>the price was so great it was worth the try!</li>
      <li>They did, and I can honestly say they look better than before.</li>
      <li>SAS also has many actives for your face that are amazing and that also work.  </li>
      <li>Love this, love this, love this!   </li>
      <li>However, if you&#x27;re consistent, you&#x27;ll be happy with the results ... darker, denser brows.  </li>
      <li>They were in this condition for many years</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>Now, I have been skipping a day or two or more</li>
      <li>But I was able to use it on my brows.</li>
      <li>I have yet to find a growth serum that sprouts more than 2 hairs.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok to pluck the brows, just do it under where you want the arch to be, but keep that thickness. :)</li>
      <li>I love Skin Actives.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay.  </li>
      <li>:) You have to buy it.</li>
      <li>Within three weeks, the hair was coming in better but not quite fully recovered.</li>
      <li>I think this serum works more to condition and hold brows in place.</li>
      <li>Do see more hair growth in both my eye brows.</li>
      <li>It is not going to magically regrow all your lashes or brows</li>
      <li>Better if you use in conjunction with another, like I do.  </li>
      <li>The serum may have a smell but that will fade as it drys out working its magic.</li>
      <li>Now I feel confident to not hide away.</li>
      <li>Truthfully, I saw more results from combining castor oil with Vaseline.</li>
      <li>Billion Dollar Brows is pretty good,  but is over priced.</li>
      <li>This makes them look more full</li>
      <li>Then within a couple weeks I saw a huge difference in the thickness and length of my eyelashes.</li>
      <li>Im giving it two not one star because I have not yet finished the tube after 4 weeks, its relatively cheap</li>
      <li>there is an alternative product that works amazingly well but costs twice as much.  </li>
      <li>It is effective and reasonably priced.  </li>
      <li>but it was well worth the wait!</li>
      <li>Nothing to get excited about though.</li>
      <li>/&gt;While my eyebrows were already full, some areas were sparse and not alot of hair existed in those areas.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m still looking for something that really works &amp; is safe.</li>
      <li>In order for this to work you need to be consistent!</li>
      <li>My eyelashes are thicker and stronger and I rarely experiece loss or breakage anymore.</li>
      <li>And there are no dangerous chemicals.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>I am right there with you</li>
      <li>i had better response from my previous product, but i will continue and see if i get a better result.</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for the past 3 months and am happy with the results.  </li>
      <li>The one on the left is coming in more, but the right is coming along.  </li>
      <li>sometimes I do count) or more on the left!!</li>
      <li>I have been using this serum consistently (am &amp; pm) for about a month now and nothing has changed.</li>
      <li>So, I can definitely recommend this product. :)</li>
      <li>Simple to apply and works magic.   </li>
      <li>So I will buy some more to get those pretty lashes back!</li>
      <li>It really works!   </li>
      <li>and I think more hairs have grown back.</li>
      <li>every two days so the fresh skin at the brows can really soak up the product.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;ve never used an eyebrow/eyelash growth serum before, it takes up to 10 weeks to see results(it only took 6 weeks for my eyelashes to get to thier longest:).</li>
      <li>I have half a bottle left and still use it every night as I&#x27;m delighted with the results!</li>
      <li>My brows don&#x27;t grow fast as it is, but with this product, I was able to get my brows back.</li>
      <li>I read the positive reviews of this product &amp; decided to give it a go.</li>
      <li>If you get an eyeliner brush to apply the serum, you use less, the tube lasts longer and you get the same GREAT results.</li>
      <li>The brow on the left was always a problem but to see this much growth and a promising full eyebrow in progress is something to give this product two thumbs up for!</li>
      <li>My problem with brows isn&#x27;t loss, it&#x27;s now too much hair</li>
      <li>one thing I&#x27;ve been experiencing is my brows have not grown more than I expected.  </li>
      <li>This product really works.  </li>
      <li>I really think this has helped with my sparse brows.</li>
      <li>It is for eye lashes which also works very well.  </li>
      <li>a try and WOW!!!</li>
      <li>so there&#x27;s not as much growth where I pluck more often, but I can definitely watch new hairs grow in the middle of the brow.    </li>
      <li>After just a week and a half of using it, my eyebrows started growing in fuller and thicker. :)</li>
      <li>I would say that this growth of night-time application took about a month, more or less.</li>
      <li>I bought it mainly for my brows</li>
      <li>Also this product stings eyes really bad, the most of all I&#x27;ve tried (Jan Marini, Revitalash, MD Lash factor, Tarte MultiEye, and finally Lumigan, generic for Latisse-the best).</li>
      <li>S/H a tube, is kinda high for Cheap-n-Chic me)so</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>Plus I highly recommend taking multi-vitamins or fish oil to increase the results.</li>
      <li>or maybe I need to be a little more patient</li>
      <li>Lilash was one major expense that I was willing to pay for because it works.</li>
      <li>I actually lost a big bunch of lashes in my right eye, and had bold space for a couple of weeks.   </li>
      <li>I have fair skin and thin eyebrows.</li>
      <li>Between my two brows, the left was thicker while my right struggled to catch up, but now the two are exactly the same thickness, length, and size thanks to this stuff.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference as far as new growth of brow hairs.</li>
      <li>I went from a sparse five eyebrow hairs on the left and a decent(very)skinny eyebrow line on the right, all from 6-7 years of bleaching and over-plucking.</li>
      <li>Now, I&#x27;ve got an ALMOST full-slightly bushy brow on the right and an actual brow line with about twenty hairs (yes,</li>
      <li>Maybe it oils those brows for people with super dry hair follicles?  </li>
      <li>I think it would be better for this product to have regular applicator like other eyelash growing product</li>
      <li>/&gt;Fortunately I figured out what had killed my brow follicles and a good portion of my front hairline and am taking care of that problem separately, and sloooowly between this product and the other</li>
      <li>My aging eyelashes had become dry, brittle and broken, but I was happy to see that after a couple of weeks using this eyelash serum, the lashes are now stronger and longer.</li>
      <li>I certainly have not lost any hairs since starting to use it.</li>
      <li>It was a huge waste of money.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I followed the instructions and after 6 weeks of using this product there&#x27;s no change in the length or fullness of the eyelashes.</li>
    <li> I had used another product in the past and trusted the reviews and bought it. i had better response from my previous product, but i will continue and see if i get a better result.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d been using RapidLash to grow my eyelashes (which, BTW,works, but at $50.00 plus S/H a tube, is kinda high for Cheap-n-Chic me)so I thought I&#x27;d give the Eyebrow/Eyelash Serum w/ KGF a try and WOW!!!! it&#x27;s been 3 months, eyelashes are just as thick and LONG as they were using RapidLash!!! The only drawback to this product is the applicator...it&#x27;s too thick. If you get an eyeliner brush to apply the serum, you use less, the tube lasts longer and you get the same GREAT results. If you&#x27;ve never used an eyebrow/eyelash growth serum before, it takes up to 10 weeks to see results(it only took 6 weeks for my eyelashes to get to thier longest:). Use it EVERY night &amp; DON&#x27;T GIVE UP AFTER A COUPLE OF WEEKS...you&#x27;ll be glad you tried this stuff!!</li>
    <li> I use Latisse on my eyelashes so cannot speak to the efficacy there.   But it DEFINITELY works on eyebrows.  As I aged my eyebrows got thinner and lighter (blonde hairs emerging and a few grays as well ACK!!).  I tried \\&quot;tints\\&quot; and \\&quot;gels\\&quot; but they were visible if you looked closely.  Now I use this growth serum and dye my brows once a month (Dylash); my eyebrows now look like Brooke Shields circa \\&quot;Blue Lagoon\\&quot;.   Thick, dark, natural; don&#x27;t smear, clump or run in the rain. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Within about 3 weeks eyebrows where I overplucked starting coming in. The one on the left is coming in more, but the right is coming along.  In about another 3 weeks I saw my eyelashes (which are very curly at the base ) looking a lot more lengthy. When I applied mascara...I was amazed at how my eyelashes NEVER looked this long...even with mascara. 4 stars, because it burns if it comes in contact with the eye. Through use I&#x27;ve learned to combat that issue.    When applying make-up the highlight is putting on my mascara now.</li>
    <li> Product dried out my skin and did not enhance the growth of my eyebrows or eyelashes at all.  It was a huge waste of money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for approx 4 weeks, morning and night, and I haven&#x27;t seen any results. I had overplucked my inner eyebrows for years and have been trying to grow that portion out now for almost 2 years...I have yet to find a growth serum that sprouts more than 2 hairs. Ugh. Im giving it two not one star because I have not yet finished the tube after 4 weeks, its relatively cheap, seems to work for others, and maybe in the last 2 weeks a miracle will happen?</li>
    <li> I have used this serum for about 9 months and my lashes are definitely longer.  I use mascara because my lashes are blonde but I would not need to if my lashes were dark.  It is effective and reasonably priced.  You do not need to spend $100+ for effective beauty treatments.  All of the Skinactive products i have tried are great.</li>
    <li> Maybe it&#x27;s because my eyebrows got a little head start on their growth due to other products tried in the past, ie:   \\&quot;Billion Dollar Brows\\&quot; serum, \\&quot;Brow Gain\\&quot; from Damone Roberts, and Mavala Double Lash. Whatever the case, this is the serum that I am rooting for...with Mavala Double Lash being a close second. I went from a sparse five eyebrow hairs on the left and a decent(very)skinny eyebrow line on the right, all from 6-7 years of bleaching and over-plucking. Oh the torture! Now, I&#x27;ve got an ALMOST full-slightly bushy brow on the right and an actual brow line with about twenty hairs (yes, sometimes I do count) or more on the left!! The brow on the left was always a problem but to see this much growth and a promising full eyebrow in progress is something to give this product two thumbs up for! I would say that this growth of night-time application took about a month, more or less. Now, I have been skipping a day or two or more and you can tell when you do. It&#x27;s as if there is no visible growth the next morning if you don&#x27;t use it the night before. A tip that I would give to all my annoyed-eyebrow lining-brow powder-applying-folks would be to exfoliate the face (with extra attention to the brows...but not harsh) every two days so the fresh skin at the brows can really soak up the product. Happy brow growth!</li>
    <li> this product does work but dont apply to upper and lower lashes because i find when i do that my eyes water. so i just apply to the upper lashes.  if you stop using this product your lashes will go back to the same condition they were before.</li>
    <li> there is an alternative product that works amazingly well but costs twice as much.  I thought this would be a cheaper version, but I found the wand to be too thick to apply well and the product useless.  Spend the money on the more expensive product...it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> I was born with long lashes and brows but plucking, make-up, curling, age &amp; hormones depleted them. I have spent a lot of money trying to get them back. Lilash was one major expense that I was willing to pay for because it works. But just as you use something for a while, it can loose its effectiveness over time. I read the positive reviews of this product &amp; decided to give it a go. Starting at $9 bucks in comparrisson to the $140 for Lilash, what could I loose? To my suprise I got my thickness of both my lases and my browse. I am 33 years old people were mistaking me as a teen pregnancy.  I&#x27;m happy to flaunt the Lashes &amp; brows of my youth once again.</li>
    <li> This is a 5 star rating.  I have been using SkinActives Brow and Lash serum for a year.  It took a while, probably, 2 months for the product to work.  It has made my lashes longer and not as sparse.  I just started using it on my brows twice a day and I am regaining some eyebrows after 3 weeks.  This product really works.  SAS also has many actives for your face that are amazing and that also work.  Go to their website and check it out.</li>
    <li> I used this product almost every night for 3 months and couldn&#x27;t tell if it was working, so I stopped. Then within a couple weeks I saw a huge difference in the thickness and length of my eyelashes. So I will buy some more to get those pretty lashes back! I only wish the applicator was different like rapidlash.</li>
    <li> I love Skin Actives.  This product worked well for my thin (spaces) lashes, causing new growth to come.  They were in this condition for many years (I am now 61).  My problem with brows isn&#x27;t loss, it&#x27;s now too much hair so I haven&#x27;t used it there!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for the past 3 months and am happy with the results.  My eyelashes are thicker and stronger and I rarely experiece loss or breakage anymore. I will continue to use this product and hope that now that my eyelashes are growing back they will also continue to grow longer.</li>
    <li> I tried this product for several weeks.  It just didn&#x27;t work for me.  I would recommend the Ardell  as the fastest, cheapest and easiest to use.  Billion Dollar Brows is pretty good,  but is over priced.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t even use this on my lashes because it irritated my eyes. But I was able to use it on my brows. I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference as far as new growth of brow hairs. But I did notice that my existing brow hairs seemed thicker and stronger. Nothing to get excited about though. According to the reviews, this product works great for some people, so maybe it will for you too. It&#x27;s just not for me.</li>
    <li> Have only used for a month. Definitely have applied it once at night, but also applied it in the morning if I wasn&#x27;t wearing make-up that day. Do see more hair growth in both my eye brows. Hope it continues  :o)</li>
    <li> Disappointed. Did not look like the product I expected, did not perform like the product I expected. Will not order again. Contacted seller and was just told package had changed and picture had not. I don&#x27;t feel it was handled properly. My money should have been refunded no questions asked. Feel I was misled.</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum consistently (am &amp; pm) for about a month now and nothing has changed. I am right there with you Shirley - this product isnt working for me either.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a year.  I use it every night.  Simple to apply and works magic.   It took me about six weeks to grow my lashes long.   It really works!   Also,  I had a portion at the outer edge of my eyebrow that had stopped growing and because of this product it has grown back!  Love this, love this, love this!   Try this product,  you won&#x27;t believe the difference in your lashes!</li>
    <li> have to  s ee  the  result,so far  nothing-takes  time,wil  tel you  after  2-3  weeks</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not quite the miracle I was looking for, but if you have any hair at all it will make it grow longer, stronger, fuller.  If there&#x27;s nothing growing in the follicle though it won&#x27;t make it start growing hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately I figured out what had killed my brow follicles and a good portion of my front hairline and am taking care of that problem separately, and sloooowly between this product and the other I am recovering my brows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve tried this product and it didn&#x27;t do much for you, and it&#x27;s basically only your outer eyebrow that&#x27;s missing, beyond your arch, you might consider getting checked for thyroid problems.</li>
    <li> Too bad this doesn&#x27;t work, it&#x27;s so inexpensive. I paid $9.95. I used it faithfully for a couple of months at least. Nothing. Nada. I&#x27;m still looking for something that really works &amp; is safe.</li>
    <li> I have fair skin and thin eyebrows. Well, I used to. I used to use a pencil to try and fill them in but it never look truly natural.    Now, I never fill in my eyebrows with pencil. I can actually seek new growth of hairs in between the old ones.    I&#x27;m an overplucker (I admit it!) so there&#x27;s not as much growth where I pluck more often, but I can definitely watch new hairs grow in the middle of the brow.    It took about three weeks to see the serum start to work but it was well worth the wait!</li>
    <li> The smell is not pleasant and it is seperated in the tubej so it looks chunky. I did not see a difference with this product and the smell just turned me off from using it.</li>
    <li> I think this serum works more to condition and hold brows in place. After a few months though I did notice a few new hairs growing. It is slow and seems like the product is not working, but keep at it because it will work. It is not going to magically regrow all your lashes or brows but it will improve them at the very least. I will continue to buy this product!</li>
    <li> I use this serum to make my lashes stronger and not for length .  Better if you use in conjunction with another, like I do.  I would not recommend it for length, but would for a stronger lash.</li>
    <li> I use it for over a month, and don&#x27;t see any big difference. I actually lost a big bunch of lashes in my right eye, and had bold space for a couple of weeks.   I think it would be better for this product to have regular applicator like other eyelash growing product have (eyeliner type), instead of big, porous lip gloss applicator.   Also this product stings eyes really bad, the most of all I&#x27;ve tried (Jan Marini, Revitalash, MD Lash factor, Tarte MultiEye, and finally Lumigan, generic for Latisse-the best). I wanted something cheaper, but I won&#x27;t buy this Eyelash serum with KGF anymore.</li>
    <li> You won&#x27;t believe it, but I accidentally got Nair facial hair remover on my eyebrows this past summer. Oh my gosh! How stupid did I look? LOL Anyway, that afternoon, I began the search for an eyebrow hair growth treatment that would bring results. I found this one. Within one week, I at least had a faint but visible line of new growth across the brow bones. Within three weeks, the hair was coming in better but not quite fully recovered. I kept at it. By six weeks, my eyebrows were fuller than when I had the accident with the Nair. Not only that, my brows filled in where I previously had no hair growth! That was last summer, and now it&#x27;s September &#x27;09. I have half a bottle left and still use it every night as I&#x27;m delighted with the results! I really panicked when this happened because as a 48-year-old going through hormonal changes, I didn&#x27;t know if my brows would grow back! They did, and I can honestly say they look better than before. My brows don&#x27;t grow fast as it is, but with this product, I was able to get my brows back. What a relief! lol It works great on my lashes too. So, I can definitely recommend this product. :)</li>
    <li> exceeded my expectations...i am very pleased with the product. arrived quickly and a very good price. works great!  i reccommend it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been 10 weeks and I have seen quality results! I have been using this serum for my eye brows only (I overly plucked without thinking) I&#x27;m very happy to say that my brows looks a lot better than before! &amp; I&#x27;m a male. I&#x27;m very impressed with this product the price was so great it was worth the try! Now I have my eye brows fully grown back looking normal. Now I feel confident to not hide away. I will never touch my eye brows again! In order for this to work you need to be consistent! Plus I highly recommend taking multi-vitamins or fish oil to increase the results. The serum may have a smell but that will fade as it drys out working its magic. Thank you Skin Actives!</li>
    <li> I tried an expensive lash conditioning product and had a significant reaction, eye burning so bad I wanted to tear my eye out. $150 in the trash- never again! I&#x27;ve been using the KGF serum for lashes for months now with NO problems-I love it! You can&#x27;t lose by trying this product.</li>
    <li> Gave my thin brows a nice definition once they started growing out.  Since I don&#x27;t wear make-up, I keep forgetting to put this on in the mornings.  However, if you&#x27;re consistent, you&#x27;ll be happy with the results ... darker, denser brows.  The product does not come with a brush, so you&#x27;ll need to stop at Sally&#x27;s and buy some application brushes.  I bought 2 brow brushes which work exquisitely with the product.&lt;br /&gt;For the price, you can&#x27;t beat this serum.  And there are no dangerous chemicals.</li>
    <li> My aging eyelashes had become dry, brittle and broken, but I was happy to see that after a couple of weeks using this eyelash serum, the lashes are now stronger and longer. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I really think this has helped with my sparse brows. I am 47 and a natural redhead. Over the years my brows have gone away especially at the edges. This makes them look more full and I think more hairs have grown back. I certainly have not lost any hairs since starting to use it.</li>
    <li> Eyebrows have improved, but some areas are still patchy. I have over plucked my eyebrows for years and just feel like I might of reached the point of no return. Still using it every night though.</li>
    <li> Waste of time, waste of money, and this product did nothing for me at all.  Maybe it oils those brows for people with super dry hair follicles?  Regardless, I am extremely disappointed, because there is nothing out there that isn&#x27;t pricey that works.  Guess I will have to spend the money whether I want to or not...sigh.</li>
    <li> Tried this, and the concentrate, after my lashes and eyebrows had been falling out from stress. Does nothing at all. Truthfully, I saw more results from combining castor oil with Vaseline.</li>
    <li> I have prescribed Brow and Lash serum to a friend of mine.&lt;br /&gt;She had scanty brows and after using Brow Serum, for over a year&lt;br /&gt;others have noticed some thickness in eye brows. The process is gradual&lt;br /&gt;and need patience to see results.&lt;br /&gt;The container they are using is not practical, though. It may spill while&lt;br /&gt;extracting.&lt;br /&gt;I would say itis a good product for the price and would recommend this product&lt;br /&gt;for those who have scanty eye brows, but patience please.&lt;br /&gt;No comments for using on Eyelashes, because of the dispenser.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t work and was a total waste of money. I think i even lost some eyebrow using this product.</li>
    <li> After just a week and a half of using it, my eyebrows started growing in fuller and thicker. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While my eyebrows were already full, some areas were sparse and not alot of hair existed in those areas. However, I used this stuff while not plucking for at least two days. After those two days I noticed a dramatic change in my brow thickness! :) The space on the end of my right eyebrow that I thought would never grow back, is BACK! And thicker than ever! Between my two brows, the left was thicker while my right struggled to catch up, but now the two are exactly the same thickness, length, and size thanks to this stuff. :) You have to buy it. It&#x27;s ok to pluck the brows, just do it under where you want the arch to be, but keep that thickness. :)</li>
    <li> bought 3 of them they stained my eyebrow area dark brown making me look like I tried to dye my eyebrows my eyebrows did not grow at all tried for months nothing.I don&#x27;t pluck never have they just have grown to be thin and barely showing</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay.  I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day since I got it on 4/18/2013.  I bought it mainly for my brows and it does work, but one thing I&#x27;ve been experiencing is my brows have not grown more than I expected.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the product or personally how my brows grow.  Some parts of my brows have grown, but they are still spares in some areas.  I want to see my brows grow in fuller and faster.  This product is doing that, but not fast enough or maybe I need to be a little more patient and it might take mine a little longer, I don&#x27;t know.  I would recommend this product to anyone though.</li>
    <li> I finally got a prescription for Latisse.  It is for eye lashes which also works very well.  But I use it also for my eyebrows and it works there too!!  I tried other advertised products and none worked.  So save your money and just get Latisse.</li>
