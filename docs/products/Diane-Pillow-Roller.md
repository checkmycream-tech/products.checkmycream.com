      <li>These rollers are fine for what i needed them for.  </li>

      <li>I recommend purchasing them for the comfortable aspect alone.</li>
      <li>Enjoy</li>
      <li>Cheaply made.</li>
      <li>They are made  cheaply.</li>
      <li>They are light and comfortable.</li>
      <li>The satin material is smooth and snag-free, but the seam edges are beginning to unravel after two weeks of continued use.</li>
      <li>They curl my hair well, they&#x27;re comfortable, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about my ends because of the satin covering.</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t tangle in my hair and are about as comfortable as you can get with curlers.</li>
      <li>but walmart also has them you will enjoy them just roll snap and bend then</li>
      <li>This is the first time I was able to comfortably sleep in hair rollers and my curls turned out well.</li>
      <li>Get the original.</li>
      <li>Yes, some of the satin has already come apart at the seams after the 2nd use, but I&#x27;m so happy with how they work (when I leave them in overnight), that I&#x27;m willing to order a couple more sets (again the price is right) to keep using this.</li>
      <li>In fact, I really get 3 hairstyles a day most times.</li>
      <li>I myself prefer softer, more gentle curls; however, if you prefer tighter curls, these may work well for you.</li>
      <li>I just love these rollers they work very well</li>
      <li>They make a very nice, tight curl and are super easy to use.</li>
      <li>These are super easy to use, and are pretty comfy.</li>
      <li>Wake up take them out and my curls are tight and beautiful.</li>
      <li>The ends could hold up a bit better but overall, I was pleased with them.</li>
      <li>There were many high reviews on this</li>
      <li>If I am short on time, I use a curling iron then wrap the warm hair around these rollers and leave them in until the curls cool.  </li>
      <li>I have to use a lot because my hair is mid-back length, but they are worth it.  </li>
      <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
      <li>I love to curl my locs (they are just over two years old).</li>
      <li>I read reviews that said they fall apart pretty quickly</li>
      <li>Hair slides right off.</li>
      <li>If you want a better constructed roller and you don&#x27;t mind paying a little more, than there is another set made by Goody</li>
      <li>the are soft easy to sleep in too.</li>
      <li>The only good things I can say about these curlers are that they are soft, as advertised.</li>
      <li>You really can sleep on them without feeling like your head is in a vise!</li>
      <li>After first use a couple of the rollers had the seam unraveling and a wire exposed.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll never use  hot rollers again.</li>
      <li>These rollers are great for my short hair (nape length when stretched).</li>
      <li>I have the same rollers in cotton they stay on much better, I use them when I desire a tighter curl.</li>
      <li>Maybe I should try elmer&#x27;s glue next time!!:)</li>
      <li>They were exactly what I thought they would be.</li>
      <li>They work nice because they do not seem to tear your hair the way other rollers do, I would recommend them to anyone.</li>
      <li>The internal metal twists are easy to manipulate and work</li>
      <li>I wish they made them a large size</li>
      <li>Pure comfort and all curl.  </li>
      <li>Downside ~ they are very cheaply made, expected at this price.</li>
      <li>By mid-day to afternoon, its just a little curly with a nice wave.  </li>
      <li>gentle on hair.</li>
      <li>Rollers are not made very well, but I knew that going in.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Good product, excellent value.</li>
    <li> I put these in an night, sleep in comfort and no damage from curling irons or flat irons. Downside ~ they are very cheaply made, expected at this price. After first use a couple of the rollers had the seam unraveling and a wire exposed. I love these rollers, just need to find a better quality.</li>
    <li> I just love these rollers they work very well</li>
    <li> There were many high reviews on this but I found they make you hair kinky and frizzy.  I went back to rods.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> They are already tearing apart.  Have had them two weeks.  These are not strong quality.</li>
    <li> After continued use wires will come thru</li>
    <li> I put these in overnight to get some extra volume at the crown.  Worked great.  Would not recommend for hair shorter than 3&amp;#34; as the covering is made of satin and will slide out.  Recommend spritzing hair with water or spray gel before putting them in, the water helps them stay put better.</li>
    <li> I love these rollers but I had to give them a 3 because I can&#x27;t choose 3 1/2 and 4 is too high. These are great for retaining moisture in ethnic hair and they are just fabulous to sleep in! Yes, they may not hold up too well because of the quality but for that price it is to be expected. If you want a better constructed roller and you don&#x27;t mind paying a little more, than there is another set made by Goody that looks pretty good.</li>
    <li> I rated as like because they come unsewed after a few uses.I still use them cause,the body is great. I have 4b naturalhair. I get my hair pressed&amp;curled. Any hair type can use these. I purchased similar ones from my local walgreens(they where wht satin&amp;get soiled) I wanted black. Its just a matter of learning how style hair inexpensive.</li>
    <li> I have seen these on other females hair and I thought it would work.  The quality of the material and the wire did not work well.  The wire came through on 5 rollers the second day.  If the workmanship of the rollers were better this would have been perfect.  It indeed curles the hair and very tight.  Wish I could find another maker of this product</li>
    <li> Works well to smooth waves and add nice curls.&lt;br /&gt;Would tell others to buy this.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping cost may be too high though.</li>
    <li> okay. I have the goody rollers and these are basically a knock off.  Get the original. This particular brand is not made of good materials. I don&#x27;t recommend unless you can&#x27;t find the Goody brand</li>
    <li> Awesome soft rollers! They are light and comfortable. A little too silky to use with dry hair but the curl was soft and manageable. Great deal!</li>
    <li> These were poor quality. Wires began poking through satin fabric almost immediately making them useless.</li>
    <li> I have been using these type rollers for years.  I have long - almost mid-back length by now, fine-medium type hair, and just 4 or 5 of these rollers for a few hours, or the easiest way is overnight,-- and I have curls all day.  In fact, I really get 3 hairstyles a day most times. In the morning, its pretty curly--I just hold it a little back with some barrettes, if its too curly at first.  By mid-day to afternoon, its just a little curly with a nice wave.  And then by evening to late evening, its very wavy -- to wavy.  All without any hair spray or gunk! Love them!</li>
    <li> The satin material is smooth and snag-free, but the seam edges are beginning to unravel after two weeks of continued use. I had hoped the quality of these pillow soft rollers were more durable than what&#x27;s available in my local drug store, but sadly they&#x27;re not.</li>
    <li> I am african american/indian/white; I believe providing this helps othesr like me decide whether to purchase certain products for our type hair.  I bought these to try them out and discovered I should have had these years ago...I have to use a lot because my hair is mid-back length, but they are worth it.  My hair has so much body, I can roll them on wet or dry hair and it does not pull on my hair like other rollers and I can wear them all day and sleep in them all night, which is a wonderful treat.</li>
    <li> They are very nice I like the items we received we receive them very quickly thanks again the are soft easy to sleep in too.</li>
    <li> love these satin rollers. gentle on hair. comfy to sleep in. very inexpensive. i recommend. buy it now. great investment,.</li>
    <li> These are so short, without anything to grip the hair while trying to roll it. I should have purchased the cotton ones instead.&lt;br /&gt;They would have been better, but they are still short and hard to work with. Maybe I should try elmer&#x27;s glue next time!!:)</li>
    <li> yes these do curl and leave moisture in your hair but they are cheaply made started to fall apart with the second use. if anyone could point me in the direction of some higher quality rollers that would be awesome.</li>
    <li> I rated them as &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t like&amp;#34; because when I ordered them in the past I thought it was something I did wrong because the seams of all 3 packs of 10 rollers I purchased came loose at the seams.  So, I thought I would try them again but the same results occurred.  I only had them a few days before the seams came apart.</li>
    <li> These rollers are great for my short hair (nape length when stretched). They came in excellent condition. I only used them a couple of times but they are maintaining well. Also there is a money back guarantee on the back of the packaging&lt;br /&gt; (from the manufacture not Amazon.com) so hold on to your invoice.  Its  valid for six months from the purchase date. So that&#x27;s comforting.&lt;br /&gt;My package arrived&lt;br /&gt; about five days after ordering. Very comfortable to sleep in also.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use these rollers often however when I do, they are amazing. They curl my hair well, they&#x27;re comfortable, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about my ends because of the satin covering. I have had to throw a few away but they&#x27;re affordable so buying another set won&#x27;t hurt my pockets. Great buy! :)</li>
    <li> Great product! I ordered these for my Mother. She love them and couldn&#x27;t find them anywhere :-)</li>
    <li> I have long, naturally curly (frizzy on humid days) hair. These help in taming my locks a bit and I can sleep in them without discomfort. The ends could hold up a bit better but overall, I was pleased with them. They don&#x27;t tangle in my hair and are about as comfortable as you can get with curlers.</li>
    <li> These are super easy to use, and are pretty comfy.</li>
    <li> I wear roller sets sometimes and  these soft rollers are perfect for\\&quot; in between\\&quot; days, they do not curl natural hair for your \\&quot;first day\\&quot; sets, not enough tension, they are soft like pillows. The quality is very high, I did not notice ANY ripping or tearing of the edges, also these stay in place because there is a thin wire that bends inside and that is why they will not curl 3C to 4C hair for your initial set from straight hair (after washing and drying), but they will maintain a style. Other texture hairs I am sure it will curl it. I like them and glad I bought them. Impossible to find in black in the stores.</li>
    <li> Rollers are not made very well, but I knew that going in. They were exactly what I thought they would be.</li>
    <li> For the price, these are amazing. I read reviews that said they fall apart pretty quickly so I bought an extra 10 pack. I hadn&#x27;t done my hair in curlers before so these were a great no risk purchase. They are great and are very comfortable to sleep in. I&#x27;d recommend them. I&#x27;m deducting one star because the satin covering has started to come undone on a few of them after about 6 uses.</li>
    <li> This gives natural looking curls without frizz or damage.  The curls last longer than when I use foam curlers, and they hold even if I don&#x27;t use product.  I am avoiding using heat on my hair, so heated curling irons, or curlers are not an option for me.  I&#x27;ve never gotten so many complements as after having used these satin curlers.  I already promised to order a set for a coworker, which is okay since they&#x27;re inexpensive.  Yes, some of the satin has already come apart at the seams after the 2nd use, but I&#x27;m so happy with how they work (when I leave them in overnight), that I&#x27;m willing to order a couple more sets (again the price is right) to keep using this.</li>
    <li> Ohhhh let me count the ways.  Pure comfort and all curl.  For me I do 3 braid-outs on my 3b curly hair and I tip the last 3 inches of my hair by rolling them up with these fab curlers that are a dream to sleep in.  They leave no frizz what so ever and the curls last and last as long as you set the hair damp &amp;#34;not wet&amp;#34; either with a water spritz or setting lotion.  You won&#x27;t regret it.  Enjoy</li>
    <li> Pretty worthless! This flimsy rollers don&#x27;t hold shape and slide out of my hair. I&#x27;m a Black American, and usually I don&#x27;t have problems with my rollers falling out due to my thick hair texture.  Also, because the roller shape doesn&#x27;t hold the curls are all inconsistent in tightness and size. The only good things I can say about these curlers are that they are soft, as advertised. I barely feel them when sleeping at night. So, unless you are quite tender-headed, go for a more sturdy roller.</li>
    <li> These are nice expect the wire comes out the ends after a while. Quality should be updates and even pay more.</li>
    <li> I use pillow curlers because they are soft and I don&#x27;t like to lose any sleep so these are great. I use Pillow curls for braid outs along with mixed chick or cashmere curls product when my hair is wet and I braid it and put the pillow curlers at the end to keep them in place then I put a satin sleeping cap on and go to sleep. Wake up take them out and my curls are tight and beautiful. You can also wash then if they become dirty. I  soak them in a mild detergent and let them air dry.</li>
    <li> These rollers help my long hair hold the curl for days. If I have the time, I wrap my hair while it is still barely damp and wait for it to dry.  If I am short on time, I use a curling iron then wrap the warm hair around these rollers and leave them in until the curls cool.  They work perfectly.</li>
    <li> I like the idea of these rollers. But they don&#x27;t hold up well. The satin material comes apart. And the wiring underneath gets exposed.</li>
    <li> These rollers arrived quickly, and I was very excited to try them. The rollers are the standard length you would expect from pillow rollers, and they generally feel like they are high quality. Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but the silk-style cloth was far too slippery. I found myself losing my grip on them as I rolled them, and I often found that I had to start over three or four times to get a solid amount of hold. The internal metal twists are easy to manipulate and work well once you get a tight enough grip against the curler itself to keep it from slipping. In using them, I often find myself winding up with tighter curls than I like because it is essential to roll the hair tightly in order for it to hold. I myself prefer softer, more gentle curls; however, if you prefer tighter curls, these may work well for you. I also would have liked for them to come with some sort of container or bag for storage, as it&#x27;s a bit of a hassle corralling them into one place.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mother a while ago, and she told me that she liked it but she doesn&#x27;t see herself using it a lot. She complained and said the satin rollers kept coming out.</li>
    <li> Seller was prompt i really like these roller and also you can sleep softly with theses in your hair doesnt bother you at all feels like a extra pillow and they also gave me the curls that i wanted for my hair got to order me another pair but walmart also has them you will enjoy them just roll snap and bend then and they stay seal for your curls next day!</li>
    <li> These are so easy to use and my toddlers don&#x27;t even mind sleeping in them beautiful curls too.  They also work by misting and blow drying your hair with them in</li>
    <li> I loved these rollers. This is the first time I was able to comfortably sleep in hair rollers and my curls turned out well. I recommend purchasing them for the comfortable aspect alone.</li>
    <li> I love to curl my locs (they are just over two years old). These curl my locs without hurting my head. They also allow the hair to dry without drying it out! Fab!</li>
    <li> I like the rollers but they don&#x27;t last long at all. They are made  cheaply.</li>
    <li> I have very thin, fine hair and it couldn&#x27;t possibly be any straighter. I wanted to try to put some wave or curls in it. I tried some hard curlers and couldn&#x27;t get the things to stay in with the type of hair clips that came with them. Also, very uncomfortable to sleep in. I just got these yesterday and put them in just now. So far, NOT impressed. Never used these kind before and no directions. I tried folding the metal pieces over but they wouldn&#x27;t stay closed so used them like twist ties on a bag of bread. Talk about looking like a DORK! They are a real pain to get in. Hair slides right off. By the time I was half done, my hair was completely dry except at my scalp. Once done, I have hair sticking out in all directions. Oh.. and my hair is long. Down to my beltline. So, now I&#x27;m off to take a nap before work and  hoping like crazy my hair will look WAY better than it does right now. Hate the frizz I see using these!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Just took the curlers out. Look like Medusa &gt;-(  Got ringlet type curls at the bottom of the hair. By the scalp it&#x27;s still straight since the curlers refused to stay tight against the scalp. Some didn&#x27;t take at all so have straight mixed with wavy ringlet frizzed out mess :(  Not happy with it. At all.</li>
    <li> They work nice because they do not seem to tear your hair the way other rollers do, I would recommend them to anyone. I plan to purchase more.</li>
    <li> The rollers were a little flimsier than I expected, but they do the job . they are very comfortable to sleep in. Definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> So simple to use! I will never use a curling iron again!</li>
    <li> These rollers are fine for what i needed them for.  Only gripe i have, is that i have never used this type of roller before, and there were no instructions included on how to use them (for first time users) . So i will just have to use trial and error i guess. Other than that they&#x27;re just fine.</li>
    <li> The rollers are just okay.  They fell off easily and started to come apart after using them twice.  Although, they were easy to sleep in.  We did get a few nice curls from some of them.</li>
    <li> very good product for permed hair.no hair breakage.once you get use to using these rollers.you will see longer lasting curls.plus very comfortable to sleep in.this product is another hard to find product.</li>
    <li> ordered two packs having high hopes they would work for my shoulder length thin hair. the &amp;#34;clips/clamps&amp;#34; on the side are weak and don&#x27;t keep closed tight enough to keep the roller in. After these failed, I ordered &amp;#34;wrap, snap and go rollers&amp;#34; and those work like a charm. I&#x27;ll never use  hot rollers again.</li>
    <li> Very comfortable to sleep in and have found that they adjust well for tight or loose curls, depending on what I want. I&#x27;ve started using these over sponge rollers all the time due to comfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One roller has started to split a seam, but I really expected that (had read other reviews saying as much was going to happen sooner or later). I couldn&#x27;t find these in stores, so I&#x27;d be willing to pay the higher Amazon Prime price to order again despite the short life expectancy just because they work well and sleep well.</li>
    <li> They are large, work well for a large, loose curl. I use on my locks and feel like I&#x27;m sleeping on pillows.</li>
    <li> The Satin Pillow Rollers are great for the days you want to wear your hair curly and they do not break or damage your hair.</li>
    <li> I like that these rollers have the satin covering on them but I got a complete afro from them as suspected. The reason why is because you have to wind them tightly or they don&#x27;t stay in. I may use these in the future when I am doing an updo or throwing my hair up because it would be neat with the heavy curls in it. I wish they made them a large size so it wasn&#x27;t such a small curl!</li>
    <li> Along with bendy/snap curlers, these are the best curlers ever!  You really can sleep on them without feeling like your head is in a vise! They make a very nice, tight curl and are super easy to use.</li>
    <li> The roller did exactly what I expected, a nice tight curl with no uncomfortable pins or brushes on my head. I have a very sensitive scalp and cant stand anything in my hair when I sleep. These rollers were like sleeping on a pillow.</li>
    <li> These work well enough initially; but after a couple of uses they start fraying, and coming apart and the wire pokes through the material. Cheaply made.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m relaxed and I brought these for the ends of my braidout and twistouts at night. They are comfy and they won&#x27;t dry the ends out because they are made of satin.</li>
    <li> I have the same rollers in cotton they stay on much better, I use them when I desire a tighter curl.</li>
    <li> Use pillow rollers everyday.  I just wish the ends wouldn&#x27;t  come undone.  It happens with all brands . The cost is very good and fast shipping.</li>
