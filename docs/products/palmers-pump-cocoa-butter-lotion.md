<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> So yes I am in fact a guy, to get things started, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that I can&#x27;t desire to have softer and smoother skin. Let&#x27;s be real though, ultimately softer and healthier looking skin is more attractive and more beneficial to your physical appearance in the long run. Just by using this lotion alone once a day, for the past week, I would say the overall feel of my skin is definitely noticeably smoother and softer. Even the ole&#x27; kneecaps and feet remain smooth throughout MOST of the day, but I find that sometimes I do have to reapply once more before I retire to bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically this lotion gives you the moisturizing benefit of something similar to Vaseline, without the extra greasy feel and shiny look afterwards. Not to mention it has a very light fragrance that dicipates within ten minutes or so after applying, but it definitely DOES NOT leave you smelling like you&#x27;ve been completely submerged in cocoa butter lotion. So any fragrance from a body cologne or spray that you may want to use afterwards will be unaffected by using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply put this is an all around great fragrance free lotion for both women and men alike if you desire to have softer and smoother skin. Very highly recommended.</li>
    <li> It used to be hard to find this lotion.  Now I can get it locally but I like the fragrance free version.</li>
    <li> this is a nice lotion - goes on quickly, not greasy, and a little goes a long way.  Great price too.</li>
    <li> The best for winter skin.  I use it every night.</li>
    <li> GIVE DRY, UNCOMFORTABLE SKIN A TREAT WITH PALMERS COCOA BUTTER FORMULA.  ENRICHED WITH VITAMIN E IN A SOOTHING EMOLLIENT BASE, THIS UNIQUE MOSTURIZER HEALS AND SOFTENS ROUGH DRY SKIN.  USE OVER ANY DRY AREA FOR SMOOTH AND SILKY SKIN RESULTS.  AN EXCELLENT ALL OVER BODY MOISTURIZER AND AFTER TANNING BUTTER.  ALSO AVAILABLE IN FRAGRANCE FREE FORMULA.</li>
    <li> I am in a wheelchair and my hands are always dry.  My mother asked for fragrance free \\&quot;butter\\&quot; lotion for her Christmas stocking so I got this product  After wrapping 2 of the 4 bottles I decided to try some on my hands.  Long story short, I liked this product so much that I kept two for myself.</li>
    <li> I used this lotion throughout my pregnancy.  It was the only thing that stopped the itching and dry skin.  Best perk is no stretch marks!</li>
    <li> Palmers Cocoa Butter is one of the great lotions, but they&#x27;ve redesigned the pump and, well, it just does not work.  There&#x27;s no other way to say it.   We are still ordering the lotion, but we have to recycle the old pumps to get the lotion to come out when we use it.  Soon, our old pumps will fail and we will have to stop using Palmers.    Sad.</li>
    <li> My wife has extremely sensitive skin and this is the only product that she uses. I have it on constant delivery. Its a great product.</li>
    <li> My mom had 3rd degree burns and was in burn unit for 3 mos I had been using this lotion myself for years was really surprised when the drs told me that this was the only lotion she could use . You can barely tell her neck face chest etc was ever even burnt !!!</li>
    <li> I love Palmer&#x27;s products. My purchase will be with the fragrance instead of fragrance free.</li>
    <li> This Fragrance Free lotion is the only lotion my husband will use.  It is difficult to find in stores.  The price and delivery were great and I have a happy husband...and that is really great!</li>
    <li> This is an odd product. What attracted me was the fragrance free part. Surprise, they do add color to it so it is not completely free of all artificial stuff, it has a dye in it. It does smell funny. I wish they had used a more refined cocoa butter. Other than the smell it works great, absorbs quickly, and will no set off my migraines because of perfume. For that I am very happy.</li>
    <li> This was such a good deal, however it does smell a little weird? I can not wear the stretch mark scented cocoa butter because of allergies so I ordered these. The scent does not smell good when you apply it but quickly fades and doesn&#x27;t give me any problems with my allergies. Overall good purchase and would recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this cream because it has all the benefits of the regular Palmers cream withoit the smell, which is very helpfull because Im pregnant and the less things smell the better.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Cocoa Butter formula in bulk. I didn&#x27;t realize that it was fragrance free. I was looking forward to the scent. Otherwise, it moisturizes well enough.</li>
    <li> if i buy these individually at the store, they are around $8each. buying them in a pack like this saves me tons. Palmer&#x27;s makes good cocoa butter lotion and keeps my skin smooth all day.</li>
    <li> Incredible and affective moisturizer! Love the scent of cocoa, not fragrance. Sad that it contains mineral oil.</li>
    <li> The lotion is VERY nice. It makes my hands feel nice and soft, and I like to use it after a shower on my arms and legs. It is not quite fragrance-free; the fragrance is mild and pleasantly chocolate. My cat loves to smell it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was my original review:I saw the other two reviews that said the pumps did not work on the bottle but assumed the problem would have been fixed, since the reviews were almost 2 years old. It hasn&#x27;t. I now have 4 bottles with non-working pumps. I tried to see if a pump from another bottle around the house might fit, but this bottle does not seem to be very standard.&lt;br /&gt;Here is my update: Since I liked the lotion so much I decided to keep using it by shaking the bottle until some lotion poured out. This is NOT easy, because it is VERY thick. It has been about a week, and this morning I unthinkingly pumped the pump.It worked!! My theory is that the lotion&#x27;s thickness makes it very difficult to \\&quot;prime\\&quot; the pump, but it seems to be fine now. So my advice is to be patient and shake it a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, I give the Palmer company itself VERY poor marks for customer service.I sent an e-mail the first day I had the problem, but it has not been acknowledged.</li>
    <li> I have very painful chronic plaque psoriasis. This is the ONLY product I seem to get some relief from. I would highly  recommend it since it is frangrance free and contains a great moisturizer. Only problem is pump is not that good but product worth it.</li>
    <li> Allergic to too many scented items and hard to find a truly unscented high quality product.  very satisfied with product quality and breathable.</li>
    <li> My skin loves this non-greasy lotion which has almost no smell. In the winter my back doesn&#x27;t itch when I use this lotion. I wish it were easier to find.</li>
    <li> I have used Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter since I was a child, but when I ended up with a terrible case of psoriasis it really helped a lot. My dermatologist was hard pressed to let me continue to use my lotion until I brought it to her and she read the label and found that it truly was &amp;#34;Fragrance Free&amp;#34;. I will tell you that it does have a smell, but it is the light and pleasant smell of cocoa. The lotion is so thick that I seldom use the pump, instead I store the bottle upside down and squeeze to get it to come out of the bottle. It being so thick that a little bit goes a long way. I sometimes even have to remove some when I am over zealous as not to get it onto my clothing.</li>
    <li> Very thick and lovely light cocoa smell. More of a cream than a lotion. Love it.</li>
    <li> I am happy to have found this lotion. I&#x27;ve tried so many, including far more expensive versions, but this is the one that works for me and my dry skin.</li>
    <li> I only use this product.</li>
    <li> I love the Palmer Cocoa Butter lotion because of the chocolatey smell. I didn&#x27;t notice when I ordered this that it was a fragrance free version but the fact I wasn&#x27;t paying attention isn&#x27;t the products fault or Amazons so I kept it, it has a very slight fragrance but I&#x27;m not sure how to describe it. It works as well as the naturally scented version but the Willy Wonka aroma is missing...</li>
    <li> I only use cocoa butter on my body, and I love it.  I am very thankful for finding this product at a price that beats my corner beauty store.  I added up the numbers and I do save $7.96.</li>
    <li> I have probably gone through 50 bottles of Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter Lotion in my lifetime. I&#x27;ve never found anything (including expensive face and hand creams) that works as well all&lt;br /&gt;over my body, including my face and hair-- yes, this stuff makes a great leave-in hair conditioner for thick hair! It&#x27;s thick and luscious without being slimy. BUT, as I&#x27;ve gotten into my 40s, I&#x27;ve found the classic Palmer&#x27;s scent overpowering instead of appealing. It&#x27;s very chocolate-cookie-ish and just too sweet, especially when I use it close to my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t been able to find the fragrance-free version anywhere but Amazon. It&#x27;s a godsend. The exact same formula, but this time the scent is extremely mild and inert... Just a slight touch of natural cocoa butter on first sniff, quickly fading to nothing at all. This won&#x27;t clash with perfumes or other products at all. Try it if you&#x27;re scent-sensitive.</li>
    <li> discovered this works as well if not better than some of the more expensive boutique items for triple the cost</li>
    <li> I love this lotion! It has a light fragrance to it, similar to cookies (my kids love it). I have used a full bottle already during this pregnancy. It seems to be the only lotion that eases the itching from the skin stretching.</li>
    <li> I have widespread eczema and have spent the last several years trying lotions expressly formulated to deal with the itch and rash. Nothing, no matter how many dermatologist approvals are cited has worked as well as Palmers. I have been buying it locally but from now on I&#x27;ll take advantage of Amazon&#x27;s prices.</li>
    <li> Works great all year round. My kids love it... although they ask why it doesn&#x27;t smell like a pina colada like the other cocoa butter lotion.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. Great mild scent and great moisturizing ability. It seems pricey but a little goes a long way. Yes it has parabens but anything good usually does.</li>
    <li> I use this every day and have noticed a definite improvement in my older skin.  As for the thickness in the cooler weather (not so much right now), I put it in the microwave for a minute or to until is softens, then I add either the Palms Cocoa Butter &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; or Sweet Almond Oil and shake it very well.  It loosens it up and allows it to dispense easier not to mention that the Palms Oil and/or Sweet Almond Oil actually help it stay smoother and absorbs into the skin a little deeper.</li>
    <li> The order was timely but the product was not as expected.  With all four bottles, the pump did not work.  With a lotion bottle this size, when the pump does not work its a pain to use.  The lotion also does not smell right, as if this batch has gone bad.  I&#x27;m usually a fan of Palmer&#x27;s but this particular order is not good.</li>
    <li> best lotion for dry skin!  my derm recommended for the kids and now i use it too.  thick and rich and takes care of itchy dry skin</li>
    <li> recommend by a friend&lt;br /&gt;Claims to remove/reduce age spots&lt;br /&gt;used 2&#x27;c/day for 21/2 months&lt;br /&gt;so far no difference</li>
    <li> All the benefit of cocoa butter without the smell. I always feel moisturized and smooth.</li>
    <li> I have a disease that causes chronic severe dry skin, and Palmers is one of the only lotions on the market that works all day long. I have tried many expensive lotions, but Palmers is the best. I use the unscented, but it still has a mild natural scent to it. However it is not overwhelming like I find the original scent to be.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fragrance free, so instead of the yummy cocoa smell you may be expecting, it&#x27;s a gross cocoa smell... but otherwise this is great! I am pregnant and put it on my tummy after every shower, and actually the stretch marks I used to have seem to be faded, and no new ones have appeared yet!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for quite a few years for my body lotion.  It helps manage my dry skin and really doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or sticky after use. I also use the thicker cocoa butter cream for chapped lips.</li>
    <li> Ordered a four pack and have had no pump problems with two of the four so far. Still has a light- wonderful- natural cocoa butter smell, but not the sickly, sweet over powering of the scented one.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this lotion for his dry skin and hands.  Smooths in easily, no fragrance and truly does the job!</li>
    <li> Product is excellent but this is wrong bottle for product this thick. Pump on bottle is useless. Product won&#x27;t pump and won&#x27;t pour and bottle is too firm to squeeze out product. I had to cut off top to get to the butter easily.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Use it twice a day!!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff and at an awesome price too, the value pack will keep me good for a while.</li>
    <li> Great Lotion for a great price. I use it all the time and my skin feels and looks great.</li>
    <li> Spouse loves it. The 4 pack is way more efficient than going to a big box store frequently. S&amp;S is nice for this as well.</li>
    <li> Wife loves this stuff and I can get it cheaper here on amazon. Only drawback is I think plamers is getting cheaper with their pumps because they seem to stop working after a couple uses.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not scented, but for four bottles, it&#x27;s worth it. My only problem is that the pumps did not work, luckily I had an empty bottle of Palmer&#x27;s lying about and replaced it before discarding it.</li>
    <li> My moused coco butter when I was a kid and the other kids called her the cookie mom because she smelt like chocolate chip cookies.  I love what coco butter does for my skin but I don&#x27;t want to small likes cookies.  With the scent less coco utter I don&#x27;t!  I add essential oils to a newly opened bottle and I can small like whatever I choose and have a great moisturizer.  I have recently been adding lavender oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is also wonderful moisturizer. I have extremely dry skin especially in the winter due to thyroid disease. This is the only lotion that is heavy enough to prevent flakey skin.  I have tried other brand and generic varieties and nothing compares to Palmer&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Love it!! I cant seem to find the unscented in stores anymore. Thank god I can find it on amazon. I love the scented one too. But unscented is good for when your going out and want to wear a sexy scented perfume. The scented tends to mix with other scents. Palmers brand is the best lotion ive found for a reasonable price. Makes my skin silky smooth and I get lots of complements. I reccomend this product to anyone. Even if you have sensitive skin. I do and I never had issues. Its great for after tanning, after a bath or shower , dry winter skin. I use it everyday religiously!</li>
    <li> The lotion is fragrance free and good.  The bottles don&#x27;t always want to pump, though.</li>
    <li> It smells too strong!!  I don&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> yummy. doesn&#x27;t have that sickening smell afterwards and lasts until the next shower. ................ . . . . . .</li>
    <li> Great all over lotion, after sun, after shower....leaves skin soft and not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Added benefit the vitamin E, smooths and heals.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. I use it everyday. Keeps me from being dry and has an awesome smell that does not over power you.</li>
    <li> Palmers is easy to find in the stores, but the Fragrance Free isn&#x27;t always available.  I love how it works, and with this particular product I don&#x27;t have to smell like cocoa beans all day.  Good price on Amazon too!</li>
    <li> Used this all throughout my twin pregnancy, the unscented is great stuff.</li>
    <li> The scent is kind of weird and doesn&#x27;t smell nice at all but it at it is doing it&#x27;s purpose</li>
    <li> I have purchased a lot of different lotions over the years and Palmer&#x27;s is clearly one of the best on the market. A lot of the lotions today are either saturated with too much perfume, or feels extra thin and watery when applied. That is not the case with Palmer&#x27;s. Their cocoa butter lotion has substantial thickness, while being only lightly perfumed with the natural cocoa butter smell. It is silky smooth in its application, and lasts all day. A great purchase for those of us with dry skin. I recommend this great product.</li>
    <li> Disappointed....thought it would be more therapeutic to the skin.</li>
    <li> great for moisturizing very dry skin.</li>
    <li> I got one bottle at local store. What do you think?...No.., pump doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;The fix was quite simple. I unscrewed the top, unplugged the straw, washed it under the hot water stream.&lt;br /&gt;Put everything back together. Ooh la la!&lt;br /&gt;Looks like this butter get thicken over some period of time or under colder temperature.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> The pump does not work, and the fragrance-free is scented. This was not true in the years before when I used this product. I can&#x27;t use this stuff now. The company shows no attention to its product.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion, the only problem is that it is thick and very hard to get all of the product out of the bottle.  However, my dry skin stays very moist.  So, there is a trade-off.</li>
    <li> Great lotion!  Leaves skin feeling smooth!!  Smells so yummy!  Great value!</li>
    <li> So when I opened my first one, I was greeted by a lot of effort trying to get it to pump lotion.  I eventually gave up and moved onto the next one, which dispensed normally.  Not too big of a deal considering it was a four pack, but I would have been pissed if I had bought one and couldn&#x27;t drain the contents into another vessel.</li>
    <li> I was very happy to have found this lotion at a better price than I&#x27;ve been paying.  I&#x27;ve been using it since ghe eighties and it will remove/blend marks.  I recommend this seller.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion! Best price I have found! Leaves my skin softer and smoother than any other lotion. Love the fragrance free.</li>
    <li> This product is great for dry skin folks like us.  We use it as our Summer lotion so that we still have great moisture without the heavy grease feel.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best moisturizers I&#x27;ve ever used.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the regular Palmers has an annoying chocolate smell.  However, this fragrance free version is perfect.</li>
    <li> Weird Smell! Smelled like chemicals.</li>
    <li> Good, thick and goes further -  better than many other brands.</li>
    <li> love this lotion even though it says fragrance free it smells just like the original  to me</li>
    <li> Got it at a great price.&lt;br /&gt;x&lt;br /&gt;x&lt;br /&gt;x&lt;br /&gt;x&lt;br /&gt;x&lt;br /&gt;x&lt;br /&gt;x&lt;br /&gt;x&lt;br /&gt;x&lt;br /&gt;x&lt;br /&gt;x&lt;br /&gt;x&lt;br /&gt;x&lt;br /&gt;x</li>
    <li> This is a great deal if you LOVE Palmers Cocoa Butter, but make sure that you take notice that this is UNSCENTED!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a bunch of these and didn&#x27;t realize that they were without fragrance until I was about to use them.  If you are one of those people who doesn&#x27;t like added perfumes/scents then this is right up your alley.  For someone like me who likes scents then this is going to be very lackluster.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad to see I wasn&#x27;t the only one having problems with it dispensing. I went to the second bottle and had the same problem. I finally just unscrewed the cap and got what I needed from the bottle. I also noticed the weird smell that soon faded as the product was worked in. Hopefully with the mentioned fixed this will work out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this for some time now and it is a great product. I really love it, I think it&#x27;s the best body cream on the market</li>
    <li> I like the original cocoa butter product pretty well but the scent wasn&#x27;t great to me so I tried the fragrance-free.&lt;br /&gt;This one is worse - it smells like chemicals were used to cover the cocoa butter.  Original better in that regard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product works just the same though - effective moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product!  My dermatologist recommended it, and I would recommend it, too.  This was a great deal - much better price than buying at a local drug store.</li>
    <li> I have been using this lotion for years every day and it has made a huge difference in my skin. I will continue to wear it and buy it from amazon.</li>
