      <li>and afterwards my hair is really soft and manageable.</li>
      <li>I like the texture and the smell, its not strong smelling or sticky  nor does it leave a thick residue, its great to grow damaged hair roots.</li>
      <li>it doesn&#x27;t make my hair shed as much, but I also notice when I sit under the dryer with it my hair sheds more than if I would have not used the dryer which is weird because dryers are suppose to make the conditioner penerate deeper into your hair.  </li>
      <li>I have thick coarse hair,however it is healthy and shiny.</li>
      <li>I really like DOO Gro deep down conditioner, it moisturizes, conditions, and cleans your hair.  </li>

    <li> Very good product! I definitely recommend it! Thanks!</li>
    <li> I really like DOO Gro deep down conditioner, it moisturizes, conditions, and cleans your hair.  I like using it on my hair because I noticed when I use it,  it doesn&#x27;t make my hair shed as much, but I also notice when I sit under the dryer with it my hair sheds more than if I would have not used the dryer which is weird because dryers are suppose to make the conditioner penerate deeper into your hair.

    <li> This didn&#x27;t work for my dogs but I do know the silky breders are very happy with this on that paticular breed.They wrave about this product, I think it&#x27;s more for a single coated dog.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It always leaves my hair soft and shiny!!</li>
    <li> I have thick coarse hair,however it is healthy and shiny.This product coated my hair and made it look dull! After I shampooed my hair, I put the Doo Gro Deep Conditioner  on it and sat under the dryer for 15 minutes.Never again! I washed it out with shampoo a day later and my hair felt and looked so much better!</li>
    <li> My daughter&#x27;s curly hair gets incredibly tangled when I use this. Don&#x27;t waste your money if you have curly hair! Used twice and never will again!</li>
    <li> works like it should, and i would advise you to buy it because its really good on hair. love it</li>

    <li> I love this stuff. The first time you use it, it makes you hair incredibly shiny and smooth. I will be using this for a long time.</li>
    <li> really good for my hair and it is longer than ever before. Big plus this product makes your nails grow strong too.</li>
    <li> It does what it says.  I had breakage from a relaxer gone bad and I bought the Doo Gro products as part of my hair restoration project! LOL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It worked and I am back with healthy hair and will use these products from now on.</li>
    <li> I swear by this stuff!!! I first purchased it at a Sally Beauty Supply Store in early 2013 and have been using it ever since. I use it every time that I wash my hair which is once a week. After I wash and condition my hair I put this on it and leave it in for 2 hours with a plastic cap on and afterwards my hair is really soft and manageable. It is especially a lifesaver when I am between relaxers because I only get 2 a year and this is what helps me tame my hair while I am stretching. I also noticed my hair growing faster after I started using this deep conditioner. I tried other products when I ran out of this and nothing got it done like my doo gro so this dc will be a permanent staple in my hair care product collection for a long time to come.</li>
    <li> I like the texture and the smell, its not strong smelling or sticky  nor does it leave a thick residue, its great to grow damaged hair roots.</li>
