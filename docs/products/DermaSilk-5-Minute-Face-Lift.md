      <li>i recieved this product quickly and it always work just great .</li>
      <li>Great stuff and worth every penny.</li>
      <li>It appeared that although many did not like the texture of the serum the results of a 6 and 12 week study proved it was quite effective.</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t have to put very much on to see and feel great results.</li>
      <li>Made my forehead look great but made me look older around mouth when I smiled</li>
      <li>So glad I found this item.</li>
      <li>It does work immediately and from my understanding it is not designed to work \\&quot;over time\\&quot; like most age defying products</li>
      <li>but i just love it.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t expect to fool anyone about my age; I use it because it makes my skin feel and look better.</li>
      <li>then most I have tried.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll continue to use it for awhile until I can find  another product that can deliver better.</li>
      <li>but i love it.</li>
      <li>The longer you use it the better the results.</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for years and love the results.  </li>
      <li>You do get better results using this twice a day, morning and night.</li>
      <li>Be sure to apply BEFORE any moisturizer and make up.</li>
      <li>Gives my face that added boost -- giving it a firmer, more youthful look.</li>
      <li>I find that it absorbs into my skin better if I apply a moisturizer on top of the DermaSilk immediately.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>and I can be glad that there is no fragrance.</li>
      <li>I love this.  </li>
      <li>After reading many reviews and looking at many products I decided to try the Dermasilk.  </li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>However, it seems to work better on the face than on the neck .</li>
      <li>I am an example for my daugher and grand daughters.</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t like a facelift or a huge difference, but a nice tightening.</li>
      <li>The content need to be more fuller.</li>
      <li>I have tried many others but did not receive the results I have with DermaSilk.</li>
      <li>I have found that coconut oil works better.</li>
      <li>This product is Fabulous!  </li>
      <li>It makes the customer a lot more satisfied, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>Will not use it any more.</li>
      <li>I always put a bit of powder on top.</li>
      <li>It drys yours skin and even seems to make your wrinkles more pronounced.</li>
      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>The product now comes in and easy to use squeeze tube, which is better than the depressor bottle.  </li>
      <li>It is definitely true, the more days you use it, the better the results.</li>
      <li>am almost finished my first bottle and plan to buy more :)</li>
      <li>Thais is a watered down version of what used to be a superb product when it was available in a pump bottle .</li>
      <li>Argan is wonderful, why did I mess with it?</li>
      <li>I started noticing I needed something to give me a little lift and tried this product and am very happy with the results.  </li>
      <li>So far it&#x27;s the best thing I have used for my 74-year old neck.  </li>
      <li>This is so light</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Used product, not new as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;Very, very, very disappointed!</li>
    <li> My 82-year-old mother likes to use this before going out to smooth her wrinkles I guess it works very well for her.</li>
    <li> recommended by my plastic surgeon</li>
    <li> When I first used this, I received compliments on my skin. I was told it was &amp;#34;glowing.&amp;#34; However, with time and continued use, not only do I not see any difference, but what seemed to be such a positive initial effect seems to have disappeared.</li>
    <li> This is a good product that works well. I have used it in the past and purchased it at retail stores. I was happy to see it at a better price but was disappointed that the pump did not work. I now have to put a Q-tip in the bottle to use it. Too much of a hassle to return it and go through that whole process. Not sure if I will take a chance again with this product.</li>
    <li> The serum does work; your skin does feel tighter after 5 minutes. But, you really need to let a whole 5 mins go before applying any moisturizer or makeup.  It feels good, but I&#x27;m not sure if there is a visible difference.  I&#x27;ve been using it everyday for a month.  Again, not any visible change in my facial skin, but you really can feel the serum tightening up your face, neck and forhead.  I&#x27;ve even used it at night.</li>
    <li> Other products out there much cheaper.</li>
    <li> To start, I am 31 years old and smoked for the better part of the past 15 years. I acquired many wrinkles from my poor health choice. I quit smoking and wanted to try to at least mask some of my wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product about 6 months ago with the thought that it would be a temporary fix and less painful than botox. To my surprise it has not only masked my wrinkles but improved the overall appearance of my skin. My wrinkles went from moderate to just fine lines and completely gone in some areas, even when I am not wearing the product.&lt;br /&gt;One problem that a lot of women have said that it leaves a flaky, nasty residue on the skin. Unfortunately, I found this to be true. However, it you apply a good moisturizer after the Dermasilk dries (about 30 seconds) it is flawless! I use it in combination with Olay revitalift 18 spf. Also minimizes the tight feeling.&lt;br /&gt;Many people are amazed when they find out how old I am. It really does take 10 years off the look of your face.&lt;br /&gt;I am almost finished my first bottle and plan to buy more :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle. I use it under my make up when I go out. And I&#x27;m 78. It does make a difference</li>
    <li> I use this everyday in the morning and can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference but I can notice a slight difference.  I&#x27;m 67 and nothing out of a bottle will really work but using this with their other products I can tell a difference but nothing major.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a year because I like how bright my complexion looks and that it tightened my sagging skin over time. You do see a tightening of the skin after 5 minutes, but after several months you will experience a permanent improvement with tighter more lifted skin. It contains snail serum. There are over 1000 different medical journals published about the regenerative effects of snail serum. It builds the underlaying structure of the skin called the extracelluar matrix. It does work over time, trust me.</li>
    <li> The cream is excellent, but you cannot use a lot of it. Only use a small amount and it does reverse the sign of wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Gives my face that added boost -- giving it a firmer, more youthful look.</li>
    <li> Very bad , did nothing</li>
    <li> This product is exactly what I was looking for. It tightens the skin and leaves your face looking fresh all day long, and works as a primer under a make up.</li>
    <li> After reading many reviews and looking at many products I decided to try the Dermasilk.  I compared it to a Clinique serum I had used for a long time but became less available.  There was no satisfactory comparison: Dermasilk didn&#x27;t look or feel like a skin correction.  My face felt and looked dry and tight although I used it for several days.  In addition there was a scent which I am very sensitive to. There was no appreciative difference in price.</li>
    <li> Face facts ladies. The only thing that works is in the hands of a plastic surgeon.I have spent a fortune in buying products to take years off. This product does work for a few minutes until you smile, then your face cracks, however it works better then most I have tried.</li>
    <li> Big, big disappointment.I do not believe their claims that you can can see a 5 minute face lift.  It&#x27;s not going to happen.  I should like to have my money returned it is that bad.</li>
    <li> Using this product as well as other Dermasilk products has really helped tighten my chin and jaw line.  I also spread it over my cheeks to reduce the flab and puffiness.  With make up and some contouring I can see my cheek bones!  It&#x27;s not a replacement for a face lift but at 59 yrs old it is working enough where I don&#x27;t feel I have to get any plastic surgery done.</li>
    <li> 1, It makes your wrinkles look WORSE. It dried up like egg whites and sort of cracked, making lines look even deeper!&lt;br /&gt;2, The amount you use does not make a difference. I tried using the teensiest amount, thinking I just used too much. No go. It looked awful too!&lt;br /&gt;3, It leaves a film over your skin that rubs off like the gum used to hold price stickers on glassware. I had to clean it off in order to apply my make-up!&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Frownies\\&quot; help smooth things down but the effect is temporary. At least you don&#x27;t deepen your frown lines while you sleep.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what to suggest -- put your pennies into a piggy bank for a face-lift, filers, thermage, botox, etc. or start face exercises and skin peels to minimize what is inevitable.</li>
    <li> DID NOT SEE ANY DIFFERENCE, AND WHEN APPLIED ON FACE  IT FORMED A WHITE  LAYER IN MY FACE WHEN IT DRIED UP</li>
    <li> You do feel the tighness, but that is all it does.  This product does not smooth out any wrinkes and it does not lift your face. It drys yours skin and even seems to make your wrinkles more pronounced.</li>
    <li> Have used this for 8 years or so. Use it every morning. Love it</li>
    <li> First time use dermaSilk, I does help conceal lines around eyes, face &amp; neck. Not sure the small amount in bottle vs. price.  After applying and dry then you use regular creams and a small amount of make up. I&#x27;ll continue to use it for awhile until I can find  another product that can deliver better. For those unhappy there is no miracle creams or products, lets face age with grace or try botax or plastic surgeon for younger results.  As far Amazon as usual great service!  AW</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years and love the results.  I am saving quite a bit by ordering it through Amazon compared to Department and Drug Stores in my area. This is why I shop online at Amazon.com</li>
    <li> Thank you , fast and as described</li>
    <li> No noticable difference after using this product. It makes the skin feel dry and tight, so you would imagine something was happening but no visible change. If you use too much it can look flaky on your skin. A lot of money for no results!</li>
    <li> Since our skin absorbs a good percentage of what we put on it, I was curious about what \\&quot;Helix Aspersa\\&quot; was. Type it into your search engine. I&#x27;ll wait. Yep, it&#x27;s snail secretions. A SNAIL TRAIL for firming your face.  No, thank you. Even the tiny snail is a creature that doesn&#x27;t need to die for my vanity. I&#x27;m returning this, and going back to organic argan oil. Argan is wonderful, why did I mess with it?</li>
    <li> I had seen so many ads for this claiming this was a great product and a drugstore clerk had recommended it. This  product does absoutely nothing. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I have been using Derma Silk for years and sadly can no longer buy it at my local drug store.  It is a wonderful product that has kept my face wrinkle free.  I always get compliments about my &amp;#34;youthful looking&amp;#34; skin and am often asked what my secret is to my beautiful complexion.  The product now comes in and easy to use squeeze tube, which is better than the depressor bottle.  This is truly an amazing skin care cream.</li>
    <li> I think that this product has possibilities but suits a younger skin rather than a mature skin</li>
    <li> Did not see ant difference</li>
    <li> Listed that it was good for dry skin, but made my skin drier. I have found that coconut oil works better.</li>
    <li> This product is Fabulous!  I am 44 years old, with fair combination skin.  I started using this product about a year ago, and gave it 3-6 months to work because I read a great review saying it might take that long.  It&#x27;s true, I mean reading these reviews how long did these people give it?  You did not just have a face lift, it will take time be patient..the benefits are worth it.    Good Luck!</li>
    <li> A friend told me about this product and she let me try it before putting on my make-up for my daughters wedding. VERY IMPRESSED!! This is an excellent product.</li>
    <li> I would not start my day or leave the house without DermaSilk 5 minute face&lt;br /&gt;lift under my make up. I love it!</li>
    <li> I tried it and it didn&#x27;t do a thing to improve my wrinkles.  I don&#x27;t have very deep wrinkles so it should have worked as they claim.  But it didn&#x27;t do anything.  I was better off just wearing regular makeup.</li>
    <li> The best skin firmer I&#x27;ve ever used .</li>
    <li> For some reason cannot find this product in stores, hopefully still being sold?  It is such a lightweight face treatment and it does seem to make my skin look and feel better.  Would like to know where I can purchase this treatment?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for 3 months and can&#x27;t say as I see any difference.  I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
    <li> Been using it for years. Happy with product not thrilled with new packaging--Much more waste with the tube</li>
    <li> The photo shown is NOT what I received.  I expected a nice pump, but got an awkward tube with a very large opening.  Very disappointed, as you should receive what you ordered.  I almost think I got a box of old product, and the photo is the newer version of it.  I love this stuff, as it really does work well.  I definitely would have preferred the pump over the tube though.  Please send the exact item people pay for.  It makes the customer a lot more satisfied, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
    <li> Received the item in different packaging ( got the tube instead of the pump). The tube seems to be at least  half empty.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about a month and can see a difference in the wrinkles...they are not as deep as they were...would buy again..</li>
    <li> Dermasilk Face Lift is wonderful. Igoes on clear and last all day. It is great for your eye lids too. I would recomend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> it works  a little  I do not recomend this product</li>
    <li> Great product for eyes and wrinkle&#x27;s.  I use daily around the corner of my eyes.  Use lightly due to heavy use will cause flaking of the product.</li>
    <li> I have used this before and It is worth the High price to me. immediately it starts to tighten the wrinkles around my eyes from excessive rubbing from the allergies I have in the area.</li>
    <li> I do like it except sometimes it leaves a tight dry patch</li>
    <li> I cannot praise this product enough. I look 15 years younger..</li>
    <li> I see a bit of firming. Nothing dramatic.  I did not expect miracles.</li>
    <li> Love the product!  Was slightly frustrated when receiving the product as there was included a smaller bottle of their skin smoother, but the bottle was without a working pump, and there is no way to extract the lotion from the container!</li>
    <li> I can see a slight difference in my appearance after applying it.  The results are not startling or long-lived, but worth using it for an occasion when one thinks appearances are very important.  Probably would not refill the order.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t lift, just peeled off my face</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m almost 70 years old and have sagging upper eyelids, a line on my forehead, crows feet, and lines around my mouth.  This product really does temporarily lift my eyelids, the only product I&#x27;ve found in this price-range that does.  (I haven&#x27;t tried any serums that cost hundreds for 1ounce).  It also makes a noticeable difference in the other problem areas I mentioned.  I find that it absorbs into my skin better if I apply a moisturizer on top of the DermaSilk immediately.</li>
    <li> I am 63 years old and have used many products over the years at very different prices. I positively recommend this for anyone, especially maybe a little older women. I am amazed at this product great qualities. I use it along, I no longer use a foundation for the day. I still use my blush, eye makeup, and lip color but no foundation. I feel that I could reapply mid-day if I was so inclined, but it is not necessary.</li>
    <li> Have tried several off the shelf brands from the local drug store and saw this one on Rachel Ray a while back. Derma Silk out performed them all. It did work for me, however; some people have not cared so much for this product. If you follow the directions on how to use it, you will get results. Apply over CLEAN skin. Do not over apply. A little goes a long way. Be sure to apply BEFORE any moisturizer and make up. You do get better results using this twice a day, morning and night. You can sleep with it on. The longer you use it the better the results. This is not a dramatic facelift product, so a full facelift result will not happen and should not be expected. What you will experience is a firmer, smoother appearance of the skin. Lines about the eyes virtually disappeared within  minutes on my face. I am 56 years old and it has taken years off my face. Just follow the instructions as directed. I am very pleased with the product and would recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> the person who recommended Dermasilk was an aesthetician.  she said it really works.&lt;br /&gt;I used it for several months and think it is probably a good product.  However, it is very expensive.  the packaging is very deceptive.  there is just a thimbleful or so of product in the container  -  an ounce perhaps, but in a six-ounce container.  .&lt;br /&gt;It is no longer carried in our Walgreens and they cannot tell me why it was discontinued.  perhaps it was just too price-yp</li>
    <li> This dermasilk 5 minute face lift is a gyp! For 15 minutes you think it worked,tii the first time you spoke,After you smiled or eat, then you look just as you did before. It has no tighting power &amp; as soon as its thoroughly dry it disappears! Try Sudden Change 5 minute under eye lift instead. Follow directions and 5 minutes later slightly pat wiyh fingers, &amp; all lines,&amp; bags are gone for 12 hrs. Have used for 12 years &amp; its less than half the price!</li>
    <li> Buy this product, it works!  But ... buy it on Amazon, best price ever!  You will not be disappointed if you use it right.  I receive3d my purchase before date indicated.  I love this stuff!!!</li>
    <li> it does tighten and firms the skin,but don&#x27;t expect a real lifting affect.it will do until we ladies can afford a facelift.</li>
    <li> It is definitely true, the more days you use it, the better the results. Now it is just natural, after shower or washing my face, I pump 2 drops on my fingers go over my face and done and getting dressed is about five minutes, so then I do my moisturizer and makeup. I am 62 and it is important I look good to myself. I am an example for my daugher and grand daughters. Just because you are older, doesn&#x27;t mean you can&#x27;t look good.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I start out my makeup routine every morning by first putting on the 5 minute face lift, followed by my moisturizer, then my coverup.  It really gives a lift to sagging skin and helps with wrinkles too.  I continue to purchase it and hope they never discontinue.</li>
    <li> a little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> This product does what it says. My face and neck are tighter and my skin looks younger.</li>
    <li> So glad I found this item.</li>
    <li> Really great, firm skin, really works</li>
    <li> So far it&#x27;s the best thing I have used for my 74-year old neck.  GOod for the face as well.</li>
    <li> Made my forehead look great but made me look older around mouth when I smiled</li>
    <li> Friends and family saw a definite improvement.</li>
    <li> THIS works great!  (Much better than the &amp;#34;Diamond&amp;#34; product that looks really similar, but costs five times more!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product  for several months.  \\&quot;Your face looks tighter.  You look great.  What are you doing? Are you losing weight?\\&quot;  are common responses.  And the results really do last for hours.  It won&#x27;t make you look twenty, but it will make you look your best.  I use it every day.  Don&#x27;t judge it until you&#x27;ve used it for a month or two.  Use over time does seem to have a cumulative effect as the packaging states.</li>
    <li> It really is a wonderful product and I am very satisfied with it. The content need to be more fuller.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after reading a stellar review from an unbiased consumer testing group. It appeared that although many did not like the texture of the serum the results of a 6 and 12 week study proved it was quite effective. Loving anything that can slow down the progression of wrinkles I thought I would give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;1. I don&#x27;t know if I can truly say that it makes that much difference in a 5 minute period, however, I have been using this twice a day for two months now and I will say there is an obvious difference in the appearance or lack of appearance of wrinkles around my eyes and on my forehead. Due to this simple fact I don&#x27;t think there would be anything that would stop me from continuing to use this product.&lt;br /&gt;2. Although I did not find the texture of the serum to be off-putting, I can say that the smell is a bit odd. Good thing it only last for a short while and I can be glad that there is no fragrance. My face tends to be sensitive to fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;3. This product does not replace anything you would normally use in your facial regimen. It states in the instructions that you use it before your moisturizer so don&#x27;t think you will get to replace something that you already use if it is working for you.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it is well worth a try. I am a 44 year old mom and grandmother who loves to spend time in the sun and if I can find something non-surgical or not requiring injections that will help my wrinkles, I am all for it.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect to see much of a difference in my skin, but I have had more friends commenting on my &amp;#34;youthful&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;glowing&amp;#34; appearance than ever before--something that didn&#x27;t happen even when I was using high-priced salon products.</li>
    <li> Dont&#x27; expect a miracle transformation; however,  it&#x27;s a good product.&lt;br /&gt;Likely will not purchase again though I am glad I tried it.</li>
    <li> The product is remarkable as it does do the job of tightening and erasing wrinkles for an indefinite period of time .However, the pump did not pump but I used a pump from my previous bottle.</li>
    <li> Awful product.  Does nothing but leaves a residue on your face that starts flaking off.  I tried to return it.  My drugstore that I bought it from does not carry it anymore.  I got nothing but rudeness from their contact people.  Who do I contact for a return.  Nobody should buy this product!!!!!</li>
    <li> Very nice product, which I bought on recommendation from a friend. It does have a slightly odd smell at first, but that lasts only a minute or two. I did NOT have \\&quot;flaking.\\&quot; My face did look and feel taut, which is a good thing. Putting on a little moisturizer after five minutes cures the dry-skin feeling, but does not affect the smooth, wrinkle-free look. I follow directions, except that I put it on the entire face and neck while my skin is a little moist from washing, and I spread it with damp fingers (the 2 pumps-worth). After it dries, I use another small pump to reapply to eye and mouth areas. Great stuff and worth every penny. I buy it on Amazon for less than twenty dollars each. Two full size (single shipping price) for $32.49. You can&#x27;t beat that! I have had a cumulative effect: my skin texture seems smoother and the pores much less noticeable. I noticed this, when I went away for a few days and forgot to take the product with me. I don&#x27;t expect to fool anyone about my age; I use it because it makes my skin feel and look better.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product. It does work immediately and from my understanding it is not designed to work \\&quot;over time\\&quot; like most age defying products so I think people need to be aware of that.  I think over time it does have the potential to produce some good results but the product is designed to work immediately...while you are wearing it...sort of like a bra if you know what I mean...LOL.  I am 40 years old, have very oily skin and large pores.  I started noticing I needed something to give me a little lift and tried this product and am very happy with the results.  I even feel it minimizes my pores to some degree while I am wearing it which means my makeup looks smoother.  In the morning, I apply the DermaSilk, them my oil mattifier and then my foundation...and that works very well for me. At night I use something that is designed to work over time and produce results that are more long term.</li>
    <li> It does not give any sort of \\&quot;lift\\&quot;.  It leaves a grainy like coating on the skin.  I cannot see that it helps in anyway.  Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Thais is a watered down version of what used to be a superb product when it was available in a pump bottle . What arrived was in a tube -nothing close to the original 5 minute face lift</li>
    <li> I love this product, you know it works when someone thinks you are 10 years younger than your age. When you apply it, you immediately feel your skin tightning, it goes on smooth and a little goes a long way. I&#x27;m on my second bottle now. You can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> I definitely see a subtle firming. Sometimes I use it again if I am going out for the evening. It isn&#x27;t like a facelift or a huge difference, but a nice tightening.</li>
    <li> This is so light and it moisturizes without heavy feel. I have used it for years I don&#x27;t use it every day but it does work for quick result.</li>
    <li> I have not used this product long enough to give a good appraisal for it.  I will put more later, when I have used it for a while.</li>
    <li> I love this.  It&#x27;s light and not greasy, but helps firm up my face.</li>
    <li> This product is great! Within a couple of weeks other people were definitely noticing the difference.  Skin feels and looks firmer.</li>
    <li> Wonderful skin product  been using it for years  good price</li>
    <li> The product does a very good job. However, it seems to work better on the face than on the neck .</li>
    <li> i recieved this product quickly and it always work just great . i really lifts my face. it make it not look tired look i have.&lt;br /&gt;i do not know why . some friends do not like it. but i just love it. people tell me they see a different in my face.&lt;br /&gt;may some faces work and so do not. i am not sure. but i love it.</li>
    <li> I have used it for 60 days and it has done nothing for me! I wish I could return it and get my money back the sad part is I paid full price and purchase them each at $40. :(</li>
    <li> It does what it says.  Instant skin tightening.  Also good for acne. It&#x27;s cleared up my face.  And it makes a wondeful primer for makeup.  Foundation goes on much smoother with this under it.  Overall, i would never be without this product!</li>
    <li> I think there are no miracles in those cream products, every face is different, and some those work for some. But that doesn’t mean it’ll work for you. and if you’re certain it’ll help you you’ll feel terrible afterword’s like I felt . So just take it easy and hope for the best results and if this isn’t the one maybe you need to do some research to find the one that will do the job for you. I’m looking now for a good face cream I hope to find one soon.</li>
    <li> This is a case of a &amp;#34;very little goes a LONG&amp;#34; way... I have read several reviewers stating they put this product on their skin and it did nothing but the skin white. This is an example of using TOO much product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have bought this product in the tiny tubes at the local drugstore for $10 for a .25 ounce amount. That would last me at least a month. I use it twice a day on my forehead, eye area, around my smile area and my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of the very few products (at a cheap cheap cheap price point) that actually works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you are turning your face white or feel a build-up, you have used too much.</li>
    <li> I thought I&#x27;d give it a try for my sagging neck and used the complete bottle . Guess what ! No difference . Don&#x27;t waste your money !!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for some time and really like the way it firms my face.  The prices here are the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> I have dry skin and therefore more wrinkles at age 64. I have discovered DermaSilk products and all their products are wonderful. I use the 5 Minute Face Lift in the morning before my Skin Perfect moisture and at night before the Night Repairing Face lift, all DermaSIlk products. The 5 Minute Face Lift is great and I would recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> I just received today.  It does tighten immediately as stated.  Time will tell if there is a long term improvement.</li>
    <li> Works at least as well as other much more expensive products and gets an A+ for packaging. You can see how much is left and the plunger action lets you get to the last drop.</li>
    <li> DONT BELIEVE THE HYPE.I HEARD GREAT THINGS ABOUT THIS ITEM,AND I WAS TOLD IT WAS WORTH EVERY PENNY.IT WASN&#x27;T EVEN WORTH THAT.IT FELT AS IF I HAD EGG WHITE UNDERNEATH MY EYES.</li>
    <li> I first bought this product on clearance at Walgreens. I used a small amount every morning and immediately noticed an improvement. I wanted to be sure that what I thought I saw was real, so one morning I only adopted it to one half of my face. I waited a few minutes, and I could definitely see a difference, so I then out it on the other side. If I had any left on my fingers after applying it to my face, I rubbed it into my left hand. Over time I could see the apparent age gap between right and left hand increasing.&lt;br /&gt;Fir those of you who may not be seeing the results you had hoped for, I would recommend the side by side comparison.&lt;br /&gt;I ran out of this product several months ago. My actual age has been creeping back up. I didn&#x27;t realize how much until a friend saw a picture from 5 years ago, and told me that picture has to have been more than 5 years ago. I&#x27;m ordering another bottle right now. I want my tighter, less saggy skin back.</li>
    <li> I have been using DermaSilk for 6 months.  I am so delighted with this product.  My skin is firmer, smoother and young looking.  I highly recommend &#x27;seasoned women&#x27; try it.....I am 64 and am extremely pleased![[ASIN:B0012M8CD2 DermaSilk 5 Minute Face Lift, 1 Ounce]]</li>
    <li> I found this product to work without makeup, when using makeup you better not smile or your wrinkles get deeper and looks like you have more, I would not purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> I have never used this product before. I have tried many others but did not receive the results I have with DermaSilk. It firmed my skin the very first time I used it. The firming lasts as well. I use it once a day and have excellent results. I cannot say enough about this product.</li>
    <li> They changed the bottle and it now comes in a tube. It says 1 ounce yet the tube isn&#x27;t even half full. If I use this according to their directions, I&#x27;ll be lucky if it lasts 2 weeks.  When you do use it, when it&#x27;s dry you can literally feel it crack when you smile.  Not comfortable at all.</li>
    <li> I use this product along with erase wrinkles in seconds and sometimes I touch up during the day all wonderful products and they mean what they say Thank you!</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work as advertised.  I will never buy this product or any other product from this Derma a Silk.  Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Not a bad product but leaves a shiny texture to the skin.  I always put a bit of powder on top.</li>
    <li> I used 2 bottles and no improvement. Very expensive product. Will not use it any more. Sorry I wasted my money.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell any difference in anything at all with this product.</li>
    <li> MY WIFE HAS NEVER SAID? SHE HAS WENT ON TO SOMETHING ELSE</li>
    <li> I love it.  You don&#x27;t have to put very much on to see and feel great results. The women&lt;br /&gt; who are complaining about flaking just need to use less. I never want to be without this product.&lt;br /&gt;Best product I have ever used!</li>
    <li> I was really hoping this product would work, but it didn&#x27;t.  I am 51 years old, and have tried many products that claim to reduce wrinkles, lift face etc.  I had absolutely no benefit from this product. Not even worth the 1 star.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t tighten skin and I used it properly. Also leaves white residue.</li>
    <li> This one does not clog pores, smoothes the area around the eyes and frown lines around the mouth.  I like that there is no over-powering scent.</li>
    <li> Definitely feel a tightening of the skin immediately on application. Don&#x27;t know if I really look any better but I&#x27;ll give it time.</li>
    <li> Daily use really tightens skin minimizing lines. Great product.</li>
    <li> Works well with daily use. Good for forehead frown lines, and to plumb skin a bit. I use for day and frownies at night. Use very small amount.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t waste your money buying this product, it does absolutely nothing. It also turns powdery when it dries, whether it is by itself or under makeup.</li>
    <li> I used this for 3 days and had a HORRIBLE allergic reaction.  Sores appeared that did not heal for two weeks and left terrible scarring.  I had to go to a doctor and my skin is still scarred.  I don&#x27;t have particularly sensitive skin and have never had an allergic reaction to any other product.  Be really careful with this!</li>
    <li> I only got 4 uses out of a $40 bottle.  Just used it around my frown lines.  Could not tell any difference in only 4 uses.  What a rip off!</li>
    <li> I was very happy to fine this produce. This was a great price and I got it fast.I would recomend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Love it. Must have it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m almost 55 and am getting wrinkly around the eyes and mouth.  I&#x27;ve also had deep forehead wrinkles since I was in my 20s.  This product is pretty impressive.  I&#x27;m always looking for an absolute \\&quot;magic bullet\\&quot; and have to admit that would only occur if I get a face lift or at least Botox, neither of which I&#x27;m not willing to do.  The DermaSilk really gives my face an impressive finished product. If I wear makeup with it, all the better!</li>
    <li> Great Seller, Great Serum!</li>
    <li> I like this product it evens out my skin and provides a good base for my other makeup to go on.</li>
</ol>
