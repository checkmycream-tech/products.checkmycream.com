      <li>I love it, it holds all my lipsticks and it looks adorable.</li>
      <li>I am in love with lipstick</li>
      <li>It looks great on my counter and doesn&#x27;t take up much space.  </li>
      <li>I wish it were better quality...</li>
      <li>I love looking at how organized by makeup now is.  </li>
      <li>love organizing my lip colors</li>
      <li>was worried it was lost in transit, but it magically arrived after I messaged the seller.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love this item.  </li>
      <li>I just didn&#x27;t know I had so many lipsticks.</li>
      <li>it was worth it my containers came packaged nicely</li>
      <li>I washed mine with Lysol and bleach and it was fine.</li>
      <li>the material is really cheap</li>
      <li>very good size for all my different kinds of lipstick and would buy another one for the rest of my lipstick, also good to put small brushes in.</li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t realize I had so many tubes of lipstick (mainly MAC).  </li>

      <li>(very helpful).  </li>
      <li>Item came fast with no damage.</li>
      <li>that was about 4 times the thickness and so much nicer.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this</li>
      <li>so when i found out there were cute little lipstick trays like this</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months now and absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>but I wish it was a more heavy duty acrylic</li>
      <li>square slots are not all exactly the same size.</li>
      <li>I thought these would be similar, but they are really junky.</li>
      <li>These are very flimsy and don&#x27;t even have enough weight to stay in place on the counter when used.</li>
      <li>Older Urban Decay (the ones with the dagger on top).&lt;br</li>
      <li>It takes up very little space and can fit inside a drawer</li>
      <li>I tried to put my 2 KVDs next to each other and one wouldn&#x27;t fit (even though the tubes are the same size)&lt;br</li>
      <li>Works great, isn&#x27;t super thin like everyone says, arrived on time, no chips, no smell and wasn&#x27;t dirty either.</li>

    <li> Fits many brands of lipstick!</li>
    <li> I love this item.  It takes up very little space and can fit inside a drawer (very helpful).  I love looking at how organized by makeup now is.  A must buy!  Item came fast with no damage.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like it 😔 it was all scratched when it came in the mail &amp; the material is really cheap</li>
    <li> It was Broken when I received  it !!!</li>
    <li> Wonderful if you have a LOT of lipsticks, mascaras, etc. that you need handy.  You can use inside a drawer or set it out for easy access!</li>
    <li> i like it, have to get another one just so i know all my lipsticks will fit, looks good and neat..</li>
    <li> I knew this was coming from China, but I didn&#x27;t think it would take a literal month to get to me.&lt;br /&gt;I was worried it was lost in transit, but it magically arrived after I messaged the seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t have any scratches but there was a small chip missing from a back corner. But it doesn&#x27;t affect how the tray sits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It holds almost all of my lipsticks.&lt;br /&gt;Yes: MAC, Kat Von D, Melt Cosmetics, Illamasqua, NYX, Lipstick Queen, BITE Beauty, and Rimmel London.&lt;br /&gt;No: Older Urban Decay (the ones with the dagger on top).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The square slots are not all exactly the same size. I tried to put my 2 KVDs next to each other and one wouldn&#x27;t fit (even though the tubes are the same size)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still super happy with the product, but be warned about the shipping times and the possibility of it being damaged upon arrival.</li>
    <li> Before, my lipsticks/lip glosses were all thrown together and I could never find the one I needed.  This holder is perfect, I have easy access to each lipstick/gloss. I even made an order for a second one!</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for! These are very flimsy and don&#x27;t even have enough weight to stay in place on the counter when used. I bought another brand locally that was about 4 times the thickness and so much nicer. I thought these would be similar, but they are really junky. They also came dirty and scratched. They also took several WEEKS to get here!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with my purchase I immediately ordered 2 more. All my lipsticks were in makeup bag now all are visible.</li>
    <li> Does what it is supposed to, holds every sized tube of lipstick/lip gloss we have in a nice organized fashion</li>
    <li> First of all for the price I paid to be it was worth it my containers came packaged nicely and my containers didn&#x27;t have any scratches knock on wood. But I just couldn&#x27;t resist for five dollars a piece so I just had to order 3 I highly recommend this it&#x27;s a great buy.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why I expected it to be much bigger than that. Regardless, it is amazing. It holds 24 lipsticks snug (as shown in my pictures). Of course.... Because you buy a cheaper option the acrylic isn&#x27;t as hard as it would be if it had cost 40 dollars but it serves it&#x27;s purpose. I just didn&#x27;t know I had so many lipsticks. I have to buy another one.</li>
    <li> I like this but I wish it was a more heavy duty acrylic</li>
    <li> Really liked this product just wish the squared spaces were a bit larger, other than that Im happy with my purchase</li>
    <li> do not fit alll lipsticks.</li>
    <li> Fits greAt gonna buy another</li>
    <li> Was broken when arrived.</li>

    <li> I received this product within a week of purchasing so that was good. However when it arrived it had a HORRIBLE chemical smell and it had white dust all over it and just looked dirty. It also had some brown stains that appear to be inside of the plastic and I don&#x27;t know what it is. I washed mine with Lysol and bleach and it was fine. 3 stars, because it&#x27;s small, neat and it serves the purpose plus good price!  It holds my MAC, NYX, WET N WILD,  and Revlon lipsticks perfectly. I would recommend it if you don&#x27;t mind cleaning it up a bit upon receipt.</li>
    <li> Works great, isn&#x27;t super thin like everyone says, arrived on time, no chips, no smell and wasn&#x27;t dirty either. The rows on 2 ends are slightly smaller but no big deal. Some people are just DIVAS! Hello its under 5$ ladies. Smh.</li>
    <li> Nice. Just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Great and really useful</li>
    <li> This lipstick holder is perfect and just what I needed!! I only purchased one but I plan to order another one; didn&#x27;t realize I had so many tubes of lipstick (mainly MAC).  It looks great on my counter and doesn&#x27;t take up much space.  I am officially organized!!!</li>
    <li> Got this product earlier than expected. Holds all my lipsticks perfectly.</li>
    <li> I am in love with lipstick so when i found out there were cute little lipstick trays like this i jumped at the offer. I love it, it holds all my lipsticks and it looks adorable. great buy.</li>
    <li> very good size for all my different kinds of lipstick and would buy another one for the rest of my lipstick, also good to put small brushes in. Excellent price</li>
    <li> Good product and price is good</li>
    <li> Im very disappointed it very thin material, I kept tge marshall store ones... I like it I wish it were better quality...</li>
    <li> good only wish is it was bigger!</li>
    <li> love organizing my lip colors</li>
