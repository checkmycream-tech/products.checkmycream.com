      <li>I love the smell!</li>
      <li>For the price, I love it!</li>
      <li>The smell is pleasant, but it does an okay job of conditioning at best, and I certainly didn&#x27;t notice a difference in the look of my hair or hair color in terms of radiance or shine.</li>
      <li>When I do use it, it&#x27;s AMAZING.  </li>
      <li>These Fekkai products are amazing.</li>
      <li>The shampoo/conditioner has given my hair nice volume and shine.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m used to spending about $20 for a bottle of conditioner, but honestly I cringe at doing so regardless.</li>
      <li>I have tried every kind of conditioner and conditioning treatment I could find.  </li>
      <li>During the shower, it kind of smells like a weed to me.  </li>
      <li>Between this product and the Fekkai Color Care Shampoo, my color now stays almost perfect the whole six weeks.</li>
      <li>It honestly makes your hair feel and look like salon quality.  </li>
      <li>Thanks for making a great  product!</li>
      <li>/&gt;It smells really good, and washes out easily.</li>

      <li>I love the smell of this product, very nice and clean.  </li>
      <li>I have very fine hair and was planning on a trip to my hair stylist until I used this product.</li>
      <li>It smells pretty great too.</li>
      <li>What I found is that it leaves my hair feeling very smooth but there is a bit of a weighty feeling also.</li>
      <li>First, I love the packaging, the bottle is sleek and has a great top that has no leaking.  </li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>In order to keep my hair healthy, I have continued to use it for years.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll probably continue to use Moroccan Oil conditioner, because I think the conditioner makes my hair a bit more moisturized and manageable.</li>
      <li>; I just switched back to the world&#x27;s best shampoo and conditioner.&amp;#34; I keep buying this conditioner because nothing else makes my hair look as glorious.</li>

      <li>Love this conditioner,especially for treated colored hair.</li>

      <li>It also has waaaay more body.</li>
      <li>her hair has been noticeably softer and more manageable.</li>
      <li>, I wish it didn&#x27;t cost so much, but if I want to keep my hair looking good at my age, a great product is worth the price</li>
      <li>I am in love with this stuff.</li>
      <li>I would love to stock my guest bathrooms with this</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love how this leaves my hair so shiny and soft.</li>
    <li> This may be the silkiest conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used! For the price, I love it!</li>
    <li> I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. - Enjoyed the smell and it made my hair soft and helped to detangle it, however I needed to add oil to my hair as it did not provide enough moisture to my curly, corse, ethnic hair - however the color looked fantastic!!!</li>
    <li> It came by mistake and it is not the same as in the picture.</li>
    <li> Just an average conditioner. Nothing luxurious. Thick, whipped like formula. Smells okay but a little medicinal.Easy to rinse out and leaves hair feeling conditioned. Complimentary sample from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> I have used this shampoo for years, and nothing else compares! I just hope they never change their formula!</li>
    <li> excelent product. Ive ued this brand for a long time. Very satisfied</li>
    <li> Great fragrance.  Good thick mayonaise like consistency.  Not drippy, but thick/</li>
    <li> I have had great results with this conditioner so far. The scent is wonderful and, most importantly, not over-powering. My hair looks healthy and shiny...exactly what I had hoped for!</li>
    <li> love fekkai products.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s good stuff, but I REALLY wanted the 3 minute mask, (too much $ for mask)</li>
    <li> Really conditions nicely without overly weighing down my naturally wavy hair, which I flat iron daily into a smooth sleek style.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Fekkai for color treated hair for a couple of years now and I like it a lot. It seems to help from the fading that can happen so easily when one colors ones hair. I little goes a long way. I received this item promptly and in good repair.</li>
    <li> This might be the best everyday conditioner ever.  A tiny amount is all that is needed and it conditions SO WELL!  It smells pretty great too.</li>
    <li> With the shampoo keeps my color in tack</li>
    <li> Great for color treated hair! Once you try it you will never go back to anything else. I have tried every product out there for my hair. I have fine hair and when I got it colored it would get dry and dull. Now when I use this product with conditioner it never gets that way. Worth the price.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best conditioners I&#x27;ve ever used. I have thick hair and it leaves it nice, soft, and manageable. The shampoo is just as good.</li>
    <li> GOOD CONDITIONER  MAKES FRIZZY DRY HAIR MANAGEABLE</li>
    <li> I am so glad I bought this conditioner. It is the best I have ever used. It is expensive but it is worth paying that much for it. And you don&#x27;t have to use much so it will last a long time. I have thin, fine hair and it gives it body and thickness. It also makes it shiny. I highly recommend this conditioner.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Fekkai conditioner with the SAME NAME, but in the other bottle, the one with the rounded top, and this one is FAR inferior.  I even compared the ingredients, and they&#x27;re VERY different.  The rounded bottle top one leaves my hair soft and silky while this one leaves it dry and frizzy.  I will not buy this one again.</li>
    <li> Love this!  Best thing I have found to use on kids!  No more snarls!</li>
    <li> This line of products has so far been really great for my hair which is bleached, colored and curled to death on a daily basis. It leaves my hair shiny, soft and manageable. I do recommend using an additional leave on for hair ends if you use a flat iron or curling iron as I do.</li>
    <li> If you have damaged hair or dry hair or color a lot buy this product! I had both and was at my wit&#x27;s end with trying conditioners for my that actually worked.  This conditioner is a bit more on the expensive side but worth every dime.  My hair is smooth and soft after using this conditioner.  This is my new cannot live without conditioner.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my wife because she has long had complaints about her hair. Because she has colored it, Fekkai Technician Color Cair Conditioner seemed like something worth trying. My wife has long curly hair that goes past her shoulders and from the very first use of this product her hair has been noticeably softer and more manageable. I noticed almost immediately that it looked healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is true even after several days, at which point she can still run her fingers through the strands with minimal tangling even after multiple style changes (without additional product).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each time she has used very little of the product - only a amount equal to the size of a quarter - and this has been more than enough to treat her long hair. In fact, she has liked this conditioner so much that she bought the matching shampoo the other day. It also has a pleasant fragrance to it that isn&#x27;t overpowering. It is well worth the expense.</li>
    <li> Fabulous conditioner for color treated hair. This conditioner has a very pleasant, slightly citrus fragrance and a nice thick consistency. I shampooed with the same brand shampoo and then used this product. I have very fine hair and was planning on a trip to my hair stylist until I used this product. My hair was shiny and soft without being flat and limp. The dry ends were also gone and my hair looks great. So glad to find this fine product. I will purchase this again.</li>
    <li> This is a great conditioner. I&#x27;ve been using the shampoo as well and love them both. It smells great. I have long, thick curly hair, but I don&#x27;t have to use all that much. I&#x27;ve been having to dye my dark hair pretty regularly, about every 4-6 weeks, and I&#x27;ve noticed the color in my hair has stayed around longer than usual, which hasn&#x27;t happened with other products made for color treated hair. The shampoo/conditioner has given my hair nice volume and shine. My curls can certainly get tangled at times, but are easy to comb through when I&#x27;m done conditioning my hair with Fekkai.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I said this with the shampoo and I&#x27;ll say it with the conditioner too, I wish it didn&#x27;t cost so much, but if I want to keep my hair looking good at my age, a great product is worth the price and I don&#x27;t skimp on my hair or my skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read that this caused some people some troubles. I like the scent and it works just fine for my colored hair. I can&#x27;t say that it is better than the Moroccan Oil product that I typically use. I don&#x27;t love it enough to go out and purchase this on my own. I&#x27;ll probably continue to use Moroccan Oil conditioner, because I think the conditioner makes my hair a bit more moisturized and manageable.</li>
    <li> Still willing to give it 5 stars though!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  It honestly makes your hair feel and look like salon quality.  I have long, blond hair and it was so easy to comb through in the shower with this stuff in.  Afterwards, your hair is soft and shiny and lightweight...even after curling.  I am extremely impressed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  Not sure how I feel about the smell.  During the shower, it kind of smells like a weed to me.  Not unpleasant, but not pleasant.  Luckily the scent is not strong the following day...but maybe I don&#x27;t know what smell &amp;#34;creme de rose&amp;#34; is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the price point is a little higher than I normally pay for the size of the bottle.</li>
    <li> I am a fan of Fekkai products. I have blonde highlighted hair. My natural hair tends to be dry and coloring it and styling it only makes it feel more dry, especially the ends of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Fekkai Technician conditioner makes my hair really smooth. I was impressed that my ends seem smooth and looked good after using it. Usually the test of whether a conditioner works well for me is how well my ends look after using it, and with this conditioner they were pretty smooth and laid down nicely after styling. The conditioner has a pleasant scent and rinses away completely. It doesn&#x27;t leave any waxy residue like some conditioners that I have tried. My hair is still dry but it is much more smooth and I would buy this conditioner again.</li>
    <li> This is good for color treated hair because it leaves your hair tangle free.</li>
    <li> So far all of the Fekkai conditioners have been wonderful, comparable to my everyday Pureology Hydrate conditioner (which is saying a lot). So far my favorite of all has been the Shea conditioner, but the Color Care shampoo and conditioner have done right by my hair too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dark color underneath (where there is no gray) and am blonde on top....which has required a lot of bleach over almost a year to get out all the dark dye I&#x27;ve used to cover my white, er...gray. So that&#x27;s a lot of damage to work with, it&#x27;s perfectly healthy underneath but the top is where I have a lot of problem with products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had color all over again, I would use this Fekkai Color Care shampoo/conditioner with no problem. I love it anyway (so far all their products are great) but I don&#x27;t &#x27;need&#x27; this for hair that is about 80% bleached. The dark colored hair underneath is like shiny silk after using this product so I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone with saturated intense color they want to keep happy. I like this as well as my Pureology Hydrate and it may even be cheaper (compared to Ulta prices)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells really good, and washes out easily. No buildup.</li>
    <li> Love this conditioner,especially for treated colored hair. Not too greasy or heavy, to use as everyday conditioner. This is a great line and smells so good!</li>
    <li> This conditioner feels great! I have dry and damaged ends and this conditioner really helps moisturize and condition my hair. I&#x27;ve tried several Fekkai products lately and really like them. This conditioner isn&#x27;t too heavy or too light, it&#x27;s just right for my leaning to dry, highlighted hair. It doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down and helps to keep it bouncy and light feeling. This has a great, clean scent and is a great daily conditioner for overworked or dryish hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a top line, great conditioner that leaves hair really feeling luxurious and soft. It&#x27;s one of my favorites now that I&#x27;ve tried it. Another plus is that a little product goes a long way. This is a lovely product that really works.</li>
    <li> This is all I use.  It works really well for aging hair that is pretty thin.</li>
    <li> Fekkai is generally a product that I trust.  I&#x27;m consistently finding that I am allergic to more and more brands, so Fekkai is a mid-price shampoo/conditioner that I can use without stressing too much.  I don&#x27;t think that it necessarily holds my color any better than other brands, but it is good for everyday use.  I prefer the full blown volume shampoo/conditioner, but this works as well.</li>
    <li> Smells nice but doesn&#x27;t work very well at taming flyways or conditioning dry hair.</li>
    <li> I first used this conditioner about 10 years ago now after receiving both the shampoo and conditioner as a gift. I think the greatest testament to the amazingness of this conditioner is that although I&#x27;ve tried other shampoos and conditioners (both other brands and other formulas of Fekkai) I keep coming back to this shampoo and conditioner. It&#x27;s like the Goldilocks of shampoo and conditioners, i.e., not too drying to make my hair look fried but not too moisturizing to make my hair go limp. It&#x27;s juuuust right. I went back and looked at the review I originally wrote for the old packaging back in the day (it&#x27;s had both a formula and a packaging update so Amazon has given it a whole new item number and page, apparently.) Because the old review still holds true, I posted it below. Hope this helps!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;My hair looks fuller, softer, and shinier when I use this conditioner. It also has waaaay more body. I used this conditioner, along with the Technician Shampoo, a few years ago after receiving it as a gift; I always got lots of compliments on my hair then. Because of the price, I bought something less expensive, but not cheap, when I finished the bottle. Instantly my hair looked less full and wasn&#x27;t quite as manageable and I had my first bad hair day in a long while. After finishing that other brand (it starts and ends with an &amp;#34;A&amp;#34; and is famous for its natural ingredients) I broke down and bought bottles of the Fekkai Technician Shampoo and Technician Conditioner. Glorious! Good hair days were back again! Other people notice as well and I&#x27;m still getting those standard questions, &amp;#34;did you get a haircut?&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;did you color your hair?&amp;#34; &amp;#34;Nope&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;not recently,&amp;#34; I just switched back to the world&#x27;s best shampoo and conditioner.&amp;#34; I keep buying this conditioner because nothing else makes my hair look as glorious.</li>
    <li> Works great with the companion shampoo to help my color stay looking great between treatments and make my hair feel and smell awesome.  It has a great smell and can be used as a shave cream for sensitive skin in a pinch.</li>
    <li> I am unexpectedly in love with this product. I usually use the Garnier shampoo meant for colored hair and it works really well, but this shampoo has left my hair shinier than normal. I&#x27;ve gotten several compliments after each of the last 3 times I used this, since recoloring my hair. I always add red into my hair, and tend to have some wash out for a few showers after, but noticed less of that this time around - at least on the towel I dried my hair with when I got out. I also really like the scent of this, it&#x27;s not too intense, one of those just enough to be great kind of things. The conditioner itself is very thick, which means you don&#x27;t really need that much of it - a benefit for me since I have really thick hair. There&#x27;s not much difference in my usual frizz and wavy craziness my hair gets after its washed, but the extra shine is worth it.</li>
    <li> Floral and fruity smell, with a thick texture, it keeps my thin hair moist without feeling oily and heavy, especially in the winter. I started using the color care conditioner when my hair was colored. It definitely kept my hair color up for a good few months. As for today, my hair is no longer processed and colored, but it does get very dry in the wintertime up in the Northeast. In order to keep my hair healthy, I have continued to use it for years. Many other products unfortunately either worked poorly or weighed my hair down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a super fan for Fekkai&#x27;s hair products. They are pricey but they do make my hair beautiful and healthy looking. Also, their fragrance is so beautiful and feminine. I have been a very happy and loyal customer!</li>
    <li> love this conditioner, I have tried other conditioner and shampoo in this range, and this one does not disappoint.  It is not thick and does not have a heavy finish.  I love the softness and the finish when I finish blow drying my hair.  you really do not need to apply a lot, but I noticed it does keep the color longer, or at least not get washed out as I exercise and wash my hair every day.  I highly recommend thos brand and many of its products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a huge Fekkai fan and usually use the Shine System.  Now that my hair is an \\&quot;unnatural\\&quot; color (currently purple), I thought this would be a great chance to try the Color Care line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received both a Color Care Shampoo and Conditioner from the Vine Program. I opened the bottle and it has a lovely, light citrus scent.  The conditioner is heavy and feels luxurious.  My fine/thin hair has been bleached numerous times so is a bit on the dry side but not fried.  This conditioner helps keep it in good condition. It moisturizes without weighing it down.  Sadly, the scent doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would like but that may be a plus for those who don&#x27;t like a lot of fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve washed my hair daily and my bright purple color hasn&#x27;t faded much at all. So, this isn&#x27;t stripping color which is a WONDERFUL thing with temporary dyes that need refreshed every week. I can go a couple of weeks without redying-YAY!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not tried the \\&quot;other\\&quot; version of this the reviewers are comparing it too so I can&#x27;t say if it is as good as the version with grapeseed oil or not.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m used to spending about $20 for a bottle of conditioner, but honestly I cringe at doing so regardless. At $27 this is definitely way more than I would pay for a hair care product, especially as it&#x27;s not any sort of miracle worker. The smell is pleasant, but it does an okay job of conditioning at best, and I certainly didn&#x27;t notice a difference in the look of my hair or hair color in terms of radiance or shine. I don&#x27;t doubt that this is a good product, I just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
    <li> It smells lovely, and has a smooth application. It moisturizes very little, however, and I needed to add other conditioners for my dry hair. If you have oily, color treated hair, I would definitely recommend this. DRY, color-treated hair? Not so much.</li>
    <li> Made my hair soft and tangle free. Love it.</li>
    <li> Great for color treated hair!</li>
    <li> Fekkai Technician Color Care-  I normally use a moisturizing conditioner recommending by my stylist because she does an express keratin treatment on my hear.  I had a chance to try this Fekkai Technician Color Care Conditioner.  What I found is that it leaves my hair feeling very smooth but there is a bit of a weighty feeling also.</li>
    <li> Very nice conditioner. It makes my hair feel great. I love the smell! It is one of my favorite things about this. I color my hair regularly and haven&#x27;t noticed if this helps extend the time threw coloring&#x27;s but I have noticed that the grey around my face has been less noticeable since I started using the Fekkai products. The bottle is nice, easy to hold and easy to get the conditioner out.</li>
    <li> I have very dry hair and try not to wash it every day just to help it stay moisturized.  I have tried every kind of conditioner and conditioning treatment I could find.  I just tried this Fekkai Technician color care conditioner, since I do color my hair.  First, I love the packaging, the bottle is sleek and has a great top that has no leaking.  I love the smell of this product, very nice and clean.  I also like the thickness of the conditioner itself, a little goes a long way. I used it on the ends of my hair (shoulder length hair) and left it on while I finished shaving and showering, then rinsed really well.  This is the only conditioner I have used where once I get out of the shower, I don&#x27;t have to also add leave in conditioner on my ends.  My hair smells and looks great, no fly aways and no dry looking hair.  I am in love with this stuff.</li>
    <li> Well, I tried the matching shampoo and found it to be very drying to my hair so I guess I was naïve to believe that the conditioner would make up for the shampoos shortcomings.  Since the shampoo turned my long hair into a dry, straw-like tangled mess, I assumed that the conditioner would be extra rich and moisturizing but it wasn&#x27;t.  Instead it has a moderate texture and artificial cherry like scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I applied a normal dollop, waited 5 minutes and rinsed.  My hair felt dry and brittle and my ends looked frazzled.  The next time, I applied copious amounts of the product and then covered my hair with a disposable shower cap which I left on for 10 minutes.  I then removed the cap and massaged the product into my hair, waited an additional 3 minutes and rinsed.  This seemed to help a little but not nearly enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a result, I&#x27;m using 2-3 times as much conditioner as I am shampoo and my hair is still very dry.  So much so that I went to the local Ulta and purchased a moisturizing hair mask to try and put extra moisture into my hair.  It&#x27;s frustrating when you purchase a product to improve the health of your hair and it seems to do the opposite.</li>
    <li> I use this along with Fekkai Shampoo.  Both work great.  Just like having a salon treatment.  Keeps my hair soft and shiny.  Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Really leaves my hair silky and smooth even though I color my hair.  Pretty expensive, but it&#x27;s my go to product.</li>
    <li> I recently tried  Fekkai Technician color care condition and I&#x27;m in love with how soft and shiny my hair is . It does seem to help with hair color retention . I am not familiar with any previous formulations but this is working . I am a hairstylist and have tried many brands it does what it says and will recommend it to my clients ! Try it for yourself !</li>
    <li> For colored hair this is a perfect product.</li>
    <li> Love this conditioner - coupled with the shampoo its awesome - leave my hair silky &amp; shiny - smells great (grapefruity) too</li>
    <li> I have never used a Fekkai Hair Care product.  I color my hair on a regular basis and I am always looking for a good shampoo and conditioner that takes care of my color treated hair.  It is designed with the “5F Principle: Form, Feel, Function, Fragrance and Finish, decadent textures, lush scents and exquisite ingredients unite to deliver an extraordinary hair experience.”  The shampoo has a lovely light fragrance and a little bit goes a long way.  I use a dime size amount and get a wonderful lather that rinses clean.  The shampoo is infused with the oil of pure grape seed.  I have fine hair and often find that color treated shampoos and conditioners leave my hair flat.  They tend to be too moisturizing.  The Fekkai conditioner also has a light fragrance and leaves my hair feeling smooth and tangle free without weighing it down.  There is a definite volume and shine to my hair.  I am a firm believer in using the same brand shampoo with the conditioner to get the best results for my hair.  This is a definite winning duo.  This is a product that I will buy again and again.</li>
    <li> My hair is colored/bleached and thin and lifeless.  The conditioner I had been using did not do anything for me.  My hair was just dry and lank as always.  However, using the Fekkai Color Care Conditioner I have noticed an improvement in the softness and volume of my hair.  My hair seems thicker and more lifelike.  And softer too.  The product smells nice and it washes out easily and cleanly.  I like it and will try to continue using this product.  I recommend for all with colored hair.</li>
    <li> These Fekkai products are amazing. Seriously.  After using them, I wonder how / why other haircare companies do not do whatever it is that Fekkai does.  I&#x27;ll expain:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their shampoo cleans your hair.  I mean--it&#x27;s clean, but NOT stripped.  It doesn&#x27;t lather up because of how it&#x27;s made to clean your HAIR and not just strip it down to nothing (and then dry it out, rendering it unable to continue to grow).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner, paired with it&#x27;s partner shampoo, keeps your hair feeling smooth, manageable, and shiny (I sound like a commercial, but I swear, I do not intend to).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually use Chi or Nexxus products.  I always use Chi serum.  I am very picky about  my haircare.  I have red long hair, and it breaks and falls out SO easily it&#x27;s hard to pinpoint the cause.  I rarely even style it, because it&#x27;s too stressful on the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That all said, using this and it&#x27;s matching shampoo product has completely changed how I look at my hair.  I can wash my hair with the Color Care, and then condition it with this, and OMG I don&#x27;t need the serum!  When I do use it, it&#x27;s AMAZING.  I can wash (little lather), condition (sooooo nice), rinse (clean as a whistle), comb out (no issues, and my hair is 1/2 way down my back), and dry just my bangs (come on ladies, we all know how important the bangs are--if we dry them, the rest can work itself out on most days)--and it looks like I spent hours styling it.  I can curl it with my fingers, and it looks marvelous!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My color (red, natural, but amped up) is bright and (seriously) sparkly!  I would love to stock my guest bathrooms with this so I can share the amazing qualities of this product with those I love.  I&amp;#34;m not kidding--so that should tell you &amp;#34;something&amp;#34; about the product haha&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells great, and feels great.  I cannot recommend this enough. (That&#x27;s a first!)</li>
    <li> Fekkai puts out a great product and their Color Care conditioner is no exception. It gives my hair great hydration and doesn&#x27;t build up like other conditioners. It has a mild scent, which is so nice. It&#x27;s a heavy cream so you don&#x27;t need much and washes out easily.</li>
    <li> I live in the Dessert in the Winter months and this conditioner along with its shampoo companion are the only thing that keeps my hair looking great!  I feel my hair is my best feature so I take very good care of it.  I&#x27;ve been using this brand for 2 years now and absolutely love the silkiness it gives my hair.  Normally my hair is dry and brittle in the winter, now it can look good year round. Thanks for making a great  product!</li>
    <li> I have very, very light blonde color treated hair that never seems to stay true to color between colorings. Between this product and the Fekkai Color Care Shampoo, my color now stays almost perfect the whole six weeks. I love it. Plus it smells nice - a little bit like grapefruit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that worries me is now that Proctor &amp; Gamble has taken this label over, will it stay the same product or just morph into another high priced flavor of shampoo on the shelf at the store? I&#x27;ll be watching closely. P&amp;G is one of those monster brands that seems to make a billion vanilla flavored products from soup to nuts and none of them are remarkable, just okay. Can a company who makes toilet paper really be an expert on the vagaries of premium haircare? We&#x27;ll see.</li>
    <li> Good.  Love the product</li>
    <li> Great for your hair, helps hold the color longer for those with colored hair.  Works well on normal hair also</li>
    <li> This is great conditioner.  I usually use cheaper stuff, but on special occasions, I use this.  I should use it everyday, but I sometimes shower twice a day (I work out a lot), and it is so luxurious it otherwise feels wasteful.  Maybe when I win the lottery I&#x27;ll use it more often.  However, this does make a difference.  And, a little goes a long way.  There&#x27;s a reason this is one of the few brands of shampoo/conditioner that Nordstrom stocks and sells...</li>
    <li> Great hard-to-find item!  Silky smooth hair.</li>
    <li> Great product for colored hair - keeps it soft and definitely makes your color last longer. Only issue is ]I&#x27;ve stopped buying at Amazon and now buy directly from the Fekkai because Amazon is unable to provide the 16oz size except through private sellers at ridiculous prices. Pity as I would prefer to buy this on Amazon but it&#x27;s not there.</li>
    <li> Great conditioner, be sure to leave in a couple of minutes for it to works it magic! highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I used this after the shampoo. The shampoo felt drying and tangled up my hair. This conditioner did not help in the untangling and didn&#x27;t feel like it put any moisture back in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this in exchange for my opinion.  I love this. It is so thick, which I  really like in a conditioner. It is easy to get on and makes hair oh so manageable. Would buy this for sure!</li>
    <li> I was worried after applying this that it would be too conditioning and make my hair oily, not so. Worked really well! I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> Great conditioner, leaves hair soft and does not strip hair color</li>
    <li> I have recently fallen in love with fekkai. I get highlights and low lights to my natural dark blonde hair every 60-90 days. I have super thin strands. In the winter I struggle with finding product that will not strip my hair of moisture or weigh it down. In the summer, I just struggle to keep moisture in. Year round, frizz/fly aways can be an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo/conditioner seems to be the best 1-stop solution for me. Of course it isn&#x27;t perfect. I have it on subscription which makes it a huge bargain compared to local retailers of all kinds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that my last shipment came with a damaged shampoo top (I just swapped it with my old bottle, but still a bummer) and my conditioner didn&#x27;t seem completely full. At the rate of the bargain and being out at the time, I just accepted it. I wish there was some tamper proof packaging.</li>
    <li> The entire product line I received smells like fresh squeezed grapefruit. The conditioner was very thick and nourishing, and is wonderful for every day use. I almost didn&#x27;t need to move onto the Luxe Color Masque (also in the line) but I wanted to for that extra nourishment. This is a product I would purchase again!</li>
    <li> My hair has never felt so smooth and soft.  It&#x27;s a bit spendy, but worth every penny.  I have long-ish hair, and have never used conditioners regularly, but this makes my hair feel better than I can ever remember.  The conditioner seems hard to rinse out, but when you dry and style, your hair is very soft and easy to style.  I can&#x27;t imagine using anything else, now that I&#x27;ve found it!</li>
    <li> Great stuff! Arrived in perfect order!</li>
    <li> This shampoo leaves your hair feeling soft and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;Pleased with the results. Don&#x27;t need to much product to get clean hair</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this conditioner with its companion shampoo and have only good things to say. My salon-color hair looks great, the scent is wonderful (floral and citrus, in an enticing combo) and there is no gooey or sticky residue from the product. Well done, Fredric Fekkai.</li>
    <li> It is great like all Frekkai products</li>
    <li> Well worth the price. I&#x27;ve tried them all but always go back to Fekkai!  The way my hair looks and feels is important to me.  Taking care of me is important ... Fekkai works.</li>
    <li> The Fekkai line is a good one.  I&#x27;m not sure I would have bought it from my local Target because it&#x27;s one of the more expensive conditioners around, but the subscribe and save program made it affordable to try and continue with.  It&#x27;s a fairly light conditioner, smells good and helps protect the coloring in my hair.  Hard to beat that.</li>
    <li> I like the conditioner and since I rec&#x27;d it for review I had the choice to get the Fekkai Full Volume Shampoo to pair it with and I used both of them together for a full two weeks. Both have a pleasant scent alone or together.  The conditioner is thick and seems to do a wonderful job moisturizing my hair and left it nice and shiny.  The problem I had is that my head itched uncontrollably for the whole two weeks I used the shampoo and conditioner.  I don&#x27;t know whether it was the conditioner or the shampoo or both.  But, for the whole two weeks I felt like I had bugs.  I don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used my normal Loreal shampoo and Argan Oil Conditioner this morning before church and my head didn&#x27;t itch a bit.  If the shampoo or conditioner didn&#x27;t make my head itch I might buy it but it us quite expensive alone or together.  I have short hair though and I think the products would last a good 2 to 3 months.</li>
    <li> Conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;Fekkai Technician Color Care Conditioner 8 Fl Oz.&lt;br /&gt;I love this conditioner.  It does its job wonderfully and beautifully.  It is a color care product.&lt;br /&gt;I am satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;I have no complaints with this product.  It left my hair soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> Makes hair very soft!</li>
    <li> All of the Fekkai hair products are exceptional, but the color care and prx are my favorites for shampoo and conditioner. I have unruly shoulder length curly hair.  Since starting to use these products in Dec 2014 I&#x27;ve noticed less hair breakage when styling, and a lot less hair in the drain after a shower. Having a ton of fine hair, I&#x27;m used to shedding quite a bit of hair and am hugely surprised at how healthy my hair now looks.</li>
    <li> I received this complimentary sample and I am sold on the value of this product; no frizz on this humid day and love the smell, highly recommend this product!!!</li>
