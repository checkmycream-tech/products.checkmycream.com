    <li> The Beasy board has been worth every cent.  My husband has advanced MS and is unable to transfer from wheelchair to bed/other seating without assistance.  We have used other transfer boards in the past and none compare to this board.  The gliding disc allows for easy movement even when he is unable to \\&quot;scoot\\&quot; himself.  It is lightweight and travels well.  We always take it whenever we go on trips.  We are able to use it to get him in/out of the van as well.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.  We&#x27;ve been using it daily for two years and it shows no sign of wear.</li>
    <li> It works even better than described; well worth the money. I just wish I had known of this product sooner.</li>
    <li> Not useful to my wife as she is not weight&lt;br /&gt;Bearing</li>
    <li> The Beasy Board has been a great help to my mom and has made life much easier for her. We have to thank the Physical Therapist she had in the hospital who recommended it. It needs to be used to transfer off and on chairs that have a removable side or no side.</li>
    <li> Item was delivered on time. However, there were slight stains on it and a small chip. We are still figuring out how to use it.</li>
    <li> We thought the Beasy board would work well for my husband who had a spinal stroke which left him paralyzed.  I would  recommend this way of transferring.  The one thing that I do now like about it is the opening in the middle where you hold on to the board.  I would like it if the opening would be along the whole track like the smaller boards.</li>
    <li> I could not use this with my mother who has alzheimers. The user has to be able to help you.</li>
    <li> Nahhhh  Is not as easy to use as it shows on the videos.  The transfer circle doesn&#x27;t move to easy either.  I sent it back.  Got lucky that got my money back.</li>
    <li> Historically I have not had to use a transfer board until now. With added side impact features on newer cars, the gap between the outside passenger seat  either front or back are much wider, perhaps a minimum of 10&amp;#34; or so. I am not weight bearing so when we purchased a new sedan the need arose and my wife suggested I try this item. This transition did not take too long to adapt and I am very glad that this transfer board was designed with me in mind.&lt;br /&gt;The cost like any &amp;#34;medical equipment&amp;#34; would cause anyone to initially flinch but after a few uses you may be thoroughly convinced of its value and design!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. I&#x27;m not fond of it. It&#x27;ll do though for what I need it for. Others like it better.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product.  We have been using a wooded transfer board that has recently started to splinter. This product makes the tranfer almost effortless. This price seems more fair than the price we were quoted at the rehab hospital.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use. Greatly reduces skin tear risk and back strain. Very user friendly. The curved design helps with the wheel chair wheel being a barrier.</li>
    <li> This board is pricey, but well worth the money.  The board makes transferring a piece of cake.  I&#x27;ve had no problems transferring a 6&#x27;2&amp;#34; 200lb male.  You do need to be careful about how you position the board and ensure the patient is sitting on the disc, but if you follow the directions, it works like a charm.</li>
    <li> purchased to assist with transfer from wheelchair to bed and sofa. products seems to work best with slight gravity. more than pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> What a great product. Our lives are so much easier with a double leg amputee!  Would recommend to anyone..........</li>
    <li> this transfer board made transferring from bus wheelchair to airport wheelchair to airplane isle chair to rental power chair to hotel bed and shower bench a breeze.  my Aunt took me and my mom with her to Disney World.  without this fantastic device, the trip wouldn&#x27;t have been possible.  glad I decided to purchase this before the trip.  we did leave it on a sea world ride which was a spinning tower that took you 200 or was it 300 feet?  into the air to the top.  the ride operator brought it out to us before we left the area thank goodness.  we used the carrybag to attach it to the back of the manual chairs at the airports and the rental power chairs.  it&#x27;s a time saver and better than lifting my heavy 205lb body.  gatebelt around waste for them to pull me across this board.</li>
    <li> Love the board. Both my mom and I had trouble making it work, positioning her correctly on the board to slide her over. The mattress may have been too soft because it was difficult sliding her. Not sure if the board was too long.</li>
    <li> This transfer board has been a life saver during my father&#x27;s recovery process.  It made transferring him from the bed to wheelchair to toilet seat, etc a breeze!  I highly recommend it for most elderly persons households, or those going through recovery.</li>
    <li> This slide board works great!  I have increasing muscle weakness and this saves my caregivers back.  A great product.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Husband recently returned home after an extended hospital/rehab stay. Since he cannot sit up by himself and/or walk, I could not have brought him home without this board. He is 180 pounds; I am 104 pounds. The transfer is pretty easy (after some practice). I cringed at the cost, but it has paid for itself.</li>
    <li> excellent product, just need to be sure that you transfer at the same height from point A to point B.</li>
