      <li>The Alum block was OK</li>
      <li>love the way my shave feels when I use this soap.</li>
      <li>I do however prefer the RazoRock better.</li>
      <li>but I can&#x27;t see the need to have 12 stick unless you really love Arko.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve heard many opinions on the scent.&lt;br /&gt;Give</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t get your hopes up, there are better out there.</li>
      <li>What more can you ask for?</li>
      <li>The Arko Stick is OK, but I prefer the Vander Hagen shaving soaps, and Ingram tube shaving cream.</li>
      <li>If it smelled better, I would give it five stars.</li>
      <li>You will like it and want more for sure.</li>
      <li>The shaving soap didn&#x27;t smell very good and didn&#x27;t work as good as my other shaving products.</li>

      <li>Now the Arko shave stick has a strong scent.</li>
      <li>Some don&#x27;t care for Arko&#x27;s sent, but I think its just fine.  </li>
      <li>They also smell better, but your not going to get a shave this quick and cheap that doesn&#x27;t leave your face feeling like it got whipped with a belt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Comfortable.  </li>
      <li>Smooth and silky.</li>
      <li>What is amazing is how much lather the stick will produce.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s so many great soaps out there that having some variety is what makes wet shaving such a great hobby.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This shaving soap was cheap and has tallow in it</li>
      <li>It smells like cheap soap and reminds me of cheap hotels.</li>
      <li>Nothing can beat the nice warm rich lather from your favorite shaving bowl and a nice shave cream, but in a pinch or when traveling, it is hard to beat the Akro Shaving Stick for convenience and effectiveness.</li>
      <li>I had enough lather for 3 good passes.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s what makes this block magic, it does really get rid of razor burn.</li>
      <li>The soap is garbage, but the alum block is cool.</li>
      <li>the smell is industrial but for quick shaves using it to face lather nothing beats it in terms of speed.</li>
      <li>The smell is pronounced when the soap is dry, but seems to dissipate a bit when it&#x27;s lathered, which is definitely a good thing.  </li>
      <li>so much I bought a 12 pack, which should last more than a year for sure.</li>
      <li>Run it all along your freshly shaved skin.</li>
      <li>I lather it right on my face.</li>
      <li>Cheap soap with a high quality lather -</li>
      <li>If your new to wet shaving this combo is a great starter.</li>
      <li>It feels good and really does seem to help get rid of the irritation I sometimes get on my neck and a couple other spots.  </li>
      <li>It leaves a clean, smooth feeling and stops bleeding of tiny nicks.</li>
      <li>First time I used it , the lather exploded on my face within seconds of using my badger brush.</li>
      <li>I bought this as more of a novelty than an actual shaving option.</li>
      <li>This is my first block.  </li>
      <li>Price is very reasonable for this product Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>so I thought it would be very slippery and help with my razor.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend both!</li>
      <li>I find it works better when the block is wet.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t burn nearly as much as alcohol-based aftershave and acts as styptic for any cuts  </li>
      <li>If you used to much pressure a sting is waiting</li>
      <li>/&gt;Not much you can say about the Alum block, other than it&#x27;s my favorite follow-up after rinsing my face.</li>
      <li>In less than 30 seconds your face will be full of rich lather.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend to anyone who wants a quality shave.</li>
      <li>Arko shaving soap stick is a classic for a reason.  </li>
      <li>Of course the more expensive creams do work better.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s also comforting to know that it will go away quickly and the razor burn that would normally last for hours will not happen.</li>
      <li>I can see why it&#x27;s so highly rated:  </li>
      <li>It can be a little much when you start your shave but washes away pretty cleanly.</li>
      <li>Moisten the stick and apply it directly to your beard.  </li>
      <li>As far as the scent...</li>
      <li>Lathers nicely, it&#x27;s very affordable, and lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>Alum block is very helpful if you are using single blade.</li>

    <li> Arko shaving soap stick is a classic for a reason.  It works well and it fills a need.  If you ever have to shave on the road, or on a camping trip, and do not have access to your shaving cup, this soap stick will get the job done.  And done well.  Moisten the stick and apply it directly to your beard.  Then grab your favorite brush and within seconds you can work up a brilliant lather.  Nothing can beat the nice warm rich lather from your favorite shaving bowl and a nice shave cream, but in a pinch or when traveling, it is hard to beat the Akro Shaving Stick for convenience and effectiveness.</li>
    <li> I was using this brands cream and was so happy about it. This shaving soap is very smooth and like the smell. Alum block is very helpful if you are using single blade. Price is very reasonable for this product Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> The soap is garbage, but the alum block is cool. Don&#x27;t get your hopes up, there are better out there.</li>
    <li> The Alum block is very good, and works very well after shaving.  The Arko Stick is OK, but I prefer the Vander Hagen shaving soaps, and Ingram tube shaving cream.</li>
    <li> I bought this as more of a novelty than an actual shaving option. It performs great, and I would not hesitate to throw it in my bag to use while traveling.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical when I bought this product. The Alum block was OK, It&#x27;s an alum block. I do however prefer the RazoRock better. Now the Arko shave stick has a strong scent. It can be a little much when you start your shave but washes away pretty cleanly. It has a scent like a commercial lemon hand soap. What is amazing is how much lather the stick will produce. First time I used it , the lather exploded on my face within seconds of using my badger brush. I had enough lather for 3 good passes. I&#x27;d recommend this product if you like a good lather and want to save pennies. As far as the scent...You either tolerate it or don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> The shaving soap makes a great lather and provides a smooth shave. If it smelled better, I would give it five stars. It smells like cheap soap and reminds me of cheap hotels. I&#x27;m not sure what the scent is. Maybe tallow?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not much you can say about the Alum block, other than it&#x27;s my favorite follow-up after rinsing my face. It leaves a clean, smooth feeling and stops bleeding of tiny nicks.</li>
    <li> Arko Shaving Soap Stick:&lt;br /&gt;I love the way my shave feels when I use this soap. Smooth and silky. Comfortable.  I did find that it I lollygagged, it would dry out on my face.  (No real problem.  It&#x27;s soap, add water or rinse and go again. Probably my fault for poor lathering.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell: For me, the smell is not a gourmet smell, it is, however, a comfort smell. It smells like soap. Another review said it smells like a dryer sheet. Yeah, kinda. But it reminds me of the smell of basic soaps from my childhood in the 60&#x27;s. Plain old ivory soap or something. I wouldn&#x27;t want it as a cologne, but as a soap, I like it.&lt;br /&gt;(If you HATE the smell of dryer sheet, you might end up throwing this away. Some reviewers have noted that the smell goes away as the stick is exposed to air, so if you&#x27;re frugal, don&#x27;t throw it away immediately.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The alum block:&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve never used one (I hadn&#x27;t) you should try it.  I find it very pleasant after a shave.  It feels good and really does seem to help get rid of the irritation I sometimes get on my neck and a couple other spots.  On reviewer suggested rubbing your face with the wet block then cleaning up your area for 4 to 7 minutes before rinsing and drying.  That works well for me, though I should add that I don&#x27;t mind the slightly dry feeling it leaves.</li>
    <li> I decided to try Arko after researching what the best shave soaps and creams are.  I can see why it&#x27;s so highly rated:  It quickly and easily creates a wonderful cushion of lather.  The downside is that it basically smells like a toilet puck.  The smell is pronounced when the soap is dry, but seems to dissipate a bit when it&#x27;s lathered, which is definitely a good thing.  I&#x27;m not trying to smell like a janitor&#x27;s cart all day!  It&#x27;s inexpensive and the stick will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The alum block was a pleasant surprise!  It doesn&#x27;t burn nearly as much as alcohol-based aftershave and acts as styptic for any cuts  I find it works better when the block is wet.  Instantly subsides any irritation.</li>
    <li> The Arko Shave soap and alum block are a great combination at a great price. Both are easy to use and the Arko smells great!. Highly recommend both!</li>
    <li> Cheap soap with a high quality lather - The scent here will make or break the product for you.&lt;br /&gt;Lemon pledge, toilet pucks... I&#x27;ve heard many opinions on the scent.&lt;br /&gt;Give it a shot - the smell fades quick and you&#x27;ll get a good shave with it.</li>
    <li> If your new to wet shaving this combo is a great starter. You can get the Arko sticks cheaper if you buy in bulk but I can&#x27;t see the need to have 12 stick unless you really love Arko. There&#x27;s so many great soaps out there that having some variety is what makes wet shaving such a great hobby.&lt;br /&gt; With that said this is a good combo. Arko is a nice soap for the price. the smell is industrial but for quick shaves using it to face lather nothing beats it in terms of speed. Wet your face, rub all over the whiskers and rub it in with your brush. In less than 30 seconds your face will be full of rich lather. It also performs nicely. Of course the more expensive creams do work better. They also smell better, but your not going to get a shave this quick and cheap that doesn&#x27;t leave your face feeling like it got whipped with a belt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The alum block is what saves my face. After running a sharp blade across your skin you create tiny micro cuts. Your skin needs something to disinfect and sooth those cuts. Rinse your face with cold water and wet the block. Run it all along your freshly shaved skin. If you did a good job you feel a cool block. If you used to much pressure a sting is waiting but it&#x27;s also comforting to know that it will go away quickly and the razor burn that would normally last for hours will not happen.That&#x27;s what makes this block magic, it does really get rid of razor burn.</li>
    <li> Lathers nicely, it&#x27;s very affordable, and lasts a long time. The alum block does is job. What more can you ask for?</li>
    <li> Arko shaving soap stick. I have recently switched back to a double edge razor after 20 year of using an electric razor. I was done buying $200 razors that just didn&#x27;t do the job. This shaving soap was cheap and has tallow in it so I thought it would be very slippery and help with my razor. The product is excellent and I really like the ease of it. I wet my face and apply the soap stick directly to my face and neck, them with a wet boar bristle brush I lather it right on my face. Very quick and easy. The brush holds enough soap and foam for the next pass and even the third pass if I wanted. I like this soap so much I bought a 12 pack, which should last more than a year for sure. The Alum block is very nice and a good travel size. I use a larger one every day after I get out of the shower and before my pores close. I slide the block over my face and let it dry on my face. It has stopped all razor burns and small nicks completely. Great combo for a really great price. You will like it and want more for sure. I also have read about the scent of Arko, not sure what everyone is thinking here but it smells like saving soap. Not a lavender soap but a shaving soap. Manly not girly!!!</li>
    <li> Soap produces amazing lather and the alum block feels great after a shave.  Highly recommend to anyone who wants a quality shave.</li>
    <li> The alum is what I expected. The shaving soap didn&#x27;t smell very good and didn&#x27;t work as good as my other shaving products. I just chucked it in the trash.</li>
    <li> A basic,industrial scented shaving stick. Makes good lather &amp; provides good cushion when bowl or face lathering.&lt;br /&gt;The alum block is just that. It should last for a long time</li>
    <li> Good block of alum.  I don&#x27;t know what else to say about it.  This is my first block.  It does its job.  I haven&#x27;t tried the shaving stick yet though.</li>
    <li> Just getting into DE shaving.  This is a great value as a starter shave soap and alum block.  Some don&#x27;t care for Arko&#x27;s sent, but I think its just fine.  If your looking to get into DE shaving and don&#x27;t want to break the bank this a nice place to start.</li>
