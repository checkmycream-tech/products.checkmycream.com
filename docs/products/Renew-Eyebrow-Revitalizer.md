      <li>I had NO eyebrows for more than a year.</li>
      <li>Looking at the vial of oil, almost all of it spilled out with it&#x27;s original security plastic still intact!  </li>
      <li>I have even been able to skip filling them in with a pencil and it still looks fine.</li>
      <li>I have tried many products for my lashes and they have worked and I have long beautiful lashes.  </li>
      <li>I used it for one box worth and my eyebrows filled in nicely.  </li>
      <li>Very glad to find it available on line and definitely worth paying the slightly higher price.</li>

      <li>downside is that this product is kind of gross.</li>
      <li>worth every penny and</li>
      <li>i remember when my brows were 100 percent filled in and NORMAL</li>
      <li>and I us it exactly , didn&#x27;t recommend It.</li>
      <li>It has been a long time since I&#x27;ve been able to do that!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>This really works.  </li>
      <li>This product really worked for me.</li>
      <li>I had used this product for over 3 months and there was absolutely zero improvement to the denseness of my brows.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t see any result after using out the whole bottle.</li>
      <li>I really hoped this would work</li>
      <li>I guess the good news is that at least it didn&#x27;t take any hair out.  </li>
      <li>It arrived in the original packaging but there was oil all over the outside of the package and</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t grow a whole new brow but it does fill in</li>
      <li>I am older and maybe its just part of age.  </li>
      <li>and I also use it on my eyebrows and I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>This product works and I highly recommend it to those who are patient as you may not see results until after a month.</li>
      <li>At first i thought it was just different packaging</li>
      <li>I found eyebrow pencils were a hassle and never looked natural.</li>
      <li>I used the whole bottle and my eyebrows are the same.  </li>
      <li>, do not waste your money.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d looked at similar products but always bulked at the high price...</li>
      <li>the bottle is always oily even though I always clean it off, and the shelf where it is stored always has a small pool of oil around the place where the bottle is stored.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I have a couple of bare spots in one of my brows</li>
      <li>Not sure if this is true of everyone</li>

<li> I have a small scar on my left eyebrow which I&#x27;ve had for years and because of it hair has never grown there</li>

<li> This product is a waste of money.</li>

<li> But icky.</li>
<li> but I noticed my brows and lashes began to thin if I discontinued use of this product.</li>
<li> I am having a hard time getting intouch with the company for a replacement..very dissapointed!!</li>
<li> Ill be returning it.</li>
<li> /&gt;This is a useless product, try something else.</li>
<li> The worst part is that the product does irritate the skin, and your brows remain extremely &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; until you wash it off.  </li>

    <li> I applied the Renew Eyebrow Revitalizer as directed on the package and NOTHING!  My eyebrows stayed skimpy.  This product is a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I have though that this was just too keep this company in business.  It is outstanding and would recommend to anyone that has this problem with their eyebrows.</li>
    <li> I had a severe eczema outbreak on my face for a few months, and it decimated my eyebrow hair. I had NO eyebrows for more than a year. Although the eczema cleared up my eyebrow hair refused to grow back, and I was stuck mourning the loss of eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I began using this product about two and half weeks ago, and I&#x27;ve seen the gradual return of my eyebrow hair. It&#x27;s not a lot and it&#x27;s not fast, but the growth is there. It&#x27;s working for me. Note: the product is expensive, and the glass container breaks fairly easily. Especially if you leave it on the edge of your bathroom sink...</li>
    <li> im 23 and when i was 21 i remember trying to look all over the net for sumthing for my over plucked and partually shaved eyebrows becuz i used to draw them on and so my brows were just a hott mess and i thought well i dont have alot of money and id like it to work in at least a month and i thought this stuff may work but i wasint sure i wasint opptimistic at first becuz im alwayz a lil cynicall until it proves a working product for sure..so i tried this and litrally in a month and a half maybe less my brows transformed and i didint have to fill them in anymore i was Shocked that it worked so quickly and for so lil money and it only took one bottle and that thing lasted me almost 6 months if not longer becuz i remember when my brows were 100 percent filled in and NORMAL i still had sum of this stuff left and i used it every nite on my lashes and eyebrows its amazing and ima def buy it again as my brows have been falling out again:( so ya Love this stuff it 100 percent works trust me! worth every penny and this stuff saved my self esteme !</li>
    <li> I picked up this product in a discount store and yes it does work!  I was using castor oil to grow my brows and castor oil worked before but did not work this time.  It has only been 5 days since I started using this and I see my brows growing in! I&#x27;m so glad I picked it up. I have not used it on my lashes yet but I will:)</li>
    <li> My eyebrows have hair where it was missing after using this product. It&#x27;s oil, so you would only want to use it at night before bed. It doesn&#x27;t grow a whole new brow but it does fill in</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d looked at similar products but always bulked at the high price...I found most started at $100 or more. I originally found this product at a discount store and decided to give it a try and was really happy with the results. Very glad to find it available on line and definitely worth paying the slightly higher price. I&#x27;m 48 and have struggled with thinning eyebrows for years and recently noticed my lashes thinning. I found eyebrow pencils were a hassle and never looked natural. Same with false eyelashes. I use this product on both my lashes and brows nightly. I noticed a difference in both after about a month. After three months, both my brows and lashes are full. Not sure if this is true of everyone but I noticed my brows and lashes began to thin if I discontinued use of this product. Great price and ingredients so no reason not to use it on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t  see any defiant I us it for tow week, my I brow same  length&lt;br /&gt;I read  the direction  and I us it exactly , didn&#x27;t recommend It.</li>
    <li> Sorry to rate this so low but for me, it didn&#x27;t work.  I used the whole bottle and my eyebrows are the same.  I used it as directed, in the morning and evening.  There wasn&#x27;t any type of growth.  I guess the good news is that at least it didn&#x27;t take any hair out.  I can only say that it didn&#x27;t work for me but it might work on someone else.</li>
    <li> Can not give this any stars because it did not work for me.  I am older and maybe its just part of age.  I have tried many products for my lashes and they have worked and I have long beautiful lashes.  But I think eyebrow are harder to grow.  Don&#x27;t think you should spend your money on this.</li>
    <li> I bought this product from winners for $4.99 to see what all the fuss was about. I have a small scar on my left eyebrow which I&#x27;ve had for years and because of it hair has never grown there so I&#x27;ve always had a gap on my left eyebrow. After using this product, my eyebrows have been filled and are fuller. I am a great believer in this product and have included it in my nightly beauty regime. The only thing its taken about a month to see results. I have been using it now for about three months and I also use it on my eyebrows and I highly recommend this product. This product works and I highly recommend it to those who are patient as you may not see results until after a month.</li>
    <li> I have bought and gone through two of the eyebrow oils. I loved them, they worked great, really got them to grow so that i could reshape my brows. However, this time i ordered i got something different. I got the revitalizer not the oil. At first i thought it was just different packaging but now i realize they are completely different. Not sure if ive been ripped off or not but it has almost an expired mascara smell to it. Kind of dont even want to try this one. Ill be returning it.</li>
    <li> I really hoped this would work but it didn&#x27;t. I guess it is not for everyone... I didn&#x27;t see any result after using out the whole bottle.</li>
    <li> complete waste of money, did nothing at all, do not recommend to anyone.  Did not see a difference after using as directed</li>
    <li> Been using for a few weeks and have not yet seen any noticable results. Will continue to use the product as it may take a bit longer than I expected.</li>
    <li> I was excited to receive and try the product but when I opened the package, I noticed it felt oily.  Looking at the vial of oil, almost all of it spilled out with it&#x27;s original security plastic still intact!  The manufacturer has somehow managed to produce a defective product and now I am stuck with something I paid for and it&#x27;s almost empty!  I am having a hard time getting intouch with the company for a replacement..very dissapointed!!</li>
    <li> This product does not work.  I used this product for 6 weeks and there were no results, do not waste your money.</li>
    <li> This really works.  I used it for one box worth and my eyebrows filled in nicely.  They lasted for a few years before I needed another box for touch ups.</li>
    <li> This product really worked for me. After using this product my eyebrows have fully grown it took about 3 weeks but after about a week i saw results. I give this a 4 star and not a 5 because i wasnt satisfied with how oily it was. But it works great</li>
    <li> I had used this product for over 3 months and there was absolutely zero improvement to the denseness of my brows.  The worst part is that the product does irritate the skin, and your brows remain extremely &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; until you wash it off.  When I put it on in the morning, at some point I would unintentionally wipe my brows with my fingers and I get a finger full of grease.  If you sweat, the oil could drip into your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a useless product, try something else.</li>
    <li> Did nothing whatsoever, and of course I&#x27;m past the return date.</li>
    <li> I have not yet used this product for the recommended 4-6 weeks but have already seen nice results after just a couple of weeks. I am anticipating that I will be even happier with the results after using it for the full 4-6 weeks recommended by the manufacturer. I&#x27;ve tried other products with little success. I have a couple of bare spots in one of my brows and I am definitely seeing fuller brows- I have even been able to skip filling them in with a pencil and it still looks fine. It has been a long time since I&#x27;ve been able to do that!&lt;br /&gt;The downside is that this product is kind of gross. It arrived in the original packaging but there was oil all over the outside of the package and some of the product was gone even though it was sealed. This continues to be an issue- the bottle is always oily even though I always clean it off, and the shelf where it is stored always has a small pool of oil around the place where the bottle is stored.&lt;br /&gt;I will put up with this messiness issue because I like the product. But icky.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work the way advertised.</li>
</ol>
