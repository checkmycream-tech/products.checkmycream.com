      <li>That&#x27;s when I started getting better results!  </li>
      <li>I have heard it isn&#x27;t permanent and that is fine, I&#x27;m happy to touch up once in a while.</li>
      <li>I can see changes in all areas that I have treated, with AMAZING results on my legs, which I was NOT expecting.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t know if they liked it.  </li>
      <li>It is very easy to use.</li>
      <li>It is very easy to use.</li>
      <li>far, I am very impressed!  </li>
      <li>I shave right before using this product as it states in the manual for great results.</li>
      <li>Things have become interesting.  </li>
      <li>, we asked how an \\&quot;unauthorized company\\&quot; would be able to get the product to sell, they said \\&quot;we don&#x27;t know how they are getting it\\&quot;.  </li>
      <li>I am treating my course mustache and chin hairs specifically, as this has caused me the most trauma.</li>
      <li>So hopefully I will have better results on the 7th treatment.</li>
      <li>Ok, this is playing into the planned obsolescence, which I don&#x27;t like, but I&#x27;d rather replace the head then</li>
      <li>I was well expecting to have regrowth by day 6, but lo and behold, my legs were still smooth!  </li>
      <li>bought my devise on ebay, but am leaving a review on as many sites as i can to help my fellow furry sisters out.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Also, if your hair is hormonal (PCOS, hairs that sprout as you age), you can be getting more activated hair follicles over time even as you are in treatment.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Answer was: YES! :)&lt;</li>
      <li>I am absolutely in love with this product.</li>
      <li>I have been using it for a short time, but I am impressed.  </li>
      <li>This is one of the most waranty products I ever try.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>If you are hesitant, make sure you purchase this from an approved seller so if it doesn&#x27;t work you can return it.</li>
      <li>Love it, Love it, Love it.</li>
      <li>Refills are not cost effective but easily available.</li>
      <li>okay</li>
      <li>then after i placed the otder, i went to trusty amazon to check out reviews on it and seen it for a lot cheaper, free shipping (with prime) and no tax!</li>
      <li>I think my results would be even better if I did.</li>
      <li>Already it&#x27;s looking so much better</li>
      <li>Of course some areas of body need more attention than others.</li>
      <li>Will try and use more this week.</li>
      <li>and my skin is still smooth!</li>
      <li>What I noticed was that results are pretty good- provided you keep up treatments.</li>
      <li>Its very easy to use and not painful.</li>
      <li>Really happy with this unit so far.</li>
      <li>I really wanted to have a good money-back guarantee in case the machine didn&#x27;t work since it&#x27;s not cheap!&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is easy to use and you see immediate results.</li>
      <li>The biggest reason for purchasing the machine was my chin &#x27;whiskers&#x27; are still growing strong.  </li>
      <li>It gets pretty warm; I&#x27;d call it a 2 on a pain scale of 1 to 10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>At first, I used as directed 1x/week; now, I use more than once per week but eased into it to make sure my skin wouldn&#x27;t have an issue.</li>
      <li>I owned an E-ONE and it too is an IPL and worked fine.</li>
      <li>I follow with the light therapy and either coconut oil, or bio oil.</li>
      <li>I have light skin and light hair.  </li>
      <li>Smooth for over a year.</li>
      <li>(though I took a break in the middle).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 2 days, my legs were still smooth, which I chalked up to the epilating.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only had it for 4 weeks and seems to be working great.</li>
      <li>Having a lovely chin and neck is WELL WORTH</li>
      <li>I have seen Me Smooth commercials, but it was not until I read reviews here that I decided to purchase the item.  </li>
      <li>I have used the Me Smooth 6-7 times and it has slowed my hair growth.  </li>
      <li>My lower legs are now about 95% hair free; completed my 6th treatment yesterday.  </li>
      <li>I follow with the light therapy and either coconut oil, or bio oil.</li>
      <li>Shaving caused stubble almost instantly, the wait time to wax was unacceptable, threading is great</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had issues with course chin hair since my early twenties, and nothing was a good solution.</li>
      <li>I went up to high on my legs, which again, was warm, but zero pain.  </li>
      <li>Its not something you need to plan, as i had originally thought, it takes minutes.</li>
      <li>On my legs just to see significant hair loss i have not shaved them all week.</li>
      <li>I still have the original cartridge as well.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I am still very pleased with the results so far.  </li>
      <li>and I can&#x27;t tell you how excited I am about the results.</li>
      <li>I am sure the lasers are better at a professional laser salon, but I really like being able to do this on my schedule.  </li>
      <li>Special bonus</li>
      <li>Also note that my cartridge reached 50% capacity after my 4th use which covers passing the unit 3x&#x27;s with each use on full legs (thigh to feet), underarms and face.  </li>
      <li>My underarm hair is much darker, so I assumed that it would respond better.  </li>
      <li>but it really does work so much better.</li>
      <li>not bad at all.</li>
      <li>a quick background of my situation</li>
      <li>Have not had time to use it much but so far so good.</li>
      <li>Again, my underarms are the perfect laser canditate (light skin, dark hair), so I expected better results that</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t had the me smooth for even a full month yet, but my experience has been so overwhelmingly positive that I was inspired to leave this glowing</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s painless, fast, and easy.</li>
      <li>that I can forget my foundation/cover up and still feel pretty!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve decided to use my Me Smooth for my underarms, an area I don&#x27;t care too much about.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve decided to use my Me Smooth for my underarms, an area I don&#x27;t care too much about.</li>
      <li>But the me smooth device goes FAST.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I myself usually read the reviews before purchasing anything.&lt;br /&gt;I bought tjis 4 month s ago and its working as it promises.  Of course some areas of body need more attention than others. In general I like it and recomend it.</li>
    <li> if u have dark hair and light skin like I do it shud work. its DOES NOT work. I owned an E-ONE and it too is an IPL and worked fine. THIS is a complete and utter WASTE of MONEY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;bottom line is it just isnt powerful enough.</li>
    <li> Does not work. I used this for months with no result. I used 3-4 cartridges and followed the instructions to the letter. I decided to let my hair grow out to see whether it&#x27;d worked--you&#x27;d think that I was a bear if you were to see my legs now. The biggest waste of money ever! And the manufacturer&#x27;s customer service is non-existent.</li>
    <li> Works okay but you really need to use it once a week as instructed. I did see the hair getting thinner and decrease in amount with regular use. I have not kept up with it well over time to know long term results. It is very easy to use. Refills are not cost effective but easily available.</li>
    <li> Really works!  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 1/2 year and none of my hair is gone. The hair does grow back slower but isn&#x27;t gone at all. Doesn&#x27;t even work on peach fuzz. The next day after using the hair actually seems like it grew back in faster so the next day I shave and pluck again and then it seems to come back a little slower but is always back again. I feel that I&#x27;ve been ripped off. I purchased mine from Costco. It just makes me feel sad like something is wrong with me like I must be a gorilla but honestly I&#x27;m not that hairy so it should work.</li>
    <li> I am a calico redhead. I have white, blonde, auburn, orange, brown, and even a few dark brown hairs. I am treating my course mustache and chin hairs specifically, as this has caused me the most trauma. I am a real woman with a real issue that I have been dealing with for 15 years. As you can imagine, my skin has suffered immensely. When I do have a hair free face, my skin is scarred and pink. I do not have PCOS, or any other hormonal imbalance. My condition is idiopathic. Because I know first hand how debilitating this issue is, I want to be able to help out anyone I possibly can. That said, I have found some improvement and maintainence using saw palmetto, chastetreeberry, and dong quai regularly. (These help to balance hormones, and even though my doctor claimed my hormone levels came back normal, this has helped me. not sure the reasoning behind this.)&lt;br /&gt;I called customer service number I found on the mepower.com website to ask a couple questions.&lt;br /&gt;First question was- Can I use the device on my face WITHOUT using the precision adapter?&lt;br /&gt;Answer was: YES! :)&lt;br /&gt;Second- Can I use the device on my face daily?&lt;br /&gt;Answer was: YES! (I am aware of the three growing stages and that this MAY not be necessary, BUT: I am desperate and willing to try anything)&lt;br /&gt;Third question was- How much time do I have between when the hair is removed and when I zap it?&lt;br /&gt;Answer was: 5-10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;I asked this last question because I have to pluck out alot of my coarser hairs individually, as they are just too tough to be removed by my epilator alone (one I have had for years, not their epilating adapter).&lt;br /&gt;I bought my devise on ebay, but am leaving a review on as many sites as i can to help my fellow furry sisters out.&lt;br /&gt;I promise to keep my progress up to date.&lt;br /&gt;So far, I have done four treatments in the past week and I am almost hesitant to say anything, but I do think its slowed the growth down. too soon to give a final review, but... again, I PROMISE TO UPDATE.&lt;br /&gt;Good luck! &amp;lt;3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE** 17 days later: 2/21/15&lt;br /&gt;I have maintained a daily regime for tackling the girlstache from hell. At full power, I will flash my upper lip and chin usually 3, sometimes 4, times. I have also purchased a LED light therapy system with red, green, and blue lights to help with my pigmentation issues. wow. i have truely noticed a difference in both my skin tone, and the amount of hair i have to pluck daily. I would say its been about a 50% reduction in hair growth thus far, so it seems anyway. I tweeze and epliate the area directly before treatmet. I follow with the light therapy and either coconut oil, or bio oil. feeling pretty ;) yay!7 days later: 2/21/15  I have maintained a daily regime for tackling the girlstache from hell.

    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this device three times, so it would be inaccurate to give it a full review yet, but so far I like it. Its very easy to use and not painful. I tried the tria before a few years ago and that thing was awful- took forever and crapped out halfway through the advertised lifespan, and customer service was bad. But the me smooth device goes FAST. Like shaving. Haven&#x27;t noticed a visual reduction yet, and I still have to shave every day, but the shaving seems to be smoother and faster when I do it. If that is the only difference I ever see, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s worth it. But they say you have to use it 7 times before you see a difference, and I&#x27;ve only used it 3 so far, so I&#x27;ll have to give an update after four more uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: this thing is great! I used to have to shave every day, and if I didn&#x27;t, I&#x27;d get ingrowns, bumps, etc. after using this about 12 times, the hair is much less. I can go a few days without shaving and it&#x27;s still smooth the next time I do. Plus, i have bald spots! a lot of them! The first cartridge I went through only lasted 7 times, and it went down to 50% after 3 uses. This second one I have used 5 times already, and it&#x27;s still at 100%, which tells me that there is less hair for it to kill. Keep in mind that every time I use this thing, it is on the high setting, and I use it everywhere (bikini, upper lip, etc). It doesn&#x27;t hurt at all. I have been forgetting to use it every week, so I think my results would be even better if I did. Also, I have really pale skin and black hair, so I can&#x27;t comment on how well it works on other skin tones and hair colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final update:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The basic summary is that this device is still worth the price. However, there is clearly a big difference between the effectiveness of this device and professional lasers, which I haven&#x27;t tried, but would love to if I could ever afford it. What I noticed was that results are pretty good- provided you keep up treatments. If you lessen the frequency of treatments like they recommend, hair growth just goes back to normal after a while. I am a hairy person, so if I use that thing 2-3 times a week (maybe only once some weeks), I really like the results. Once I start using it only once a month, my hair growth is back to its normal rate in just a few months :( The downside to that is that you have to keep paying for those $50 cartridges. The good news is that with frequent use, you consistently have less hair and so the cartridges last longer over time. (My first cartridge only lasted for 4 sessions! Now they last me 10-12). Again, I don&#x27;t think these home systems will ever rival a professional treatment, so if you have the money and time to invest in really going hair-free, go professional! If, like me, you don&#x27;t have the money or time but you want to not have to shave your Sasquatch legs every 12 hours just to keep them barely presentable, then this device definitely helps that problem enough to make it worth the purchase price. I still highly recommend it, but with the caveat that you just keep up the frequency of treatments until such time as you win the lottery and can afford professional ones.</li>
    <li> Bought as Xmas present.  Don&#x27;t know if they liked it.  Seems to be ok.&lt;br /&gt;But expensive for a hair remover product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 63yrs old and wish I would of bought this years ago. Have used it 4-5weeks now and hardly no hair growing back. I&#x27;m going to begin using it every 2weeks instead of weekly. I bought one for my daughter also.</li>
    <li> You can really see this work. Use to spend $125 to have this done now I do it at home without having to make an appointment great amazon product</li>
    <li> It works well on some hairs and not some. It works for me on my legs, forearms, stomach and bikini. It does not work at all on my armpits or chin hairs. I think it may be the stubbornness of some hairs. Even on my legs there are a few strands that won&#x27;t give up the fight to live. I say give it a try and it may or may not work for the hair you are trying to get rid of. (For me bikini, and it worked there.)</li>
    <li> I never write a review but I had to share. This is easy to use and you see immediate results. must have!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this product from a different place (not Amazon) and I came to Amazon to check out reviews. There were mixed reviews from others but for myself, I can truly say that this product worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very coarse and dark hair and medium-dark skin. I used it on my hands and arms, as well as on my face. In one treatment, I have almost no visible hair on my upper lip. It has been two weeks and I only see a few tiny, barely visible hair follicles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for my hands and arms, it&#x27;s a process. I&#x27;ve been doing it for several weeks and if I miss a spot, the hair isn&#x27;t removed on that spot. I took a few weeks break to see if any hair was growing back and what I discovered was this-- that I had some very visible areas on my arm where hair was growing back and other areas where it wasn&#x27;t at all, which told me that the product actually permanently got rid of hair in those places. As for the places where the hair was growing, they were hard-to-reach places on my arms that I didn&#x27;t spend much time on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sum up, if you take the time and go over and over the areas again with the product, it works. If you&#x27;re just skimming it over yourself and not sitting there for potentially half an hour, you won&#x27;t reap the benefits.</li>
    <li> Please be warned...First and foremost, the product DOES NOT WORK.  My husband and I have both used it for over six weeks, as directed, and have seen zero results from it.  We invested $375 in the unit, and two additional cartridges, and it was a total waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We purchased this product from BESTSELLER21 as they had the best price and free shipping.  Come to find out, they are NOT an authorized seller of the product and the company automatically VOIDS THE WARRANTY AND RETURN POLICY on products sold by them.  The funny thing is, EVERY seller (29 total!!) on Amazon is listed on the companies website as unauthorized!!  Therefore, ALL sellers warranties are voided!!  When we called the company and they told us this, we asked how an \\&quot;unauthorized company\\&quot; would be able to get the product to sell, they said \\&quot;we don&#x27;t know how they are getting it\\&quot;.  Hmmm, you&#x27;re the manufacturer of the product and you don&#x27;t know how TWENTY NINE COMPANIES are getting it, and offering YOUR PRODUCT for sale??  If it smells like rotten fish...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, THIS IS A SCAM!  They are selling a useless product through \\&quot;unathorized retailers\\&quot; so they never have to deal with a warranty or return issue!  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!</li>
    <li> It slowly works removing body hair, after several applications. As for facial hair, it seems to make it worse!</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with this product and service.</li>
    <li> it works really well. I am happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I have just used the Elos machine for the 4th time and it seems that the leg hair is lessening but my &#x27;whiskers&#x27; seem to be continuing as before.  The biggest reason for purchasing the machine was my chin &#x27;whiskers&#x27; are still growing strong.  I am hoping to get them under control soon because I hate shaving every day!  I hope to send another report that they are growing less often and softer.  Jury is still out!</li>
    <li> This review is only on product not on seller..... I purchased this product in December 2013.  I have been using it for almost 5 months now.  I use every week and although hair growth has slowed down some it has by no means stopped it.  I have light skin and light hair.  It does not work on my face, legs, or under arms which hair is darker there.  I still have to shave every day under arms.  I see no significant difference by this machine and I even purchased the extra cartridge for 100,000 pluses.  I am going to use it all up but I am sure it is just a waste of time.  So save your money don&#x27;t waste $500 like I did.</li>
    <li> Have not had time to use it much but so far so good. Will try and use more this week.</li>
    <li> I HAVE HAD MINE FOR A MONTH AND STILL HAVE TO  SHAVE  ILL GIVE IT THE 7 WEEKS  THE MANUFACTURE SAYS IT  TAKES  AND IF IT DOSENT WORK  I WILL  RETURN IT AND GET  ALL MY  MONEY BACK !!! ILL  GET BACK IN A FEW WEEKS  AND TELL WHAT HAPPEND</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got blonde to medium brown hair, medium skin color and I&#x27;ve been using the Tanda Me Smooth for over a year. With some exceptions and a LOT of diligence I can report that it isn&#x27;t perfect, but it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Exceptions:&lt;br /&gt;Light blonde or white hairs, this thing can&#x27;t touch them, don&#x27;t bother trying. Alas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Diligence:&lt;br /&gt;After three months and only moderate results, I took some of the other reviewers advice and began epilating prior to flashing. Holy YOW! but it really does work so much better. Maybe its traumatizing the follicle and then finishing it off with the flash, but I went from 40% less hair to 80% less...and that&#x27;s underarms, bikini, and full legs kids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Routine:&lt;br /&gt;Week 1: Declare a spa day: Deep condition hair, do mani/pedi, eat Nutella. Scrub, epilate, then flash. You&#x27;ll still have to shave a few days later till epilation/flash efforts begin to bear fruit, but patience pays.&lt;br /&gt;Week 2: Repeat...stock up on Nutella&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After six months, you&#x27;ll have given up on the baby blonde hairs and only flash once a month in a vain attempt to get those last few stubborn buggers that nothing short of a nuke is going to kill, but mostly you&#x27;ll forget about the bad old days of worrying about stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results:&lt;br /&gt;Am I hairless? No. Have I gone from daily shaves to removing hair once a week? Yes. What grows in is very sparse and almost entirely blonde, so who cares! Could there be less hair from epilating alone? Nope. Been down that road years ago and did NOT have the results I&#x27;m seeing now. Special bonus: as you get less hair from flashing, it means less pain when epilating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why I chose this brand over others?:&lt;br /&gt;Larger treatment head&lt;br /&gt;Light handset corded to a base unit rather than an all in one handheld (imagine trying to do the back of your legs while holding something hefty)&lt;br /&gt;NOT cordless. The less parts that can fail the better, and rechargeable batteries are ALWAYS the firstto fail.&lt;br /&gt;Replaceable treatment heads. Ok, this is playing into the planned obsolescence, which I don&#x27;t like, but I&#x27;d rather replace the head then have the whole unit fail or loose effectiveness over time. These things are just too expensive.</li>
    <li> The internal packaging gave the appearance the content had been tampered with. The seller assured me it was new. Since I&#x27;ve only had the product a short time and haven&#x27;t completed the treatment process , I can&#x27;t comment on its effectiveness. Check with me in about 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> I have used the Me Smooth 6-7 times and it has slowed my hair growth.  I was having a lot of problems with ingrown hairs and razor rash.  I am not shaving as often and not having the problem with ingrown hairs.  I am sure the lasers are better at a professional laser salon, but I really like being able to do this on my schedule.  For the money, I think it is very good.</li>
    <li> I was able to use it for all of two days, and then this weird delay came about for when the light would go on - if at all (sometimes it timed out and turned off because it took too long; about a month later it wouldn&#x27;t flash at all no matter how many times I&#x27;d turned it back on (i.e., it timed out all the time)). And Tanda won&#x27;t provide warranty support. Don&#x27;t bother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;11/24/13 UPDATE: I learned that Tanda does not provide service under the product&#x27;s normal one-year warranty if the merchant that sold it is on a list of unauthorized merchants (at [...] Before buying it, I only noticed a much shorter list on the official site specifically about Tanda Me (as opposed to the general Tanda site). The merchant BESTSELLER21 is one of the unauthorized resellers on the longer list, and when I contacted it for help, noting that Tanda wouldn&#x27;t service the unit I bought from them, all I got in reply was: \\&quot;Dear customer sorry to hear this you would need to contact the manufacturer about this\\&quot; - WATCH OUT for BESTSELLER21. I&#x27;ve contacted Amazon.com about this, so we&#x27;ll see how things turn out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had laser hair treatments in the past on my face, so I bought this for touch-ups, but I&#x27;m now using it on legs, arm, etc. I&#x27;ve used this 4 times now and have seen a big decrease in hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;The cartridge doesn&#x27;t last very long but I&#x27;m doing a lot of areas</li>
    <li> I was skeptical, but this actually does work. I have darker hair/light skin, but very visible difference even after the first treatment. Took longer to grow back and finer. I read the advice of previous users- take your time, don&#x27;t move too fast. I would recommend!</li>
    <li> Still not convinced that this product works. I have used it for 7 weeks and do not see a noticeable difference in hair reduction.</li>
    <li> I will update this as my treatment progresses, but I&#x27;m starting to see results, so I felt compelled to start a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a quick background of my situation, I have light skin and dark hair under my arms and on the front of my legs, but the majority of my legs have blonde hair.  After much research, I decided on this laser because it is supossed to work on blonde hair.  Per the instructions, I also purchased the epilator attachment, but that was a waste of money, so I returned it.  I recommend buying a seperate epilator for about the same price that actually works (which is what I did after I returned the attachment).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, be prepared that your first treatment will be more of a practice run and may not yield results.  You&#x27;re scared that it will hurt (it doesn&#x27;t, scouts honor), you have no idea how to use the darn thing, etc.  I misunderstood the instructions and moved the laser as if I was shaving, never stopping.  I remember thinking, \\&quot;well, that sure is missing alot of spots between pulses!\\&quot; but just kept going.  I also only used the low power on my first run, and shaved my underarms and legs because the epilator attachement did not work.  Both legs and underarms twice probably took about 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few days, I noticed a small bald spot under one of my arms, which excited me, but absolutely no change on my legs.  Again, my underarms are the perfect laser canditate (light skin, dark hair), so I expected better results that what I saw.  I was slightly discouraged, but knew that I needed to give it more time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last week, I epilated my legs prior to treatment and shaved my underarms, as recommended per my hair types.  I turned the laser up to medium for my underarms, which was a bit warmer, but still no pain.  I went up to high on my legs, which again, was warm, but zero pain.  This time, I also went MUCH slower, and let laser pulse, AND THEN slid it up slightly, stopped, let it pulse again, and so on, which covered the areas MUCH, MUCH better.  I did two rounds on each leg and each armpit and my total treatment time was probably about 45 mintues (though I took a break in the middle).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 2 days, my legs were still smooth, which I chalked up to the epilating.  By day 4, I had a bit of stubble, so I shaved on the morning of day 5.  I was well expecting to have regrowth by day 6, but lo and behold, my legs were still smooth!  The hair had fallen out!  I had professional laser hair removal done on my bikini area years ago, so I knew what to expect, and this was exactly it!  Treatment&gt;hair grows back&gt; hair falls out&gt;new cycle of hair begins.  I am due for my 3rd treatment tomorrow (though I really feel like it is only my second proper treatment), and my legs are still pretty smooth.  I highly doubt that I will have much to epilate prior to lasering.  I also have large bald spots under my arms, which is exciting!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I am very impressed!  I will update further as I go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  I am due to complete my 4th treatment tomorrow.  Much to my surprise, my underarm hair (which is dark) is not responding nearly as well as my leg hair (which is blonde).  My underarm hair is much darker, so I assumed that it would respond better.  I have bald spots under my arms, and the hair that is growing back is much thinner and softer, but not as much as expected is actually gone.  I can say that I have still shaved my underarms daily. but the regrowth is slowing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for my legs, this gets a little more complicated.  I did an experiement last week and decided to do absolutely no hair removal after my laser treatment, so I have not shaved or epilated in a week.  I seem to have \\&quot;trouble spots\\&quot; that are not epilating well (mainly my left calf muscle and the front of my thighs, not sure why, but I cannot get the hair off of these spots!!!) so I have been shaving those spots prior to lasering.  Of the spots that I HAVE epilated sucessfully, they are all completely hair free, and I have not shaved these spots since my inital epilation almost 2 weeks ago!  I am sooo very happy about this!!!  My trouble spots have regrown hair, but the hair is softer and is growing in much more slowly.  As I said, I have not shaved in about a week, and the hairs are compareable to day 2 stubble.  I am hoping to epilate my trouble spots sucessfully tomorrow since the hairs are a bit longer than the last two times that I tried.  We shall see and I will keep you posted!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI- during my last treatment, my cartridge went down to the 50% indicator, so I ordered another one to be sure that I can complete my treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still very pleased with the results so far.  I can see changes in all areas that I have treated, with AMAZING results on my legs, which I was NOT expecting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE #2:  Sorry, I went on vacation and have not had a chance to update.  Things have become interesting.  My lower legs are now about 95% hair free; completed my 6th treatment yesterday.  There are only a few random hairs on the front and some high up near the back of my knee, but I also have some moles back there and am afraid to laser them, so that is likely why I&#x27;m not seeing 100% success there.  I have temporarily given up on my thighs as they are very time consuming and I am seeing very minimal results.  My cartridge started blinking empty at the end of my 5th treatment, before I forget to mention that.  I am THRILLED with the results on my lower legs!!!  I was certain that my blonde hair would not react, but it did!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My underarms...one is about 80% hair free, the other seems to still have just as much hair, though it does grow slower and softer.  Not sure why one side is taking and the other is not, but I shall press on.  Oh, and I upped the laser to high under my arms for the past 2 weeks.  It gets pretty warm; I&#x27;d call it a 2 on a pain scale of 1 to 10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is all for now.  I plan to finish the 7th and final session on my lower legs, try to get mroe gone under my arms, then maybe revisit my thighs as I don&#x27;t want to waste any more flashes where they don&#x27;t really seem to be working.</li>
    <li> Used for 7 weeks as directed and not a change in hair growth anywhere. Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> I got this over a year ago because Iam medium to dark skin toned, and it did nothing for hair removal.!&lt;br /&gt;I used it for months sometimes twice a day with no result.&lt;br /&gt;The only positive thing I can say is that it did not burn my skin or hurt to bad !</li>
    <li> I first bought this from sephora, it was 395, then after i placed the otder, i went to trusty amazon to check out reviews on it and seen it for a lot cheaper, free shipping (with prime) and no tax! so i returned it and got this in a few days. It is the same EXACT machine just cheaper. owell i wont get a silly point perk and free samples from spending 395.00 at their store. i have had this since about 7/15 and started using it once per week as suggested.&lt;br /&gt;But have recently learned my skin can handle it every few days instead of that. At first i was starting to worry that it would take too long to see results but honestly, I have REALLY seen results on my legs and underarms. On my legs just to see significant hair loss i have not shaved them all week. There are completely bald patches all over them. Some places there is hair regrowth but just to see the bald patches is literally awesome. I will continue to use this! The window flashes a large area at a time, so it does not take long to do a treatment at all. Its not something you need to plan, as i had originally thought, it takes minutes. i have been using it on my few stray hairs under my chin and it is hard to tell how effective it has been there though since after i flash, i tweeze so there may have been hair regrowth from hairs that were not before flashed. I keep wanting to not tweeze so i can tell if it is working but seeing darker hair come in against my pale skin makes me self conscious. Underarms I barely have to shave anymore which is really neat since i had to do that daily before. the cartridge shill shows 100%  full on the machine, so that is really cool since i was worried that i would only get a couple treatments out of the one cartridge. The flashes do not hurt! When it is on low, it feels room temperature, on medium it is warm, on high in a sensitive skin area it feels hot, not like a curling iron hot, like kinda close to a light bulb hot. not bad at all. It don&#x27;t pinch or sting at all on any setting and fades instantly. I have not tried high on bikini area or upper lip. Low setting for upper lip (one flash per side) with eyes closed 2 weeks in a row and i do not see any re growth as of yet and it has been about a week since last treatment. I hope my muttering helps someone!ting and fades instantly. I have not tried high on bikini area or upper lip. Low setting for upper lip (one flash per side) with eyes closed 2 weeks in a row and i do not see any re growth as of yet and it has been about a week since last treatment. I hope my muttering helps someone!</li>
    <li> Perfect delivery, and match as per my requierement, and perfect packaging. And Good quality and looks very nice plastic color, my wife love it. I am the home king now</li>
    <li> This machine is defective and sometimes just won&#x27;t work at all- the lights are on, but it won&#x27;t &amp;#34;zap&amp;#34;. not only that, but the cartridges seem to run out very quickly. I have used it on my lower legs maybe three times, about three times around the bikini area, and on a few whiskers. Out already.&lt;br /&gt;BestSeller 21 is not authorized so when I called for warranty services based on the stalling of the machine, I couldn&#x27;t get it. Waste of $275. I am going to contact Amazon directly about this scam, however, and see if I can get a refund.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this. I have to shave my legs pretty much every day and since I&#x27;ve been using this device in the last 2 months as recommended the hair on the insides of my legs are completely gone and it is significantly less overall. I don&#x27;t have to shave as often and I&#x27;m hopeful based on my results thus far that I&#x27;ll have 100% removal soon. I still have the original cartridge as well. I have heard it isn&#x27;t permanent and that is fine, I&#x27;m happy to touch up once in a while. It was expensive but when I think about how much I&#x27;ve probably spent on razors, shaving cream, waxing etc. this has gone to be less expensive in the long run. It is time consuming to do but I just do it when I&#x27;m relaxing after a long day reading or watching a little tv.</li>
    <li> No quality at all, as i throw my money to trash, rally disturbed</li>
    <li> I bought this item from MePower.com about a month ago. Very happy so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. No pain. Because I have had professional laser treatments done before, I was was anxious to see just how &amp;#34;painless&amp;#34; the sessions would be. I must say, I am amazed. The flashes are just warm (from the heat of the lamp inside the cartridge), I only felt a slight &amp;#34;snap&amp;#34; a few times, but other than that the experience was enjoyable. I do not mind going over the same area 3-4 times, since it does not hurt, and I think that helps to get better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Results. I have had 3 treatments so far. I did underarms, legs, bikini, and my arms. After the 1st treatment I noticed slower growth in all areas except for underarms. After 2 treatments the hair on my legs was so thin and blond, I could barely see it, although I could still feel a slight stubble. The hair on the arms grew back dark but much slower than before. The underarms and bikini didn&#x27;t have much of a change. After 3 treatments I cannot see any hair on the legs anymore, they look bare, and only if I look very, very closely I can see little blond stubble. Bikini and arms continue to grow dark, but show bold spots. Underarms grew back soft and semi-blond, but still quicker than hair on any other treated areas. So, I would say that the results are mixed, but I can see the progress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drawbacks:&lt;br /&gt;1. Machine overheats quickly (after doing 1 leg twice, for example), and I have to stop and wait for it to cool down to continue. That is annoying.&lt;br /&gt;2. Cartridges don&#x27;t last long. Yes, I am doing nearly full-body, but I would still expect them to last forever. Mine last only 2 treatments, and then I have to replace. Yet, it is still cheaper (not to mention painless!) than the salon laser treatments.</li>
    <li> I used this product for 8 months faithfully, at the end of the day the hairs kept coming back. Don&#x27;t waist your team...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had it for 4 weeks and seems to be working great. It&#x27;s painless, fast, and easy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars because I am on my 4th treatment and I only saw little reduction. So hopefully I will have better results on the 7th treatment.</li>
    <li> This is not permanent and they expect you to use it for ever. In that case this is much expensive than regular razor. I spent 4 cartridges just on legs, it was going good initially and I noticed bare patches but now hair is coming back again. Why spend so much money on something that is not permanent. Called Me Customer care and they showed no concern instead said I have to use it all the time and its not permanent. I do not recommend this, may be try the professionals that will at end be cheaper.</li>
    <li> Ive been using it for 3-4 months and haven&#x27;t seen any progress. I hair growth isn&#x27;t slowing down and it still looks the same. This was a waste...</li>
    <li> My very first laser treatment, terrible!!! Almost get shocked by the item. I plug in the restroom, sparks come out. I suspect it&#x27;s the moist of restroom. I try to plug in the bedroom, sparks come out again!!! I am horrified and told my husband. He said that is electricial leakage. Luckily I am chicken with this kind of product and only slightly plug in to test. Otherwise, I could get shocked. I can see the tip of the plug is burned into dark. Man, I&#x27;ll never dare to try these sort of products. Actually, I just try out the laser treatment in a beauty clinic. It&#x27;s awesome. No pain with low voltage and the lady told me that these home products&#x27; voltage is much lower than their machine. Probably only work for maintance, like the ones who have received laser treatment for a while, but not new user like me. Yet, not sure if this product even works at all.</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because I haven&#x27;t had this item long enough to see how well it works. It is very easy to use.</li>
    <li> It seemed like a great idea, as I had just lost my job, so I knew I&#x27;d have time to use it. Well, it&#x27;s too time consuming because you have to shave before you can actually use it. By week 3, you have to shave 3x per week, then week 4 is 4 times, etc. By week 7 I absolutely HATED shaving every day. I have since stopped using it.</li>
    <li> I am a realistic person and don&#x27;t even believe too much in review. So, I feel surprised at my self to even be writing this. This product delivers. I have done five sessions and I&#x27;ve seen 50% hair reduction and what was left over is softer and grows much slower. I am ordering my second lamp to complete my treatment. Love it, Love it, Love it. If you sufer from unwanted hair all over body hair, this product will service you well and save you lots of money and bost your confidence !!!</li>
    <li> I have faithfully followed the directions for 10 long weeks and I have yet to see one less hair.  This is a scam, it does NOT work!&lt;br /&gt;I am sorry I sunk money into this product I can&#x27;t afford to loose.  So, if you want to throw away your money on a product that fails to deliver, buy it but, you won&#x27;t like yourself in the morning.</li>
    <li> I never write reviews, but I rely on them when shopping online.  I haven&#x27;t had the me smooth for even a full month yet, but my experience has been so overwhelmingly positive that I was inspired to leave this glowing review- if you&#x27;re on the fence about whether or not to purchase, BUY IT! Now! I wish I had sooner!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used the me smooth 3 times and the results are dramatic. After the very first use, my underarm hair took a few days to get a little stubbly when normally I have a \\&quot;five-o&#x27;clock shadow\\&quot; by the end of one day.&lt;br /&gt;It has now been 4 days since I last shaved and used the me smooth, and there is almost no hair under my arms and my leg hair feels as though I shaved yesterday, and does not feel at all prickly but very fine and soft.  With results like these I can&#x27;t wait to finish my treatment!</li>
    <li> I am olive skinned with dark brown hair (biracial - black and white); I got laser on my chin and bikini (Brazilian) from a skin center about ten years ago and it did nothing except leave me $1,200 poorer! I&#x27;ve had issues with course chin hair since my early twenties, and nothing was a good solution. Shaving caused stubble almost instantly, the wait time to wax was unacceptable, threading is great but I can&#x27;t do it myself, and tweezing left me with ingrown hairs and scarring. The only options my dermatologist could give me were a hair suppressing cream (expensive and not permanent) or laser hair removal in her office ($$$!) She actually told me the ME Smooth would probably not work based on my previous response to laser hair removal. However, since my only other option was electrolysis which is very time consuming and expensive, I still really wanted to buy the ME. But the only decent price I could find was on amazon, and the seller wasn&#x27;t approved by the company. I really wanted to have a good money-back guarantee in case the machine didn&#x27;t work since it&#x27;s not cheap!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw this for sale at Costco for $270 + tax and went for it after scoping out this machine for a year; they have an excellent return policy. I have given myself 3 treatments, each about 6-7 days apart on 100% power. After the very first treatment, I noticed many hairs not growing back. I have one particular spot that is very visible and persistent, and due to plucking/ingrown hairs, I had dark hyperpigmentation there for 2+ years. That group of 2-3 hairs is now blessedly GONE, and the skin is quickly returning to normal texture and coloration. Each week I notice fewer hairs. Also, I like that you can epilate after treatment because the slightest bit of stubble (less than 1mm) will drive me crazy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t hurt, but will sometimes have a pinch feeling, like a rubber band snap. You may also smell burning hair, which is totally normal! I have so far only used this on my chin/ neck and upper lip (very fine hair) and am extremely happy with the results. I haven&#x27;t had lip hair regrow since the first treatment, even though the hairs there are very fine, and the progress of my dissapearing chin hair is such a relief. Having unwanted hair in a visible region is the worst and makes one feel very self-conscious. My scarring is going away very quickly, as are the horrible ingrown hairs, and I&#x27;m pretty sure that within the next two months I&#x27;ll have a normal looking chin/neck area. Already it&#x27;s looking so much better that I can forget my foundation/cover up and still feel pretty! Next I will be doing my underarms and bikini area (I wanted to save as much charge as possible for my chin, but now I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;ll be a problem).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I gave this a chance despite the bad reviews here (which are mostly about the seller). I can&#x27;t say how much of a God send this device is. It&#x27;s so quick to use - less than 5 minutes a week for the small areas I use it for. If you are hesitant, make sure you purchase this from an approved seller so if it doesn&#x27;t work you can return it. I can&#x27;t say how happy I am to own this machine. I am getting married next year, and I decided that a smooth neck and chin would be my beauty expense instead of paying a stylist/make-up artist to do my hair or makeup on the big day. Having a lovely chin and neck is WELL WORTH THE PRICE of the ME Smooth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 1/4/16: Unfortunately, I had to downgrade my review. The amount of regrowth I had on my chin and neck showed me that unfortunately, this is not the option for me, at least not for that particular area. I&#x27;ve decided to bite the bullet and go for electrolysis, which I&#x27;ve been doing for four months now. One of the things I&#x27;m learning is that laser can REDUCE hair, but is not FDA approved for permanent hair removal. Also, if your hair is hormonal (PCOS, hairs that sprout as you age), you can be getting more activated hair follicles over time even as you are in treatment. Even worse? Even electrolysis, which IS approved for permanent hair removal, will take about 10-18 months of bi-weekly treatment, since hairs do not always get killed right away, and hair growth cycles are constantly moving in and out of the treatable (growing) phases. I&#x27;ve decided to use my Me Smooth for my underarms, an area I don&#x27;t care too much about. I will update my review mid-year once I&#x27;ve been treating the area consistently.t. Even worse?

    <li> I bought this back in February for my husband&#x27;s back and my legs. I have been following the directions using it once a week on high treating the areas twice. I stopped treatment on my husband in August because there was no more dark hair but a month or so later the hair started to grow back! So I am now treating him again! I have not stopped on my legs since I bought it because I still have blonde hairs that require me to shave. Am I throwing good money away by continuing to use this product?????</li>
    <li> DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY , its not working at all!!!!</li>
    <li> Bought this at costco and all I can say is phew! Glad I did because I just took it back and got my $ back. We followed the directions and did it for 18 weeks once a week. Does it work? No not really. It becomes a very tedious task with an annoying strobe light! Yes hair became spotty and grew in a little bit slower but in the end you still need to shave. So what&#x27;s the point?</li>
    <li> Purchased to remove facial hair on upper lip and chin area. I have seen a slight decrease but nothing completely disappearing  yet after fives months of use. However, I started using on my underarms and about 90% of the hair has stop growing. At first, I used as directed 1x/week; now, I use more than once per week but eased into it to make sure my skin wouldn&#x27;t have an issue. Maybe results vary depending of skin and hair type even though brochure says results good with all skin/hair types. Maybe I can update review further down the road with better results on the face. I will definitely keep using until all pulses are used up-Still at 100% available.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product every Thursday for the past four weeks and I see a great reduction in hair growth. I used it on my arms, under arms, legs and bikini area last Wednesday and here it is Sunday and my skin is still smooth! WOW! normally my hair is half grown back in two days after shaving. I take my time when using this product. I glide it slowly on my skin with both bars touching my skin, but I never hold it still in one spot as it can damage my skin. I use this on high settings. I shave right before using this product as it states in the manual for great results. Trust me, it&#x27;s well worth investing in this product, just don&#x27;t buy it from an unauthorized seller otherwise you will get NO results!</li>
    <li> This is one of the most waranty products I ever try.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommended this product to every one.&lt;br /&gt;I got it on time. The customer services was excelent and on time</li>
    <li> I bought this product off Sephora but wanted to also leave a comment/review on here about the product. I am absolutely in love with this product. For the past 7 years, I spent each month waxing (spending probably well over $8000). It got expensive and never solved my problem. I&#x27;ve been using it every week and I can&#x27;t tell you how excited I am about the results. My arm hair is 90% gone and armpits and bikini are getting there. I can&#x27;t wait to never shave again!!!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen a decrease in my chin hairs.</li>
    <li> It really reduces the hair growing, but you should use it forever. I have already done clinical laser and I have to do periodic sessions. It&#x27;s the same with this.</li>
    <li> Used exactly per instructions, like clockwork, for seven weeks.  Spent the extra $200 for replacement cartridges.  (You&#x27;ll definitely need at least one or two replacements within seven weeks.)  Saw absolutely no results.  Seems to be a highly rated product, so perhaps it worked better for some other people.  Oh well.  It was worth a shot.</li>
    <li> Perhaps this works well for women who have a lot of hair. I&#x27;ve never been that hairy, but wanted to do the bikini area, legs and underarms. I&#x27;ve been using it 1xweek religiously now for over 4 months (i.e. 16 sessions) with very little noticeable change. I keep thinking that if I give it a few more weeks it&#x27;ll work. There does seem to be a very slight reduction in hair on the legs. If there is a reduction in the underarm or bikini area it is too slight to discern. Very disappointing. Since I&#x27;ve missed the window to return, I&#x27;ll keep going till the bulb burns out. Right now I&#x27;m below 50%. Very hard call, since I&#x27;ve invested so much. When does one give up?</li>
    <li> purchased this for Christmas and used it faithfully once a week for about 4 weeks (recommended usage is once a week for 7 weeks).  Although I still have hair growth, it is very sparse, finer and takes longer for it to grow back.  I have started the treatments again and can&#x27;t wait for the results to improve.  I am a 43 year old Puerto Rican female who had to shave daily.  My skin tone is golden tan tone with dark black hair.  Also note that my cartridge reached 50% capacity after my 4th use which covers passing the unit 3x&#x27;s with each use on full legs (thigh to feet), underarms and face.  Really happy with this unit so far.</li>
    <li> my wife use without result, we spend money on additional parts for nothing</li>
    <li> I used this product for two weeks prior to return. I started on the low setting as suggested and it felt fine. I decided to up the flashes to medium/high setting...it was really uncomfortable. It doesn&#x27;t feel at all like a rubber band snapping as others have suggested. I don&#x27;t know if I got a defective product but it felt like it was BURNING my skin. I used it in different places to test but it was horrible. It felt like it burned everywhere the light flashed on any setting other than low. For $277 bucks, the machine was loud, looked and felt cheaply made. I&#x27;m disappointed because I really wanted this product to work out. It seemed like the only semi-permanent hair reduction solution for dark complected skin.</li>
    <li> Below is my initial review.  The company has been great responding with me, however, it seems the technology is not working for me.  I am rating 3 stars since the company has been so responsive to my emails and it just may not work on everyone.  I used as instructed from October to January and only had results on my legs below knees.  It was not worth the price since that area was at the bottom of my hair removal wish list. I am thankful that I bought this unit at a store with a liberal return policy! The unit operated the entire time and I only went through one cartridge and was simple to use. The company responds quickly and professionally. If you purchase where you can return, it is worth a try. Everyone is different and it just turned out that this didn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is working, but taking longer than the 7 weeks.  I am 3 months at this time.  Hair on legs (below knees) seems to have stopped growing.  Bikini line still needs more time, but there is a lot less.  Underarm area and \\&quot;menopause face\\&quot; still not satisfied, but believe there is improvement.  I contacted the company at about week 8 or 9 since the 7 week mark had passed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this response the next day:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apologize you are not experiencing your desired results. It can take longer than 7 weeks for some people however most start to see a reduction in hair growth around week 3 such as thinner hair and slower hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would be happy to go over treatment protocol for you.&lt;br /&gt;What areas are you treating?&lt;br /&gt;What color is the hair?&lt;br /&gt;How are you removing the hair?&lt;br /&gt;What level are you treating on?&lt;br /&gt;Are you gliding the device or waiting for the pulse before you move?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;Nichole&lt;br /&gt;Customer Care&lt;br /&gt;380 Jamieson Parkway, Unit 11 | Cambridge, ON  N3C 4N4&lt;br /&gt;O +1 (877) 651 1177 | F +1 (519) 651 2277&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went over my treatment and promptly received this response:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Treatment protocol for the ME is once a week for 7 weeks. Because facial hair tends to grow faster than body hair you are able to treat every other day on the face.&lt;br /&gt;If you are treating dark hair such as brown or black we recommend to shave prior to treatment; for light colored hair we recommend to wax or epilate directly before treating.&lt;br /&gt;Please treat using a slow continuous gliding motion; you should not be waiting for the pulse before gliding the device. Please go over each desired area 2-3 times per treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Typically people start to notice thinner hair or slower hair growth around the third treatment to indicate that the technology is going to work for them.

    <li> I have suffered with having bad skin, and having a full but light beard since I was a teenager.  I have spent thousands of dollars on laser treatment, prescriptions, otc skincare, and  I only had short term results.  I am African-American, my skin tone is caramel,  but I suffer from hyperpigmentation,razor bumps, and old/New acne scars.  At the 1st of the year I decided I was going to commit to a skin regime,  which has improved my skin texture greatly, but I still needed laser hair removal.  I have seen Me Smooth commercials, but it was not until I read reviews here that I decided to purchase the item.  I am so glad I did!  I had to shave my face and neck everyday, after 3 treatments I am only shaving my chin area, and that hair is sparse and thin!  I have been using it for a short time, but I am impressed.  I never write reviews but I had to a least help another woman who has similar issues.  This works!  I set it to high and go over my problem areas 3x, once a week.</li>
