      <li>(OK, OK...  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s still not terrible and it does what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
      <li>Love this product thats</li>
      <li>/&gt;Smell is one of the senses most closely connected with memory.</li>
      <li>so i love it.</li>
      <li>I love the way the product smells.</li>
      <li>They just love it.</li>
      <li>For that reason I cannot use many of the stuff out there</li>
      <li>The men in the family swear it smells more like a combination of watermelon and kiwi, but still not overpowering or too feminine.</li>
      <li>cologne\\&quot; smell like so many men&#x27;s products do.</li>
      <li>I love the Fiji and Denali scent.</li>
      <li>I love the freshness of this product.</li>
      <li>It smells great during the whole day.</li>
      <li>The palm tree essence is quite titillating and refreshing.</li>
      <li>This product  has always met my expectations and I love their choice of fragrances.  </li>
      <li>It is not a company really known for great smelling products.</li>
      <li>they&#x27;ll purchase another scent more suited to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>The alcohol in the gel did not react well to the drier skin I had in OK.</li>
      <li>Its probably one of the better ones out there.</li>
      <li>Very nice clean, fresh smell.</li>
      <li>from the memorable commercials to the memorable character introduced by old spice, the deodrants are now very popular among men.</li>
      <li>If I&#x27;m having an extra-sweaty day (or just need a touch-up after a workout), it can sometimes come in handy with a quick swipe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>great for the price I guess, not buying old spice again</li>
      <li>This is my favorite, followed by Swag, Original, and After Hours in that order.</li>
      <li>I like that it does the job while it does not have a strong odor to it.</li>
      <li>Not too pungent, but yet a gentle clean pleasant scent.  </li>
      <li>I chose this product because of the high reviews but this is surprising to me when it is so off.</li>
      <li>stay in the tropics [Nigeria] and the humidity is a bit high, but even at the end of the day, it still smells good</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a smell good deodorant.</li>
      <li>but this one is pretty nice.</li>
      <li>Its so much easier to have it come to me, and with subscribe and save I can make sure its always on hand!</li>
      <li>Until they start selling this in bulk and offer decent pricing plus free Super Saver shipping, you&#x27;d do much better to purchase on your own.</li>
      <li>&quot; meant \\&quot;cheap after shave\\&quot;...</li>
      <li>But I&#x27;ve come to really enjoy and respect the smell.</li>
      <li>In an emergency I used my boyfriends Old Spice and loved it.</li>
      <li>So, I set off in search of a deodorant that smelled good, went on clear, and did not burn my underarms.</li>
      <li>I think it smells more like a fabulous fruit salad on a hot summer day filled with chilled, refreshing melons and sweet berries.</li>
      <li>Scent Men&#x27;s Anti-Perspirant very very nice to use it for human</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been a loyal classic Irish Spring guy for many years thanks to my grandfather, but this scent is so deliciously enticing that I fell in love immediately and will now be using it moving forward until they decide to stop making</li>
      <li>These have made my pits smell fantastic, feel great even after long exercises/running/etc.  </li>
      <li>Old Spice anti perspirant is definitely the best on the market.  </li>
      <li>Goes on dry and easily lasts all day, but I am most impressed with how long the fragrance lasts and how good it actually smells.</li>
      <li>Overall it&#x27;s a good</li>
      <li>I get my man sexy and smelling good, and I spend way less.</li>
      <li>Even at the end of a long day I sometimes still notice the pleasant odor.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great deal! Love the scent... Everyone always wants to know what Cologne I am wearing. LOL.</li>
    <li> It is one of the best deodorants I have been ever tried. Mild and not causing any headache. I&#x27;m pretty sensitive and easily get headache. For that reason I cannot use many of the stuff out there but this one is pretty nice.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big guy with some sweat trouble, whenever I workout or on a hot day.... I need a tough deodorant anti-perspirant to save my day. Here comes Old Spice with a great product that just works, and the Fiji smell makes &#x27;em go wild</li>
    <li> I bought that product because am fan of old spice brand and I made great  choice to order Fiji.the perfume can last up to 9 hours with outside heat it doesn&#x27;t leave marks on clothes and it comes as it says in pack of four. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> My wife loves the way I smell too.  Not too pungent, but yet a gentle clean pleasant scent.  Keeps me smelling fresh all day long as well.  My new favorite.  I do recommend going to a store and smelling it before purchasing it as everyone has different scent expectations from deodorant.</li>
    <li> this is the best deodorant i ever try all the the kinds smell good man and i will buy again</li>
    <li> Was very curious on how the smell of this product would be when I remember the old Old Spice scent from my grandfather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipped them to Norway, and shared with my friends, they were also surprised how well Fiji smelled, so we are going to order more of this series.</li>
    <li> This is my least favorite of the Old Spice scent, so I suppose that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s so much cheaper than the other scents. It&#x27;s still not terrible and it does what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
    <li> For the convenience factor its a great product. However, at another store I noticed its A LOT cheaper for this deodorant.</li>
    <li> I really like this product, even though sometimes it leaves a sticky sensation on my skin. Overall, I think it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
    <li> The men in the family wear the various scents of Old Spice deo/antiper. and decided to give Fiji a try. While none of us think it smells of palm trees and sunshine as advertised, (ok, we&#x27;ve never smelled a palm tree),  we can vouch for a very nice, subtle scent that is rather pleasing. I think it smells more like a fabulous fruit salad on a hot summer day filled with chilled, refreshing melons and sweet berries. The men in the family swear it smells more like a combination of watermelon and kiwi, but still not overpowering or too feminine. They are considering test-sniffing the other scents in a local store and if there is a more &#x27;manly&#x27; scent of this new line extension, I think I&#x27;ll get to keep Fiji (all 4 of them)and they&#x27;ll purchase another scent more suited to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as controlling odor, this works as good as the original Old Spice products that have both deo/antipers. properties. The invisible solid is just that. Glides on smoothly without leaving the white telltale streak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> If you sweat like I do, waxy sticks and spray-on deodorants are not your friend.  Because of my ability to drip and drench, I end up with one of two formulas:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- goo pushed through a screen&lt;br /&gt;- goo dried up into a powdery stick&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Fresh Collection is the second kind:  soft material that smears on.  Its biggest problem is that it doesn&#x27;t last as long as Sweat Defense, Red Zone, or any of the other Old Spice deodorant products:  I would say I went through my stick of Denali in just over half the time I&#x27;ve used up any of the other Old Spice deodorants I&#x27;ve used.  The Fresh Collection sinks into your skin and stays there a full day.  Like Sweat Defense, I&#x27;ve had workout days where it even seems to hold up a half hour into my routine.  If I&#x27;m having an extra-sweaty day (or just need a touch-up after a workout), it can sometimes come in handy with a quick swipe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This review was posted under the \\&quot;Denali\\&quot; scent - it&#x27;s a good masculine smell that isn&#x27;t as strong as the other Old Spice types of deodorant.  Fiji was the close runner-up when my wife and I did some sniff-sampling at the store.  I stay away from the scents that remind me of Febreeze or cleaning chemicals and the cloying citrusy type, so I find Denali and Fiji to be the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I was a kid, \\&quot;Old Spice\\&quot; meant \\&quot;cheap after shave\\&quot;...it&#x27;s clear nowadays that they&#x27;ve cleaned up their act.  I&#x27;ve used their Sweat Defense and Soft Solid for two years now.  Both are great, but if I had to choose, I&#x27;d still go back to Sweat Defense, or even Red Zone, only because they don&#x27;t run out as quickly.  Either way, with the Old Spice deodorants, I sweat more and fret less.</li>
    <li> Old Spice - Fiji.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you can already tell by all the below reviews, the scent is amazing. Fiji - literally you will smell so fresh and so clean. Its a very pleasant smell to everyone. Great Anti-Perspirant as well, long lasting. With Old Spice products you generally cant go wrong. With the Fiji Scent you definitely wont go wrong!.</li>
    <li> In my experience, amazingly, YES!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always been pleased with the quality of Old Spice deodorants, especially their invisible solids which have a particularly \\&quot;clean\\&quot; feeling (not greasy, clumpy). So when I spotted the FIJI scent on the shelf at my local drug store I thought I would give it the sniff test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell is one of the senses most closely connected with memory. So while this may seem weird, it&#x27;s true: Right there, squatting in the drug store aisle, I was instantly transported back to my vacation on the beach of gulf coast Florida. Somehow, the scent wizards at Old Spice have captured the essence of the tropics and put it in deodorant form. It&#x27;s a remarkably refreshing scent and it keeps me deodorized through a long, hot work day, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, I really like this scent. It&#x27;s a new favorite and hope they keep producing it for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding purchasing this at Amazon: The current pricing structure is flat-out crazy. To order one deodorant stick, factoring in shipping, you&#x27;d pay close to 3x as much as at your local drugstore. Until they start selling this in bulk and offer decent pricing plus free Super Saver shipping, you&#x27;d do much better to purchase on your own.</li>
    <li> trying different deodorants and with a combination of the funny commercials and (sadly) the attractive outer appearance of the packaging I picked this up at the local rite-aid and smelled it.  bought it and am very satistifed with its scent.  most importantly though is it keeps me dry through my work day without feeling the need to reapply after lunch for \\&quot;just in case\\&quot; reasons.  I sweat alot when I do sweat so its important to me for deo/antiper&#x27;s work for at least 8-10 hours.  when i get home from work and smell under my arms i still smell the fiji scent so i love it.</li>
    <li> I love the way the product smells. Getting the 4 pack is a very convenient and economical way to maintain a deodorant stockpile</li>
    <li> Using this product everyday gives me a lot more confidence around women. Just last week I went on 3 dates after I started using this product. Incredible!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results may vary.</li>
    <li> Yesterday my wife caught my knuckle-headed teenage son putting on his t-shirt right after he dried off from his shower. My wife said, \\&quot;Hey, aren&#x27;t you going to put on any deodorant?\\&quot; He said, \\&quot;uh, I already did--just before I got in the shower\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Huh?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We asked him a few more questions trying to get to the bottom of things. His defense was lame, but kind of true. His point was that this deodorant lasts so long that it doesn&#x27;t matter whether you put it on before or after your shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lame, but almost true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This deodorant is really strong and very effective, and the fragrance isn&#x27;t overpowering. And my moron son is right, this stuff stays put even after a shower. You have to wash thoroughly to get rid of it, but you really should start with a fresh coat every day.</li>
    <li> I apparently smell like the Island of Fiji all day, but the deodorant is definitely not invisible.  I also don&#x27;t like going to take a shower in the morning and feeling the soap fall out of my hand from the stickiness of my hand stopping on my armpit.  I never smell of body odor, so it does it&#x27;s job.  I think I&#x27;m going to look for a gel...</li>
    <li> It is my first time using it, I had used  the High endurance Sport, but this is milder and more gentle to the nose.&lt;br /&gt;I stay in the tropics [Nigeria] and the humidity is a bit high, but even at the end of the day, it still smells good</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re a coupon clipper, over the past year you&#x27;ve probably been overwhelmed by Old Spice coupons. I was a Gillette Gel deodorant user, but based on the Old Spice deals I&#x27;ve switched. Tried several different kinds, but the Fresh Collection deodorants have become my favorites. I&#x27;ve tried all four scents; I like Fiji best, followed by Cyprus. This anti-perspirant and deodorant works great (even after a long day), doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin like some plain deodorants do, and doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering scent like Old Spice Swagger Red Zone. The marketing is over the top, but this is great stuff.</li>
    <li> I received a sample size in a gift set for Christmas and enjoyed the new scent.  It really is fresh smelling.  I have been using the swagger scent, but now I&#x27;m definitely switching to this scent!  Love it.</li>
    <li> Great scent. My new go-to deodorant.</li>
    <li> While it is a white stick, it goes and clear and it smells nice.  It isn&#x27;t overpowering like some scents and no one has asked me what cologne are you wearing (which for me is a positive as I&#x27;d hate to say its my old spice deodorant).</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my husband since he wanted an invisble solid and now we are both using it. It has a great fresh scent that is good for both genders and lasts all day even after a full day of hiking and theme park attendance! I am very happy with this product and would recommend it to men and women.</li>
    <li> Now, I&#x27;ll be honest from the beginning, I&#x27;ve used the \\&quot;Long lasting\\&quot; for years. The one with the red cap. Recently I can&#x27;t find it, so I got this one with the white cap. For one, it stains my dark color shirts. The scent is great, no denying that and it lasts long. Within 2 days of using this antiperspirant version, my arm pits got so broken out. After about 5 days, I can finally lift my right arm all the way up. My left arm only half way up. Maybe I&#x27;m alergic to something I don&#x27;t know about, but this stuff does not go well with my skin and I through away both of them (came in a two pack). Not saying everyone reacts this way, a lot of good reviews, but it can happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a video I did, if you want to see it, though it doesn&#x27;t look bad in the video, it&#x27;s much worse in person.&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> the 5 star reviews must be from people who don&#x27;t work that hard or sweat often. I used this product when my line of work didn&#x27;t involve me breaking a sweat, but when this product got put to the real test of a hard working sweaty man, this product failed with flying colors. I never had a problem with BO that I noticed , until I smelled myself after a work day with this deodorant on, it wears off too fast. also doesn&#x27;t mention the duration this product last, 6 hour protection maxium. great for the price I guess, not buying old spice again</li>
    <li> These have made my pits smell fantastic, feel great even after long exercises/running/etc.  This will be my deodorant of choice going forward.</li>
    <li> Having visited Fiji, I was expeciting this to smell like the locals. It didn&#x27;t. To my amazement it smells like bubble gum and vanilla had a waxy white baby.</li>
    <li> I like that it does the job while it does not have a strong odor to it. You almost dont smell it. Its probably one of the better ones out there.</li>
    <li> Overall it&#x27;s a good deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;Personally I think it&#x27;s too strong, difficult to remove even after a whole day.&lt;br /&gt;Soon I&#x27;ll start using crystal deodorants since they are not sticky like this and are natural.</li>
    <li> This deodorant is the truth! I really like the Fiji scent over the others that I smelled..&lt;br /&gt;Not only did I like the smell, but I also stayed dry all day even on warm days when normally&lt;br /&gt;my deodorant would fail and I would be sweating like a pig under my arms. I really hope they keep&lt;br /&gt;this scent as a staple fragrance for a long time!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a few months and will say this deodorant works well and smells good. It also doesn&#x27;t bleach my clothes or anything and stops me from sweating to much.</li>
    <li> I was not too sure as to whether or not it would be as good as people have said but am pleased to say its awesome. Very nice clean, fresh smell. It is also the first time I have used a stick anti-perspirant, and have to say I will probably be back to buy some more when I run out.</li>
    <li> The one i bought was the fiji scent. Smells fresh and without getting tired of it. It does leave a white residue in the armpits of your clothe but with small effort can be cleaned. This deodorant doesnt leave a yellowish stain like other deodorants. I will stick to this deodorant forever.</li>
    <li> Old Spice Fiji is an extraordinary Antiperspirant &amp; Deodorant from Old Spice. The palm tree essence is quite titillating and refreshing. I stay cool and dry the entire day when using this. It is yet another manly essential from Old Spice.</li>
    <li> Old Spice will blow your mind and pits!&lt;br /&gt;It makes you feel like a man and makes women want to feel you.</li>
    <li> I was surprised not to find reviews with experiences like mine. I got horrible rashes from using this deodorant for 3 days. I&#x27;m currently using hydrocortizone to tr and get rid of it.</li>
    <li> The best smelling deodorant ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Smells great.&lt;br /&gt;Long lasting smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t keep the ladies off.  They just love it.</li>
    <li> Great product, smells great and I don&#x27;t get any irritations. Only con is the white stain it leaves when your clothes rub on it but that&#x27;s normal with all anti-perspirants.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Old Spice deodorant since high school, so I have tried just about every scent of it by now. This is my favorite, followed by Swag, Original, and After Hours in that order. I don&#x27;t like that it&#x27;s an anti-perspirant, which prevents sweating; I&#x27;d rather use a plain deodorant that just masks the smell without clogging the pores. If you&#x27;re sensitive to anti-perspirants like I am, just be sure to wash this off thoroughly at night.</li>
    <li> Amazing smell, loved it at first. Terrible rash after using for only a few days. Never had this problem with any other deodorant.</li>
    <li> In an emergency I used my boyfriends Old Spice and loved it. I&#x27;ve used it every since and now buy it for myself. The scent is a nice neutral scent and the strength is better than any ladies formula I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> i love it&lt;br /&gt;the  Old Spice Fresh Collection Invisible Solid Fiji Scent Men&#x27;s Anti-Perspirant very very nice to use it for human</li>
    <li> Several years ago when I moved to Oklahoma I discovered that the gel deodorants I had been using when I lived in Houston would burn my underarms in the cold Oklahoma winters. The alcohol in the gel did not react well to the drier skin I had in OK. So, I set off in search of a deodorant that smelled good, went on clear, and did not burn my underarms. After testing dozens of sticks, I discovered the Old Spice Fresh Collection and have been using it for years now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Collection offers several unique outdoorsy scents; however, I have not found them to be overpowering to the extent that people would think you just returned from camping or wrestling a bear. The stick is a white solid that goes on clear and is mildly clumpy relative to other white solids (in my experience, every white solid is clumpy to some extent). The best part is it never burns my underarms, not even on the coldest, driest days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth a try if you are looking for an outdoorsy smelling deodorant that won&#x27;t burn your underarms.</li>
    <li> I have never purchased antiperspirant online before.  This is by far a better value compared to drug store, grocery stores, etc.</li>
    <li> This was a surprise to me as the description says INVISBLE - \\&quot;Old Spice Fresh Collection Invisible Solid Fiji Scent Men&#x27;s Anti-Perspirant &amp; Deodorant 2.6 Oz (Pack of 4)\\&quot; and it is not.  It also caused an irritation.  This is the first time in 25 years a deo irritated me. I chose this product because of the high reviews but this is surprising to me when it is so off. The smell ain&#x27;t so good either.</li>
    <li> I have used many deodorants in my life and so far this is one of the best. The smell is very nice and fresh and it does not stain my clothes. :)</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical the first time I tried these new Old Spice smells a while back. It is not a company really known for great smelling products. But I&#x27;ve come to really enjoy and respect the smell. It also seems to last the entire day. Even at the end of a long day I sometimes still notice the pleasant odor.</li>
    <li> this is the only deodorant I use, so might as well buy in bulk. Saves some money and is shipped directly to me</li>
    <li> Faster than going to the drug store and about 50% cheaper! What not good about this? It is the same as one can buy but now you get to have the savings!</li>
    <li> good product and price</li>
    <li> This scent from Old Spice is very appealing and the deal I got on the 4 pack of anti-perspirant will keep my husband smelling good for months! Highly recommended you stock up as this price is sometimes better than purchasing with coupons in-person.</li>
    <li> My husband and my son both are both so hooked on the Fiji scent ever since it came out. They have both always used Old Spice deodorants and body washes loyally, but they now stick to this scent only. It is such a fresh clean scent and really does last all day. It totally protects from wetness and odor and it doesn&#x27;t get a funky smell by the end of the day. It is gentle on the skin too. My son tends to be pretty sensitive to many products and my husband can only use certain deodorants because his underarms will actually start to peel. Neither of them have had any issues with Fiji whatsoever. Great stuff!</li>
    <li> This is my go to deodorant when I&#x27;m not wearing a colored shirt. And it&#x27;s definitely a fact that this can take a little extra scrubbing in the shower to get completely off of your pits. But man it works and lasts all throughout the day. Definitely would recommend.</li>
    <li> Need to buy again! Loved this.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed, arrived on time and in great condition! One of my favorite brands I can get in bulk? What is there not to like?</li>
    <li> smells good and lasts a long time even up to 2 or 3 days</li>
    <li> The best deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used. Pleasant fragrance with great lasting and control for all day comfort. Satisfaction guaranteed!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband who strictly uses Axe Body products. I bought it because it was such a good price (4 pack) and told him to suck it up and try something new. He loves the smell and says that it works really well for him. He&#x27;s a gross sweater so that&#x27;s really saying something.</li>
    <li> I have been using this deodorant for years, and the prices are about the same everywhere. Its so much easier to have it come to me, and with subscribe and save I can make sure its always on hand! did i mention the great smell and all day protection!?</li>
    <li> Husband loves this smell. Couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere so bought it online. have to buy three&lt;br /&gt;but he puts one in his gym bag and one to travel with. He never asked me to buy a particular scent before.&lt;br /&gt;he like hawaii and the palms!</li>
    <li> This particular variant of Old Spice smells great - every whiff evokes coconuts and other tropical scents. At the very least, the scent of this product will remind you of a good tanning oil.</li>
    <li> Good product. Goes on dry and easily lasts all day, but I am most impressed with how long the fragrance lasts and how good it actually smells. I used to combine my deodorant with cologne, because the deodorants smell would be gone in an hour or so, but the smell of these are last so long that I no longer need any cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, I am a serious pit sweater and probably need a prescription strength deodorant. This product doesn&#x27;t stop the sweating, but it does slow it down, and the fragrance stays strong all day and night.</li>
    <li> My husband prefers this to the more natural deodorants I now buy for him.  He likes the scent (so do I) and the coverage of the product.  However, the amount of &amp;#34;bad stuff&amp;#34; in this (which sadly includes the nice fragrance) caused us to switch to the more natural &amp;#34;salt&amp;#34; deodorants.  If those are not your concerns, then this is a a really nice and effective choice!</li>
    <li> Rarely do Amazon reviews steer me in the wrong direction.  However, I found the glowing reviews of this product to be completely unwarranted.  I&#x27;ve never had a BO problem...certainly nothing that I noticed.  After using this product for just a few days, I noticed that my armpits had a terrible odor.  The fresh scent lasted for about 3 hours, and then was replaced by BO that I&#x27;ve never experienced before in my life.  I had high hopes for this product, but it definitely did not work for me.  I&#x27;m going back to the dry white stick deodorants.</li>
    <li> This product  has always met my expectations and I love their choice of fragrances.  I am always a repeat customer although I live in Thailand.  My brother sends it to me because Amazon doesn&#x27;t deliver this product to Thailand.</li>
    <li> Where can I start? from the memorable commercials to the memorable character introduced by old spice, the deodrants are now very popular among men. I work at CVS and I see consumers purchasing this product on a regular basis. Now my dad has been working with perfumes for over 30 years and he has pretty much smelled almost every scent there is, but when he came across FiJI, he became an everyday user.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now on to the product, the smell is very elegant. It is not overpowering like most axe products but it is quiet noticable. The smell has a very Hawaiian feel to it. It has a very tropical powdery smell with a hint of man, just threw in a horrible joke there. This smells very good and while at work I receive complients from customers all the time. Now let&#x27;s get to the strenght of the product. I work 8 hours 5 days a week. My job consits of constant physical work and when I use this product, I never had a day where I had wetness problems on my armpits. Not only does Old Spice live up to the standard they set out, but they also provide a great smell with this one. If you are looking for a strong deodrant with a beautiful smell, well go ahead and purchase without any doubts because you will not regret it.</li>
    <li> I love the Fiji and Denali scent. When it comes to anti-perspirant deodorant, Old Spice does it right! I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a smell good deodorant.</li>
    <li> The boy smells good. He wore this when we met and I&#x27;d like to keep that, despite the cost. S&amp;S seemed a good way to mitigate. I get my man sexy and smelling good, and I spend way less. Win win.</li>
    <li> Found this is the only deodorant that smells nice and lasts a full day of work and even into the evening for me.</li>
    <li> As a deodorant/anti perspirant it does what it should do. It is also a great value and smells nice without being overpowering. What else could you want?</li>
    <li> I stumbled on this by accident when my wife bought a two-pack on clearance at the local five &amp; dime (OK, OK...  it was Walmart.  Ooooh, I hate that place!).  I&#x27;ve been a loyal classic Irish Spring guy for many years thanks to my grandfather, but this scent is so deliciously enticing that I fell in love immediately and will now be using it moving forward until they decide to stop making it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from the very pleasant scent (Hints of palm tree and sunshine, I think??) it&#x27;s effective at what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  Which is, I suppose, the actual point...  right?  ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely buy again.  This time from Amazon.  I put this on subscribe and save so I never run out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Get the bar soap that matches for extra benefit!)</li>
    <li> Delivered as promised</li>
    <li> I like the smell, it cam exactly as it was described and it was on time as well. I recommend this to others.</li>
    <li> Old Spice anti perspirant is definitely the best on the market.  I&#x27;ve tried others and nothing comes close.  My wife even uses this stuff!</li>
    <li> I like using deodorant because it will not stain your clothes like others may.  For the price, this is hard to beat.  The items comes with 4 shrink-wrapped per pack.</li>
    <li> Smells fresh and the scent is pretty strong so in my opinion you don&#x27;t need cologne with it.  Works well in every other way it&#x27;s supposed to.  I don&#x27;t know what else to say about deodorant.</li>
    <li> Used this stuff for a long time, it works great, only one complaint is that it leaves a residue on my under shirts, other than that no complaints</li>
    <li> the smell is mile but it last really long, apply this is the morning and went to school, did some fitness stuff and came home around 5 still smelling good. also i ordered in the 17 April and eta was 14 may( i live in Singapore, some where in Asia) but it came in two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;tl;dr really good</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m now living in China (Guangzhou-HOT &amp; HUMID) and cannot purchase any type of stick antiperspirant-deodorant here. Only sprays &amp; roll ons are available. It&#x27;s a challenge to stand up to these sauna like conditions and I think Old Spice does it extremely well without any underarm rash.</li>
    <li> My son has started using this instead of some Axe scented stuff. I am happy because this smells really nice. It is clearly \\&quot;perfumed\\&quot; but does not have that overpowering \\&quot;Man cologne\\&quot; smell like so many men&#x27;s products do. The anti-perspirant seems to keep my boy from getting funky -- even though he has gym every day! -- and the scent is good. The price here is better than in the local big box stores too.</li>
    <li> But keep in mind that if you buy in bulk packaging (e.g., &amp;#62;4 pieces), this product does indeed seem to lose its effectiveness pretty quickly after the expiration date on the packaging.  I would recommend buying only as quickly as you would use it, as the shelf life leaves something to be desired.</li>
    <li> I love the freshness of this product. It smells great during the whole day. I recommend this! I liked their Hawkridge and Wolfthorn too and will definitely buy them soon too.</li>
    <li> JUST WHAT I WANTED WILL BUY AGAIN</li>
    <li> Love this product thats why I keep ordering it, in large quantitys it is hard to find this particular product</li>
    <li> Smells great.Nice white solid deodorant that lasts all day keeping you fresh</li>
    <li> This stuff is smells great and works good. now if they could only make a gel version with the same sent :\ i would buy that.</li>
</ol>
