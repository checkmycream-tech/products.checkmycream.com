<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is great for perfume and poop pour - for smelly bathrooms....but the spray comes out in more of a stream...not a mist.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly and is a good size to throw in your purse.</li>
    <li> Work well. Nothing amazing.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Items as stated. And,best of all, IT WORKS!</li>
    <li> I love them Thank you :)</li>
    <li> I have bought one of these before and it worked out great for me and great for my use to travel.</li>
    <li> I like this refill because it does not leak. Looks expensive.</li>
    <li> Inside container is plastic, not glass as stated.</li>
    <li> Very nice little bottle for the money.</li>
    <li> I love the ability to reduce my perfume bottle to a purse size grab and go perfume!!!  And it&#x27;s looks so rich too!!!</li>
    <li> First issue was the color. Looks nothing like the picture and none even like the picture another customer posted. It&#x27;s more orange than anything. I would not consider it gold at all. Secondly it leaks. Bad. I have it in my purse in an upright pocket at all times. In particular about my purses. Nice purses need to be treated well so it&#x27;s not like I throw it around or its laying wherever. I can confidently say it&#x27;s upright almost always. So it leaking was a huge dissapontment.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s leaks.from the top.</li>
    <li> Was purchased march 4th, broke on May 10 with minimal use (1x/week). Materials felt like they were good quality when I received it, but then the pump broke and is now useless.</li>
    <li> Easy to fill, very compact, and attractive to the eye.  Plus I&#x27;ve had it for a year, and it still hasn&#x27;t turned.  May order again in another color.</li>
    <li> This is another great atomizer that I&#x27;ve purchased on Amazon.  It is great for carrying perfume samples in my purse, especially when flying on a plane.  The atomizer is easy to hold, and carries a good amount of liquid (at least for perfumes.)  The shiny gold case is attractive, and the sprayer sprays very evenly.  I&#x27;ve been very happy with this purchase.  They also make nice little gifts for friends!</li>
    <li> 2 stars for just the looks and price. Too bad it didn&#x27;t work and delivery took forever since it was coming from China. I requested for a refund.</li>
    <li> these are great - attractive and easily can be carried in a purse or pocket. . refill over and over with your favorite parfum or a homemade scent with essential oils.. makes great party favors, gift-giving for teachers, hairdressers, neghbors, co-workers etc.</li>
    <li> Not a bad cologne bottle but it came all scratched up in the mail. It does the job though and inside is glass which is richer than plastic.</li>
    <li> happy with these atomizers.  Pefect for cologne not in a spray bottle. Fits nicely in smal purse and fills easily</li>
    <li> The was easy to fill just by spraying into the container. Great for travel vs. taking the entire large perfume bottle with you. I like the protective metal covering that keeps the glass safe too!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a lot bigger than I expected but that&#x27;s not necessarily a bad thing. The gold looks more like a light orange but overall it serves it&#x27;s purpose and was easy to fill.</li>
    <li> Worked great , very nice.</li>
    <li> took longer than said to ship  :( but when it came it was really protected with bubble wrap because it is glass. And wow it was bigger than I thought I&#x27;d be, that&#x27;s a plus. its really nice and portable 10/10 would buy again.</li>
    <li> Excellant product... I will order again.... Thank you</li>
    <li> Not what I expected. Good product if you have cologne you can pour in.</li>
    <li> This purchase made a lot of sense to me and I jumped at it. Many perfumes of choice do not come in screw top bottles. And, therefore, are not travel  worthy. These small bottles hold just enough of ones favorite scents to take them where they want to go, and back. These  bottles are my recommendation for safe carrying of perfumes when one is off to the office or, on vacation. I enjoy being able to take  a &amp;#34;sprits&amp;#34; when I am away from  my vanity tray, collection of the best scents that money can buy.</li>
    <li> Perfect travel accessory when your favorite perfume doesn&#x27;t come in a rollerball or travel size.</li>
    <li> Bought these for a show and they worked great. They were the perfect size for a small handbag and work great!</li>
    <li> Great so far. Came in about 3 weeks, from China.  Great condition.  Bottles are glass.  Works fine after filling them.  We will see if they last.  If I have problems I will update my review.  After travel they leak slightly even after making sure they were tight. Might want to secure in a zip lock bag.</li>
    <li> Item arrived as expected and on time. No issues.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume bottle so much! I&#x27;m satisfied and would recommend buying it! Plus it maches my purse! Yay!</li>
    <li> Because of the way it is displayed (above) and on the Amazon site, I thought WRONGLY that there were 2 of these refillable bottles per order. It arrived today and, just fYI, there is only 1 to an order. It is perfect, however, pretty and holds quite a bit of cologne. Just know that that there is only 1, not 2. My mistake!</li>
    <li> Easy to fill and does what it says it should</li>
    <li> Travel size easy to use and very handy</li>
    <li> Takes forever to get here and comes from China. Buy American. The bottle does what it says.I haven&#x27;t noticed any leaking.</li>
    <li> Wow, this item is hands over much larger than expected.  I was picturing an item half it&#x27;s size and was blown away when I opened the package.  Got to me in good time compared to other shipments I ordered the same day.  Will definately see if this is available the next time I need it.</li>
    <li> Good quality item. Will buy more.</li>
    <li> Easy to fill. It&#x27;s a bit tacky, I wish it came in matte colors, but it functions well.  It&#x27;s good for freshening up on the go.</li>
    <li> Years ago I had a similar item and apparently misplaced it.  The refillable travel size allows me to always have my favorite fragrance with me.</li>
    <li> Worked great! This was a gift for my mom who had broken the top off her perfume bottle and was looking for a way to use the rest of her perfume. She transferred it to this and it worked great. Well made, easy to use and can be used for travel.</li>
    <li> Nonstop! I am so upset. Also int he picture there are two of them but you only really get one. Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> This thing broke within 2 months and I&#x27;m sending it back.</li>
    <li> Works well and has nice finished appearance.  Price is excellent.</li>
    <li> just a little larger than expected.</li>
    <li> The gold, and the silver have arrived, but the Purple ones have not.&lt;br /&gt;One Gold atomizer broke in the mail.</li>
    <li> I ordered this to be used for a product called &amp;#34;Poo Pourri&amp;#34; which removes odors caused by bathroom visits. Since colon surgery several years ago I have more bad aroma from stools. This sprayer is small enough for it to be concealed in my purse so I can take it with me to use and avoid embarrassment.</li>
    <li> Seems nice - I will try putting perfume in there - but it&#x27;s larger than I thought so I might use it for something else. I do like the way the sprayer hose goes all the way to the bottom.</li>
    <li> The product is as was expected.  I am sure that I will ordering this product again.  I&#x27;m looking forward to the next purchase.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly for my jojoba oil moisturizer. I might be annoyed at the straight stream of liquid if I was using this for perfume, but I&#x27;m not. Really happy with the glass insert/metal cover.</li>
    <li> Took some time, but beautiful bottle.</li>
    <li> Purchased for transfer of cologne that didn&#x27;t have an atomizer.  Container is smaller than description claims; container leaks as well, so it&#x27;s not suitable for travel.</li>
    <li> Took forever to arrive, used it, within a week it started leaking everywhere. Bought 2, same thing with other one. Do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It took a long time to come, but it works well and I&#x27;m happy with it&lt;br /&gt;It also looks very elegant in the gold!</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted. I love them:</li>
    <li> Handy little bottle.  I got it to carry Poo-pourri in my pocketbook.  However, a repairman who had chance to use my bathroom saw the container of poo-pourri on my toilet tank and said his mother didn&#x27;t believe it was a real product.  What better way to explain than provide a sample so I filled this pretty little bottle and gave it to him to take along for her.</li>
    <li> No longer have to advertise you carry around a poupourri :).  Discreet, sized perfectly, and nice looking.</li>
    <li> Purchased this item a couple months ago. It comes from China so it took FOREVER to arrive.  I like the size and it worked well.  One problem.. it came unscrewed and leaked all out in the bottom of a very expensive pocketbook :(  I&#x27;m trying again but will keep it in zip lock snack bag.</li>
    <li> Good for what they are.  Nice finish and good to use for your cologne mixes.  Don&#x27;t atomize real well but get the job done.</li>
    <li> larger than I had thought, but still fits comfortably in my purse.  Simple to fill.  Amazing quality for this price!</li>
    <li> This is used to freshen up a public restroom at work. I keep this in my pocket so I was concerned it could leak. They don&#x27;t and work great. I would purchase again when needed.</li>
    <li> I chipped my perfume bottle, this saved my money</li>
    <li> ITS OK BUT TOO SMALLL FOR MY PURPOSE.  WISH IT WERE LARGER SO I CAN PUT MORE INTO IT.</li>
    <li> I accidentally ordered these in the wrong size. So, make sure its what you need in ml or ounces!! These are kind of big. I wanted the size for a small purse. When I went to fill them I saw that the bottle inside is so much smaller. Kind of strange why the outer container needs to be so large. I have ordered these in the smaller container a year ago and they were perfect. Not worth ordering this larger one when the actual container inside so small. Below is the perfect size for an over the shoulder bag or clutch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here on Amazon:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 - Refillable Perfume Bottles Purse or Travel Size. &amp;#34;Silver &amp; Gold&amp;#34; 1/3oz .33 Fl. oz. 10ml. - INCLUDES 2 - 5ML. DROPPERS FOR EASY FILLIN</li>
    <li> It was as I expected, and I filled it with my perfume as soon as I got it. It was easy to fill.</li>
    <li> This works so great when I travel.  I have expensive perfume and didn&#x27;t want to risk the bottles breaking while traveling.  No leaking!</li>
    <li> was a lot bigger than i thought it would be and the advice from other people when i questions about it were very helpful even though it was bigger than i thought i didnt mind it because it eventually just was perfect for me.  it is detachable from the base and the container and pump is unscrewable as well it takes in a good amount of perfume inside the container so there is no need for constant refill and it sprays very misty like which is what i wanted the color is gorgeous every time i want to smell good i spray little on myself and just throw it in my bag and i am all good havent had any leaks and i dont feel that this would break on my. RECOMMEND to all who want a travel size perfume bottle and hate constantly needing to refill it.</li>
    <li> I used this to put poo-pourri in, and it works perfectly. No leakage and the container is nice.</li>
    <li> I bought this little container to put that Poo-Pourri bathroom spray in it. It was easy to add the bathroom spray to the tiny canister and it doesnt leak at all. The gold bottom occasionally falls off the bottom when i am digging in my purse in panic looking for the spray. But it doesnt effect the bottle at all, as there is a glass canister the gold is just an outer decoration to match the lid.</li>
    <li> Love them!!! but expensive and could not buy in bulk</li>
    <li> The lid doesn&#x27;t say on very well. And it also came all scratched up..</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Works great.</li>
    <li> Excellent seller.. Quick delivery, Great product&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> What a waste of money this product was.  I give it one star because I could not give it a zero.  Once you put the liquid in the drip I lost a completely fabulous small container of perfume because of this trash.  Stay away from it.</li>
    <li> If you can find perfume without a built in sprayer, and want to take it with you then this is a good product.  I bought it to decorate and use in a Victorian costume.  For this it makes a good base also.</li>
    <li> Excellent for frequent travellers.  Easy to refil with your favourite smelly.</li>
    <li> Satisfied our needs, exactly what we wanted!</li>
    <li> Took an eternity to arrive, but really a handy little item.</li>
    <li> Perfect! I needed a travel sized perfume spray and this is perfect.</li>
    <li> These are fabulous. They look good and don&#x27;t leak.  A great way to carry your favorite fragrance with you.</li>
    <li> Product slightly on the bulky side for the amount of liquid it holds. One I received was defective. Liquid leaks out from underneath the cap and never makes it out of the ​nozzle to spray. Will definitely attempt to return and go back to Traveloo atomizers.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a cute little perfume sprayer. It&#x27;s a little bigger than lipstick but it works great in my cosmetic bag.</li>
    <li> Great bottles I really enjoy using them .</li>
    <li> Did notwork at all !!!!!</li>
    <li> I have a lot of little mini splash colognes and this is great to put them in and throw in my bag to freshen up throughout the day! I would be concerned it would leak when flying but for everyday use, it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> Love it.  It was just what I needed and it works as I expected.</li>
    <li> Great, thank you for your quick service.</li>
    <li> Great size and perfect for plane travel!</li>
    <li> I loved it for the first week but then while in my purse, my perfume spilled out everywhere and I was completely disappointed. It doesn&#x27;t stay closed very well. It keeps loosening. I love the look and the price is good and it&#x27;s very cute. Fits perfectly in my purse. At least my purse smells great now :/ ha.</li>
