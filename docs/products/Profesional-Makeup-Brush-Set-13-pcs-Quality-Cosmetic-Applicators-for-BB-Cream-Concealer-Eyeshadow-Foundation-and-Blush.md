<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> A great set of inexpensive makeup brushes. I particularly like the liner brush for applying eyeliner to my water line and the angled brush for applying liner to the top lid.</li>
    <li> Have used once for Halloween costume makeup. Will be using again soon very good quality. great purchase.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes. They roll up nicely for putting away and work great. I&#x27;ve been happy with them so far! :)</li>
    <li> Injust get my Brush today un the mail and let me tell you they look really nices and they are biger then I thought they would be. I am very happy with them</li>
    <li> Very good .. Thanks 👍🏻</li>
    <li> Love this brushes. .Came with fancy packaging!</li>
    <li> Just as the reviews had explained, the brushes were great for its price, however I do not recommend keeping them kept in the makeup case that comes with it. The brushes themselves (along with the aftercare messages you receive afterwards ) is definitely worth 5 stars, although again I don&#x27;t recommend using the case that comes with it due to its strong plastic like smell.</li>
    <li> Brushes aren&#x27;t very good quality. The top to a brush broke off with maybe 3 uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not good for contouring</li>
    <li> I really like these brushes- incredible quality, the brushes are nice and soft and easy to use. The case is wonderful- high quality, very pretty to look at and utilitarian. My ONLY wish is that there were more (or any) bushy eye brushes for smokey eye and for blending... I wound up having to buy a four pack from the local pharmacy and those are the brushes I use the most (aside from the foundation brush). I wish the bushy eye brushes I  bought last minute were of the high quality as these.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used these yet but they are a nice set. Price was great.</li>
    <li> To sum up these brushes in a word: Amazing.  I have tried out other brush sets and they do not compare to this set by Cheeva&#x27;s.  There are a total of 13 brushes ranging from the big powder brush down to the small guy that lets you put on your eyeliner like a professional.  The brush quality is second-to-none in this price range as they are soft and supple which allow you to put on your makeup flawless.  Cleaning these up is an absolute breeze, just a little baby wash and some warm water and they are good as new.  What really drew me to this set is the unique pink in them as well as the case which looks very feminine.  The case is soft and supple; on the inside each brush has it&#x27;s own pocket allowing the handle fits securely in place as well as an inner dust cover.  It closes in a roll style with a secure tie.  I received this at a discount in exchange for personally testing and providing my honest review of the product.</li>
    <li> Good quality product. They are soft and pretty. Good set of brushes.!</li>
    <li> Love how soft the brushes are. Wish the travel case was made of different material but all in all, I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Very good quality brushes!!! I&#x27;m studying professional make up and they work perfectly</li>
    <li> I enjoyed them but they don&#x27;t hold the makeup too well to apply.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes so far. They do everything I need them to do. I&#x27;ve purchased more expensive brushes before and these do the same job as the more expensive ones. I&#x27;m pleased with the product and would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love! Product came quickly and works very well and it didl not cost me an arm and leg. I have already recommend this product on Facebook and friends are looking to get it.</li>
    <li> This was the first brush set that I&#x27;ve ever purchased, and it&#x27;s great for beginners because it has everything that you would ever need! When it first came, each brush was individually wrapped in plastic, and there was a strong odor. However, after washing them, the smell faded and the brushes didn&#x27;t shed. The ferrules weren&#x27;t loose and the brushes were sturdy. I think that the pink and white is quite stylish, and the little case that they come in is nice for storage. I love that these brushes are synthetic and cruelty-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish that the set swapped out the &amp;#34;smudging eye brush&amp;#34; with an actual eye brush (maybe a smaller eye shadow brush?) because it&#x27;s basically those sponge-tipped applicators that come with every eye shadow that you buy at the drugstore, and most people (including me) would throw them out. I&#x27;ve never used this &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34;, and I&#x27;m not sure how you would even wash it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After delving into the world of makeup and discovering other companies with affordable makeup brush sets like BH Cosmetics and Coastal Scents, I also think that the price point for this set is a bit too high. On Amazon, though, this is a great set, and definitely does not feel cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT (9/29/2015): After storing them for a while in the included purple case, I found that the handles were somehow stuck to the case material. I had them stored in a sealed box, so moisture or pressure should not have been problems. After pulling each brush out (it felt like they were glued in!), bits of the purple case material were stuck to the handles, and the white paint was ruined. I&#x27;m not sure how that happened, but I&#x27;ve thrown out the case.</li>
    <li> What a great set of makeup brushes. I love how soft they are. The color is fun and the actual bristles on each brush is a great quality material.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this brush set! I have been looking for a great brush set that wasn&#x27;t going to cost me hundreds as I&#x27;m just starting out. Cheeva definitely did not disappoint here! The brushes pick up and hold color well and the blending brushes work great! Every single brush does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to and there is no strong chemical smell at all! They are made really well so the handles are sturdy and the bristles stay in. No shedding, no need to trim first! The case is such a beautiful purple and such a soft leather! I use these brushes every day to apply my makeup and will definitely be purchasing more from them in the future! I&#x27;m so excited that after buying so many horrible brush sets that I finally found an awesome set at a great price too! I did receive this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion but that all thoughts and opinions are solely my own!</li>
    <li> First off let me say that I am obsessed with the color! I was in need of new brushes but didn&#x27;t want to spend a whole lot... But then I ran across these! I was scared because I thought it would get dirty very fast! I have been using it for about 3 weeks now (I wear makeup daily) and I clean them daily and they still look beautiful! For the price the quality is very good! I was shocked because I thought the brushes would be crappy but boy was I wrong! I&#x27;m going to order a set for my sister who is a makeup Artist who came over n fell in love with them too!!</li>
    <li> Gave this as a gift! The case is awesome and my friend loves it!</li>
    <li> Great brushes!  No need for the roll up compartment though. I&#x27;ve never kept or used any.</li>
    <li> Beautiful set of brushes.  Every brush you need is in this set.  I love the color, the beautiful purple case, and  the brushes themselves are so soft and perfect for makeup application.  I am so satisfied with this product I will definitely recommend this product to all my friends and family.</li>
    <li> This is quite lovely. Very nicely packaged. Love the color of the case that keeps all of the brushes organized.  The brushes are nice and soft and I have not noticed any shedding (I always test brushes for shedding by pulling on the bristles). The size of the brushes and handles is quite nice as well. Purchased for a gift and now I hate to give it away.</li>
    <li> I was wanting a wide variety of brushes. I searched for several months and decided to go with these because of the variety, price, roll case, and the positive reviews. In the details I couldn&#x27;t find if the brushes were made of real hair or synthetic. Now I know they are synthetic. I prefer real hair because they do make a difference when applying makeup in my opinion. My favorite brushes are by Trish McEvoy, but if you know her products one brush on average is around $50 dollars. Sometimes she will include m couple of brushes in her planners that is the best way to buy her high end products; makeup too. You can really tell a difference in great products vs good. The problem I have with this set of brushes is the pick up is not very good and the brushes are way to soft. On the other hand for the price this could be a good backup set or a teenagers first full set. Also they forgot to include a smudge brush so I had to buy that separate and it was more than all of these brushes. Crazy how expensive brushes are. A good set of brushes if you take care of them will last many years, but you have to clean them soap &amp;water lay to dry or best tilt brush side up to dry. So far these brushes have not shed any and seem to be built well. The roll would be better if it were leather, but that would bring the price up and the one that came with these is nice and protects your brushes well. I guess it depends on what you need and what you&#x27;re willing to spend. I think these would be perfect for a teenage girl definitely and they look very cute being pink and white. The handles are long I like that, but would not mind if they were a bit shorter so if I need to put a few in one of my Trish McEvoy Planners I could. These are to long to fit in her planners. I use four of these brushes. The rest I will never use because they are a lot a like in style. I would&#x27;ve been better off just buying the five brushes I need at the higher prices, but this will make a great gift for my little cousin&#x27;sfor sure. They will love them and how pretty they are! It really depends on what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for this for a long time now  and I am happy with the quality of this brush set  and do not shed hair, and they look like they will last a long time.This particular Make-Up set includes 13 different brushes, nestled inside a leather like roll up carry/travel case with tie closure.The carrying case has the feel of a soft leather and has secure stitching through out the whole case. From the edges to each individual pocket the brushes fit into. The brushes fit nice and secure, but not so secure that you have trouble pulling them in and out. The color is more like a metallic pink/purple with a sheen to it. I love that they have wooden handles and personally feel that makes them a little more sturdy, and not heavy at all. The metal band that holds the brush fibers in place, is a solid piece of metal, crimped to hold the fibers in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received this product in exchange for my unbiased reviews.</li>
    <li> I am new to brushes and have been doing a lot of searching in Department Stores to acquire the knowledge and feel for them. What I have found is there are so many different types and quality differences!  I am so happy to share that this Brush Set has met every possible need I could have, they are beautifully packaged, the brushes are holding up really well and the price is so affordable!  Thank you Cheeva for a product I can endorse and use with confidence.</li>
    <li> These brushes are fabulous. Each with its own use, and I love the fact that Cheeva (the seller) goes out of their way to send you a PDFS explaining what each brush does. I gave 4 stars due to the eye liner brush. (It may be error on my part) but when applying the gel eyeliner I like a kind of stiff brush. The brush here looks the part but it is kind of soft and appears to remove as it applies. Again it may just be my error, I will try again soon. Is that a deal breaker HELL NO! There are no fall out bristles at all this far and I have been using then for about 3 wks (six times a week, morning applications only).&lt;br /&gt;Fyi after 9 hours with sephora setting spray my makeup (Sephora, BH, ipsy, corner store lol) is still flawless!&lt;br /&gt;The blush brush is great. Some of the brushes are full and thick like a kabuki brush (which I love fyi) but final word their inexpensive and well worth the money in my opinion. Happy hunting. Oh fyi after a week of comparing I always cane back to these brushes and took a chance which I do not regret!</li>
    <li> I gave it to my sister as a Xmas gift . But unfortunately, this is a very low quality product. It smells horrible. The top to some brushes broke off with just several uses. I have no idea why this product is highly rated. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this!!!!</li>
    <li> So soft and pretty!! Didn&#x27;t even want to get them dirty lol but I did (:</li>
    <li> I got the opportunity to try these brushes on Uberzon and I will say that they work well. They do their job,and they feel nice and soft. The case smells a little like plastic at first but it airs out. They are worth the money at this price to have a makeup brush set... usually brush sets are so over priced but I would be willing to spend this amount to have a makeup brush for everything I need. I also love the color of them :)</li>
    <li> These are the best brushes I have ever had and the case is absolutely gorgeous (gold lame-ish)! There are brushes for the mouth, eyes, cheeks and all over facial brush for powdered foundation or just powder! There are even brushes for the eyebrows! I love these brushes. It had a card enclosed saying to register in case they need to be replaced! Went there but I did not see anywhere to register for guarantee. Other than that I am very, very pleased! Thanks!</li>
    <li> i was actually very surprised of the high quality of the brushes they are very soft and cute!!</li>
    <li> Perfect for my 11yr old.. thank you ..&lt;br /&gt;just what she wanted</li>
    <li> These brushes are great. They are very soft and the assortment is perfect.  There is one for everything.</li>
    <li> I love the brush they are so soft and do not shed so worth the price</li>
    <li> beautiful brushes, great service!</li>
    <li> These brushes are affordable and very high quality. I&#x27;ve been using them for a week and so far, no complaints yet.</li>
    <li> Love them! Very nice quality!</li>
    <li> I love these brushed. They are amazingly soft and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with my purchase. Great customer service. Have washed brushes and not a bristle fell out. Still retained their softness. Applied foundation, eyeshadow, blush, and powder perfectly. Very impressed so far.</li>
    <li> i am very happy with these brushes. I love that the coloring is not so boring and typical. Pretty traveling case as well. different brushes for different uses. All very good. Thanks!</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing! Not only are they MUCH prettier than typical makeup brushes but they also come with a carrying case! I have long searched for quality brushes that come with a case for a decent price. These brushes are soft and hold makeup very well. They help with contouring as well as eyeshadow because of the large variety in which they come. The fan makeup brush is most likely my favorite, it not only helps with removing excess eyeshadow that falls in the wrong spot, but it also is perfect for contouring blush or bronzer.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest review.</li>
    <li> Very cute bag and good quality brushes. Came quickly too!</li>
    <li> Brushes are extremely soft and good quality!  100% recommend</li>
    <li> Nice and soft brushes. I just thought the bigger brush was more full. Still gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Loved my brushes.  They are so soft and totally work for what I needed them for.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with the quality of the product.  The brushes have soft hair and are firm for applying makeup.  They hold and distribute makeup evenly.</li>
    <li> Very happy with both the quality of this brush set and the proactive customer service provided by the seller. The order shipped quickly, but even before I had received the item the seller emailed me to say that some orders had been sent out with the fan brush in the incorrect slot in the wrap causing the hair of the brush to curl instead of it being flat, and offering to send a replacement brush if that proved to be the case with my order. The brush was in the incorrect place so I emailed the seller to let them know, though I am sure if I steam the hair and flatten it under a book or similar flat object it would be fine. The brushes themselves seem good quality and do not shed hair, and they look like they will last a long time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m absolutely in love with my set they&#x27;re super soft.</li>
    <li> Excellent, highly-recpmmendable product. Fast delivery. Problem-free transaction.</li>
    <li> This is a xmas gift. But came quickly and looks nice</li>
    <li> These are great and made well! You get every brush you need.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product with high quality brushes and beautiful packaging! I&#x27;ve been needing brushes and I&#x27;ve looked around stores and haven&#x27;t found anything that jumps at me as a good deal. These brushes are the REAL deal! I feel like a make-up artist now and will begin to look for clients for my new business that I just created today!! So inspired!</li>
    <li> These brushes are great quality at such a good price. Usually makeup brushes have a smell of paint on them but these didn&#x27;t... And they&#x27;re so incredibly soft! I&#x27;d definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I love them, the are so soft and comfortable i would highly recomend everyone getting these</li>
    <li> My first brush set and i am very satisfied to purchase them at such price. The brushes are soft. Have not really use it. The seller is considerate to send several emails before and after I received. I think the only problem with this product is that there is still some smell.</li>
    <li> I received the older brown version, if I had the money I&#x27;d send it back for this one.</li>
    <li> These brushes are made with very good material. I use less foundation when applying to my skin. The make up goes on smooth and evenly. I definately recommend the purchase and use of Cheeva&#x27;s makeup brushes.</li>
    <li> This set has every brush you would ever need! I love how soft they are and they haven&#x27;t lost any bristles so far.</li>
    <li> I always enjoy shopping on Amazon and this experience was no different. The product arrived within the time specified and was packed well. I received an email shortly after my purchase from Cheeva Beauty Products thanking me for my purchase with the Makeup Tips eBook attached.  Great service! The quality and quantity of the brushes is great, I look forward to using them!</li>
    <li> I love this set I would defiantly buy from this seller again they really wrap my package so it won&#x27;t damage and the brushes are beautiful and soft and best of all it deliver very fast I&#x27;m happy and recommend people to buy this set :)</li>
    <li> I work in the makeup/beauty industry, so choosing the proper tools that are not only high-quality but long lasting as well is a must. After using these brushes for a while now, I can say that they get my word of approval! They are of high-quality, are extremely, soft, and do not shed. Also, the brush holder that they come in is super convenient for travel. Would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift for wife she loved them thanks.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes!  I am very pleased with my order.</li>
    <li> Very nice. Quick delivery time.</li>
    <li> Good quality brushes.</li>
    <li> the brushes are incredibly soft, and do not shed! I&#x27;m in love with this brush set!!</li>
    <li> These are quality Brushes. I bought them on a whim for my overnight case, but have moved them to my professional cosmetic case with my MAC And Bobby Brown brushes. They are soft, sturdy and blend beautifully. The case is very nice.  I intend to order more for gifts as well as another set for myself. The price for this set of brushes is an amazing value ... unbelievable!</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with this make up brush set. Not only is it beautiful but it is well made.  I have used them several times and my make up application has been flawless . I plan to put these on my must have list.  I recommend these for adult use or a teens second set of brushes. As a plus you also get great tips on use and cleaning.  They are stored in a very nice case.</li>
    <li> Very soft and good quality: especially for the price. I actually use this more than my bare minerals make up brushes. I def recommend this product, however, I&#x27;m not a cosmetologist... I just know what I like. There are brushes in this set I haven&#x27;t used yet, but I don&#x27;t foresee any problems or complaints.</li>
    <li> Smaller than I thought but super soft....loveeeee</li>
    <li> I bought this brush set for my daughter for Christmas and she loves them.  She had another brand of brushes and she said that these were far better.  I recommend this makeup brush set.</li>
    <li> Very sturdy and long lasting</li>
    <li> The eyeshadow brushes are useless. I simply cannot get the smoky look I want with these brushes since they are very much tight!!</li>
    <li> These are excellent brushes. I am.very pleased by the quality of the brushes and will definitely buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Really fluffy brushes that are easy to clean</li>
    <li> Very nice set. Great price. Love the case. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes!!! They are very soft, and are amazing!</li>
    <li> Thanks, I have the E book already and its awesome!!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this makeup brush set.  First they are made of high quality synthetic materials.  Having sensitive skin and allergies I did not have to worry about any adverse reactions to my skin or sneezing while applying my makeup.  There is a wide variety of brushes, that some I&#x27;m not even familiar with.  Included is Foundation brush, powder, blending, brow, angled and lip brushes plus 7 more.  They all have light wooden handles to make them easy to hold.  The bristles after using them have all stayed in tack, no loose ones laying around the table.  The roll up pouch is a nice lightweight but sturdy bag with a purple soft sheen.  Each brush has it&#x27;s own pocket to stay in place.  When you roll up the bag the bristles do not bend or roll up.  Excellent brush set for the money !!</li>
    <li> This 14 piece cosmetic brush set is a fantastic bargain.  There are so many brushes that I&#x27;m not even sure what some of them are used for!  All of these brushes are high quality. They apply make-up beautifully.  I love how fine the smaller brushes are for applying eye liner.  The bristles are extremely soft and do not shed.  I haven&#x27;t noticed one loose bristle even after washing.  The brushes come in a handy carrying case for storage or travel. The wooden handles are long and easy to hold steady for fine details.  I love these brushes. I purchased these cosmetic brushes during a promotion for trial and review.  I am very pleased with this product.  Included with this purchase you will receive a very helpful ebook about make up application.  I highly recommend Cheeva&#x27;s Perfect Makup Brush Set.</li>
    <li> My college student daughter loves these new brushes.  I bought them as part of her birthday gift.  They are nice and soft and work great with very minimal shedding.  A really versatile set and great value for the price.</li>
