      <li>I keep buying more.</li>
      <li>If you are going to purchase this, then purchase as needed and don&#x27;t bother stocking up because you won&#x27;t be able to use it</li>
      <li>and it smells lovely</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t get a chance to use it, but now (6 months later)I pulled it out of the medicine cabinet and the sunscreen has burned a hole through the lid on the top.</li>

      <li>I read so many great reviews and was super excited to have a more affordable yet safe sunscreen to use for my little ones.</li>
      <li>This sunscreen is also great for daily use under make up or foundation.</li>
      <li>Good for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s well worth the price!</li>
      <li>I was so excited to try this brand given the glowing reviews but</li>
      <li>They have a list on their website (skincare.org) of the best sunscreens with the least toxins</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not heavy, and rubs in very easily.</li>
      <li>This was very important for the seven month old who doesn&#x27;t sit still.</li>
      <li>After reading many reviews for many different products in my search for a non-toxic sunscreen for my children (4 years old and 7 months old) I chose this product, and was very pleased with my selection.</li>
      <li>Love this sunscreen for my 2 year old son.</li>
      <li>I am not an over the top organic all natural mom type either.  </li>
      <li>one day when the sun was unavoidable, he has super sensitive skin, and was fine.</li>
      <li>Both of my children are fair skin, blonde hair, blue eyes, so they tend to burn fairly easily.</li>
      <li>but it is absorbed pretty well</li>
      <li>I was super impressed when I applied it as it smelled pleasant (unlike Badger which smells awful!), was creamy and easy to smooth out, and didn&#x27;t leave my kids looking like slimey white ghosts.</li>
      <li>Love this suncream for the entire family.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>did some research on the EWG site and realised that most regular suncreams (even those marketed for babies) contain hideous toxic ingredients.</li>
      <li>I felt like I was constantly reapplying it trying to make sure they were covered.</li>
      <li>There is NO way this sunscreen will keep your LO safe if swimming, playing outside, or at the beach.</li>
      <li>It was also the first sunscreen to pass Whole Foods Premium Care requirements.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t worry myself over every single product, I just try to be wise about the obvious stuff.  </li>
      <li>Smells good, but hard to rub in.</li>
      <li>This is a straight up physics problem.  </li>
      <li>and it was very sunny.</li>
      <li>You really don&#x27;t need a primer if you put this on because it basically acts like one and make-up sets really well over it.</li>
      <li>how much I shake the bottle.</li>
      <li>so you don&#x27;t have to rub in as much.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>I get darker fast in the sun</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>This is the only sunscreen my 4yr old has ever been able to use.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for sensitive skin and doesn&#x27;t leave a white residue like other mineral sunscreens do.</li>
      <li>We live in Hawaii so going to the beach is a normality for us, and we used this sunscreen for the first time yesterday.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think I can say it any better than the other reviewers</li>
      <li>I had originally ordered a smaller size from another Amazon vendor and the product was delivered leaky and you could literally hear the slush in the tube!</li>
      <li>We don&#x27;t like to use sunscreens with carcinogens or other gunk in them, so this initially appealed to us because it gets such a great rating from the EWG (Environmental Working Group).</li>
      <li>No wonder he was breaking out in hives when any of the typical kids sunscreens were touching his skin...</li>
      <li>Be sure to apply well, at least 20 minutes before getting outside, otherwise any kind of sunblock doesn&#x27;t work properly.</li>
      <li>I had high hopes for this sunscreen, but instead it will be going in the trash.</li>
      <li>We recently tried Raw Elements sunscreen because it gets such great EWG ratings, however it is much greasier than Thinkably/ThinkSport.</li>
      <li>The FDA estimates that an adult should use about an ounce of sunscreen for their whole body.  </li>
      <li>Perhaps this works well for oily, or even normal, skin</li>
      <li>So, I&#x27;m always looking at new sunscreens.  </li>
      <li>I was born and raided and live in Phoenix, AZ.  </li>
      <li>The first and only time I used it we were at a field and track competition</li>
      <li>and I was surprised that it had no separation!</li>
      <li>My children who never get sunburned got very burnt, and so did I even after reapplying it several times.</li>
      <li>I use it on myself and my 2 yr old.</li>
      <li>and this slowed it down tremendously.</li>
      <li>If you over spread the sunscreen, its akin to applying less than the amount needed for adequate protection.  </li>
      <li>Came out creamy just like I had originally expected when I ordered the first one.</li>
      <li>Also, my seven month old has had various skin conditions including eczema.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Good for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought the 3 oz bottles of Thinkbaby sunscreen in the past and like it so much that I wanted to buy the 6 oz one. I&#x27;ve read in other reviews that the sunscreen was very watery when they received it but this one wasn&#x27;t. I also like that it doesn&#x27;t expire until Jan 2017 but I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ll use it up way before it expires! It&#x27;s great for sensitive skin and doesn&#x27;t leave a white residue like other mineral sunscreens do. I love the ingredients too! It&#x27;s well worth the price!</li>
    <li> I read so many great reviews and was super excited to have a more affordable yet safe sunscreen to use for my little ones. The first and only time I used it we were at a field and track competition and it was very sunny. I was super impressed when I applied it as it smelled pleasant (unlike Badger which smells awful!), was creamy and easy to smooth out, and didn&#x27;t leave my kids looking like slimey white ghosts. In the morning, before the sun was blazing and the kids started sweating, it seemed to work well, but once things heated up, this sunscreen failed miserably. I felt like I was constantly reapplying it trying to make sure they were covered. My son who was running and sweating got burned badly and my daughter who was in shade most of the time got red also. I am so incredibly disappointed! There is NO way this sunscreen will keep your LO safe if swimming, playing outside, or at the beach.</li>
    <li> Being using since last six months.  Love it.  I am not going to change sun block anymore</li>
    <li> Highly rated on EWG, smells good (sort of an orangey/tropical scent), rubs in easily and is not overly greasy.  This will be our go-to sunscreen from now on!</li>
    <li> Love this sunscreen for my 2 year old son. It rubs in well and he hasn&#x27;t had a burn yet and we are outside all the time. I keep buying more.</li>
    <li> I had originally ordered a smaller size from another Amazon vendor and the product was delivered leaky and you could literally hear the slush in the tube! You had to shake it to get it even a little creamy. But I still liked the sunscreen so I ordered a larger size from here and I was surprised that it had no separation! Came out creamy just like I had originally expected when I ordered the first one. Much better experience and product from this vendor. The sunscreen still comes out pretty white but not nearly as much as others so you don&#x27;t have to rub in as much. Definitely works. I get darker fast in the sun and this slowed it down tremendously. I use it on myself and my 2 yr old.</li>
    <li> Best toddler sunscreen I have found. Rubs in like butter and doesn&#x27;t smell horrendous. I also used it on my 3 month olds legs and arms one day when the sun was unavoidable, he has super sensitive skin, and was fine.</li>
    <li> Very best sunscreen. This is the only thing I&#x27;ll use on my kids because of the safety ratings and matte application. Isn&#x27;t greasy and lasts awhile. I do recommend spreading in your hands before applying. Great stuff!!</li>
    <li> Wonderful as in blocking the UVA and UVB. The consistency is thick and if you put on too much then it&#x27;ll leave white marks on everywhere. But it&#x27;s very effective and not so oily. Love it.</li>
    <li> Thinkbaby sunscreen is utilized by some of the top pro surfers, endurance athletes and pro cyclists.  The demands of these users is extreme. If applied correctly, this is one of the most effective sunscreens available. It has the highest SPF, H20 resistance and UVA/UVB coverage allowed by the FDA.  The FDA estimates that an adult should use about an ounce of sunscreen for their whole body.  You have to reapply every two hours and after being in the water.  This is a straight up physics problem.  If you used correctly, the sunscreen performs fantastically.  If you over spread the sunscreen, its akin to applying less than the amount needed for adequate protection.  It works in the desert, it works on Mt. Everest and it works in Hawaii. It was also the first sunscreen to pass Whole Foods Premium Care requirements.</li>
    <li> I started researching sunscreens that are safe and effective for children, and I stumbled upon this brand. I was impressed by all the really good reviews here on Amazon as well as other websites so I decided to purchase it and give it a try. We live in Hawaii so going to the beach is a normality for us, and we used this sunscreen for the first time yesterday. My children who never get sunburned got very burnt, and so did I even after reapplying it several times. I had high hopes for this sunscreen, but instead it will be going in the trash.</li>
    <li> This is awful, I ordered these in advance (ordered it in March 2015, and received ones that are exp 07/16). I opened a brand new sunscreen and it&#x27;s gone bad! As in it smells rotten AND it won&#x27;t mix no matter how much I shake the bottle. I am upset since I purchased three total of these huge 6oz sunscreens and two&#x27;s already gone bad. If you are going to purchase this, then purchase as needed and don&#x27;t bother stocking up because you won&#x27;t be able to use it</li>
    <li> Love love love this sunscreen. It lasts longer then I expected and my kids don&#x27;t have any pink even after swimming for hours and me forgetting to reapply!!</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try this brand given the glowing reviews but after 2-3 weeks of use, my 5 year old son&#x27;s skin looks completely dry and weatherbeaten.  The worst is around his neck - it looks like the neck of a 50 year old cowboy :(  Before I started using this product, his skin was completely fine and healthy looking.  I didn&#x27;t realize that it was this product that was causing such a change in his skin until I started researching online and found similar complaints of this product drying out the skin.  Perhaps this works well for oily, or even normal, skin but if you have any hint of dry skin, I would stay far away from this product.</li>
    <li> Have been using this sunscreen for about 3+ years and have been really pleased with it. Occasionally we try new brands, but always end up coming back to this one. We don&#x27;t like to use sunscreens with carcinogens or other gunk in them, so this initially appealed to us because it gets such a great rating from the EWG (Environmental Working Group). They have a list on their website (skincare.org) of the best sunscreens with the least toxins (you can also look up just about any make up product for that matter). I went to a concert last year and used this sunscreen (was outside for hours in the sun) and didn&#x27;t get burned. My friends weren&#x27;t so successful with their sunscreens. It&#x27;s our go-to for the kids and no one has experienced a burn. Like *all* sunscreens, though, effectiveness only lasts a few hours and then you must re-apply. This sunscreen is also great for daily use under make up or foundation. You really don&#x27;t need a primer if you put this on because it basically acts like one and make-up sets really well over it. (I recommend using a ColorScience powder foundation over it and then you are good to go all day, plus this combo won&#x27;t cause breakouts). We recently tried Raw Elements sunscreen because it gets such great EWG ratings, however it is much greasier than Thinkably/ThinkSport. This brand is on the thicker end too, but not the same degree of greasiness, although I wouldn&#x27;t go as far as describing it as matte.</li>
    <li> love this sunscreen! smells great, is safe and works well.</li>
    <li> we all think it smells good, size got us through the summer, rubs on easily, love it!</li>
    <li> After reading many reviews for many different products in my search for a non-toxic sunscreen for my children (4 years old and 7 months old) I chose this product, and was very pleased with my selection. I used it on both of my kids at the beach. Both of my children are fair skin, blonde hair, blue eyes, so they tend to burn fairly easily. This product worked well and I will continue to buy--it was easy to apply (I have tried other sunblocks that are too thick to rub in). This was very important for the seven month old who doesn&#x27;t sit still. Neither of my children burned after being in and out of the sun for several hours while swimming. Also, my seven month old has had various skin conditions including eczema. After reading the reviews for this product, I was concerned about whether the product would cause skin irritation. It didn&#x27;t after applying for several days in a row. Highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This is the only sunscreen my 4yr old has ever been able to use. So thankful for the extensive reviews on Amazon that led me to EWG&#x27;s website and opened my eyes to the truth about sunscreen. No wonder he was breaking out in hives when any of the typical kids sunscreens were touching his skin...they were full of chemicals that are not meant to be put on/in our bodies!  (Yes, IN because many absorb into the bloodstream). I am not an over the top organic all natural mom type either.  I don&#x27;t worry myself over every single product, I just try to be wise about the obvious stuff.  I don&#x27;t think I can say it any better than the other reviewers so I&#x27;ll just say, keep reading.  Do the research.  I use this on my 4yr old, 2yr old and my 6 month old, all of whom have sensitive pale skin.  It smells good, rubs in pretty well without looking pasty, and most importantly, they don&#x27;t break out or burn.  I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Love this suncream for the entire family.&lt;br /&gt;I did some research on the EWG site and realised that most regular suncreams (even those marketed for babies) contain hideous toxic ingredients. We tested a bunch of non-toxic suncreams over the summer and this was our favourite.&lt;br /&gt;It does go on a bit thick at first but it is absorbed pretty well and it smells lovely</li>
    <li> Well rated product, safe and effective.  I was born and raided and live in Phoenix, AZ.  I have had countless sun burns.  Having kids now, the connection between skin cancer and sun burns scare me but so do toxic sun screens.  My kids are 3 and 4 and have never had a sun burn!  I&#x27;ve been using Think Baby for the past 2 years and couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> This is a great sunscreen! My son has extremely sensitive skin has had broken out with just about every sunscreen we&#x27;ve ever tried--but not this one! It&#x27;s not heavy, and rubs in very easily. Bonus: it smells great!</li>
    <li> Smells good, but hard to rub in. I looked like a ghost no matter how hard I tried to rub it in. On hairy arms/legs and facial scruff? Forgedda&#x27;bout it.</li>
    <li> Great product. Smooth an easy to apply, smells nice like coconut.wish they made a mineral based spray.</li>
    <li> Goes on great and provides great protection for my little ginger.</li>
    <li> Works so well for us! Be sure to apply well, at least 20 minutes before getting outside, otherwise any kind of sunblock doesn&#x27;t work properly. We use it on ourselves and our son. It is recommended by EWG&#x27;s website and for that we are happy to find a good, safe sunblock.</li>
    <li> I bought this sunscreen last year closer to the end of summer. I didn&#x27;t get a chance to use it, but now (6 months later)I pulled it out of the medicine cabinet and the sunscreen has burned a hole through the lid on the top. Has anyone else experienced this?? Very strange.</li>
    <li> I loved this sunscreen.  When I&#x27;m in the sun for more than 15 minutes without sunscreen I encounter sun poisoning, a rash that burns.  It&#x27;s not fun!  Makes for a miserable vacation to say the least.  So, I&#x27;m always looking at new sunscreens.  I used this 50 spf sunscreen 2 weeks ago on a cruise &amp; loved it.  It is rated as one of the best that doesn&#x27;t give you cancer according to the lists I&#x27;ve read. http://breakingnews.ewg.org/2012sunscreen/&lt;br /&gt;It isn&#x27;t like others that are rated the same but they are VERY hard to rub in &amp; leave you looking like a ghost.  The fragrance was pleasant.  I even still get a tan but know that I&#x27;m safe from skin cancer &amp; sun poisoning.  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Not too greasy, goes on easily. Protects well.</li>
