<li> I have verrrry curly hair that frizzes like crazy and the oil helps to keep it soft and pretty without it being oily!</li>
<li> I gave my poor husband a firm but gentle massage.</li>
<li> but it just wasn&#x27;t the same and not to mention, coconut oil made my hair unbelievably oily!</li>
<li> I mix my conditioner with a little oil and leave it in for about 2 minutes</li>
<li> I use this everyday after I shampoo</li>
<li> This light-weight oil has a lot in common with coconut oil.</li>
<li> Avocado Oil has an faint unpleasant scent but its overall uses outweigh the smell.</li>
<li> i added 4 spoons of this to my shea butter from this company and ill also add their shea butter</li>
<li> He suffers from Neuropathy..</li>

    <li> The avacado oil is great however the bottle doesn&#x27;t close tightly so it will leak if it isn&#x27;t in an upright position once opened. Maybe I just got a faulty cap aside from that I would recommend it :) overall, satisfied</li>
    <li> I love this oil and my hair love it as well.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! Love it for my face and for making body scrubs</li>
    <li> Looks good in the bottle!</li>
    <li> This light-weight oil has a lot in common with coconut oil. You can use this very light oil with absolutely everything. Its multiple uses include: hair, skin, cooking, etc,. I will definitely use this oil again.</li>
    <li> I use this to make body care and hair care items. My hair loves this stuff. Very good quality, fast shipping, secure packaging, and the price is right.</li>
    <li> Avacodo Oil given as Christmas as per grand daughter&#x27;s request.  Hope she finds it helpful and that she will enjoy using it.</li>
    <li> This oil is soon good for the skin. I use it in my lotions.</li>
    <li> Wow this is such a great oil so light it works great in soap, body butter bath bombs ... I used to use sweet almond oil in everything but once I tried this oil it&#x27;s my new favorite go to oil!! It has definitely bumbled my soaps up to a whole new level!! Highly reccomend!!</li>
    <li> I use this for my hair. I have verrrry curly hair that frizzes like crazy and the oil helps to keep it soft and pretty without it being oily! That was huge for me. I use this everyday after I shampoo I mix my conditioner with a little oil and leave it in for about 2 minutes and omg it&#x27;s like heaven. I did this same technique with coconut oil but it just wasn&#x27;t the same and not to mention, coconut oil made my hair unbelievably oily! So if you have natural hair and need something that&#x27;s gonna do it justice without looking shiny or greasy, use avocado oil!</li>
    <li> Avocado Oil has an faint unpleasant scent but its overall uses outweigh the smell. Use a essential oil to cover this smell. I use it everywhere on my body including my hair. Natural Essentials is a great seller.</li>
    <li> Good buy for the money.</li>
    <li> great pricing for the size.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok, I like jojoba oil much better</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve had a chance to use this for both cooking and cosmetic purposes. It works great! I love cooking with it and always use it when making flour tortillas. Great product!</li>
    <li> I use this oil along with sweet almond oil and EVOO for my hot oil treatments and my hair is thriving.  Definitely will be keeping this in my natural hair care routine.</li>
