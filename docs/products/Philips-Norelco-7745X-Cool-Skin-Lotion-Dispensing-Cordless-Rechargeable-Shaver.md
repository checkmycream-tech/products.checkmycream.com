### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Very impressive results.</li>
      <li>A great razor!</li>
      <li>It works great, though, and I have no complaints.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Waxing was great, but a pain to preform --</li>
      <li>Price and features are great.</li>
      <li>Definitely a great find.</li>
      <li>The cartriges work great too.</li>
      <li>Great for travel.</li>
      <li>I thought this would be perfect because he shaves in the shower, and I didn&#x27;t realize most shavers aren&#x27;t for use in and out of the shower.</li>
      <li>I prefer when he uses a manual razor, but this one still does a good job.</li>
      <li>(And being a musician, I don&#x27;t have to worry about leaving a good impression on office types.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>One sachet lasts me 4 or 5 shaves if I&#x27;m fairly frugal with it.</li>
      <li>And the gel smells nice, not overpowering.</li>
      <li>I just recieved this product and Ive got to say its the best shaver I have ever used, the lotion makes my face feel super duper clean, so if your looking for a good shaver,  this ones for you.</li>
      <li>shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I run it under warm water when I shave.</li>
      <li>I think it would be nice if the lotion came in a bottle.</li>
      <li>I use a pea-sized drop for each side of my face, and then the rest of the experience is all warm water.</li>
      <li>This is the best way I have found to get a clean, smooth shave.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The closeness of the shave is as good as I got from a prior Norelco Quadra, and I thought that was the best I had had from electric shavers.  </li>
      <li>He has used it about four times, and even though the manual says it takes around 3 weeks for your face to adjust, so far it is wonderful.</li>
      <li>Some were good (gave a close shave) for me, some not (I have a medium weight beard with light brown hair color).</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Norelco longer and a blade sometimes, but this particular \\&quot;Cool Skin\\&quot; shaver is great!</li>
      <li>He loves it, quick and easy and makes a close shave!!</li>
      <li>Love the fact you can use this in the shower..makes my mornings go a lot faster</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve even used shaving cream with it, but the lotion is better.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall I&#x27;m surprisingly satisfied.</li>
      <li>:) I&#x27;ll put the 2 \\&quot;R\\&quot; shavers out to pasture.</li>
      <li>Using the thumb is OK.</li>
      <li>One charge lasts a week or more.</li>
      <li>if you don&#x27;t have an electric shaver, this might be okay for you.</li>
      <li>I saw this shaver, tried it and love it.   </li>
      <li>I can say that I am glad I did.  </li>
      <li>unless I am gone more than 8-10 days.    </li>
      <li>But now I&#x27;m not, for sure.</li>
      <li>Then when I ran across the deal from Amazon, I purchased the Norelco-Phillips and have been satisfied with the shaving experience ever since.</li>
      <li>Product gives my fiance a decent shave but one of the adapter pieces isn&#x27;t that great.  </li>
      <li>For the lotion, it&#x27;s great, but I have to be honest -- I barely use it.</li>
      <li>This new one works great in the shower too.</li>
      <li>/&gt;- Very easy to clean under running water in the shower.</li>
      <li>A more advanced design would be to have the lotion delivered automatically.</li>
      <li>The most comfortable and closest shave is however obtained using the gel or lotion.</li>
      <li>Very nice razor, close shave, but battery life is nowhere near Braun&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>Cleaning is easy and it shaves close.  </li>
      <li>I found both worked fine.</li>
      <li>&#x27;fine&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>it.\\&quot; Fine</li>
      <li>A great razor, especially if you like to shave in the shower.</li>
      <li>Or do I need another light that flashes to tell me I can pump lotion just after the thing&#x27;s switched on?</li>
      <li>I also admittedly chose this one because it&#x27;s an awesome green.</li>
      <li>you suffer from any kind of shaving irritation, I highly recommend this model.</li>
      <li>The new shaver should shave as good or better than the older models.</li>
      <li>I use the Norelco 7745X Cool Skin Wet/Dry Cordless Rechargable Shaver with the Cool Skin Shave Lotion in the shower and my skin is irritation free.</li>
      <li>The good news is that I have no regrets buying this Cool Skin</li>
      <li>If you save against the grain, this might not be good enough for you.</li>
      <li>I think it was definitely worth the price I paid on Amazon, and I hope it becomes available again</li>
      <li>electric, no, isn&#x27;t literally as close as a true hand razor.</li>
      <li>I have an older \\&quot;Advantage\\&quot; that I have used and liked it very much.</li>
      <li>3) Constantly pressing the dispenser for more gel can be a pain in the neck, and you go through those cartridges quickly (one every 10 days at most).  </li>
      <li>He says his old Quadra works better than the 7745X Cool Skin.</li>
      <li>it got it all the first time!</li>
      <li>He has fairly corse, stubbly black hair that needs shaved often, but with this razor, his face feels just as smooth as I&#x27;m used to.</li>
      <li>Great looking shaver, and one of the few that doesn&#x27;t look like my grandfather&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>Do I really need a flashing light to tell me to rinse the razor at the end of every shave?</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think this item is worth $100 though.</li>
      <li>Also, having a can of the shaving gel when you travel (checked baggage of course) can also come in handy if your Norelco runs out of charge, and you need to switch to that backup Gillette you should have in your shaving kit (I travel with enough cords as it is).</li>
      <li>It does shave as well as a blade (I use one of those too now and then) if you use it right</li>
      <li>/&gt;Great close shave and the gell is just right..</li>
      <li>It looks cool and the wet shave is nice</li>
      <li>It is very quiet and the lotion dispenser definitely makes shaving a joy.</li>
      <li>As a former Braun 360 user, I can assure you this razor works better than a Braun foil shaver.</li>
      <li>Long lasting - I have used it 10 days without recharging - great if you travel.  </li>
      <li>Seems to prevent ingrown hairs - which is something I run into when I use a blade consistently.  </li>
      <li>did run into one problem with my first shaver.  </li>
      <li>but* I never got any rashes or irriation, even during the first week I used it.</li>
      <li>The battery life is fine and the device styling is a little nicer than that of most electric shavers.</li>
      <li>I had been wanting to try the new Norelco-Phillips shaver for some time, but felt since I had paid so much for the Braun, I would wait until I got my money&#x27;s worth from it.</li>
      <li>He does not use the foam packets so much.</li>
      <li>, light colored hair might improve the performance but, my advice is to look for something else in the same price range.</li>
      <li>I bought this shaver for my boyfriend for Christmas this year, and I was really nervous because he has never used an electric shaver</li>
      <li>and I really wanted him to like it, even though I bought one in the mid-price range.</li>
      <li>He says it is gentle, gets all the tricky spots and no rash.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t mind the cost of the Nivea refills that much (see below)</li>
      <li>The improved design of the top of the razor ensures no water residue remains if hung to dry, and I really like the anodized aluminum vs. the plastic of the older model.</li>
      <li>The green color is super cool, and my wife thinks it has even improved the look of our shower! &lt;</li>
      <li>/&gt;Maybe our expectations were too high or the shaver really is lacking in performance.</li>
      <li>I ordered this shaver for my husband to replace his older Norelco Quadra.</li>
      <li>Nice when you are in a strange hotel in a strange time zone and waking up jet lagged but needing to look presentable for a meeting.    </li>
      <li>I like the shaver and highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>The \\&quot;R\\&quot; brand shavers are loud and vibrate too much.</li>
      <li>To use this right, just buy regular shaving gel, put it on your face, wait 30 seconds for the gel to soften your beard, and go for it.  </li>
      <li>He loves the new cordless one.</li>
      <li>WOW!</li>
      <li>The first lasted two years, but this after extensive travel all over the world.  </li>
      <li>While he still doesn&#x27;t shave every day (must be a guy thing), he uses it without prompting pretty regularly.</li>
      <li>I wish Norelco had come up with a way for this razor to use a standard charger jack of some kind, as having another electrical cord when I travel (especially one that does not work with multiple corded adaptors such as I-go)</li>
      <li>If it weren&#x27;t for that great green color I could have bought the cheaper model and got the same functionality at less cost.</li>
      <li>All you really need is a low battery indicator.</li>
      <li>I wish they could have developed a refillable dispenser.</li>
      <li>I will probably give my old Norelco to someone, or just keep it for old time sake.</li>
      <li>Quick charging - less than an hour to charge.  </li>

    <li> But now I&#x27;m not, for sure. I have tough skin, so shaving with a razor never left cuts for me. But it was a mixed blessing, because shaving with a razor, indeed, caused a rather bad acne problem until I switched to waxing for almost two years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Waxing was great, but a pain to preform -- So I finally decided to spend my birthday money on an electric razor. All my friends insisted I&#x27;d regret it, and that they don&#x27;t work. The whole usual spiel about getting a rash, and just wasting my money. But being the stubborn person I am, I had to find out for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As usual, my friends were full of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, not only do I not get acne with an electric razor, *but* I never got any rashes or irriation, even during the first week I used it. I have dark, black facial hair, that is somewhat thinned out due to the waxing. But they&#x27;re also hard and &#x27;fine&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The electric, no, isn&#x27;t literally as close as a true hand razor. But it&#x27;s close enough for the conveniance -- It&#x27;s quicker than a blade for me, and easier since I don&#x27;t have to sit there digging hairs out of the blades so I could continue shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I run it under warm water when I shave. For the lotion, it&#x27;s great, but I have to be honest -- I barely use it. I use a pea-sized drop for each side of my face, and then the rest of the experience is all warm water. It works great, though, and I have no complaints. Not to mention that I&#x27;ve been using one lotion pouch for *weeks* now... But I guess I should mention I only need to shave every 2-3 days, not every day. A little stubble never hurt anyone. (And being a musician, I don&#x27;t have to worry about leaving a good impression on office types.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m surprisingly satisfied. I also admittedly chose this one because it&#x27;s an awesome green. My only REAL complaint is that, considering the nature of this razor, I can&#x27;t shave between for my eyebrows. So for this, I&#x27;ve now gotten into the routine of tweezing, if only to avoid the putrid unibrow.if only to avoid the putrid unibrow.</li>
    <li> I used to use a Braun Flex shaver and had been disappointed with the shave I received. I had been wanting to try the new Norelco-Phillips shaver for some time, but felt since I had paid so much for the Braun, I would wait until I got my money&#x27;s worth from it. Then when I ran across the deal from Amazon, I purchased the Norelco-Phillips and have been satisfied with the shaving experience ever since.</li>
    <li> My husband HATES shaving. He usually gets a rash and ingrown hairs. So he shaved once a month whether he needed it or not. Well, he LOVES this shaver. He says it is gentle, gets all the tricky spots and no rash. And the gel smells nice, not overpowering. While he still doesn&#x27;t shave every day (must be a guy thing), he uses it without prompting pretty regularly. Definitely a great find.</li>
    <li> I got it yesterday as a christmas present.  I charged it last night as instructed and used it today in shower.  It worked well. I also experimented using regular shaving cream on one side and found that it was a bit sharp doing it that way. I think the trick is in the lotion cartriges.</li>
    <li> Product gives my fiance a decent shave but one of the adapter pieces isn&#x27;t that great.  I don&#x27;t think this item is worth $100 though.</li>
    <li> For the last 15 years I have been a manual razor user.  I decided to try an electric razor and after researching found the Norelco 7745X to be just what I wanted.  I can say that I am glad I did.  It is very quiet and the lotion dispenser definitely makes shaving a joy.</li>
    <li> I bought this to my husband for christmas over a year ago, and he still uses it. Works well. He does not use the foam packets so much. just shaves under the shower.   I prefer when he uses a manual razor, but this one still does a good job.</li>
    <li> WOW! Thats all I have to say. As a former Braun 360 user, I can assure you this razor works better than a Braun foil shaver. Very impressive results. It is as close a Mach 3 if you only shave with the grain when you us a Mach. If you save against the grain, this might not be good enough for you.</li>
    <li> I purchased the 7775X and I purchased the model below the 7745X and they both seemed to out-perform the 7745X.  Although cleaning is easier, I do not find that this shaver removes the hair from my face with any efficacy at all. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I also am not pleased with the way the Nivea Gel/lotion is dispensed from this shaver.  I will not buy this again in the future and may have to purchase the 7775X to receive the shave I was accustomed to. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband for father&#x27;s day.  He had a very old Norelco that he used occasionally.    He loves the new cordless one.</li>
    <li> This is the second 7775X I have owned.  The first lasted two years, but this after extensive travel all over the world.  It does shave as well as a blade (I use one of those too now and then) if you use it right (see below)    Positives    1) Quick charging - less than an hour to charge.  2) Long lasting - I have used it 10 days without recharging - great if you travel.  3) Seems to prevent ingrown hairs - which is something I run into when I use a blade consistently.  My face definitely breaks out much less when I use this razor versus a blade (and I own some expensive blade razors as backup!).  4) So long as you follow instructions (don&#x27;t press down hard, but when you need to go over an area again, do it firmly) you won&#x27;t get nicked.  Nice when you are in a strange hotel in a strange time zone and waking up jet lagged but needing to look presentable for a meeting.    Negatives    1) A little expensive  2) The shaving lotion cartridges are also expensive - I would just buy a can of regular shaving Gel (eg Edge).   3) Constantly pressing the dispenser for more gel can be a pain in the neck, and you go through those cartridges quickly (one every 10 days at most).  If I wanted to redesign this shaver, I would junk the shaving dispensor entirely - I now find it just another moving part with the hinged lid.  4) I wish Norelco had come up with a way for this razor to use a standard charger jack of some kind, as having another electrical cord when I travel (especially one that does not work with multiple corded adaptors such as I-go) means I don&#x27;t take the cord unless I am gone more than 8-10 days.    To use this right, just buy regular shaving gel, put it on your face, wait 30 seconds for the gel to soften your beard, and go for it.  This is the best way I have found to get a clean, smooth shave.  Gel in a can also has the advantage of going on thickly (versus the Coolskin dispensor) and not drying up quickly.  Also, having a can of the shaving gel when you travel (checked baggage of course) can also come in handy if your Norelco runs out of charge, and you need to switch to that backup Gillette you should have in your shaving kit (I travel with enough cords as it is).</li>
    <li> I ordered this shaver for my husband to replace his older Norelco Quadra. After trying it, we are returning it to Amazon. He says his old Quadra works better than the 7745X Cool Skin. It looks cool and the wet shave is nice but it takes longer to shave and the closeness is not up to expectations. The new shaver should shave as good or better than the older models. The shaver does work so if you don&#x27;t have an electric shaver, this might be okay for you. My husband has dark, coarse hair and the blades just weren&#x27;t \\&quot;cutting it.\\&quot; Fine, light colored hair might improve the performance but, my advice is to look for something else in the same price range. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Maybe our expectations were too high or the shaver really is lacking in performance. There was only one review when we made the purchase and maybe this will help others out there before money is wasted.</li>
    <li> The Norelco 7745X works as advertised... I&#x27;ve only had it for a few weeks though. Cleaning is easy and it shaves close.  The colors are a little bit loud.</li>
    <li> this time I sticking to Norelco! I&#x27;ve had the Remington shavers but didn&#x27;t use them for very long. I&#x27;ve used Norelco longer and a blade sometimes, but this particular \\&quot;Cool Skin\\&quot; shaver is great! I think the green color makes it look cool too. I have an older \\&quot;Advantage\\&quot; that I have used and liked it very much. The \\&quot;R\\&quot; brand shavers are loud and vibrate too much. I let my beard go for 3 days and the \\&quot;R\\&quot; shaver didn&#x27;t even get all of it even with a preshave lotion. I did the same with the Norelco and with the lotion it got it all the first time! Price and features are great. I will probably give my old Norelco to someone, or just keep it for old time sake. :) I&#x27;ll put the 2 \\&quot;R\\&quot; shavers out to pasture. This new one works great in the shower too. I&#x27;ve even used shaving cream with it, but the lotion is better. I think it would be nice if the lotion came in a bottle. The cartriges work great too. Great for travel. Buy this shaver and you&#x27;ll like it a lot.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver about a month ago because I&#x27;d had enough of cutting myself with my viscious Gillette Mach 3. Three cuts at a time on the cheek. Ouch! The good news is that I have no regrets buying this Cool Skin and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be going back to the Mach 3 any time soon. Like all things tho&#x27;, pluses and minues: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Pluses: &lt;br /&gt;- No more cuts. &lt;br /&gt;- Shaves as close as my Mach 3 with less irritation. &lt;br /&gt;- I can shave in the shower, which is absolutely essential! &lt;br /&gt;- Great looking shaver, and one of the few that doesn&#x27;t look like my grandfather&#x27;s. The green color is super cool, and my wife thinks it has even improved the look of our shower! &lt;br /&gt;- Very easy to clean under running water in the shower. &lt;br /&gt;- One charge lasts a week or more. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Minuses: &lt;br /&gt;- Takes about 2 - 3 three times as long as shaving with a razor. &lt;br /&gt;- I don&#x27;t mind the cost of the Nivea refills that much (see below), it&#x27;s the waste generated by the empty sachets that bugs me. I wish they could have developed a refillable dispenser. &lt;br /&gt;- The \\&quot;advanced LED display\\&quot; is pointless. Do I really need a flashing light to tell me to rinse the razor at the end of every shave? Or do I need another light that flashes to tell me I can pump lotion just after the thing&#x27;s switched on? If it weren&#x27;t for that great green color I could have bought the cheaper model and got the same functionality at less cost. All you really need is a low battery indicator. &lt;br /&gt;- You pump the lotion or gel onto the heads with your finger or thumb. Using my finger gave me cramp in my hand. Using the thumb is OK. A more advanced design would be to have the lotion delivered automatically. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Finally, what about the lotion and gel? I found both worked fine. At a pinch I&#x27;ve also used ordinary shaving foam and even just water applied directly to my face. The most comfortable and closest shave is however obtained using the gel or lotion. I just bought a 5-pack of lotion at Target for $4.99. One sachet lasts me 4 or 5 shaves if I&#x27;m fairly frugal with it. So that works out at about 25c per shave which isn&#x27;t too bad. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;All in all recommended for those who are thinking of switching from razor to electric. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I just recieved this product and Ive got to say its the best shaver I have ever used, the lotion makes my face feel super duper clean, so if your looking for a good shaver,  this ones for you.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver for my boyfriend for Christmas this year, and I was really nervous because he has never used an electric shaver and I really wanted him to like it, even though I bought one in the mid-price range. I thought this would be perfect because he shaves in the shower, and I didn&#x27;t realize most shavers aren&#x27;t for use in and out of the shower. He has used it about four times, and even though the manual says it takes around 3 weeks for your face to adjust, so far it is wonderful. He has fairly corse, stubbly black hair that needs shaved often, but with this razor, his face feels just as smooth as I&#x27;m used to. He says it doesn&#x27;t get quite as close as if he were to shave up and down with a razor, but it&#x27;s not a huge difference, and we won&#x27;t be returning it. I think it was definitely worth the price I paid on Amazon, and I hope it becomes available again so other people have the opportunity to try it.</li>
    <li> A great razor, especially if you like to shave in the shower. I somehow lost a previous, earlier model that also dispenses lotion, which is why I bought this one. The battery would still hold enough charge for 2 weeks of shaving even after 6 years if care is taken to fully discharge the battery each time. I anticipate this one will be the same. It currently holds a charge for 3 weeks of daily shaving. The improved design of the top of the razor ensures no water residue remains if hung to dry, and I really like the anodized aluminum vs. the plastic of the older model. The gel packs last awhile, but I use shower gel as a lubricant so they&#x27;re only used for traveling. I don&#x27;t care for the case as much, and the replacement blades are expensive (~$25-30), but once a year isn&#x27;t too bad and still cheaper than disposables or blades in the long run. A great razor!</li>
    <li> Love the fact you can use this in the shower..makes my mornings go a lot faster&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great close shave and the gell is just right..letting the blades glide across you&#x27;re face&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good battery life but why not just charge it after every use</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used electric shavers for a long time.  Some were good (gave a close shave) for me, some not (I have a medium weight beard with light brown hair color). Although I never experienced much discomfort with electric shavers, starting about two years ago it was, for whatever reason, becoming a constant problem. I was getting a constant neck rash no matter what shaver I used. I saw this shaver, tried it and love it.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The closeness of the shave is as good as I got from a prior Norelco Quadra, and I thought that was the best I had had from electric shavers.  I use the Nivea lotion and I have had absolutely no irritation since the day I started using the shaver.  While it may, as some reviewers have noted, take a little longer to shave then with a razer, I have not noticed any increase in shaving time over prior electric shaver. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I did run into one problem with my first shaver.  A small plastic part became dislodged (the part where the lotion comes through when you push the pump) and try as I might, I could not reconnect it.  I contacted Norelco service and they directed me to their service center.  Although it took too long (about 6 weeks), they sent me a brand new shaver without cost, which I&#x27;ve used ever since without incident.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you suffer from any kind of shaving irritation, I highly recommend this model.</li>
    <li> I have always had delicate facial and neck skin. Dry electric shavers and blade razors always left me with skin irritations. I use the Norelco 7745X Cool Skin Wet/Dry Cordless Rechargable Shaver with the Cool Skin Shave Lotion in the shower and my skin is irritation free. Never have I had a closer shave. I shave every day and I get 7 days of shaving on a single charge. I like the shaver and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Works with regular shaving foam if you don&#x27;t want to use the pricey Nivea cartridges, has no problem getting wet in the shower. This is what I needed, and what I got. The shave isn&#x27;t as close as a blade, and you&#x27;ll want a mirror if you use it in the shower. The battery life is fine and the device styling is a little nicer than that of most electric shavers.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver for my 17 year son for Christmas.  He loves it, quick and easy and makes a close shave!!</li>
    <li> Very nice razor, close shave, but battery life is nowhere near Braun&#x27;s. And the fact that I can&#x27;t leave it on charger is very annoying.</li>
