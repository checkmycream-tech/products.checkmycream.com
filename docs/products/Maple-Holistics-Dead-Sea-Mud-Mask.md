<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Smells wonderful and tightens skin!!love this product and will purchase again!</li>
    <li> I love the tingly sensation when first applying this mask. I have one other clay mask I use about once a week to tighten and cleanse pores, and this one works as well, if not better. I love that this is organic, which my other mask is not. My face looks tight, shiny, and beautiful after using this. I&#x27;ll buy this again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it once and so far I love it. I have really sensitive skin and it did not break me out, only problem was it kind of dried my skin out but not bad! Over all i love it.</li>
    <li> Incredible product!! Highly recommended, I have suffered from bad acne, oily skin and acne scars. I have tried everything from the cheapest known products to stuff I can&#x27;t even afford. This is so far the only product that has helped with my skin! I have gone out of my way to have my close friends try this product to prove how amazing it is, this is definitely a product I plan on keeping in my facial routine!</li>
    <li> Very easy to use and clean up and leaves skin so soft</li>
    <li> It tingles, but it has such a great smell! It goes on wonderfully.  Finger tip of mud covers about half my face. A little mud goes a long way!! It leaves your face a bit dry but nothing my regular moisturizer didn&#x27;t take care of. Wonderful!!</li>
    <li> I just tried this for the first time. It has great reviews so I thought I&#x27;d try it.&lt;br /&gt;I have combination skin with frequent break outs.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving it three stars for now because when I first put it on the essential oil smells are really strong and my face felt like it was burning.&lt;br /&gt;I immediately washed it all off after about 5 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;I tried it again but only applied it to a small area (nose &amp; chin) it was tingly but as it started drying the feeling subsided.&lt;br /&gt;After washing it off I&#x27;ll admit my skin feels super soft and more firm.&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ll see if there are any adverse outcomes in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;Will update review upon next use.</li>
    <li> When i got this in the mail the lid of the jar was screwed on weirdly so it was spilling its liquids everywhere and wasted alot of it. Besides that this product very nice it was a little tingly but when I washed it off mt face felt very nice and smooth. It was better than any other products I have used.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:30b38926d58613cb9711841f7778a9ce]] When you open the container you get a strong smell of concentrated sage. It is not a pretty flowery scent, but rather earthy. I liked it. The clay itself is very thick. I have used other face masks before and this one definitely feels different. It is much thicker, it is not creamy. If you have tried pottery making it feels like clay when you add a bit of water to it. Not surprising, since this is mud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am attaching a collage of 4 photos to illustrate this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;✔ Photo #1 shows the tub the cover off&lt;br /&gt;✔ Photo #2 shows the mud in the tub&lt;br /&gt;✔ Photo #3 shows mud as I picked up some with my finger, this photo gives you a good idea of texture and thickness&lt;br /&gt;✔ Photo #4 shows the mud spread on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you put the mud on your face it quickly dries and you really feel the pull on your skin. The container came with no instruction, nor did I find instructions on Maple Holistics web site. I was not sure how long to leave the mud on my face for. I gave it 15 minutes. When I was ready to remove it I used a wet paper towel to clean it off my face. I figured mud may not be good for my septic system and doing it with the paper towel allowed me to toss the paper towel with mud into the waste basket. And finish with a face rinse. After the mud was removed my skin felt really nice, very clean. The whole process made me think of detailing my car. I have been using claying preparation to clean my car to remove the deposits from the paint for years and my car always looks great after I clay it. My skin felt exactly the same way, removing the mud from my skin removed debris, dead skin cells, small blemishes. It felt and looked terrific.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only wish is that this preparation had instructions! How long should I leave it on my face? How often should the mask session be repeated? Since the removal is a fairly time consuming process I plan to use the mask once a week on the weekend, leaving the mud on m face for 15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mud mask is provided by Maple Holistics.  If Maple Holistics follows reviews and they might be able to provide additional instructions as comments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ali Julia reviewing the mud on m face for 15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mud mask is provided by Maple Holistics.  If Maple Holistics follows reviews and they might be able to provide additional instructions as comments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ali Julia review</li>
    <li> I have acne and have struggled with it for years. This has helped immensely. Thanks</li>
    <li> This product really works for all my facial skin problems. I work at a highly stressful government job, and I look forward to putting my mud mask on after work while I relax. Since using it, I&#x27;ve noticed I don&#x27;t have as many breakouts and my skin is a lot less oily. The dark circles underneath my eyes are gradually disappearing as well.</li>
    <li> Loved it, tightens really fast, the outcome was amazing, some of my lines by my eyes went away, my face felt 10 years younger, and so clean. I am glade I got this as a gift I am now a loyal fan.</li>
    <li> Wow! This mask is simply amazing! Not only does it cleans your skin but it also minimizes your pores!! My blackheads were reduced and my tone is more even and clear. The best mask I&#x27;ve ever used. Next is their clay mask!</li>
    <li> This product was amazing! For a man who likes to wash his face, this is the best product hands down.</li>
    <li> I recently have had an illness that doctors cant seem to diagnose. It has left scars on my face so i wanted to try this simply for that, however less wrinkles and smaller pores are great too! I put it on and let it dry and left it on for anothern20 mins or so..washed it off and instantly saw results! The redness from my scars had lightened up quite a bit. My skin felt tightened but in a good way! It was also soft and i did see less visible pores. I will keep using this product because it really works! Thank U!</li>
    <li> This mud mask is awesome. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love it! Noticed a difference right away! Definitely will be buying this and make it a regular regime. Waiting for a peel off mask. I will add that you use a old or dark face cloth.</li>
    <li> I purchase this product for my husband to use because he doesn&#x27;t like to buy anything to take care of his skin, especially his face. He was reluctant in trying on the mask but it was worth it because his huge pores are beginning to disappear. It also took away his oily skin. After using the product about 3 weeks now, he is currently just using product once a week but he continue to wash his face every night before going to bed. If you have oily skin and huge pores, I would recommend trying this product.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this stuff!! I received this from my sister and I can honestly say it is amazing! I have a major problem with very large pores and therefore I am super prone to blackheads, acne, and blemishes. I have searched and tried all sorts of products that can help decrease pores and not much has helped. This product however, definitely helped tighten the skin and reduce the problem areas! It has a bit of a different scent but that part is completely overlooked by the sheer quality of the product and you can even feel it working. It leaves my skin completely smooth and younger feeling. It is also affordable!!!!!!!!!!!!! Definite hands down a great product! Looking forward to trying additional products from Maple Holistics!!</li>
    <li> This Dead Sea Mud Mask is a wonderful product! I love using this on my face because it leaves my skin feeling so soft and smooth and looking great! It&#x27;s very easy to use and to apply, and also easy to rinse off. It&#x27;s really a wonderful face mask! I received a sample of this product for reviewing purposes.</li>
    <li> This mud mask is definitely a favorite, my skin sometimes gets oily patches and breakouts and after using this for 20 to 30 minutes my pores sre smaller and my skin is smooth and clear. I will use this again!</li>
    <li> I love the dead sea mud mask from you&#x27;d company. My skin feels smooth and is blemish free and is a MUST in your weekly facial routine!</li>
    <li> I like how it makes my skin feel afterwards but other than softness, I don&#x27;t see any other results.</li>
    <li> I LOVED IT!! Made my skin so soft.</li>
    <li> Such an amazing product! I&#x27;m a huge user of facial masks, and other skin products, and Maple Holistics Dead Sea Mud Mask is a must have! It leaves your skin hydrated, tightened, brightened, and even toned. I absolutely love this product, and am very happy with the results. This is definitely an essential product for me! Only the best!</li>
    <li> This product really works. After the first use, I saw that the skin on my face was softer and the oil and dirt was removed. I have tried other mud masks, but I prefer this one because it works best at eliminating oil buildup and keeping my face clean and clear. I use it only twice a week and apply a moisturizer afterwards. I recommend this product to anyone who wishes to keep their skin looking clean and beautiful!</li>
    <li> I received a free trial size sample, it lasted a full month!(Thanks again Maple Holistics! This is a proper sample!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it as stated, I noticed a general clearer skin. I&#x27;m plagued with acne like the millions of other poor souls out there, it blows! So I did use acne preventing techniques along the way along with lots of H20 through the month to rid all those free radicals/toxins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;m no expert with such products so it is mud, which at times did fall off though I kept myself occupied most times and went passed the 10 minutes it stated. Also, the product inside slowly lost it&#x27;s muddy consistency , slowly drying out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it does seem it has helped to provide radiant youthful skin overall and I would use again!</li>
    <li> I use this when my skin is hormonal with acne or during the summer months. It is also good to put it on your feet or make a foot bath for detox. I definately appreciate an all natural product, and they use quality dead sea mud that has the minerals. Inexpensive when compared to other branded glam muds, a little goes a long way. Makes a great gift too.</li>
    <li> This product helped a lot with my acne and blackheads, definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift and so far I really like it. It gives me a tighting feeling while I use it &amp; I like that. After my face looks refreshed. I&#x27;m not very familiar with this company like I said this was just a gift but once this is all gone I will definitely look into buying more product from them.</li>
    <li> Very refreshing dead sea mud mask to add to my skin care routine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard of dead sea mud, but never actually tried it. I&#x27;ve been getting some pretty bad breakouts so I decided to give it a try. I have oily acne prone skin btw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received the product, container was leaking. Although it was semi-wrapped, the product leaked out and the cap was loosely closed. The product pretty much burst out and got everywhere when I took off the cap. So I&#x27;m taking off a star for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than the packaging, I really like the product. Mud masks usually leave my skin dry and tight afterwards, but this one didn&#x27;t do that. Surprisingly, my skin was well moisturized after. One thing I didn&#x27;t like was that it was a bit tough to wash off. I used a toner with a cotton pad after and it picked up quite a bit of mud still on my skin. A few patches of acne on my cheeks got a lot less red the next day. Overall, it didn&#x27;t break me out, but it did leave my skin nice and smooth. I look forward to using it more.</li>
    <li> Love the way my skin feels and looks after using it. It actually shrinks my pores.</li>
    <li> I have always had problems with my skin. From dry skin large pores and occasional acne. I have tried other products but nothing has worked for me. A friend recommended this product so I decided to give it a shot. I have been using it for a few months now and I LOVE IT!! My skin looks younger softer and I&#x27;m noticing my pores have became smaller. Where have you been all my life??</li>
    <li> This mask is the best thing I have ever used! I put it on and let it dry for about 10 minutes. While it was on my face didn&#x27;t burn or anything. When I washed it off my skin was SO soft and was not red or anything! The next morning after using it my face just looked brighter and healthier. I can&#x27;t wait to use it again!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin especially to scented products but this mask doesn&#x27;t irritate me at all. I have noticed a better complexion since I&#x27;ve been using this mask, I use it once or twice a week right before bed. I&#x27;d recommend this product over an Indian healing clay mask for sure.</li>
    <li> Great Product I have been using daily and I notice a difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this mask and absolutely love it.  A little goes a long way.  It gently exfoliates and when you rinse it off your skin feels and looks toned and radiant.  I would buy as gifts for all the women in my life.  Worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been a habitual mask user (or fan) because I find masks to be a pain in the butt. In the past, masks have been hard to wash off or I&#x27;ve felt like my face has a film or chalky residue after rinsing (probably due to clays). I came across this brand on a continual search for natural and sustainable products without harsh chemicals—and decided to check this product out. I&#x27;m in my late twenties with combo skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The contents are a little thinner than masks I&#x27;ve tried in the past. This is great because it&#x27;s very easy to apply. Upon application, it&#x27;s a dark charcoal color and as it dries, you can tell because the color turns ashy. It was easy to rinse off (hands and water only, no need for a washcloth). My experience was that it didn&#x27;t sting, it had an earthy aroma, and my face felt and looked cleaner after use. I&#x27;m not sure Maple Holistics plans to end their Amazon sale (I wouldn&#x27;t pay $40 for this product) but I will continue to use this product at its current price point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few additional experiences and thoughts to note:&lt;br /&gt;- Shipping was incredible. The product arrived one day after ordering, instead of the expected two day delivery (with Prime).&lt;br /&gt;- The jar was leaking a little. I rinsed it off and it seemed ok. Could be a one-time packaging flaw.&lt;br /&gt;- Maple Holistics says on their website that a representative will reply to any customer inquiries within 48 hours. I&#x27;ve written to their support email address twice now without any response (it&#x27;s been longer than a week).&lt;br /&gt;- I do plan to take advantage of Maple Holistics current promotion (an honest review in exchange for a full-size product).</li>
    <li> I liked the mask as it works effectively but is very good for skin. It does not cause any side effects or harsh effects on skin. You feel the soft shiny skin after using this mask. My skin is sensitive and I choose products selectively, but this provided very good results on my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> My sensitive skin has always been difficult to maintain, so I was a little apprehensive about trying a new product. The nutrients in the Dead Sea Mud Mask product started calming my pores and alleviated my sensitive skin. As soon as I started using the mud with my fingers, I felt it calming my pores. It felt great and didn’t burn or harm my face at all. I started by placing a thick layer on my face and let it dry for about 10 minutes. As soon as I washed it off with warm water, my skin felt great.  This continued on to the next day also.&lt;br /&gt;Dead Sea Mud Mask has given me amazing results and l love using this skin treatment product. This is quickly becoming a product that will have a place on my shelf and I really like how natural it is.&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps some better instructions on using the mask would be beneficial but I am very pleased with it and will recommend to others.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  The mask has a pleasant, earthy fragrance and the texture of the mask is very smooth and goes on easily.  I left the mask on until it appeared dry, about 15 minutes.  I actually felt the product working as it dried.  I was surprised that after only one use  my pores looked smaller and my skin was softer.  I plan to use the Dead Sea Mud Mask 1x a week so as to achieve the toning benefits.  After reading some of the other reviews, I also plan to have my 2 teenagers try this to help them with their acne.  Would definitely purchase the Dead Sea Mud Mask again from Maple Holistics.</li>
    <li> Yuck. Hard to rinse off. Can do without it. Yuck is such a childest word, but it fits. No stars for this one. I also have a small tube of the Ahava mask. Will try tonight. Fingers crossed.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product because I have trouble skin (cystic acne, oily skin, and hyperpigmentation) so I am always trying different products that might be able to help out. I have tried dead sea products before such as the soap and actually liked the results. I tried this product the day I got it in the mail. Although it didn&#x27;t have instructions on how to use it I have some common knowledge on what should and shouldn&#x27;t be done just because I am always trying products for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this product because it dries up quickly after I put it on. I feel like this mask can be used for either a short amount of time or a longer amount of time, and that is exactly what I did. I actually gave my boyfriend a massage when I tried it so my mask was on for an hour. I also put the mask on his face when it was time to massage the front of his body so his mask was on for only 15 minutes. We both had similar thoughts about the product even though we both have different skin problems ( me acne, him a slight amount of wrinkles) and skin tone ( me dark skin, and he is white skin). He and I both felt like the product was working to better our skin. After washing the product off we both felt smoother and tighter skin instantly. Since I have acne the next day my skin had some small whiteheads, but it was due to the extraction effect the dead sea mud had on my skin. I had less breakouts that whole week. Since I have problem skin I am actually going to use it once a week for now, unless I read something about that not being beneficial. Overall great product, but I do wish instructions came with it ( although as I mentioned before for me it wasn&#x27;t really a problem because I always experiment and do my own thing with skin care products anyway).</li>
    <li> I should have wrote this review sooner.... I had to give this product away because when i put it on i started to sneeze ALOT and could not leave it on my face for the period of time instructed. I would like to know if i can get money back</li>
    <li> I love this MASK!!! I have oily acne prone skin (cystic acne). I love this mask so much I USE IT EVERY DAY! It&#x27;s helped my skin so much it&#x27;s become part of my every day skin care and will be purchasing another when it&#x27;s gone. I&#x27;ve been trying to use it as close to my eyes as possible because I&#x27;ve seen an improvement in tightening and toning around that area. I highly recommend this product to anyone with problem skin. I particularly like this product because there are not too many products available that are great for oily/ acne prone adult skin. Most skin care lines only sell oily anti-aging products that further break you out more. Where&#x27;s this product kills 2 birds with 1 stone ( anti-aging and helps prevent acne).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Josh&#x27;s wife</li>
    <li> This mask leaves your skin so soft! The smell is a little intense but I don&#x27;t think I could ever use another face mask. I have weird combination skin, oily yet dry in some spot. So hard to manage but this mask helps out a lot.</li>
    <li> I am in LOVE with this product!! I have seen such a huge transformation in my face. This Dead Seamineral youth mud mask has been part of my nightly routine. I look forward to my mask and feeling amazing skin after! Thank you!!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t mind the smell but, it worked wonderfully on my face. I felt and saw the difference after one use.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!!!!!!!!!!!! You can feel and see the change within moments of applying the mask.</li>
    <li> I wanted to wait a month to leave a review so I could actually see results but I ended up reviewing sooner. Here are the pros: leaves skin very soft, reduces pores but it doesn&#x27;t happen right away, it&#x27;s been about two weeks and I see a very small difference but it&#x27;s still a difference. Cons: doesn&#x27;t come with instructions, doesn&#x27;t rinse completely off so it will harden and stay stuck in your pores. I saw this while I was at work and was disgusted. I almost didn&#x27;t use it again because of this.  Smells funny but not too bad. I&#x27;ve been using this twice a week for 15 minutes, I apply it to my face when it&#x27;s wet. After I wash it off I then use my dove beauty bar to wash away the hard to rinse parts so that hardening won&#x27;t happen again, then I use a few drops of Argan oil and the results have been GREAT! My skin is softer and looks way younger, I also noticed that the darkness under my eyes are almost gone, however I&#x27;ve yet to see a reduction in my breakouts. They&#x27;re not bad but I would like them gone. All in all I would recommend this product as an addition to your beauty routine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this mask once and so far so good. I have pretty oily and acne-prone skin and I was hoping this mask can get rid of my horrible blackheads in my T-zone area. When I first applied the mask, my skin was very tingly and the herbal scent took some time to get used to. After washing the mask off, the blackheads were not completely gone but they have definitely diminished. I think that this product is definitely worth its money and I would recommend anyone to try this out![[ASIN:B00BLDCXOQ Dead Sea Mud Mask for Women, Men &amp; Teens - Enriched with Organic Mineral Youth Formula to Balance Oily Skin, Remove Acne, Wrinkles &amp; Exfoliate - Anti Aging Facial Cleanser Heals Oily Skin, Psoriasis, Minimizes Pores, Cleansing &amp; Detoxifying Scrub - 9oz]]</li>
    <li> Good mud, just a slight tingle to the face upon initial application. It SHOULD tingle, as REAL Dead Sea mud does, been there, done that and grateful to!</li>
    <li> this mask gave my skin new life you can actually feel it making your skin look and seem more youthful. the only thing I like as much as this from this brand is the opulence eye cream</li>
    <li> I got a free sample of this product through Maple Holistic&#x27;s website. I knew I would like it because I love their shampoo and conditioners. However, this exceeds my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;I have had blackheads on my nose that have been there for at least 5 years. I have tried everything. Well, I just used this mask for only the 2nd time, and I noticed when the mask was on that my nose had large black dots on it. Washed it off and the blackheads are GONE! Literally, I have tried 25+ products and this is the first to clear the blackheads. Miracle!!</li>
    <li> This stuff works great! My face feels tighter and fresher after use. I use it 2 times a week (my kids usually freak out when I put it on my face). I just starting using it as a regular regime on my clients when I do facials! I do recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, I use it once a week and it makes my face feel wonderful.</li>
    <li> This mask is definitely mud!  It goes on smoothly and smells very nice.  I didn&#x27;t see any directions on the jar, but I left it on for 15 minutes.  After removing, my skin felt very soft.  I&#x27;ve used it for 3 days.  I did have a small breakout the next day - to be expected.  Very easy to use.</li>
    <li> I really wanted this to be great, but after about 30 seconds it was burning so bad that I had to rinse it off. That being said, I can&#x27;t really rate how much it helps your skin but it was pretty painful for me. I don&#x27;t usually have sensitive skin so I&#x27;m not sure what the problem is.</li>
    <li> I am in my mid 40&#x27;s and have both oily skin and wrinkles starting.  I like the mask - it deep cleans and leaves your skin felling refreshed.  I use it at night a few times a week.  There are no directions when you receive the product and limited directions on the website.  The mask is very thick - it took me one use to realize that it is best to dampen your skin before applying.  The mask will go on easier and you will use less.  Let it dry for 10 to 20 minutes and rinse.  I use a paper towel to get the mask off - it is messy and it&#x27;s easier to discard a paper towel then try to get the thick mud out of your washcloth. It does clean your pores well and gives your skin a nice glow.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I had an extremely stressful month leading up to a Bar exam, and nothing was working. I was breaking out like crazy! I bought this product, which is reasonably priced and feels great. Here&#x27;s my process: I first wash my face, then spread it around my face, focusing on my problem areas (forehead and cheek), I leave on for 10 minutes, and wash with warm (NOT hot) water. Then I spray on toner, and moisturize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It feels tingly as it dries, and smells nice. After I wash it off my skin feels smooth, refreshed and a little tight. My pores look smaller!  I like doing a mask right before bed, so I don&#x27;t put make up on over it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use it more then 1-2 times a week. I haven&#x27;t gotten a rash or redness, which is great because I have had that reaction to other products. I would like more instructions on the package, but I follow typical masking rules -- I leave on for about 10 minutes, wash off with warm water. Works great for me! I noticed an improvement in about two weeks! (I used it twice a week when I first purchased this product.)</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! Works very well!</li>
    <li> Has a nice scent. Exfoliating and deep pore cleaning without over drying.</li>
    <li> Amazing mud! Just received it in the mail and used it immediately. Skin already feels better! Highly recommend buying this product. :)</li>
    <li> The first time i used it made a BIG difference. I have horrible acne and this was the ultimate fix. I will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> At first this mask is great. After using it for about a week I looked into my close up mirror and noticed my skin is horribly dry and the mud got stuck in my pores. I pulled some spots off with tweezers which quite honestly was gross and now I am noticing red spots around my face (not where I picked at the stuck mud). This stuff needs work.. I actually referred this to a couple of friends after my first two uses so now I&#x27;m extremely embarrassed to have to tell them I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I changed my review from a 4 star to a 1 star after I discovered how poorly it does its job.</li>
    <li> This product is really good.  I don&#x27;t have acne, but I do have some problems with blackheads, bumps under the skin, and enlarged pores.  I put this on and felt a tingling sensation and the mud mask really tightened.  When I washed it off my skin was really dry and I needed to put some moisturizer on my face, but the enlarged pores were gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that the skin looked tighter and smoother, although a little red.  The next morning my skin looked really good and the blackheads and bumps were gone.  My skin seems to be lot smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used masks before and they either didn&#x27;t do anything or caused a rash.  This product worked very well and was a completely safe and natural product.  I&#x27;m going to send some to my daughter, who has cystic acne, and see how it works on her problems.  The mud and herbs seems to pull toxins out of the skin, which might help with the acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative was that I would have liked to have some information and instructions; whether I was supposed to put the mask on a wet or dry face and how long to leave it on.</li>
    <li> i received a coupon code for this product about 2 weeks a go and i begun using it as soon as it arrived and like most people i made the mistake of not looking at the directions that are offered here on the product page.&lt;br /&gt; my first impression  when opening the mask was that it has a very pleasant scent, and the texture is not as grainy as i expected, anyhow i put the mask on my semi dry face and it felt very tick and upon taking it off i am&lt;br /&gt;immediately put off by the strong smell. i didn&#x27;t notice a difference on my face and of course no one would!!!! because i did it all wrong!! i came back to look at the instructions&lt;br /&gt;and did it the fallowing night, this time my face was washed and moist, i then used my wet finger to put the mask on my face and it was a nice even layer, after a few minutes i could feel it drying and getting tighter, after&lt;br /&gt;about 10 minutes i washed it off and well the smell is something you can get pass because the mask is totally worth it! i have been using it every other night for about 2 weeks&lt;br /&gt;and immediately after washing it off my face i put on my BB cream to get rid of the smell. i can honestly say that this is something that can be use daily if used correctly, i figured my skin with be dry but nope that&#x27;s not the case, my skin has never felt better, the&lt;br /&gt;amount that you get on this container is enough to last a long while so is definitely worth the money!</li>
    <li> Product did come with instructions so left on for about twenty minutes. Left skin feeling smooth and appeared to help minimize pores. Good studd</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll be honest...this stuff scared me when I opened it. It looked dark (MUD mask, duhh! Don&#x27;t know what I expected. Lol.), super thick, and intimidating. My mother swears by this company, so I had to try it for myself because she wouldn&#x27;t let me have some of hers. Well, now I know why. This stuff is awesome! I love the tingly sensation when you first apply it. My face feels so clean and smooth after washing it off and the blackheads on my nose have diminished...LOVE it.</li>
    <li> This product its really amazing, i just bought the product and realls very good, feels your face super nice and clean i recomend this product.</li>
    <li> This mask makes my face and neck feel soft, is easy to wash off and works well with oily skin. Well worth the price!</li>
    <li> A small jar of AMAZING mud! A little amount of mud goes a long way! It literally gets in every pore and that is what I was looking for! I love the feeling of tightening up! Easy to use and easy to clean! Will buy again! It&#x27;s cheap for Dead Sea mud and the quality is amazing. Pictures provided.</li>
    <li> I like the smell of this mud.  The jar looks small but it goes long way.  I usually need 25g mud to work on clients face.  It works great on scensitive skin as well.</li>
    <li> Good product, I love it! Will recommend to others.</li>
    <li> This stuff is a nice treat.  Pretty messy, and you don&#x27;t need a little, but it leaves your skin feeling really clean and fresh.</li>
    <li> I have tried this mask three times in less than one week, so I could write an honest review. I washed my face first, then I wet my face and gently rubbed a thin layer on my face, avoiding the eye area. I do have rosesea, so my skin is sensitive. I felt a slight burning sensation, but only until it dried which happened pretty quickly. The burning sensation wasn&#x27;t bad at all. It didn&#x27;t stop me from using the dead sea mud mask two more times. I left it on for ten minutes, then gently washed it off with my hands. My skin was slightly pink/red on my nose, cheeks and chin. (which usually happens with my sensitive/ rosesea skin), but my skin looked and felt better. This was my first mud mask ever. After three uses, I really do like the mask and will continue to use it. It doesn&#x27;t take a lot of product each time, so I see the mask being very economical for me to use, which it very important for me.</li>
    <li> I used this product twice each week. Amazingly it works and I really like it. I have already reordered two bottles.</li>
    <li> This product works great! I am always unsure about trying new products, especially ones that go on my face, but this one was truly worth it. It has a nice earthly smell to it, which I absolutely loved! It left my face feeling fresh, clean and smooth. I love this product and have told all my friends and family about it!</li>
    <li> Product works as advertised, Clears my oily skin before going to a function or just as a by-weekly routine. Thanks</li>
    <li> I just bought it and tried twice don&#x27;t see much difference but i would like to continue for few more times</li>
    <li> I love Vivo Per Lei Dead Sea Mud Soap Bar so I figured I&#x27;d love this mask. Boy was I wrong. The &amp;#34;mud&amp;#34; seeped into my pores, it was difficult to wash out completely. My face didn&#x27;t feel much different after using this product for weeks. I ended up throwing it out and got Aztex Secret Healing Clay and its been AMAZING! As for this product, it&#x27;s a big NO!</li>
    <li> this really works, just like i got in Israel. Thank you for making a solid product! will try some of ur other stuff</li>
    <li> I got this for my daughter. After 2 weeks she was excited about how smooth her skin was feeling and her acne was clearing up beautifully. A definite repeat purchase is in my future.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. Doesn&#x27;t do all that much for your skin so don&#x27;t expect any miracles. I&#x27;ve actually been to the dead see and they sell the same mud for $4-$5 so I&#x27;m shocked that they set the MSRP at $40. I guess you can do that with &amp;#34;Dead Sea&amp;#34; in large font on a label. Anyhow, I&#x27;d say this is an okay product at a &amp;#34;fair&amp;#34; price. At the end of the day, you&#x27;re paying for what is essentially mud.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF! I have decent acne, especially around that time of the month and this just helps soak it all up and make it go away! I also use this to help combat my oil and the nights I use this I always wakeup with a beautiful clear and tight face! I highly recommend this stuff! I give it to all my girl friends for the holidays!</li>
    <li> this is an amazing product. I would recommend it to everyone!!</li>
    <li> I have used better mud mask treatments. This one is fine but no better than the cheap stuff you can find at the drugstores.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for  mud mask for awhile now, but just never got around to purchasing one..When I saw this  Dead Sea Organic Mud Mask with Lavender, and other natural ingredients, I thought I couldn&#x27;t loose..I never had a problem with acne a day in my life when I was a teen, now since I&#x27;ve had three kids, my horomones have changed, and I have horrific acne!!  Scars have built up and I&#x27;m always looking for something to fade, firm my skin,  and let&#x27;s face it ladies, get that youthful glow back! I am soo impressed with this product.. I kept it on for about 20 minutes, then washed it off with warm water, followed by my toner, serum, and moisturizer!! After 2 applications, my face is smoother, and clearer. My 18 yr. old daughter asked me what I had been using, and when I showed her, she started the mask also!  The skin is the largest organ of your body, and whatever you put on it, is absorbed through to your bloodstream-- therefore, whatever I put on my face, I want to be good for me too!!  I love this mask, and I think you will too!!</li>
    <li> I have had better stuff.</li>
    <li> I will keep this review short and simple, the mud dries up your nasty oil, and the natural herbs and fruit oils nourish and exfoliate. I have only used it once so far and I do like it! My boyfriend got really freaked out when I walked into the bedroom wearing this dark grey mask, which was just a bonus IMO 😅</li>
    <li> This was awesome! Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> I have used this mask and it works as stated. It works to control greasy face and get rid of little to mild acne. It&#x27;s very easy and effective to use and honestly this mask has really helped a lot. All you have to do is damp face with some water and get the mid mask and put it on and let it dry for about 10-15 min then wash off. It&#x27;s very simple but very effective.</li>
    <li> This mask I use about once a week to dry up pimples, exfoliate and tighten and it does all that. The down side is that it makes my skin very dry like it sucked all the oil and moisture out of my face and left it like the desert. I really only use it if I feel like I need to do a massive cleanse to get rid of makeup build up and to exfoliate, it does that well. Not sure this mask is for me but will continue to shop around for the right Dead Sea mask. I have tried a few others that were ok, just very pricey.</li>
    <li> I have extremely oily skin and am always looking for new products to help tame my breakouts...this did the trick although I do recommend using every 2 days for best results!</li>
    <li> I love the way my skin feels after I apply this mask.  I just wish the smell was less stronger.</li>
    <li> I was a bit hesitant to give my review but i cant hold it anymore its fantastic! I have moderate to severe acne and tried different kinds of dead sea mud mask but this product its so true. My acne has significantly cleared in a week. I will update you all as time goes on.</li>
    <li> The mask is easy to apply -- not messy and not difficult to keep out of my eyes or away from my hairline. The lavender fragrance is stronger than I originally expected, but quite pleasant. I&#x27;ve just started using the mask, but so far I&#x27;ve been very happy with the quality of the product and with the way my skin has responded. I plan to continue using this several times a week going forward.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of facial masks in my time and I have to say that this is one of my favorites.  Unlike a lot of other mud masks on the market, this one is not slimy or goopy and it dries quickly.  Although I feel a slight burning sensation when I first apply the mask, that feeling quickly fades, and after washing if off, my face feels silky smooth and clean.  My only issue with the mask is that my container arrived only 2/3 filled.  One of the pictures posted by another reviewer shows the container filled to the top with the product, but that was not the case with the jar I received.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  After just one application I noticed a drastic difference in my skin.  I&#x27;ve had trouble with red, blotchy skin in addition to mild acne, particularly in the summer time.  After applying the mask my skin was noticeably softer and calmer.  I couldn&#x27;t believe how little of the mask you needed to cover your entire face (it was probably just about the size of a quarter).  Its a great value since so little goes a long way.  Definitely have to clean your sink after use, but it cleans up very quickly and easily.  Excellent product.</li>
    <li> This mask is amazing. It always leaves me feeling refreshed! I absolutely love it. The first time I used it, I had a sunburn, and it burned so I don&#x27;t recommend using it when you have a sunburn. Lol. Great product</li>
    <li> Great stuff!  Silky texture, and very soothing. Really cleans out my pores. My skin feels refreshed and not dried out after I remove it, unlike a lot of other masks. Has a very earthy odor, but it&#x27;s not bad.  Looking forward to also trying their other mask as well as the rest of their products. Also loving the Tea Tree shampoo and Silk conditioner!</li>
    <li> I really like this mask, its refreshing and no sticky smell coming from it. it works as described and the after smoothness is worth it, might buy another one soon for a gift. :D</li>
    <li> im 44 and a grandma.i don&#x27;t mind getting older I just don&#x27;t want to look my age.i can truly say I love this product!! I used other masks but this one truly makes my skin look and feel so much better than any other masks I have used!!I love the way my skin looks and how this product smells! When im done with my container im defiantly buying more!! You gotta try it cause it does work on wrinkles and tired looking skin! You wont regret it at all!</li>
    <li> A friend from the middle east recommended products from the Dead Sea. Because this is an all natural product it was GREAT for my skin. It left my face feeling soft and relaxed. I used this product once every couple days and saw the results within 2 weeks. If you read up on products from the dead sea, you will see for yourself how great they are for your skin. I would recommend this product for anyone looking for quick results and healthy skin.</li>
    <li> This mask does work well and makes my skin feel good.  However getting past the smell is difficult because it is very strong.</li>
    <li> I really excited to recI&#x27;ve this product,  I&#x27;ve heard amazing things about this company and this product has everything I&#x27;m looking for with amazing reviews.</li>
    <li> Upon first opening the mask, the aroma was very pleasant. It wasn&#x27;t sweet or fruity, but smelled natural and earthy. The texture is smooth, but not too thin. It applies with ease and does not need to be heavily layered. I left it on for about 10-15 minutes. During that time frame it did not become caked on, peel or flake. It washed off easily with a warm, damp washcloth. My skin instantly looked and felt smoother and softer. I&#x27;m not entirely sure if this was long enough as the packaging nor the label indicated how long to use it, however, it seemed to be very effective even in that short period. I&#x27;m confident that with continued use it will deliver on all of the promises to firm and tone my skin as well. I would highly recommend this mask and plan to purchase more soon!</li>
    <li> One of my friends asked me to try hers and I LOVE it.</li>
    <li> I agree with the other people that the scent is a bit unusual - but I didn&#x27;t mind it. Last night I used it for the first time. I kept it on for 10 minutes and then washed it off, and followed this by putting on some moisturizer, which is essential. Today, my skin feels wonderfully soft.  If I hadn&#x27;t gotten a coupon to try this product, I might never have done so. But it&#x27;s great - thanks!!</li>
    <li> I received this in the mail and the first thing i had noticed was the smell of lavender. I&#x27;m a lavender fanatic and this was a plus in my book. I have oily skin and this help me out with that. I used my toner and moisturizer after and my skin was baby soft. Will be looking into more items from this company.</li>
    <li> I used this a few times and think I&amp;#34;m getting the hang of it. The consistency is quite thick so I make sure my fingers and face are wet. When I wash it off, my skin feels soft and supple. I hope this will be a product that will actually make a difference in how my skin looks long term.</li>
    <li> after trying the BEST Sage dandruff shampoo bgy Maple Holistic..decided to give this product a go..i LOVE IT..it takes some getting used to..recommend wetting face before applying  mud..makes your skin feel like new..highly recommend..the purity of the products they make is not seen often</li>
    <li> This mask makes my face feel nice, is easy to wash off and works well with normal skin. I plan to use the Dead Sea Mud Mask a 3-4 monthes so as to achieve the toning benefits.</li>
    <li> I had never tried any sort of mask like this before. It is very thick and has a really odd but nice smell to it. It felt that my skin looked and felt better at first, but after a few uses it began to get very dry. This is probably because I left it on too long, but there were no instructions telling me how long to leave it on my face! I believe it would be an excellent product if instructions were  provided. I will start trying a shorter time fram</li>
    <li> Excellent mask.Cleanses,purifies as well as hydrates my skin.Worth every single penny.A must have in your beauty routine</li>
    <li> Love love love this product. Love everything about it. using it not only improves your skin, but it can be a part of your relaxation ritual. The smell is just amazing. Its not a flowery smell, it&#x27;s a very natural herb type smell.  Wonderful to apply before a relaxing bath where you can just close your eyes and breathe in the goodness as it relaxes you and improve your skin at the same time. Feels good on, no tingling or burning sensation. Definitely improves your pore size and had a tightening, uplifting effect.</li>
    <li> I have started using this for a week now and I have already seen results. So far so good. I have oily/combination acne prone skin and it has helped tighten my pores and improve the look of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived really fast and you get a full container of product, there was no settling during transport. This will definitely last me a while.</li>
    <li> This mask works with my skin beautifully. It&#x27;s very similar to glam glow mud mask. My skin is very sensitive but this mask did not irritate my skin at all! The only thing is that you need to be very careful not to leave the mask for too long (3-5 mins is more than enough) or you&#x27;ll end up with itchy skin.</li>
    <li> The Dead Sea Mud Mask for Women, Men and Teens is something I have been looking to try.  After reading all the wonderful reviews, I definitely want to try it!</li>
    <li> I love the Green Mrytle Oil because, as a licenced Cosmo, I know it great for skin conditions (acnea, blemishes, bruises, oily skin, psoriasis). I have an oily Tzone and mild blemish flare ups, and it helped calm that in 3 days.</li>
    <li> I really like the quality of this mask, I feel as if the ingredients are dead on for what this product provides for your face. The only thing I was a bit confused about was the actual directions that needed to state how long and duration time, thats why i give 4 stars but other than that I definitely love this product, a little bit does go a long way as it is very thick.  Again awesome quality!!</li>
    <li> Love the results of this product! My skin felt softer and smoother after the first use! A friend of mine from another state came to visit and had this mud mask in her beauty kit. I had never heard of it before, but I was hooked after the first intitial results! I&#x27;ve been using for several months now, and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with the results! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Got this as a gift. Worked ok on my oily skin but really hasnt done much for my acne. Probably because i have more blackheads than pimples. Doesnt seem to get down deep enough in my pores.</li>
    <li> I STOLED THIS MINERAL MASK FROM MY WIFE TO USE FOR MY OILY FACE CAUSED BY STRESS . I T WORKED GREAT AFTER 10 MINUTES OF USE I REMOVED IT AND MY FACE FELT SMOOTH AND CLEAR. WILL BUY MY OWN SOON .</li>
    <li> this is wonderful and very reasonably priced!</li>
    <li> I tried this product for the first time  and I thought it was great. Smoother skin and and  tighter skin pores. I tried it again just to be sure that I would get the same results or even better results and that was exactly what i got. I love the fact that the mud isn&#x27;t too thick and you can easily spread it around your face without using up so much of it. The fragrance of the mud is kind of  minty and reminds you of being in a spa only this time, it is a home spa. I noticed that it dries up quickly after application. I left it on for 18 minutes the first time and for 12 minutes the second time and I still had great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing though, after washing it off, be sure to have your moisturizer handy as your face can appear very dry. All in all, it&#x27;s a great product and I would not hesitate to recommend it.</li>
    <li> Alright... so enough with the whole &amp;#34;I never write reviews&amp;#34; non-sense. We all know that if you hate something you&#x27;ll write about it and if you love it you&#x27;ll write about it, we all do it. I personally love this. Now granted I just recieved it today, but the results were a little too surprising. I have suffered from blackheads, specifically on my nose for over 10 years. I&#x27;ve been on every medicine and tried every over-the-counter products. Things have calmed down now that I&#x27;m in my mid 20&#x27;s but I still get the occasional breakouts. My nose though, just never could find a product to really get deep down to remove those plugs. I bought a clarisonic deep pore brush, hoping that would do the trick... nope. So I typed in oily skin, black heads in amazon and this popped up. The reviews are amazing and I couldn&#x27;t resist. I put it on  my face for about 8 minutes, used the clarisonic to remove the clay and most of my blackheads are removed and the pores are open. Woah! Never has this happened, unless I&#x27;ve gone to burke williams. If you suffer from blackheads and you have oily skin, try this. It&#x27;s cheaper than other products, it&#x27;s natural, it smells good, clary sage is really good for dry skin and the mud/clay is thick, creamy, dense and has a exfoliant texture to it. I was impressed, here is my review. I hope at least one person in my shoes reads this and gives it a try. If tomorrow I change my mind, I&#x27;ll be back to re-write this review, but as of now... amazing job.</li>
    <li> I really wanted this to work for me. The mask is very thick and you can feel the grain in it for exfoliation. The smell is wonderful as well. But my skin is sensitive cuz I have eczema on my face. I have to be careful what I put on my face or it makes my face red and patchy. As soon as I put it on the tingly sensation turned into burning. I could only leave it on for a few minutes but then I had to rinse it off. My face felt nice after I washed it. But needed to put moisturizer on my face. If it didn&#x27;t burn so much it would be nice. I would suggest it to anyone who has sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> A friend recommended this mask to me.  I love it.  The smell is kinda different..in a good way.  I have mostly normal skin but have some dry areas around my chin and usually masks or scrubs make it worse.  This stuff made my skin so soft!  Can&#x27;t wait to try some of their other products!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Dead Sea Mud Mask as directed, and I love it! It makes my face tingle, and I feel and look so much better afterwards.</li>
    <li> I never use masks because I just don&#x27;t like them. This mask doesn&#x27;t do anything I dislike about other masks, however. I have used it 3 times and normally I use a mask maybe once every few months. This mask goes on really thin. It is not gritty, it is very, very smooth. It dries so quick, which is really nice. It goes on in such a thin, even layer. It smells like lavender, which is very soothing. It also comes off so very easily. I like how it leaves my face feeling very clean and tightened, but never dry. Again, for someone who hates using most masks, this mask surprised me and I have actually found one I like. I know they are beneficial to your skin, and if I do buy one, this one is it!</li>
    <li> Best mask I&#x27;ve ever used! I ended up switching to this after trying another acne mask. After noticing that the main ingredient was Dead Sea mud, I figured I might as well switch to organic dead sea mud. I could see the impurities that had been pulled out of my face by the mask as it dried. It also left my skin feeling very smoth. I recommend following up with a moisturizer because it does dry your skin out a little.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great purifying mask . I love the freshness after its removed. It tingles a little especially if you have dry acneic skin but a moisturizer would help. I ve only used it a few times so far and I&#x27;m hoping it helps with the blackheads !</li>
    <li> I ordered the dead sea mud mask to try on my very sensitive and dry yet acne prone skin. I wanted something natural and this treatment had everythig i was looking for and then some. I got it in about two days, the 9oz jar i ordered looks like it will last a few months because you only need to use very little product. The first time i used it my skin was really broken out, after i rinsed the mask off i saw an immediate difference in my skin, it felt CLEAN but not raw pr irritated or dry and the pimples i had were already looking better. I dabbed a second coat of product only onto my trouble spots and let that sit. The second coat tingled a bit, i was worried maybe id overdone it but when i rinsed i was really amazed! The blemishes werent &amp;#34;gone&amp;#34; per say, but they were much smaller and looked as if they were drying up. Since then ive used the mud treatment on my shoulders and chest and also as a spot treatment and ive recommended the product to EVERYONE! its not a cure-all, but it will make your skin feel amazing and greatly reduce acne. One word of advice, since its a mud mask, you do have to make sure you rinse thoroughly. Over-all, im extremely pleased with my purchase</li>
    <li> I have very oily skin. No matter what I do or what I put on my face always looks oily, but then I tried this product and WOW! It took away the shine and made my pores a lot smaller! I love this!!</li>
    <li> good stuff .As I expected</li>
    <li> This does exactly what it promised.. I can&#x27;t speak personally to this but my niece is extremely excited and has been texting me incessantly.. She want a 1 year supply (It controlled her oily skin, large pores and acne)</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing! My skin feels so soft and looks radiant after only using it 1 time? I love the sage smell and as the mud dries you can feel it tightening up your skin!</li>
    <li> This is a mud mask that smells great!  Unfortunately it leaked a little bit in the package but nothing too bad.  The mask dries fast...in less than 10 minutes and it is easy to wash off.  My face feels great and incredibly clean after.  Seems like a spa quality mask.</li>
    <li> I tried this mask a few weeks ago from a friend who recommended it and who know I&#x27;m slowly trying to make my transition from chemically ridden skin care and beauty products to more natural and even DYI ones. I loved its subtle smell. I can usually tell if a product is full of unnatural ingredients based on the smell. When I first put it on my skin was a bit red and oily (I had been at work all day). After I was washed it off my face felt warm and super moisturized; sort of the same feeling you get when leaving a steam room and pat drying your face. It felt alive, soft, but not oily. There was definitely a difference in the nose area. I strongly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I believe that this product has helped to clear up the acne on my face. Within two weeks, I have seen less pimples and smaller pores. Also, this mud mask has helped to take away the excess oil from my face. I usually use this mud mask once or twice a week. I enjoy using it in the evening so that when I wake up my face is smooth and feels clean. I would definitely purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> I bought this as my new skin regime for my upcoming wedding.  My skin is normal with a little bit of acne on my forehead.  However, once I started using this twice a week, I definitely saw a change! My skim seems smoother, more even and the cluster of pimples on my forehead has cleared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is thick and taking it off is a little bit of a challenge.  Dark water gets everywhere so I would highly suggest not wearing white while taking off the mask.  Also, use a towel that you do not care about.</li>
    <li> This can be messy &amp; hard to remove from pores.  I put it on my face &amp; neck &amp; leave it while I&#x27;m washing my hair.  I then rinse it off &amp; use my Clarisonic to make sure all of it gets removed.  It&#x27;s a little gritty &amp; it should be since it&#x27;s mud.  It also stains so be careful.  I have stain remover I will use on my wash cloth later.  It didn&#x27;t stain the tub.  Just be careful around your mat &amp; shower curtain.  Also, I think you will like the aromatherapy; it was relaxing.  I will use old wash cloths from now on.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Helps with my oily skin and acne, every time I use it my skin feels refreshed!</li>
    <li> this mud mask is ok but I have used better. the smell is a little odd but it makes your skin feel great.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. My skin feels so smooth and soft after using it. You do not have to use very much of it to get that effect. I will be ordering another when I am out of this one. The shipping was fast and efficient and the product is fantastic!</li>
    <li> This stuff is beyond amazing!!!! I hate using masks being a male but feel that I can get over my issues due to the fact tgat it helps my skin soooo much!! Very worthwhile.</li>
    <li> I love the product it smells rich and fresh and it really works.</li>
    <li> Great product. I liked and I like how it works. It cleared my pores and made my face shiny. It works well.</li>
    <li> My friend has recommended me to try out this dead sea mask and I used this product twice in the last 3 days.  The smell is pretty good.  I noticed difference with my skin as now it feels soft and looks more evenly toned - it is effective in replenishing and balancing moisture, and the dead sea nutrients has enabled the skin to look more healthy.  Great product and highly recommended!</li>
    <li> One use for at least an hour and my pores become invisible.  Smells nice and sage-y and makes me feel refreshed.  Best mask I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Wow! This mask is awesome! It goes on smooth, does not take much product to cover the entire face, and feels fabulous. But to get to the benefits, my face has never felt cleaner! Go figure that I am putting mud on my face and getting clean! My adult acne started clearing after the first use and my skin was visibly tighter. After the second use, I noticed that my skin felt smooth and soft and was visibly a little tighter and it was not oily or greasy any more. My acne is now gone and my face feels great! Thanks for a great product!</li>
    <li> This is the best mask I&#x27;ve ever tried! It glides on the skin thinly &amp; smoothly, not thick or goopy like some masks. It leaves your skin feeling refreshed and healthy when rinsed off, not dry or striped like products I&#x27;ve used in the past. It smells wonderful and you can feel the quality of the ingredients as soon as you apply. After a long day at work or out in the garden this is the only product I reach for. I have even started using it as a whole body mask when I feel my skin needs it.  It has helped clear up occasional acne I still experience as an adult, as well as eczema &amp; psoriasis both my daughter &amp; husband have. All of us are amazed at the results &amp; this has now become a staple in our home.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product &amp; have been raving to everyone who will listen since I&#x27;ve tried it. The quality of the product &amp; the ingredients speak for themselves &amp; they have won me over, customer for life!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this mask! It was unlike any other mask I have ever used! The mask is very thick and smells really good when you apply it and until it dries. It&#x27;s a natural smell, letting you know that you are not putting a bunch of poisonous chemicals on your skin, but a natural product. I kept it on until it dried on my face. Right after, I rinsed it off, my face felt very different. I could tell a difference in my pores and just the overall appearance of my skin. This is by far the best mask I have ever used to purify my skin!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really have acne, so I ordered it for the anti-aging and purifying benefits. It didn&#x27;t come with instructions, but from trial and error, I would recommend wetting your face a little before applying. Also, leave it on anywhere from 10 to 15 minutes. My skin is a little sensitive, so I leave it on ten minutes. My skin felt really soft after I used it- I could tell a big difference it the look &amp; feel of my skin. You can tell it really does pull out impureties. The reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is because I couldn&#x27;t really tell a difference in the tightness &amp; elacticity of my skin.</li>
    <li> I received my Dead Sea mud mask today and immediately wanted to give it a try.  My daughter looked at me like I was a creature from the bottom of the lagoon but still climbed up and sat next to me. She told me my face smelled pretty. It was the aroma from the mask. After a few minutes with it on I began to relax even more than I had prepared myself to. The mask rinses off easily and my skin feels refreshed. My pores look smaller and my skin feels tighter. I also have sensitive skin and the mask didn&#x27;t bothers face at all! Good thing it&#x27;s nap time in our house because after that mask I am ready for one, the scent is so soothing along with feeling incredibly pampered after using the mask itself. A must have in your beauty supplies.</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved this mask. I have tried so many different once in the past and tho sone was just the best. It didn&#x27;t get too hard and crispy that it started falling off everywhere. It left my skin radiant and smooth.</li>
    <li> Used this once and already seeing the improvement.  I have trouble with acne so I am happy I found some thing that helps. Found instructions on how to use it on their actual website.. here they are :&lt;br /&gt;Directions&lt;br /&gt;HOW TO USE: Cleanse skin, apply a thin layer to damp face, Massage on with a gentle touch using circular motions. Avoid prolonged massaging in any one area, leave on for 5-10-15-20 minutes - Rinse thoroughly.</li>
    <li> Love this product. It cleared up all my acne so quickly! Absolutely recommend it to anyone looking to clear up their skin!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really satisfied from this product, since the first time that i used it. My face its fresh and soft and it stay like that for a long time. i really recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I really liked this product.  I am a long time user of many different beauty products.  I have recently been using Meaningful Beauty and as far as masks go I find this product to be far superior to any of Meaningful Beauty&#x27;s masks.  It goes on easy and covers easily with a small amount of product.  It dries quickly and  you can feel it pulling toxins out of your skin.  I also like the grittiness of it as I took it off I scrubbed my face and also used it as an exfoliant.  My skin felt clean and tight and I finished off with moisturizer.  I hope to find a moisturizer from Maple Holistics so that I can pair it perfectly with this wonderful mask. Thanks so much! A+</li>
    <li> Great product.  I hear about this company from a friend and figured I would give this product a try.  I really like it although I didn&#x27;t care for the scent, little too strong for me but other then that this product was great.  Very easy to use and I have had great results.  Going to try more products from this company for sure!</li>
    <li> Face feels soft after using,  the only problem I have is it gets stuck in my pores. I just had to splash water on my face a few extra times to get it out. Overall this is a good product</li>
    <li> This is one of the BEST masks for the skin.  It is packed FULL of nutrients and doesn&#x27;t contain any chemicals.  My skin was baby soft when I removed the mask. It smells heavenly and totally relaxes you. I LOVE IT!  [...]</li>
    <li> I breakout occasionally and for only being 24 i have wrinkles around my eyes that came about after I deployed to a combat zone in Afghan. I&#x27;ve only been using this for a week or so but I can already notice a difference in the way my skin feels and I&#x27;m hoping within time my wrinkles with lessen in appearance. It has helped with my minor breakouts though. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Absolutely wonderful! So refreshing to your skin, while so calming to your senses! The combination of Lavender, chamomile and sage really relaxes you while you wear it, and it draws all the toxins out of your skin, making you feel fresh and silky smooth afterwards! Wonderful addition to any beauty routine. And men, don&#x27;t laugh....it works great for you, too! My husband loved it!</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic...The dead sea musk is one product I will highly recommend. The feeling of the first use is just amazing. I was little apprehensive trying a new product on my face but it was worth it.  It made my skin so fresh and yes it is indeed a muscle relaxer to my skin.</li>
    <li> Great product. Mud from the Dead Sea is great for your skin. My wife swears by the stuff. We are very happy with it</li>
    <li> This is something for people who have acne, spots or wrinkles. I&#x27;d say if you&#x27;re just using it to relax, it is relaxing but there are cheaper alternatives. This is a quality one that costs mroe because it actually helps treat the face, it&#x27;s not just plain mud. Very effective+++</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife, it was a surprise gift and I have to say it seems this is one of my better choices. She is absolutely delighted with it. It looks good, smells good (I did wonder what it would smell like!) and she loves the cleansing effect. I can&#x27;t say she LOOKS all that good with it plastered on :-)  Anyway, it really does seem to be a premium product that performs very well.</li>
    <li> People wouldn&#x27;t slather MUD all over their face if there were no results to come out of it. It&#x27;s a famous facial technique which is less common because it&#x27;s upperclass when it comes to pricing.&lt;br /&gt;I love opening the jar and dabbing my finger in, spreading it throughout my face, and getting into the tub or on the couch to watch TV before bed. I use this almost every single night. Not only does it not irritate my skin, but it feels great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put it on, and it feels moist. After about two minutes, I can feel it thickening on my cheeks and face - as if it was actually molding to my face. While wearing it, the mud mask feels cool and refreshing. It has a pleasant smell, it doesn&#x27;t make me feel like I&#x27;m wearing odorous mud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it comes time to clean it off, it comes clean. It doesn&#x27;t chunk up on my face or dry out and have to be vigorously scrubbed. This is an easy to apply and remove product, this is a recommended item on my list. It doesn&#x27;t overpopulate ingredients and keeps it simple - mud and the additive is the formula good for my facial skin. I like the effects this has on me and my face is fresh and pure, and I&#x27;m going to keep it that way by continuing to use this. It&#x27;s long lasting, you end up using much less per session then I thought because of it&#x27;s creamy texture. This and the eye cream are my favorite products from this company. I&#x27;m about to order my second jar, I don&#x27;t ever want to run out of this!</li>
    <li> It is smooth like pudding and goes on very easily. No clumps. I&#x27;ve been making my own masks for a long time because I didn&#x27;t like the ingredients in other masks, but mine are always lumpy. This one is nice and natural. I add my own essential oils for aromatherapy and it is PERFECT. I use it a couple times a week.</li>
    <li> This has helped clean my pores and has made my skin soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> I agree with the previous reviewer - it&#x27;s OK, barely. The product came with no instructions, no details, no &amp;#34;made in ___&amp;#34;, no ingredient source. No, nothing. Nope. Nada.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moreover, the contents had separated from the sides of the container, and the product shrinkage was considerable. I applied it to the back of my hand, and it was dry in about 30 seconds and frankly it hurt. This is an old product, or one that is not well-packaged. If water can evaporate out and shrink the volume, imagine what can get in. In the trash it goes. I will never apply this on my face or any other body part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, BTW. This is not the real deal - if you want a dead sea mask, buy the good stuff.</li>
    <li> This feels amazing and a little tingly. My skin loves it! Nice! Fast shipping too.</li>
    <li> My face was totally red :(</li>
    <li> I need this product to do two things for me: treat my acne and my oily skin. It did none of that. I was so disappointed because I had high hopes for this product due to the user reviews. I guess I&#x27;m off to the next \\&quot;better\\&quot; thing.</li>
    <li> It leaves my skin feel tight and supple.  Fantastic product!  Will buy for myself, friends and family as a treat.</li>
    <li> Overall it is a great mask for black head removal/ face peel. I would not use it more often than once a week, because it is drying my skin, but i will add it to my weekly deep cleaning routing&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Deeply cleanses pores, removed blackheads after the first use. I imagine it would be a great find for someone with acne problem&lt;br /&gt;- Nice not too strong smell&lt;br /&gt;-  Natural components&lt;br /&gt;- Little goes long way, you&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;- Dries the skin. A good moisturizer after is a must!&lt;br /&gt;- Right after I wash it away, my skin was a bit reddish. Probably because all the dirt got sucked out. After a good night sleep my skin returned to normal, but i need to keep in mind not to apply it just before going out :)&lt;br /&gt;- I don&#x27;t think it does anything for wrinkles really&lt;br /&gt;- Leaves the skin a bit read</li>
    <li> Love love love this mask! My skin feels so clean, smooth, energized and radiant after I use this. I wear it for 30mins then gently wash it off, exfoliate and pat dry. I feel like I have seen my skin become smoother and more even than before, but I also take medicine for my skin so it&#x27;s not only the mask but if definitely has helped!</li>
    <li> When I first got this product I washed my face. The product smells great and very relaxing too. Then when the 10 minutes was up I rinsed it off. It made my face so very soft and smooth. Hope to buy it again in the near future. Thanks for making such a great product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this Dead Sea mask twice so far, and I have to say, I&#x27;m kinda hooked on it! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not have a bad odor, it goes on smooth, dries completely in about 15 minutes, and washes off very easily. My skin was very smooth afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to anyone who loves to do masks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Rating: A</li>
    <li> I bought this last month.That time i think it as usual mud based products. But after the first time of use. I feel this is the best product .</li>
    <li> I loved it! It tingled a little at first but it went away very quickly. I would use it about once or twice a week (depending on if my skin was breaking out or not). I noticed an immediate difference afterwards!! Not only does it help clear up my skin but it tightened my skin and it is so much softer, fresher, and clearer now! I really liked the smell of it, although it did not smell anything like lavender.</li>
    <li> This mask is so relaxing. It smells amazing and tingles just the right amount. It definitely leaves my skin super soft, has helped shrink pimples and calm my skin. As someone who doesn&#x27;t mind an intense product, I can see how some people might find the tingling sensation too intense. The ingredients are fabulous and I&#x27;m thrilled it hasn&#x27;t aggravated my skin, which tends to be on the dry, sensitive side.</li>
    <li> Smells like our natural hot springs here in Alaska &amp; I actually find the smell healing I like the way my skin feels after and use it at least once a week sometimes twice depending on how oily my skin decides to be.</li>
    <li> I use it a couple of times per week, it is a terrific cleanser (makes my skin look so much healthier and feels great) and you don&#x27;t have to mix it up with water or other stuff for it to work.</li>
    <li> I LOVE the way my face feels after using Maple Holistics Dead Sea Mud Mask! I leave it on for 10 minutes, and when I first used the smell bothered me, but now the smell is therapeutic. This mud mask does exfoliate your skin, as stated, and after the exfoliating, your skin feels amazing! When I also first used the Dead Sea Mud Mask, my face started to burn a tiny little bit, but soon went away. (Burn wasn&#x27;t close to feeling the need to wash off.)  As for the way my face looks. My pores look smaller and my skin has a beautiful glow. I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a facial mask that literally does it all but put itself on for you. Thank you Maple Holistics, this is a WINNER in my \\&quot;Product Staples\\&quot; list.</li>
    <li> you can feel it working</li>
    <li> It says for Men and Women, but it smells a little bit more for women, probably because of the lavender and clary sage. Either way, this is an incredible mud mask and I&#x27;d recommend it to the female community</li>
    <li> I love this mask! It didn&#x27;t burn or sting. It didn&#x27;t take a lot, so a little goes a long way. For being mud, it was fairly easy to get it all off. After my skin felt super soft and breakouts were minimal.</li>
    <li> This is AWESOME!! First time I used this, it tingled my face, not a lot, but enough to let you know &amp;#34;Hey, I&#x27;m here&amp;#34;.  I could feel something going on with my face. I left it on for 15 minutes. (This does get REALLY tight) I washed it off and it was surprisingly super easy to wash off, better than any OTC stuff.  about an hour or two later, my face started itching, not drastically, or uncomfortably. And it wasn&#x27;t like I was allergic to it. I looked in the mirror and saw little whiteheads and whatnot coming up to the service of my skin. I&#x27;m a picker, so I popped them with surprising ease. I now use once a week and my skin is REMARKABLY clearer!! I never had acne as a teen, but after having my children, I get acne, including the deep cystic along my jawline. No More!!&lt;br /&gt;I had my teenage son use this and he cleared up quite a bit. Although he has only used this twice because &amp;#34;he&#x27;s a boy&amp;#34; and has sisters that tease him if they know he has a &amp;#34;mask&amp;#34; on. :-0</li>
    <li> This product really works. My skin feels fresh and it helped my breakouts. I would commend this as a weekly face mask. Not for everyday use. I didn&#x27;t know this at first so I was using this daily.kinda died my face out. But still amazing! Just remember at the most three times a week</li>
    <li> My skin has always been difficult to manage since it is very sensitive, so I was a little leery about trying a new product. My face had been more sensitive lately and as soon as I started brushing on the mud with my fingers, the nutrients started calming my pores. It felt great and wasn&#x27;t too harsh. I put a fairly thick layer on my face and let it dry for about 15 minutes. I washed it off with warm water and my skin felt great the next day as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I consider this a skin-therapy product and have used it a few more times, with great results! This is quickly becoming a product that will have a place on my shelf and I really like how natural it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only request I have is directions on how the mud is intended to be used. The website ([...] provides directions, but I don&#x27;t keep a computer in my bathroom, so I was assuming the proper use of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I will definitely keep using this mud mask!</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get this mud mask because I&#x27;ve seen SO many positive reviews about it and some even sounded like they had the same problems I have. I have very sensitive, combination and acne prone skin and I&#x27;ve tried so many different products but nothing ever seems to help so I thought I&#x27;d try this mud mask out. It felt good when I applied it but the next morning I woke up to about 5 breakouts but I didn&#x27;t want to give up so I tried it again and the same thing happened. It just made my face even worse than it already was. :( I was so disappointed in this product.</li>
    <li> I use this every couple of weeks to just get the crude out of my pours, yeah I&#x27;m a guy but you know what, I don&#x27;t want my face to look like the Marlboro Man shoe leather, so yeah I use a mud mask and take care of myself.  It actually has a very calming and relaxing smell to it.  There are no instructions on how long.  I usually leave it on for 5-10 mins tops and rinse it off in the shower, don&#x27;t try to do it over the sink, you&#x27;ll make a huge mess and still not get it all off, a warm to hot shower and rinse it off, that was up your face afterwards, definitely opens up your pores.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter - she has oily skin and has had problems with skin products drying out her skin, but used this faithfully every night for a week with a light moisturizer following -- sometimes leaving it on 20 minutes, and had no problems with dryness at all.  She says her face feels smoother - now only uses it once a week.</li>
    <li> my 13 year old son and I both use this mask and it has had an amazing overall effect on my skin, but it has done wonders for my son. he had been having some pretty severe breakouts, all along his hairline and forehead, and nothing seemed to really work to get rid of it all. he&#x27;s been using this mask every other day or two, for the past month and a half or so; and his skin looks great, especially his problem areas. his acne is pretty much cleared up altogether. highly recommend for anyone, it exfoliates and clean pores deep down, but i have found that it is perfect for helping to eliminate acne in some of my sons problem areas. not to mention what a great buy for less than $15, and it doesn&#x27;t take very much. we&#x27;ve both been using the same jar for the past several weeks and we&#x27;ve only used about half the jar. I will definitely purchase again. hope this was helpful.</li>
    <li> My family and I were looking for something fun to do on a relaxing evening.  We like face masks, but have trouble finding one that our skin will tolerate.  We thought we would give this a try and all three of us loved it (husband, wife, daughter, even the little guy thought it was fun).  I have mixed skin, my daughter has typical teenager skin, and my husband has normal skin.  Nobody had outbreaks or flare ups.  My daughter said it made her skin really soft.  I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference, but nevertheless it was fun and we all will do it again.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. Works as described. Leaves skin feeling clean and refreshed. This mud has a surprisingly pleasant odor.  I will be purchasing additional containers of this product!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent skin product. This mud mask is wonderful! I love the earthy smell that it has and how smooth my face feels after putting it on. When I put on this mud mask I can feel it working right away. This product is amazing and I plan on making Dead Sea Mud Mask a part of my daily skin care routine.</li>
    <li> Love this mud. I use it daily and see a difference. The seller has also reached out to me personally which was a nice touch.</li>
    <li> Has a strong earthy smell which I enjoyed. Immediately after I applied it, I felt a cool refreshing feeling on my skin.  I let it dry for about 10 minutes before rinsing it off with warm water.  My skin felt super smooth and soft.  Will be using again in the future.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. My skin feels so smooth and soft after using it. You do not have to use very much of it to get that effect. I will be ordering another when I am out of this one. The shipping was fast and efficient and the product is fantastic!</li>
    <li> No instructions came with this mask. I am not sure how long to leave it on and really can&#x27;t see that it does much. It also smells bad. I will keep using it and may update this if I see some benefit later. UPDATE: I had to throw this stuff out. It started to literally stink!</li>
    <li> I really loved it,last week I used it every day for 15 min(until get dry)I feel my skin is breathing and I had some black head that gone too.definitely recommend this Product.</li>
    <li> Today was the first day i tried it, my face feels refreshed..cannot rate any further about the product.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! It made my skin feel really soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> Wow! This stuff is really good. Love the smell and makes my skin look great.</li>
    <li> This product is truly amazing!!! It made my skin so radiant and clear already from the first use! Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I recieved this as a gift and I am so glad that I did.  It is very gentle, but helps to exfoliate my skin and create a healthy glow.  It is hard to find all natural products that are effective. Thank you Maple Holistics!</li>
    <li> I received this product free from Maple Holistics for providing a product review for the Silk 18 Hair Conditioner I ordered - I am grateful for the free product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This face mud smells absolutely lovely! Deep and earthy, and the smell is long lasting, which I enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is excellent quality. It goes on thick and smooth and is nice to work with. It is exfoliating, so I found applying rather gently is needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would rate it a 5, except my skin feels dry after I use it. I have a &#x27;normal&#x27; skin type, perhaps someone with oily skin wouldn&#x27;t be left with dry skin afterwards. And in truth, this is the first face mud I have used, so I have nothing to compare it with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little jojoba oil, and my skin is left feeling quite nice and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a very nice product. I hope you enjoy!</li>
    <li> love it...probably will never stop using it!!!</li>
    <li> Wow! Used this first time tonight and what a relaxing, nurturing face vacation!</li>
    <li> I have been using this Dead Sea Mud Mask every week since I received it and I love it. My skin feels so soft and smooth and finally cleared up. I don&#x27;t like Dead see mud masks because the smell is usually too strong and unpleasant, but not this one, the smell is nice. The jar is huge and I am not even half way through. It will last you a while for sure, great investment.</li>
    <li> I am sad to give this such a poor rating, because it is so close to being a wonderful product. The biggest problem I have with it is that is contains lavender, which is a skin irritant and can be cytotoxic. This means I would not recommend putting it on your skin at all, especially if you plan on going outside and exposing your skin to sunlight. The other thing I dislike about the product is its smell. Some people find it very relaxing and therapeutic, but I find it too pungent and it gives me a headache. There are many good ingredients in this mask, and if it didn&#x27;t contain lavender I would be giving it at least 3 or 4 stars, but keeping peoples&#x27; health in mind I have to say it isn&#x27;t a good idea to purchase this product. Look at Maple Holistic&#x27;s other products, though!</li>
    <li> This dead sea mask has the perfect ingredients. Nothing toxic or artificial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a little bit itchy when you are applying it. It dries fast. Leaves my skin like new, super clean. After use, I use a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m tired of using all of these moisturizing, exfoliating, and other ploys acne creams rich in sacrylic acid which doesn&#x27;t even penetrate through my skin. I need something that actually is able to penetrate my pores and help my terribly teenage-esque acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this ONCE, I knew this was for me. Feels good, and I can feel it working - literally, I&#x27;m not kidding.&lt;br /&gt;This is more expensive than regular cream, so that is probably the reason it is less popular but if you want something that works and will last a LONG time (this has enough for what, 6+ months?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been a few weeks since I bought it from their website and I no longer look a tween on a prom date. Thanks maple!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this mask! I have only used it a few times, and I have already seen great results. It has noticeably helped with my acne. It is, however, quite drying, so I like to add a few drops of argon oil to my moisturizer after I use the mask. Overall, I highly recommend this mask as it is natural, cruelty free, and extremely effective!</li>
    <li> I got this for my teenage son, but I tried out once. I felt a bit tingling sensation on contact, but since it was very minor. However, I did not leave it&lt;br /&gt;on my face any longer than 30 seconds.  Still, I was surprised to feel and see the difference. I am sure I did not use it properly to get the best result, but what I got was enough to convince me that the product is worth paying for. It was not any different from any other products of the same kind at the market. I still have not really tried like the way It should be, but I keep promising myself to do so sometime soon. I recommend to at least try it to see if it may bring the result you want.</li>
    <li> Omg I love this mask, it&#x27;s amazing! It makes you feel like your at the spa, and it&#x27;s really effective. When I was done my face didn&#x27;t feel oil or dirty any more, I felt refreshed.</li>
    <li> i love it as it is really natural and make skin more healthy</li>
    <li> Love it my daughter noticed it after one facial.</li>
    <li> have used this mask for 4 days, and my face and neck feel so soft and is starting to look firmer. The best thing of all is that I have tried so many products for under eye trunks, I dont have bags, I have trunks. Mostly this is due to a disorder I have but I still do not like it. Well I got up the morning and they are smaller for the first time in years. All that money I wasted on costly products that did nothing at all. For me, even a little change makes me feel great. I will update in a couple of weeks to let you know how it is going and if the eyes trunks make it to bags</li>
    <li> Best dead sea mud available. Will let you know that is burns the first few times you use. This is a normal process as it is cleaning out your pores. WIll leave skin red a bit. I&#x27;ve had experience with dead sea mud and this is completely normal. All part of the process.&lt;br /&gt;Love the product. WIll be getting again.</li>
    <li> Not sure if it really helps....but my skin doesn&#x27;t feel tight or dry after using it.....it does smell very muggy....not recommended if u can&#x27;t stand the mug smell on your face....</li>
    <li> After trying this product for the first time I found it to be a very good product.  I have used facial masks in the past that help dry skin.  It was very easy to apply and remove.  I did need a moisturizer afterwards, but I usually use put moisturizer on after a mask and especially in the winter.</li>
    <li> I have been using dead sea mud for 20 years or more.I have to say they must have dug deep for this treasure of a product for I have never seen such overnight results with any other brand tried.Well by the time I used this product for the 3rd time I was convinced it made my skin feel like a childs,firmed,removed blackheads,and left my skin with a lasting glow! It really smells naturally delicious a kind of a Lavender,sage,mint aroma.I recieved as a gift and I now will never purchase any other brand.Great price too because a little goes a long way and does not leave a dirty muddy ring on porcelain,rinces easily &amp; completly along with all the grime and blackheads! Love this product,Sincerly thrilled with results ,Rachel Bata</li>
    <li> I love how this makes my face feel. I have extremely sensitive skin that can dry very easily. I have pustular rosacea so I get a lot of redness, breakage, and dry patches on my face. I have to be so careful with what I use on my face and I was having a rough rosasea break out. I used this once and it cleared up my face. The price is very reasonable, as well. I will definitely be re-ordering.</li>
    <li> I got a free sample of this stuff because I have very dry yet acne prone skin and always had a hard time finding something that could help with both skin concerns. First of all, the sample was a really nice size to begin with, and this product is WONDERFUL. it really makes the skin nice and soft and my T-zone, which is where my dryness is the worst, softened up a large amount. It doesn&#x27;t flake when I wear makeup anymore, and it feels so much softer and more alive than ever. My acne? Cleared up a lot! My face hasn&#x27;t looked this nice in a while and I feel so much more comfortable in my own skin (: I heard a lot about the dead sea stuff but never bought into it, thinking it was just all talk like most skin products. But I am so happy I gave it a try because it is amazing. Definitley check into it if you have dry skin or acne. I know it for sure works for that (((:</li>
    <li> works great. one of the better masks. leave your skin feeling new. i like the earthy smell but it does take some getting used to</li>
    <li> A very good natural product. I was surprised at how easy it is to put on.&lt;br /&gt;The mud was easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;I left it on 20 min. it feels like a mild stinging but not bad.&lt;br /&gt;The mud rinses off very easily.&lt;br /&gt;Afterwards the  facial skin looks healthy.&lt;br /&gt;it also makes the skin tone even.&lt;br /&gt;a great product for sure.</li>
    <li> I got this product recently and have had great results with it. I have oily, acne-prone skin and have a hard time finding good quality products that don&#x27;t make my skin worse. This is a nice thick mud mask that you can feel tightening your skin. After using it, my skin felt soft and my pores were visibly smaller. I would definitely buy this product again.</li>
    <li> i just used this stuff and it made my skin feel amazing i would definitly by this agian</li>
    <li> I ordered a sample of this directly from the maple holistics website. It&#x27;s fabulous stuff. I have very sensitive, combination skin, with a tendency to break out very easily. The mud mask soothed my inflamed skin and seems to be helping with breakouts. It also smells absolutely lovely. Very lavendery</li>
    <li> Did nothing for my skin at all and I have used more than a month and don&#x27;t see or feel a bit different.  I was hoping with all the good reviews that it would work.  I will go back to my old brand.</li>
    <li> it  suppose to clear my acne but instead is making it worse</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! I have tried several mud masks in the past few years and this is the only one that has actually worked on my skin. My skin feels softer, and brighter, and my pores have gotten a lot smaller. What I always hated about my skin was how red it got around my nose and after using this product a few times, the redness has gone down and I feel a lot more comfortable wearing no makeup. It is kind of pricey but totally worth it.</li>
    <li> Terrific product!  It not only worked wonderfully to brighten my skin, unclog pores and reduce pore size, it also did wonders on my preteens acne.  I am in love!!!</li>
    <li> I  am approaching my mid thirties and suffer from enlarged pores, uneven skin tone and all that bad stuff. I have large pores especially on my nose region. I felt a tingling sensation when I tried this on and was getting ready to wash it off in case it would burn. But it did not burn. The tingling sensation just stayed a few more mins and I washed it off 10 mins later. Really some instructions would have helped as to how long I hsould keep it on my skin. After taking it off I saw that my skin looked fresh and my pores had minimised( atleast for the time being) but it wonderfully removed my tan. I am south asian and tan easily . ALso my face felt supple. This is a keeper.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for a trial. i have mixed feelings. I do love how the mud goes on nice and smooth and a little goes a long way. It has left my skin a little dry but i do use it several times in a week so i may cut back.My skin appearance looks much better and my blemishes have cleared up. I do use a moisturizer so that helps with the dryness. My recommendation,  if you have dry skin, do not use every other day, maybe 2 or 3 times a week and use a  moisturizer. The only down size is do not use a white or light colored wash cloth as it does stain and it did not come out in the wash.  I am not giving up on this product yet, i will stop using ever other day since i do have dry skin and i will use it before i shower instead of a wash cloth.</li>
    <li> Mud therapy is being used by people to treat diseases since ancient times. It is believed that the earth has healing powers which are refreshing and invigorating for the body.</li>
    <li> This is the third dead sea mud mask product I&#x27;ve tried. The first two claimed to be 100% Pure Dead Sea mud mask, but BEWARE!!!!! That claim was like taking a whole wheat slice of bread, slobbing fattening cheeses on it and claiming 100% Whole Wheat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just like treating myself to \\&quot;spa night\\&quot; every once in a while, and started using this very recently. It&#x27;s just what I wanted. Honest product.</li>
    <li> very strong artificial smell.</li>
    <li> I have very oily skin, and I&#x27;ve been trying various masks to reduce the oil. This one is amazing--one of the best I&#x27;ve ever tried! The consistency is perfect and has great coverage. I&#x27;ve been using it every other night, and my skin is definitely less oily when I wake up in the morning. I&#x27;m so pleased with this, that I&#x27;ve ordered their Ancient Clay mask as well!</li>
    <li> Best mask I have ever used. Helping to clear acne due to menopause. Wish I had this product with teenage acne. It is not any more enjoyable having acne later in life than it was then, so the aromatherapy has been a nice addition.</li>
    <li> Seriously the BEST product I have tried in a very long time! My skin has dramatically changed since using this product. I use it on my whole body and my dry rough legs have never been more smooth and beautiful. I was very skeptical, but I am a very happy camper and will for sure be buying more. :)</li>
    <li> Before I stared using this product my skin was very lose and discolored, after my skin started to feel tighter and turning one color again. Another plus it is all natural!</li>
    <li> I love it!! It has shrunk my big pores, cleared up black heads, and just make my skin overall smoother and just awesome looking!  I love how it smells fabulous.  It tingles but in a good way makes me feel that it&#x27;s working!!  It has also helped my oily skin not be so oily!  I can actually wear makeup now without looking greasy at 11am!!  It dries very fast which I love, so I use it about 3x a week.  This is my new favorite mask!!! It&#x27;s amazing!!</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product that left my face feeling very refreshed and thoroughly cleaned. Took a second to get used to but I&#x27;ve been using it when I take a bath for a while now and honestly my face has never looked and felt better! Well worth the money! Especially b/c it can be used many times with just one bottle! Excellent job Maple Holistic!</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Trully does work. Best bang for my buck. I recommend it to everyone I bought it for my wife as well</li>
    <li> This product is great for wrinkles, that&#x27;s the only real problem that hasn&#x27;t been going away with creams I&#x27;ve been buying. This is thick and creamy so it feels good, and after using it I have been seeing a difference. Five stars for quality and effectiveness</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been living in Israel most of my life, and have been using the mud since I was a teen. Im at the point where I can almost always tell if the mud is from the dead sea or not. This is, and I like this one in particular. When I buy mud masks I get this.</li>
    <li> I got a trial size sample of this Dead Sea Mud Mask from Maple Holistics. This trial size is pretty good. I tried it many times already. The texture of this product is really like dead sea mud which made me feel it will benefit my skin. After using it, I feel my skin is very clean. It took/washed out the dust, whitehead and etc from my skin. The skin is a little bit dry after using, but it&#x27;s acceptable, not too bad. It&#x27;s really good for using before applying the lotion. Good product and I love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy and it was suggested to me by my girlfriend. I can&#x27;t get enough. The bottle lasts a very long time, it feels great, and it keeps my skin looking awesome for a long time after. Will be buying many more bottles.</li>
    <li> I have no problem with this.</li>
    <li> I really liked using this product.  The scent is fresh and invigorating, very pleasing and earthy.  As soon as I applied it to my face, my skin began to tingle from the exfoliation, and I could feel the cleansing and tightening properties of the mud.  I enjoyed wearing the mask, and upon rinsing it off when dry (after 10-15 minutes), my skin felt smooth and soft and clean.  It was a delightful experience, and certainly made the more relaxing with the therapeutic properties of the essential oils!</li>
    <li> I enjoyed using the dead sea mud mask. It didn&#x27;t leave my skin dried out. I felt refreshed after using it. Great product!!</li>
    <li> This mud really cleans out your pores and leaves your face feeling soft and smooth. It smells great and washes off easily. I will definitely purchase again when the jar is empty. If you have big pores and are prone to blackheads I would give it a try.</li>
    <li> This product produces amazing results. After applying you get a warm and tingling feeling. It&#x27;s working. My skin was radiant and glowing. A winner.</li>
    <li> Actually hardens like a mask should! Great results with this product after trying multiple other brands I will stick with this one!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several mud masks before and this Dead Sea Mud Mask gets a definite A+ from me! My teenage son and I both used the mask for a week. After nightly use we both had a marked improvements! He had dramatic experiments in decreasing the oiliness /shine. He had much less breakouts. Best thing overall...  is that I noticed a boost in his confidence! :)&lt;br /&gt; - For me, I noticed an improvement right away with my pores shrinking and some of the fine have minimized greatly, and some even disappeared!&lt;br /&gt;One thing I feel I MUST share.is thIs:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teen son and I LOVED...  was the whole experience!! ~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was absolutely spa like!! :) .Loved the refreshing tingling sensations after applying the mask, and letting it dry!  It really feels like you can actually feel the awsome properties inside actually going to work! We both feel better about our complexion!.We enjoyed our experience with this Dead Sea Face Mud Mask and we plan to continue now!&lt;br /&gt; Not only did it work for us both.... but we (teen son &amp; mom) had an amazing bonding experience each night!!  Of course I recommend this product!!!</li>
    <li> There are too many products out there claiming to be &amp;#34;Dead Sea Mud,&amp;#34; but are really just mud with maybe a drop of real Dead Sea mud mixed in. As someone who has been to the Dead Sea and has used the ACTUAL mud from it, I can vouch for the fact that this stuff is really Dead Sea mud, I like the addition of essential oils... it&#x27;s very aroma-therapeutic and prevents overdrying. I use this mask a few times a week for my oily &amp;#34;problem&amp;#34; skin and I love it!</li>
