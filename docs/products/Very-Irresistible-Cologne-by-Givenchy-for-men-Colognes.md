      <li>Irressistable is a light fragrance that gets many, many compliments from women and men alike.</li>
      <li>This is my primary fragrance and has been for many years.  </li>
      <li>Women and men all told me how much they loved it, and if they could have the jacket and shirt</li>
      <li>Licorice and woodsy, sophisticated and mildly flirty.</li>
      <li>however, it doesnt smell cheap.</li>
      <li>It smells like rotten coffee poured on someone wearing too much cheap cologne.</li>

      <li>Good transaction everything I expected</li>
      <li>I think it does not require much description: Aroma friendly and durable.</li>
      <li>Like a great many men&#x27;s fragrances this one, once applied to my skin turns very sweet, almost unpleasantly so.  </li>
      <li>A fairly generic fragrance, it starts off with a strong scent of baby powder and coco puffs, followed shortly by sweet citrus (like fruit stripe gum).  </li>

      <li>I really like this product if you are looking for something diferent this Toilette Spray is for you.</li>
      <li>This is the real deal.</li>
      <li>Doubt this is the real deal.  </li>
      <li>Thanks for a job</li>
      <li>Although the external package looked fine, the bottle is not shaded like the others he&#x27;s had, there is no label on the bottom of the bottle like on the others, and the smell is more like alcohol with a little scent added.  </li>
      <li>The bottle is the only thing worth anything.</li>
      <li>Previous red and blue labels were nicely done.</li>
      <li>Absolutely not what I expected from them very cheap scent.</li>
      <li>This product caught my nose last summer and is a real keeper for my collection.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It is really good!! My favorite man&#x27;s cologne. I ll recomend it to every one big time. Dnt miss this chance.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband before going on a trip to the Carribean. He wore this to dinner a couple of times and I thought it smelled too \\&quot;heavy\\&quot; for the tropical environment we were in. This fragrance definitely fits a  colder weather, ski vacation, in front of the fireplace setting. Licorice and woodsy, sophisticated and mildly flirty.</li>
    <li> This product caught my nose last summer and is a real keeper for my collection. Irressistable is a light fragrance that gets many, many compliments from women and men alike. Its fragrance lasts throughout the day and is pleaseing to the senses. Its a great fresh smell that is neither musky or fruity, I don&#x27;t feel like a teenager like some of the colognes make me feel. Its an awesome scent that deserves a chance, try it out next time you go to Macy&#x27;s or a fragrance shop, you&#x27;ll see what chocolate, and wood do to your olfactories!</li>
    <li> This cologne is incredible strong.    My sister likes the smell and I&#x27;m not a big fan of it.</li>
    <li> The \\&quot;Very Irresistible\\&quot; cologne is a great fragrance by Givenchy. The ordering process was very easy and it was shipped immediately. I&#x27;m currently located in Iraq and I still received it in less than 7 days.    Thanks for a job well done,    Carl (in Iraq)</li>
    <li> This scent is for the very sophisticated man. The price has hi-jacketed  from the time I bought it.</li>
    <li> I had a really bad experience with this product it is not the one listed in the picture and the cologne is FAKE! do not buy! i have the original and bought this one or my boyfriend who sprayed one arm original and the left arm this one and THIS ONE wore off in an hour. I&#x27;m extremely pissed off i paid alot of money for this product and it IS NOT REAL!&lt;br /&gt;i reached out to the seller and never heard back&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Es muy fresco, tiene notas como de menta y caramelo y un fondo de maderas que lo hace duradero.   Es perdurable.  El frascos es innovador, huele genial, no es excesivamente caro.    Muy recomendable.</li>
    <li> This is my primary fragrance and has been for many years.  I get lots of compliments on it.  It is well balanced; not too sweet nor too woodsy. I like it so much that I have three in reserve.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff. It lives up to its name, and couldn&#x27;t possibly be replaced by anything else I&#x27;ve had.  I put it up there with The Dreamer by Versace and Acqua di Gio by Giorgio Armani.  I sprayed some before going to class one day just to see if I&#x27;d get any reactions from people.  Women and men all told me how much they loved it, and if they could have the jacket and shirt I had on.  A romantic interest even asked me for my boxers!    The website, [...], has the entire Givenchy line.  I look forward to obtaining the rest for my \\&quot;Smell Good\\&quot; collection.</li>
    <li> Absolutely not what I expected from them very cheap scent. Previous red and blue labels were nicely done.</li>
    <li> I bought this without first smelling it based upon a recommendation from someone. The stuff stinks. It smells like rotten coffee poured on someone wearing too much cheap cologne. I threw it away. It is gaggingly bad. I don&#x27;t know how they can call this cologne. The bottle is the only thing worth anything.</li>
    <li> you can tell they had a good idea with what they wanted to pull off. and every other givenchy scent ive ever smelled, has been at least better than average. pi and pi neo are great IMO.    but the desire didnt translate and this fragrance is pretty much a flop. ive had my nose over much worse, but i wouldnt buy this. however, it doesnt smell cheap.</li>
    <li> Smells great...husband loved it!!!</li>
    <li> Great price and Smells great. This is the real deal.</li>
    <li> Doubt this is the real deal.  My husband has been wearing this for years but is now difficult/impossible to find in the local stores so I bought from Amazon.  Although the external package looked fine, the bottle is not shaded like the others he&#x27;s had, there is no label on the bottom of the bottle like on the others, and the smell is more like alcohol with a little scent added.  My hubby didn&#x27;t open the box until almost 6 months after I purchased for him as a gift and were both disappointed.</li>
    <li> this was a birthday gift and they liked it  cant find this easily and this was the best price out there</li>
    <li> ONLY A FEW PLACES CARY . GOOD DEAL . WAS LOOKING round , hard iten to find @ a fair price</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a wonderful fragrance and I express them in the future I&#x27;ll buy more than Symbol I&#x27;m proud of her</li>
    <li> I think it does not require much description: Aroma friendly and durable. Reflects masculinity. Blend of aromas: wood, citrus, floral and more.</li>
    <li> A fairly generic fragrance, it starts off with a strong scent of baby powder and coco puffs, followed shortly by sweet citrus (like fruit stripe gum).  Like a great many men&#x27;s fragrances this one, once applied to my skin turns very sweet, almost unpleasantly so.  Hopefully it will go a different direction on yours.  For me it&#x27;s ok, if a bit feminine.  I don&#x27;t expect I&#x27;ll buy another.  And this 3.4 oz. spray bottle will likely end up in the back of a drawer, forgotten, and then rediscovered some years later.  \\&quot;Oh, that!\\&quot; I&#x27;ll probably say, \\&quot;What was I thinking?\\&quot; and then toss it.</li>
    <li> I really like this product if you are looking for something diferent this Toilette Spray is for you. The seller is awesome he/she deliver it very soon. I must have another one in the future.</li>
    <li> This is really nice......I would buy it again....</li>
    <li> I love it, I wish they never discontinued this fragrance , it&#x27;s my signature Spring and Summer smell. Very fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> La fragancia es agradable, es magnifico, estoy muy complacido; ademas recibi el paquete en el tiempo especificado con las mejores condiciones.</li>
    <li> I was looking for this nice smelling scent for a while, went to my local Macy&#x27;s store and they explained&lt;br /&gt;this item was no longer for retail sale so I looked around found a couple of sites, but they seemed shady&lt;br /&gt;so I figured best I order it on Amazon ordered it received it, and I just loved this scent constantly receive&lt;br /&gt;compliments on this scent smells great highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Good transaction everything I expected</li>
