<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It was fine,  got it in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> Received right away. Happy to find product.</li>
    <li> I have used this for 30 years and it can not be replace by any product on the market. It so wonderful</li>
    <li> Rich cream for dry skin</li>
    <li> Wonderful product, so glad that I could find it, never used anything else, the best ever made.  Recommend it to all.</li>
    <li> I love the product, have used it for years....but does anyone else see the 25.00 price tag on the item that is for sale for almost double that....? A little disappointed.</li>
    <li> I use this product in the past I sent to a relative ad a gift was received when suggested will order again.</li>
    <li> This product if put on correctly...not too much makes your skin feel so soft and smooth.  If you over do it it feels and appears too greasy, but your skin still feels and looks great!</li>
    <li> Excellent product and service</li>
    <li> Literally, THE deepest moisturizer you can buy to penatrate the layers of your skin.  (see: Eterna 27/Revelon History FDA 1950&#x27;s)  One jar can last me for a couple of years.  You dit-dot on your face then smooth it in, do not smear it on in globs.  A fantastic moisutrizer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for years but haven&#x27;t been able to find it, so was really happy to find it here.  I bought 4 jars and saved the shipping.  The price was excellent.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome cream.... if you use it on the long run your wrinkles will disappear. thats to bad that CVS/LONGS has discontinued it from their store. I think they should bring it back. but if they dont we still have AMAZON :)</li>
    <li> Having used the Eterna cream every night for lo! some 30 or more years, I cannot face (no pun intended) being without it -  delighted to find it still available on Amazon</li>
    <li> I cannot live without this product.  I have been using it for 20+ years with amazing results.  I use to be able to buy the 6oz jars at Walgreens but, lately, it has not been available, so I am glad to see I can buy it through Amazon.</li>
    <li> Really moistens the skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 40? years and I know someday I won&#x27;t be able to get it any longer.  I have NO wrinkles and it&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;the best face cream ever.  But typical of not only Revlon, other companies too, stop making a good product for &amp;#34;no reason&amp;#34;???</li>
    <li> I have been using Revlon Eterna &#x27;27&#x27;  moisture cream with Progenitin for 20 years now.&lt;br /&gt;This product when applied is not greasy. Dries quickly so you can apply your make up asap.&lt;br /&gt;Over the 20 years, my skin has felt softer, firmer and a look of 10 years younger. I am now 51.</li>
    <li> I have used Revlon Eterna &#x27;27 Moisture Cream with Progenitin for many  years and I will not use any other moisture cream because I have had so  much success with this. It keeps my skin soft and makes a great  base for makeup and is absorbed quickly.</li>
    <li> My 89 year old mother has used this product since day one. Her skin is beautiful and receives compliments from people everyday. I ordered this for her and it arrived timely.  What would we all do without Amazon!!  I love!</li>
    <li> I worked for Revlon as a regional trainer many years ago. I started using Eterna &#x27;27 with Progenitin back then...I&#x27;ve also worked for several other cosmetic companies, and used many of their products...but I would always \\&quot;sneak\\&quot; my Progenitin cream, as I refused to live without it. I still have a drawer full of cosmetics and creams that I recieved free whilst working in the cosmetic industry...but here I am buying more Eterna &#x27;27, because I am almost out.</li>
    <li> Revlon Eterna 27 Moisture Cream Progenitin, 6 ounze&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I  have used this product for many, many years and I love it.  It is very sad that they seem to have discontinued the Eterna 27 all day lotion which was equally excellent.</li>
    <li> The best moistruizer available - have been using this for many years, and&lt;br /&gt;was so pleased to find it available on Amazon.com when it was no longer&lt;br /&gt;available in retail stores.</li>
    <li> I have used it for years and have found it very good for ageing skin normally&lt;br /&gt;Hard to find so I was pleased to see it on Amazon</li>
    <li> I AM 71 AND HAVE USED THIS CREAM SINCE I WAS 21 AND FEEL THAT IT HAS REALLY HEPED KEEP MY SKIN STAY SUPPLE.  I LIVED IN THE SUN MOST OF MY LIFE.DIRECT SUN IN HOT TROPICAL CLIMATES. IT IS NOT READILY AVAILABLE SO WAS GLAD WHEN I FOUND IT ON LINES.</li>
    <li> Love, love this product.  Used to purchase at Walgreen&#x27;s; but they no longer carry the 6oz size.  I have been using this product for at least 15 years and simply cannot live without it.  Please, please do no stop offering this excellent moisture cream.</li>
    <li> Wife loves it! She has been using it  for 60+ years. She&#x27;s 82.</li>
    <li> Was concerned about freshness in online order but it is very good/</li>
    <li> This cream is awesome!</li>
    <li> this is the best cream I have ever used and I am so glad to have found it again , as it is becoming difficult to find but why is it  ow&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This creme is as I said fantastic and I wanted to order it again but the price is astronomical considering the creme only cost 25dollars and you are advertising it for 149 ..shame on you</li>
    <li> My mother used this, and I remember poo-pooing it, all those many years ago.  I found it here, recently, and decided that I might as well give it a try.  I am almost 57, going through menopause, and everything on my body is drying up.  This is a heavy product, but it has seriously retexturized my skin.  If you can get past the smell, which is not good, and the initial greasy feel when you put it on, it is amazing.  You wake up just looking better- it all soaks in while you sleep, I guess.  The big thing is- my husband commented on how good my skin looks!!!!!! He noticed!  I wear no foundation, just a tinted moisturizer with sunscreen and concealer under my eyes during the day,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this stuff.</li>
    <li> The best cream on the market for wrinkles, lines, discolor, and age and/or sun spots. The best money for your buck.</li>
    <li> I have worn Eterna &#x27;27 (with Progesterone) for years...it is the best.  I follow with department store foundation and make up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An important note is to be SURE you are purchasing the one with Progesterone in it. Google the purpose and history of this ingrediant and you will find this is what sets Eterna &#x27;27 apart from the other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stock up on this one because I don&#x27;t want to run out and not be able to purchase locally.</li>
    <li> Great deal I use this product for the years.  Work very well for me.</li>
    <li> I love this Eterna &#x27;27 cream.  My mother used it, and she had absolutely&lt;br /&gt;beautiful skin.  I hope they make it forever.</li>
    <li> AAA++++  Great shipping job.  A great products&lt;br /&gt;Thanks a bunch!!!!</li>
    <li> My mother started me using this product about 30 years ago.  She is 89 and has used it for much longer than that.   Now, I can&#x27;t find the 6 oz jars any longer, only the 2 oz jars for the same price as the 6 oz.   What happened to this great product????</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different face creams and this has helped me tremendously ! I have an issue with scaly skin around my nose and in the winter my face will get real chapped from working outside !The 6 oz jar is quite the deal it has lasted me over 2 years</li>
    <li> Have used it previously. It works . Delivery was good and on time</li>
    <li> It was a gift for my mother in law.  She loves it and had been using it for more than 20 years. She has a really beautiful skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Eterna 27 for many years, while I&#x27;ve sometimes tried other products for my face, this is the tried and true one I always come back to.</li>
    <li> have used this cream for at least 25 years, jut hope they keep making it.</li>
    <li> I was absolutely thrilled to find this product available as it has been discontinued by Revlon even though it is an excellent cream.  Even Consumers&#x27; Report tested creams years ago and this one was the sole winner.  Why Revlon discontinued its Eterna 27 line is a mystery to me.  I was happy that this site hadn&#x27;t jacked up the price, also.  Many others charge a literal fortune for discontinued merchandise.  The creams arrived in short order &amp; I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
    <li> Great product that&#x27;s been around for ever.  Glad that it can be purchased on Amazon.  It&#x27;s hard to find at stores.  Price is okay.  Works incredible for facial moisturizer at night.  Absolute recommendation.</li>
    <li> I have used this item for years &amp; really like it.  I used to get it in the stores but they only have the small jars now.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years--love it.</li>
    <li> I have used eterna 27 by Revlon for 40 years and I absolutely will not do without it, I am 78 years old and no one ever guesses my age, and it absolutely feels wonderful on my skin, I just won&#x27;t do without it.</li>
    <li> USING THIS CREAM FOR 40 YEARS AND WILL NOT STOP. MY SKIN STILL LOOKS PRETTY GOOD. ANYONE WHO HAS TRIED IT WON&#x27;T GO BACK.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> This has been my favorite night cream for many years, and it is hard to find now that Revlon has discontinued making it. In addition the service was marvelous....it came quicker than I could have imagined.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Was so disappointed when I could no longer find this product in Walgreen&#x27;s. Was very pleasantly surprised the product was exactly the same as I had been using, but a bit costly!</li>
    <li> Best cream ever! All the women in family use it!</li>
    <li> My wife does!  She has used Eterna 27 for at least the 35 years I have known her, and everyone tells her she looks 20 years younger than her age.  I&#x27;d like to think it&#x27;s our wonderful relationship, enhanced with Eterna 27.  It really works!  Just wish I could find a better price.</li>
    <li> I have used it since I was 21 years old, I love it and can&#x27;t live without it! Everybody compliments me on my skin!!</li>
    <li> My grandmother has used this cream for years. It is very hard to find in stores, and it is twice this price when we can find it. My grandmother is 90 and has very few wrinkles due to using this cream.</li>
    <li> everythings was fine and at time</li>
    <li> FAITHFULLY USED FOR DECADES</li>
    <li> My sister always used this....as I got older, I tried it, but my skin was too oily at the time.  Now, my skin is dry, and this is the BEST!</li>
    <li> my all time favorite ,could not be without it ,,hard to find anymore ,,its the best .. can always count on amazon to find it ... love ,love ,love it  ...</li>
    <li> the product was fine and delivered within the alloted time frame. i would however caution anyone doing business with this co. to be very aware of their shipping charges, which are outrageous. one can clearly see that a good portion of their profit is built into these charges. buyer beware!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve written previous reviews about this product.  Life-long user and big fan of Eterna with Progenitin.  I suspect it&#x27;s much better than pricier stuff and its large and loyal fan base is proof.</li>
    <li> Bought for grandmother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She has used this for pretty much longer than I&#x27;ve been alive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes I think she only keeps me around so I can order it now that her local carrier is out of business.</li>
    <li> wonderful was able to find it here no longer available in stores, like everything else obsolete. new is not always better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Eterna 27 for 45 years and it&#x27;s the best.  Can&#x27;t go without it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Have been using it ev ery day for many years.</li>
    <li> This is the very ultimate product if you have dry skin.  I&#x27;ve used it for more years than I care to admit  but have tried so many, many other priducts over the years but none can even come close it if you have dry or sun damaged skin.  I don&#x27;t know how I could ever be happy with anything elce.  All my friends have been introduced to this product and have gone on to introduced it to their friends and family.  Please don&#x27;t ever change Eutrna 27 (with proenitin).</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I started using it over 30 years ago, when I was trained by Revlon to sell cosmetics and skin care products.  I am 80 years old, and people tell me all the time that I have beautiful skin.  I have used it some of the time with a Retine product, but mostly by itself.  Revlon should use me for a model for the product, but I know they don&#x27;t advertise itl.  I tell everyone I can about Eterna 27 with Progenitin because I believe in it, and am afraid they will take it off the market because they don&#x27;t advertise it.  Thank you for handling it and making it available to us as the stores don&#x27;t often carry it.</li>
    <li> This is the best wrinkle-reducer around. And the most cost-effective. You can get a huge jar for $40 (6 oz), and a little of this goes a LONG way. I use it not only on my face, but on my chest (to avoid those old-lady wrinkles you get - you know what I mean, girls) and on my arms, to avoid that crinkly old-lady skin you get there as well. I will never, ever stop using this cream - if I did, I&#x27;m afraid I would age 20 years in a matter of days! It does take about 7 - 10 days to really see the full benefits of what this cream can do, but once you&#x27;re there, you&#x27;ll never look back. Forget about paying $100 for a little vial of &amp;#34;wrinkle reducer&amp;#34; - this stuff actually DOES what it says it will do, and for relatively little money. I think it&#x27;s Revlon&#x27;s best kept secret!!!!</li>
    <li> Have used this as a moisturizer for at least 30 years, and am told very often how great my skin is.  Will try other moisturizers ever so often that people recommend but I always come back to this product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for many years and even though, I&#x27;m over the hill, LOL, people thinks I&#x27;m in my early thirties.  Love it! The only problem is that I can&#x27;t find this cream in any store around hear in So. Jersey. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I am 29 years old and I have tried many different products for my face. I have spend hundreds if not thousands of dollars on facial products. Lately about 6 months ago or so, I broke out big time on my face and I have no idea why. I tried everything from Sephora to cvs, Ulta, and walgreens. Nothing helped. I&#x27;ve tried Hope in a Jar, Boscia products, etc.&lt;br /&gt;My great aunt is 86 years old and has amazing skin for her age. I was about to give up hope on my face when my mother suggested we ask my aunt what product she uses. My great aunt  told me that her mother recommended this product to her when she was 28 years old. And she stuck with it until now. So I gave it a try and decided to buy it (of course only online you can buy it because the local pharmacies do not sell it anymore.)  From the first time I put this stuff on my face my skin felt soooo good. Unlike any other product I have tried. The smell isn&#x27;t the greatest but you will learn to just get used to it. I put some on every evening (generously) and in the morning as well. Since my makeup is bare minerals, the foundation works beautifully together with the creme. It gets rid of the shininess that the creme makes your skin to be.  It&#x27;s been about a month that I have been using Eterna 27 and my face has dramatically cleared up. Just a couple of pimples but nothing like it was in the beginning, when I first started using it. I LOVE LOVE this creme. I love how it makes my skin feel and the results are amazing. I wish more people knew about this product. Also, I have very sensitive skin that is why I have a hard time finding things that work. When I put this creme on my face, I obviously had no reaction. And if you read the ingredients, it is made up of all natural ingredients, which is rare to find a product like that, today. Anyway, I make sure  to tell all my family members and friends about this stuff, Because it works!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this moisture cream for years.  I have not found any other creams that I like as well.</li>
    <li> My mother used Eterna 27 with Progenitin and I have used it for decades. There are several contemporary products with peptides and retinol etc., and I use them,  but Eterna 27 with Progenitin has a unique place in a face care regimen.  It is my one &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; daily cream. No other product comes close.  It is an excellent moisturizer that really softens lines and tones skin.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years but it is becoming harder to find in stores.  I was delighted when I saw it on Amazon for $20!  However,while I was looking at products to go with it, when I went to purchase it the price was $40. which was high even for retail!  I bought it anyway because I had been looking for it quite a while but I felt that it was bogus business practices to advertise it on the Revlon site for $20. and have it on your site for the same price until I purchased it and then the price was raised to $40. Seems too much like a  &amp;#34;bait and switch&amp;#34; tactic to me.  In the future,  I will be searching other sites hoping for a lot more honesty.  I was really disappointed that you do business like this because you come recommended highly.</li>
    <li> A wonderful product.  Rich moisturizer I believe to be the best!</li>
    <li> This cream is wonderful and really helps with wrinkles.  What is frustrating is paying almost $50 for a container and the box says it is $25.</li>
    <li> I had the luxury of sampling La Mer from a friend&#x27;s stash. Granted, I was disappointed but highly intrigued since it GREATLY resembled, in terms of texture and smell, my Nivea (the regular small blue container) moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quite greasy, if you wipe it on your face it will definitely look white unless you spread it very evenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price isn&#x27;t that awesome. I work in the beauty department and I haven&#x27;t seen anyone buy it. If they give us a discount or a smaller size I might try it again and persuade customers to buy it as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I might even try to buy the actual Eterna 27 and a Nivea and test it on both side of my face...hmm! :)</li>
    <li> Have used the cream for years---glad I can still find it online</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Revlon Eterna 27 with progenitin for years.  As we age our skin becomes more dry and needs extra moisturizing. This is the perfect face cream for dry skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product on my face for at least 25 years. It is the best, most gentle face products I have ever found. Why Revlon does not sell it directly at the $25.00 rate that is on the box on I received is beyond me. Given its popularity and longevity, why is it not more readily available?</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE BEST CREAM I HAVE EVER USED.  But it is for mature faces, because of its rich cream...........</li>
    <li> My grandma has been using this cream for years so I decided to order me a jar and test it out!  I absolutely loved it so much, Im on my second jar~!  Its has a nice thick consistency and at first seemed a little greasy, however; my skin soaked it up so fast and my skin looks amazing.  I recommend only using as a night cream, but I promise when you wake up in the morning you will notice a huge difference in your skin.  I would recommend this to anyone (all ages)  Outstanding over all the other creams I have tried!</li>
    <li> I like this cream as it really helps moisturize my dry skin. It makes skin super soft and smooth. I just wish they would take the supposed cancer causing ingredient out of it. I use this on my face every evening before bed, and wake up with beautiful skin. I would recommend it to all my friends.</li>
    <li> I HAVE USED ETERNA 27 WITH PROGENITIN FOR ABOUT 15 YEARS.IT IS A GREAT FACE CREAM.I HAVENT FOUND ANYTHING BETTER.IT REALLY HELPS THE FINE LINES ON YOUR FACE.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product in good faith. I am familiar with the product and purchase for my sister.&lt;br /&gt;I was extremely unsatisfied with the price.  The box arrived and it was clearly priced $25.00 and I paid $79.00 each for 2 jars.  I emailed the seller to make it right and was told so much as tough luck - we are cheaper than another seller.&lt;br /&gt;Regardless the suggested pre price should be what was honored.&lt;br /&gt;The seller said I could return the product for refund however it was a gift for my sister who needed it and I didn&#x27;t want to \\&quot;take it back\\&quot;.  This is a warning to be aware of sellers who price gouge - 3x the retail price is a lesson learned from me and I will be hesitant in purchasing through Amazon again!</li>
    <li> I found this product at Walgreen&#x27;s and decided to give it a try. I put it on the first night I bought it and had a significant better skin texture in the morning. I have battled most of my adult life with dry skin,oily spots, blemishes and discoloration from my bouts with acne. When using this product be sure to wear sunscreen or limit sun exsposer, as I exasperated a case of sun burn from just driving in my car.  This product is difficult to find, so when I located it on Amazon I jumped at the chance.</li>
    <li> Best product ever - -</li>
    <li> It makes my face and neck feel really moisturized.  It is creamy and rich.  Yes, I would recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> My order was filled exactly as I had ordered it, and when it got here I opened it immediately to double check the&lt;br /&gt;contents to be sure there was not problem, such as breakage or spills, and I was more than pleased to find everything&lt;br /&gt;in tact.  I rate the service as 5 stars.  This was not my first time to order through Amazon.  I trust Amazon.</li>
    <li> For years I have been searching for something to cure my acne and pretty much gave up because nothing worked! I then became pregnant and then my face broke out 10x worse I was going crazy until finally I found out my grandmother who&#x27;s 93 but looks 70 was using this product and it made her skin look so clear and young so I finally tried it and at first it drove me nuts how moist it was but by the time I woke up my face felt like a brand new person all fresh and smooth my face no longer breaks out at all and it&#x27;s helping take away the roughness look of my skin and makes it looks soo smooth I absolutely love this product and highly suggest it to all you out there who struggle from acne!!</li>
    <li> I have used this cream for many years.It is the best moisture cream around. I use it at night and day.&lt;br /&gt;  Donna Lee Roby</li>
    <li> It arrived just as expected, AND on the 1st day of the 4 day window.  Thank You!</li>
    <li> How can something that states on the label \\&quot;Special Value $25.00\\&quot; cost over $50?  Amazon - explanation?  I have nothing to say about the quality of the product, I bought it for an elderly lady. Just take issue with the labeling and pricing of the product.</li>
    <li> using for 30 years--its great and this was a good bargin</li>
    <li> Even though I enjoy using this moisture cream, I&#x27;m a bit put off by the scent. Also, I feel it important to note the box had a sticker on it that said it was to be sold at Walgreen for $25 and to report if bought elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Why not add  SPF 15 to the product?  It would be a benefit found in many daytime moisturizers this year.</li>
    <li> Love this cream. My mom started me using it a very long time ago.</li>
    <li> I have thin, fine skin prone to dryness.  I cannot say enough about how much I love this creme.  I&#x27;ve used the gambit from Chanel to Olay -- this works best for me at this stage of my life.  It, combined with OZ Naturals HLA serum, has plumped the skin around my eyes and mouth, two places that were starting to show my age.  I feel better about my skin after using both products together the past three months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I&#x27;m sensitive to perfume -- I will warn you, this does have an odor.  However, it diffuses after a few minutes.  It does not cause an allergic reaction with me, as other perfumed products have in my past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product.</li>
    <li> I love it, I use this cream for over 20 years.  It is a pity that you do not have direct service to La Paz-Bolivia, I would like to know the reason.  In the past I did not have any problem.  I hope you clarify this for me.</li>
    <li> Very good cream&lt;br /&gt;Like very much</li>
    <li> MY MOTHER BEGAN USING THIS CREAM AT A VERY EARLY AGE AND SHE IS NOW 87 AND LOOKS MAYBE ONLY 70.  SHE USES IT RELIGIOUSLY EVERY NIGHT.  I STARTED USING IT ALSO ~ UNFORTUNATELY NOT AS EARLY AS SHE DID.  HOPING FOR SOME CLOSE TO RESULTS</li>
    <li> You can find at WALGREENS for $15 and they&#x27;re always buy one get one 50% off. I love this it&#x27;s the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever had in my life. My skin is acne prone and very dry this stopped the break outs with time. I can&#x27;t love without it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for decades and tried other products at various times, but nothing hydrates as well as this item.  It is getting difficult to find it in stores, so I&#x27;m very pleased that I can still find it via AmAzon.</li>
    <li> This creme is so good moisturizing skin ... and it&#x27;s quality is consistent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a product that my wife has being using for more than 30 years.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer.  I&#x27;ve used it everyday for 40+ years</li>
    <li> Five Star!  I&#x27;m 83 and have used this product since I was in my 30&#x27;s - almost 45 years. Hard to believe. When in the hospital recently nurses came in to see me because they couldn&#x27;t believe how young I looked. They thought I was 20 years younger. Of course I use a little more of it now morning and night. It gets absorbed in less than 1/2 hr. Don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without it.</li>
    <li> I appreciate the moisture and softness on my very dry skin.</li>
    <li> This is the wifes and she will use nothing else.</li>
    <li> So moisturizing! Kinda small like my grandma, but, love the way my skin feels in the morning, soft, supple, dewey...</li>
    <li> I used it before. It&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my Mother who has used this cream for decades and can no longer find it in stores. Will buy again</li>
    <li> This is VERRRRRRRRRy OLD merchandise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The jar is marked $25.00.  Yet I am charged $ 40.50.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not opened the jar yet. I may have to return it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hilda Valenta</li>
    <li> I have used this cream for years. It really firms my face and leaves it nice and soft in the morning. It really helps me have nice skin without feeling greasy. Love it.</li>
    <li> I love, love this product.  Several years ago decided to go back to Revlon moisturizer and have never regretted that decision.  Product is reasonably priced and works great.  I am almost 65 years of age and get compliments on my skin.</li>
    <li> with so many Moisture creams on the market, my mother swears by Revlon Eterna Moisture cream. She has been using for many years and asks me to reorder it every few months. She has dry skin, which has helped her a lot and also has lightened her skin. She recommends it to everyone.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I remember my Aunt using this since I was a little girl.  It is still the best night cream you can buy..  Thanks Revlon and thx for the quick shipping.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom and she loves it</li>
    <li> I love it! I have very dry skin and I am 73 years old so the battle of the wrinkles is on but I am winning the battle with ETERNA &#x27;27.  Try it! I hope you will like it as much as I do.</li>
    <li> Product is true Eterna 27. It arrived quickly and packaged well. I worked at Revlon for 32 years and this is one of the best products we ever brought to market. When this is gone, I will truly be sad as it is discontinued and with Progenitin is gold.</li>
    <li> Got this cream for my mother for Mother&#x27;s Day. She looks twenty years younger already. Thanks so much, will buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for over forty years and wouldn&#x27;t want any other.  I would recommend it to anyone and everyone!</li>
    <li> REVLON&#x27;S Aeterna 27 recieved fine many months ago&lt;br /&gt;Thank you&lt;br /&gt;Euro Hdez</li>
    <li> This was a present to my mother-in-law. she really likes this brand for facials. The price was ok and it is a big bottle.</li>
