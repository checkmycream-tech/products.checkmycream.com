      <li>I love the smell of this  baby lotion.</li>
      <li>I ordered their unscented &amp; love it ~</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>

      <li>and I love the fact that my son skin agree it .</li>
      <li>I love this product but its OVER PRICED on Amazon.</li>

      <li>Very moisturizing and smells amazing!</li>
      <li>Very nice lotion for this 50+ sensitive skin.</li>

      <li>It feels great &amp; scent is pretty and pretty strong...</li>
      <li>Smell so good n light, very moist..</li>
      <li>I highly recommend if you&#x27;re looking for a good lotion with out all those yucky chemicals.</li>
      <li>Upon first smelling this, I liked it.</li>
      <li>gave this one to my teenager and she described as a sporty yet sweet scent :)</li>
      <li>Very smooth and smells pretty.</li>
      <li>I love it so much, I began using it myself.</li>
      <li>~ I wanted it for my face &amp; it&#x27;s super perfumy</li>
      <li>I use this for my 19 month old and he just smells so fresh and clean :) Ive also started using it and it makes my skin so nice and soft!</li>
      <li>This one has a delicate, beautiful and unique scent.</li>
      <li>Also in between each use, lotion at the tip of the nozzle solidifies, so the first pump is always just to clean out the gunk.</li>
      <li>Not only does this smell amazing.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t worth the price.</li>
      <li>Very high quality products!</li>
      <li>We were given the first bottle as a gift and</li>
      <li>I picked this up on a whim in Target and love it, not only does my baby use it</li>
      <li>2) feels super soft 3)</li>
      <li>The smell is just too much.</li>
      <li>Thanks so much.</li>
      <li>I really wanted to like this, as I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for an all-natural lotion with antioxidants and oils.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend!</li>
      <li>I tried several different lotions, including California Baby (which I otherwise liked) and nothing helped.  </li>
      <li>, three starts for the smell it gives, I used a little on top of the other lotion that does keep he&#x27;s skin soft, just for the nice baby smell.</li>
      <li>I did not give a five star rating because the pump requires more strength than should be necessary for getting lotion out - particularly for being baby lotion as users will inevitably be trying to operate the bottle with one hand.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not oily or thick, the smell is wonderful because it&#x27;s not a strong smell.</li>
      <li>which is fine just not exactly head to toe as described in my opinion</li>
      <li>They weren&#x27;t even going to immediately ship us a new one for their defected</li>
      <li>I chose this Shea moisture for my 6 month son skin because his skin is very sensitive.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s scented, prettily but definitely scented.</li>
      <li>My infants skin is on the dry side we started out using The Honest Company when she was born but even with everyday use it</li>
      <li>My skin feels really soft for hours after using this lotion.</li>
      <li>What causes the smell if all the ingredients are natural?</li>
      <li>but so does my 7 year old.</li>
      <li>and it is free of harsh chemicals!  </li>
      <li>My baby&#x27;s arms and legs felt rough like shark skin for the first 9 months.  </li>
      <li>We contacted the company; they told us that we would have to ship it back, and if we wanted a new one, we&#x27;d have to order it again.</li>
      <li>This lotion is rich and thick, and within a week I noticed a difference.  </li>
      <li>One was super runny (not typical) &amp; the other was the thick cream (normal).</li>
      <li>My 5 year old has dry skin and eczema in the winter and every night I lather her in the lotion</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Can&#x27;t say enough about this company. Very high quality products!</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo and lotion for my newborn...&lt;br /&gt;The good... Smell so good n light, very moist..&lt;br /&gt;The bad...... The pump is a headache ... Take forever to pump out just a bit.&lt;br /&gt;I end up switching the pump for the shampoo..</li>
    <li> I love this product but its OVER PRICED on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Upon first smelling this, I liked it. But when using only a bit on hand and cuticles, I could not tolerate the smell. I&#x27;m so bummed, as it has beneficial ingredients for the skin. I would NEVER use this on a child&#x27;s body. The smell is just too much. What causes the smell if all the ingredients are natural? I really wanted to like this, as I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for an all-natural lotion with antioxidants and oils. Any suggestions? Thanks so much.</li>
    <li> Superb lotion!  No junk in the ingredient list.  Very smooth and smells pretty.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t worth the price.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this  baby lotion.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff. We were given the first bottle as a gift and when it was empty we found it at Amazon. Great product, smells great, makes the babies feel really smooth (and they love it).</li>
    <li> Silky, non-greasy and wonderful smelling. My skin feels really soft for hours after using this lotion. Knowing the ingredients are pure and natural makes it the perfect moisturizer for my family.</li>

I did not give a five star rating because the pump requires more strength than should be necessary for getting lotion out - particularly for being baby lotion as users will inevitably be trying to operate the bottle with one hand. Also in between each use, lotion at the tip of the nozzle solidifies, so the first pump is always just to clean out the gunk. It seems that the thickness of the lotion has something to do with both issues. Overall, the smell and quality of the product is worth the slightly irritating dispenser issues.</li>
    <li> My family loves this lotion! I use this for my 19 month old and he just smells so fresh and clean :) Ive also started using it and it makes my skin so nice and soft!</li>
    <li> I ordered this after it was recommended by a friend, I was told it was unscented...needless to say it is not. It didn&#x27;t meet my needs as I wanted an unscented lotion but that&#x27;s my fault for not reading description &amp; listening to a friend &amp; one-click ordering! It feels great &amp; scent is pretty and pretty strong...which is fine just not exactly head to toe as described in my opinion ~ I wanted it for my face &amp; it&#x27;s super perfumy ~ still gave it 5* cuz I didn&#x27;t read description or reviews &amp; that&#x27;s not their fault ~ but I never leave reviews so I wanted to just in case others read them ~ to summarize: 1) it&#x27;s scented, prettily but definitely scented. 2) feels super soft 3) a little goes a long way 4) I ordered their unscented &amp; love it ~ gave this one to my teenager and she described as a sporty yet sweet scent :)</li>
    <li> I use this on my son&#x27;s skin after baths and in his cloth diaper wipe solution. Haven&#x27;t seen any adverse reactions. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Excellent, thank-you.</li>
    <li> My baby&#x27;s arms and legs felt rough like shark skin for the first 9 months.  I tried several different lotions, including California Baby (which I otherwise liked) and nothing helped.  This lotion is rich and thick, and within a week I noticed a difference.  One more week and his skin was very smooth.  Also, this lotion smells great and the matching shampoo and body wash is the best smelling of all of the Shea Moisture line.  I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This is the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used on my baby. He gets severely dry skin espiecially during the winter months. It even protects his skin from diaper rash. I love it so much, I began using it myself. It also smells incredible</li>
    <li> This is great-- smells and feels good !!&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY it from this dealer !!&lt;br /&gt;BUY it from Bed Bath and Beyond/Harmon for only $9.99 ONLY !!</li>
    <li> Silky smooth with a delightful light fragrance. Very nice lotion for this 50+ sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> the absolute best lotion for anyone. My 5 year old has dry skin and eczema in the winter and every night I lather her in the lotion and she stays for moisturized. I use it too! Smells great!</li>
    <li> This is great!!  I love how it smells and it is free of harsh chemicals!  I love it!</li>
    <li> I chose this Shea moisture for my 6 month son skin because his skin is very sensitive. I love it. I love the sense, I love how it make his skin feel and I love the fact that my son skin agree it .</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like the smell. My son skin didn&#x27;t like it at all. Had to return it.</li>
    <li> Not only does this smell amazing. It works great! Not just for babies, I use this myself. I highly recommend if you&#x27;re looking for a good lotion with out all those yucky chemicals.</li>
    <li> My infants skin is on the dry side we started out using The Honest Company when she was born but even with everyday use it her skin remained dry. I picked this up on a whim in Target and love it, not only does my baby use it but so does my 7 year old. Very moisturizing and smells amazing! There are lower prices out there I try to buy it when it&#x27;s on sale at the drug stores.</li>
    <li> I still have no idea what this product is like. Unfortunately, the moisturizer for my infant&#x27;s peeling skin came days later than it was supposed to, and when I received it the pump was cracked off. We contacted the company; they told us that we would have to ship it back, and if we wanted a new one, we&#x27;d have to order it again. They weren&#x27;t even going to immediately ship us a new one for their defected product!&lt;br /&gt;This is an infant we are talking about, who needs the moisturizer now, not next week, when the next bottle comes...&lt;br /&gt;I am beyond annoyed, and as a new mom, I don&#x27;t have the time nor the strength to be running to the pharmacy for every need.&lt;br /&gt;I am extremely upset by this situation and would not recommend ordering this product from this seller.</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 of these. One was super runny (not typical) &amp; the other was the thick cream (normal).</li>
    <li> Love the way this stuff rubs in and the smell is delish!</li>
    <li> Love the smell and feel of the lotion, HATE THE PUMP. It&#x27;s so hard to push down to even get a tad bit of the lotion.</li>
    <li> I liked it.i have to put a lot and not sticky on the skin.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not oily or thick, the smell is wonderful because it&#x27;s not a strong smell. It does not provide any Moisture to my baby&#x27;s skin, even after several days of used it didn&#x27;t  make a difference, my baby does not have dry skin but I did want a lotion to keep he&#x27;s own skin moist/softness but this lotion does nothing to he&#x27;s skin and it did get dry after only using this lotion for a couple of days, three starts for the smell it gives, I used a little on top of the other lotion that does keep he&#x27;s skin soft, just for the nice baby smell.</li>
