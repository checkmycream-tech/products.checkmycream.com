      <li>I love this stuff!</li>
      <li>This and Some-Kind-of-Gorgeous are my two favorite make-up items, EVER!</li>
      <li>So pretty!!!!</li>
      <li>It gives a nice sheen or glow to your skin.</li>
      <li>Nice glow.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Thanks kindly for your help.  </li>
      <li>If it were not shimmery, I would honestly keep it and use it as a contouring color.</li>
      <li>I used it with a tinted BB cream and liked the results.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice highlighter</li>
      <li>When I do add it on with heavier make-up (Some-Kind-A-Gorgeous &amp; eyeshadow on as well), I love it even more!</li>
      <li>I have naturally bronze / tanned skin, and this compliments my complexion wonderfully by giving it a nice healthy glow without being too glittery or overdone.</li>
      <li>Talk about highlighting made easy!  </li>
      <li>It made me look greasier, and way too &amp;#34;made up&amp;#34;, even though I used a very light hand.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very light</li>
      <li>but I think there are better highlighters out there.</li>
      <li>All the products since that I&#x27;ve gotten are top notch(and</li>
      <li>I love Benefit Cosmetics; Benefit and MAC</li>
      <li>So glad I just dove in a splurged.</li>
      <li>I love it and use it every time I go out.</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>I will buy again unless i find one better.</li>
      <li>Also, the packaging although adorable, makes no sense.  </li>
      <li>I love the champagne color of Watt&#x27;s up</li>
      <li>Love love love.  </li>
      <li>Packing is really cute and convienent with the blender sponge on one end.</li>
      <li>If you love benefit but have a fair skin tone, stick with the High Beam product.</li>
      <li>Easy to use.  </li>
      <li>Easy to carry in your bag its so compact.</li>
      <li>Color is pretty champagne color and blends really nicely.</li>
      <li>it blended in beautifully on my face, no pink, no obnoxious sparkles, just a nice natural looking shimmer, which I&#x27;ve been searching for for almost a year now.</li>
      <li>This is a good two - three shades darker than my natural skin tone and a highlighter shouldn&#x27;t be darker than you are.</li>
      <li>I got this after reading the great reviews and while it is a decent product, it is only suitable for medium/tan skin tones to olive.</li>
      <li>I first got this product I was in love with it</li>
      <li>Worth every penny I paid!</li>
      <li>but I wanted to review here anyways because I think reviews are useful</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s fun to use and can help create a glowing look</li>
      <li>I felt that If I had more time to play and maybe next time invest in another complimentary product, I&#x27;d be onto something!  </li>
      <li>The right amount of shimmer without being overpowering.  </li>
      <li>I love that I do not need any sort of base foundation or powder, I can put it on with POREfessional, PosieTint &amp; BadGal Lash and have an awesome, easy, 5 minute make-up look without having to cake it on.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to use it daily as a highlighter on the top of the apples of my cheeks and under my eyebrow</li>
      <li>I was cautious ... very cautious!  </li>
      <li>I will definitely buy this again unless I can find something better, but considering my lack of luck with highlighters</li>
      <li>Have tried several highlighter products love this item.</li>
      <li>My first purchase was this pencil.  </li>
      <li>This is really my first highlighter purchase</li>
      <li>Likewise, it is probably far too light for people with deep/dark skin tones.</li>
      <li>but I feel that it has a very make-up look to it</li>
      <li>Since those products are liquid you can gently pat it on without compromising the makeup you&#x27;ve got on underneath.</li>
      <li>I really wanted out, but not without that darn concealer/highlighter I \\&quot;had to have\\&quot;</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d really like to know where I can purchase this item,</li>
      <li>I do not recommend using it with a powder foundation because it results in a very cakey</li>
      <li>(the sponge applicator it comes with is absolute garbage).  </li>
      <li>but I have found far better for the same price.</li>
      <li>So again, really only suitable for middle of the road skin tones.</li>
      <li>I gave up on highlighters for a good while until I saw this at Ulta one day and tried a little on the back of my hand and saw...</li>
      <li>I know it may seem pricey, but it is a high quality product that lasts.</li>
      <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
      <li>I bet this would be gorgeous on someone with clear skin that&#x27;s not too oily, but if you&#x27;re like me and you have very imperfect, somewhat acne-prone, oily skin, this will just make it look worse.  </li>
      <li>But other than that, it doesn&#x27;t really stick out as anything particularly special that I would repurchase to keep in my makeup routine for years on end</li>
      <li>True, it&#x27;s a very pretty shimmer, and it blends well if you use your fingers or a small stippling brush</li>
      <li>This is new to me--using a highlighter.  </li>
      <li>Since funds were limited and I wasn&#x27;t quite sure about all the strange names of the products.  </li>
      <li>For reference I have blue eyes, light skin, blonde hair on top with dark chestnut mixed throughout.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light and has a slight shimmer.  </li>
      <li>; when you&#x27;re wearing this it will not look like a natural glow as if you used a lighter foundation, but rather, that you have shiny make-up</li>
      <li>and if they switched the product to a liquid version similar to high beam or even girl meets pearl</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not tan, I&#x27;m super pale, so this can be flattering on all skin tones.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s not too bronze but also not pink.</li>
      <li>For a few bucks, it was certainly worth a try.  </li>
      <li>The cap is big and wonky and can easily be decapped if the stick gets tossed around in your bag...</li>
      <li>I currently use either Benefit&#x27;s high beam or Nars copacabana (liquid version) which are both tinted pink and give a dewy glow.</li>

<li> found out, sadly, that my special product(pink pencil/concealer/highlighter) was discontinued.</li>
<li> I also noticed that it only lasted a few hours before needing a touch up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> This one will probably last for a few years.</li>
<li> it&#x27;s worthless, they should have left it out and gave a little more product.</li>
<li> MUFE uplight (too dark), girl meets pearl (too pink,</li>
<li> AND it wasn&#x27;t pink!</li>
<li> hate raspberry smell), moon beam (too yellowish), Lorac (too white), Stila shimmer (too yellow), Nars orgasm color (too red-and the sticks have the rub-off-makeup effect), Josie Maran (too dark gold and thick), Smashbox artificial light (too dark or too light depending on which color you try)</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Beautiful champagne not glittery just a beautiful shimmer, blends nice i use a mac 130 brush to blend. I will buy again unless i find one better. I can&#x27;t give it 5 stars because of the sponge at the end it&#x27;s worthless, they should have left it out and gave a little more product.</li>
    <li> Love love love.  So pretty!!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this because I was dressing up as Snow White for Halloween and a make up tutorial for her recommended this product. I started using it with my regular daily make-up after that. I originally bought just a small sample size one and it lasted for a little less than a year. This one will probably last for a few years. I put it on my eyelids and my brow line for a highlight. It also holds my eyeshadow on when I apply the shadow over top if it wonderfully. I know it may seem pricey, but it is a high quality product that lasts. I recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> I have tried a couple highlighters at this point: UD: Urbanglow, Hard Candy: Glow All the Way, ELF: Gotta Glow and a couple others I can&#x27;t remember and all of them were too pink and too sparkley and looked horrible on my skin so over $100 poorer I gave up on highlighters for a good while until I saw this at Ulta one day and tried a little on the back of my hand and saw...NO SPARKLE.. AND it wasn&#x27;t pink! I cringed a little at the price tag, but I was frustrated and desperate to find a highlighter that would work for me so I bought it and tried it out the minute I got home and it blended in beautifully on my face, no pink, no obnoxious sparkles, just a nice natural looking shimmer, which I&#x27;ve been searching for for almost a year now. I will definitely buy this again unless I can find something better, but considering my lack of luck with highlighters I doubt I will.&lt;br /&gt;My only one complaint is, the useless sponge, they really should just do away with that and add more product like another reviewer said, which is why minus one star.&lt;br /&gt;PS: I&#x27;m not tan, I&#x27;m super pale, so this can be flattering on all skin tones.</li>
    <li> Disclaimer: I purchased this from ULTA, not Amazon but I wanted to review here anyways because I think reviews are useful and it&#x27;s the same product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first got this product I was in love with it but overtime the feeling has faded and I likely won&#x27;t repurchase when I finish it.  It&#x27;s a nice highlighter but I feel that it has a very make-up look to it; when you&#x27;re wearing this it will not look like a natural glow as if you used a lighter foundation, but rather, that you have shiny make-up on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to use it daily as a highlighter on the top of the apples of my cheeks and under my eyebrow but now I only use it under my brows during the day and very occasionally on my cheeks in the evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend applying it under or above a liquid foundation.  I used it with a tinted BB cream and liked the results. I do not recommend using it with a powder foundation because it results in a very cakey look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s fun to use and can help create a glowing look but I think there are better highlighters out there.</li>
    <li> Talk about highlighting made easy!  Love this stuff! I love Benefit Cosmetics; Benefit and MAC is all you find in my make-up bag. I was very weary to go ahead and buy the Watt&#x27;s Up, being afraid I wouldn&#x27;t really use it after spending $30 and that it might be \\&quot;too much\\&quot; make-up for my day-to-day routine. WRONG! So glad I just dove in a splurged. Worth every penny I paid! I use this everyday! This and Some-Kind-of-Gorgeous are my two favorite make-up items, EVER! I love that I do not need any sort of base foundation or powder, I can put it on with POREfessional, PosieTint &amp; BadGal Lash and have an awesome, easy, 5 minute make-up look without having to cake it on. When I do add it on with heavier make-up (Some-Kind-A-Gorgeous &amp; eyeshadow on as well), I love it even more! Take the plunge and turn the watt-age up on your make-up!! You will not regret!</li>
    <li> Everything you could want in a cosmetic, just what the name says WATT&#x27;S UP is definitely what&#x27;s up!!!! The right amount of shimmer without being overpowering.  Awesome product!</li>
    <li> I was nervous because it is kind of pricey, but it gave me that PERFECT dewey light look.  I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I like this stuff. It gives a nice sheen or glow to your skin. It&#x27;s very light and you don&#x27;t feel like you have pounds of it on.</li>
    <li> I have naturally bronze / tanned skin, and this compliments my complexion wonderfully by giving it a nice healthy glow without being too glittery or overdone. Definitely on my list of make-up essentials.</li>
    <li> I played with this for a while in a Sephora store. I&#x27;ve tried basically every highlighter imaginable. MUFE uplight (too dark), girl meets pearl (too pink, hate raspberry smell), moon beam (too yellowish), Lorac (too white), Stila shimmer (too yellow), Nars orgasm color (too red-and the sticks have the rub-off-makeup effect), Josie Maran (too dark gold and thick), Smashbox artificial light (too dark or too light depending on which color you try), I could go on. I love the champagne color of Watt&#x27;s up, it&#x27;s not too bronze but also not pink. My biggest complaint is that you glide it on over your makeup (for me that&#x27;s foundation and setting powder) so it ends up rubbing off what you already have on. I currently use either Benefit&#x27;s high beam or Nars copacabana (liquid version) which are both tinted pink and give a dewy glow. Since those products are liquid you can gently pat it on without compromising the makeup you&#x27;ve got on underneath. I&#x27;d like to use watt&#x27;s up during the summer and if they switched the product to a liquid version similar to high beam or even girl meets pearl I&#x27;d definitely get it. For reference I have blue eyes, light skin, blonde hair on top with dark chestnut mixed throughout.</li>
    <li> Nice glow.  Easy to use.  When it runs out, I&#x27;ll order again.  Easy to carry in your bag its so compact.</li>
    <li> This is a must have for everyone!  So simple to use and what a difference it makes.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t imagine leaving the house without having used this product.</li>
    <li> I bet this would be gorgeous on someone with clear skin that&#x27;s not too oily, but if you&#x27;re like me and you have very imperfect, somewhat acne-prone, oily skin, this will just make it look worse.  It made me look greasier, and way too &amp;#34;made up&amp;#34;, even though I used a very light hand.  All in all, I was not a fan.</li>
    <li> Benefit&#x27;s products are always incredibly exceptional. This item is awesome and does wonders to highlighting one&#x27;s cheek bones. I love it and use it every time I go out. I&#x27;ve shared the product with several of my friends and now we are all hooked! Its awesome!</li>
    <li> When I was introduced to the Benefit Line of Cosmetics.  My first purchase was this pencil.  Since funds were limited and I wasn&#x27;t quite sure about all the strange names of the products.  I was cautious ... very cautious!  I really wanted out, but not without that darn concealer/highlighter I \\&quot;had to have\\&quot; because, I had tried it and it seemed to give me a lift around my slightly saggy eyes.  I felt that If I had more time to play and maybe next time invest in another complimentary product, I&#x27;d be onto something!  For a few bucks, it was certainly worth a try.  I got hooked.  All the products since that I&#x27;ve gotten are top notch(and the compliments aren&#x27;t bad either!) But, I&#x27;ve got a problem that I need help to resolve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found out, sadly, that my special product(pink pencil/concealer/highlighter) was discontinued. No words can explain how I felt,,,And still feel!  Can anyone help?  I&#x27;d really like to know where I can purchase this item, if possible.[[ASIN:B000FBF58G Benefit Cosmetics Eye Bright Pencil]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks kindly for your help.

    <li> I love this product.  It&#x27;s light and has a slight shimmer.  I apply it with a small brush which makes it much easier.  The packaging with the little sponge makes no sense to me.</li>
    <li> I have very fair skin with neutral undertones. I got this after reading the great reviews and while it is a decent product, it is only suitable for medium/tan skin tones to olive. This is a good two - three shades darker than my natural skin tone and a highlighter shouldn&#x27;t be darker than you are. If it were not shimmery, I would honestly keep it and use it as a contouring color. Likewise, it is probably far too light for people with deep/dark skin tones. I ended up giving this to my cousin, who like me is half Mexican (but unlike me, looks it), and it looked like white streaks on her. So again, really only suitable for middle of the road skin tones. It would be great for them to include a fair, keep this as a medium, and add a darker shade as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the texture, I was a bit unimpressed. It isn&#x27;t bad, but not fantastic either. It almost feels a tad gritty, like the shimmer it in was not finely milled. I also noticed that it only lasted a few hours before needing a touch up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, this isn&#x27;t a terrible product at all but I have found far better for the same price. If you love benefit but have a fair skin tone, stick with the High Beam product.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, and it arrived in perfect brand new condition. The creamy consistency glides on like silk. An excellent highlighter.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used anything like this but I was very happy with this product.  It will last a long time too.  (Then again, I don&#x27;t wear makeup daily.)  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Have tried several highlighter products love this item. Packing is really cute and convienent with the blender sponge on one end. Color is pretty champagne color and blends really nicely.</li>
    <li> This is really my first highlighter purchase so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to per se however, I can&#x27;t say that I am blown away.  True, it&#x27;s a very pretty shimmer, and it blends well if you use your fingers or a small stippling brush (the sponge applicator it comes with is absolute garbage).  But other than that, it doesn&#x27;t really stick out as anything particularly special that I would repurchase to keep in my makeup routine for years on end (and I do have those sorts of HG products) especially at the price point of $30.  I would imagine that you find something a lot cheaper in the drugstore.  Also, the packaging although adorable, makes no sense.  The cap is big and wonky and can easily be decapped if the stick gets tossed around in your bag...and as mentioned before, the sponge applicator is small and useless.</li>
    <li> This is new to me--using a highlighter.  I love it!  I use it sparingly, but it works beautifully to highlight the best of your face.  I recommend this product, and I will be buying another one when this one is done.</li>
