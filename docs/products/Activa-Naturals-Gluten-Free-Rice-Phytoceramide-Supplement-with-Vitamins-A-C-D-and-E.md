      <li>This is the best phytoceramide at least for me as it is helped a great deal.</li>

      <li>so far so good</li>

      <li>This is the best phytoceramide at least for me as it is helping me.</li>
      <li>My skin does seem more radiant and clear!!!</li>

      <li>I really like this Phytoceramides Supplement.</li>
      <li>Much softer skin and clearer complexion.  </li>
      <li>This has been helping my skin so much.</li>
      <li>My hair really does seem to have gotten thicker though.</li>
      <li>I have noticed that the dark spots around my eyes have diminished and my face has more of a glow and moisture.</li>
      <li>I had a few minor questions and they were able to answer all of mine and my sisters questions very quickly and thoroughly.</li>
      <li>I used the wheat based on before that had the 350 mg in it, and I think it worked better, but for price and that they said rice needs just 40 mg per day, and it was less costly I tried this.  </li>

      <li>promising results on the long run.  </li>
      <li>Not hard to swallow, I have only used it for 2 weeks, but I am buying again</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t seen any major improvements to my skin as of yet</li>
      <li>My skin has not dried out at all since using this regularly.  </li>
      <li>beats internal therapy which offers deeper</li>
      <li>And while topical skin products offer a&lt;br /&gt;more direct approach to targeting skin issues,&lt;br /&gt;nothing</li>
      <li>This came way before it said it would come, so I&#x27;m extremely pleased by that as I am a little impatient when it comes to receiving things.&lt;br</li>
      <li>no more wrinkles when I smile.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> i love it ,will buy it again</li>
    <li> I have used this product before &amp; I really liked it. I tried it again &amp; still really like it! It has an excellent source of vitamins A,C,D,E &amp; ceramide-PCD. I take one in the morning with some food &amp; have been seeing a nice difference in my skin. It is natural &amp; gluten free. I have received this product at a discount for my honest review.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t taken it long enough to tell. .</li>
    <li> I wanted to wait until I tried this for a few days. I like this! My skin does seem more radiant and clear!!! Very nice quality, would order again!</li>
    <li> Great supplement with Vitamins A,C,D &amp;E also.  I don&#x27;t watch Dr Oz but evidently he recommends these.  I Googled this &amp; found interesting reading-nothing bad about Phytoceramides.  I also ran across the amount of water you should drink daily.  1 oz for every pound.  That adds up to 11--16oz. bottles for me.  I can barely get down 4 bottles.  Guess I need to lose weight-HaHa!</li>
    <li> Works great. Skin is starting to look brighter.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been taking these for almost 3 weeks&lt;br /&gt;and can already see the results.  Especially,&lt;br /&gt;on my hair which seems to be bouncier and stronger&lt;br /&gt;than before having had taken these.&lt;br /&gt;My skin seems firmer and more hydrated than&lt;br /&gt;usual.  And while topical skin products offer a&lt;br /&gt;more direct approach to targeting skin issues,&lt;br /&gt;nothing beats internal therapy which offers deeper&lt;br /&gt;more promising results on the long run.  Of course&lt;br /&gt;the more you use it the better the results but for&lt;br /&gt;2 weeks the results are pretty good.  As it is all about&lt;br /&gt;consistency.  My dark circles are even less noticeable&lt;br /&gt;than before I had started taking these.  So that&#x27;s a big&lt;br /&gt;plus for me :).  I highly recommend this product above&lt;br /&gt;other standard brands of phytoceramides due to it&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;superior delivery system and length of time required to&lt;br /&gt;see results.</li>
    <li> Not hard to swallow, I have only used it for 2 weeks, but I am buying again</li>
    <li> Almost finish my bottle and I love the way how my skin really smooths right now. I felt like I glow every single day since I&#x27;ve started taking this product.  I love it because it&#x27;s all naturals. Very easy to swallow too and no sighns of any smells in the capsules which I do love because some products have a strong smell that sometimes you cant take it!</li>
    <li> Do not know the results yet, but very good ordering experience</li>
    <li> My friend suggested this, as I used to have problems with dry skin. I was looking for something beyond the regular creams and I am really impressed with the results so far even though I have only used this for a couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> I believe it works,  have been taking for about a month now, will continue to use it now, I like it</li>
    <li> Started noticing results in a week, skin became softer ,nails and hair were growing rapidly. Would recommend. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> I love these pills, I was in a wow after I used this product the result was amazing I loved the way my face felt after using it I&#x27;m so pleased with this product and my recommendations are go for it, it&#x27;s definitely effective and worth the money!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know what good they&#x27;re doing but hope for the best.</li>
    <li> After a week I can done see a difference. Much softer skin and clearer complexion.  I&#x27;m excited to see what results are after a month.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product. I have noticed that the dark spots around my eyes have diminished and my face has more of a glow and moisture. I&#x27;ll be ordering this product again and again. This is the ultimate beauty haul for my skin. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love this product, it seems to have plumped my skin and has given an over all better look to my wrinkles.</li>
    <li> It works, but I would feel better if it was 350 mg like Dr. Oz said worked.  I used the wheat based on before that had the 350 mg in it, and I think it worked better, but for price and that they said rice needs just 40 mg per day, and it was less costly I tried this.  Can&#x27;t see any difference yet, but will continue using it to give it a fair try.</li>
    <li> These supplements got me sick and I returned them. I normally take Phytoceramides in addition to other vitamins. I just think that its because these capsules aren&#x27;t actually vegan.</li>
    <li> This is the best phytoceramide at least for me as it is helped a great deal. I am also very happy with the customer service. I had a few minor questions and they were able to answer all of mine and my sisters questions very quickly and thoroughly. I recommend these to all.</li>
    <li> I watched a TV program that showed the benefits of phytoceramides and then I did a ton of research and found that rice phytoceramides work better than wheat based phytoceramides. After doing the research I ended up buying this and found instant satisfaction with this product. It is working for me really great and will continue using it!</li>
    <li> Have noticed a change in the texture of my face and skin.  Seems to be more flexible and blemishes have faded.</li>
    <li> I really like this Phytoceramides Supplement. I just decided to give it a try in a whim. My hair really does seem to have gotten thicker though. My hair used to be thick and then got much thinner after having my kids. It seems to be coming back not after this supplement. My skin is also looking better and my skin tone more even. I will continue to take to see more results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27; m still taking it I&#x27;m on the first bottle and I&#x27;m looking to see results I like It I&#x27;m waiting patiently</li>
    <li> A couple of days back I watched the TV program by Dr Oz talking about phytoceramides. I started researching for a good option and then my friend told me that she is using this one and found to be a very good option. I bought it and have started using it. My first impression is that it is working and I think this is a great value for my money too. Overall I am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Im lucky to be able to review this product! Ive heard that Phytoceramides  is great for the skin and the hair. Ive only been taking it for a short time now. But I can feel a difference in my skin already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this item for the purpose of inspection and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> I have been taking for a few weeks and am starting to see results. My skin is softer and smoother and appears brighter. Very pleased with this product and the customer service.</li>
    <li> so far so good I haven&#x27;t seen any major improvements to my skin as of yet but I only started taking this for a couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> Gluten free AND phytoceramides! I&#x27;ve been looking and trying and sampling different products, and this one is IT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m naturally skeptical of supplements and so I look at them as a &amp;#34;test case&amp;#34; until I&#x27;ve tried them. Well, this stuff is worth the bang for the buck. The CS is wonderful (I love these guys) and the product is off the charts. Just love it.</li>
    <li> I have been taking this phytoceramide supplement for almost a month now and I love how great my skin feels.  It feels softer and more hydrated.  I really like this and will continue taking it!</li>
    <li> Beginning to see improvements on my skin, it feels very smooth and the sun spots has lighter tone</li>
    <li> Awesome product!! Love it!</li>
    <li> Just started taking them, I am sure they will work wonderfully!</li>
    <li> Thanks guys I would recommended activa skin to anyone out there to buy activa skin restoring it&#x27;s given you a nice complexion my skin is so pretty my friends at work ask me what am using and I told them  I going to order more before this bottle done . as I say again guys this is the best I ever used love it</li>
    <li> My doctor recommended this product to me a few months ago.  It is the first product that really works.  I have good skin to begin with, but I definitely see a difference on my cheeks: no more wrinkles when I smile.  My complexion shines now.&lt;br /&gt;I have recommended this supplement to a few of my friends.&lt;br /&gt;sugar, PA</li>
    <li> I think I look younger after a month of using it</li>
    <li> This is the best phytoceramide at least for me as it is helping me. I am also very happy with the customer service.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been over 2 months since buying this and my skin feels nourished and smooth.  I&#x27;ve been using this during the winter months here in PA during the cold windy dry months.  My skin has not dried out at all since using this regularly.  From the feet/knees/elbows up to my lips that are normally cracked now haven&#x27;t at all this winter.  I also have noticed the fine lines have disappeared around my lips and eyes.  Would highly recommend this to friends and family.</li>
    <li> I just recently started taking these and I must say that my face feels a little more hydrated, I will definitely purchase again if hydration and skin improvements continue.</li>
    <li> My skin now has what I&#x27;d like to think a healthier flow because of these pills. They are so easy to take and don&#x27;t leave a bad after taste. I was given these phytoceramides pills at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review. I definitely love how they have my skin feeling and looking. These are on my top daily supplements.</li>
    <li> Skin feels more hydrated in the cold winter. Like the ingredients.</li>
    <li> Phytoceramides are now a part of my daily routine, as well as my mother&#x27;s. My mother and I both suffer from eczema, and for years we have had horrible flare ups especially during the dry winter months. I started taking Phytoceramides about two months ago, and the difference in my skins overall health is amazing. While I don&#x27;t notice a huge difference in fine lines, the fact that I can take a hot shower, forget lotion, and still not itch tells me that this supplement is doing something! My mother has only been on this supplement for a couple of weeks, but she has noticed an improvement already in her skins health as well. This is a quality product, made in the USA with natural ingredients. If you are looking to help ease the torment of dry skin, this supplement taken once a day is the answer!</li>
    <li> This came way before it said it would come, so I&#x27;m extremely pleased by that as I am a little impatient when it comes to receiving things.&lt;br /&gt;As for the product itself, I think it&#x27;s truely wonderful! I suffer from very dry skin. It always hurts and cracks no matter what. This has been helping my skin so much. :D I&#x27;m truely grateful that it works because usually I&#x27;m a little leery of products like this.</li>
    <li> I did not see any changes on my face.</li>
    <li> Great Product.., I can see results in my hair.., skin.., and nails.., really makes my hair soft like a Teddy Bear and I&#x27;m  African American mixed</li>
    <li> At 54, everyone remarks about how beautiful my skin looks! Better than it did in my 20&#x27;s!</li>
