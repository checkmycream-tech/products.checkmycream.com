### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Perfect for a travel or purse size brush.  </li>
      <li>Greatest gadget for your purse!</li>
      <li>While these are a great gift...</li>
      <li>It was great for what I needed.</li>
      <li>This works great.  </li>
      <li>Good size to keep in the purse.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good portable brush</li>
      <li>I used to own one from Target that broke after 3 years of usage, this one arrived and after using it once, the rubber holding the brush bristles popped out.</li>
      <li>handy, holding up well.</li>
      <li>Oh well. :)</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t mind not being able to choose color, but I ordered 4</li>
      <li>A cute and inexpensive addition to my bag for windy days.</li>
      <li>Cheap and cheaply made.</li>
      <li>It works well so far and price was fair, I think.</li>
      <li>While not very manly, this is a great size for a travel brush.  </li>
      <li>This is a very handy device I can keep hidden in my purse.</li>
      <li>Out of all the fun colors...</li>
      <li>Keep this in mind if you are hoping for fun colors.</li>
      <li>My first one was from Target 4 years ago, 99 cents.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t see way to get the color we wanted, and the brush has less bristles than others, so it doesn&#x27;t brush as effectively.</li>
      <li>At this inexpensive price this is a handy little brush to keep in your go bag.</li>
      <li>But the product was very flimsy and the bristles kept falling out.</li>
      <li>Not really my style, but still feels like an okay quality travel brush and does the job.</li>
      <li>so I figured I needed a new one pretty soon.  </li>
      <li>The bristles easily collapse into a compact size little device that fits in my kit or pocket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>i ordered one for a friend who took a licking to an old one of mine.  </li>
      <li>Also the bristles do not have a soft covering</li>
      <li>So far still a delight.</li>
      <li>It folds up small and is easy to use.  </li>
      <li>Not a good product for hair that gets tangled easily.</li>

<li> I like it, but don&#x27;t know how long it will last.  </li>
<li> Not what was pictured, I received a pink oval shaped folding mirror/brush with a tiny mirror on the outside (???) surrounded by rhinestones.</li>
<li> so the short lifespan is expected.  </li>
<li> Even though it&#x27;s not expensive, I opted to ask for a refund due to the poor quality of the product.</li>
<li> Because Target has a very limited selection of color, I decided to do a search on Amazon.  </li>
<li> A bit flimpsy, so I am careful w/it.</li>
<li> The bristles fell off one after the other each time I used it.</li>
<li> we received all black.</li>
<li> but it broke after a few months of use.</li>
<li> and they were ALL BLACK!</li>
<li> I think I will go to Target and choose between ugly aqua green and dark purple.....</li>
<li> The round shape is awkward.</li>
<li> Poorly made.</li>
<li> random color will be sent.  </li>
<li> so it was quite painful on the scalp.</li>
<li> Very disappointed.  </li>

    <li> While these are a great gift...description states random color will be sent.  Out of all the fun colors...we received all black. Very disappointed.  Keep this in mind if you are hoping for fun colors.</li>
    <li> A cute and inexpensive addition to my bag for windy days.</li>
    <li> I always have one of these in my purse.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see way to get the color we wanted, and the brush has less bristles than others, so it doesn&#x27;t brush as effectively.</li>

    <li> While not very manly, this is a great size for a travel brush.  This works great.  The bristles easily collapse into a compact size little device that fits in my kit or pocket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know that the rubber diaphragm will eventually wear out.  They usually last a couple of years.  At this inexpensive price this is a handy little brush to keep in your go bag.</li>
    <li> Cheap and cheaply made. You get what you paid for.</li>
    <li> I like it, but don&#x27;t know how long it will last.  A bit flimpsy, so I am careful w/it. It works well so far and price was fair, I think.</li>

    <li> My first one was from Target 4 years ago, 99 cents. Good size to keep in the purse. After about 2 years the mirror broke off from the brush.  It is made of plastic so the short lifespan is expected.  So I went back to Target to get my second replacement and found the price increased to $1.47.  Now the 2nd one&#x27;s been almost 1.5 years so I figured I needed a new one pretty soon.  Because Target has a very limited selection of color, I decided to do a search on Amazon.  Big sticker shock!  $6 for this?  I think I will go to Target and choose between ugly aqua green and dark purple.....</li>
    <li> The bristles fell off one after the other each time I used it. Do NOT buy.</li>
    <li> This is a very handy device I can keep hidden in my purse. You never know  when you are going to need to brush your hair. Thank you.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good portable brush but it broke after a few months of use.</li>
