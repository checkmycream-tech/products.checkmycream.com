<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The colors are amazing, but the nail polish is on the cheap side. Peels off very easily. I use them for decoration with a clear coat over it and it helps it to hold up.</li>
    <li> These art polishes are fantastic!  My daughter and her friends still have fun creating new designs.  It has even helped one girl stop chewing her fingernails- she loves the sparkly colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this set highly.  Great selection of modern colors and finishes-some are sparkly, others are shimmery.</li>
    <li> This nail design set is pretty nice for the money; however the consistency of the polish seems to be off and it does not dry very well.... hours after using it I sometimes will still get smudges. But just for fooling around or doing thin lines this polish seems to do the trick. The only other complaint I have is that they put a card in the package asking you to review their products and sign up for their mailing list to receive free samples.... I did this with another product I ordered and never received anything... which was disappointing.</li>
    <li> Almost all the brushes are in poor conditions. The bristles are different in sizes and not thin enough. Waste of money</li>
    <li> I bought this nail art set for my wife and she enjoys decorating her nails at least 3 times a week. Will buy again in the near future.</li>
    <li> WIFE HAS BEEN USING THEM FOR HER NAILS  LOVES THE COLORS AND SO EASY TO USE WITH THE SMALL BRUSHES</li>
    <li> The brushes are horrible also the polish is to thin to do nail art. Its more like cheap thin nail polish that I would not buy again.</li>
    <li> I ordered these for my daughter for Christmas. I opened the box to check them, and I was not disappointed. I know my daughter is going to love these! She is always trying to come up with designs to put on her nails. It would be so expensive to buy a bunch of colors seperately, so this was perfect.</li>
    <li> I just tried these out and they are wonderful.  They are a great buy and I have many people who will enjoy what I can do with these. I look forward to doing a lot more business with Shany. LOVE LOVE LOVE THESE COLORS.  My granddaughter will have the most beautiful nails in her school as well as anyone else who will let me manicure them. The brushes were perfect and work very nicely. I can&#x27;t wait to add more of these beautiful colors to my collection. If you enjoy doing nail art like I do you must have these.</li>
    <li> I had tried a few nail art polishes in the past, they were okay.  When I ordered these they weren&#x27;t even the color choices I preferred.  (They are now back in stock, and def on my Christmas list.  These nail art polishes are amazing!  I am addicted to them.  I do my nails 2-3 times a week, and always do nail art.  I absolutely LOVE these, they are perfect consistency and brushes are perfect length!! Oh and despite not being my first color choice, I think I was wrong, these colors are amazing!!</li>
    <li> These are awesome! When I got them I bursted them open and started trying them out right away. They are so cool and now that there are websites with tutorials I can do so many un thinkable designs.</li>
    <li> most was dry out what was going on with this&lt;br /&gt;It was a total rip off dont buy from them</li>
    <li> Got my polish and only one red had a small leak where a few drops came out.  There were also no yellow colors at all.  Only one gold with glitter that hardly resembles yellow (more of a brownish).  All of them have fine detail brush (striper) tips since this is a NAIL ART SET!  Other than the lack of yellow, this is an amazing deal and I will buy a few more SHANY products to see what else is good.  Now I just gotta hit Utube and check out professionalDQ to learn how to do the crazy unicorn stuff she does on her nails!  Unicorn germs!</li>
    <li> I have used this set many different brand polishes. They work well with almost all brands. Definitely one of my favorite sets!</li>
    <li> Beautiful colors and so many bottles you get- but all the brushes that brush the paint on are different lengths and there aren&#x27;t very many making it hard to accurately paint your nails. Would be a great product if they didn&#x27;t take a cheap way out of making the brush.</li>
    <li> The color variety is nice, but the paint chips off too easily. Some of the brushes were broken when it first arrived... My polish never lasts more than a couple days, anyways, but I like to have some good paint... This is not the BEST paint, but it is okay... Some are really runny while others are kind of chunky, but as I said before - it&#x27;s okay...</li>
    <li> The polish set  is a great value IF your set doesn&#x27;t come with repeats! I didn&#x27;t realized until I broke one of the bottles. I was kind of bummed out that I broke the bottle, but then I look over the set and I was like WAIT I have a back up color!! Then I realized another color had a \\&quot;back up\\&quot; then another color. So um yeah not happy with this one to say the least. O.o</li>
    <li> What a great set of polishes, since the brush is very fine you don&#x27;t have to have separate brushes to &amp;#34;paint&amp;#34; decos on your nails.  They hold up great and the selection of colors is outstanding!</li>
    <li> The colors are awesome, good variety. My only complaint is that half of the nail polish brushes have stray strands, which isn&#x27;t good for nail art. I just took nail clippers and cut the end of the brushes just enough to make them straight. Works fine now. It&#x27;s fun and I&#x27;m finding tons of &amp;#34;how to&amp;#34; videos online showing how to do super cool nail art designs.</li>
    <li> I gave this as a gift to a 12 year old, so I can&#x27;t speak to how high quality the set is.  I can tell you that she loved all the color options and says that the brushes are the perfect shape and size to create lots of designs.  She&#x27;s been giving everyone manicures now!</li>
    <li> I love their design kits. You get so many colors and so many odd colors that you can&#x27;t really find anywhere else for nail art. Pair this up with their 24 nail polish set and you have endless possibilities for designs.</li>
    <li> i love this product it makes painting my nails easy! its clear so i can see whats left in it and i love showing it off to other people i absolutely was bouncing up and down when the mail man came saying package for me! yayayay i love these polishes!</li>
    <li> When I first recieved it, I was so so stunned and amazed by the shiny colors and the colors looks very cute on me. These nail polishes reminded of the gel nail polishes. I can just let the color air dry naturally instead of using a uv lamp. Anyways I really loved this product!</li>
    <li> I ordered the Shany Cosmetics Nail Art set about two weeks ago.. I must say that the shipping was far better than I could of hoped for.  I ordered on a Wednesday night, and received the Nail Art set on a Friday.  None of my polishes were busted or leaking anywhere, the packaging was completely intact.. So no problems there.  Here is where my issues started..  The colors, while beautiful were not as vivid as I had expected, but this was forgiveable since I could just apply another coat.  The brushes that are included are not my favorite style.  Sure these might be wonderful for someone who likes to make little lines and what not, but for the average user these style of brushes just makes thing take way longer than they should.  If I am going to order another set from Shany I am going to make sure to order some sort of bigger brush.  So so far most of the issues I have mentioned are rather easy to fix, just annoying.  But there is also the fact that the paint doesn&#x27;t last as long as I&#x27;m used to from other companies.  Within a day, my paint had already began to peel off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were good qualities as well.  There are a ton of colors to experiment with, as well as the ability to make patterns and other fun little designs.  The sparkle colors are amazing and seem to actually last longer than the solids did. This set will work wonderfully for a person who likes to play with colors on a regular basis, but for someone who wants to keep a color on for more than a day or two without any chipping or peeling might want to invest in a good clear top coat, otherwise it just won&#x27;t last nearly as long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With all that is said I&#x27;m still going to give a 4/5, simples because the colors are lovely and there are just so many of them to experiment with.</li>
    <li> This 24 set of nail art polishes is fabulous. You get such pretty colors to choose from, therefore giving you that many more nail designs you can create!</li>
    <li> The sheer number of nail bottles will mean countless hours of fun experimenting with different designs, and colors.  Now, women want to have different styles and different designs on their finger, and toe nails, because they want to create a different look for different days.  If I was going to do an in-home manicure, and/or pedicure, this is the product that I would get.</li>
    <li> this set is so pretty and glittery! and some of the colors for the nail art set is great for fall! very dark colors for fall I love them! they work awesome! get themmm!</li>
    <li> There are so many colors to choose from you can create any look you want. These are perfect for the beginner and the expert because they are so precise and easy to paint with but they are also great for painting detail on such a small surface. They are also chip resistant.</li>
    <li> Our daughters love this nail art set. They change their nails often, making different designs and patterns each time. Great set with a lot of colors. Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> These nail art were perfect to draw on my nails! I created stars, lines, strokes, and many more! They were very easy to use! It After applying the polish, it dried up very quickly! so that&#x27;s good! :)</li>
    <li> It comes with some many different colors, you could do a lot of designs with it because of the thin brush. The colors are great.</li>
    <li> These come well packaged in a plastic divider keeping each polish upright and separate and was shrink wrapped.  Needless to say they arrived in tact and unbroken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got these for a gift and every polish is a different color, so no duplicates.  They are bright and shiny and look to be of good quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing is these are about 1/2 the size of a regular nail polish so be advised they are smaller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since they are a gift, I&#x27;ll have to report back on how well they work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m pleased, but I gave 4 stars for them not putting the size on in the description.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vidimo Se!</li>
    <li> This made a wonderful gift for a burgeoning teen&#x27;s birthday.  The items are attractive and the box sturdy enough to last a while.  The colors are vibrant and the metallics and glitter polishes are very vivid without being lurid or overdone.  It was so affordable and brought out a lot of smiles.  We bought a lovely zipper pouch from Blue Q (their Flotsam and Jetsam design) and it was roomy enough to hold all of these safely and still had plenty of room.  The bright colors really made the beauty of these various nail colors shine.  Only complaint: the glitter polish was not smooth and didn&#x27;t spread well, and therefore the brushes for those were too cheap to do the job necessary for spreading them.  However, for price, it is a great deal.  These are not full-sized bottles, but have plenty enough for a decent usage without wasting a lot of nail polish that eventually goes in the garbage.  The gold was a big hit, as well as the red glitter (which we decided was a Dorothy&#x27;s Ruby Red Slipper polish).  A new user may pick this away easily, so it is not the longest-lasting (not as strong as a good Sally Hansen)...but it is a good overall set.</li>
    <li> these nail art Polishes Are very Nice And Glittery and with dark and Some Neon Colors and the packageing was just right nothing was Broken and they work just fine</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve done my nails basically every night after getting this. It&#x27;s so much fun. There&#x27;s so many colors. This def exceeds my expectations</li>
    <li> I purchased for my daughter, and she loves the multitude of colors. Also it comes in a handy holder, to keep them all together, that was nice.</li>
    <li> Though all the colours seems nice , this set dosen&#x27;t have white and yellow colour in it.. some of the colurs looks same like there r same colour with shimmer, and glitters in it .. and many of the nailpaint caps r not opening ,, i hv tried again nd again but they r not ready to open , wen i recieved the order there was 1 bottle that was leaking.. i wanted to replace the set but amazon dont allow that .. so its not a good deal for me.</li>
    <li> I got this as a present, but I&#x27;m now considering getting one for myself! The package arrived early, the packaging is great, the bottles are perfect, the colors are absolutely beautiful, and I can&#x27;t wait to see them applied. I&#x27;m very pleasantly surprised. :D</li>
    <li> I got this as a birthday/early Mother&#x27;s day gift and my mother absolutely loves them. There are 24 great colors, some with sparkles, which she loved, and some awesome regular colors. They are very professional and came in the mail within just a few days! Definitely recommended!</li>
    <li> I didnt get any repeat color and I use them all the time. Some of the colors need a second coat but I feel like that is normal for light colors.</li>
    <li> the only real complaint i have for these is that some of the paint itself is this and not very visable, mostly just the glitter ones but the green and the lightest blue are just too liquidy. and some of the brushes are a little wider than i would prefer but i fixed that with some mini sisors and the only other downside is that when you first open them they smell really strong so as a tip i would suggest airing them out a tiny bit at first, the smell just made my tummy a little upset from using them all the minute i got them. (so be a patient unlike me) the colors are great, some of them are very very pretty and for the cost i definantly got my moneys worth</li>
    <li> Not sure why some people complain about the narrow brushes. These are for nail art and it&#x27;s the whole reason I ordered them. Making stripes or french tips is a breeze with these! The colors are wonderful and I have been able to pick one of these to compliment every regular polish I have so far. They are packaged really well in a plastic tray and nothing came damaged or leaking or anything like that other set being sold on Amazon. I&#x27;m so glad I got these and if I find another set with all different colors I would buy it as well.</li>
    <li> These Nail Art polishes are so great and so many colors to choose from. You could have a different color combination every day if you wanted to. The price of them makes them a measley dollar a piece. They case they come in makes them look so neat and tidey.</li>
    <li> these were a gift to my daughter for Christmas. she is having so much fun making different designs on her nails!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughters for Christmas and they loved it... lots of bright colors and sparkles... they were in love right then. The quality was great, easy to apply and long lasting. No repeats here, and I found the color to go on much thicker than comparably priced polishes that I&#x27;ve bought them.</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift for my sister who loves to do nails.  While she does love it, one of them did spill over in the package.  All in all she truly does like it.</li>
    <li> the colors were beutiful, althogh they dried super slow. my mom loves the colors too, and wondered if maybe they could sell them individually? some of the colors i dont really use, like brown and orange, so the only reasons i gave a four instead of five is it dries super slow, and i only want a few of the colors.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a birthday present, so did not try the product personally, but the assortment provided was nice.</li>
    <li> i love the colors and the brush style is nice. you can either paint your whole nail or just do designs. soo many pretty colors!! thank you!</li>
    <li> I knew that the brushes were very skinny I thought I could find other brushes, the brushes I got work however it is very hard to clean the finger nail polish off the brush to reuse the brush on another color. Also I painted my girls nails and my nieces nails and by the next day the polish was chipping off and looked horrible. Was not a good purchase.</li>
    <li> Cheap nailpolish. I bought this for Christmas for my 12 year old daughter because I liked the variety of colors. This polish is thin and cheap. Also, it it shipped from China (and made in china - but what else is new), so you cannot return for a refund.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B00910ZHJE SHANY Cosmetics Nail Art Set, 24 Count]]Received My Shany Nail Art Set..Just Awesome!!!The Set looks Amazing!!I like the variety of colors in this nail polish set, and i will give 4 stars....</li>
    <li> I got this as an early Mother&#x27;s Day gift from a friend of mine, along with some other self-care items, and I absolutely love the quality of this nail polish! The price is perfect and I love having such a wide variety of colors! Thanks for this product!</li>
    <li> Great colors and quick drying.  The brushes are very small, perfect for drawing on the nails!  Gave these away as party favors for teenage girls who thought they were fabulous, there were colors to make everyone happy!</li>
    <li> I really love this product. I wanted some nail art colors/ \\&quot;pens\\&quot;. But they seemed a little crazy for me wanting almost all the colors. This helped without my breaking my wallet,lol. They are very pigmented and gorgeous color. I am a cosmetology student and have worked with professional polish, These are great. As for anyone who ever complains about shany.You are wrong, if you use nail polish base and quality top coat you will have no problem with getting these to last like any other polish needs too!  I love the display for these too, its easy to stay organized. This is the third product I&#x27;ve tried from Shany,and I still have not been disappointed. I highly recommend this cosmetic brand, especially these nail art set :)</li>
    <li> This is extremely easy to work with, we started doing our own nail art and this set makes professional results even for me with no training I just watched videos online</li>
    <li> LEFT OUT ON FRONT YARD IN THE RAIN DID NOT RING DOOR BELL OR EVEN LET ME KNOW IT WAS THERE HAD TO DRY EVERY THING AND DRY IT OFF I WAS VERY UPSET</li>
    <li> These paints seem to be very watery. Takes several coats to show up on nails. This was a disappointment and was a gift.</li>
    <li> These are for fine detail decorating your nails. There are small fine brushes. The colors are great, and fun for drawing on your nails.</li>
    <li> I got these for my grand daughter, she loves them. The colors are very pretty and they come in a good size, the big bottles usually just dry up since she sometimes forgets to screw the lid back on.</li>
    <li> Great quantity and quality for the price. They may have gone a bit overboard with the packing tape but it did arrive unharmed.</li>
    <li> Buyit for my wife and she love it, great product and cheap. This in particular has quite a variety of colors so you can combine with everything is well with my wife, thank you very much!</li>
    <li> The colors are really nice and I like having a variety to choose from! Recommend it to anyone that&#x27;s into doing nails!</li>
    <li> Bright Happy Colors! These are great since the drab Fall colors are coming! What a great set of polishes to have. You can create many good designs with this set. A mush have.</li>
    <li> Love all the colors!!! Love the racks... Delivery was on time!!!! I recommend ShanyCosmetics to everyone, first experience with them but not the last!!</li>
    <li> My 14 year old is very creative. This set is perfect for her. She&#x27;s done some amazing things on her nails!</li>
    <li> I liked a lot this product, Thanks for all and for a faster shippment. I really will by with you other product.</li>
    <li> I loved this product! I received it for christmas and just love the colors that came in the kit. No duplicates and very bright vibrant colors. will most definately be purchasing more shany products!</li>
    <li> 24 nail art colors for 24 dollars is amazing! The colors are so pretty as they always are from Shany cosmetics!</li>
    <li> These polishes are better than any name brand I&#x27;ve used. The price is such a steal and you get so many colors! I haven&#x27;t noticed any chipping yet, it&#x27;s been a few days so we&#x27;ll see. The colors are all super pretty and great variety. Just a warning to some people, I would probably buy a nail brush or clean an old nail polish applicator. The applicators on these are the long skinny ones (not a problem for me, I expected them to be like that since it said nail art set) for designs, so if you&#x27;re wanting a thicker applicator, you&#x27;ll have to get a separate one otherwise it will take you about 5-6 strokes to cover one nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, very pretty colors ranging from glittery to pearl to flat. And they come in their own organizing stand. Love it.</li>
    <li> Atleast this one is perfect compare to the other product I ordered from Shany. This is not dry like the other product. This came to me perfectly, I am using it for nail art. I am using it sometimes for just regular nail polish but I have to use another brush for the brush in it is very thin just right for nail art.</li>
    <li> This is an ovepriced set of the most horrible nail polish I have ever used!  Brushes are ultra long and skinny so that you can only apply a very thin line before re-dipping.  It does not go on smoothly. The polish doesn&#x27;t want to dry, smears, sloughs off and mounds up even a couple of hours after application.  Awful stuff...don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Great nail art set I would HIGHLY recommend This set! I was worried that the bottles would be small because you get so many for such a good price, but they are full sized. And I was also worried that the quality of the nail polish was going to suck. But Its actually VERY nice.</li>
    <li> Reason for only three stars was due the length of time it takes for the polish to dry.  Took almost a day to dry and the brushes are way to long, had to cut down the brush.</li>
    <li> My daughter is a little fashionista and loves to get creative painting her nails.  I was looking for a variety of polishes, but didn&#x27;t have a lot of money to spend.  The price was great, but the quality of the polish and the packaging exceeded my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We received the package within a few days (free shipping!) and the polishes were boxed perfectly for wrapping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue we had was not having enough time to use every color at our first sitting!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was my first experience with Shany products and I am a fan.  I will be looking for Shany next time I shop for my daughter!  Thank you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00910ZHJE SHANY Cosmetics Nail Art Set, 24 Count]]</li>
    <li> Since I needed to replace my decades-old nail polishes and also wanted to start dabbling with some nail art ideas, I ordered this Shany nail art set.  I had read the reviews here plus I watched numerous YT video reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received my order a few days ago, and I have now tried several of the colors.  I am really impressed by the quality of the polishes, especially for such a low price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received Nail Art Set #2 even though I thought I was ordering set #1.  So I didn&#x27;t get some of the colors I was expecting.  But set #2 that I received is really beautiful as well.  Right now I have colors #38 and #29 on my nails.  I painted my tips and dots with #38, a deep vibrant purple, followed by an overlay of #29, clear with purple glitter.  It&#x27;s simply gorgeous.  So far, every polish I have tried has applied smoothly.  Most are fast-drying, but I have noticed a few that take a bit longer to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shany does not give their polishes names, only numbers.  But I named them myself.  Here&#x27;s a list of the colors you&#x27;ll receive with set #2:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;25 Clear with purple glitter&lt;br /&gt;26 Clear with reddish orange glitter&lt;br /&gt;27 Clear with bronze glitter&lt;br /&gt;28 Clear with gold glitter&lt;br /&gt;29 Clear with dark purple glitter&lt;br /&gt;30 Clear with light blue glitter&lt;br /&gt;31 Clear with fuschia glitter&lt;br /&gt;32 Blue-green&lt;br /&gt;33 Lavendar&lt;br /&gt;34 Hot pink&lt;br /&gt;35 Orange&lt;br /&gt;36 Shimmering red&lt;br /&gt;37 Shimmering bronze&lt;br /&gt;38 Dark purple&lt;br /&gt;39 Red&lt;br /&gt;40 Bright green&lt;br /&gt;41 Shimmering copper&lt;br /&gt;42 Shimmering bronze&lt;br /&gt;43 Shimmering gold&lt;br /&gt;44 Brown&lt;br /&gt;45 Shimmering lavendar&lt;br /&gt;46 Olive-toned gold&lt;br /&gt;47 Silver&lt;br /&gt;48 Light blue&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there&#x27;s a negative to this set, it&#x27;s the brushes.  They are uneven.  I trimmed the brushes with my small manicure scissors, and now they work perfectly.  Shany needs to fix this, but this is still a great buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;March 10, 2013 Update:  I still love this set, but I feel that I must place a warning to those with allergies or respiratory problems.  These polishes have extremely potent vapors.  I loved this set so much, I went ahead and ordered 2 more polish collections from Shany.  And now I will be giving all of them away to friends and relatives.  I just cannot tolerate the chemical fumes (causing headaches and allergic reactions).  But ... if you don&#x27;t have any health issues and can possibly vent the room a little, I still recommend them.  The colors are stunning, so so beautiful.  And the application is a breeze.o those with allergies or respiratory problems.  These polishes have extremely potent vapors.

    <li> I really love the colors of the nail polish. It came in a nice sturdy box that can be left in for storage. Shipping was super, super fast. But, the nail polish is too thick and does not dry properly. I used the nail polish once and did not like how it felt. never used it again until this week 10/01/13 just to try it and it felt the same way.. waste of my money.. sad because when you look at the product it looks amazing but, the nail polish it self I was NOT happy with.</li>
    <li> these show up real nice on unpainted nails or over paint.  they have nice long thin brushes making &amp;#34;art&amp;#34; easier. they dry really fast - reccomend :)</li>
    <li> I rated this 5 stars because it its perfect for nail polish designs. you dont have to be creative to make a great look with these polishes. the colors were great. bright colors and glittery colors. i would totally reccomend this to anyone who wants a good set of nail art polishes.</li>
    <li> I bought these on a whim, and now I&#x27;m hooked on Shany products. These work great for detailed nail art or just as a basic polish. They also come with a small display which makes storing them that much easier!</li>
    <li> Nail Art is the all the rave right now and with this set you will be looking like a pro in no time. The colors are magnificent and the brushes are great quality which means the results will be perfect everytime!</li>
    <li> These nail art were perfect to draw on my nails! I created stars, lines, strokes, and many more! They were very easy to use! It After applying the polish, it dried up very quickly! so that&#x27;s good! :)</li>
