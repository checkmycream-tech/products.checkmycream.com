      <li>Does not wear off, you won&#x27;t have to go put in more before each meal.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad to have discovered it --</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used several adhesives before but Secure seems to be the best ever!  </li>
      <li>I got on amazon pronto and bought more Secure,</li>
      <li>Nothing holds the bottom but there is more cushion with the Secure in as it doesn&#x27;t wash away with saliva.</li>
      <li>It is also easy to take my dentures out.</li>
      <li>But, on the plus side, Secure held my dentures securely for more than 12 hours.</li>
      <li>I got the Secure for sensitive gums and I am completely happy with this product and it&#x27;s effectiveness.</li>
      <li>Lasts about a minute, and then it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
      <li>great product, different from fixodent, it does not dissolve easily than fixodent</li>
      <li>This denture adhesive woks better than any OTC products, Thanks!!</li>
      <li>My mouth was inflamed and had two huge sores from it.  </li>
      <li>I use Secure to hold my dentures in place while eating.</li>
      <li>Awesome stuff, have trouble with my bottoms.</li>
      <li>Secure doesnt leave this taste and doesnt affect taste of food or drink either.</li>
      <li>I was told about secure by my dentist</li>
      <li>Easy to remove plates &amp; clean.</li>
      <li>Also soothing to the gums, and easy to clean.</li>
      <li>I tried Secure without the Aloe and Myrrh but it didnt work.</li>
      <li>I choose this adhesive because of the great reviews regarding lasting hold.  </li>
      <li>what your are not getting with secure is a stomach full of chemicals.</li>
      <li>It was delivered really quickly and in secure packaging.</li>
      <li>One thing I didn&#x27;t like was the time it took to clean my mouth after removing my dentures at night.</li>
      <li>This adhesive is great for loose dentures.  </li>
      <li>good for lower dentures especially</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t imagine what ingredient could produce this kind of irritation as it is even the one supposedly designed for sensitive gums.</li>
      <li>It is true it works.</li>
      <li>and it smelled and tasted like super glue.....</li>
      <li>It lasted for 20 hrs the first time we tried it!</li>
      <li>when you need to clean your dentures soak for 15 minutes in hot water and it brushes away under running water, no problem.  </li>
      <li>I swear, it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
      <li>I also had no problem removing my dentures after I swished warm water around in my mouth (several times.)  </li>
      <li>The hold was good, but the aftermath was not pretty.</li>
      <li>Fixodent works great too but has chemical taste and makes my stomach feel raw -chemicals</li>
      <li>Not any better than they rest and its a smaller tube.</li>
      <li>The holding power helps my not-so-well fitting upper denture stay</li>
      <li>when you first put it in, it stings.  </li>
      <li>The all natural properties of Secure agree with my body and health.</li>
      <li>What a dissapointment...not any better than regular stuff with no taste...</li>
      <li>I removed Secure from my dentures with warm water and a toothbrush and then soaked them in my usual denture cleaner (Fixodent antibacterial denture cleaner plus scope tablets.)  </li>
      <li>I had previously used Fixodent Free &amp; feel this is a better product.</li>
      <li>They mentioned a tingling feeling which seemed pretty intense to me.</li>
      <li>Purposely did not eat or drink hot food or  liquids.&lt;br /&gt;However, it is better than 2 other brands</li>
      <li>Secure worked very well on upper and lower dentures.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve ever found that really, really works.  </li>
      <li>SO FAST</li>
      <li>forgot about all that until recently when I ran out of Secure.</li>
      <li>Purchased this to help hold in a partial plate that sits over the top of a couple of teeth.</li>
      <li>Secure is the only adhesive I can use without my mouth hurting.</li>
      <li>Far superior to any other similar product I have used.</li>
      <li>I picked up some super polygrip extra care adhesive at the drug store.</li>
      <li>So far Secure Denture Cream is the only denture adhesive that works for me</li>
      <li>As long as the dentures and your gums are clean and DRY the secure adhesive works all day for me.</li>
      <li>I highly highly recommend.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love it ordered 2 more tubes</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product... I am ordering more soon.</li>
    <li> Perhaps it works better with people with tighter fitting dentures but it didn&#x27;t work well with mine at all.  Came loose immediately after I started eating.</li>
    <li> So far this adhesive is living up to its fact, the only problem is this product is not waterproof and its last about 4 hour while eating and drinking water,,, so far I like this product####</li>
    <li> It is non-toxic.  Nobody wants to lose their teeth; other health complications gave me no choice.  This product holds the denture in place while my gums are healing and changing.  Nothing bad to say about this product.</li>
    <li> This adhesive is one of the better ones. Most of them are useless when it comes to holding lower dentures, but this one lasts long enough to get through a meal.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several adhesives before but Secure seems to be the best ever!  I have very sensitive gums due to medication conditions and the ingredients in this product is very soothing.  I would recommend this to all denture wearers!</li>
    <li> Read alot of reviews for this after the zinc scare, desperate to find something as good as fixodent, bought a tube had to wait 2 weeks for it to arrive. What a dissapointment...not any better than regular stuff with no taste...I am still trying to get it off my dentures, just a big mess. Yes I did follow instructions to the letter. It made my bottom dentures hurt and I could hardly even eat. Had to chuck it and go to poli</li>
    <li> This is the best denture adhesive I have ever used. The holding power helps my not-so-well fitting upper denture stay put.&lt;br /&gt;Aside from the holding power, for me there is another reason why I love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;I noticed before I found Secure, when I was using Polygrip or other brands, that I felt a weird all-over sick feeling all the time that I didnt understand. I also seemed to have numbness and almost a nerve damage problem going unexplained. After I started using Secure, the ill feelings vanished.&lt;br /&gt;I forgot about all that until recently when I ran out of Secure. I picked up some super polygrip extra care adhesive at the drug store. ( because I cannot buy Secure locally, just on internet ) within 2 days I started feeling sick again. I got on amazon pronto and bought more Secure, because I know for me, it makes a difference in how I feel over all health wise. This is my experience. The all natural properties of Secure agree with my body and health.</li>
    <li> WORKS GREAT!!! will order again</li>
    <li> I have been wearing dentures for almost a year now and I&#x27;ve tried everything I could possibly get my hands on. This is by far the worst product I ever tried. All the other products at least hold my top in all day,it&#x27;s the bottom part that I can&#x27;t seem to stay put. This product lasts for about 6 hours and that&#x27;s if you don&#x27;t eat. When you eat, it breaks lose! Is there anything out there that could help me? I don&#x27;t care what the cost is....I&#x27;m determined. It&#x27;s driving me crazy!!!</li>
    <li> It is true it works. I opened tube and used adhesive. I ate peanuts, pizza and doritos and my dentured did not move. I would pay 20 a tube for this product. I have my eating life back. No taste. Lookks like all the other adhesives but it is not. It is also easy to take my dentures out. It just blows my mind how great this stuff is. I just hit lotto. I am doing chicken wings tonight.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best dental adhesive I have ever used!!!</li>
    <li> Sent to my mother as a gift.  She seemed to find the product worked well, however it did leave the inside of her dentures a little rough and she had to get them smoothed out</li>
    <li> I have used this product before.  This is a re-order and I find this adhesive works better then any others I have tried.</li>
    <li> Not any better than what you can buy at walmart</li>
    <li> Love this! I am new to Dentures. Upper &amp; lower . I am getting about 10 to 12 hour hold . Will buy again!!!!</li>
    <li> really holds tight. good for lower dentures especially</li>
    <li> I think I&#x27;ve reviewed this twice now, but:  this is the only denture adhesive I&#x27;ve ever found that really, really works.  Does not wear off, you won&#x27;t have to go put in more before each meal.  It last, for me anyway, a minimum of 24 hours.  I&#x27;m so glad to have discovered it -- all the other kinds that I&#x27;ve tried were exactly the same.  They don&#x27;t survive hot liquids, and all are useless after a couple of hours.&lt;br /&gt;Not this one.  It holds fiercely!  Note:  when you first put it in, it stings.  The sting is not mild.  It makes my eyes water.  I have no idea why, but I just wait it out.  Lasts about a minute, and then it&#x27;s fine.  So be prepared.  I swear, it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
    <li> Not any better than they rest and its a smaller tube.</li>
    <li> Does the same thing as other adhesives in that when you eat and drink it dissolves....</li>
    <li> My uncle said it was so tight, had problems getting teeth out to clean.</li>
    <li> never stopped oozing from dentures</li>
    <li> This denture adhesive is supposed to not come out like other adhesives but lasted no longer than Super polygrip , It may not be water soluble but it doesn&#x27;t stand up to saliva , Wouldn&#x27;t mind the expense if it actually worked</li>
    <li> I waited about 35  min. . before eating.  Lower denture loosened before end of meal.  Purposely did not eat or drink hot food or  liquids.&lt;br /&gt;However, it is better than 2 other brands I tried.&lt;br /&gt; L. .Flynn</li>
    <li> Secure is the only adhesive I can use without my mouth hurting. Shipped in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> Great! Beats any other adhesive!</li>
    <li> My mother loves it. It lasted for 20 hrs the first time we tried it! She has started smiling and talking more, she can bite and chew. I believe it has given her back quite a bit of self esteem. Remember to put it on correctly - a thin, even layer on the denture, all surfaces must be clean and dry. You&#x27;ll find good advices on youtube and in the instructions for use which comes along with the product.</li>
    <li> This one is the best for sore gums - works perfect - It&#x27;s just what I needed - the others weren&#x27;t working and my mouth was always sore from the rubbing.  I highly highly recommend.</li>
    <li> My husband said it did not work as well as Fixodent, the one he had been using.  He did not use it.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t as good as I thought it would be and it smelled and tasted like super glue.....won&#x27;t purchase again in the future</li>
    <li> Incredible product that delivers as stated! After using other products that broke down after eating/drinking I have finally found something that DOESNT dissolve! I couldn&#x27;t be more happy and impressed and I highly suggest this product to others! Without a doubt there is nothing better!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t have a good hold!</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed that the Secure Denture Adhesive did not work for me at all. I wasted my money and I will not recommend this product to anyone and I will not waste my money on this product again..</li>
    <li> Bought for my mother, recommended by Aspen Dental</li>
    <li> This works wonderfully!  I&#x27;m so grateful to find something Free of Toxins!!!</li>
    <li> it cost  more than my reg. and does not last hold as long and it burns my gums</li>
    <li> It isn&#x27;t waterproof. Not any different than the regular secure adhesive. But I do like the regular one and this one as well, just not better. I am allergic to all the other brands that are sold in stores and I can&#x27;t use them. But this one does not give me any allergic reactions.</li>
    <li> Give this five stars as Ive bought it before and loved it over other brands Ive bought just this purchase seemed a little on the old, outdated side if thats possible.</li>
    <li> very good product. works better than anything else i&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Secure is by far the best dental adhesive that I have found. I use either Prosoft or DIY (which doesn&#x27;t leave the nasty taste in your mouth that Prosoft does) professional soft reline kit to reline both my top and bottom plates.  Because my gums are sensitive I need the soft liner to add a cushion between the dentures and my gums.  Without the soft liner I can not wear them.  The dentures hurt!  I use Secure to hold my dentures in place while eating. For the first time since I have had my dentures (7 years) I can finally eat without food particles getting underneath my plates causing pain and irritation or my lower plate lifting and moving all around. I got the Secure for sensitive gums and I am completely happy with this product and it&#x27;s effectiveness. I&#x27;ve had no problems with burning or irritated gums as others have stated they have and I have very sensitive gums.  I also had no problem removing my dentures after I swished warm water around in my mouth (several times.)  I removed Secure from my dentures with warm water and a toothbrush and then soaked them in my usual denture cleaner (Fixodent antibacterial denture cleaner plus scope tablets.)  I will no longer use anything else and trust me I&#x27;ve tried everything.  This stuff is awesome!</li>
    <li> For me, it didn&#x27;t do anything it said it would do.  Plus, after a couple of hours, the medicinal flavor gagged me badly.  Effergrip zinc free was spectacular... not this stuff.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST denture adhesive product I&#x27;ve found. It holds much longer and food particles don&#x27;t get under partial plates, upper &amp; lower. Easy to remove plates &amp; clean. I had previously used Fixodent Free &amp; feel this is a better product.</li>
    <li> Good and if all one gets is the same as the standard shelf brands provide for less than satisfactory hold...what your are not getting with secure is a stomach full of chemicals. Secure does not hold my bottom denture better than store due to my bones having been cut in half after 9 months chemo, leaving years later a very thin gum and bone for a denture to rest on. Nothing holds the bottom but there is more cushion with the Secure in as it doesn&#x27;t wash away with saliva. Again, no chemicals it is food grade if you swallow it. I am very satisfied know that even if I never have the bone to hold in the bottom, I am able to cushion and keep them in for a meal or two.</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff, have trouble with my bottoms. Not anymore.</li>
    <li> Secure worked very well on upper and lower dentures. One thing I didn&#x27;t like was the time it took to clean my mouth after removing my dentures at night. But, on the plus side, Secure held my dentures securely for more than 12 hours.</li>
    <li> If anyone has any doubts about this product you can doubt no more. I read the reviews and had mixed feelings about it but ordered some anyway. This was by far the denture adhesive,  period. I&#x27;ve tried EVERY kind there is in stores and online and will never use anything else.</li>
    <li> It lives up to its promise and doesn&#x27;t irritate the gums like the other Secure products. Unfortunately, it also doesn&#x27;t hold as well.</li>
    <li> It IS a bit stronger than the run of the mill competitor. Husband likes it....so far have not found it locally. It only took a week to get here, so if you plan ahead ordering online could be useful.</li>
    <li> Great price fast shipping. A++++++++++++</li>
    <li> They mentioned a tingling feeling which seemed pretty intense to me. The hold was good, but the aftermath was not pretty. It felt as if my gums had been burned. Can&#x27;t imagine what ingredient could produce this kind of irritation as it is even the one supposedly designed for sensitive gums.</li>
    <li> great product, different from fixodent, it does not dissolve easily than fixodent</li>
    <li> I was told about secure by my dentist and I love it. As long as the dentures and your gums are clean and DRY the secure adhesive works all day for me.</li>
    <li> The Best Adhesive on the market</li>
    <li> Best product for securing lower dentures I could find.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a couple years and find it the best on the market. It has lasting hold as it advertises for up to 12 hours!! I found the cheapest price on Amazon. You won&#x27;t go wrong to try this, I am glad I did!</li>
    <li> This works great but more importantly doesnt leave the bad taste in your mouth that other products like Fixodent leave. Be sure and apply to a DRY denture and dry your gums before inserting. I tried Secure without the Aloe and Myrrh but it didnt work. Ordered on Amazon and it wasnt expired but it turned to mush after 3 hours and had no hold whatsoever. Fixodent works great too but has chemical taste and makes my stomach feel raw -chemicals in it? Secure doesnt leave this taste and doesnt affect taste of food or drink either.</li>
    <li> This adhesive is great for loose dentures.  I have just got new dentures after having my teeth removed and during the gum shrinkage time, this is about the only thing that would keep my dentures in.  I highly recommend this item.</li>
    <li> I choose this adhesive because of the great reviews regarding lasting hold.  Unfortunately, it was not lasting at all and left a white rough film on my dentures which was hard to remove.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> No nasty ingredients.</li>
    <li> Seems to last a little bit longer than Fixodent on the upper. Nothing works for long on the lower.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried all the national brands and I found this the best for me. There is no oozing and when you need to clean your dentures soak for 15 minutes in hot water and it brushes away under running water, no problem.  Great product!</li>
    <li> This product is no better at holding dentures than Poligrip or Fixadent. However, it is the dickens to remove this plastic goop from the dentures.</li>
    <li> Purchased this to help hold in a partial plate that sits over the top of a couple of teeth. I followed the directions. I tried several times and it stuck to other teeth and was hard to remove from teeth and the partial, had to scrape and scrape.  Plus, it did not hold the partial in place.</li>
    <li> I find that it has a sting to it. I can feel it for about 15 min. after I put them in. After that it holds for awhile but it&#x27;s not super sensitive or super hold.</li>
    <li> Product works the best of any I have tried. It was delivered really quickly and in secure packaging. Will definitely order again</li>
    <li> Good product very slow shipping</li>
    <li> So far Secure Denture Cream is the only denture adhesive that works for me</li>
    <li> It did not perform well.  I had an allergic reaction to it.  My mouth was inflamed and had two huge sores from it.  No longer using it.</li>
    <li> Great product that holds well all day! Thank you!</li>
    <li> IT DID NOT SERVE THE PURPOSE THAT I NEEDED IT FOR .IT IS LIKE THE SAME OTHER ADHESIVES FOR TWICE THE COST IT DESOLVES SO FAST THAT I EXPECTED AND THERE IS NOT EVEN ANY IMMEDIATE FIRMNESS. I WOULD NOT TRULY RECOMMEND IT TO ANY WHO NEEDS THE HELP</li>
    <li> Seems to work better than any of the others.</li>
    <li> This stuff lasts for a long time. Secures dentures very well, and you only need a little bit. Far superior to any other similar product I have used. Also soothing to the gums, and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> This denture adhesive woks better than any OTC products, Thanks!!</li>
