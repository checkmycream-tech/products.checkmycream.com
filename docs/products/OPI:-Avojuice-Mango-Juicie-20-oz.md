<li> I got a sample of this lotion as part of a gift swap, and I figured it would be another greasy mess that would end up in my junk drawer.  </li>

    <li> Love this lotion. Mango scent is delicious!</li>
    <li> I had received this as a gift and when it was getting low tried to find it locally, to no avail.  I was quite happy to find it on Amazon and be able to continue to use a wonderful product.  The scent is light and there is no greasy effect when using.</li>
    <li> Very mango-y. But very good lotion!</li>
    <li> Smells great but doesn&#x27;t moisturize that well.</li>
    <li> silky-ist lotion i have found.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. Makes my hands soft without a greasy feeling.</li>
    <li> Smells incredible and softens hands really nice. Makes a great lotion for your kitchen sink tip or at your desk.</li>
    <li> Makes my hands feel very soft. Smells awesome.</li>
    <li> We were introduced to this product at a salon and my mother never forgot about it.  She looked all over for it and I finally ordered it for her off of Amazon.  She loves it!  Silky hands with a nice mango scent!</li>
    <li> Avo Juice is my favorite lotion. It goes on quickly, water bases, never oily.  Skin feels silky when done applying. The only lotion I consistently keep buying.</li>
    <li> I love the OPI Avojuice Skin Quenchers line of lotion.  It&#x27;s a very light, almost watery lotion that keeps my hands lightly hydrated and smelling good.  If you need an intense, deep hand lotion this lotion is not for you.  But if your hands are only mildly dry or you&#x27;re looking for something to keep your hands moisturized between hand washings, this is for you.

    <li> This lotion is the best....very soft and stays on even after washing hands...</li>

I&#x27;m so glad I gave it a chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion smells heavenly!  When you first apply it, it seems a bit oily, but within seconds, it starts sinking into your skin, and within 15 seconds has completely absorbed, leaving no greasy residue.  This is my new go to lotion!</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast :) I&#x27;m generally really picky with my lotion scents and get headaches when I&#x27;m in places like Bath and Body Works, and this scent was too strong for me. I use it before I go to bed and wake up with dry hands like usual. Avojuice is great as a temporary fix for dry hands. If you want moisture retained in your skin, either use something else or use something in conjunction with this.</li>
    <li> I live in Florida and most moisturizers are too greasy for the climate but this one is light, comfortable and smells lovely.</li>
    <li> This is a gift for a friend who absolutely loves this stuff.</li>
    <li> Light smell and works great. Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Great hand lotion. Love the sweet scent.</li>
    <li> My favorite Lotion. This one is a gift and it arrived 3 days after I bought it!!!!!! I will order again</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter-in-law, who loves it.</li>
    <li> The skin quenchers are great. Would recommend .</li>
    <li> Wonderful,tropical scent!</li>
    <li> Love the scent.  Will recommend it to all my friends.  I was given a sample of this product&lt;br /&gt;from my beutician.</li>
    <li> excellent product. smooth on and smell pleasant. coworkers have complimented me numerous times daily about how good they think that I smell. I have been recommending your product to coworkers and family/friends.</li>
    <li> I received a sample and loved it.  Ingredient list includes dimethicone, which as a wound &amp; skin care specialist RN I learned is key in smoothing skin.  This is the second bottle I&#x27;ve ordered since February, as I use it daily on hands, elbows &amp; arms, and all over after showering.  I am 70 yrs old, and my skin is very soft and smooth.  I highly recommend OPI Ajojuice lotions.  The mango is my favorite fragrance, though the coconut and the vanilla are also very nice.  I don&#x27;t care so much for the florals.</li>
    <li> Lightweight; absorbs easily. Smell is a bit overpowering, but it&#x27;s a good scent (very fruity, artificial).</li>
    <li> A wonderful fresh smell, excellent moisturizer for a reasonable price. I recommend it highly.</li>
