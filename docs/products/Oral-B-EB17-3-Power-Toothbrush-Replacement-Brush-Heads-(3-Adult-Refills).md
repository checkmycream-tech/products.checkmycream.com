      <li>These brushes are a very effective way of thoroughly cleaning your teeth and gums.  </li>

      <li>[This price] for three heads may seem pricey given what you can pick up three toothbrushes for, but the Braun electric toothbrush is really very effective, so for good dental hygiene it is worth getting.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

      <li>Good price; somewhat louder and more vibration than the original.</li>
      <li>Effective and easy to use</li>
      <li>I wish they had more in stock.  </li>
      <li>Reordering was simple and service was excellent.</li>
      <li>So glad Amazon had them.</li>
      <li>Mr. Bargain&#x27;s service was outstanding.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;m sure you won&#x27;t have any problems.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how many refills we have used.</li>
      <li>please make sure the products number if u want to order from this seller.  </li>
      <li>Happy to find correct brushes for older power toothbrush.  </li>
      <li>Even though the product was as advertised and was in perfect condition I did not appreciate having to wait so long.</li>
      <li>If you mouth is more petite or you have a strong gag reflex, your teeth suffer.</li>
      <li>This toothbrush tops the list of brushes that help fight plaque and keep teeth wonderfully clean!  </li>
      <li>these worked fine and were lots better price than in the store.</li>
      <li>exceptional prices and fast delivery....</li>
      <li>They work fine, no problems.</li>
      <li>These  replacement brush heads seem to work fine.</li>
      <li>Typical Oral B good quality and Amazon got me a good price.</li>
      <li>But Amazon doubled my order and charged me shipping; for one set, when it was a \\&quot;free shipping\\&quot; item</li>
      <li>Fit</li>
      <li>I ordered this item, it was shipped by an Amazon partner, who packaged it in a HUGE box, filled with plastic packing material.  </li>
      <li>The handle units now being sold don&#x27;t fit these.</li>
      <li>I bought these a while back thinking it was a great savings.  </li>
      <li>and yes I met the requirement for \\&quot;free Shipping\\&quot;.  </li>
      <li>The bristles seem much softer and not as effective.  </li>
      <li>Satisfied with performan ce of products for right now.</li>
      <li>Anyone who wants to keep their teeth should use this product!!!</li>
      <li>they fit better than the last replacement brushes I bought at the drug store...bought a bunch, so we can change them a lot more often.</li>
      <li>Make sure you find the best deal, because they&#x27;re all the exact same product, listed multiple times!</li>
      <li>In any event be aware of the style that is being sold and know that the original type was a more firm bristle, and more effective.</li>
      <li>My dentist hygienist has consistently given me thumbs up approval for the positive differences/improvements since using this brush. :)</li>
      <li>It is GOOD as it can easily get into areas with no effort that were frequently getting missed by my larger brush head!</li>
      <li>it is probably worth the investment.</li>
      <li>I received the product the next day by US Mail, packed in a nice padded envelope.</li>
      <li>So far, with the Oral B Power Toothbrush I have been able to avoid that fate.  </li>
      <li>Product came quickly and was exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>These brush heads were sold as new, but should had honestly been sold as \\&quot;New and DEFECTIVE\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>This is a great price compared to what&#x27;s available in stores, although the product itself, like all brands of power toothbrush replacement heads, is ridiculously overpriced.</li>
      <li>These clean well and are gentle to the gums.</li>
      <li>They really make me feel clean after I brush with them.</li>
      <li>The main point here is to have as clean set of teeth as you can.</li>
      <li>well, easy to know when to replace, soft, functional, and durable.  </li>
      <li>the package was damaged and looks like so cheap and coming from very old inventory.</li>
      <li>The reviews were most helpful in trying to decide on the generic toothbrush heads or the brand name.</li>
      <li>thaks asgain and will order more in the future</li>
      <li>The package I got had 4 refills, and none of them could fit my professional care toothbrush.</li>
      <li>Received exactly what was list, exactly what I thought I was getting and what I orders.  </li>
      <li>Really though, the price was right, exactly what I wanted, brushes great- not too firm, not too soft, just right.</li>
      <li>It seems perfectly normal and fine, exactly the same as the brush heads that came with the original Braun toothbrush.    </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m curious about the more advanced versions which claim to surround each tooth and provide a flossing action, but didn&#x27;t get them this time.</li>
      <li>Good brushes, but they don&#x27;t last long.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t believe these are real Oral B replacement heads.</li>
      <li>The transaction was fast and product was there before I know it.  </li>
      <li>These look like the real thing, but must be a knock off made in China.</li>
      <li>tHANKS for the product we will use it alot with our business.  </li>
      <li>They do not &amp;#34;click&amp;#34; in like the real Oral-B brushes I get at Walmart.  </li>
      <li>Order was shipped in a very timely matter.  </li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>if it was a right one, still it was too old and seems like outdated(expired) stuff.    </li>
      <li>It does the work for you, vibrating thousands of times a second, it lets you clean your teeth without scraping your gums with a toothbrush, which can cause them to recede and bleed, and it reaches between your teeth to catch plaque and germs.  </li>
      <li>While the power toothbrush works quite well, just be aware that buying these things pretty much locks you into a regular brush replacement regimene that will cost a family of four over $100 a year.</li>
      <li>And Oral-B seems to further manipulate their customers into a steady stream of cash by engineering these brushes to go badly quickly.</li>
      <li>These are too tight fitting</li>
      <li>The soft bristles clean your teeth and massage your gums efficiently, and the color bands are a convenient way to color-code heads for multiple users.  </li>
      <li>I have used this product several times and I have to say it is worth the money.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s pretty much your only option.</li>
      <li>Thought the first head was faulty and tried the next.  </li>
      <li>They apologized and explained that this was a generic product from a chinese manufacturer and although they had never run into this/any problem with their products before, they would send me a replacement (oral B original) product.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Received exactly what was list, exactly what I thought I was getting and what I orders.  Order was shipped in a very timely matter.  Very happy with the product and shipping time.</li>
    <li> I have had a hard time finding replacement brush heads for my Oral B power toothbrush. So glad Amazon had them. They are economical, work great and make my dental hygienist very happy because they clean so well.</li>
    <li> These are the best.  I have a Braun toothbrush (professional care/2 speeds) and these are the ideal fit for that toothbrush.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been a regular flosser and brusher for several years, to the delight of my hygentist (and myself).  Recently I bought the oral-b brush replacement 3pack and began adding it to my evening teeth cleaning.  After a few weeks I noticed tenderness in some of my gums.  I began brushing as usual, omitting the oral b, and the pain subsided.  I think maybe I was pressing too hard, as if I were brushing with a manual toothbrush.  I like the feeling of the oral b cleaning, but, as in all oral care, be careful not to brush too hard or you&#x27;ll do damage to get that amazing clean feeling!</li>
    <li> This is a great price compared to what&#x27;s available in stores, although the product itself, like all brands of power toothbrush replacement heads, is ridiculously overpriced.</li>
    <li> I ordered this item from the seller shown above, but got it from different seller (Mr. Bargain). The description says &#x27;3 refills&#x27;. The package I got had 4 refills, and none of them could fit my professional care toothbrush.</li>
    <li> do not buy good products from a bad company. They sent the wrong brushes and after 3 calls and  them lying we still did not receive the right product.</li>
    <li> Happy to find correct brushes for older power toothbrush.  Typical Oral B good quality and Amazon got me a good price.</li>
    <li> The product is not look the same as shown on the picture, it is a trash</li>
    <li> exceptional prices and fast delivery....they fit better than the last replacement brushes I bought at the drug store...bought a bunch, so we can change them a lot more often.</li>
    <li> I purchased this from Mr. Bargain. As some others have noted, the package may have been imported from Germany. The text on the package is in several languages including English.    It is a Braun product, not any imitation. I immediately started using one of the brush heads to test it. It seems perfectly normal and fine, exactly the same as the brush heads that came with the original Braun toothbrush.    Mr. Bargain&#x27;s service was outstanding. Within about 2 hours of placing the order on Amazon.com, I received an email from Mr. Bargain that it was being shipped. The email included the USPS tracking number. I received the product the next day by US Mail, packed in a nice padded envelope.</li>
    <li> Purchasing these brush heads turned out to be an excellent choice.  Will definitely think about doing it again when needed.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> The product was received in a timely manner and the quality was good.[[ASIN:B00006ANDJ Oral B EB17-3 Power Toothbrush Replacement Brush Heads (3 Adult Refills)]]</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been happy with Oral-B/Braun products until now.  The brushes I purchased and used just simply don&#x27;t work as well as the originals.  The bristles seem much softer and not as effective.  On the package of four that I received it did say \\&quot;Flexsoft EB-17-4\\&quot;.  Perhaps these are a different style and softer bristle.  In any event be aware of the style that is being sold and know that the original type was a more firm bristle, and more effective.</li>
    <li> I purchased a multi-pack of electric toothbrush heads from USHealth Tests and Products (via Amazon) several months ago. Unfortunately the competitive price of this product did not make up for the poor quality and unsafety of it. During brushing, small pieces of metal came out of the toothbrush heads and shot into the gums and lips, sometimes causing lacerations. After this, the round brushing part of the head would come loose itself.      After 3 of the toothbrush heads did this, I contacted the seller by email and then by phone and explained the problem to them. They apologized and explained that this was a generic product from a chinese manufacturer and although they had never run into this/any problem with their products before, they would send me a replacement (oral B original) product. I agreed.     Unfortunately, over the past few weeks, as I began to use these \\&quot;original oral B\\&quot; toothbrush heads, the same problem has recurred with pieces of metal shooting out of the rotating toothbrush head during brushing and hitting the gums and lips. I&#x27;ve been using oral B electric toothbrushes for a few years and have never seen anything like this. I&#x27;m not exactly sure if this second set I have received are really oral B products or not.      My point is that low price apparently means poor quality, at least in the case of this seller.</li>
    <li> The product arrived within the estimated delivery date. The condition of the product was excellent. Just what I hoped for when I placed the order.</li>
    <li> I have bought these toothbrush heads about 4 times and never had a problem. I would recommend them ,especially for the price! HAPPY CUSTOMER~!</li>
    <li> This product is a perfect replacement for the brush heads that originally came with the Oral B tooth brush.</li>
    <li> I have been using these brush heads for at least 2 years now. At first I thought the brush head was too small. I was wrong. It is GOOD as it can easily get into areas with no effort that were frequently getting missed by my larger brush head! My dentist hygienist has consistently given me thumbs up approval for the positive differences/improvements since using this brush. :)</li>
    <li> I got a package of 4 rather than 3, the same package (with several European languages on it) that I&#x27;ve already had. They work fine, no problems.</li>
    <li> product was different than picture. please make sure the products number if u want to order from this seller.  if it was a right one, still it was too old and seems like outdated(expired) stuff.    after returning to them, i couldn&#x27;t get refund; i used the amazon dispute claim services for my refund.</li>
    <li> The transaction was fast and product was there before I know it.  Great transaction!!</li>
    <li> I will not order from this vendor again. It took almost a month to process and receive my order. Even though the product was as advertised and was in perfect condition I did not appreciate having to wait so long.</li>
    <li> Necessary replacement brush heads to maintain correct oral hygeine with rotary Braun electric toothbrush.  I foung Amazon.com&#x27;s price for this item CHEAPER than Costco or Sam&#x27;s Club!!!!</li>
    <li> Remember when you didn&#x27;t need to replace your toothbrush every 12 weeks? It&#x27;s almost a certainty that the hype about frequent brush replacement was started by the companies that make them. And Oral-B seems to further manipulate their customers into a steady stream of cash by engineering these brushes to go badly quickly. Within a couple of months use, the bristles on these brushes completely wear out, far quicker than one would expect or than used to happen on their old brushes. My best guess is that they design these things to deteriorate at a rapid pace to make more money. While the power toothbrush works quite well, just be aware that buying these things pretty much locks you into a regular brush replacement regimene that will cost a family of four over $100 a year.</li>
    <li> ...but great brushes. They really make me feel clean after I brush with them. I just wish they weren&#x27;t so pricey, but if this means healthier teeth (my boyfriend&#x27;s dentist knew that he had been using an electric toothbrush when he went to his check up, because it was night and day) it is probably worth the investment.</li>
    <li> Our family has used Oral B electric toothbrushes for years. I can&#x27;t tell you how many refills we have used. These clean well and are gentle to the gums.</li>
    <li> Effective and easy to use</li>
    <li> Well, this is the 1st time I&#x27;ve bought my replacement brush heads on line.  And YES, they are ALOT cheaper than the store, but the brush is a little looser than the ones I buy in the store.  I will still use these, but it difficult when it vibrates more than its suppose to. I am a little disappointed, and don&#x27;t know if I will buy these again.</li>
    <li> The handle units now being sold don&#x27;t fit these.</li>
    <li> Product came quickly and was exactly what I wanted. What a great deal. Checked prices at Target and Walmart and they were much, much more expensive.</li>
    <li> These Oral-B (3-Pc Pre-pack) tooth brushes were a great buy.  I wish they had more in stock.  I like to stock-up on sales.</li>
    <li> These brushes start to fray after a few uses.  They are labeled as an Oral-B product, but do not possess the  Oral-B quality.</li>
    <li> They came with pool quality. the package was damaged and looks like so cheap and coming from very old inventory.</li>
    <li> Everything was as advertized.  Excellent quality and delivery.  Would recommend supplier and will use again.</li>
    <li> The toothbrush is great, feels like you just came from the dentist and had your teeth cleaned.</li>
    <li> Ooh, aah, what a great replacement toothbrush.  Really though, the price was right, exactly what I wanted, brushes great- not too firm, not too soft, just right.</li>
    <li> These brushes are a very effective way of thoroughly cleaning your teeth and gums.  The soft bristles clean your teeth and massage your gums efficiently, and the color bands are a convenient way to color-code heads for multiple users.  There&#x27;s even a spare in case you lose one.&lt;br /&gt;Of course you should still floss before brushing, but the small soft brush and the speed of the rotation makes daily dental hygiene easy and painless.&lt;br /&gt;When I ordered this item, it was shipped by an Amazon partner, who packaged it in a HUGE box, filled with plastic packing material.  I could hardly find the small package inside the carton.&lt;br /&gt;High marks for the product, huge waste of packing material and postage for the packaging.</li>
    <li> Came within a few days. Cost was about $7.00 less then our local retail stores.</li>
    <li> These  replacement brush heads seem to work fine. Very similar to past items. Arrived as advertised.  I&#x27;m curious about the more advanced versions which claim to surround each tooth and provide a flossing action, but didn&#x27;t get them this time.</li>
    <li> I bought these a while back thinking it was a great savings.  Not true.  From the first use, the filiaments on the brush head broke off either in between teeth, or in my mouth where I could feel them and have to track them down and extract them which was rather difficult. They were practically invisible.  Every brush in the pack did this continuously.  I finally just bought the pricier replacements at Walmart and problem solved.  Note, the originals are made in Germany, while the poor quality brushes came from Ireland according to the packaging declarations. I would not buy these EB series 17-4 replacement brushes  again.</li>
    <li> http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006ANDJ/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_rev_prod_title  These are too tight fitting but the 1st one worked in spite of the tight fit.  The 2nd one was defective, the inside o ring was loose hence the brush did not spin.  Bogus!  Can&#x27;t believe these are real Oral B replacement heads.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush tops the list of brushes that help fight plaque and keep teeth wonderfully clean!  Received ONLY \\&quot;GREAT\\&quot; REPORTS from the dentist since I began using ORAL BRAND some years ago.&lt;BR&gt;TRY IT!  Its FANTASTIC!!!</li>
    <li> [This price] for three heads may seem pricey given what you can pick up three toothbrushes for, but the Braun electric toothbrush is really very effective, so for good dental hygiene it is worth getting.&lt;br /&gt;I like the colour rings provided in these sets, which allow multiple users to make use of a single electric toothbrush handle.  The heads go white with use to tell you when they are ready for replacement.</li>
    <li> Dentists all over the country are recommending the Oral-B electric toothbrush.  There are several reasons.  It does the work for you, vibrating thousands of times a second, it lets you clean your teeth without scraping your gums with a toothbrush, which can cause them to recede and bleed, and it reaches between your teeth to catch plaque and germs.  This is a wonderful toothbrush, and I recommend it.  However, if you want a review of a toothbrush, you&#x27;ll read the toothbrush page.  This is a page for replacement heads.&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a lot of confusion about replacement heads for Oral B electric toothbrushes on Amazon, and I just want to give you all some facts.  There are only three kinds of heads for ALL Oral-B electric toothbrushes.  Flexisoft EB17, Extrasoft EB17, and Ortho OD17.  I prefer Flexisoft EB17, which is what this item is. (The Extrasoft is a little too soft, and the Ortho is overpriced)&lt;br /&gt;The reason I mention this is that the prices are all over the board for what is the same product.  For example, this listing is for three Flexisoft EB17 heads for $19.99 (The EB17-3 just means there are three of them).  There are other offers through Amazon partners for this exact same item for $9.99.  Make sure you find the best deal, because they&#x27;re all the exact same product, listed multiple times!</li>
    <li> I grew up seeing my grandma&#x27;s dentures in a glass on the bathroom sink.  So far, with the Oral B Power Toothbrush I have been able to avoid that fate.  Anyone who wants to keep their teeth should use this product!!!</li>
    <li> Not much to say as far as the product is concerned I have been using my Oral-B for years.    But Amazon doubled my order and charged me shipping; for one set, when it was a \\&quot;free shipping\\&quot; item and yes I met the requirement for \\&quot;free Shipping\\&quot;.  I even called and talked to a customer service rep.  He said he would look into it and back to me.  Never heard back from Amazon rep.  But if you have an Oral-B it&#x27;s pretty much your only option.</li>
    <li> Received products in a timely manner. Satisfied with performan ce of products for right now.</li>
    <li> These brushes have proved to be as good as original. Reordering was simple and service was excellent.</li>
    <li> Purchased these items a few weeks ago. Already one head has fallen off and the second one is coming loose! These are somehow sub-standard or didn&#x27;t pass quality control. They look original, but aren&#x27;t up to the normal standard of replacement heads I have previously purchased.</li>
    <li> great quality. Everything I expected, but I wish they didn&#x27;t cost so much. I ended up buying a generic set after this to save money and like the generic set just as much</li>
    <li> The main point here is to have as clean set of teeth as you can. I have used this product several times and I have to say it is worth the money. I have priced these in the store and they run for about $22-$24 dollars. I recommend this to folks that want a healthy mouth and good teeth.</li>
    <li> These are currently unavailable so if you can find them, buy them!  I purchased several for @ 11 a pack in 2009; I still have some to use but know my time is limited!  Love these.  Fit well, easy to know when to replace, soft, functional, and durable.  Can&#x27;t go wrong with Oral-B.</li>
    <li> Good price; somewhat louder and more vibration than the original. No instructions for use of rubber washer included.</li>
    <li> We were unable to find the oral b toothbrush heads in our area stores.    We were happy to find them at Amazon.    The reviews were most helpful in trying to decide on the generic toothbrush heads or the brand name. We chose the brand name dependent on the reviews and have been very happy with them.</li>
    <li> Bought the replacement heads as the price was great compared to retail.  Big mistake.  The brushes pinched the insides of my cheeks and lips.  Painful and downright horrible.  Thought the first head was faulty and tried the next.  It did the same - threw them away.  Should have asked for a refund.</li>
    <li> The toothbrush section an the local drug store has at least a hundred different tooth brushes on offer but in spite of all this variety almost all of these have large heads. If you mouth is more petite or you have a strong gag reflex, your teeth suffer. The Oral B head is small and although you have to work a little more on each tooth, you can. I have not had a cavity in years. My pearly whites look greate and my gums are firm an buffed. If only these woked on abs.</li>
    <li> tHANKS for the product we will use it alot with our business.  thaks asgain and will order more in the future</li>
    <li> these worked fine and were lots better price than in the store. they were the oral b brand and held up the same as the ones that came with the toothbrush....i got tired of paying so much for the replacements and as usual, amazon came through</li>
    <li> good value if you don&#x27;t mind having some of them not work - the merhant was superb to deal with and overall it was a good deal -still would  be nice if all of them worked</li>
    <li> I thought the first defective brush head was a fluke, but when I started using the second, and then the third, it was obvious that this package was defective. Bristles slowly fell out. From the beginning, one or two bristles fall out with each use and often get wedged between my teeth.  These brush heads were sold as new, but should had honestly been sold as \\&quot;New and DEFECTIVE\\&quot;. The seller has not contacted  me but I suspect that they knew they were defective when they obtained them. For the first time in my very long and active Amazon history, I think I was \\&quot;ripped off\\&quot;. Since it took a few months to realize all the brush heads were like this, it&#x27;s likely too late to get my money back.</li>
    <li> The heads are exactly what you expect if you&#x27;ve had an Oral-B toothbrush in the past, but they&#x27;re much cheaper on Amazon than in my local Safeway or Walgreens.  I love the little colored rings as well, although the blue and green are a little too close to easily differentiate with sleep-blurred morning eyes.</li>
    <li> They do not &amp;#34;click&amp;#34; in like the real Oral-B brushes I get at Walmart.  These look like the real thing, but must be a knock off made in China.</li>
    <li> Good brushes, but they don&#x27;t last long. We use them for my handicapped daughter and we have to be careful that they don&#x27;t come apart in her mouth. If you pay attention I&#x27;m sure you won&#x27;t have any problems.</li>
