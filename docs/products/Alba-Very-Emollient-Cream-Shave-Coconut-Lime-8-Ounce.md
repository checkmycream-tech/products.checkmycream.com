      <li>I always had redness and irritation after the shave, and would have to force myself to shave more than once a week.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

      <li>But, this stuff turns the mundane task of shaving into a wonderful smelling and feeling tropical island party.</li>
      <li>On the plus side, the ingredients are natural, nontoxic and it has a pleasant aroma.</li>
      <li>gave 2 stars instead of 1 as a gesture of good will that the cream might be good, but the smell is so odd I won&#x27;t be using it</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Pretty good stuff, I love that it isn&#x27;t out of a can, its very moisturizing, however... as soon as I got it I coulnd&#x27;t wait to smell it... does NOT smell like coconut AT ALL... I smell the lime, but somehow it is also very minty... I think Mojito would be a better scent name for this LOL, either way, good product. Will probably re-order when I finish this, which seems like it will last a LONG time. We shall see as summer is coming.</li>
    <li> My husband is picky and this is the ONLY shaving cream he will use.  Smells fresh and wonderful so I can&#x27;t complain!</li>
    <li> I found this product to be way too thick. It clogged my razor and wouldn&#x27;t rinse out and I use a creme shaving product. This didn&#x27;t help with razor burn or moisturize my skin. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> Cons. Clogs up in razor. Have to shave just as often as using anything else. Pros. Is good for sensitive skin. Doesn&#x27;t smell to bad</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve switched to safety razor two years ago and tried different soaps with the brush. I always had redness and irritation after the shave, and would have to force myself to shave more than once a week.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this one in Safeway (discount, $5) just to try something new - the word emollient (had to look it up) made me buy it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve shaved 3 times in one week, without any redness or rash. It does stick to the razor blade, but it&#x27;s easy to remove. There is no lather, but I rather like no rash vs. no lather outlook.&lt;br /&gt;It smells nice, and leaves the face smooth and moist.</li>
    <li> I bought it for the thick beard/chin hair.  It did not help. It was okay for thinner face or neck hairs..i may go back to clinique $15 cream shave.</li>
    <li> Let me preface this by saying that I don&#x27;t ever bother to take the time to write reviews for products, even if they work well. However, Alba shave cream worked so exceedingly well that I was prompted to do it justice with this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the coconut lime version on a whim based on what another reviewer on Amazon wrote. This was ~3 years ago. I bought a tube to try and that SAME one tube lasted me 2 years. Yes, you read that correctly. I shave about every 3 days and usually after a shower. It says (correctly) on the tube that using less works better, and this is definitely the case. I find that I can use about dime to nickel-sized drop to cover my entire face. Remember to wet your face lightly before applying, as this helps the cream spread. And DO NOT gob it on, this is not your regular horrid shaving cream. Apply it as if you were putting on aftershave lotion or a face lotion...that same amount. It goes on clear (a big plus since you can see what spots you missed). Shave as normal, rinsing frequently..your beard will just seem to vanish from your face. There is no tugging of the blade, no skipping, in fact with sharp or even a somewhat used razor, you hardly exert any effort...its just like a knife through butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I have fairly sensitive skin and find that after using the alba shave cream I don&#x27;t even need aftershave. I have no bumps, ingrown hairs, nothing except a smooth shave. I can count the amount of nicks and cuts I&#x27;ve had in 2 years on one hand and you can kiss irritation goodbye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, BUY THIS. It uses natural ingredients and isn&#x27;t even tested on animals. It&#x27;s a steal and I would pay even $20 a tube, it&#x27;s that good. Get the 4 pack and give it as gifts or just to keep handy. The length of this review should tell you how good alba shave cream is! NO other shaving cream/lotion that I&#x27;ve tried even comes close. I will never use another shaving cream again. Happy shaving!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**** UPDATE 9/2009 ****&lt;br /&gt;  So I put my money where my mouth was and bought a new tube after my old trusty one ran out. Much to my extreme disappointment I found out that Alba has changed the formula of this product. It is much less thick and not as moisturizing. I suspect they watered it down after discovering just how little you needed to shave. Now the shave is simply decent and I&#x27;m back on the hunt to find a thick, MOISTURIZING cream shave again. Any suggestions Amazonians?</li>
    <li> Not quite what I expected. I thought I would get a much smoother shave, that was not the case. I will keep searching for an environmentally friendly shaving product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to purchase more organic/green products from ethical companies and decided to try this. I love this cream! No razor burn or bumps from ingrown hairs.</li>
    <li> smells great and leaves skin very soft, but not the best shaving cream</li>
    <li> I have been in search of a good shave cream for a while and I am so glad I finally tried this one. It is my new favorite and the only one I have tried that has worked well for me. I have issues with getting painfully irritated skin when I shave. I&#x27;ve tried various razors and with and without different shave creams. Using this shave cream is the first time in years that I have not had issues with my skin hurting after shaving. I will definitely keep using this product.</li>
    <li> Very nice smell and works great.  I only use it when I don&#x27;t shave for a few days or take a trip.  If anyone has found a way to get around the problem of it&#x27;s being so thick that it clogs one&#x27;s razor, let me know.</li>
    <li> Alba is one of my favorite brands in general. But this shaving cream is a major misfire. This is a disastrous product that I wanted to like, but after shaving a dozen times with this stuff with every shave a complete flop, I really have no choice but to throw it in the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; shave is not really a cream at all, but more like an oily gum. It clogs the razor so quickly that by the time you&#x27;re halfway through your shave, the razor no longer works...which makes getting a close shave on most of your face impossible. Scalding water does nothing to remove the gummy &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; from the razor. There is no second use with a razor that has been used in conjunction with this stuff--it&#x27;s gummed up beyond repair. I have tried using a tiny tiny amount as suggested, but with the same results. And what truly makes this product a diabolical failure--not only did it clog up my razor in one shave worse than my previous brand would do over an entire MONTH--but after a couple weeks, I&#x27;m thinking it clogged up my sink as well! Using a snake to unclog it pulled up what looked suspiciously like globs of this stuff. Water simply does not dissolve it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that it&#x27;s vegetarian, no animal tested, etc....but that&#x27;s also true of a scoop of mud, and I wouldn&#x27;t shave with that either. I wish Alba would go back to the drawing board with this one. It certainly smells nice, but it is literally the worst shaving cream I have ever used. And not exactly cheap, either.</li>
    <li> Very emollient, just like it says. I have super sensitive skin and this causes no irritation. I won&#x27;t ever go back to shaving cream again!</li>
    <li> Excellent shave. Cream does not lather, so it is hard to see where I shaved, when compared to a cream that lathers. Smells good. Would buy again</li>
    <li> The product does not foam up at all.  It is like a skin moisturizer with coconut scent.  Just didn&#x27;t feel like  a shaving cream.</li>
    <li> Unless you&#x27;ve got superior hand strength, you&#x27;ll find that it is practically impossible to squeeze the contents out of the tube. I final resorted to cutting the tube open and spooning the contents out and into a jar.</li>
    <li> I took a chance to see what this product was all about. I am so glad I didn&#x27;t keep scrolling right past it in the search. It was well worth my time and money spent for this product. The smell first of all is quite pleasant soothing and aromatic. It does not take much of this product to get the job done which means less mess and it would last you longer.I have never had to shave so clean and so smooth and so meaningful until I started using this product. I gave it 4 stars because I wish they had bigger sizes and more variety to purchase. Other than that I am completely satisfied with my purchase and will highly recommend and continue to use this product. This is the first time I&#x27;ve actually used saving cream instead of gel and I noticed a big difference!</li>
    <li> I was wasting all my expensive body wash on shaving so I bought this to try. It does not smell like coconuts or limes. It smells minty, like a foot cream. It&#x27;s not bad, but not what I wanted. The smell doesn&#x27;t linger so it doesn&#x27;t really matter. It does the job. It&#x27;s consistency is basically like hair conditioner. I like it and will finish the bottle.</li>
    <li> What a great product! After settling for years of cuts and scrapes, I started using Alba and what a difference! No more cuts and red marks, only a smooth, clean, refreshing shave! I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing, I have very coarse leg hair and have never loved a product more!!</li>
    <li> WOW!  alba is The Best shave cream I have ever used--and I am one leg-shaving fool.  I cannot stand to have a single nub.  I have used every shave cream, gel, body cream, shower gel known to all mankind trying to find what works the best &amp; this is It ;-0  The fragrance is great.  I am a big lime lover, &amp; I smell the fresh scent of lime in this--with a touch of coconut.  The cream is thick and protects from nick&#x27;s, razor burn &amp; somehow ingrown hair ugliness.  A little goes a long way-which is a great asset for someone who shaves their legs (or probably face-for men) every single day-summer and winter.  Thank you alba--I am now going to see what other products you make.  I can&#x27;t believe it took me so many years to find you :-0</li>
    <li> Works just fine and smells nice. My only complaint is that it makes my razor mucky but it&#x27;s easy to wipe off. It doesn&#x27;t foam - it&#x27;s a cream and it helps the razor glide over the skin smoothly. I&#x27;ll likely buy it again as it makes my skin feel softer than using soap. Plus, it has good ingredients and isn&#x27;t tested on animals.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the BEST shaving product I&#x27;ve used in 50 years of keeping my face clean shaven.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 4 years now and I must say it is awesome.  There is a world of difference in this and the shaving gel/cream that you get in the old school cans.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This product is the first shave cream I&#x27;ve ever really tried and I really liked it.  I didn&#x27;t particularly like the smell since I&#x27;m not a coconut fan but it got the job done well.</li>
    <li> Really good product. I searched for a while for a good eco friendly cruelty free shave cream. My search is over Im very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> It works great and it smells great too. It does a great job of moisturizing the areas you use it on. And a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive legs, when I shave I normally get razor burn bumps on my lower calves but I&#x27;ve been using the Alba shaving cream for over a year and I haven&#x27;t had any bumps since. It&#x27;s great</li>
    <li> I like to try different creams since I started safety razor shaving and using a brush to lather up a soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is as described and the main reason I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;The tingle or stinging feeling is the strongest of any creams that I have tried.  Not painful but surprising.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m used to lathering up creams and soaps but I can&#x27;t with this, I just have to put some on my face by hand.&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t buy this again, I&#x27;m going to stick with soaps and creams that lather up.</li>
    <li> This stuff is super-nice for shaving one&#x27;s face.  I have dry, fairly sensitive skin and shave daily, so it&#x27;s the kind of thing I need.  I also sometimes use &amp;#34;Bump Stopper&amp;#34; and Arko shaving soap applied with a brush.  This Alba stuff is probably the most soothing of all.</li>
    <li> Very good for shaving. Have bought multiple times</li>
    <li> This product smells so good, and it is so rich and creamy.  Definitely my favorite shaving cream - no bumps or cuts, ever!</li>
    <li> Makes your skin smooth, even when you&#x27;re cold and smells great. Easy to shave your legs. Love it!</li>
    <li> I really like this shaving cream, as it allows for a really close shave. I could just see all the little hair fuzzies drifting away in the tub lol. My friend was raving about the Coochy shaving cream, so when another friend threw a Pure Romance party I went ahead and bought a tube......for $20. This Alba and the Coochy have a similar consistency, but I honestly much prefer the Alba. The Coochy really wasn&#x27;t anything special, in my opinion, and the Alba has a far better price tag! My only complaint is that it smells nothing like coconut lime! I was surprised when I opened it and got a whiff of mint. This seriously smells like peppermint tea or toothpaste. No big deal, but kind of strange.</li>
    <li> This cream actually clogs my razor making it difficult to shave. Never had any other product do that. Disappointed and won&#x27;t be buying again</li>
    <li> This provides a very clean and deep shave. The product is so thick I had to realize that a little goes a long way. Smells great my only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t smell like coconut!! I ordered craving an intense coconuty fragrance to delight the senses. but was a little disappointed. I can&#x27;t smell coconut at all! And I am a big fan of coconut. It still smells great, almost like spearmint lime maybe just not coconut.</li>
    <li> Not great... Thick but it doesn&#x27;t lather or truly do anything to stick or provide a smooth shave. I really wanted to like this stuff. :(</li>
    <li> Terrific shaving cream, and a little goes a long way. Just be sure to rinse it out of your razor completely.</li>
    <li> Soothing, smells good, and gets a super close shave.  I highly recommend this product. Puts Edge Gel and other commercial gels and shaving creams to shame. Great value for the money.</li>
    <li> Clogs the razor&#x27;s blades!</li>
    <li> the best shaving cream on the market, but just remember to lather up thoroughly before applying.</li>
    <li> Like the smell and it has none of the crap ingredients many others have. Highly recommend this quality product</li>
    <li> Pros- Product smells wonderful, just as advertised. It&#x27;s also great as a moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons- Unfortunately, this product doesn&#x27;t perform well as a shaving cream. The product glops on and doesn&#x27;t break down enough to assist in the shaving process. Multiple applications are required to finish one shave, so after my 10th shave the container is nearly empty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted this cream to work, but it does not perform as expected. If the formula is updated I&#x27;d be willing to give it another go, so I&#x27;ll keep this on my radar for now.</li>
    <li> My husband and I started using Alba shave cream a few years ago.  We both love it but hate the price.  Tried the Trader Joe version for some time but it is not as nice.  I find that we use less of this high quality shave gel than any of the other brands we have tried.  No skin irritation and it is smooth.  Amazon at the best price by far.</li>
    <li> A big favorite in our house! Everyone agrees, this is a great product. Smells wonderful, goes on very well and really helps skin to feel soft.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years and it is the best shaving cream I have ever found. Let me preface this by saying that I hate shaving. No likey. But, this stuff turns the mundane task of shaving into a wonderful smelling and feeling tropical island party. Super creamy, lasts a long time, and did I mention it smells amazing. I am even able to eake out a nice shave with a dollar store razor because this sauce is the boss! If this is kind is not your flavor, the company also makes other scents and even unscented. Call the doctor said woke me up said doctor... now let me get this straight.... you put the lime in the coconut and put &#x27;em both together, you put the lime in the coconut then you feel better.</li>
    <li> I am more demanding of a shave cream than most in that I shave my head as well as face. This was the worst shave cream I&#x27;ve ever used. It seems to offer about as much protection as plain water. I never had this many nicks and cuts with any other product. On the plus side, the ingredients are natural, nontoxic and it has a pleasant aroma. I actually threw this stuff in the trash. I&#x27;m currently using Aubrey Organics shave cream and it works much better for me.</li>
    <li> I USE THIS PRODUCT ON MY SKIN AS A PRE SHAVE CREAM FOR EXTRA LUBRICATION WHEN USING A DOUBLE EDGE SAFETY RAZOR. THE DOUBLE EDGE SYSTEM TENDS TO TAKE MORE SKIN OF THE FACE THEN ONE THE POPULAR TRIPLE BLADE THROW- AWAYS. WHEN I DO USE THE DOUBLE EDGE I PUT THIS SHAVE CREAM ON OVER WET SKIN THAN I BRUSH ON PORASCO SHAVE CREAM OVER THAT. I GET  A FANTASTIC SHAVE , LESS IRRITATION AND A REAL SOFT SKIN FEE AFTERWARDS.</li>
    <li> Really wish I could recommend this shave cream as I usually love all Alba Botanica products, but unfortunately this shave cream just doesn&#x27;t work very well. It is way too thick and clogs up the razor. It basically has the consistency of a rich thick hand cream, so not good for shaving. I used it exactly according to directions: apply small amount all over legs and rinse razor frequently, and my razor still kept getting clogged up. It&#x27;s frustrating to try and get a close-up shave with a razor that&#x27;s constantly clogged, and I felt like I had to get a bran new razor everytime. I have to say that the Alba Botanica shave FOAM works much better, because it&#x27;s a foam the razor glides much smoother.</li>
    <li> This product smells pretty bad and got stuck in my razor before any of my hair did -- it was so thick it clogged the razor! Threw it out after the first time I tried it and finished shaving with soap. I would not recommend</li>
    <li> Bought for my husband.  He really likes it.  Nice smell is a plus</li>
    <li> Amazing product! I wont be going back to aerosol shave cream, ever.</li>
    <li> The best shaving cream I&#x27;ve found.  I wanted something that was thick enough like the cans but in a bottle that wouldn&#x27;t rust and stop working.  Great smell, all natural, no parabens, and no rash on my bikini area.  I have sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t irritate.</li>
    <li> I hate shaving foam and the Skintimate cream at Walmart, so I looked up top rated shaving cream on Amazon. This was it! I was so impressed by the smell, the way it clings to your skin and doesn&#x27;t end up wasted down the shower drain, the no metal no rust tube and the cool refreshing soft feeling my legs had after using this product. It washes away clean and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin. Also I noticed a closer shave especially under my arms where I never could get all the hair until now. I plan to give this as a gift to my female friends because it is that good!</li>
    <li> I absolutly love this shaving cream. I always had knicks and cuts which traditional shaving creams. With this shaving cream I rarely rarley get cuts and my legs are so soft afterwards. It kind of feels like a lotion. The only negative thing I can think of is that it tends to clog the razor easily.</li>
    <li> I have never been happier when trying someone else&#x27;s shaving cream in the shower! They had the mango vanilla and I instantly fell in love! Immediately after, I went on Amazon and found my very own container of Alba. You don&#x27;t need to use a lot, your skin feels great afterwards, no razor burn, no ingrown hairs, no cuts....I am so in love with this product! One container of this stuff lasts you a very long time. I LOVE it!!</li>
    <li> I bought this product last weekend and am sorely disappointed in it. Literally. It did a terrible job of providing lubrication between my skin and the blade of the razor. I nicked myself several times quite badly, and found myself with a red sludge on my face. For whom would this work? Maybe a 15 year-old boy with peach fuzz...but anyone who has to remove a real beard may be better off with soap and water.</li>
    <li> I just recently picked three new shave creams/gels to compare against The Art of Shaving. Art of Shaving being the undisputed champion. Gillette Foamy Regular being the baseline of just acceptable. Here is the breakdown:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First thing is the tool. I have tried the 4 blade Schick and the Mach3 and Fusion. I always return to my trusty Gillette Sensor3 Conditioning[green] disposable. Post shave I use Art of Shaving aftershave [Lemon or Sandalwood]. It runs about $30 a bottle which may seem high but I have been using the same two bottles for over two years. Two pumps is all you need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The Art of Shaving is by far the best. It also costs the most. For the money spent it doesn&#x27;t disappoint. It goes on easy with a light coat. It shaves very well and leaves your face feeling soft and nourished from all the conditioners/essential oils it contains. Normally I would scoff at paying $25 for a six month tub of shaving cream [I shave about 3x a week]. But this stuff is really that damn good. It exceeds expectations and then some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Alba Very Emollient Shave Cream Coconut Lime - This is the next best thing to Art of Shaving. Excellent shave. Very good skin conditioners. The scent is really nice. Finish it off with Art of Shaving Lemon aftershave. And at a price that is 1/4 of Art of Shaving. This one is definitely worth a look. BIG WARNING: The only negatives about this product is that: A) it clogs up the razor more than most B) is also slightly sticky which some may find annoying and C) is difficult to clear clogs as a result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.5) Nivea For Men delivers a nice shave. Feels smooth afterwards. It lathers a good amount which is good if you like that. I am now a low foam or no foam fan. It doesn&#x27;t leave your face as conditioned as the top two performers but does a decent job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) Kiss My Face Moisture Shave Bamboo Green Tea - This shave cream is not that much better than Gillette Foamy. Certainly not enough to justify the difference in cost. If you are looking for a fantastic shave you need to look elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line - If you want Ferrarri performance you have to pay top dollar. Here is my car/shave cream analogy:&lt;br /&gt;Ferrarri - Art of Shaving&lt;br /&gt;BMW/Audi - Very Emollient&lt;br /&gt;Honda - Nivea&lt;br /&gt;Chevrolet - Kiss My Face&lt;br /&gt;Pontiac - Gillette Foamyshave you need to look elsewhere.  Bottom line - If you want Ferrarri performance you have to pay top dollar. Here is my car/shave cream analogy: Ferrarri - Art of Shaving BMW/Audi - Very Emollient Honda - Nivea Chevrolet - Kiss My Face Pontiac - Gillette Foamy</li>
    <li> Best shave I&#x27;ve ever had. Bonus points for being cruelty free!</li>
    <li> So far this is my favorite shave cream I have used (and I used Creamo for a while). Nice close hydrating shave and you don&#x27;t have to use much!</li>
    <li> Best shave cream out there!!</li>
    <li> This smells very odd and artificial and if you look at the list of ingredients you know why, it&#x27;s loaded with stuff and there&#x27;s no way this is hypo allergenic because there are some pretty common allergens in there like citrus, nuts, etc.  I don&#x27;t have any allergies, but the claim is disingenuous and I don&#x27;t want some dad or mom shaving with this and then hugging their bubble child.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do detect notes of lime, but it is actually overpowered by a distinct mint smell which was unexpected and gives it an odd fragrance.  Natural citrus scents usually do not linger very well, coconut oil smells very mild and both need an anchor scent to hold them which is probably why the mint was put in there and explains why it is so dominant compared to the other two scents, but it&#x27;s just overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had my wife smell this and the first thing she mentioned was mint as well.  I&#x27;m not a big fan of mint so I&#x27;ll probably give this to someone I dislike for Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave 2 stars instead of 1 as a gesture of good will that the cream might be good, but the smell is so odd I won&#x27;t be using it and if you don&#x27;t like mint or odd smells then I&#x27;d suggest you avoid this and maybe try another product or another fragrance.  Maybe I&#x27;ll try the vanilla and mango, but I&#x27;m worried about it smelling like a salmon steak or something else odd and unexpected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the price I won&#x27;t bother returning it, but I won&#x27;t be buy it again either.  Merry Xmas present to my sister in law or brother in law since I&#x27;m out of 10 year old fruit cake.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Alba Botanica shave cream in the past and I really liked it.  I bought this on sale at the grocery store and it does give a close shave, but when I put it on my hands to apply to my legs it sucks ALL the moisture out of my hands and makes it very uncomfortable feeling! It makes my hands feel like they&#x27;ve been sitting in acetone.  I never had this issue with this product or any of the other scents in the past so I&#x27;m not sure if I got a bad bottle or if there&#x27;s something new in the formula that&#x27;s affecting my skin.</li>
