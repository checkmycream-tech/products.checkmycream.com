      <li>A nice tool for the skin...</li>
      <li>but I haven&#x27;t seen any improvements in my skin just a nice relaxation from this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The material isn&#x27;t soft and flexible, but it does an excellent job of massaging serums and creams into my skin.</li>
      <li>Even works great on back, very strong!</li>
      <li>Gives skin a lovely glow.</li>
      <li>so I could get a better massage on the jaw joints.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay.  </li>
      <li>Love the way it works; leaves my skin glowing</li>
      <li>My dog and cat love it</li>
      <li>I also have a smooth one that I like better.</li>
      <li>I like it, but I like the smooth one better.</li>
      <li>Also Plumps lips which is a huge bonus.</li>
      <li>There are a lot of great videos out there that demonstrate how to do facial massage with your fingers.</li>
      <li>Great for facial muscles too.</li>
      <li>Although it did not feel as good as my old one</li>
      <li>but this massager is actually very sturdy  and strong.</li>
      <li>It was fun</li>
      <li>so far i&#x27;m enjoying</li>
      <li>At first I did not really think this was as good as another plastic massager I have already got</li>
      <li>I use it everyday now and it feels good on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Works good for all the small body parts</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really know if this really helps to absorb the moisturizer to make it work more effectively but to tell you the truth after I put the moisturizer and roll this on my face the moisturizer after a little time starts to flake out, Its really the moisturizer fault really not the product</li>
      <li>This tool is also rubbery and it would require constant cleaning to feel comfortable rubbing it on your face.</li>
      <li>In the evening once I put on my night cream I focused on my whole face using upward motion</li>
      <li>Great little roller for scalp (careful with hair)</li>
      <li>I know that increased circulation has a beneficial effect on skin, so I think this unique little roller can be worth the modest $$ outlay.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It could be because I don&#x27;t really use it that often nor has it been to long since I first used it.</li>
      <li>I bought a couple of these for stocking stuffers for the mature women in our family, and when we opened these, everyone wanted to borrow them and try them.</li>
      <li>I picked mine up from a departmental store in Hong Kong and it felt much nicer on the face than the Body shop massager but the plastic one did not last very long at long</li>

    <li> A nice tool for the skin...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure it did anything to change my tone/texture but it felt nice!  A good way to relax and relieve sinus pressure.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay.  Nothing to write home about</li>
    <li> Good article, happy with my purchase and happy with the seller because the package I get perfect and good time!</li>
    <li> At first I did not really think this was as good as another plastic massager I have already got but after my old plastic massager was broken and I re-discovered that the Body shop massager was sitting on my bathroom shelf, so I started using it. Although it did not feel as good as my old one but this massager is actually very sturdy  and strong. I use it everyday now and it feels good on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I published this review, I found the plastic massage I had from Amazon too, it is named: Japanese Facial Massager Roller. I did not buy that from Amazon. I picked mine up from a departmental store in Hong Kong and it felt much nicer on the face than the Body shop massager but the plastic one did not last very long at long ( I bought two and both had the same result). I did glue them back but they keep coming off.</li>
    <li> The material isn&#x27;t soft and flexible, but it does an excellent job of massaging serums and creams into my skin.</li>
    <li> This turned out to be a waste of money. I have used it a few times, and didn&#x27;t feel like I was doing anything productive. Now it collects dust in  my medicine cabinet. There are a lot of great videos out there that demonstrate how to do facial massage with your fingers. I would recommend looking at those instead. This tool is also rubbery and it would require constant cleaning to feel comfortable rubbing it on your face.</li>
    <li> Good tool for people who are teeth grinders or clenchers. I wish the spikey parts were a little longer and harder so I could get a better massage on the jaw joints.</li>
    <li> I like it, but I like the smooth one better. I don&#x27;t know if I see any improvement after 4 months but I do like that it feels good. I also have a smooth one that I like better.</li>
    <li> I bought a couple of these for stocking stuffers for the mature women in our family, and when we opened these, everyone wanted to borrow them and try them. To my surprise, even the husbands seemed to wish they had one of their own, and everyone loved how it felt.  I know that increased circulation has a beneficial effect on skin, so I think this unique little roller can be worth the modest $$ outlay.</li>
    <li> Even works great on back, very strong!</li>
    <li> I have less noticeable forehead lines and overall my skin feels tighter.  Here is what I did so maybe it would work for others:&lt;br /&gt;-  I used this day and night.&lt;br /&gt;-  In the evening once I put on my night cream I focused on my whole face using upward motion&lt;br /&gt;-  in the day time after I lotion I only did it on my forehead&lt;br /&gt;-  I did this for 3 weeks night and day, I didn&#x27;t skip any days</li>
    <li> read about this tool on another website.  Love the way it works; leaves my skin glowing</li>
    <li> I just want to say I don&#x27;t like this thing, because I owned one that I got in store, I used it for about 2 months and one day the head part screwed off as I was using it and I scratched my face with the metal bar underneath. :( I wouldn&#x27;t ever repurchase it for that reason. It was fun while it lasted, maybe it&#x27;s not intended to last that long.</li>
    <li> Wakes up your face!  Gives skin a lovely glow. I will need to use it longer to see if it does any &#x27;Lifting&#x27;. Also Plumps lips which is a huge bonus. I have noticed a difference in their appearance and someone asked if I had injections!!</li>
    <li> Great little roller for scalp (careful with hair) I use on scalp when I leave oil on scalp over night. The oiled down hair keeps loose ends from getting caught up around end. Great for facial muscles too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed with this product because the far edge of the roller has a sharp edge. No matter how I manuever the device, it scratches my face. The quality assurance on these products must not have been looking for flaws like this, because the product is unusable as it is. I should trow it in the trash, because it&#x27;s just gathering dust on my counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would not recommend to buy online, try in the store to ensure that the product doesn&#x27;t hurt your face.</li>
    <li> Works good for all the small body parts the big ones can&#x27;t do like you fingers and face.</li>
    <li> My dog and cat love it</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really know if this really helps to absorb the moisturizer to make it work more effectively but to tell you the truth after I put the moisturizer and roll this on my face the moisturizer after a little time starts to flake out, Its really the moisturizer fault really not the product but I haven&#x27;t seen any improvements in my skin just a nice relaxation from this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It could be because I don&#x27;t really use it that often nor has it been to long since I first used it.</li>
    <li> I like it so far i&#x27;m enjoying i realy don&#x27;t know if it work but loving it for know i think its good to have.</li>
