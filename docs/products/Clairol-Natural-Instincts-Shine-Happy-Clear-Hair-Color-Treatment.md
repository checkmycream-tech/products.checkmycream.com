### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>For blondes with regrowth though, it is awesome!</li>
      <li>this sounds great!</li>
      <li>It feels great, looks great, smells great...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d read reviews about Shine Happy stating that it didn&#x27;t work well</li>
      <li>Shine Happy did make my hair shiny but not</li>
      <li>I found Shine Happy and thought, why not give it a try?</li>
      <li>and the conditioner smelled absolutely amazing!</li>
      <li>Yes it does lighten it somewhat but it looks good on me.</li>
      <li>3/5 stars for not doing anything amazing, but not ruining my hair either.</li>
      <li>That said, I really liked this product.     </li>
      <li>When I use Natural Instincts to color my hair it does a great job and gives me GREAT shine</li>
      <li>The conditioner is wonderful, and will make your hair soft.     </li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>then it felt somewhat better.  </li>
      <li>I used the condition that comes in the box, and my hair felt slightly better.  </li>
      <li>so i figured i was safe.</li>
      <li>Relying on a glowing review from a famous talk show star&#x27;s magazine, I decided to give this a try.  </li>
      <li>I have medium brown, undyed, healthy hair.  </li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t tell if it had lightened some parts of my hair, or if I was just imagining things because I had read so many reviews about that problem.</li>
      <li>but i would like to have more of course</li>
      <li>I love using this because it makes my regrowth blend perfectly into my highlights for cheap, while enhancing the shine at the same time.</li>
      <li>Shine happy put a layer of dullness over my hair that lead to complete un-manageability.  </li>
      <li>Nowadays I have light blond highlights throughout my hair</li>
      <li>I figured it could always be more shiny, right?  </li>
      <li>I thought, what the heck I&#x27;ll be happy if I can add some extra shine to my otherwise long and attractive hair.  </li>
      <li>I was really excited about this product; I just dyed my hair a month ago and it was already looking quite drab.  </li>
      <li>This product DOES contain peroxide, so I made sure I followed the instructions exactly.</li>
      <li>I originally used this when I didn&#x27;t have highlights and it made my hair noticably shinier.</li>
      <li>My sister (with yellow-blond hair) loved this product, so I tried it expecting the same.</li>
      <li>I turned a few of my coworkers onto Shine Happy recently and they loved it too.</li>
      <li>and I have pretty healthy reasonably shiny hair to begin with, but</li>
      <li>Not to mention, especially in the sunlight, it appeared almost orange at the top!  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t usually look this good unless I&#x27;m walking out of a salon!</li>
      <li>My guess is those that have natural hair color that is not color treated will benefit most from this product.    </li>
      <li>I LOVE Clairol Natural Instincts</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the price or the energy.</li>
      <li>I used it exactly as instructed.  </li>
      <li>I waited the exact 10 minutes and i washed it out..</li>
      <li>My hair looks so much healthier!</li>
      <li>First off, READ THE INSTRUCTIONS.</li>
      <li>Thanks alot clairol..please pull this item!</li>
      <li>It goes on exactly like hair dye, even though the box says something about being used just like shampoo.</li>
      <li>For the first several days I felt like my hair was reflecting sunlight better</li>
      <li>I would definitely recommend this product to someone who has overprocessed hair. :)</li>
      <li>Had I read reviews first</li>
      <li>For the first week or so after using, it makes it easier to straighten my curly/wavy locks.  </li>
      <li>In fact, I am constantly complimented on how shiny and healthy my hair is.  </li>
      <li>I thought this product worked pretty well.</li>
      <li>I loved my natural hair color but thought I would give it a little pampering just for the heck of it.  </li>
      <li>However, after I conditioned it, my hair felt much smoother.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t do any visible damage to my hair, but I&#x27;d rather have spent the money on a better product.  </li>
      <li>As for what it is intended for...shine...it did not do much.</li>
      <li>If it weren&#x27;t for the intense conditioner</li>
      <li>The real test did not come until after blow drying/straightening to see if it made a difference.</li>
      <li>I really wanted a glossy shine to my hair and decided to try this.  </li>
      <li>I dye my hair, straighten and style it regularly...and that process has really done a number on the health and appearance of my hair.</li>
      <li>This is not what I wanted and I am really, really upset.</li>
      <li>but I really like it,</li>
      <li>It has become frizzy, unmanageable, and the ends were beginning to look very frail.</li>
      <li>Well that didn&#x27;t really happen.  </li>
      <li>In the hot new product section.  </li>
      <li>Spots that had the most shine were areas of my head that were closer to my scalp where natural oil occurs such as: the underneath layer, front bang pieces, and my natural roots.    </li>
      <li>people are more likely to be motivated to review a product if it did NOT work for them, rather than the latter.</li>
      <li>My hair is deffinitly shiner then usual and the glaze lighted up my color a little more which was nice.</li>
      <li>i would recomend this product to someone lik me with dead very light hair.</li>
      <li>I wanted a change without dying my hair, I just wanted high shine.</li>
      <li>Something I don&#x27;t normally do..</li>
      <li>It felt normal.</li>
      <li>Hopefully in a few weeks I wont be able to see roots growing out.</li>
      <li>but after just a few washings I found my hair had less shine than before the Shine Happy treatment.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s very fine and dull.</li>
      <li>I have dark brown dyed hair, (naturally light brown)</li>
      <li>It contains peroxide, which will lift your natural color!</li>
      <li>I have long fine but thick very straight naturally light brown/dark blonde hair.  </li>
      <li>My hair is no shinier, and seems a little more coarse than before.  </li>
      <li>If it lightened my mousy light brown hair it was imperceptibly.  </li>
      <li>I do not use any coloring products in my hair, and have naturally blond hair, so maybe it has to do with color?  </li>
      <li>WOW</li>
      <li>so naturally I was excited to see this product on the market promising to take the dull out of my hair</li>
      <li>I tried the Happy Shine, my hair became very coarse and stiff, I had to put deep conditioner in my hair three times that evening before it was renewed to being a little soft again.</li>
      <li>Dying your hair opens the cuticles and deposits the color, making each strand a little denser and on my fine hair it makes a BIG difference.  </li>
      <li>Although its hard to tell if its really shine or my medium ashy blond hair with now golden highlights.</li>
      <li>also, i think it made my hair even more dull!</li>
      <li>Upon using this product I had 1/4 inch of natural growth that is medium brown/red with some natural blonde highlights.</li>
      <li>My hair is actually much softer than usual and there is a little more shine.</li>
      <li>My hair: Completely color treated, golden blonde with some brassiness due to my natural red color.  </li>
      <li>it blends my grown out blonde with my natural ash brown well.</li>
      <li>and Clairol apparently has done nothing to improve this product.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve thought of dying it back to my natural color</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure my hair would feel even worse.   </li>
      <li>I have thick, light brown hair that had not been colored, processed, etc.</li>
      <li>I air dry my hair normally, so that is what I did after the application of this product.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s been 2 months since my experience with Shine happy crap, and you can see a 1 inch part of my natural hair that is growing in.  </li>
      <li>My hair is already red and it didn&#x27;t change my hair&#x27;s color unlike other reviewers, but it didn&#x27;t really do anything.  </li>

<li> The only thing that worried me was when I washed it out--my hair felt somewhat dry, as though I had just dyed it.</li>
<li> so i left the conditioner on extra long, mixed it with some watered down gotb crazy sleek (which i also added blue and purple dye to to tone down my yellow)blow dried it and then put on a good deal of argan oil and straightend it.</li>
<li> I have very dark brown hair naturally, without any color product on my hair.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This was an impulse buy while shopping for hair coloring for my daughter.  I thought, what the heck I&#x27;ll be happy if I can add some extra shine to my otherwise long and attractive hair.  Well that didn&#x27;t really happen.  For the first several days I felt like my hair was reflecting sunlight better but after just a few washings I found my hair had less shine than before the Shine Happy treatment.  Then I come to find out that people have reported unsatisfactory results for years and Clairol apparently has done nothing to improve this product.  Pretty disappointing Clairol.</li>
    <li> I have long fine but thick very straight naturally light brown/dark blonde hair.  I originally used this when I didn&#x27;t have highlights and it made my hair noticably shinier. This did not make my hair feel dry at all and the conditioner smelled absolutely amazing! Nowadays I have light blond highlights throughout my hair and I notice that my regrowth seems very dark. I love using this because it makes my regrowth blend perfectly into my highlights for cheap, while enhancing the shine at the same time. Yes it does lighten it somewhat but it looks good on me. I guess I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for someone with dark hair who is looking for shine. For them I would recommend a celephane treatment at a salon. For blondes with regrowth though, it is awesome!</li>
    <li> This is NOT a treatment that will make your hair healthier! It contains peroxide, which will lift your natural color! DEFINITELY stay away from this if you want your virgin hair to remain undamaged.</li>
    <li> What a ripoff!  Had I read reviews first I would have tossed the box in the trash without opening.  How dare they continue to sell this.  Bad enough my hair has NO shine whatsoever the color looks like it does when I need to recolor my hair.  I waited 3 weeks, which is how long you must wait before using this product after coloring your hair, going through the same arduous process as coloring and I have nothing to show for it except lighter hair and that&#x27;s not what I wanted!  I could feel how brittle and dry my hair was immediately after I rinsed. If it weren&#x27;t for the intense conditioner I&#x27;m sure my hair would feel even worse.   I don&#x27;t know if this product works differently on non-color treated hair but if you color I advise not using it.</li>
    <li> I have reddish brown hair(colored). My hair had some shine but i would like to have more of course so i picked this off the shelf going WOW this sounds great! WRONG!!!!! I came home all excited(lol) and read the directions as i have never used anything quite like this. Do not use if you have colored in the last 3-4 weeks..well it has been 7 weeks since coloring the last time so i figured i was safe. WRONG AGAIN!!!!!!! I put it on..the smell wasn&#x27;t too bad and while on it seemed all shiny..i was like yeahhhh. I waited the exact 10 minutes and i washed it out..it automatically felt crunchy. I put the conditioner they give you in and it did help a little. I got out dried it and WHAT A MESS!! My hair is a orangy blob...very lifeless..and even less shiny than before. Now i have to go to a salon to fix the mess. Thanks alot clairol..please pull this item!</li>
    <li> I have dark brown dyed hair, (naturally light brown) and it&#x27;s very fine and dull. So i thought this product would make it shinier and healthier looking. WRONG!! it turned my hair dirty blonde on certain patches! Now my hair is all uneven colored! also, i think it made my hair even more dull! I AM SO MAD</li>
    <li> I have medium brown, undyed, healthy hair.  I bought this hoping for a little extra shine.  It was a kit similar to a hair dye.  I used it exactly as instructed.  My hair is no shinier, and seems a little more coarse than before.  It may have lightened my hair one shade but it&#x27;s hard to tell.  This product was a disappointment and I will never buy it again.</li>
    <li> This product is definitely not worth the money or effort to try.  My hair is already red and it didn&#x27;t change my hair&#x27;s color unlike other reviewers, but it didn&#x27;t really do anything.  My hair is no shinier as the package promised.  It didn&#x27;t do any visible damage to my hair, but I&#x27;d rather have spent the money on a better product.  Try something different if you want smoother and shinier hair - this one&#x27;s a dud.</li>
    <li> I saw this stuff at the drug store so many times and walked by because I was skeptical, but today I decided to give it a whirl.  It was a lot like \\&quot;dying\\&quot; my hair.  Something I don&#x27;t normally do.. and I have pretty healthy reasonably shiny hair to begin with, but I figured it could always be more shiny, right?  So I tried it.  My hair felt crunchy and wierd while I was washing it out and I put the conditioner in.. then it felt somewhat better.  Well.. my hair is now LESS shiny than it was before!!!  I am a natural redhead so if it did add any orange to my hair like the other reviewers, I wouldn&#x27;t notice.  However it took shine AWAY!!  I am not happy.  DON&#x27;T BUY THIS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> I thought this product worked pretty well. i have awful hair, its really fried because i have naturally blak hair and i get it bleached to be as white as possible. My hair did feel a little dry after putting the glaze on so i left the conditioner on extra long, mixed it with some watered down gotb crazy sleek (which i also added blue and purple dye to to tone down my yellow)blow dried it and then put on a good deal of argan oil and straightend it. My hair is deffinitly shiner then usual and the glaze lighted up my color a little more which was nice. i might use this product again but i might try a different one too. the results for me are noticable but not drastic. i would recomend this product to someone lik me with dead very light hair.</li>
    <li> After reading horrible reviews regarding this product, I decided to go ahead and try it.    My hair: Completely color treated, golden blonde with some brassiness due to my natural red color.  Upon using this product I had 1/4 inch of natural growth that is medium brown/red with some natural blonde highlights. My hair is long. It&#x27;s been two months since I have dyed my roots.     Results: NO CHANGE in hair color on my color treated hair or my roots. This product did not lighten my hair. My hair did feel softer, there was no damage, and it did reduce total frizz. It did fill in my dull ends that needed a trim, and made them fuller and softer.     Shine: If you are looking for commercial grade shine, this isn&#x27;t the product that will produce mega watt shine. Spots that had the most shine were areas of my head that were closer to my scalp where natural oil occurs such as: the underneath layer, front bang pieces, and my natural roots.    Conditioner: The conditioner is wonderful, and will make your hair soft.     My guess is those that have natural hair color that is not color treated will benefit most from this product.    Would I use this product again? Yes, but not for a while since it DOES contain peroxide and can damage hair.</li>
    <li> The problem with online reviews about beauty products is that 9 times out of 10 they will be negative...people are more likely to be motivated to review a product if it did NOT work for them, rather than the latter. Haven&#x27;t you noticed this trend?    That said, I really liked this product.     I dye my hair, straighten and style it regularly...and that process has really done a number on the health and appearance of my hair. It has become frizzy, unmanageable, and the ends were beginning to look very frail. So, I&#x27;ve been experimenting with different things to see if it could improve the condition of my hair.    I found Shine Happy and thought, why not give it a try? I trust Natural Instincts products, and worst case scenario, it will wash out in a few weeks. What do I have to lose, my hair is already a mess! The product did not have an ostentatious odor, which assured me that I wasn&#x27;t putting too harsh of chemicals in my hair. The only thing that worried me was when I washed it out--my hair felt somewhat dry, as though I had just dyed it. However, after I conditioned it, my hair felt much smoother. The real test did not come until after blow drying/straightening to see if it made a difference. And the answer is...YES! My hair looks so much healthier! It doesn&#x27;t usually look this good unless I&#x27;m walking out of a salon! It feels great, looks great, smells great...and it did not alter my hair color at all. I would definitely recommend this product to someone who has overprocessed hair. :)</li>
    <li> I tried the Happy Shine, my hair became very coarse and stiff, I had to put deep conditioner in my hair three times that evening before it was renewed to being a little soft again. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I figured when I bought this product that it would be just a gloss of some sort, I was wrong. It contains peroxide and I didn&#x27;t realize this until i had already torn the box open. What the heck lets do this! My hair is actually much softer than usual and there is a little more shine. Although its hard to tell if its really shine or my medium ashy blond hair with now golden highlights. Considering how unpredictable this product is on different hair types I don&#x27;t recommend it. Hopefully in a few weeks I wont be able to see roots growing out. Buyer beware--get a shine serum instead.</li>
    <li> My sister (with yellow-blond hair) loved this product, so I tried it expecting the same. I have ashy blonde-brown hair. It bleached my hair into this awful shade of orange-red. Terrible!  There should be a warning on it!  I&#x27;ll be complaining to clairol.</li>
    <li> I curse this product every time I look in the mirror.  I loved my natural hair color but thought I would give it a little pampering just for the heck of it.  My hair lightened about 2 shades and has a gross orange hue to it and I feel like my hair is weaker now.  This was almost a year ago and I&#x27;m still trying to grow it out (it&#x27;s long) and it will take me a long time.  I&#x27;ve thought of dying it back to my natural color but I&#x27;m scared since all the dyes I see have peroxide (which is what this product has that ruined my hair) so I don&#x27;t know what to do.  I guess I&#x27;ll just wait until it has all grown out and take hair multi-vitamins in the meantime.</li>
    <li> Relying on a glowing review from a famous talk show star&#x27;s magazine, I decided to give this a try.  DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT.  This product turned my hair into a dry dull orange bush.  Not only did it not provide shine, it did the polar opposite.  Now I am growing out a rough orange mat of hair that was only made worse by trying to dye it natural black again with another product.  I could not comb through my hair.  It became fragile, wispy and prone to heavy duty breakage.  Shine happy put a layer of dullness over my hair that lead to complete un-manageability.  This product should be removed from the market.</li>
    <li> I have average-shiny hair, so I got this hoping it would add some pop.  It definitely lightened my hair a little like others said, but I acutally like the lightening...it blends my grown out blonde with my natural ash brown well. As for what it is intended for...shine...it did not do much. My hair looks the same shinyness.  I would not buy this again, but it didn&#x27;t ruin my hair as others said.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m truly surprised at all the negative reviews.  I&#x27;ve used this product at least 10 times in my hair and have never had a single problem.  In fact, I am constantly complimented on how shiny and healthy my hair is.  I do not use any coloring products in my hair, and have naturally blond hair, so maybe it has to do with color?  Not sure, but I really like it, and I think it gives my hair a boost of body too.</li>
    <li> I have used this product a handful of times over the past few years.  I love it.  I used to have highlights but now I do not color my hair at all.  Either way, I have never had and issue and it cuts down on the frizz. For the first week or so after using, it makes it easier to straighten my curly/wavy locks.  It does increase the shine and it maybe made my hair look just a touch darker (I am dark to medium blond).  I turned a few of my coworkers onto Shine Happy recently and they loved it too.</li>
    <li> I LOVE Clairol Natural Instincts so naturally I was excited to see this product on the market promising to take the dull out of my hair the 40&#x27;s have seem to bring.  While I don&#x27;t have a horror story about a color change, I am disappointed it did absolutely nothing.  I had my hair highlighted a month ago and wanted to give it a little boost.  When I use Natural Instincts to color my hair it does a great job and gives me GREAT shine so I expected the same from this product, just without the color but I got nothing.</li>
    <li> Although I&#x27;m not proud, I have been using various hair dyes and box treatments for over 15 years.  I was really excited about this product; I just dyed my hair a month ago and it was already looking quite drab.  My hair is naturally very dark brown (stylists call it a 4), but at the moment, before the shine treatment, it was medium brown with red and orange tones.  After following all instructions on the box, as I always do, I rinsed my hair to find it lighter than before.  Not to mention, especially in the sunlight, it appeared almost orange at the top!  I was already unhappy with the reddish tones carried in my hair and to accentuate those tones with bright orange only made it worse.  I could understand how those with naturally cool hair colors could use this product and essentially benefit, but unfortunately, I feel as if anyone with naturally warm hair might be unhappy with their results.</li>
    <li> I wanted a change without dying my hair, I just wanted high shine. I followed the directions, my hair is dark brown, and now it&#x27;s a reddish brown. Ugh! This is not what I wanted and I am really, really upset. If you want shine without the extra garbage like red, or blond highlights do not get this!! What a disappointment!</li>
    <li> 3/5 stars for not doing anything amazing, but not ruining my hair either. Details below!    If I had read the reviews for this product before I bought it, I probably wouldn&#x27;t have. But, I had already picked out out from the store so I figured I would take my chances (the rest of the reviews I read elsewhere were 50/50).    First off, READ THE INSTRUCTIONS. They have a lot of dos and don&#x27;ts. This product DOES contain peroxide, so I made sure I followed the instructions exactly. If you have hair that is prone to turn brassy when lightened, maybe you shouldn&#x27;t use this. I have thick, light brown hair that had not been colored, processed, etc. and don&#x27;t know what other people have, or if that even makes a difference. I had not shampooed my hair for two days before I used this product. It goes on exactly like hair dye, even though the box says something about being used just like shampoo. I left it on for 10 minutes, like the box says.    In the shower my hair did not feel frizzy, poofy, coarse, crunchy, or anything else. It felt normal. I got out of the shower, towel dried my hair some, and the blow-dried it. I couldn&#x27;t tell if it had lightened some parts of my hair, or if I was just imagining things because I had read so many reviews about that problem. Either way, it&#x27;s a few days later and I can&#x27;t tell the difference. My hair looked shiny, but nothing out of a magazine or anything.    It&#x27;s almost a week later and while my hair still looks shiny, it doesn&#x27;t make me want to stop at mirrors and admire it. So, again, three stars because I did not have problems with it but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the price or the energy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d read reviews about Shine Happy stating that it didn&#x27;t work well and/or that it lightened hair but decided to try it anyway if only for the thickening effect.  Dying your hair opens the cuticles and deposits the color, making each strand a little denser and on my fine hair it makes a BIG difference.  Shine Happy did make my hair shiny but not like you&#x27;d get from a leave-in glossing product like [[ASIN:B0030GFXMQ Fekkai Glossing Cream, 4-Ounces Tube]].  After washing &amp; conditioning my hair I use cold water to rinse, this helps boost the shine.  It did make my hair a little thicker.  If it lightened my mousy light brown hair it was imperceptibly.  The product advises that using it every 4 weeks will build up the shine.  I&#x27;ve purchased two boxes and will do another application at the 4 week mark.  All in all, if you&#x27;re not expecting salon-quality results and want the thickening effect, I&#x27;d recommend this.</li>
    <li> I read about this product in Allure magazine.  In the hot new product section.  I have very dark brown hair naturally, without any color product on my hair.  I really wanted a glossy shine to my hair and decided to try this.  While rinsing it out after the allotted time on my hair per the directions, my hair felt strange, not sure how to describe it.  Almost like I had put alcohol on my hair.  I used the condition that comes in the box, and my hair felt slightly better.  After towel drying, my hair felt straw-like.  I air dry my hair normally, so that is what I did after the application of this product.  After my hair dried, IT WAS A STRANGE ORANGE COLOR!!!   A lighter version of my hair with a orange tint!  It&#x27;s been 2 months since my experience with Shine happy crap, and you can see a 1 inch part of my natural hair that is growing in.  I am planning on going to a salon soon to have my hair colored all the same.  AVOID THIS PRODUCT!!!</li>
