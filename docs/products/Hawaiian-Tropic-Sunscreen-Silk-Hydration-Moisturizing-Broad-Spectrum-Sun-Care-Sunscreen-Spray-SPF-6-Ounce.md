### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>If you have to wear makeup this product is a perfect sun screen because you just spray it on after your makeup application.</li>
      <li>It is like the best of both worlds- moisture and sun protection in one.</li>
      <li>Great if you want a tan but don&#x27;t want to burn and then tan.</li>
      <li>Great product.  </li>
      <li>works great, not oily.  </li>
      <li>great price</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s very light: great sunscreen!</li>
      <li>What you would expect from a good sunscreen lotion.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not greasy and it smell good.</li>
      <li>Love this sunscreen!  </li>
      <li>I love Hawaiian Tropic!</li>
      <li>Lightweight, non greasy, easy to use sunscreen at a great price.</li>
      <li>Love the smell (got some compliments for it even!), love the spray function, it&#x27;s not too oily, really good to just spray it on and walk out of the house when in a hurry.</li>
      <li>We love this spray - works great, no sun burn and we love the coconut smell, as opposed to just some spray.</li>
      <li>I love this brand of sunscreen because it smells good</li>
      <li>Good for sun but goes out very quickly</li>
      <li>I use this for tanning and having very light skin</li>
      <li>I love the ease of using a spray, but I feel the lotion covers better and lasts longer.</li>
      <li>This a go-to favorite sunscreen.</li>
      <li>i love the way this stuff smells.</li>
      <li>smells great, feels sticky at first but seems to fade quickly as for the Spf I will have to wait till we get more sun</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s clean, easy to use, and effective.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a fine spray so most of the time I don&#x27;t even have to rub it in.  </li>
      <li>Most importantly, we don&#x27;t burn when wearing it.</li>
      <li>Light and easy to use.  </li>
      <li>This silk hydration is unique in my experience in that it provides both an even application and even after an hour of sun exposure has a &amp;#34;silkiness&amp;#34; (as it name implies) on my skin.</li>
      <li>The smell is nice enough.</li>
      <li>I like it very much.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s becoming increasingly hard to find SPF 15 at the local drug store, so its good to know I can always count on Amazon!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of Hawaiian Tropic products and an even bigger fan of Amazon Prime.</li>
      <li>Tropic is the best product not only for skin protection but smell - might waste 1/3 of the can by over spray but small price to pay to not smell like alcohol</li>
      <li>Its a little sticky when its first applied</li>

<li> but that goes away once it has dried.</li>

    <li> Love the smell (got some compliments for it even!), love the spray function, it&#x27;s not too oily, really good to just spray it on and walk out of the house when in a hurry. Sometimes I forget I even applied it, it&#x27;s very light: great sunscreen!</li>
    <li> We love this spray - works great, no sun burn and we love the coconut smell, as opposed to just some spray.</li>
    <li> This a go-to favorite sunscreen. It is like the best of both worlds- moisture and sun protection in one. My husband swears by this stuff and I like it as well.  Plus it has a spray to which helps a lot when it comes to application. I&#x27;ve never had one clog. I like it. It&#x27;s a fine spray so most of the time I don&#x27;t even have to rub it in.  Just spray and go!</li>
    <li> works great, not oily.  Stays on after being in the water</li>
    <li> Anytime I can avoid a trip to the store to pick up stuff like this, I save money because I tend to be prone to whimsy and go off list and over budget.  I love this brand of sunscreen because it smells good, it&#x27;s clean, easy to use, and effective.  I&#x27;m a huge fan of Hawaiian Tropic products and an even bigger fan of Amazon Prime.</li>
    <li> What you would expect from a good sunscreen lotion. I love Hawaiian Tropic!</li>
    <li> Most importantly, we don&#x27;t burn when wearing it. The smell is nice enough. My skin is no more &amp;#34;hydrated&amp;#34; than before I put it on...so much for hydration. I will probably buy store brand spray sunscreen going forward, as the smell and &amp;#34;hydration&amp;#34; value are not enough to pay a premium for something we use tons of.</li>
    <li> i love the way this stuff smells. Its a little sticky when its first applied but that goes away once it has dried.</li>
    <li> Tropic is the best product not only for skin protection but smell - might waste 1/3 of the can by over spray but small price to pay to not smell like alcohol</li>
    <li> Hawaiian Tropic is the second of my two favourite suncreen products. This silk hydration is unique in my experience in that it provides both an even application and even after an hour of sun exposure has a &amp;#34;silkiness&amp;#34; (as it name implies) on my skin. I like it very much.</li>
    <li> great price and it works saved almost 20 dollars buying it from amazon!</li>
    <li> When they say continuous spray, they MEAN CONTINUOUS SPRAY.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Used on vacation.  I love the ease of using a spray, but I feel the lotion covers better and lasts longer.</li>
    <li> Lightweight, non greasy, easy to use sunscreen at a great price. It&#x27;s becoming increasingly hard to find SPF 15 at the local drug store, so its good to know I can always count on Amazon!</li>
    <li> Good for sun but goes out very quickly</li>
    <li> If you have to wear makeup this product is a perfect sun screen because you just spray it on after your makeup application. It&#x27;s not greasy and it smell good.</li>
    <li> I use this for tanning and having very light skin I had no problems using this. I never burned once using a tanning booth. I don&#x27;t think it would work long term, of course, but short term it worked well.</li>
    <li> smells great, feels sticky at first but seems to fade quickly as for the Spf I will have to wait till we get more sun I got it for the scent</li>
    <li> Great if you want a tan but don&#x27;t want to burn and then tan. Will purchase again next summer.</li>
    <li> Love this sunscreen!  Light and easy to use.  Protects, yet allows me to get a gradual tan when I want one!</li>
