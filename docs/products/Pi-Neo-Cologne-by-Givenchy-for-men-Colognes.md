      <li>You are tempted to use a lot at the beginning, the smell is really nice but</li>
      <li>and I came across this particular one , I ordered it as a gift to a friend and the feedback i got for it was an excellent one !</li>
      <li>this will replace the Higher dior that I have, good price and lasts longer, and smells great</li>

      <li>, I need something more musky with some nice woody undertones.</li>
      <li>It has an awesome awesome light sweet scent, somewhat hard to describe, but the ladies seem to love it, as i get grabbed and sniffed a bunch when i put it on, lol.</li>
      <li>cologne smells pretty good not something I would use for very special occasions but is good for every day use.</li>

      <li>This was a fantastic deal!  </li>
      <li>I love the smell and so does everyone else.</li>
      <li>Women love this stuff.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a pretty pleasant scent-</li>
      <li>This is a nice crisp scent that lasts quite a while.</li>
      <li>Very pleased and highly recommend.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not a guy that uses much of this kind of stuff.</li>
      <li>Shipping was quick and price was significantly below what I have seen in retail stores.</li>
      <li>One true thing is that it is not an all day scent.</li>
      <li>scent is soft, but very strong in attracting women.</li>
      <li>good enough for me ;)</li>
      <li>Will definitely get more!</li>
      <li>Nonetheless, it is worth buying, and it does smell a bit like you just got out of the shower, but it isn&#x27;t an overbearing scent, either.</li>
      <li>I feel like it doesn&#x27;t smell like the most masculine scent,</li>
      <li>i think i made a right choice.</li>
      <li>You got to the right place to buy this perfume.  </li>
      <li>but my husband wanted to start using it right away</li>
      <li>When I saw the price on Amazon, I ordered it right away hoping it was legitimate, and it was.</li>
      <li>def best kept secret ;)</li>
      <li>I would recommend this product highly as PI Neo has a fabulous smell.  </li>
      <li>Thank you very much.</li>
      <li>This is for that pretty frat kid.</li>
      <li>This is my first one from givenchy</li>
      <li>Love the smell of this on my husband, have been buying for several years.</li>
      <li>He has others as well, but always love it when he has this one on, and the smell is very lasting.</li>
      <li>Parfume would be a better choice than toilet....</li>
      <li>When sprayed multiple times, it&#x27;s good enough for a 9-5 workday, but as it is a Toilette and not Parfum, the fragrance concentration is lower.</li>
      <li>I am a big strong man though</li>
      <li>Large bottle for the money also</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>within 2-3 hours you can&#x27;t really smell it anymore.</li>
      <li>The ladies absolutely LOVVVE the cologne on me.  </li>
      <li>He absolutely loves this cologne and the price.</li>
      <li>If your significant other appreciates a sweet powdery smell, they&#x27;ll like this.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a bit on the subtle side (which he prefers), but very sexy smelling.</li>
      <li>was navigating investigating all of the new fragrances by givenchy</li>
      <li>i effing love this scent as do my lady friends;) the only reason i wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone is because none of my friends know about it and its original.</li>
      <li>I did originally comment saying that this wasn&#x27;t worth the buy, but after using it again a few weeks later i have changed my mind..  </li>
      <li>She said it was quite masculine and would not work for her.</li>
      <li>yet, i tdoes smell somewhat masculine.</li>
      <li>This has a distinctive smell that cannot be confused wit the trendy perfumes or aftershaves of the day and does not announce your presence from across the room.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
      <li>counterpart)...aftershave still half full...</li>
      <li>As a result, I gave it to another dude at work and he apparently loves it.</li>
      <li>I thought the price was not bad since I am the one who usually buys cologne for him.</li>
      <li>I normally wear colognes seasonally, but I like this one so much that I am considering wearing it year round!  </li>

<li> I consider a man should smell very different than a woman and much less.</li>
<li> 20- 25 ml of the perfume due to that reason.  </li>

<li> There&#x27;s gotta be quite a few females out there who will like it, yet I have yet to receive any signs that girls like the smell of it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Simply put, It just smells horrible ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nowhere near other high quality perfume, the smell change over time and turns out disgusting</li>
    <li> The ladies absolutely LOVVVE the cologne on me.  I get compliments all day long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is soft, but very strong in attracting women.</li>
    <li> I will never buy cologne online....&lt;br /&gt;The bottle was broken when I opened the box</li>
    <li> I brought as a gift and the person, loved it!!!!  Great Price.  Thanks</li>
    <li> I like it.  But everyone has different body chemistry, so I don&#x27;t know how it will smell on anyone else.</li>
    <li> I wear Givenchy pi religiously and love it, so I thought that neo will be awesome, too. Well, I thought it smelled to flowery and feminine so I tried to give it away to a lady at work. She said it was quite masculine and would not work for her. As a result, I gave it to another dude at work and he apparently loves it. If he did not like it I was going to give it to this gay guy I met at a bar because I thought it would be perfect for him. He never called me back.</li>
    <li> got the set as a gift a couple years ago (with it&#x27;s aftershave counterpart)...aftershave still half full...so i ordered the bottle again to restore the set...good enough for me ;)</li>
    <li> This perfume smells amazing, and i even get asked a lot form women what kind of perfume are you wearing? is great to have women come up to me because they love the way i smell, so guys you should def buy this..</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband and it&#x27;s amazing. It&#x27;s a bit on the subtle side (which he prefers), but very sexy smelling. I love it.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product highly as PI Neo has a fabulous smell.  Bought this as a gift for my husband and he loves it.  However, I would hesitate using the supplier as the packaging was very poor and we lost 20- 25 ml of the perfume due to that reason.  I wished to return it but my husband wanted to start using it right away and so we kept the item. Therefore the 3 stars, else would have given it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> This was a fantastic deal!  I saved over $20.00 over purchasing it from Macy&#x27;s!  How can you go wrong there!  Will definitely get more!</li>
    <li> Nice aroma, too bad it doesn&#x27;t last long. You are tempted to use a lot at the beginning, the smell is really nice but within 2-3 hours you can&#x27;t really smell it anymore.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite scents. If your significant other appreciates a sweet powdery smell, they&#x27;ll like this.</li>
    <li> This product comes skillfully packaged and obviously is authentic Givenchy. Scent is wonderful and unlike other reviews I have read regarding problems with the bottle or spray dispenser, mine was perfect. Shipping was quick and price was significantly below what I have seen in retail stores. Very pleased and highly recommend.  Don&#x27;t be influenced or led astray by negative reviews of this product. The problem is with clueless reviewers, not the product.</li>
    <li> I saw this in Macys months ago, loved the scent but didn&#x27;t want to shell out $85 for a Cologne. Saw it at basically half price on amazon so i could not resist. It has an awesome awesome light sweet scent, somewhat hard to describe, but the ladies seem to love it, as i get grabbed and sniffed a bunch when i put it on, lol. One girl said it reminded her of drinking moscato...???...yeaahh lol. One true thing is that it is not an all day scent. When sprayed multiple times, it&#x27;s good enough for a 9-5 workday, but as it is a Toilette and not Parfum, the fragrance concentration is lower. Nonetheless It has become my fav fragrance to wear, and I will purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Great but, my husband loves it😊</li>
    <li> I normally wear colognes seasonally, but I like this one so much that I am considering wearing it year round!  Plus I love the fact that it was inspired by The Matrix, which is one of the best films of all time.</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this on my husband, have been buying for several years. He has others as well, but always love it when he has this one on, and the smell is very lasting.</li>
    <li> Love this.Smells great .</li>
    <li> this will replace the Higher dior that I have, good price and lasts longer, and smells great</li>
    <li> Women love this stuff. I get a lot of compliments when ever I wear it. I will be getting more</li>
    <li> Love this cologne and great price.</li>
    <li> and I actually like it as well.  the tester does nothing to the scent when he puts it on.  several of his male friends have asked what he was wearing then asked me where I purchesed it from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;look out amazon, you may be getting more orders.</li>
    <li> Received many compliments about this fragrance.  I&#x27;ll soon be reordering.</li>
    <li> Great value - prompt delivery</li>
    <li> i effing love this scent as do my lady friends;) the only reason i wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone is because none of my friends know about it and its original. def best kept secret ;)</li>
    <li> Not as aromatic as I&#x27;d like, much too subtle.</li>
    <li> You got to the right place to buy this perfume.  A very famous national store is even advertising this product for $ 75</li>
    <li> What a great deal for a good product. I plan to purchase more cologne from your company for the holidays. Thank you very much.</li>
    <li> What can I say? I love the smell and so does everyone else. One thing though, I saved $20 ordering here as opposed to buying it at the mall. lol</li>
    <li> My husband loved this scent when the salesperson at Macy&#x27;s presented it to him. The only drawback was its $75 price tag, he stated if it was $50 he would buy it. I thought the price was not bad since I am the one who usually buys cologne for him. When I saw the price on Amazon, I ordered it right away hoping it was legitimate, and it was. He absolutely loves this cologne and the price.</li>
    <li> I did originally comment saying that this wasn&#x27;t worth the buy, but after using it again a few weeks later i have changed my mind..  If you are looking for a scent that makes you feel good, feel happy, this is one you should defiantly buy. It defiantly is uplifting, its quite citrusy but also a bit woody too.  I was going to sell my bottle, but I&#x27;m not going to now, as my opinion has changed. This one is staying in my collection.  It also has good longevity.  Buy it, you wont be disappointed.</li>
    <li> was navigating investigating all of the new fragrances by givenchy and I came across this particular one , I ordered it as a gift to a friend and the feedback i got for it was an excellent one ! Givenchy makes excellent Fragrances !!</li>
    <li> Got this as a Christmas gift for my brother! This is an amazing scent. It was promptly shipped with no problems. Nuff said.</li>
    <li> Parfume would be a better choice than toilet.... It seems to work better for me. This is a nice crisp scent that lasts quite a while. I am a big strong man though, I need something more musky with some nice woody undertones. This is for that pretty frat kid. The one who gets a manicure once a week. I wear it for job interviews but never to the strip club boys.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a guy that uses much of this kind of stuff. I consider a man should smell very different than a woman and much less. This has a distinctive smell that cannot be confused wit the trendy perfumes or aftershaves of the day and does not announce your presence from across the room.&lt;br /&gt;If you are one of those man that think the stronger the perfume you are wearing the larger you are look elsewhere!</li>
    <li> Really good &amp;#34;whiff of this fragrance from you brings attention on you&amp;#34; . Try it for yourself. This is my first one from givenchy</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my husband. We saw this cologne in a store and we both really liked it so I ordered it. Great scent!</li>
    <li> Great cologne that I received quickly once I ordered it.  Large bottle for the money also</li>
    <li> Shipping was on time and product arrived in excellent condition. cologne smells pretty good not something I would use for very special occasions but is good for every day use.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a pretty pleasant scent- I feel like it doesn&#x27;t smell like the most masculine scent, yet, i tdoes smell somewhat masculine. It is also a &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; smell, as well. I do like the smell of this Cologne, however, I do not know if girls feel attracted to this scent. Nonetheless, it is worth buying, and it does smell a bit like you just got out of the shower, but it isn&#x27;t an overbearing scent, either. So, if you&#x27;re considering buying this cologne, DEFINITELY buy it. There&#x27;s gotta be quite a few females out there who will like it, yet I have yet to receive any signs that girls like the smell of it. I would also recommend NOIR by Tom Ford.</li>
    <li> This cologne is very fantastic and is very great at a helpful and great price. I would also reccomend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> excellent cologne i think i made a right choice. i will buy another Givenchy products for my use and gift</li>
    <li> Great price..nice scent...lots of compliments</li>
</ol>
