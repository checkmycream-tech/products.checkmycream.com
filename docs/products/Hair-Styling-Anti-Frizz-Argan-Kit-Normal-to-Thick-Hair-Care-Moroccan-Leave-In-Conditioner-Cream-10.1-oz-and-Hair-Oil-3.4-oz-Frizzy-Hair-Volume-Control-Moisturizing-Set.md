    <li> I bought this for my teenage daughter, who has extremely curly hair. She has a hard time finding hair products that work and that she likes. Some common problems thats she runs into are: anti-frizz products leave her hair oily and sprunch sprays/mouse leave her hair stiff. These products did neither!! She absolutely loves them!! They controlled her frizz in both humidity and dry air, we were traveling so she was in several weather conditions. And her hair held its natural curl all day without her hair being stiff. I am so happy to finally find products for my daughters hair that work the way they are supposed to.</li>
    <li> would buy again left my hair so soft and shiny</li>
    <li> Upon opening this product, I got a great first impression. The packaging was nice and looked really high quality. The bottles are amber glass which will help keep the product better over time because it helps filter out UV light. The smell was pleasant. A little musky, and herby but not overwhelming. I have really thick, really curly hair and it did a great job moisturizing and defining my curls. They looked shiny and well held together and didn&#x27;t feel stiff, crunchy, or oily. I would absolutely get these again.</li>
    <li> I have very frizzy curly hair and nothing seems to work as good as this does. I put just a little of the Hair relaxer in and it instantly made my hair shiny and frizz free and it lasted all day. I didn&#x27;t have to keep reapplying it. Just once and it worked. I will however keep treating my hair daily with this. I love it so much my hair is soft now. It&#x27;s almost hard to believe myself. Thank you for creating such a great product. I definitely recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Item worked nicely on my hair doesn&#x27;t leave hair too greasy like other products i recommend using a small dime dose as a bit goes a long way :) the only thing i would recommend to have is a dropper for the oil as you can have better control of the product</li>
    <li> I have very fine naturally curly hair that frizzes horribly in humid conditions. I purchased this based upon other reviews prior to a trip to Savannah, GA. It was a mega fail. I followed the instructions exactly as recommended. The oil made my hair look dirty and greasy. The lotion was fine as long as I stayed indoors, but the moment I went outside I was right back to my previous frizzy look. I feel I wasted $30 on this product. I have always had the frizzy issue and it looks like my only option will be to wear a hat.</li>
    <li> I have extremely frizzy hair and dry scalp, and I have tried so many different products to try and help, and nothing seems to work. When I was offered the Argan Hair kit at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest and unbiased review, I couldn&#x27;t pass it up. This has worked wonders on my hair!!!! My hair is not frizzy anymore, and I can actually control it, instead of it always looking like I have been playing with the light sockets lol. One more benefit of this kit is it has really helped improve my dry, itchy scalp. I will be making sure that I keep Argan hair products on hand at all times.</li>
    <li> Love it! I live in Miami where there is lots of humidity year round, making frizz management a daily necessity. This product works great on my curly hair helping it shine, feel soft and no frizz!</li>
    <li> This thing really works! my hair feels so amazing and it smells awesome...I just thought the packaging was a little small</li>
    <li> Wow - this stuff has exceeded my expectations.  My hair looks AMAZING with these products!  You don&#x27;t have to use very much.  I have long hair and the ends can sometimes look frizzy - especially in the humidity, since I have naturally curly hair.  This stuff makes my hair look like spun silk.  Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I have fine frizzy hair and was looking forward to trying this Hair Styling Anti-Frizz Kit.  This lotion is great product.  I used even less than you were supposed too.  I noticed after using my hair was really shiny and extremely soft and no frizz. It also was great for tangles in your hair.  It&#x27;s a great product give it a try.</li>
    <li> Smells AMAZING! Such a quality product! Left my hair feeling and smelling soft and smooth. HIGHLY recommend!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure impressed with this I think you have to go with the hundred percent Moroccan oil and this is definitely not a little misleading with the label.  It&#x27;s not as hydrating and a little greasy I actually like the stuff on QVC.  Just try to make sure you get a brand that says 100 hundred percent Moroccan oil.  I Have very thick hair and the actual hair it&#x27;s self is thick and hundred percent Moroccan oil works like a miracle on it no tangles and it absorbency is awesome.  Hundred percent Moroccan oil is a little more expensive but you pay for what you get.</li>
    <li> i love this product!! its truly amazing! my hair is very frizzy, dry, and curly and this product helps with frizziness and the texture of my hair is so soft!! would deff recommend this to my friends!</li>
    <li> What a great line of products. I have only one set. Can&#x27;t wait to purchase the rest. My hair is dry and Curley and I use a flat iron in it often. This product made it shiny and soft. Plus the frizzies calmed down. Excellent hold too.</li>
    <li> Oh my.. my frizz is GONE. This stuff REALLY really works great! I have used this for two days and oh my I just love the feeling. It does not weigh my hair down either. If you have Frizz you need this!&lt;br /&gt;* I received this item in exchange for my honest and unbiased review*</li>
    <li> This stuff is absolute garbage.  It didn&#x27;t straighten  my hair just made it greasy</li>
    <li> fantastic stuff. Works great on my corkscrew curls. Love it!</li>
    <li> I am seriously happy with this!!  I got this with my grand daughter in mind, who has hair that is wild, crazy, and always has frizzy problem.  I was so excited when I was given the opportunity to get this for free for my honest and unbiased opionion.&lt;br /&gt;We washed her hair as we would normally, then put this on her hair, brushed it out.  She went to bed...now normally this is when things go bad.  She usually wakes up with &amp;#34;crazy&amp;#34; hair.  But not since we started using this Hair Relaxer on it!!  It is smooth, and doesn&#x27;t tangle up like it was.  Great product!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend to anybody with curly or Frizzy hair!!</li>
    <li> I finally found what I needed for my hair. I no longer have frizzy hair. this doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down. Wish I had it years ago. NO MORE FRIZZ! *This item was received free for the purpose of testing for honest and unbiased review.*</li>
    <li> Make my hair more healthy</li>
    <li> This came at the perfect time, I had just gotten out of the shower. My hair was damp and well the instructions said use the argon oil when hair is damp. I put the oil in my hair and let me tell you it feels so good and shines. There is a pleasant scent to this oil as well, I will continue to use this as I love the way it makes my hair shine!</li>
    <li> Greatest product I have ever used for my fuzzed hair!!! I am so satisfied with this purchase!</li>
