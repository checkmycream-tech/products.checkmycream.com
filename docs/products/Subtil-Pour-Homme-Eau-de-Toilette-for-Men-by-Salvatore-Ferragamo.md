      <li>Subtil Pour Homme has been, and will remain, in my Top 10.  </li>
      <li>and I slept with it near by because it smelled so good!</li>
      <li>I detect fresh citrus fruity notes almost lemon/lime out of the gates and then it settles into a clean aquatic fragrance that is pleasant to the nose.  </li>
      <li>It smells great on him, but it&#x27;s such a nice smell</li>
      <li>I just don&#x27;t have a good feeling that the cologne I purchased is the REAL DEAL.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Try not to confuse it with other Salvatore Ferragamo fragrances, this is in my opinion the best.</li>
      <li>Hello   Exelente, received very timely, I am very satisfied with my purchase.     </li>
      <li>Even her Nana told her I smelled nice when I met her (Nana) for the first time.</li>
      <li>Everything about this purchase was just fine.</li>
      <li>so far it&#x27;s a very good cologne for it&#x27;s price,make u feel like a gentleman ,smells good and stay for a long time</li>
      <li>I am comfortable wearing this scent any time of year and for any occasion - for those who get into that sort of thing - stick to Spring/Summer and evening</li>
      <li>I thought it smelt cheap.</li>
      <li>love this smell, fresh smell with hint of power, stays on my skin forever.</li>
      <li>I love the fresh fruityness it has.</li>
      <li>This is one of the better colognes out there in my opinion if sprayed on the right guy.</li>
      <li>While the fragrance still smells the same, it seems there is a remarkable difference in the longevity to the bottle I just purchased.  </li>
      <li>This is not an original item.</li>
      <li>I tried the Original Subtil and now the pour homme version</li>
      <li>Something about those clean citrus fragrances that work for me...</li>
      <li>bottle is an extremely cool design and is well packaged.  </li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t think there is a better smell out there for me.</li>
      <li>:) I would highly recommend!</li>
      <li>I love this scent, and it is very affordable on Amazon.</li>
      <li>(I know they have multiple scents), but it didn&#x27;t smell good by any standards.</li>
      <li>This is one of the best subtle colognes for men.</li>
      <li>I could not believe I got this so fast and at such a great price.  </li>
      <li>Recently I got lucky and found the 3.4 at a discounter for $25, so I picked it up and have been very pleased.  </li>
      <li>it smells good and lasts long</li>
      <li>The value on Amazon is just $25.00 for a large bottle with Free Shipping - for the price, are you kidding me?</li>
      <li>I had sampled Subtil in a mall perfume shop and liked it, but they only had the 3.4 oz for about 50 bucks, so I passed.  </li>
      <li>cologne collection has now surpassed 300 bottles and growing - you have to spend your money on something, right?  </li>
      <li>As usual, great quality product.</li>
      <li>first off it does not smell right...</li>
      <li>Salvatore Ferragamo Subtil is my favorite cologne right next to Montblanc Starwalker.</li>
      <li>This is one of my three favorites and it came 100% brand new, in the original sealed packaging.</li>
      <li>This was my sons present it is his favorite.</li>
      <li>The first time I bought this from Nordstrom I paid well over $70, and it got stolen when I took the car for an oil change.</li>
      <li>I was first shock by the price, and then I put it on, first-of</li>
      <li>Of noteworthy interest, I did buy my first bottle from a department store in the mall.  </li>
      <li>This scent runs along the same lines as the Herrera Aqua and the ladies love it.  </li>
      <li>I received as described fast, excellent service, the Packge had enough quantity of protection, not too much not too little,</li>
      <li>This perfume is I like taste, everyone loved brand and flavor is not the same, but this is the least I love, is worth buying</li>
      <li>Regardless, the scent is very pleasant and you will get compliments - the Wow Factor is above average.  </li>
      <li>Amazon was great with shipping, My order came two days earlier than expected!</li>
      <li>but the item did come &amp;#34;damaged.&amp;#34; The box arrived soggy and the top of the bottle was loose.</li>
      <li>&quot; Its a very fruity scent with a spicy kick to it</li>
      <li>The fragrance is really that good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>(haha)</li>
      <li>it has to much alcohol and the scent</li>
      <li>He is very perticular about his colgones since he is in Retail</li>
      <li>Fast shipping, priced well, and</li>
      <li>I bought this as a gift, and it went over very well.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This cologne was worth the few dollars I paid for it. The scent doesn&#x27;t last very long. Nor do I believe it will attract a female&#x27;s attention.</li>
    <li> this cologne smells so good! Very clean smell that everyone has notice and love the way it smells on me too!</li>
    <li> It takes me back to when my husband and I had first started several years ago. He left a shirt at my apartment and I slept with it near by because it smelled so good! (haha) After the bottle ran out, he took a break and started wearing Black by Kenneth Cole. While that is a very lovely scent as well, I prefer this Ferragamo MUCH better. I recently purchased this cologne again for him and I&#x27;m so glad I did! When he wears it, it takes me back to when our relationship was new, fresh and exciting. Even after all these years later, it still \\&quot;does it\\&quot; for me :) I would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I only had this item for about two weeks and it&#x27;s already gone! Every night when I would wear it, I would get compliments from girls saying \\&quot;you smell good\\&quot; with a little bit of ummmm after. I really don&#x27;t think there is a better smell out there for me. I even caught my brother spraying, three times. There is nothing to think about while looking at this product, just buy it and you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> It;s a good fragance, smells very good</li>
    <li> Hello   Exelente, received very timely, I am very satisfied with my purchase.     Thank you ...    km</li>
    <li> love this smell, fresh smell with hint of power, stays on my skin forever.</li>
    <li> As usual, great quality product. I always love the fragrances from Salvatore and this one is no exception! bought it as a gift. Great price at amazon!</li>
    <li> This perfume is I like taste, everyone loved brand and flavor is not the same, but this is the least I love, is worth buying</li>
    <li> I used this perfume earlier where I brought from perfumania and it was awsome. But the one frm amazon is not worthy enough and it&#x27;s not looks original</li>
    <li> I really like these perfumes, just what I expected, thanks.&lt;br /&gt;Me gustan mucho estos perfumes, justo lo que esperaba, gracias</li>
    <li> so far it&#x27;s a very good cologne for it&#x27;s price,make u feel like a gentleman ,smells good and stay for a long time</li>
    <li> Loved how it arrived on time. This is one of the better colognes out there in my opinion if sprayed on the right guy.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift, and it went over very well. Fast shipping, priced well, and It smells AMAZING. Not too harsh, and defiantly a scent you&#x27;ll remember. If you&#x27;re thinking about buying this. Do it, you won&#x27;t regret it. (:</li>
    <li> I received as described fast, excellent service, the Packge had enough quantity of protection, not too much not too little,</li>
    <li> This is an authentic cologne from Salvatore Ferragamo.  Please make sure you are buying the item from amazon.  There are many sellers out there that are selling fake colognes.  Make sure it states \\&quot;Ships from and sold by Amazon.com.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been Subtil user since it came out in 2002. Back than I purchased it at Saks. When I purchased this version from Amazon I was first shock by the price, and then I put it on, first-of it has to much alcohol and the scent don&#x27;t last long. I know this is not the $75 Subtil they sell at Ferragamo website.</li>
    <li> I HAVE TO SAY I CANT DECIDE WITCH ONE I LIKE MORE.THE BLUE F.OR THIS ONE HERE.I JUST CANT WAIT TO TRY THE REST.</li>
    <li> An old girlfriend of mine bought me the 3.4 oz as a gift.  I wore it twice and she told me never to wear it again.  I started wearing it again after we broke up, and NEVER received any compliments on it from women.  You know this is a telltale sign of a mediocre cologne.  Also look at how cheap it is now, and you can tell it&#x27;s not very popular.</li>
    <li> I would just like to say I personally love the smell and so does the hubby. He is very perticular about his colgones since he is in Retail but he love it..</li>
    <li> This is one of the best subtle colognes for men. It is not overpowering yet has a very sophisticated aroma. Try not to confuse it with other Salvatore Ferragamo fragrances, this is in my opinion the best.</li>
    <li> Smell like a man, but not a &amp;#34;brut&amp;#34; or a flower. I get compliments all the time. I highly recommend it</li>
    <li> very good product. excellent quality</li>
    <li> excellent product and buy</li>
    <li> This stuff smells great... but the item did come &amp;#34;damaged.&amp;#34; The box arrived soggy and the top of the bottle was loose. About half an inch of cologne had leaked out of the bottle. Not sure how that happens? Anyway, Amazon did refund me, but just wanted to share my experience!</li>
    <li> Very smooth smell. Nice gift idea</li>
    <li> Espectacular olor cinco estrellas, buena duración</li>
    <li> This was a great purchase!!!! It was a Christmas present. It arrived on time, the packing was excellent. Everything about this purchase was just fine. I bought several fragances for my family they were all very happy!!!! This was my sons present it is his favorite.</li>
    <li> Salvatore Ferragamo Subtil is my favorite cologne right next to Montblanc Starwalker. I tried the Original Subtil and now the pour homme version and i gotta say.. I can Barely smell the Difference. The only thing that&#x27;s different between the two is that pour homme smells a bit heavier if that makes sense, like slightly darker if you will. I like them both but which ever one is cheaper then I&#x27;ll just buy that one</li>
    <li> first off it does not smell right... but secondly the reason why i know its fake is that it has all these brown things floating around in it!!! NASTY... Sending it back ASAP...</li>
    <li> Bought it for my boyfriend. Smells subtle and clean. Not overwhelming or offensive even with a few sprays. Unbelievable deal since this used to be approx. $90 at high-end stores.</li>
    <li> 3rd Bottle, smells great and not many people have it.</li>
    <li> Amazon was great with shipping, My order came two days earlier than expected! It was actually the real deal and not a fake like I had feared. Make Sure the item says \\&quot;sold and shipped Amazon.com.\\&quot; Its a very fruity scent with a spicy kick to it I love the fresh fruityness it has. perfect Work/School fragrance! Salvatore Ferragamo.. simply amazing..</li>
    <li> Everything is fine but looks quite old&lt;br /&gt;Out wrapping is dirty with dust.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not for gift though I feel not good.</li>
    <li> this cologne was so fake</li>
    <li> I just don&#x27;t have a good feeling that the cologne I purchased is the REAL DEAL.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is very faint and it doesn&#x27;t stay on me like before.</li>
    <li> Delicious smell, my girlfriend loves the smell. Even her Nana told her I smelled nice when I met her (Nana) for the first time. I recommend it for  anyone that has a sensitive nose and prefers soft citrus scents over the overpowering scents.</li>
    <li> design of the bottle looks  amazing.it has a similar scent like Bvlgari Aqva Pour homme.however i it smells good and lasts long</li>
    <li> Great scent and price. Women ask me what cologne I&#x27;m using all the time. I&#x27;m very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I have never written a review for a product, but this cologne was so fake, I felt a moral obligation to do so.  Do not buy this product. I should have abided by the old adage, &amp;#34;if it looks too good to be true, it probably is.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> to use in formal or casual ocations, everybody ask about this, it´s diferent to thne others lotions, i like it</li>
    <li> This is not correct.  Scent doesn&#x27;t last, smells off, and is really not the same as the one I have been wearing for over 10 years now.</li>
    <li> The cologne is perfect because it is not too strong at all...and the price it was offered at was a great deal.</li>
    <li> The aroma is very subtle. Not to outrageous and not to insipid to pass by.</li>
    <li> i purchased the Salvatore Ferragamo 3.3oz spray for Men....and it smells GREAT!!....&lt;br /&gt;and iam getting a LOT OF COMPLIMENTS..thank you</li>
    <li> This is definitely a great smelling cologne. I am always complimented by the women.</li>
    <li> This is not an original item. This cologne is as fake as fake can be. This smells awful!!  This is a total rip off!&amp;#34;  Please refund my credit card.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my bf to replenish his depleting one. It smells great on him, but it&#x27;s such a nice smell I spray it when he&#x27;s not there. It&#x27;s not over powering or musky.. just fresh and attractive. The bottle is neat too.</li>
    <li> You buy what you get for the prize</li>
    <li> I had originally purchased Ferragamo Subtil Pour Homme a number of years ago and have been big fan of the scent since.. While the fragrance still smells the same, it seems there is a remarkable difference in the longevity to the bottle I just purchased.  Of noteworthy interest, I did buy my first bottle from a department store in the mall.  The fragrance rocks..!!  Each of our noses are different - I detect fresh citrus fruity notes almost lemon/lime out of the gates and then it settles into a clean aquatic fragrance that is pleasant to the nose.  The fragrance is really that good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today for example - I applied a heavy dosage prior to leaving for work (around 7:30 AM) - the fragrance died out a little after 1:00 PM (even on my shirtsleeve).  What is up with the colognes of today - they just don&#x27;t last..?!?!  It seems the cologne we purchased 5 years ago would last the whole day.  Regardless, the scent is very pleasant and you will get compliments - the Wow Factor is above average.  I am comfortable wearing this scent any time of year and for any occasion - for those who get into that sort of thing - stick to Spring/Summer and evening wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is an extremely cool design and is well packaged.  Ferragamo, nice job..!!  The value on Amazon is just $25.00 for a large bottle with Free Shipping - for the price, are you kidding me? - even with below average longevity, it is a steal.  Add it to your collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My cologne collection has now surpassed 300 bottles and growing - you have to spend your money on something, right?  Subtil Pour Homme has been, and will remain, in my Top 10.  Something about those clean citrus fragrances that work for me...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All things considered, I give Subtil 4.4 stars out of 5.  While the longevity is below average, it is a deal and should be added to your collection.  Life is full of twists and turns - drive with caution.. !!</li>
    <li> I could not believe I got this so fast and at such a great price.  This is one of my three favorites and it came 100% brand new, in the original sealed packaging.</li>
    <li> Great fragrance, the packaging was very addecuate and delivery on time. Very good seller, I definetly recommend it, also, great price !</li>
    <li> I was trying to buy a cologne that my friend was wearing who said it was Salvadore Ferragamo. Not only was this not it (I know they have multiple scents), but it didn&#x27;t smell good by any standards. I thought it smelt cheap.</li>
    <li> Ladies love when I wear this...Mix it with my unscented lotion and it lasts almost eight hours. Can&#x27;t go wrong with this scent!</li>
    <li> The first time I bought this from Nordstrom I paid well over $70, and it got stolen when I took the car for an oil change. I love this scent, and it is very affordable on Amazon. Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> This is a panty dropper</li>
    <li> Love this. Get A LOT of compliments.</li>
    <li> Surprisingly great scent. I bought this for my husband, we both like how it smells on him. It stays longs too. Great deal!</li>
    <li> best colonge on the market, smells good, smoth sweet masclunie scent the ladies will love the aroma that comes off your body</li>
    <li> amazing smell and lasts forever</li>
    <li> I &amp;#34;THINK&amp;#34; this is a knock off, the scent doesn&#x27;t last long which leads me to believe it&#x27;s not the real deal.</li>
    <li> I have an extensive collection of fragrances totalling almost 40, and recently I ran out of Carolina Herrera Aqua (which is really a masculine floral scent, not an aquatic).  Not wanting to pay 40-50 bucks for a 1.7oz. replacement bottle domestically, I began looking in stores for a similar item to add to my collection.  I had sampled Subtil in a mall perfume shop and liked it, but they only had the 3.4 oz for about 50 bucks, so I passed.  Recently I got lucky and found the 3.4 at a discounter for $25, so I picked it up and have been very pleased.  This scent runs along the same lines as the Herrera Aqua and the ladies love it.  Not sure why it gets blasted in reviews for poor lasting power, because I have found the scent to last at least 6 hours, although like most others it becomes more of a skin scent after a few hours.  I find the drydown to be the best part... it has a floral/light musk/light patchouli/very sophisticated tone, and I think its great!</li>
    <li> My nephew always comments when he smells this on his uncle!  He&#x27;s gonna be so surprised that I got it for him for Christmas!</li>
