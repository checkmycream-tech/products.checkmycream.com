<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I was told two month ago to use this by my dermatologist along with a different medication for my psoriasis. I don&#x27;t really know how well it works on it&#x27;s own that is one of the reasons I took a star off the ratings, that and the smell. I can never quite get over the smell of tar shampoos, YUK!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real reason I am righting this is because a number of reviews here say they can&#x27;t find this in stores. Walmart caries this as a special order through the pharmacy. Other stores might too, it&#x27;s on my list to check but I haven&#x27;t gotten that far yet. You just go to the pharmacy and order how many you want and they call you when it is in. I have gotten mine there so far for $12.09 for each 8oz bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am here because I wanted to see if I can find it cheaper online. At $33.23 for 3 bottles ($11.07 per) so far this is the cheapest listing I have currently found beating Walmart&#x27;s price if you buy enough for the free shipping.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for three months now and i love it. My scalp has been clear ever since.</li>
    <li> This item is great for individuals who have scalp psoriasis.  Although the smell is a bit strong, it controls your psoriasis.  It does not necessarily help it too much, but it does stop the psoriasis from expanding and scaling too much.  I have tried several tar shampoos and this remains the best one so far.</li>
    <li> Was recommended to me by a dermatologist.  It really works on itchy scalp and dandruff. Love it.</li>
    <li> Good value!  Came in only a few days.</li>
    <li> I still haven&#x27;t found a shampoo that works better for me than dhs. Not the cheapest, or most feminine of products, but it is really effective.</li>
    <li> I love it.  Many thanks for supplying it.</li>
    <li> it was exactly what I wanted and needed. I expect to order again. What more can I say? Thank you</li>
    <li> Good product, price and fast shipping. Thanks</li>
    <li> This stuff works when nothing else did.</li>
    <li> This shampoo made my hair and scalp feel clean.</li>
    <li> Thank you for the wonderful service.  Pleased with the product.  John</li>
    <li> After Neutrogena changed the formula on their extra strength T-Gel I had to find another solution for my ongoing psoriasis. This product really helps! Bartell Drugs used to carry it, but discontinued it a few months ago. I was thrilled to find it here!</li>
    <li> This is the only product that actually took care of the psoriasis on my mom&#x27;s scalp. We were never happier. Only wish it was available in stores, but will gladly get it online to keep it away- NO itching or flaky/dry scalp. One HAPPY customer!!!!</li>
    <li> This product works better that all others that I have tried to rid my scalp psoriasis but it still has not solved my problem.&lt;br /&gt;It works fro about 12-15 hours and the itching returns and small scabs return as well.</li>
    <li> I was pleased with the price, quality &amp; quick delivery service. i will continue to reorder in the future</li>
    <li> everything on time and as expected</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo for cleaning up dermatitis it is recommended for anyone have itchy scalp, etc, also a good buy</li>

    <li> Great price. I tried this shampoo as a last effort before spending hundreds on prescription meds for my scalp psoriasis. It worked like a charm. Within three months my scalp was healed and now I just use it once a week for maintenance.</li>
    <li> I tried to get this shampoo from my local COSTCO but it was not available. I checked around town and stores were out.  So, I checked with the manufacturer why the product was not available.  The manufacturer said that they were changing the sudsing agent and recommended that I obtain the product on the web in the interim.  I got the old formula I wanted, at a good price and it arrived quickly. I did try another Tar Shampoo from a local store, but I had a reaction to it and was very happy to find my old shampoo</li>
    <li> recommended by my Dr.&lt;br /&gt;it is very helpful</li>
    <li> Best shampoo out there for scalp problems</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo to use for scalp conditions that create flakey skin.  I have been using it for 33 years without a problem.</li>
