      <li>I love this perfume.</li>
      <li>Most of the vanilla has been removed, the smokiness, and it&#x27;s now a musky sort of jasmine scent.  </li>

      <li>This is one of the most unique fragrances I have ever purchased &amp; I just love it!  </li>
      <li>love it</li>
      <li>Love this.  </li>
      <li>Just love it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I was extremely surprised that so many liked it, but to each his own, as they say.  </li>
      <li>I tend to go for the more woodsy fragrances as I am not at all attracted to the sweet, floral type of perfumes &amp; the notes in Addict, i.e. mandarin &amp; others.  </li>
      <li>I worked for Dior at one time, and this fragrance was launched with a huge hoopla.  </li>
      <li>My wife loved it and I loved the less than retail price!</li>
      <li>Dior has several nice fragrances, but this one - NOT!</li>
      <li>Shipped quickly</li>
      <li>Men will stop me in the street, to ask what I am wearing, pretty cool when you are my age.  </li>
      <li>different.&lt;br /&gt;-The box that the perfume came in was an authentic box, BUT it was missing the cellophane wrapping as well as the sticker on the top.  </li>
      <li>I first got a sample from Surrender to Chance, which sells perfume samples, to see if I would like it.  </li>
      <li>And boy did it have an effect when I first whiffed it.  </li>
      <li>It is very easy to tell that this is not authentic, especially since I had an authentic bottle purchased from a department store to compare it to.  </li>
      <li>It is a very heady overpowering smell.</li>
      <li>I would&#x27;ve just gone to the mall and got the REAL stuff.</li>
      <li>Thanks, Carol</li>
      <li>I have been wearing this perfume for 10 straight years</li>
      <li>The real thing is clear.&lt;br /&gt;-The</li>
      <li>Very please with this product.</li>
      <li>I get more compliments on this than any other.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s so lovely and long lasting!</li>
      <li>I have been using Addict parfum for years &amp; for some reason this time around the scent does not smell as lovely as usual.</li>
      <li>They are obviously just reusing real boxes.</li>
      <li>The perfume I got smells really similar to the real Dior addict</li>
      <li>and he said did i do that out loud</li>
      <li>The warmth and woodsy tones of the middle that give way to the fruity, yet powdery vanilla and amber base notes perfectly suit me.</li>
      <li>i work the guy came to me to sign the paper he stood next to me and started sniffing out loud</li>
      <li>I have read other reviews for the new formula, in the white box, and was concerned that I would get that item.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> The perfume I got smells really similar to the real Dior addict but I think it is imitation perfume. It&#x27;s a different color and smells slightly different. If I wouldve known I would get this I would&#x27;ve just gone to the mall and got the REAL stuff.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, this is the 2014 reformulated version.  Most of the vanilla has been removed, the smokiness, and it&#x27;s now a musky sort of jasmine scent.  I first got a sample from Surrender to Chance, which sells perfume samples, to see if I would like it.  But Dior in the meantime has changed the formula!  Very disappointing.  It&#x27;s just a very generic floral now.  Dior has the worst business practice of reformulating their perfumes.</li>
    <li> A lot of perfumes have come and gone for me:    Opium  Miss Dior Cherie  Dolce &amp; Gabbana&#x27;s \\&quot;The One\\&quot;  Chloe  Flowerbomb    None of them can ever take the place of Dior&#x27;s Addict for me. I have been wearing this perfume for 10 straight years and I always get compliments on it. The warmth and woodsy tones of the middle that give way to the fruity, yet powdery vanilla and amber base notes perfectly suit me. Every man I have ever worn this around loves it too!</li>
    <li> MADE HER HAPPY THATS ALL THAT MATTERS</li>
    <li> I love this perfume. It&#x27;s great for people who enjoy perfumes with a hint of rose/vanilla/musk...but it&#x27;s very feminine and subtle. I get compliments from both men and women whenever I wear this! If you want to exude sensuality without smelling like a fruit or baked goods then GET THIS!  Oh and the service and delivery was great!!!</li>
    <li> Love this parfum.  Scent stays on all day.  I still like Hypnotic Poison  better, but if you are looking for another good parfume from Dior this is a good choice.  Has very good staying power.</li>
    <li> I worked for Dior at one time, and this fragrance was launched with a huge hoopla.  And boy did it have an effect when I first whiffed it.  It is a very heady overpowering smell. All I could think was, \\&quot;French whore.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was extremely surprised that so many liked it, but to each his own, as they say.  I do have a girlfriend whose guy asked her to stop wearing it.  Dior has several nice fragrances, but this one - NOT!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom on here since it was cheaper than department stores.  It is very easy to tell that this is not authentic, especially since I had an authentic bottle purchased from a department store to compare it to.  This one was from &amp;#34;direct street&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The bottle dimensions are different, this one is wider and shorter.&lt;br /&gt;-It is missing some of the finer details on the bottle like the CD stamp on the sprayer.&lt;br /&gt;-I sprayed both on a napkin and this fake one sprays a prink-red color that would stain your clothes.  The real thing is clear.&lt;br /&gt;-The scent is a lot different.&lt;br /&gt;-The box that the perfume came in was an authentic box, BUT it was missing the cellophane wrapping as well as the sticker on the top.  You can see imprints on the box from where the cellophane used to rest.  They are obviously just reusing real boxes.</li>
    <li> I have loved this fragrance for a while now and it&#x27;s so lovely and long lasting!</li>
    <li> My wife loves this fragrance and she was  thrilled when she received it as a gift! I also love the way it smells on her!</li>
    <li> Love this.  I get more compliments on this than any other.  Men will stop me in the street, to ask what I am wearing, pretty cool when you are my age.  It stays on and lasts all day long.</li>
    <li> Always get compliments when I wear this fragrance.</li>
    <li> Great value and fast shipping. Very please with this product.</li>
    <li> Love this perfume ... It&#x27;s the only one I wear... It&#x27;s my signature scent and I always get compliments on it from men and women..!</li>
    <li> I have been using Addict parfum for years &amp; for some reason this time around the scent does not smell as lovely as usual. Has it been diluted in any way?  Please advise.  Many people have always complimented me on Addict, but not this time around.</li>
    <li> I am truly addicted! I constantly get compliments wherever I go and am always questioned as to what scent I&#x27;m wearing. I&#x27;m hooked for life!</li>
    <li> This is one of the most unique fragrances I have ever purchased &amp; I just love it!  I must say it is my &amp;#34;new favorite&amp;#34; &amp; it has had some fierce competition with others I own but this one is a step ahead of my other faves!  I tend to go for the more woodsy fragrances as I am not at all attracted to the sweet, floral type of perfumes &amp; the notes in Addict, i.e. mandarin &amp; others.  Just love it.</li>
    <li> Love this formulation.  I have read other reviews for the new formula, in the white box, and was concerned that I would get that item.  Once received, I was glad to see it was the original, in the silver box, and the scent is as wonderful as always!</li>
    <li> my wife will love this one.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this smell It lasts all day and all night and gets better as the day goes by. as a matter of fact I have a scarf that I spray this perfume on and it still smells like it after 3 days. very good purchase. I will be shopping!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with my item I bought on Amazon.com. Dior is my favourite one and I&#x27;ll buy moro things on your site when it is possible for me</li>
    <li> I wore this perfume one day we had a delivery were i work the guy came to me to sign the paper he stood next to me and started sniffing out loud i ask him if he sniffing me and he said did i do that out loud i said yes he said but you smell so good that is one of the many complements i get from this product.......love it</li>
    <li> Well I don&#x27;t hate Addict because it was always my favorite perfume,&lt;br /&gt;but the bottle I received has no smell to it.  I can&#x27;t smell it , my&lt;br /&gt;husband can&#x27;t, and friends can&#x27;t.  It was always a scent that stayed&lt;br /&gt;with me and people would always remark how good it smelled on&lt;br /&gt;me.  So I don&#x27;t know if this is a defective bottle or what.  So I&#x27;m&lt;br /&gt;disappointed and didn&#x27;t know how to do anything about it.  If I had&lt;br /&gt;bought it from a store, I would have taken it back.  Then this came&lt;br /&gt;on my screen, so it&#x27;s giving me a chance to talk to someone about it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s expensive, especially when it doesn&#x27;t smell.  Thanks, Carol</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance and get compliments on it all the time.  The price was good compared to department store.</li>
    <li> Excellent! My wife loved it and I loved the less than retail price!</li>
    <li> Great scent! Great price!</li>
    <li> Great product.Shipped quickly</li>
