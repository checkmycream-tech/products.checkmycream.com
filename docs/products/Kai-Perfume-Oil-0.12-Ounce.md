<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This smells like gardenias. I have gotten several compliments on how nice i smell. It is light and not offensive. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I received this from Birchbox or Popsugar (I can&#x27;t remember which) and realized it was difficult to buy in my area. I am so happy Amazon is selling this product because I am in love with it. I&#x27;m not a person crazy about heavy perfumes. I opt for lighter fragrances usually in oil form. This is so perfect that I was angry that mine was running out. Well, at least until I figured out Amazon sells it. It&#x27;s just such a perfect scent, I get compliments on it all the time.</li>
    <li> I first found Kai perfume while shopping in a little boutique store. The Perfume oil was almost $60, which I thought was outrageous for the size. Went to Amazon and found it 1/2 price! Can&#x27;t beat that. I receive so many compliments when I wear it - it&#x27;s a light, clean, floral smell..... I plan on ordering other items from Kai.</li>
    <li> The perfume in itself is lovely as ever, but again the lasting power of it is just not there again.</li>
    <li> i brought this for a gift for a family member and she just loves the smell and how long it last. she is so happy with it she wants to buy more of the product.</li>
    <li> I wanted a perfume that would take me back to the islands.  A fresh but flowery smell that reminded me of Hawaii.  This is it, smells like tuberoses.  I love it.  I am going to wear this for my wedding.</li>
    <li> Smells great. Very strong and fresh. Think of layering this with a mild smelling vanilla lotion.</li>
    <li> Kai fragrance is sophisticated and unique -- definitely not an in-your-face scent... it&#x27;s by far my favorite perfume. The roll-on oil isn&#x27;t as long-lasting as the spray-on perfume, but that&#x27;s ok. It&#x27;s very small so you can carry it with you, even in a very small purse. I use the oil during the day/work-time, and I use the perfume at night on evenings out.  The fragrance is truly of gardenias, maybe some jasmine and frangipani. The scent reminds me of my past trips to Fiji and Hawaii!</li>
    <li> I love this scent - it supposedly wears different on everyone, depending on your body composition.  It&#x27;s a light gardenia scent, and while I normally stick to sweeter/citrus perfumes (I can&#x27;t stand musky or flowery scents... rose and vanilla are also scent nightmares for me), Kai is perfectly light and fragrant.  It smells fresh and isn&#x27;t overbearing.  The only problem with the roll-on is that it doesn&#x27;t last very long or provide a very strong application.  Actually, the spray perfume also wears out quickly... I find myself spraying in the morning and reapplying with the roll on later in the day.  The portability of the roll-on is perfect, but I&#x27;ve lost one before out of my clutch b/c the size is so small.  This stuff ain&#x27;t cheap so keep an eye on it!</li>
    <li> I purchased this fragrance because of the great reviews, but I have to say that I am very disappointed. I was expecting a nice tropical floral type of scent, but this has a bit of a medicinal scent to it, like cough syrup and gardenias. It didn&#x27;t smell very good, and after about 30 minutes, I couldn&#x27;t smell anything at all (which was okay, actually, because I didn&#x27;t care for the scent). Also, it&#x27;s kind of expensive, especially for a fragrance that doesn&#x27;t last at all. It&#x27;s a shame, because I was really looking forward to this one. I feel like I wasted my money on this one, and I definitely will not be buying it again in the future.</li>
    <li> it was a little strong for my my taste</li>
    <li> Oh, I love this stuff! I stumbled upon it accidentally when I bought a group of perfume/sample items through a secondhand reuse app, and an almost full roll-on bottle of Kai was included in it (a huge score!). Seriously, I&#x27;ve never been as addicted to a fragrance before as when I tried this at first. (Maybe one came close.) I wasn&#x27;t sure if the Amazon version would be legit as I&#x27;ve tried knock-offs that don&#x27;t get it right whatsoever, but this was the real deal!</li>
    <li> i love kai the perfume. addicted to the smell. cant get enough and i have not felt like that about a scent in a long time. the aroma is fresh and clean and very romantic. the reason i give this little oil bottle 3 stars is because i found the scent to be very light in comparison to the regular perfume bottle. i bought this one thinking that it will be great for traveling and keeping in my purse.... and it is... it just is very light and does not last long. buy the big bottle of regular perfume.... it is worth every sCENT...</li>
    <li> Bought this one for my mom-in-law because she smelled it on me and loved it.</li>
    <li> I saw this perfume oil at a lodge spa in Stowe Vermont.  I kept browsing in the spa area just so I could keep testing the fragrance. I ended up leaving the lodge without purchasing it, only because time got away from me.  For some reason I kept thinking about the smell so I ended up finding it here on amazon, which I was really surprised to.  I thought it would have been hard to find.  I am so happy I purchased this, it is my favorite fragrance now.  I get completments all the time. If you like fresh smells with a hit of floral then this is the one.  It reminds me alittle of a whiff of faint jasmine. It is a small bottle but it is very concentrated so you only need alittle.  Another thing I love so much about it is that it is so small I keep it in my bag and apply throughout the day as I need to, which isnt very much.   One last point is that I am happy to have found a signature fragrance one that I can wear year round and one that not many people have.    PS - I never ever write reviews so that should say alot.</li>
    <li> I really loved Kia.  I was really hesitant about buying at 1st because of such a small amount for the price.  I absolutely loved it.  It has a lasting scent that stays in your clothes.  I will most definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> I was excited to find this at Amazon as it is a lot more expensive her locally at a boutique I usually buy it from.  The scent is so fresh and subtle.  Being an athlete, I don&#x27;t wear a lot of fragrances, but I always put on my Kai oil because it smells so clean and tropical.  Reminds me of Hawaii!</li>
    <li> Fresh and clean fragrance - perfect size for travel.</li>
    <li> Traditionally, I don&#x27;t like roll-on applicators, but this applicator hasn&#x27;t dried out or over-produced the product. The scent speaks for itself. I constantly get compliments on it, and more importantly, it always makes me feel good. Very good price, by the way--it usually sells for more.</li>
    <li> Wonderful frangrance, femine and delicate without being overpowering!  Don&#x27;t let the size deter you this is a pure oil, so 1/8 ounce lasts for quite awhile.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love Kai perfume!  The oil makes the scent stay on longer and the size is small enough to keep in my purse. I can&#x27;t tell you how many compliments I get when I wear it.  I am not a big perfume lover but love this scent because it is a light fresh flower smelling scent that is not over powering. It smells like Hawaii!!!</li>
    <li> Originally found this in a ChiChi in Santa Barbara, CA and my wife (and I) love it.  So much more convenient here as we are in CT.</li>
    <li> this stuff is pricey but the best perfume i&#x27;ve ever had. everyone loves it, men and women! it&#x27;s superlative to anything i&#x27;ve ever had. much more natural than their mist spray...</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this fragrance!! I have been looking for a new gardenia perfume ever since Crabtree &amp; Evelyn discontinued their gardenia product. I have tried many, but nothing compares to wonderful Kai! I have also now purchased the lotion and the perfume spray and they are all fantastic!!</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance. It&#x27;s long lasting and potent.</li>
    <li> I have used this perfume for years now and it&#x27;s my absolute favorite.  I will continue to purchase it on Amazon, because there is no reason to spend more money at a store (such a good deal on amazon).  I always get comments on how great I smell and people asking me what I am wearing.    This is a very small bottle of oil, and I use it sparingly.  It continues to be my favorite, it is something I carry with me in my purse.  Love Love it.</li>
    <li> My favorite smell ever !!! Kai is soft and beautiful  I love the way it smells I order the lotion too</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this perfume.  So lovely.</li>
    <li> I found this perfume in a small boutique and instantly fell in love with the scent.  It&#x27;s sweet, fresh, flowery and subtle.  It&#x27;s not over powering at all, and it lasts unlike the alcohol based perfumes.  Because it&#x27;s an oil, you don&#x27;t need a lot.  The bottle with the roller top is super convenient to use, you just glide it over the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also the type of person who likes to change my perfume according to the season.  Kai is perfect for spring and summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was not sure what I was going to do when I no longer lived conveniently to the boutique where I initially purchased the perfume, so I was super thrilled to find it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Expensive in a tiny bottle</li>
    <li> Nice light fragrance.  Love to wear it after a shower.  Came across this product in a hotel in Puerto Rico and had to research it back home (NJ) so I could purchase it.</li>
    <li> If you haven&#x27;t been to Hawaii (I haven&#x27;t) I would imagine Kai is what Hawaii smells like.  This clean fresh scent made from gardenias and other essential oils will take you on a vacation even in the middle of winter.  Amazon also has the best prices.  I have also indulged in the body shimmer for after shower AND the body puff that comes in a 2 pack and is worth every penny.  Pamper yourself or someone you love.  You will not regret it.</li>
    <li> Smells great but not very long-lasting at all. I throw it in my makeup bag and just use it when I&#x27;m touching up lipstick for a pop of scent. Wish there was something stronger on the market.</li>
    <li> love love LOVE this scent and I also love the roller ball portion of it. so easy to use and very convenient for in my purse.</li>
    <li> I love the scent and it lasts a long time</li>
    <li> I love this perfume :)</li>
    <li> A great soft but alluring perfume that does not overwhelm yet is obviously present. A great perfume to travel with.</li>
    <li> love love love...this fragrance reminds me of the sun lotion that I use...have gotten so many compliments..will buy again for sure</li>
    <li> Love the fresh fragrance of Kai.  The scent lasts.  The roll on dispenser dispenses small amounts which is great.  Perfect to keep in your purse.</li>
    <li> i love this perfume. A little goes a long way. This little bottle will last a loooooooonnnnggggg time. Great buy.</li>
    <li> This is a perfect light spring/summer scent.  I&#x27;ve worn it for several years now and continue to get compliments.  Since it&#x27;s made by a smaller company in Malibu, it&#x27;s also not something everyone has, which is nice.</li>
    <li> A gentle scent that does not you knock you over &amp; it isn&#x27;t too strong. Stays on for quite a while.</li>
    <li> I found Kai when I was on Catalina in C.C. Gallaghers boutique. However, it is very hard to find in stores. Thank you Amazon! It has a very light flowery scent, and unoffensive. I think that each Kai product smells a little different because of the base. So, this smells slightly different than the spray which is alcohol based. The oil is the best deal. It lasts a long time, fits easily in your purse and is inexpensive for what you get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will get tons of compliments!</li>
    <li> Great scent, I have gotten compliments, just sometimes smells a little more floral than I like.  I might try the spray scent as well to see if that is different.</li>
    <li> way too tiny. Doesn&#x27;t smell  very much.</li>
    <li> This is a particularly nice fragrance, that I always get compliments on.  It doesn&#x27;t last for ages, but is so small (frangrance oil) that you can easily put in your hand bag.  Not cheap, but Amazon gives you the best price.</li>
    <li> This perfume bottle is so convenient and perfect size for my purse.  The roll on makes it easy to apply just the right amount.  The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is personal preference.  It is just a bit too gardenia smelling for me but I will definitely wear it and be reminded of Hawaii flowers when I do.</li>
    <li> Gotta say that I didn&#x27;t care for the scent initially, but after it blended with my own body chemistry, it smelled wonderful.  Definitely my new go to scent for summer.</li>
    <li> Beautiful scent in oil form. Wish more perfumes were available in oil. Only gardenia light and natural, never overpowering. Would love everyday if more affordable.</li>
    <li> This is the best perfume.  It is natural smelling and not too strong.  Just right. It reminds me of Hawaii!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t imagine this not in my purse.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect size, perfect fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;It was worth every penny. Exactly as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;Deb</li>
    <li> This Kai perfume oil is amazing!  Not only does it smell amazing it stays all day. It&#x27;s the perfect size to fit in my purse. I will be ordering this over and over again!</li>
    <li> Get smell and it just gets better as the day wears on.  Yes it is a small vial but a little goes a long way since it is concentrated oil. Just a quick dab on the wrist and maybe on the neck and I can smell this stuff all day!</li>
    <li> I love this smell of this perfume!!  Will be ordering in the future</li>
    <li> I love this perfume oil. Light, flowery, and really beautiful. People will ask you what your wearing. I just love it.</li>
    <li> Clean and fresh, makes me feel good when I wear it.&lt;br /&gt;Plus, getting compliments on how I smell is really nice! :)</li>
    <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this perfume!</li>
    <li> I love Kai! It is a lush, but clean, green gardenia scent. One of the most realistic gardenia scents I have ever found.</li>
    <li> I bought this in the smallest size they have to give it a try. I am so in love with Kai :) What a nice clean yet feminine fragrance! The oil lasts a very long time on you. If you like a really clean fragrance, you might give this one a try! I will be asking for more for Christmas!</li>
    <li> Nice fresh floral scent.</li>
    <li> It is a wonderful scent, not too strong.  It doesn&#x27;t last as long as some other scents, though.  I always have people telling me how good I smell.</li>
    <li> This oil is fine, however, it is not as satisfying as the Kai Perfume Oil I had purchased on Catalina Island&lt;br /&gt;last year -  this scent does not linger as long as the other - but it&#x27;s ok - however, I would have to think&lt;br /&gt;twice about ordering another.</li>
    <li> Perfumes work differently on individual bodies&#x27; chemistry.  I loved this on my friend.  Sadly, on me, it was way too sweet.</li>
    <li> Of all the island themed scents, this one truly reminds me of my time in Maui, Hawaii! I like the roll on to carry in my purse and I also have the perfume spray for home. I never want to be with out this scent because it takes me back to happy times in Hawaii and makes me happy when I wear it. I have tried other island themed scents such as Michael Kors Island and a few others but none of them come close to the true plumeria scent and it is strong and lasts a long time. Everone always asks me what I am wearing!</li>
    <li> What can I say... I&#x27;ve been wearing this for years and it is such a classic smell and the perfume lasts forever on your skin... Retains such a lovely smell even after a full day of wearing it.</li>
    <li> I like the ease of this roller ball perfume application.  Like other users mentioned, the scent did not last as long as I hoped for but because it&#x27;s a small bottle and easy to apply I was able to re-apply whenever I wanted.  To me the smell is very fresh and flowery.</li>
    <li> This is a very clean fragrance.  Perfect for summer.  Would recommend it . The price is very reasonable.  Wish it came in a larger size</li>
    <li> Love it!  I use the KAI Body Oil Spray with the perfume oil and the beautiful floral scent last all day.  Wish the bottle was bigger it is pricey for the amount.</li>
    <li> I was hoping for a little stronger scent of Gardenia, but it is still nice.  I agree with others, the scent is short-lived and maybe be stronger in forms other than the oil.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy the smell of this oil. I haven&#x27;t gotten any compliments but I wear it for me. My husband can&#x27;t smell. I wish the bottle was bigger because for the price I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s worth it. The smell doesn&#x27;t last. I am ordering the lotion to hopefully help.</li>
    <li> Love it, have had it before. I will order the spray I think next time, it&#x27;s a bit easier to use</li>
    <li> If you love the smell of gardenias this is the perfume for you. It&#x27;s wonderful</li>
    <li> Love, love, LOVE this scent. I am usually super sensitive to scents and get migraines. I have no problems with this easy to use roll on perfume. keep it in my purse. get sooo many compliments.</li>
    <li> Kai is my favorite scent, and the little roller bottle is perfect for keeping in my purse or for travel.</li>
    <li> Too much Gardenia concentrate.  A present for my daughter whom married in Maui and she immediately started sneezing after apply a small amount</li>
    <li> I heard so much about this perfume oil, and it is ok, but not what I expected.  It was very pricey, and it really didn&#x27;t have a lasting scent.</li>
    <li> my girl saw it in a store for $80.. i said hell no and found it on amazon for dirt cheap! great buy!!</li>
    <li> Beautiful....I enjoyed dry much but used it quite fast during the summer months. It&#x27;s tiny and really won&#x27;t last very long but it is so much better than spending more for fragrances that are not made of natural oils. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love the fragrance.  I get many compliments on it and two friends already ordered it!  The small bottle is excellent since I travel extensively for my job.</li>
    <li> Ordered multiple times. Smells good on everyone. I love this product.</li>
    <li> MY FAVORITE PERFUME. I love oil perfumes, to me they seem to last a bit longer, but who knows. This smell is HEAVENLY it smells like a garden and it is such a refreshing, clean smell--I cannot express how much I love Kai, I have always loved Kai and always will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AMAZING&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(also love their body butter and loofahs!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning though, they say that kai smells differently on everyone? I believe that is true for all perfumes, so obviously not everyone may love how this smells on them (once I bought my friends perfume because it smelled so nice, and on me it made me nauseous...) anyway, LOVE KAI, WORTH TRYING, FRESH CLEAN DELICIOUS SMELL</li>
    <li> love this scent.  simple, clean, smells like lilacs.  i&#x27;m a sucker for roller ball perfume.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite fragrance. And the price was right.. Will order again...</li>
    <li> i absolutely LOVE the smell of this oil.  it dries fast and it actually smells better and better as the day goes on. highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> Small like bottle which is great for traveling, and it delivers a wonderful small. It makes me remember Hawaii vacations.</li>
    <li> I love the perfume oil.</li>
    <li> I have been wanting this for a while but did not want to pay the $42 plus retail cost at stores close to me.  I put it on my wish list and waited for the price to be right ! A little present to myself.  I always get complimented when I wear it -be forewarned very flowery and tropical for those of you with allergies. :)</li>
    <li> This little bottle contains the sweetest smell, I just absolutely love it.  Don&#x27;t need a lot to go a long way.</li>
    <li> This Kai on Amazon isn&#x27;t the real Kai. I decided to take it to a test. I bought the real one from Barney&#x27;s and this fake one from amazon. I want to see the difference. And let me tell you it&#x27;s very very subtle. I made the smell test and my boyfriend couldn&#x27;t even tell the difference between the two. The only difference would be that the fake one doesn&#x27;t last as long as the real one. The fake one also has this subtle weird smell but just very very little almost unnoticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the real one for almost $50 and the fake one is $38. I still prefer the real one but it&#x27;s so pricey for such a tiny bottle. I&#x27;m gonna continue using and update my reviews later.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a favorite of a friend.  Perfect size for a purse or little cosmetic bag.  Smells really yummy.</li>
    <li> This Kai Perfume Oil smells very nice.  The product was delivered in good time and good packaging.  The only reason I am rating four stars rather than five is the price ~ kind of pricey for small bottle.</li>
    <li> I received my perfume and 10 minutes after putting it on I needed to take a bath to scrub it off. I tried to wear it again today and no way. I get that scents smell different on everybody but I can&#x27;t imagine this stuff smelling good on anyone. I&#x27;ve contacted the seller to ask for a refund. It&#x27;s so bad I was wondering if I got a bad batch (if that&#x27;s even possible). I will tell you a great perfume oil to try and that&#x27;s Child by Apothia...you definitely won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I smelled this in a spa and then ordered it online.  Smelled totally different. I want to return it!</li>
    <li> I LOVE the Kai scent (fresh gardenias) though for some reason, the bottle I received recently didn&#x27;t smell exactly the same as it used to. The scent also didn&#x27;t last as long. Perhaps the batch was made differently. I was a bit disappointed. I&#x27;d still order this product again, but maybe try to layer it with other Kai products. You also need to use it sparingly since the bottle is so small. It&#x27;s wonderful to keep in your purse, though, and I&#x27;ve gotten plenty of compliments on it.</li>
    <li> The smell is beautiful.  Not overpowering and the gardenia is just pleasant.  I recommend this purchase to anyone who wants to wear a fragrance, but not be overpowering.</li>
    <li> I love Kai...this is the perfect little roller-ball to travel with or tuck in an evening bag for a quick touch up. More concentrated than the spray.</li>
    <li> I love it! You can use this under your arms instead of deodorant. As your temperature rises the essence is emitted. It works great.</li>
    <li> Very nice scent. It is one of my favorites. Stays true on skin but doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would like.</li>
    <li> My favorite scent. Wished it lasted longer</li>
    <li> I LOVE this scent - like flowers in Hawaii.  Roll on this oil and it stays on all day...all you need is a little - lasts forever.  Good price and I received it very fast.</li>
    <li> The favorite scent on mine!</li>
    <li> Gardenia...on me smells alright.  Given it is an oil, I would have thought the scent would last longer, alas it does not.  Better deal here than in store.</li>
    <li> I like the oil roller better than a spray perfume.  This smells fantastic, which I already knew because I saw it in a spa.  But instead of buying it there I ordered it on Amazon for half the price. It came fast in the mail.</li>
    <li> Speedy delivery and wonderful product. Thanks!</li>
    <li> my mother fell in love with it &amp; found it at a great price &amp; received quickly</li>
    <li> This oil is scrumptious. The smell and lasting power is amazing. Simply the best. I actually bought another already as a gift.</li>
    <li> Birthday gift she loves this  brand .and was very happy with it .she loves the smell of it.a great find</li>
    <li> favorite fragrence - clean but not too strong. Perfect for the person who doesn&#x27;t normally wear much perfume. Perfect size for purse or cosmetic bag.</li>
    <li> absolutely my favorite hands down</li>
    <li> its not as strong as the spray and doesnt last very long.&lt;br /&gt;I will just get the spray next time.</li>
    <li> LOVE THE FRAGRANCE....SO DOES EVERYONE ELSE...I AM IN HAWAII....WHEN I WEAR IT!</li>
    <li> Really great way to carry a perfume in your purse. Especially if you forget to apply before you leave the house...</li>
    <li> Great smell, long time user of Kai perfume oil and love it very much.  Lasts a long time not overbearing.</li>
    <li> The smell is quite strong (like the essential oils from mecca that hajji&#x27;s get) when you smell it directly from the bottle but more light and floral when you put it on.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Tried it in a boutique for much more.  I was so happy to find it on Amazon for less.</li>
    <li> The Kai exceeded MY love of this fragrance. It passed the ultimate test when my husband said, &amp;#34;you smell beautiful&amp;#34;!  That&#x27;s something because he&#x27;s very picky about scents.  Love it!! Thx for making it so affordable,  too. Katiex</li>
    <li> whenever I have this on people ask me what I&#x27;m wearing. It&#x27;s an amazing natural scent rather than perfumey. I also love that it is a small convenient size for travel. It is pricey but a little goes a long way. I put it behind my knees, at my ankles, pulse points and in between my breasts...if you start to warm up you start sending out a wonderful smell LOL!</li>
    <li> Kai perfum has no authorized dealers on Amazon. I went to the company first because this doesnt last and smells different.  Because i did not get it from an authorized seller i am out of luck.  Check out the web site. There are on line dealers who sell the real perfum, just not on Amzon or ebay</li>
    <li> This bottle is teeny and kind of expensive but that is my ONLY complaint. This small vial contains what I believe to be the most Divine and Delicious perfume in the world! My husband loves it and I get compliments on it all the time when I wear it out! I feel the perfume oil really lasts on my skin and it is super portable. It is not a cloying or overpowering white floral. It almost has a water-y note to it which keeps it smelling clean. I am very happy with my purchase. I wish it wasn&#x27;t so pricey but I believe you pay for it&#x27;s quality and it is so worth it! This fragrance is unique and fabulous!</li>
    <li> fresh and clean smelling perfume that I have ever had. It&#x27;s like being in the tropics everyday. I layer it by using the body wash ,then put some body butter on ending with a little perfume oil. The aroma last through out the day. Not over whelming at all.</li>
    <li> This roll on is TINY.  I guess this is inherent in the size description - but its no bigger than my index finger.  Love Kai, and love the sent.  Came in all its original packaging so i doubt its a &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; as other reviewers have noted. Authorized resellers don&#x27;t negate the authenticity of the perfume.</li>
    <li> First of all I&#x27;d never purchase this Kai Perfume Oil again.  The Kai Bath Wash has more lasting aroma than this O-I-L.  Total waste of money.  I put it on my wrist to test it while in the house, it failed the test; actually it lasted for approximately 5 hrs. continually fading away to NADA.  Think it is better to buy a good eua de parfum and forget this oil thingy.</li>
    <li> Great perfume for a caribbean vacation, and helps remind me of vacation all year! Captivating scent is natural and not overpowering! Bought the dry oil first, then bought this perfume oil because i love it!</li>
    <li> Once you try it you will understand</li>
    <li> Smells of gardenia and is very easy to apply. I absolutely love this perfume and will buy again!  When you first open you will have to roll the ball a number of times to get it to come out, but that is normal and expected</li>
    <li> i just so happen to love this fragrance. it may or may not have something to do with my son having the same name.</li>
    <li> Not a stong overpowering scent just a light elegant scent, that makes me feel pretty.</li>
    <li> What a great deal! This is the best perfume oil! Not too overpowering but still really feminine. This usually retails for around $48 in boutiques, so I couldn&#x27;t believe I found this at such a steal. Plus the shipping was about a week sooner than predicted. I would HIGHLY recommend this!!!</li>
    <li> Stocking stuffer for family member who recommended Kai deodorant.</li>
    <li> Daughter-in-law wanted this for Christmas and she seems please with it.  She said the smell last a lot longer than regular perfume.</li>
    <li> too strong scent! I can&#x27;t use this perfume oil; it almost makes me sick and could call it an odor instead of a scent! I was very disappointed!</li>
    <li> Love the roll on oil.  Lasting scent.  Nice and clean, not overpowering.</li>
    <li> I know it is supposed to smell different on different people, but this batch smelled different than the one I purchased retail.  I don&#x27;t recommend buying this online because it may smell unexpected.</li>
    <li> Fresh Gardenias! Scent last a long time! I get heaps of compliments! Elegant, young and fresh! For all ages!</li>
    <li> I really enjoy Kai products. I am immediately transported to the islands. Just a tiny bit of the oil lasts all day.</li>
    <li> I have loved this scent ever since I got a sample in Hawaii.  It was always a little more than I wanted to pay, until I found it on Amazon.  The scent is extremely light, and smells of plumeria, gardenia, and paradise.  Not only is it a great scent, but Kai also takes a stand against animal testing!</li>
    <li> So I guess you know I love this perfume! I feel like I&#x27;m in Hawaii every time I wear Kai!</li>
    <li> A great scent for those who love something light and different.  Makes a perfect gift for girl on the go!</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift for my daughter. She loves Kai products and tried this and now it is one of her favorites.</li>
    <li> Smells lovely-it has a very floral gardenia scent. Size is small for the price, but it should last for a while.</li>
    <li> THIS SCENT WAS SO OVERHYPED WITH PSEUDO CELEBRITY ENDORSEMENT AND OVER ZEALOUS CONSUMERS WHO SAY IT SMELLS SO GREAT SO THEY CAN SMELL LIKE SOMEONE FAMOUS. THE SCENT IS SO ONE DIMENSIONAL AND THE FURTHEST SCENT OF WHAT I WOULD CONSIDER PARADISE. SAVE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY...STEAL A COUPLE OF GARDENIA PETALS FROM AN UNSUSPECTING NEIGHBOR AND RUB ALL OVER...THAT&#x27;S KAI!...ABSOLUTELY DISAPPOINTING FRAGRANCE EXPERIENCE! BUT AN ABSOLUTELY SENSATIONAL MARKETING CAMPAIGN TAGLINE...\\&quot;LET&#x27;S SEE HOW MANY IDIOTS WE CAN GET TO BUY THIS CRAP\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Adore this fresh fragrance</li>
    <li> I loved the fresh clean scent. My grand daughter (seven years old) sat on my lap and said I smelled delicious.</li>
    <li> I have the Marc Jacobs Gardenia, which I love, but this perfume gives me headaches. I hadn&#x27;t smelled it before ordering, but just based it on others reviews.  From the couple times that I have tried it, I had to remove it shortly after putting it on, and still, it seems to last a very long time. I certainly would recommend that you smell it before ordering. Perfumes don&#x27;t normally give me headaches but for some reason this one does.. Smells very pretty, but also very floraly, so if you are a floral person then maybe this is the one for you (I don&#x27;t normally like strong floral scents, I think this one was just too strong for me).  Pretty otherwise.</li>
    <li> Received item very promptly and it was exactly as described!</li>
    <li> Smells good, it reminds me the smell from the air in Hawaii. Absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this scent.  I was at a store in Newport RI and bought some spray.  I couldn&#x27;t get over the lovely scent, and came home and ordered the oil from Amazon.  I have yet to have someone compliment me on this scent, which surprises me!! I think it is the best smelling perfume I have ever come across.  The gardenia scent reminds me of fresh flowers and the beach.  Love this stuff.</li>
    <li> Light and floral. Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I adore the fragrance of the oil...stays on so long.</li>
    <li> My very favorite. Like gardenias and love rolled into one. I&#x27;m really not a perfume girl, but this is so natural and smells so inviting. Tons of compliments when I wear it.</li>
    <li> The perfect fragrance of fresh gardenia or Hawaiian pikake. Has an incredibly uplifting scent that is easy to wear for any occasion!</li>
    <li> Obsessed!!!! Smells wonderful</li>
    <li> I was very unhappy with this product.  I have used the perfume in the past and because of rating here I thought I would try the oil.  It just doesn&#x27;t do the job.  Even layering with the lotion, you lose the scent so quickly no one knows you have it on.  I would not spend the exorbitant amount of money for this oil again.</li>
    <li> Expensive for the amount you get, but I can&#x27;t resist the scent!</li>
    <li> Those people who gave this scent 1 star and bad review must be very sensitive to smells.  This scent is soft yet you can still smell it and it last all day long.  Very sexy.  I wear it to work and everyone asks what i have on.  I will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Wonderful fragrance &amp; perfect travel companion.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance &amp; bought the oil truly thinking it would last longer than an hour on me... very frustrating.The price is costly for such a little tiny bottle; however, I was willing to pay it, convinced that an oil would have a longer-lasting fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to return it, but reconsidered .. mostly b/c it&#x27;s always a hassle for everyone involved to return items.&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, Thanks for the opportunity to express my disappointment. .Linda R.</li>
    <li> For whatever reason, every time I wear this fragrance men compliment me on the scent. Not men I know and not my husband, but complete strangers. I actually had a waiter ask to smell me one day when I was wearing this fragrance. It&#x27;s a little strange but I wear it because I also absolutely love the scent. It is light and floral, and long-lasting. I also really love the body lotion.</li>
