      <li>I continue to replace the heads on my trusty Norelco every year and it continues to function as new after 10 years.  </li>

    <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with an original product.</li>
    <li> Bought for my dad and he says they work great!</li>
    <li> the blades lasted over 12 years when Norelco owner the company. Philips has reduced the quality of the metal to last two and a half. months</li>
    <li> Product wasn&#x27;t delivered until the 23rd, but was in delivery time set. Product exactly as described and works perfectly. I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
    <li> I continue to replace the heads on my trusty Norelco every year and it continues to function as new after 10 years.  The shipper did nice job of getting it out quick and to me in 2 days with best price on the net - no issues - just excellent service and excellent product.  Nice to have replacement parts readily available - a key in any purchase decision on shavers.    Jim</li>
    <li> Item came promptly. Really noticed improved performance of shaver!  Very pleased that I purchased this item!</li>
    <li> Meets all expectations</li>
    <li> After a year or so of regular use, the blades of your electric shaver get duller and the shave quality suffers.  Replacement heads solve this problem effectively.  These replacement blades did make a significant improvement to shave quality.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t never believe that I bought a product at Amazon.com that was listed \\&quot;NEW\\&quot; but it actually was opened product before.  The seller should explained it on the descriptions.</li>
    <li> My husband would complain every morning when he was shaving with his electric razor and I was complaining because his shave wasn&#x27;t close enough and that was when I realized that his razor needed new heads. I ordered the replacement for the Norelco razor and there has been peace in the family since he got the new heads. I would highly recommend this item to anyone who is getting half shaved and aggravated every time while shaving with an older razor.</li>
    <li> My razor stated that I needed to replace the head, and this was the one that I choose.  The price seemed fair, I did not do any real research, but it beats buying a new razor!  The head appears to be an exact duplicate of the one that I had in my razor, it fits like the original and, yes, I can tell a difference in the shave.  The package came in a matter of days, from my order: the head was in the ubiquitous sealed, plastic packing container.  Great shipping, great shave, very happy customer!</li>
    <li> The deleviry was on time.  The new head caued my shaving machine to work better.  Instead of buying new machune - replacing the head did the job</li>
    <li> I have bought at least three sets of heads for this electric razor,they have a use life of about a year, then they need repaacing.</li>
    <li> Husband was delighted to get the new replacement head.  He really enjoys his shaver.</li>
    <li> My first razor lasted me 20 years without any replacement blades.  It was a self sharpening.  Now, they found it much more profitable to   replace the blades every year.  I&#x27;ve looked for razor with self sharpening blades.  I wouldn&#x27;t mind   paying a little more up front for it, but they don&#x27;t make them any more.  My blades are pretty much unusable after one year now.  I have to buy  a new replacement set for $39.  Next, I think they&#x27;ll discontinue the old blades, forcing you to buy a new  razor as well.</li>
    <li> Took it to Brazil to have a spare!</li>
    <li> It was taking me 20 min to shave with my old razor.  I was going to buy a new one and decided to try just replacing the heads.  WOW what a difference.  I can shave in less than a few minutes and my face is smooth.  Great feeling and great product!!</li>
    <li> Worked as advertised.</li>
    <li> Came without the original box, not sure it wasn&#x27;t used. Surprised when the gift was opened. Learned not to wrap shipping packages.</li>
    <li> This has been a fiasco. I have yet to receive the correct heads from you. I had returned the ones that you had incorrectly shipped to me. However, I did receive the ones I had ordered from the person to whom you incorrectly had shipped to them.</li>
    <li> The blades fit perfectly in my shaver and came with blade covers.  The shaver works like new now.</li>
    <li> Easy to install and the razor cuts like brand new.</li>
    <li> Item ordered was item shipped.  Arrived USPS undamaged.&lt;br /&gt;Happy to have nice sharp blades again, used last set for over three years...I think I got my moneys worth.</li>
    <li> Very good OK . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .&lt;br /&gt;I found this item on the ebay</li>
    <li> Have been a loyal Norelco  user essentially al my life (shaving anyway). This set of blades fit right in and will be well used.</li>
    <li> Works well with older shaver. Would purchase again from Amazon. Would also recommend this product to my friends , neighbors and family for future purchases.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll buy these again when the time comes. Works as advertised.</li>
    <li> After a few years, my shaver didn&#x27;t seem to cut well so it was time for some new blades. I like the shaver so I would rather replace the heads than buy a new one and throw away a perfectly good unit. These gave new life to my Norelco shaver.</li>
    <li> Good a little hard to put in the shaver. Yes to anyone who wanted to replace there heads. Arrived on ti</li>
    <li> I now have a new razor for one half the cost.  That is good for me and the environment.  We should all think of things like that.</li>
    <li> I factory replacement for Norelco and Phillips electric shavers. The three heads supplied fit the indicated shavers and were manufactured better than the originals that I replaced. I want people to know that they will need to refer to their owners manuals for head replacement or go to the internet, since there are no instructions included with the heads.</li>
    <li> Amazon is the best Net resource bar none!</li>
    <li> These replacement heads bought through Amazon are the least expensive and work like a gem. Like getting a new shaver with the close cutting and no discomfort.</li>
    <li> You Get It 20 usage hussle times 36 dollars... Go Bit USA...</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with the product &amp; speed of service.  Also GREAT price......THANK YOU!!!</li>
    <li> This is just what I was needing and didn&#x27;t know it. My shaving kept leaving my face sore, until I got the new Norelco shaving heads. Now my shaving is just as good as when the shaver was new.</li>
    <li> My razor didn&#x27;t gripe, why should we?</li>
    <li> What can you say about replacement razor heads.  The reason I bought these thru Amazon was Walmart never has them.  You can buy the razor there, but forget - at least at Walmart near us - ever finding the proper replacement heads there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the next time I need the razor, I&#x27;ll get thru Amazon also.</li>
    <li> Fits. But does not include the plastic frame pictured on the box. The manufacturer is to blame for this deception, not the vendor.</li>
    <li> No frills - cames as promised at a good price that made it worth while to hold on to the razor and not start fresh with a new one.</li>
    <li> got this on time, fit perfect. Thanks</li>
    <li> just as described and works well.</li>
    <li> Loved the blades. Made a big difference  in my shave.</li>
    <li> ARRIVED IN GREAT TIME AND JUST AS LISTED</li>
    <li> The new blades make a big difference.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised.  Nice and sharp.  Easy to replace.</li>
    <li> These are OEM blades and work great. Replaced my 2 year old ones and it&#x27;s a major difference!</li>
    <li> My old shaver just keeps on going.  As long as I can find these every year or  two I&#x27;ll keep using it.</li>
    <li> Another great deal for the price - like I had a new razor</li>
    <li> I have used these replacement heads a number of times and they always work well, and last a couple of years.</li>
    <li> Just as expected. No surprises</li>
    <li> It is like buying a brand new razor.</li>
    <li> Works well and I would purchase this item again as needed. Something that can be replaced as needed with a click of a mouse.</li>
    <li> Works well. Spendy but a needed item. They seem to last quite a wile as well. Go buy one. &#x3D;</li>
    <li> After popping these in I did the same test I did when I purchases my Norelco Shaver. The next day after shaving the night before with a quad blade disposable I ran the Norelco over my face and when I opened the head and tapped it on the side of my sink about an eighth of a teaspoon of stuble dropped out. Funny, I said the same thing two years earlier. Looks just like fine ground pepper.</li>
    <li> Cuts 100% better than my old heads and much quieter. Like new razor since I changed heads.</li>
    <li> Made my shaver work like new. You really need new blades about once a year for these shavers to work well. These blades were an exact replacement.</li>
    <li> These are an exact replacement.</li>
    <li> Seem to loose their sharpness pretty quickly.</li>
    <li> Returned because the shaver it was to be used on quit working.</li>
    <li> Hadn&#x27;t replaced in a few years.  Didn&#x27;t realize how bad the old blades had gotten.  Plugged in these replacements and the shaver is working as expected again.  I won&#x27;t wait so long next time to replace the heads on the shaver.  Once you start feeling the tug of hair at the heads, it&#x27;s definitely time to replace them.  I&#x27;ll order this product again.</li>
    <li> MY RAZOR PERFORMS MUCH BETTER.  THE REPLACEMENT HEAD IS BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL.  I WOULD PURCHASE AGAIN IN THE FUTURE.</li>
    <li> This set of replacement heads clearly is not as good as previous ones that I purchased.  The shaver is noticeably louder and the shave is not as close.  I really wonder whether or not the heads are genuine Norelco.</li>
    <li> Cuts very well. I just wish they would last longer. You are doing well if they will last a full year.</li>
    <li> This is a terrific product. These are genuine replacements, not some cheap knock-offs. They arrived earlier than promised. The installation instructions were easy to follow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Replacement blades should be replaced once a year. I can&#x27;t believe that my old blades were actually working. I will definitely order again!</li>
    <li> I purchased the new heads for my husband and he said they were easy to install and work just like new!</li>
    <li> The replacement blades were easy to install and are working good.  The packaging was good and it arrived when expected.</li>
    <li> Good replacement blades</li>
    <li> Bought these to replace the heads in my Norelco.  Shaver was fine and still recharging, but not shaving as close as it used to.  Put these in and had to ease up on shaving pressure or shave too close.  Good option if your shaver is still working fine.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for</li>
    <li> Good product and lot cheaper than the cheapest store. Will be back in a few months as I need a new shaver.</li>
    <li> It fit just like the originals. Works and performs just like it was brand new.</li>
    <li> Worked as advertised; no issues.</li>
    <li> What I can I say, I like my shaver.</li>
</ol>
