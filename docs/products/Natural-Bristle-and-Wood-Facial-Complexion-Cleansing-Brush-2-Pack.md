<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have skin discoloration from teenage acne and eczema, I&#x27;ve been using this daily for dry brushing and the dark marks on my face has faded slightly. My skin looks brighter, feels softer and I don&#x27;t apply as much make-up/concealer as before to cover my dark spots. Will continue to use and enjoy! Only negative is that the bristles on the brush sheds a lot.</li>
    <li> I love how my skin feels after I use it</li>
    <li> These are great for exfoliating! I use daily! I recommend this product!</li>
    <li> love these little bushes for my face. They help flake off the dead skin.</li>
    <li> They are great.  Do not shed.</li>
    <li> So scratchy.  I can&#x27;t imagine this is really used on the face.</li>
    <li> These brushes are real nice they seem well made. I am just starting dry brushing, and they are gentle enough for me. The brushing surface is about two inches across.</li>
    <li> These are soft, not medium bristles,  I think I need medium on my specific skin so it&#x27;s difficult to provide a full review.  These brushes are well made and have stood up to my rough dry-brush use.</li>
    <li> I ordered the two brushes in Dec. 2014 and my daughter and I both use one of them. We like them and they work well on the face if you scrub your face gently.</li>
    <li> I would never use these for the face. Super rough bristles - would be damaging to use for the face! If it hadn&#x27;t taken 3 weeks to receive, I would have requested a refund.</li>
    <li> Love this facial Brush .leaves my face so clean n fresh. Gets all the dirt n makeup out of pores.  . Best facial brush.you.can&#x27;t.  go wrong with a naturel brush . Highly recommended</li>
    <li> The brush does not seem to be high quality.  The bristles are stiff especially for the face.  Maybe it&#x27;s supposed to be but it seems too abrasive.  I wanted to wash it before dry brushing since it&#x27;s new but some of the bristles started to fall out. I&#x27;m keeping it though because returning it is a lot of hassle and I&#x27;ll probably end up using for my body.  I would not buy again for the face and am going to try another dry brush.</li>
    <li> Great size for using on your face, however the bristles fall out to quickly.</li>
    <li> A little too rough on my face.</li>
    <li> These are not quite as soft as some I have used in the past. That&#x27;s why I have it 4 instead of 5 stars.  However, they are well constructed and still work well.</li>
    <li> The bristles are very weak which provides little or no facial cleaning action. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Very cool little brushes! They were  a little course for me, but i have sensitive skin. I still use them every day and my skin has definitely benefited</li>
    <li> a wee bit harsher than I hoped it would be but still OK to use.</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s suppose to</li>
    <li> I am 51 and my skin is smoother and softer after just a couple of weeks with using these on my face.  I don&#x27;t find them too rough. Yeah, a couple bristles may fall out here and there, but not a big deal for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use them on my neck and jowl area, too.  Trying to, avoid the wrinkled, sagged look, without resorting to chemicals or procedures.</li>
    <li> The company delivered product extremely fast. With that said I wouldn&#x27;t recommend to no one, the bristles are extremely rough to be used on the face.</li>
    <li> From spouse of account holder. .&lt;br /&gt;Live this facial brush. Makes the face feel refreshed. Amazing what gets built up on the face. A great way to exfoliate while cleansing the face. I like a firm brush and this is a really a worthwhile purchase for me.</li>
    <li> The bristles fall out every time I use it. Super cheaply made.</li>
    <li> Bristles fall out sometimes. Other than that, the duo is nice. It&#x27;s quite rough at first but you will get used to it. I use it almost everyday.</li>
    <li> As others have said, the bristles on this brush are pretty harsh and abrasive. I did what the listing says, which is to soak in warm water, but I can&#x27;t tell a difference at all. The bristles themselves also seem prone to falling out, as some were already coming out or had fallen out by the time they got to me. I&#x27;d look for something else.</li>
    <li> There is no way that these bristles are meant for facial use, unless you are an elephant!</li>
    <li> When used regularly these will make your skin feel smooth like a baby&#x27;s nether regions.</li>
    <li> These bristles were so rough!  And the wood never completely dried out so it stayed moldy!</li>
    <li> I like to use these brushes before I get in the shower, and they work great! My skin is much healthier and smoother. Very glad I got these.</li>
    <li> The face brushes work well. They are reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> The price was low,so is the quality. Lost bristles upon the first use, pretty well useless after about three weeks.</li>
    <li> I love the natural bristle and wood facial brushes.  I use them religiously.  The size perfect to hold to brush my face.  My complexion has improved as far as dry skin.  I am so glad I started using them.  They were delivered in a timely manner and I started using them immediately.  I recommend this brush for all adult ages.</li>
    <li> These Natural Bristle Wood Facial Brushes are amazing! They are exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for! I have only recently started washing my face with a brush recently, and it happened by accident. I have been using those exfoliating facial pads that you can buy 12 to a pack and they have been doing my face more harm than good. I have oily, acne-prone skin so my face needs to be scrubbed on the regular but these pads were way too abrasive. I bought a brush at Target but thought it was too soft and was going to pitch it. But I decided to go ahead and use it and it turns out, it was perfect. Sadly, Target no longer carries the brush so I came to trusted Amazon to find something and came across these natural bristle brushes. Best purchase I&#x27;ve ever made for my face! The bristles are just the right amount of abrasiveness that really gets my skin clean and exfoliated and afterwards my skin is so soft and smooth. I use it once a day, during my nightly face-washing regimen, with regular Dove soap. My moisturizer and makeup go on effortlessly and what&#x27;s more, they have cleared up the acne on my skin! You get two for the price from this great seller and they arrived really quickly. I absolutely love them!!!</li>
    <li> Horrible quality. Cheap junk. Fell apart as soon as I got it wet. Bristles collapsed on themselves and the brush became useless.</li>
    <li> Bristles were not as stiff as I expected, but it&#x27;s probably a good thing as I use these on my face. Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Many users report that these brushes are too spiky and bristley.  That&#x27;s very true, but since you are doing the scrubbing, you can use as light a touch as you wish.  I think of them as mini exfoliators.  They work very well on elbows.</li>
    <li> Horrible both quality and the process to receive.</li>
    <li> The bristles are way too stiff for my face.  They hurt.  They are well made but I&#x27;ll find another use for them.</li>
    <li> These are very harsh for the face.</li>
    <li> Great brush nice and soft for a cheap price!</li>
    <li> The brushes are a little stiff with the first couple of uses, however they do soften with use.  Great for removing dry skin and my facial complexion has improved with using this brush.  I would recommend using 2-3 times per week and not daily. I would recommend this product.  The handle is sturdy and the bristles are easy to clean and dry quickly.  This little brush is better than using the expensive electronic facial scrubbers.</li>
    <li> love using skin shines</li>
    <li> Oh, these are very nice brushes! They are small in size yet perfect for face use. The bristles don&#x27;t fall off at all, and I use it almost every day with no problems,..very durable. Also, it comes in a set of two brushes.</li>
    <li> a little stiff for my sensitive skin but it does the job</li>
    <li> I have just started using this, but it feels good on my skin</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s gentle yet firm enough for a deep clean. My pores always look better after. I use a lot of liquid on the first few uses because the bristles can feel a bit stiff and you don&#x27;t want to damage your skin. Be sure to disinfect the brush regularly.</li>
    <li> Soft brushes for face, work great</li>
    <li> Once I got used to using it, I really enjoyed it.</li>
    <li> Part of my collection of brushes for the latest craze dry skin brushing.</li>
    <li> The bristles were pretty stiff but did the job.</li>
    <li> I ordered these to do dry skin brushing with, I use the Yerba Prima Tampico brush on my body, but that&#x27;s too rough for my face. These are soft, but effective. I&#x27;m glad I purchased them. The only thing I can really say that I think would be helpful is that YES, these fibers are soft enough for the face.</li>
    <li> Bristles come out of the brush all the time  Not good.  Not sure of the brand either.  They just came in a box with no packaging or labels on&lt;br /&gt;them  Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> My skin has never felt so smooth.  Dry brushing is definitely the way to go, the bristles on this were fine for me as I am a male.  I read some females may feel the bristles are too hard but they do soften up with use a bit. great product imo!</li>
    <li> The bristles were way too rough on my skin.</li>
    <li> I have recently started dry face brushing, in addition to the dry body brushing.  These brushes are just perfect for the job.  I love how nice my skin feels after using them.  I have used one and am keeping the other for a replacement.</li>
    <li> Love it just what I needed for my dry skin on my face works great.</li>
    <li> Nothing spectacular about it. Slightly rough and the bristles have been falling off since the first use.</li>
    <li> I use these to dry brush my face and neck. The bristles are course, but not too bad. If you have very sensitive skin I do not recommend these for you. I did notice they start to shed after about a week into use.</li>
    <li> Wash before using in warm soapy water,great product good for drybrushing</li>
    <li> Great price and good quality. Use for face brushing. Perfect!</li>
    <li> I purchased these brushes, because I wanted some that were of a mid-range roughness for dry brushing my face. I have not tried them, but, judging by the feel of the bristles on my hands, I think these are what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Way to rough of a brush for your face.  It simply hurts.</li>
    <li> Like the brush for the exfoliation for sure. The bristles fall out pretty often. Not sure if that is an inconvenience to most people, but there it is.</li>
    <li> As advertised, quick shipment, great product. Recommended seller.</li>
    <li> it is too rough... I can not use it for face.  Nobody I think.  It is almost like a body brush......I may just use it for my neck.. :(</li>
    <li> These are great for getting your face clean.</li>
    <li> Bristles do not hold up very well</li>
    <li> Nice and stiff brushes. Don&#x27;t push too hard when you use them! But my skin was glowing after I used them. I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> Nothing beats natural!</li>
    <li> Great brushes and great price!</li>
    <li> These work and the price is great but the hair of the brush fall out all the time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m covered in bristles whenever I use this. They fall out. I like it other than that. Too stiff for my face, leaves scratches... so I use for hands and feet and it feels good.</li>
    <li> Great little facial brushes, with a longer handle than my last one. Great price for 2 of these. Arrived on time with minimal packaging.</li>
    <li> The bristles fall out when using the brush.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re a good size can&#x27;t wait to use them.</li>
    <li> The bristles are a little scratchy feeling.</li>
    <li> A little too hard for my face. I believe, if, you need to scrub your feet heels, this would be a great brush for that purpose or any small house cleaning project. Sorry, just too hard for my face.</li>
    <li> These are almost too hard for your face.  You need to be quite gentle with these.  Little disappointed, but should have read reviews better.</li>
    <li> Soft enough for the face. Firm enough to make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this review was helpful to you, please click on the YES button below.</li>
    <li> They smell kind of funny and dusty but they still work for me.</li>
