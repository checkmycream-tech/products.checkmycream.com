### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>and that puts me in a good mood!</li>
      <li>It has a great smell as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Smells great and feels great on the skin.</li>
      <li>When I wake up in the morning my skin looks great</li>
      <li>This sleeping mask, I think, is a great alternative as it doesn&#x27;t seem to clog pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love it!!</li>
      <li>It has a very nice texture and fragrance though.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a  good product if you don&#x27;t mind using something that contains parabens in addition to Swiss Alpine extracts.</li>
      <li>/&gt;After this product runs out, Iplan to buy another tube, as there don&#x27;t seem to be very many sleeping packs to experiment with out there, except maybe Mizon.</li>
      <li>Very satisfied.</li>
      <li>and I love it!  </li>
      <li>Although it is a bit pricey for the quantity, it is amazing.</li>
      <li>Makes my skin feel and look amazing the day after I use it.</li>
      <li>it is good but is not heavy duty, probably best for the summer months.</li>
      <li>Leaves a nice mask on your face for sleeping in not oily or greasy at all.</li>
      <li>But this is in all actuality my own fault for letting them sleep in bed with me :)</li>
      <li>i love this product.  </li>
      <li>Most of the product seemed to rub/come off though during the night.</li>
      <li>It came with some free samples which I liked but the mask itself</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed that my makeup is sitting better on my face during the day, too, since using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>So yeah, I love the service as well. &#x3D;)</li>
      <li>I LOVE this mask.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this sleeping mask.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve given this as gifts to many people now.</li>
      <li>It feels very cool and refreshing going on.</li>
      <li>It feels really refreshing and light on the skin.</li>
      <li>Easy to apply, non-greasy.</li>
      <li>First, you get a nice tube of product</li>
      <li>The scent is very light and fresh.</li>
      <li>but I find it best to apply a few minutes before makeup application just for the smoothest result.</li>
      <li>I wake up, my face feels refreshed, and I rinse all this off in the shower with a mild cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The product was exactly what I was expecting!</li>
      <li>Coconut oil wasn&#x27;t enough for my skin and just left my skin incredibly icky-feeling and oily (of course.)</li>
      <li>Altogether, it does feel kind of moist, but definitely not sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I originally got a sample of this from a Holika Holika BB cream and fell in love, so now I finally bought it</li>
      <li>I love no other moisturizer/beauty product like this one.</li>
      <li>So, this is my favorite because it absorbs so quickly and actually works.</li>
      <li>This is my first sleeping pack</li>
      <li>and I will definitely be buying more.</li>
      <li>However it does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
      <li>My skin felt pretty hyhydrated.</li>
      <li>Shipped and received fast!</li>
      <li>The next day you can tell the difference, my face is more shiny and looks healthier.</li>
      <li>Try using it for three days in a row when u use it for the first time  </li>
      <li>you will notice a glow on your face but not after first use and then use it two to three times a week.</li>
      <li>My skin did feel soft and smooth in the am but still....</li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>tried this sleeping mask (Korean products like this are called pack instead of mask, I&#x27;m finding out) for the first time 3 weeks ago, and have been using it about 2-3 times per week since then.</li>
      <li>Highly, highly recommend!!</li>
      <li>I really like the watery texture and offers good hydration, skin fills refreshed next morning.</li>
      <li>I love this Water Cream it deep into my skin</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t live without this product!!</li>
      <li>I have very oily skin</li>
      <li>Won&#x27;t be much of an aid to a mature/dry/dull skin though.</li>
      <li>haha.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>considering I used a nickel sized amount for my whole face and neck.</li>
      <li>My skin is so smooth and supple after using this pack, especially after I exfoliate or do a sheet mask before putting this on.</li>
      <li>i applied this at night and the next morning my skin was clear and glowing; will buy again.  :)</li>
      <li>By the next morning it makes my face feel super moisturizing when I wake up</li>
      <li>Decent size for its price.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I bought this because it is oil free, but of course because of that it does hydrate as well as some other sleeping packs i have tried.</li>
      <li>I apply this last before going to bed and wake up to pretty skin.</li>
      <li>This smells terrific and I have seen a real improvement in the effectiveness of the nighttime products I was already using.  </li>
      <li>The mask leaves my face moisturized, soft, and silky.</li>
      <li>It feels very silky and healed up the dry cracked texture.</li>
      <li>I think it really helps with dry skin, and doesn&#x27;t seem to clog pores or make any oily areas worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It dried fairly quickly leaving a non sticky, non greasy gel film.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve bought many moisturizers in the past, such as ones by Simple</li>
      <li>It keeps your skin feel moisturized and soft the next day.</li>
      <li>Left my skin feeling extremely soft in the morning.</li>
      <li>and there&#x27;s no regrets.</li>
      <li>I let all the stuff dry a little and then apply about a pea-sized amount per cheek and forehead, and it dries to form a smooth surface in about 10 minutes.</li>
      <li>It seems to really seal in your other products for maximum absorption.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed that the dry patches have gone away within the first 2 uses (I used the sleeping pack back to back for 2 nights initially) and they haven&#x27;t come back</li>
      <li>I live in north Texas and constantly struggle with dry skin patches.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Shipped and received fast! Smells great and feels great on the skin. The next day you can tell the difference, my face is more shiny and looks healthier. This bottle last Forever also. There was no instructions on how often to use it. i just put this on every other day. In the morning I just rinse it alittle bit.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a  good product if you don&#x27;t mind using something that contains parabens in addition to Swiss Alpine extracts. Won&#x27;t be much of an aid to a mature/dry/dull skin though.</li>
    <li> It feels really refreshing and light on the skin. I just put enough to cover my face and go to sleep! By the next morning it makes my face feel super moisturizing when I wake up and that puts me in a good mood! haha. It has a great smell as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I&#x27;m done using this up, I&#x27;m definitely going to buy another one. Decent size for its price. I believe my package had arrived about two weeks earlier than the indicated date. and SAMPLES came with it! So yeah, I love the service as well. &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I had no idea before using this water mask how&lt;br /&gt;Good a water mask can be if u have never used one before do try this one you are not going to regret it. Try using it for three days in a row when u use it for the first time  you will notice a glow on your face but not after first use and then use it two to three times a week.</li>
    <li> I live in north Texas and constantly struggle with dry skin patches. At the same time, I don&#x27;t want to aggravate the oily areas of my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this sleeping mask (Korean products like this are called pack instead of mask, I&#x27;m finding out) for the first time 3 weeks ago, and have been using it about 2-3 times per week since then. I think it really helps with dry skin, and doesn&#x27;t seem to clog pores or make any oily areas worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed that the dry patches have gone away within the first 2 uses (I used the sleeping pack back to back for 2 nights initially) and they haven&#x27;t come back since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the mask as the last step in my nighttime multi-step Korean routine of oil cleanser, soapy cleanser, +/- exfoliant, toner, essence, ampoule and hyaluronic acid/vitamin C serum. Even with all the stuff already on my face, it seems to sit quite well. I let all the stuff dry a little and then apply about a pea-sized amount per cheek and forehead, and it dries to form a smooth surface in about 10 minutes. Altogether, it does feel kind of moist, but definitely not sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I wake up, my face feels refreshed, and I rinse all this off in the shower with a mild cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed that my makeup is sitting better on my face during the day, too, since using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m always concerned about getting unsightly acne, but this product didn&#x27;t do anything of the sort. I have tried &amp;#34;cold creams&amp;#34; in the past for a night treatment to intensely moisturize in this dry climate, and have historically broken out with acne on my chin/forehead. This sleeping mask, I think, is a great alternative as it doesn&#x27;t seem to clog pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing does happen to me when I&#x27;m using this product that I&#x27;m not a big fan of: when I&#x27;m sleeping, tiny hairs get stuck to my face. But this is in all actuality my own fault for letting them sleep in bed with me :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After this product runs out, Iplan to buy another tube, as there don&#x27;t seem to be very many sleeping packs to experiment with out there, except maybe Mizon.</li>
    <li> I have very oily skin and this lotion is slightly too oily. It has a very nice texture and fragrance though.</li>
    <li> Makes flaky skin a thing of the past, but it has parabens in it.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this mask. I use it nightly (after my usual skin care routine). It&#x27;s now a staple in my routine...I&#x27;ve even started buying 2 at a time so I don&#x27;t run out ;) And each morning I wake up to softer, mousturized skin! I&#x27;ve given this as gifts to many people now. Everyone loves it!! Highly, highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feel and look amazing the day after I use it. This is my first sleeping pack and I will definitely be buying more. Love it!!</li>
    <li> I use the mask 1-2 times a week. My skin is so smooth and supple after using this pack, especially after I exfoliate or do a sheet mask before putting this on. I&#x27;ll definitely be using this in the winter months when my skin is a little drier.</li>
    <li> I love no other moisturizer/beauty product like this one. I&#x27;ve bought many moisturizers in the past, such as ones by Simple or I&#x27;ve just settled for using plain coconut oil. Coconut oil wasn&#x27;t enough for my skin and just left my skin incredibly icky-feeling and oily (of course.) So, this is my favorite because it absorbs so quickly and actually works. I used to suffer from skin flakes, even when I used Simple moisturizer. I originally got a sample of this from a Holika Holika BB cream and fell in love, so now I finally bought it and there&#x27;s no regrets.Thanks!!&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I use it whenever but I find it best to apply a few minutes before makeup application just for the smoothest result.</li>
    <li> I love this Water Cream it deep into my skin i use it after i shave i cant believe how it deep into my skin i command it for every one</li>
    <li> It keeps the skin moisturized during the night. When I get up, my face felt smoother. Besides, like the small BB cream attached in the package.</li>
    <li> Does the job. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> It keeps your skin feel moisturized and soft the next day. I do recommend this product. Only thing is.. the portion was smaller then expected.</li>
    <li> This smells terrific and I have seen a real improvement in the effectiveness of the nighttime products I was already using.  I apply this last before going to bed and wake up to pretty skin.</li>
    <li> I bought this because it is oil free, but of course because of that it does hydrate as well as some other sleeping packs i have tried. it is good but is not heavy duty, probably best for the summer months.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t live without this product!! It&#x27;s so must-have for my night regimen.</li>
    <li> Left my skin feeling extremely soft in the morning. Most of the product seemed to rub/come off though during the night. Easy to apply, non-greasy.</li>
    <li> I have been using this at night and I love it!  When I wake up in the morning my skin looks great</li>
    <li> The product does what it says, but it&#x27;s no &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; product. It&#x27;s also not super moisturizing, but I did notice a difference in my complexion after using it. It seems to take away some of the redness.</li>
    <li> I have never used a sleeping pack before and didn&#x27;t know what to expect.  First, you get a nice tube of product considering I used a nickel sized amount for my whole face and neck. The scent is very light and fresh. It feels very cool and refreshing going on. It dried fairly quickly leaving a non sticky, non greasy gel film. Obviously it should only be used at night. My skin felt pretty hyhydrated. My hands are very dry and I tried it on them before bed as well. It feels very silky and healed up the dry cracked texture. It seems to really seal in your other products for maximum absorption.</li>
    <li> The product was exactly what I was expecting! My skin is improving since I started using this sleeping pack. Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> It took so long to get here (from Korea) I forgot about the order! However it does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do. Leaves a nice mask on your face for sleeping in not oily or greasy at all. It may be my skin type but I found after a few uses I started breaking out. As I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s imagine my surprise! My skin did feel soft and smooth in the am but still.... It came with some free samples which I liked but the mask itself I think I&#x27;ll try it once a month instead of weekly and see how that goes.</li>
    <li> i love this product.  i applied this at night and the next morning my skin was clear and glowing; will buy again.  :)</li>
    <li> I really like the watery texture and offers good hydration, skin fills refreshed next morning.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this sleeping mask. Although it is a bit pricey for the quantity, it is amazing. I have dry skin. The mask leaves my face moisturized, soft, and silky. Since it is expensive to use on a daily basis, this is my go to travel mask. It works wonders for the skin during air travel. I highly recommend it.</li>
