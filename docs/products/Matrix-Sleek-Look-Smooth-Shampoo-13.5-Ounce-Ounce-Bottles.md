      <li>i used, this one is by far the best.</li>
      <li>They keep my hair shiny, healthy and well behaved.</li>
      <li>love the way my hair feels...</li>
      <li>Then My husband and I fell in love with it.</li>
      <li>What more could you ask for?</li>
      <li>If you are using it with matrix conditioner than it will better results.</li>
      <li>It has made my hair a bit softer and more easier to manage.</li>
      <li>I also use the Matrix Smooth Look Conditioner.</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair smooth and non freeze.</li>
      <li>I bought what I could find via Amazon of the original line.</li>
      <li>To keep my hair soft and health, this product is really good and fast</li>
      <li>I have used this shampoo for over a decade and no matter how many times I switched to other shampoos I have always come back to my most favorite and trusted shampoo!</li>
      <li>It was all right.</li>
      <li>First time using this product and i am very satisfy.</li>
      <li>eventhough it served its job by shining her hair, but i guess those two reasons were strong enough never to use it anymore..</li>
      <li>Could really make the difference for someone who doesn&#x27;t dye their hair often or at all.</li>
      <li>and this really tames it.  </li>
      <li>I am using matrix since past 2 years, and i m really loving it.</li>
      <li>I opened the first bottle which was sealed, it was either old or rancid.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Because i have high lights</li>
      <li>But I can&#x27;t resist spending a little more on the Sleek shampoo and conditioner.</li>
      <li>and i see a big difference right away</li>
      <li>Definitely turns this curly girl&#x27;s hair straight!</li>
      <li>I live in a high humidity area, which generally makes my hair look like a brillo pad, even when I used creams and so-called frizz reducing products.  </li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t say it completely made it incredibly soft, though, I&#x27;ve been dying my hair for over 7 years.</li>
      <li>A young lady recommended the shampoo.</li>
      <li>it leaves my hair incredibly soft and shiny, i almost never have to use a conditioner with this.</li>
      <li>I like this shampoo so far - been using it about a month or two.  </li>
      <li>Sadly, this is a discontinued formula by Matrix that I loved.  </li>
      <li>My hair is damaged, using this product I noticed a difference from my  first use and recommend it to any one with dry or damaged hair.</li>
      <li>I have long, straight hair and have been using these products for years.</li>
      <li>I was hesitant to spend this much money on shampoo &amp; conditioner, but it&#x27;s worth it because now my hair is softer and much less frizzy without all those other creams, etc.</li>
      <li>first reason is it caused more dandruff on her skull which she hated so much.</li>
      <li>I have a dry scalp and dry long hair because of too much hair dye.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I am using matrix since past 2 years, and i m really loving it. I straightened my hairs and then my beautician recommend me to this. If you are using it with matrix conditioner than it will better results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m the frugal type, and don&#x27;t often splurge on brand or designer names. But I can&#x27;t resist spending a little more on the Sleek shampoo and conditioner. I have long, straight hair and have been using these products for years. They keep my hair shiny, healthy and well behaved. What more could you ask for?</li>
    <li> It was all right. It has made my hair a bit softer and more easier to manage. I won&#x27;t say it completely made it incredibly soft, though, I&#x27;ve been dying my hair for over 7 years. Could really make the difference for someone who doesn&#x27;t dye their hair often or at all.</li>
    <li> Definitely turns this curly girl&#x27;s hair straight!</li>
    <li> This is the second time that I purchased this shampoo from Amazon. The shampoo is excellent according to my wife who uses it and delivery and price had no competition.&lt;br /&gt;I definitively recomends the product.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product!! I get it and use it with wen and its the best combo ever!! I always recommend it too</li>
    <li> A few years ago I received this shampoo from a friend as a gift. Then My husband and I fell in love with it. My children have started to use this shampoo from last year since they don&#x27;t use kids&#x27; shampoo anymore. It smooths hair and helps it to be manageable. Since it has became expensive at stores, I buy it online.</li>
    <li> I have a dry scalp and dry long hair because of too much hair dye. I bought this shampoo and i see a big difference right away, reviews is one thing but you have to try it to see it for yourself.</li>
    <li> The Smooth Look Shampoo and Conditioner together work great to keep my hair from going nuts.  I live in a high humidity area, which generally makes my hair look like a brillo pad, even when I used creams and so-called frizz reducing products.

    <li> I have extremely curly hair and this really tames it.  I also use the Matrix Smooth Look Conditioner.</li>
    <li> Sadly, this is a discontinued formula by Matrix that I loved.  The product actually still exists but the formula and packaging as changed.  I bought what I could find via Amazon of the original line.</li>
    <li> I have used this shampoo for over a decade and no matter how many times I switched to other shampoos I have always come back to my most favorite and trusted shampoo! I have recommended to my friends who love it too!! Thank you Matrix!!! You need to stay forever!!</li>
    <li> A young lady recommended the shampoo. My hair is damaged, using this product I noticed a difference from my  first use and recommend it to any one with dry or damaged hair.</li>
    <li> My husband swears by this shampoo.</li>
    <li> To keep my hair soft and health, this product is really good and fast shipping.&lt;br /&gt;Because i have high lights my hair is damage and this shampoo helps a lot.</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo so far - been using it about a month or two.  It&#x27;s not miraculous, but a little goes a long way and my hair does feel healthier.  Smells great too.</li>
    <li> Bootleg bootleg bootleg.... Not even a single ingredient listed on the bottle. It looks like some just slapped a little sticker on there that says matrix...</li>
    <li> I purchased two bottles of this shampoo.  I did not open it to smell it until several weeks had passed as I had an open bottle in use.&lt;br /&gt;When I opened the first bottle which was sealed, it was either old or rancid. I will not buy this on line again.</li>
    <li> i use this shampoo every other day. it leaves my hair incredibly soft and shiny, i almost never have to use a conditioner with this.</li>
    <li> my wife ordered it, it came just in time. she used it twice, and throw it away. first reason is it caused more dandruff on her skull which she hated so much. second reason is it caused her hair loss! eventhough it served its job by shining her hair, but i guess those two reasons were strong enough never to use it anymore.. so disappointed about this product..</li>
    <li> First time using this product and i am very satisfy. Compare to other shampoo&#x27;s i used, this one is by far the best. It leaves my hair smooth and non freeze. I am sticking to this product love the way my hair feels...</li>
    <li> I think it is the Best, great stuff; used it for years.</li>
