<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product includes antioxidant white tea and vitamin E which left my skin feeling very soft and moisturized. I reccomend this product to anyone with sensitive skin as it is very gentle with my skin. I love the minty smell of this and how i have cleaned my face with this product for the past two weeks and it has not left my skin feeling dry. I tested Neutrogena Healthy Skin Boosters Daily Scrub for free, but all opinions are your own.</li>
    <li> My combination skin thanks you Neutrogena! They truly delivered on their promise to be oil-free without over drying your skin. A little amount really goes a long way and lathers well. The great smell was an added bonus! (I received a complimentary sample of the Healthy Skin Boosters Facial Cleanser via Infuenster to test and give my honest opinion.)</li>
    <li> After reading about Parabans, I&#x27;ve been on the lookout for them.  I did not see them in the description and trusted the name Neutrogena and the term Healthy when I ordered these. I was a little disappointed to find them in the ingredients on the bottle.  Which is a shame since I really liked the product otherwise.  The aroma was pleasant and not overly heavy.  It rinse off well and left a clean but somewhat taut feeling to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only other really issue I had to with the pump which is not working well on mine.  Perhaps I just got a bum pump.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of the Neutrogena Healthy Skin Boosters Facial Cleanser in my Influenster VoxBox to test, in return for my honest opinion of the product, and I was pleasantly surprised. I have sensitive skin and I&#x27;m always weary of products overdrying my skin, even when they state otherwise. But as soon as I started using this cleanser, I noticed that not only did my skin feel softer but it looked brighter. I even went out and ran errands the other day with no foundation on because my skin looked so good!</li>
    <li> This is a nice smooth facial cleanser. It goes on nice, lathers just the right amount, rinses clean and smells decent.  However, it does leave my skin feeling dry and tight.  If you have oily skin, this will work well for you.</li>
    <li> Love the product made my skin soft and best of all i didn&#x27;t get any side effect! Most times when I try facial products I get little rashes this products great loved it! Did get a free tester so I am stating my true opinion on it</li>
    <li> This is a nice gentle cleanser, with a fresh not-too-girly scent.  My face does feel a bit dry and tight after washing, but I always moisturize after cleansing anyway. My sensitive skin does not break out with this product.</li>
    <li> Very Good cleanser. great for sensitive skin and smells great. leaves your face feeling fresh and clean</li>
    <li> Healthy skin requires some maintenance, so I ordered this one to see how well it works. I find it to clean well, to leave no residue, and to not dry out the skin afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a lot of Neutrogena products, and they always seem to work well. This one is no exception. It is simple to use: just wet the skin, work up a lather, and apply to the face. It then rinses off well, leaving the skin clean and soft. It works so well there is really nothing else to say!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue I had was that on my particular bottle, the top was stuck. It took several minutes of twisting/pulling to get the pump handle up. Once it popped out, everything was fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary: A good daily cleanser - if you can get it out of the bottle! Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I really like this cleanser for in the morning. I feel its evening out my skin tone already after only a week of using it! It has a light scent which I like bc Im picky about stuff like that. I think the Vitamin E is what makes my skin feel so soft after using it! While I think it preps my skin awesome for make-up I find myself using less or going out foundation free bc I love the way my skin feels! I&#x27;ve tested Neutrogena Healthy Skin Boosters Daily Scrub for free, but all opinions are your own.</li>
    <li> I used this facial cleanser for two weeks after receiving it for free in order to test and review. The following opinions are completely my own. I think this cleanser smells absolutely amazing. It lathers nicely and can be successfully applied with your bare hands. I would be afraid of using a wash rag or anything exfoliating due to the fact that the cleanser dried out my skin. I have no doubt that it cleaned and refreshed my face because after every shower I felt like I had just had a face lift. However, within a day my skin became much more oily than usual and began to break out. I continued use to see if my face just needed an adjustment period however the results were the same. My theory is that it stripped my skin too much and my body had to overproduce it&#x27;s natural oils. I do think that this product is a good product but it&#x27;s just not good for me.</li>
    <li> This product has a nice light feel to it, and it gets nice and foamy when you wash your face. The foam is not creamy though, again it&#x27;s nice and light. Leaves skin feeling clean and smooth, though I did feel like I needed to use moisturizer almost before I was out of the shower. Overall though, I really like it. May very well become my &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34; cleanser from now on.</li>
    <li> I tried this Facial Cleanser and loved it. I thought it left my skin feeling really soft and fresh. SInce I love products that have vitamins, I was excited to try this since it has Vitamin e. I usually use it in the shower with warm water and have used it daily since I got it. It also has white tea which gives it a nice smell. I will definitely buy a full size.&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample size of this for free to try from Influenster and this is my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> My skin feels so much smoother thanks to the Neutrogena healthy skin boosters facial cleanser!&lt;br /&gt;I quickly saw results and I really like this product, I have some areas of my face where I tend to get oily than others but thanks to the white tea and vitamin e formula my skin is so soft and smooth and not so oily! I  tested Neutrogena Healthy Skin Boosters Daily Scrub for free, but all opinions are your own.</li>
    <li> I can honestly say that I love how this cleanser smells.  This cleanser makes my skin feel clean. I must say that it has good rejuvenating ingredients such as white tea and vitamin E.  I got this as a sample from influenster and honestly am glad to try this product out.  Not only does it clean my face thoroughly but it leaves it feeling rejuvenated.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this product in my influenster box, and I fell in love, I don&#x27;t only love how nice and smooth it made my face as well as how brightening it was for me, but the price is just in my budget to purchase this amazing product. I highly recommend this product. :)</li>
    <li> Bottom line is that this face wash cleanses my skin, bubbles and rinses nicely, without irritation or an increase in breakouts. I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve seen an improvement in my skin, but I switched from a more expensive cleanser that was performing well so I really wasn&#x27;t expecting an improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like the scent, since I&#x27;m a fan of white tea, but it&#x27;s on the strong side for me and I&#x27;m not sensitive. However, my husband has a sensitive nose and will sometimes comment on the smell of my face cream, and he hasn&#x27;t mentioned this, so at least it doesn&#x27;t linger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for something very natural or unscented, this isn&#x27;t for you. Otherwise I think it&#x27;s a good cleanser for general use.</li>
    <li> My wife got me hooked on Neutrogena products way back in the day so their products are in all of our bathrooms in some form or another. I have to be careful with certain products because they will give me a rash or make me break out but I have never had a problem with Neutrogena. And this product is no exception. Nice smell and very refreshing clean feeling after washing my face and ears. My wife also likes the product very much. Great now we are hooked on another bathroom product!  Lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely be buying in the future!</li>
    <li> I liked the smell of this product. I do recommend it because I saw the improvements on my skin fairly fast.</li>
    <li> I received a sample size of this product compliments of Influenster for testing purposes, and I really liked it. Will definitely be my next face wash purchase! It smells great and left my skin feeling soft and smooth immediately. Still had a bit of dry skin after washing, but not as bad after using other cleansers. I did notice that my complexion looked a bit better (not so dull and blotchy).</li>
    <li> Works very efficiently to clean skin well. It left a fresh and moisturized effect on my skin. It did not overdry my skin, which is a big plus.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: has vitamin E &amp; white tea Cons: has parabens.&lt;br /&gt;I received this as a free sample from Influester to review unbiasedly.</li>
    <li> I got to try Neutrogena Healthy Skin Boosters face wash for free with influenster to try and review. This is a great face wash! It really does a great job of scrubbing off the &amp;#34;day&amp;#34; and leaving your skin feeling hydrated afterwards.</li>
    <li> I got the chance to sample this cleanser free through influenster.com. This cleanser does a great job making my skin soft and smooth but I think it would be better for someone with normal to dry skin. I have extremely oily skin so it just ok for me. I also wish it didn&#x27;t have parabens.</li>
    <li> Just incorporated the ‪#‎HealthySkinBooster‬ facial cleanser by Neutrogena into my nighttime regimen today. I received this product complimentary in my ‪#‎FrescaVoxBox‬ from ‪#‎Influenster‬ for testing and review purposes. I have to say I am extremely picky when it comes to facial cleansers. I loved the light &amp;#34;airy&amp;#34; feel of the cleanser when it was first applied. My pickiest moments are usually once my face is fully dry. Thankfully, this cleanser left my face feeling very clean &amp; not overly dry. I definitely give this product a thumbs up — feeling refreshed.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cleanser for the past week and have noticed a good change in my skin. The blemishes I had are healing and no new ones are popping up.I think the vitamin e really helps to keep my skin moisturized while the cleanser does a good job of cleaning the skin. A little bit of the cleanser goes a long way.  I don&#x27;t mind the light scent of the cleanser, but am not a fan of the fact they use perfume and parabens in the product. if that&#x27;s not an issue for you, I would definitely recommend this product because it does have many good qualities.&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample size version of this product compliments of Influenster. All opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> Its really an awesome product. It softs and smoothens with out over drying the skin</li>
    <li> I love the scent it has to it but unfortunately it’s a no go for me. I washed my face before bed and used the product as directed and woke up with red spots all over my cheeks. I usually can use any product with no problems at all but something in this product just didn’t quite sit well with me. I would still recommend the product because it has so many great reviews. Sadly I won’t be purchasing this product in the future. I received this product for free for testing purposes and all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> While I can&#x27;t tell you how this product works long term, I found it very pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;The texture is surprisingly velvety and unlike anything else I have used.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is a little fruity, like mango, but not overpowering; nor, did it linger after I rinsed my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not find it drying, and I have sensitive skin. However, I use a moisturizer morning and evening.</li>
    <li> I love the neutrogena line, it is always good quality. After a bit of fuss, trying opening the top in the shower,  ( bad idea, open it before the shower!)&lt;br /&gt;I got a good squirt. wow a squirt does 1/2 the body with a loofah. After about four days my upper body and face felt, clean, exfoliated, and great.&lt;br /&gt;Once a week I use the  neutrogena body oil, top to bottom after a shower, the night before I change the sheets. The comb is working well to feed and preserve the most precious body organ--- skin.</li>
    <li> I love this! I was sent a sample of this face wash and right away I knew I had to buy the full size product, which I did! The smell is not over powering at all. It doesnt leave my face dry it makes it feel so clean and refreshed! It has helped my acne so much! I received a sample of this product from Influenster for testing purposes. All opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this product in my Walmart Beauty Box. Although I liked the pleasant smell, I did not feel that it worked wonders. My face felt more dry after using.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many cleansers and I have finally found a winner!! I received a free sample of this in the mail thanks to Influenster, and I loved it!! It has a great texture and isn&#x27;t harsh on my skin, but still manages to remove and make up or dry skin properly. My mother and sister also use it now and we all have different skin types! It has a nice clean scent to it without it being over powering. Leaves our skin feeling soft and smooth and feeling great!</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser.  I ordered this for my wife to try but I end up using it myself everyday.  I use it with Philips PureRadiance Multi-Speed Skin Cleansing System or just hand washing.  I have a oily skin but if i use pore cleanser my face always feels dry after especially in CA.  This cleanser on the other hand leaves a silky smooth feeling after even using it with Philips cleansing system.  One star off is because wife was slightly sensitive to this cleanser and that is how I end up using it myself.</li>
    <li> I have combination skin and over the past year I&#x27;ve noticed that it seems to have developed a sensitivity i never experienced before so i was initially concerned about trying a new cleanser but I&#x27;ve been using Neutrogena products for as long as I can remember so I felt confident that it wouldn&#x27;t irritate my skin I really love the scent of this product, it&#x27;s fresh and invigorating and it cleans my skin very well, no left over makeup residue. I also really like the pump, makes my morning and evening ritual a lot less hectic and the price is a bargain considering the quality. It even leaves my skin feeling hydrated and moisturized, a huge factor for me when choosing a cleanser. It has vitamin E and white tea but also parabens which is a small concern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a member of the Neutrogena Crew on Crowdtap and I received this product for free to review. The opinions expressed are 100% my own.</li>
    <li> I received this free to try from influencer love it smell works great</li>
    <li> I received a complimentary sample of this product from influenster (all opinions are my own). This product overall was great! My skin feels soft and fresh after every use. The one thing that really caught my eye (or should i say my nose) was the scent! Oh I just loved the way it smells.I use it about 2 times a week although you could use it everyday if you wanted to.</li>
    <li> This has a clean smell, cleans well and hasn&#x27;t caused any issues with my skin (no rashes or redness after use)</li>
    <li> Smells great and worked great!  No complaints at all!</li>
    <li> I use this on days I don&#x27;t use an exfoliate. This creamy when washing. Made with green tea extracts and vitamin E. Leaves your skin radiant. I love this! I give it five stars and a big thumbs up.</li>
    <li> The Neutrogena Healthy Skin Boosters Cleanser is exactly what my skin has always needed.  I have been using it every day for a couple of weeks and I quickly noticed a change in my skin.  With the weather being the way that it has been lately, I really needed a facial cleanser that wasn&#x27;t drying to my skin.  With this I haven&#x27;t even needed to apply any extra moisturizer at all and my face is still not dry.  My skin is soft and healthy looking.  I am not full of black heads either.  I didn&#x27;t expect that effect, but it does cleanse your pores well.  I have to use gentle cleanser and products for sensitive skin and i had no problem with irritation or negative effects at all from this.  I know that a lot of women my age swear by using moisturizers, but my 42 year old skin is loving this stuff without any back up products.  I would recommend this to anyone of any age.</li>
    <li> Getting the Neutrogena Healthy Skin Boosters facial cleanser pump to start working was tedious. Usually you turn a pump head in the direction that the arrow points; you spin the pump head a couple of time and its pops making the pump functional. Not so with this product; you spin and you spin and you spin for countless times before finally it pops. Neutrogena Healthy Skin Boosters facial cleanser is fragrant. You definitely smell the scent of white tea.  This product’s consistency is of a smooth gel. A full pump releases too much product for one application; so a half a pump is enough to effectively wash your face.  This cleanser removes all my make-up which is a definite plus. Unfortunately, it takes a lot of rinsing to remove all traces of this product off your skin. The cleanser is slightly drying to the skin; but, that is easily remedied once you apply your moisturizer. I have aging, sensitive, prone to breakouts, more oily than normal skin. This product did not irritate or cause any skin breakout. Even though I enjoyed testing and using this product, it is not something that I will purchase because I prefer more natural skin products,</li>
    <li> I received neutragena healthy skin boosters facial cleanser complimentary from influenster for testing purposes. All opinions are mine. I love the vitamin e that it contains it left my skin feeling super soft and refreshed. The scent is heavenly. I will definitely continue using this product.</li>
    <li> This cleanser leave your face feeling great after a long day. after washing my face with it, it leaves it feeling clean and super soft with its infused antioxidants white tea and vitamin E. It doesn&#x27;t dry your skin but cleans it just perfectly. Loving it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I test Nuetrogena Healthy skin booster cleanser for free but all opinions are mine.</li>
    <li> Face wash is one of my favorite items to purchase. I own about 7 and rotate through them. I was pleasantly surprised at how well it cleansed and my skin didn&#x27;t feel tight afterwards but I always use moisturizer immediately. The vitamin E helps keep skin soft and the white tea draws out impurities. I usually prefer an exfoliant or a face oil but I will purchase this item in the full size version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This leaves the skin smooth and does not over dry, but it doesn&#x27;t do anything special. If you&#x27;re looking for a regular old cleanser not necessarily with any other benefits than this is for you.</li>
    <li> I received this product complementary from influenster. I was hesitant to use the product because I have sensitive skin but I was out of my cleanser so I had to use this. I was suprised at how great it left my skin. I didn&#x27;t break out in a rash or anything. I think the ingredients had a lot to do with it(white tea and Vitamin E). No joke my skin was soft I have been using for a week now and my skin feels and looks great. As a drugstore product I will definitely buy.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I recieved a complimentary sample from influenster. Really glad i recieved this i use it 3 times a week It does not dry my face at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m usually lazy to wash my face in the mornings, especially if I had a rough night, but the smell of this face wash is incredible! Now this makes me enthusiastic about waking up early and washing my face like the neutrogena commercials that come out on t.v. 😁. It really gives your skin that boost of freshness and confidence. The smell makes you just want to leave it on for a long period of time, after all who doesn&#x27;t love the smell of white tea? The scrub not only leaves you smelling fresh, but it gives you Vitamin C. I absolutely adore it! Thanks to influenster for the free same, I will be purchasing the full size!</li>
    <li> OMG! Does this smell amazing! That was my first thought about this facial cleanser. After actually trying it out, I loved it even more. My face feels oh so clean and it didn&#x27;t dry my skin out. Neutrogena, you have created a successful item with this facial cleanser! I tested Neutrogena Healthy Skin Boosters Daily Scrub for free, and all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> As I&#x27;m sure with most guys, more times than not my face getting washed was a result of taking a shower and washing my hair or when I shaved, there was not much effort made outside of those times.  The Neutrogena cleanser actually makes me want to wash my face regularly, it feels a lot better than the things I typically used.  I am curious to see the long term results...ok..did I just say that...&amp;#60;gruffly clears throat&amp;#62;...</li>
    <li> Skin type: very sensitive and prone to occasional breakouts age: 50s  Comes in a nice-sized plastic bottle with pump application. Do not use very much of this product - you don&#x27;t need to. A dime sized or so should give you enough cleanser on your dampened face. Using too much cleanser is only wasting it! And that goes for any cleanser or beauty product.  I have weird skin. A product may seem to work and then wreak havoc on my face. It&#x27;s part of the reason I joined the Vine program - my cabinets were full of product I&#x27;d spent money on that I&#x27;d have to give away or throw away. So when I find something that works, I hang on to it! I first &amp;#34;judge&amp;#34; a product by scent, how much is offered for the money, how it feels when I apply it to my skin, and then how my skin feels afterward--lately, as well, I am more and more looking at how it is made and what goes into the product. As for long term use, only time can tell for some beauty products, but for cleansers, since they do not stay on the face long, I can tell how much I will like them after only a few days or so of use. What I look for in a cleanser is one that does not have any &amp;#34;grit&amp;#34; or other kinds of &amp;#34;scrubbing&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;exfoliating&amp;#34; actions to them since they make tiny microscopic tears in the skin - particularly as you age. I exfoliate with my Clarisonic Mia or a soft cloth a couple of times a week. This routine works well for my aging skin. Neutrogena Cleanser is gentle enough to use the exfoliation that Mia provides without irritating my face.  This Nuetrogena isn&#x27;t organic or made from &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; ingredients as some of the products I do now use, but I wanted to try it anyway since I trust the Nuetrogena name, and as I earlier wrote, facial cleansers do not stay on the face long enough for me to worry as much. I pump out about a dime sized amount of the cleanser and slightly rub it between my fingers and then apply to my dampened face. Sometimes I&#x27;ll use my Clarisonic Mia and others I&#x27;ll use only my fingertips to cleanse my face in cirucular motions.  The cleanser is soft and silky on my skin, and it has a very light but pleasant scent. I don&#x27;t like heavy perfumy scents, and especially in my cleansers I prefer a lighter fresh scent.  After cleansing, my face feels soft and silky. The price at under $8 here on Amazon is reasonable for the amount received. I&#x27;d consider purchasing this when the bottle is empty - but this bottle should last me quite some time.</li>
    <li> I’ve used many Neutrogena products over the years and liked some of them well enough to make them part of my regular skin care routine.  This product is a good, basic cleanser that won’t blow your budget. Since you only need a small amount of product to get the job done, this generous 9 oz. size should last a long time.  This produces a nice lather but rinses easily and doesn’t leave any irritating residue behind.  My skin is ‘Normal’, with a tendency to get a little oily in the t-zone.  This cleanser leaves my skin feeling clean and soft, not overly dry or tight feeling and I haven’t experienced any redness or irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that I don’t particularly care for is that this cleanser has a fruity fragrance.  It’s not unpleasant, but I’d prefer a fragrance free cleanser.  I think this will work well for most skin types, though those with very dry skin might prefer something more moisturizing.  And of course anyone sensitive to fragrance will want to skip this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Oil Free&lt;br /&gt;*NOT fragrance free</li>
    <li> I am normally a fan of most Neutrogena products.  This facial cleanser is easily accessible in the pump form, it does wash your face without any drying out of the skin. I have found that it does work to leave moisture in and not dry out and this is a huge plus for me when using these types of products.  It was surprising that the scent of this product is not agreeable. Neutrogena normally has products with a light barely discernible scent or no scent at all. This one has a slightly fruitty, watermelon scent that I do not like at all. I am not a fan of anything watermelon so it automatically makes something distasteful to me; the smell of the cleanser was the only drawback for me. Other than that the product does what it says it will, cleans your face without drying it out.  If you can get past the smell I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I chose this thinking I was going to be the one to use this, but my 19 year old daughter loves this stuff.  It smells wonderful, refreshing, and not chemically at all, and it cleanses without drying.  She has very sensitive skin that has been prone to acne, and she has tried many different cleansers over the last 6 years.  Always looking for a balance, she has tried to Neutrogena products a few times, and they are usually good.  But this stuff, with its divine fragrance as well, is her favorite.  She uses this in the shower, on her face and chest and upper back as well.  It leaves her skin feeling very soft, but not oily, and has caused no break outs so far.  I would recommend this product to anyone, male or female, teenage and up.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s so I&#x27;m always looking for anything that will help my skin. After three weeks of using Neutrogena&#x27;s Healthy Skin Booster Cleanser, morning and night, I didn&#x27;t see any improvement. My face felt more oily and I even had a bit of acne break-out. I didn&#x27;t have that same clean feeling that I get with my normal daily cleanser Cetaphil. On the other hand, using this instead of soap in the shower left my skin feeling quite nice. It has a nice smell, not too perfume - a big plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neutrogena advertises this as having White Tea and Vitamin E, but there wasn&#x27;t any listing of ingredients so it&#x27;s impossible to know how much is in the product. Neutrogena on the whole makes really good skin care products, so this is probably no exception. You may have to just try it to see if it&#x27;s good for your skin.</li>
    <li> Great product provides a nice clean feeling. I use this in the shower each morning and it leaves me feeling refreshed. Unlike some non-acne face washes it doesn&#x27;t leave me dried out or increase my breakouts.</li>
    <li> The scent is a bit strong, but I am sensitive to perfumes and scents in general.  It lathers nicely and removes eye makeup using a double wash, which is what my asthetician friend told me to always do. She recommends washing first to remove most of your make up, rinse then wash again to remove the residual.  This product leaves my skin feeling clean but soft, not stripped dry.  The price is good, too, compared to the $30 cleanser I&#x27;ve been using!</li>
    <li> It can be hard to find a cleanser that doesn&#x27;t dry out your face. The Neutrogena Healthy Skin Boosters Cleanser is gentle. It glides on smoothly and easily. A single pump is enough product for a face wash. This cleanser smells fresh and clean too. I thought it made my skin feel nice and soft afterward. It did not cause me to breakout and soothed some of the redness that I typically have. This product is gentle enough to use twice  a day.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice facial cleanser.  I have been using it for almost 2 weeks now, and it leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean, but without that tightness that other cleansers can leave.  I like the smell, it&#x27;s refreshing, but not overpowering and it doesn&#x27;t hang around too long.  A couple of pumps in my hand are enough to wash my face and my neck.  I haven&#x27;t had any kind of allergic reaction to it, but your mileage may vary.</li>
    <li> This is a nice cleanser - doesn&#x27;t smell much (I hate overly scented products) and really cuts through the grease. Actually a little bit TOO much for my skin, so this might not be a great choice for you if your skin is easily dried out. I tried creamier cleansers but wasn&#x27;t happy with how they felt - almost like you couldn&#x27;t really tell if they were doing anything. This lathers up a little bit, but not too much so you don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s stripping every single thing out of your skin. Definitely leaves my skin feeling very clean and requires moisturizer after using.</li>
    <li> To those haranguing about parabens (which have NEVER been linked to cancer)....One is far more likely to die TAKING a single shower than the cumulative effect of thousands of showers with a product like this one. By their &#x27;safe than sorry&#x27; logic we should all be dirty and smell like bad fish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If one judges it as a cleanser, this is a good one.  Like all Neutrogena products, fresh, no soapy film but not &#x27;cosmetic&#x27;.</li>
    <li> Works good, cleans well, but to me, it had very strange chemically type of smell when you are washing. It isn&#x27;t overpowering or anything, just strange.  My wife really liked it, and she didn&#x27;t complain of any smells.  So there you go. Otherwise, it rinses clean and seems very mild. All in all it seems good, but be wary of you are really sensitive to smells.  Go into it with the &amp;#34;trial&amp;#34; mentality.</li>
    <li> I have been using a cleanser with which I am fairly satisfied ([[ASIN:B00E4MOSS0 Basis Cleaner Clean Face Wash]].  However, the extremely harsh, cold temperatures this winter have left my normally oily skin feeling a bit drier than usual.  I thought that this Neutrogena cleanser, which has Vitamin E and claims \\&quot;won&#x27;t over dry skin,\\&quot; might be beneficial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, my initial experience with this product was one of frustration.  The pump mechanism--the type that typically screws to unlock--would NOT release, no matter what I tried.  I have NEVER had this problem with any pump-style product before (although note that at least one other reviewer had the exact same problem with THIS product). This rendered the product as packaged totally unusable.  Therefore, in order to access this cleanser, I needed to decant it into a separate container of my own--annoying, to say the least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I was able to try the product.  I was expecting a subtle white tea scent, but instead, this cleanser has a fairly heady, flowery fragrance.  Luckily, it dissipated quickly.  The cleanser itself formed into a thick, creamy lather--it actually felt more like a cream cleanser than a gel.  However, it cleaned well, including removing makeup, and it has seemed to wash away clear.  Furthermore, after several weeks of use, it has not produced any breakouts (an occasional issue I experience with some products).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I might be inclined to re-purchase this cleanser for winter use (I fear that it would be too rich for my skin in the summer) were it not for the poor pump design.  I simply would not take a risk of the pump not working with each purchase, and for that reason alone, I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I will start with disclosure that I have been using Neutrogena projects for a long time.  My have combination oily skin and on occasions I have acne breakout.  Neutrogena offered one of the best over the counter solutions for my type of the skin.  So I used their soap and cleansers regularly.  To this day I absolutely adore Neutrogena&#x27;s body lotion that is made out of sesame seed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Healthy Skin Boosters is new line of products.  This particular cleanser comes loaded with white tea and vitamin E.  White tea gives it lovely fragrance and vitamin E is valuable nutrient for the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to disclose that I am also esthetician.  So what got me a little concerned about the product is that it contains paraben.  Paraben is typically used as preservative in cosmetic products.  It is inexpensive and many companies use it.  However, I stay away form parabens and I advise my clients to do the same.  The concern is that the estrogen-mimicking aspect of parabens may be a factor in the increasing prevalence of early puberty in girls and in general I am against any products that interfere with body&#x27;s natural production of hormons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is nice product and it comes in a generous size.  But unfortunately, it will not be a part of my regular beauty routine.  It is replaced by products that use natural ingredients and preservatives.</li>
