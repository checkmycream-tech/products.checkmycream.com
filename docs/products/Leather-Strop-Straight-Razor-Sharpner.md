      <li>IT&#x27;S JUST THE RIGHT SIZE FOR HIS NEEDS.</li>

      <li>It reminded him of the past, great memories</li>

      <li>The strap is exactly as described.</li>
      <li>Works as good as much more expensive strops.</li>
      <li>quality product at a reasonable price.  </li>
      <li>speedy fast service.</li>
      <li>To me this leather strop straight razor sharpner doesn&#x27;t sharpen as well as it should.</li>
      <li>absolutely.</li>
      <li>all expectations were met- thanks</li>

      <li>I ordered this strop to complement my fromm straight razor.</li>
      <li>I ORDERED THIS FOR MY SON WHO IS IN THE ARMY AND HAS LEARNED HOW TO SHAVE WITH A STRAIGHT RAZOR.</li>
      <li>Price was reasonable.</li>
      <li>Ruined the edge of me straight razor.</li>
      <li>Junk for a straight razor.</li>
      <li>He is very please the the quality of the product.</li>
      <li>i decided to try straight razor shaving.  </li>
      <li>should have spent the money on a more quality strop</li>
      <li>I purchased this under the assumption that it was brand new and was very much mistaken.</li>
      <li>Too small for most things to be useful</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t really have an opinion on this item since i&#x27;m a first time user, but so far i&#x27;ve had no problems</li>
      <li>but no more effective than this product and</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend seller.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>Sure you could use an old belt but this has a clip and is a bit wider than the average belt.</li>
      <li>Gets a fairly cheap knife shaving sharp.</li>
      <li>Made a 70+ year old razor feel like new.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a real workout to get my razor polished enough for shaving.</li>
      <li>Works good and does the job just as any of the expensive ones, but at a fraction of the price.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t say much about it in comparison to others that cost magnitudes more since this is the 1st strop I have owned (and would likely mess it up), but it has stood up to some substantial use and mistakes without breaking down.</li>
      <li>Way too thin for a full straight razor blade</li>
      <li>a little shorter than I expected, good quality, but be careful not to run your razor to far up or down, otherwise you will potentially be stropping the grip, and or the metal part.</li>

<li> Given the feel and durability thus far, I would expect this strop to sell for $20-30 range, but it has done the job well enough that I will probably give a few of these as gifts.</li>

<li> Absolutely no buyer&#x27;s remorse with this</li>
<li> In my humble opinion definitely money well spent!  </li>
<li> The only down side is that I wish it was a little longer</li>
<li> I would recommend this to anyone who wants to get their blade scary sharp.</li>
<li> I applied green compound to the rough side of the leather.</li>
<li> Nothing gets it RAZOR SHARP like a Strop!</li>
<li> It was delivered in less than a week</li>
<li> Not very pleased will not purchase from this site/person again.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> should have spent the money on a more quality strop</li>
    <li> Big? no....well made? yes.....effective?.....absolutely. I am a craftsman by trade....and in the leather business too boot. This is a very nice, well made, effective product. I was impressed to the positive. I&#x27;ve seen other strops that were larger, with different appointments, different colored leather handles, embossed logos and such....yes, they (to others were very nice) but no more effective than this product and no more well made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: A very nicely made, effective, attractive, if &#x27;compact&#x27;, product. perfect for daily use while a very accommodating size for travel.  In my humble opinion definitely money well spent!  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Simply put, I am surprisingly pleased with this strop. Can&#x27;t say much about it in comparison to others that cost magnitudes more since this is the 1st strop I have owned (and would likely mess it up), but it has stood up to some substantial use and mistakes without breaking down. Absolutely no buyer&#x27;s remorse with this and it has been the weekly go-to for weekly maintenance of my Cold Steel Ti-Lite and various kitchen knives. Given the feel and durability thus far, I would expect this strop to sell for $20-30 range, but it has done the job well enough that I will probably give a few of these as gifts.</li>
    <li> Its cheap and has an unusable Finnish not to mention it is tiny. Do not throw your money away. Canvas strap useless as well.</li>
    <li> I ordered this strop to complement my fromm straight razor. It arrived more then three days before it was supposed to be SENT OUT!!! The strop is awesome, I was also given a better strop as a gift!</li>
    <li> Was warned that it was a little small. Still bought it and tried it out. It worked, or should i say i made our work. Way too thin for a full straight razor blade</li>
    <li> exactly what i wanted</li>
    <li> Received in condition as listed. Price was reasonable. Shipment was fast! I enjoyed this sale!</li>
    <li> i really like this but only problem is its a little shorter in width than i expected but i should&#x27;ve read more. its a great product, it does what its supposed to and does a great job at it.</li>
    <li> I had purchased this for my husband an d he loved it.  It reminded him of the past, great memories</li>
    <li> a little shorter than I expected, good quality, but be careful not to run your razor to far up or down, otherwise you will potentially be stropping the grip, and or the metal part.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive way to sharpen a knife or a razor! Nothing gets it RAZOR SHARP like a Strop! Final step in sharpening.</li>
    <li> I use mine on a very large pocket knife. I applied green compound to the rough side of the leather. I start with the green side and then do a few passes on the smooth side. Gets a fairly cheap knife shaving sharp. I think the quality is excellent for the price. Sure you could use an old belt but this has a clip and is a bit wider than the average belt. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to get their blade scary sharp.</li>
    <li> i decided to try straight razor shaving.  so of course i need this for sharpening.  i have yet to start.  but i look forward to a fun learning experience</li>
    <li> Too small. Very good service from the supplier.</li>
    <li> This is a really nice strop. Works as good as much more expensive strops. The only down side is that I wish it was a little longer</li>
    <li> works like a charm smaller then i expected though</li>
    <li> Can be used, but almost has no area to work with. It&#x27;s a real workout to get my razor polished enough for shaving.</li>
    <li> very good product, reasonably priced! great!</li>
    <li> fast shipper nice product</li>
    <li> Nice strop for the price.  It is doing the job.</li>
    <li> Very nice strop, used it with my grandfathers razor and it worked great. Made a 70+ year old razor feel like new.</li>
    <li> The strap is exactly as described. He is very please the the quality of the product. speedy fast service. Would highly recommend seller.</li>
    <li> this is a quality product- shipping was quick- all expectations were met- thanks</li>
    <li> Not happy with strop. Leather was knicked and scuffed. Metal ring all messed up like someone took a hammer to it. Not very pleased will not purchase from this site/person again. Would like a 3\\&quot; replacement</li>
    <li> The only reason I am giving this product 2 stars is because it arrived before scheduled. I purchased this under the assumption that it was brand new and was very much mistaken. The leather was worn and scuffed and the metal loop hanger was flaking off and rusting underneath. Absolutely disgusting. Returning tomorrow.</li>
    <li> This strap is a good strap for the money. Although this strap is not very long or wide. I would love to have a wider and longer one but this strap has served it&#x27;s purpose. And with the canvious strop I was able to give my straight razors a rough strop to take care of the rough edge and Then turning to the leather strop and giving it a perfect blade edge. It is a great strop overall.</li>
    <li> Too small for most things to be useful</li>
    <li> leather strop, excellent for the finishing edge on my knives and razors.  A bit of polishing compound, jewelers rouge and it becomes an excellent polishing hone for the edge.</li>
    <li> i like it allot its what I was looking for to go with my razor I love it very much thank you!!</li>
    <li> This strop is just the right size for truing your razor, hangs easily via the attached clip, and is affordably priced. Plus, shipping was super-fast. Love it!</li>
    <li> I ordered this as a Valentines Day gift for my boyfriend. It was delivered in less than a week and I was so excited to see it when it arrived! My boyfriends eyes lit up and he was very happy with it! Thank you so much!!!!</li>
    <li> much smaller than anticipated</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really have an opinion on this item since i&#x27;m a first time user, but so far i&#x27;ve had no problems</li>
    <li> quality product at a reasonable price.  Delivery was punctual.  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> Junk for a straight razor. I&#x27;ll use it for my knifes. I should have known with the cheap price. Its bumpy poor material  . Came with a chunk taken out.  Ruined the edge of me straight razor.</li>
    <li> Such an awesome and easy to use tool. Thank you so much my son loved it.</li>
    <li> My strop arrived on time and was just as described. Works good and does the job just as any of the expensive ones, but at a fraction of the price. Good strop and a very good price.</li>
    <li> Just the strap I was hoping to find, for polishing my knives after sharpening on a stone.  As a youth, I learned stone sharpening from a shop teacher (wood carving class).  He insisted on leather strap usage and taught how to embed the leather with jeweler&#x27;s rough.  Sharpening your own knives is a very satisfying skill.  Check out all the great videos available for free on the internet and have fun, make it an adventure, use patients and you&#x27;ll do yourself fine....</li>
    <li> I ORDERED THIS FOR MY SON WHO IS IN THE ARMY AND HAS LEARNED HOW TO SHAVE WITH A STRAIGHT RAZOR. THIS STROP DOES THE JOB TO A &amp;#34;T&amp;#34;. HE IS VERY WELL PLEASED WITH IT. IT&#x27;S JUST THE RIGHT SIZE FOR HIS NEEDS.</li>
    <li> This product came as advertised. It is good enough for the purpose that it was bought for.&lt;br /&gt;I like the small size and the small price. It comes with two straps, a canvas one and a leather one.&lt;br /&gt;The clip is light weight but can be reinforced if desired.</li>
    <li> I liked this item because it is made of a very good leather.It came well Packaged,and was delivered on time. I would recommend to any one that needs to sharpen a knife... Jim</li>
    <li> This is a great strop it sharpens my straight razor quickly. I&#x27;m not A fan of how sharpening my razor leaves lines in the leather though. But it is a great product.</li>
    <li> great strop, coarse and fine sides but smaller than expect, great for what you pay, really brings out that hair shaving edge</li>
    <li> To me this leather strop straight razor sharpner doesn&#x27;t sharpen as well as it should. I could be wrong because I personally don&#x27;t know how to use one exactly this is for my husband and he seems to be happy with it.</li>
