      <li>All statements are my own.</li>
      <li>The process is very easy once you mold and customize your trays.</li>
      <li>I have professional whitening trays so this has worked out great for me!</li>

      <li>Effective and easy to use.</li>
      <li>Great product fast shipping</li>

      <li>Then I was able to apply again w/o pain.</li>
      <li>The teeth form was tricky, but after several attempts, I got them the best I could where the whitening agent would touch my teeth.</li>
      <li>I am glad to find this on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love it jist</li>
      <li>This product does NOT contain the light!</li>
      <li>The whitening solution works well, and my teeth are looking better with every use.</li>
      <li>Product was ok</li>
      <li>but i found an awesome video to help anyone understand how to properly use this product!!</li>
      <li>Fitting the trays took about 10 minutes and you end up with a nice custom fit.  </li>
      <li>I have enjoyed using this kit</li>
      <li>I love my teeth now.</li>
      <li>My stains are not noticeably any more.  </li>
      <li>This is a pretty good whitening treatment.</li>
      <li>But as long as you stick to it it will work perfectly</li>
      <li>Helps to better regulate amount/placement and easily remove excess before u hurt yourself</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s important that you take your time fitting the trays.</li>
      <li>Great price, super fast Amazon shipping</li>
      <li>Easy to pick up</li>
      <li>Too strong.</li>
      <li>First kit I purchased had really nice molds with preset teeth</li>
      <li>The light that came with the whitener is really easy to use and can be placed in your mouth so you can multitask while whitening.</li>
      <li>You get the most bang for your buck with this product, so I&#x27;m not upset at all over having to get a better tray; it will still be cheaper then most other whiteners and definitely more effective.</li>
      <li>Oh and I did use the light that it comes with for two of the three sessions.</li>
      <li>The product worked in every way it claimed to, and the price is fantastic.</li>
      <li>I specifically wanted a UV light (whether it helps or not, I still wanted it) and this kit included it along with three syringes of the whitening gel.  </li>
      <li>It seems like an important part of the system.</li>
      <li>The light is pictured and even listed in the instructions.</li>
      <li>Worked great for me, I noticed a big difference after about 4 uses and no sensitivity!</li>
      <li>I also have no idea what to do with the light as there aren&#x27;t any instructions for it.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the price!</li>
      <li>Multiple uses in kit and great for first time whitening or maintenance whitening.</li>
      <li>Seems like a good product especially for the price.  </li>
      <li>Good product, i will buy again in the future.</li>
      <li>This is a pretty strong gel, so don&#x27;t get it on your gums.</li>
      <li>I decided to try this one because it had so many positive reviews and the price was right.  </li>
      <li>I warmed and formed the trays a few times, and they are now a great fit for my teeth.</li>
      <li>I received the product in the mail today - fairly quick shipping.</li>
      <li>Since it was my very first time trying any whitening gel</li>
      <li>My only somewhat complaint is that the trays are not the greatest, but the whitener is amazing.</li>
      <li>I put the peroxide on my teeth first and then dapple some around the mouth tray and let sit for about 30 minutes while putting the LED light inside my mouth simultaneously.</li>
      <li>I am trying it for the first time today, and the light has already stopped working.</li>
      <li>I used some hot water to fit the trays on my mouth.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d say it is more effective than the paint on gel but less convenient than the strips.</li>
      <li>The gel is powerful, but burned my gums.  </li>
      <li>Yes it does take about 60 minutes but worth it if you want whiter teeth.  </li>
      <li>I got this product for an honest review based on my personal opinion.</li>
      <li>When I received the whitener system in the mail about a week ago, I put it to the test right away.</li>
      <li>I right away put the gel bleach solution in both trays and put them on my teeth for around 40 mintues.</li>
      <li>The cool thing is that the kit actually came with three trays (I jacked one of them up so the third one came in very handy).</li>
      <li>I used very little gel as instructed and results are great.</li>
      <li>Think I need to purchase new battery&#x27;s the light won&#x27;t come on.</li>
      <li>Really whitens quick in 30 min intervals but burns gums easily and makes teeth pretty sensitive the day after</li>
      <li>I left it on the top for the 1st time for TWO hours..big mistake.  </li>
      <li>I was also worried that since there was no way to tell if I’d properly applied the gel, I couldn&#x27;t be sure my teeth would be any whiter after an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well.</li>
      <li>Trimming it alittle before  warming up in hot water helped.  </li>
      <li>I love the product and will continue to use it to keep my teeth pearly white.</li>
      <li>No sensitivity to the gums after first use.  </li>
      <li>If you are able to read and follow simple directions, using this should not be a problem.</li>
      <li>This kit has done more whitening on my teeth in 3 days then Crest white strips have done in a month.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> awesome stuff! works great and the product will last you a long time, since you only use a little bit. Definitely worth the price! I&#x27;d recommend getting the blue gel that goes on your teeth afterwards, because I normally get really sensitive after whitening, but not with that stuff.</li>
    <li> I suggest applying Vaseline/Petroleum Jelly around the gumline before use to alleviate any pain from the peroxide application. I&#x27;ve used the stuff three times and I assure you my teeth coloration has whitened a few shades.  Initially I had problems with the LED light like others but played around with the battery inside and problem fixed.  I put the peroxide on my teeth first and then dapple some around the mouth tray and let sit for about 30 minutes while putting the LED light inside my mouth simultaneously. Do the same process for the bottom row of teeth as well.  Uncomfortable to apply the trays on the top and bottom at the same time.  Yes it does take about 60 minutes but worth it if you want whiter teeth.  Lastly, have a cup nearby because you will have the need to spit a few times.  If you smoke and drink coffee like I do then you need this product even after getting your teeth cleaned every six months.</li>
    <li> its a good item but the taste is really bad.</li>
    <li> Worked great for me, I noticed a big difference after about 4 uses and no sensitivity! The only thing I had trouble with were the trays but overall it worked great.</li>
    <li> To much hassle and it made my gum hurt so bad. I three them away.</li>
    <li> This is a horrible product. I am trying it for the first time today, and the light has already stopped working. So that&#x27;s great.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t even know how to go about getting my money back because I took so long to try it out. Worst mistake.</li>
    <li> The trays were impossible to cut perfectly. The whitener didn&#x27;t make my teeth sensitive. I think whiter strips work just as well.</li>
    <li> Whatever reservations you have about trying this whitening kit, get over it and give it a shot. It was a little rough starting out. The directions didn&#x27;t seem to tell me much, I was a little inept at forming the trays to my teeth, and getting the gel into the trays isn&#x27;t a neat and tidy process. I wanted a perfect line of gel along the front edge and that just wasn&#x27;t happening. After stumbling through the process and pushing the goo filled trays into my mouth, I waited that first hour with the light in my mouth, wondering the whole time why I was going to so much trouble when I could just go sit in a chair and have someone else do the work. I was also worried that since there was no way to tell if I’d properly applied the gel, I couldn&#x27;t be sure my teeth would be any whiter after an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well. If worrying was a sport, I’d be in the Olympics, and I’d get the gold every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After one application, my teeth were whiter. Just a little, but it was noticeable. I’ve used the kit 4 times now, and the results are amazing. I tried Zoom whitening years ago with good results. This was just as good if not better, and for way less money. I’m really surprised that after 4 uses my teeth are this white. They look great.</li>
    <li> Yup..it works. Been using forever. First kit I purchased had really nice molds with preset teeth so you didn&#x27;t have to form it so much. I toss the new ones and just keep sterilizing my first set. If you have sensitive teeth, which I do, I just coat what I need and let it spread on it&#x27;s own. Addicted!</li>
    <li> Came with everything listed, including the blue light.  Have used the project over 6 times now and have seen 0 improvement in the whiteness of my teeth using the included tooth color guide.  Was hoping to have whiter teeth by my wedding, looks like that isn&#x27;t going to be happening.  Disappointed with the product.</li>
    <li> Think I need to purchase new battery&#x27;s the light won&#x27;t come on.</li>
    <li> I have always been drinking a lot of coffee and lately I started noticing staining. I looked for an over the counter teeth whitening producbut they were either too weak to get my stains off OR they would cost me a lot of money, especially what my dentist wanted to charge...I am glad to find this on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This kit is one of the real finds on amazon. It simply worked. And I had no sensitivity. I can say that I am very happy. And I highly recommend this kit.</li>
    <li> So far I got only 3 sessions so far but seems to be making a huge difference. I decided to continue to use the kit and I definitely will recommend it to my friends. Simple to use and very inexpensive.</li>
    <li> I have professional whitening trays so this has worked out great for me!</li>
    <li> When I received the whitener system in the mail about a week ago, I put it to the test right away. I had some stains that toothpaste couldn&#x27;t tackle. I used some hot water to fit the trays on my mouth. The whitening gel comes in syringes, so I used the whitening gel with the syringe. Since it was my very first time trying any whitening gel I only left it on for 3 minutes. I did not have any sensitivity or discomfort, so I did another treatment 2 days later. This time I used the gel for 5 minutes, after I cleaned the gel off my teeth I could already see a lot of whitening happening. My stains are not noticeably any more.  My teeth are whiter and I did not have any sensitivity. I can recommend this product for anybody looking for a teeth whitener system. I love my teeth now.</li>
    <li> I have enjoyed using this kit and I have noticed a big difference with my teeth color. I really needed teeth whitening as I am a smoker and soda drinker. I have tested this product for about a weeks now and I have seen a difference of about 3-4 shades whiter. Most importantly, the bad stains are gone. They send you a good amount of teeth whitening products with nice packaging. This is a pretty strong gel, so don&#x27;t get it on your gums. I got this product for an honest review based on my personal opinion. All statements are my own.</li>
    <li> I was excited to try this whitening formula, but when my package arrived one of the syringes of solution arrived broken. I contacted the company and was immediately sent a replacement set (not just one syringe) and some samples. The whitening solution works well, and my teeth are looking better with every use.</li>
    <li> I will order again. This product really wot</li>
    <li> Works so well had compliments from people noticeable withing a week. I love it jist wish it lasted longer. But as long as you stick to it it will work perfectly</li>
    <li> I have ordered other brands of teeth whitening but this one seems to be the best.  Noticed a difference after only 1 application.</li>
    <li> Very painful and no results. Used 9 times. Destroyed my gums. Waste of money. Too strong.</li>
    <li> Edited to add: I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month now and I&#x27;m still in love!   I&#x27;m impressed with it. This is not a paid review, I didn&#x27;t receive this product for a review, and I bought this after looking at several kits on Amazon and seeing almost all of the others in this price range have reviews that received the product in exchange for a review. I specifically wanted a UV light (whether it helps or not, I still wanted it) and this kit included it along with three syringes of the whitening gel.  I&#x27;ve been using it for roughly a week (5-6 days) and already see a difference. You do have to be careful- if it gets on your gums it WILL burn and your guns will turn white for a little bit and then return to normal lol. The trays molded well, I&#x27;ve used this everyday this week and have used less than half a syringe. I have been brushing my teeth with crest 3D white Brilliance toothpaste along with this whitening kit. For the price, I would recommend this. You may see some improvement after the first or second use but stick with it to really see results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed, I bought this kit and was excited for the results. However I have not noticed any results with my teeth. I have used this product 6 times and no change in the color of my teeth. Now the bright side, I haven&#x27;t experienced any sensitivity.</li>
    <li> This works great but the gel tastes horrible!</li>
    <li> Excellant product and fast shipping</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!! U cant beat the price and I could see results after 2 or 3 uses and you only have to use a small amount of gel so it will last a long time.</li>
    <li> I have used all kinds of teeth whiteners, the strips, gels, the lights you take with you in a tanning bed, this has whitened my teeth two shades in two uses! It left my teeth a little sensitive after use, i suggest you use before bedtime and do not eat or drink anything after use.</li>
    <li> Great product. Easy to use with instant results.</li>
    <li> Burns and doesn&#x27;t work. Gross.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only  used the system a few times and have noticed a difference in the whiteness of my teeth.</li>
    <li> This product worked great for me. After just 2 uses I noticed a difference in the whiteness of my teeth.  I have never tried any kind of teeth whitening product, so I researched a lot of different options and read a lot of different reviews.  I decided to try this one because it had so many positive reviews and the price was right.  I would definitely use this again.</li>
    <li> Molds do not form well. Tried several times and it didn&#x27;t work. The formula itself works well as I just trimmed the trays and used them as is. The first application was good as I had lined my gums with tissue before I put the trays in, but the second application was terrible as I tried to remold the trays and one of them shrunk, and formula got onto my gums even with the good tray</li>
    <li> I received the product in the mail today - fairly quick shipping. In the insturctions it tells you to mold the mouth pieces by putting them in boiling water; which wasn&#x27;t a big problem. I right away put the gel bleach solution in both trays and put them on my teeth for around 40 mintues. After 40 minutes - I have deifnitely seen a change in color. They look more whiter. I like this product and would suggest whoever needs whitening to try this product...</li>
    <li> This is great! The cool thing is that the kit actually came with three trays (I jacked one of them up so the third one came in very handy). The whitening gel works very well. I whitened for only 3-5 minutes each session for only three sessions and I noticed a huge improvement. Oh and I did use the light that it comes with for two of the three sessions.</li>
    <li> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;OyYhv_qVjOk&lt;br /&gt; I will receive my product tomorrow but i found an awesome video to help anyone understand how to properly use this product!!</li>
    <li> Product was ok but I guess this is why it is so inexpensive. They molding tray was thick and difficult to mold.</li>
    <li> The product worked in every way it claimed to, and the price is fantastic. My teeth whitened 1 shade after just one 30 minute session! The teeth form was tricky, but after several attempts, I got them the best I could where the whitening agent would touch my teeth. The only complaint I have: the light it came with worked for not even 5 minutes before it died. I switched the batteries around as others suggested, but it was a no go. That isn&#x27;t a deal breaker, though. I love the product and will continue to use it to keep my teeth pearly white.</li>
    <li> This is a awesome toy! Easy to pick up and I love that it&#x27;s mirrored inside with the colorfull pebbles my mini macaw loves it.</li>
    <li> Great price,  Teeth molds  fit well on teeth when I used hot enough water in cup.  Trimming it alittle before  warming up in hot water helped.  Put  whitening gel in fridge  when not used  to extend life of gel.  Carefully used small amount of gel  on mouth mold  to help reduce irritating gums.  Noticeable difference after 2 applications.... Happy with results.....</li>
    <li> Really whitens quick in 30 min intervals but burns gums easily and makes teeth pretty sensitive the day after</li>
    <li> I can see a improvement in the color of my teeth.. Good product, i will buy again in the future.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time.  Seems like a good product especially for the price.  Fitting the trays took about 10 minutes and you end up with a nice custom fit.  I&#x27;d say it is more effective than the paint on gel but less convenient than the strips.</li>
    <li> I saw a noticeable difference in the color of my teeth after 3 uses of this product. This kit has done more whitening on my teeth in 3 days then Crest white strips have done in a month. I was skeptical about buying this because I read all of the negative comments and the kit is so inexpensive. After looking at the negative comments again after using this stuff, it is obvious that most of the people who didn&#x27;t like it either didn&#x27;t fully read the instructions and/or had sensitive teeth/gums and shouldn&#x27;t be using any whitening kit in the first place. The instructions provided in the box are short, but very clear and informative, and makes using this product very simple. But if you&#x27;re like me and want to double check that you are doing everything right, the instructions encourage you to visit the companies website ([...]) where there are instructional videos and photos. It&#x27;s important that you take your time fitting the trays. You are supposed to boil water, wait for the water the cool slightly, then dunk the tray in for a few seconds (I saw several comments where people complained that the tray went limp when they put it in the boiling water, this is an example of people not reading ALL the instructions). You can repeat putting the tray in hot water and around your teeth several times, just be careful not to let the edges fold in. Once you have fit the trays right, you are told to trim them so it touches as little of your gums as possible to help prevent the whitener from irritating your gums. Again, if you take your time with molding and trimming your trays (I think it took me 15 mins)  you will get the best results. The light that came with the whitener is really easy to use and can be placed in your mouth so you can multitask while whitening. I think it&#x27;s important to note that less is more then it comes to putting the whitener in the tray. A small ball of whitener on each tooth imprint on your tray will prevent the whitener from getting on your gums and mouth. Inever had a problem with getting the whitener in my mouth, but I got a little on my gums my first time using this and it tingled but didn&#x27;t hurt. I used a cue tip to wipe off my gums while the tray was still in my mouth, and the tingling went away almost immediately. This is a really great and strong product, and the price just can&#x27;t be beat. If you are able to read and follow simple directions, using this should not be a problem. I will definitely be ordering the bigger box next time, my whole family wants to try this after seeing my results!  My only somewhat complaint is that the trays are not the greatest, but the whitener is amazing. I may purchase a nicer tray, even though it really isn&#x27;t necessary. You get the most bang for your buck with this product, so I&#x27;m not upset at all over having to get a better tray; it will still be cheaper then most other whiteners and definitely more effective.</li>
    <li> Been using this work about two weeks.  Seems to have made a difference.  Good amount of product for the low price, especially with the blue light included.  Do be careful not to get onto your gums though, because it will irritate them.</li>
    <li> Effective and easy to use. Multiple uses in kit and great for first time whitening or maintenance whitening.</li>
    <li> This whitening system work slowly but effectively. Hard to gauge how much whitening gel to use. Instructions helped</li>
    <li> Love it! Seriously already see a huge difference. I was a 3 on the shade chart and after 4 uses Im close to a 1. Only pain in the rear was the molding of the mouth guards but that was operator error I should of taken the time to make sure I had followed the instructions closely. DEFINETLY recommend!</li>
    <li> I am not a fan of at home teeth whitening products. So, I only used strips so far. But strips are not strong enough, so I wanted to try a gel and tray kit. I warmed and formed the trays a few times, and they are now a great fit for my teeth. I used very little gel as instructed and results are great. Although I only used it a couple times so far, I have noticed my teeth looking whiter! I&#x27;m a fan now.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical, but ordered anyway because of the low cost. I am 75 years of age and my teeth were yellowing at the gumline. Twenty minutes cleaned almost completely..Another 20 and the teeth were glistening white. One caveat....DO NOT LEAVE the gel on for more than 15 or twenty minutes. I left it on the top for the 1st time for TWO hours..big mistake.  Follow the directions or you will have sore gums and lips for days... I say this from my experience.  The twenty minute routine caused NO problem!</li>
    <li> Just used today, was somewhat daunting to mold the trays .. but turned out to be quite easy!  No sensitivity to the gums after first use.  Look forward to seeing results.</li>
    <li> This product does NOT contain the light! The light is pictured and even listed in the instructions. It isn&#x27;t listed in the contents though.I am not sure if the gel works without it. It seems like an important part of the system. I should have read the contents more carefully but I feel tricked.</li>
    <li> The gel is powerful, but burned my gums.  I was not able to whiten my teeth over consecutive days due to excruciating pain nor could I eat anything but noodle soup.  I had to let my gums heal.  Then I was able to apply again w/o pain.</li>
    <li> Amazing! Stop debating between this product and the other product your eyeballing. Yes, it does work and after 3 days or a few weeks (depending on how sensitive to treatment you are) you will be glad you bought this. ***TIP: I prevent damage to my sensitive gums by placing a small drop on each tooth directly and carefully placing gel over desired surface and in between teeth with ring finger, before placing trays. Helps to better regulate amount/placement and easily remove excess before u hurt yourself***</li>
    <li> Works very good. Noticeable difference.</li>
    <li> What a great product and although it has only been a week since I have had kit it already shows. The process is very easy once you mold and customize your trays. Just put the gel in the trays and wear them. Each tube last at least 5 treatments if not more. No need to waste the gel. If the gel is not touching your teeth it will not whiten. If the gel is touching your gum, it will make you uncomfortable. Great price, super fast Amazon shipping I will definitely buy another just to keep my teeth white. It does come in a nice sealed box, it would make a good gift. Thank you Amazon for speedy service.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good whitening treatment. I didn&#x27;t do my trays very well though so the bottoms are slightly uncomfortable and I can&#x27;t find anything that will cut the dang things. I also have no idea what to do with the light as there aren&#x27;t any instructions for it.</li>
    <li> Excellent! I loved it. I am an ex smoker and it took all the yellow off. Just follow the directions and you will get great results.</li>
    <li> Great product fast shipping</li>
    <li> I did get whiter but wasn&#x27;t enthused with the speed or how much whiter I got.  I probably will not try this product again.</li>
