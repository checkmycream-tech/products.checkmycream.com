<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> There r so many out there and revlon has always been trusted before with the good price I couldn&#x27;t pass it up. I wish I had!! It doesn&#x27;t get hot enough and I get this half a wave when your going to wrk u don&#x27;t have time to wash your hair and start over. U don&#x27;t even wanna know what it looked like at the end of the day.  Spend the extra $15-20  on bed head</li>
    <li> Gives amazing curls but not very hot</li>
    <li> This is more like a glorified \\&quot;crimper\\&quot; than a waver. The barrels are small enough that if you use it as intended (just pressing your hair in between the plates), your hair will look kinky and unnatural. I was hoping for more curl, so luckily I found a blog that showed how to weave one-inch sections of hair in a figure eight between the barrels. The result is about as close as I think I can get to a natural looking beach-y wave/curl (despite the hair spray required to hold it) because it gives more dimension than the bouncy cylinder coil you get with a regular curling iron. I&#x27;m usually very happy with the look and have gotten compliments. As for heat, I have relatively fine hair and I still have to use the hottest setting and wait for longer than the instructions recommend (15 seconds per section, versus 5-8). The wave lasts for the length of the day -- after sleeping on it the ends will be straight again. If you have really thick or a lot of hair that is hard to curl, you might want to get the Jumbo waver or another brand instead.</li>
    <li> I have thick, naturally wavy hair. All except the front, that is. The front of my hair tends to have very loose waves as opposed to the rest of my hair. Have been using this on the front and it works great. Creates a similar wave pattern to my natural wave. And mine certainly gets hot enough to hold the wave all day. I use a thermal protectant before using the waver and then a glossing/finishing cream afterward and get excellent results. And the price is great, too!</li>
    <li> love love love this!!!!! love the curl!!</li>
    <li> This product worked even better than I thought it would. It creates perfect \\&quot;s\\&quot; curls, heats up quickly, and the curls last for 2 days.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this off of amazon.com; however, I did buy this product at a local Walmart. This product is supposed to give you waves in your hair; unfortunately, the results are terrible. DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s worth the price. I have allot of hair, its very thick. It took an hour with this iron. I&#x27;m sure it would be better if you have help or thinner hair.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t get hot enough</li>
    <li> works with only 110v , but it works need to spend another 16$ for power adapter.</li>
    <li> I got this from the nearby drug store for about $17. The first time I used it, i thought it did not work and wanted to return it back. But then I thought i&#x27;d give it another shot.     Things to remember -   - Dry your hair completely (as for any style). If it is greasy/oily, wash it.   - Use a heat protectant spray/lotion. I used Chi Heat protectant spray.    - It takes some time to heat up. They say it takes 60 seconds, But leave it on for about 3-5 minutes before use. This is key. The first time, i just let it stay on for 60 seconds and it did not give me any waves.  - It does not get too hot even on high (I like it since it wont damage my hair as much) but it can burn your scalp or ears, so be careful. I always use on High.   - Untangle and section your hair well for best results. You&#x27;ll figure this out after you use it couple of times.   - Start from the roots, leaving about an inch from the scalp, to avoid burning and for good styling effect.   - Tip: Use the barrels to guide you for uniform waves. Place the beginning of barrel over the last wave to get the uniform effect.  -  Start from back, then work upto sides and the top. Its just easier, but not a rule.   - Do not brush or comb after. Use fingers to lighten the waves if needed.   - Use a spray or any other product to complete the style and to avoid frizz, and also to give the hold.   - I have shoulder length hair and it took about 15-20 minutes to complete my style.     Pros:  - Works. But needs practice.   - Heats up just right (some people prefer products to heat more as it quickens the styling, but I prefer healthy hair to faster styling; its just my view).   - Waves stay for a whole day. And maybe ever for next two days, if you would care for it well, and apply right products.     Cons:  - Takes time to heat up.   - Takes about couple of practices to get the perfect look.   - My hair got a little frizzy. But after I applied Garnier shine serum after the style, it was OK.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;VE HAVE A REVLON CURLING IRON WHICH I&#x27;VE HAD FOR 8+ YEARS SO I THOUGHT HEY REVLON I TRUST THEIR PRODUCT...    THINK AGAIN    THIS IRON DOESN&#x27;T EVER GET HOT...    IF U PURCHASE THIS PREPARE TO RETURN...SAVE THE BOX!!    AN IRON SHOULDN&#x27;T TAKE FOREVER TO GET HOT...I&#x27;M RETURNING THIS</li>
    <li> This gadget looks cool in the advertisements.  However, it doesn&#x27;t do much in real life.  We used it once, it did basically nothing to my daughters hair, we put in back in the box and it has sat ever since.  I guess if you used a massive amount of product the elusive \\&quot;wave\\&quot; might actually appear in your hair.</li>
    <li> this hairwaiver does not heat up well its terrible at least for african american women i would not recommend it</li>
    <li> When I bought this the little black cap to hold it came off. it doesnt heat up hot enough. and it just takes forever because it doesnt get hot enough.</li>
    <li> I wish I never bought this tool.. It fried my hair and did not gave me a wave at all..! Very disappointed, I returned the next day!</li>
    <li> This crimper/waver is very efective on my hair. I have very thin hair though and this crimper will wave my hair like inbetween the braided and curled look! I love it. My hair almost never withstand curls because it is so thin, but if I wash my hair the day that i crimp it with this barrel it will curl very nicly and it will stay in for a day or two after i crimp it. I love this crimper because it will give my hair a LOT more body and life. As i said before i have really thin hair and it is straight. I get asked if i starighten my hair! But if I use this on my hair before i go to school or anything it will hold the curl the whole day and make my hair much much more full. It is a good item to do pretty much whatever you want. I only hold the iron on my hair for about10-15 secs. and it has nice beautiful curls! I would suggest this item if you have hair that is straight or if you would just like something fun to do with your hair :)</li>
    <li> It gave me exactly the look I wanted. I have really long, straight hair and this worked perfectly for me. If you want to do it right, it takes a while (maybe up to 45 minutes) but it heats up pretty quickly and works really well. I&#x27;m glad I bought this!</li>
    <li> It holds the curl in and creates great waves</li>
    <li> Not that great. But hey, I&#x27;ll use it anyway.</li>
    <li> I bought this product at nearby Walmart for $16. First time I used it was ok, it took me a few times to master the waves overlapping technique. The 2nd time I used it, the spring broke and now no tention on the iron when you&#x27;re trying to close it with your hair in between. I am going to return it and get my money back. It&#x27;s basically piece of crap.</li>
    <li> I bought this after my old 3 barrel waver (Gold N Hot) got damaged by someones stupidity lol(it worked great by the way!). I read the reviews that discussed it&#x27;s inability to heat properly but had hoped that maybe there had just been a defective \\&quot;batch\\&quot; and that mine would work OK. Unfortunately it did not. I have long hair which has always been easy to curl/style. This waver just didn&#x27;t work. I tired leaving it plugged in for 20 mins before using it, held it on my hair for extended lengths of time (this occasionally worked for a very subtle wave. However, even if it did manage to get warm enough to barely wave my hair this way, it cooled down in between strands and needed to sit and \\&quot;re-warm\\&quot; itself. I love Amazon and have never had a negative experience with them and felt awful returning this -but it just didn&#x27;t do the job. I exchanged it for the Bed Head deep waver and absolutely love it (It&#x27;s well worth the extra money!)If you are thinking about purchasing this waver, I urge you to reconsider and save yourself the hassle of having to return it, as there are much better ones listed on Amazon!</li>
    <li> I initially purchased this to use on my 8 year old daughter&#x27;s hair.  Her hair is extremely long (goes to the waistband of her pants), and I wanted something that I could quickly use in the morning and have her hair be wavy, as hot rolling or using one of the many curling irons we have ends up taking too long and frustrating both her and me while doing her hair.  Her hair is soft and fine, but she has a LOT of hair.  Her hair is naturally wavy, but with the weight and length of her hair, the waves don&#x27;t come out and stay unless it&#x27;s really humid.    It took about the same amount of time as it does when I use my Chi on her, the result was beautiful waves that stayed pretty well in her hair without using any hair product to keep it wavy.  It earns an A+ for her hair.    I have shoulder length hair with a fair amount of natural curl that I normally blow dry and straighten because it mainly only curls on the bottom of my hair, resulting in a hairstyle that looks like it&#x27;s been hot rolled.  It&#x27;s pretty, but it gets boring to me to have the same style all the time.  My hair, like my daughter&#x27;s, is soft and fine, but it&#x27;s not as thick as her hair.  I decided to try this on my hair to see how it would do, and I LOVE it.  It takes the same amount of time as it would for me to use my Chi, but LESS time for styling it, and it looks fabulous.  I use hairspray after I \\&quot;fix\\&quot; it, and it stays the way I fixed it until I brush or wash it.  I&#x27;ve also brushed it and re-sprayed it and had nearly the same hair style, just with a little more \\&quot;floof\\&quot; to it.      Drawbacks?  None.  It heats up fast, does a great job, and when I&#x27;m finished with it, I turn it off and slide it into my Vera Bradley curling iron cover.</li>
    <li> i love this waver. i bought this because i have streight hair with no wave or anything its just streight! i was worried tho it wouldnt hold bc when i curl my hair it dosent stay. but i use aussie hair spray and it holds all day and night. it sucks that it takes me so long to style my hair with it. but i have long thick hair.</li>
    <li> This product fell apart the first time that I used it.</li>
    <li> black plastic thumb piece broke off right away.</li>
    <li> Burnt half my hair off... Awful item and was unable to contact the seller. Not even worth one star</li>
    <li> Well, I love the wave pattern this has. I ever since my old Vidal Sassoon waver went nuts and started giving me &#x27;bangs&#x27; because it gets *way* too hot, I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for the perfect triple barrel waver. And honestly I have like 7 of them. Isn&#x27;t that ridiculous? Of all of them I like the wave patter of this one by far the most. Not too big, not too small, has the little edges on both sides to make your curls a bit &#x27;harder&#x27; (don&#x27;t know how to explain that). But even the very highest setting is WAY too cool. It takes forever to even create a wave --- very bad for your hair, better to have something much hotter that works much faster than cooler and slower --- AND because it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough the waves don&#x27;t last very long. Such a shame, if it just got even a BIT hotter I would be totally devoted to this. :/</li>
    <li> doesnt wave my hair as i wanted to ... maybe i will just keep using my crimp iron by conair</li>
    <li> This iron never gets hot enough to do more than faintly kink up my hair, even on the highest heat setting.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted. Delivered when promised and works like a charm.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t get hot enough and it also makes my hair look like I have an Afro</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with Amazon fulfilled purchases 10$ with prime awesome!!! Gimme more !</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loved it</li>
    <li> When I received this iron for Christmas, I was so happy. I used it on me and a friend and it turned out great! But, when I tried to use it one morning bore school (I hadn&#x27;t used it since Christmas) the whole top part snapped off of the iron.I wished I hadn&#x27;t gotten this and wasted my money.</li>
    <li> ok, so i used this item at my aunts house. i did my cousins hair with it and it worked really well.    PROS:  -Makes an AWSOME pattern  -My familys hair type is VERY fine, and CANNOT hold anything! i used hair spray on my cousin, but i tired it out with just a strand of hair before i did my cousin&#x27;s and it was STILL IN the next morning without using any hairspray!       CONS:  - HANDLE IS HARD TO LIFT  - ABOUT HALF WAY THROUGH DOING MY COUSINS HAIR THE IRON LACKED IN HEAT, AND I HADE TO LET IT SIT FOR A WHILE TO REHEAT.(my cousin&#x27;s hair is down to her back so it took a while)    BOTTOM LINE: I think its good enough 2 buy, and im going to buy 1 4 myself ASAP!</li>
    <li> Love it but I wish it could stay longer in the wind, maybe my hair is weak or the product... but I still liked the finish.</li>
    <li> Crimps good but hard to open</li>
    <li> Let me just begin with saying I&#x27;m not new to the triple barrel curling iron, I used to use one on my hair all through high school, and leant it to a friend and never saw it again, so I was looking to replace it. This curling iron is useless. It doesn&#x27;t get hot enough, takes a long time to get a slight wave on your hair (which I think has to do with the heat that it doesn&#x27;t put out). I used product and took my time curling both of my daughters hair, one has thin hair and one has thicker hair, and it was very disappointing for the amount of time I spent to try to make their hair last through church. I used product before and after and still, disappointed. I&#x27;m returning it ASAP, and going with one from a beauty supply???</li>
    <li> Creates great waves, yes, however I have already bought three and they seem to just stop working whenever for no reason. Look through the reviews and see it is a common complaint. Its not fair, why should I have to keep buying them? Scam artists are these sellers. Sell us refurbished no good products. Save your money, go to a store and buy one that way it makes for a much easier return.</li>
    <li> This item works fantastic on my hair which is very long and stick straight. If you spray your hair first the waves will stay for the entire day, I spray my hair after as well. I have never had a problem and I get a ton of compliments on my hair which is awesome because my usual idea of fixing my hair consists of me putting it in a pony tail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also used this on both of my daughters hair and they love it too.</li>
    <li> I thought it would have been better. It takes forever too heat up and doesnt wave your hair at all.. and i have thin hair! I am returning it and buying something else. I was disappointed.. revlon is usually a good company.</li>
    <li> HORRIBLE. does not work properly :(</li>
    <li> I received broken product</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t do what I needed. the waves were weak even on thin hair I ended up giving it away to someone else</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful tool. Heats up quickly, easy to use, holds the curl even the second day.  And it&#x27;s inexpensive.  Makes my hair look fantastic.  Don&#x27;t be afraid to try it!</li>
    <li> i have used mine 3 times only and got it just a few weeks ago and it already doesnt work!!! the light will come on but will not heat up at all!!!!! i never dropped it or used hair products while im using it in my hair ,, i went to beauty school and i had a revolon one of these then and it still never gave up this quick at all!!!</li>
    <li> Do not buy this unless you have really thick hair. I thought I had thick hair until I bought this waver. It made my hair look so thin and did not style well. Moreover, it takes a very long time to heat</li>
    <li> Product did not work very well. It took a very long time to heat up and when it did, it did&lt;br /&gt; nothing but make weird lines in my hair that did not resemble waves at all.</li>
    <li> I was exited bout trin he 3 barrel and it doesnt wave hair it crimps it not the syle it promises package is gone an just ave it 2 my 13year old since she kinda like crimping.</li>
    <li> This exact waver was almost twice as much money in a retail store!  My daughter loves how it makes her hair.  It is easy to use and is not too bulky to store away.</li>
    <li> Amazing price, super fast shipping and the best quality ever.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been searching for something like thse and it works amazingly.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> My sister LOVES it. She uses it all the time and her hair never got damaged as other people say. She gets wonderful waves as she calls them. However it does take a lot of time to heat up.</li>
    <li> The waver works well, except for the fact that it gets very hot and you have to becareful not to hit your neck with it. I received several burns from it</li>
    <li> It burnt my hair !!!!</li>
    <li> It does not heat up very quickly and you need to allow yourself a lot of time to get the style you want because you have to leave it on your hair for a long time for it to crimp. Not great.</li>
    <li> Works well pleased with it</li>
    <li> DO NOT PURCHASE! I have short, thin hair that crimps easily with my other waver, and this one literally does NOTHING. I can&#x27;t imagine that this would be successful on someone with long or thick hair if it will not do anything for mine. Do yourself the favor and don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> nice heavy just takes too  long to heat up and you have to go over it 3 time to curl.....</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel like it gets ad hit as it should to work effectively</li>
    <li> I bought this at a local drugstore as well. It basically made me look like Hermione Granger a la the first Harry Potter movie... frizzy, poofy, fried, crimped, etc. No matter how long I held it in one area, it did not make the back wavy at all. The front would like wavy for about 5 minutes. I gave up and just put my hair in a ponytail after wasting 20 minutes on this thing. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> My hair is very defiant when it comes to straightening, curling, waving, or basically any form of styling.  This waver is easy to use, featuring a swivel cord, preventing tangled wires.  Using mousse on my hair before using my waver makes the waves stay all day looking soft versus wet.  Handling the waver can be annoying when getting pieces in the back but that&#x27;s not too awful.  I would recommend this to anyone with defiant hair, or really any hair type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(This review was written by my 15 year old daughter)</li>
    <li> I have read so many negative review of this product but I don&#x27;t understand why. I bought this waver last week from Walmart and honestly it&#x27;s probably the best 15$ I&#x27;ve spent on a hair tool. I use this product primarily when I wear extentions, and the extentions hold the perfectly sized waves for daysssss. Like it looks like it was just ironed days after the fact.  On my actual hair the waves don&#x27;t hold as perfectly but they still look fantastic. There&#x27;s about a 10% release of the initial wave after it has cooled, which is remarkable to me. I will say, however, it is slow to heat up (it says six minutes or something on the package), but that doesn&#x27;t matter at all to me. I just turn it on before I do my makeup, and by the time I&#x27;m done, it&#x27;s hot and ready! So happy I picked this waver, my hair is so voluminous and it makes my 20 inch extentions blend so well with my collarbone length hair.</li>
    <li> You have to hold it still at every section of your hair, and it makes your hair frizzy and causes split ends.</li>
    <li> I love my new curling iron!!! It works great and add a different look to my hair!! Love the waves!!!</li>
    <li> It gets pretty hot and works well. I think it has auto off because I left it plugged in one day (oops!) and it was off and cold when I got home.</li>
    <li> It shipped quickly, however I would advise that you get what you pay for as far as quality. It does not get very hot, so if you have thick hair I would encourage you to get one with different heat settings, this only has one.</li>
    <li> It was broken by the time it had gotten to me.</li>
    <li> This took me a little while to learn how to do correctly, but once I figured it out, its a breeze.&lt;br /&gt;I love this for every day or for going out.&lt;br /&gt;It takes a while to do your whole head if you have long hair, but its worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I love this, I use it all the time now.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended! :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned this \\&quot;waver\\&quot; for over two years and have never had a problem. I came to Amazon to buy one of these for a friend of mine since shes always made comments on my hair when I use this iron. Finally found my exact model at a great price and see all of the bad reviews. I usually take heed to the amazon reviews and read through thoroughly before making purchases. I however must say with this iron I have no clue why there is so much negative to be said. I am a cosmetologist and often buy and test new products for fun and also to educate clientele. I have had no problems with proper heating of this iron, yes there is one heat setting only but this iron left on for a period of time with intensify its heat. I let mine heat up while I blow dry. A light product should always be applied to hair before using any type of heat to protect the hair, this iron is no different. I&#x27;ve never experienced frizz from use, if anything it helped rid my hair of my usual frizz. I have however only used this waver on mildly coarse to fine hair so I am unsure of how it will work on coarse to very coarse hair. I don&#x27;t know if maybe the inconsistencies in the reviews is due to inconsistencies in the products production or what but from my perspective and as of my opinion I love this iron &amp; recommend it!</li>
    <li> Faulty product! Plugged it in and it started smoking! It&#x27;s joe in the bin!</li>
    <li> More of a kinker than a waver.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this item!!! Everyone at work and even my patients love my hair! I have very long and very straight hair. I thought i&#x27;d try something new and i just love this. Makes my hair look good on those days i just dont want to do anything to it!</li>
    <li> After months of having this product, i figured out how to use it. You must leave it on to heat up for more than 15 mins in order to get the waves to show up. The longer the better. And after finally learning that it broke after 3 uses. The front panel just popped off. Totally not worth it. At all.</li>
    <li> I love the way my hair looks after using it!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter when the plastic handle on her other 3 barrel waver broke.  She&#x27;s very happy with it, and likes it better than the larger one that broke.</li>
    <li> Garbage. It does not get very hot &amp; should be taken off the market. Don&#x27;t waste your time or money.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so shocked about these stupid wavers!&lt;br /&gt;i was so excited to use them, i received them this morning (11/11/2013) then i used them on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Not only did they start smoking when i turned them on, but i went to wave my hair and its burnt all my hair off at the back, i now have an inch length of hair. I have pictures of it and my hair is still stuck to the waver too all burnt. I&#x27;d like to report this to the seller, if nothing gets done, i will take it further.</li>
    <li> Product works really well. I use it to style my own hair and my extensions. You have to let it sit for a few minutes for it to heat up but overall the performance is good. The product didn&#x27;t come in Revlon packaging though.</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant to purchase this product after reading some of the negative post BUT I am so glad I went on my instinct.&lt;br /&gt;The initial use it took some time to warm up but any hair iron needs to warm up. the product is amazing and I get the look I exactly have been wanting and i can sleep on it and it looks great for the next day. If you have have issues or don&#x27;t get the look you want, try new hair style products. BUT this barrel waver is a GEM!</li>
    <li> Fake goods. It produces smoke and damaged my hair and burnt him. Strands of hair attached to the device. I need to replace.</li>
    <li> This waver really really sucks hardly makes waves due to not getting hot enough waste of money even though its cheap!!!</li>
    <li> My product came very quickly.  I love my Revlon Waver.  It works great.  No issues at all.  Very happy customer.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like this at all it takes for ever to get hot and it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair how it&#x27;s spouse to.</li>
    <li> I had one of these for 7 years until it quit working so i ordered another one and it works just as well love it</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t too impressed with the tool. Did not work out well for me, however I am not great at hair so to someone else this could be fantastic.</li>
    <li> Great perfect works great everytime !</li>
    <li> Works great, my advice is to leave it on high 30 min, part hair into sections and separate. Use a high heat spray and clean hair! My hair is thick and mid-back. I don&#x27;t recommend for short hair though.</li>
    <li> I bought this because my old iron gave up the ghost and I had seen these wavers and thought this would be a fun change -- you know, give me a new hairstyle without having to get a new haircut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, let me say that (though this has nothing to do with the iron itself), I didn&#x27;t realize when I bought this that it would take 5 to 6 times as long to do my hair as it used to because you have to curl one small section of one small piece of your hair and then move it an inch and a half and do it again and again and again all the way down that one section of hair.  (As opposed to using a curling iron which, since you roll the hair, curls one whole piece at a time.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this is NOT something you want to be doing every day unless you have a lot of spare time and don&#x27;t mind having your arms up for a really long time.  Like I said, I just didn&#x27;t think that through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, the iron only seems to curl when on high.  I felt like I was burning my hair.  And the worst part was, my hair only sort of curled and mostly just kinked and got frizzy!  Frizzy and slightly kinked hair after an hour?  No thanks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, unless you hold the piece of hair you are working on with your other hand the entire time you are curling it, it falls out of the barrels and snags at the bottom or just falls out entirely and doesn&#x27;t curl.  So you have to have BOTH arms up the ENTIRE time!  Unless you have short hair, this will be annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it for almost two months but found myself dreading doing my hair and finally just accepted that it was a bad purchase.  I&#x27;ll donate it to charity and I&#x27;d go buy myself something easier that makes my hair look better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to love it, I really did.  I just don&#x27;t have the patience to spend that long on my hair and my shoulders hurt afterwards too.  And forget about using it every two days -- the curls look terrible the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on the frizzy and less than shiny results, I&#x27;d neverbuy a Revlon again.  (I&#x27;ll stick with Conair.)  Who wants to spend an hour on their hair and still look like the before shot in a makeover?  Not me.  And the worst part?  People who had always complimented my hair before were suddenly frowning and asking what I&#x27;d done to my hair.  Not cool.</li>
    <li> I tried to review this item now twice and both times it was rejected and I&#x27;m still unclear as to why. I will keep this less detailed I suppose and simply say the product in general left a lot to be desired. It did not heat up nearly enough to wave my naturally thin hair. It also did not come in any official packaging as the second image in the description shows so I had to use my detective skills to ascertain exactly how to use it. To no avail.</li>
    <li> Love perfect for any type of hair</li>
    <li> WORKS GREAT FOR WAVES BUT GRTS VERY HOT. I ENDED UP burning the bed!it</li>
    <li> I LOVE this iron. It puts waves in your hair quickly and easily. I&#x27;ve used this on my hair and my daughters and we both love it. I had so many compliments on my hair after using it. It&#x27;s my favorite iron. Ü</li>
    <li> Its good! I use it when I want a beachy look if ya know what I mean n I have a two tone hair color n its looks cute!!! I suggest u use it with hair spray as ur  crimping if not you&#x27;ll just look like a bed head (if you have layers)</li>
    <li> This product is just what I was looking for. It heats up quickly, gives my hair great texture, and is easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;This gives you great waves for your everyday look.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my friend and she asked me to try it out on her hair. The FIRST time I used it, the hard piece that you hold on to, to open the clamp split in half. We have since duct taped it so that we won&#x27;t have our hands burning on bare metal. Aside from that, it does make really pretty waves. She&#x27;s happy that she doesn&#x27;t have to braid her hair every night in order to get the waves that she gets with the iron.</li>
    <li> Loved the first so much repurchased</li>
    <li> Buy only if your hair holds curl easily. The concept is great, but this particular one doesn&#x27;t get hot enough for my hair.</li>
    <li> WORKS EXACTLY LIKE I WANTED!</li>
    <li> At first I was extremely excited to get a waver, but now I just want my money back.&lt;br /&gt;First I used it on my hair, which is thick and curly. It didn&#x27;t work so I added some hairspray. I just ended up with fried ends and frizzy hair.&lt;br /&gt;So I proceeded to use it on my mothers fine, pin straight hair. That didn&#x27;t work either, so I added hairspray to it (3 or 4 spritz&#x27;). Not even a resemblance of a wave.&lt;br /&gt;Also took 15 minutes to heat up. I&#x27;d rather spend an extra few dollars on something that actually works. If I could I&#x27;d rate it half a star.</li>
    <li> I thought the product would give better waves but overall it just crimps your hair. I would not reccomend it.</li>
    <li> With my extremely thick hair it doesn&#x27;t curl well.</li>
    <li> Bad Bad Bad Very bad!!!!!!! it burns my hair every time I curl my hair,hundred hairs fallen.&lt;br /&gt;Never really return a thing, FYI dont get it!</li>
</ol>
