      <li>These are great.  </li>
      <li>It made very nice bun with smallest size.</li>
      <li>These arrived quickly and work perfectly.</li>
      <li>Things I liked about this product:</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and keeps her hair in place!</li>
      <li>Love these.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to play with it more tho &amp;</li>
      <li>One day the big one will be perfect.</li>
      <li>We use the biggest size for my daughter&#x27;s LONG hair and it works great!  </li>
      <li>These are super easy to use and give you a nice polished bun look</li>
      <li>I love these, I bought this set for a friend after she liked mine so much!</li>
      <li>The little one was perfect!</li>
      <li>Other than that they are great.</li>
      <li>but I ordered them for my daughters recital, and they showed up quickly and did the job.</li>
      <li>The different sizes are a great idea, but so far, I just use the medium.</li>
      <li>The extra large one is awesome for very long hair.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty intuitive</li>
      <li>Despite messing with her hair ALL day, these suckers stayed put and made her hair look great.</li>
      <li>So glad there are 3 different sizes.</li>
      <li>I was very worried about being able to do a proper bun for my daughter&#x27;s ballet recital.</li>
      <li>the small one works great for young girls.</li>
      <li>We hoped this would make it much easier to do buns.  </li>
      <li>It takes some getting use to and we&#x27;ve lost some hair due to tangles but we&#x27;re getting better with practice.</li>
      <li>I really needed the smallest size for my daughter because her hair isn&#x27;t real long, and is fine.  </li>
      <li>These are exactly what I was expecting except for the fact that the medium and large are almost exactly the same size.</li>
      <li>and my hair goes past my waist) and the small and medium are perfect and the large one I gave to my friend with shorter hair.</li>
      <li>I had thought this would be more like doing a sock bun where you roll your hair down it, but it is not, you put it at your crown &amp; wrap your hair around it.</li>
      <li>The set was just a typical bun set and could&#x27;ve been made better.</li>
      <li>Her hair is curly and falls just above her shoulders, but for certain ballet functions, she needs her hair in her bun, and this does the trick!  </li>
      <li>My hair was too short 2 make a pretty bun without these.</li>
      <li>(1) it comes with three different sizes, including a very small size, which was critical for me as my daughter doesn&#x27;t have a whole lot of hair; and (2) it comes in a blondish color, which was good because my daughter has dirty-blonde hair.  </li>
      <li>Easier than ever to pull all my hair off my neck and shoulders and still look classy and sheik.</li>
      <li>I use the rolling technique, most common with dancers, not the cover and rubber band technique though.</li>
      <li>I use the smallest one for my 4 year old daughter.  </li>
      <li>This product definitely made a decent bun a reality.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend, especially for 3 year olds with their mind of everything else besides their hair.</li>

<li> I ended up watching a few YouTube videos for hair donuts and following those instructions instead.</li>

<li> The other two are a little too small.</li>
<li> but I found a few tips that helped me get her dance bun done in minutes versus the 30 it used to take.</li>
<li> This set doesnt come with directions and even when looking up how to do it online, the material on these donuts is to stiff to pull hair over.</li>
<li> Unfortunately for my thinner shoulder length hair the small is the only size that works, but that&#x27;s my hairs issue, not the products.</li>
<li> Very stiff</li>
<li> Very stiff but can work with it.</li>
<li> Also, I found the instructions for how to use this product confusing.</li>
<li> But stopped using because my hair is so think, arms got tired trying to roll up every morning.</li>
<li> I hate that they stretch, because I have to let it sit for a day to form back to a snug hair piece to hold all my hair.</li>
<li> These were expensive (I believe drugstores had them cheaper)</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> These work great!! So glad there are 3 different sizes.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my niece to use at my wedding.  She is three and within 10 minutes of getting her done needed a touch up.  Despite messing with her hair ALL day, these suckers stayed put and made her hair look great. Highly recommend, especially for 3 year olds with their mind of everything else besides their hair. We did not use the included bobby pins or hair tie - we used Goody brand sprayed with hairspray to &amp;#34;grip&amp;#34; her hair.</li>
    <li> I have very long hair (I&#x27;m five feet five inches tall and my hair goes past my waist) and the small and medium are perfect and the large one I gave to my friend with shorter hair. I use the rolling technique, most common with dancers, not the cover and rubber band technique though.</li>
    <li> They stretch. It takes some getting use to and we&#x27;ve lost some hair due to tangles but we&#x27;re getting better with practice. Instructions would be extremely helpful. They just showed up in a bag with no guidance at all. We got help with You Tube.</li>
    <li> We use the biggest size for my daughter&#x27;s LONG hair and it works great!  I would recommend watching videos on youtube to see how others make these work.  It&#x27;s pretty intuitive but I found a few tips that helped me get her dance bun done in minutes versus the 30 it used to take.</li>
    <li> Works great for the perfect ballerina bun!</li>
    <li> These are great!  I use the smallest one for my 4 year old daughter.  Her hair is curly and falls just above her shoulders, but for certain ballet functions, she needs her hair in her bun, and this does the trick!  It&#x27;s easy to use and keeps her hair in place!</li>
    <li> My hair was too short 2 make a pretty bun without these. It made very nice bun with smallest size. Now as hair getting longer I can use the medium size . One day the big one will be perfect.</li>
    <li> These are super easy to use and give you a nice polished bun look</li>
    <li> This set doesnt come with directions and even when looking up how to do it online, the material on these donuts is to stiff to pull hair over.</li>
    <li> The extra large one is awesome for very long hair. The other two are a little too small. I couldn&#x27;t use the the medium sized one with medium length hair</li>
    <li> the small one works great for young girls.</li>
    <li> Arrived when/as ordered. But stopped using because my hair is so think, arms got tired trying to roll up every morning.</li>
    <li> Wonderful for my daughter who is a dancer. Work out perfectly for the ballerina bun.</li>
    <li> Love these. Easier than ever to pull all my hair off my neck and shoulders and still look classy and sheik.</li>
    <li> Loved them!  Very stiff but once you practice they work perfectly!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> We hoped this would make it much easier to do buns.  The set was just a typical bun set and could&#x27;ve been made better.</li>

    <li> These are exactly what I was expecting except for the fact that the medium and large are almost exactly the same size. Other than that they are great.</li>
    <li> I have blonde hair, thin, but a lot of it and these donuts work very well.  I watched a utube video on how to use these and viola! Perfect ballerina bun!  The different sizes are a great idea, but so far, I just use the medium.</li>
    <li> These were expensive (I believe drugstores had them cheaper) but I ordered them for my daughters recital, and they showed up quickly and did the job. Made putting in a bun a snap. Wish I had one when I was a child!</li>
    <li> I was unsure of what size to get so I got this 3 pack instead. Unfortunately for my thinner shoulder length hair the small is the only size that works, but that&#x27;s my hairs issue, not the products. I had thought this would be more like doing a sock bun where you roll your hair down it, but it is not, you put it at your crown &amp; wrap your hair around it. I&#x27;m going to play with it more tho &amp; see if I can make the sock bun technique work with it since that is easier for me personally.</li>
    <li> Very stiff but can work with it.</li>
    <li> I was very worried about being able to do a proper bun for my daughter&#x27;s ballet recital. This product definitely made a decent bun a reality. Things I liked about this product: (1) it comes with three different sizes, including a very small size, which was critical for me as my daughter doesn&#x27;t have a whole lot of hair; and (2) it comes in a blondish color, which was good because my daughter has dirty-blonde hair.  Things to note: although the donut ring is light-colored, the included bobby-pins are black. I ended up having to purchase blond bobby-pins separately. Also, I found the instructions for how to use this product confusing. (Note that these instructions do not come with the product but are posted on the product page on Amazon). I ended up watching a few YouTube videos for hair donuts and following those instructions instead.</li>
    <li> These arrived quickly and work perfectly. They get a little stretched out after each use, but I have a ton of long, thick hair, so it might just be me. I hate that they stretch, because I have to let it sit for a day to form back to a snug hair piece to hold all my hair. I just alternate between the largest and the middle one. I use them every day.</li>
    <li> I love these, I bought this set for a friend after she liked mine so much!</li>
