      <li>Always and Forever is a daily wear scent, very beautiful, feminine, and great for any age.  </li>
      <li>Its a beautiful, gentle, floral, scent that lasts.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s my FAVORITE perfume of all time and a must have.</li>
      <li>Happy to be able to get it on Amazon at such a good price.</li>
      <li>It is delightfully refreshing.</li>
      <li>Now I will always be on the look out to find more.</li>
      <li>Thank you for giving me a chance to purchase this perfume, I love the scent.     </li>
      <li>Not overpowering like most are.</li>
      <li>However, every fragrance I have tried of hers is divine and works on (most) everyone&#x27;s body chemistry.  </li>
      <li>I love this spray.</li>
      <li>This perfume is very floral and smells great.</li>
      <li>However, more often than not I find myself teaching for Jessica McClintock&#x27;s Always and Forever.</li>
      <li>I love the scent</li>
      <li>can&#x27;t say any more on product.</li>
      <li>Personally, I love the way my wife smells without it</li>
      <li>It seems to interact with me, I get so many comments asking me about what I am using.</li>
      <li>Very pleased with the quick delivery and product.  </li>
      <li>This scent is light, floral, and inspirational, with a touch of flirty.  </li>
      <li>It dosen&amp;#34;t seem to have the fragrance as strong as I remember it to have,</li>
      <li>Purchased as a gift for family member who has alergic reactions to most products, however this is quite mild and doesn&#x27;t make her break out.</li>
      <li>I bought this perfume and really wanted to love it because I love the original one.  </li>
      <li>&quot; I had to get it because right now I need everything that reminds me of my husband.</li>
      <li>If you like Always and Forever, I highly suggest trying the original Jessica McClintock too.  </li>
      <li>This is my second favorite Jessica McClintock fragrance.</li>
      <li>Jessica McClintock can do no wrong in my mind.  </li>
      <li>&quot; I have had other Jessica perfumes and liked them</li>
      <li>&amp;#34;Jess&amp;#34; by Jessica McClintock is great for the evening - though it&#x27;s out of production I think, so super expensive and rare.</li>
      <li>that this has been discontinued, she&#x27;s very particular about scents and she has always appreciated this one.</li>
      <li>and I really missed it until I received my order from Amazon.</li>
      <li>It seems to be a much lighter scent than what I have had before.  </li>
      <li>I love the scent of this perfume, but find the scent to be undetectable after only a very short time.  </li>
      <li>Has been my favorite for a  few years now.  </li>
      <li>I would not suggest for evening wear, however, the right dress/attitude could pull this off for a romantic night out.  </li>
      <li>She said this is extremely hard to find and it is her absolute favorite.  </li>
      <li>To Honeysucle for me, I usually wear Jessica McClintoc signature perfume, and I will stick with my original choice, my friend took it home though and loves it</li>
      <li>Definitely drives the price up on her perfumes, and makes certain scents rare, expensive, and coveted.  </li>
