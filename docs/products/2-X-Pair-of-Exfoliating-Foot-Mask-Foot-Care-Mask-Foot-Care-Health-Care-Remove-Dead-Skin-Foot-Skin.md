      <li>these are the best</li>
      <li>I was awesome!</li>
      <li>The seller is very good, it&#x27;s just the product that isn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>but Mint Mall was very kind about refunding the $.  </li>
      <li>Did absolutely NOTHING!!!!!!</li>
      <li>Love these, they are the best, they keep you from getting a pedicure every two weeks.</li>
      <li>But it does smell good.</li>
      <li>Omg, I love this stuff!</li>
      <li>It also does NOT come with its own booty.  </li>
      <li>the directions says not to pick at it, to let the skin fall off on its own.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll order more to maintain this effect.</li>
      <li>He was barely able to squeeze into his, but they did fit.</li>
      <li>I looked online and found something, but it may have been right</li>
      <li>Absolutely NOTHING!  </li>
      <li>,IT WORK BETTER THAN THIS PRODUCT,DO NOT HAVE ENGLISH INSTRUCTION</li>
      <li>It did absolutely nothing,  I was so looking forward to this working.</li>
      <li>IT WORSTLESS ITEM,DID NOT WORK,DON&amp;#34;T WASTE MONEY IN THIS PRODUCT,TRY TO SOAK IN THE WARM WATER AND SCUFF IT</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t a gel, but a thin, watery liquid, which might be good for getting into all the cracks and crevices, but is messier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love it yellow dry feet for years</li>
      <li>The instructions are not in English, so you have to guess if you are doing it right.  </li>
      <li>When I tried the socks alone, the liquid evaporated quickly and the booty was completely dry within 40 minutes.</li>
      <li>a week later i have pink smooth skin.  </li>
      <li>and I still have a few peely spots, but everywhere else is smooth and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>When you open this, the liquid begins to leak because it just contains two very wet paper towels, somewhat foot-shaped, true, but then what?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This was super late on delivery</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I ordered this product and expected it to work as stated.  Nothing happened.  Absolutely NOTHING!  I soaked my feet prior, used the mask for almost 2 hours and kept feet covered.  NOTHING HAPPENED!  Very disappointed!!!</li>
    <li> IT WORSTLESS ITEM,DID NOT WORK,DON&amp;#34;T WASTE MONEY IN THIS PRODUCT,TRY TO SOAK IN THE WARM WATER AND SCUFF IT,IT WORK BETTER THAN THIS PRODUCT,DO NOT HAVE ENGLISH INSTRUCTION</li>
    <li> Did absolutely NOTHING!!!!!! Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product. All the instructions are written in Chinese. But it does smell good.</li>
    <li> Did not work......not even a little bit.</li>
    <li> Omg, I love this stuff! I will be a lifetime customer.  No more pedicures for me! Pedicures ruin your skin feet!</li>
    <li> This was super late on delivery but Mint Mall was very kind about refunding the $.  Eventually it did show up, so I thought I would give it a try.  The directions are not in English but they require a 60-120 minute &amp;#34;bag-on&amp;#34; time for the foot mask.  After this time, my dinosaur feet were still terrible and over the ensuing days, there was no peeling like that offered by other products offered at a higher price.  My feet did not peel like those on the illustration.  The seller is very good, it&#x27;s just the product that isn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> It did absolutely nothing,  I was so looking forward to this working. Total waste of time.  I can not recommend it.</li>
    <li> I followed the directions. Soaked my feet for 30 minutes prior and left the booties on for 2 hours then soaked again for 30 minutes. Peeling started slowly after a couple of days and continues a week and a half later. Even my formerly cracked heels are smoothing out. I&#x27;m pleased. I&#x27;ll order more to maintain this effect. Hint: the directions says not to pick at it, to let the skin fall off on its own. I picked and got deeper than I should have. I had to clip the skin and use a bandaid. Don&#x27;t pick at it.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work as expected.  This isn&#x27;t the same formula that contains the acid that I have used before.  Those worked, this didn&#x27;t.  It also does NOT come with its own booty.  It is a soaked paper type booty. You will need to put grocery bag over your foot and then a sock over that.  When I tried the socks alone, the liquid evaporated quickly and the booty was completely dry within 40 minutes.</li>
    <li> I ordered a set of these at the beginning of December and they arrived a few days before Christmas, so expect about 2-3 weeks shipping time. The packs didn&#x27;t come with directions, but there are directions on the product&#x27;s listing page, so my husband and I each slipped a pair of booties on. He wears a men&#x27;s 10.5 and I wear a women&#x27;s 7.5. He was barely able to squeeze into his, but they did fit. After one hour we took them off and rinsed our feet. For the next three days we wore socks and kept our feet slathered with lotion. His feet began peeling lat on day three, mine didn&#x27;t start for another 24 hours, but eventually they both went through the whole gruesome peeling thing. I was awesome! It&#x27;s been over a week and I still have a few peely spots, but everywhere else is smooth and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best price for a pack of two peels. A resounding five stars.</li>
    <li> Love it yellow dry feet for years a week later i have pink smooth skin.  I can play footsy again.</li>
    <li> This product does not work at all. I used both sets of booties on my feet and nothing happened. Just a headache both times I used the product</li>
    <li> I had used the product Baby Feet prior to this purchase. It is rather expensive and this was advertised to do the same thing...it didn&#x27;t. I also gave some to my mother, daughter and daughter-in-law. It didn&#x27;t work for any of them at all.</li>
    <li> No.  Just no.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Messy: there is no internal package.  When you open this, the liquid begins to leak because it just contains two very wet paper towels, somewhat foot-shaped, true, but then what?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. There were no English instructions, not even helpful pictures.  I looked online and found something, but it may have been right, may have been wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Only after I opened it did I realize I&#x27;d need a plastic bootie (right… everyone has a supply of those lying around handy…) to contain the liquid.  I couldn&#x27;t even set the package down to go get plastic bags because it was already leaking!  It isn&#x27;t a gel, but a thin, watery liquid, which might be good for getting into all the cracks and crevices, but is messier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.  So, after all that, including finding a container/bucket for my feet, it didn&#x27;t actually do anything.  Two weeks later, nothing.  Not even a little, tiny bit.</li>
    <li> I wasted my money on these not only does it not tell on the package how to use them but they did NOTHING. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND BUYING!!!!</li>
    <li> This product did not work at all.  I hate wasting my hard earned money.  Please, go with the  known brands when purchasing these types of things.</li>
    <li> Love these, they are the best, they keep you from getting a pedicure every two weeks. these are the best</li>
    <li> Purchased this as an alternative to Baby Feet. I don&#x27;t think I will even try Baby Feet because this stuff DID NOT WORK AT ALL! The instructions are not in English, so you have to guess if you are doing it right.  I even left it on overnight and still NOTHING!  TERRIBLE PRODUCT, JUST TERRIBLE!!!</li>
