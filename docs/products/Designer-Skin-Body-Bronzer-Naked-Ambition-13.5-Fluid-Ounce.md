<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have sensitive skin. So i went thro the small hypoallergenic selection available. Designer Skin is a good brand. My previous hypoallergenic tanning lotion was by Designer Skin. So, I picked another one from them. Even tho this bottle says it is hypoallergenic right on the front of the bottle. It is not! I used it 1x and got huge boil like blisters covering my body-even on my face :-( And they were extremely itchy.  I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT IF YOU HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN. What I went thro was days &amp; days of holding ice packs on my blisters. I even wound up going to a Dr. Do not get if it is for the hypoallergenic label.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product it works great for those with sensitive skin and who dont tan as easily or as quickly as others. I would recommend to anyone</li>
    <li> I was concerned after reading 1 or 2 reviews that they didn&#x27;t think the lotion they received was the real thing but I had no such problem. It works great and smells great. The other reviewers may have not accounted for the fact that when a lotion does not have a lot of chemicals in it there will be a variation in the color per bottle. Very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Smells good! works great!!</li>
    <li> Smells good and is effective. I saw noticeable results in just a few uses</li>
    <li> Love the smell!! Didn&#x27;t see a big difference in color tho</li>
    <li> What I was looking for!  Very pleased!!</li>
    <li> Awesome lotion! Bought to get ready for prom and I didn&#x27;t burn once. I put it on before going tanning every time and didn&#x27;t get to golden, great lotion!</li>
    <li> Smells good but doens&#x27;t seem to tan as fast as other lotions I have used.</li>
    <li> I bought a sample of this lotion from the salon for $8!!! This is a super bargain. This product smells fantastic, is perfect for sensitive skin or acne prone skin (I can even use it on my face- first time ever!) and the smell makes you feel like a princess. I recommend it to the sensitive tanner.</li>
    <li> Love this tanning lotion, it smells amazing, works like a charm. It lasted for 3 months and I was going 3 times a week so I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Smells good but I think that&#x27;s all it&#x27;s good for. Used it while tanning religiously and I didn&#x27;t notice any &#x27;bronzing&#x27;. Wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> This Lotion is fabulous. The best I have ever used.  The scent and skin softness after using is wonderful.This is the only Lotion that I use.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get a new tanning lotion...for no reason though. it expired last year therefore its all watery and crappy. not impressed at all</li>
    <li> The smell of this lotion is way too strong. It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin moist like it indicates. I&#x27;m&lt;br /&gt;Concerned that its a knock off and I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m putting on my skin.</li>
    <li> This product was totally worth it. I love it! Smells nice and is a little bit more natural and pure than many lotions. It has the right amount of silicon so it goes a long ways and it doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling oily all day. I did my research prior to purchase and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
    <li> I signed up for a tanning salon so I would have a little tan before I went on my cruise(I didn&#x27;t want to look lie a tomato). the salon recommended this for my very pale skin type. I liked it so much I ordered another from Amazon</li>
    <li> I had never used a tanning bed before and spent over two hours researching and reading several different reviews before finally deciding on Designer Skin&#x27;s Naked Ambition. As soon as it arrived I opened the bottle and the smell alone made me happy I bought it. It smells amazing and even after I tan I smell great! It didn&#x27;t take but a couple sessions in the tanning bed with this lotion to see a noticable tan. I highly recommend this lotion! I know I will be buying another bottle once this one runs out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a ton of different lotions and this one is the best hands down. It doesn&#x27;t have a gross after tan smell and almost every other lotion I&#x27;ve tried has some unappealing smell after a tanning session. It doesn&#x27;t leave me streaky, it&#x27;s thick so it&#x27;ll last a while and is easy to apply. I took one star off because of shipping time. I have prime so it should have only been a 2 day shipping but it took 6 days.</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion online first in 2012 and the smell was a bit odd. When I ran out in January 2014, I decided to purchase a new bottle because I still liked the product. My most recent bottle smells nicer and is a slightly darker color than the old bottle. I feel I have gotten much darker over a shorter period of time. I have read that people think this product is fake or rebottled with something else. I have never purchased this product in person, so I cannot comment on what it is &amp;#34;supposed&amp;#34; to look like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either way, with both bottles,this lotion works with my sensitive skin and has never left any discolorations on me. The smell and color have been slightly different, but I could see that being differences in batches, or perhaps age of the product.</li>
    <li> Ok so I had been agonizing about purchasing a tanning lotion for quite awhile, and I&#x27;m so happy I bought this one!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of lotions, but recently I was reading about how there are some things in tanning lotions that aren&#x27;t so great (e.g. parabens, DHA) I wasn&#x27;t about to give up tanning, but I also didn&#x27;t want to do anything worse for myself than I already was... This lotion is great! Good ingredients, especially compared to many other lotions, and my skin feels so moisturized. It is a very thick lotion, smells like light apples, and no streaking or orange hands!</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking to get a more natural looking color while tanning, and not that instant orange tan look everyone seems to think looks good</li>
    <li> This works great and is a fabulous price.</li>
    <li> I have skin sensitivites to nearly everything, scents included. I am also gluten intolerant. This lotion is sooo smooth and quickly absorbing! The smell is OK but everyone has been commenting on how tan my legs are (and I tan year round, so it is definitely the change in lotion that is adding the color). Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Smells great!  No &amp;#34;orange&amp;#34; skin tone...  Just nice and tanned.</li>
    <li> I would buy this again and again due to the lack of chemicals and the AMAZING smell however it truly doesn&#x27;t do anything for indoor tanning. That is OK though because the lotion is good in and of itself. I just use Luminary before and this afterwards.</li>
    <li> My favorite lotion!  Extremely Happy!  Safe for very sensitive skin and leaves my skin soft and bronzed!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> So far I like this product. I think it smells better than alot of other tanning products. I&#x27;m waiting to see how quickly I will get color from it</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, really helped me tan quicker and made my tan last longer, it has a great sent! I have very sensitive skin and I did not break out!</li>
    <li> This lotion smells great. it gave me a orangey look to my tan where as I like a dark black (beach) like tan. Would use this in a pinch though.</li>
    <li> This is fabulous!  I tan indoors in a tanning bed.  My skin LOVES this product.  It smells delightful and is not greasy at all.  The scent is lovely.  It is slightly sweet, but not so much so that it is obnoxious.  It&#x27;s a light fragrance.  Not flowery and not musky.  I have been bronzing very nicely with it. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I just started tanning in the last 2 months or so, so I don&#x27;t have much to compare this product to. The first thing I will say is DO NOT buy tanning lotions at the salon! The bottle I bought (different product) when I signed up for the tanning package was over $60, and that was on sale. I knew it was over priced at the salon but didn&#x27;t figure it would be less than half the cost on Amazon (that&#x27;s what I get for not checking). Same thing goes for this product. The lotion I purchased at the salon was just a lotion, not a bronzer. I&#x27;ve been going tanning only about 1-2x a week, and this bronzer still gives me a nice golden color. I had been following what the bottle said about putting it on ahead of time, usually about an hour before I went tanning. Recently I tried putting it on at the salon right as I was going tanning, and it made me much darker. It smells good as well, but it&#x27;s kind of thick. The bottle has lasted me about 1.5 months, and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve been using too much. For the price it&#x27;s definitely worth it, and it would be good for someone like me who is just starting out/fair skinned, because it doesn&#x27;t make you too dark too quickly.</li>
    <li> Nice lotion, great smelling. Works well.</li>
    <li> This is a nice smelling lotion. It does not leave any orange tinge that most lotions do. But... It does not provide a means to a quicker tan. It definitely helps, but with time. I recommend for those who don&#x27;t want a bronzer.</li>
    <li> Great tanning lotion! Darkest I&#x27;ve ever got from Designer skin.</li>
    <li> I have super sensitive skin and this product works great. Goes on easy and works great with sensitive skin. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Awesome lotion. Great colour in only a few sessions. Smells amazing too!</li>
    <li> It arrived so quick and was exactly what I expected! It works so well and I have a great tan! Everyone keeps asking me what I use!</li>
    <li> very soft and smooth and smells really good even after tanning</li>
    <li> when I received this product it was already out of date. Product has been sitting in warehouse too long</li>
    <li> Nice light weight lotion, and gives a good natural tan color not that fake or cheap spray on look like others</li>
    <li> First of all I want to start by saying that you DO NOT have to purchase tanning lotion from a tanning salon!! The people that complain that the lotion was fake or made them break out are probably from tanning salon owners....Salon owners don&#x27;t want you to buy from the internet because it takes from their business.... There is nothing wrong with buying lotion from the internet because companies like Designer Skin and Devoted Creations sell to clients that sell on the internet.... with that being said, I bought this product and loved it!!</li>
    <li> For one, I ordered the wrong item but gave it a chance. It&#x27;s probably one of the worst lotions I&#x27;ve  used. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> I bought this in my tanning salon for 60 bucks. It has a very apple-like scent, which covers up some of the \\&quot;after tan\\&quot; smell. I tan easily and have noticed a deeper hue to my tan, than I would normally have. This lotion produces a natural-looking tan and doesn&#x27;t cause your hands to go orange. Like the other reviews, I have to concur that this is a very thick lotion. Shake the bottle upside-down, prior to hitting the tanning salon and squeeze it out into the cap. It goes a long way. Overall, I have to say that I am pleased with this product and will buy it on amazon from now on at more than half the cost of the salon.</li>
    <li> Way cheaper than the local tanning salon.  This is a great lotion, that smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> I like to switch between different bronzers and this one is a natural one so its not your typical brown lotion. Since its for sensitive skin its pretty gentle but still smells good and gave me pretty good color as well.</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion online first because it was cheaper than in the salons and I have had luck in the past with getting the ACTUAL PRODUCT.  However, this WAS NOT THE REAL THING AT ALL.  I ordered a second bottle from a good friend who owns a tanning salon and receives his lotion direct from &#x27;Designer Skin&#x27;.  Upon comparison I found the lotion directly from &#x27;Designer Skin&#x27; was white (as most if not all paraben free lotions should be) whereas this lotion was brown.  They smelled similar, but were definitely not the same.  There was SOME kind of tanning lotion in this bottle because it still worked.  Most likely it was a half and half mix of &#x27;Naked Ambition&#x27; and some other junk lotion.  I just get annoyed when I pay for something specific and I don&#x27;t get it.  For those who don&#x27;t know, it is often the case when ordering online that the lotion is altered in some way or just fake.  Sometimes the seller is bold enough to use a lotion that doesn&#x27;t tan you at all.  My friend with the tanning salon warned me about it, but the online deals are usually really cheap and I wanted this in a hurry so I (like a fool) ordered this one.  Order this one if you want.  Just don&#x27;t expect to get the real &#x27;Naked Ambition&#x27;.  You&#x27;re only guarantee is buying from a salon with a good reputation.</li>
    <li> It was a great product. I really loved the scent and the coloring effect. I would recommend this product for tanning, doesn&#x27;t make for an &amp;#34;orange&amp;#34; tint...nice and natural.</li>
    <li> This lotion is amazing! It gets me nice and dark very quickly! usually tanning lotion don&#x27;t smell to good, but this lotion smells amazing! I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This is by far the thickest lotion I&#x27;ve ever used. Its very rich and cream like. Too much and you&#x27;ll be rubbing for forever to get the product worked into your skin. It also makes it aggervating to get out of the bottle.The smell is subtle but fights that after tan funk really well. The color isn&#x27;t insane and builds gradually which is nice if you&#x27;re not looking to have that fake overnight tan look. Its like you&#x27;ve been getting a tan naturally. It does a great job moisturizing the skin well after your tanning secession ~</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think it really boosted my tan level at all. I won&#x27;t be purchasing it again.  I&#x27;ll go back to my former.</li>
    <li> I like to use this lotion before tanning, I started off pretty pale, but in the last month it has really helped me to tan.</li>
    <li> Amazing tan this summer from this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying out several different lotions, but this is by far my favorite! My favorite part about this lotion is how easily is slathers onto the skin. It&#x27;s not heavy, thick, or greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The smell on application isn&#x27;t overpowering either. It smells like a long island iced tea with extra sweet and sour mix. Even the ATO scent isn&#x27;t bad; reminiscent of cedar (and don&#x27;t play, ALL tanning lotions have a certain ATO odor).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And super bonus.....this lotion won&#x27;t turn you orange!! It gives me the best shade of bronze...NOT copper!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be buying this lotion again when my supply runs low.</li>
    <li> I must say I haven&#x27;t tried many tanning lotions, but from the ones I have tried this is my favorite. It is thicker so you don&#x27;t need as much to get the same results.No orange tint or funky smell.</li>
    <li> I have gotten a very beautiful tan and it is even. I love that it&#x27;s natural and that it doesn&#x27;t make me too dark - will definitely reorder!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this and it works ok but as many other reviewers have noted I&#x27;m not 100% convinced this is the real deal. Buyer beware!</li>
    <li> This is a good smelling lotion and I have a beautiful bronze tan. Only thing I do not like and this is really minor is that the lotion is really thick. Other then that this is a good lotion choice.</li>
    <li> I love this for tanning bed use.  Keeps my skin from drying out, no orangie traces on clothes or furniture and smell is ok.  It is not a self tanner.</li>
    <li> 2nd year I&#x27;ve used this lotion. I&#x27;m super pale so I have to make sure I don&#x27;t get something too dark that makes me look orange. It gives you a great color and doesn&#x27;t turn your body, or hands, orange. There isn&#x27;t much of a scent by the time you&#x27;re out of the tanning bed, but that&#x27;s not a big deal, to me. I&#x27;ve had issues with other lotions leaving my skin streaky or irritating my skin, but this one doesn&#x27;t do that. Just buy it! :P</li>
    <li> This lotion works for my skin. my sister works at a tanning salon and she has told me that this is one of the top lotions. i tan really easily to begin with but i get dark FAST with this lotion. plus it smells really good!</li>
    <li> I have only used this product twice but I am already seeing better results when compared to last year using a different Designer Skin product, which I also liked. The smell is light, but nice which is always a good thing.</li>
    <li> My tanning salon recommended this tanning lotion for people that didnt want the fake orange color some tanning lotions give you. Naked Ambition is a great lotion for a normal natural brown color. It also has a great scent. And buying this product from amazon saved me money from buying in the salon.</li>
    <li> Can packaged perfectly and looked completely un opened and un used and totally legit! all for a great price! I will be buying from here again</li>
    <li> I love this tanning lotion. Its great for indoor or outdoor use, smells great, and gives you a really great tan.</li>
    <li> Love this product, and received it fast.</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t love fruity scents, but this peach scent is light and beautiful. The lotion is not too thick or too thin either. Great choice.</li>
    <li> I got mine from the salon but, it smells amazing and the scent last all day. I&#x27;m super picky on lotions and smells and this is just amazing. It&#x27;s super soft and rubs in well and if you&#x27;ve been tanning for awhile and look for something new with a good bronzer this is it.</li>
    <li> Nice scent with no after tan smell. Very smooth. Needs an easier bottle to squeeze.</li>
    <li> Great color on my skin. Feels good n smells good. The best!</li>
    <li> Broke out all over my body. Do not buy tanning lotion only from a store.</li>
    <li> Love it! Great tanner and bronzer. Does not dry out my skin. Does not stink. Leaves me with a sexy tan. They sell this bottle for $55 at the tanning place I go to so I am glad I am an Amazon addict. :-)</li>
    <li> Used the whole bottle and liked it a lot! The smell I could do without but it&#x27;s a nice lotion!</li>
    <li> I liked this lotion. It has a pleasant scent and is a good bronzer with less of the dirty dozen harmful ingredients.</li>
    <li> For exactly what it is... it&#x27;s great.&lt;br /&gt;It smells delicious, which was a pretty big concern for me upon choosing. (How am I supposed to know what their version of passion fruit or honeysuckle smells like?)&lt;br /&gt;The lotion goes on really smooth and my skin feels significantly softer and lighter than my previous lotion.&lt;br /&gt;No, it doesn&#x27;t get you mahogany, and it&#x27;s a nice gradual color. If you&#x27;re wanting to be native american overnight, choose a different product. But again, for exactly what it is designed and advertised it is wonderful.</li>
    <li> Probably my favorite tanning lotion of all time now. I used to use only tingles but I tried this one randomly and I love it! I get dark super fast, which in Texas, it’s inexcusable to be pale. However I don’t tan in the sun very well so I must rely on tanning beds lol. Highly recommend this bronzer!</li>
    <li> Feels amazing on your skin. Very hydrating and smells great! Will for sure be getting again.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t worked like I expected.</li>
    <li> This product was over $45 at the salon, so glad I bought it here. I&#x27;ve been tanning off and on for years and have tried many many lotions. I have had skin reaction to some lotions but not this one. This lotion is extremely light weight, smells good and I get awesome color!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion! It smells great, and gives a more natural tan, I love how it&#x27;s not just for indoor tanning!</li>
    <li> Smells nice, and its got a nice texture.</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping and a super great price for this lotion!</li>
