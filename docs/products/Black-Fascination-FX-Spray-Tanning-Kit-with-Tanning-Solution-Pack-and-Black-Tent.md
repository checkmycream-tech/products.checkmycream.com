<li> the tent is difficult at first to fold up once expanded, however viewing on You Tube will help you with that.  </li>
<li> The only thing is that the tent is a little small.</li>
<li> so that&#x27;s the only negative.</li>
<li> I believe that the company used a translation web site, so you can imagine what a mess it is.</li>
<li> and I had little metal shavings that sprayed out</li>
<li> Taller people will be a little squished.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on a Norvell machine.</li>
<li> The vendor also corrected a small problem with one of the solutions.</li>
<li> However, the instruction book needs some serious, serious editing.</li>
<li> Poor quality gun and dispenser.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m moving to Korea where tanning salons do not exist and shipping a tanning bed over is too expensive.</li>
<li> the customer service from the actual company was awful</li>
<li> However, I bought this to spray myself, so it&#x27;s impossible to keep from tilting the gun.</li>
<li> Worst of all, the solution leaks from the plastic very bad.</li>
<li> This machine is terrible!</li>

    <li> Great machine and kit. I will def buy from seller again as they were super fast with shipping!</li>
    <li> It works great for myself at home. Easy to use. Great color!</li>
    <li> I used to work at a salon and I am very impressed with this product. It sprays pretty evenly and nicely. The only thing is that the tent is a little small. Perfect for short-average height people. Taller people will be a little squished. Other than that I would totally recommend!</li>
    <li> This is every tanners must have. I&#x27;m moving to Korea where tanning salons do not exist and shipping a tanning bed over is too expensive. I purchased this instead and already tried it out. The color is insanely beautiful. I have gotten so many compliments. ive seen this same unit sell for 500.00 else where.</li>
    <li> Gotta say I love my new spay tanning system..I&#x27;m slowing turning all these white Alaskan &#x27;s golden brown. Easy to use. Portable. Everyone needs one of these</li>
    <li> This machine is perfect, it sprays even and is easily controlled. The tent is super tall and sturdy, plus norvell is a beautiful tan product.</li>
    <li> Extremely happy with this purchase. For the price, you can&#x27;t beat this at home experience. The vendor also corrected a small problem with one of the solutions. Very quick response, and generous solution. Highly recommend this vendor as well.</li>
    <li> The tanning solutions are good. The gun is made of cheap plastic. I would not have ordered if I knew this.</li>
    <li> I got expired solution.</li>
    <li> This machine is terrible! It leaves the person tanning very splotchy and I would not recommend this machine to anyone! You can&#x27;t get a full refund either unless the machine is new, but you won&#x27;t know how it works until you use it. Doesn&#x27;t make any sense!</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift. Had a professional come in to give a lesson on how to use it. Both the recipient and the professional love it. However, the instruction book needs some serious, serious editing. I believe that the company used a translation web site, so you can imagine what a mess it is.</li>
    <li> The machine works as expected.  You need to watch a couple of youtube videos to get the process of spray tanning at home right.  My husband picked it up real quick and now we save so much money by doing it at home instead of paying a salon!  The Norvell Venetian product that came with the kit is my favorite color ever.  Very natural looking.</li>
    <li> Got for a friend of mine who is qualified to do tis work. I am not, but she will make me the palest suddenly tan person in exchange for the help.  Hope it works.</li>
    <li> The machine is very good, unfortunately, the gun is not good. The spray gun is plastic. Worst of all, the solution leaks from the plastic very bad. I would say that 1/3 of the solution leaks out as you spray. If you hold the nozzel even and never tilt it, it would work well. However, I bought this to spray myself, so it&#x27;s impossible to keep from tilting the gun. Poor quality gun and dispenser. Good quality compresser.</li>
    <li> Literally the best airbrush machine I have gotten. It is amazing. Don&#x27;t waste your money on a Norvell machine. Buy this exact one. I was always skeptical because of how good the price is, but I use it all the time and my tan comes out flawless! I use the Norvell Venetian plus solution with this and it looks awesome! Definitely a great buy. However the tent I had issues closing so that&#x27;s the only negative. But the system is definitely worth the buy!!!! Recommend it to anyone who airbrush tans!!!</li>
    <li> I love this set up... the tent is difficult at first to fold up once expanded, however viewing on You Tube will help you with that.  This is a professional tanning spray which I love.  It sets in an hour instead of 12, and now I don&#x27;t have to pay $35.00 per spraying.  Price is fantastic!</li>
    <li> Love! Great tan and much cheaper in the long run then going to a place to get it done.</li>
    <li> Mine didn&#x27;t come with instructions. I contacted the seller and they were wonderful!</li>
    <li> I would not recommend this product to anyone. First  Time I used it leaked all over it quit spraying and I had little metal shavings that sprayed out I had a spring that came out of the machine. the customer service from the actual company was awful I would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
