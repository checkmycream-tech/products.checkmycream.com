      <li>These are great!</li>
      <li>Why NOT use the best?</li>
      <li>The four blade version is the best of those.</li>
      <li>Best part about it is that you can refill it.</li>
      <li>After using it, I am so impressed with the closeness of the shave that the four blades give!  </li>
      <li>I also shave under my arms and the results are great there, too!  </li>

      <li>These are great.</li>
      <li>I was happy.  </li>
      <li>I too thought the Gillette 3 was great until I tried the quattro for women.  </li>

      <li>so yeah, good stuff.</li>
      <li>The Quattro feels good in the hand</li>
      <li>whatever...I want a good durable sturdy razor that doesn&#x27;t leave me with t.p.</li>
      <li>It feels good when you hold it.</li>
      <li>Superior comfort</li>
      <li>and she feels like she has good control over the razor to get a good close shave.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s a good quality handle--solid, of a good weight.  </li>
      <li>I also think the schick quattro is one of the better ones out there, and does a great job which is why i was re-purchasing.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so happy :) &lt;</li>

      <li>This razor is amazing.  </li>
      <li>This is a nice razor.  </li>
      <li>I honestly will never guy this product again.</li>
      <li>This razor feels nice in your hand, the head moves as you shave, and it gives a nice, close, shave.  </li>
      <li>, I think I liked the color.</li>
      <li>It has a great weight to it, and is more environmentally friendly than disposable plastic razors.</li>
      <li>I started shaving with it, I was surprised at how awesome the handle was.  </li>
      <li>I have very fine hair on my legs and under my arms</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also excellent on the more sensitive areas of a woman&#x27;s body.  </li>
      <li>comes with a cute holder for the shower and Amazon has by far the best price around.</li>
      <li>No other razor has been so consistently awesome as this one.  </li>
      <li>and I thought it was pretty great...</li>
      <li>\\&quot;I LOVE IT\\&quot; Would recommend it to any woman who wants a good razor!</li>
      <li>The handle is very comfortable and weighted.</li>
      <li>Very smooth</li>
      <li>I suspected, the handle was much better.  </li>
      <li>Now there are so many women&#x27;s razors in the marketplace.  </li>
      <li>My legs were silky smooth and stayed that way for a couple days!</li>
      <li>Lovely handle.  </li>
      <li>those disposables gave me a better shave.</li>
      <li>Many said it prolonged the periods between shaves since it was that close of a shave.</li>
      <li>/&gt;After being so pleased with the disposable razors, I decided to invest in the this razor with disposable razor heads.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this product, it is really lovely.</li>
      <li>This one is fabulous!</li>
      <li>I love this razor.  </li>
      <li>I really love Schick Quattro</li>
      <li>which is more than I can say for any razor I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
      <li>I really love this razor.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s heavier &amp; more substantial.  </li>
      <li>but the product was OK.  </li>
      <li>I bought one from Amazon and was totally pleased with the speed of delivery and price and that it came in the orange, which I hadn&#x27;t seen at any store before.</li>
      <li>Was expecting much more.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had so many razors...electric razors, one use razors, venus razors, every razor.  </li>
      <li>I have always  love schick blades</li>
      <li>I just LOVE it.</li>
      <li>although when I did, it sure makes one heck of a clatter.</li>
      <li>you&#x27;ll love it too.</li>
      <li>please don&#x27;t tell her :)</li>
      <li>In fact, the most I ever did was trim, but I wanted to try going hair-free in my bikini area without the pain and cost of waxing.  </li>
      <li>The refill blades will still fit the older handles, but they don&#x27;t sit correctly anymore, and don&#x27;t do a very good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This razor lasted a long time, I was very impressed.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if the moisturizing strips really do anything, but the razor works well, feels comfortable to use, and I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
      <li>SO EASY NO CUTS CLOSE SHAVE :)</li>
      <li>It has a nice glide to it and really goes nicely over your curves.  </li>
      <li>So I would say if you have a light to moderate amount of hair growth, this may be the perfect razor for you.  </li>
      <li>I did some research and came up with many good reviews on the Schick Quattro for Women High Performance Razor.  </li>
      <li>The four blades provide a more substantial, comfortable shave.</li>
      <li>I love the chrome metal feel to it, makes it a bit heavier than normal razors and has a good grip.</li>
      <li>I gave her one of my multi-blade razors to try and she loved it so much she had to buy some of these.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love it, its easy to hold, sits close to the hair and leaves my legs silky smooth.</li>
      <li>After more than a decade of using an original Venus razor, I tried this one out.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I used the mens schick 5 hyrdo first and it worked great, don&#x27;t know exactly why I tried this one</li>
      <li>What I really liked the most is that it really does seem to moisturize at</li>
      <li>She also like the easy to grip rubber coated handle as she uses it in the shower</li>
      <li>there didn&amp;#34;t disappoint me so smooth and clean much better than disposable blades</li>
      <li>The razor works fine</li>
      <li>The handle is comfortably contoured and easy to grip.  </li>
      <li>It felt smooth and easy.</li>
      <li>Fine, just over priced for a shaver (they all are)</li>
      <li>The width is fine - wider and it might not get around the bones so smoothly.  </li>
      <li>Overall she is very satisfied with this product and would recommend it to you!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I used this razor yeas back when I got a coupon for it free. I&#x27;m kinda cheap when it comes to razors, so ditched it after a while. After butchering my legs using cheap disposable ones and borrowing my husbands&#x27;s razor which would give me bad razor burn, I gave this one another try. It gives and extremely close shave, no nicks, comes with a cute holder for the shower and Amazon has by far the best price around. This sells for $15.00 or more at local stores.</li>
    <li> I love this razor.  A friend convinced me to try it.  I have tried every other razor I could find in the stores and every type of shaving cream/gel for years and every single time I shaved my legs, they itched like crazy afterwards.  I tried lots of different things after shaving too, and they still itched.  Ever since I got this razor, my legs don&#x27;t itch at all!  I&#x27;m so happy :) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Also, the shave is really close.  If I shaved early in the morning, by late that afternoon, it would feel like I needed to shave again.  With this razor, my legs feel smooth for a couple of days.  You can still see the hair starting to grow back the next day (really pale skin, dark hair), but they feel smooth.  I shaved 4 days ago and it looks like I shaved two days ago.  This razor is great!</li>
    <li> Now there are so many women&#x27;s razors in the marketplace.  I needed a new one so I got this because it had the lowest price.  I was disappointed because although it cuts close, it tends to leave razor burn if you don&#x27;t use shave cream or lather.  I had been using the Venus Embrace in the past but left it behind on a trip.  This isn&#x27;t nearly as comfortable to use.</li>
    <li> Love it! I had always been a 2-blade disposable razor person, but I got the Schick Quattro for Christmas last year, and it is AMAZING. I will probably never buy disposables again!&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve heard/read that this razor will nick you like crazy, don&#x27;t believe it. Those people weren&#x27;t using it right and were probably pressing against their skin too hard. Use it gently!&lt;br /&gt;Also, for future reference, the men&#x27;s Schick Quattro refills do indeed fit the women&#x27;s handle, so you can buy men&#x27;s blades if they&#x27;re cheaper. I&#x27;ve tried it myself!</li>
    <li> If you like to bleed from several cuts when you get out of the shower this razor is for you!  My legs sting all over after using this, ouch!</li>
    <li> This razor can be found for a cheaper price at Walmart. It has a great weight to it, and is more environmentally friendly than disposable plastic razors. The four blades provide a more substantial, comfortable shave. Additionally, there is a thin metal wire guard to prevent nicks, which works wonderfully.</li>
    <li> my daughters like it but it&#x27;s not the greatest</li>
    <li> I was never a shaver.  In fact, the most I ever did was trim, but I wanted to try going hair-free in my bikini area without the pain and cost of waxing.  I did some research and came up with many good reviews on the Schick Quattro for Women High Performance Razor.  I bought it and tried it, and there is NO GOING BACK for me! It leaves me feeling smooth and sexy, and I have never experienced bumps or ingrown hairs.  I did experience one cut the very first time I used it, but that was due to my own inexperience on how to handle the razor.  I learned to BE GENTLE the next time around and have not had any cuts since then.  I also shave under my arms and the results are great there, too!  I recommend this razor for newbies, so try it out and see how it goes, but be careful!  :)</li>
    <li> I really love this razor. It lets me skip days in between shaving because it is so smooth and cuts so close. My only complete is the price. I really wish someone would make a really good razor whose refills aren&#x27;t in the above $10 range. I try to use the blades as long as possible to save some money. For me, this is the best razor out there.</li>
    <li> I was first attracted to this razor because of the microfine wires around the blades, making it less likely to nick the skin.  After using it, I am so impressed with the closeness of the shave that the four blades give!  I used to use the Schick Silk Effects (also with the microfine wires but only two blades), but the Quattro is much better.  I also like the rubber pad in front of the blades--it makes the hairs stand up before the blades cut them.  The handle is comfortably contoured and easy to grip.  The metal and rubber construction gives a solid feel to the razor.  My only beef is the width of the razor head, which is too small in my opinion and therefore requires more strokes to complete shaving.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife since she needed a new razor and I heard two women at the store talking about this.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It makes other razors seem like toys. Seriously, pick up the Venus and pick up this. It&#x27;s no comparison. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She loves the metal handle and the shave is smooth and quick. I&#x27;ve even used it in a pinch a few times...please don&#x27;t tell her :)</li>
    <li> I too thought the Gillette 3 was great until I tried the quattro for women.  The width is fine - wider and it might not get around the bones so smoothly.  No nicks or cuts.  I&#x27;ve been using the blade for a couple of weeks now and it&#x27;s still super sharp and easy to shave.  Underarms and legs - I love it!</li>
    <li> I was very eager to try out my Schick Quattro.  I got a bit tired of the gummy Venus handle and thought I&#x27;d venture out for a more hefty handle.  That, and I have sensitive skin so I&#x27;m always in search for a razor that won&#x27;t give me razor burn. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As I suspected, the handle was much better.  I was happy.  So then I shaved.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I will never use this razor again.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;While shaving it did not smoothly glide over my skin. This should have been a dead give-a-way, but still I was not deterred I kept shaving.  When I got out of the shower, my legs were COVERED with nicks.  It&#x27;s as if the razor little bits of my skin off!  I guess there is such a thing as too close?  I have not gotten this many nicks since I last used a single blade disposable.  My skin is a bit dry because of the winter, but my Venus does not do this to me.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I am DEFINITELY going back to the Venus.</li>
    <li> Had this for years.. literally 5+ years so I finally bought another one. This razor lasts forever!!</li>
    <li> I have never used a razor, even the cheap disposable ones that worked so poorly. The blades are to far back with plastic surrounding them to reach close to your legs, causing you to have stubble immediatly. Not to mention that the head pops off every other swipe, thank god the blades are to back to actually cut you as the head pops off. I used the mens schick 5 hyrdo first and it worked great, don&#x27;t know exactly why I tried this one, I think I liked the color. I even went as far as to write the company!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d only ever used the Gillette equivalents, but wound up with one of these instead and I like it better - the main reason - it&#x27;s heavier &amp; more substantial.  Otherwise the triple edge razor &amp; quality of the shave seems the same.</li>
    <li> I read so many reviews about this razor, unfortunately mine was not as good. After a nano second use, the razor was already clogged and it was impossible to get the few hairs out.  Was expecting much more. Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had so many razors...electric razors, one use razors, venus razors, every razor.  I tried this razor because it looked feminine but sturdy, came with a case and didn&#x27;t look like it would cut my skin. Before the Schick, I had many cuts on my legs because i&#x27;m such a brute, but with this razor i&#x27;ve never cut my legs.  I would spend whatever cost for my schick razor.  It does the job without the scabs.</li>
    <li> I have always  love schick blades this is the first time i tried the quattro and there didn&amp;#34;t disappoint me so smooth and clean much better than disposable blades</li>
    <li> This razor is amazing.  If you are questioning buying this at all, try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me start off by saying I&#x27;m a 20-something female with a serious hair phobia.  I hate having hair anywhere on my body.  I shave every single day to get rid of my thick, black hair.  I also have extremely sensitive skin.  It dries out easily and hates being shaved daily.  I&#x27;m also allergic to many products with perfumes in them including soap or soap strips on other razors.  I was apprehensive about using this razor because it&#x27;s the same one my 60 year old mother uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using some form of Venus for the past 10+ years for my razor.  This puts any of those razors to shame.  The shave is SO much closer and my skin is so silky.  With my Venus razorheads, I was changing them every 2 weeks because I shave so often and they dulled out so quickly.  I would also end up with little nicks all over my body.  I tried Bic Soleil for a while but they changed the razor and I had to quit using that one too.  The first time I tried this razor, I expected much of the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I started shaving with it, I was surprised at how awesome the handle was.  It didn&#x27;t feel like the cheap plastic razor heads I&#x27;m used to.  I&#x27;m used to these giant Venus soap strips covering my legs with goo, and I realized this wasn&#x27;t like that at all.  The razor just glided over my skin without leaving any residue.  I don&#x27;t even soap up my legs usually, I just go with the water and it was fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After my first shave, I checked over my body.  Not a single nick.  And my skin was so incredibly soft and smooth.  I decided I would see if the box read true when it says I won&#x27;t have to shave every day; I usually get stubble within a matter of hours after shaving my legs, but it has been 2 days now and I can barely feel the beginning of stubble coming in.  It&#x27;s also excellent on the more sensitive areas of a woman&#x27;s body.  Again, not one single cut and extremely smooth skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;min awe of this product.  I thought I was doomed to get the same old razor I&#x27;ve been using.  I was seriously beginning to save up money for laser hair removal because I was so frustrated with the same little bumps all over my bikini line and on my thighs.  It&#x27;s embarrassing having ingrown hairs again and again, and looking like you didn&#x27;t even shave that day when you really did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I see with this razor is that I&#x27;m used to the head being wider to cover a larger area, but with the time and money I&#x27;m saving by only shaving every other day now I don&#x27;t really care.  This thing is awesome.  Seriously, give it a try...you&#x27;ll love it too.</li>
    <li> Reading magazines in the tub alerts me to all the personal care products I&#x27;d love to try. This particular razor was featured with a few other razors and sounded like the ultimate razor for women. Well, it honestly is superior to anything I&#x27;ve tried so far and it is the first four-blade razor to touch my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, you really can skip a day here and there due to the supremely close shave. The smooth lime moisture strip helps the blades to slide gracefully over your most delicate skin and there are four tiny strips of wire over the blades that create a protective environment. The artistically designed fuchsia rubber grip on the metal handle (the weight is still light, but heavy enough to make it more stable) encourages precise control and it doesn&#x27;t slip out of your hand. The shower hanger is a true bonus and attaches easily to the shower wall with a suction cup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This item has one razor, one shower hanger and an extra blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results: Smoother legs than ever before! Lasts at least two days. No cuts or razor irritation. No scraping feeling&lt;br /&gt;across your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comfort: Superior comfort while shaving. Slides over knees with ease and never irritates sensitive skin. This razor glides across your skin like silk on satin and truly delivers on its high performance guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review</li>
    <li> The blades are too far recessed behind the moisture strips and didn&#x27;t shave nearly as close as my old Gillette razor. The package doesn&#x27;t deliver on the promise to go \\&quot;a day or two\\&quot; without needing to shave again, as id didn&#x27;t shave close the first time!</li>
    <li> Works good but not worth the money.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this razor! I don&#x27;t want anything that vibrates or is hydro whatever...I want a good durable sturdy razor that doesn&#x27;t leave me with t.p. all over my legs when I&#x27;m finished! This is exactly what I received with this product! Like I said...\\&quot;I LOVE IT\\&quot; Would recommend it to any woman who wants a good razor! My legs were silky smooth and stayed that way for a couple days!</li>
    <li> the electric shaver i have just doesn&#x27;t cut it. literally. i&#x27;ve used nair before, but all i got was an allergic rash from it. waxing just hurts...and other razors never picked up the short hairs that refused to be cut. the schick quattro left my legs smooth safely and effectively. no ugly red bumps and no irritation. i recommend this product wholeheartedly.</li>
    <li> I have searched for the past year to find a replacement for my Bic Soleil razors (not the new ones that cut you, the old version that gave the best shave). I have difficult hair and I don&#x27;t like to have stubble after 2 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor did not cut it for me. I heard from my girlfriend that a lot of women use men&#x27;s razors now for a closer shave than these overpriced gimmicks. I have started using men&#x27;s razors and the shave is definitely closer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although my blue razor is not as pretty, I love the shave I get and the money I save everytime I buy them!</li>
    <li> Shaves smooth and is built very well. I love the chrome metal feel to it, makes it a bit heavier than normal razors and has a good grip. Best part about it is that you can refill it. Schick is my #1 brand for razors.</li>
    <li> After more than a decade of using an original Venus razor, I tried this one out.&lt;br /&gt;The handle is very unusual for a women&#x27;s razor because much of it is metal. While I have had no problems with it rusting, this makes it much heavier than the light plastic handles that are on many other razors. I am not particularly strong, and I had no trouble with this in terms of maneuverability. I actually preferred the weight once I got used to it because the body of the razor is heavier than the head, which made it easier to hold on to in the shower. I didn&#x27;t drop it as often as my Venus... although when I did, it sure makes one heck of a clatter. (It&#x27;ll wake you up in the morning, for sure.)&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, the flaw of this razor is that the blades are too close together. This may be alright if you have very fine hair or are only going over short stubble, but hair builds up between them very quickly and is a pain to wash out. My shower pressure is often not enough to rinse the hair out, and even under a sink or bath faucet it takes a while to get all the hair out completely.&lt;br /&gt;I find this very annoying, because when hair gets stuck in a razor it makes it unusable until you can clear it. Not to mention that any hair stuck shortens the life of the razor because it dulls the blades and makes them more likely to corrode. The blades do not need to be so close in order to get a &amp;#34;close shave.&amp;#34; In fact, this is more likely to just push the hair down and I have often needed to go over areas a few times.&lt;br /&gt;This is a nice &amp;#34;back up&amp;#34; razor that I keep in my favourite travel bag (because this is the one thing I forget the most), but it&#x27;s not for me for regular use. It&#x27;s too much of a hassle.</li>
    <li> You know, I resisted buying this razor. I had the Mach 3 and I thought it was pretty great...but then I liked the pink color of this one so I bought it. I just LOVE it. It provides a close and smooth shave and no nicks at all. It&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
    <li> My husband bought this for me.  It has been wonderful.  Very smooth and it last for about 3 weeks before changing blades.</li>
    <li> Summer is almost here - time to get rid of hairy legs that have been hiding in stockings for months! A friend told me about this razor so I decided to try it cos I&#x27;m tired of using disposable razors that leave my skin dry and for some reason, I always manage to cut myself. I really liked the packaging on this product, the pink and orange and love the idea of the papaya and pearl. Sounds fragrant and luxurious. I used the razor to shave my rather hairy legs. It really felt good - the handle is very comfortable to hold as you go up and down your legs. It felt smooth and easy. What I really liked the most is that it really does seem to moisturize at it shaves which is very different from other razors I&#x27;ve tried. I usually put lotion on my skin after shaving cos it feels so dry, but with this razor there was no need to do that. Time saver, money saver. Really cool. The package comes with a nifty razor holder saving razor going AWOL between shaves, and a spare blade. I would recommend this product, it is really lovely.</li>
    <li> I have no idea what you ladies are doing to shave where this razor doesnt shave legs well?  I share mine with my two teen daughters, probably not recommended, but we do anyway.  We each shave every other day, we keep the blade clean and dry when not in use and use just regular soap (Zest) foamy on our legs while we shower. All this and I change the razor every couple months. I say we go through a four blade package once a year. We have very smooth legs, no stubble or razor burn, and I only change the blade that often for sanitation. We have used this and other Shick razors exclusively for nearly 10 years and I have owned maybe 5 or 6 handles that whole time. It lasts forever and for the price of anything else, even disposables that used to nick me or slice my ankles, knees, etc everytime I feel this is nearly free for how much it costs vs. the flawless use we have for 3 people over such an extended period of time.  Nothing is made like this anymore. Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Product was actually blue not pink I kind of wished it was pink ..but the product was OK.  No protection against razor bumps</li>
    <li> This razor is too heavy, difficult to hold, especially when you have soap in your hands.  And the shave isn&#x27;t close so it feels like a waste of time.  Going back to my Preserve razor.</li>
    <li> Worst razor I&#x27;ve ever experienced in my 28 years of life. This couldn&#x27;t cut a spider&#x27;s web!  Every angle, every way - NEVER does a good job.</li>
    <li> I tried using it and is was by far the worst razor I have ever used!!! It took me 45 minutes to shave my legs because it wouldn&#x27;t cut the hairs no matter if I shaved up or down or side to side. I still have stubble on my legs because I gave up after 45 minutes of trying. Worst razor ever</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this type of wire wrapped razor for a number of years. The four blade version is the best of those. Before this type of blade came along I had to use chemical depilatories, very harsh, but the unshield blades were worse.</li>
    <li> I have tried the others...Venus, Soleil, etc. and was using disposables when I thought it might be a better investment to buy a real razor and just replace the heads.  I chose the Schick Quattro because of the overall great reviews I read on various websites.  It did not disappoint!  A close shave, super soft smooth legs, no cuts or scrapes or drying feeling like it was grating my skin off.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I personally didn&#x27;t like, the shave is closer with those $1 disposable razors (seriously!). I have to shave every single day if I used this. Will not be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> This is a nice razor.  It has a solid feel and very well balanced and easy to hold and use.</li>
    <li> my daughter-in-law uses this razor and needed a new one.  i ordered this along with a refill pack of blades.</li>
    <li> I used to be a huge fan of the Quattro razor. I had used one for several years and loved it--I very rarely nicked myself, and I could never say that about other razors. I recently had to replace the handle, and I discovered that it had been redesigned. I have to hold it very awkwardly to keep it from sliding out of my hand, and I never had that problem with the old handle design. It still shaves well, but I&#x27;m shopping for a new razor because I hate the new handle so much. Way to ruin a great product, Schick.</li>
    <li> I was tired of paying out the neck for Venus refills so I decided to give a cheaper brand a try. The Quattro feels good in the hand but it does not give as close a shave as Venus. I can go several days without shaving my armpits before it gets out of hand with Venus, but with the Quattro I had to shave every other day. On the plus side, I had MUCH less skin irritation and hyperpigmentation with the Quattro, but that was probably because it wasn&#x27;t actually getting close to my skin, so that&#x27;s the trade off. So now I have black armpits but no hair. I may alternate between the Quattro and Venus to spare my skin. One thing I will say, the little suction cup holder actually works! First time ever in my life that I&#x27;ve seen a suction cup actually stay up on something without popping off 2 seconds later.</li>
    <li> This razor lasted a long time, I was very impressed. It had a quality feel to it and left me with a very close, smooth shave. I will certainly be purchasing the Schick Quattro for Women again.</li>
    <li> These are great. Soft, smooth, no bumps, shave.</li>
    <li> I have been using the schick Quattro for years and have never ever cut myself with one. The blades last for what seems forever and even when they&#x27;re dull still work really well. I bought one from Amazon and was totally pleased with the speed of delivery and price and that it came in the orange, which I hadn&#x27;t seen at any store before.</li>
    <li> The item shipped when it was supposed to, and it came on time. The razor is easy to hold and works great. What else can I say?</li>
    <li> Great for my skin, lousy for my wallet. I have tried Venus, Intuition, and a number of other pricey razors, and this is the one that&#x27;s my match. I know women who feel the opposite way, so try before you buy a large quantity. This keeps getting more expensive, so I&#x27;ve tried new razors again, but I keep coming back to this.  Other razors cut my skin to ribbons or leave red, itchy bumps.  The blades last much, much longer on hair that&#x27;s &lt; 1mm long. If I need to shave something longer and I have an older blade around, I&#x27;ll swap them. Longer hair takes forever to rinse out, and even then it seems to end the blade, so I keep this to legs and underarms only. It has no problem with corse, thick hair.</li>
    <li> This razor feels nice in your hand, the head moves as you shave, and it gives a nice, close, shave.  I don&#x27;t know if the moisturizing strips really do anything, but the razor works well, feels comfortable to use, and I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> I have used 4 and 5 blade design razors for years and my wife asked me why because she was tired of the style of razors she was using.  I gave her one of my multi-blade razors to try and she loved it so much she had to buy some of these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She likes that the multi-blade design stays sharp and lasts a long time.  It gives her a close shave and the pivoting head helps to follow the contour of her body.  She also like the easy to grip rubber coated handle as she uses it in the shower and she feels like she has good control over the razor to get a good close shave.  The handle is even textured for a better grip with wet hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She likes the conditioning strips that help the razor glide smoothly and prevent irritation.  Overall she is very satisfied with this product and would recommend it to you!</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor because I read great reviews about it and I wanted to try it.   &lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great razor and it works great -- when the head of the razor is actually on.  Every time I shave, the razor falls off the handle at least 2-3 times. It is very inconvenient and dangerous, as it very easily cuts you when this happens.  I constantly find myself searching for the head of my razor in the bottom of my shower.  Whenever I finally finish shaving, my legs are very smooth -- it&#x27;s just not worth the time it takes.  This is not a very good razor and I would never recommend it to anybody.</li>
    <li> I ordered a razor and got what I expected! I think the grip is better than my old one (which, to be fair, was about 5 years old). It came quick as always and with two blades.  I also think the schick quattro is one of the better ones out there, and does a great job which is why i was re-purchasing. so yeah, good stuff.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor about a month ago at a retail store. It came with the razor and an extra blade/head. The razor will not shave the hair off my legs. I have stubble when I get out of the shower. The blades are too far in or too close together, I&#x27;m not sure which. I had used it for a few weeks to make sure it wasn&#x27;t me shaving wrong (?), but I could never get it to work. I even thought maybe it was a bad blade, so I switched to the other one it came with. The only thing I like about this razor is the weight. It feels good when you hold it. I&#x27;m disappointed I spent $8 on this product.</li>
    <li> got this for my step daughter so she wouldn&#x27;t use her husbands razor anymore</li>
    <li> Cant find these in stores anymore... Great deal - Now Im all stocked up on Razors &amp; Refills for MONTHS!</li>
    <li> opened package to find only 1 of the 4 supposed extra blades was in the cartridge!!! you can&#x27;t see till you open it...there were 3 empty slots with NO blades sitting in them...rip off!  someone at the factory is stealing probably.  I didn&#x27;t send back because it&#x27;s such a hassle and I needed the razor right then.  The razor works fine but I paid for 4 extra blades and only got one!</li>
    <li> Why NOT use the best? I am so clumsy I can cut myself with cheap triple blade razors. This works well, the blades don&#x27;t get rusty and last a long time. I am learning that sometimes when I shop cheaper, it&#x27;s more expensive in the long run. Definitely applies to this purchase. I am happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I got hooked on this particular razor a few years ago and it&#x27;s the best one I&#x27;ve found in a long time.  It must be well-designed because I never nick my skin ever which is more than I can say for any razor I&#x27;ve ever used.  This one is fabulous!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a replacement for the Mach III, since the blades are so expensive. After using the Schick Quattro, I can now totally justify the price of Mach III cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the worst razor I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s not a close shave. I had to press down really hard to shave the sides of my shins. It was almost worthless for shaving the bikini area and the other &amp;#34;delicate&amp;#34; areas due you the bulky head. It took three times as long to shave with the Quattro as it does with a Mach III, and did nowhere near as good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle is the only good part of this razor. If you&#x27;re looking to get an easy, close shave, especially in the bikini area, DO NOT BUY THIS.</li>
    <li> Extremely dissatisfied with this product. I have had a Venus razor for years and years. I have a hard time getting the stubborn hairs on my thighs so I thought maybe I would try something new. After hitting the Internet I saw this razor had really great reviews stating that it was the closest shave some people had ever had. Many said it prolonged the periods between shaves since it was that close of a shave. I&#x27;m picked one up straight away and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it. To my chagrin, this was the WORST shave I ever had. It may work for others but I am just expressing my experience. It took me at least 2x as long to shave my legs vs the Venus. And once I was done I still had stubble all over the place! Since it was only the first use I decided to keep using it to see if maybe I could change the way I shave to improve the razors performance. Nope, nothing improved. I just have a feeling this razor can&#x27;t chalk up to the hype.</li>
    <li> This came as pictured and I am excited to start using it. This was my last foray into women&#x27;s razors as I see no reason to not buy men&#x27;s razors for a cheaper price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Schick Quattro for years- it&#x27;s the only razor that gives a super close shave and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin shredded in the process. A few months back I noticed that the refills felt very scratchy against my skin, and they weren&#x27;t doing nearly as good as a job as they always were. I figured I got a bad batch of blades, but after going through a new pack of refills with the same issues I decided to replace the handle. And it&#x27;s totally different. So they changed the design of the handle and the blades at some point. The refill blades will still fit the older handles, but they don&#x27;t sit correctly anymore, and don&#x27;t do a very good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure the new design is as good as the old design, but the refills don&#x27;t scratch the skin and they are back to shaving closely again. I did have to go over several areas of my legs a few times to get them super smooth. And I got nicked, which hasn&#x27;t happened in eons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this is still the best razor out there, in my opinion. I&#x27;m glad I got the new handle.</li>
    <li> I recently received this razor free with a grocery purchase.  I normally use the Gillette Venus, but I figured that I&#x27;d give this one a try anyway.  Unfortunately, it proved to be quite bad compared to my normal razor. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As I was shaving, I kept having to do multiple passes for each area of my leg, just to cut all of the hair there.  Even a dull blade on my regular razor would do a better job!  I rinsed the blade regularly, but it kept getting pretty clogged up with hair.  Eventually, it got so clogged that it just stopped cutting at all, so I ended up having to get my regular razor to finish up. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The only thing that I can say is good about this product is the handle.  It has a nice weight feel, compared to the usual lightweight plastic I use, and the metal/rubber color of silver and dark pink is quite nice.  If only the blade worked properly! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d suggest that you pass on this item.  My guess is that the folks at Schick took a razor blade designed for a man&#x27;s face and thought they could sell it to women just by making it pink.  Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t quite work that way, and it&#x27;s not a surprise that my local grocery store is now giving these away for free!</li>
    <li> If it accidentally drops in the shower it will break.  Too fragile and if the head comes off the attachment is where it usually breaks so you cannot reattach it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had one of these before that came in the mail as a freebie, and once that one got gross and lost, I had to buy another one.  Before I did, I figured I&#x27;d try a couple other brands.  I shouldn&#x27;t have bothered.  No other razor has been so consistently awesome as this one.  I don&#x27;t get any cuts at all and it&#x27;s a good quality handle--solid, of a good weight.  I happened to get their \\&quot;limited edition\\&quot; purple handle, cool, but that&#x27;s all that&#x27;s limited about it.  Seriously never going to another razor as long as this one stays around.</li>
    <li> I honestly will never guy this product again. I have always used the Venus razor, but I decided to try something new. I should have stuck with the Venus Shaver. The blade on the Schick Quattro clogs up instantly and gives a bad shave because of it. The blade also doesn&#x27;t clean well when clogged. I should of stuck with what I was using so I didn&#x27;t waste my money on this product. Don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t give a close enough shave</li>
    <li> Works great and razor lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll start with the positives.....  Lovely handle.  Very feminine and easy to handle.  It has a nice glide to it and really goes nicely over your curves.  I&#x27;ve had problems in the past with razors nicking my knees thanks to not having a flexible end so as to glide nicely.  I used it to shave my legs, underarms and bikini area.  This razor worked wonders on my legs.  As for underarms and bikini area, it seemed to not be able to get a close enough shave. My hair is significantly coarser in those areas while my leg hair is a very minimal amount of light blond hair.  I am not completely blaming it on the razor for that reason.  So I would say if you have a light to moderate amount of hair growth, this may be the perfect razor for you.  If your tackling a little more hair, not so much. So for me, its back to my tried and true depilatory cream but I will be keeping this one for my legs as it didn&#x27;t nick me or give me any razor burn like my old Venus. Lastly, for the quality razor you get for the price, its really not that bad.</li>
    <li> I really love Schick Quattro For Women Razor!&lt;br /&gt;The blades shaves smooth and quickly. I enjoy&lt;br /&gt;my shaving days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Takako Masuda</li>
    <li> Fine, just over priced for a shaver (they all are)</li>
    <li> Finally decided to throw down for a real razor. Wish I had done it sooner. This, my organic shaving cream, organic lotion, and high TC sheets? HEAVEN. Never leaving my bed.</li>
    <li> I had been using the Intuition for years (no shaving foam needed) but the darn thing was so bulky and the razor sat so far from my skin that it was a lost cause after the the first or second use. I decided to switch to the Quattro. I have very fine hair on my legs and under my arms so I have yet to change the blade (2 months of use). I love it, its easy to hold, sits close to the hair and leaves my legs silky smooth.</li>
    <li> IT MAKES HAIR REMOVAL SO EASY NO CUTS CLOSE SHAVE :) K</li>
    <li> I used Gillette Venus shavers for years thinking they were my best option. I knew they had failed me when I temporarily switched to disposables I got on vacation and those disposables gave me a better shave. When I sent my husband to get me some more of those same disposables, he came back with some disposable Schick Quattro razors and I was honestly ecstatic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After being so pleased with the disposable razors, I decided to invest in the this razor with disposable razor heads. The handle is very comfortable and weighted. The rubberized feel of the handle is great and it definitely helps keep the shaver from my carpal tunnel ridden hands. I much more prefer this to the disposable version though I have no idea why Schick thinks as a woman, I need the handle to be &amp;#34;scented.&amp;#34; I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with the chemical scents despite my fragrance allergies but I did get the sensitive skin razors separately. This product comes with two razors.</li>
    <li> These are great! No nicks.</li>
    <li> Really great razor. I like this much better than the Venus razors, even though it is a little heavier. The razor stays sharper longer.</li>
    <li> My old razor was getting grubby and was unable to be cleaned, but I&#x27;d purchased extra blades.  A bit of comparison shopping revealed this razor would use those blades.  That&#x27;s the whole reason I purchased it...that&#x27;s it.  I was pleasantly surprised by how well it was made.  Unlike the other pastel-colored, cheaply-made razors I&#x27;ve come to expect, this one is made of heavy-duty materials and with a simple, efficient hanger.  It isn&#x27;t my husband&#x27;s razor, but, for the first time in my life, it is made just as well.</li>
