    <li> I tried it once and it made my hair super oily. It took me 6 washes to get it out of my hair. As for the results I can&#x27;t tell bcs I won&#x27;t be using it again.</li>
    <li> I purchased my first nickys hair product about 8 months ago VERY reluctantly. I brought the hair grease and used it on my hair every other night because i have dry hair from my highlights, without paying too much attention for results ALOT of my co workers would compliment my hair. I would say REALLY? I didnt do nothing new in style but i have been using the hair grease.My hair dresser who is a domincan said WOW how ur hair grow so fast but i felt like she was over exaggerating. SO! my one year old daughter whose hair would come out bc she was pulling on it, i decided to use it on her. she was BALD with a patch in the middle enough to put a hair clip. After one month AND I MEAN ONE MONTH her hair u can do ponytails with. IM FINALLY ABLE TO PUT PONYTAILS IN MY BABY GIRL&#x27;S HAIR. FYI i tried everything for my babys hair peppermint oil rosemary n all those things and it DIDNT WORK. THIS product works !!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over 2 years and I highly recommend it. It makes my afro style texture soft, shiny and very moisturized. My hair has gotten longer and thicker without breakage.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Nicky&#x27;s Organic hair grow since mid-August; I&#x27;ve been seeing changes to my hair texture. It has a lot more strength and my hair is easier to detangle. I&#x27;ve even recommended the product to my mom and aunt, they also had great things to say about it. And yes it does what it is promised to do. Overall it&#x27;s a great product that enhances your hair growth</li>
    <li> I love this product it my be a little thick but it works well for me on stopping shedding and growth. I just wish it would stay in stock. I have recommended to my family and they love it to. You can&#x27;t beat natural ingredients that work.</li>
    <li> This product is so good it helped my life look better you should this it made my hair beautyful if you try it you be happy</li>

    <li> Paying the amount I paid for this Hair Product was too much for Hair Oil that was very runny oil</li>
    <li> When I first heard NickysOrangicHairGrow I taught to myself and ask would this work.Would it help repair my hair loss &amp; make my hair healty again. So I took a chance and tried, one day I decied to order this product than a week later the product came in early. So I start using the product then after two weeks Ive seen different results than I expected. So I decided to tell my dearest friend Niva to try it so she did the same result came exactly the same. And since my daughter hair had some hair loss I tried and I got same results too. I insist you to buy this product and try it , you&#x27;ll see change in two weeks , it help my hair a lot even my roots. Even Nivia her hair roots was repair &amp; fully healthy by this product. Go buy it &amp; try it you won&#x27;t regret it</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my mom who had been experiencing hair loss/damage since about 2011. She had been a devoted listener to: \\&quot;Radyo Pa Nou\\&quot; &amp; happened to hear Ms. Nicky talk about this great product. So, after about two months, my mom began to notice that her hair looked drastically different. The portion of her hair that was damaged began to re-grow; even her hairstylist was shocked about her progress. My mom is very appreciative &amp; thankful to Ms. Nicky for creating this exceptional hair solution. Needless to say, she will be buying more Nicky&#x27;s Organic Products.</li>
    <li> This product contributed greatly to my hair growth. It helped my hair grow faster and thicker. My daughter uses it to and it helped thicken her thin hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after reading great reviews about it.Unfortunately I was extremely dissappointed in it&#x27;s performance.I did not see new hair growth and it was extremely oily (it took around 4-5 washes to get it all out- and this was what another customer wrote as well). I even tried to ask them numerous times which shampoo they reccommend, but they never returnd my messages.I do NOT reccommend this product.</li>
    <li> This product has only healthy natural ingredients. My hair feels li it did 20 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;Its soft and has more body and shine. I think its thicker too ....i have been using this product for about three weeks.</li>
    <li> My hairline is bald due to a straightening and I hope it will make my hair to grow back again.</li>
    <li> i had gotten this product cause my hair was damage and breaking. two-three weeks later my hair didnt have damages anymore it brings the shine in my hair. i would consider people to get this product if you want longer good health hair</li>
    <li> yes I will recommend people to use this product its no  greasy just make your hair look nice and soft I even use it on my son hair</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say too much cause my mom uses this not me but she seems to like it a lot.</li>
    <li> Works wonders! Happy I found this product. I would recommend this to friends and family. And I would definitely recommend it to you out there on the net</li>
