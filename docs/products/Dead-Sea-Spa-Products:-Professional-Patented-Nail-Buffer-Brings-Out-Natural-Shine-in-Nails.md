      <li>Also try the cuticle oil, it is amazing.</li>
      <li>I liked this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This buffer works just as good as some that cost a lot more.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very cool!</li>
      <li>very easy to use</li>
      <li>Love it, love it!</li>
      <li>and my nails have never looked better.  </li>
      <li>I will be ordering more for stocking stuffers.</li>
      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>They would notice them for sure.  </li>
      <li>When you refill the collar most of it sprays out all of the place.  </li>
      <li>and this is a top quality product.  </li>
      <li>I saw this at the mall, for way more money.  </li>
      <li>glad I did.  </li>
      <li>NOT AS WONDERFUL AS EXPECTED</li>
      <li>So I would say if you have strong nails, give it a try.  </li>
      <li>At first they looked nice and buffed.</li>
      <li>The file works fine.</li>
      <li>Your nails will have a nice gloss, but they will really break or crack easily.</li>
      <li>This is a fantastic product.</li>
      <li>It makes my nails look fabulous even without polish.  </li>
      <li>I purchased this product because it was supposed to be a fantastic buffer.  </li>
      <li>After using all 3 sides my nails are smooth and so shiny that I don&#x27;t even need polish, though I still use polish sometimes because I like the colors.  </li>
      <li>The ridges on my nails are smooth.  </li>
      <li>It has three sides to progressively clean up and buff your nails/cuticles.</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t remove all oils from your fingernails before using, the buffer will wear out quickly like any cheap one.  </li>
      <li>If you are looking for a quick way to clean up your nails, this product is for you.</li>
      <li>Well, you get what you pay for, and I&#x27;d rather pay more for the real product than be gypped by a hoax.</li>
      <li>came quickly and as advertised.</li>
      <li>My nails really come out looking shiny and smooth.  </li>
      <li>Love the clear plastic cover that protects all surfaces</li>
      <li>This one is by far my favorite.</li>
      <li>Who cares right?  </li>
      <li>I have ordered these in the past and I have never been dissapoited, the three polish system works great, and leaves my nails so shiny and neat that I dont need polish.</li>
      <li>and you can buy the cheap one in the drugstore instead, this buffer is heads and tails above the cheap nail buffers.  </li>
      <li>Great for weak nails as being able to smooth the tip allows for manicures to last and nails to grow.</li>
      <li>This inexpensive product does exactly what the $80 combination set sold in the mall kiosk&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>I use vinegar on my nails first.  </li>
      <li>Why pay more for the same results?</li>
      <li>This item works great for nails, but be careful not to overdue the initial buffing.</li>
      <li>I am a man who never would have thought positive thoughts about a product to shine up my nails.  </li>
      <li>However, the other sides that smooth ridges and smooth the nails work</li>
      <li>Really appreciate each side being labeled - use this first, then this, then</li>
      <li>Been using this product for years and will continue to do so as long as they are available!</li>
      <li>The white buffer is the important side, its the whole point of this product.</li>
      <li>Real men don&#x27;t need shiny nails.  </li>
      <li>It does not work very well as a buffer.  </li>
      <li>it works very well.</li>
      <li>For those who are reporting that it wears out too fast</li>
      <li>Same exact file buffer and so easy to use, your nails shine like they had clear polish on them.</li>
      <li>I have had other products work better.  </li>
      <li>It is unbelievable the results from using this on nails to eliminate rough spots and end up with brilliant shine.</li>
      <li>First time I used this my nails looked like they were done by a professional.</li>
      <li>It was ok but not worth the price.</li>
      <li>It was more like half a use.</li>
      <li>I searched for this particular block on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>Made my nails super shiny, I have to keep them short for work and cannot wear polish</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s like a little bit of magic for nails.</li>
      <li>I was bummed I never saw it in stores where I live now, but ecstatic to find it online.  </li>
      <li>it looks like I am wearing clear polish!</li>
      <li>I was given one of these as a gift by my girlfriend&#x27;s young daughter about 10 years ago.  </li>
      <li>When this 8-year old girl did one of my hands for me with it, I was flabbergasted.  </li>
      <li>Like the way my nails shine naturally</li>
      <li>Gives a professional mani in seconds, shines and buffs nails</li>
      <li>I tried this product for about 2 weeks and very quickly the buffing side became just dull.</li>
      <li>You can buy a much cheaper one at your local store and have the same issue.</li>
      <li>like NO other</li>

    <li> The guys at the mall wanna chrge you forty dollars for this and this is a top quality product.  I will be ordering more for stocking stuffers.</li>
    <li> NOT AS WONDERFUL AS EXPECTED</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because it was supposed to be a fantastic buffer.  It does not work very well as a buffer.  However, the other sides that smooth ridges and smooth the nails work well.</li>
    <li> I saw this at the mall, for way more money.  Same exact file buffer and so easy to use, your nails shine like they had clear polish on them.</li>
    <li> This buffer works just as good as some that cost a lot more. Why pay more for the same results? My nails looked shiny when I was done even if I didn&#x27;t use polish.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these with a kit at a mall (lotion, cuticle oil and buffer) 10 years ago.  For those who are reporting that it wears out too fast and you can buy the cheap one in the drugstore instead, this buffer is heads and tails above the cheap nail buffers.  It will last a very long time if you care for it.  You must follow the directions that come with it carefully.  If you don&#x27;t remove all oils from your fingernails before using, the buffer will wear out quickly like any cheap one.  I use vinegar on my nails first.  Also try the cuticle oil, it is amazing.</li>
    <li> I seriously like this nail buffer. I only ever buff my nails, no paint, so I go thru nail buffers a lot. This one is by far my favorite. I&#x27;ve never got the shine on my nails as I have with this one. Great product. Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have use the Dead Sea Spa Nail Buffer for years.  I love this product!  It makes my nails look fabulous even without polish.  It&#x27;s like a little bit of magic for nails.</li>
    <li> the dead sea nail buffer works much better than the other brands of nail buffers that I have used in the past.</li>
    <li> This inexpensive product does exactly what the $80 combination set sold in the mall kiosk&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;The shine for me does last at least a week, and my profession requires a lot of hand washing.</li>
    <li> First time I used this my nails looked like they were done by a professional. The &amp;#34;lines&amp;#34; were removed and the bluff / shine lasted for days.</li>
    <li> I use it once a week.  The ridges on my nails are smooth.  I like the product...it works very well.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for years and will continue to do so as long as they are available! Great for weak nails as being able to smooth the tip allows for manicures to last and nails to grow.</li>
    <li> I have ordered these in the past and I have never been dissapoited, the three polish system works great, and leaves my nails so shiny and neat that I dont need polish.</li>
    <li> I got one of these in a mall years ago and used it until it finally wore out.  I was bummed I never saw it in stores where I live now, but ecstatic to find it online.  This is the BEST nail buffer I have ever used.  After using all 3 sides my nails are smooth and so shiny that I don&#x27;t even need polish, though I still use polish sometimes because I like the colors.  Great product.</li>
    <li> This item works great for nails, but be careful not to overdue the initial buffing. Doing that will thin out your nails. Your nails will have a nice gloss, but they will really break or crack easily.</li>
    <li> This is a great nail buffer.  I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a month now and my nails have never looked better.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This  is a wonderful nail Buffer, my nails shine like i just came form the nail shop</li>
    <li> This product made them worse.  It took a while. At first they looked nice and buffed. But eventually, as they grew, their weakness surfaced and all of my nails are now down to the nub.  The only nail that did not break off is my thumb, which is my strongest nail. So I would say if you have strong nails, give it a try.  If not, stay away.</li>
    <li> I have owned 1 of these prior to this purchase.  Lasted approx 10 years!  DO NOT USE WITH DIRTY or OILY hands!!  Gives a professional mani in seconds, shines and buffs nails like NO other, I do my toes and finger nails.  I used it on my husband&#x27;s left thumb nail..  he was amazed at the difference it made.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product. It is unbelievable the results from using this on nails to eliminate rough spots and end up with brilliant shine.</li>
    <li> My wife loans this product out all the time to her friends and never seems to get them back so it must be a great product. We seem to be stockpiling them now for future handouts...</li>
    <li> I searched for this particular block on Amazon.  I was given one of these as a gift by my girlfriend&#x27;s young daughter about 10 years ago.  I&#x27;m still using it.  I am a man who never would have thought positive thoughts about a product to shine up my nails.  Who cares right?  Real men don&#x27;t need shiny nails.  When this 8-year old girl did one of my hands for me with it, I was flabbergasted.  I immediately realized that it would be beneficial to me when I was dealing with my sales customers.  They would notice them for sure.  The little block they she gave me has lasted 10 years and I am just now thinking of replacing it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very easy to use and doesn&#x27;t take very long to do both hands.  My nails really come out looking shiny and smooth.  It&#x27;s very cool!</li>
    <li> Really appreciate each side being labeled - use this first, then this, then this.  Love the clear plastic cover that protects all surfaces</li>
    <li> This nail buffer rocks! If you are looking for a quick way to clean up your nails, this product is for you. It has three sides to progressively clean up and buff your nails/cuticles. The shine side works like magic! I&#x27;ll definitely be buying another.</li>
    <li> Just got the kit with the buffer included, it really is nice! Made my nails super shiny, I have to keep them short for work and cannot wear polish it looks like I am wearing clear polish!</li>
    <li> Saw this at the mall for $40... so I looked it up on my phone and saw amazon had it for like $5. It took a little too long to be delivered, and after only one use the white buffer side that makes the nails shine wears out. It was more like half a use. One hand the nails are shinier than the other. The white buffer is the important side, its the whole point of this product. Won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
    <li> I got these buffers to replace one that Ive used for about 3 years.  I am very pleased with their performance and feel.  they smell wonderful too!  came quickly and as advertised.</li>
    <li> I placed an order fully expecting to receive the item that was pictured.  Instead, I received an \\&quot;Egyptian Goddess\\&quot; nail buffer - not the patented Dead Spa Nail Buffer that the seller advertised.  Amazon has three sellers for this product; this one was least expensive by far.  Well, you get what you pay for, and I&#x27;d rather pay more for the real product than be gypped by a hoax. Learn from my mistake, and don&#x27;t use this seller!</li>
    <li> I liked this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered also some Citronella spray for an dog anti-bark collar.  What a waste of money.  When you refill the collar most of it sprays out all of the place.  I have used it before and didn&#x27;t like it so I was hesitate about getting it again.  I will just buy the refill  at Petsmart.  It is a different brand and it doesn&#x27;t spray all over the place.</li>
    <li> I tried this product for about 2 weeks and very quickly the buffing side became just dull. You can buy a much cheaper one at your local store and have the same issue. It was ok but not worth the price.</li>
    <li> Looks like you&#x27;ve just stepped out of a nail salon when all you&#x27;ve done is buff your nails!  Love it, love it!</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t give my nails the shine I was hoping for.  I have had other products work better.  I put it in the bathroom draw a little disappointed.</li>
    <li> coming apart,,,not do what I want it to do. I thought that it was like others I saw...no way.  not good.</li>
    <li> MAKES YOUR FINGER NAILS LOOK AS IF THEY HAVE NAIL POLISH ON THEM.  WORKS GREAT FOR TOENAILS AS WELL.  NO NEED TO GET A MANICURE.</li>
    <li> Just didnt like.  Nails didnt stay shiny.  Good seller though.</li>
    <li> I got this in 2010 and it is still working great for me.  It is a little worn out around the edges, but compared to store bought buffers, it lasts 10 times as long.</li>
    <li> Saw this at the mall, thought I would check on Amazon before going back to mall to make a purchase  glad I did.  Love it</li>
    <li> Like the way my nails shine naturally</li>
    <li> You can definitely be free from the nail care places, cause this item, along with the cuticle oil, is all you need to get your nails naturally gorgeous!</li>
    <li> used up quickly not not not not not not not not not not good, bad bad over priced y yuk</li>
    <li> I have used similar products before, but this made my nails shinier than I expected.  Thank you for a good product that works.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these for several years now.  They last a long time and leave the nails looking polished!  Very nice product!</li>
    <li> The file works fine. However, it smells!! I have to keep it in a inconvenient place that doesn&#x27;t stink up the room. I have sprayed it with febreeze and stuck it in a bag with charcoal. It still stinks!</li>
