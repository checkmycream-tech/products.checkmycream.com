      <li>Well worth the money!!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to hold and works well.</li>
      <li>Gets the job done and easy to hold.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and works well.</li>
      <li>Never had a pumice stone work so easily on my feet.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to carry when you travel.</li>
      <li>But as I said: it does the job, it&#x27;s really light and the ergonomics make it really easy to use</li>
      <li>This product does work fine, but it says that it is pumice</li>
      <li>Great pumice stone - shape is easy to grasp and maneuver around the heel and stubborn calloused areas of my big toes.  </li>
      <li>The unique shape allows you to use it comfortably and easily.</li>
      <li>It keeps my feet and my hands really really smooth.</li>
      <li>A minute or two on each foot in the shower each day leaves them smooth.  </li>
      <li>I been using for almost a week now &amp; so far so good.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very nice for getting all of the heel stuff off, especially, but also works on the rest of your foot.  </li>
      <li>I so very highly recommend this!!</li>
      <li>I was dissapointed when I first opened the package because the product was as light as air.  </li>
      <li>Does exactly what you need it to!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s actually quite an ingenious design and makes foot scrubbing easy and not awkward.</li>
      <li>I wish they were more natural though.</li>
      <li>The price is right, but I will not purchase again and will probably buy a different kind well before this one needs replacing.</li>
      <li>Price is just right</li>
      <li>Helps keep my hubby feet smooth very nice but not for thin skin</li>
      <li>Nice product, really works live soft feet</li>
      <li>So, no fault of the company at all, just my own for not really understanding what I was buying.</li>
      <li>This is exactly what I needed.  </li>
      <li>i love all the different angles it gives you.</li>
      <li>I also enjoy the angles much more than the typical pumice stone.</li>
      <li>As it turns out I am now in love with the pumice and use it all the time dry.</li>
      <li>Works great to remove dry rough skin.  </li>
      <li>So much easier to use than pumice stone on a handle.  </li>
      <li>it really helps to make it easier to use.</li>
      <li>This is so much easier to hold and use.</li>
      <li>They can&#x27;t cut you like real stone pumices can.</li>
      <li>I cannot really compare it to anything else as I havent used anything else.</li>
      <li>It weighs about as much as a feather and is plastic.</li>
      <li>This product is much lighter than any pumice stone I have used before.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t really thrill him though.</li>
      <li>Works great, but like all pumice stones seems less and less effective after even minimal use.</li>
      <li>I have build up on just one foot because I lean more to one side than the other.  </li>
      <li>Very happy with the results after only only a few uses!</li>
      <li>Buy this inexpensive little piece of magic.</li>
      <li>They gently smooth out my rough heels.</li>
      <li>and I can actually feel things with my feet, needless to say he was pretty happy with the results too.</li>
      <li>I assumed this would be the same, however it is significantly more rough grained.</li>
      <li>I love all the different angles on it because when you&#x27;re going at one foot with a different hand you tend to hold it differently depending on the angle of your foot and hand.  </li>
      <li>The first one I bought in Body Shop store, but later I can not find it at store.</li>
      <li>Feet are finally back to normal thanks to this.</li>
      <li>, I even ran to my fiancée after using it (he has a foot fetish) and showed him like look theyre soft</li>
      <li>and it made my feet so soft</li>
      <li>Just used this and my feet feel soft without feeling abused.</li>
      <li>Well worth the minimal cost!&lt;br</li>
      <li>2 months in using it nearly ever day and no regrets!</li>
      <li>After years of using rectangular thin stones this is most pleasurable to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<li> I didn&#x27;t think it would last very long.  </li>
<li> You cannot use it on rough skin because it hurts too much,and you can only use it with lots of soap and water or it does nothing.</li>
<li> I read reviews for other products but this was the only one that jumped out at me.</li>
<li> The only bad thing about this pumice is that my dog love it too.</li>
<li> Could never live without it.</li>
<li> Does it leave little blue bits on your hands, feet, and tub?</li>
<li> This thing does the job, but I expected a chunk of stone and this is not that.</li>
<li> The angles are helpful to focus on the rough spots.</li>
<li> Be careful to rinse it off your hands and feet before you use your soap or it will ingrain itself in there.</li>
<li> This pumice bar is what I expected; works as it should.</li>
<li> He likes these rough stones to use on his heels or whatnot else.</li>
<li> The particles do come off as you&#x27;re scrubbing your feet, but that is to be expected.  </li>
<li> I bought this for myself for Christmas, I was destroying my sheets because I HAD such rough feet.</li>
<li> I have had a few pumices that look the same, but are made by a German company-very hard to find.</li>
<li> I have hardwood floors in my apartment which make my heels and the sides of my big toes really rough and hard.</li>
<li> You can hold it in several different positions depending on whether you&#x27;re scrubbing your heels, the big stupid callous next to the big toe, or wherever.  </li>
<li> When this one wears down, I will probably buy another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
<li> However, after using it 4-5 times I am finding these less and less.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I adore this pumice stone. I have bought several. It keeps my feet and my hands really really smooth. I work out a lot so I have callouses on my hands and my feet. The only bad thing about this pumice is that my dog love it too. If I leave it on the floor of the shower he chews it up. But I guess thats not it&#x27;s fault. I would totally recommend this to anyone seeking softer feet!</li>
    <li> Helps keep my hubby feet smooth very nice but not for thin skin</li>
    <li> These pumices are wonderful. They can&#x27;t cut you like real stone pumices can. I wish they were more natural though.</li>
    <li> This product works well with the smoothig pumice product on my feet.</li>
    <li> I have had a few pumices that look the same, but are made by a German company-very hard to find. I assumed this would be the same, however it is significantly more rough grained. OK, but probably would not purchase again</li>
    <li> Gets the job done and easy to hold.  So much easier to use than pumice stone on a handle.  Made my skin softer after just one use!</li>
    <li> This is 3rd one I got. The first one I bought in Body Shop store, but later I can not find it at store. It&#x27;s easy to use and works well. It&#x27;s better than the stone style pumice at market. It&#x27;s easy to carry when you travel. I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> Works great. Lasts forever.</li>
    <li> Does it do the job? Yes. Does it leave little blue bits on your hands, feet, and tub? Yes! It has helped my feet, but I have blue bits every where when I use it. The price is right, but I will not purchase again and will probably buy a different kind well before this one needs replacing.</li>
    <li> The shape is conducive to the job. After years of using rectangular thin stones this is most pleasurable to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything advertised in my conclusion</li>
    <li> Great pumice stone - shape is easy to grasp and maneuver around the heel and stubborn calloused areas of my big toes.  Very happy with the results after only only a few uses!</li>
    <li> My husband wasn&#x27;t too impressed with this. He likes these rough stones to use on his heels or whatnot else. It didn&#x27;t really thrill him though. We have found better products elsewhere.</li>
    <li> The absolute best foot scrubber I have ever used! Well worth the minimal cost!&lt;br /&gt; However, it must be followed up with lotion to maintain smoothness.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what you need it to!</li>
    <li> Just used this and my feet feel soft without feeling abused. I would buy this again. Price is just right</li>
    <li> Nice product, really works live soft feet</li>
    <li> Works great, but like all pumice stones seems less and less effective after even minimal use. I prefer the Peppermint pumice foot scrub.</li>
    <li> This thing does the job, but I expected a chunk of stone and this is not that. So, no fault of the company at all, just my own for not really understanding what I was buying. But as I said: it does the job, it&#x27;s really light and the ergonomics make it really easy to use</li>
    <li> Feet are finally back to normal thanks to this.</li>
    <li> Never had a pumice stone work so easily on my feet. Love it.</li>
    <li> Cheapest possible pumice &amp;#34;stone&amp;#34; ever made. It&#x27;s like one molecule away from being a sponge.</li>
    <li> This product is much lighter than any pumice stone I have used before. Also, it floats which is a nice feature if you accidentally drop it in a bubble bath. After the first couple of times using it there were small blue pieces particles that had rubbed off that were left in the bath tub. However, after using it 4-5 times I am finding these less and less. I also enjoy the angles much more than the typical pumice stone.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I needed.  It works great!  If anything happened to mine, I would buy another.</li>
    <li> I love this foot scrubber!  At first I was confused by the weird shape, but there&#x27;s a method to the madness.  You can hold it in several different positions depending on whether you&#x27;re scrubbing your heels, the big stupid callous next to the big toe, or wherever.  It&#x27;s actually quite an ingenious design and makes foot scrubbing easy and not awkward.</li>
    <li> This is the best! I have tried many others and none of them work as well as the one from the body shop!</li>
    <li> I love this pumice. I cannot really compare it to anything else as I havent used anything else. I bought this for myself for Christmas, I was destroying my sheets because I HAD such rough feet. I read reviews for other products but this was the only one that jumped out at me. I have hardwood floors in my apartment which make my heels and the sides of my big toes really rough and hard. I used this just ONCE and it made my feet so soft, I even ran to my fiancée after using it (he has a foot fetish) and showed him like look theyre soft and I can actually feel things with my feet, needless to say he was pretty happy with the results too. If you buy this get some ultra healing lotion to use after the pumice for excellent results! I so very highly recommend this!!</li>
    <li> Works as advertised, though leaves tiny pieces of grit on hands, feet, surfaces during and after use.</li>
    <li> Best pumice I have ever owned! The unique shape allows you to use it comfortably and easily.</li>
    <li> This product does work fine, but it says that it is pumice and I do not think that it is. It seems to be made out of some hard plastic styrofoam. So the name/ description is somewhat misleading. I thought it would be a piece of pumice; though the blue color should&#x27;ve been a clue. It weighs about as much as a feather and is plastic.</li>
    <li> Of all the pumice stones I&#x27;ve tried, these are my favorite.  They gently smooth out my rough heels.</li>
    <li> This pumice stone works well and the angled edges are nice. If you&#x27;re looking for a basic pumice stone, you can find one cheaper at your local drugstore.</li>
    <li> This item is just as described. It is shaped to give you a great hand hold on it.</li>
    <li> Not only does this scrub my foot, ever-so-gently, but this pumice stone has not diminished in size since I&#x27;ve started to use it! 2 months in using it nearly ever day and no regrets!</li>
    <li> Callous No More&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works... taking off all the &amp;#34;Rough Stuff&amp;#34; after my run!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had another brand that seemed to last longer, was not purchased from Amazon, though. This pumice bar is what I expected; works as it should. I always have one in the shower, since I started using this type about 7 years ago. They are wonderful.</li>
    <li> I have build up on just one foot because I lean more to one side than the other.  This doesn&#x27;t discriminate.  I love all the different angles on it because when you&#x27;re going at one foot with a different hand you tend to hold it differently depending on the angle of your foot and hand.  It&#x27;s very nice for getting all of the heel stuff off, especially, but also works on the rest of your foot.  It&#x27;s really nice, I like it a lot.  When this one wears down, I will probably buy another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a note: the pumice does come off and it will get all over your hands, etc.  Be careful to rinse it off your hands and feet before you use your soap or it will ingrain itself in there.</li>
    <li> Nothing takes summer time NYC flip flop funk off your feet like this thing. Could never live without it. TMI, I know. But someone has to say it. Buy this inexpensive little piece of magic. It softens and cleans amazingly.</li>
    <li> I was dissapointed when I first opened the package because the product was as light as air.  I didn&#x27;t think it would last very long.  As it turns out I am now in love with the pumice and use it all the time dry.</li>
    <li> I been using for almost a week now &amp; so far so good.</li>
    <li> This works great on my feet in the tub. It&#x27;s easy to hold and works well. However, my only complaint is that as I use it, little blue granules fall off into the tub and make the bath uncomfortable to be in. I just save it for last though.</li>
    <li> Love this and works great. Will never buy a little square pumice stone again. This is so much easier to hold and use.</li>
    <li> I have horrible summer sandal feet and this is taking care of that.  The particles do come off as you&#x27;re scrubbing your feet, but that is to be expected.  It happens with the pumice the ladies at the salon use too!</li>
    <li> This works well! Using it on my husbands foot for a crack. On mine too! Well worth the money!! It fits both my hands and my husbands hands great! The angles are helpful to focus on the rough spots. Cleans with soap and water.</li>
    <li> Best pumice ever. i love all the different angles it gives you. it really helps to make it easier to use. You don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re missing till you give this one a try</li>
    <li> This is horrible. It is made from styrofoam. It is very rough and painful to use and only minimally addresses calluses.  You cannot use it on rough skin because it hurts too much,and you can only use it with lots of soap and water or it does nothing.</li>
    <li> Works great to remove dry rough skin.  A minute or two on each foot in the shower each day leaves them smooth.  I use moderate pressure.  My feet have never looked or felt better.</li>
    <li> Better than Mr Pumice IMO.</li>
