      <li>Well, this Skin79 VIP Gold is FANTASTIC!!  </li>
      <li>and I love it!</li>
      <li>love the product!</li>
      <li>This stuff is really amazing.</li>

      <li>It honestly had an air brush like quality to it.</li>
      <li>love this product in general-it matches my skin color and good product to use for skin care.</li>
      <li>, it just takes a couple minutes before it becomes your own skin tone.</li>
      <li>* Something else to consider with this is that it&#x27;s really effective on any reddish areas you may have.  </li>
      <li>and it is nice and creamy and blends well.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how many products I&#x27;ve used that the product is good, but the smell is so overwhelming...</li>
      <li>I love, love, loves this bb cream!</li>
      <li>So far so great!</li>
      <li>Then it settles into skin (many nourishing ingredients in this!) and looks fantastic.  </li>
      <li>BB cream is BEAUTIFUL on mature skin!!  </li>
      <li>Just another huge plus about this product!  </li>
      <li>Of all the foundations I&#x27;ve used over the years, THIS cream cancels out red beautifully!  </li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>So glad I didn&#x27;t lay on my pillow case or couch.</li>
      <li>and I absolutely love it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>so I do use a pressed foundation as well on top.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s safe for your skin than using the unsealed and used cosmetic by someone</li>
      <li>and I wasn’t sure if it would match my skin complexion.</li>
      <li>1 pump is more than enough.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>did purchase this through ebay, but I thought more reviews might help people who are still on the fence on which one would be better for them.</li>
      <li>I love this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Have received many compliments on now lovely my skin looks.  </li>
      <li>match it, ok,</li>
      <li>This one make my already oily skin feel even more oily.</li>
      <li>I have a redish complection (german redhead) and this blends in the best for me.  </li>
      <li>It still makes me oily, which is okay since I have oil blotting sheets.</li>
      <li>It just makes my skin look like itself, but better.</li>
      <li>love the way it blends in after I put it on.</li>
      <li>was more in this bottle.</li>
      <li>It is okay.</li>
      <li>I love this-</li>
      <li>Both authentic.</li>
      <li>I love this BB cream.</li>
      <li>This being said while I do love this SKIN 79 BB cream it is a couple shades lighter than my skin</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more the consistency of a medium coverage foundation.  </li>
      <li>I tried them and didn&#x27;t know which one would be better for what I wanted out of it.</li>
      <li>It does even out my skin tone for sure,</li>
      <li>however it&#x27;s lovely.</li>
      <li>The product itself was okay</li>
      <li>Most of them said something under the lines of.</li>
      <li>The gold controled my oil better than anything I have ever tried.</li>
      <li>Even though this comes out with a greyish  cast, it changed into the perfect color shortly after application.</li>
      <li>I blended a bit more w/ a sponge &amp; VOILA&#x3D;</li>
      <li>it is 100% authentic.</li>
      <li>I just wish they made it for more diverse skin tones so everyone could enjoy it~!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Oh and no horrible fragrance!</li>
      <li>i love it, the hint of fragrance, the coverage.&lt;br /&gt;used</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This looks good at first but doesn&#x27;t last very long and by the end of the day I don&#x27;t look like I have much makeup on anymore. I like that it has the SPF25 and it is nice and creamy and blends well. The color is very gray though and I HAVE to use bronzer with it or I would look like a ghost.</li>
    <li> I HATE buying this product from this seller... Because it Leaked and made my purse have BB cream all over inside&lt;br /&gt;I love this product in general-it matches my skin color and good product to use for skin care. But...&lt;br /&gt;The seller sucks!&lt;br /&gt;The bottle I received from the seller doesn&#x27;t work. The pushdown button to get the cream doesn&#x27;t work. I had it in my purse and...the top of the botton came loose and had bb cream all over my coach purse!! It was such a pain in the ass to clean up my purse!!!! So be aware people!&lt;br /&gt;So I contacted the seller via emails and received responses about giving me refund about it..so I was like, fine, ok. But guess what? Then I never heard anything back from the seller ever again!!! Oh man! I wish I could just sue the seller for selling inferior products and get compensated for my purse!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good product BUT get a it from a different seller!</li>
    <li> Seems to be a little dry and colorless.  Have tried other brands and this is probably third on the list of five products.  It was also the most expensive of the five.</li>
    <li> I had ordered samples of the gold and the pink from the Skin79 company. (Big mistake. It took 2 weeks before they even started to ship it to me, then it was just 2 small samples in an empty envelope. No reciept of sale, no invoice, no thank you. Very unprofessional.) I liked both of the samples but the gold seemed to work the best for me. It covers great and feels very light, like I have nothing on at all. The pink did not look as natural nor did it wear as well for me. The Gold BB creams color worked perfectly for me also. I have light skin with blond hair and blue eyes. Even though this comes out with a greyish  cast, it changed into the perfect color shortly after application. I also have very oily skin. With or without make-up I have to blot in the afternoon to stop the greasy feeling and control shine. The gold controled my oil better than anything I have ever tried. I am not oily at all now. No shine what-so-ever. Not only do I no longer need to blot, but my skin is still matte when I go to wash my face before bed! It does not dry out my skin either. It covers my imperfections and pores wonderfully. I may need to dab a little more on to cover my pink nose though. I do set it after application with rice powder and it doesn&#x27;t look like I have anything on at all. It stays where it is supposed to and does not transfer onto things it shouldn&#x27;t (like my boyfriends shirt.) It does not melt off in the heat either and it is in the 100&#x27;s where I live in California, so the sunscreen protection of 25 is also great. I do want to try the new orange BB cream that skin 79 has out because the SPF is 50 on that one. Perfect for a day in the sun! Also, Seoulglamour was awesome. Their product was genuine and not a knock off. They shipped it promptly and the price of the product and shipping was great. They included a cute little note and also a free sample of the Missha brand BB cream which I thought was very nice of them. I will definately be ordering from them again! Thank youSeoulglamour for your excellent customer service.</li>
    <li> The product itself was okay but it ran out very quickly since when it arrived to me the bottle itself was sticky with the bb cream on the outside.</li>
    <li> I have been so excited to try this product for the longest time, but i think this is more for oily skin... As I have very dry skin, it broke me out right away.. I just wish I could use it but I can&#x27;t. However, it is light and it might look great on others, just not me.</li>
    <li> My wife has bought this product to try it out and she is very happy with it, telling me that will buy again.&lt;br /&gt;The shipping time might be longer than one would expect for todays standards but keeping in mind where the product is coming from is not bad. Would recomend to anyone</li>
    <li> Very light on the skin but covers very well, didn&#x27;t cause any breakout (given I also have a Mia2 by Clearsonic) kinda grey on skin. It matched my lower face (cheek, chin, nose and neck I guess) but could see the difference on my forehead ( I think the edges of my forehead is a tad darker then the rest of my face). Felt like moisturizer. I think it has made my skin more white but don&#x27;t see a difference in wrinkles. I am only 21 though so don&#x27;t really have any wrinkles in the first place.</li>
    <li> my go-to BB cream.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the skin79 gold plus for about 3 years now since I ran out of the oriental gold (used that for 2 years) and then the price raised on the oriental gold so I switched to the gold plus.&lt;br /&gt;this clears up my skin and protects me from crazy arizona sun (seriously, the other day, my entire body was burnt except for my face!)&lt;br /&gt; i&#x27;m a yellow-toned, tans-easily, white person. (which is why i need this stuff, white people makeup is pink toned)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m one of those people who cannot stand the feel of foundation on my face.&lt;br /&gt;I have dry skin that is sensitive, so when I tried this I was satisfied and it made&lt;br /&gt;my face feel good. It is dewy and spreads on like a wonderful cream. I just wish&lt;br /&gt;there was more in this bottle. I actually took the thing apart and the tube is super&lt;br /&gt;tiny, but it seems to go a long way as long as my teenage daughter doesn&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> This is the best foundation I have ever used.  I am fair completed and the color fits my skin tone exactly.  I order before half is gone because it does take some time to ship and receive and I never want to be without it,</li>
    <li> Superior coverage with the added benefit of great moisturizing and SPF protection.  Evens out my complexion and beautifully covers slight pigmentation issues and flaws.  Have received many compliments on now lovely my skin looks.  Love this product and highly recommend it to others.  Reasonably priced, yet high quality product.</li>
    <li> This one is amazing, even better than the hot pink one! It also shipped super fast, got in less then a week! It feels wonderful on your skin, this bb cream feels like you are wearing nothing and it has good coverage it is very build-able! It is pretty pale though but it oxidizes a bit but I am pretty pale anyways so it fits me well! I love Asian bb creams so much more than the American bb creams! Great product. :)</li>
    <li> I purchased this product before from different seller. It&#x27;s was totally excellent.  Then I try ordered again from this seller. What I received... a damaged, dirty item look like some used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Return?. You have to pay for oversee postage cost ( it&#x27;s not cheap at all). I&#x27;d rather throw it away. It&#x27;s safe for your skin than using the unsealed and used cosmetic by someone you don&#x27;t know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Beware of this seller. Waste your money. I wish I had read the negative rating before....</li>
    <li> Unfortuanetly the Gold Super Plus was too light for my skin tone.  It&#x27;s also not as easy to blend as the skin 79 hot pink version-- which I assume is due to the higher SPF (which is a plus if you&#x27;re looking for that).  I had to go back to the hot pink version, though, the color matches my skin tone better and doesn&#x27;t leave me looking as pale as the Gold version did.</li>
    <li> I have dry skin with redness. My biggest problem with foundation type products is that usually products with decent coverage stick to my dry patches. This bb cream does not have that problem. It glides over dry skin, making it less noticeable. It has decent lasting power (7-8 hours without powder) and gives light to medium coverage. It initially looks a bit pale for my skin, but oxidizes to the perfect color within 15 minutes. The color is slightly grey, yet still looks very natural. The color is really good for people with cool undertones, because the shade doesn&#x27;t accentuate redness like a pink foundation does, yet doesn&#x27;t look unnatural and orange like one with warm undertones does. One bottle lasts a decent amount of time. It smells faintly of spf, but the smell goes away after a few minutes. Overall, this is the best face makeup product I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;ve repurchased it several times.</li>
    <li> I purchased this from package_go_fast. I actually have ordered the pink and gold from them. Both authentic. I love this BB cream. Great coverage. My skin looks great. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I bought this hoping it would help with my oily skin, but it didn&#x27;t do anything but make it shinier.  It does not matify at all.</li>
    <li> Product came earlier than expected. It&#x27;s good to use.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really light on the skin which is great since my skin is pretty sensitive.  This is suppose to moisturize you skin while you use it so unfortunately on some parts of my skin it feels a tad bit oily because of that feature, so if you have a combination of oily and dry skin watch out for that. Overall I think it covers well and is worth what you spend on it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this stuff for years now. It&#x27;s wonderful. It sits well on my face, and it&#x27;s not greasy, and I feel like it&#x27;s actually been good for my skin. I most certainly recommend it! I just wish they made it for more diverse skin tones so everyone could enjoy it~!</li>
    <li> I use this wonderful cream along with the new liquid Bare Minerals in a deeper tone----love the texture on my skin but do need to darken it some as by itself it is too pale for my already even paler skin.  Great value.</li>
    <li> This goes out to K-Beauty seller ^^ I loved the product, and K-Beauty shipped it and in two days, I repeat, two days it was at my door! No rush delivery or anything! :) The product they sent me was a legitimate and authentic Skin79 product, and was perfect. My only bit isn&#x27;t with the seller but the product itself, the product can&#x27;t put up with sweating too well. Today wasn&#x27;t terribly hot but I sweated a bit while in a hot room, and lightly touched my hand against my forehead and saw some of the product on my hand! :o Other than that however it&#x27;s lovely. Don&#x27;t freak out when it goes on your skin by the way, it will come out more of a gray cream colour, however, it blends into your skin after awhile looking more natural. It truly moisturized my face and left it a soft supple hue, so I&#x27;m very happy with the product, and the seller. Thanks again K-Beauty :*</li>
    <li> This stuff is really amazing. My skin looks so pure and gorgeous when I wear it. I&#x27;ve always struggled with cystic acne and have been using benzoyl peroxide gel for the past few years, and this bb doesn&#x27;t interfere with its effectiveness. It also never clogs my pores or breaks me out. I&#x27;d feel comfortable sleeping in it and I couldn&#x27;t say that about much else!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the way it blends in after I put it on. It looks very light/gray on me (I have light skin), and within a minute it&#x27;s perfect. I have both the gold and pink varieties, and I love them both.</li>
    <li> I purchased mine from Seoulglamour, and first thing I have to say is it is 100% authentic. I also have purchased directly from Skin79 website, so it&#x27;s very easy for me to compare and be assured of authenticity. I also purchased the try-out kit, and would highly recommend anyone starting out to get the try-out kit so you can pick the one you like best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I don&#x27;t see how you can go wrong with the VIP Gold, it&#x27;s fabulous! It&#x27;s on the thicker side, some of the others like the light pink and the pearl are on the thinner consistency. I had no problem with the greyish cast, they do oxidize and blend right into your skin tone. Anyone who&#x27;s ever use Josie Maran foundation, it looks totally white in the bottle, but the moment you start working it over your skin it literally becomes your own skin tone? Well, BB cream is similar to that, it just takes a couple minutes before it becomes your own skin tone. BB Cream literally becomes like a second skin, which is what I love. I have combination skin, and other products were too drying or too oily, always just a mess to deal with, but BB Cream is a joy! And it stays alllllll day long! Even in Texas 100+ heat, if I perspire I just dab my face with a paper towel &amp; the BB Cream stays put! Try that with a liquid foundation!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and no horrible fragrance! I can&#x27;t tell you how many products I&#x27;ve used that the product is good, but the smell is so overwhelming... I mean WHY do manufactures insist on perfuming the daylights out of their products? Very glad to say, Skin79 does NOT do this. Very slight smell to the product, for which I am SO grateful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor and check out the various videos on YouTube showing exactly how to apply BB Creams, and pick up one here on Amazon from Seoulglamour!</li>
    <li> Just dont know if it is real! The box seems a little bit shabby</li>
    <li> OK, so I wasn&#x27;t quite sure what to think of this stuff, but, as a true beauty product junkie, I was willing to try. I am always skeptical of something that claims to serve as an all in one wonder product, but this doesn&#x27;t disappoint.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived much earlier than expected, and no damage, which is always good.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for about 2 weeks now, and my skin has never looked so good. Now, let me clarify that I have not replaced all my other skin care products for just this alone. I still use a serum and a moisturizer under this, but I can definitely tell the difference this has made in my overall skin tone and texture. It gives amazing coverage, and you can&#x27;t even tell you are wearing anything! I am in love, and, for the price, I think you would be hard put to find something better.</li>
    <li> I am new to the BB creams or any type of make up that is more than a pressed powder. Since I was getting annoyed with my freckles/sun spots, I wanted to get something that will cover it up. I have never applied foundation myself nor have I ever owned one. So after all the research I made online, I went to Sephora to test these products out. It felt awful on my hand! I can only imagine that I would hate life if I used it everyday! I have used foundation, just never applied it myself. I asked someone in there for some advice and she suggested some BB creams. I tried them and didn&#x27;t know which one would be better for what I wanted out of it. So I went back online and did my research. After ALL the reviews I&#x27;ve read, I decided to take a chance on Skin79 brand. This was one of them that I bought and I love it! This is I think medium and not at all full, like what people have reviewed. In order to get Full coverage, you have to add a layer or until you are satisfied. In the beginning, it scared me. As my face looked really pale, however I did wait (after reading reviews on giving it time to oxidize), it blended on my skin. I then use the Skin79 skin all day sun powder after this and all I can say is WOW. It just makes my skin look like itself, but better. It still makes me oily, which is okay since I have oil blotting sheets. This also doesn&#x27;t make your pores noticeable unlike the Triple functions (orange) one. I think when spring/summer/sunnier days hit, I will have to probably add a higher spf sunscreen that I used to use. After 8+ hours of this, all I do is blot the excess oil and maybe use the sun powder again and I am good to go. I love this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it does take some getting used to applying this. This is the first cosmetic item that own and use that is liquid based. Previous to this, I was only using pressed powders. I needed something with a bit more coverage, which is okay for sensitive skin (I have extremely sensitive skin), anti-aging and makes skin better. My dark spots/freckles seem to be lighter with this on. I really haven&#x27;t noticed a big difference without this on yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did purchase this through ebay, but I thought more reviews might help people who are still on the fence on which one would be better for them. I used to use Prescriptives pressed powder #2. If you can see that shade online, that is what I used to use. I also have combination skin, oily t-zone and some parts are dry. I hope this helps!</li>
    <li> Thax to the other reviewers, who stated-the &amp;#34;clay-like&amp;#34; appearance was a shock @ first- I blended a bit more w/ a sponge &amp; VOILA&#x3D; a beautiful result.  It&#x27;s just enough coverage to blur flaws, but my skin tone is still me &amp; not as cakey/thick as regular foundation.  The price was right,too. I recomend this product!</li>
    <li> I love this- it&#x27;s moisturizing with a sheer to medium coverage- makes my skin feel super soft and dewey- my holy grail BB cream</li>
    <li> I really love BB creams especially the asian ones because they&#x27;re so much better than the ones made here in the U.S. This being said while I do love this SKIN 79 BB cream it is a couple shades lighter than my skin so I have to mix either a little bit of foundation in it or a little bit of my Mac tinted moisturizer in it. I&#x27;m NC40 and it does adjust to my skin a little but to get a better match I still have to mix in stuff. Luckily in the winter time i&#x27;m lighter so I really have to do that as much.</li>
    <li> Love this product, even though shipping time is fairly long, the product arrived in great conditon, no complaints from me.</li>
    <li> So far so great! Purchased from Seoulglamour because of their 99% positive feedback. Only BB cream that has mattified my skin without drying it out. Replaces my foundation even with my acne scarred skin. All I need is a little bit of concealer for my under eyes and a few pigmented spots on my cheeks, which I know this cream is also helping diminish. I haven&#x27;t even finished up my first bottle but I&#x27;ve already ordered a second one so I don&#x27;t run out!</li>
    <li> okey. i&#x27;m asian. and i finally jumped on the bb cream band wagon. and now i finally understood why all those korean grandmas faces are so white. this cream is not nearly as \\&quot;light\\&quot; as people described. in fact it&#x27;s rather heavy when you first put it on your face, and then your face gets used to it and you don&#x27;t really feel the heaviness anymore. clinique&#x27;s liquid foundation is much lighter in my opinion. and bb cream. there&#x27;s really no \\&quot;secret\\&quot;. it&#x27;s just ultra concentrated liquid foundation. at this price i like it and i will use it, will update to see if it makes me break out. i have normal skin but if something&#x27;s too too oily, i will break out.&lt;br /&gt;------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;update: been using it and my skin hasn&#x27;t broke out yet which is great. i use it with a thin layer of moisturizing lotion first. i find that if i just put it on without it, the cream doesn&#x27;t spread as evenly and leave kind of streak marks on my dry skin. also, when you sweat right after you put foundation on, it&#x27;s not nearly as messy looking but still not a great look. i suggest you use blotting paper around nose area right after putting the cream on. but don&#x27;t rub cause then the cream comes off, just gently dab a little.</li>
    <li> Arrived faster than i expected it to the product work good easy to use&lt;br /&gt;Original package sealed and works great</li>
    <li> I was very relieved after receiving my BB Cream to find that it was an authentic Skin79 product.  I purchased mine from seller Constant Connection, who included a little slip with information and websites to visit that will help you verify the authenticity.  I&#x27;ve only used it once, but so far I like it.  It is definitely thick, especially if you&#x27;re used to American BB creams.  It&#x27;s more the consistency of a medium coverage foundation.  Right out of the bottle, the color is a frightening grey.  Of course, it changes to a natural shade a few minutes after application.  The light floral fragrance also fades quickly.  For me, the color is slightly too dark (I&#x27;m very pale and usually wear neutral ivory shades), but I think if I set it with a lighter powder I&#x27;ll be good.  The finish it provides is smooth and even.  It doesn&#x27;t look or feel heavy to me.  It&#x27;s matte, yet not flat, and makes my large pores less noticeable.  I&#x27;ll try to provide an update in a few weeks about how it performs on improving skin tone.</li>
    <li> I had forgotten about the samples I&#x27;d ordered a year or so ago of the Skin79 BB creams.  Ordered the samples Via Amazon - everything turned out great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve reviewed 2 other BB creams that I&#x27;ve really really liked (Balm Shelter - very good; Mineral Fusion Illuminating Mineral BB - also very good!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I went ahead and ordered this Skin79 VIP Gold BB cream (via eBay) from high-rated seller \\&quot;Never Price\\&quot;.  I received it in record time.  The BB cream is out of Korea, I believe.  This seller tho ships out of NJ.  Well, this Skin79 VIP Gold is FANTASTIC!!  It&#x27;s my go-to for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s.  Have taken very good care of my skin (but not in my youth - I didn&#x27;t use sunscreen near enough - I wasn&#x27;t good to my skin).  Since my 30&#x27;s, tho, I&#x27;ve changed all of that.  I make my own Vit C serum (excellent results - use in a.m. and p.m. before I use any of my serums or lotions).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This BB cream is BEAUTIFUL on mature skin!!  As you read in most reviews, when you first apply it, it&#x27;s not that impressive as far as color goes.  Then it settles into skin (many nourishing ingredients in this!) and looks fantastic.  I&#x27;m actually using it as my foundation.  And I&#x27;m extremely choosey about how my makeup looks.  I actually DO need some coverage, not just something that \\&quot;evens my skin tone\\&quot;.  It does even out my skin tone for sure, but it also provides the much-needed coverage and doesn&#x27;t look \\&quot;cakey\\&quot; at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does so much...  I use a primer (whichever one&#x27;s handy) first, let it sit for 5 or 10 minutes.  Then I apply this VIP Gold BB cream with the Real Techniques \\&quot;beauty blender\\&quot; - it&#x27;s not the Beauty Blender brand, it&#x27;s a better sponge applicator and much more reasonably priced - you can find it under brand REAL TECHNIQUES - I don&#x27;t recall the exact name of it but Amazon carries it.  I run sponge under water for a sec, squeeze out extra moisture by covering sponge in a little towel and squeezing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then apply mostlyby stippling.  I do spread it too, tho, as well as stipple.  The result is beautiful...  And yes, I do have fine lines - like I said, I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s.  And this creates a gorgeous, velvety look.  A natural, fresh look while still providing coverage similar to a cream foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE** Something else to consider with this is that it&#x27;s really effective on any reddish areas you may have.  It&#x27;s almost concealer-like... Of all the foundations I&#x27;ve used over the years, THIS cream cancels out red beautifully!  Just another huge plus about this product!  And it IS buildable so if you have quite a bit of red in any area, you can stipple some of this on, wait a few minutes til it settles in, and then stipple a little more over that area.  Looks good - looks natural while camoflauging flaws!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes I mix a little of any \\&quot;regular\\&quot; foundation into this BB cream.  I want to use up the foundations that are just sitting there.  It works great.  It&#x27;s not necessary, it&#x27;s just something I do when I feel like it.  I keep the ratio about 90% bb cream; 10% regular foundation when mixing product on top of my hand (so it&#x27;s easy access for application).</li>
    <li> Looks great on skin after a few mins blends in perfectly and feels great! i will absolutly purchase again and item came much earlier then exspected. So happy!</li>
    <li> This cream gives a flawless coverage and lasts all day. Beware it looks a bit grey going on but it adjusts to your skin tone.</li>
    <li> Ok. Don&#x27;t understand what all the fuss was about and all the &amp;#34;super&amp;#34; reviews?</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 12 days now and I absolutely love it.&lt;br /&gt;I was hesitant to buy the product because it only comes in one shade and I wasn’t sure if it would match my skin complexion. I have a light medium/tan skin tone; the product is on the light grey side. The product does dry about a shade lighter then my skin tone, but I don’t mind that so much as I top it with a darker power. I have oily acne prone skin &amp; a little bit of scaring. This product has changed my skin in the most awesome way. I have fewer breakouts, my skin feels and looks healthier, it has given me this sort of nourishing glow.&lt;br /&gt;There is not a thing I do not like about this product. Even the bottle itself is great, I love the fact that is has a pump. The product has a thick consistency, it’s very blendable, and you don’t need to use much product, maybe just half a pump. The coverage is very light, your imperfections will not disappear, but they will look very much improved.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried a lot of BB Creams and this product is the only one that has changed my skin. All of the other products say they do this and that, but the SKIN79 Gold is the only BB Cream that I have tried that actually does what it says.&lt;br /&gt;I very much recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love, love, loves this bb cream! It&#x27;s so nice on my skin, I have a combination skin, and had hard time looking for the right product, and this is it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much for making this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jhie@alaska!</li>
    <li> I was really nervous when I purchased this product from Beauty Works because I heard all these dupes going around on Amazon claiming to be authentic. I was incredibly happy that this seller directed all my concerns, and ensured me of authentication.&lt;br /&gt;The product itself delivered beautiful results just like it promised, and a tiny amount really does go a long way. It lasts a long time, and no offensive scent at all. I highly highly recommend buying any product from this seller.&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely buy this product exclusively from this seller</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, I buy it all the time.  I have a redish complection (german redhead) and this blends in the best for me.  I pump it into my palms, rub them together and pat them all over my face and neck, then I gently pat it all together with my finger tips and it is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Do not put powder over this.</li>
    <li> i love it, the hint of fragrance, the coverage.&lt;br /&gt;used both the pink and the diamond, this one is not bad at all~~</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for at least 3 years and it is all the coverage I want. I have slight redness and often blemishes on my cheeks and chins and this covers it up quite well. It does set a little dewy looking, so I usually use a translucent powder on top that way it doesn&#x27;t move around too much. You can layer it on pretty well for a more full coverage but I rarely do so because I just don&#x27;t need it. Using with a stippling brush, your clean fingertips or a beauty blender have all worked out fine for me.</li>
    <li> It is okay. I love the skin79 brand, however I would recommend the pink one over this particular one. This one make my already oily skin feel even more oily. I am always open to trying new bb creams but if I had to choose between the two, I would not buy this again. Coverage is very good, maybe better formula for dryer skin though!</li>
    <li> love the product! don&#x27;t need much for full coverage. 1 pump is more than enough.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t feel like i have dry tight skin half way through the day so i enjoy that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does leave skin with a &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; where I don&#x27;t like looking glossing so I do use a pressed foundation as well on top.</li>
    <li> I LOVEEEEE THIS! finally found a makeup that I don&#x27;t need to retouch every hour. Seriously, this is a must have for me. I just ordered my second one two weeks into the first bottle just to make sure I never have to go without this product. If you have oily skin get this! I top it with cover girls loose powder.</li>
    <li> my first impression when I used it was that didn[t match my skin tone, because I have and olive tinted, but I waited for 10min and it rally match it, ok, its looks paller first, but it works when i put my mineral face powder sand beige from Physician[s Formula. My skin looks great, I almost used it every day from august, and still have it  the same bottle. And people notice it, I  mean, many people ask me about what kind of product I[m wearing, because they like my skin texture and look.  I[m more than happy with it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 22 year old guy. I don&#x27;t like make up that is highly noticable or feels heavy. This product is niether. It honestly had an air brush like quality to it. I did have to use a small amount of loose mineral powder to get rid of some of the sheen it left around my t- zone. I asked several people if they noticed anything about my face. Most of them said something under the lines of. &amp;#34; wow your face looks really good! Your acne seems like it&#x27;s completely cleared up!&amp;#34;. That was a huge self esteem booster for me even though its just temporary that means so much to me after obsessing over my problematic acne prone skin for years. My sister said&amp;#34; That&#x27;s the best make up I&#x27;ve seen on a guy&amp;#34;... she clarafied by saying she meant that with guys it tends to look a little silly when they have incredibly obvious make up on. It&#x27;s a bit of a double standard, but I tend to feel the same way. Just a little of this stuff goes a long way. My only slight &amp;#34;complaint&amp;#34; I guess is I&#x27;m taking a medication that makes me sweat on my forehead so I have to dab it with a paper towel or something and with any amount of moisture this stuff melts off like a popsicle. So glad I didn&#x27;t lay on my pillow case or couch. That&#x27;s not a huge deal to me at all.</li>
