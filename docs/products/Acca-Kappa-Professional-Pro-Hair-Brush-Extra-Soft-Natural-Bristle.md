      <li>Nice quality.</li>
      <li>but, it&#x27;s nice.</li>
      <li>This is a nice brush but just not what I was looking for, hoping for.</li>
      <li>It is also very easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>but you must have very, very, very fine and thinner hair for this brush to work for you.</li>
      <li>I purchased for my wife who has very fine hair</li>
      <li>This is a very good quality brush but the bristles are rather soft.</li>
      <li>and I credit it for helping me grow my hair 3 inches more.</li>
      <li>I love it that it doesn&#x27;t pull on hair but can remove fallen hair.  </li>
      <li>The wood is smooth and nicely sanded.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m quite pleased with this purchase.</li>
      <li>An excellent brush that is essential for fine curly hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve bought several brushes trying to find a good one and this is the best so far.</li>
      <li>This is a very nice brush, soft and easy on the scalp.</li>
      <li>Also, easy to clean/get lose hairs out of it.  </li>
      <li>I have fine hair that breaks easily.</li>
      <li>The description for the brush and the reviews said it was for fine hair.</li>
      <li>It is nice and soft, a very comfortable brush to use with children and adults alike.  </li>
      <li>The Bristles are soft and I can tell that the brush is of good quality when I brush my hair</li>
      <li>She was delighted to find this present amongst her stocking stuffers this year and has really enjoyed using it.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t really know how many stars to give this brush, which was a gift.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an issue that I&#x27;ve experienced with other boar bristle brushes but didn&#x27;t expect from an &amp;#34;extra soft&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>It is soft but not too soft to work great.</li>
      <li>I purchased this to replace another soft natural brush and I am happy with my purcahse.  </li>
      <li>If  you want a very soft brush you will probably love this brush.</li>
      <li>My hair has always been fine and as I have gotten older, it is not as full as it used to be.</li>
      <li>As I had bought many &amp;#34;100%&amp;#34; boar hair brushes from Wal-Mart they still made lots of my hair fall out, nor were they as soft as I wanted.</li>
      <li>As part of my hair growth journey, this brush is a useful tool</li>
      <li>She&#x27;s 86 years old and finds most brushes and combs too abrasive on her scalp.</li>
      <li>But this was nice enough for me to go &amp;</li>
      <li>The shipped was right on time</li>
      <li>The price is more than a typical brush, but I love it and use it all the time since I&#x27;ve gotten it.</li>
      <li>Very soft and works well for fine hair.  </li>
      <li>Too soft bristles to even brush my fine hair.  </li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>It was exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for for years.  </li>
      <li>This brush is exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>and I am glad overall.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not too heavy and it seems of good quality.</li>
      <li>Nice, Brush, not sure it&#x27;s worth $25</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very well made</li>
      <li>As for me, I was expecting something much stiffer.</li>
      <li>This is my nighttime hair brush, I am ready to purchase another one for my purse.  </li>
      <li>This brush is really well made.  </li>
      <li>For people who like more scalp stimulation, they&lt;br /&gt;may want a harder brush.</li>
      <li>really straightens my daughter&#x27;s hair well</li>
      <li>think even shoulder length hair might be a bit too much for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>it is not snatching my hair out and although it is soft, I comb my hair first and then use the brush to stimulate the hair folicles.  </li>
      <li>Bristles nicely placed between stiff and soft - not too much of either.  </li>
      <li>My two main reasons for not liking this brush are that the bristles come out and it snags my hair.</li>
      <li>This hair brush has proven to be very durable - but is very soft as well.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I bought this hair brush for my husband and he loves it--the bristles are soft and gentle on the scalp.</li>
      <li>Brushes are normally like combs or pencils to me...</li>
      <li>I ended up ordering the much more expensive Kent brush and it works fine.</li>
      <li>brushes are very soft as it is described in</li>
      <li>I was looking for a brush that was soft with natural hair bristles, and this was just it!</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s extremely soft.  </li>
      <li>Old ladies all have thinning hair</li>
      <li>It is soft but I was hoping it would be even softer.</li>
      <li>This brush is a bit too soft to go through my hair.</li>
      <li>Too soft to brush through hair.</li>
      <li>Was way too soft, like a baby&#x27;s brush.</li>
      <li>The bristles are like the ones on the old silver grooming sets.</li>
      <li>The bristles were too soft and did not brush through my hair or massage my scalp which helps stimulate hair growth</li>
      <li>Was looking for a soft brush but not so soft that it wouldn&#x27;t do the job.  </li>
      <li>It was completely as described, but it wouldn&#x27;t go through my hair.</li>
      <li>I love this brush because I have such thin hair, and this brush is very gentle for my hair.</li>
      <li>The bristles are soft but not what I would consider &amp;#34;extra soft&amp;#34; or soft enough for a baby.</li>
      <li>Seems like it will last a long time and works really well.  </li>
      <li>The ad says it&#x27;s \\&quot;Extra soft bristle\\&quot;, and that&#x27;s no lie.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is soft enough to not break the hair.</li>
      <li>soft enough for baby hair, I think.  </li>
      <li>But apparently it doesn&#x27;t work that well on hair</li>
      <li>This is extra soft, almost like a baby brush.</li>
      <li>Somehow in reading the description I missed that this was an Extra Soft brush.  </li>
      <li>This one grooms well and is soft enough not to scratch the scalp.</li>
      <li>/&gt;So, in the end...nice brush but make sure your hair isn&#x27;t very long or very thick.</li>

    <li> Great using this as a toddler hairbrush. really straightens my daughter&#x27;s hair well</li>
    <li> It is soft enough to not break the hair. For people who like more scalp stimulation, they&lt;br /&gt;may want a harder brush. It doesn&#x27;t work too well if your hair is long. I cut off 8 inches so&lt;br /&gt;now my hair is just below shoulder lenght, and it works great.</li>
    <li> An excellent brush that is essential for fine curly hair. It&#x27;s very well made and I&#x27;m quite pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed in this brush.  Somehow in reading the description I missed that this was an Extra Soft brush.  I have been trying to replace a beloved Fuller Brush.  This is a nice brush but just not what I was looking for, hoping for.</li>

    <li> This brush is well made, and it is advertised as \\&quot;extra soft bristle\\&quot;, but unfortunately the bristles are so soft that they won&#x27;t comb my hair.</li>
    <li> I purchased for my wife who has very fine hair and this does not pull or snag. Great!</li>
    <li> This brush is exactly what I wanted. I read all the reviews and decided to purchase this brush. It is soft but not too soft to work great.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair brush for my husband and he loves it--the bristles are soft and gentle on the scalp.</li>
    <li> I have thinning hair which I have started to cut very short.  The bristles in my  older brush were too stiff and scratched my scalp.  This one grooms well and is soft enough not to scratch the scalp.</li>
    <li> The brush was a gift.  It was exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for for years.  I decided to grow a beard after Christmas and it even works well on the beard!</li>
    <li> Very soft and works well for fine hair.  Would not use on wet hair.  Nice quality.</li>
    <li> This brush is a bit too soft to go through my hair. My hair is slightly coarse and that might be why.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t a bad brush. The wood is smooth and nicely sanded. The bristles are soft but not what I would consider &amp;#34;extra soft&amp;#34; or soft enough for a baby. My two main reasons for not liking this brush are that the bristles come out and it snags my hair. I have other boar bristle brushes, including a Kent brush, so I expected a few bristles to fall out during the first use. However, with this brush, one or two bristles fall out with each use--not what I expected of a moderately priced brush. The bristle fall doesn&#x27;t speak well to the longevity of the brush. The bigger issue that I have with this brush is that it snags my hair. Every time I brush, I can actually hear strands of my hair break, which is not what one would expect from an &amp;#34;extra soft&amp;#34; brush. It&#x27;s an issue that I&#x27;ve experienced with other boar bristle brushes but didn&#x27;t expect from an &amp;#34;extra soft&amp;#34; brush. I think I will try goat&#x27;s hair next.</li>
    <li> VERY nice brush!  Almost a work of art given the wood quality.  Bristles nicely placed between stiff and soft - not too much of either.  Made in Italy (or mine was).  Brushes are normally like combs or pencils to me... I don&#x27;t give them a second&#x27;s thought.  But this was nice enough for me to go &amp;#34;Dang!&amp;#34; when I opened the package.</li>
    <li> This hair brush has proven to be very durable - but is very soft as well.  I have sensitive skin and have found other brushes to be too abrasive.  Doesn&#x27;t scratch the scalp.  Happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> The Bristles are soft and I can tell that the brush is of good quality when I brush my hair it is not snatching my hair out and although it is soft, I comb my hair first and then use the brush to stimulate the hair folicles.  This is my nighttime hair brush, I am ready to purchase another one for my purse.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Our 4 1/2 year old daughter has been complaining about all the brushes she has, even the ones supposedly made for kids, as being too rough and uncomfortable.  She was delighted to find this present amongst her stocking stuffers this year and has really enjoyed using it.  It is nice and soft, a very comfortable brush to use with children and adults alike.  Definitely a like!</li>
    <li> Was looking for a soft brush but not so soft that it wouldn&#x27;t do the job.  This brush is really well made.  Seems like it will last a long time and works really well.  Also, easy to clean/get lose hairs out of it.  Planning to buy another one. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mother-in-law who is in a nursing home. She&#x27;s 86 years old and finds most brushes and combs too abrasive on her scalp. This brush is great. The bristles are like the ones on the old silver grooming sets. It&#x27;s not too heavy and it seems of good quality.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, the bristles are so soft that they wont go thru my hair.  Because of that I would recommend caution when buying this.</li>
    <li> My hair has always been fine and as I have gotten older, it is not as full as it used to be. The description for the brush and the reviews said it was for fine hair. I was very pleased with the look and the construction of the brush. It was completely as described, but it wouldn&#x27;t go through my hair. So...I gave it 5 stars because it was everything the description said it was but you must have very, very, very fine and thinner hair for this brush to work for you.</li>
    <li> My hair is not fine or thin but I like using this brush.  It won&#x27;t brush thru but it will give my hair a fuller bodied look and make it shine.  I love it that it doesn&#x27;t pull on hair but can remove fallen hair.  It is also very easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought one for my 76-yr-old mother.  Old ladies all have thinning hair therefore it&#x27;s good for her.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought several brushes trying to find a good one and this is the best so far.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really know how many stars to give this brush, which was a gift.  There&#x27;s nothing wrong with it if you&#x27;re looking for a brush for a baby or elderly person.  The ad says it&#x27;s \\&quot;Extra soft bristle\\&quot;, and that&#x27;s no lie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s extremely soft.  I thought it might be good for my hair, which is babyfine.  But apparently it doesn&#x27;t work that well on hair that&#x27;s longer than, say, a few inches.  Mine is waist length, and, needless to say, just too much for this brush to handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think even shoulder length hair might be a bit too much for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, in the end...nice brush but make sure your hair isn&#x27;t very long or very thick.</li>
    <li> The bristles were too soft and did not brush through my hair or massage my scalp which helps stimulate hair growth</li>
    <li> Great product it&#x27;s brushes are very soft as it is described in&lt;br /&gt;The description of the brush.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a brush that was soft with natural hair bristles, and this was just it! As I had bought many &amp;#34;100%&amp;#34; boar hair brushes from Wal-Mart they still made lots of my hair fall out, nor were they as soft as I wanted. This is extra soft, almost like a baby brush. The price is more than a typical brush, but I love it and use it all the time since I&#x27;ve gotten it. The shipped was right on time and I am glad overall.</li>
    <li> This is a very good quality brush but the bristles are rather soft. they don&#x27;t work well for my medium length hair. If  you want a very soft brush you will probably love this brush. As for me, I was expecting something much stiffer. I ended up ordering the much more expensive Kent brush and it works fine.</li>
    <li> TOO SOFT FOR THICK HAIR...</li>
    <li> Nice, Brush, not sure it&#x27;s worth $25 but, it&#x27;s nice. It is soft but I was hoping it would be even softer. I only use it on the edges, so it&#x27;s get the job done.</li>
    <li> It was perfect for my picky husband. Now to get him to give up that dirty old one he&#x27;s had for 20 years.</li>
    <li> Bought it as a gift for an elderly woman who requested it.  Arrived in good shape.  Price comparable to others I&#x27;ve seen. Think the recipient likes it.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair that breaks easily. This brush is extra soft and has enabled me to grow my hair around those difficult edges. As part of my hair growth journey, this brush is a useful tool and I credit it for helping me grow my hair 3 inches more.</li>
    <li> The hair brush feels like a baby&#x27;s brush.  Too soft bristles to even brush my fine hair.  Brush is nice looking.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to replace another soft natural brush and I am happy with my purcahse.  I would purchase from Acco again.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice brush, soft and easy on the scalp. If your hair is thin and you find other natural bristle brushes too prickly, this is the brush for you.</li>
    <li> soft enough for baby hair, I think.  Good for me because nylon always felt like poking me.</li>
    <li> Was way too soft, like a baby&#x27;s brush. Totally unworkable. On vacation. On return will send back</li>
    <li> Too soft to brush through hair.</li>
</ol>
