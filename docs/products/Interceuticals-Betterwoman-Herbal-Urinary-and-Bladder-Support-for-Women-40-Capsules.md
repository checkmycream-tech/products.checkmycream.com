    <li> I noticed a difference right away.  This product works great!  I no longer have the problem I did.  This product is amazing!</li>
    <li> Did not seem to work very well. Eli</li>
    <li> It seems to do the job, almost all the time.</li>
    <li> seems to be a little help</li>
    <li> I have received significant results from this product, even when antibiotics given to me by a physician did not help.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and service.</li>

    <li> It didn&#x27;t help my mom in any way.  It&#x27;s possible it could help someone else.</li>
    <li> Has worked for me, although due to the cost, I am unable to take it at the suggested dosage, so results don&#x27;t seem to carry over</li>
    <li> This product did not help my problem at all.. tried it for a month&lt;br /&gt;which is plenty of time for this type of product.</li>
    <li> I have used this product off and on for years, and keep coming back to it, because it works.  I recently tried the Oxytrol patch, which does also work, but I did not like the feel of a patch on me, plus the embarrassment factor around my husband, massage therapist, etc.  The capsules take a couple weeks to start working, but they do work.</li>
    <li> I so wanted this product to be a replacement for my prescription of Detrol…but it didn&#x27;t come through.  It could&#x27;t be different for others, but it left me feeling extremely bloated and with fairly intense stomach cramps.  So sad.</li>
    <li> Great product as described!</li>
    <li> fastdelivery....thanx*****</li>
    <li> Only been on it for 2 bottles. So far there is some change, but I will re-order and do another 2 bottles.</li>
    <li> Performed better than prescription meds. It lasts well and stopped the night time visits to the bathroom. I am sleeping through the night and feel very comfortable throughout the day. The dry mouth and eyes effects have been eliminated as well which is a huge relief.  I am very impressed with this product and will tell my doctor about it. I recommend it highly.</li>
