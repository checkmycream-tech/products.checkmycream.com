<ol>
      <li>Best lip balm.</li>
      <li>Awesome product!!!!  </li>
      <li>These eos are great!</li>
      <li>but it probably great too!</li>
      <li>EOS is the best lip balam on the market!!!</li>
      <li>new update!!!!!!!!</li>
      <li>Smells good and just a great lip</li>
      <li>Excellent Balm!  Smooth and moisturizing.</li>
      <li>wait for more to come out!</li>
      <li>/&gt;They&#x27;re are simply amazing</li>
      <li>Not only do they smell great, but taste great as well.</li>
      <li>I decided to purchase more for me and my girls</li>
      <li>, I love EOS,</li>
      <li>Wanted these 2 &amp; glad</li>
      <li>My favorite is the honeysuckle.</li>
      <li>But this pack I got at Walgreens for 6.00 bucks, much cheaper and the Passion Fruit isn&#x27;t that great.</li>
      <li>there pretty cheap &amp; they work so good, EOSSSSSS</li>
      <li>and I bought them on another website to try to meet a free shipping minimum.  </li>
      <li>special edition!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love the smell so much.</li>
      <li>She loves them both, but says that the Strawberry Sorbet smells so yummy that she just wants to eat it :)</li>
      <li>I think both smell great, although they have more of a generic &amp;#34;fruit&amp;#34; aroma to me than anything specific; granted, I don&#x27;t know what passion flowers are supposed to smell like.  </li>
      <li>It seems like you are wearing nothing but feel so light and really hydrate your lips</li>
      <li>Do not waste your money, this does not smell anything like Passion fruit or Strawberry, more like Plastic &amp; Chemicals.</li>
      <li>love that there are no artificial colors or flavors and that these are made from natural plant oils and extracts.  </li>
      <li>i love the fact that it has all natural ingredients and keeps her lips moist.</li>
      <li>The brand eos is natural and works magic on your lips!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
      <li>and I highly recommended... (between us, even my husband uses them, as much as he wants to deny it!)</li>
      <li>EOS isn&#x27;t even mentioned on the package, so I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;s the real things as it&#x27;s a gift.  </li>
      <li>I have already had the pink one once, so that shows you how much I love it, have tried the purple out</li>
      <li>If you use to much your lips start to peel</li>
      <li>I had always thought these were cute little containers</li>
      <li>can normally find them in pharmacies and groceries stores, but I think these ones are</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s my understanding that the passion flower is one not part of the normal EOS product</li>
      <li>Eos keeps your lips soft and hydrated for hours.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Passion Fruit: Olive Fruit Oil, Beeswax, Coconut Oil, Jojoba Seed Oil, Natural Flavor, Shea Butter, Stevia Leaf/Stem Extract, Tocopherol, Passion Flower Extract, Sunflower Seed Oil, Linalool, Limonene</li>
      <li>/&gt;Strawberry Sorbet: Olive Fruit Oil, Beeswax, Coconut Oil, Jojoba Seed Oil, Natural Flavor, Shea Butter, Stevia Leaf/Stem Extract, Tocopherol, Sunflower Seed Oil, Strawberry Fruit Extract, Limonene, Linalool&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>These were purchased for my 12 year old daughter.</li>
      <li>I did receive them a day early &amp; the lip balms them selves where unopened.</li>
      <li>Overall, I find this to be a quality product and am now interested in exploring the EOS brand further.</li>
      <li>They go on smoothly and, for me at least, they last a long time.  </li>

    <li> Best lip balm. not greasy excess. It seems like you are wearing nothing but feel so light and really hydrate your lips</li>
    <li> My daughter loves EOS!!!!! i love the fact that it has all natural ingredients and keeps her lips moist. Awesome product!!!!  new update!!!!!!!! If you use to much your lips start to peel</li>
    <li> The item arrived looking nothing like the picture shown.  EOS isn&#x27;t even mentioned on the package, so I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;s the real things as it&#x27;s a gift.  A little disappointed at that.</li>
    <li> EOS is the best lip balam on the market!!! But this pack I got at Walgreens for 6.00 bucks, much cheaper and the Passion Fruit isn&#x27;t that great. My favorite is the honeysuckle.</li>
    <li> It does help ! Love the smell so much. I decided to purchase more for me and my girls</li>

    <li> Not only do they smell great, but taste great as well. Eos keeps your lips soft and hydrated for hours.</li>
    <li> Just what my daughter wanted!  Smells good and just a great lip balm!&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t wait for more to come out!</li>
    <li> I had always thought these were cute little containers and I bought them on another website to try to meet a free shipping minimum.  This is a limited edition set and it&#x27;s my understanding that the passion flower is one not part of the normal EOS product line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the ingredients are not listed on the product page, here they are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Passion Fruit: Olive Fruit Oil, Beeswax, Coconut Oil, Jojoba Seed Oil, Natural Flavor, Shea Butter, Stevia Leaf/Stem Extract, Tocopherol, Passion Flower Extract, Sunflower Seed Oil, Linalool, Limonene&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strawberry Sorbet: Olive Fruit Oil, Beeswax, Coconut Oil, Jojoba Seed Oil, Natural Flavor, Shea Butter, Stevia Leaf/Stem Extract, Tocopherol, Sunflower Seed Oil, Strawberry Fruit Extract, Limonene, Linalool&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that there are no artificial colors or flavors and that these are made from natural plant oils and extracts.  They go on smoothly and, for me at least, they last a long time.  I find them moisturizing, as well.  I think both smell great, although they have more of a generic &amp;#34;fruit&amp;#34; aroma to me than anything specific; granted, I don&#x27;t know what passion flowers are supposed to smell like.  Each balm does smell different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also find that I&#x27;m liking that these balms do not twist up (like Chapstick and similar items) to dispense product.  They won&#x27;t break off and get stuck in the lid!  Also, these are unlikely to be forgotten in a pants pocket and go through the wash (I cannot tell you how many times I&#x27;ve done that with traditional Chapstick dispensers) because of the shape.  These would fit in a purse but would probably be inconvenient in a clutch or pocket because of the size (somewhat smaller than a chicken egg).  Overall, I find this to be a quality product and am now interested in exploring the EOS brand further.</li>
    <li> These eos are great! The brand eos is natural and works magic on your lips!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can normally find them in pharmacies and groceries stores, but I think these ones are special edition!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re are simply amazing and I highly recommended... (between us, even my husband uses them, as much as he wants to deny it!)</li>
    <li> Excellent Balm!  Smooth and moisturizing.</li>
    <li> I have already had the pink one once, so that shows you how much I love it, have tried the purple out but it probably great too!</li>
    <li> The product I received looked nothing like the picture.  It was the 2 eos colors advertised in a package that was cut out from a larger package.  This was supposed to be a gift and I couldn&#x27;t use it as one because it looked like I bought a larger package and just cut out 2. Very disappointed in what was advertised vs. what was delivered.</li>
    <li> Wanted these 2 &amp; glad I got em, I love EOS, there pretty cheap &amp; they work so good, EOSSSSSS</li>
    <li> I got the flavors they described. However NOT the package they showed in the description. It was 2 cut out of another package. I did receive them a day early &amp; the lip balms them selves where unopened.</li>
