<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Tweezerman makes great products and this is one of them. An all-in-one product that files my hard nails, then smooths the edges, also flattens ridges and buffs to perfection.</li>
    <li> I have terrible fingernail (probably some deficiency) and after I cut them (they are very thick and grow back quickly), I use this to remove the rough edges, then I used the different parts to remove the ugly lines I have on my finger nail then buff them until they shine.  It does not replace a manicure unless you&#x27;re like me and can&#x27;t afford the time or the money.  I keep one in my purse, one near my computer keyboard and another in the bathroom.</li>
    <li> Great for a buffed manicure!</li>
    <li> I like the shape and ergonomics of this file. I will say I&#x27;m not sure all of the surfaces provide that super shiny, &amp;#34;glass-like&amp;#34; finish that I got with the other larger, 7 sided file I had. This one is more durable and ergonomic, though.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome file.  Not having ever used a \\&quot;real\\&quot; nail file, I found the Tweezerman tool worked fantastically.  I plan on ordering additional ones so I have a good supply.</li>
    <li> I got this nail file to help my son get rid of his warts, but now I can&#x27;t stop using it! You are supposed to rub warts with a nail file then but the acid bandaides on them. But after seeing how great it is, with 6 different pads I&#x27;m keeping it for myself and will get another one for him. It has 6 different pads, it tells you which sides are for which on the website. It&#x27;s also pretty cheap, and free shipping which is a bonus in my book. I&#x27;m so in love with the tweezerman company, they really stand behind their products. All nailfiles wear out after a while, in fact I got another nail file wet and it fell apart. I washed this with hot water and anti bacterial soap, and it&#x27;s holding up great. I will probably buy another one.</li>
    <li> Perfect price and when I&#x27;m done using all six sides my nails look and feel professionally done.</li>
    <li> Received Shape and Shine Nail Tool a few days after ordering it. Just what I expected it would be...packaged and not damaged. Great tool to have and to take traveling. I will recommend Tweezeman to all who see my tool. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Nice all in one for travel.</li>
    <li> good product. many functions in one nifty looking file.  bought it for girlfriend . she liked it.</li>
    <li> This is a good multitool that makes it exceptionally easy to manicure nails.  I&#x27;m not a big fan of the white file as it&#x27;s a little too rough for my nails, but the 5 remaining sides are perfect.  I bet the white side would be perfect for filing thicker nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The surfacing side makes it easy to polish to a sheen, and it&#x27;s got a pointy end for cleaning under the nail if you&#x27;re into that kind of thing.</li>
    <li> I have always loved tweezerman brand, their products really are worth the money. My only tip is to BE CAREFUL about using the white side which is the roughest sand paper on your nails (should be okay on toes) but it will file your nails down to paper thin and your nails will break super easy and will be really sensitive and overall just not good. Once I learned not to use the white one my nails look amazing and I have not had any issues, I love this nail tool :)</li>
    <li> I like this tool but I understand the other reviewers when they said its for longer nails. I usually leave my nails a bit long but last week decided to cut them down and now I am limited on my use of this tool, when they grow back I guess I will be happy again.</li>
    <li> Besides being bulky, which already covered in other reviews, there are only two out of six surfaces that I usually use and once one of the sides is no longer sharp, I have to buy a replacement.</li>
    <li> At first, I&#x27;m writing under my father&#x27;s name. I really should say this product works very well. I only used the pink, white &amp; grey part ... it gives a very nice results.. I highly recomended</li>
    <li> I use this all the time. I&#x27;ve had it for about a month and it&#x27;s not worn out. I tried several products that lost their &amp;#34;grit&amp;#34; after one use. This is a good one.</li>
    <li> This practical nail tool does a great job.  It&#x27;s handy, does all it says it will do, and does each of the jobs well.  I think you&#x27;ll find it was a great price for a nifty nail tool.</li>
    <li> This nail tool is very ergonomic and durable.  I put little effort using it.  I don&#x27;t know exactly what it is -- prob because the core is heavier and denser in material than the average nail tool?  A regular emery board and a buffer that shaped like a spongy block one would probably require 5 strokes or so.  With this one, 2 strokes will do the job.  On top of that, it lasts so much longer.  It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
    <li> Best file I have ever used! Works wonderfully, and sometimes I even use the side 1 to file my nails instead of a normal emory board or diamond file. I found it is easiest to use all the sides in the correct order if you mark them with a sharpie. A little on the pricey side, but if you wash it every once and a while it will last forever and works great!</li>
    <li> Disclaimer: I have naturally tough nails.  I have been looking for a good nail file that will last me longer than a year for quite some time now.  Unfortunately, this one did not beat the one-year mark.  My nails have already worn two sides down to the point of unusability, and I can&#x27;t shape with the buffers.  Good product for the casual self-manicurist, but not a long-term deal.</li>
    <li> I never buffed my nails before in my life. I assumed it was a marketing trick of the cosmetic industry, something that they liked to tell people that they needed to do, but was something the consumer really didn&#x27;t need. And, after all, I kept my nails trimmed &amp; filed short every week. I thought I knew how to do a beautiful simple manicure on my minimalist hands. But I was wrong. BUFFING IS AN ESSENTIAL STEP IN MAKING YOUR MANICURE LAST LONGER, LIKE THE BEST PROFESSIONALS DO IT! I&#x27;m not shouting, merely emphasizing how much it changed my mindset to utilize this tool. When I do wear polish after properly buffing my nails, the manicure lasts for 7-10 days without touch-ups of either color or top coat. Previously, I would do my nails on a Sunday, then touch it up w/ color on Wednesday, and top coat on Friday. By the next Sunday, the manicure had definitely seen better days, my nails were starting to peel, and snags might start as well. Buffing has not only made manicures last longer, but stopped the lifelong peeling of my nails once they hit a certain length (which wasn&#x27;t very long). This astonished me! I&#x27;ve used TIPS nail oil faithfully, a zillion different cuticle balms, every nail polish brand known to mankind, every hardener- they all worked okay, but they only slowed down the peeling process, never eliminating it. Not one purchase over the years made growing &amp; keeping long nails possible for me. Who knew that proper buffing would eliminate such problems? Well, it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say that since I started buffing properly w/ this tool, I actually LOVE the look of my natural nails so much that I don&#x27;t polish them often. If I wanted to wear them long, I finally can do that. My nails are so SHINY &amp; SMOOTH all the time now that they already look like they somehow have a gloss from within, and nothing additional is needed. My nails are as smooth as glass, seriously. People think that I have a nice clear polish on them even when it&#x27;s just my natural nails they&#x27;re looking at. I even had one friend enviously say to me, \\&quot;Oh, you have the most awesome natural nails. You&#x27;re so lucky!\\&quot; Luck has nothing to do w/ it, trust me! They continue to glow for days on end after their weekly buffing. I&#x27;ve actually dropped the weekly polishing, and simply trim, file &amp; buff my nails to perfection. There is no damage done by buffing- just the opposite. It&#x27;s easy to use while watching TV- it&#x27;s hard to mess up, since the tool is so foolproof. I love having gorgeous nails without having to wait on polish to dry, praying that I don&#x27;t bump them against something in the meantime!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have NO clue why someone would claim that this is bulky. What is bulky is the glass fingernail file, glass toenail file, diamond foot file &amp; a separate buffer (the Revlon one, for example, while it works very well, is BIG) that I had to carry in my manicure bag before purchasing this item. Not to mention a cuticle pusher, cuticle balm and/or nail oil, hand cream w/ sunscreen for daytime, rich night cream w/ no sunscreen for use before bed, foot scrub, a pumice stone, a nail brush, foot cream, separate clippers for both fingernails &amp; toenails, base coat, nail polish (I use one color only, but of course many women own much more than that), top coat, nail polish remover &amp; cotton balls or pads to remove nail polish. All right, so this tool doesn&#x27;t include the clippers or other stuff. But anything to cut down on what I need to have on hand, I&#x27;m all for. This little tool contains the three pads that you need for proper buffing on one side, and then on the other end, it includes a tough file, which is terrific for calloused feet- and trust me, I have ragged feet w/o daily filing, so I would tell you if the file is crap. Most tools marketed to smooth callouses are a joke (I&#x27;ve used many, including an expensive but worthless battery-run smoother). The rough white side on this is comparable to my far-more-expensive &amp; quite large Diamencel Tough Buffer, which I love, butthe Tweezerman is more convenient for a quick smoothing day-to-day before I apply foot cream in the a.m. The other files on this side are awesome- one works well for toenails, and the blue one is for fingernails. File in one direction only- don&#x27;t saw back &amp; forth on the nail. Sawing creates peeling &amp; snags in thin nails. A nail cleaner is included on the edge of the buffing side of this tool, which works best on toenails for me. Since my fingernails are short (by choice- I just prefer that my hands stay as sanitary &amp; minimalist as possible), the cleaner isn&#x27;t necessary for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This beats every nail file on the market. I have beautiful glass ones that I loved before I&#x27;d ever used this (and they are very nice), but now I don&#x27;t even use them. And forget about emery boards! This is so far superior that they&#x27;re not even in the same league. I pull out my Diamencel to smooth the bottoms of my feet to perfection each Sunday, still, but that is a far quicker process now that I use the Tweezerman tool daily before slipping on my socks or hosiery. The Tweezerman is great to just hit the roughest areas quickly each morning, so that there&#x27;s no snagging on hose or socks. If you already have natually smooth feet that don&#x27;t callous, you lucky duck, obviously this won&#x27;t apply to you. Using this doesn&#x27;t prevent hangnails. It&#x27;s not a replacement for other care (sunscreen, moisturizing, trimming), but I consider it my \\&quot;desert island\\&quot; tool for nails. I was extremely skeptical when I purchased this, but I&#x27;ve been converted. And the price on this is just spectacular.

This is so far superior that they&#x27;re not even in the same league. I pull out my Diamencel to smooth the bottoms of my feet to perfection each Sunday, still, but that is a far quicker process now that I use the Tweezerman tool daily before slipping on my socks or hosiery. The Tweezerman is great to just hit the roughest areas quickly each morning, so that there&#x27;s no snagging on hose or socks. If you already have natually smooth feet that don&#x27;t callous, you lucky duck, obviously this won&#x27;t apply to you. Using this doesn&#x27;t prevent hangnails. It&#x27;s not a replacement for other care (sunscreen, moisturizing, trimming), but I consider it my \\&quot;desert island\\&quot; tool for nails. I was extremely skeptical when I purchased this, but I&#x27;ve been converted. And the price on this is just spectacular. If you want perfected nails, get this tool ASAP!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s like several nail tools in one very compact form. And, it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do well. I had no problem filing my nails and then polishing them up a bit with this tool. Plus, I was even able to use it on my dog when I went back home (her nails were starting to get pointy and irritating to our skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it for a few weeks I can say it&#x27;s a good general-purpose nail filer that you can use on your hands, feet, or even you dogs&#x27; claws (gently). 5/5</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great having all the tools in one compact piece, and each one is effective, and ergonomically easy to use.  I bought a second one to keep in my travel bag.</li>
    <li> works OK.  I would like to see it noted what each side is for/does.  I don&#x27;t know &#x27;how&#x27; to use each side.</li>
    <li> Nifty little gadget, this \\&quot;shape and shine nail tool.\\&quot; Cute,too, and works like a dream. But I wonder why the same manufacturer provides a sleeve for its cuticle clipper but not for this one; nor do they seem to offer one for purchase separately.  Also, it&#x27;s something of a challenge for imperfect eyes to read the directions, which are in teeny tiny white type on a shiny green background on the piece of cardboard it comes attached to. I&#x27;m copying that info here as much for future reference by myself (so I can read it in less than perfect light and throw away the packaging) as for those of you considering buying this product who&#x27;d like to know what all those different surfaces are to be used for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here goes in the English language version (also appears on card in French, Spanish and German): \\&quot;Shape and Shine Nail Tool--Natural manicure at  your fingertips: Multi-use tool features three filing, two buffing and one polishing surface to shape and shine nails naturally.  Use white, black and blue combination to shape nails.  White for heavy duty filing, black for shaping and blue to smooth edges. Use pink, white, grey combination to smooth, buff and shine.  Pink to smooth nail surface, white to buff and grey to shine. To avoid drying out the nail, do not buff more than once a week. Shine nails as often as desired. Tip of tool can be used to clean under nails.\\&quot; (Not sure what \\&quot;natural\\&quot; means in reference to a nail file, but that&#x27;s a minor nit.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope having that info in more easily readable type helps you as much as it will me.</li>
    <li> Does the job. Only recommendation I would have is to label the different sides. I have to feel with my thumb to know which side to use.</li>
    <li> The buffing surfaces are glued on. After an hour of use, the edges are coming loose. The material on blue surface already has a white patch (rubbed off, not accumulation). Price is not high enough to go through the hassle of returning it. Also you have to destroy the packaging to remove it.</li>
    <li> purchased this for my elderly mother who likes to have nice nails and uses lots of emory boards --- this is excellent, has many different textures and she loves it...</li>
    <li> I was a little confused when I first opened the package until I read the instructions. I find that all the shaping to shining tools combined in one instrument was a neat idea. I didn&#x27;t have to hunt for the other nail things that I needed to complete the job of taking care of my nails. It was easy to use. The instructions were understandable. My nails look great. It did a great job. I will purchase another when I wear out this one.</li>
    <li> I loved all of the different options for nail filing.  Keep away from 2 year olds because they will for sure peel off the sections.</li>
    <li> This is the only nail tool of this type that does what it is supposed to do....and does it very well.  You don&#x27;t have to spend money on the others...this is the one that works.</li>
    <li> I love this tool because it has so many sides to it that it can be used for so many nail issues. It is basically just as described on the packaging. I love the fact that it can sit on a shelf without it rolling off. The weight is perfect. Very well made. It is just great!</li>
    <li> This nail tool is awkward to use on fingernails because of it&#x27;s size. Might work better on toe nails! I definitely won&#x27;t be buying another.</li>
    <li> Love this!!!! Six sides definitely better than 1!! Very well made, and I never leave home without it!</li>
    <li> I must be missing something. So many positive reviews, and I&#x27;m unhappy with this item. The shine tool does NOT shine the nail! I&#x27;ve had to purchase the Revlon shine tool which works great. Why I spent so much on this Tweezerman nail tool, I&#x27;ll never understand. What a letdown!</li>
    <li> What can I say? It&#x27;s Tweezerman. Great range of durable and useful grooming products, and this multi-buffer is no exception. It handles both my nails and toes effortlessly, smoothing out ridges, creating a squared or a rounded nail tip with ease, and buffing to a high shine. Impressive, long-lasting, and professional looking results: my nails look amazing, with or without polish. And I am one who would normally need to spring for professional help. Added plus: this thing is durable- the buffing surface isn&#x27;t going to peel off on you the second time you use it. Also an all-in-one file beats the heck out of finding a bunch of different implements in order to do a thorough job when you have the sudden urge for a mani/pedi.</li>
    <li> Like all Tweezerman that I&#x27;ve used, this is great. Nice design, compact, good seletion of textures. Very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> Great product but only two sides get use and the rest seem to just be a waste !</li>
    <li> I was looking for a simple nail file with multiple levels of grit and this has just that. With 6 levels ranging from pretty rough to super fine it fits every use case that I would have.</li>
    <li> This is my second order. Item works on my toenails and is better than those cheap nail files. Makes easy work of my diabetic tough nails in short time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased a few of these.  Works great!</li>
    <li> I have recently taken of my acrylic nails after 10+ years because I wanted to go natural and avoid all the chemicals. This is all I need to fix my nails. Shapes, buffs, and shines nails to extra smooth finish.</li>
    <li> I have been purchasing this file for a few years and it&#x27;s simply the best! In one file, you have every type of surface, from very coarse to final step of smooth and shine. It is durable and well suited for ladies and gents! This is about the same price as cosmetic stores, though they&#x27;re not easily found/in stock. Not washable, however.</li>
    <li> This is not as shiny as other brands that I have purchased, and the shine definitely does not last long.&lt;br /&gt;I bought 4 to qualify for free shipping, and now I regretted it for buying so many.</li>
    <li> Great for angling and more versatile than the larger one, or even the flat one.  It allows you to get into the sides, and also buff on the top of the nail with the natural angle if need.  I don&#x27;t know why all nail tools aren&#x27;t designed like this.</li>
    <li> These are so durable that this only the second one I&#x27;ve ever had to order. The only drawback is the sides are not clearly labeled.</li>
    <li> Considering the materials with which shapers like this are made, I guess it&#x27;s impossible to expect it will last forever.  It&#x27;s like any sandpaper-ish product...eventually the grit is going to wear off -- just like it did on this product after just a few uses.  The coarsest sides keep their grit pretty well but I hardly use those surfaces since they are TOO coarse for regular (natural) nails.  The finer the grit, the quicker it wears out.</li>
    <li> This is a great tool. You won&#x27;t need any other file/buffer. Does a great job and the surfaces do not peel off. They actually stay on and last. Like that the one tip has a point to clean under nails. I wish I had known about this type of tool decades ago. I didn&#x27;t know one can achieve a smooth nail surface. I am so glad to have found this. I ordered a second to keep at work for breaks.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST manicure tool I have ever used.  Six sides to deal with everything from callouses on your feet to buffing your nails.&lt;br /&gt; I never see these in any drugstores so I was happy to find on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I love this thing. It&#x27;s a great shape and well made. I&#x27;m a fidgety person so with all the different filing and buffing surfaces, I can make my fingernails perfect while I watch a movie</li>
    <li> Tweezerman gives you what you pay for in quality. Easy to use angled filed files. All products are good. Read reviews.</li>
    <li> Its a fantastic product. It does not die after 5 hardcore uses..I used it on 2 males and 5 female hands that needed much TLC and its still going strong!</li>
    <li> Doing your own buffing at home with these is easy. Start with white, give each nail a dozen or so passes, move to pink another dozen or so, move to the black to bring out a nice polish and you are good to go!</li>
    <li> I love the shape and shine tool.  Small price to pay for a manicure and pedicure.  You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> No need to pay for nail care when I can be a DIY.  I am in my garden this time of year and having my own supplies to do my own nail care is what I want and need.  Great price!!</li>
    <li> This product is a work in progress. It was given to a lovely lady that require some assistance in shaping her nails. They do look good, perhaps a little on the steep side, but when presented she was happy. As the instructions explain they have different sides to the tool, so it can be used in different ways. 3.5 Stars.</li>
    <li> I love this thing. Im a dentist and its impt to keep the nails in good shape and this helps big time</li>
    <li> This is the best nail file on the market! I wasn&#x27;t ready to switch from my traditional nail file, so my daughter bought one of these for me as a gift. I&#x27;ll never buy another style file again and I now have several of these (nightstand, bathroom, desk at work). Don&#x27;t be fooled and waste your money on the cheaper imitations, though. I tried one of the cheap imported ones that look similar, but costs half as much, and had to immediately throw it out. (The file part was too far from the edge and you couldn&#x27;t actually use it to file your nails properly.) Tweezerman has a wonderful, high quality product here!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this tool.  So much better than the 4-sided foam block my wife and i were using.  I may get my hands dirty but the nails will be shiny!!  Definitely worth the price!</li>
    <li> After receiving the first one, I went right away and bought two more.  I have been looking for a file with all the different filing needs as my old one that I have had from a different brand has fallen apart over the years from so much usage.  This nail tool is simply perfect.</li>
    <li> It is very functional, and it fits well in a small bag. I like the different surfaces for shaping and smoothing all in one device.</li>
    <li> This tool is strong and firm with heavier grit.  It is nicely made and unlike many tools currenly made it is does not have a soft rubber base so it holds up well even with abuse.</li>
    <li> I love this. It lasts a couple years.</li>
    <li> I really like this tool.  It was way overpriced, but it does work really well.  It shows no wear and tear after several uses and I&#x27;m optimistic that it will last quite a while.  The shape is nice for buffing and I like the different filing strengths.</li>
    <li> This a great nail tool,my nails took a beating this last winter and never recovered no matter what I did,  now they look perfect, can&#x27;t believe the difference this tool has made, its very easy to use, does an excellent job, looks like I went to a nail salon.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. It has three different textured files and then the buffing tools. On the tip there is a little nail piece that sticks out to clean under your nails.  I have purchased three over the years and have one in the car, bedroom and next to my arm chair. It&#x27;s a great little filing tool.</li>
    <li> There was nothing included in which to store it, so no way to keep the surfaces from rubbing against anything I might put it in.  I guess the best I&#x27;ll be able to do is lay it in a drawer and try not to let it scratch.  I&#x27;m still trying to find a pouch or something to keep it safe.</li>
    <li> Does a great job with all its different sides. One worry though is you will probably have to buy another one if they wear down. But my nails are lookin good thanks to this handy little guy.</li>
    <li> I really dislike this file. I didn&#x27;t realize that it&#x27;s three-sided and I find it very bulky. Also, the filing surfaces are just glued on to the plastic piece. If you have short nails, it&#x27;s difficult to get the file under them.</li>
    <li> The best nail file you can buy.  it is expensive, but i has surfaces you never thought you needed.  And trust me they are useful.  Again another german invention worth its price</li>
    <li> This is the most user-friendly shaped nail tool I&#x27;ve ever used. Easy to use and efficient, with great design, I highly recommend it to anyone who likes to take good care of their nails.  However, there&#x27;s one detail that prevented me to award this product five stars. The instructions how to use shaping and shining surfaces (which color comes first) are on the package only. It would be easy for manufacturer to add numbers 1, 2 and 3 on the white handle in the middle - and avoid the confusion. I think I&#x27;ll just take a permanent marker to add them myself.  Shape side of the tool: (1) white - heavy-duty filing, (2) black - shape, (3) blue - smooth edges  Shine side of the tool: (1) pink - smooth nail surface, (2) white - buff, (3) grey - shine  Plastic tip of the tool was designed to clean under the nails but in my experience it also works great for pushing the cuticles back.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these for my wife and one for myself. I like the design of this nail tool. It&#x27;s easy to grip and maneuver, and it feels comfortable in my hand. I also like the convenience of having 6 file and shining surfaces on a single tool. I&#x27;ve had this one for a year now and have grown accustom to the efficient nail grooming advantages it provides. I highly recommend the Tweezerman Shape and Shine Nail Tool for men as well as for women.</li>
    <li> I wish the sandpapers had a higher difference in gradient.  A couple of them seem too close together - thanks!</li>
    <li> This nail file is the best, it&#x27;s the only kind I like to use.</li>
    <li> Really like this......Tweezerman Shape and Shine Nail Tool....like the different sides. ....If I like something I buy several so I did and gave to some family members they liked them as well.</li>
    <li> These are great manicure tools. Unfortunately, this works well for other non-manicure projects, so this is my second purchase.</li>
    <li> The shine wears off after washing my hands.  Doesn&#x27;t last like the one bought at the kiosk at the mall.  I just HATE going to the mall.</li>
    <li> This tool doesn&#x27;t wear out like other nail filers and it is very convenient to use.  This is my second one and I will continue to buy it in the future.</li>
    <li> I know, my use of this is probably different than most, so this review is for other guitar players.  Very good product.  I use this to maintain my nails for playing fingerstyle guitar.  The 6 surfaces provided are perfect for that task.  I previously used different files for shaping the nail, shaping the edge, and then creating a fine surface with a 500 grit sandpaper.  This tool covers all those needs.  And the triangular shape is acute enough to get under the nail, the traditional buffer blocks are not as good at that because of the 90 degree angles.  Now I just use each side and twist to get the finer surface, very quick for daily maintenance.</li>
    <li> All the buffer and file options in one place are convenient, although the awkward shape makes it difficult to manuevor.  Also would have liked to see numbers on the files. I&#x27;m not a girly girl and really didn&#x27;t know which buffer/file to use for what, google became my best friend for a minute.</li>
    <li> Boyfriend wanted this. He likes it a lot, and his grandmother, whom he gave a manicure, complimented it as well.He uses three sides of it a lot and says the other three sides are a bit harsh for his nails. It&#x27;s nice to have options I guess.</li>
    <li> Nice, but not sure it will last long for the price.</li>
    <li> Like this nail file ALOT - has nice shape, with multiple grit surfaces - to give your nails a professional manicure look.</li>
    <li> This Tweezerman shape and shine nail tool is really nice! It has 3 sides on each end, each for a different purpose. One end is meant for filing the nail, and I never use that end. It is just kind of an awkward shape to file your nails with. I do use the other end quite a bit though! That end is to buff and shine your nails with and it works great! I would definitely recommend this!</li>
    <li> I only really use the shine end of this tool,  as I have weak/thin nails which only respond well to those fancy crystal files.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gets nails super shiny, easy to handle- Just not sure how long it will last; I may be doing it wrong, but the step 2 shine  board is looking pretty threadbare after 2 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, worth the money spent.</li>
    <li> Still trying to get used to this, but so far, so good. I read that it is excellent for nails that peel, so with Nailtique Nail Protein and this file, my nails are improving quickly. I take great pride in my manicures.</li>
    <li> Convenient and has everything that I need to do my nails.</li>
    <li> Love this thing and plan to get more. It is firm and easy to use. Love it!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve  had my buffer for more than a year, and I have to say that it is just about time to change it. It gave a long run, in my book, I mean, how long do you expect a buffer to last?! You&#x27;re ordinary buffer only last for 6 months, tops. I bought another one, a four sided one, and it is still in my nail kit bag, mostly untouched because I just didn&#x27;t like it as much as I do this one. I use all 6 sides and I like the design. I can easily grip it and buff or shape my nail easy peasy. The Pink side even helps me remove nail polish from my nail surface, not completely, but in those stubborn areas close to my cuticle. I have just made an order for 3 more as gifts for my friends and I just can&#x27;t wait for them to try it! I know they&#x27;ll love it as much as I do!</li>
    <li> It works well, but I wish they made the order in which you need to use the pads to buff your names more obvious. As it is we have to read the instructions that we had to very carefully save from the packaging to remember. I might sharpie numbers on the white plastic part, but it should be more apparent from the get go.</li>
    <li> I love everything Tweezerman makes, and this is no exception.  It&#x27;s awesome.  It has so many different grades of grit that it&#x27;s really customizable to your nails, and the shape makes it easy to get the entire nail surface.  Good stuff.</li>
    <li> WONDERFUL product for smooth, shiny nails!  Highly recommend for an easy way to get elegant, high gloss, natural nails:)</li>
    <li> Works great. Compact for the purse</li>
    <li> Love, love this item, it really help my nails look good! The size and the different functions of the shaper is easy to use. I recommend this item 100%.</li>
    <li> perfect shape, perfect size, perfect filing options. its my favorite nail file ever. i&#x27;ve been using it for two months and it&#x27;s not wearing out yet!</li>
    <li> Love it! Would buy again.</li>
    <li> New , came in about a week.</li>
    <li> Received order as promise. It was package well. It was what I expected...will order again. I have used another product for a couple years but when I tried a this product I loved it. I ordered this smaller to carry in my purse or traveling.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work for being a Tweezerman product.  Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> These may have cost much more than the ones that have a styrofoam base but are much, much nicer to use and the emery surfaces don&#x27;t peel and lift off like the cheap ones.</li>
    <li> difficult to remember which side does what, but kind of ok, effective</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a grown-ass man, and I&#x27;m kind of obsessed with my nails now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A pretty neighbor nurse girl told me nails were one of the first things girls notice and judge a man about. I thought about it for a long while and eventually picked up one of these. I&#x27;m obsessed. It&#x27;s my first one so I can&#x27;t really judge its quality to others but I must say I was impressed by how well each little colored panel performed its individual task.</li>
    <li> It was easy to work with this shipper. I have no complaints about them. Everything was great and without problem.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t seem like something that would last a while so I decided to return it. It was just a bunch of cheap pieces of sand paper stuck on a plastic stick with foam adhesive backing.</li>
    <li> Great multi-sided nail shaper/polisher that lasts a long time.  Very comfortable to use.  This is the best one I have found.</li>
    <li> This item has a range of finishes for every need.  Heavy duty, rough file for toenails to fine grade for light touch ups.  The buffers are ranged again from heavy duty to light.  Properly buffed nails will dramatically extend the life of your manicure and will keep your pedicure looking pretty for much longer.  Good tool.</li>
    <li> This works good.. but to be honest it wears out a bit too soon.. but overall great product..  well atleast its cheap enuf to keep buying.</li>
    <li> The only downfall of this buffer is that you have to remember which color (side) is for what purpose. Otherwise, it&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very sturdy and does not show any wear and tear after 3 months! I also love that it has slim tips which makes it easier to buff and shine in the in-corners of my nails. It really buffs well and makes my nails look beautiful even without polish. It&#x27;s very handy.</li>
    <li> I got one of these many years ago but I needed to replace it after so much use. How happy I am that I found it here!</li>
    <li> In my experience, Tweezerman has never let me down with a product, and this one is no exception.  This multi-use tool features three (3) different filing surfaces ranging from extra coarse to smooth, two (2) buffing surfaces, and one (1) polishing/shining surface.  It&#x27;s hard to believe that they have so many different components in just this one little gadget.  Made from what seems to be very durable plastic, the core itself is of high quality, and each of the filing, buffing, and polishing surfaces seem to be of exceptional quality as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After just one use with this my nails look amazing, and all it took was just the use of 1 tool rather than several that one would definitely expect from looking at these results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tweezerman has done it again for me!</li>
    <li> Just get a cheap one.</li>
    <li> Most nail buffing blocks are flimsy but this is not. The file is very firm and has a pumice stone too. I can get the ridges out of my nails very quickly, file the edges, clean underneath my nails with metal tip on the end. This file can be used effectively on your nails and toenails. I love using the pumice stone on my calluses as well. I won&#x27;t buy another nail file; I love this one!</li>
