<li> I am quite certain that this product caused me to be sick, and also it should be noted that I was not really applying all that much.  </li>
<li> It was not what I expected.</li>
<li> want to return these items, and hope that I can at  least get part of my money back.</li>
<li> The smell makes me think of old men, extra wide lapels, and ugly gray suites.  </li>
<li> I had known of this aftershave in the past and was not sure if it was the one I remembered or not</li>
<li> really can&#x27;t believe how difficult it is to find Polo now a days, or how expensive it has gotten.</li>
<li> I thought I was getting the Polo Eau Toilette spray, but I was not able to cancel the order because of the confusing ordering procedure.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> and it&#x27;s hard to find in this qty</li>
<li> bottle is hard to handle.</li>
<li> When my husband wears this after shave or cologne it makes my knees weak.  </li>
<li> I was so sick that I was vomiting.  </li>
<li> This stuff is absolutely disgusting.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I did not order the proper Polo, I wanted the perfume and the spray dispenser.  I will correct my mistake.  I do enjoy Polo products</li>
    <li> I ordered the polo after shave it arrived promptly and in good condition. Polo most certainly does make an 8oz. bottle, the Ralph Lauren outlet mall stores carry them.</li>
    <li> Does Polo make an 8 oz bottle? I thought 4 oz. was the largest. ( I ordered a 8 oz. bottle from [...] - not Amazon and they sent me an 4 oz. -118 ml. bottle)    IMHO, the 8 is a misprint for 4. Never seen an 8 oz. at any store, either.</li>
    <li> When my husband wears this after shave or cologne it makes my knees weak.  The family associates this aroma with him.  It&#x27;s all good</li>
    <li> I love the Polo aftershave.  I don&#x27;t like the gift sets they a putting together now.  They don&#x27;t put what I want in them.  This 8 oz. bottle is hard to handle.</li>
    <li> I thought I was getting the Polo Eau Toilette spray, but I was not able to cancel the order because of the confusing ordering procedure.&lt;br /&gt;I want to return these items, and hope that I can at  least get part of my money back. I did not realize that this was not what I wanted until after I opened it and tested the product. It was not what I expected. Please give me an address to return the order. I have bought several items over the years through Amazon and would appreciate some help&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;Dick Waggoner</li>
    <li> The only problem with the product is that it needs a little more alcohol content to close minor nicks after shaving.</li>
    <li> As said. As described. Worked as said. I think the bottle was big. But it was what I ordered. Good value for the money.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband for CHristmas.  He used it last night and it is a nice aftershave.  I had known of this aftershave in the past and was not sure if it was the one I remembered or not and it was not but it is a good scent so all in all I am pleased with it and so is he.</li>
    <li> Did not smell like the real polo</li>
    <li> This stuff is absolutely disgusting.  The smell makes me think of old men, extra wide lapels, and ugly gray suites.  Yuck.  What is worse is that I developed a migraine headache with visual aura symptoms within a half hour of applying this poison for the first time.  The next morning, the headache was gone.  At the time I did not realize the cologne had caused the headache.  I reapplied the Polo cologne again that morning, and by the time I got to work I was so sick that I was vomiting.  I had to go back home and rest in bed to recover.  Keep in mind that I have not had migraine headaches for over ten years.  I am quite certain that this product caused me to be sick, and also it should be noted that I was not really applying all that much.  If you do some research on this product, you will find that I am not the only one with a similar headache experience.  Do not buy it!</li>
    <li> I feel like I really got my money&#x27;s worth with this purchase.  I have been using Polo for years, and I have rarely found what I would consider a good deal.  This is as close as you&#x27;ll get to a &amp;#34;good deal&amp;#34; on Polo aftershave.</li>
    <li> It is my favorite all-time aftershave.  I&#x27;ve tried all of the Polos and this is the best.  The price was also fantastic compared to other store locations I have purchased it at before.</li>
    <li> Polo is the best smelling aftershave I have found. Thank you so much for this item. Your Fan, John Theiss</li>

    <li> the  price  was  very  reasonable  and  the  dleivery  was  fast.  it  was  packed  very  efficiently  i  would  reccommend  this  buyer  to anyome</li>
    <li> Great scent at a great price.  Still getting compliments.</li>

    <li> Bought for husband&#x27;s birthday and it&#x27;s hard to find aftershave that doesn&#x27;t smell like an old man!  The size is nice too and it&#x27;s hard to find aftershave in large bottles.  Great purchase.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a very long time, more than 10 years, and am completely happy with it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this for my husband for many, many years....It is a wonderful scent and it&#x27;s also a super price.</li>
    <li> It was great and I like doing business this way, it saves me a trip to town. I like the smell and it&#x27;s hard to find in this qty</li>
    <li> My husband has used this product for over 30 years. It seems to be only available from online sources now. Glad to have found this one. Product came packed thoroughly against potential breakage. Efficient to order and receive.</li>
    <li> Have been using this aftershave for past fifteen or more years.&lt;br /&gt;Love it and look all over for it as new Lauren products have replaced it.&lt;br /&gt;Newness is not always best.&lt;br /&gt;My wife loves it as well.</li>
    <li> Ever since I was old enough to notice the different effects caused by fragrances, I have always swooned over Polo(Green). I have always bought it for my man, and he has also enjoyed the benefits of its effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really can&#x27;t believe how difficult it is to find Polo now a days, or how expensive it has gotten. Thank God one bottle can go a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Ralph Lauren!!!</li>
    <li> My husband loves this brand.  Only wish it came with a tiny funnel so it could be transferred to a smaller bottle for travel.</li>
