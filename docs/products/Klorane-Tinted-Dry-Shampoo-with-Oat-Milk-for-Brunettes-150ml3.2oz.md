      <li>The tinted formula works perfectly for my brunette hair!  </li>
      <li>Klorane really is best and you have to pay for the best.</li>
      <li>I like the Klorane the best though.</li>
      <li>My hair tends to get oily by the end of the day and this stuff works great.  </li>
      <li>I had read that it was great and smelled heavenly.</li>
      <li>Great service.</li>
      <li>and it looks great.  </li>
      <li>My hair fluffs up to gorgeous.</li>
      <li>I loved the non-brunette version too.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff!  </li>
      <li>Love this product!</li>
      <li>Works well for me--adds body, has a nice scent, and extends the time between washes.</li>
      <li>It does exactly what it should and smells great too.</li>
      <li>I love how it magically extends hair washing one day.</li>
      <li>I just wish there was more product for the price.</li>
      <li>I hoped there would be more product in the bottle for the price though.</li>
      <li>So glad I bought this.  </li>

      <li>I have tried many dry shampoos and this is the best of all .</li>
      <li>The best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>Best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve used, am a repeat buyer.</li>
      <li>Best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s easy to style.</li>
      <li>After I&#x27;ve brushed it through, it&#x27;s invisible, and my hair looks great.  </li>
      <li>Works great without leaving the dreaded white residue.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s really &amp;#34;tinted,&amp;#34; but it&#x27;s still very easy to blend into my light brown hair.</li>
      <li>So if you&#x27;re brunette and the original Klorane is cheaper...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth the price!</li>
      <li>Honestly, Dove dry shampoo works as well and smells much better.</li>
      <li>Was quickly delivered and had no problems with that part of the process</li>
      <li>I finally find a perfect dry shampoo!</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s an awesome dry shampoo!</li>
      <li>Hands down, best dry shampoo ever.</li>
      <li>I belong to Birchbox, and get tons of different samples of dry shampoo to try, and this is BY FAR the very best.</li>
      <li>You may see a lot of it in the shower, and that was a bit disconcerting to me at first.  </li>
      <li>This is my favorite dry shampoo.</li>
      <li>I love this dry shampoo.</li>
      <li>It still sprays out a little light on my hair, but blends in easily.</li>
      <li>Seriously the best dry shampoo I have ever used.</li>
      <li>This stuff works really, really well.</li>
      <li>Really works.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>Better than other brands I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
      <li>Compared to the Batiste for dark hair, I like this one better.  </li>
      <li>The only down-side to this product is the price, and the fact that I go through a can so quickly.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a bit more expensive than drug store brands but for me it works better</li>
      <li>Superior to the standard one (white powder color), since it is much harder to notice.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite dry shampoo, I love the slight tiny with my dark brown hair, and think it&#x27;s easy to blend.</li>
      <li>have tried different brands of dry shampoos, but I like this one the most.  </li>
      <li>Leaves hair looking polished and full of life, not dull and dry like some others</li>
      <li>Let&#x27;s be clear, though.  </li>
      <li>Wish I had not wasted money.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t really like this product, it left residue in my hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it about five times so far.  </li>
      <li>This is one of the only dry shampoo&#x27;s I have tried that really works for me.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a real time saver on busy days, and it also adds a little texture and body</li>
      <li>I find that it&#x27;s pretty invisible on my hair, as opposed to big white puffs of powder I get with some other dry shampoos.  </li>

<li> I find that it&#x27;s pretty invisible on my hair, as opposed to big white puffs of powder I get with some other dry shampoos.  </li>
<li> I like this tinted dry shampoo, and prefer it to the regular one from Klorane, as it leaves way less white residue, so I dont have to spend much time brushing the powder off my hair.</li>
<li> It makes my hair gray/White - even worse than a lot of dry shampoo-brands that do not make special versions for brunettes.</li>
<li> Some other dry shampoos have left a white powdery look to my hair.  </li>
<li> I have dark hair and this is the only one that works for me because it doesnt leave as much white residue as others do</li>
<li> I have light brown with blonde highlights so don&#x27;t be afraid of the description.</li>
<li> Klorane Dry Shampoo is a powder, and the tinted formula for brunettes is a bit orangey.  </li>
<li> but it has the finest powder you can find in a dry shampoo.</li>
<li> After that time, simply brush your fingers through your hair and shake it out a little.</li>
<li> I have light brown hair, and it lightens that dirty look</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t feel the brown tint did anything different for my hair color that the plain version didn&#x27;t do either.</li>
<li> My hair is medium to dark brown and this product does not leave a gray/white-ish residue in my hair that Suave dry shampoo does.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m a brunette and its always hard to find dry shampoos that don&#x27;t leave my hair a gross&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;grey&#x27; color.  </li>
<li> However due to the price I haven&#x27;t reordered..I order Batiste for brunette because it&#x27;s half the price.</li>
<li> It does not paint my scalp dark brown like the Batiste does.</li>
<li> but it just makes my hair tough and not really volumized as other brands.</li>
<li> Unfortunately this dry shampoo is NOT suited for dark or Brown hair.</li>
<li> Your hair doesn&#x27;t look as dull.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t Waste your Money on this!!!</li>
<li> Wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t add weird buildup that others have.</li>

    <li> This is awesome. Really works. My hair fluffs up to gorgeous. I have light brown with blonde highlights so don&#x27;t be afraid of the description.</li>
    <li> Works well for me--adds body, has a nice scent, and extends the time between washes. Klorane Dry Shampoo is a powder, and the tinted formula for brunettes is a bit orangey.  I have light brown hair, and it lightens that dirty look I sometimes get at the roots.  I find that it&#x27;s pretty invisible on my hair, as opposed to big white puffs of powder I get with some other dry shampoos.  Let&#x27;s be clear, though.  You will be washing orange powder out of your hair.  You may see a lot of it in the shower, and that was a bit disconcerting to me at first.  Still gets the job done.  Better than other brands I&#x27;ve tried.  I prefer the Klorane to Tressame and Herbal Essence.</li>
    <li> Hands down, best dry shampoo ever. I belong to Birchbox, and get tons of different samples of dry shampoo to try, and this is BY FAR the very best. I never use anything else now!</li>
    <li> I have tried many dry shampoos and this is the best of all .</li>
    <li> I finally find a perfect dry shampoo! It&#x27;s worth the price!</li>

    <li> My hair tends to get oily by the end of the day and this stuff works great.  I spray and then run my fingers through my hair and it looks great.  Some other dry shampoos have left a white powdery look to my hair.  This one is tinted brown so I don&#x27;t have that problem.  The oily look is gone and I can get through the rest of my day without worrying.  It&#x27;s a bit more expensive than drug store brands but for me it works better so it&#x27;s worth it.</li>

    <li> I bought this because I had received a trial size from my Birchbox. This is one of the only dry shampoo&#x27;s I have tried that really works for me.

I didn&#x27;t feel the brown tint did anything different for my hair color that the plain version didn&#x27;t do either. So if you&#x27;re brunette and the original Klorane is cheaper... Go with THAT one to save a couple bucks.</li>
    <li> I love how it magically extends hair washing one day.</li>
    <li> Great service. Best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve used, am a repeat buyer. I have brown highlighted hair. It still sprays out a little light on my hair, but blends in easily. Doesn&#x27;t add weird buildup that others have. Highly recommend!</li>

    <li> I love this dry shampoo. I have dark hair and this is the only one that works for me because it doesnt leave as much white residue as others do</li>
    <li> The fact that this is tinted makes a big difference. Your hair doesn&#x27;t look as dull.</li>
    <li> Best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used! Adds lots of body to my hair without the white powder.</li>

    <li> Seriously the best dry shampoo I have ever used. I&#x27;m a brunette and its always hard to find dry shampoos that don&#x27;t leave my hair a gross&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;grey&#x27; color.  I&#x27;ve found that after you spray Klorane into your hair (and you&#x27;re a brunette) let it sit in your hair for about 2-3 minutes before you do anything.  After that time, simply brush your fingers through your hair and shake it out a little. It&#x27;s perfect!  I always get extra volume and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel greasy. Love this product!</li>
