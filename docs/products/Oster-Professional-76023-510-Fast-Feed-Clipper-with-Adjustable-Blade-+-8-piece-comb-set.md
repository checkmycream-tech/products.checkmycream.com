      <li>It&#x27;s not heavy and it performs perfectly for our needs.</li>
      <li>It is on a loud side but it does what I need it to do and does it great!</li>

      <li>Temped to use it on my poodle, but as much as We love her, the ick factor prevents us.</li>
      <li>Lovely.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve made better purchases from Walmart.</li>
      <li>This is a sturdier and better product.</li>
      <li>I use a #3 on the sides and #4 on the top, and hit it every couple of weeks to keep it neatly trimmed.  </li>
      <li>I love the way this clipper fades and tapers.</li>
      <li>Couldn&#x27;t ask for better</li>
      <li>The lowest adjustment for the sliding top blade leaves about an eighth inch of hair</li>

      <li>good price and fast shipping</li>

      <li>Easy to switch blades.</li>
      <li>cheap rechargeable clippers go for the gold and make it easy on yourself.</li>
      <li>The item was exactly as described, it arrived very quickly and was packaged very securely.</li>
      <li>and we both enjoy using this thing.  </li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s comfortable against the skin.  </li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll get your money&#x27;s worth and more.</li>
      <li>Fortunately, it landed on the floor and broke a couple of teeth.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
      <li>but they do a fantastic job.</li>
      <li>Not as powerful as we had  hoped, but it does the job ok.</li>
      <li>Although not a problem if you can blend with a comb, it would have been nice to get the whole set.</li>
      <li>None of the cheap models work well for me ,this one does.</li>
      <li>easy to clean and maintain.</li>
      <li>works great, quiet, smooth operation, cuts hair cleanly and evenly.</li>
      <li>He says that it is very easy to use and it works really well.</li>
      <li>and you&#x27;ve got a clean</li>
      <li>No snags and cuts clean.</li>
      <li>Within a couple months of periodic use the clippers became blunt and wouldn&#x27;t cut my hair cleanly.</li>
      <li>so you can&#x27;t get a clean line when shaving sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This machine in my opinion is an overall good buy.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Very fine clipper. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> I got my cheap $25 Oster Azteq15 about 5 years ago as a gift from my uncle and recently it broke and found some good reviews about Oster Fast Feed. This Oster Fast Feed is just amazing!! its very light weight and got some power into it! No wonder so many people recommend this clipper. Do not hesitate buying this clipper! Just Go for it!!</li>
    <li> My wife now cuts my hair using this clipper.  We&#x27;re not pros, just trying to save money long term.  This works perfect for her, basically what they use at the salon.  If you&#x27;re looking to cut your own hair or kids hair at home, invest in this one.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my son-in-law and it&#x27;s exactly what he wanted!  Great price too!</li>
    <li> As advertised.  Received promptly.</li>
    <li> I love this machine. Upgrading from wahl clippers, the first thing i noticed was how quiet these clippers are. The cut is nice aswell. The only down side to this order was that the 8 free guards does not include a size #5. It goes from #0-4 skips #5 and continues on from #6-8. Although not a problem if you can blend with a comb, it would have been nice to get the whole set. All in all, it&#x27;s a great product for a great price, I recommend.</li>
    <li> just as the description says. these clippers give me a barbershop feel every time!</li>
    <li> Omg these clippers are amazing!!  I always bought clippers from Walmart for $50 and they all fall apart and really aren&#x27;t even that good! The oster clippers quality was so nice I felt like I upgraded from a Ford Fiesta to a Mercedes ;) buy these clippers u will thank yourself for making the purchase!!</li>
    <li> I have had these clippers for several months now and have had no issues.  It comes with several guards and has an adjustable blade height on the clipper which I use a lot.  No problems.</li>
    <li> Great quality.. works awesome.. fast delivery</li>
    <li> This clipper didn&#x27;t work properly when I got it. The blades get stuck and they don&#x27;t cut evenly.</li>
    <li> This is just perfect, it works well for our family. The cuts look professionally done.</li>
    <li> blade jams up - just bought it- oil doesn&#x27;t help</li>
    <li> this are great clippers theres no tug when im cutting peoples hair real smooth I suggest u buy this clippers</li>
    <li> I have barbered my hubby at home for more than 30 years, and when our wonderful old made in USA Wahl clipper finally died, we needed a new one pronto. This one is made in USA, runs much quieter than the old Wahl, and has a good hefty feel as you use it. The set of extra blade extensions make it easy to choose the right length for the haircut. He likes a #2 in the summer and a #3 in the winter and a close clip on his beard. Highly recommend this item.</li>
    <li> Run smooth and quiet.  I&#x27;m a hairdresser and these are great. I would highly recommend them even for home use. You&#x27;ll get your money&#x27;s worth and more. Don&#x27;t but cheap clippers, it&#x27;s not worth it. These are great.</li>
    <li> Works just as I had expected.  Not a professional model, but more than adequate for home use, Reasonably quiet and light weight.</li>
    <li> Great for me. Not what I would use in a barber shop. For me at home, very good.</li>
    <li> I got this to save on money -- instead of going to the barber for a clipper cut, I do my own.  These clippers have paid for themselves in a few months!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The motor is strong and quiet, never any problems cutting my hair.  I use a #3 on the sides and #4 on the top, and hit it every couple of weeks to keep it neatly trimmed.  I also use the #4 guard to trim my mustache and beard.</li>
    <li> Prompt delivery and it is just what I needed</li>
    <li> Take professional out of the title cause this is less-than walmart quality; I used it 25x in 1yr span &amp; she&#x27;s toast</li>
    <li> good price and fast shipping</li>
    <li> Does the job as advertised. Came with the different shields so I did not have to buy any extras, but I did.</li>
    <li> I wish I would have spent the extra money and got the next one up. this one is&lt;br /&gt;already acting up. I am having problems with the blades.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my son who is in barbering school and he said is the best one in the classroom and everybody wants to use it!</li>
    <li> Works great! No snags and cuts clean. I just need to get the trimmers to go with it</li>
    <li> Gets hot if used for long period of time (I shave my beard and head but take my time to make sure I got everything. It tends to get hot but within normal limits.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am greatly satisfied</li>
    <li> It plows right through my hair. Much better than the cheap thing we bought at the store. It will pay be back in just a few more haircuts.</li>
    <li> Nice, powerful, and lightweight set of clippers.  I don&#x27;t use them for fading, though, because they can&#x27;t be zero-gapped.  They&#x27;re good to use in place of the more expensive Oster 76 clippers to use guards with and cut longer hair, like on the top of someone&#x27;s head.</li>
    <li> Powerful beast. Use it to shave and trim. We are not pros so I can only comment or regular household use for adults and children. Temped to use it on my poodle, but as much as We love her, the ick factor prevents us. Probably a good health prevention! The attachments are great and tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And unlike other reviewers, we did not experience it heating up even after fifteen minutes of continuous use!</li>
    <li> I like it. Fat shipping and good quality. Machine works good and no issues. I will buy one again If I need to.</li>
    <li> Great machine, cuts great. Nice and trimmed everytime. A bit over priced that is why I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars.</li>
    <li> my son pick these out for him because he cut his hair and his brother.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Powerful.  One pass and you&#x27;ve got a clean cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No question you should buy this over any of the Wahl clippers (which I&#x27;ve gone through about 6 of).  The wahl&#x27;s don&#x27;t last very long and don&#x27;t cut cleanly, so they &amp;#34;pull&amp;#34; your hair, cut unevenly and &amp;#34;clog&amp;#34; (so you have to go over the same section multiple times).</li>
    <li> I use these to cut my own hair. They are much quieter than other brands I have bought and don&#x27;t grab or tug at all. Happy I went with a better quality this time.</li>
    <li> My wife cuts my hair, and we&#x27;ve been using the Walmart clippers for years. These are very quiet and powerful. I think it&#x27;s been over a year now, and they still work great. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Absolutely excellent clippers. These things are commercial grade...  You will not be disappointed.. just like in description.  Trust all the great reviews....</li>
    <li> You get what  you pay for you might pay a little more than the walmart cheapies but the quality is so much better less noise almost no pulling overall great product at a fair price!</li>
    <li> Work well for my personal use.</li>
    <li> It works like a 5 star product now.  But as I saw in other reviews, there are two things that are very annoying about it out of the box.&lt;br /&gt;1. The top stationary blade points are way to sharp and snag the skin.  I bled on my neck the first time using it to shave beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The lowest adjustment for the sliding top blade leaves about an eighth inch of hair so you can&#x27;t get a clean line when shaving sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I was able to remedy both issues by using emery cloth to knock down the sharp points so it&#x27;s comfortable against the skin.  And I removed the adjusting lever completely which allows me to slide the top blade down even with the lower oscillating blade giving me nice crisp clean edges to my sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love how quiet it is and how well it cuts hair.  It&#x27;s a shame they don&#x27;t address these simple design flaws.</li>
    <li> i love these clippers they are the best i have no problem cutting my hair or my friends and they also do not pull while cutting there extremely accurate</li>
    <li> Bought this on the recommendation of my sister-in-law who is a professional beautician.  Super fast delivery. Sooooo happy with the purchase.  Incredibly quiet. Super strong motor which cuts coarse thick hair without catching.  And the great news is - she tells me I should get 15 plus years out of it for home use!!!!</li>
    <li> Brand new, super quiet. They do get a little warm ( im doing 2-3 cuts an hour ) but not hot.  I did Zero gap them which really helped the precision and smoothness.</li>
    <li> Purchase for my husband, cuts really good, he is really happy.</li>
    <li> Great product never bought semi expensive clippers most ive spent was 30 but these are amazing. I was going to buy the 150$ ones but not anymore</li>
    <li> I cut my own hair with these clippers and they work great.  I have never had clippers like these before so can&#x27;t compare them but they do a fantastic job.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t ask for better</li>
    <li> works great, quiet, smooth operation, cuts hair cleanly and evenly. easy to clean and maintain. very user friendly.</li>
    <li> Very quiet. Have owned for quite a few months now.&lt;br /&gt;No problems so far. I hope it continues like this.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised with the sturdy quality and the quiet operation of this machine. The electrical cord is acceptably supple and does not tangle easily. This machine in my opinion is an overall good buy.</li>
    <li> Excellent buying experience! The item was exactly as described, it arrived very quickly and was packaged very securely. The price was also the best on the internet, too. Great item, exactly what I wanted! Highly recommend both this item and the seller. Thanks very much!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t cut as expected....</li>
    <li> very quiet! heavy feel!</li>
    <li> I did my due diligence and conducted meticulous research before purchasing this clipper set. Overall the reviews were positive and the price was right. Within a couple months of periodic use the clippers became blunt and wouldn&#x27;t cut my hair cleanly. Also, the clippers would become extremely hot after a few minutes. I&#x27;ve made better purchases from Walmart. Look elsewhere for good reliable clippers.</li>
    <li> Owned other makes before, but decided to buy something of quality made in the USA.&lt;br /&gt;Great product that does just exactly what it is designed to do. Well made!!!&lt;br /&gt;Glad I spent a little extra as I think I got more than my money&#x27;s worth by upgrading to a quality product.</li>
    <li> Nice clippers.  They cut quietly and effortlessly, without pulling or grabbing, making them especially suitable for cutting kids&#x27; hair.  I wish that the comb set included a couple of taper combs.  All in all, the clippers are probably what you want.    Jim</li>
    <li> I have always purchased the clippers from walmart and target always trying to get a good deal.  They always break and jam up when you are cutting hair.  I buzz my head all the time and it&#x27;s great.  Worth the price and don&#x27;t jam up.  It&#x27;s actually so good I learned how to cut hair and now I cut all my families.</li>
    <li> My 40-year-old Oster clippers finally wore out.  Hope these last as long.</li>
    <li> everything i expected.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my husband and he loves them. We received them in a timely fashion. I would recommend these clippers to anyone with thick, coarse hair.</li>
    <li> The clippers of small and easily used by non-professionals.  My wife cuts my hair and has been able to cut very nicely with these clippers.  They are also durable for family use (in case they are dropped).  Most of all the clippers are quiet as opposed to the previous clippers we owned that had to be adjusted frequently to quiet-down the cutting.</li>
    <li> I love the way this clipper fades and tapers. The adjustable blade stays firmly on the level you adjust it to, making it easy and expressive when doing your hair cuts.&lt;br /&gt;The speed is quite fast, and remarkably quieter than my previous Whal Clippers.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to your novice and veteran barber.</li>
    <li> Not as powerful as we had  hoped, but it does the job ok.</li>
    <li> They are quiet but sometimes make a piercing noise and I have to lift blade for awhile for them to stop. Also I recommend buying the plastic guards with the metal piece underneath. These guards make an embarrassing vibrating noise.</li>
    <li> My Son buzz cuts his hair on a regular basis and really likes this tool so far.  I hope it lasts!</li>
    <li> High grade clippers make cutting my hair a breeze.  Don&#x27;t buy cheap rechargeable clippers go for the gold and make it easy on yourself.</li>
    <li> They work very well! nice and smooth cutting!</li>
    <li> This is the best clipper I have ever bought as far as the clipper...I have one complaint and that is that the on and off switch works rather hard...But outside of that I can&#x27;t complain and I am well pleased...</li>
    <li> Great clippers for the price.  THey have enough power to get through me and my sons hair and leave few hairs behind.  Dunno what else to say...they are clippers.</li>
    <li> We got this after owning a Wahl. This is a sturdier and better product. We are not professional but found this very easy to use. It&#x27;s not heavy and it performs perfectly for our needs. We use it to buzz my husbands hair.</li>
    <li> She cuts like a dream . Love the selection of attachments! Well made, quiet, and ver smooth cutting. Easy to switch blades.</li>
    <li> I was excited to switch from a cheaper Wahl to this professional one with a powerful motor...but&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The slippery shell caused me to drop the unit in the midst of cutting my childs hair, and it is heavy. Fortunately, it landed on the floor and broke a couple of teeth.&lt;br /&gt;2. The 3 attachments that come from the manufacturer with the unit are very sharp/pointy that it tears into sensitive skin behind the ears of little ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The above two experiences tell me that this may be a well engineered product, but hasnt had real-world users test before launch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I broke the teeth, I didn&#x27;t want to return it, so I threw it in the trash.</li>
    <li> Best clippers you can get for the money</li>
    <li> I love these clipper, they are great for fades the adjustable blade it was makes these clipper so great&lt;br /&gt;and you get the 8 piece guard set with them,For the price this are a steal,they sale for a 100 bucks at the beauty store.</li>
    <li> They do the job but I just can&#x27;t give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Great service!!! Love it.</li>
    <li> Professional quality, very quiet, cuts like a champ!  Very happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> Been doing my own hair for ages.  My wife&#x27;s been doing it for me recently and we both enjoy using this thing.  Stop buying clippers at Wally World and get this!!</li>
    <li> I cut my husband&#x27;s hair and I always had problems with all the clippers breaking down on my after 2-3 uses. Not this one! It&#x27;s been great and I&#x27;ve been using them for almost a year now. No problems at all. It is on a loud side but it does what I need it to do and does it great!</li>
    <li> I found the head size on this clipper too narrow, the adjustments annoying too use and the blades not very sharp.</li>
    <li> The guards that came with this were plentiful and durable.  The clippers are very powerful and work ten times better than my old ConAir clippers that I purchased from Wal-Mart years ago.  They used to leave uneven patches in my hair that took an additional 10 minutes of trimming to fix.  With the new Oster, my wife was finished with my hair in about 5 minutes.  There were no uneven patches and it did not struggle with the thickness of my hair.  Good set of clippers for the money!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend and he loved it! He says that it is very easy to use and it works really well.</li>
    <li> Was really appreciated by the recipient and put into very good use.</li>
    <li> Works great and I have thick hair. None of the cheap models work well for me ,this one does.And you can tell it is a quality piece .As the old adage goes you get what you pay for ,and with this it is worth it .Free blade sharpening for life ,can&#x27;t beat that.</li>
    <li> This is my second pair of these clippers in 22 years. My last pair would&#x27;ve probably lasted forever if I had not dropped them on the basement floor several times over the years. These clippers have saved us tons of money on haircuts over the years</li>
    <li> Lovely. My barber recommended it For my beard.  Kinda bolky for the beard. But a job well done. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I am super excited about my new Oster machine. Top notch! Thanks.</li>
    <li> Have used it on my son twice, it does not make noise, good for cutting hair and not for trimming or lining</li>
    <li> Great price , loved it</li>
    <li> My daughter loves these and says she can carry on a conversation with a client without trying to talk over the clippers.</li>
