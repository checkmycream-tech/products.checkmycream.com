      <li>It smells very clean</li>
      <li>This one is a very special scent to me.</li>
      <li>I enjoy it and many people have commented on it when I&#x27;m wearing it and have asked me what I&#x27;m wearing.  </li>
      <li>This scent is so lovely, feminine, and unique.</li>
      <li>I first tried it at a store, liked it and realized that Amazon sells it for a lot cheaper price.</li>
      <li>Very clean, sweet and airy scent.</li>
      <li>The very fist time I tried THE BEAT by BURBERRY I fell in love!</li>
      <li>This one is my absolute favorite!</li>
      <li>It really does have a nice light scent.</li>
      <li>has a light \\&quot;baby powdery\\&quot; scent that lasts all day.  </li>
      <li>Cheaper to buy in Amazon.com than the  airport duty free shops.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am ready to place another order!!!</li>
      <li>Burberry decides to discontinue it - which seems to happen to me a lot when I finally find something I truly love!!  </li>
      <li>Very clean, uplifting, and fresh.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s unique.</li>
      <li>It has very clean smell, kind of like Light Blue</li>
      <li>Beat is a clean, unisex, rather mellow scent,</li>
      <li>It is a  sweet, fresh and innocent scent that makes you smile every time you spray it on.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a woman allergic to most perfume, so I&#x27;ve long been a fan of many men&#x27;s fragrances, Vetiver by Guerlain, Eau Savage, Davidoff&#x27;s Cool Water, so I almost reluctantly tried The Beat by Burberry after reading many reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Gave this as a special gift to my special someone and she loves it.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s such a great deal and it was exactly like I remembered it.</li>
      <li>I love it so much that I have a stock pile in case</li>
      <li>One of them was counterfeit, but Amazon credited the  full amount.&lt;br</li>
      <li>but not a bad smell or</li>
      <li>giving a 5-star review to this seller, because I received the package sooner than I expected, the price was very good and the perfume is the real thing.</li>
      <li>smells fresh &amp; clean.  </li>
      <li>It is fresh and clean not over bearing.  </li>
      <li>This is for women who do not like strong and overpowering perfumes or the kinds that smell like pure alcohol.</li>
      <li>It is so clean smelling - not suffocating or too flowery.  </li>
      <li>Very airy and light.</li>
      <li>Fresh scent that lingers.</li>
      <li>I found its worth for the price paid.</li>
      <li>It is sweet and uncomplicated and lasts almost the whole day.  </li>
      <li>It is not a disappointment but definitely could be better.</li>
      <li>My friend likes it very much.</li>
      <li>Would like to buy more in future.</li>
      <li>My mother called me at the end of the first day she used it and commented on all complements she had received that day.  </li>
      <li>It is really sexy and lasting.</li>
      <li>I was so disheartened to see it was discontinued but overjoyed to see it on Amazon at such a cheap price!</li>
      <li>I love this perfume particulary because it is not overwhelming and the fragrance lasts for most of the day.</li>
      <li>I went to Macy&#x27;s to buy this perfum for my wife since it is her favorite and was told by a sales rep that it was discontinued, she then went to the computer and showed me they had some left on their website.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t find it anywhere in real life.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really find it \\&quot;feminine\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>thanks amazon you rock</li>
      <li>really recommended!!!&lt;br</li>
      <li>I do really prefer this one over the men version.</li>
      <li>i&#x27;m addicted :-P</li>
      <li>Since I did that, the bottle leaked every time I used it and what I thought would last me a year or more of daily use was gone in 6 months.  </li>
      <li>Beat is nicely blended, the 3 spray rule works perfectly, never too strong or over powering with a lovely, mellow dry down.</li>
      <li>In general I really like this scent, its a warmer floral scent</li>
      <li>Oddly, I find both men and women seem to like it equally, but most have never heard of or worn</li>
      <li>it is very uplifting, energizing, young but not only for the young..feels like any woman  </li>
      <li>I really hope it never runs out of stock, or comes back!</li>
      <li>Its mild enough, doesn&#x27;t give me a headache and stays for long as well.</li>
      <li>I bought it on amazon didn&#x27;t really know what to expect, but after all I really like it, the sent is not too sharp</li>
      <li>It smells very woody with slight hints of floral, but it definitely has a mysterious characteristic that is so rich and sweet, it keeps drawing me back!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s never too sweet, never too heavy.</li>
      <li>Also has the same problem as Light Blue, it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this perfume.  I can&#x27;t find it anywhere in real life.  It&#x27;s discontinued.  This is it.  It&#x27;s such a great deal and it was exactly like I remembered it.</li>
    <li> This product was not up to part! I was very very very weak as if it had been watered down. Did not want to go through the hassel of sending it back. so jus dealt with an utter disappointment. Threw it in the trash</li>
    <li> I ordered this product thinking its just a perfume. To my surprise, I received the perfume and a moisturizer cream. That&#x27;s like icing on cake. Love it !!!</li>
    <li> I have always liked Burberry..their fragrances are veruy wearable, always well constructed...mostly light and casual..The Beat continues on the tradition!! it is very uplifting, energizing, young but not only for the young..feels like any woman  out there can appreciate the freshness and warmth of The Beat!! I dont feel it is unisex..cant picture a man wearing it!! Modern and alluring, a great scsnt!!</li>
    <li> the beat has replaced my all time favorite burberry london.  smells fresh &amp; clean.  has a light \\&quot;baby powdery\\&quot; scent that lasts all day.  i&#x27;m addicted :-P</li>
    <li> I love this perfume particulary because it is not overwhelming and the fragrance lasts for most of the day. This is for women who do not like strong and overpowering perfumes or the kinds that smell like pure alcohol. Very airy and light. My husband loves this on me and I would definitely continue to purchase again. It is even cheaper on Amazon than what I found in department stores so I will be purchasing it from Amazon next time!</li>
    <li> &amp;lt;3 it ;O)&lt;br /&gt;this is my second bottle and this is the lowest of all the stores &amp; website.... my third bottle of the beat.. thanks amazon you rock</li>
    <li> The very fist time I tried THE BEAT by BURBERRY I fell in love! It is a  sweet, fresh and innocent scent that makes you smile every time you spray it on. I can&#x27;t think of a reason why anyone would not like it -- it&#x27;s never overwhelming, it&#x27;s a beautiful scent and even the presentation is appealing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a woman allergic to most perfume, so I&#x27;ve long been a fan of many men&#x27;s fragrances, Vetiver by Guerlain, Eau Savage, Davidoff&#x27;s Cool Water, so I almost reluctantly tried The Beat by Burberry after reading many reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Beat is a clean, unisex, rather mellow scent, quite long lasting.  I enjoy it and many people have commented on it when I&#x27;m wearing it and have asked me what I&#x27;m wearing.  Oddly, I find both men and women seem to like it equally, but most have never heard of or worn Burberry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Beat is nicely blended, the 3 spray rule works perfectly, never too strong or over powering with a lovely, mellow dry down.</li>
    <li> I was initially skeptical that this product may be a fake/copy cat of the real Burberry the Beat but it Is legit. &amp; a great deal!</li>
    <li> Bought it for my wife and she loved the fragrance. It&#x27;s unique. I found its worth for the price paid.</li>
    <li> In general I really like this scent, its a warmer floral scent so I usually wear it at night, but its \\&quot;casual\\&quot; enough to wear during the day. It does fade and start to smell different by the end of the day though.. but not a bad smell or anything!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 22 and I&#x27;d recommend it to the females in my life.. I get many compliments on it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this on here through Amazon from FragranceNet, and they set me the travel collection which includes the 1.7oz EDP with a small lotion! This scent is so lovely, feminine, and unique.</li>
    <li> I had not tried Burberry fragrance before, but my daughter loved one of them.  Saw it in a magazine and smelled it.  It is fresh and clean not over bearing.  I would recommend it if you like that type of scent.</li>
    <li> After smelling this perfume on a coworker, I bought 3 bottles of this stuff for wife, mother and grandmother for mothers day. My mother called me at the end of the first day she used it and commented on all complements she had received that day.  It really does have a nice light scent.</li>
    <li> I bought it on amazon didn&#x27;t really know what to expect, but after all I really like it, the sent is not too sharp which is good and the packaging is also nice.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t necessarily a bad thing, but when I received this for my wife&#x27;s birthday it turns out it is a set with the perfume AND a body lotion . Like I said a pleasant surprise when I thought I was just ordering the perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also for some reason I couldn&#x27;t leave packaging feedback even though this is sold by Amzn...???</li>
    <li> Best perfume I&#x27;ve ever used. It is a little bit on the expensive side, but you can usually find a reasonable price available on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this purfume. I just wish the bottle would last longer! need to buy a bigger bottle next time!</li>
    <li> Tried this at an airport perfume place and leaves me an impression. When it comes down to buying it, I forgot it was the female perfume I tried or the male cologne, but consider the price of this one is cheaper, I bought it. It is not a disappointment but definitely could be better. It has very clean smell, kind of like Light Blue but without the fruity scent. Also has the same problem as Light Blue, it doesn&#x27;t last long. Over all, it&#x27;s a four stars, I would recommend to people and maybe try The Beat for Men next time.</li>
    <li> I could not find this perfume in my local department stores, so I discovered&lt;br /&gt;that I could buy it through Amazon. I am very happy to have my favorite&lt;br /&gt;perfume again.</li>
    <li> Fresh scent that lingers. Cheaper to buy in Amazon.com than the  airport duty free shops.</li>
    <li> This is a repeat purchase for me. I love this fragrance for daytime use. It&#x27;s never too sweet, never too heavy. Very clean, uplifting, and fresh.</li>
    <li> I purchased this originally because I loved the scent.  It is sweet and uncomplicated and lasts almost the whole day.  However, there is a leather strap that is in the lid of the bottle and it was turning green, so I thought it would be a good idea to remove it.  Since I did that, the bottle leaked every time I used it and what I thought would last me a year or more of daily use was gone in 6 months.  Maybe it would have laster longer had I not messed with the bottle.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend bought me this parfum and I used it all up.  It&#x27;s one of my favorites.  I buy everything on Amazon and I knew I could get it cheaper than anywhere else.</li>
    <li> It is really sexy and lasting. Nice price. My friend likes it very much. Would like to buy more in future.</li>
    <li> I got it for my daughter and she loves it! She got  a lot of compliments! I have to buy it for myself.</li>
    <li> I went to Macy&#x27;s to buy this perfum for my wife since it is her favorite and was told by a sales rep that it was discontinued, she then went to the computer and showed me they had some left on their website. I said no thank you and went on amazon to find that amazon had it for less than half the price as Macy&#x27;s. Bought it, wife loved it and I&#x27;m happy for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> I am a perfume/body spray person I buy all types and smells..This one is my absolute favorite! It smells very clean and i get a lot of compliments on it! Love this stuff!!!!</li>
    <li> This one is a very special scent to me. It brings great memories. I just have to say that I&#x27;m a guy  and I wear this proudly. I don&#x27;t really find it \\&quot;feminine\\&quot;. I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments from both men and women. This is UNISEX. Very clean, sweet and airy scent. I do really prefer this one over the men version. 10/10</li>
    <li> I have been in love with this fragrance since I was 16 (I&#x27;m 21 now). I was so disheartened to see it was discontinued but overjoyed to see it on Amazon at such a cheap price! It smells very woody with slight hints of floral, but it definitely has a mysterious characteristic that is so rich and sweet, it keeps drawing me back! It is very sophisticated and chic, I am in love and it is my signature fragrance! I really hope it never runs out of stock, or comes back!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this perfume for a while and have bought at Amazon several times, from different vendors. One of them was counterfeit, but Amazon credited the  full amount.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving a 5-star review to this seller, because I received the package sooner than I expected, the price was very good and the perfume is the real thing.</li>
    <li> Its GOOD. I first tried it at a store, liked it and realized that Amazon sells it for a lot cheaper price. Its a great deal. I love the smell! Its mild enough, doesn&#x27;t give me a headache and stays for long as well. The packaging is also very good.</li>
    <li> Shipped faster than expected, and am obsessed with the scent. Had a great experience, and this is my new favorite for sure</li>
    <li> Gave this as a special gift to my special someone and she loves it.  Great scent, not overpowering.  We did check it out at the store a few months ago, I don&#x27;t like buying scents I haven&#x27;t tested.</li>
    <li> I have searched all my life for &amp;#34;my scent&amp;#34;, and this is it.  It is so clean smelling - not suffocating or too flowery.  I love it so much that I have a stock pile in case Burberry decides to discontinue it - which seems to happen to me a lot when I finally find something I truly love!!  I get compliments from everyone on this wonderful scent.  It just makes me feel better when I spritz it on.....</li>
    <li> I love Burberry! I loved it!!! this is my signature fragrance!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really recommended!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am ready to place another order!!!</li>
