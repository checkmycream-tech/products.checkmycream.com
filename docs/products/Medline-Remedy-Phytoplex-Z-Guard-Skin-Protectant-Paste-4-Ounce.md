<li> My son has bad diaper rash from being reconnected (he use to have a stoma) and a wound care nurse put this cream on his rash.  </li>
<li> silicone base</li>

    <li> I use this on my son&#x27;s diaper rash (and my own chaffing) and it clears up within hours! It&#x27;s thick and messy to apply, but that&#x27;s a small price to pay for one of the only things that&#x27;s helped my son get over his diaper rash!</li>

    <li> My babygirl was breaking out in the diaper area and we really couldn&#x27;t understand why-We changed her frequently and we have taken her to the doctor. We found out that it could be something she is eating and when she went potty it could be aggravating her skin- well this cream worked wonders. It healed it right up and it gave her relief. I will buy again and I will let all my \\&quot;mommy\\&quot; friends know about it.</li>
    <li> I would definitely recommend this product to all the mothers out there. When my newborn was hospitalized at 7 weeks I was given this product to use on him. I was amazed at how thick the paste was and wasn&#x27;t sure how it would work. The staff raved about how great it was. Let me say I was not disappointed. I noticed the results immediately. After using it twice his rash was completely gone. I researched online on where I could buy some and was so happy to find it here on Amazon. I had a free $25 code and was able to buy 3 4 oz tubes. I know these will  last me a long time.</li>
    <li> Best diaper rash creme ever!</li>
    <li> Use this for my sons bottom. His skin is very sensitive. This is the only cream that works on him when he gets a rash. It literally works within hours. Always get their products on time.. And they have great prices!! Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff for really bad diaper rashes</li>
    <li> It is a very good product recommended by a home health nurse...</li>
    <li> Excellent product for the incontinent.  Just messy to put on, but that is not unusual.</li>
    <li> Great product great service</li>
    <li> We were given this product by hospital staff while our son was in the NICU. He is exclusively breastfed and changed regularly, but his tiny hiney was getting a little raw. This works well as a diaper cream for him.</li>
    <li> Great for diaper rash on my new baby.  They have it to us in the NICU and since returning home, it is the only cream that really keeps away the diaper rash and heals it up quickly if we&#x27;ve used something else that didn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
    <li> Amazing! I&#x27;ll never use anything else for diaper rash!</li>
    <li> This product was used by both the local hospital and rehabilitation center that my husband was in.  I was amazed to find that Walgreens, CVS and even Walmart did not offer this product.  I ended up going into Amazon and had absolutely no problem and finding and purchasing this product.  It is excellent for anyone suffering from severe adult &amp;#34;diaper rash&amp;#34; caused by the need to wear those disposable adult diapers.</li>
    <li> This helps us make sure my 104 year old Grandmother does not develop bed sores.</li>
    <li> My mom is bed ridden and her skin breaks down easily on her buttocks, z-guard was recommended by her nurse as a protecterant for her skin and it has worked great against wetness by guarding the skin with some barrier . Will keep using it it. Great stuff for the price.</li>
    <li> We love this diaper cream. It clears up my sons rash in less than a day.</li>
    <li> This paste is used in the ICU at UC San Francisco for its patients.  Excellent product as it protects the skin and heals it at the same time.  more of a paste than a cream so much better protection</li>
    <li> The best stuff I can find for moisture issues.  It can keep fungal infections at bay by keeping moisture off your skin.  The zinc oxide also has a mild antifungal antibacterial effect.  I use this on my groin / perenium and sometimes on my feet.  It has a mild odor of Zinc oxide and is soothing to the skin.</li>
    <li> Use this with every diaper change and my daughter hasn&#x27;t gotten diaper rash at all! Love this stuff. Favorite diaper ointment by far!</li>
    <li> Excellent preventative as a diaper cream.</li>
    <li> This was something that they used in the hospital and again at the rehab facility.  It seems  excellent so I wanted to have it at home. It goes on easily and gives good protection.</li>
    <li> Heals wounds wonderfully.  I recommend this product to anyone with sores or rashes.  I was introduced to it when I was in the hosp and loved how well it works.</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff ever!  Used it on my Mom for pressure sores...silicone base and is wonderful!  The Wound Center recommended it and we are pleased.</li>

    <li> We have been using this diaper cream on my son for almost a year now and love it.  Whenever he has a red spot we put it on the area and it clears up by the next day.  It has a mild odor that is not nearly as strong as some of the other creams out there.  My son has really sensitive skin and it is the only cream we have found that works well for him.  My husband recently started calling it &amp;#34;The Miracle Cream.&amp;#34;</li>
