      <li>Never disappointed with this company&#x27;s products!</li>
      <li>works very well but witch hazel itself does not smell good</li>
      <li>The smell of this is so strong I threw up in my mouth while applying it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so gentle and effective that I&#x27;ve stopped washing my face with cleanser.</li>
      <li>I never knew that witch hazel was available in organic form.</li>
      <li>the bottle isnt really secure and it will leak.  </li>
      <li>Nice gentle product.</li>
      <li>While it costs a bit more, I feel that the quality of this organic ,pure product makes it worth the 2 more dollars or so.</li>
      <li>Great company that&#x27;s been around a long time.</li>
      <li>Came quickly and is a fine product.</li>
      <li>works well to clean oga mats</li>

      <li>A good price on the larger 160z size too.</li>
      <li>the product or the cool girl&#x27;s picture on the bottle...</li>
      <li>I love this gentle product.  </li>
      <li>Shipping was very quick and the product was exactly as described....</li>
      <li>Has a clean fresh smell to it.  </li>
      <li>Everyone is saying it smells so fresh and clean.  </li>
      <li>Etailz was super helpful in processing my refund.  </li>
      <li>Lastly, I don&#x27;t recommend toning too much, if you need help throughout the day to feel fresh get yourself some rose water in a spray bottle, now that&#x27;s the stuff!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this stuff and this seller is awesome. Great everything.</li>
    <li> I love Humphrey&#x27; s Witch Hazel....It&#x27;s the only kind I buy now.  I know the quality is better &amp; the organic version you know won&#x27;t have any pesticides.  It lasts a long time so I don&#x27;t mind paying a little more here for Humphreys over the local &amp;#34;who knows where it came from or what&#x27;s in it&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> The label proudly proclaims &amp;#34;100% All Natural Witch Hazel&amp;#34; on both sides of the bottle. However, this product contains 14% alcohol. Exactly what I was trying to avoid when I ordered this &amp;#34;100% All Natural Witch Hazel.&amp;#34; Disappointing.</li>
    <li> Good product for what ails you and other things :)</li>
    <li> Works as intended and advertised</li>
    <li> Much better than the stuff you buy in the big box or the local drug store.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality. Good value. Never disappointed with this company&#x27;s products!</li>
    <li> Item sent on time and just what I expected.</li>
    <li> Love this! So much better than the regular stuff. Even the smell is so much different. I will always buy organic, from now on!</li>
    <li> No issues with this product.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Shipping was very quick and the product was exactly as described....great experience</li>
    <li> I got this Witch Hazel and I am satisfied with the purchase. I was specifically looking for Organic one and was glad I got this. Smells light and kind of pleasant to me (I never knew how Witch Hazel smells).</li>
    <li> I like it but it is aittle pricey.</li>
    <li> Everything was great with product and delivery</li>
    <li> Great delivery! Nice gentle product.</li>
    <li> Iused this to make a room spray with essential oils, and was well pleased.</li>
    <li> Came quickly and is a fine product. I should have researched more though, I was hoping for a product with no alcohol, this one has 14%. There are witch hazels with no alcohol, so look further if that&#x27;s what you want.</li>
    <li> I love this! and love price! my face loves it too</li>
    <li> Words cannot describe how incredible this witch hazel is. The quality is top notch, honestly; not your average witch hazel.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this witch hazel for about 2 months now and use it daily, i still have TONS of it left.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re on the fence, get off it and order this witch hazel you really won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> The smell of this is so strong I threw up in my mouth while applying it. It smells like tequila. Old nasty tequila.  Complete waste of my money in my eyes</li>
    <li> Use witch hazel for so many things. great for our dogs ears.  Witch hazel &amp; aloe equal parts &amp; a couple drops of Lavender does the trick for fungus in the ear.</li>
    <li> I never knew that witch hazel was available in organic form.</li>
    <li> Does what I expected it to do.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this.</li>
    <li> A great witch hazel Astringent that is Organic!</li>
    <li> I dont&#x27; like the smell, so maybe I should have ordered the scented laveder or rose witch hazel.</li>
    <li> works well to clean oga mats</li>
    <li> Best organic toner lasts a long time. Great refreshing feeling and scent. Truly makes pores smaller and blemished dissappear.</li>
    <li> Reasonably priced, reasonable amount of time to get here. Good product.</li>
    <li> Great quality, great price. Wish they had larger bottles as I use this in my homemade beauty &amp; household products. Will definitely be getting more soon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using witch hazel as a toner for years. I&#x27;m someone who&#x27;s had to deal with bouts of bad acne for most of my life so I&#x27;ve tried it all. Witch hazel is the end all be all of toners. And it only makes sense that is a simple natural ingredient. I go for the organic stuff because I&#x27;m a firm believer in minimizing GMO and pesticide intake as much as possible; when your lathering your face with this stuff 1-3 times daily you should take into consideration what your absorbing into your body. Because witch hazel is nonalcoholic it doesn&#x27;t burn or feel harsh on the skin. Lastly, I don&#x27;t recommend toning too much, if you need help throughout the day to feel fresh get yourself some rose water in a spray bottle, now that&#x27;s the stuff!</li>
    <li> Very smooth transaction, nice product.  Fair price/shipping.</li>
    <li> Added it to my essential oils for bug repellant!  YES!  Love IT</li>
    <li> was hesitant to use witch hazel on my face again because in the past it really dried it out, but, this product is wonderful!! No dryness! I will buy this product again!</li>
    <li> Great company that&#x27;s been around a long time. It&#x27;s also a great product. I&#x27;ve used Humphrey&#x27;s Witch Hazel in the past and was not disappointed. I&#x27;m using it in my own DIY products (i.e. facial toner, after sun spray, etc.) and it working great.</li>
    <li> Does wonders to your skin and lasts forever! Great price and great product! 5 stars...im a customer for life for sure!!!</li>
    <li> Berry good product would buy again.</li>
    <li> While it costs a bit more, I feel that the quality of this organic ,pure product makes it worth the 2 more dollars or so. I want the most pure product I can get for my cosmetic mists.</li>
    <li> Great for cleaning my face each morning.</li>
    <li> Still trying to find more uses.</li>
    <li> Great to use making homemade EO Products.</li>
    <li> I use in combination with essential oils to make homemade hand sanitizer and I love it!  It&#x27;s got the antiseptic properties but without the alcohol... wonderful!</li>
    <li> Used this in a homemade mosquito repellent recipe.  Pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> I use this stuff for everything.... seriously everything! It is great and I am so happy I found a company I enjoy giving my business to. Humphry&#x27;s is the way to go, it is a superior product, an admirable company and smells SO MUCH better than other brands.</li>
    <li> THIS STUFF SMELLS AWFUL! It honestly smells like urine. I used the Thayers brand before I decided to try this one and I will definitely go back. However it is great for your skin so I will use all of it no matter how awful the smell.</li>
    <li> I like this witch hazel brand and happy that they now provide it organically. I use it as a toner.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never bought witch hazel so I can&#x27;t compare it but it cleaned my face beautifully and pulled a lot of dirt up!  (Yuck)</li>
    <li> It does what it says!</li>
    <li> Real good stuff.  Has a clean fresh smell to it.  It dries fast on the skin too.  I especially like that it is with organic ingredients.  Good for the skin around the eyes and for applying to eczema skin symptoms for quick relief.  I don&#x27;t know what I like better the product or the cool girl&#x27;s picture on the bottle...either way it is a winner.  It comes in a plastic bottle with an  easy to open and close squirt top.</li>
    <li> This is a great quality product however the smell takes a bit of getting used to. I think next I will try it with the lavender or rose.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t find the organic in theis size, so I had to settle.&lt;br /&gt;My teenage daughter and I, use this as a toner.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t over dry and it controls shine really well.&lt;br /&gt;It really does reduce pores, and it has softened the redness and uneven skin tone for both of us.&lt;br /&gt;My daughter loves that it&#x27;s getting her acne under control as well.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used other brands in the past, and they just didn&#x27;t seem to work as well as this one.&lt;br /&gt;I really had no idea there was a difference between brands.</li>
    <li> This stuff stinks. Good thing I&#x27;m using it with essential oils and they greatly mask the smell.</li>
    <li> I only gave this 4 stars because I thought this did not contain alcohol. This bottle does.</li>
    <li> works very well but witch hazel itself does not smell good lol</li>
    <li> Great Product will be ordering it again</li>
    <li> I love using Humphrey&#x27;s Witch Hazel Astringent and happy to see that amazon has a New Humphrey&#x27;s Witch Hazel USDA certified organic but in my surprised  I received a regular Humphrey&#x27;s Witch Hazel Astringent without USDA certified organic. This is my second time I ordered this product, same problem I received an item is not as exactly in the product picture.</li>
    <li> Cooling &amp; refreshing! Your Dad used to use this, remember? And you didn&#x27;t understand why, back in the day. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOW you get it! Perfect for perking up your entire head (except the eyes!) after you shave, wash up, or just need to fire yourself up in the morning. Squirt a quarter-size puddle into your palm, spread to the other palm, and slap it around your face, your neck, the top of your head, everywhere -- it feels great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is great stuff, and yes it still has that uniquely weird smell!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended without reservation ... get a bottle today and make yourself feel good all over!</li>
    <li> The only thing I do not like is that it says it is 100% alcohol free, but it uses alcohol to extract the liquid from the witch hazel plant.</li>
    <li> Great product and shipped quickly!</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted.  It works great!</li>
    <li> Great skin cleanser and really good for use after shaving stopping any in attractive red marks.</li>
    <li> I make my own toner with this. LOVE!!!</li>
    <li> Good heavens this stuff smells. I don&#x27;t know if I am used to other witch hazel but this is not a nice smell.</li>
    <li> Such a great product!! I use it on my face as a toner. Helps to shrink pores and won&#x27;t dry out your skin!! I highly recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> It worked as advertised!</li>
    <li> Beautiful product and very pretty bottle.</li>
    <li> I pour this out on a cotton ball and apply to my face. This does clean a lot of dirt from my pores and I can also notice a reduction in acne. I recommend using this over any popular acne cream any day.</li>
    <li> Um, holy cow!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was complaining about a huge zit on my lip line that had been there for a few too many days and my roommate said I should use this. Not even 24 hours later and it&#x27;s healing nicely. I&#x27;ve noticed my overall complexion is a lot healthier/brighter looking since using this Witch Hazel! I can&#x27;t imagine what my pores&#x27;ll look like in a month after using this twice a day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forget all of the harsh chemical based products, this is the stuff you need.</li>
    <li> I love this gentle product.  I used it most recently in a homemade deodorant spray.  I will certainly buy again</li>
    <li> After moving I could no longer find Humphrey’s Organic Witch Hazel Astringent locally, I new I could count on Amazon to have it. A good price on the larger 160z size too. My face gets dry patches and witch hazel works better than any other astringent I have used. Being that it’s organic is a big plus for me!</li>
    <li> Excellent astringent for the skin.  I love it!</li>
    <li> Great quality Witch Hazel!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product!</li>
    <li> Maybe I got a bad batch?  Everyone is saying it smells so fresh and clean.  Mine smells like burnt chemicals, it&#x27;s really really strong to the point where I can barely stand applying it.  It cant possibly be the same stuff as what these other reviewers are talking about, can this stuff go bad?  It smells HORRIBLE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note:  Etailz was super helpful in processing my refund.  They agreed it could be a product defect.  They are contacting Humphreys to see if the product could \\&quot;turn\\&quot; due to heat exposure, or expire and make this horrible smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon returns wanted me to re-mail it back but I told them without the foil the bottle isnt really secure and it will leak.  I&#x27;m not even sure USPS would complete transport of a package leaking fluid that smells this rancid, or they might flag it as something toxic and send it back.  They made an acception and issued me a refund.  All in all, I&#x27;m pleased with the service I recieved from Etails and Amazon today.  I sure hope Humphreys gets back to me on why their product smells like fuel.  I was hoping to switch to a more pure product, previously used Thayers.  Oh well, I guess I gotta switch back.</li>
    <li> The bottle I received was labeled organic on the label but not on the bottle.  Incorrect labeling.</li>
    <li> not going to lie, i bought this for the label, i needed the product, picked a bottle with great marketing design.  love it still!</li>
    <li> I just purchased Humphrey&#x27;s Organic Witch Hazel Astringent for the first time a month ago. I have NEVER been able to use toners (Clinique, Cindy Crawfords&#x27; Meaningful Beauty, etc) on my face because they irritated my face horribly. I received a recipe for toner which had Humphreys Witch Hazel in it and it has  been amazing. No irritation and has really improved the toning of my face. I am 50 yo and I give Humphrey&#x27;s Organic Witch Hazel 5 stars because it deserves it. NO complaints on my end!!!</li>
    <li> The reason why I bought this is because it supposed to be organic. The one I received was NOT organic. I&#x27;m Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Best toner I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s so gentle and effective that I&#x27;ve stopped washing my face with cleanser. I simply rinse with water and apply this product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for using on my hands when Im gardening.. To protect them from germs in my cuts and scratches.</li>
