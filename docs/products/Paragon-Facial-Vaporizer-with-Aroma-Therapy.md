<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I got got this machine and have used it twice already.  I love this little machine, small but power.  It has a safety flip on the sides to protect you from getting burn from the heat cup.  I used other machines before, this is the best.  It heats up fast, and will turn off if the water gets too low.  Just remember to use distill water as directed to avoid mineral build up.  Great product, if you are looking for one, this is it.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and great product for have a facial at home.....but not much instruction on the Ozone....</li>
    <li> This is a great steamer. My friend is a professional in Europe and she used mine on me and said this is the same that they use in Europe. It is great for the price. I love it highly recommend</li>
    <li> I ordered this product in December of 2011 it&#x27;s been about a month since then. I have used it 3 times. The first time, there was some plastic smell but letting the steam run for a few minutes cleared up the problem. Also, to avoid any risk of the water bubbling out of the jet (like some reviewers said but I have not experienced any such thing), you can let the steam flow for a minute before directing the stem of the steamer on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is much better than those old fashioned steamers where the power of the steam is not strong or you have to put your face pretty much in that small attachment. This product can be placed on any flat surface and the stem/arm of the steamer can be rotated&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good product, I&#x27;d definitely recommend it. Works well.</li>
    <li> impressive machine!!!! i must say it is very powerful for its size. i have used many steamers in the past including conair, and those large ones at the pro stores but this one is actually just as good as the pros. the only flaw in the makeup is that the head does not easily move in order to get full facial coverage. but it can be done but not as freely as i expected. great product tho</li>
    <li> The steamer just arrived and i used it for the first time.(Its better to leave the unit working alone for some minutes before using on your face for the first time as it helps to rinse and to leave-off the kinda new-plastic odour) i added water upto the halfway and after a few minutes steam started to come out. Fine steam comes more thickly if you switch \\&quot;ON\\&quot; the Ozone switch. the steamer also has an auto-cutoff feature (dont know it detects water level or the temperature),it went off when my water level was below the low line. it makes a continuous beeping sound then. I switched off the unit for 5 minutes and added more water upto the high level and its again ready for another session!.i ordered the stuff after many search in vain for a Japan made steamer (guess the whole world lives on China things nowadays- Even Panasonic and Sanyo thingies are nowadays made in China!! um.). Though the unit is made in China it seems a good one for the price. The extension hand through where the steam comes out is very much adjustable (clockwise/counterclockwise) and you also can add aroma oils on the supplied strips (to be attached on the steamer hand) with the unit.Your hands will also be protected by the cool protective cover over the removable water jar which is hot during operation (always check for this feature if you are looking for other makes!!). Read the product manual first. ALSO I WILL BE REPORTING HERE IF I FIND ANY SNAGS WITH THE UNIT. So far, the only small dissatisfying thing about this steamer is about its USER Manual. it doesnt say all these details i said above like the auto-cutoff feature!! Good luck guys. Thanks. Rgds.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this steamer a total of 7 times. The steamer itself is awesome and I love how its small and portable.  The only disadvantage is the length of the arm.  Its too short.  I haven&#x27;t figured out a good way to place it where its comfortable for the person that I&#x27;m working on.  Its either too far or too close. The advantages would be the size, steams very fast, and the aromatherapy slot.</li>
    <li> This item is amazing. Works real well. For anybody that does facials for a living, this little machine works wonders.</li>
    <li> I purchased the steamer since I have doing facials at home for my clients. It is a great steamer. It distributes the steam very fine and evenly. It only takes about 3 minutes to get the steam going. I love the product. I would higly recommend this product to anyone who wants a portable petite steamer.</li>
    <li> Good steamer for the price. I purchased another from sally&#x27;s beauty supply to compare the two and this one is the better one of the two. I ended up returning the other one. The only complaint I have is the arm should be longer. Other than that, it is very nice.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product about a week ago, and I&#x27;ve gotta say it&#x27;s pretty darn good. Wasn&#x27;t too sure if such a little machine could produce a nice amount of steam, but it definitely does. My face was covered with sweat in minutes, which meant clearer pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I origionally purchased a Vicks steamer/inhaler to clear my sinuses, but I can see that this product will have me put that Vicks steamer in the back of the cabinet. I will be adding Apple Cider Vinegar as well as Hydrogen Peroxide to this unit to help with clearer nasal passages / lungs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for disassembly - I was kinda puzzled as to how I could take off the steamer arm without damaging the unit. I called the company ( the website is listed on the instruction manual ), a nice woman name Sina picked up and gave me great advice with a great attitude. Nice job Paragon, I&#x27;m a a believer in your product and company.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good enough for the price.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not as strong as I&#x27;d like it to be but it still does its job. One thing I didn&#x27;t like was the smell it emitted when I turned on the ion.</li>
    <li> We use this in the spa to replace the broken steamer of the multi-function facial machine. It works out except we need to add water more frequently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works well with no problem.</li>
    <li> I bought this facial steamer for my wife for Christmas. We tried it out and were very pleased with the steam treatment that she got. The steam lasted for roughly 15 minutes. I&#x27;ve even used it to loosen the hairs on my face to get a closer shave. I would reccomend this product. I don&#x27;t know anything about salon style steamers or anything like that, but I am pleased with the results from the Paragon Petite.</li>
    <li> I used it once since I purchased it. So far it&#x27;s been super good. I&#x27;ve always like the vaporizer in the spa treatments so being to be able to do it at home is really nice.</li>
    <li> It was well over due to have a modern looking facial steamer and a move away from the older design of dunking our face downwards! So after many years of holding back from buying one, I took the plunge and purchased this model after much research and reading opinions shared by many on this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the great feature of this product is that the white part of the extension can be rotated to adjust for the body height! So you are not straining your neck to position it infront of the steam.  This is a huge plus as it made the whole experience very relaxing!  Added, there is a slot to place a small spunge (supplied) that you can soak some aromatherapy oil - just so relaxing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The steam is magnificent!  I do recommend that you let the steam run for about a minute before you place your face over it: for the first few times, there was a &#x27;plastic&#x27; smell, but went away after a minute of running.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read the instructions and note that it does point out to allow the boiling water to cool down on its own and do not add cold water incase it contracts the pot too quickly (and hence the cracking experienced by a previous reviewer?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to use and to put together.</li>
    <li> I guess there&#x27;s nothing worse than expediting a product to have it arrive and not turn on. The instructions are vague and it took me a good while to figure out it was broken and it wasn&#x27;t user error.  Amazon is shipping me another - but alas - a day late and a dollar short. This is the risk with online shopping I guess.</li>
    <li> I got this based on the reviews to equip my slowly developing home facial spa. Turn the unit on and when it is boiling, turn on the Ozone switch and it delivers great thick steam with no spitting of water. It&#x27;s correct to let it boil off a bit the first time to get rid of the oils from the new machine and the plastic smell quickly dissipates. Add your favorite aromatherapy oil to the little foam piece that inserts into a slot to add an element of pampering. It does come with a brochure that has basic directions and there really isn&#x27;t much to it to require a whole manual which seems to be a concern a few reviewers. The jar has a line to indicate the maximum amount of water to put into it and the rest is rather self-explanatory. It&#x27;s true that the arm could be a little longer but it rotates freely so makes it easy enough to aim the steam where you want it if  set around 2 feet away. I set it next to the sink while deep cleaning my face or on a table close by if laying down. Great unit for the price and functionality and I highly recommend it to anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to spend too much on a steamer yet wants it to work well.</li>
    <li> This item worked great the first time I used it but after that it would not work.  Maybe, mine was the exception.</li>
    <li> I purchased this steamer for my children. Their dermatologist recommended a facial steamer to help with their acne. I wanted one that had an arm and you could rotate and not just put your face into so you could use on various parts of your body.&lt;br /&gt;My children, love it and I have seen great results from it on both of them. I highly recommend it. The only issue, I have is this unit did not come with any directions.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a make up/ skincare junkie... I decided I had so many products that I should start giving myself facials... This is a great little steamer... It has a safety thing where it won&#x27;t work if it isn&#x27;t on a solid surface  I had it on the carpet and thought it was broken as it wouldn&#x27;t turn on... Once I put a tray under it it worked!).  I would def rec this... Only reason I didn&#x27;t give five stars is it would be nice if the arm was longer so I could lay on the floor  with a pillow) and easily move the arm into position.</li>
    <li> Previously, I was spending $120/ month on getting facials.  That&#x27;s over $1200 a year.  After I got this, I can now do at home facials which cost me a few cents for the distilled water that goes in to this handy little steamer.  The steam comes out strong and the arm swivels so I can move it to where I want.  Now I can steam my face once a week and have noticed my skin looks and feels healthier.</li>
    <li> I am pleased to say that this facial steamer works very well. It was a good investment and a good decision to purchase it. I recommend it to anyone looking for a good facial steamer.</li>
    <li> Great little machine.  But I give it a 4 instead of 5 star because the Ionizing light that makes the steam function work seems to blink and tends to go on and off. Maybe the light needs to be replaced. I do use the Ionizing function a lot so I&#x27;m not happy this is happening.</li>
    <li> I steam my face every two weeks with this face steamer and it is by far the best one on the market. Easy to use and it shoots a steady stream of steam😌🛀</li>
    <li> It is a nice product it does help my pore open and easy to clean up the black head and white head, but it stops working after the first use. have to return it , im glad I got from amazon :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;updated 5/4: I ordered another brand steamer, comparing with this one, I would say this is one is much better, it gives a lot more steam. I just wish it would last longer :(</li>
    <li> The manual and product description was very poor.  I only use once, it seems to do its job, but when I tried the 2nd time, it beeped 3 times then the machine shut down by itself.  I had to return it.  It is a very cheap looking and not funciioning as it should.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s size works well in a tight space, but it still has &amp;#34;plastic&amp;#34; smell after several uses.</li>
    <li> this works great, heats up quickly, very easy to use.  I just wish the steam arm was a bit longer.</li>
    <li> perfect for giving yourself your very own facials, Very easy to use and not too big or too small.  Works better then other similar items i have purchased.</li>
    <li> I love this awesome steamer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, let me say that I can see a big difference in my skin when I use it. It makes it nice and soft with a little glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Takes just a minute or two to heat up - and the steam lasts for a good 15/20 min.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a note like others have said: There is a slight plastic smell when you first use it, so i recommend doing an entire cycle before use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only downfall: I wish water container was actually glass. The fact that is is only plastic concerns me with long-term use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall WONDERFUL product. Buy it. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I really like that the steam is very strong. I can get steam for approximately 10 minutes. It automatically shuts off when the water (distilled only) level reaches a certain level. Sometimes have difficulty in placing the water cup. The price is now $70.00 compared to when I paid $65.00 in 2012! that&#x27;s how long i have had it and so far no issues.</li>
    <li> Stopped working after 30 days. TRYING to get a refund.</li>
    <li> This is a nice small portable steamer. I like the ozone feature and the optional place for aromatherapy. It only runs for about 15 minutes or less before you run out of water and it makes a loud beep and turns off. However, for the price and the size I believe it is a very good steamer.</li>
    <li> This is one of those products that does its basic job well, but doesn&#x27;t reach its potential.&lt;br /&gt;1. Assembly itself is not complicated, but assembly instructions were not clear.&lt;br /&gt;2. Not easy to pour water quickly -- a larger intake hole would have taken care of the problem.&lt;br /&gt;3. It takes a few tries to get the water cup in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope that the manufacturer fixes these simple problems in their next version of the product.</li>
    <li> After long survey, i bought this item. Its worth &amp; really wonderful gadget.&lt;br /&gt;Since it is the health care product, finishing &amp; the design is beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;If the manufacturer can make this product compatible to 220-240 Volt lot buyers from Middle east, Asian countries will use this product without spending extra money on buying Voltage converters.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line is its worth &amp; useful item.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome.  I got it because i am in school to become a skin therapist and wanted to be able to give myself proper facials at home and have it available if i want to practice at home on friends and family.  It works fantastically and has really helped me do proper extractions (blackhead removal)to clear up my skin and I&#x27;m sure with some finagling i can angle it toward someone receiving a practice facial from me. I love the optional Ozone button (this helps kill bacteria if you have acneic skin, and should only be used for about 5 mins). The arm does move in a circle (but not up/down) and the tip rotates around the arm to control where the steam comes out.  It has a tip-over shutoff switch on the bottom for safety.  It is made of plastic so you don&#x27;t have to be so concerned with burning yourself.  It also has a low water level alarm that sounds to let you know it needs more water. It comes with aromatherapy strips but i haven&#x27;t&#x27; used them yet. It&#x27;s everything i expected and works wonders. Also, just a tip i learned at school: water needs to stay between the minimum and maximum water lines or you risk your product breaking, or spitting boiling water out the tip...all steamers are like this so just be aware.  And only used distilled water.</li>
    <li> I ordered this and was excited to have it arrive.  The order was delayed but finally came.  When I opened the box, all the parts were missing including the manual.  How could someone miss that in quality control?  Some of the reviews had similar experiences so this is not an isolated situation.  I will try one more time because most of the reviews are favorable.</li>
    <li> Pros:  Produces tons of steam for about as long as I would want to steam my face.  It heats up to a boil rather fast.  I use distilled water so it smells so fresh and moisturizing as compared to my chlorinated city water.  Rests sturdily on the counter and stores fairly compact with removal of wand.  The wand seals well and concentrates steam out the tip for focused steam.  Good value for the price.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  Beaker is tricky to screw up and in so I&#x27;m glad it is not glass because I fear it would break while screwing in and create a safety issue.  Water tank seems to back up while filling so you have to fill it slow &amp; then is seems like a tad never really goes down and I think it&#x27;s an air pressure issue perhaps with drain being too small.</li>
    <li> I used this little guy last night and it was better than expected. The steam comes out strong and the temperature is perfect and is very much like a professional steam with an aesthetician.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a steamer to use on a weekly basis, look elsewhere.  I used this steamer a few times a week, and although I followed the instructions, I guess I burned it out.  After two months it was just atomizing warmish water, not creating actual steam.</li>
    <li> The Paragon Facial Vaporizer with Aroma Therapy, in my opinion is a must have for every beauty routine. I initially was looking for a product that would help with locking moisture into my skin. After some through research, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. The Paragon Facial Vaporizer is not only a moisturizing aid, but it also cleanses deep into your skin, opening up your pours for a more through cleaning. My skin felt pure and absolutely amazing after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;Over all, the Paragon Facial Vaporizer has so many benefits that it will start to pay for itself after the first use. Naturally moisturized skin, clearer and brighter skin wit the aid of the UV light, and it also aids in clearing sinuses. It&#x27;s absolutely fantastic and it&#x27;s a must have for every bathroom!</li>
    <li> Awesome Amazing Perfect and Convenient - gives out plenty of steam, very adjustable as far as direction for  stream bc you can turn the tip, and has counter safety - it&#x27;s great</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m disappointed because In the arm, covering tab of strip aromatherapy slides, will not remain closed! I didn´t use yet.</li>
    <li> Get ready to love this little facial steamer!  Convenient to use with easy to follow instructions, this compact gem works just like the professional ones in the day spas. It puts out a wonderful, fine mist that helps keep the winter dryness away while giving you a nice plump glow.  It also works well for helping to open up the sinuses, and has a place to put aromatherapy oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a reasonable price, I give this product a &#x27;thumbs up&#x27;!</li>
    <li> This is a great portable steamer for home use.  I work as an aesthetician and wanted a steamer for my own personal use at home.  This little thing is perfect.  It has the same amount of power as the proffessional steamer I use at work and it&#x27;s small enough to store under the bathroom sink.  I&#x27;ve already convinced half of the women in the doctors office I work at to purchase one and they all love it as well!</li>
    <li> I am giving this product 3 stars because the steam is excellent. It is a strong and fine mist of steam, but the plastic jar cracked in two different places after the second day of use. I don&#x27;t know if it is because the hot water cracked the jar or if it is cheaply made. I returned the product and I am still awaiting my refund! If you are going to get a home facial steamer...get one with a glass jar!</li>
    <li> What a disappointment this is the 2nd one I&#x27;ve tried, it started heating up the water and then within 30 seconds there was a loud spark and it stopped working.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for a friend who is an aesthetician.  She commented that it works great!  Would highly recommend this to anyone in need of a facial machine.</li>
    <li> Well imagine my disappointment when after waiting two weeks for this steamer to arrive it not only had a giant crack in the plastic jar but also the aroma therapy window keeps sliding and won&#x27;t stay closed. I&#x27;m planning to exchange it in hopes that this was just a factory defect, but if it comes broken again I&#x27;ll be getting a refund. I knew a plastic jar would be a gamble, but it would have be nice to at least get the chance to break it myself. I&#x27;ll be updating this review once the new one comes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE&lt;br /&gt;Well thanks to Amazon&#x27;s excellent customer service I was able to get my new vaporizer shipped priority. It arrived two days after I made the call without having to wait until they received the returned one. And thank goodness this one isn&#x27;t broken! I&#x27;m very pleased to say that I used it and it works beautifully. It only took about 6 minutes to heat up all the way, the ozone steam was luxurious, and absolutely no sputtering or spitting. I&#x27;m meticulous about only using distilled water and taking it apart after every use so everything has a chance to dry so I&#x27;m confident that it will stay nice for a long time. The only complaint I have is that the little aroma therapy window still doesn&#x27;t stay closed very tightly, but for the price of this unit I&#x27;m not above fastening it with a rubber band. Also I love the burn guards. It&#x27;s a nice added feature, as well as the auto shut off.  As a new esthetician I&#x27;m happy to have this in my arsenal.</li>
    <li> Great product had it for years. Just don&#x27;t over use it or your face gets too dehydrated</li>
    <li> Working fine so far. The machine shuts off once the water bin is half full... Not sure why it does that.  Will keep updated.</li>
    <li> great product. i have been using it every week. makes my skin soft and clean. i would recommend anyone whose looking for a good steamer to get this</li>
    <li> simply the best steamer i have use better than steam facial by kaz. it put out a powerful steam,dont let the size fool you,I highly recommend this steamer, I love it so much i&#x27;m going to buy another one, just to have it incase of any accidental that could happen. i had purchase mine for 50.00 dollars include shipping from a spa store. buy it you wont regret it.</li>
    <li> Very good item. Wish the hand was longer but everything else is great. Saves tons of money doing facials yourself.</li>
    <li> For such a small machine compared to the proffesional ones, this one really steams up a whole bunch and yet it does NOT burn your face. I simply love it. Been having weekly facials ever sincce I got it. Wont have to pay for another facial ever again. Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I love this unit and I have been on amazon so long and I never review but this deserves it. The reviews are all true!  Not a big writer but I&#x27;ve tried other facial steamers and love facials but this is truly the best facial I have ever had and I had it at home!  If your contemplating or researching others. Don&#x27;t!  This is the one!</li>
    <li> I feel bad writing a review if I simply received a defective product, but it is frustrating to wait for the item, receive it, put it together, and have nothing happen.  After everything was attached, I turned the unit on expecting a green light.  No light in sight.  I heard a series of very loud beeps, which I thought meant the product would be heating up and possibly just had a defective light.  I waited for quite sometime and no heat came.  I also tried 3 different outlets, just in case.  I&#x27;m returning and exchanging, because I would really like a working unit.  If the next one works, I will happily amend my review!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**** REVIEW OF NEW, WORKING MODEL ****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a replacement, working unit 2 days after the first broken one.  The power light turned on immediately - no problems.  I have used the unit 4 times in the last 3 days.  The steam takes approx. 4-5 minutes to generate.  It&#x27;s smooth and, I felt, perfectly distributed.  The unit has an automatic shut-off when the water reaches it&#x27;s \\&quot;minimum\\&quot; mark.  I don&#x27;t think it said that in the instructions, but the water level indicator is visible.  I&#x27;ve found the ideal placement to be on a vanity table top to use while seated.  I would recommend the product and hope none of you receive a defective model.</li>
    <li> Great but does beep very loud when out of water. Great for at home use. Would buy again and recommend</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised with this product. It seems to work well and is compact and well designed.  The User&#x27;s Manual leaves a lot to be desired however. You must use Distilled water which makes sense, but there is no mention in the manual regarding how to pour out the remaining water! - The water reservoir does not detach from unit because of the heating element. The machine will turn itself off when the water reaches the minimal level, but any remaining water stays in the machine! -  It seems that you cannot empty out OR clean the water reservoir at all!  This presents a sanitary issue for me - how long do you want the remaining water to sit in the machine? - You have no choice but to add more water the next time you use it - so you are mixing fresh water with old water - a design flaw!  I&#x27;m wondering if their professional line of vaporizers can be emptied and cleaned? -</li>
    <li> I just got this yesterday. Upon taking it out of the box, I thought this unit was not going to make enough steam. Well, I was wrong. This steamer really puts out A LOT of steam.  Definitely worth the money. On the down side, when you first use the unit there is a slight plastic smell to the steam. The unit itself could be made a little better but it is worth the $70 bucks on the steam ouput alone.</li>
    <li> It was for my wife, fits the requirement and she was so happy.  Good quality and swift shipping on time.</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT IN AUGUST 29th 2014 AND TODAY IS DEC 19 2014 AND THIS PRODUCT IS ALREADY NOT WORKING !!!! I AM VERY UPSET WITH THIS PRODUCT !!!!</li>
    <li> First time i use that crash ,is broken now.i put water on it and i was that work ,in 15 min i hear bum,was broken.dont have possibility  to return because i am  far away from their business</li>
    <li> Cracked and is leaking and used 3 times. Cheap make that can withstand heat.</li>
    <li> My only recommendation is that the slider on the steam arm where you put the little filter for aromatherapy does not hold.. it slides down and doesn&#x27;t lock in place to hold the paper filter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise great little product.</li>
    <li> I love the way my skin looks after using this product.  I use it 1-2 times a week.  Not sure if this makes a difference, but I only use distilled water since that&#x27;s what the directions say.  I never have to worry about hot water spitting in my face; just pure steam comes out of this machine.</li>
    <li> My beaker broke, it&#x27;s the FS-54 type. Does anyone know where I can contact to get a new jar? Edit | Delete</li>
    <li> The product is good for using at home, only thing I have noticed is the steam is not as strong as I was expecting it to be. Will be trying to return this to get a better face steamer.</li>
    <li> I use this weekly to help my skin stay healthy.  It is easy to use although the pot that holds the water is a little difficult to remove and replace for cleaning, but once you understand it, there is no problem.  The machine didn&#x27;t have any instructions with it, which I found a little odd.  I do love it though!  It is just a mini version of the steamers that the estheticians use when giving a facial.  It is perfect for keeping your skin hydrated in between facials.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll start off with I&#x27;m a 28yr old male with light acne and blackheads. Used to visit the spa and get facials every now and then because they were great at removing blackheads, ect. Bought this hoping I could get the same results at home. Purchased on saturday afternoon and received monday afternoon with standard shipping. Used the product 5 times now. Great build quality, materials, and performs exactly as it should. Works great and it saves me from having to go to the spa. Only suggestion is to run a full steam through it when it first arrives because the first run smelled like plastic. Was gone by third use. Great purchase!</li>
    <li> I JUST USED LESS THAN 3 MINS - A SPARK HIT, AND IT IS NOT WORKING WASTE OF MONEY</li>
    <li> This worked fine the first two times I used it but now it won&#x27;t operate at all. Obviously not a reliable product.</li>
    <li> Great steamer. The steam seems to be very micronized and my skin absorbs and hydrates well. However I have it a four because the ozone light started flickering after four uses</li>
    <li> This is a really good facial steamer. I would pay $110 for a facial at spa so $70 for a 2 -3 year investment made sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I rate this 3 start is not because of the quality of the steam. The steam is great! Its fine, dense and strong. The steamer will steam up your face nicely. Also have used this when I have a cold/stuffy nose to breathe in the air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only CON is the steam tube. I needs to be longer and have more options for adjustments (move top/down). All it has is a rotating head which is not sufficient. Its really hard to put in word how difficult its to adjust the steam tube.I have used this for 3 months now and I just gave up on lying down on bed and getting my face steamed. I now just sit in front of the steamer and get my face steamed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The aromatherapy insert frankly is just a joke. Just put a drop in the essential oil on your hands and rub it all around and place the hands in front of the steamer. That is what I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product but I want to set your expectations on the difficulty of the steam arm.</li>
    <li> I loved it. It&#x27;s one of the best steamers I&#x27;ve ever used. My clients like it as well ! Great buy!</li>
    <li> My wife loves it and uses it at least once daily.</li>
    <li> hello, this came to me as I expected perfect recommend this item and this shop. will apologize for my English is not good</li>
