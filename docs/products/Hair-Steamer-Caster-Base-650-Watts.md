      <li>successfully-</li>
      <li>Good investment .</li>
      <li>I have one of the best hooded driers money can buy, but must say it gets really hot where sometimes</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very happy, it does exactly what I hoped it would do.</li>
      <li>When it worked, it worked great and it was easy to put together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This hair steamer is amazing.</li>
      <li>Fast shipment good quality, works great</li>
      <li>I will not go as far to say my absorption issues have resolved, but I will say the improvement is impressive.</li>
      <li>, I am glad I purchased this brand of steamer.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m retaining more moisture than ever.</li>
      <li>Absolutely Love it/</li>
      <li>I was sure to read the reviews thoroughly because I wanted to insure that I was purchasing a quality steamer.</li>
      <li>I can roll this steamer up to my favorite chair, adjust the height, and &#x27;steam on&#x27;.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll need to use it more to determine whether it&#x27;s a problem.</li>
      <li>The steamer is okay.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Similar to what others have stated the assembly instructions could have been better.</li>
      <li>really enjoyed the steamer during the 2.5 times it worked</li>
      <li>Hair steaming seemed to be one of those things that would lift the hair follicle thus allowing for greater absorption of conditioners, moisturizers, etc.</li>
      <li>For me,using it before is more beneficial</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to use the steamer yet, (I know, whats the hold up)</li>
      <li>.My loc&#x27;s love the moisture that is added after  </li>
      <li>and I noticed a crack in that cheap plastic, so I returned it.</li>
      <li>Easy to clean up.</li>
      <li>its worth is definitely more than its price.  </li>
      <li>and it didn&#x27;t light up</li>
      <li>Definitely worth more like $75-$80 to me.</li>
      <li>Then I rinse with cool water and set.  </li>
      <li>Was fine ar first then after Two uses started leaking and they wouldn&#x27;t replace my machine</li>
      <li>What I can say is that I did receive the steamer exactly a week later from the date ordered which is great because I ordered during the Holidays, and that the steamer is exactly as pictured.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve emailed the seller to see if they&#x27;ll be willing to replace the product free of charge.</li>
      <li>It works very well and it was easy to assemble also.</li>
      <li>I got exactly what I was looking for!</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m bummed that it&#x27;s not working; not only did I not get my $100 worth of usage, but I really liked steaming my hair and scalp!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Overall, it&#x27;s not top-of-the-line, but it&#x27;s a nice steamer that gets the job done.  </li>
      <li>It feels very soft, has more body, and very moisturized.</li>
      <li>When I first turned it on, I was looking for the Huetiful-looking steam</li>
      <li>When i first received the product, the condensation drain became unhooked</li>
      <li>The first day I used it, it started leaking and burned me.  </li>
      <li>When I first put this steamer together - without tools - it was shabby; kept leaning to one side.  </li>
      <li>Since I started using, I don&#x27;t have the &#x27;white hair&#x27; syndrome (i.e. from product sitting on top of the hair).</li>
      <li>So many people in the natural community are quick to get on board with whatever blogger they are following.</li>
      <li>It seems to actually work fine despite the cons.  </li>
      <li>Unfortunately, many expect to use the same products and expect the same results that their favorite blogger had, forgetting the entire time that they never had the hair type to achieve that look anyway.</li>
      <li>The steamer works very well on my 4c hair.  </li>
      <li>This product works very well but it does leak.  </li>
      <li>Not in the sense of lack of moisture, because when I wash it out my hair was very moisturized.</li>
      <li>With this steamer I can adjust, get my whole head steamed and it has a timer.</li>
      <li>Now it stands straight &amp; sturdy.  </li>
      <li>I really wanted this steamer to work because of the price and benefits.  </li>
      <li>I put it together and put the water in the clear container and turned it on the light red button</li>
      <li>It also began leaking in several places with very hot water.</li>
      <li>I highly recommended, and it works well for hair treatments.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this steamer.</li>
      <li>I had a hair steamer a few years ago that worked like magic.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s important for me to give these reviews, because other reviews have helped me select my products</li>
      <li>But this is not the first, nor the last product that you will have that issue with.</li>
      <li>It produces a lot of steam... which is great for my dry, thin, relaxed hair...</li>
      <li>I am black and I have been natural (i.e. chemical free hair) for 18 months.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, the steamer worked very well when it worked properly.</li>
      <li>My hair is shiny, soft and moisturized.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t like and no issues so far  </li>
      <li>Fast forward to tonight, I washed my hair and was preparing for a deep conditioning, I turned on the machine and</li>
      <li>So far, I&#x27;ve had the steamer for about a month</li>
      <li>I use it on my twins 4yr old twins as well.</li>
      <li>, I cannot imagine paying someone &#x27;extra&#x27; on top of usual salon services to have this done (unless you are hair challenged).</li>
      <li>I only gave it four stars because it looks and feels a little cheap</li>
      <li>Nevertheless, that seems to be the only problem so far as again</li>
      <li>Quality product-I&#x27;d recommend this anyone needed to place moisture back into their hair-especially if they wear it natural.</li>
      <li>So long as you are near a sink, I got it to work.</li>
      <li>I would say  that it can get a little hot at times, so I use the low heating setting.</li>
      <li>I truly hope I can get a new one, minus the defects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure if the person I had put it together did it incorrectly, but it appears to be done right.  </li>
      <li>Due to me being very busy</li>

<li> It leaves my relaxed hair ssoooooo soft and moisturized after a treatment for days, which means I have to moisturize and seal less often because my hair has been able to retain moisture...which equals no more weighed down hair!</li>
<li> I mean steam is hot</li>
<li> It works...but it leaks after long term (days) of use.</li>
<li> The headband is totally needed or you will definitely have water running down your face.</li>
<li> conditioning(DC) feel dry.</li>
<li> Btw, yes the water from the steam does drip, but I use a head band to prevent it from constantly running down my face.</li>
<li> /&gt;However, the 3rd time I used it, it began leaking like crazy and because the steam is so hot, the leaking water actually burned my back!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> Be careful if you try to pick it up while it&#x27;s leaking, you can get scalded by the water.</li>
<li> For me, the saying &amp;#34;it&#x27;s very difficult to get moisture into low porosity hair, but once it&#x27;s in, It&#x27;s In&amp;#34; has proven true.</li>
<li> The other day I tried adjusting it - again without tools - and it somehow snapped into place.  </li>
<li> All I did was wipe it down</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve also noticed less breakage since using this unit.</li>
<li> but I am a little concerned.  </li>
<li> It may be a little messy, but after all it&#x27;s water.</li>
<li> The base is a little cheap to me, but it does it&#x27;s job.</li>
<li> After few times usage&#x27;s the water was draining and leaking everywhere as soon as i put the machine on.</li>
<li> The timer doesn&#x27;t ring to indicate that it done nor does the steamer stop so its kinda pointless to have a timer.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m not really sure if it&#x27;s suppose to do that</li>
<li> Unfortunately after 4 years of use it finally died...</li>
<li> The base is pretty awkwardly shaped and cumbersome for smaller spaces.  </li>
<li> but the steamer wouldn&#x27;t steam, at least not where it was suppose to.</li>
<li> if you have seen the Huetfiul demos the glorious thick cloud of steam that comes out, does not come out like that on this model.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Due to me being very busy I haven&#x27;t been able to use the steamer yet, (I know, whats the hold up) but once I do I will come back and leave a proper review. What I can say is that I did receive the steamer exactly a week later from the date ordered which is great because I ordered during the Holidays, and that the steamer is exactly as pictured. So once again when I use, I will leave an updated review.</li>
    <li> This hair steamer is amazing. its worth is definitely more than its price.  My sisters, daughters, and I are happy with the result&gt;&gt; our hair feels healthier and shinier.  We did not have to go to a salon every two weeks for hair conditioning and nourishing.</li>
    <li> The hair steamer works great ,good price .My loc&#x27;s love the moisture that is added after  I&#x27;m done using the steamer 15 minutes.Good investment .</li>
    <li> I researched hair &#x27;steaming&#x27; awhile before I decided to purchase a steamer. I am black and I have been natural (i.e. chemical free hair) for 18 months. It wasn&#x27;t until after 1 year that I realized my hair was considered low porosity. My definition of low porosity is: hair that repels everything including water. Needless to say, I have suffered. Once I realized what the problem was I began to try to find ways to care for it. Notice I said &#x27;care for&#x27; and not &#x27;change&#x27; it. Hair steaming seemed to be one of those things that would lift the hair follicle thus allowing for greater absorption of conditioners, moisturizers, etc. To my surprise, it works!!! I believe each individual will need to tinker around with techniques to find one that suits her/him. I have used it before and after washing hair. For me,using it before is more beneficial (I think, I have used once a week for 4 weeks). I will not go as far to say my absorption issues have resolved, but I will say the improvement is impressive. Since I started using, I don&#x27;t have the &#x27;white hair&#x27; syndrome (i.e. from product sitting on top of the hair). Products that used to flake don&#x27;t anymore. My hair is moisturized and has body and movement!! Yay! I&#x27;m retaining more moisture than ever. For me, the saying &amp;#34;it&#x27;s very difficult to get moisture into low porosity hair, but once it&#x27;s in, It&#x27;s In&amp;#34; has proven true. But only after I started using the hair steamer. I know all types of people (different ethnicities and hair types) that utilize steaming. I haven&#x27;t met anyone who feels like this process is useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On another note, I am glad I purchased this brand of steamer. I like that I can roll this steamer up to my favorite chair, adjust the height, and &#x27;steam on&#x27;. I will say to those considering another brand like Huetiful...if you have seen the Huetfiul demos the glorious thick cloud of steam that comes out, does not come out like that on this model. When I first turned it on, I was looking for the Huetiful-looking steam and I didn&#x27;t think it was working properly. But honey it steams, all over, and the job gets done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Similar to what others have stated the assembly instructions could have been better. I know I had to improvise 2-3 steps. Seriously. But this is not the first, nor the last product that you will have that issue with. I don&#x27;t have any issues with drippage from the unit or being burned. I mean steam is hot so I would like to hope that everyone covers the neck/shoulders with a towel. The headband is totally needed or you will definitely have water running down your face. Otherwise, this is a great investment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, I cannot imagine paying someone &#x27;extra&#x27; on top of usual salon services to have this done (unless you are hair challenged). If you are paying to have this done at the salon, it will pay for itself in 3-4 visits. I will reiterate, tinker with your technique if you are not satisfied with the first use. So many people in the natural community are quick to get on board with whatever blogger they are following. Unfortunately, many expect to use the same products and expect the same results that their favorite blogger had, forgetting the entire time that they never had the hair type to achieve that look anyway. The only thing that I have tried that has worked for my hair is this steamer and Eco-Styler gel. Find your routine!!!</li>
    <li> The steamer is okay. It smells like its burning after using.  The timer doesn&#x27;t ring to indicate that it done nor does the steamer stop so its kinda pointless to have a timer.  The base is pretty awkwardly shaped and cumbersome for smaller spaces.  It seems to actually work fine despite the cons.  The assembly was basic and the parts are subpar.  Definitely worth more like $75-$80 to me. But it will work for what I need it flr</li>
    <li> My steamer is not working  . I put it together and put the water in the clear container and turned it on the light red button and it didn&#x27;t light up and no steam came out .</li>
    <li> Steaming has made such a big difference in the look and feel of my hair.  When I first put this steamer together - without tools - it was shabby; kept leaning to one side.  I was going to return it, but didn&#x27;t feel like packing it back up. So I kept using it.  The other day I tried adjusting it - again without tools - and it somehow snapped into place.  Now it stands straight &amp; sturdy.  But the wheels are NOT great, and make moving it around a bit tough. Overall, it&#x27;s not top-of-the-line, but it&#x27;s a nice steamer that gets the job done.  I&#x27;ve used it about 5 times in the month I&#x27;ve had it - 20 minutes with a conditioner on, after shampoo.  Then I rinse with cool water and set.  My hair is shiny, soft and moisturized.  I would actually give this 3.5 stars, but didn&#x27;t know how.</li>
    <li> Product came on time and it is wonderful. I have used this machine several time and have not had any problems yet. Let&#x27;s just keep our fingers crossed and hope that I don&#x27;t encounter any.</li>
    <li> This product works very well but it does leak.  I&#x27;m not really sure if it&#x27;s suppose to do that but I am a little concerned.  I&#x27;ll need to use it more to determine whether it&#x27;s a problem.</li>
    <li> I got exactly what I was looking for! It works very well and it was easy to assemble also. I highly recommended, and it works well for hair treatments.</li>
    <li> I bought this steamer almost 6 months ago. After few times usage&#x27;s the water was draining and leaking everywhere as soon as i put the machine on. I&#x27;m very disappointed. I&#x27;ve contacted the seller, and has only 90 days warranty.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this unit for a month now, and have used it once a week for my deep conditions. I ♥ IT!!!!!! It leaves my relaxed hair ssoooooo soft and moisturized after a treatment for days, which means I have to moisturize and seal less often because my hair has been able to retain moisture...which equals no more weighed down hair! I&#x27;ve also noticed less breakage since using this unit. It arrived in just a few days after ordering, and generates a lot of steam and my WHOLE head is treated because of having a deep bowl. I&#x27;m very happy, it does exactly what I hoped it would do.</li>
    <li> When it worked, it worked great and it was easy to put together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the 3rd time I used it, it began leaking like crazy and because the steam is so hot, the leaking water actually burned my back!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I draped two towels over me the 4th time I went to use it- I wanted to avoid being burned again in case it leaked- but the steamer wouldn&#x27;t steam, at least not where it was suppose to. The steam came from everywhere but inside of the hood. It also began leaking in several places with very hot water. Which is why I had to give 3 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really enjoyed the steamer during the 2.5 times it worked successfully- and I&#x27;m bummed that it&#x27;s not working; not only did I not get my $100 worth of usage, but I really liked steaming my hair and scalp!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve emailed the seller to see if they&#x27;ll be willing to replace the product free of charge. I am waiting for a response. Will update at that time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the steamer worked very well when it worked properly. I truly hope I can get a new one, minus the defects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**update**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spoke with customer service. Said I couldn&#x27;t return the steamer because I was outside of the 30 day window, however, they offered to send me a replacement head, which they did, overnighted via FedEx. I&#x27;m back to streaming baby!! I hope this one doesn&#x27;t stop working.</li>
    <li> I would definitely recommend this product! So far, I&#x27;ve had the steamer for about a month and I&#x27;ve noticed the difference in my hair. It feels very soft, has more body, and very moisturized. I would say  that it can get a little hot at times, so I use the low heating setting. Otherwise, I have no complaints!</li>
    <li> Life saver! I bought the Heutiful hair steamer and after one use it cracked. All I did was wipe it down and I noticed a crack in that cheap plastic, so I returned it. Not only that, its not adjustable and doesn&#x27;t steam your entire head. With this steamer I can adjust, get my whole head steamed and it has a timer. Some times I find myself doing work on my PC while steaming. Highly recommend this steamer.</li>
    <li> Absolutely Love it/Quality product-I&#x27;d recommend this anyone needed to place moisture back into their hair-especially if they wear it natural.</li>
    <li> I have one of the best hooded driers money can buy, but must say it gets really hot where sometimes my hair while deep conditioning(DC) feel dry. Not in the sense of lack of moisture, because when I wash it out my hair was very moisturized. However, I felt like hair driers were for drying hair, not for doing DCs, so did some research and found out about this steamer. It&#x27;s a must have if you are trying yo restore your hair to  health. My hair is relaxed, bleached, and permanently colored. Therefore, any extra moisture is always welcomed. Well I&#x27;m done looking thus sealed the deal for me. It&#x27;s important for me to give these reviews, because other reviews have helped me select my products and I&#x27;m grateful for that. Hope my review helps. Btw, yes the water from the steam does drip, but I use a head band to prevent it from constantly running down my face. It may be a little messy, but after all it&#x27;s water. Easy to clean up. The base is a little cheap to me, but it does it&#x27;s job.</li>
    <li> It works...but it leaks after long term (days) of use. So long as you are near a sink, I got it to work. It produces a lot of steam... which is great for my dry, thin, relaxed hair... but unfortunately, it can produce a mess. Be careful if you try to pick it up while it&#x27;s leaking, you can get scalded by the water. Maybe use it with extra towels around... that&#x27;s an option.</li>
    <li> I bought this steamer almost a year ago and I must say that it took some work on my part. When i first received the product, the condensation drain became unhooked so I had to manually reconnect the  hose. I&#x27;ve used the product several times and haven&#x27;t had bad results. I go to use the product again, this being maybe my 6th time using it, and water was draining and leaking everywhere as soon as I put it in the machine it&#x27;s all over the floor everywhere. Not to mention the fact that I can&#x27;t even steam my hair. I really wanted this steamer to work because of the price and benefits.  I&#x27;m very disappointed. I&#x27;ve contacted the seller,  but this way over priced.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this hair steamer. I only gave it four stars because it looks and feels a little cheap but it gets the job done. Also, it is a little annoying filling and emptying the water out of it.</li>
    <li> The steamer works very well on my 4c hair.  I use it on my twins 4yr old twins as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m extremely disappointed in this product. I had a hair steamer a few years ago that worked like magic. Unfortunately after 4 years of use it finally died... I was sure to read the reviews thoroughly because I wanted to insure that I was purchasing a quality steamer. Fast forward to tonight, I washed my hair and was preparing for a deep conditioning, I turned on the machine and ALL of the water poured out of the bottom and not one once of steam appeared in the hood of the steamer... I do not recommend this product!!!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t like and no issues so far  and I use it aprox 2 times a week. No complaints.</li>
    <li> Fast shipment good quality, works great</li>
    <li> The first day I used it, it started leaking and burned me.  I&#x27;m not sure if the person I had put it together did it incorrectly, but it appears to be done right.  Nevertheless, that seems to be the only problem so far as again I only used it once.  Otherwise I like it besides the drip, drip, drip.</li>
    <li> Was fine ar first then after Two uses started leaking and they wouldn&#x27;t replace my machine</li>
