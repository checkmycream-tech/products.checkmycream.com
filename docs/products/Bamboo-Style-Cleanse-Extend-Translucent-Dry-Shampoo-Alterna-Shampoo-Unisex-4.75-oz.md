      <li>But overall great product!</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I love how my husband and I can use it.</li>
      <li>A more environmentally friendly spray bottle would be nice though.</li>
      <li>best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>IMHO, this is the best dry shampoo out there.</li>
      <li>One of the best dry shampoos I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>This is the best dry shampoo.</li>
      <li>Best dry shampoo ever</li>
      <li>The best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>best dry shampoo out there!  </li>
      <li>This is the best dry shampoo I have used!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think it works any better than the cheap Suave brand though.</li>
      <li>Easy to use -</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve also gotten many more uses out of one bottle than I expected, making it a great value.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s nice for a boost about day 3 or 4 when the roots start to get pretty shiny compared to the rest of the hair.  </li>
      <li>This product leaves my hair SO full of static, that I can&#x27;t use it.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Alterna Bamboo style dry shampoo is a very good product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found it works best if you put it on the night before, with maybe a slight touchup in the morning.</li>
      <li>I have lots of fine blond hair, and my hair gets greasy looking after 1 day.</li>
      <li>Works great with no white powder look.</li>
      <li>so I was excited.</li>
      <li>I still use it frequently but more because of lack of a better product at this time...</li>
      <li>My husband has actually complimented me on how good my hair smells without prompting when I use it.</li>
      <li>I use this on the second day and my hair looks as good as it did the day before.</li>
      <li>This is the best one so far, but be warned that if you go overboard, you will still be able to see it.  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;ve never used dry shampoo before, this would be a good one to try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
      <li>However, I think the quality is worth it.</li>
      <li>This is by far my favorite.  </li>
      <li>It has a nice smell and does not leave a white residue.</li>
      <li>Use a very light hand and you may be able to get away with it in dark hair...</li>
      <li>This lets you not dry out your hair more just to wash the roots.  </li>
      <li>This is the best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever tried, hands down.  </li>
      <li>this was recommended by hair stylist for boosting volume and giving more manageability to super fine but thick hair that tends to just fall flat under its own weight...  </li>
      <li>Not the best for absorbing oils, but definitely give hair a little va-voom.</li>
      <li>so you have to make sure you use your hand to spread it around after you spray or there will be a white residue.</li>
      <li>Suave smells funny.</li>
      <li>Dove is ok, but a step above Suave.  </li>
      <li>So, I have nothing to compare it to, but this did exactly what I needed it to.</li>
      <li>I first tried it at the spa where I got a massage.  </li>
      <li>When you first spray it on, it&#x27;s kind of wet</li>
      <li>But i love it, definitely got rid of the oil in my hair.</li>
      <li>It did not help soak up any oil and definitely did not give my hair any more volume.</li>
      <li>I liked this product, but it was empty after three or four uses.</li>
      <li>I have used many dry shampoos in the past, and the Cleanse Extend is definitely better than most.</li>
      <li>My only comment is that I get intense static after using this.  </li>
      <li>Let the product dry and comb it very lightly.  </li>
      <li>It may not be for all types of hair, but it&#x27;s great to add volume and texture, and you only need a little right at the roots.</li>
      <li>so it was important to me to find a dry shampoo that wasn&#x27;t super powdery</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s no secret that I love dry shampoo.</li>
      <li>Too much combing/styling negates the effect.  </li>
      <li>followed the advice of another reviewer who said it works best if you use it on Day 2 (before hair looks dirty)</li>
      <li>It felt like I had coated  my hair with very stiff/strong hairspray.</li>
      <li>but the smell was too much for me.</li>
      <li>which is why I like it so much.</li>
      <li>a good tool to have when you are running late and don&#x27;t have time to wash your hair; takes away the oily look</li>
      <li>This one isn&#x27;t too heavy and has a nice scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make</li>
      <li>I easily get one more day out of this between shampoos than I do with any other dry shampoo.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s currently winter, and I literally can&#x27;t get ready in the morning without wetting my hair and then it&#x27;s full of static again in just a few minutes because of this product.  </li>
      <li>, let dry for about 5 minutes then scrub a little with your finger tips right at the roots to build volume and brush through :)</li>
      <li>just remember to shake the can pretty well before you use it or it will come out white on your hair.</li>
      <li>I only have one pro for this product: it did not turn my hair white when using it like most dry shampoos.</li>
      <li>It works very well without leaving a white residue on my hair.  </li>
      <li>sure to spray it at least 6 inches away from your hair and brush it out</li>
      <li>there&#x27;s so much gunk from this stuff my straightener actually squeaks on my hair.</li>
      <li>This is noticeably better than drug store brands because you don&#x27;t have to apply as much, which keeps your hair from looking gray or dusty</li>
      <li>Make me hair look clean in between washes and covers up my dark roots in between highlights!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a little more pricey than some of the other dry shampoos that are out there, but for what this one does, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>So, if you usually wash your hair every third day, and your hair is totally grubby on day 4, apply on day 2 and you should be okay until day five (might need to reapply).  </li>
      <li>I can get pretty sweaty, wash just my bangs, use this product and dry and curl or straighten my hair and even my teenage daughters</li>
      <li>I have tried many brands of dry shampoo trying to find one that does not look white in my very dark hair.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot dry shampoos and this is definitely one of my favorites. Smells great and adds lots of texture. Not the best for absorbing oils, but definitely give hair a little va-voom.</li>
    <li> This product leaves my hair SO full of static, that I can&#x27;t use it.  Maybe it would work in the summer months?  It&#x27;s currently winter, and I literally can&#x27;t get ready in the morning without wetting my hair and then it&#x27;s full of static again in just a few minutes because of this product.  I&#x27;ve never had this problem with other dry shampoos and can&#x27;t recommend this one.</li>
    <li> I bought this based off reading online that this is Katie Holmes&#x27; go-to product for her hair. I think she always has nice hair so I was excited. I only have one pro for this product: it did not turn my hair white when using it like most dry shampoos. Other than thst, it did not seem to do anything for my hair. It did not help soak up any oil and definitely did not give my hair any more volume. The worst part is it smelled like rotten cantaloupe juice. I ended it giving it to my sister. She has a different hair type than I do, so we thought it should be tried again out. She said she couldn&#x27;t get passed the smell and she tossed it.</li>
    <li> Best dry shampoo ever</li>
    <li> It definitely does what it&#x27;s suppose to do but honestly frizzes my hair crazy! And feels weird. But i love it, definitely got rid of the oil in my hair.</li>
    <li> I loved how it worked but the smell was too much for me. To me it smelt as if I sprayed febreze in my hair.... yuck!</li>
    <li> Get Kenra Dry Shampoo MUCH Better product this leaves fine hair sticky and it smells terrible.</li>
    <li> This is noticeably better than drug store brands because you don&#x27;t have to apply as much, which keeps your hair from looking gray or dusty (it still does sometimes but it&#x27;s better). This is a big deal since I have dark hair. It also smells really nice. My husband has actually complimented me on how good my hair smells without prompting when I use it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s no secret that I love dry shampoo. Or, maybe it&#x27;s because I hate showering. Whatever it is- I&#x27;m a dry shampoo addict.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alterna Bamboo style dry shampoo is a very good product. I have lots of fine blond hair, and my hair gets greasy looking after 1 day. I use this on the second day and my hair looks as good as it did the day before. The problem I&#x27;ve had with some dry shampoos is that they just add heaviness without getting rid of the grease. This one isn&#x27;t too heavy and has a nice scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to spray it at least 6 inches away from your hair and brush it out afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had a few dry shampoo cans run out of aerosol after only a few uses. I have had this for about 2 weeks, and haven&#x27;t had a problem yet. If you&#x27;ve never used dry shampoo before, this would be a good one to try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Worth it!!! I&#x27;ve been using this at least 1-2 times a week for the last 5 months and I&#x27;ve not run out of product! The aerosol is still working, too, and there feels like there is a lot left. It&#x27;s a little more pricey than some of the other dry shampoos that are out there, but for what this one does, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> I liked this product, but it was empty after three or four uses.</li>
    <li> Made my hair so stiff! My hair felt horrible all that day and was very difficult to brush. It felt like I had coated  my hair with very stiff/strong hairspray.</li>
    <li> Works great with no white powder look.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other Alterna dry shampoos before so I thought I would give this a try, but I was really disappointed. It left my hair looking worse than before I used it.</li>
    <li> You know those days when it&#x27;s time for work and you should have washed your hair?  This product does the trick....makes hair look good...or at least washed recently.  You have to be careful not to use too much...your hair still looks oily.  I bend my head down and spray just the roots.  Let the product dry and comb it very lightly.  Too much combing/styling negates the effect.  It has helped me out in many a pinch!!!</li>
    <li> my go to for dry shampoo.  Works great, smell is nice and no residual on the hair either.  This is my favorite.</li>
    <li> The only dry shampoo I&#x27;ve found that isn&#x27;t made of things that are literally used to set flame to myriad things.  The smell is tolerable, which is a big thing for me.</li>
    <li> best dry shampoo out there!  this was recommended by hair stylist for boosting volume and giving more manageability to super fine but thick hair that tends to just fall flat under its own weight...  This gives some texture to the hair so that it stays in place without being stiff or sticky - also I only wash about 1-2x per week so as not to damage color treated hair (you have to train your scalp gradually not to over produce oil, and I only use products like morrocco method or just dr. bronners or baking soda with apple cider vinegar rinse) so it&#x27;s nice for a boost about day 3 or 4 when the roots start to get pretty shiny compared to the rest of the hair.  This lets you not dry out your hair more just to wash the roots.  It may not be for all types of hair, but it&#x27;s great to add volume and texture, and you only need a little right at the roots. Tip: section your hair like you were applying root touch up color and spray really briefly, let dry for about 5 minutes then scrub a little with your finger tips right at the roots to build volume and brush through :)</li>
    <li> My wife LOVES this product.  She picked up a bottle at a salon and was instantly hooked.  She has shorter hair but likes the volume she gets from this product.  Amazon had a better price so we stocked up</li>
    <li> This is the best dry shampoo I have used! I try not to wash my hair everyday because it&#x27;s long so this is a perfect option for the in between days. I&#x27;m a brunett so it was important to me to find a dry shampoo that wasn&#x27;t super powdery and this is it!</li>
    <li> Here&#x27;s the thing. Suave smells funny. Dove is ok, but a step above Suave.  This stuff is great because it works and it smells better.  I first tried it at the spa where I got a massage.  When you first spray it on, it&#x27;s kind of wet but then it dries and works just like the others...but WITHOUT THE WHITE POWDER LOOK!  Amazing.</li>
    <li> One of the best dry shampoos I&#x27;ve tried. It has a nice smell and does not leave a white residue. I&#x27;ve also gotten many more uses out of one bottle than I expected, making it a great value. It buys me about an extra day of not washing my hair, but starts to wear off towards the end of the day (which is why I only gave 4 stars). I&#x27;ve found it works best if you put it on the night before, with maybe a slight touchup in the morning. It&#x27;s also great for adding texture to clean hair!</li>
    <li> This is the best dry shampoo. I have color-treated blonde hair. Baby powder is too messy. Other dry shampoos leave a white residue or are too stiff. Cleanse Extend is translucent so it doesn&#x27;t leave that white residue, but offers the volume I need after a few days with no hair washing. I always have to have this product on hand!</li>
    <li> I love this. It still leaves the white / grey look when you spray it on but it goes away after you comb your hair. It doesn&#x27;t give you the clumpy / sticky feeling like the powders do. A more environmentally friendly spray bottle would be nice though.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite products.  It works very well without leaving a white residue on my hair.  It is great for a pick me up.</li>
    <li> This spray doesn&#x27;t work at all and smells terrible.  I used it a couple of times and will be throwing it away.</li>
    <li> My stylist recommended this to me and I cannot imagine using any other dry shampoo.  There is no white powder residue to get stuck visibly in your hair.  I work out every morning and use many styling tools.  This allows me to give my hair a break from daily washing.  I can get pretty sweaty, wash just my bangs, use this product and dry and curl or straighten my hair and even my teenage daughters cannot tell I haven&#x27;t washed my hair.</li>
    <li> This product works well. Not great on super oily hair but it gives a great fullness to your hair. Have not used any other of these types of product so I cannot compare it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! I used the Alterna&#x27;s powder dry shampoo previously and it worked well, but often left my scalp looking white. This product it incredible. It controls oil and shine without the side effects of the powder dry shampoo. It works great for straight and curly hair (I have both)! I am in love!</li>
    <li> I have very dark brown hair. I&#x27;ve tried a number of dry shampoos which coat your hair in white powder and made it look like I&#x27;ve slapped a couple chalkboard erases over my head. This one actually is translucent *after* you brush it out. Follow the instructions -- spray sparingly at roots in short bursts; wait 2-3 minutes to dry; brush through entirely (I flip my head over); pat down with hands, the white disappears. Be prepared that your hairbrush bristles will be coated in white powder and slightly sticky residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the advice of another reviewer who said it works best if you use it on Day 2 (before hair looks dirty) then it will last for Day 4 or 5. Don&#x27;t wait to use on Day 3 or 4 and expect the same results.</li>
    <li> This stuff is pretty incredible.  It makes my hair look clean, fluffy, and voluminous even when I haven&#x27;t showered! Go for it--I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll regret it.</li>
    <li> Actually the worst ever dry shampoo. So sticky and gross! Makes your hair feel dirtier.</li>
    <li> This is great to spray in on day 2 when you don&#x27;t want to wash your hair. It gives you lift and texture. I have red hair so you have to make sure you use your hand to spread it around after you spray or there will be a white residue.</li>
    <li> I have used many dry shampoos in the past, and the Cleanse Extend is definitely better than most. It&#x27;s translucent so it does not leave that white, powdery after effect of some other dry shampoos. It does not make my hair feel stiff or dry, like other products may. I also found that the Cleanse Extend kept my hair looking cleaner longer than other brands that I have tried in the past. I gave it 4 stars as I think it is a bit overpriced, and doesn&#x27;t last as long as others that I have tried. However, I think the quality is worth it.</li>
    <li> I have tried many brands of dry shampoo trying to find one that does not look white in my very dark hair.  This is the best one so far, but be warned that if you go overboard, you will still be able to see it.  Use a very light hand and you may be able to get away with it in dark hair...maybe.</li>
    <li> Am I the only one who gets insanely staticky hair from this? Although the translucent effect is nice I cannot brush through my hair without it looking like I touched one of those electrical static balls. Also when I try to straighten my hair a little there&#x27;s so much gunk from this stuff my straightener actually squeaks on my hair. Horrible stuff, I will be going back to Batiste. I&#x27;d sooner deal with the white effect and brush it out than look like Einstein all day.</li>
    <li> best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used. just remember to shake the can pretty well before you use it or it will come out white on your hair.</li>
    <li> This is the best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever tried, hands down.  I easily get one more day out of this between shampoos than I do with any other dry shampoo.  Absolutely no white residue.  My only comment is that I get intense static after using this.  I mean intense.  Weird.  But overall great product!</li>
    <li> It works, sort of.  Don&#x27;t over spray, though.  Also, don&#x27;t try to bring life back into dirty hair with this, it won&#x27;t work.  However, it will give you an extra day or two if applied when hair that&#x27;s on the edge.  So, if you usually wash your hair every third day, and your hair is totally grubby on day 4, apply on day 2 and you should be okay until day five (might need to reapply).  However, this won&#x27;t work at all if you apply on day three or later.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Make me hair look clean in between washes and covers up my dark roots in between highlights!</li>
    <li> I was really disappointed because I love Alterna shampoos. Something in the dry shampoo made my forehead itch after I sprayed it in my hair.</li>
    <li> Works well and has a nice smell.  Does make my hair feel heavy, which makes it feel dirtier to me. I don&#x27;t think it works any better than the cheap Suave brand though.</li>
    <li> makes my hair really hard and dry, it loses it&#x27;s bounce...I still use it frequently but more because of lack of a better product at this time...</li>
    <li> IMHO, this is the best dry shampoo out there. However, I have blonde hair- not sure this would work for dark hair as it is very light which is why I like it so much. It also gives you TONS of volume when you use it.</li>
    <li> Works great! Actually makes my hair feel thicker as well as cleaner.</li>
    <li> I have used this and it does help get built up product out of my hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried every dry shampoo on the market.  This is by far my favorite.  Reasonably priced and doesn&#x27;t show up in dark hair.</li>
    <li> Helps lift hair and get rid of that ooooh, I didn&#x27;t have time to wash my hair look.  Lasts for a couple of days.  Easy to use - just part hair in a few places and spray - then let sit for about a minute and then style as usual or brush and go.</li>
    <li> Do not buy! Wish I could get my money back. The spray smells awful-- it made me usually sleek hair a frizzy staticy mess, and then left a whitish residue. Really terrible stuff. I&#x27;m disappointed I spent the money</li>
    <li> The best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used. Seriously buy this stuff</li>
    <li> This is to my hair what mineral powder is to my nose. It absorbs the oil for a matte finish. I have long, curly, color treated, red hair. I always skip a day when it comes to shampooing. I have no issue on day 2, but if I try to stretch to day 3, the roots get oily. I applied this on a \\&quot;day 3\\&quot;, concentrated on the roots and was careful not to overuse. The roots freshened up instantly and even got a little volume. I can see how this could make your ends dry, but I think the trick is to just use sparingly and concentrate on the roots. This is the only dry shampoo I&#x27;ve used. So, I have nothing to compare it to, but this did exactly what I needed it to.</li>
    <li> a good tool to have when you are running late and don&#x27;t have time to wash your hair; takes away the oily look</li>
    <li> Oops, I did not realize my small item shipped with a larger item I returned.  Ended up returning both items by mistake.</li>
    <li> I love that this dry shampoo is translucent and does not leave a white residue behind.  I love how my husband and I can use it.</li>
