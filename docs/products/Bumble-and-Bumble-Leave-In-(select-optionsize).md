      <li>gave this retailer the benefit of the doubt wondering if B&amp;B changed their product, so I brought the bottle into a Bumble and Bumble store and the nice lady laughed and me and told me to return it!  </li>
      <li>It does a good job of keeping waves intact and is good for curly hair, but there is some stickiness.</li>
      <li>is about it and a good smell</li>

      <li>I absolutely love it!</li>

      <li>I have used a myriad of products to try to control this, and this product is by far the best I&#x27;ve tried.</li>

      <li>Worth the price..   </li>

      <li>I rarely write reviews</li>
      <li>I have gone through 4 maybe 5 bottles so far, and I have not found another leave-in conditioner better for my hair.</li>
      <li>Most people I know with dyed hair have to cut it short after a while</li>
      <li>Sure enough I went and bought Bb leave in from a salon retailer and compared it to this product.  </li>
      <li>It is more pricey but left no greasy build up</li>
      <li>In Conditioner is the first conditioner that I can work through my hair with no concerns that it will have anything but a positive effect.</li>
      <li>Summer 2014 was sooooo humid, and I like straightening my hair, but it wasn&#x27;t staying straight, so my stylist told me to use this with defrizz, and my hair stayed straight all day!</li>
      <li>so I would have expected more from this.</li>
      <li>My hair is about shoulder length or longer, and it doesn&#x27;t know if it wants to be straight or wavy.  </li>
      <li>A few times a week keeps my hair looking healthy.</li>

      <li>I have fine hair and have always had problems with typical conditioners which left my hair heavy and kind of lifeless.</li>
      <li>I normally order direct from the company, but ran out and thought as a Prime member it would be here in two days… took longer than ordering from B&amp;B.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light and never weighs my hair down.</li>
      <li>I have wavey hair on top which gets curlier further down</li>
      <li>I have type 4 hair which is relaxed and a little fine.</li>
      <li>This product is very good but a bit on the heavy side for thin hair to use without rinsing it out after application.</li>
      <li>It makes my hair so soft and silky.</li>
      <li>It was almost completely gone.</li>
      <li>I have naturally curly, on the frizzy-dry side hair, with this conditioner, I can curl, straighten, or anything in between, and it leaves my hair soft and manageable.</li>
      <li>or it is from a really old batch that has started to stink.  </li>
      <li>The conditioner is so old that it doesn&#x27;t even work anymore.</li>
      <li>The leave on comdtioner was so old that I could barely read the writing on it.</li>
      <li>It was not of the same consistency nor did it even smell the same as the real product.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like using product in my hair that will leave it stiff or dry, so I literally ONLY use this stuff and it has been fabulous (until I stopped)!</li>
      <li>It definitely makes my hair soft but for a cheaper alternative, my suggestion is Sunsilk Hydra TLC.</li>
      <li>I was about to read this review, I saw numerous other reviews that are very similar!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stay</li>
      <li>It took about two hours for it to dry completely, my curls were bouncy and separated (as opposed to clumped together, if you will).</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a small pink bottle, available at any local CVS or even at the grocery store.</li>
      <li>With fine and thin hair I have always had to avoid leave-in conditioners if I wanted to have any body at all for my hair style.</li>

<li> &quot; my hair, I no longer need to flat iron it to get rid of the frizz after blow drying.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s &amp;#34;confused&amp;#34; and it&#x27;s a scary, frizzy mess on its own sans any hair products.  </li>
<li> My only complaint is that I can&#x27;t seem to find the liter bottles anymore, and the 8 oz is much pricier per ounce.</li>
<li> With this Bumble &amp; Bumble leave-in conditioner I can condition my hair all day long and no one is the wiser.</li>
<li> Bumble and Bumble Leave in Conditioner has really helped tame the frizz without weighing my hair down.</li>
<li> I believe the product has past it expiration and very old.</li>
<li> Although the consistency and fragrance are quite different than the other B &amp; B</li>
<li> I have long, somewhat curly hair and would not recommend this product to anyone!</li>
<li> I leave it in and straighten my hair as I blow dry it.  </li>
<li> I have received this product from Bumble and Bumble and know this is not normal.  </li>
<li> Product is the only thing that weights down my curls and defines them.</li>
<li> I applied a generous amount to my wet hair and allowed it to air dry.</li>
<li> My hair gets very dry and frizzy in the summer.</li>
<li> I use this to tame down my natural curls and to help define them.  </li>
<li> What a huge disappointment.</li>
<li> I have straight, thin hair.</li>
<li> Leaves your hair soft and thick.</li>
<li> It quenched my dry hair without making it greasy or weighted down.</li>
<li> After half an hour of applying it, my hair felt dry after the water evaporated.</li>
<li> Like the other reviews said, this was counterfeit product.  </li>
<li> i feel my extremely damaged hair..</li>
<li> I could not be more disappointed.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The leave on comdtioner was so old that I could barely read the writing on it. It was almost completely gone. The conditioner is so old that it doesn&#x27;t even work anymore.</li>
    <li> On the bottle, it&#x27;s noted that this product can be used as either a rinse out or leave in conditioner. I haven&#x27;t yet used it as a rinse out conditioner...only as a leave in conditioner. It definitely makes my hair soft but for a cheaper alternative, my suggestion is Sunsilk Hydra TLC. It&#x27;s a small pink bottle, available at any local CVS or even at the grocery store. It works just as well, or slightly better than this product.</li>
    <li> I have gone through 4 maybe 5 bottles so far, and I have not found another leave-in conditioner better for my hair. The others left my hair heavy, sticky, dirty feeling, and unmanageable, I could not wait to wash out my hair, now its all different. I have naturally curly, on the frizzy-dry side hair, with this conditioner, I can curl, straighten, or anything in between, and it leaves my hair soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> I have curly hair which frizzes quite easily.  I utilize this product  after showering and leave it in.  Helps control friz and keeps my  hair looking smooth.</li>
    <li> I use this to tame down my natural curls and to help define them.  This is the best product that I&#x27;ve come across.  I use it as a leave in conditioner.  It doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down or look greasy.  I absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I&#x27;ve used it for 10 years. It&#x27;s light and never weighs my hair down. It keeps my hair moisturized. I have straight, thin hair.</li>
    <li> Worth the price..   Adds some volume to my hair..and makes it smooth.. i feel my extremely damaged hair..seems recovering   Love it :)</li>
    <li> I ordered this conditioner based on a product review from a beauty site. This conditioner is very expensive, but I thought it would be worth it if it lived up to the claims. I could not be more disappointed. I&#x27;ve never reviewed a product but I was so upset with this purchase I felt I owed it to everyone else. I have tried this as a leave-in and rinse out, and no matter the result is hard to comb, frizzy hair. I was happier with the cheap drugstore conditioners. I have long, somewhat curly hair and would not recommend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> Hair felt dirtier sooner after using.</li>
    <li> This product is great, like most other B&amp;B products. My one qualm is the smell.  It smells very strongly of glue... but can&#x27;t complain because the smell goes away once it&#x27;s in your hair.      Otherwise, it&#x27;s awesome! Makes my hair shiny and very soft and it&#x27;s not sticky at all.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years.  My hairs is thick and curly and turns into a mop head of frizz when it rains.  I leave it in and straighten my hair as I blow dry it.  I love the look I get, and I have had many compliments on the softness and texture of my hair.  My only complaint is that I can&#x27;t seem to find the liter bottles anymore, and the 8 oz is much pricier per ounce.</li>
    <li> After ordering this product and trying it I had a suspicion that it was not actually the product it claimed to be in the the bottle.  I had my doubts because it cost much less than the product retails.  Sure enough I went and bought Bb leave in from a salon retailer and compared it to this product.  It was not of the same consistency nor did it even smell the same as the real product.  Short of actually having it tested in a lab, this product is not what it claims to be!</li>
    <li> This is a great leave-in. I have type 4 hair which is relaxed and a little fine. This conditioner has no cones, mineral oil or petrolatum. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair stiff or crunchy. It makes my hair so soft and silky. My routine is to prepoo with a protein conditioner, wash and condition my hair in the shower. I apply this leave in and cover my  head with my hair wrap for 15 minutes(don&#x27;t want to deep condition and get back in the shower). I use my FHI pro 2000 dryer on the cold setting to blow dry and you won&#x27;t believe how silky my hair is. It also gives my hair body. The only snag is that it&#x27;s a little expensive. I did some research before I bought this one.This has everything I wanted. I tried several leave-ins before this one. This is now my holy grail leave in.</li>
    <li> Product is the only thing that weights down my curls and defines them. The formula has been improved lately, and it&#x27;s actually improved.  Good product great Amazon price and delightful service, as always.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and have always had problems with typical conditioners which left my hair heavy and kind of lifeless. B&amp;B Leave In Conditioner is the first conditioner that I can work through my hair with no concerns that it will have anything but a positive effect. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone with fine hair.</li>
    <li> This product is very good but a bit on the heavy side for thin hair to use without rinsing it out after application.</li>
    <li> This is without doubt the very best leave-in conditioner I&#x27;ve yet to discover. With fine and thin hair I have always had to avoid leave-in conditioners if I wanted to have any body at all for my hair style. No longer! With this Bumble &amp; Bumble leave-in conditioner I can condition my hair all day long and no one is the wiser. Leaves my hair feeling and looking fabulous!</li>
    <li> I have been using this leave in conditioner for a few years now. The bottles are small and expensive, but until about a month ago I was just using it out of habit. When my last bottle ran out I was in the middle of moving and just decided to use a cheaper product that I had used before because my local CVS didn&#x27;t carry B&amp;B Leave in Conditioner. The last month has been HORRIBLE! My hair has been knotting like crazy, is ridiculously dried out considering that the weather has been so hot, and the frizz.. oh the frizz! I&#x27;d forgotten that my hair is prone to all these problems because of how well this stuff works! I don&#x27;t like using product in my hair that will leave it stiff or dry, so I literally ONLY use this stuff and it has been fabulous (until I stopped)! My hair is very thick and curly and as soon as my order comes in I&#x27;m not letting any other product touch it!</li>
    <li> Like the other reviews said, this was counterfeit product.  All of the descriptions they gave of the differences on the bottle and the product were true.  I have used this product for many many years and it was not Bumble and Bumble product.  I normally order direct from the company, but ran out and thought as a Prime member it would be here in two days… took longer than ordering from B&amp;B.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon you should check your sellers of products that tend to be counterfeited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don’t order this product through Amazon</li>
    <li> This stuff is great, but is very high priced.</li>
    <li> My hair gets very dry and frizzy in the summer. With color and daily abuse my hair begins to look parched. My hair is very fine so many products easily weigh down my hair (even some wash out conditioners) but this was perfect. It quenched my dry hair without making it greasy or weighted down. I don&#x27;t use it every day but I don&#x27;t feel I need to. A few times a week keeps my hair looking healthy.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for yrs. It was less expensive thru amazon. GREAT leave in conditioner, I recommend for all hair types.</li>
    <li> I have course, frizzy, color treated hair.  I have used a myriad of products to try to control this, and this product is by far the best I&#x27;ve tried. It not only \\&quot;softens\\&quot; my hair, I no longer need to flat iron it to get rid of the frizz after blow drying.  I won&#x27;t go without it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Bumble and Bumble products for several years and this is one of my favorites that they offer.  I&#x27;ve tried other leave-in conditoners, both expensive and inexpensive (this one is in the middle price-wise) and I like this one the best for the price.  I have wavey hair on top which gets curlier further down and this conditioner has always done its job for me.</li>
    <li> The Bumble and Bumble Leave In Conditioner I received has a bad smell to it.  I have been using this product for years and it has never smelled like this.  Either it is not truly Bumble and Bumble or it is from a really old batch that has started to stink.  Would not buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Beware of this seller!  I have been using bumble and bumble leave in conditioner for years and when this product arrived, it didn&#x27;t smell, look or feel like B&amp;B Leave-In Conditioner.  It even had the wrong color!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this retailer the benefit of the doubt wondering if B&amp;B changed their product, so I brought the bottle into a Bumble and Bumble store and the nice lady laughed and me and told me to return it!  She chastised me for purchasing this through amazon and not through a B&amp;B store!  I don&#x27;t necessarily agree with that, I would just avoid this retailer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I was about to read this review, I saw numerous other reviews that are very similar!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stay away from this retailer, they will try to pull the wool over your eyes with an inferior product!!  I rarely write reviews, I am hoping my plight will prevent you from being duped by this retailer!</li>
    <li> Used it for years!  FAB</li>
    <li> $99 to purchase a bottle of this discontinued product is total price gouging!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this leave in conditioner almost everyday for the past 8 years. I forgot it when I went to school for the summer and thought I could go without for a few weeks. After day 3 I ordered it. My hair is colored and I spend a lot of time in the sun, this conditioner makes it soft and healthy. Most people I know with dyed hair have to cut it short after a while and I&#x27;ve been able to keep my long and healthy because of this product. It is WONDERFUL!</li>
    <li> Best leave in conditioner I have ever used. Leaves your hair soft and thick. I&#x27;m 52 and my hair was beginning to thin and look dried out. No longer!</li>
    <li> The product has a stale smell to it.  I have received this product from Bumble and Bumble and know this is not normal.  I believe the product has past it expiration and very old.</li>
    <li> I loved this product but B&amp;B discontinued it 2 years ago, that&#x27;s means that whatever this is,  is way beyond the expiration date or counterfeit.  Buyer beware.  Someone is making a huge profit at this price!!  It was $22 retail when B&amp;B sold it.  Sadly there new conditioner are not very good, I tried a few and returned them all.  They didn&#x27;t work well, the were loaded with cheap fragrance. So sad B&amp;B discontinued this, please go on the B&amp;B site and plead for them to make it again, if enough people request it maybe they will bring it back. Heres hoping.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t even believe it was the actual product. It was not sealed inside and it did not smell, feel or condition like the original one I bought for many years until B &amp; B stopped selling this product. What a huge disappointment.</li>
    <li> Although the consistency and fragrance are quite different than the other B &amp; B Ive tried (both rinse out conditioners), it truly delivers. I use it when I want to wear my thick relaxed hair in a curly style. I applied a generous amount to my wet hair and allowed it to air dry. It took about two hours for it to dry completely, my curls were bouncy and separated (as opposed to clumped together, if you will). It is more pricey but left no greasy build up, This remains on my top three list of favorites (leave ins).</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.. Got to buy more when the site restocks it for $26...</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t do anything to my hair. Some of the others are saying its a fake so maybe I received a fake one. I use the BB Sumo Tech and that is one of the best products I&#x27;ve ever used so I would have expected more from this. After half an hour of applying it, my hair felt dry after the water evaporated. I think if I used body  lotion on my hair it would have been more effective.</li>
    <li> Summer 2014 was sooooo humid, and I like straightening my hair, but it wasn&#x27;t staying straight, so my stylist told me to use this with defrizz, and my hair stayed straight all day! May be expensive, but the garnier fructis leave in conditioner has nothing on this. I also use it in winter to keep my hair moisturized</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not greasy. Moisturizes great. Totally recommend it. I use it as a leave in conditioner. I have fine, straight hair.</li>
    <li> to expensive and it really doesnt do as it say but goes on nicely is about it and a good smell</li>
    <li> It does a good job of keeping waves intact and is good for curly hair, but there is some stickiness. When I use it, I know I&#x27;ll have to shampoo my hair within 2 days or it&#x27;ll feel greasy.</li>
    <li> This helps my fine, limp, fly away , pitiful hair.</li>
    <li> My hair is about shoulder length or longer, and it doesn&#x27;t know if it wants to be straight or wavy.  It&#x27;s neither thick nor thin.  It&#x27;s &amp;#34;confused&amp;#34; and it&#x27;s a scary, frizzy mess on its own sans any hair products.  Bumble and Bumble Leave in Conditioner has really helped tame the frizz without weighing my hair down. I use a good, moderate amount.  It&#x27;s a fantastic base for everything else I do to my hair, which are just teeny, tiny dabs of this and that, stuff I&#x27;ve used for a while, but don&#x27;t work as well without this leave-in conditioner for a base.</li>
