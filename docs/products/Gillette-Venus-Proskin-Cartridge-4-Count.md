### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I have found Amazon has the best prices on cartridges hands-down.</li>
      <li>but i still have to use a shave cream which barbasol brands seem to be the best for my legs.</li>
      <li>In my opinion, they give the best shave from about the 2nd-4th use.  </li>
      <li>the Venus Proskin razor refills are the best.</li>
      <li>and the shave is close and flawless.  </li>
      <li>Everything arrived on time and I was very happy with my purchase!</li>
      <li>The shaving lotion on the head of these razors is awesome.</li>

      <li>These are great razors.</li>
      <li>Great price from Amazon.</li>

      <li>This razor is great.</li>

      <li>The lubricating wedges are so awesome that the razor feels like nothing and cuts very cleanly.</li>
      <li>i  like this is very good use and is very fit</li>
      <li>I think these glide the best and give the best shave over knees and in sensitive areas.  </li>
      <li>These razors are great when you just want to tidy up your legs quickly--no need to use shaving cream.</li>
      <li>But I&#x27;ve also heard the ones infused with Olay are good as well -</li>
      <li>, if you own a Venus Pro Skin razor then you already know it&#x27;s a great razor.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Please don&#x27;t purchase the Pro Skin variety, but Gillette Venus is still a good</li>
      <li>Good job</li>
      <li>Nice but not as good as the breeze and spa breeze.</li>

      <li>This is by far the best razor that I have ever used.&lt;br</li>
      <li>These are great for the first two shaves, then the conditioning strip comes off.</li>
      <li>I also, we use them every night they seem to last longer than spa breeze and amazon has best price.</li>
      <li>Do not try this because you are going to love it and then want to always use it.  </li>
      <li>This is my favorite razor.  </li>
      <li>and im glad i did.</li>
      <li>My wife asked me to order more of her razors.</li>
      <li>I had been using the Venus Embrace cartridges which I love, but since the ProSkin ones were on sale I decided to try them.  </li>
      <li>I love my Venus Razor Blades.  </li>
      <li>I give this an okay because i haven&#x27;t use them yet</li>
      <li>i decided to try this because it looked interesting.</li>
      <li>&#x3D;)</li>
      <li>I do love that I don&#x27;t feel I need to use shaving cream and that saves time.</li>
      <li>Love having this available on Subscribe and Save!  </li>
      <li>Ain&#x27;t nothin&#x27; better than having smooth legs and pits!  </li>
      <li>They&#x27;re okay.</li>
      <li>Love this razor</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use shaving cream any more.  </li>

      <li>and I still love these.</li>
      <li>I love love love these razors.</li>
      <li>Good close conditioning shave at first.</li>
      <li>The bars are very, very good while they do last</li>
      <li>No nicks, great for sensitive skin</li>
      <li>These are my favorite razors and my legs smooth as silk.</li>
      <li>When I saw this Pro Skin razor, I thought it&#x27;d be great for me since I have sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have much to complain about with these razors except that they are fairly pricey.  </li>
      <li>especially enjoy this product, and have been using variations of the Gillette Venus razor for 10+ years, because when you factor in the costs of buying shaving cream, and regular razors, I feel it is a better deal.</li>
      <li>EASY.  </li>
      <li>If you store this outside of your shower, you can greatly increase the longevity of the moisture bars, up to one month (or more, depending on how often you shave).  </li>
      <li>After the strip comes off it is easy to cut yourself with.</li>
      <li>They are so easy on my skin.</li>
      <li>This razor is seriously AMAZING for the first one or two uses.  </li>
      <li>I shave twice a week, and one cartridge lasts me about two weeks (4 shaves), which is fine.</li>
      <li>/&gt;That&#x27;s why razors are a huge thing for me.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted Gillette today and they are sending me a coupon for a free replacement (variety of my choice).  </li>
      <li>Leaves you feeling silky smooth</li>
      <li>These razors do their job of helping your skin stay smooth and conditioned.</li>
      <li>The blades have two moisture bars allowing for a rather effortless and painless smooth shave.</li>
      <li>Each time a $2.00 off coupon was available.</li>
      <li>If you are prone to nicks, form having low platelets or whatever, these are great.</li>
      <li>so I thought the extra lotion-y gel stuff around the razor would be great-</li>
      <li>Really smooth shave.  </li>
      <li>This is the first product that I have found works great regardless of my sensitive and easy to cut skin.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I found it and at the right price.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried them all but this blade gives the closest shave with just the right amount of shaving gel for smooth legs!</li>
      <li>The moisturizing strips surrounding the blades make shaving quick and easy.  </li>
      <li>I need to clean in out too often to appreciate the product.</li>
      <li>They really help prevent razor burn for me. :)</li>
      <li>They have worked wonderfully all that time; the only time I get nicked is sometimes on the first use of a new blade.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the first time I have been able to really tell a huge difference in razor performance.  </li>
      <li>They are however quick to fade and once the moisture bands come off they are just razors.</li>
      <li>Just as described - and quick shipping.</li>
      <li>I have used Gillette Venus for many years to get a close shave without experiencing many nicks.&lt;br /&gt;The last time I purchased refills, I thought I would try the Pro Skin variety.  </li>
      <li>i have very sensitive skin, but this product works great and is much more gentle on my skin than any other brand.</li>
      <li>Definiltey worth the cost.</li>
      <li>I rarely cut my legs shaving, maybe once a year if that.  </li>
      <li>It is a pricier option, but for me it is worth it.  </li>
      <li>I love these blades, I don&#x27;t cut my leg, even when they get old, they don&#x27;t cut me.  </li>
      <li>However, they are more expensive, your legs will feel great, but, the top bar of each razor wears out very fast and falls off so you will have to replace them while the bottom bar lasts much longer.  </li>
      <li>Compared to the Venus Embrace, and many other razors I have tried, this one is my favorite.  </li>
      <li>but they look like they would work just right</li>
      <li>The gel bar around the razor disappears quickly, and I swear it led to more nicks (especially at the knees).</li>
      <li>And for Venus razors that rarely go on sale, at least in my area, it&#x27;s a great steal.</li>
      <li>I have really sensitive skin and get razor burn easy...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I don&#x27;t think I can ever go back to using my regular venus razor and shave gel.  This saves me so much time.  It is a pricier option, but for me it is worth it.  I hate shaving, the less time I have to spend doing it, the more often I will be willing to do it.</li>
    <li> They are so easy on my skin. No cuts even when brand new. The lubricating wedges are so awesome that the razor feels like nothing and cuts very cleanly. I even save a bunch using the &amp;#34;Subscribe and Save&amp;#34; option.</li>
    <li> This razor is great, but the moisture bars do not last as long as the ones on the Venus Spa Breeze.  The bars are very, very good while they do last and the shave is close and flawless.  I got no cuts or nicks and needed no soap or shaving gel.  However, after just a few shaves, the top bar comes off and they are just too expensive to have such a short life.  I will return to using the Breeze unless these go on some great sale that I cannot pass up.</li>
    <li> These are anything but &amp;#34;proskin&amp;#34;! They&#x27;re awful! I usually love Venus cartridges, but these have torn up my skin horribly. The moisturizing bars on the cartridge wear down very fast and fall off, so you&#x27;re left with a harsh, rough shave. I now know why these were the least expensive of the Venus cartridges. These were way harsher on my skin than the regular Venus cartridges.</li>
    <li> I like the moisturizing bars, but the residue from them mixes with hair to clog up the blade. I need to clean in out too often to appreciate the product. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> If you are prone to nicks, form having low platelets or whatever, these are great. You do not need shaving gel or anything and they do not cut the skin at all. They are however quick to fade and once the moisture bands come off they are just razors.</li>
    <li> I found the last package not let my legs so smooth as the last two prior puchases I&#x27;ve made.  I&#x27;ll see what happens with the razor from the next purchase</li>
    <li> I have these delivered every other month via Subscribe and Save.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best razor that I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;The hair on my legs has always grown faster than any of the other girls that I know. I shave in the morning and by the end of the evening, I have stubble.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s why razors are a huge thing for me. This razor is great. It lasts and lasts, the moisture strips are a wonderful thing since I have fair, sensitive skin. I can shave my legs everyday with this razor since it only takes me about 5 minutes to shave both legs. It doesn&#x27;t catch or pull the hair and I only have to make one pass at an area for the hair to be completely gone. I&#x27;ve tried EVERY razor there is out there and I am now commited to this one! Buy with confidence!</li>
    <li> Great price for the easiest to use razors.</li>
    <li> Not much to say here, if you own a Venus Pro Skin razor then you already know it&#x27;s a great razor.  The blades have two moisture bars allowing for a rather effortless and painless smooth shave.</li>
    <li> I get these every month, don&#x27;t ever run out and never worry about running to the store. Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Venus products with great success... Until ProSkin.&lt;br /&gt;Worst value, bad shave, messy, quickly unusable.  Use another Venus razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soft bars are so thick one must press into the skin to shave at first.  The goop is a mess.  The bars harden and fall off after just a few shaves, leaving a dysfunctional razor.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving my remaining two blades away and, taking heed of Gillette&#x27;s responses, calling them tomorrow.</li>
    <li> I have used Gillette Venus for many years to get a close shave without experiencing many nicks.&lt;br /&gt;The last time I purchased refills, I thought I would try the Pro Skin variety.  Huge mistake.&lt;br /&gt;These were more expensive regularly, but they were on sale.&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used them I had cuts and nicks all over my underarms and legs.&lt;br /&gt;Thought it was the first time, kept using, I have nicks every time.&lt;br /&gt;Normally I would have nicks about 2-3 time per year (maybe less) with Gillette Venus&#x27; other varieties.&lt;br /&gt;The Pro Skin cartridge also falls off and cracks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted Gillette today and they are sending me a coupon for a free replacement (variety of my choice).  They are also shipping me a pre-postage envelope package to obtain the bad cartridges for the their quality team.  Good job Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please don&#x27;t purchase the Pro Skin variety, but Gillette Venus is still a good product.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I purchased mine at Target, not Amazon.com.</li>
    <li> Do not try this because you are going to love it and then want to always use it.  However, they are more expensive, your legs will feel great, but, the top bar of each razor wears out very fast and falls off so you will have to replace them while the bottom bar lasts much longer.  Oh well.</li>
    <li> Ten years ago, a friend suggested I try Venus razors to avoid nicks and cuts.  They have worked wonderfully all that time; the only time I get nicked is sometimes on the first use of a new blade.  The last time I was shopping for blades, the ProSkin ones were on sale, so I thought I&#x27;d try them (the ever-rising price on the Venus blades is their downside).  The first time I used it, I wound up with about 6 different cuts, several of them bleeding freely.  I chalked it up to the first time.... Next use I still wound up bleeding (though not as badly).  After that I began to use regular shave-gel with the blade (defeating their whole point), and with that I still get razor burn and abrasions, but no bleeding.  These blades defeat the very trait I use Venus razors for, and the earlier reviewer is correct-- the &#x27;moisture bars&#x27; fall off after a couple of weeks (maybe 5 or 6 uses in my case), making them no bargain (I can use the regular blades for a month or more each).  The DO shave closely and leave skin smooth, but are not worth the trade-off in discomfort and blood.  My advice is skip these and get any of the other blades in the line-- I&#x27;ve tried them all at different times and they all work better than the ProSkin ones.</li>
    <li> These razors are great when you just want to tidy up your legs quickly--no need to use shaving cream. They&#x27;re best used for leg area since the wide size of the product would be difficult to use for bikini area. I get these on automatic delivery, so I never run out.</li>
    <li> I have tried a few different types of razors, I do not like to use shavinig cream, as I shave in teh shower. These razors work very well with their moisturizing bars. I recommend them !</li>
    <li> Leaves you feeling silky smooth</li>
    <li> Love this razor and I finally have smooth as silk legs.  My only negative comment is that I wish the cartridge lasted a bit longer.</li>
    <li> So Venus decided to discontinue Proskin, or rather, rename it Quench. Whatever the case may be, I could not find Proskin or Quench refills in any Target or Walgreens stores, which led me to Amazon. I&#x27;m glad I found it and at the right price. The reason I gave it 4 stars is because the lather bars fall off after about 5 shaves, especially the top one. What&#x27;s the point of having those bars there if they are not going to last.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive and dry skin and I have always suffered with dryness and irritation when shaving my legs.  I decided to try out this razor, and I am certainly glad that I did.  This razor is seriously AMAZING for the first one or two uses.  It didn&#x27;t dry out my legs, gave me a close shave, and I didn&#x27;t get any irritation or bumps.  The problem is that the little moisture bars around the razor shrink and get smaller the more times that you use it.  My recommendation would just be to switch out the razor heads often, because when you first use this razor, it&#x27;s seriously amazing for dry skin!</li>
    <li> My favorite razor! I&#x27;ve tried them all but this blade gives the closest shave with just the right amount of shaving gel for smooth legs!</li>
    <li> I did not like these razors at all. I wanted to try something different. The gel strips around the blade become slippery when wet so be careful when you shave. The blades also dulled quickly after a few uses. I won&#x27;t be buying these again.</li>
    <li> These are great razors. I have really sensitive skin and get razor burn easy... I&#x27;ve used these a few times and haven&#x27;t gotten razor burn yet!</li>
    <li> Good price for this great item.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like these razors.  I have extra dry skin so I thought the extra lotion-y gel stuff around the razor would be great- NO.  It was an icky mess. I don&#x27;t recommend.  I just kept using my regular Venus razors and just got moisturizing shave gel separate.</li>
    <li> The gel bars are very moisturizing on my sensitive skin, and in the shower I don&#x27;t even really need to use shave cream. I shave twice a week, and one cartridge lasts me about two weeks (4 shaves), which is fine. I only wish they would make a 4 or 5 blade version of this. I&#x27;m not fond of the foofy scent of the 5-blade olay ones, and the other &amp;#34;moisturizing&amp;#34; bars aren&#x27;t nearly moisturizing enough. I prefer the Pro skin because of the lack of fragrance and the moisturizing qualities.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find these blades anywhere else but on Amazon. I love the blades!  Just wish they were less.expensive.</li>
    <li> I give this an okay because i haven&#x27;t use them yet but they look like they would work just right</li>
    <li> I Love these blades! I have been using them for years. They really help prevent razor burn for me. :)</li>
    <li> Just as described - and quick shipping.</li>
    <li> Everything arrived on time and I was very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> Until I got this one.  It&#x27;s the first time I have been able to really tell a huge difference in razor performance.  Will continue to order, but since I like it so much, it will probably disappear into the netherworld of &amp;#34;things I would use for the rest of my life but they don&#x27;t make them anymore&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I was sceptical at first but figured I&#x27;d try it out - yeah, try it out as a subscription when I&#x27;ve never used it before...smart. Well, YES it was! I liked the way my legs, arms and other shaved areas felt after using the Venus Proskin razor refills. I don&#x27;t need to buy shaving cream ever again!! Plus these refills do leave your skin moisturized and silky. If you are looking to a) save money and/or b) save time the Venus Proskin razor refills are the best.</li>
    <li> These are my favorite razors and my legs smooth as silk. I can&#x27;t get my legs this smooth using any other razor. As much as I love the razors, the gel part sometimes gets rough and bumpy and doesn&#x27;t give you the close shave. Otherwise, I have no complaints about this product and will continue to buy them because I cannot find any other replacement cartridges that I like!</li>
    <li> I love love love these razors. I have never been cut by one, and they leave your skin soft. The shave is also pretty close. This is the first product that I have found works great regardless of my sensitive and easy to cut skin. Some say that they don&#x27;t need to use shaving cream with these, but I still use it. But I have more sensitive dry skin than most. I have ordered these from Amazon multiple times. Each time a $2.00 off coupon was available. By getting these here, I have found that I have saved an average of about $7 a box. And for Venus razors that rarely go on sale, at least in my area, it&#x27;s a great steal.</li>
    <li> My wife asked me to order more of her razors. I ordered this one by mistake as it was not the one she uses but she was happy with them.</li>
    <li> I love these blades, I don&#x27;t cut my leg, even when they get old, they don&#x27;t cut me.  my legs&lt;br /&gt;seem to be staying smoother longer too.</li>
    <li> I like these, but I wish Amazon had the spa razors that also do not require shaving cream! Those are my favorite, but these are a close second. They don&#x27;t seem to last as long, though.</li>
    <li> but i still have to use a shave cream which barbasol brands seem to be the best for my legs. But anyway really like this product gets a close shave and really leaves your legs soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> I love my Venus Razor Blades.  It gives you such a close shave.  Definiltey worth the cost. Also the moisturizers bars help keep your skin from being dried out while shaving.</li>
    <li> They must have discontinued the ProSkin razors because I can&#x27;t find them in any store anymore. This is my favorite razor.  I never get cuts and it lathers up nicely while you are shaving. It&#x27;s nice to not need shaving cream. The cons are that Venus cartridges are expensive to buy, but I am a devoted fan so I will stick with them.  I have found Amazon has the best prices on cartridges hands-down.</li>
    <li> Really smooth shave.  The product that surrounds the blades allows the nicest smoothest shave I can get. Almost impossible to nick myself!  Great price from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I rarely cut my legs shaving, maybe once a year if that.  I had been using the Venus Embrace cartridges which I love, but since the ProSkin ones were on sale I decided to try them.  I&#x27;ve cut myself several times since switching over to these.  It doesn&#x27;t matter if I slow down drastically, I still cut myself.  I&#x27;d recommend skipping these, and using the Venus Embrace blades instead.</li>
    <li> I guess the reason I give this four stars is I&#x27;d like to find a razor that never ever cuts you and never ever goes dull.  I don&#x27;t have much to complain about with these razors except that they are fairly pricey.  However, I don&#x27;t use shaving cream which eliminates a step and an expense.  I think these glide the best and give the best shave over knees and in sensitive areas.  In my opinion, they give the best shave from about the 2nd-4th use.  The first time I use one, I always think the moisture strips are a little thick and maybe the razors don&#x27;t get quite as close a shave.  After I&#x27;d say about 5 uses, the strips will be worn down and eventually will fall off in which point the razor is more dangerous to use and by that point pretty dull anyway.  Compared to the Venus Embrace, and many other razors I have tried, this one is my favorite.  I think the Venus with Olay moisture strips is the most similar to this razor but I try to steer clear of extra fragrances when I can.  I do love that I don&#x27;t feel I need to use shaving cream and that saves time.</li>
    <li> Great razors all around. I feel like the bars around them could last a little longer but I&#x27;ve tried quite a few and I still love these.</li>
    <li> I have really sensitive skin and shaving has always given me cuts and bumps. This is the ONE razor I&#x27;ve found that leaves me smooth and soft without irritation. I recommend Aveeno shaving cream as well for sensitive skin. [[ASIN:B0000536EY Aveeno  Therapeutic Shave Gel with Natural Colloidal Oatmeal 7 oz (198 g)]]</li>
    <li> I cannot shave otten- i have very sensitive skin, but this product works great and is much more gentle on my skin than any other brand. I still like to ouse shave gel with it, but you do not have to.</li>
    <li> Love having this available on Subscribe and Save!  I&#x27;ll never go to Costco again!</li>
    <li> My wife uses these but I also ue these on my face due to the fact it is all in one. My wife loves them as do I also, we use them every night they seem to last longer than spa breeze and amazon has best price. Men if you use these on your face the only thing is they do get slick on face and takes a little extra to wash off more than shaving cream, But these things work great.</li>
    <li> The venus razors still need to be used with shaving cream. I use a light shaving cream but also exfoliate before shaving because my skin tends to be very dry on my legs. These razors do their job of helping your skin stay smooth and conditioned. I have tried numerous venus razors and they all leave my skin dry. These don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I have these set up on subscribe and save!  I have to be very careful with my skin - I have no more worries using these.  Have been using them for about  a year now.  No problems yet!</li>
    <li> Yikes, what a mistake. I have been using another type of Gillette Venus razor with moisturizer on the strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These razors have no moisturizer , and I received some nicks as I shaved. I had to stop and apply my moisturizer to my legs to finish the shave. Of course, the moisturizer is thicker than the moisturizer they put on Gillette strips, and the shaver had to be rinsed very frequently. Not a fun shave at all. I don&#x27;t understand why these razors are so different. These razors were as expensive as the razors that contain moisturizer, and they are totally useless. I will throw these razors out and/or find something else to do with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not Recommended For Me. 01-02-14</li>
    <li> If I could give it a 0 I would.  Seriously it is the most painful shave I have ever had and the skin is not left smooth.  I&#x27;m fine for the first few hours but then the burn just creeps up and at times unbearable.  I thought I had a dysfunctional blade and instantly changed it to a new one - same thing.  Man it hurts!  Loved all the Venus products but this one SUCKS.</li>
    <li> I use this only for my underarms and it lasts a long time.  Leaves skin very soft and ready for deodorant.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re okay. Wish the lubricant strips would hang on longer than a week, considering that the blades stay pretty sharp for at least a month.</li>
    <li> These are the only razor blades I&#x27;ll ever use.  The moisturizing strips surrounding the blades make shaving quick and easy.  Shaving use to be a tedious chore; now it&#x27;s an every day habit.  I don&#x27;t use shaving cream any more.  No lathering up each leg from ankle to hip.  Just shave and go.  Done.  Simple.  EASY.  Ain&#x27;t nothin&#x27; better than having smooth legs and pits!  &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been using the venus line for years through its various iterations. i decided to try this because it looked interesting. this is honestly the worst venus product i&#x27;ve used. it does not deliver a close shave and the little bars of moisture goo were almost all desolved after just one shave. and they had a kind of weird smell. but the poor shave is the worst offense.</li>
    <li> The shaving lotion on the head of these razors is awesome. It saves so much time because no other lather is needed, and they also provide a very smooth shave.</li>
    <li> i  like this is very good use and is very fit my phone  thank you very so much ^_^ V</li>
    <li> even though i did get a nick on my knee while shaving it is great.  i really miss the venus vibrence i lost mine and have been searching for something that i liked just as much and have finally found it.  i actually found the cartridges at walmart clearanced and decided to give them a go and im glad i did.</li>
    <li> These make her skin silky smooth !! and it smells great !! just enough blades to get the job done :)</li>
    <li> I have used two of these so far.  It is the smoothest shave.  Not having to apply shaving cream or gel separately is very convenient if you shave in the bathtub especially.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a thirty-five year old woman so I&#x27;ve been shaving for quite a while. For some reason, I&#x27;m like an eleven year old girl shaving for the first time when I use these blades.  I frequently end up with significant cuts when I use these blades.  I was trying to use the entire pack since the blades are pretty pricey but I&#x27;ve decided its just not worth it so I&#x27;m throwing the remaining blades away.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m disappointed with these razors. I&#x27;ve been using Venus razors for years (mostly the Breeze ones) because they&#x27;re the only ones that don&#x27;t irritate my skin. When I saw this Pro Skin razor, I thought it&#x27;d be great for me since I have sensitive skin. I was wrong. It gave me bumps on my legs that I hadn&#x27;t had since before I started using the Breeze razors. Also, they don&#x27;t lather as well as the Breeze ones. It&#x27;s not a complete disappointment because they&#x27;re still better than most other razors, but they are no match for the Breeze series. I won&#x27;t be buying these again.</li>
    <li> These are great for the first two shaves, then the conditioning strip comes off. After the strip comes off it is easy to cut yourself with. Good close conditioning shave at first.</li>
    <li> feels nice, but way to pricey of a product.  I do, however, continue to buy them, so I must like the &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; and closeness of the shave.  The bar does not leave a bad residue, so this is a plus.  Sometimes it is hard to get that right &amp;#34;angle&amp;#34; that is needed.</li>
    <li> Nice but not as good as the breeze and spa breeze. I didn&#x27;t notice a difference in my skin either. I will buy them if they are on sale tho.</li>
    <li> shaving with comfort and ease!</li>
    <li> No nicks, great for sensitive skin</li>
    <li> If you store this outside of your shower, you can greatly increase the longevity of the moisture bars, up to one month (or more, depending on how often you shave).  The constant exposure to the humidity of the shower (even when the razor is not in use) and then drying out, breaks down the moisture bars pretty quickly. I store mine in my medicine cabinet, to keep it from being exposed to moisture when not in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I especially enjoy this product, and have been using variations of the Gillette Venus razor for 10+ years, because when you factor in the costs of buying shaving cream, and regular razors, I feel it is a better deal. (I haven&#x27;t done the math, it&#x27;s just my personal justification)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 3 blades give you an extra close shave, and the head pivots nicely to get around those scary spots, like your kneecaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have pretty sensitive skin and I recently switched from the regular Venus Breeze &amp; Spa Breeze, and I personally think the PROSkin is better for sensitive skin.  But I&#x27;ve also heard the ones infused with Olay are good as well - I have not personally tried them yet, but they are on my list to try next.</li>
    <li> The gel bar around the razor disappears quickly, and I swear it led to more nicks (especially at the knees). I would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> They work. I&#x27;d give them 5 stars if they were priced reasonably.</li>
    <li> No idea why I thought &amp;#34;ProSkin&amp;#34; meant high quality/better products in the little shaving lotion strips....&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m fine with the generic Gillette razors with the lotion strips, but this one cause a severe allergic reaction. I realize a lot of people have reactions to different things, but if you are sensitive to chemical fabric softeners and soaps I&#x27;d recommend trying something else and not take the risk.</li>
