      <li>Great for my daughter, good sun protection and no harsh chemicals.</li>
      <li>I thought I was going to absolutely LOVE it.</li>
      <li>However, with Instanatural&#x27;s SPF Sunscreen lotion, I can use it with make up and don&#x27;t have to rely solely on my foundation&#x27;s SPF anymore and feel more peace of mind having a better SPF.  </li>
      <li>I love InstaNatural products and use almost every product they offer.  </li>
      <li>Wish it was a pump instead so that I could have more control over the volume I get out of it.  </li>
      <li>works no burn with this product seems safe to use.</li>
      <li>I love InstaNatural products and this is no exception.  </li>
      <li>if you don&#x27;t love it (trust me, they honor their guarantee).  </li>
      <li>: Amazon LLC Delivered: 3 days after order date</li>
      <li>smell that so many sunscreens do.  </li>
      <li>But you will love it. :)</li>
      <li>and i liked that it works great for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>It applies great, and not sticky at all like many other sunscreen in the market, which was great.</li>
      <li>If went on easy ,I love the way my skin felt, afterwards from being in the sun for a while</li>
      <li>Great natural feel that is not greasy or oily.</li>
      <li>I like its consistency, as it is easy to spread it out over your skin.</li>
      <li>this product performed beyond my expectations in that it was easy to apply and blended in easily onto my skin.</li>
      <li>Yes, I got one at a discount, but I&#x27;m ordering two more bottles of this right away!  </li>
      <li>Previously, I was using Badger Sunscreen which is an excellent product</li>
      <li>So it works just fine as a sunscreen.  </li>
      <li>But because this dries quickly and isn&#x27;t greasy it is easy to apply before putting clothes on, or even just if you&#x27;re spending a day outdoors with completely clothed, it is great for arms/face/legs that are exposed</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s light</li>
      <li>This is fantastic.  </li>
      <li>it light foundation instead of the BBs and CCs</li>
      <li>Works well, no bad smell, easy to apply.</li>
      <li>It is a very light consistency and dries very fast, leaving the face feeling like there is nothing on it.</li>
      <li>This is one good simple Sunscreen lotion.</li>
      <li>Natural ingredients, feels nice on skin.</li>
      <li>No bad smells.</li>
      <li>Dries quickly -</li>
      <li>It works great, no heavy scent, and it contains 4 ounces for the same price as Badger&#x27;s 2.9 ounce sunscreen ( a huge plus when you use a lot).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Overall I am very pleased with this</li>
      <li>Great little bottle of sunscreen.</li>
      <li>IDK if it is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;--I was given this product for a reduced price for review.</li>
      <li>Great suncreen for my slightly pale skin.</li>
      <li>acclimate to my skin before putting on make up right away,</li>
      <li>It seems to protect well from Sun right now.</li>
      <li>I really,really,needed this sunscreen, if came right on time,First it has a very light scent to it,my skin was very soft and we&#x27;ll moisturized, it really protected our skin when we were at the beach in the hot sun.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty picky when it comes to sunscreen because I find that most are either too oily/greasy, take forever to rub in (to go from white to clear), or better used on either the face OR the body - a lot of the greasier &amp;#34;all</li>
      <li>I read somewhere few years ago that 30SPF is best for daily usage.  </li>
      <li>I think its too early to give this product a fair review, as I have only been using it for a week now, will keep updating the post.</li>
      <li>Quickly and easily went from white to transparent on my skin</li>
      <li>When I first opened this I thought it would be greasy and take forever to rub in.</li>
      <li>When I first swatched this sunscreen on my hand</li>
      <li>The first thing to note is that this does not contain oxybenzone or parabens.  </li>
      <li>but it disappear after some time,but other than that everything else about it is amazing</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s really true, but that&#x27;s when I switched from the ever popular Olay 15SPF lotion to the Olay 30SPF lotion.  </li>
      <li>I am not sure its worth its retail cost, but its a nice product.&lt;br /&gt;I recieved this product free/at a substantial discount for my opinions and review.</li>
      <li>So, you have to blend it really fast</li>
      <li>It squirted too much and it spilled.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t believe how light and sheer</li>
      <li>I really wanted to like this product since it has all the specs that I was looking for.  </li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>,it came really fast</li>
      <li>This is a great non sticky, odorless sunscreen plain and simple.</li>
      <li>I really love that it absorbs well into skin and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky at all like other sunscreens I have used.  </li>
      <li>Works great, no dangerous chemicals, and priced less than other natural sunscreens.  </li>
      <li>I pt right on my bare skin</li>
      <li>If you are looking for a daily non-oily, silicone free sunscreen for your face sensitive or breakout prone skin, order this.  </li>
      <li>I use t his mainly on my face.com</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was offered  a chance to try this with discount, but my opinion is all mine, and unbiased.</li>
      <li>This is especially important as I use it on my face - the aloe vera gel juice base makes it sink naturally into my skin and again, no greasy film, very light and feels like I have nothing on.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The sunscreen comes in a smaller container than I had imagined, that is about as tall as my palm.&lt;br /&gt;But I like its consistency, as it is easy to spread it out over your skin. I will have to see if I break out from the period over the next few days.</li>
    <li> I read somewhere few years ago that 30SPF is best for daily usage.  I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s really true, but that&#x27;s when I switched from the ever popular Olay 15SPF lotion to the Olay 30SPF lotion.  I used that for a few years, and recently switched to Cerave&#x27;s 30SPF lotion.  I never really liked them because they have that vague sunblock smell and the lotion tends to be thicker and not easily absorbed.  However, I continued to use them for the sake of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion was definitely different.  I can&#x27;t believe how light and sheer it is!  It is thinner and more liquidy than other 30SPF lotions I&#x27;ve used before with a very faint scent that was agreeable to me.  It reminded me of a similar SPF lotion I bought from Korea; I don&#x27;t remember the brand, but that one from Korea left me whiter than usual, but this one absorbs well.  Per the directions I waited a few minutes for the lotion to dry before I put on my liquid foundation, and my make-up went on smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The big test was when I used it for a beach day.  I applied it in the morning, drove an hour to the beach, and spent a few hours out there (not in water) with no sunburn. I did not reapply.  Others who were there and forgot sunscreen did get sunburned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative for me is the bottle design.  Wish it was a pump instead so that I could have more control over the volume I get out of it.  It squirted too much and it spilled.  Minus half a star for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased feedback.</li>
    <li> When I first swatched this sunscreen on my hand I thought I was going to absolutely LOVE it. It is a very light consistency and dries very fast, leaving the face feeling like there is nothing on it. Great for oily skin because it has a matte-like finish (I have combination skin). However, the cons are that it leaves a white residue on the skin which is slightly flaky because the product is thin and dries so fast. So, you have to blend it really fast or it will dry up white and streaky. The other problem I had with this was I was unable to wear it under foundation because it rubs off easily and clumps making the foundation look clumpy and the skin looks like it is peeling after a sunburn or a chemical peel. So I won&#x27;t be using it under my foundation. I will still use it for pool/beach days, but it is not waterproof so it will need to be reapplied often. I would recommend this product to someone who does not wear foundation and has oily skin, but at this price point IDK if it is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;--I was given this product for a reduced price for review. My opinions are honest and not in any way swayed because of this.</li>
    <li> Great for my daughter, good sun protection and no harsh chemicals.</li>
    <li> works no burn with this product seems safe to use. Received for honest opinion review. Thanks</li>
    <li> Excellent product, nice light scent, non-greasy feel being aloe vera based, cocoa butter and green tea added as anti-oxidants, and zinc oxide and titanium dioxide for UVA and UVB protection.  I really love that it absorbs well into skin and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky at all like other sunscreens I have used.  This is especially important as I use it on my face - the aloe vera gel juice base makes it sink naturally into my skin and again, no greasy film, very light and feels like I have nothing on.  I&#x27;d still let it rest/acclimate to my skin before putting on make up right away, but that&#x27;s just like any other step when you are prepping your face (like serums, moisturizers or primers).  Before I was using BB creams with built in SPF, but felt like it wasn&#x27;t enough protection being only SPF 15.  Other sunscreens were very heavy and left a greasy residue that would interfere with make up coverage, so I&#x27;d often skip it.  However, with Instanatural&#x27;s SPF Sunscreen lotion, I can use it with make up and don&#x27;t have to rely solely on my foundation&#x27;s SPF anymore and feel more peace of mind having a better SPF.  I received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased feedback.</li>
    <li> Great sunscreen and no smell at all. Definately a plus</li>
    <li> I really,really,needed this sunscreen, if came right on time,First it has a very light scent to it,my skin was very soft and we&#x27;ll moisturized, it really protected our skin when we were at the beach in the hot sun.If went on easy ,I love the way my skin felt, afterwards from being in the sun for a while I had no sunburn,I am really happy with this sunscreen.I HAVE RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNT FOR MY HONEST AND UNBIASED FEEDBACK.</li>
    <li> The first thing to note is that this does not contain oxybenzone or parabens.  It uses the better-for-you zinc oxide and titanium dioxide.  So it works just fine as a sunscreen.  I have very fair skin and had no sun issues while using it.  The very best thing about it for me is that it does not have that strong in-your-face smell that so many sunscreens do.  I cannot use those because the smell puts my husband into an immediate asthma attack.  He is very sensitive to scents and this does not bother him.  And, believe me, finding a sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t bother him (on me!) has been an ongoing very tough problem.</li>
    <li> This is one good simple Sunscreen lotion. I use t his mainly on my face.com It doe not feel greedy, and feels good on the skin. Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was offered  a chance to try this with discount, but my opinion is all mine, and unbiased.</li>
    <li> Great suncreen for my slightly pale skin. it does leave a white film,but it&#x27;s not really noticeable on my skin. Others with a darker skin tone might not really like this effect. work great for me.</li>
    <li> This product has minimal scent and is not sticky unlike other sunscreens. I have olive skin and don&#x27;t really notice white streaks on my skin at all. My son does not mind putting this sunscreen on, which he usually has a problem with other sunscreens. I like the lightness of this lotion as well and perfect for the dairy use.</li>
    <li> i love this sun protector it help to protect me from aging lol&lt;br /&gt;I like using under my makeup&lt;br /&gt;the only problem I have is that it does leave a white look on your face but it disappear after some time,but other than that everything else about it is amazing,it came really fast the seller contact me before it arrive to teach me how to use and everything.&lt;br /&gt;great product great price super recomend it</li>
    <li> Not a product to wear daily,  maybe to go to the pool.  It turns your face white.</li>
    <li> this product performed beyond my expectations in that it was easy to apply and blended in easily onto my skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty picky when it comes to sunscreen because I find that most are either too oily/greasy, take forever to rub in (to go from white to clear), or better used on either the face OR the body - a lot of the greasier &amp;#34;all day waterproof protection&amp;#34; just have never been good when I&#x27;ve put them on my face. When I first opened this I thought it would be greasy and take forever to rub in. But I am happy to say I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;1. Not oily or greasy&lt;br /&gt;2. Quickly and easily went from white to transparent on my skin - did not take forever to rub in.&lt;br /&gt;3. Dries quickly - I know you&#x27;re supposed to apply sunscreen 15min or so before you go outside, but I almost never do this because I never want to put sunscreen on before I have to put clothes on to drive or bike to the beach or pool, so I always put it on when I get there. But because this dries quickly and isn&#x27;t greasy it is easy to apply before putting clothes on, or even just if you&#x27;re spending a day outdoors with completely clothed, it is great for arms/face/legs that are exposed&lt;br /&gt;4. I&#x27;m shocked to say this, but this is a sunscreen that I (although I haven&#x27;t yet) could apply under my makeup - yes, it is that non-greasy of a formula.&lt;br /&gt;5. 100% Natural is a plus&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;1. It says reapply every 2 hours or later swimming, sweating or towel drying.&lt;br /&gt;2. It&#x27;s 4oz. I guess I&#x27;m just used to bottles of sunscreen being larger(?)... But because it&#x27;s good for face and body I guess it makes sense because a lot of sunscreens touted by beauty brands as being &amp;#34;face&amp;#34; sunscreens are usually in smaller bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would be a great bottle to keep in the car just to have on hand if you&#x27;re going somewhere where you&#x27;ll be walking out side a lot or forget to put some on before going out. Overall I am very pleased with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE***&lt;br /&gt;I took this sunscreen on a family vacation to the beach and applied it to my face, neck, d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute;, and arms and did not get burned any day I was there.  I got sunburned on my thighs but I used some other sunscreen there, but the areas I applied this sunscreen I did not get burned and I only reapplied it a couple of the days and was spending about 3-5 hours in the sun each day.  So I have to say I am even more pleased and impressed with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;___________________________________________&lt;br /&gt;Sold at discounted rate for review by: Instanatural LLC&lt;br /&gt;Shipped by: Amazon LLC&lt;br /&gt;Delivered: 3 days after order datet I used some other sunscreen there, but the areas I applied this sunscreen I did not get burned and I only reapplied it a couple of the days and was spending about 3-5 hours in the sun each day.

    <li> Great natural feel that is not greasy or oily. The package was shipped and delivered to my house in 2 days!</li>
    <li> Good sunscreen but I don&#x27;t like the white streaks it leaves on my skin. I have to scrub it off to get rid of it.</li>
    <li> Works well, no bad smell, easy to apply.</li>
    <li> A nice non greasy sunblock. I use it under my makeup. I even put some on my 9mo old son in a pinch. I am not sure its worth its retail cost, but its a nice product.&lt;br /&gt;I recieved this product free/at a substantial discount for my opinions and review.</li>
    <li> I love InstaNatural products and this is no exception.  My daughter and I have very fair screen and burn very easily.  When you have to wear sunscreen everyday of summer you begin to explore the ingredients that are in your sunscreen.  I recently learned about chemical sunscreen&#x27;s dangers to our heath and our environment (http://www.ewg.org/2015sunscreen/report/the-trouble-with-sunscreen-chemicals/).  InstaNatural does not contain Oxybenzone or Octinoxate- the two worst chemicals.  Previously, I was using Badger Sunscreen which is an excellent product but when I saw InstaNatural had a product I decided to give it a try.  It works great, no heavy scent, and it contains 4 ounces for the same price as Badger&#x27;s 2.9 ounce sunscreen ( a huge plus when you use a lot).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my new go to sunscreen.  Works great, no dangerous chemicals, and priced less than other natural sunscreens.  If you care about your health and the environment give this product a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given a special price to try this product but all they asked for in return was an honest opinion (I could say I hate it and qualify for the price).  InstaNatural knows if they can get people to try their products, the quality will speak for itself.  Plus, this company has excellent customer service! They send a follow-up email asking how you like their product every time you buy.  And it&#x27;s not just for show- if you email them back a real person answers (usually within 24 hours).  What business does that anymore? InstaNatural does. Love their products and I love this company!</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a daily non-oily, silicone free sunscreen for your face sensitive or breakout prone skin, order this.  Try it.  Get your money back if you don&#x27;t love it (trust me, they honor their guarantee).  But you will love it. :).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have such a hard time finding sunscreen for my face because I have trouble with breakouts, and anything containing silicones/dimethicone clog my pores (trap bacteria or however it works). Well this one doesn&#x27;t, so when I received an offer to review for an honest review I gave it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied it the first morning after receiving it, and never looked back.  I pt right on my bare skin and it is not greasy at all, left my skin pretty matte with a slight white cast (not too bad, but a visible white cast...but not shiny) and I applied my mineral foundation over it.  My skin looked great all day, and no breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since then I&#x27;ve used as my daily sunscreen under a powder it light foundation instead of the BBs and CCs I&#x27;d been using.  I bet tired of relying on BB creams for sunblock because I don&#x27;t always want a heavy foundation.  This is fantastic.  Applied on my kids before they went to the pool yesterday and no one was pink!  Yes, I got one at a discount, but I&#x27;m ordering two more bottles of this right away!  Perfect size for your beach bag, I wish it came in a 16-ounce pump style bottle for the summer, but this works for me for now :)</li>
    <li> This works perfectly.  I took this product with me to Florida and it protected me from the sun.</li>
    <li> This is a great non sticky, odorless sunscreen plain and simple. If you have darker skin you WILL see a slight white cast. I&#x27;d recommend rubbing it in your hands with a little of InstaNatural&#x27;s aloe Vera gel. It&#x27;ll dry fast and go on clear.</li>
    <li> Not absorbed by the skin and keeps the white lines on the face</li>
    <li> I love InstaNatural products and use almost every product they offer.  I really wanted to like this product since it has all the specs that I was looking for.  Unfortunately, I could not even use this product because it turns my face white.  At first, I thought I needed to add extra moisturizer to prevent that from happening. However, even using this product after applying jojoba oil to my skin, I still see the white streaks that it leaves.  I would say use this product as a hand SPF but it actually makes my hands quite dry.  Sorry InstaNatural - This product really diverts from the quality that all your other products display.</li>
    <li> I tried this sunscreen with the hope that it would perform as well as the moisturizers (which I like very much) - unfortunately, it does not.  I had the same streaking, lack of absorbency and flakiness that others describe.  It was also difficult to completely remove after a day on the beach and left my skin very dry.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for a natural sunscreen, and it&#x27;s hard to find any (natural or not) that goes on light like lotion. This does! I can put it on my face shoulders, etc in the morning if I&#x27;m gonna be outside and not feel / smell like I&#x27;m headed to the beach. Really nice!</li>
    <li> Very nice, non greasy, smell is fine and it works. :)</li>
    <li> Great lotion, good protection and it&#x27;s light</li>
    <li> This sunscreen seems to do what it&#x27;s intended to as far as protecting from the sun. However, I didn&#x27;t like the white coating it left on my naturally pale skin.</li>
    <li> I think its too early to give this product a fair review, as I have only been using it for a week now, will keep updating the post. July 2015 - It applies great, and not sticky at all like many other sunscreen in the market, which was great. It seems to protect well from Sun right now. I have been using it for daily use with limited exposure, havent had a chance to try it on a beach or a whole day out.  Took out one star as it left visible white sheen on my skin. I couldn&#x27;t get rid of it simply by massaging and absorbing it for 1-2min.. Not sure if it is my bottle or everyone is facing this. Update: For the white sheen I tried using lesser amounts, and quickly rubbing the lotion into the skin. Dont let it sit on your skin, even for 4-5 sec. After that it works like a charm!</li>
    <li> Awsome!!! ...It truly is a great product, but of course there is not one product from this company that i have tried that I don&#x27;t like.</li>
    <li> Light pleasant scent! 100%protection</li>
    <li> Natural ingredients, feels nice on skin. I also bought Badger sunscreen, but it is hard to spread and makes you look all white. This one is not like that. I like it!</li>
    <li> I use this product daily on my neck and décolleté, it is not greasy and prevents spots caused from sun exposure. I am unable to use the product on my face due to breakouts. But I will buy again.</li>
    <li> Great little bottle of sunscreen. I had no allergic reactions to this product, it goes on thick but is easily absorbed into the skin, and leaves no greasy residue. I wouldn&#x27;t use this on my face as it is a bit too thick for my liking, but I will keep this little bottle in my bag to use on my shoulders when wearing tank tops and other short sleeved tops.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in the sun every day and this is the absolute best sunscreen I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t sting and if you work it in, doesn&#x27;t appear too white.  No bad smells.</li>
    <li> Used it and didn&#x27;t experienced any sunburn and i liked that it works great for sensitive skin. No irritation compared to chemical sunscreens.</li>
