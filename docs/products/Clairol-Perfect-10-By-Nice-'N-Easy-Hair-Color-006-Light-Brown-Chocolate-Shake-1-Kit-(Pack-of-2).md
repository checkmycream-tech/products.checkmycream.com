      <li>The gal who cuts my hair is impressed with it.</li>
      <li>Great Transaction and product!</li>
      <li>My hair is the perfect shade of brown with nary a streak in sight.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s is the perfect color for me</li>
      <li>The best hair collor Ihave used in thirty years.  </li>
      <li>The 10 minute processing time is the best part of this product.</li>
      <li>--it&#x27;s perfect, every time.</li>
      <li>Colour was beautiful after drying my hair.</li>
      <li>maybe you just can&#x27;t get a great one over the counter even though I wish you could.</li>
      <li>This is a great color for me.</li>
      <li>will buy again, price is great also.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t buy this in stores anymore, don&#x27;t know why, it&#x27;s a great product</li>
      <li>One, great coverage.  </li>
      <li>For great coverage...</li>
      <li>I loved it.  </li>
      <li>She says no one else she has seen who colors their own hair has results this good.</li>
      <li>am using it for more than 3 months and steel believe it was a good purchase.</li>
      <li>It is also very easy to use.</li>
      <li>Love this product because it does a good job and is quick.</li>
      <li>Love this color.  </li>
      <li>This is my favorite hair color product.</li>
      <li>&amp; I love the conditioner that comes with it.</li>
      <li>The comb applicator makes the aplication  Quick and easy.</li>
      <li>The color is rich and is always softer after it&#x27;s done.</li>
      <li>, color stays true much longer than anything I&#x27;ve gotten over the counter.</li>
      <li>This hair color works better for me than any other I have used and it is so easy.</li>
      <li>I like this product very much.  </li>
      <li>but make sure you use this product in a well-ventilated area, preferably one with a window you can open and allow for air-circulation.</li>
      <li>The great coverage is probably due to the comp attachement which screws into the bottle in place of the regular tapered applicator.  </li>
      <li>very nice,easy to apply</li>
      <li>It is fast and lasts for six weeks.  </li>
      <li>I bought two boxes of the Clairol Perfect 10 Light Brown last week (my hair is past my shoulders therefore needing more product) in hopes of turning my bleached blonde hair back to as close to my natural hair color as I possibly could.  </li>
      <li>It is so hard to find a at-home product that works great and is the actual color you want.</li>
      <li>The color looks very natural and leaves the hair very silky.</li>
      <li>: when I had my hair colored professionally, I paid way too much to buy just the conditioner on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Plus the ease of use; foam is easy to apply, and requires only 10 minutes left on.  </li>
      <li>When it came time to hop in the shower and rinse, my eyes actually watered, and I&#x27;m surprised I didn&#x27;t walk out of the bathroom higher than a kite.    </li>
      <li>In just ten minutes I have full grey coverage with long-lasting, shiny color.</li>
      <li>Not only did it make it easy to cover ALL of my hair (which is thick too, making it hard to dye myself) but also SUPER fast.  </li>
      <li>Sometimes going from light to dark, and especially when you are donning the plastic gloves solo, you might not get all the areas and come out with a few misplaced, oddball streaks of light colored hair in a sea of brown.  </li>
      <li>A little more expensive but worth it.</li>
      <li>This is the only hair color that I find compares to going to a salon; results are natural and lasting and don&#x27;t dry the hair.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this product because it does a good job and is quick. This is a great color for me.</li>
    <li> Great Transaction and product! No Problems!</li>
    <li> Like that it only takes 10 minutes instead of 20-40 min.</li>
    <li> I bought two boxes of the Clairol Perfect 10 Light Brown last week (my hair is past my shoulders therefore needing more product) in hopes of turning my bleached blonde hair back to as close to my natural hair color as I possibly could.  Three things.  One, great coverage.  Sometimes going from light to dark, and especially when you are donning the plastic gloves solo, you might not get all the areas and come out with a few misplaced, oddball streaks of light colored hair in a sea of brown.  Not the case with this product.  My hair is the perfect shade of brown with nary a streak in sight.  Which brings me to point two.  The great coverage is probably due to the comp attachement which screws into the bottle in place of the regular tapered applicator.  I loved it.  Not only did it make it easy to cover ALL of my hair (which is thick too, making it hard to dye myself) but also SUPER fast.  I was done applying the color in record time.  So... why only THREE stars?  It stank.  And when I say stank, I mean STANK!  I actually don&#x27;t ever remember applying hair dye with such a pungent smell before.  When it came time to hop in the shower and rinse, my eyes actually watered, and I&#x27;m surprised I didn&#x27;t walk out of the bathroom higher than a kite.    Recommend?  For great coverage... yes... but make sure you use this product in a well-ventilated area, preferably one with a window you can open and allow for air-circulation.</li>
    <li> Love this color.  Been using it for years.  Wish it was still in stores.  Mix this with a darker color for my grays and then use this color by itself on the rest of my hair.</li>
    <li> very nice,easy to apply</li>
    <li> Have been using the product for years. It&#x27;s is the perfect color for me &amp; I love the conditioner that comes with it. The gal who cuts my hair is impressed with it. She says no one else she has seen who colors their own hair has results this good.</li>
    <li> I felt sick during the 10 minutes recommender for colouring. Colour was beautiful after drying my hair. My roots were white again after two weeks. The change is not favourable, price is higher, results not as expected, I will stick to my previous Clairol product.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t buy this in stores anymore, don&#x27;t know why, it&#x27;s a great product, color stays true much longer than anything I&#x27;ve gotten over the counter.</li>
    <li> arrived promptly and as promised</li>
    <li> The best hair collor Ihave used in thirty years.  It is fast and lasts for six weeks.  Please do not discontinue.</li>
    <li> As promised work perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy again, price is great also.&lt;br /&gt;I am using it for more than 3 months and steel believe it was a good purchase.</li>
    <li> The 10 minute processing time is the best part of this product. It is also very easy to use. An additional benefit is that natural differences in hair color come through as subtle highlights.</li>
    <li> Covering my grey hair is my thorn my side -- I go to the salon every 6 weeks...but by about 3 I start to see the gray and I HATE it...it drives me crazy and i&#x27;m only 41 and it makes me feel like I look 50.  Anyway - I keep trying to find something I can use to touch up my roots that covers till I can see my stylist...I&#x27;ve tried probably 10 different over the counter products and they all seem about the same -- cover good...seem to do the trick by about 1 1/2 weeks later it seems to have somewhat washed away...this one is the best I&#x27;ve found yet and I&#x27;ll buy it again...maybe you just can&#x27;t get a great one over the counter even though I wish you could.</li>
    <li> This is the only hair color that I find compares to going to a salon; results are natural and lasting and don&#x27;t dry the hair.  Plus the ease of use; foam is easy to apply, and requires only 10 minutes left on.  Plus the best hair conditioner I&#x27;ve found: when I had my hair colored professionally, I paid way too much to buy just the conditioner on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This hair color works better for me than any other I have used and it is so easy.</li>
    <li> The comb applicator makes the aplication  Quick and easy. The color looks very natural and leaves the hair very silky.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years.  I am unable to find the color I like locally any more.  I like this product very much.  I like the fact that it only takes ten minutes.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hair color product. I can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore and I&#x27;m not sure why.  It really only takes 10 minutes. The color is rich and is always softer after it&#x27;s done. It is so hard to find a at-home product that works great and is the actual color you want.</li>
    <li> For my hair (very dark brown), it usually takes longer than 10 minutes, but you can&#x27;t beat the color--it&#x27;s perfect, every time.</li>
    <li> In just ten minutes I have full grey coverage with long-lasting, shiny color. A little more expensive but worth it.</li>
