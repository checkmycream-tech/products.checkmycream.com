<li> Adjustable, so I have not had any problems with it being too loose and slipping off, or being too tight and giving me a headache.</li>
<li> Definitely too thin.</li>
<li> It still slips in my hair- and because it is not at all stretchy its not easy to readjust without having to loosen it and start all over.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s just an ordinary looking headband, which I believe is overpriced.  </li>
<li> Too bad.</li>
<li> I was very disappointed in this headband.  </li>
