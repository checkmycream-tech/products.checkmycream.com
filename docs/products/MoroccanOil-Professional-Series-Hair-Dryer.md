      <li>I expected much more from this brand especially for the price!  </li>
      <li>It really does give me a professional quality blow out in 10 minutes and my hair is not dried out or damaged.</li>
      <li>It is lightweight and easy to use to style your hair with round brushes.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;- Attachments fit tightly and stay on the end of the dryer</li>
      <li>Recently, I began using Moroccanoil products and I notice much improvement.</li>
      <li>Even if you are going for the messy look instead of smooth</li>
      <li>Moroccanoil Professional Series Hair Dryer is a sub par product.</li>
      <li>My hair has gained shine, strength, and it natural curl.  </li>
      <li>I read about the Moroccanoil Professional Hair Dryer.</li>
      <li>The nozzle is wider than my old dryer, which worked, but I wanted to get this one.  </li>
      <li>I ordered the Moroccanoil Professional hair dryer from Hair Beauty World.</li>
      <li>My old dryer had died the day I ordered this one</li>
      <li>I instantly washed my hair and plugged in the new dryer!  </li>
      <li>I would definitely not recommend this brand, not worth the price for something that cheaply made.</li>
      <li>I had bought this dryer based on reviews that it had a lot of power and dried hair quickly.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;- very lightweight compared to other dryers I&#x27;ve owned</li>
      <li>First time out of the box - the drying worked for just a few minutes and then shut off.  </li>
      <li>But the ends were still very dry especially after using the my old basic hair dryer.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This dryer is so much better than the Chi I had before it. It really does give me a professional quality blow out in 10 minutes and my hair is not dried out or damaged. I do color treat my hair, so I don&#x27;t use the dryer to straighten it every day, but when I do, this dryer gives me the results I want.</li>
    <li> I love this blow dryer.  Dries my fine hair quickly but without blowing it all over the place and tangling it (as did my previous, very pricey dryer).  I definitely notice a difference when I use a different blow dryer (travelling, at the gym, etc).  Best of all, I got this for a LOT less ordering here than I could find it locally for sale, so that&#x27;s a bonus.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser had recommended it for me and she used it. I love it  I am not sure why but my curly hair dries without frizz.  My old dryer had died the day I ordered this one and it arrived in 2 days.  The dryer is great and so is Amazon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve wanted this hair dryer for quite some time - and i couldn&#x27;t be any happier with the customer service i got, how fast the shipping was, and to top it off i love love love this hair dryer!! It has 3 settings, and dries my hair very fast. Very happy with this purchase!!</li>
    <li> First time out of the box - the drying worked for just a few minutes and then shut off.  I tried this several times over a period of days with the same results.  I expected much more from this brand especially for the price!  I did return the item.</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer!! It dries my hair super fast and doesn&#x27;t make it frizzy. Definetly would recommend it!!</li>
    <li> Love this blow dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The heat and effectiveness of this dryer makes it one of the best on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it to any woman.</li>
    <li> I bought this in November 2014 after my Chi hairdryer stopped working ( I had it for 10 years!).  I was happy with the Moroccanoil hairdryer until I dropped it and the fan inside broke into pieces. I should mention that it landed in my bathroom rug, not the floor but after that the plastic pieces inside were burning every time I turned it on and it was impossible to keep using it. I contacted the seller and they responded that they were going to check the warranty but I never heard back from them.  I am very disappointed that such an expensive hairdryer broke so easily, I dropped my old Chi several times over the years and it never broke.  I would definitely not recommend this brand, not worth the price for something that cheaply made. Now I have to invest in another expensive hairdryer in less than 6 months.</li>
    <li> I have a a Babyliss hair dryer and although I love it it&#x27;s very heavy!! My hairdresser has the Moroccanoil dryer and commented on how light it was so I ordered it. I really like it! Yes, the placement of the switches are not great. I&#x27;ve turned it off or down a few times but it&#x27;s so light you can adjust your hand to your liking. I could never do that with my Babyliss. I&#x27;m happy overall!</li>
    <li> This is working well for me. I like the heat settings and have no problems holding it as some others have said. The various settings are good and give a wide variety of heat and force. My hair looks much better so it manages the friz well.</li>
    <li> This is the best hairdryer I have ever owned. Shipping was fast! Communication from the seller was outstanding ! Great job!</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Im very happy with my purchase</li>
    <li> This is a great dryer.  My hairdresser has one.  It is very light-weight and heats up instantly to a very hot temp if you want it that hot.  I think I have cut down my drying time by several minutes by using this dryer.  I highly recomment it.</li>
    <li> This is my new best hair dryer.  The nozzle is wider than my old dryer, which worked, but I wanted to get this one.  My stylist used it on me the last time I had my trim.  It&#x27;s so light and easy to use.  Long cord so you don&#x27;t yank it out of the wall when you are drying your LONG hair.  I like the cool shot button that stays in until you click it off.  They even give you an extra filter.  So lightweight.  I love it.  No frizz, dries your hair fast and it&#x27;s easy to work with.</li>
    <li> What is so great about this dryer and sets it apart from other cheap hair dryers?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It is lightweight and easy to use to style your hair with round brushes. You don&#x27;t feel like you need an extra arm to pull it off. ( I recommend the Moroccanoil round brush that has the little tail comb at the end of it)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Temperature controls are great, there is no burning your scalp on medium heat. Also there is a cold shot button you push in and it locks so no holding it in while using the cold shot. If you are changing the temp on your dryer and feel no change your cold button is locked in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Even if you are going for the messy look instead of smooth it is just so easy to accomplish with a great finished look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t live without this hair dryer now. Don&#x27;t know if any of you feel this way but I used to dread to dry my hair. You don&#x27;t stand there forever making your shoulders soar fumbling with the dryer and and brush. My hair looks so much better now. Everyone has been commenting on how nice my hair looks and asking what I have done differently. Another thing is it has cut down a lot of time I spend on drying my hair. I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> Love the dryers!! I received them quickly and I heard they are no longer in production! :(  they need to keep making it!</li>
    <li> I had bought this dryer based on reviews that it had a lot of power and dried hair quickly. Here are the pros&lt;br /&gt;- multiple heat and air settings&lt;br /&gt;- Attachments fit tightly and stay on the end of the dryer&lt;br /&gt;- very lightweight compared to other dryers I&#x27;ve owned&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;- other dryers I&#x27;ve owned have small wings that allow the dryer to stand up when you place it on the counter  (even with the motor running).  This dryer will only lay on it&#x27;s side.If you place it down while the motor is running, it will blow itself around.&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t seem to get as hot as my old dryer even on the hottest setting.</li>
    <li> excellent efficient well balanced hair blower</li>
    <li> Moroccanoil Professional Series Hair Dryer is a sub par product. It is no better than what you can buy for $25.00 at Walmart. Others said this offers less drying time and softer hair. I have not experienced none for that. What really bothers me is the placement of the orange button. I&#x27;m constantly (without trying)pressing it while drying my hair. It is extremely annoying!! Save you money...</li>
    <li> It is comparable to the most expensive Chi hair dryer but much more economical. It has rubber spots on it so it doesn&#x27;t slip off the counter when you put it down and the cold shot button remains on until you push it again. It is compact and it dries my hair in very little time. Great investment piece!</li>
    <li> I was so excited when I received mine today. I instantly washed my hair and plugged in the new dryer!  Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t get WARM!! It only stays in the cold setting! I am so sad.  I used my friends last week and absolutely fell in love with it.  I sure hope I hear back from the company and they exchange it for me!</li>
    <li> Blow dryer is so great I ordered a second for my mother. I was surprised at how quickly it arrived as I ordered it on the Friday before Presidents day and it arrived on Tuesday (even under normal circumstances it would have been extremely fast). The blow dryer works amazing, its heats evenly and dries my hair in virtually no time. It came with 3 attachments, all of which look sturdy and good quality. Overall, I&#x27;m loving it, enough to purchase another as a gift.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is fabulous!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair has been overly processed and since I live in Southwest Florida my hair gets its share of the sunshine. Recently, I began using Moroccanoil products and I notice much improvement. But the ends were still very dry especially after using the my old basic hair dryer. I sensed the hairdryer was the culprit. I read about the Moroccanoil Professional Hair Dryer. However, it was over $200.00. I could not imagine a dryer being worth that much. I went back and did more studying and research.  As I did my research I began to realize that any competent hairdryer has a comparable cost. Still, it seem to be an enormous amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I found this hairdryer on Amazon by the seller Hair Beauty World. I ordered the Moroccanoil Professional hair dryer from Hair Beauty World. The company was fabulous. My dryer arrived well packed within just a few days. I was very happy. This story of success get better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From my first use of the Moroccanoil Professional Hair Dryer, my hair began to gain its luster. The dryer has a “cool shot” button that is helpful. The cool shot button is conveniently located where it is easily accessible while the dryer is in use. Often, I use the Curl Defining Diffuser. I can leave the dryer in place and before the heat gets too hot I can easily give my hair a shot of cool air.  My hair is no longer frizzy or dried out.My hair has gained shine, strength, and it natural curl.  My hair dries quickly and looks amazing. I now receive compliments about my hair that before I had this hairdryer, was a thing of the past. Check out Morccanoil website. The website helped me understand the quality of the product.&lt;br /&gt;http://www.moroccanoil.com/usa/h_us_en/mo2000-professional-series-tourmaline-ceramic-hair-dryer-1131</li>
    <li> Very happy with the dryer but it must have come on horseback as it took almost 3 weeks to get here</li>
</ol>
