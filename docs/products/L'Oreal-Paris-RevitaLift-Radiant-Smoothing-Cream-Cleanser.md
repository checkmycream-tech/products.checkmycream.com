<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Item seems to be doing a great job of cleaning my face of any makeup.&lt;br /&gt;Only thing I am not happy about is the product container. It wants to ooze out.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe when I’ve used up more it will stop this oozing out on my counter.&lt;br /&gt;a nice flat lid to set up with, but spills out onto the lid etc.</li>
    <li> This cleanser is absolutely fantastic,  a small amount gives you a luxurious clean feeling. I would recommend this for any age skin.</li>
    <li> It cleans nicely. Smell is soft and discrete. Leaves my face feeling clean and not dry. Even my sensitive no smell dove soap leaves my face feeling dry. This product doesn&#x27;t. I have ordered two so far. I know i could go buy them in a store, but really enjoy shopping here and they just show up at my door:P</li>
    <li> I have very dry mature skin and this cleanser made it even more drier! Scubbers are for pots not faces!</li>
    <li> very moisturizing cleanser</li>
    <li> This product is great especially I think for older skin that is dry or sensitive. I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> used it for years, skin is soft and radiant!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s..using it for past 2 and a half years.It always gives me fresh look,no need a \\&quot;beauty-sleep\\&quot; for evening out or party, after a daily rough day.I use it as a message cream too and do it by myself.  Try it ...you gonna love it...just like me :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had problems with soap and cleansers. They would leave my face feeling dry. Not this one. Sometimes I use it twice a day, along with related products, and it feels really nice. As other people mentioned before, a little bit goes a long way. Don&#x27;t use much at all, you will have this product for a long time.</li>
    <li> i like it n still using</li>
    <li> ok so unlike many cream cleansers this stuff leaves my skin feeling clean and not tacky. Love the fact that it takes of makeup/impurites but does not dry out my skin</li>
    <li> This is the best cleanser I have ever used and I am thrilled to get it! I have had super dry, sensitive skin from taking lots of meds and diabetes, rash-like irritation on my face, so I tried this and I do not need to add a moisturizer at all after washing my face now! I usually am allergic to all I ever try, but so far, so good. I love this new face~ it feels great!  The best features of this product are the way that it makes my face feel so clean, smooth and silky. Also, the way this product is a cleanser, but exfoliates the skin while it cleans is awesome. I am seeing fine lines on my face leaving too.</li>
    <li> Doing good job. Recommended</li>
    <li> So far, so good! I&#x27;m 25 with oily, acne-prone skin and usually stay away from cream cleansers because I feel like they&#x27;ll leave a residue or clog my pores and break me out. However, this is different from other creamy cleansers because it lathers up a lot and it&#x27;s non-comedogenic (I double checked the ingredients to make sure nothing would break me out.)  My skin&#x27;s been weird lately since I moved to a drier climate and, even though it&#x27;s still oily, it also seems to need a gentler cleanser instead of my usual harsh scrubs and acne face washes. My acne medications dry my skin out sometimes so I feel like my cleanser needs to be less drying but still clean my skin well. This does just that! I&#x27;m getting older too and starting to see nasolabial folds and I&#x27;m trying to \\&quot;pamper\\&quot; my skin more instead of trying to beat it into submission. This cleanser definitely pampers my skin. You only need a tiny bit because it foams up a lot (you lather it in your hand first and then apply to your face.) It cleanses well but doesn&#x27;t strip my skin of moisture or leave a residue. My skin looked great after cleansing with this-  healthy complexion and diminished pores. I still use my Neutrogena makeup remover wipes at night before using this because I don&#x27;t think it would clean all of my makeup off on it&#x27;s own. Overall this is a good buy and it will last me forever because a little goes a long way. I bought this on a whim at the supermarket without reading the MUA reviews (which usually ends up with me regretting not checking them first). It cost me $16, which is double the amount that it costs at Amazon (sigh, that&#x27;s what I get for buying skincare at the supermarket!)</li>
    <li> I was using clean &amp; clear, which I love, but it seemed like it just quit working for me. I used this &amp; it cleared my face right up. I don&#x27;t have bad skin to begin with, but this cleared up the small bumps I did have. Also, u don&#x27;t need a lot- just a dime size or maybe even smaller, will wash ur entire face. You don&#x27;t have to waste it so it lasts longer.</li>
    <li> I have extremely extremely extremely oily skin on my face. I have tried countless cleansers and scrubs, but this one not only washes away the oil very well and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my face. I bought a few more tubes for travel and the office. Will be using only this one from now on.</li>
    <li> I would have to say that none of what the product says it will do is true.  I would only use this product if you have extremely oily skin, otherwise, it just dries your face to a point where your face just looks like you just walked out of the desert.</li>
    <li> Very efficient-a pea size amount is enough to wash face and neck. Cleans well.</li>
    <li> Perfect every day cleanser-- better than more expensive brands.  My skin type is combination.  This doesn&#x27;t cause breakout but no tightness or dry patches in sight.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year now and just love how it cleans my face without being too harsh.  Price is great too.  Will be ordering more I&#x27;m sure.</li>
    <li> I have \\&quot;mature\\&quot; skin and love the creaminess of this low-foaming cream cleanser (I prefer not to lather it up in my hand first so it won&#x27;t drip into my eyes when I use my Mia), and so far it works the best, even better than the Philosophy cleanser sample that came with the Mia.  I have a host of skin issues -- a bit of rosacea, dryness, eczema, and other skin sensitivities, but so far so good.  I don&#x27;t feel dried out and the creamy consistency of the cleanser helps the Mia glide over my face without drying up before I complete my cleansing cycle. It also rinsed off pretty well, other cream cleansers felt like there was a film on my face. I purchased this product from a well-known drugstore and paid nearly $9.00 for it, so Amazon&#x27;s price is a good deal. While I really love this product, my only personal draw-back is that it&#x27;s most likely animal tested, and I try to make a conscious effort to purchase products from companies that don&#x27;t animal test (not easy with my skin issues); however, if that&#x27;s not an issue for you, I believe you will enjoy this product.</li>
    <li> I ran out of the usual cream cleanser I use and took a chance on ordering a skin product I had never tried.  I LOVE this cleanser! It is creamy, smells good and my skin feels and looks clean. It lathers up in to a nice, rich, thick lather and feels so good on my face. Great product.</li>
    <li> Super Creamy...been using it a long time now and love it!</li>
    <li> I love this product. Didn&#x27;t cost a ton of money. The results are great. My skin is so soft and clean I love it.</li>
    <li> I love L&#x27;Oreal not a bad price cheaper than the store. I would recommend this to anyone that likes to keep their skin healthy.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for 5 years, and is a great men&#x27;s face cleanser.</li>
    <li> This is my first time trying this product and it really feels nice on my face, not scratchy at all</li>
    <li> I have to say I am absolutely thrilled with how well this product has worked.  I&#x27;m in my mid 20&#x27;s and have skin that ranges from dry and flakey to acne ridden.  This is an awesome solution to when my acne medication dries out my skin and doesn&#x27;t contribute to it like other moisturizers I have tried over the years.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a solution to dry skin.</li>
    <li> This really removes your makeup and leaves your skin feeling really nice.  I&#x27;ve been using it in combo with the day/wrinkle cream and have seen amazing results in just two days.  These products work better than some that cost ten times as much.  I&#x27;m a fan.  Just wish more came in the package.  I recommend buying two at a time.</li>
    <li> It is what it is.  Until I was 50 I used soap on my face.  Everyone told me I cannot do that.  Since I only look 49 I was not worried but everyone cannot be wrong.  Now I buy things like this and have no idea if they are superior to soap or not.  Now I look 50 but since I&#x27;m 51 I don&#x27;t know whether or not I can give credit to this product.  It will NOT change your life or make you look 49 again.  It also won&#x27;t make you look older so it may be worth a try.</li>
    <li> Love this. Creamy, and takes off ALL the makeup without scrubbing.</li>
    <li> L&#x27;OREAL still is the Lo Mejor siempre!(the best...always) no comparison.&lt;br /&gt;I have,as few women i am close to bought ROC,and albeit it is a great product,&lt;br /&gt;NOTHING is better imo moisturizer, et.al, than L&#x27;OREAL. I have many of their products,&lt;br /&gt;incredible...Smell&amp;#34;so fresh/so good/clean feeling add&#x27;l bonus,NON-GREASY,incredible.&lt;br /&gt;It works wonders,for my BFF and myself,and couple others we know,hence we are sticking with&lt;br /&gt;ALL L&#x27;OREAL... adios. FIVE STARS again easy...</li>
    <li> You need just a little. It goes a long way. Skin seems more supple.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful. I keep it in my shower to wash my face with my little sponge to exfoliate while I shower. After using it, I feel my pores breathing and no build up on my skin/face. The product is creamy and does make a little foam, but it&#x27;s all good. Remember to use moisturizer after you use a cleanser on your face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll give this 4/5 stars because I honestly dont think it&#x27;s helping with any anti-aging.  However, it&#x27;s a great cleanser.  It&#x27;s gentle and smooth.  It removes even my more water-resistant makeup.  I&#x27;ve been very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> I bought this product about six months ago and was extremely delighted.  In the evening before I go to bed I wash my face with this amazing cleanser.  It is the most velvety, creamy sensation for your face.     I immediately bought one for my friend and after she tried it she said \\&quot;when I applied it on my face I felt I should light candles, turn on music and shut off the lights.    Dreamy and cleany and sensational.    M. A. Rourke</li>
    <li> I like the cream cleanser, especially when I use it with my Clarisonic, but I&#x27;ve had nothing but problems with the lid coming off and the cleanser leaking out.  There&#x27;s no getting the top back on either. Pretty annoying to me since I travel frequently and lose the cleanser in my bathroom organizer.  This definitely needs to be reworked since it&#x27;s such a great product.</li>
    <li> It is the best one I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;Love the rich lather and it cleans my face so complete. You won&#x27;t feel dry or irritating. Just good! I will switch my cleanser to it from now on</li>
    <li> Leaves my skin feeling clean and fresh but the formula is way too runny. Its constantly leaking through the cap. I have to store upside down.</li>
    <li> I use this 1-2 times per day.  I have tried different products for firming.  This wash is great,  My skin feels tightened  and clean.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you !</li>
    <li> It is fabulous.  I am seventy years old and people think I am in my fifties.  Can&#x27;t beat that.  I recommend heartily.</li>
    <li> Cleans without stripping and just works!</li>
    <li> First time to use this product and it was even better than I was expecting!!! Cleanses and removes all traces of makeup even tough mascara.</li>
    <li> Works great! Great price. The add on item thing is tough though. I sometimes only want add on items and then have to look else where to purchase.</li>
    <li> Cosmetics do  not have to be expensive to give desired results. I invested much time and money in expensive products that did not work well for my oily and acne prone skin. I am very delighted I decided to try Loreal because the results are impressive. This face wash has become my best friend.  For the first time more 10 years, I do not break-out and my acne spots are fading.</li>
    <li> Good value, my face feels clean.. Only four stars because it makes my face a bit dry.</li>
    <li> The L&#x27;Oreal Revitalift Radiant Smoothing Cream Cleanser is great! It cleans very well, removing make up and leaving your skin feeling clean and refreshed. My face felt softer after using it.</li>
    <li> feels soft and nice on my face, does not make a lot of foam, that&#x27;s why im giving a 4 stars.</li>
    <li> It makes my skin so soft and I love its smell also..made me clean and refreshed..I would recommend it to any one</li>
    <li> Very good product meets all the expectations I had therefore recommend</li>
    <li> For the price it&#x27;s the best cleanser I&#x27;ve tried. Skin is always soft and smooth, pores are smaller, and I often get that healthy glow. I have sensitive skin and break out easily but this never irritates</li>
    <li> Arrived packaged well.  Arrived so fast.  Really great product.  I wash my face and neck, etc. first thing every morning.  I will not buy any other products.  This is the one I swear by.  Thank you.  Better price than in store.</li>
    <li> Has a nice, gentle smell and leaves my face feeling clean without drying.  Feels quite luxurious to use, and find it&#x27;s as good as some of the more expensive products out there.  You don&#x27;t need a lot, so it seems to be lasting well.  I keep one on the sink and one in the shower.</li>
    <li> I love this. It made my skin feel fresh and smooth and it seems brighter too! Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years.  Quite a bit more expensive at the grocery or drug store.  I can usually get a very good price at Bed Bath &amp; Beyond even without their 20% off coupons.  When I found it at such a steal at Amazon I bought it right away.  I like this so much better than similar Olay face washes which have a tendency to leave a feeling of something left on your skin.  You only need a very small dab of the L&#x27;Oreal wash, lathers up very nicely, thoroughly cleans and does not leave a feeling of a film left on your face. My face feels very soft, does not dry my skin.  Safe around your eyes so I use it to remove eye makeup as I wash my face.  When I see an opportunity to buy at a very good price I buy as many as I can.</li>
    <li> When i get done washing my face with this product I can&#x27;t get over how great it leaves my skin feeling. It does a great job nourishing my skin and leaving it smoother and more refined. You would think you payed a lot more than you did for this the way it makes your skin feel. I would recommend to anyone looking for a great face wash!</li>
    <li> Very effective and smooth on the skin. Will be a regular customer. Hope they maintain the quality in future also</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t recommend you buy this from amazon, the item came without a seal. Also the fragrance is very strong, it doesn&#x27;t feel safe for the skin.</li>
    <li> It isn&#x27;t often that I place a repeat order for a skin care product. I have sensitive, combination skin and most products that claim to be moisturizing leave my skin feeling dry and tight or very red. This product is a cream style cleanser. It dispenses as a white cream and lathers beautifully. It does a good job of removing my makeup, including eye makeup and mascara. My skin is clean, non-irritated, and I don&#x27;t feel the need to rush to apply a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, excellent service!</li>
    <li> Would give more stars if I could. I am 69. From spending summer in desert and not using sun screen enough, by Nov my nose was peeling and breaking out in horrible painful whiteheads, also some on rest of face. My skin was so thin that poking a pinhole and gently squeezing left holes and ugly scabs. First time I used this there was immediate lessening of peeling and heeling of scabs. Also used it on feet and legs, it made them soft as a baby. One time I used too much and it left residue that seemed to cause more breaking out.  Manufacturer&#x27; s SKU is 0 71249 13565 5.</li>
    <li> She really likes it. Said its better than ROC pore cleanser. So would give it a recommendation based on that.</li>
    <li> I use this and have found it has given me great results with the other L&#x27;Oreal products that I use for my skin care.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Lathers very well - maybe too much but better than not lather at all.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t make my skin dry&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;Pretty strong scent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know whether it&#x27;s effective as a make up removal since I don&#x27;t use this when I wear makeup. It lathers so much so you need only a tiny drop every time. My skin feels neutral (not moist or dry) after use. Like I said, the scent is strong. I&#x27;m not sensitive for fragrance, but I don&#x27;t get used to the smell.</li>
    <li> Yet another fine product by L&#x27;Oreal; this company really works well for me. I would recommend this cleanser to anyone.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use with the Olay Pro X Facial Cleansing System that I bought on Amazon.  I have naturally dry skin, and was looking for a cleanser that wouldn&#x27;t dry or irritate my skin.  I like this product because it has a pleasant smell, effectively cleans my make-up off and moisturizes my skin at the same time.  It has light exfoliating properties, so it helps keep your skin dewey.  I use it with and without the cleansing system, and have positive results each time.</li>
    <li> Great cleanser! use it night with the RevitaLift and Anti-wrinkle + firming cream!</li>
    <li> I really like this face wash, and it complements the night cream that I use every night. Its helping to make my face look smoother.</li>
    <li> Leaves skin soft and smooth as well. I like that it was a two in one sorta thing. I like that it didn&#x27;t leave my skin dry or irritated. I like that it has a light scent and its too harsh on my sensitive skin either.</li>
    <li> I Usually use Oil of Olay- figured I would try loreal since I use so many of the hair care items- was not disappointed- very creamy lotion like cleanser- very gentle- I have very sensitive skin- this product is very good.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years now and people keep telling me that I look younger over the years. Then, it must be working</li>
    <li> My favorite facial cleanser!</li>
    <li> Bags under my eyes went away within a week, my pores look so much better and it doesn&#x27;t leave any film or grossness behind. What more could you want?</li>
    <li> Ok product.  A bit too creamy for my liking in a face wash.  The face wash also leaks out the top after it&#x27;s closed and used.  It&#x27;s a bit messy.</li>
    <li> I was hoping this would be a little gentler, less drying to my skin. I do have skin that is dry to begin with though.  It is better than anything else I have tried other than St. Ives skin cleansing lotion which I can no longer find. I use L&#x27;Oreal facial products; that&#x27;s why I decided to ordered this.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite facial cleanser. It is creamy, non-foaming, and my skin actually feels moisturized after using it, not stripped or tight the way it can be with other cleansers. This cleanser is also super affordable and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I really like the product, the way it cleanses and feels on my face when I use it -- creamy while sudsy. I don&#x27;t like the packaging as much, though. If I store it on its cap, it leaks all over the place. When I travel, I have to put it in a plastic bag so it won&#x27;t leak all over my overnight bag.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin soft &amp; supple, and clear.  this is NOT a harsh drying product. just a small dollup will do to cover your face...any more than that and you&#x27;ll waste it. i am totally pleased at the results i have with using this product. last week my mother thought i had make up on. i had to tell her i only had on eyeliner! i have great looking skin because of this product.</li>
    <li> Great cleaning for skin - it is one of their best products.</li>
    <li> I feel like it is making my pores look larger so after a few weeks, im returning to my former cleanser. I think my mom who has drier skin will like it. My skin is neither oily or dry..but my pores are fairly visible.</li>
    <li> Great face cleanser.  Not drying. I use it every day and love it.</li>
    <li> Great for taking off all of your makeup including eye makeup without irritation.  I keep trying other cleansers but always return back to this one.</li>
    <li> I chose this product for it&#x27;s anti aging. Worked okay but didn&#x27;t really see any changes or any skin lifting.</li>
    <li> this is great, really feel the difference when I wash my face.  It also doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin, feels firm after wash.</li>
    <li> It does a good job and I have had no problems.  I have bought several and have been using it for about a year</li>
    <li> I like this product. Cleans well and my skin doesn&#x27;t feel oily. Skin feels firm</li>
    <li> This cleansing cream works very well for me and I have been using it for quite a while now.  I do buy it on Amazon because I cannot ever find it available in stores in our area........it is carried in stores but they seem to run of it out quickly.</li>
    <li> This a smooth cleanser with a &amp;#34;little&amp;#34; exfoliating gels in there. I really wanted more of the grains in there, but it is smooth on your skins and takes off all the dirt/make-up.</li>
    <li> It was open and during delivery damages other items in the package.  Do not know how cream work because I will not use it due to broken seal.</li>
    <li> The liquid leaks out of the tube after one use and once you use about 2/3 of the tube it becomes difficult to squeeze the creme out of the tube. Not sure if it just a ploy to run out and buy another bottle. The product does have a nice sudzy feel to it but it does not clean very well. After you wash your face you are left with make up stains on your towel.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a couple years and of all the facial washes I&#x27;ve used, it appears to aid with minor wrinkles the best and tighten the skin a bit.</li>
    <li> L&#x27;Oreal doesn&#x27;t disappoint. Cleanses face throughly without drying out skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using it and finishing the tube, but I&#x27;m not sure buy it again.  Too oily and messy.  I miss the old pink L&#x27;Oreal cleanser I used for years.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s alright but I still got blackheads.I&#x27;ve changed my routine a little to use only filtered water with the cleanser.Maybe that will help.will repost later.</li>
    <li> This tube lasted FOREVER! However, it didnt have an exfoliation powers, which is not bad- but I prefer it. It didnt dry out my skin, either. However, it was super concentrated, in my opinion. If you used too much, it got super soapy feeling and was tough to rinse off.</li>
    <li> A good creamy texture. It won&#x27;t leave your skin cracking dry after washing your face. I tried it once at my in-laws and loved it. Works well with dry skin.</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser. I break out easily and this just works perfectly, it foams and cleanses really nicely. Living a clean skin. I&#x27;ve been using it for two years now. The first month using it, I had people telling me I have a beautiful skin for the first time in my life! I see the difference. And so do other people. Will definitely keep using it!</li>
    <li> Enjoy the creamy cleansing very much</li>
    <li> Lovely foam and gentle on my skin. You only need a dime-sized dollop so it lasts a while.</li>
    <li> I used this product for about a couple of days. I stopped using it because it has a scent to it. I usually break out when the products have any kind of scent. It wasnt a strong perfume scent, it was a nice clean scent, but I decided that it was not the right product for me.</li>
    <li> love this product and can be used every day.. makes my skin look healthier and nicer.....leaves the skin feeling good....thanks</li>
    <li> I have tried more Facial cleansers than I care to admit, from Olay, Garnier, ROC, as well as other brands.  I found this radiant smoothing cream cleanser to be exactly as described by the company.  It is very creamy which does not require a lot to be applied to your face.  It does not have a scent, odor or any fragrance included.  Once applied it feels very creamy, as you can feel the effects of the facial cleanser cleaning your pores and skin.  It definitely has a gentle exfoliating action, and it is helpful that Vitamin C is added to the cleanser.  I love the results after using this cream cleanser, your face feels clean, your pores feel unclogged, and you can see the difference in your face.  I would definitely purchase more of this product, as I am extremely pleased with the results.  In comparisons to other cleansers, I saw results in days rather than in weeks, with the difference this cleanser compliments your face including moisturizing your skin.  The delivery service on this product was great, the product arrived faster than I expected, the packaging was neat to avoid spillage, and the price of this cleanser is very reasonable.  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who has tried many cleansers and have not seen results as fast as they would like to in their facial regimen care.  This L’Oreal cream cleanser helps with the appearance and improvement of your skin, as well as keeping you face moisturized without a greasy feeling or oily appearance.  As a woman with sensitive skin, this product did not burn, itch, or dry out my skin, as well as not leaving any small red blotches on my face after cleansing. I am impressed, pleased and very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Too much for my oily acne prone skin even though I am in my 30&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> This review is written by Katie: This is used by all the girls in the house.  We like being able to have it delivered and not worry about running out.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful and I have already recommended this product to family and friends. It will be replacing my clean and clear products that I used to use.  Thanks LOreal!</li>
    <li> Overpriced, used with other Revitalift products as recommended, but not much better than many less expensive cleansers. Does leave skin soft and not tight. Actual contents much less than packaging represents.</li>
    <li> This product works great for me. I have very oily skin and I use this product everyday to make sure my face isnt looking like someone slapped me in the face with a fry chicken. It&#x27;s very creamy and I use it like a scrub . It doesn&#x27;t dry my face out too bad but it does make my face feel a little tight but I use L&#x27;oreal SPF 15 face cream that is no longer sold to balance it out and it has done wonders for my skin. My face has cleared up dramatically in about a month. This is truly an amazing product.</li>
    <li> The smell is pleasant and it cleanses as expected! I&#x27;m just not used to cream cleansers in general.</li>
    <li> Love this product, use consistently and the price was great.</li>
    <li> Late 20&#x27;s, super dry skin, breakout prone, AA woman..I&#x27;m in awe with this cleanser. I simply cannot wait to wake up in the morning just to use it. Lovely scent. Its so smooth, thick and creamy. It lathers up quite nicely. Just a dab with little water and it is magic. I bought it for a dollar ($1) Yes. The day moisturizer was also on sale ($1) but I opt not to get it because of the spf. Overall, I am loving this product and will repurchase.</li>
    <li> Gentle yet thorough leaves skin soft and moisturized. Only need a very small amount to do the trick. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Oh my gosh, what a bargain! I used to use a similar product that was three times the cost - and I think this actually works better. In fact, I thought the product I was previously using worked great, but when I used a sample of the Loreal that I got in the mail, I realized what I had been using wasn&#x27;t doing the job. I&#x27;ve been using it for three months now, and I think my face is smoother than it was ten years ago!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you follow the instructions and use it both in the morning and before you go to bed. It really does make a difference. And then enjoy the road to a smoother, cleaner face!</li>
    <li> OMG!  This product is fantastic.  Seriously!  I have been using it for about a week and already see AND feel a difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> Very gentle on skin. Works wonders on my combination skin type and also on my mom&#x27;s sensitive skin and my dad&#x27;s normal skin, you can say works on pretty much all skin types! Great moisturizing texture without being greasy!</li>
    <li> This is a favorite face cleanser.  Leaves skin brand new soft.</li>
    <li> muy bueno todo ,envio rapido  buen precio buena cualidad recibido mas o menos en el tiempo previsto&lt;br /&gt;los recomendo good purchase ....ok</li>
    <li> It goes on smoothly and easy to remove. This is the only cleancer that i use for my face, leaves my face freash and clean. Love it would gladly recomend it</li>
    <li> Great product. Makes your face so smooth.  I have used others for many, many years and was told by a friend this was good.  She is so right.  Great product.</li>
    <li> This product is well worth the price. It does exactly what its suppose to and I plan to continue using it from now on. Great product.</li>
    <li> This is my go to face wash. It&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
    <li> Always leaves my face smooth and feeling clean. I use it daily for a couple years now. Cleans as well as more expensive products</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser..only squirt a small amount on the palm of my hand and apply it on my face...it cleans my face so well...looovee this product !!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful moisturizing cleanser. Does not strip the skin but removes makeup&lt;br /&gt;thoroughly.  Leaves no film and skin feels clean and soft.</li>
    <li> This cleanser has a very nice scent. It has good foaming action. My skin feels clean but not overly dry. I would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I was pleased with this product as I usually am with L&#x27;Oreal.</li>
    <li> I like to use, let me soft skin</li>
    <li> I do love this product.  I use it faithfully prior to the other product from L&#x27;Oreal that follow.  It&#x27;s sudsy and feels nice on the skin.</li>
    <li> All you need is a little dab to wash your face. Its creamy and it will last a long time. Cleans my face very well. My face seems tighter too.</li>
    <li> I have tried the product for a while now, and I would say it does a good job in making your face feel smoother. Thumbs up.</li>
    <li> After trying several products, I decided to try loreal and I really like it. I would reccomend this product to my friends.</li>
    <li> I love how little it takes to remove my makeup and clean my skin.  It doesn&#x27;t dry my face out like some products or leave a greasy residue.  I hate scrubbing my skin to remove a good quality makeup, and this is much easier on my face.</li>
    <li> good price good product good presentation i recommend the product you can buy it several times excellent bran and you can be confident</li>
    <li> The best creamy cleanser I have found at such a reasonable price. As others have said the packaging needs improvement. I have found it to leak.  Not enough of a problem to cause me to stop using though.</li>
    <li> I use this twice a week and it makes my face feel nice and clean.  Does not feel dried out after I use it.  I think it is a great product.</li>
    <li> This cream cleanser is great, just a bit is enough to clean up your face. The product arrived in the right time and conditions. I am so satisfied.</li>
    <li> When it arrived, the tube had leaked and the package was all messy.  The little left into the tube went on leaking and I could not really used it.  Don&#x27;t know if the product is good or not, but the conditioning is deplorable!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin at times and this product has been great - no irritation.  I read about these products in a magazine and thought I would try them so far so good with all the L&#x27;Oreal products I have tried.  I really like this product.  It goes on smooth and feels so good on my face. My face looks better after only a week using this product.  I will be buying this again very soon.  I can&#x27;t believe how smooth the product is but how&lt;br /&gt;well it does perform as a cleanser.</li>
    <li> Nice cost performance！</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay.  I ordered this by accident.  I prefer facial clensers with exfoliating beads in them.  My mistake.  It&#x27;s smooth and I guess it cleanses.  It just doesn&#x27;t invigorate.  If you like smooth and gentle, this may be the one for you.</li>
    <li> Wases well without drying your skin, and smells so good.  Nice creamy texture...</li>
    <li> I have been using this cleanser for over a year and love it. No break outs. I still have the original bottle I bought a year ago. You just need a pea sized amount. It is not drying. I used to use the expensive department store brands. This is so much better!</li>
    <li> This is a cream cleanser just like it says. Doesn&#x27;t lather up but it works ok for the price. I would use it for a good price.</li>
    <li> Omg, I just bought this item today which was on sale for $4.99 at Albertsons store while doing my grocery and the moment i tried it for the first time I was so suprised and very happy with the result. It felt so smooth and it clears my face right away:] The smell is so good too. I&#x27;m now at my 30&#x27;s and have very dry skin and I wasn&#x27;t so sure if it would give me an itch reaction but so far it works good on me. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t give this product a higher rating because it should be easier to wash off.  It&#x27;s a little too creamy.</li>
    <li> I purchased this cleanser in the hopes that it might help moisturize my face, rather than dry it out like other cleansers have.  There are a few good things about it, such as the light pleasant smell and the creamy texture.  It also is better than the other top brands as far as not leaving my face super dry and tight feeling.  However, it doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling moisturized either.  For the price, it&#x27;s not a total loss, but I am still searching for something a tad more moisturizing.</li>
    <li> This does make my face smooth and soft.  My main issue with it is that it spilled all over my package - the seller didn&#x27;t even seal the bottle.  I probably got a used one.  It also spilled all over my cabinet when I put it to stand in it&#x27;s right position.  Because it is so runny and watery, I have to put it to stand upside down so that it doesn&#x27;t drip. I use it almost every day but I am starting to break out now so I will be cutting down to twice a week. But it really does make my face look nice and feel nice.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past two weeks and I am already seeing results.  Positive I might add.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> The first time I tried this cream I was impressed.  The lather is luxurious and silky.  Age 49 and have sensitive skin and while the cleanser is definitely scented I have had no problems with sensitivity.  You only have to use a small quantity so it goes a very long way.  Dab about a pea size and lather for face.  I liked it so much I purchased it for my mother (age 72) and she&#x27;s a fan.</li>
    <li> I enjoyed this product</li>
    <li> This really has made my face look so much more healthy and glowing. Love it, will not use anything else now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 28 and having to switch my skincare routine. My skin has been so clear since I started using this. I am always getting compliments when I&#x27;m not wearing makeup. A little goes a long way. This is  great wash and an amazing price. It&#x27;s so hard to find in stores where I live.</li>
    <li> Love this product, and it&#x27;s not easy to find.  Target used to stock it, but no more, so I have to pick it up at the grocery store.  It is a really great creamy cleanser and used with my Clarisonic cleansing brush it leaves my skin feeling clean, fresh, and very soft.  As an add-on product the price is fantastic!  Even the regular (non add-on) is priced better than in store.  Would recommend especially for mature skin, but any age would love it.</li>
    <li> Not a cream cleanser at all, it&#x27;s a foaming cleanser.</li>
    <li> I love this product for cleaning my face. It does not leave my skin feeling dry and it does a good job of removing all traces of makeup. I have tried other products but I always come back to Loreal Revitalift cream cleanser.</li>
    <li> This is a great cleanser. I use it a couple times a week. It makes my face feel very dry after so I just make sure to put on a good face cream. Blemishes gone!!</li>
    <li> I tried this cream for the first time after a long workday and found it to be amazingly refreshing on my face. The creamy texture is reminiscent of sunblock lotion, and lathers up nicely and easily as you spread it around. It rinses off very well and does not leave any sort of residue or unnatural scent, and it left my face feeling moistened and not dried out like some face cleansers I have used in the past. The vitamin C leaves my skin feeling rejuvenated and soft. I definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I have been using the Loreal Revitalift products and they work as well or better than more expensive department store brands.</li>
    <li> I am very much into smells and the smell of this face wash is ok. I will probably look for another one next time but it does do the trick and get my face clean.</li>
    <li> I have used Mary Kay for years, but needed something in a pinch.  I thought I would give this a try to make it through until I could get more MK, but ended up liking this quite a bit.  I am planning on sticking with it until I feel like it just isn&#x27;t working for me anymore.  At this price, what is there to lose!</li>
    <li> Works well, and can be used for shaving. Very smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> Very good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GPH</li>
    <li> Great wash but use a moisturizing night cream for the evenings</li>
    <li> Feels like washing your face with soft silk</li>
    <li> I read so many reviews talking about how wonderful this line is. I purchased this cleanser and several other Revitalift products so I could do the complete treatment. I tried this cleanser and my skin felt tight. I used it carefully, didn&#x27;t over scrub, and rinsed if off well. The perfume was overpowering. After I carefully dried my face, I proceed to use the Triple Power Concentrated Serum Treatment per the overall instructions for a complete treatment. Within minutes my face was red, swollen and burning. I washed everything off with plain water, but my face continued to burn and be red and swollen. The perfume smell couldn&#x27;t be removed from my face or hands. This morning my face is covered in white pustules and my skin is scaly, dry and is flaking and peeling off in sizable flakes. I have no desire to try anything else in this line. I look horrible and I have no idea how I&#x27;m going to be able to leave the house for work tomorrow. I&#x27;m terrified of using anything on my face now. I now need to find a dermatologist who can get me in as soon as possible. I&#x27;ve never had a reaction like this in my life.</li>
    <li> The best investment for my skin ever,which it really appreciates it !  great fragrance ,not to rich not to subtle ,it really nourishes my skin with the dual capability of exfoliating the dead skin cells and moisturizing simultaneously without the dry skin feeling off your face,removes as well small blemishes in a short overnight basis ,like sun damage and some aging spots I had on my nose,,! the presentation is quite elegant .L&#x27;Oreal always keep it classy !</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT ITS SO SMOOTH GOING ON</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure that L&#x27;oreal didn&#x27;t intend for this to make my face dry, red, and irritated, but it did. I am not someone who normally has a lot of issues with sensitive skin, either -- I use a lot of soaps and lotions indiscriminitally -- but whatever&#x27;s in here just did a number on me. No thanks, L&#x27;oreal!</li>
    <li> Love this face cleaner, one of the best products at an affordable price.</li>
    <li> Just a lil bit will make a silky foaming wash.  It leaves your face clean and smooth.  It is non drying and does not leave your skin tight feeling.</li>
    <li> Very nice ande I will be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried this cleanser and have been using it for a few weeks now. The cleanser is very creamy and a little goes a long way. It takes off makeup well too!</li>
    <li> Fabulous cleanser if you&#x27;re using a Clarisonic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Foams up beautifully without drying!  Great price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Not crazy about the scent, but my love for foam can overlook it.</li>
    <li> I was amazed with this product of how well it remove my makeup. since most of them are waterproof. Will definitely buy again.</li>
