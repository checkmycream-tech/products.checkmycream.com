<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Fast delivery product is amazing!!!</li>
    <li> Why would I not like this wonderful skin care thing-- I an]m 80 years old with a skin that looks like  50 years</li>
    <li> I bought the whole Pro X system about a month ago.  This is a refill.  I love just love this system as it leaves my skin so smooth and glowing.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with this. Makes my face feel so clean and smooth. Not sure it has helped wrinkles but I am 63 and have alot of health problems but I am glad I bought it</li>
    <li> This item was purchased because I needed a way to wash my face after having surgery on my dominant arm and knew that I was going to have a problem doing every day tasks.  This was the answer I was looking for.  My skin, usually a problem if not cleansed properly, has remained clear and the Pro X was easy to use.  Clean clear skin is the way to feel better when you feel a little under the weather.  I have continued using it since gaining use of my hand.  Hint:  wet your face with a little water, turn the Pro-X on low and run it across a bar of baby soap and use this in between using the abrasion and polishing products.  The discs are easy to load, use, and rinse.  Love this.</li>
    <li> Box was damaged upon arrival but not the product. Works great.</li>
    <li> This microabrasion is stronger than I expected.  But that&#x27;s fine.  I use it twice a week as directed. I aqm already receiving compliments about my skin. Thank you Olay</li>
    <li> Love using this with the device, not too hard on the skin and helps keep my face looking fresh/clear</li>
    <li> So far so good.  I am using 2 times a  week as suggested and my skin looks great!  Worth trying.</li>
    <li> I like this product. When I notice my face is dry and a little flaky this helps clear it up right away. A little expensive though for the size of bottle</li>
    <li> many years of using oil of olay and they have wonderful products and they work. my skin is beautiful, now my daughter uses their items because she see what it does for me at my ripe age of 59 and not showing it, thanks oil of olay.</li>
    <li> Excellent microdermabrasion product. I use it with the tool from my old Susan Lucci Youthful Essence system. My skin feels smooth and soft after my weekly use. It&#x27;s not  too harsh on my face and neck even though I&#x27;m 60+.</li>
    <li> So I did love this product at first. It&#x27;s nice and warm for a few seconds when you first apply and start using the face scrubber, the warmth goes away relatively  quickly, though. I do feel it made my skin smoother and brighter, however, I ended up getting a very dry rash on my face from it. I was only using it once to twice per week, so I backed off completely and my skin has finally healed after a couple of weeks of not using. I don&#x27;t know if maybe it was even a reaction to something in it or if it was just too much during such cold weather. I may retry it in the spring or summer.</li>
    <li> I started to use this this year help make my skin softer and less dull</li>
    <li> I know what the instructions say but...I use it daily in the shower.  My blemishes are almost completely gone and my face is amazing.  My makeup stays put all day now without the oiliness that I used to struggle against all day long.  My moisturizer glides on so smooth and I love it.  I can tell which days I forget to use it because my skin doesn&#x27;t have the clean lines.  At almost 40, I still struggle with acne and this is the first time in a very long time that I have not had to really worry.  If anything starts breaking through, the thermal crystals just buff the little bugger right off.  I love this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this originally with the little Olay spinner machine.  Total impulse buy, but I&#x27;ve been trying to save money and the $120 I was shelling out for microderm twice a year (I&#x27;ve had six of them at various salons) was feeling like more than I wanted to spend.  For about $30, I thought I&#x27;d try this.  The first time I used it with the little spinner machine, I was very careful to go over all my face twice, just like the girls do when they do the salon microdermabrasions.  What was BETTER about this than the salon microderm, was that it was ME doing it.  I know how my face feels, I know how long to stay on one area of skin and when to move on so it doesn&#x27;t get irritated.  It took about 10 minutes to do a thorough job of it - sounds like a long time, but it saved me about an hour and a half if you count the time it took me to drive to the salon, wait in their waiting room, have the girl do the actual procedure, and then drive home.  The shortest microderm I ever had was 20 minutes plus drive time, the longest was well over an hour, so 10 minutes is nothing.  Then, just like they do at the salon, I put a layer of vitamin C serum (skinceuticals) on my face, (I know, I should have done a mask first, but I had neither the time, nor the patience),  then a high quality moisturizer (skin medica.)  My face felt great and I had that same glow I love getting with microderm at the salon.  The real kicker was that the next morning, it STILL looked great.  I am sold.  The next time I tried using the thermal crystal polisher with just my fingers to save time.  I did not get the same results, so I am back to taking the time with the little machine.  GREAT buy.</li>
    <li> Great stuff ! Will buy again !</li>
    <li> I love the way this product feels. It works wonderfully and for the price, it cannot be beat.</li>
    <li> I used as recommended and have seen results.  I saw results within a few days especially on sun spots on my hands.  some places spots will only fade and I am told that those will need to be removed with laser.  But overall a great product for the price. Used this product with the handheld cleansing brush sold by Oil of Olay.</li>
    <li> The microdermabrasion is unlike any other product. It&#x27;s a completely different tool than the bristle cleanser. Both are excellent but the microdermabrasion pad and exfoliator are incredible. You notice a difference after using it once and a HUGE difference in your skin after a month. My pores are smaller, my makeup looks better because my skin is so smooth, and my eczema is better than ever!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product from Olay.  They have been in my family for years, my mom used their stuff I did, left and went to high end brands like Philosophy and Clinique - Olay has me back.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Works well but it doesn&#x27;t seem like the brush locks in very far. I keep pushing it, thinking it will go in farther.</li>
    <li> This product is great.it has little granuals that clean out your pores and your face turns a-glow. I have heard so many people ask me \\&quot;What have you done to your face?\\&quot;,,.it looks remarkable.</li>
    <li> Helped with my large pores.  Used some on my hands and wow what a difference in texture of skin&lt;br /&gt;I use once every ten days.</li>
    <li> Eh it works but kinda pricy for a dinky ass tube like this</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been difficult to use it</li>
    <li> i can&#x27;t see any change in my skin other than it makes it quite raw, and sensitive. I understand those are probably the intentions and should probably eventually benefit, but i just haven&#x27;t seen any of those benefits.</li>
    <li> I love this product, it feels gentle but it really works. I&#x27;ve been using it only once a week since May. And yes, I can see the difference. My skin looks smoother and my fine lines decreased. Talking about my open pores, of course they are not gone, but there is a visible improvement because they are cleaner and look smaller. I&#x27;ll start to use it twice a week as recommended just to compare against my current routine. If there is improvement, I&#x27;ll update my review.</li>
    <li> Obviously not equal to clinical microdermabrasion but feels great afterward and works well to improve the look of skin texture.</li>
    <li> Love the product, only complaint is its a small bottle of the facewash.  But definitely worth it.  Great addition to the olay-pro-x set.</li>
    <li> Makes face feel smooth afterwards. Wish. Hadn&#x27;t procrastinated getting this for so long.</li>
    <li> Great product. Made a difference in my skin&#x27;s appearance after only a week. My skin is smoother, more even toned and my pores are smaller.</li>
    <li> Makes my face feel so clean and refreshed. Unfortunately I don&#x27;t look any younger, but it didn&#x27;t promise to, I was just hoping.</li>
    <li> I brought this as part of a birthday gift, along with the brush for a friend. She didn&#x27;t use this product as she was afriad it would break out her sensitive skin. So I used it and I have to say after two days my skin felt so much softer. But that was the only change I have noticed thus far.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this product and is happy with the results</li>
    <li> After using this product just once my skin feels incredibly soft. I use this twice a week in conjunction with Olay&#x27;s bristle cleaning system and my skin is drastically improving. I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s and still suffer from minor acne and this has helped clear up the blemishes and the dark spots/ unevenness of skin tone heals much faster. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Packed great &amp; it works Great</li>
    <li> This item was a major disappointment. The scrubbing head barely moves. I bought this to replace a clairsonic that I had for 4 yrs and this one was a huge disappointment. I would not recommend wasting money on this item.</li>
    <li> i just recieve this item,it says that its include 1 microdermabrasion foam head and 1 thermal crystal polisher but when i opend it only 1 thermal crystal polisher inside theres no foam head...i trust this site but what happend now i dont know if i will order again!!!</li>
    <li> Wonderful job at exfoliating.</li>
    <li> Love the sponges, they work even better than the brushes, which to me seems just backward, but they are effective.  Wish they would sell them without the exfoliating cleanser, like they do the brushes.  It&#x27;s also very difficult to find them in any store.</li>
    <li> The &amp;#34;Thermal Crystal Polisher&amp;#34; is awesome.  I will definitely be buying more of that. The foam head didn&#x27;t do much for me.  I decided that I got better results using finger tips.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Skin feels so smooth.</li>
    <li> If you are using the Pro-X Exfoliation system, this is a must.  My skin is near perfect after using this product twice per week, as recommended.  For some with more sensitive skin, once/week is also very good.  You can see results immediately after the first application.  You couldn&#x27;t ask for more!</li>
    <li> I use this every week and I really like it.  My skin is definitely more radiant since I started using.  There are days I only where a tinted moisturizer and that&#x27;s it.  The lines on my forehead have lessened too.</li>
    <li> This is a refill for my Pro-X cleansing system.  I am pleased with the system as a whole and this product.</li>
    <li> Works Ok for the price.</li>
    <li> This product reminds me of the other kit Olay has. Where you put the scrub on then the serum. So it is nice that it is one step. I have only used it 3 times. My skin feels nice and smooth and no redness or stinging. I have not used it long enough to notice a significant difference. Like the kit, after 2 months I did see a difference, but it seems like it is something that you constantly need to use to keep up the results.</li>
    <li> I love this and used it today for the first time! I use it with my 20 dollar buffer and my skin is incredible! Know I am 54 (pass for a few years younger!) and credit taking care of my skin (and no smoking) with maintaining a good look. I credit my mom here...&amp;#34;after 50 it is a matter of maintenance!&amp;#34;. Here&#x27;s to maintaining and special thx to Amazon!</li>
    <li> Works great!  Skin much smoother!</li>
    <li> This brush doesn&#x27;t seem to do much.  It may be a half step above washing my face with my hands. I have yet to see results on my skin, but it makes me feel better to use it.  I&#x27;m curious if the Clarasonic is that much better for 3x the price.</li>
    <li> This is the most perfect little tool. I love the way it leaves my skin.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Instant result. I use it as instructed. Saves me money for facial maintenance. Thanks Olay and Amazon</li>
    <li> delivery was on time and item was as described</li>
    <li> Works very well. Love the heat activation.  Only use it three times a week myself so it does not over dry.  Very good price.</li>
    <li> Definitely cleans your face !.....pores are almost invisible...!</li>
    <li> It does it&#x27;s job well. If I purchase it again, I would only purchase the cleanser. The brush head and the cleanser doesn&#x27;t work well together. I think it works better using my fingers.</li>
    <li> I am 66 Years old and have been mistaken for 56 since I have been using this Olay system.</li>
    <li> Fairly useless. Save your money and buy a clarisonic.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great. It really does smooth out my face the first day I used it.</li>
    <li> Works wonderful! My face is so smooth. The only thing that has ever kept my face from getting all peely.</li>
    <li> My skin feels great after using this. Feels like it really scrubs all the make up out. Helping to fade some acne marks that I&#x27;ve had after a change in my birth control that made my skin go crazy! I actually prefer to use it with just my hands instead of the machine. Feel like I have more control and can tell how much it&#x27;s gone in on certain areas.</li>
    <li> This product really helps with keeping your face smooth and clear without drying out the skin.  I am in my 60&#x27;s and have very dry skin.  This has been the cheapest place I found this product and have used Amazon for so long, that I trust their company too.  If you buy it, I hope your are as please with it as I am,</li>
    <li> I also wrote a review for the original kit - bought the red pro kit at the store - this one so much better and this price for the refill knocks Walmart out - you notice an immediate change in your skin tone.  Hope they never pull it off the market - I am saving a fortune in botox treatments lol</li>
    <li> I am an avid consumer of the olay pro-x series and already owned the advanced cleansing system and then I stumbled upon this product which I had not tried yet. I ordered it and yes, the scrubber head attaches to the current pro-x advance cleansing system cleaner. However, even if you don&#x27;t have this particular cleaning system I keep referencing PLEASE still order this because the magic is in the product. This is hands down the best at home microdermabrasion treatment you could get but a reasonable price. I get compliments on my skin all the time on how glowing and firm my skin looks and I tell them that it was this product. I seriously can&#x27;t say enough about it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this every three days according to the instructions on the box.  (No more than twice a week and not two days in a row.)  I bought it to supplement my Olay recommended regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a little torn.  It does take a layer off your face, which is nice.  I do like the way that feels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it doesn&#x27;t appear to be doing anything other than that.  It has not reduced my blackheads or reduced the rate of blemishes (that was kickstarted by using the Olay daytime moisturizer).  I don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s actually improving the look of my skin (I won&#x27;t say &amp;#34;face&amp;#34; because, well, that&#x27;s a lot to put on a product).  I&#x27;ll give it another month and see where we&#x27;re at.</li>
    <li> Much more cost effective than another brand I was using - and the results are even better.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work with the device. I just use the cream with a cotton pad. Wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> I use this a few times a week.  The fine texture makes it more effective than many others I have tried.</li>
    <li> Gentle on face and very good as exfoliation</li>
    <li> I love the olay cleansing system so I had to buy this...wish it came in a bigger container though so I have more product, but nonetheless, I love and this is a must have for the cleaning system</li>
    <li> I purchase this and I actually already use the Olay Cleansing Brush, which also works great to help remove makeup residue at the end of the day.  Anyway, the brush heads are interchangeable.  I have dry-ish skin and use this approximately once a month.  It clears my skin up but doesn&#x27;t really irritate.  It&#x27;s probably not comparable to a real Microdermabrasion, but I have never actually had one done.</li>
    <li> Use this product once a week and love it.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product - a little pricey for such a small tube so wait till a clipped coupon is available!  I think it works better than some facials I&#x27;ve gotten.....</li>
    <li> Love Olay and ALL of their products.</li>
    <li> Works well with the Olay microbrush. Leaves your skin polished</li>
    <li> Love how soft and smooth my skin feels when i use this.  I  just have the base Pro-x cleaning system but the foam head still works with it.  The foam head does seem to harbor bacteria so make sure to clean it really well after every use.</li>
    <li> You can just put a dab of this in the palm of your hands and use it just as you would with soap.  That smooth sponge on the brush just pushes it around your face.  I think it works much better without the brush. My face is as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom after I use this Olay Pro-X Microdermabrasion Plus Advanced Cleansing System. I use it 2 or 3 times per week and I can see my &amp;#34;age&amp;#34; spots fading.  Maybe it is wishful thinking, but I think this product works.</li>
    <li> The head fits my old (original) Pro-X perfectly. The lotion does heat up as advertised and is just the right amount of abrasive for my fair and sensitive skin.  Too soon to tell if it&#x27;s going to have amazing results but so far I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
    <li> Really great. Started using it a couple of months back and saw a difference with just one use. Leaves my skin really smooth and free from acne.</li>
    <li> Just as good as DDF&#x27;s by a lot cheaper. They are both made by the same company. I just wish the kit included the brush head, and not just the sponge.</li>
    <li> Great product either using it on its own with some face cream and hand exfloating or using with Olay&#x27;s Dermasion brush.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Okay.  Haven&#x27;t seen any results yet</li>
    <li> I JUST love this microdermabrasion for my skin.  It leaves my skin really soft and clean.  It has helped with exfoliation and my skin has never felt better in a long time.  My best friend has commented on my skin, and wants to know what I am using and I told her I am using the Pro-X Microdermabrasion on my face.  She touched my face and said it is soooo soft.  I will continue to use this product.  I just love it.</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous product at a great price.  I&#x27;m a die hard fan of olay, and I was eager to test out the microdermabrasion cleanser with my olay brush.  Left my skin feeling soft and bright, leaving a perfect base for wrinkle creams and dark spot treatments.</li>
    <li> my face is so soft now</li>
    <li> Very good very fast shipping</li>
    <li> After thevery first use it left my skin softer and the pores seemed slightly smaller but I will give it more time. I am also using other products to enhance my skin but I&#x27;m happy I added this one to my regime as well. I&#x27;m not using it with the sponge as I dont have the machine, I&#x27;m just using my bare hands and I really enjoy the heat :-) also, It&#x27;s important when you use just your hands not to press on skin too much, just give it a light massage, the product will work as well.</li>
    <li> My sister loves it and says that it performs as well as the expensive salon treatments above $40 per visit..</li>
    <li> Great product and it doesn&#x27;t break me out, so I will definitely buy again.</li>
