      <li>Nicely packaged and works like a charm for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This by far was the best customer service I have ever had with a company, she already had my information, and knew who I was, without me ever telling her.</li>
      <li>I purchased the HOMEDICS Body Basics Style Spa Deluxe many years ago.</li>
      <li>This is just the best machine I have ever owned for natural nail care</li>
      <li>I have not been able to use this item for three months.</li>
      <li>When using the shaping discs, it is better to move the nail across the disc.</li>
      <li>I have MANY Homedic products.  </li>
      <li>It will work for nothing more than a minute before it tires out (after fully charged).</li>
      <li>the more I use it the better I get at doing my nails..</li>
      <li>It also say to NOT use the device for more than 20 minutes continuously.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say anything more than don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
      <li>Thicker nails will be more forgiving.  </li>
      <li>I hope that the manufacturers of this appliance will take note of their customers&#x27; comments and attempt to produce a much better product.      </li>
      <li>the pointed cone, which was my favorite for cuticles.</li>
      <li>I love Homedics products and this is another A+++++.   </li>
      <li>that the designed-in point at which the charger will allow it to be charged even if the charger is ok.</li>
      <li>I love being able to use it not plugged in, so having to recharge it after 15 mins is a trade-off</li>
      <li>okay, so i got this item for my dog, yes</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this item, it works like a charm :)</li>
      <li>, the bits are great and of course if you  apply too much pressure it will stop turning, this is a nail file and buffer, not a dremmel.</li>
      <li>, my love life has been great so far</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m okay with, but ideally it would last forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I got a great deal here on Amazon and far better price</li>
      <li>I enjoy most</li>
      <li>THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO DO WHEN YOU GET ONE OF THESE IS TO read THE MANUAL COVER TO COVER-</li>
      <li>I have since learned to dread the sound of that whinning motor even more than a dentist&#x27;s drill.</li>
      <li>My impression of this product is that it has very useful attachments (more so than the Revlon system which I purchased in the UK).      </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so easy to use my toenails</li>
      <li>Still better for cuticle smoothing than any over tool and works really well if your cuticles are Damp!!  </li>
      <li>When that happens they don&#x27;t fly away, so it&#x27;s not a big deal.  </li>
      <li>As far as the \\&quot;mechincal\\&quot; cuticle item, I thought it was doing a good job</li>
      <li>Depending on what it&#x27;s clogged with will indicate what to use to try to clean it off/out.</li>
      <li>Unless you keep it in continous motion and a at a PERFECT angle, the rapid rotation causes friction which burns your nail (and or skin) and causes intense, sharp pain.</li>
      <li>(power supply or handpiece or your nail), take a break to let it cool off.     </li>
      <li>Take the buffing head (one that has the felt) and measure or take to a hardware store with you immediately and buy some soft felt pads-like the kind you use to keep cupboards from banging shut.  </li>
      <li>Applying any kind of pressure will bring the rotating action to a stop.</li>
      <li>As a dental surgery assistant I agree that it is very similar to the kind of attachments that we use for filing and shaping teeth - especially prosthetics - in the surgery,  and must therefore be used with great care as the attachments could cause a lot of damage.    </li>
      <li>A very light touch is all that&#x27;s necessary (or adviseable) for the HoMedics bits to work properly in most cases.</li>
      <li>It started working fine after waiting forever to charge it for the first time.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s adequate.</li>
      <li>The different models share many features, so this review is pertinent as to most particulars.</li>
      <li>Love my new nail machine.</li>
      <li>It will easily stop if too much pressure is used.</li>
      <li>If you try to run the super fast spinning disc across your nails you may have alot of breaking and chipping and your nail will not be as smooth.</li>
      <li>the charge lasts week after week, and it is worth the money.</li>
      <li>than it&#x27;s worth.....</li>
      <li>Nailcare and care of the hands and feet is extremely important as all kinds of injuries can lead to greater health problems/infections (especially for persons with diabetes).    </li>
      <li>This product is well worth the price.</li>
      <li>Useful.</li>
      <li>So, when it slows down a fair amount, or when it stops more easily under a light load, turn it off, put it aside to let it cool down, then recharge it.</li>
      <li>The hardest part to get used to is getting the right angle for filing.</li>
      <li>It is true almost about many items that you use on a daily bases.</li>
      <li>You can also overheat the power supply in LESS than 20 minutes (or run the battery down faster) by using more pressure, so keep the pressure light and if anything STARTS TO FEEL MORE THAN WARM</li>
      <li>For the first time in my life I had my own long nails--change in career.</li>
      <li>I decided I could do almost as good a job if I bought this little item.....  </li>
      <li>4.5 out of 5 stars, just don&#x27;t expect the performance of a professional/commercial version with which you may have had first hand experience.    </li>
      <li>It basically ruined my nails the first time I used it.  </li>
      <li>we purchased this item to use for our elderly patients that require more than a simple nail file.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t get much use out of it either!</li>
      <li>Nail polish may require a solvent to remove from the abrasive effectively, and if so, be careful to avoid getting any solvent on the plastic parts.</li>
      <li>Far better to never charge a new battery than to charge it and allow it to drain.  </li>
      <li>Better power supplies have an internal thermal overload cut-out feature so they can reset themselves when they cool down, but it costs more to make a power supply with this feature.</li>
      <li>It is best to use the Discs only on nails that are long enough to extend beyond your finger.</li>
      <li>I contacted customer service and talked to Elizabeth on two different occasions, first time to find out if they had the charger available, which they did.</li>
      <li>Wet, polished or nails with any softenable coating will have a greater tendency to coat the abrasive and reduce it&#x27;s effectiveness.</li>
      <li>And third, the attachments or \\&quot;bits\\&quot; are cheaply made.</li>
      <li>I now use this manicure kit to smooth the edges and keep their claws short.  </li>
      <li>(NiMH batteries hold a charge much longer than NiCad&#x27;s once charged so they don&#x27;t NEED to be recharged when disused for weeks or a couple months</li>
      <li>This product does its job very well.</li>
      <li>I was very eager to use this product.  </li>
      <li>The method used to secure the bits/attachments is adequate, but it&#x27;s definitely not the most positive bit-retention system I&#x27;ve ever come across, and under certain circunmstances the bits are likely to work loose.</li>
      <li>(When that happens the abrasive acts as if it&#x27;s a finer grade and cuts more slowly due to the reduced depth between the grains of abrasive.)  </li>
      <li>I am a customer from England and have found all the customer reviews on this product extremely helpful as I am looking for a suitable home pedicure/manicure system to use in between visits to a professionally trained chiropodist/podiatrist and manicurist.    </li>
      <li>The power supply could be simply redesigned with a vented case and/or a heat sink to help with passive cooling, but eventhis obviously costs more than what HoMedics feels is warranted, given the selling prce of these manicure sets, so from that standpoint</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s easy to put down and pick up again in half an hour if I want to do more.</li>
      <li>I think this would be a great product if you had fake or acrylic nails.   </li>
      <li>several times, so if the run time is very short the first time out, don&#x27;t necessarily give up, it will PROBABLY get better.</li>
      <li>Be Very careful that you do not touch any skin with the Discs as they spin super fast and Will give you a friction burn.</li>
      <li>Well, not really any better than pushing them back with a stick.</li>
      <li>and you encounter a situation where more working pressure or time is required than usual to do what you&#x27;ve done before, the abrasive part of the bit is most likely partially clogged.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It started working fine after waiting forever to charge it for the first time. Won&#x27;t charge anymore and won&#x27;t work! Didn&#x27;t get much use out of it either! Not worth the price!</li>
    <li> This product was a great buy. I bought this as a gift for my 15 year old daughter, she loves it. The initial charge was a bit long I thought, but that is to be expected with any rechargable item. It does everything that it claims to and she is thrilled with it. This product is well worth the price.</li>
    <li> Completely disappointed when I received this product. It will work for nothing more than a minute before it tires out (after fully charged). It does not have enough speed to actually do anything, let alone a proper manicure. I can&#x27;t say anything more than don&#x27;t buy it. Complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> This thing didn&#x27;t have enough power to even take the tiniest bit off of my soft, natural nails.  It was even more useless on acrylics.  I threw this junk away and bought a Dremel tool and some professional nail attachments for it instead!</li>
    <li> Releives the tedium of filing fingernails, and allows me to deal easily with tough toenails.</li>
    <li> Does the job. Useful.</li>
    <li> I have MANY Homedic products.  This is the first one I would not recommend, not because it hurts, as other reviews state, but because it essentially ruined my nails. For the first time in my life I had my own long nails--change in career. I use to file/polish etc. once a week. I got tired of getting new nail files all the time so thought that this item might do the trick. IT IS NOT EASY TO FILE WITH THIS ITEM AND IT BASICALLY TOOK ALL MY NAILS AWAY. I think this would be a great product if you had fake or acrylic nails.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So then I thought the cuticle portion of this item would work.  Well, not really any better than pushing them back with a stick. As far as the \\&quot;mechincal\\&quot; cuticle item, I thought it was doing a good job so I thought all my money was not wasted.  However, ever since then, as the nails have grown out, they have been weak and in bad shape and have broken.  I assume (although not sure but it is a good coincidence) that this is because of the \\&quot;trimming\\&quot; they got when they were still back at the cuticle.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Again, trying to \\&quot;file\\&quot; the toe nails is also a waste and can be done better and faster with a regular file (unless you have really thick toe nails which I do not).  I have used the \\&quot;filer\\&quot; on the callouses on my feet--sort of like a pumice stone.  It is an expensive pumice stone but this seems to be the only use I can get out of this item. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I give it three stars because it is HoMedics so it is a good product, but it just does not do what it should do.  For that reason I would not recommend this item.</li>
    <li> What a disappointment. First of all, it doesn&#x27;t have enough power.  Applying any kind of pressure will bring the rotating action to a stop. Second, the charge only lasts about 20 minutes. And third, the attachments or \\&quot;bits\\&quot; are cheaply made. The flat discs are worthless for filing but do a great job of leaving a dark residue on your skin. (Like the kind you get when polishing metal). The 2 cutting type bits wore down to useless after minimal usage. Same with the cone shaped bit. I would rate this as 2 (at best) out of 5.</li>
    <li> First of all, we had a slightly different model, the MAN-200, but based on several other reviewer&#x27;s comments, I think that some have had the same experience as we did with ours, so I&#x27;m posting the review here. The different models share many features, so this review is pertinent as to most particulars. I&#x27;m including some tips garnered from long usage of these.     Ours worked fine for several years, until I eventually overtaxed it by running it too long-working on some very thick toenails. The charging cord plug end that attaches to the handpiece is a weak point in the basic design, as is the charger. The motor is not a strong one but it&#x27;s adequate. It will easily stop if too much pressure is used. If you want a faster removal of material, other machines are out there.  Overall I&#x27;d give this a B+ for what it claims to do vs what it does. 4.5 out of 5 stars, just don&#x27;t expect the performance of a professional/commercial version with which you may have had first hand experience.    A very light touch is all that&#x27;s necessary (or adviseable) for the HoMedics bits to work properly in most cases. Working in one spot too long or using excessive pressure can produce significant frictional heat-especially objectionable if working on the nail surface directly above the quick itself, and quite possibly actual lasting pain if you&#x27;re not careful, so be forewarned. Be especially careful about reducing nail thickness.       If you&#x27;ve used yours for a while and you encounter a situation where more working pressure or time is required than usual to do what you&#x27;ve done before, the abrasive part of the bit is most likely partially clogged. (When that happens the abrasive acts as if it&#x27;s a finer grade and cuts more slowly due to the reduced depth between the grains of abrasive.)  The abrasive itself is much harder and tougher than human (or dog) nails-but it is susceptible to loading up. Depending on what it&#x27;s clogged with will indicate what to use to try to clean it off/out. Nail polish may require a solvent to remove from the abrasive effectively, and if so, be careful to avoid getting any solvent on the plastic parts. A hard bristle toothbrush or wire brush and water should work to remove natural nail residue from the abrasive-maybe add a little scouring powder if that doesn&#x27;t get it all off.             Working on fully dry nails that do not have any foreign coating on them creates a dry dust that does not stick to the bits much at all. Wet, polished or nails with any softenable coating will have a greater tendency to coat the abrasive and reduce it&#x27;s effectiveness. The metal bit ends have a fused-on coating that will NOT come off off as would the abrasive on an emery board-effectively lasting the life of the machine when used only on nails. On the other hand, because the abrasive is so tough, it can reduce the THICKNESS as well as the length of nails wherever it is used, so be careful when working around the cuticle as you can easily and QUICKLY thin the nail so much that it will cause a problem-as another reviewer mentioned.       The method used to secure the bits/attachments is adequate, but it&#x27;s definitely not the most positive bit-retention system I&#x27;ve ever come across, and under certain circunmstances the bits are likely to work loose. When that happens they don&#x27;t fly away, so it&#x27;s not a big deal.  Don&#x27;t attempt to jam them back into the handpiece while it&#x27;s running-you&#x27;ll eventually damage the meshing parts if you do that. If a bit doesn&#x27;t seem to \\&quot;snap\\&quot; in easily, rotate the bit&#x27;s working tip (the turning part, not the base of the bit) relative to the handpiece until it does. You can easily see the orientation required of the bit to mesh properly by simply looking into the handpiece&#x27;s bit recess and into the base of the bit, and manualy aligning the bit visually if you come across an occasional difficult matchup.     THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO DO WHEN YOU GET ONE OF THESE IS TO read THE MANUAL COVER TO COVER-IT&#x27;S ONLY A FEW PAGES PEOPLE! If you don&#x27;t read the manual there are things you may find objectionable, and which may cause you to make complaints, but which are clearly stated.      In this model&#x27;s manual, for those impatient people, it clearly says to charge it for 16 hours the first time. HOWEVER, what it ALSO says is that this model can be used WITH the power supply cord attached. (The MAN-200 model and some others can ONLY be used with the power supply attached to the handle, but aren&#x27;t rechargeable.....) So, in effect, you have 2 operating modes with this model:  1. cordless after being charged, and   2. With the cord attached if it&#x27;s inconvenient for you to charge it fully between uses.    It also say to NOT use the device for more than 20 minutes continuously. BELIEVE THIS.   That&#x27;s about how long it will take the CHARGING UNIT to heat up to the self-destruct point if it&#x27;s being run while plugged into the power supply. I know this because this is how I killed our power supply (MAN-200)-by overheating it. Afterwards the handpiece will still be capable of working, but if you can&#x27;t recharge or power it, it&#x27;s useless. The charger alone will be exorbitantly expensive to replace from HoMedics, and you&#x27;ll spend mor etime hunting one down elsewhere than it&#x27;s worth..... You can also overheat the power supply in LESS than 20 minutes (or run the battery down faster) by using more pressure, so keep the pressure light and if anything STARTS TO FEEL MORE THAN WARM (power supply or handpiece or your nail), take a break to let it cool off.     The power supply in several HoMedics units INCLUDING THIS ONE are constructed in such a way that they cannot cope with overheating except by self-destructing. Better power supplies have an internal thermal overload cut-out feature so they can reset themselves when they cool down, but it costs more to make a power supply with this feature. The power supply could be simply redesigned with a vented case and/or a heat sink to help with passive cooling, but eventhis obviously costs more than what HoMedics feels is warranted, given the selling prce of these manicure sets, so from that standpoint it&#x27;s understandable for corners to be cut in their design. It&#x27;s cheaper to print a \\&quot;20 minute\\&quot; warning in the manual than to do anything else.          A few things that are not mentioned in the manual should be kept in mind with any NiCad or NiMH battery equipped rechargeable unit.   In general, NiCad-equipped devices should not be KEPT attached to the plugged-in charger all the time for days or weeks on end as this can kill the charger/power supply and/or battery. (NiMH batteries hold a charge much longer than NiCad&#x27;s once charged so they don&#x27;t NEED to be recharged when disused for weeks or a couple months-I suspect these are NiCads-they&#x27;re cheaper to manufacture.)     No matter which battery is in the unit, NiCad AND NiMH battery-equipped devices will both often increase their usable capacity (running time) after being cycled (charged and discharged) several times, so if the run time is very short the first time out, don&#x27;t necessarily give up, it will PROBABLY get better. IF it doesn&#x27;t that&#x27;s what a warranty is for. In fact, I&#x27;d reccomend just turning the unit on and letting it run with no load after the first recharge to get an idea of how long it will run, then recharge it and use it.     Remember though that it&#x27;s adviseable to NOT discharge the battery until it&#x27;s COMPLETELY DEAD before recharging it as this will sometimes decrease the battery&#x27;s actual ability to be recharged or may discharge it to the point that the charger will THINK that the battery is dead, because the voltage is lower that the designed-in point at which the charger will allow it to be charged even if the charger is ok. So, when it slows down a fair amount, or when it stops more easily under a light load, turn it off, put it aside to let it cool down, then recharge it.</li>
    <li> okay, so i got this item for my dog, yes my DOG, she is fussy and hates to have her nails clipped and I for one am deathly afraid of clipping her nails too short and hurting her, so i&#x27;ve gone to weekly peticures on all her paws, the unit is sturdy, the bits are great and of course if you  apply too much pressure it will stop turning, this is a nail file and buffer, not a dremmel. the charge lasts week after week, and it is worth the money. don&#x27;t let those other reviewers throw you off b/c they say \\&quot;oh its too weak!\\&quot; or \\&quot;Oh! when you press hard it stops turning\\&quot; NO KIDDING!? like i said, its a buffer, not a DREMMEL tool! don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this item, it works like a charm :)</li>
    <li> I bought this product last year and could not get it to work (even after charging it).  Not too long ago I tried it again before throwing it awaay.  Ureka! this time it worked.</li>
    <li> I was very eager to use this product.  I had all sorts of various files and clippers to keep up with and I thought this would be a great replacement.  I was a little disappointed when I had to let the hand set charge for over 18 hours before I could get full power.  My disappointment increased when the cheap plastic attachments started breaking after just a few uses.  We can not use the nail filing disks because they will cause a friction pain if you use them at the wrong angle.  I had big hopes for this product but all I got was a big disappoinment!</li>
    <li> Nicely packaged and works like a charm for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll never nick your little toe again with this thing.</li>
    <li> I love Homedics products and this is another A+++++.   I bought this to use on my natural nails.  Had I wanted a machine for acrylics I would have purchased a professional dremel. This is just the best machine I have ever owned for natural nail care and you cannotbeat the price. I got a great deal here on Amazon and far better price even tahn eBay gad w/shipping included.      BTW-The reason you have to charge the battery for an initial 16 hrs is because they never charged the battery on the line because they did not know how long it would be sitting on the shelf, unsold. Far better to never charge a new battery than to charge it and allow it to drain.  Once it drains from sitting it weakens the battery.  This way the battery comes to the customer brand new-unused with no drain-weakening.Homedics keeps the customer in mind. Love my new nail machine.</li>
    <li> we purchased this item to use for our elderly patients that require more than a simple nail file. The tool is easy to use and works great.</li>
    <li> My wife got one of these and typically decided to try it out giving me a pedicure. I have since learned to dread the sound of that whinning motor even more than a dentist&#x27;s drill. Unless you keep it in continous motion and a at a PERFECT angle, the rapid rotation causes friction which burns your nail (and or skin) and causes intense, sharp pain. You might as well run to your tool box and put an electric drill or dremmel with a sanding disk on your hands and feet. &lt;br /&gt;Do not throw away your money on this thing unless you plan to use it for filing plastic or anything not atttached to a human being.-</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had a difficult time keeping my nails looking nice. Hang nails seem to sprout regularly. Until I had this product it was very difficult to get into the small space at the root of the hangnail to file. I was also challenged by the heavier cuticle skin that needs to be pushed back and then cut or filed. When I&#x27;ve used the manual cuticle tools for trimming I would invariably cut too deep on one or two nails. And if I filed I always had trouble getting into the hard-to-reach corners, and I&#x27;d end up with marks on my nails themselves from filing the cuticles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now have perfect-looking cuticles.  I love the pyramid shape and the small rounded shape for my cuticles. It&#x27;s so easy to use my toenails even look perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had known a product like this would solve my nail/hand problems, I would have bought one 30 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why didn&#x27;t i give it 5 stars?  The charge lasts 15-30 minutes. Since I keep it next to the couch it&#x27;s easy to put down and pick up again in half an hour if I want to do more. I love being able to use it not plugged in, so having to recharge it after 15 mins is a trade-off I&#x27;m okay with, but ideally it would last forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also wish I could find replacement parts. I lost (my dogs hid?) the pointed cone, which was my favorite for cuticles.</li>
    <li> This product does its job very well. You need to be carefull and patient when using this item.If you rush trimming your nails, you will hurt yourself. It is true almost about many items that you use on a daily bases. Consider you are impatient and not carefull when using a hot water kettle, you&#x27;ll burn yourself. People who complained about this product had to use it slowely, but surely.I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I agree with the reviews from the other reviewers.  It basically ruined my nails the first time I used it.  However what I did discover is that this is an excellent products for keeping my dogs claws trimmed.  After trimming their claws you often get rough edges.  I now use this manicure kit to smooth the edges and keep their claws short.  They don&#x27;t seem to mind it becuase it is very quiet.  I must state that I will never again use this product for my own nails.</li>
    <li> I used to spend at least $ 20.00 a month for a manucurist to &#x27;do&#x27; my nails  I decided I could do almost as good a job if I bought this little item.....  I got it and the more I use it the better I get at doing my nails..the part  I enjoy most is I get compliments on my nails all the time and it has cost me nothing for my nails to look great.  With the economy like it is why spend any money you don&#x27;t HAVE to...but you don&#x27;t have to look shabby either.    Gelene Matonti</li>
    <li> This is the second one for me.  It works great. I had the first one for about ten years.  I think I just wear it out.</li>
    <li> I am a customer from England and have found all the customer reviews on this product extremely helpful as I am looking for a suitable home pedicure/manicure system to use in between visits to a professionally trained chiropodist/podiatrist and manicurist.    Nailcare and care of the hands and feet is extremely important as all kinds of injuries can lead to greater health problems/infections (especially for persons with diabetes).    My impression of this product is that it has very useful attachments (more so than the Revlon system which I purchased in the UK).      I can see the point about it being like a dentist&#x27;s instrument.   As a dental surgery assistant I agree that it is very similar to the kind of attachments that we use for filing and shaping teeth - especially prosthetics - in the surgery,  and must therefore be used with great care as the attachments could cause a lot of damage.    I was tempted to buy the Homedics system as I thought that using the appliance as gently as possible might be useful - but the comment about the appliance being difficult to charge up/recharge for use has made me decide not to purchase this particular appliance.    I hope that the manufacturers of this appliance will take note of their customers&#x27; comments and attempt to produce a much better product.      Bearing in mind my comments about damage to the extremeties (hands and feet) it could be a potentially dangerous product for diabetic patients if injury occurs with its use.</li>
    <li> my wife wanted one so i got on line and ordered it , my love life has been great so far</li>
    <li> Not a &#x27;Verified Buyer&#x27;.  So, why review?  Because I have had this manicure set for 15 years...Yes, the same one for 15 years! It doesn&#x27;t get heavy use though, because I use regular files to maintain between manis. I don&#x27;t know why more people don&#x27;t have this set as I think it is the Best.  Some things you should know if you&#x27;ve not used one of these before.  1. Take the buffing head (one that has the felt) and measure or take to a hardware store with you immediately and buy some soft felt pads-like the kind you use to keep cupboards from banging shut.  You will go through lots of these. Best buffing ever. You can also put on a velcro dot the same size as the head and use that to attach new pieces of felt (Do Not use Craft felt).  2. When using the shaping discs, it is better to move the nail across the disc. If you try to run the super fast spinning disc across your nails you may have alot of breaking and chipping and your nail will not be as smooth. I always use the lowest speed for fingernails, as mine are thin and always hold the tool stationary while moving my nails across the disc.  3.  Be Very careful that you do not touch any skin with the Discs as they spin super fast and Will give you a friction burn. It is best to use the Discs only on nails that are long enough to extend beyond your finger. I personally, never use the Discs on my toenails as I keep them short and after getting a friction burn figured it best to use the cone shaped file heads for toenails. 4.  Be Extremely careful with the  cone shaped files when removing and buffing cuticle areas. A light touch is best and remember: If you touch your nail at all Ever with these pointy files, you WILL end up with a groove in your nails when they grow out. Took me a couple of months to figure out why some of my nails had moon shaped grooves. Oops! My bad. Still better for cuticle smoothing than any over tool and works really well if your cuticles are Damp!!  The hardest part to get used to is getting the right angle for filing. I have thin nails so only use the finest Disc and have to be very careful.  Thicker nails will be more forgiving.  *** The absolute best part of this device is that It Will Strengthen Your Nails.  Remember forever ago when it was like a moral imperative for girls to sit and tap, tap tap their nails on their desks or tables?  It is a moral imperative... well, at least a beauty imperative. Tapping your nails, while annoying to others, will strengthen them just as high impact workouts strengthen our bones!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased the HOMEDICS Body Basics Style Spa Deluxe many years ago. I think this item is a must have for anyone who does there own manicure &amp; pedicures. I personally cannot live without this item, found this out when I brought it to my friends and left the charger at his house, the only way he could get it back to me was mail it. Well I never got it the post office said they found the envelope with nothing in it. I have not been able to use this item for three months. I contacted customer service and talked to Elizabeth on two different occasions, first time to find out if they had the charger available, which they did. Then again, when I realized after 3 months of not hearing from the post office that the charger was gone. This by far was the best customer service I have ever had with a company, she already had my information, and knew who I was, without me ever telling her. She placed a no-charge order for the item and I will receive it in 5-7 business days. I think she is Awesome, and that is the way a company should treat their customers. I definitely recommend this item or any of their other products.</li>
