<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> A friend recommended this cream to me.  I bought a jar and I am loving it.  I like that it is light and feels so good.  I liked it so much for my neck that I have been putting it on my face, too.  I&#x27;m in my 70s so I need help for those lines, too.  Will definitely recommend to other friends.</li>
    <li> I was given this product at a very good price in exchange of a good review.  So far I like it, good for its price</li>
    <li> I really like the cream. I use it everyday. It has changed my skin to a better and younger looking. Thank you for the opportunity to try!</li>
    <li> I am a big aficionado of anti aging products - specially the ones that work well for difficult and highly sensitive skin. I love the products that I have tried from Asana Beauty, as they are very gentle on my skin yet effective on wrinkles and fine lines. I am in my mid thirties, so I am very particular about what products to use on my face, neck and d&amp;eacute;colletage. Makeup won&#x27;t cover up your face and chest are (unless of course we&#x27;re talking about prosthetics), so I am uppin&#x27; my &amp;#34;anti aging product game&amp;#34; on these areas! I love how my skin looks like after using this product religiously. My skin easily absorbs it, it doesn&#x27;t have an icky residue and it has a very mild smell that I personally prefer. This is a great anti aging product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for others. I refuse to review or endorse products that I have not or will not personally try. Needless to say, I may be a product reviewer but my thoughts are real and none of the things I say on my reviews are made up or fake - they are all based on my experience/s with whatever product I am reviewing. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
    <li> This is a nice cream for the neck. It may have slight firming qualities, but nothing dramatic in the way of results. I have only been using for 2 weeks now,  I will continue to use and update this again. I can also say it doesn&#x27;t leave that grease fill to your skin like most cream do. Overall I am very please with this.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great cream. Only thing is i have dry skin so it doesn&#x27;t work well for me. I do like the light scent and the texture of the cream. Thank you :)</li>
    <li> This cream has worked great on my skin. It did not give me any sort of reaction.</li>
    <li> Great cream. Really soothing. Would order again.</li>
    <li> HAVE NOT SEEN ANY RESULTS YET, BEEN USING IT FOR A WEEK.  WILL GIVE IT MORE TIME</li>
    <li> love it! its very smooth and light.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about a week and have found that my skin is smoother and more moisturized than before. It is lightweight and has a pleasant fragrance. I feel it has helped reduce the appearance of my wrinkles and I will continue to purchase this product.</li>
    <li> I do not know if it really helps for wrinkles since I used for two days so far. But it absorbs well in skin. I like the product is not oily. I will continue to use the product to see if anything gets better..!</li>
    <li> Great product! got it free for testing. Super recommended! Smells nice. Been using for about a week, no changes yet. Will update after finishing the bottle.</li>
    <li> My skin is super soft after application, i can tell the difference in my skin. I have several products from this brand and I&#x27;m so satisfied with the brand.</li>
    <li> I use this on my neck in the morning and at night. It&#x27;s thick but doesn&#x27;t FEEL thick. It leaves skin feeling smooth and moisturized. The scent is nice and the formula is creamy! Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> This cream feels great going on, it is light, and non greasy. I have been using it nightly for about a month, and although I don&#x27;t have a lot of lines on my neck area, this has made the ones I do have less noticeable. I  have tried so many creams, dreams , and potions, I&#x27;m happy to find a skin care line that my skin seems to really respond to. It absorbs it quickly , and makes my skin feel so soft. I&#x27;m going to try it on the lines around my mouth and nose next. I&#x27;m hoping that it will make a difference there as well. I love Asana products, they stand behind what they sell, and from all that I have tried, they do what they claim to do.That is huge in my book!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* received this product free to evaluate and give my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> i used it on my neck and i love it..looking forward to buy more</li>
    <li> Its nice I just started using it and it doesnt have a funky smell. I feel like its a neutral smell. Doesnt feel to thick on. Ill just see what results I get from using it longer. Ive only used it about a week.</li>
    <li> My mom loves it. She used only a few days now, but she already says improvement.</li>
    <li> My face looked brighter the first week of using it.</li>
    <li> My wife uses it at night and she is very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> Just received this today can&#x27;t wait to try it will come back and review it hoping for a positive result only giving it 4 stars because I have not tested it</li>
    <li> I decided to try this cream after having great results with Asana Beauty&#x27;s Skin lightening cream. I was really impressed with that cream and I can say that I am equally impressed with this neck firming cream. I have been using this cream twice a day, once in the morning and once before bed, and seeing great results doing so. It goes on light and gentle and you can tell there are no harsh chemicals in this. I have tried several other creams, some costing four times as much, and this cream has by far given the best results. I definitely recommend this cream to anyone seeking a neck cream that actually works and at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Great at hydrating my skin and minimizing fine lines. It smells fresh and clean and the best part is there&#x27;s no harsh chemicals!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a few weeks now. It leaves my skin feeling very soft and moisturized. Haven&#x27;t really notice a difference. But I&#x27;ll keep on using to see.</li>
    <li> On the bottle it says neck and face cream, but if you have sensitive face, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend to use on that area. However, on the neck, it works fine. Seems to reduce the wrinkle on the neck.</li>
    <li> It works well. You can feel the tightening affect.  Leaves my face and neck soft. Will continue to buy it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom and she loves it!</li>
    <li> I love this cream!　Seems to smooth fine lines and firm up the neck a bit. Smells as good as it feels. I am going to purchase again.</li>
    <li> The consistency is good. Lightly scented. Feels good on the skin. Non greasy.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm. Great product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream has my night cream, so far so good, I will be stoping by, to give a full review.</li>
    <li> I love this neck and face cream.  I have used many high end brand neck creams and I am not always satisfied and end up returning them, however with this one I love that it does not feel heavy, sticky and grimy on my face.  It goes on very smooth and almost unnoticeable.  The smell is very light and non greasy.  My skin has not had breakouts from the product...so far I love it!</li>
    <li> Love this cream. I have very dry skin and this work perfect. I am using it for a few week now my skin feel tighter. I think I will continue using it.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t express how much I love Asana Beauty products! This is a nice quality cream comparable to things I&#x27;ve gotten at professional medical centers. I love the smoothness of it and it only takes a small amount. I&#x27;ll try to update when I start noticing changes in neck firmness as I&#x27;ve only been using it a short time. Nice product, awesome seller, worth a try!</li>
    <li> Feels good, not seeing any results</li>
    <li> It give a stretch of firmness on my skin. So good.</li>
    <li> Works great and really helps keep your neck firm and moisturized</li>
    <li> love this cream I have used alot of neck cream this is now one of my favorite</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for 2 weeks now and while it may be a good cream for others it has made break out. At first I thought it was because I changed lotion but kept using it and now I see little rashes all over so I had to stop using. But it is thick and seems to be a good lotion just not for my skin</li>
    <li> thanks. i love the texture.</li>
    <li> good result for me. going to order more.</li>
    <li> When using any type of cream on my body, I have 1 requirement.  That is it doesn&#x27;t break me out.  Sure there is other things I like and dislike about certain creams.  But my main concern is I don&#x27;t mess one thing up trying to fix another thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested a small area of my skin a couple days to see how I would react.  There was no break out so I was able to use this product as directed.  I used it nightly and then sometimes throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This didn&#x27;t leave a greasy or heavy feel.  It absorbed nice into my skin and I did start to notice a nicer softer firm feel.  I believe this stuff is really good for you and it is something I will continue to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I test products and then share my honest opinions about them.  That is what I am doing here, the company sent me this to try out and all of my opinions here are my own, they may or may not differ from yours.</li>
    <li> Cream is very effective, it tones and firm the neck muscles.</li>
    <li> After just a couple weeks of using I noticed softer skin, finer lines ,and firmer tighter skin, the smell is pleasant and enjoyable did not leave my skin feeling oily or greasy. Very happy with this product!!</li>
    <li> cream goes on nicely not too oily but the fragrant smell is a bit too strong for me</li>
    <li> This is my mom third bottle. She loves this product. She&#x27;s 61 after using this, she noticed a big difference on her skin.</li>
    <li> I just started to use this....shockingly immediate difference in the look of the skin. Firmer texture I would say. Perfect consistency, not greasy at all. I don&#x27;t know about long term improvement because I just received this product. I will say it made a difference the first time. I think the packaging is nice too.  good price as well.</li>
    <li> Leave skin feeling soft.  Doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling oily.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST natural neck firming cream I have tried! First, I am trans.... I love cosmetics and that is my passion since I am a stylist. I have bought all the asana products and thing they are very good quality. Just as good or better then the dept store items. some The emollient texture on this is perfect, no scent, and nice feel. I an 100% about recommending asana creams and this Neck firming cream for tightening the skin around my neck. I use it as a facial cream as well.</li>
    <li> This neck cream is awesome. I also used it as a face cream and as a chest cream and I definitely see a good improvement in the fine lines and skin tightening. I can definitely recommend this product for the sensitive areas of the skin like the neck, chest or eye areas. Though I probably wouldn&#x27;t use this as a eye gel or eye cream regularly because I have other products for that, it certainly is sensitive enough to use there. I will check back with an update.</li>
    <li> I very much like this and am excited to see the results and my skin firming.  I feel a difference after using it already. I ordered this product through a discount/promo amount.  I have used it for 1 day.  I enjoy the texture is non-greasy and smooth has a pleasing scent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product on and off for about a week so I have noticed any fine lines going away. I feel like it t doesn&#x27;t moisturize my skin much. It leaves a &amp;#34;tight&amp;#34; feeling and skin feels soft and smooth after application.</li>
    <li> Great product. Received in a timely manner.I have used it several days and I can truly see a difference.  I give this product  an A+.</li>
