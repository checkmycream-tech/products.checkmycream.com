      <li>Excellent.  </li>
      <li>The best lip primer I ever used .</li>
      <li>This is always a perfect match!</li>
      <li>Without the color, its great and versatile and works perfectly!</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to cause any sorts of sensitivity/allergy-type reactions or breakouts, which is great news for those with</li>
      <li>This is a great product.  </li>
      <li>For the price point it&#x27;s fair though I guess.</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>Nice product.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s own.  </li>
      <li>find this to be OK, but nothing spectacular.  </li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure how I&#x27;d like putting something AROUND my lips</li>
      <li>Will definitely continue to purchase this awesome product!</li>
      <li>okay.</li>
      <li>Its just okay</li>
      <li>I dont see myself reaching for it most of the time.</li>
      <li>So, I was excited to find this ELF pencil that does not need sharpening!  </li>
      <li>I was more excited than needed.</li>
      <li>It easily scrolls up for easy application.</li>
      <li>AND E.L.F. is cruelty free.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not as wonderful for my bottom lip, though, and I&#x27;m not sure why.  </li>
      <li>Sure keeps color from feathering, that happens as we get older.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it and hope to be able to continue to find it for years to come.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s affordable and does exactly what it claims to do!  </li>
      <li>I really like this pencil goes on smooth .I</li>
      <li>It has some benefits, especially with my top lip, but I&#x27;d like to be able to find one product that works equally well for both top and bottom lips.</li>
      <li>The actual lip liner fell out of the tube as soon as I got it, very cheaply made</li>
      <li>I love this lipliner because it provides the staying power of a primer without the hassle of color-matching every last lip shade.</li>
      <li>Larger size makes is easy to apply.</li>
      <li>keeps red from feathering into fine lines around lips</li>
      <li>and I have to say it really works: it prevents your lipcolor from feathering and it keeps everything looking neat and defined.</li>
      <li>This really helps to prevent feathering of lipstick.  </li>
      <li>Not crazy about this lip pencil - the Sally Hansen product is better though more expensive.</li>
      <li>The tip wears down very quickly within the first use or two</li>
      <li>but I could live without it.</li>
      <li>Just got on a new red-lipstick kick and needed something to keep things in check.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to assume that it does, because I haven&#x27;t noticed any feathering on my top lip (which is usually where I have the problem).  </li>
      <li>This liner is fine for a natural pink or mauve or a nude, not so much for a kick ass red or wine.  </li>
      <li>Since it&#x27;s clear, you can&#x27;t see whether or not it&#x27;s transferred to your lips.  </li>
      <li>I had been looking for a clear liner since the one I had been using was discontinued.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m guessing those reviewers are younger than me (46) or wear much lighter lipstick than I do.  </li>
      <li>sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I never used to have a problem with lipstick feathering, but for some reason, lately I&#x27;ve seen a bit more of that.  </li>
      <li>Normally I use Lipstick Queen or Urban Decay invisible lip liners</li>
      <li>I have a couple of lip liner pencils, but they&#x27;re all pretty dark (reds and browns)</li>
      <li>if you are over 30 yrs old and wear red lipstick this is a must !!</li>
      <li>Also, the product itself is hard enough that you can get a good, straight line -- but you don&#x27;t have to press very hard to apply the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Went on smoothly and didn&#x27;t leave my lips looking dry unlike some pencils I&#x27;ve used in the past .</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this lipliner because it provides the staying power of a primer without the hassle of color-matching every last lip shade.AND E.L.F. is cruelty free.</li>
    <li> Works great! I love it!</li>
    <li> It easily scrolls up for easy application. No sharpening needed.</li>
    <li> Sure keeps color from feathering, that happens as we get older. Works well.</li>
    <li> I used to use the Milani anti-feathering lip liner, but have issues with the Milani one because it needs sharpening quite often and you end up wasting a lot of product with every sharpening.  So, I was excited to find this ELF pencil that does not need sharpening!  This is a great product.  It&#x27;s affordable and does exactly what it claims to do!  You can either outline your lips with it or cover your entire lips with it - it works either way.  Will definitely continue to purchase this awesome product!</li>
    <li> Do nothing for me ...</li>
    <li> It did not stop my lipstick from bleeding through.  I was dissappointed in the product.</li>
    <li> The best lip primer I ever used . Went on smoothly and didn&#x27;t leave my lips looking dry unlike some pencils I&#x27;ve used in the past .</li>
    <li> This really helps to prevent feathering of lipstick.  I like this product and would buy it again.</li>
    <li> It does its job. I&#x27;m not much of a make-up expert &amp; really find it difficult to match lipstick w/ the right lipliner. This is always a perfect match!</li>
    <li> Nice product. Larger size makes is easy to apply. Will purchase again!</li>
    <li> This left my lips very, very dry. I would not buy again.</li>
    <li> This product works well. Just could be thinner.</li>
    <li> Just got on a new red-lipstick kick and needed something to keep things in check. This lip liner does it! Without the color, its great and versatile and works perfectly!</li>
    <li> if you are over 30 yrs old and wear red lipstick this is a must !! keeps red from feathering into fine lines around lips</li>
    <li> I was more excited than needed. Its okay. It does the job but I could live without it. I dont see myself reaching for it most of the time. Its just okay</li>
    <li> I just got this and I have to say it really works: it prevents your lipcolor from feathering and it keeps everything looking neat and defined. I like it.</li>
    <li> I never used to have a problem with lipstick feathering, but for some reason, lately I&#x27;ve seen a bit more of that.  I have a couple of lip liner pencils, but they&#x27;re all pretty dark (reds and browns) and I wanted something I could use with lighter colors of lipstick.  This seemed like it would be the perfect solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find this to be OK, but nothing spectacular.  Since it&#x27;s clear, you can&#x27;t see whether or not it&#x27;s transferred to your lips.  So it&#x27;s hard to tell if it stays on all day or not.  I&#x27;m going to assume that it does, because I haven&#x27;t noticed any feathering on my top lip (which is usually where I have the problem).  It doesn&#x27;t seem to cause any sorts of sensitivity/allergy-type reactions or breakouts, which is great news for those with sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not as wonderful for my bottom lip, though, and I&#x27;m not sure why.  I still have some problems with lipcolor migration around my bottom lip, even when using this product.  (This product also seems to interfere with using a makeup remover pen to take the migrated lipcolor off; perhaps it&#x27;s too thick for a makeup remover pen to be effective.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the ingredients, since they&#x27;re not listed on the product page:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mineral oil, Polymethyl Methacrylate, Polyethylene Aluminum Starch, Octenyl Succinate, Candelilla Microcrystalline Wax, Phenyl Trimethicone, Silica, Tribehenin, Phenoxyethanol, Propylparaben&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I like is that it comes in a twist-up tube instead of a pencil, so it doesn&#x27;t need sharpening.  Also, the product itself is hard enough that you can get a good, straight line -- but you don&#x27;t have to press very hard to apply the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, I may try other similar products before coming back to this one.  It has some benefits, especially with my top lip, but I&#x27;d like to be able to find one product that works equally well for both top and bottom lips.</li>
    <li> Not secure inside the tube. I opened it and it fell out.</li>
    <li> I still use this liner but I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d buy another. The tip wears down very quickly within the first use or two and then you have a wide nub to try and apply a thin line with. It tends to smear on me a lot which is frustrating. I have to be very careful when I use this product which I find annoying. For the price point it&#x27;s fair though I guess.</li>
    <li> Not crazy about this lip pencil - the Sally Hansen product is better though more expensive.</li>
    <li> This pencil has aluminum in it and I would never have bought it with that ingredient. I read the label after finding that it stings a little when applied. Buyer beware.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected I bought this thinking it was going to be a regular primer just tried it and does not do what it says my lipstick still feathered and in fact made my matte liquid lipstick look greasy on my lip line</li>
    <li> Excellent.  Works the best out of them all</li>
    <li> The actual lip liner fell out of the tube as soon as I got it, very cheaply made</li>
    <li> I really like this pencil goes on smooth .I apply only once ,later reapply lip gloss still no migrating of lip gloss above the lip line.Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I bought this lip liner because I needed to make my order at least $25 because the other thing in it was an add on item and they wouldn&#x27;t ship it. Normally I use Lipstick Queen or Urban Decay invisible lip liners but they&#x27;re 3 times the price.  This product is not lip liner size it&#x27;s much larger which isn&#x27;t a problem per se but the product is not seated well in the tube and goes up and down on it&#x27;s own.  I don&#x27;t like that.  I decided to try this product because some of the other reviews said that it keeps lip stick in place well.  I&#x27;m guessing those reviewers are younger than me (46) or wear much lighter lipstick than I do.  This liner is fine for a natural pink or mauve or a nude, not so much for a kick ass red or wine.  I don&#x27;t feel like I got ripped off but I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again either.</li>
    <li> I use E.L.F. pencil as a lip pencil--outlining my lips before I put my lipstick on.  It keeps the lipstick from feathering.</li>
    <li> I had been looking for a clear liner since the one I had been using was discontinued.  This works as well as what I was using and keeps my lipstick from feathering.  I also find that I only need to put it on once and there is no need to redo even after I may have wiped my mouth after eating.  I highly recommend it and hope to be able to continue to find it for years to come.</li>
    <li> Product arrived broken in the tube</li>
    <li> It works. It does. I wasn&#x27;t sure how I&#x27;d like putting something AROUND my lips (I had previously had a sample of a primer that was put on the lips before the color), but it doesn&#x27;t bother me because it really is clear. Lasts all day, even through removal and reapplication of lip color.</li>
