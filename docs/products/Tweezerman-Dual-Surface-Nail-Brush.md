<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Excellent. Performs well and fits well in the hand.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nail brush, works quite well</li>
    <li> Beautiful and functional just like all Tweezerman products.  I highly recommend getting one for your kitchen sink and also one for your shower.</li>
    <li> Need to keep your finger nails clean - be civilized and maintain good hygiene.  Please do not pick your nose afterwards.</li>
    <li> DH bought this, he&#x27;s a welder, and gets pretty grubby. He likes the stiffness of the bristles on the back, really does the job.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just what he was looking for.</li>
    <li> Like the rounded style better than those squared off ones. Easy to handle and comfortable to use as it does its job. Fast delivery</li>
    <li> I purchased two different nail brushes, the RUBBERMAID G111-12 HAND &amp; NAIL BRUSH 4-1/4&amp;#34; X 1-3/8&amp;#34; and Tweezerman Dual Surface Nail Brush because I didn&#x27;t know which one my husband would like.  The Tweezerman works better  than the Rubbermaid, it takes off all sorts of grime and top bristles gets perfectly under the nails.  Also my husband&#x27;s hands looks even cleaner.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000JLFFGE Tweezerman Dual Surface Nail Brush]]  This brush does a nice job but it is a pain putting it back together often. It&#x27;s made of two parts and they separate.</li>
    <li> Ordered this brush to clean the dirt from under my nails after working in the yard... and it works great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush for four years now and it&#x27;s still doing the job.  Unlike the brushes I&#x27;ve had before, this one has not fallen apart; the top row of bristles has lost a little shape but not enough to render it ineffective.  That&#x27;s saying something, since that&#x27;s the part of it I use the most.  I have moderately long nails and it never fails to get the grime out.  Keep it clean and it&#x27;ll go for miles.  I hope they&#x27;re still making these when mine finally does fall apart.</li>
    <li> Good quality.  I like the brush on the top more than the larger brush on the bottom.</li>
    <li> I love this one so much I&#x27;m tempted to order another one only I don&#x27;t need it.  I use it every day at my bath sink.</li>
    <li> What a wonderful idea!  The top side of the brush makes it easy to clean under those dirty nails. I bought this item as a gift and the recipient loves it.</li>
    <li> I love Tweezerman products ... so when I saw this nail brush by Tweezerman, I decided to buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have acrylic nails and need to keep them super clean (I want to avoid any infection, fungus).  This brush is absolutely perfect for that.  It has the regular surface which is nice but as a bonus it has a single row of bristles that let you really clean those nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are not too hard and not too soft -- I think they are just right.  This brush is a quality product and I think should last a good, long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Tried a few other brushes, but they always turned out to have weak brissels that never held up or were too soft to do the job. This brush will probably be the last I need as it is built to last and has solid firm brissels.</li>
    <li> I like that it is larger than most which could have made it easy to hold when scrubbing your nails...untill it gets wet and soapy.  Because the plastic sides of the brush are smooth and rounded when you add water, soap and vigerous scrubbing and it makes the brush difficult to hold on to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are too soft, and the rows are spaced too far apart. I have run into softer brushes which are worthless but if you have crubby gardening, construction, or mechanics hands this brush won&#x27;t work well for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d expected the top bristles to be much more firm.</li>
    <li> Best nailbrush I have ever bought! Plan to buy another one when I need to fill my Amazon cart up to the $25 free shipping amount!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nail bush works as expected very pleased.</li>
    <li> Not as stiff as I hoped. A very good hair brush for a baby or elderly person but not a great nail brush. I use it to \\&quot;comb\\&quot; my 83 year old mother&#x27;s hair. Very soft.</li>
    <li> I had a similar brush for years that finally fell apart in its old age.  I&#x27;m a gardener who hates wearing gloves this is a terrific nail/hand cleaner getting out even deeply embedded dirt!</li>
    <li> This really works and it&#x27;s great to have at the sink.  I&#x27;ve been able to very quickly get the nails clean.  It seems to be showing some wear, with the bristles going sideways just a bit.</li>
    <li> Nail brush is really good. I like it because has 2 different brushes to clean your nails.</li>
    <li> I had searched stores for a brush such as this but could not find one. I am happy I found one on line. I am very satisfied with this product. The brush does a great job of cleaning under your fingernails.</li>
    <li> Delivered as said.  Good service.  Nice brush.  Would buy again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never owned a nail brush before, but after buying this, I can attest to the strange awesomeness that comes with having ridiculously clean nails. In terms of the brush itself, it&#x27;s well made, and the row of stiff bristles on the back is helpful, but I find myself using the main brush part the most, as I feel that it gets my nails cleaner, faster. One of the reviewers mentioned the brush getting rusty, and I&#x27;m not sure how that&#x27;s possible, as there are no metal parts. Overall, it&#x27;s cheap and great.</li>
    <li> good for travel too...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had one before and was happy to find on Amazon. I especially like the single row, and find that it works best if I hold brush still and move nails back and forth. Recommend, but...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almost forgot to mention that getting the brush out of it&#x27;s clamshell plastic package requires a lot of determination with intervals of swearing and frustration. If you have arthritis or other hand problems, try to get someone else to open for you.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t believe how great this little brush is.  Have purchased one for each sink and the tub....well made and does the job instantly</li>
    <li> This is a super product for those of us in the clay world of hand building. It came promptly via US mail.  All in all, it was a good experience.</li>
    <li> I used to work in an auto shop and grease would get under our nails. We had a nail brush at the sink similar to this one in design, but a little more heavy duty. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, this looks like it is constructed well and should last. The brushes are perfect for cleaning stubborn messes under your nails. Anyone would benefit from having this and for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong. It will work fine for removing grease and grime under your nails.</li>
    <li> Keep this wonderfully designed little nail brush by the sink for quick had clean-up after gardening. Two sets of bristles make it possible to clean off snail and slug slime, yet the shorter bristles on top make washing up easy and can get under your nails.</li>
    <li> Standard nail brush.  Pretty basic, but well made.</li>
    <li> excellent.  Just what I was looking for. Bristles not too long nor too short.  Gets into spaces I couldn&#x27;t reach before.</li>
    <li> While trying to become more proactive about preventing foodborne illness I learned about nail brushes. I quickly ordered these and keep them in the kitchen and bathrooms. They are incredibly effective for cleaning your hands, arms, and under the nails. The brush does not shed bristles and seems to be very durable. It also stays clean and doesn&#x27;t collect odors or stains. I really recommend these for anyone who is trying to cut down on the spread of pathogens.</li>
    <li> Love this nail brush for the most part!  Love the side that has the bristles facing sideways. For the price you can&#x27;t beat it. Bristles do soften with use but I think anything in this price range will. Have used for a few months now and almost ready to replace. Use it a lot after doing work around the house/yard (after gardening, cleaning pellet stove and wood stove, etc).  Works great!  Will definitely buy more soon!</li>
    <li> I love these nail brushes.  Purchased several less expensive ones earlier and in no time the second layer of bristles was useless.  These cost more but even with very frequent use, they are quality and stay firm and in place.</li>
    <li> Although this brush was only $3, it works as it&#x27;s intended to; cleans under your nails. As others have mentioned, the single row of bristles does lose stiffness over time, but at that kind of bargain, I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had one of these for 14 months now, here to order some more.  I work construction and my nails are VERY dirty by the end of the day.  Used various nail brushes over the years and this is easily the best.  The original one still works fine also, I&#x27;m just finally getting around to buying some more to put in other places.</li>
    <li> Love that this brush has 2 types of bristles on it...one for tough scrubbing and softer ones on the bottom.  Works like a charm for my grungy nails and my 3.5 YO.  Wish I would have bought this sooner!</li>
    <li> I bought this to clean under my nails after working on aircraft. The bristles are way too soft to get under my nails. They are so soft I think these are designed for a baby. I&#x27;m super disappointed that this doesn&#x27;t do the job. If you have dirty man nails look elsewhere, gents.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very hard to find nail brushes with the narrow side brush that gets under your nails.  It works great!</li>
    <li> These are great.  Every bathroom ought to have one.  You can&#x27;t properly clean your hands without them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To anyone who thinks the bristles on these babies are too soft, you are a bigger man than I.  I find the bristles are just fine for cleaning under the nail and, if they were any more hard-core, I think the bristles would be painful to use!</li>
    <li> After transplanting 8 trees and doing a bunch of other gardening and maintenance work, I had a party to attend.  I used this excellent brush to clean under and over my nails and hands, to get them sparkling clean.  Works very well to get all the grit and grime out.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect size to fit in the palm of the hand, and good design with dual set of bristles.</li>
    <li> A decent nail brush.  I purchased it to clean out the assorted grime that accumulates after a day of construction, and it does fairly well.  I wish it had stiffer bristles, and also have had some problems with grimy water getting inside the body of the brush, as it is constructed of two pieces popped together.  This is not an issue for anything but aesthetics, however, as it does not effect the function of the brush.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with this product.  The row of bristles on the side of the brush are stiff enough to get down under my fingernails and remove that pesky dirt that is so hard to get to.  I would highly recommend this.  In fact, I have them in three different places in my house.  I have tried to find it locally to no avail.  Thanks once again, Amazon!</li>
    <li> Gentle bristles that allow you to effectively clean the grime out of the nooks and crannies!</li>
    <li> This brush is great and soft, one of the best nail brushes I have used so far. Not much more to say about nail brushes.</li>
    <li> I purchased 2 of these. Gave one to my boyfriend and his only lasted a week! Mine is getting mildew inside of it after a month! Yet my Fuller nail brush is still going after 25 years!!! Pay the extra money for Fuller and don&#x27;t look back.</li>
    <li> I purchase this product and initially it worked very well.  I like the design, it fits very well in your hand...that&#x27;s why it received the stars I gave it.  Why only 2 stars..the plastic is very smooth, if you use this in the shower it becomes very slippery and will fall out of your hand quite easily.  I had dropped this in my shower and it cracked (very brittle)...once it cracked the it was susceptible to mold (water gets trapped inside).  I had to throw mine in the trash.  If they make changes to the product I may consider purchasing, but in my opinion not worth the money.</li>
    <li> Bought my first Tweezerman about three years ago.  The brush works great and the bristles have held up very well, which was a weak point on most dollar store brushes.  But the two-piece hard plastic casing is a weak point - when dropped on a hard surface it is likely to crack, chip or just split open at the seam.  Minor damage is easily repaired with glue and/or caulk, but better glue from the factory and a rubber outer edge would make this brush MUCH more durable.  Also, the price has doubled since my first purchase, making it both expensive and somewhat brittle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make it cheaper or make it better and this is easily a five-star buy.  But it barely gets a four at its current price (about $7).</li>
    <li> Great product!!!!  Best nail brush I have used. That is all I have to sau but they want to write more which is really stupid and I will not do anymore reviews,</li>
    <li> This works fine and appears well made, a little expensive though.  I went to  Walmart and Target and could not find a small hand brush.  Probably spent more money on gas than what I paid for it.</li>
    <li> Product lasts for years and years and years.  We have one in every shower and at every sink.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with this nail brush which is what I wanted.  Long time hunting at amazon before I found this item that best suits my needs for use in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered 3 nail brushes &amp; keeping 2 nail brushes in stock for later when my family will need to replace their nail brushes.</li>
    <li> This is simply the best nail brush I have ever used, and I garden without gloves, so I would know!</li>
    <li> Cheap, awkward bristles. Not worth it.</li>
    <li> Amazing how much gunk this gets rid of from under my nails when I work with my pups.... really a good product...</li>
    <li> Bought 3 different hand/nail brushes to compare. BEST ONE without a doubt.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about a month now and the staples that hold the bristles, are already rusted. Since the handle and bristles are white, the rust really shows. It still functions (the bristles are firm enough to get dirt out but not so stiff that it hurts), but it is unsightly. I&#x27;m surprised a product designed to be held under running water would have rustable parts.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a gardener who gets dirt under her nails every day, &amp; this puppy is THE BEST nail brush! The little angled brush on the top is awesome--I use it more than the main brush! Worth the price, long-lasting.</li>
    <li> Thought the bristles would be firmer. Also, there&#x27;s no way to set it down without one side of the bristles or the other getting wet.Don&#x27;t think it&#x27;ll last very long.</li>
    <li> Rather you garden, brush your pet or whatever you do around your home a nailbrush is highly advisable to get your nails clean. This brush is gentle enough to not hurt your skin and cleans around the cuticle and under the nail quickly as well as the palms of your hands. Highly recommend for everyone.</li>
    <li> Hubs loves this one. NO RUST!</li>
    <li> One of THE BEST nail brushes I have ever used.  It&#x27;s very stiff and cleans outer an inner nail very, very well.</li>
    <li> I have horses and a kennel and a fabulous garden...so needless to say my hands get dirty. I also have a job as a professional, so can&#x27;t go to work looking like a farm hand! This is one of two best nail/hand brushes that I have ever had...and the other I only had one of and I never found again. I was very excited once I used this one as it did the same great job as my long since gone &#x27;best one&#x27;. I have tried others and they just never worked as well.</li>
    <li> I only had this brush for about a month until it fell off a shower shelf and the plastic cracked.  At that point the brush split into two pieces.  I snapped the pieces back together, but a few weeks later it fell off the shelf again causing a few entire chunks of plastic to splinter off one side of the brush.  It wouldn&#x27;t snap back together.  I threw half of the brush away and still use the other half.  Even before it broke I would have only given this brush 3 stars.  The bristles are too soft to do any serious scrubbing.  It&#x27;s my least favorite finger nail brush that I have ever owned and the only one that has ever had the plastic crack.</li>
    <li> Cheap and comes apart.  It is hollow and the bristle plates snaps in place but is not glued.</li>
    <li> This nail brush started to show signs of rust around the bristles after less than 1 month of use. This brush was also hard to hold on to when it&#x27;s wet and soapy.  Something with a handle, or a more ergonomic shape would be better for use in the bath/shower. The bristles aren&#x27;t as hard as I thought they would be. The 5 rows of bristles on the bottom are much softer than the single row of bristles on the top of the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rust isn&#x27;t bad enough...yet...to throw the brush away, so it will be demoted to my cleaning bucket to be used on dirt and grime around the house.</li>
    <li> Good size &amp; not too rough.  I gave it to my elderly father and it&#x27;s the perfect size.</li>
    <li> hard to find-love these</li>
    <li> broke 30 seconds after opening package.  Dropped it in the shower as I was putting it in a tray and it broke into 3 pieces.&lt;br /&gt;made with wrong materials.</li>
    <li> I buy one or two of these every year just to make sure I never run out of them.  The best ever for really cleaning your nails.  I am a preschool teacher and get paint, etc. under my nails at school.  This is THE BEST brush for getting all the grit and grime out from a day of art projects!!!!</li>
    <li> Nice brush, but it does tend to get rust spots around the brushes if you leave it in a moisturized area too long.</li>
    <li> I loved this nail brush until I dropped it in the shower and it broke!  So it lasted maybe 2 weeks...  but if it were made of some better plastic I would highly recommend. As a avid gardener I always need to clean under the nails and the edge for that worked better than any other I have ever used.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been buying this product for years but these do not have the same durable bristles.. the inferior bristles have me wondering if it is a knock off.</li>
    <li> Great for cleaning your nails.</li>
    <li> Great little nail brush!  I had been looking for a brush that included the slanted bristles on the top.  Cleans nails beautifully.</li>
    <li> Terrible quality. Every bristle hole has rust after two uses.</li>
    <li> Works great. No cheaply made..soft but stiff brush</li>
    <li> The fingernail bristles are too far apart to effectively clean between the nails. The larger bristle area, too is not good for cleaning nails. Plus the bristles are way too soft to really clean greasy hands and fingers. The grip also is too smooth and slippery when soaped up. I recommend the Great Neck Saw 933B Fingernail Brush Although it is listed as having &amp;#34;Lightweight anodized aluminum non-slip handle&amp;#34;, it is plastic. But for $5.51 you cant beat it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004FELNTO?psc&#x3D;1&amp;redirect&#x3D;true&amp;ref_&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o05_s01</li>
    <li> Good customer service and quick delivery.  Would use this vendor again.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> For decades surgeons have been using a brush similar to this design, and with good reason.  The angle of the bristles actually cleans underneath the fingernails.  If you ever get your hands dirty, this is the tool to get them clean.</li>
    <li> Very soft on my delicate hands.</li>
    <li> Bought this item specifically because of the fingernail cleaning arrangement.  I had a different brand previously that was lost in a move.  It was a a great brush with strong bristles that really cleaned.  Can&#x27;t seem to find it for sale anymore, so I thought I&#x27;d give this one a try.  However, the bristles on the Tweeserman aren&#x27;t strong enough to clean under the nail...not very effective at all.  The brush itself is okay, but I would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Have always had good results with this brand and style. Bristols don&#x27;t fall out...gives you two ways to clean your nails.</li>
    <li> We make a game out of washing our hands and nails with our toddler.&lt;br /&gt;Nice soft brush and well made too.</li>
    <li> Anything by Tweezerman is great!</li>
    <li> I work as a mnaintenance mechanic in a smelting plant.  As aresult my hands look like a miners or mechanics would at the end of the day , especially under the nails.  This brush does a great job of getting the dirt out of my creases and the brush on the back works wonders on my nails, getting all the goop out from under them.</li>
    <li> Was much better then I expected. At least for me, the brissels are firm on the main side of the brush....The single row is even better. I have read some poor reviews here and they almost stopped me from purchasing this product. I&#x27;m glad I did buy this. It is one of the best nail brushes I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
    <li> Love these. They last a long time</li>
    <li> Originally I wanted wooden brush because it had a better angle on the side that fits under the nails but I am impressed with the life of the body on the plastic brush.</li>
    <li> I ordered 6 of these from J &amp; R Music/Computers (went directly to them because I could only order 1 or 2 from the Amazon website at the time) to save on shipping because my last nail brush w/a single row for nails was purchased from Avon 32 years before.  I found that if you use the same brush over and over the single row of bristles seems to splay (spread out) and not able to get under the nails as when new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since we have them placed in the kitchen and 2 bathrooms I found that the less used ones seem to stay in better shape.  I ended up purchasing 6 more when Amazon.com had them for sale recently (with free shipping this time) and hope that alternating use of more than one will cause a better lifespan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7/21/12 I still buy these brushes for us, for our grown children, relatives, etc. A thought...when the single row gets worn out (doesn&#x27;t wear down - just spreads) -- just keep the brush to use the bottom bristles for everything -- hands, scrubbing the bathroom sinks, etc. Works great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE THESE BRUSHES!!!</li>
    <li> I love using this brush because the design allows you to easily and thoroughly clean under your nails.  Ordering a new one, as my husband let the last one slip down into the garbage disposal!  Giving 4 stars because the smooth plastic design makes it a little tricky to hang on to with soapy hands.</li>
    <li> Great brush. Use it on my snowboard after I wax it. Works like a charm and was very inexpensive, would buy again</li>
    <li> Have one of these at every sink, especially great for the gardeners in our family.</li>
    <li> brush isn&#x27;t strong enough to clean under nails</li>
    <li> This is a quality product. Works as advertised . This item was packaged well and delivered early.</li>
    <li> This is a consumable product-keep that in mind. The quality appears lackluster since it won&#x27;t last too long, but that&#x27;s the point. It&#x27;s cheap. It will work for a while. I thought I&#x27;d save a bit buying here rather than in the store, but it&#x27;s all the same in terms of quality.</li>
    <li> The best nailbrush money can buy. I have been using them for many years. Nothing else matches them.</li>
    <li> Best way to scrub those hands after a day of seeing patients with who knows how many diseases.  Except for when the wife wants to use it for scrubbing potatoes.</li>
    <li> Been looking for this type of nail brush for my husband for quite some time.  He likes it just fine.  We have tried several other styles, but this particular style works the best for him.  I looked in many stores before it dawned on me to look on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I would have given this brush a 5 but it just fell apart in a week!  I just don&#x27;t have luck with plastic!</li>
    <li> The bristles immediately turned rust color where the one row of bristles ate</li>
    <li> Have owned this for about one year and it still works great!  Was looking for a heavy duty nail brush (we both get a lot of dirt and grease under our nails). This one is the best for the price.  Will definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> Great little nail brush.  Yes, you can buy cheaper that will do the job but this one does it just a little better.  Particularly like the short, stiff bristles on to top for getting under your nails and really scrubbing.  It&#x27;s actually holding up better than the cheaper ones so in the long run, it&#x27;s a good investment.  I&#x27;ll buy again, but I suspect it will be a longer time before I need to.</li>
    <li> I work with my hands, so by the end of the day my nails are very dirty. one side allows you to completely&lt;br /&gt;clean as much of the nails as possibles, the other side allows you to isolate fingers to target suborn dirt.&lt;br /&gt;Love it.</li>
    <li> I brought this for my aunt.  She works with the plants often.  It works very well.  I will have to get a second one for myself!</li>
    <li> My hard working hands need this brush so I can go out &amp;not be embarrassed</li>
    <li> Amazing lil doo-hickie.</li>
    <li> ..almost overnight--and just what I wanted because the original one had met a most violent death in the garbage disposal!</li>
    <li> This thing rocks. Feels good in your hands and nothing but nothing escapes the dual surface brushes. Minus one star for making it out of this hard plastic, which chipped when I dropped it in the shower. Otherwise, a fine instrument of cleanliness.</li>
    <li> Others have commented that the brush is a little soft, and it is, but that&#x27;s why you have the dual surfaces.  It took some getting used to the softer bristles, my old nail brush had a similar dual surface setup, but only once I started using this one did I realize that it didn&#x27;t need to be that firm and that my old one was beating up the skin at the tip of my fingers.      Overall this brush does a good job under the nails and the bristles are firm enough to scrub out grease and dirt from dry rough/calloused skin.  The only down side is that I go through about 3 of these a year, but they&#x27;re cheap enough imo.</li>
    <li> Best nail brush ever! smaller bristles allow you to clean thoroughly under nails. The small row of bristles are at just the precise angle to get any debris under your nails.</li>
    <li> I garden a lot and constantly get dirt under my fingernails. This is the best tool to get my nails clean.</li>
    <li> Love the nail brush.  Use the large side to softly wash my hands and nails.. the short side to get to the nitty gritty dirt.  Good product.</li>
    <li> it is made in such a way that i have trouble holding on to it. i keep dropping it when ever i use it.</li>
    <li> We purchased several of these brushes a few months ago to put in the kitchen and bathrooms.  Like one reviwer stated, it would be nice to have stiffer bristles, especially the single row side for under the nails.  What is nice is once you are done with the brush and put it down with the single row facing down, the brush is tilted and drains nicely.</li>
    <li> Price is right.  Quality is good.  Works well.    I liked the product well enough that I keep one in each bathroom, one in my shaving kit and have a spare.</li>
    <li> Within two months of owning this the bottom of all the bristles are getting rusty. It seems logical that you may store this in a place that is often wet like your shower or near the sink so I don&#x27;t know why they would use metal that would rust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that the design is nice and I like it but it seems like I should find one that doesn&#x27;t rust.</li>
    <li> Junk- After only 1 month of occasional use the fingernail bristles receded into the handle.  it is not unusable.  Find an alternative!!!</li>
    <li> Good product but cost way too much for what you get</li>
    <li> This is an awesome nail brush. I do art projects a lot and constantly get materials stuck underneath my nails. I just don&#x27;t feel clean until underneath my nails is clean. I like the hard but flexible bristles on this model. Nothing to complain about. The price is slightly higher than I&#x27;d like but it does the job perfectly and lasts a really long time! A really good buy!</li>
    <li> Stiff bristles good for dirt under nails. Separate row of shorter bristles in line on back of brush good for thumbs--gardening leads to dirty nails.</li>
    <li> Cleans my nails, cleans my toes, cleans my fingers so what else do you need?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s small and works great when I use it in the shower. Simple and cleans my grubby under nails quick and easy.</li>
    <li> I have several of these and keep ordering more.  Great product</li>
    <li> Bought two different brushes and this appears to be the best made of the two in terms of the quality of the brushes. But the test will be how long it lasts.  I now have one for the kitchen and one for the bathroom. I like the angle of the nail brushes on the back side.</li>
    <li> This is an efficient, sturdy nail brush that appear durable. The top side is perfectly shaped and sized to clean under fingernails. The bottom part is quite multipurpose. A plastic body means that it won&#x27;t swell or part like your typical wood nail brush.</li>
    <li> As a gardener my nails and hands get really dirty.  This brush really helps get them clean fast.  I really like this product!</li>
    <li> Great brush.  The extra, single line of bristles is really useful and a nice touch.</li>
    <li> This ones small profile makes it easier to pack for travel. but it is a little small and slippery, a bit difficult to keep in hand while soaped and scrubbing. It&#x27;s roundness makes it so. Old style scrub brushes with handles are easier to keep hold of.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, excellent service.</li>
    <li> This is my husband&#x27;s all-time favorite nail brush and he uses it daily.</li>
    <li> This guy works great.  As of late, I have a developed weird obsession with having clean nails and this does the trick. I also really like the area on top of the brush that allows you to get under the nails. I would recommend this totally.</li>
    <li> I have one of these brushes at every sink. It is just the right stiffness for cleaning hands and nails. The tiny bristles on the back are the key part - they REALLY get under the nails. I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with a product.</li>
    <li> After reading the numerous positive reviews I felt confident about buying this nail brush... that was a mistake.  The brush costs more than most other nail brushes, but I figured it must be worth it... considering the Tweezerman name and the reviews.  It is actually awkward to handle and the bristles are really soft and widely spaced... I dislike this Tweezerman nail brush more than any of the other nail brushes I have purchased.  I&#x27;m still looking.</li>
    <li> great durable nail brush</li>
    <li> Had a wooden one like this and used it until the wood broke and it feel apart.  Tweezerman is so well made!</li>
    <li> Between the stiffer bristles on top and the more flexible on the bottom, this unit does about as good a job as anything could do.</li>
    <li> The angled bristles on the top of this brush are perfect to clean under fingernails easily. It works as well on toddles as it does on adults.</li>
    <li> A great product for gardeners. About the only nail brush that gets the soil out from under my nails after a day digging in the dirt</li>
    <li> This item was not very expensive and serves its purpose, but I am disappointed that after only a few weeks there are already signs of rust around the bristles.  I will need to replace this with something else.</li>
    <li> Great product! It is what I expected. I would recommend it to others. Good product. Good product. Very good product</li>
    <li> Purchased these brushes for my daughter &amp; myself last year,the brushes are great getting the dirt off our hands &amp; from under our nails after gardening. Re-ordered this year as I wore out the original one. The price is good &amp; delivery quick.</li>
    <li> This product is a great way to keep those nails and hands clean especially when working in the garden. The grandkids find it a fun thing to use. My son is a mechanic who needs it badly. It worked well for him. I will be getting another one for them to take home. I just don&#x27;t know why it took so long for me to get one. I will never be without one again. It is also nice to look at on the bathroom sink very will designed.</li>
    <li> I have always preferred natural bristle nail brushes but they are a challenge to keep nice and clean, so thought after reading the reviews on Tweezerman(Really? What a name) I ordered it.   I have been using it a month or so and I really like it. The shape fits in my hand better, less fumbling and is gentle on the cuticles. It cleans up really nice.  I am giving it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> This handy little brush does a fine job on the nails and packs handily in the toilet kit.  Mine is the white model that is attractive in the medicine cabinet.  I like mine so much that I&#x27;ll order another one for the road.</li>
    <li> After 1 use, the brush fell apart into 2 pieces - Sorry that I trusted the brand name - wish there was a replacement for it - Very disappointed in Tweezerman</li>
    <li> Bought this to keep nails clean and it does the job as described.  Like Tweezerman quality</li>
    <li> gets the dirt out from gardening.  stays white somehow.  pretty easy to hold.  great product.</li>
    <li> I already have one - wanted another for a different floor of the house. Love the brushes on the back to get garden dirt from under my nails.</li>
    <li> Yikes! I love Tweezerman tweezers but this thing is total crap! The bristles are really hard and it&#x27;s just a useless device! Returned it!</li>
    <li> I love most Tweezerman products but not this brush. It is too soft and the bristles are not long enough to do a good job.</li>
    <li> My son is constantly playing in the yard and getting his nails super dirty.  Not to mention that my husband is a mess too with automobile repair, yard work, etc.  This nail brush really works and works quickly.  No complaints from anyone now if I ask them to use it.  We just keep one in each shower.</li>
    <li> it,s kinda pricey for what it does&lt;br /&gt;it does the job but not any better then a cheap brand nail brush&lt;br /&gt;so save your money and buy the next one</li>
    <li> This nail brush gets the underneath of my nails perfectly clean, in a couple of swipes. It&#x27;s easy enough to use that my 6-year-old can use it effectively. I&#x27;ve had it a year, and it has fallen on our tile floor and the casing has cracked a bit, but it&#x27;s still totally useable. Recommend.</li>
    <li> Does a great job, I use it every time I handled firewood to feed the fire, which necessarily soils my nails and under.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a nail brush that had a seperate row for under the nails.  I read some of the revews that others felt the bristels didn&#x27;t hold up but I&#x27;ve had mine for months now with no issues.  Works great!</li>
    <li> Very sturdy and cleans nails well. Love the two different style bristles!</li>
    <li> I have used many cleansing nail brushes over the years but this one is my favorite. Being in the medical field, hand washing is so very important.  This brush works extra well at cleaning under the nails and all over the hands.  When you have to cleanse your hands very frequently, this is great as it does its job well, yet is easy on the skin and cuticles.  Wonderful product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t often have time to write a review for a product, but after noticing that this product is still so highly rated, I feel compelled to warn future buyers. If you plan to allow this product to get wet, choose a different brush. It apparently has metal inside that will rust and turn the bristles orange after a few days of use. I clean my nails with a brush under running water, so this was problematic for me. If you clean your nails without using water, I guess this is the right choice for you.  It looks very nice and well made, and I was excited to use it, but the rust stained my bathroom tiles and smelled dreadful, so I sent it to the garage to clean other rusty things in lieu of trashing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line- Can you use it with water? No.&lt;br /&gt;Without water? Probably. (I wouldn&#x27;t know...)</li>
    <li> Replaced an old brush with this and have to say I&#x27;m impressed with how well it&#x27;s designed and manufactured.  Good price too.</li>
    <li> Product is great and arrived fast</li>
    <li> Serves its purpose well and looks attractive next to the sink.</li>
    <li> A nice compact nail brush with good nylon bristles. It gets the worst grime out from under nails and off of skin.</li>
    <li> I work a lot in my garden and use this brush daily.  The single row of bristles work perfectly under your nails.  I will be ordering another one for the kitchen.</li>
    <li> Good solid product. Not sure how long it&#x27;ll last but worth the bucks.</li>
    <li> The bristle arrangement and stiffness seem just right to me-about the same as a Fuller brush I have used for years, but unfortunately can&#x27;t find now.  The plastic grip is a bit slippery when wet and soapy.  If the brush had a handle I would rate it a 5.</li>
    <li> The nail bristles are perfect. Just stiff enough and thin enough to easily get in there and clean in there.</li>
    <li> What more can you say.  This type of product either works or doesn&#x27;t work.  It does the job!  I would recommend this to anyone who needs this product</li>
    <li> My daughter and I have horses and as everyone knows after scratching a horse a lot of dirt gets under the nails.&lt;br /&gt;I have found that the Tweezerman Dual Surface Nail Brush does a wonderful job cleaning the nails and hands.  They also last for a long time.  I keep one in the bathroom and one in the kitchen.  It easily removes garden dirt from the nails too.  The smooth oval shape fits nicely in the hand making it easy to use.  If you are worried about sanitation it can be dipped in bleach water with no harm done to the brush.  I would highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these from Amazon in 12011 for $3.60 (using Prime).  It is an excellent brush, and worth what I paid.  I just went to order another on and the price has gone up to $9.95!!  The brush is NOT worth that much.  I&#x27;ll have to look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Brush is very difficult to hold, slides out of your hand. a square or rectangular shape would make it much more user friendly.</li>
    <li> My favorite nail brush!</li>
    <li> I have used other Tweezerman products and assumed that this item would live up to their standards, but I was wrong.  I have used mine only once and after 3 months the base of every group of brushes shows signs of rust - not just a little rust but a lot.  I thought at first it might be some kind of mildew, but a wash with a bleach solution did nothing.  It is definitely rust.  If you like this rusty look in your shower, then this brush is for you.  I can&#x27;t imagine why any manufacturer would put together a brush meant to be used with water with anything that would rust.</li>
    <li> When I was growing up, my dad kept a wooden-handled nail brush next to the bathroom sink. I hated that brush because it hurt to use. The bristles were so rough!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, almost 30, I have my own nail brush and love it. The bristles are a lot softer on this one, or at least I think they are. Either way, this brush does it&#x27;s job just fine!</li>
    <li> This brush is just what I was looking for.  Works well for cleaning dirt from under nails when I have doing some project that I forgot to wear gloves for!</li>
    <li> The bristles are way too soft to do any effective and thorough cleaning so look elsewhere for a better product.</li>
    <li> Even though I purchased this item quite a while ago, I haven&#x27;t overly used it.  First the small brushes, supposedly used for getting under the nails, fell out.  OK - I continued to use just the brush part occassionally and the entire brush fell apart.  I would be happy to return this item so you can see for yourself.  But as for me, I have changed my mind about Tweezerman products.</li>
    <li> Awesome little brush. Cleans up my hands perfectly after working in the yard or on the car. I think anyone who loves working with their hands needs on of these little guys.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Keep it right by the sink and use it every day.  So far it has held up very well.</li>
    <li> Dropped this in the tub and a long narrow piece broke right off. This has caused the inside to turn black. Put in trash, because of the mold, or whatever was growing inside.</li>
    <li> While still probably the best brush, it has been redesigned so that the bristles are now much softer and less effective. Bring back the original!</li>
    <li> Seems to do the job.  The plastic is smooth and reminds me of a bar of soap.</li>
    <li> I really love that this brush has two sets of bristles.  The bristles on the top of the brush are angled and great for getting stubborn dirt out of my fingernails.  We do a lot of gardening so these brushes get a lot of use.  I will definitely purchase these again, great price and product.</li>
    <li> This is my second order for the nail brush.  It is a wonderful product to cleaning your nails and hands.  I paint a lot and seem to always get paint on my hands and especially around my nails.  The top of the brush is great for getting under the nails and the bottom of the brush to clean around the nails.  I also use the brush to clean the paint off of my skin, it isn&#x27;t all that rough and works well.  It is worth every cent I paid.  It is one of those products that should be in every home.</li>
    <li> Best nail brush ever used</li>
    <li> I do a lot of gardening, painting, and crafts.  This is the best fingernail and toenail brush I&#x27;ve ever used.  The row of thin bristles clean under the nails so easily.  Bristles not too hard or soft.  These are hard to find in stores.</li>
    <li> Looks nice, but fell apart already.  Kept it in the shower and the bristles fell out.  Maybe from moisture.  Stii, I expected it to last for more than a month.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I needed to get crud out from under my fingernails after working on cars (detailing, painting, etc.). I had a really high quality one years ago from a hospital that surgeons use and swore by it, but lost it at some point. The fingernail cleaner on top does a pretty decent job, but the bristles aren&#x27;t packed together super closely, and uses some kind of nylon that I don&#x27;t expect to last for years. Still, for the price, it does what it needs to do, and I can afford to replace it every year if need be.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband who works with his hands and comes home quite grimy.  Of course all of that grime sticks under his fingernails and leaves his hands most unsightly.  He previously had a wooden spa-type nail brush and that worked ok but the wood eventually split and became mildewy after many months exposed to water.  This one works great for him.  He commented at how the single row of bristles worked better under his nails than the wooden, boars hair brush had.  His hands look better too.  We would definitely recommend this brush.  Thanks, Tweezerman, all of your products are awesome!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good hand brush.  I especially like the way it tilts on its side to keep the bristles dry.&lt;br /&gt;The bristles could be more firm and it&#x27;s too slippery and awkward for the shower.&lt;br /&gt;I use it in the master bathroom sink and the white blends in nicely with the white porcelain.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these, was fine with the bristles, so I bought a couple more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I dropped one in the shower one day (It&#x27;s smooth, hollow plastic you know, and by definition it&#x27;s slick with soap when used). It hit the floor (a molded shower receptor), broke and came apart, leaving me with a brush having jagged plastic edges and a hard to see jagged piece of white plastic lying on the white shower floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be careful if you opt for one of these.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush on a whim, but I just ordered two more.  This is the best!  We garden, I often pull weeds bare handed and we have horses with dirt and dander that works into the nail bed even when you wear gloves.  This brush gets everything off, and not so you feel that you have lost a layer of skin.  Perfect product!  Buying more for other washing stations.</li>
    <li> I like this product for several months but then began showing rust at base of bristles.  I am getting a different product for my bathrooms today.....this will go in the scrub brush box for non human uses.</li>
    <li> I gotta say, this thing does wonders for cleaning up underneath nails.  I scratch my head a lot (dandruff), and my nails get filled with flakes, eugh!  This thing manages to clear it all up without me having to dig under em myself.</li>
    <li> I love this brush. It helps my hand washing to be really clean. I always wash my hands when I put on and take off my contact lenses, but I sometimes get eye infection. This brush really make sure that my hands are really clean. The bristle feel nice on the hands and does its job.</li>
    <li> This was a great addition to my manicure/pedicure toolkit.  I think every girl needs to have a nail brush especially a girl who is always getting dirty :-)</li>
    <li> These are great! The top row does a nice job of getting underneath fingernails. My husband keeps them in his hunting box.</li>
    <li> This brush is well made, simple, and doesn&#x27;t have any flaws to warrant dropping a star. Um... It&#x27;s a brush.</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT WORKS GREAT FOR CLEANING MY HANDS AND FINGERNAILS FROM DIRT AND DEBREE. THE BRISTLES ARE SOFT, BUT FIRM SO THAT ALL DIRT IS REMOVED FROM UNDER YOUR NAILS. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT. IT IS SO HELPFUL TO HAVE AND VERY HANDY-EASY TO HOLD AND MANEUVER.</li>
    <li> I like the design, the materials not so much. this fell a short distance in the tub and a piece broke off.</li>
    <li> I am a gardener and this has helped immensely with getting dirt from under nails.</li>
    <li> I am always looking for a good nail brush with the single row on the back and this one is one of the best.</li>
    <li> Well made, but Bristles are softer than desired.</li>
    <li> Wanted to have one on hand to make sure my hands were clean, the single row of brushes makes cleaning nails much better.</li>
    <li> I love this nail brush. The two different types of bristles work great to scrub under thumbnails and fingernails. The bristles do not get moldy or fall out - the latter was particularly important to me. It lasts a long time. I have ordered a second to replace the first that I used everyday for at least 18 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Will be keeping these in stock!</li>
    <li> It does the job, cleans nails. Not much more to say, as it&#x27;s a very simple product, for only one purpose</li>
    <li> Just as described, works great for dirt under nails.  Well worth the price and arrived quickly, nothing more to say</li>
    <li> This brush is okay, but I found the bristles to be too soft to be really effective for cleaning under my nails. It is a nice brush and does work to some degree, but it doesn&#x27;t completely clean under the nails.</li>
    <li> Received order as promise. It was package well. It was what I expected...will order again. I have used another product for a  years but when I tried this product I loved it. It is the best nail brush ever.</li>
    <li> A great adjunct to a keep-your-nails clean regime for a dig-in-the-dirt gardener like me.</li>
    <li> Aggressive, exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Second time buying this brush. I love clean nails and this helps.</li>
    <li> This brush is great and it&#x27;s the only brush that cleaned under my nails because of the row of bristles on the back. However, after a few weeks of use, it gets brown and yucky under each set of bristles. I looked around and found some that seem, by reviews, sturdier and are cheaper anyway, like the ones by Eppco. I hate it when manufacturers don&#x27;t take the time to create a product that will really last.</li>
    <li> These work pretty well.  I actually wish the bristles were a little firmer, so I&#x27;m knocking off a star for that.  Otherwise, they seem to get deep into the nooks and crannies of my hand creases and finger nails to remove all but the most stubborn grime.  Works much better than my former method of trying to scrape under my nails with my pocket knife.</li>
    <li> This scrubber is in white-which looks better on my sink~but does a Great job.&lt;br /&gt;So glad I found one I like &amp; cleans fine with the single strand of brushes as my work gets under my nalis each day...good job.</li>
    <li> This nail brush is durable and can get even the toughest amount of dirt and grease out from under your nails, but it is delicate as well. And doesn&#x27;t have hard bristols that will Hirt your hands and feel like you are ripping the skin off your fingers or your hands.</li>
    <li> Product as described. Only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is because it can be difficult to hold in certain positions, especially for my 7 year old. However, he finds a way and his fingernails end up clean - that is the point!</li>
    <li> First rate.  Does the best job.  Ill have it forever.</li>
    <li> The bristles are too soft.  I was hoping to be able to really scrub with this brush.  3 stars for the fact that it has held-up well thru several uses.</li>
    <li> I love this nail brush. Best I&#x27;ve ever had. Very lightweight &amp; well-made &amp; dries so fast after using. Will buy more.</li>
    <li> great for getting under nails.</li>
    <li> Perfect and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Much better than the dollar store 3 pack variety.  Bristles are still in great shape after a month + use</li>
    <li> Really gives you a thorough cleaning without much effort at all.  Bristles are perfect length and firmness, and set at just the right angle.  Buy it for life!</li>
    <li> The row of bristles on the top lost their stiffness and shape after about a month. Not worth the money.</li>
    <li> Loved it. The brush is just what I was looking for to replace a brush 50 yrs old brush.  I could use a couple more but the postage just isn&#x27;t worth it.  Had I know if I could have gotten a couple more for the same postage that would have been good.</li>
    <li> I really like this product for getting my nails clean. I paint and garden a lot so it is perfect for getting behind the nails.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that the bristles start getting rusty over time. I think whatever holds them in place behind the plastic is rusting.  The brush still performs as advertised but it just looks a little gross. They are cheap enough though that you just buy a few and discard when they get rusty.</li>
    <li> GREAT AT KEEPING TOENAILS AND FINGERNAILS CLEANED.  I LOVE THE PLASTIC. STAYS CLEAN UNLIKE THE WOODEN ONES. KEEP IT IN MY PURSE . WHEN I WEAR FLIP FLOPS SOMETIMES I WILL PICK UP SAND AND DIRT. SO I USE LIQUID HAND CLEANER AND JUST PUT MY NAIL BRUSH TO IT AND THEN MY FEET LOOK ALL CLEAN AND MANICURED!</li>
    <li> I bought three brands and this was my second favorite, but not by much.  It has good brissels and works well under my nails and in the cracks of my hands.  The Eppco Heavy Duty Two Sided Hand &amp; Nail Brush is slightly cheaper and more industrial and so I use it at my work sink.  I keep this one in the shower and my wife likes it too.</li>
    <li> This is the only nail brush that really gets underneath those nails and scrubs them clean.  I just love this brush</li>
    <li> Great for home and travel.</li>
    <li> I broke my other one.  This one hasn&#x27;t broken yet!</li>
    <li> The brushes bristles are a tad stiffer than need be (my personal opinion), but it does a good job of cleaning under my oft dirty fingernails.&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend this brush.</li>
