      <li>Many reviews note</li>
      <li>Please bring max back because we womon want the best.</li>
      <li>I love this color mascara.  </li>
      <li>I am a longtime user of Max Factor 2000 Calorie Mascara (in auburn) and have not been able to find it online for some time now.  </li>
      <li>I am so glad I can get it on-line.</li>
      <li>The color was a little light for me but will probably look good on someone whi is very fair.</li>
      <li>Great color, for a natural redhead.  </li>
      <li>The service was very quick.</li>
      <li>i got one, comfortable, coat</li>
      <li>only is the colour great</li>
      <li>Why is it that great products go away and never come back?</li>
      <li>Thankfully, it was available on Amazon</li>
      <li>This is the perfect colour, I usually use brown mascara</li>
      <li>i was going on vacation and thought i&#x27;d \\&quot;invest\\&quot; in my fav mascara for the color and special treatment.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Sometimes you can get more mascara with brush technique but there isn&#x27;t much in this product with which one can work.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s wearable, and when you want just enough to get noticed, but not so much of the raccoon look, this is great.</li>
      <li>I used it for over 20 years as Max Factor had an awesome auburn color that fits my face/hair color features that no other manufacturer ever came or comes close to as well as the thickness and volume that this mascara and great brush gives in just two coats that wears all day long at least 16 hours.</li>
      <li>but I like a more natural look.</li>
      <li>It did not have the same coverage, texture or feel I have experienced with the former one.</li>
      <li>It is exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>If you want something light and natural looking I&#x27;d recommend Ecco Bella brown mascara.</li>
      <li>Easy to apply, easy to remove, a natural color for those of us with red and/or auburn hair.  </li>
      <li>Its really flaky</li>
      <li>My eyes are a blue/green and the auburn shade really makes them pop.</li>
      <li>but I find that even though it says brown on the tube the product inside is more like brown/black, and with natural red hair...</li>
      <li>I never had a problem with any Max Factor products, always high quality at a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a redhead and this color looks more natural on me than black.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been springing for the much more expensive light brown mascaras (blinc kiss - medium brown, and Trish McEvoy Auburn).</li>
      <li>(very natural).</li>
      <li>This product was new, and as far as I could tell, never opened.  </li>
      <li>I anxiously awaited its delivery when it arrived, i was excited to try it!  </li>
      <li>it.id rather have black or a more common color in stores for cheap</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s dark enough to see, but also comes off easily.</li>
      <li>A product that I order frequently as I wear it daily.  </li>
      <li>how dry the mascara is, opened brand new.  </li>
      <li>i was excited to find this product currently available for purchase and shocked to see it for sale at $20.  </li>
      <li>way too much money for this its not worth</li>
      <li>However, how do you know when its too old if it starts out on the dry side?  </li>
      <li>I do not regret the purchase, and i HIGHLY recommend it to other folks of similar coloring.</li>
      <li>I know mascara can get dry once it is open and gets old.  </li>

<li> I know mascara can get dry once it is open and gets old.  </li>
<li> Loved the color but the mascara was dry and clumpy and almost impossible to apply.  </li>
<li> New in package, but dried up.</li>
<li> This is the ONLY COLOR mascara that a natural redhead can wear without it looking harsh!</li>
<li> It says on for a long time and looks natural.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> there was product in the in the bottle, but too dry to coat the wand.  </li>
<li> The tube is almost dry.  </li>
<li> It is so dry.  </li>
<li> Though my eyelashes are naturally black, with my natural hair color being red, now faded to white, I prefer the softer color of mascara than the harsh black, or even \\&quot;brownish black.\\&quot;    </li>
<li> Nonetheless, it is very dry</li>
<li> well it was a little dry but does enhance volume without being clumpy although being on the dry side</li>
<li> Unusable sadly due to its consistency that goes on in chunks.</li>
<li> I hope the price goes down</li>
<li> Not happy, especially at this price.</li>
<li> Max Factor discontinued their auburn mascara line, and the product is very difficult to find at a decent price (under $25).</li>
<li> So if your a redhead and needing something not so harsh looking then you need this mascara!</li>
<li> And it lengthens lashes but on me at least it was sort of clumpy and fake looking, very obvious that I was wearing mascara.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m a strawberry blonde, and mascara is a necessary evil for me, but I can&#x27;t wear the darker shades</li>
<li> took out of it origional package and opened the bottle, removed the wand to find it was dry!  :(</li>
<li> but it&#x27;s too expensive for the product to be that dry.  :(</li>
<li> I was a little disappointed in this mascara...</li>
<li> but it makes my eyes itchy and it clumps really bad and makes my lashes so hard they break...</li>
<li> I am a red-head, so there are not a lot of options in terms of mascara that doesn&#x27;t make me look scary.  </li>
<li> So imagine my disappointment when it came in the mail</li>
<li> and I was extremely sad and disappointed.</li>
<li> Too bad it is not sold in stores any longer.  </li>
<li> I was so disappointed when Walmart and Kmart stopped carrying Max Factor makeup.  </li>
<li> I have read that Max Factor is not making this product anymore , which is unfortunate !!</li>
<li> and I hate it when i end up looking like a raccoon.     </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love this color mascara.  Too bad it is not sold in stores any longer.  It is a bit too expensive online now, therefore, I have not purchased it in a while, although I need some more of it.  I hope the price goes down so I can get some more.  Thank you !!!</li>
    <li> Max factor Mascara is an excellent buy.  I am a red-head, so there are not a lot of options in terms of mascara that doesn&#x27;t make me look scary.  This mascara is the only brand I have found that carries a shade of red.  I love it.  I look great.  I feel great.  Max Factor Auburn Mascara is great! This product has been discontinued in all retail stores I have checked so I was glad to find it online.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> This product is the only mascara I use and have used for years.  It is perfect for redheads.  I was so disappointed when Walmart and Kmart stopped carrying Max Factor makeup.  I am so glad I can get it on-line.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for this mascara for some time now. I am a redhead and this is the perfect mascara for redheads.  So imagine my disappointment when it came in the mail and I went to apply it to my eyelashes.  It is so dry.  I know mascara can get dry once it is open and gets old.  This product was new, and as far as I could tell, never opened.  Nonetheless, it is very dry and I was extremely sad and disappointed.</li>
    <li> My eyes are a blue/green and the auburn shade really makes them pop. Love it!</li>
    <li> Max Factor discontinued their auburn mascara line, and the product is very difficult to find at a decent price (under $25). Thankfully, it was available on Amazon and I purchased the last two units for under $10 for both.</li>
    <li> I was a little disappointed in this mascara...color-wise its perfect, I love the auburn and it&#x27;s perfect for people with red hair. But I don&#x27;t like the formula at all. Its really flaky and I felt like it was drying my eyes out. And it lengthens lashes but on me at least it was sort of clumpy and fake looking, very obvious that I was wearing mascara. Maybe its just me but I like a more natural look. If you want something light and natural looking I&#x27;d recommend Ecco Bella brown mascara.</li>
    <li> I had used this product for several years until a couple of years ago when it had disappeared from the shelves in the cosmetic aisles of all of our local stores.  I was impressed to check for the product online, and so pleased when I found it, and they still have the color, Auburn, that I like. Though my eyelashes are naturally black, with my natural hair color being red, now faded to white, I prefer the softer color of mascara than the harsh black, or even \\&quot;brownish black.\\&quot;    The service was very quick.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been springing for the much more expensive light brown mascaras (blinc kiss - medium brown, and Trish McEvoy Auburn).

I do not regret the purchase, and i HIGHLY recommend it to other folks of similar coloring. Great price, no smudges, and great color (very natural).</li>
    <li> I am so glad i found a way to get my favorite mascara best color ever for a natural redhead</li>
    <li> The color was a little light for me but will probably look good on someone whi is very fair. Despite the name: no volume whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes you can get more mascara with brush technique but there isn&#x27;t much in this product with which one can work.</li>
    <li> A product that I order frequently as I wear it daily.  Easy to apply, easy to remove, a natural color for those of us with red and/or auburn hair.  Am looking for replacements as it is just become too overpriced for the every day application.</li>
    <li> Loved the color but the mascara was dry and clumpy and almost impossible to apply.  Maybe it was  just &amp;#34;dried out and old&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I just love max factor,I have been using max for years,and I am sorry they no longer have max factor on the shelves of our stores anymore.Please bring max back because we womon want the best.</li>
    <li> The color is great but costs a lot.  Many reviews note how dry the mascara is, opened brand new.  I love the color, lasts most of the day and comes off with soap and water.  However, how do you know when its too old if it starts out on the dry side?  I&#x27;m still looking for this color in a better mascara.</li>
    <li> I use this on my eyebrows as they are getting gray.  It says on for a long time and looks natural.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t stand eyebrows that look like they are painted on.</li>
    <li> I love this color!  Can&#x27;t find it anywhere else.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect colour, I usually use brown mascara but I find that even though it says brown on the tube the product inside is more like brown/black, and with natural red hair...no thank you!&lt;br /&gt;Not only is the colour great it goes on well and gives you lots of length. 5* Mascara, well worth shipping to the UK... :D</li>
    <li> I have always liked Max Factor mascara through out the years , age 58 !! Periodically I have had difficulty finding it in any color  !!?? I&#x27; am a redhead &amp; the color auburn is excellent for me &amp; I believe it would be for any redhead or strawberry blond !! I have read that Max Factor is not making this product anymore , which is unfortunate !! This product works well it was a little dry but does enhance volume without being clumpy although being on the dry side it did not flake !!??   I will purchase &amp; use until I can no longer find this product !! Max Factor&#x27;s # 1 5-star quality has always been the applicator brush that I appreciate !! Their mascara formula is the best for me !!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> ive been waiting for a company to come up with this color since max factor went under-  i was excited to find this product currently available for purchase and shocked to see it for sale at $20.  i was going on vacation and thought i&#x27;d \\&quot;invest\\&quot; in my fav mascara for the color and special treatment.  I anxiously awaited its delivery when it arrived, i was excited to try it!  took out of it origional package and opened the bottle, removed the wand to find it was dry!  :( there was product in the in the bottle, but too dry to coat the wand.  i got one, comfortable, coat on-  but it&#x27;s too expensive for the product to be that dry.  :(</li>
    <li> I like the color but it makes my eyes itchy and it clumps really bad and makes my lashes so hard they break...way too much money for this its not worth it.id rather have black or a more common color in stores for cheap they don&#x27;t hurt my lashes or make them fall out.</li>
    <li> This is probably the best brown mascara I&#x27;ve tried. It&#x27;s dark enough to see, but also comes off easily. It&#x27;s wearable, and when you want just enough to get noticed, but not so much of the raccoon look, this is great.</li>
    <li> The tube is almost dry.  There wasn&#x27;t enough liquid so I had to add water!  They are supposed to last longer than one month.</li>
    <li> If Max Factor would please start selling back here in the US! This is the ONLY COLOR mascara that a natural redhead can wear without it looking harsh!</li>
    <li> I wish Max Factor product line would have lived on by another owner. I used it for over 20 years as Max Factor had an awesome auburn color that fits my face/hair color features that no other manufacturer ever came or comes close to as well as the thickness and volume that this mascara and great brush gives in just two coats that wears all day long at least 16 hours. I never had a problem with any Max Factor products, always high quality at a reasonable price. Why is it that great products go away and never come back?</li>
    <li> Best product and cost for red heads!</li>
    <li> Great color, for a natural redhead.  Unusable sadly due to its consistency that goes on in chunks. Wish there was a product for this niche.</li>
    <li> Although this may be a great product for someone else, it didn&#x27;t meet my expectations.  I am a longtime user of Max Factor 2000 Calorie Mascara (in auburn) and have not been able to find it online for some time now.  So I gave this mascara a try.  It did not have the same coverage, texture or feel I have experienced with the former one. Seller was great with delivery and I had no issues with the purchasing process, just the product itself.</li>
    <li> Love the color! will be purchasing again! I&#x27;m a redhead and this color looks more natural on me than black. So if your a redhead and needing something not so harsh looking then you need this mascara!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for this color. It is exactly what I wanted. New in package, but dried up. Not happy, especially at this price.</li>
