      <li>It&#x27;s fine if you leave the charger plugged into the wall.</li>

      <li>trimmer works great, especially the T-trimmer.</li>
      <li>Fairly easy to clean.</li>
      <li>The unit is surprisingly light.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My Wahl hair cutting kit has worked for me for 11 years now. I was the resident barber throughout my college years, so it has seen heavy use for most of that time. Still works great. My Wahl Peanut just broke after 10 years of heavy use. So I bought this after reading all of these great reviews. However...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I cared most about was if facial hair gets pulled. And the answer: YES. A LOT. Maybe if you have peach fuzz on your face this would work for you. But I have dark, coarse facial hair. Each of the 3 short beard trimming attachments pulled my hair, badly. Very uncomfortable. Horrible design flaw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer works great, especially the T-trimmer. If you have sensitive skin like me and get razor bumps on your neck, the trimmer and/or T-trimmer cut very close. But if you care about trimming with attachments, don&#x27;t get this because it will pull your hair. I deplore that feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, I didn&#x27;t like how slick/slippery/cheap the trimmer itself felt in my hand. The plastic makes it feel so cheap, and the charger that plugs into the bottom barely stays put. I&#x27;m going to buy another Peanut.</li>
    <li> It pretty much does what it says.  It could have a more sturdy carrying or holding case.  The blades pop on and off.  I am not sure how they will hold up after having been used over time.  Like I said, it is okay.  I cannot recommend anything better.  I would use this for facial hair.  The blade is kinda small.  A wider blade would be more effective for cutting head and below the neck hair.</li>
    <li> I decided to buy this product based upon the lithium ion battery. I&#x27;m tired of the cheap beard trimmers that die after only a few years of use once their cheap rechargeable batteries stop holding a charge.    This trimmer seems good so far. The shaving head is less wide them my previous trimmer. This makes trimming slow but has the potential to be more accurate.    The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is the poorly labelled plastic attachments. There was no easy way to tell which ones cut short, medium, or long that I could tell. They should be clearly and permanently labelled.</li>
    <li> I bought this trimmer because the pop up trimmer in my Philips doesn&#x27;t work some times. it gave my like 18 months of running before the pop up trimmer start going out gradually. I change Philips trimmer many times but I&#x27;m satisfied with its results. this time I could not find the same model any more and the models available from Philips with a pop up trimmers feels worst in your hand it is very cheap plastic so I HAD to look for something else.    This one is really over rated by the reviewers in the Internet and here are the issues I find with it, some are known to me before and I was willing to live with it like the number of attachments:    1. the blade is short, although it is good to move over your face but the wider is better.  2. not made in USA, it is made in China and assembled in USA.  3. the attachments are flimsy and not fits right in the blade.  4. the base is total wast, you will need a small bag to keep it.  5. it doesn&#x27;t pull the hire BUT you have to go over the same area a LOT to do your face. It takes me two time or three times the time I normally need to do my face with Philips.  6. the number 1 and 2 of the beard attachments is useful but the rest are not.  7. I thought I could use the nose trimmer to do the lines and clean ups put it&#x27;s only good for the nose. more over the rotating trimmer for the nose is far better.  8. it trims my head with the wide blade better the beard blade on my beard.  9. the shaver works put not useful or I may say easy to use in on your face, it is very wide and hard to get a precise lines.    currently, I&#x27;m using my old trimmer and I&#x27;m shopping for a new one. I think i will try Remington this time.</li>
    <li> I grew a beard - well actually a goatee - last year. At my great age it&#x27;s important to look neat and well groomed. Otherwise you look like an old bum and you are in danger of strangers on the street giving you a handout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So now I use three attachments every other day to trim my goatee. This little machine works very well. The incredible thing is that after I charged it up for the first time ten months ago, I&#x27;ve never had to charge it again. The battery seems to run it forever.</li>
    <li> When i tried this trimmer out for the first few weeks I realized that it is worth far more than the actual selling price. For starters it has a powerful motor along with decent cutting blade attachments. The charge time and battery performance is decent for multiple uses. I appreciate the size and many configuration in which I can adjust the shaver heads to fulfill my desired look. Overall this trimmer is outstanding and I recommend it to anyone who wants a bargain with excellent results.&lt;br /&gt;Of course with every quality shaver/trimmer device you must clean the blades with a brush. Don&#x27;t rinse the blades with water because it will rust. Lightly lubricate the blades before use and after brushed cleanings and store it in a dry area. This trimmer will give you your monies worth for a long time.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome trimmer.  I&#x27;ve used Remington and Philips norelco trimmers before and they don&#x27;t come close to comparing to the precision and power of this one.  Only flaw I have found is the adjustable head attachment does not work very well.  It is very hard to change the setting on it and it falls off very easily when it is on.  This is a small inconvenience for me as the other attachments work for the length I keep my hair/beard.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gone through about 5 trimmers in the past 5 years, and any of them that I have purchased that were made in China did not last long at all.  I decided that hell or high water, I was going to find a trimmer made in the USA.  WAHL makes there products here and you can tell the difference in materials and quality.  This is a well designed item that I suspect will last me a long long time.</li>
    <li> Great product. Great price. Does everything it says it does and more, and does it beautifully well.</li>
    <li> Update 8-30-2011. After less than three dozen uses, the blade stopped cutting.  I bought new blades but now the battery will not keep a charge.    Update 05-16-11. The clipper blade, claimed to be self-sharpening, apparently isn&#x27;t.  It went dull after about 20 small uses. I reordered two more from Wahl On-line Store, as there seems to be no fix for the poor performance other than new ones. It comes with multiple ground blades and adapters for flexability of use, but I deem them useless when the unit won&#x27;t function.  Beware to learn how to properly manage Lithium batteries that this unit has. All Lithium batteries will last a long time if properly cycled (usually about 1000 cycles - but not this one). I bought a book to learn about batteries and appreciate the greater power delivery and longevity of Lithium batteries. Not pleased with this purchase.    Used this trimmer for my dog&#x27;s sensitive areas.  Initially performed well and the battery charge was long-lasting, but that only lasted about 12 months.  The charger is 4.2 VDC and almost impossible to replace, so DO NOT LOSE it. The clipper references a specific charger model but Wahl doesn&#x27;t sell any parts, so you can&#x27;t get a replacement charger or battery.  At least I haven&#x27;t located one.    I do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever owned. If your considering buying this product, do it. You wont be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great little trimmer,powerful and does what it should. The only downside there might be is the tray. Not very practical,because there is a lot of attachments, and the tray is kinda flimsy. I just store mine in a small box, problem solved...Besides that, it is well worth the money.</li>
    <li> The trimmer is small, but very well made.  It has lots of optional cutters and pieces, charges well, and holds the charge for weeks.  If you need to trim your beard (or even your hair) this is a good choice.</li>
    <li> I love the power of this little trimmer. Lasts a long time between charges which was the primary reason I bought it. I wanted the lithium-ion batteries and I am not disappointed. The only negative thing I have to say about this product is that I would not recommend it for shaving, only trimming. The shaving attachment is narrow, so it takes a while to shave. Even then it does a poor job... keep the razor handy to finish what the shaver will not do.</li>
    <li> My trimmer seems to have completely died and won&#x27;t recharge. It&#x27;s dead. I only used it maybe once a week, and quite often would go 2-3 weeks without using it. I did brush it after each usage and oiled the blade a few times. But it didn&#x27;t even last a full year before dying.    Wahl&#x27;s limited five year warranty apparently requires me to mail the item to them along with a check for $6.50 and they will repair or replace (their discretion) the item. So it will cost at least $10 to take care of this. Not very happy. I could have paid less than half what I paid for this and gotten a cheapo trimmer that would have lasted 10 months.</li>
    <li> Razor worked great initially.  After six months of very little use, the power cord inside of the razor unit pushed up into the razor itself making it impossible to connect to the charger.  Razor is now useless with no way to charge it and I can&#x27;t get a refund or replacement.</li>
    <li> This is the best beard trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used.  It doesn&#x27;t pull. It trims close.  It hold a charge forever.  It&#x27;s the BEST.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is very good. It&#x27;s got a good, strong motor and zips through my beard. I can&#x27;t really complain, but the stand is pretty thin plastic and the charger is NOT built in as is the case with another brand I owned previously. But that aside, again,  it&#x27;s a very good trimmer. I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> Up sides:  It came at an excellent price, has a good solid heft to it, and appears well constructed. Most importantly, it gives a clean and comfortable trim. I was very impressed with the quality compared to the price point.    Down side:  The tray it comes with for supposedly holding all the attachments is nigh useless. There&#x27;s no way you could fit all of the attachments in there and actually use them without knocking them over all the time. It&#x27;s certainly not enough to dock a star though.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t charged it yet.. still going strong out of the box!!  Works well, and I like all the included attachments.  Only thing I see that could be improved is the quality of the combs so they fit/snap on and off more securely.  They aren&#x27;t bad, just could be a bit better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many a trimmer before. Either the trimmer pulls hair, doesn&#x27;t cut at all or the battery sucks and doesn&#x27;t hold a charge. This Wahl set trims pretty close and never pulls the hair...I&#x27;ve only had it for a few months now so I cannot speak to the longevity of the battery, but I use it regularly and have only had to recharge once in three months.  Great job with this one!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll use all the attachments that came with it but who knows.  Didn&#x27;t think the shaver worked as well as a Norelco three head but didn&#x27;t expect to use it in the first place.  Definately need to read the directions closely before first use. Trimed my beard way to close but I should have know better. My old Wall beard trimmer was returned a couple times for refurbishing at only fifteen dollors. So if this one is the same I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a great bargain.</li>
    <li> This is the best trimmer I have ever bought.  It has great power and the first charge has lasted over a month with using it three times a week to trim my full beard.  I recommend this trimmer to anyone who wants a powerful and well working cordless trimmer.</li>
    <li> Very nice set for trimming a beard.  I like the entire set and would definitely recommend it to others.  The adjustable clip is a little bit hard to move, but it is good that it stays in place while trimming.</li>
    <li> I replaced my aging Connor beard trimmer with the new Lithium Ion All-In-One Trimmer. The unit is very powerfull with a very long lasting battery. My disappointment was in the attachments and their ability to do their jobs. I found my old Connor did a better job of trimming my beard to length. Most of the attachments are useless.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item because I cut my son and my hair. My last cordless clippers was Ni-cad and the battery faltered. So this was my reason for buying this product with a lithium ion battery. The unit is surprisingly light. It charged quickly and went to work right away. It has a quick release head to easily switch between adapters. The only thing I wish it had come with is a close able case. It comes with only a tray. I used my sons old pencil/pen container, and bought him a new one for school.</li>
    <li> This is a terrific product. It has plenty of power and a long lasting battery.</li>
    <li> This is the second or third Wahl trimmer I&#x27;ve owned, great handy trimmers, I&#x27;ve had the last one for about 10 yrs, would no longer hold a charge for very long, a battery was ten dollars so I opted for a new one, alot more attachments, nice trimmer, hope it lasts as long as the last one.</li>
    <li> I have owned a few Wahl trimmers over the years, this being the most recent one, bought about 2 years ago.  A consistent problem with all of them has been battery life.  Within the first few months, the operating time between charges got shorter and shorter.  After a couple of years when the trimmer would not operate long enough after a full charge to trim my beard in one shot, it got replaced.  I thought that this model would not have that problem, having a more robust lithium ion battery, but it does.  There has been no improvement.      I also find that as the trimmer ages, it does not have full power anymore. It seems to run slower than it did when it was new and as a result it tends to pull rather than cut, which is not very comfortable. Keeping the cutting head clean and oiled helps to some extent, but when the battery doesn&#x27;t give 100% there&#x27;s not much else you can do.    I am looking for another trimmer. I don&#x27;t mind getting another Wahl but I think I&#x27;ll stay away from a rechargeable model.</li>
    <li> When I received these clippers, I was replacing a Norelco that was a workhorse...I had had the thing for at least 13 years and it was just not keeping a charge long enough to trim my beard...but still, a great product. For those at Wahl, less is more, keep it simple. These clippers came with WAY too many attachments, most of which are useless for me. Changing the heads, changing the blade guards...not smoothly done...you will fumble with these things. The adjustable \\&quot;beard trimmer\\&quot; guard is awkward and hasn&#x27;t worked once for me (I&#x27;d lose that one or improve it, Wahl). The ear/nose hair trimmer, works great for trimming my lip line on beard but the shape isn&#x27;t really the best for your nose and when using it for ear hair, you will practically deafen yourself. I have nicked myself with the standard blade on more than one occasion but I think that could happen with many trimmers.    I&#x27;ve had facial hair my entire adult life (hey, we like what we like)...I know Wahl makes some really great products (I have friends who love them) but if I had to do it again, I would pass on this one. I wish I had taken advantage of the 30-day money back guarantee but I had too much happening in my life to pull it together at the time I purchased this. So, if I had to do it again, I would probably get another Norelco like I had...I might even do it and keep this Wahl as a back up.</li>
    <li> it works very good i love it totally, very nice product all items are new witout details, i recomended to buy these, im so happy to adquire it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had it 1 day, and I&#x27;m absolutely in love with this trimmer/shaver.  Following the instructions, you must charge it for 1 hour before it&#x27;s first use.  Battery seems to last forever with no loss of power. For such a light-weight trimmer, you can feel the power of it&#x27;s motor, very comparable to their much heavier plug-in models. Blades are very high quality, love the screen shaver attachment.  The rotating head gives you better/more comfortable angles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s perfect for those who keep cropped hair cuts and beards. I have both!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative I can think of is the storage tray.  Doesn&#x27;t quite fit all the attachments as it should.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is excellent and comes with a nice assortment of attachments. Lots of power and fairly quiet as well. My only issue with it is that the tray that they send to store all the stuff in is really cheap and does not actually hold all the stuff. Plus, it falls over all the time so it is best to put the attachments in the drawer and throw the tray in the garbage.</li>
    <li> Works like it should. Lots of different blade sizes to accommodate just about any type of use. Fairly easy to clean. Excellent battery life.</li>
    <li> The attachments that determine the closeness of the trim will slip to the side of the trimmer head and actually fall off. I have resorted to securing the attachment with a rubber band that was not included with the other attachments</li>
    <li> Very good product.  I was new to the world of beards and grooming them.  It&#x27;s a quality unit. I took away a star because of the poor manual.  In retrospect, the unit and all the adapters are easy to use. However, if you are new to this, this units with all the pieces seemed like a complicated jigsaw puzzle. I had to search the internet for video clips on how to best use it. If you are maintaing a short beard (the 5pm shadow) then you don&#x27;t need anything as robost as this unit.  I&#x27;m only using the 1 beard guard to keep it as short as possible.  Nevertheless, the unit is quality and sterdy.  It&#x27;s been a week since I last charged it and its still going.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Its very smooth  worth its value. Saved me a few trips to the barbor Great product. Many pieces for many styles</li>
    <li> I have had either a beard or goatee for the last 28 years, and for most of this time I owned a Wahl trimmer. My first Wahl lasted 10 years, my second Wahl lasted for 8 years. I took a 3 year break using a Norelco (which was a Christmas gift), however, I was never satisfied with the cut at longer settings. I ultimately went back to various Wahl trimmers, yet they all gave out (battery, motor, etc) in less than 2 years.    Deciding to give Wahl one last chance. I purchased the \\&quot;All-in-One Trimmer Kit,\\&quot; given that it had a 5-year warranty. The battery quit recharging after the 3rd month, and Wahl&#x27;s position was since I failed to keep my receipt, there was no warranty coverage. Please note that my failure to keep the receipt was definitely my fault. However, I can say, through personal experience, that Wahl&#x27;s quality and performance has SIGNIFICANTLY declined over the years (based on my last four purchases), and this was the last Wahl trimmer that I will ever own. If you cannot purchase any other trimmer but a Wahl, my advice is that you hold fast to your receipt...because I fear you will need it sooner rather than later. If any other option is available to you, I would strongly urge you to consider it, rather than purchasing a Wahl.</li>
    <li> The number of parts is not as they mention have been buying the product and it turned out incorrectly and missing parts represent me important thing where I have not benefited from the shipment and lost all the amount due to the lack of my use of the product 3 main parts is missing and has to send them and been attributed only $ 7 and this has increased the frustration</li>
    <li> Great trimmer. Very happy overall. Just don&#x27;t leave the charger plugged into the trimmer without it plugged into the wall. Will drain the battery. It&#x27;s fine if you leave the charger plugged into the wall. Just don&#x27;t leave the charger plugged into the trimmer if it&#x27;s not plugged into the wall.</li>
    <li> Excelente afeitadora para todos los gustos, da nivel, corta al raz, te permite realizar un sin numero de particularidades, facil de limpiar y su cabeza giratoria de 360 grados te permite llegar a zonas donde antes no era tan sencillo!</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my husband... he needed a trimmer with more attachments and a longer battery life. This definitely has it! The battery lasts a long time on a full charge and there is a attachment for almost anything you can think of. This made a great gift for him!</li>
    <li> I replaced my old Wahl nicd unit with this one.  What an improvement.  It stays charged and is always ready to go.  The torque is better and the tool works much more effectively.  Definitely worth the price.</li>
    <li> Great for your face,  Not so great for your more tender areas.  Too difficult to stretch skin snooth enough to get smooth shave rather than pulling the hair.  Ouch!</li>
    <li> Battery stopped holding charge barely a month after the one year warranty expired. I used this clipper maybe a dozen times. Ok. I called Wahl and they repaired the razor free of charge and had it back to me in about 3 weeks. Very good customer service. There are a couple things about this product that annoy me however. There is not a battery indicator on this to say when it&#x27;s charged or charging. And the blades sometimes cut me, it&#x27;s not a smooth shave at all. But it does work if I&#x27;m very careful.</li>
    <li> This is the third electric razor I have tried to use to keep my beard trimmed.&lt;br /&gt;It does not pull at all- the first razor I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t!  Works great, has lots of height options and provides a nice even trim.  Without this razor I would give up on growing any facial hair.</li>
    <li> I owned one of these for about 4-5 years before the battery died (to be expected of a battery that age) and it was decent enough for the price, but you should certainly buy something else at this point in time. This model is no longer in production and third party sellers are now selling it for TWICE what I paid at Target in 2009. If you&#x27;re lazily shopping by price, you might be tricked into thinking this is one of Wahl&#x27;s better trimmers but it&#x27;s actually a budget model. The Wahl 9818 is cheaper and superior in every way - made in USA, stainless steel body, stainless steel blades. This model will rust and pull your hair.</li>
    <li> This is by far the worst trimmer I have ever used. The most positive thing I can say is the battery is long lasting. I don&#x27;t use a trimmer that often, mostly just to keep my facial hair trimmed and tidy. After about a year the small trimmer attachment started pulling and tugging. It was not pleasant. I looked at the attachment and discovered one of the arms which makes the trimmer move back and forth had popped out of place. So, with a little pair of pliers I got it back in place. But, it has never been the same. I get a very uneven trim, and end up getting out scissors and a dry razor to get a smooth look. I doubt I will ever try a Wahl product again. After two years, I am looking once again for a good trimmer. That seems unacceptable to me.</li>
    <li> Works well, but ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, the teeth on the general cutting head seem to break off and become sharp.  This is a replacement for my first one.  Would like to buy parts, not another whole raiser</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product.  I use the trimmer about once a week and almost never have to charge it.  It seems these batteries last forever.  Shipped and received very quickly.</li>
    <li> I had a Wahl trimmer for many years and it was time to replace it. This model is very similar to the one I had, and it works just as well. I highly recommend these Wahl trimmers; they work well and last a long time.</li>
    <li> This thing will trim anything you want it to. Several size heads from tiny to extra wide and the lithium battery lasts for months on one charge.</li>
    <li> Previous trimmers my husband have used over the years ran through a charge very quickly, but this one holds a charge fantastically.  My husband has used his for a year and it has not slowed down.  He uses it 40 minutes on average, about once a week.</li>
