<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I already have one of these and my daughter sneaked it into her college packing so now I need one for me :)  Works great.  Be careful as it gets really hot. You don&#x27;t need to have it on 10!  Start at 5 and work your way up.  I use it as a straightener believe it or not. I have curly hair but HATE pin straight hair (the straighteners make my hair TOO flat).  Works like a charm and you can keep a controlled curl in your hair.</li>
    <li> I love it.  The heat settings really help.</li>
    <li> Decent price decent item.</li>
    <li> I am so thrilled that I found these on Amazon! I ordered 3 Hot Tools, saved a bundle &amp; they were at my door in no time!!</li>
    <li> Good product.  It is definitely a large barrel and I think a smaller one would perform as well if you are unsure.  Use caution as it heats up extremely well and fast.</li>
    <li> I received my curling iron in the time indicated.  I use it regularly, without any problems.  I would definitely purchase from this seller again!</li>
    <li> Curling irons and I do not have a positive history. Even if I somehow manage to avoid dropping them, at some point they just tend to stop getting hot. NOT a desirable trait in a curling iron. And then there&#x27;s the size thing. For some reason I can find 1 1/4\\&quot; ones locally, but not 1 1/2.\\&quot; Since I use mine more to smooth frizzies and do a slight flip, not to curl, I toyed with the 2\\&quot; irons...but after reading the reviews (\\&quot;heavy, awkward to use\\&quot;) I downsized. The 1 1/2 is not only the perfect size, but the Hot Tools iron is a solid piece of equipment. It just FEELS well-made. It has a jillion heat settings but I keep it on the high end of medium (my hair is thick) and it&#x27;s perfect. Heats fast, holds the heat, and unlike cheapo irons that I have to set on high from the outset, this one leaves me room to adjust should it start \\&quot;cooling\\&quot; in the future. Would unquestionably buy again, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll need to for a while!</li>
    <li> very happy with this iron and fast delivery</li>
    <li> I received this curling iron and used it 4-5 times max and it totally went dead. It would not heat up after that.  I returned it using&lt;br /&gt;their return label and instructions perfectly. They told me they never received it. I would never order anything from them again. The quality is obviously &#x27;poor&#x27; and their customer service even poorer.  Waste of money and completely disappointed.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product in march of 2014 and let me tell you this curling iron gets extremly hot even on the low settings (350°) and after I ran the curling iron through my hair it left little indentations in my hair exactly where the curling iron touched my hair. Ok at first I was just going to ship the curling iron back but after awhile I just learned to get use to it doing it. Then the worst possible thing that could have happened, happened....My curling iron completly stopped working! At first I thought I did something wrong when I plugged it in the wall but as I carefully examined the curling irons I noticed that the red light came on but the curling irons were not heating up! I only had this curling iron for eight months and now I have to throw it away. Grrrrrr now I totally wish I would have shipped them back the very first week I bought them.</li>
    <li> The product was in excellent condition, purchased for a christmas gift for my granddaughter, she was very happy with the gift, shipping was fast. Thank you</li>
    <li> I bought this curling iron because I read Kim Kardashian uses on her hair and I love her hair plus I saw so many hair tutorials on utube of females that used it and their hair came out good as well. I love this curling iron cause I have naturally curly very long hair and when I straighten my hair and try to curl it with a regular curling iron the curls won&#x27;t take in my hair or they won&#x27;t stay but with the Hot tools 1.5 I get nice curls that actually stay in my hair. Also the fact that I can control the settings is a plus!! The price on here was great cause at a hair store by my house they want like $60 - $90 depending on which size you buy!!!</li>
    <li> This is a great iron, it heats quickly and has many settings for different hair types. I&#x27;ve only used it a few times and so far it hasn&#x27;t been disappointing. My curls last all day, my hair is just below shoulder length so I mostly use it on my ends or for some body at the crown of my head, like I said, it works great!</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this curling iron!!!</li>
    <li> Shipping was quick! Love this iron. Bought the same one I had before that lasted me 5 years!</li>
    <li> bought this for my sister because she has really thick, long hair. She loves it. This is the only one she uses and her curls always look beautiful</li>
    <li> I read a review of this curling iron (not on Amazon) about how well this curling iron worked. Once I got the curling iron at home, I loved it. It gave me waving curls and worked great when I wanted a straight, sleek look. This curling iron lasted for over three years. When the curling iron started to not keep heat, I figured I was do for a new curling iron. Bought a curling iron (different brand) at Target for around the same price and it hasn&#x27;t even lasted three months. So, now I&#x27;m back to buying this curling iron, which I&#x27;m sure won&#x27;t let me down.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for AND came with extra springs</li>
    <li> I love the look of this curling iron. I havent tried it on my hairl but will leave another review.</li>
    <li> I bought this a few weeks ago, and while using it something went wrong, it overheated and burned my hair off--completely MELTED my hair while on a medium setting! Obviously a defective product was sold to me. Buyer beware.</li>
    <li> I previously shared a hot tools curling iron with my mom, but figured i needed to buy one for myself when I moved out. This barrel was a bit larger, which I wanted for looser curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not very skilled at curling hair, which is why i love this product. I dont know why, but I&#x27;ve found it to be much more user friendly than other curling irons. It heats up fast, just one less thing too worry about when getting ready. Curls hold in my hair, which has previously been an issue. Great product for the price! Would recommend!</li>
    <li> Love this Hot Tools 1 1/2&amp;#34; gold curling iron. Has an adjustment heat that works perfectly for any hair type.</li>
    <li> Super curls and bounce.</li>
    <li> I received my Hot Tools. this is quite a big one, and for those who what big loose curls, then this is great! It is on the heavy side...but i am one of those who likes that aspect of it because it makes the curler seem more expensive. I feel like I should have paid at least 50 for this curler, but only paid $18 for it! you can&#x27;t beat the awesome price here! It has a heating setting and an off on setting. I really like it!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s ok... It takes a while for it to curl my hair though...</li>
    <li> Love how the hot tools curls hair. But they have a &#x27;spring&#x27; problem and this brand new one is already making the squeaking noise that my older curling iron started to make after several years.  Disappointing. Fortunately, an extra spring comes in the box, but how long will that last and then the possibility of buying a new curing iron.  Fortunately purchasing at Amazon saved me money compared to retail stores that also carry this product and the differences were worth purchasing through Amazon...Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> I gave it a 1/5 stars because I received it April 16th and it is already no longer working. Extremely disappointed as it worked well in the beginning.</li>
    <li> I love this iron, but have used it for years with some irritation.  Let me explain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I love this curling iron as it does a great job straightening and smoothing the riotous red curls I fight after every shampoo.  The iron is  easy to use, it&#x27;s not unattractive as such items go, and it has a wide-range of settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The issue I&#x27;ve had with it has been in the spring mechanism that will wear down rendering the iron unable to open or close properly.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I had previously only found this iron at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply for $80.  Ouch.  So the issue with the spring and the need to replace the iron was irritating.  Sally&#x27;s took back a couple of the irons after the springs wore out after only three months.  But the last iron I have used (and which I was replacing this time) lasted for almost two years before giving out completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In looking to replace my iron I found that Amazon offered it at a great price from an affiliate.  I couldn&#x27;t believe how much cheaper this same iron was here.  I was so happy with the price that I decided to buy the iron again and then be able to cheaply replace it when the spring on the new iron gave out.&lt;br /&gt;What a nice surprise I had when finding TWO replacement springs included in the box.  Apparently the manufacturer is aware of the problem.  There is also an order form for replacement springs for $2.50 + shipping. With the two springs included in with my new iron I was able to repair my old iron to keep in our RV, and have the new one - with an extra spring at the ready - in my home.</li>
    <li> Not impressed at all. The only positive thing I will say is that it does make your hair looks healthy and shiny but my curls did not keep at all. Even with hairspray. Bummed out because it got so many greT reviews. Not to mention I can&#x27;t count how many times I&#x27;ve burned my finger tips. Maybe it&#x27;s no good for long hair?</li>
    <li> Gets real hot, has a nice long cord and the Spring loaded barrel holds the hair real tight. Much better than what you can buy in the stores.</li>
    <li> This thing is the most amazing curling iron ever!  Seriously.</li>
    <li> Average iron. This may be too hot for thin hair and it may work well on thin hair, but my hair is considered thick so, this iron works only OK for me. It gets hot quickly, but it does not work as well, or feel as hot as my old CHI iron that would &amp;#34;only&amp;#34; get up to 200 degrees. Curls go flat quickly and the spring already feels like it&#x27;s getting weak. Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> My hear is down to my nipples (sorry, TMI?) and it&#x27;s pretty thick, so I like having bigger, more voluminous waves and curls in it. This curling iron heats up very quickly and forms large, long-lasting curls. It gets very hot (430 degrees), and has an easily activated on/off switch. The cord is plenty long, and I love that it swivels so it doesn&#x27;t get horribly tangled upon use. Also, the black rubber &amp;#34;tip&amp;#34; of the iron stay cool to the touch, which is important when trying to maneuver this larger barrel around your head.I love Hot Tools products, and I will continue to buy them.</li>
    <li> I had purchased this curling iron almost 2 years ago. After one year it started acting up, turning off and on while I was curling my hair. A couple months later it only worked if it held the cord a certain way. Then one day it caught on fire while I was curling my hair! I called hot tools customer service and even though it was out of warranty and I had used it for almost 2 years, they sent me a new one! Great customer service!</li>
    <li> I have used this brand for years. Unfortunately the metal piece that allows the iron to open and close usually gets weak after using it a good amount of time. Some Irons come with extra sets of these specific parts and you are able to replace it. I still think it is a great iron!</li>
    <li> The item arrived on time and in the condition it was advertised. The barrel was a little bigger than I had expected but it worked for me. You can use it to straighten your hair or to create gorgeous waves.</li>
    <li> I have long thick short &amp; curly hair and the hair on my head is the same, but longer. this curling iron is perfect for my hair type. It straightens my hair with beautiful waves. Its exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this curling iron! It has different heat settings and creates perfect curls.  I&#x27;ve had it for about a year now and it hasn&#x27;t given me any problems.  The width is wide, so I can only use it on long hair.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s my hair (it&#x27;s kinda thick) but not even with lots of hairspray it won&#x27;t stay put for very long U_U&lt;br /&gt;...and i dont like the heavy sprayed look, I want my curls to look natural so without spray theres no way I&#x27;ll get the look i want..&lt;br /&gt;and the tool is super hot! &gt;_&amp;lt;</li>
    <li> This iron heats quickly and does a great job smoothing. Mine let&#x27;s you set your own heat settings and the higher settings are indeed very hot, good for curly hair.    I now have the hot tools irons in all sizes. I first bought the 1\\&quot; and loved it and have slowly added to my collection, so that I can get different looks. I have naturally tight curls, that are unruly. I use the 1 1/2\\&quot; when I want an almost straight look, but want the sides to go back a bit, and the back to have some really big loose curls / waves. I use the 1 1/4 inch to get the Jessica Simpson / Daisy Duke look. I use the 1\\&quot; for medium size loose curls (Easy to shake out), and the smaller size for tight curls or corkscrew curls.     I find the 1 1/2\\&quot; to be faster than using a straightener, and can get an almost straight look with it but add a bit of large curls if that is what I am going for. I use the 1 1/4\\&quot; the most (more on a daily basis). It is good for Medium to long hair. Note: the two inch, for me, is very uncomfortable and awkward to use. I have burnt my ear twice, and the curls almost always fall out. That is the only one I regret buying.</li>
    <li> works great at straightening out very curly/kinky hair, but still leaving a little body. barrel is too big to add definition to your curls, however. It is more of a smoothing out tool. This is my 3rd Hot Tools iron and they&#x27;re the best.</li>
    <li> I love this iron and have not had any problems with the spring, but I am sure after much use it will break.</li>
    <li> This iron has simplified my life and cut time in half! I originally thought the iron would be small, but the larger barrel is great for huge body curls and beautiful waves. Thank you for the prompt service! It was delivered right on time. I have been using it everyday since!</li>
    <li> Love it! This was perfect size for the curl I wanted. It heats up fast, you can also control the temperature. my hair always got burned or there were a lot of smoke whenever I curled my hair with other products but this one does not! absolutely recommended.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.</li>
    <li> I really like this product but it already stopped working. It will no longer heat up and i have not even had it a year yet. I think I will be switching over to babyliss unless they are will to exchange this product for me. Thank you</li>
    <li> My favorite curling iron and recommend seller</li>
    <li> Does not get as &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; as the old commercial Hot Tools products but still works well.</li>
    <li> The product is just what I want, but I had to return it, the size was too large.  I need the next size down.</li>
    <li> I had a professional grade curling iron for over 20 years when it finally died.  This iron is the same quality and I get the same results as I did with the professional one.</li>
    <li> My favorite curling iron.  Do your best to keep track of the extra springs as they do wear out over time.  Definitely lasts longer than other brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> This curling iron is really great for long hair!  I always get compliments when I use this barrel.  It gives the perfect beach wave type curls.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve had my hot tools for over a year now &amp; when my daughter&#x27;s curling iron died on her - i had to buy her one of of her own so she can take it to her college dorm.  absolutely fast, easy to heat so you can curl your hair right away.  i won&#x27;t hesitate to recommend this product.</li>
    <li> - Works very well&lt;br /&gt;- Becomes super hot - which my thick hair needs to help hold a style&lt;br /&gt;- Pivoting cord at the end is genius, never gets tangled&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to use</li>
    <li> This curling iron is awful. I already returned one because the heating mechanism was broke. I decided to give it a second try and am beyond disappointed. Hair doesn&#x27;t slide through it at all, it just sticks to it and breaks. It also leaves lines all in your hair when you curl it around the barrel. This is the worst curling iron I&#x27;ve bought and I&#x27;ve been buying them for over 10 years</li>
    <li> I wish the barrel made more curls than waves but either way, I use it and like it....</li>
    <li> it was such a great purchase and for such a great price. For the price, I figured this curling iron would stop working soon after I bought it. It has been months since i started using it and still works perfectly. Buying another in a different size as we speak.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair that has problems holding a curl. After using this I was very surprised at how much body the iron gave me and how well the curl held. I like to take small sections and wrap up the entire length of my hair from tip to root then unclamp and pin for max body and curl hold. I have been noticing that when I take my hair down that there are multiple dents where the iron has clamped my hair. I have tried not clamping down all the way but the dents are still there. For that reason, despite all the good things about this iron, I have to take it back. Maybe those with thicker hair won&#x27;t have this issue. I didn&#x27;t have this issue with a ceramic curling iron so I might try a ceramic in the same brand.</li>
    <li> The Hot Tools Big Bumper Spring Curling Iron, 1-1/2 inch just quit heating up after one short month of use.</li>
    <li> I have owned some hot tools products in the past, and it seems as though the quality has diminished over the years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;-This does get very hot&lt;br /&gt;-The controls are great&lt;br /&gt;-The barrel is smooth and I have not had an issue with it getting caught in my hair or my hair not sliding through it easily.&lt;br /&gt;- My hair does hold curl fairly well and this creates larger, waves that stay...for me, at least (if you want something for tighter curls, go with a 1 inch barrel)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;- The purple ring above the cord is so cheap and broke shortly after I got it. This resulted in the whole wand coming apart and shocking me. I currently have it duct taped together and it&#x27;s survived this way for close to a year now...although very annoying. I just didn&#x27;t want to replace it so soon after buying it and am trying to make it last till it dies completely.&lt;br /&gt;- the stand is so cheap and doesn&#x27;t work at all. I have a small bathroom with zero counter space. I set the curling iron on the stand on top of my toilet seat and the stand slid back, resulting in the toilet seat top getting burned (it&#x27;s plastic). Not long after that, the stand popped off completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this gets hot and does create curls, I&#x27;m not expecting it to last terribly long judging from how cheaply the outside of the curling iron was made!</li>
    <li> Love love love love this hot tools! The best one I have ever used seriously ! You won&#x27;t regret this purchase</li>
    <li> I have several sizes of Hot Tools curling irons.  Only brand I have used for several years.  I have thick curly hair and need a curling iron that will get very hot to keep up with job.  This is it.</li>
    <li> I bought it because my daughter has a similiar curling iron. We both like the one I purchased better than the curling iron she has.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite curling iron ever.  Great product styling... Weight is perfect.  Cord is long.  Controls are easy to use and do not easily shift if bumped, etc. I highly recommend and would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I ordered this one when my el cheapo one finally died on me.  My mom is a professional cosmetologist and recommended this brand to me.  I love it!  It heats up fast and it&#x27;s hot.  It does exactly what I need it to do and rarely requires multiple passes over my hair to get it the way I want.</li>
    <li> Works very well.so far so good.</li>
    <li> Came as expected. Happy to be able to shop online. Also, beauty supply shops in my area charge much more for this if you are not a licensed beautician.</li>
    <li> Great curling iron.  My other one just wore out.</li>
    <li> I use this curling iron every day and it&#x27;s the best curling iron ever!  Glides right through my hair, evenly heats and curls my hair fast!</li>
    <li> This is a great curling iron. The best brand I have purchased so far. Very happy with this product :)</li>
    <li> Heats up quick, good quality curling iron. Would definitely buy again, but this curling iron seems to be so well made, don&#x27;t figure I&#x27;ll have to buy one for quite some time!</li>
    <li> This is probably the best curling iron I have ever owned. I would definitely by this item again.</li>
    <li> I like the adjustable heat settings, and the iron heats up very quickly. It is easy to use. I am very happy with this.</li>
    <li> i bought this because of all the great reviews it had, i dont know if its because i have curly thin hair but. my hair dosent keep the curl , i have to keep going over and over the same spot of hairand i know it dosent make a diference.to me it was not a great buy</li>
    <li> Nice curling iron.  Need to change springs once in a while about every year.</li>
    <li> Great curling iron. It gives nice big curls and works for both long hair as well as shoulder length (I have had both). The iron doesn&#x27;t feel as damaging on my hair and doesn&#x27;t snag the hair either (i have had that experience with conair in the past).</li>
    <li> This curling iron sells for at least $10-$20 more at Ulta- even when it&#x27;s on sale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve already used it on my mid length hair and the 1 1/2 size makes perfect beachy curls!</li>
    <li> Ordered this product a couple of months ago and I love it. I own the smaller curling iron and wanted to   purchase a larger size.  I love the size I ordered. Gives my hair just enough body without to much curl.  You gotta be careful though, because of the size you could get to close to scalp and burn yourself. So  just be a little more careful when using it. I am happy I purchased this item.  The delivery time was  exceptional, I wasn&#x27;t expecting it so soon. I would order from this company again.</li>
    <li> I have purchased hot tools in a salon before for $60-80.  This price was fantastic and this is the best curling iron ever.  You will never use a cheaper version again.  Cuts the styling time in half!</li>
    <li> Great curling iron that not only straightens my hair as well as give me the good Farrah Fawcet curls.  Love it!</li>
    <li> These curling irons are great. I have to use it on the highest setting but I have thick hair. Unlike flat irons, it doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out and my hair is bouncy and the curls are very nice. I also loved the price. I priced them at the beauty supply stores and they were more expensive. I do love my Amazon!</li>
    <li> Hot Tools are the best!  They are durable with a wide range of heat options; I need some real heat when curling my long hair and I can always count on Hot Tools irons to do the job. I&#x27;ve noticed most of the stylists at my salon use Hot Tools irons as well...</li>
    <li> Love this curling iron!  I have been using the Hot Tools for years and they tend to last about 5 to 7 years with frequent use.  Great product.  Of course it arrived on time with the Amazon Prime and I saved myself the inconvenience of another shopping errand.</li>
    <li> This is the second Hot Tools curling iron I have purchased and I love it!  It  holds the heat very well and I am impressed with the quality</li>
    <li> Worked for a couple of weeks. Then stopped getting as hot as it should. I can touch it at its hottest now. Also, the barrel is short and I get chunks of hair stuck in the springs, which is painful. Low quality item.</li>
    <li> Loved the product itself, but must let everyone know... My hair holds a curl very easily and even at it&#x27;s hottest setting, the barrel seems a bit too large to do much for my hair length ( on the shorter side of long hair)</li>
    <li> This is the second hot tools curling iron I bought in a year.  the first one just stopped heating up.  within a week after getting the new one the spring clip slipped out of place.  I&#x27;m a little disappointed.</li>
    <li> This does not smoothly glide through hair or leave good curls. Be careful only 30 day return window.</li>
    <li> I liked this product a lot until it BROKE and stopped heating up after less than 2 months of owning it! I am outside of my return window so I plan to contact this seller.</li>
    <li> thank you it was perfect</li>
    <li> This was the perfect curling size I&#x27;ve been looking for. I purchased this based on all the good reviews.</li>
    <li> I was very happy with this curling iron. I wanted a larger curling iron for my long hair to get looser waves but it seemed that every curling iron I used would not hold my curls for very long. This curling iron gets very hot super fast and holds my curls all day. I love it. I would definitely recommend this product to those who are interested in buying this curling iron.</li>
    <li> Great iron to give large volume waves, it gets really hot so it is great for shaping the hair. But mine got all over a sticky handle after a year, the surface of the rubber handle simply transformed. What I tried is scrubbing very sticky part with an acetone soaked cotton pad, I did it a bit wet and let the machine air dry for about 2 days before using it and now, it is perfect, the handles have a dry and totally unsticky feel.</li>
    <li> My hair is naturally wavy and frizzy. The curling iron does a great job of taking the frizz out but destroys my curls, it works more like a flat iron in my hair</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace itself - I accidentally dropped the other one and so the on/off switch broke. But it served it&#x27;s purpose and had a long life. I love this curling iron and I&#x27;m so happy I found it at such a steal. It gives my hair great body and shine. I use it more as a flat iron and to bump the ends of my hair more than a curler. Love it!</li>
    <li> This is my absolute favorite curling iron. I get big curls with this!</li>
    <li> i couldn&#x27;t find a curling iron that works on my hair coz it is very smooth and thick....but this iron works like magic. i can have nice waves in mins.</li>
    <li> Love it! Makes huge curls for big voluminous hair</li>
    <li> It was exactly the size I needed to re-create what my hair stylist does after a haircut.  Heats up quickly!</li>
    <li> the iron does not curl my hair!! it does dry hair more than anything. i dont think i will use this iron anymore. i am suprised of good reviews. i expected to see big curls but it seems that it does not make even small curls.</li>
    <li> NO glove with purchase . Burn my self many times.</li>
    <li> This is a good iron. I wish I would have gotten it a little smaller but that is my fault. Heats up quickly and works on my thick long hair</li>
    <li> I ordered this because of the heat settings and cool tip design. My only reservation was that I really wanted a ceramic barrel, and this one was gold.&lt;br /&gt;I am glad I went ahead with it. The weight is good, but not so heavy that my hands would tire. Barrel and clip mechanism are very smooth, so my long hair never gets tangled up in it. Overall it just feels like a great quality product. As final confirmation, I was in an expensive salon and saw that this was the curling iron they actually had for sale.&lt;br /&gt;Love it so far!</li>
    <li> I use this curling iron regularly to make larger curls and it works great - doesn&#x27;t take too long to heat up and there is a dial that gives you multiple heating options.  So far I have no had any problems with it.</li>
    <li> Excelente product i love it!! It males my Hair look shiny and soft and it does it quick! Shipping was easy and fast as well so I appreciate that.</li>
    <li> I am replacing an old Helen of Troy curling iron that I dropped and broke. I&#x27;ll be more careful this time! Works great.</li>
    <li> I dont get what kindve hair this works for. Im half latina, I look caucasion, people say my hair is black, but seeing family I dont consider my hair black, I have thick straight hair, and a lot of it. I used very little hair to see if I could curl it, I heated it up to a high setting, I kept it in my hair for 15 secs, it was very hot, as I had touched it to my head by accident, practically nothing happened except for the very end was curled. Seeing I was new to curlingn irons I looked up youtube vids to see what I was doing wrong, I tried 2 techniques, rolling the hair around the shaft, then clamping, and clamping the end and rolling up, still nothing, Im keeping with my straightner to curl, its ceramic, curls last long, and it actually works... reason I looked for something else is that my particular flat iron has a gap that rips my hair out. IDK why people like this, except that it seems like a sturdy machine, it is a bit heavy.</li>
    <li> Although all hair irons eventually wear out, Hot tools (Helen of Troy) products are excellent. I buy them for my two daughters and myself and between the three of us we own at least ten irons, all Hot Tools!</li>
    <li> I did no like this curling iron.  In general, it looks nice; however, it never heated compared to the other Hot Tools iron I own.  Lately it seems items that I order from Amazon are just cheaper, lower quality items than what I could find at a local store selling the same thing.  I love the saving the money, but my time is more valuable.  I spent time looking for the correct correct curling iron and comparing details and prices.  The product I received was not worth the discount.  Will be returning item and already purchased the real thing from a local store.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this brand for years and it is consistently good. Now they also include replacement springs for when they wear out. So much better than having to send away for the springs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller got this product to me by the first day promised and everything was in great condition. I&#x27;d buy from them again.</li>
    <li> Love it!!  Hot Tools are the best!</li>
    <li> I give this product 5 stars because it&#x27;s the best curling iron I have ever owned. It heats up really hot and does an awesome job! Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> My hair is layered, medium length and it gives my hair the right amount of volume and curl.  I am very pleased with this product!</li>
    <li> Bought this less than 3 months, used it &amp;#60; 15x and clamp already doesn&#x27;t work correctly. Ugh</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this curling iron! Hot tools is a great brand and the description was exactly what I was expecting and curls very well!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite curing iron. I&#x27;ve been using it for years and Hot Tools never fail me. My first iron lasted me three years+ and thoughout the years I feel like the irons aren&#x27;t lasting as long. Despite that I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> This curling iron was not good for my hair, it worked as a flat iron for me.  I have bust length hair and was trying to get barrel curls, nothing happened and my hair was smoking alot.  The product itself is nice and I simply exchanged it for the same iron but a smaller barrel.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d been using a much thinner wand for a while, and always felt the curls were too damn tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thickness of this one is perfect for my mid-length hair. Gives it the perfect combination of wavy, curly, and bouncy. I always receive compliments after having done my hair with this curling iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It heats up very fast and is as easy to use as any other. And I love the gold finish!</li>
    <li> Not as good as ceramic</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t get hot enough</li>
    <li> This is a replacement curling iron, when they finally wear out, I always buy it again.  Great curling iron.</li>
    <li> This works really well, and the cord never gets twisted. It does get very hot so you need to be extra cautious using it.</li>
    <li> just as expected. am very pleased. no complainting to be done. I am happy. the price is good and quality is excellent.</li>
    <li> It was great while it worked.  Less than 6 months after purchasing it just stopped heating.  The light comes on so it is getting power, but it remains cold.  I have had cheaper models that lasted for many years.  Will never buy another one of their products.</li>
    <li> Great size, and it works great!</li>
    <li> I love this curling iron! I have a couple different sized barrels by Helen of Troy Hot Tools and I love them all. They all get really hot but I have thick and course hair so I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast and convenient!</li>
    <li> Well made and cheaper than retail beauty supply chains.</li>
    <li> stopped working for no apparent reason??</li>
    <li> I have been using the Hot Tools curling iron for years and I love the way it heats up and curls my hair.</li>
    <li> Item as described and shipment was made quickly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned this curling iron for over a year and have had no issues with it!! Still very happy I purchased it!</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t hold my curls very well. Took a long time for the curls to even hold, it felt like i was holding this curling iron in my hair for at least 5 minutes per section. I would curl my hair and spray the curls so they would hold but within an hour they had fallen out.</li>
    <li> Great product! I have purchased this line many times in the past and have always been satisfied. The adjustable heating control makes it easy to use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a over a month. I keep trying to come up with bad things to say about it but I just can&#x27;t. It&#x27;s a great iron.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely better than what I was using before - a Conair ceramic that worked well but left crimps in my hair and didn&#x27;t hold the curl all day.&lt;br /&gt;This iron gives my hair a nice smooth curl that lasts.&lt;br /&gt;Some of the negative reviews mention that the iron gets too hot. That&#x27;s not my experience at all. I use it on the hottest setting. It&#x27;s not hotter than my old Conair. (But my hair is thick and coarse so it can handle the heat. Might be more of issue for thinner hair, I guess.)&lt;br /&gt;My only real complaint is that the cord is too long for my small bathroom but that&#x27;s just me being silly.&lt;br /&gt;I guess I could say that I&#x27;m a little disappointed because I thought that this iron would be quicker to use than my old one. But it&#x27;s not. Maybe that was an unrealistic expectation though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****update*** I recently got a couple of inches cut off my hair and now my hair is just below should length. The 1-1/2 is really too big. I think I&#x27;m going to have to order the 1-1/4 now.&lt;br /&gt;Even before I got my hair cut shorter, I was already thinking I might prefer the smaller barrel as the 1-1/2 inch really doesn&#x27;t give much curl. It seemed to at first. But after a little while, it started to just act as a straightener and give my have a little wave. It&#x27;s still a nice look, but not really what I&#x27;m going for. It&#x27;s strange that the effect changed in such a short time though. It&#x27;s like my hair adjusted to the iron. Maybe that&#x27;s just what happens when using such high heat every day?&lt;br /&gt;Oh well. whatever. I&#x27;m going to try the Hot Tools 1-1/4 now.&lt;br /&gt;Even though I&#x27;m not saving any time, I had to spend more money and the cord gets on my nerves, the end result is worth it because my hair looks better than it ever has!</li>
    <li> Everytime I curl my hair with this iron all I get are compliments.  The 1 1/2 inch curls make one feel so glamorous and the curls last all day long.  It only takes a few minutes and the least bit of effort to achieve the style youre looking for.  The heating time on this product is so efficient and each curl comes out perfect.  This is my second Helen of Troy product, I trust in the brand and will continue to purchase it&#x27;s products.</li>
    <li> I love these curling irons! My salon uses this brand. I love the results I get. Every time I get a trim and I get styled I get big beautiful curls.</li>
    <li> Heat up so fast, hold the curl, does not damage your hair</li>
    <li> I never buy anything else.  These curling irons are great and don&#x27;t wreck your hair.  They last for years and are worth the money!</li>
    <li> Love how long the cord is! Will definitely invest in another curling iron in a different size! Won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Excellent Quality. Heats quickly and is solid, durable. As long as the quality stays, I will continue to purchase thier product.</li>
    <li> Have only used once but it seemed to work great for curling my hair, love the size of curls, and they stayed in all day!</li>
    <li> This is the only large curling iron my wife will buy.</li>
    <li> I love the Hot Tools curling irons. I have it in 2 different sizes. They work really well and my hair holds the curl without using any product. It relaxes a little after an hour or so, but I like it that way. It would probably hold perfectly if you did use gel, or hairspray, or something.</li>
