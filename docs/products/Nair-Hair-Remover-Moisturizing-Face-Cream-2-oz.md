### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It does a great job!!</li>
      <li>Happy camper here.</li>
      <li>This was very effective on the chin</li>
      <li>Apart from that, it had a good smell and serves for its purpose.</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>Works great and thanks to good ol AMAZON!</li>
      <li>I will keep using Nair using this procedure because my skin looks really good and hair free.  </li>
      <li>I bought from Walgreens though for a better price.</li>
      <li>Extremely fast shipping and works great</li>
      <li>Maybe it works for people with more fine hair, but if you have course hair, it won&#x27;t work for you.</li>
      <li>This has caused the skin underneath the area where I was shaving to turn a lighter color (I have light skin).  </li>
      <li>BUT this newer formula and packaging are nice, much gentler and leaves skin softer.</li>
      <li>so if you want that baby smooth shave, you&#x27;ll have to use cream and a razor, which defeats the purpose of even using this product.</li>
      <li>but it is good if you don&#x27;t have a store near you.</li>
      <li>This is much longer than is recommended, so you will need to do a skin test by applying the Lubriderm, then applying the Nair, and make sure that it does not burn you.  </li>
      <li>I tried it two more times thinking that maybe I didn&#x27;t do it right the first time, but it didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
      <li>This one hair at first looked like it didn&#x27;t go away, but after I rubbed -  lightly - the hair came off at skin level and can&#x27;t be seen any longer.  </li>
      <li>I would be able to live with the blotchy chin</li>
      <li>I purchased this at CVS, slightly cheaper, but it worked great for me.</li>
      <li>I bought this MANY years ago and had old bottle.</li>
      <li>I find wiping it off with a pre-moistened/baby wipe is better than a damp towel and there is less irritation (also more hygienic).</li>
      <li>The only thing is that this does not work in 5 minutes unless it is very fine hair that has never been touched</li>
      <li>Keep in mind, waxing pulls the hair out, which will cause hair to become more coarse over time.  </li>
      <li>Shaving does not cause hair to become more coarse, but it also has drawbacks.</li>
      <li>I rubbed in the Lubriderm very well until it was fully absorbed by my skin.  </li>
      <li>and I also bought at a target at a better price but leave on for 8-10 minutes 5 is simply not enough time</li>
      <li>Because in the lip Around, or to be more careful, don&#x27;t know for how long, is still quite satisfied!</li>
      <li>Better than getting burned with hot wax, and leaves your face feeling soft and doesn&#x27;t irritate sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>Pay less and get more!</li>
      <li>It also really burned the first time I tried it, and the burning lasted for 24 hours.</li>
      <li>I was not sure if still good so tried finding and could NOT find anywhere....</li>
      <li>First, I applied Lubriderm Advanced Therapy For Extra-Dry Skin to a much larger area than was to be treated with Nair.  </li>
      <li>Does the job shipping was fast</li>
      <li>/&gt;IT CUT MY WHOLE SKIN :</li>
      <li>Thanks again</li>
      <li>You may have to keep it on a bit longer, but it works well and leaves skin very conditioned afterwords.</li>
      <li>Used on my lip and chin left in for five minutes and all hair was gone and my skin was so smooth.</li>
      <li>We need to protect our skin very well with the moisturizer before applying Nair.  </li>
      <li>The hair does regrow kinda fast just like if you used a razor.</li>
      <li>Thanks Nair.</li>
      <li>Thanks to menopause, this is a must have for me.  </li>
      <li>hey, I can just smear a bunch of this crud on my face and get ready for school while I&#x27;m waiting for it to work.</li>
      <li>The burning sensation only happened that first time, luckily.</li>
      <li>The color &amp; smell is pure and fresh, with a thick layer around the lips, feeling cool, wait for five minutes, with  scraper scrape off , first with 95% can shave the mustache, effect was satisfactory.</li>
      <li>Gentle on my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>today was the first time i used it left it on 7 min removed all my hair kinda burned alittle not to much</li>
      <li>If you have thicker facial hair, several applications will be required to get that smooth feel.</li>
      <li>May try the sensitive formula but will be throwing this one out.</li>
      <li>Hope this works for others as it did for me, because this is far preferable to both shaving and waxing.  </li>
      <li>It did not burn me, and I have fairly sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>What I did was wipe my upper lip gently with a baby wipe to remove dirt/oil from skin, then I rubbed a teeny amount of coconut oil over the area, proceeded to apply the Nair lotion and left it for 10 minutes.</li>
      <li>The mustache on the face is very serious, I&#x27;ve always wanted to find an appropriate facial hair removal product, before I tried that kind of gentle tearing model, the effect is not ideal, finally found this one on kimiss.com.</li>
      <li>So as a guy, I was skeptical about using this because the use of hair removal products does seem kind of feminine to me.</li>
      <li>Works quickly and gently without irritating my skin.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s quick, removes all hair with slow, soft regrowth.  </li>
      <li>The second time, that one stubborn, coarse black hair did dissolve from the Nair treatment after I kept lightly rubbing the area with a wet washcloth, as per the instructions.  </li>

<li> The second time, that one stubborn, coarse black hair did dissolve from the Nair treatment after I kept lightly rubbing the area with a wet washcloth, as per the instructions.  </li>
<li> This not only did this burn and leave my skin sore and sensitive, it only removed maybe half the hair.</li>
<li> Worked like a charm, and I have coarse dark upper lip hair &amp; am fair/olive skinned Hispanic.</li>
<li> This method does remove even coarse, dark facial hair.  </li>
<li> It burns, it turns your face pink, and it renders you sore to the point that you can&#x27;t touch your face for a couple days, all of which could be forgiven if it actually worked like it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
<li> Keep in mind,  our hair does grow in cycles, so we get rid of one cycle, and then another cycle of hair may grow  out in only a few days.  </li>
<li> Not much to say....</li>
<li> Then, I applied chap stick heavily over my upper and lower lips to protect them, just in case any of the Nair flowed onto my lips.  </li>
<li> After washing with a slight tingling, I&#x27;m not sensitive skin</li>
<li> Years ago, when I used the instructions without changing them, my skin would turn a hot pink and felt weird.  </li>
<li> Not worth the money or the pain.</li>
<li> Next day, I glob a thick layer on my face, set the recommended time on my phone, and go about my morning routine.</li>
<li> Waste money...didnt work...</li>
<li> I&#x27;m thinking it may take a few weeks to remove the hair in all of the growth cycles.  </li>
<li> Waste of money :/</li>
<li> I tried different lengths of time but every time it left me with painful chemical burns.  </li>
<li> , I don&#x27;t remember why I stopped, I guess the old formula was messy and stinky and I got sick of it...</li>
<li> It smells so disgusting and it works fine</li>
<li> Here is what I did to get 5 star results from Nair, even on coarser, hard to remove hair.  </li>
<li> Allowed this to absorb for at least 30 minutes.</li>
<li> However, I am lazy, impatient, and hate standing at the sink for 10 minutes every other morning</li>
<li> It does remove the majority of hair but leaves behind stubble</li>
<li> Waxing is much less painful.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of hair removers, but this was horrible.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This was very effective on the chin and I also bought at a target at a better price but leave on for 8-10 minutes 5 is simply not enough time</li>
    <li> Ever since having my baby, I&#x27;ve been getting hair above my lip like a man has. The hair is course. Nair Face cream does nothing for it! I leave it on for the ten minutes it recommends and it doesn&#x27;t remove the hair at all. Maybe it works for people with more fine hair, but if you have course hair, it won&#x27;t work for you. It also really burned the first time I tried it, and the burning lasted for 24 hours. I didn&#x27;t experience redness. I tried it two more times thinking that maybe I didn&#x27;t do it right the first time, but it didn&#x27;t work at all. The burning sensation only happened that first time, luckily.</li>
    <li> Does the job shipping was fast</li>
    <li> You may have to keep it on a bit longer, but it works well and leaves skin very conditioned afterwords.</li>
    <li> It does a great job!! Left it on for 5 min and it took off every hair I had.</li>
    <li> Thanks to menopause, this is a must have for me.  It&#x27;s quick, removes all hair with slow, soft regrowth.  Gentle on my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Waste money...didnt work...</li>
    <li> Works quickly and gently without irritating my skin.</li>
    <li> Does even work. Waste of money :/</li>
    <li> Years ago, I used facial depillatories like Nair, but switched to &amp;#34;shaving&amp;#34; my upper lip.  This has caused the skin underneath the area where I was shaving to turn a lighter color (I have light skin).  Here is what I did to get 5 star results from Nair, even on coarser, hard to remove hair.  First, I applied Lubriderm Advanced Therapy For Extra-Dry Skin to a much larger area than was to be treated with Nair.  I rubbed in the Lubriderm very well until it was fully absorbed by my skin.  We need to protect our skin very well with the moisturizer before applying Nair.  Allowed this to absorb for at least 30 minutes. DO NOT WASH OFF THE LUBRIDERM BEFORE APPLYING THE NAIR.  Then, I applied chap stick heavily over my upper and lower lips to protect them, just in case any of the Nair flowed onto my lips.  Then, I applied the Nair Moisturizing Face Cream, for 12 minutes.  This is much longer than is recommended, so you will need to do a skin test by applying the Lubriderm, then applying the Nair, and make sure that it does not burn you.  It did not burn me, and I have fairly sensitive skin.  Guess what?  This method does remove even coarse, dark facial hair.  On one troublesome hair, I did have to do this twice over a two day period.  The second time, that one stubborn, coarse black hair did dissolve from the Nair treatment after I kept lightly rubbing the area with a wet washcloth, as per the instructions.  This one hair at first looked like it didn&#x27;t go away, but after I rubbed -  lightly - the hair came off at skin level and can&#x27;t be seen any longer.  I have no idea if this will continue to work for me or not, but am encouraged that it did work.  I will keep using Nair using this procedure because my skin looks really good and hair free.  I do not have any red skin burns from this method.  Years ago, when I used the instructions without changing them, my skin would turn a hot pink and felt weird.  I&#x27;m thinking it may take a few weeks to remove the hair in all of the growth cycles.  Keep in mind,  our hair does grow in cycles, so we get rid of one cycle, and then another cycle of hair may grow  out in only a few days.  Hope this works for others as it did for me, because this is far preferable to both shaving and waxing.  Keep in mind, waxing pulls the hair out, which will cause hair to become more coarse over time.  Shaving does not cause hair to become more coarse, but it also has drawbacks.</li>
    <li> It smells so disgusting and it works fine</li>
    <li> The product works well. My daughter uses it on her face and it works. If you have thicker facial hair, several applications will be required to get that smooth feel.</li>
    <li> Extremely fast shipping and works great</li>
    <li> Better than getting burned with hot wax, and leaves your face feeling soft and doesn&#x27;t irritate sensitive skin.  Pay less and get more!</li>
    <li> Used on my lip and chin left in for five minutes and all hair was gone and my skin was so smooth. I bought from Walgreens though for a better price.</li>
    <li> So as a guy, I was skeptical about using this because the use of hair removal products does seem kind of feminine to me. However, I am lazy, impatient, and hate standing at the sink for 10 minutes every other morning so I figure hey, I can just smear a bunch of this crud on my face and get ready for school while I&#x27;m waiting for it to work. So I test it like it says and then wait 24 hours. Next day, I glob a thick layer on my face, set the recommended time on my phone, and go about my morning routine. It burns, it turns your face pink, and it renders you sore to the point that you can&#x27;t touch your face for a couple days, all of which could be forgiven if it actually worked like it&#x27;s supposed to.

    <li> I love it! I bought this MANY years ago and had old bottle. I was not sure if still good so tried finding and could NOT find anywhere....UNTIL I found it here! Its the SAME one! Yeahhhhh.  Works great and thanks to good ol AMAZON! Happy camper here. Thanks again</li>
    <li> Not much to say....it does the job.</li>
    <li> The mustache on the face is very serious, I&#x27;ve always wanted to find an appropriate facial hair removal product, before I tried that kind of gentle tearing model, the effect is not ideal, finally found this one on kimiss.com. The color &amp; smell is pure and fresh, with a thick layer around the lips, feeling cool, wait for five minutes, with  scraper scrape off , first with 95% can shave the mustache, effect was satisfactory. Because in the lip Around, or to be more careful, don&#x27;t know for how long, is still quite satisfied! After washing with a slight tingling, I&#x27;m not sensitive skin so the tolerable range, use sedating products can ease!</li>
    <li> today was the first time i used it left it on 7 min removed all my hair kinda burned alittle not to much</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of hair removers, but this was horrible.  I tried different lengths of time but every time it left me with painful chemical burns.  I would have a scab for days after trying to use this.  And the hair was still there.  Not worth the money or the pain.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like it because burned my face</li>
    <li> Buying this item on Amazon is more expensive than buying it at Walmart but it is good if you don&#x27;t have a store near you. Apart from that, it had a good smell and serves for its purpose. The hair does regrow kinda fast just like if you used a razor.</li>
    <li> It literally burned through me skin. Now I have red marks all over my face. Even though it did remove the hair, I would suggest waxing over this. Waxing is much less painful.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t remove any hair</li>
    <li> I DO NOT RECOMMEND&lt;br /&gt;I WANT MY MONEY BACK&lt;br /&gt;IT CUT MY WHOLE SKIN :(&lt;br /&gt;THEY SHOULD HAVE WARNED ME</li>
    <li> I would be able to live with the blotchy chin it left me if the hair was gone, but now I have a blotchy hairy chin instead if just a hairy one. Thanks Nair.</li>
    <li> This not only did this burn and leave my skin sore and sensitive, it only removed maybe half the hair. I had one hair survive two applications, a week apart. May try the sensitive formula but will be throwing this one out.</li>
    <li> I purchased this at CVS, slightly cheaper, but it worked great for me. I used to use it in highschool, I don&#x27;t remember why I stopped, I guess the old formula was messy and stinky and I got sick of it... BUT this newer formula and packaging are nice, much gentler and leaves skin softer. The only thing is that this does not work in 5 minutes unless it is very fine hair that has never been touched (I used it on some peach fuzz I had under my bottom lip). What I did was wipe my upper lip gently with a baby wipe to remove dirt/oil from skin, then I rubbed a teeny amount of coconut oil over the area, proceeded to apply the Nair lotion and left it for 10 minutes. I find wiping it off with a pre-moistened/baby wipe is better than a damp towel and there is less irritation (also more hygienic). Worked like a charm, and I have coarse dark upper lip hair &amp; am fair/olive skinned Hispanic.</li>
    <li> Did nothing and now the skin on my face hurts.</li>
