      <li>Basic mirror, serves its purpose, cheap price, cheap plastic.</li>

      <li>The mirror is clear and distortion free on both the non-magnified and magnified sides and the plastic frame wont rust, it seems to be well made.</li>

      <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I was looking for in a travel mirror.  </li>

      <li>Thank you so much!</li>
      <li>To keep it from fogging hold it under hot water for about thirty seconds</li>
      <li>Plus, Goody is great brand and their products last a long time!</li>
      <li>For the price this seems to be a good quality mirror with a well made adjustable stand that seems to be sturdy enough for regular use.</li>
      <li>The bigger issue is that the mirror has a sticker from the manufacturer on the face of the mirror and does not peel off easily.</li>
      <li>In the end it just became too much work</li>
      <li>I really like this mirror and the fact that it stands up by itself or you can hold it&lt;</li>
      <li>Fast shipping too</li>
      <li>I knocked to 4 stars because the label was affixed to the reflective surface by some kind of super barnacle glue, very hard to remove.  </li>
      <li>I have had a Goody mirror exactly like this one for at least twenty-five years, and I honestly didn&#x27;t think they even made them anymore until I saw this one on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Got it to replace an old one exactly like it.  </li>
      <li>I love this little mirror.</li>
      <li>Compact, dual magnification is handy and seems well-constructed out of hard plastic.  </li>
      <li>so you can look at either the magnified or normal side.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is very clear</li>
      <li>The first orde came broken, return was easy and at no charge.</li>
      <li>The actual mirror is almost 5&amp;#34; -- large enough to find the sneakiest hair!</li>
      <li>Unfortunately, I received a purple one, which is not the most masculine of colors.  </li>
      <li>It is small enough to fit into my drawer with my hair brushes, but big enough to use to apply my makeup.</li>

<li> the mirror and frame measure approximately 6&amp;#34;.</li>
<li> Very irritating.</li>
<li> /&gt;Not crazy re purple color, but no choice allowed.</li>
<li> It is impossible to get the glue off of the mirror making one side unusable.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I had a mirror with more of a &#x27;stand&#x27; to it, which quickly broke. This feels more durable and is easily swapped about. The handle/stand also allows the mirror to angle as you please.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for in a travel mirror.  With the handle you can stand it on a table or hold the handle to see the back of your hair.  Good clarity also.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had several of these through the years and they are great for the price.  I&#x27;ve never been able to break one and the mirror provides a good image for shaving and anything else that you&#x27;d need a mirror like this for.</li>
    <li> This is a great mirror for all purpose use. I would recommend this product to everyone who needs a mirror for daily as well as saloon use</li>
    <li> Basic mirror, serves its purpose, cheap price, cheap plastic. The first orde came broken, return was easy and at no charge.</li>
    <li> This is a hand mirror that props itself up so you can look at either the magnified or normal side. Pretty good buy, and I keep in my desk at work just to check myself out in case I have to run to a meeting where I must be presentable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works for what it is!</li>
    <li> It is a nice mirror with white frame &amp; good qualty mirrors. The stand feature does work. Not a cheapo.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s round and shows your reflection! I guess  as long as you like your own reflection you will like this too</li>
    <li> Handle is strong, mirror is perfectly sized and light enough to see the back of your head. Overall, for my purposes of cutting my own hair (I&#x27;m a guy) it worked out perfectly.</li>
    <li> This is a 2 sided mirror (1 side 1X and 1 side 2X). It works great, I like the handle to hold the mirror behind my head without leaving fingerprints on the mirror. The handle also serves as a stand to use the mirror on a table. I received a white one.</li>
    <li> first time the mirror hit the ground the handle broke in two.  cheaply made, but it reflects so cant complain too much right?</li>
    <li> This mirror was an add on to one of my orders.  I wanted it for the shower.  Unfortunately, I received a purple one, which is not the most masculine of colors.  The bigger issue is that the mirror has a sticker from the manufacturer on the face of the mirror and does not peel off easily.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these for myself years ago as I need LOTS of magnification at my age to apply my makeup. Was super excited when I found this one for my husband so now I don&#x27;t have to share mine when we travel. The handle folds down for a compact size to pack and acts like a stand when two hands are needed. Great buy.</li>
    <li> Mirror arrived intact, but handle was not. I thought I could pop it back together, but it was completely broken. It doesn&#x27;t effect the mirror&#x27;s function, but I cannot use the stand. It&#x27;s not worth the hassle to send it back, so I&#x27;ll use it as a hand held mirror.</li>
    <li> Just what my wife wanted! Fast shipping too</li>
    <li> I really like this mirror and the fact that it stands up by itself or you can hold it&lt;br /&gt;It is very clear</li>
    <li> mirror fell, stand broke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok view on non-magnifying side. some blurriness on magnifying side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;competitively priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not crazy re purple color, but no choice allowed.</li>
    <li> I broke a mirror and could not seem to find a replacement so I got this one thinking that it seemed about the right size and type.  It was just what I was looking for.  Lightweight and manageable size.</li>
    <li> Purchased for our son so he would have when visiting with us.  He uses it when shaving -- it serves the purpose well.  Although I was not given an option to choose the color, the off-white one the seller sent was acceptable and in good condition.</li>
    <li> It won&#x27;t predict the future or tell you how great you look but it does everything else a mirror should do.  Compact, dual magnification is handy and seems well-constructed out of hard plastic.  I knocked to 4 stars because the label was affixed to the reflective surface by some kind of super barnacle glue, very hard to remove.  Obviously not much thought went into that.</li>
    <li> Easy and it is comfortable to use.  Have had these mirrors for years! and after 6 years i dropped it and broke. Had to get the same one!</li>
    <li> One side had a nice label that peeled right off.  The other side had a paper label and we have tried everything but, can still see it.  Very irritating.</li>
    <li> If you were wondering... the mirror and frame measure approximately 6&amp;#34;. The actual mirror is almost 5&amp;#34; -- large enough to find the sneakiest hair!</li>
    <li> This is a very cheap handheld mirror. Perfect for when you don&#x27;t have access to a large mirror. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> For the price this seems to be a good quality mirror with a well made adjustable stand that seems to be sturdy enough for regular use.</li>
    <li> I love this little mirror. It is small enough to fit into my drawer with my hair brushes, but big enough to use to apply my makeup. I like that it has a handle so that I can hold the mirror without getting fingerprints on the mirror. I also like that it is two sided because I can easily see what&#x27;s in front of me. Plus, Goody is great brand and their products last a long time! Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> I have had a Goody mirror exactly like this one for at least twenty-five years, and I honestly didn&#x27;t think they even made them anymore until I saw this one on Amazon. It is absolutely the best little mirror, and I now own two new ones. If you need a sturdy little mirror for your home, office, or your travel kit, this is it.</li>
    <li> This is great for guys who want to shave in the mirror and get the back of their neck. The only downside so far is that the manufacture puts a sticker on the mirror which is hard to remove. Be careful, tear off slowly.</li>
    <li> The sticker for Goody is placed smack dab in the middle of the mirror. I checked at Target and the same thing was done with the Goody mirrors.  It is impossible to get the glue off of the mirror making one side unusable.  I tried vinegar, spray and wash, soaking, and a few other solutions I googled. In the end it just became too much work so I&#x27;m only using one side. I would NOT recommend this product based on sticker placement. The quality of the mirror and size are great otherwise.</li>
    <li> This is a great little mirror.  It stands up with your choice of strength of mirror showing.  Works well. Go for it.</li>
    <li> I am nearsighted and need a mirror I can hold while I apply makeup. This mirror has worked out well. In fact, I had one of these mirrors for about six years before it finally came apart. (The mirrors are glued to the frame.) The 2X side is great for applying eye makeup. I happened to get a purple-framed mirror - I&#x27;m a fan of purple, so I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
    <li> This is a great mirror.  Durable and it has the magnifying side.  Just the right size to take on all our travels, too.</li>
    <li> Had one and I dropped it and broke it.  Couldn&#x27;t believe I could find another one just like it, but Amazon had it.&lt;br /&gt;It is perfect as you can adjust how it stands so you can see without hands.</li>
    <li> The frame is designed to stand up well and the actual mirror is good quality for the price. I like it and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I like that it has a handle that you can grip. The handle also has the ability to bend itself at an angle so you could actually prop the mirror up in a standing position. Very great and useful feature. No complaints here!</li>
    <li> Got it to replace an old one exactly like it.  No issues.  Exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> this is a great mirror.  i like how the handle swivels.  i have trouble seeing the back of my hair and this is perfect and I can also sit this on the countertop if I need to put on makeup and someone else is using the mirror over the sink.</li>
    <li> This is nothing to get all gushy about, it&#x27;s just a damned mirror.  I wanted a hand mirror that could be hung on a hook out of the way and that&#x27;s what I got.</li>
    <li> I bought this to shave in the shower and it fits the bill perfectly. The mirror is clear and distortion free on both the non-magnified and magnified sides and the plastic frame wont rust, it seems to be well made. The handle you see pictured pivots and can be used to hang it from a hook or used as a stand to sit on a flat surface. To keep it from fogging hold it under hot water for about thirty seconds and you&#x27;re good to go. I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve found, time and time again, that I need a mirror in my office. Primarily after eating food at my desk to make sure nothing is in my teeth--but sometimes to pull up my hair or for whatever other reason when I don&#x27;t want to go to the bathroom to do it. This has been handy--b/c not only can I look--but I can make it a stand for when I want to see AND floss at the same time, etc. Good price and exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> very good, the magnified side works excellent, and the handle is excellent for standing the mirror on it&#x27;s own, totally hands free</li>
