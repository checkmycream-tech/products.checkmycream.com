      <li>I love this smell.</li>
      <li>Hair is smooth and sleek!</li>
      <li>The conditioner works much better than the shampoo.</li>
      <li>the hair nice and smooth</li>
      <li>After one use there is a notably difference</li>
      <li>Love this</li>
      <li>but the smell is ok.</li>
      <li>Light conditioner that leaves my hair bouncy!</li>
      <li>I recently was spending time on Amazon looking for the perfect shampoo to give me volume.</li>
      <li>This turned out to be a great volumizing conditioner, so much so that I&#x27;m adding it to my &amp;#34;subscribe and save&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>A good conditioner if your hair is pretty healthy already and you are looking for tangle control.</li>
      <li>My hair was smooth and healthy, but laid too close to the head.</li>
      <li>Leaves my hair feeling soft, and it smells great.</li>
      <li>Good conditioner, reasonable price.</li>
      <li>It made it easy to brush through.</li>
      <li>It fits easily in the tub or shower, too.</li>
      <li>and I am so pleased I got these fantastic results with such a cheap, great smelling shampoo and conditioner.</li>
      <li>What I love about it: It makes your hair look and feel good, and the amazing scent lasts longer then other conditioners I have used</li>
      <li>I liked it so much I bought the accompanying shampoo.</li>
      <li>like the light, citrus scent and the conditioner itself leaves my hair silky without being weighed down.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This conditioner has a great scent and it actually works!  </li>
      <li>Smells good and made my hair soft</li>
      <li>Love the light fresh scent, the texture, and</li>
      <li>The scent is a little strong to me, except this, everything it&#x27;s good !</li>
      <li>The smell is amazing and leaves my hair soft and shiney!</li>
      <li>and my highlights really stood out. &#x3D;]</li>
      <li>It delivers more real body than any of the pricier name-brand &amp;#34;volumizing&amp;#34; conditioners I&#x27;ve tried over the years, too.</li>
      <li>And the scent is fresh and clean.</li>
      <li>In fact, this particular conditioner is working better for me than some 3x this cost.  </li>
      <li>smells awesome, does not do much for volume in my super limp hair though.</li>
      <li>This did not do an adequate job softening and detangling my color treated hair.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s not your salon quality conditioner but for everyday use, it works great.</li>
      <li>it really does leave my hair soft and manageable, but with amazing volume.  </li>
      <li>so was worth it.</li>
      <li>It complements the shampoo nicely because the shampoo is actually quite drying, so this conditioner returns all the moisture lost.</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair soft and more manageable.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Whether you&#x27;re using conventional shampoo or one of the many &amp;#34;no-poo&amp;#34; methods, this conditional is a lovely addition to your hair care routine, adding volume and tempting scent.</li>
      <li>I use this right after I shampoo my hair at the tips of my hair and leave it on for 5 minutes.</li>
      <li>If you have normal to fine hair, this would probably work for you.</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair soft, shiny and smelling great all day long.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It smells good too, but I don&#x27;t really notice the fragrance as being anything other than &#x27;fresh&#x27; after my hair has dried.&lt;br</li>
      <li>this stuff; it really, really works!</li>
      <li>This is my favorite for during the winter, as my hair tends to need the help with extra body.</li>
      <li>Thanks for leaving the frizz out!</li>
      <li>My husband complimented me on my hair the day after I first used it - he said \\&quot;Your hair likes something you&#x27;d</li>
      <li>The Herbal Essence Body Envy conditioner works as a good, everyday conditioner for me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>smells so good and last for a long time</li>
      <li>The smell to it is very orange scented and with another scent that I can&#x27;t seem to remember</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have very long poker-straight hair w/ an oily scalp and little natural body. This is the only conditioner I&#x27;ve found that delivers just the right amount of smoothness and moisture to the ends of my hair without weighing it down at the roots. It delivers more real body than any of the pricier name-brand &amp;#34;volumizing&amp;#34; conditioners I&#x27;ve tried over the years, too. I use this in combination with the Body Envy shampoo and it always delivers: my hair is full and shiny, bouncy and healthy-looking, and it stays that way longer between washings than it does when I&#x27;ve tried different brands.&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner &amp; shampoo line are the best in my book and I highly recommend them. Don&#x27;t be put off by the low price, ladies. This is one of the few cases where you actually get way more performance-wise than you&#x27;re paying for.&lt;br /&gt;Try this stuff; it really, really works!</li>
    <li> smells so good and last for a long time</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair feeling soft, and it smells great.</li>
    <li> The smell is amazing and leaves my hair soft and shiney!</li>
    <li> Smells good and made my hair soft</li>
    <li> I recently was spending time on Amazon looking for the perfect shampoo to give me volume. Not wanting to spend 50 dollars on a shampoo and conditioner I saw this shampoo + conditioner had really good reviews and was so super cheap! I have long, thick, curly hair that has absolutely no volume to it. After one use there is a notably difference and I am so pleased I got these fantastic results with such a cheap, great smelling shampoo and conditioner. You will not regret it! :)</li>
    <li> This conditioner has a great scent and it actually works!  Noticed a considerable difference in hair volume within a couple days of use.</li>
    <li> I love everything about this conditioner. I use this along with the body envy shampoo and my hair has never looked better. It leaves my hair soft, shiny and smelling great all day long. I have poker straight hair and since I started using this, my hair is softer and a lot easier to manage. It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all. I have way more volume and bounce than ever before! This shampoo and conditioner truly are amazing and produce awesome results! I highly recommend using them together.</li>
    <li> This did not do an adequate job softening and detangling my color treated hair. I did not notice any volumizing from this product, either. If you have normal to fine hair, this would probably work for you.</li>
    <li> The Herbal Essence Body Envy conditioner works as a good, everyday conditioner for me.&lt;br /&gt;I have long, color treated hair and splurge once or twice a week using a more expensive treatment conditioner. Otherwise, this is my choice.&lt;br /&gt;I like the light, citrus scent and the conditioner itself leaves my hair silky without being weighed down.&lt;br /&gt;No, it&#x27;s not your salon quality conditioner but for everyday use, it works great.</li>
    <li> Good conditioner, reasonable price. I would actually like to be able to buy a bigger bottle so I am buying less plastic, but maaybe tht would present problems of its own?</li>
    <li> This does everything a conditioner should do: lightweight and moisturizing. It complements the shampoo nicely because the shampoo is actually quite drying, so this conditioner returns all the moisture lost. It also smells amazing and leaves a nice fragrance in your hair throughout the day.  I use this right after I shampoo my hair at the tips of my hair and leave it on for 5 minutes. I&#x27;m knocking off one star because I don&#x27;t see any difference in volume.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Lightweight&lt;br /&gt;-Moisturizing&lt;br /&gt;-Smells amazing&lt;br /&gt;-Inexpensive&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;-No volume change</li>
    <li> A good conditioner if your hair is pretty healthy already and you are looking for tangle control.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner. It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, but I wouldn&#x27;t say it necessarily adds a ton of volume.</li>
    <li> this smells great and gives a fair bit of volume to my fine hair. been buying it for years.</li>
    <li> decided to try a new shampoo and conditioner so i gave this a try. Love it. And the scent is fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> love this product! as always it smells wonderful and leaves my hair soft and shiny</li>
    <li> Love Herbal Essences!!! Every product they make has a wonderful smell and this one is like the rest. Pleasent scent and leaves no residue behind!!</li>
    <li> Smells and works great!</li>
    <li> Does as it promises. Great scent.  Great product.  Happy customer!</li>
    <li> I love this smell. My hair was soft without being weighed down and greasy feeling.  It made it easy to brush through.</li>
    <li> Great conditioner leaves your hair feeling great !! Perfect product at a great price.  Love this and so does my whole family.  Even works great on my long, curly, hard to manage hair.</li>
    <li> great smell, makes you relax and want to take a nap! perfect right before bed&lt;br /&gt;leaves the hair nice and smooth</li>
    <li> Description was of Pack of 2 but only 1 bottle was delivered.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite for during the winter, as my hair tends to need the help with extra body. And the smell is great, too :)</li>
    <li> Herbel Essence has outdone themselves again! Citris Essence leaves hair smelling like a fruity passionate spell of intriguing essence. Hair is smooth and sleek! Thanks for leaving the frizz out!</li>
    <li> smells like a delicious fruit salad</li>
    <li> I really like this conditioner. It leaves my hair soft and more manageable.  It is lightweight and does not weigh my hair down. I love the smell of it. I do not see a difference in the volume but it works well as a conditioner . I do use it along with the Herbal Essences shampoo.I would definitely continue to purchase this.Overall a great product!!</li>
    <li> Smells good. Nice for shaving..</li>
    <li> smells awesome, does not do much for volume in my super limp hair though.</li>
    <li> I used to think I liked this shampoo, but in reality I have noticed it dries my hair out and requires me to use more products post shower.</li>
    <li> What I love about it: It makes your hair look and feel good, and the amazing scent lasts longer then other conditioners I have used before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is about 2ft &amp; 4 inches long and I have highlights, so it&#x27;s hard to find the right hair products.&lt;br /&gt;But this Herbal Essences Body Envy Volumizing Hair Conditioner worked awesome for me and it made my hair so shiny and my highlights really stood out. &#x3D;]&lt;br /&gt;I usually Condition about 1-2 times per week depending on the weather and how humid it is, but 2 days later after I used this and my hair still looked and smelled really good. ^^</li>
    <li> works well but the smell is ok.</li>
    <li> good conditioner, got it on a deal so was worth it. nothing wrong with it, don&#x27;t realize a difference in body per-say, other than general better overall hair health.</li>
    <li> dynamic duo with the shampoo and I can have volume for days!</li>
    <li> Light conditioner that leaves my hair bouncy! Love it!</li>
    <li> Nice, light scent, but doesn&#x27;t get tangles out.  I was a little disappointed and will not get this conditioner again.  I&#x27;ll likely go back Suave.</li>
    <li> This turned out to be a great volumizing conditioner, so much so that I&#x27;m adding it to my &amp;#34;subscribe and save&amp;#34; list. I&#x27;ve been using HairOne cleansing conditioner (it&#x27;s like Wen) for some time now, but it doesn&#x27;t give my very straight hair the volume I can get from a conventional shampoo. My hair was smooth and healthy, but laid too close to the head. Now I cleanse first with the HairOne, then follow with this, even though the other is a conditioner too. The result is all the benefits of the shampoo-free cleansing conditioner, but with the addition of great volume and beautiful scent. I get so many compliments on the scent when I use this conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether you&#x27;re using conventional shampoo or one of the many &amp;#34;no-poo&amp;#34; methods, this conditional is a lovely addition to your hair care routine, adding volume and tempting scent. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Quick shipping great price Great product</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT. ARRIVED ON TIME. WILL PURCHASE AGAIN.</li>
    <li> Works great to increase volume. My significant other uses this on his thinning hair and he noticed his hair looks fuller.</li>
    <li> This conditioner really does moisturize my hair the way that I want it to. The smell to it is very orange scented and with another scent that I can&#x27;t seem to remember and I love how the bottle looks. After using this conditioner for about a month(since I ordered like in between that time), I have noticed that my hair is moisturized and smells wonderful as well.</li>
    <li> I love Herbal Essences, and this one is no let down.  I love the smell!!</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a revitalizing conditioner that doesn&#x27;t create heavy build-up, has a fresh, pleasing scent and is reasonably priced, you may want to try this Herbal Essences volumizing hair conditioner. I tried it and love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read an article by a dermatologist who wrote that you don&#x27;t need to spend much for high end beauty products because the large companies, like Proctor &amp; Gamble who makes this conditioner, spend a lot of money on R &amp; D and offer the equivalent quite often for less money. This conditioner exceeds my expectations. Love the light fresh scent, the texture, and how my hair responds to it. I liked it so much I bought the accompanying shampoo. My hair does look thicker when I use it. This conditioner doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue like other conditioners do. It&#x27;s a great product in terms of quality, appearance and price. It fits easily in the tub or shower, too.</li>
    <li> The scent is a little strong to me, except this, everything it&#x27;s good !</li>
    <li> The conditioner works much better than the shampoo. It&#x27;s moisturizing and smells great.</li>
    <li> Great conditioner!  This is my favorite conditioner ever- it really does leave my hair soft and manageable, but with amazing volume.  My husband complimented me on my hair the day after I first used it - he said \\&quot;Your hair likes something you&#x27;d paint.\\&quot;  It was the waves- it really defined my natural waves and left my hair shiny and bouncy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells good too, but I don&#x27;t really notice the fragrance as being anything other than &#x27;fresh&#x27; after my hair has dried.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a fairly thick conditioner, somewhere between a lotion and a cream.  It is very good to help get out tangles too-  I just put it on my wet hair, then remove the tangles, and then rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is very long, and while I do like their long hair envy version of conditioner, I think this one works the best of all.  In fact, this particular conditioner is working better for me than some 3x this cost.  It&#x27;s a keeper!</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair clean and shiny, and most importantly smelling great. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Smells great and love the smoothness!</li>
