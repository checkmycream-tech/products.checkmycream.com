      <li>Wonderful!</li>
      <li>Outstanding!!!</li>
      <li>Works great on both.......</li>
      <li>This is a really great product.</li>
      <li>Feels great after shampooing.</li>
      <li>Great shampoo as all the Pantene products are.</li>
      <li>The shampoo gives good body and works well.  </li>
      <li>I love this shampoo!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really an amazing shampoo!&lt;br</li>
      <li>It lathers well, smells nice, and adds NO weight to your hair.</li>
      <li>This particular brand and type is perfect!</li>
      <li>I have very fine wavy hair.</li>
      <li>Love this shampoo and the matching conditioner.  </li>
      <li>shampoos I bought, and I prefer fewer chemicals, but it turned out to be my favorite--</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>Had this one before and thought it was better.</li>
      <li>They match my favorite conditioners--Suave and VO5.</li>
      <li>Really pleased.  </li>
      <li>took off a star because I don&#x27;t know if it is cruelty free - probably not which makes me almost not buy it.</li>
      <li>These two are silicone-free, deep cleansers that smell great and lather AMAZING, so I don&#x27;t have to use as much as I do with Suave.</li>
      <li>great to give hair extra body!</li>
      <li>Pro-V Sheer Volume shampoo seems to do the best job of all, leaving my hair very clean but not striped of natural oils.  </li>
      <li>The price is very economical for the job it does.  </li>
      <li>I know they changed the formulas, and I thought the old volume cleaned nicely, but after straying and then coming back, I see why this isca good brand.</li>
      <li>Wow, I forgot what really clean hair was!</li>
      <li>The price was better than the local WalMart.</li>
      <li>I wanted another type of shampoo and conditioner to use and spare daily use of my favorite brand which is also a clarifying shampoo.</li>
      <li>Literally exactly what I needed and much cheaper than a beauty salon.</li>
      <li>I bought the big bottle and am glad.&lt;br /&gt;Unlike the others, it did not have a strong fragrance (a plus), it did not coat hair with thickening?</li>
      <li>, always had fine, striaght hair, now it is white and also seems thinning.  </li>
      <li>This shampoo works very well adding lots of body.</li>
      <li>In a couple of weeks I noticed a real difference.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t holding out much hope.</li>
      <li>Makes lots of suds and really cleans your hair.</li>
      <li>I actually have  body after blow drying and styling and this continues the full feel until I shampoo again.  </li>
      <li>shampoos down through the years and some will do better than others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>If you have fine, thin, hair and need a lot of volume then you will love this brand and get their conditioner that goes with it.</li>
      <li>But I think Pantene is my new thing.</li>
      <li>From the time that I first had hair, it&#x27;s always been thin and very fine.  </li>
      <li>I have a lot of fine limp hair.  </li>
      <li>I was really surprised how manageable my hair was after using the shampoo/conditioner combo.  </li>
      <li>Try it, you might be surprised.</li>
      <li>This is the first time in my 54 years that I can just shampoo my hair, blow dry it some, and go!  </li>
      <li>It styles as well after use as my very expensive shampoo, so this was a great purchase for me.</li>
      <li>Would also clean my gf&#x27;s hair, if she weren&#x27;t an alien.</li>
      <li>When hair dried, it actually stood out from scalp, had shine, feels really clean</li>
      <li>The other high point of this shampoo is that it thoroughly rinses out, leaving no soapy residue.  </li>

<li> And if you are, at least you won&#x27;t be too much &amp;#34;out of pocket.&amp;#34;</li>
<li> My husband likes and uses this shampoo as his hair has thinned as he&#x27;s aged but he likes the one with combination of the shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br</li>
<li> I hope they keep making the volume and detox because I just realized how watered down my fav Suave is in comparison.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t like to use any conditioner except in the dry-est of winter months as this seems to pull my hair down.  </li>
<li> My hair is typically on the oily side.</li>
<li> I had tried very expensive shampoos with no better results so returned to this old standby.</li>
<li> This leaves my hair feeling thick.</li>
<li> I hate using a lot of gel, mousse, or hairspray-makes me breakout, weighs down my hair, or looks bad when you take off a hat.  </li>
<li> I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be too disappointed.  </li>

    <li> Outstanding!!! This is a really great product. My wife has just tried it &amp; now she&#x27;s hooked!! My hair is typically on the oily side. My wife&#x27;s is not. Works great on both.......</li>
    <li> Cleans my hair. Would also clean my gf&#x27;s hair, if she weren&#x27;t an alien. But you can&#x27;t have everything, can you?</li>
    <li> I have a lot of fine limp hair.  I hate using a lot of gel, mousse, or hairspray-makes me breakout, weighs down my hair, or looks bad when you take off a hat.  This is the first time in my 54 years that I can just shampoo my hair, blow dry it some, and go!  I no longer use hair spray or anything!  My bangs and hair doesn&#x27;t get flat all day long.  Now if they can add something for the gray hairs?  It&#x27;s really an amazing shampoo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took off a star because I don&#x27;t know if it is cruelty free - probably not which makes me almost not buy it.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t holding out much hope. Thought thinning hair just came with age. In a couple of weeks I noticed a real difference.</li>
    <li> I wanted another type of shampoo and conditioner to use and spare daily use of my favorite brand which is also a clarifying shampoo. This particular brand and type is perfect! It lathers well, smells nice, and adds NO weight to your hair. It styles as well after use as my very expensive shampoo, so this was a great purchase for me. If you have fine, thin, hair and need a lot of volume then you will love this brand and get their conditioner that goes with it. Wonderful!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m actually buying it for my husband who likes it because it gets his hair &amp;#34;squeaky clean&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Got this and the weekly detox. Wow, I forgot what really clean hair was! I know they changed the formulas, and I thought the old volume cleaned nicely, but after straying and then coming back, I see why this isca good brand. These two are silicone-free, deep cleansers that smell great and lather AMAZING, so I don&#x27;t have to use as much as I do with Suave. They match my favorite conditioners--Suave and VO5. I need thorough cleansing and I definitely get that here. I hope they keep making the volume and detox because I just realized how watered down my fav Suave is in comparison. I use it for a body wash now. But I think Pantene is my new thing. :) Try it, you might be surprised.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo as all the Pantene products are. Makes lots of suds and really cleans your hair. Feels great after shampooing.</li>
    <li> Literally exactly what I needed and much cheaper than a beauty salon. Perfect purchase.</li>
    <li> From the time that I first had hair, it&#x27;s always been thin and very fine.  Both my parents had hair like this and believe it or not, both sets of grandparents.  Genetics are against me!  I&#x27;ve tried various &amp;#34;body&amp;#34; shampoos down through the years and some will do better than others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pantene Pro-V Sheer Volume shampoo seems to do the best job of all, leaving my hair very clean but not striped of natural oils.  I actually have  body after blow drying and styling and this continues the full feel until I shampoo again.  I don&#x27;t like to use any conditioner except in the dry-est of winter months as this seems to pull my hair down.  My husband likes and uses this shampoo as his hair has thinned as he&#x27;s aged but he likes the one with combination of the shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I color my hair and the Pantene Pro-V doesn&#x27;t harm or remove the color.  The other high point of this shampoo is that it thoroughly rinses out, leaving no soapy residue.  The price is very economical for the job it does.  I had tried very expensive shampoos with no better results so returned to this old standby.</li>
    <li> I have very fine wavy hair. This shampoo works very well adding lots of body.</li>
    <li> This leaves my hair feeling thick.</li>
    <li> Adds volume compared to regular shampoos.</li>
    <li> The shampoo gives good body and works well.  The price was better than the local WalMart.</li>
    <li> great to give hair extra body!</li>
    <li> Bought  about 5 &amp;#34;volumizing&amp;#34; shampoos at same time and proceeded to try them one at a time.  I am senior, always had fine, striaght hair, now it is white and also seems thinning.  This is the best shampoo of the bunch.  Really pleased.  I bought the big bottle and am glad.&lt;br /&gt;Unlike the others, it did not have a strong fragrance (a plus), it did not coat hair with thickening? agents, did not make scalp itch, lathers and rinses well, did not leave hair laying flat against scalp.  When hair dried, it actually stood out from scalp, had shine, feels really clean and I think I can go 2-3 days without shampooing again.  I saved this for last because it is not one of the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; shampoos I bought, and I prefer fewer chemicals, but it turned out to be my favorite-- the one I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo and the matching conditioner.  I was really surprised how manageable my hair was after using the shampoo/conditioner combo.  Since the shampoo and conditioner are &amp;#34;drugstore brand priced&amp;#34; almost anyone can afford to give the pair a try.  I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be too disappointed.  And if you are, at least you won&#x27;t be too much &amp;#34;out of pocket.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I will return to using COSTCO&#x27;s Pantene shampoo. Had this one before and thought it was better. It is not.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo! Always have!&lt;br /&gt;Mrs Hambone</li>
