      <li>It&#x27;s an effective product, having the desired effect in my gastro processes, and it arrived here in good condition and surprisingly quickly..  </li>
      <li>Her pain made me cry with her so many nights.  </li>
      <li>and I take more if I feel the need throughout the day.  </li>
      <li>I have ordered this many times now.</li>
      <li>Love the smell, texture etc..</li>
      <li>but now I&#x27;m using Aloe Life&#x27;s Stomach Aloe formula which is much more agreeable(not</li>
      <li>swear by this stuff and love having it on hand</li>
      <li>I know many others have commented on the taste.</li>
      <li>but I like the taste better and felt like it worked a lot better with my stomach issues, so to me</li>
      <li>It costs more</li>
      <li>I was able to eat spicy food again.</li>
      <li>but I can&#x27;t say for sure that it&#x27;s helping me, just seems like it.</li>
      <li>This is more.  </li>
      <li>I have been able to do this by changing my diet and by taking this Aloe juice.  </li>
      <li>Thia is a great natural substitute (and frankly, more effective one) than liquid antacids.</li>
      <li>probably is causing most of my problems)</li>
      <li>I wanted to like this brand better to save money</li>
      <li>I am able to sleep without getting acid reflux.</li>
      <li>I have had stomach acid control for  problems years , tried many supplements and medicines , but a cap full Aloe Vera Gel-Stomach gives me quick relief , doesn&#x27;t taste good , but it works .</li>
      <li>&quot; was an understatement.lol I have a strong gag reflex</li>
      <li>It will go down just fine and work just as great!  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this wonderful, natural product.</li>
      <li>First, it doesn&#x27;t taste all that great, but that really isn&#x27;t a problem for me.</li>
      <li>Maybe because i drink earthy teas and like sprouts the taste seems just fine to me?  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Lot of complaints about the flavor - in my opinion, its fine.</li>
      <li>and I am pain free all</li>
      <li>Took one shot of this, &amp; I could not believe I was pain free a 1/2 hour</li>
      <li>works great, it actually healed the damaged intestines.</li>
      <li>but it is amazing and works so fast.</li>
      <li>Great healthy alternative to Pepcid, tums and other medicine.</li>
      <li>even so, I&#x27;m trying to power through because it had such an amazing outcome!</li>
      <li>Definitely worth a try!</li>
      <li>I was willing to pay more because I specifically did NOT want mint.  </li>
      <li>She takes a full shot of it before breakfast and after school.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re probably doing me some good, but I have definitely noticed that they don&#x27;t address my stomach</li>
      <li>My doctor says ameprazole is not really bad for the joints.</li>
      <li>I asked if there was something I could mix it with to quell the taste, and she and I discussed a number of possibilities, but in the end, she said it&#x27;s probably best just to slug it down fast and then drink something afterwards to get the taste out of my mouth.  </li>
      <li>and it is quick and does the trick.  </li>
      <li>I take it 3 times a day before meals and it helped me tremendously.</li>
      <li>This product has helped me tremendously with digestive issues and has also helped my kids.  </li>
      <li>I am African American and this product was perfect for moisturizing the hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Keeps my mild IBS at bay.</li>
      <li>Thanks, your product has made a huge improvement in our lives.</li>
      <li>I think this has all the right ingredients.</li>
      <li>would smooth this through my hair just after a wash, and it made my hair very soft and manageable.</li>
      <li>The first day I needed 12 shots spaced through out the day.</li>
      <li>It seems to work on the problems that cause the acid reflux in the first place.  </li>
      <li>like I had to at first.  </li>
      <li>I was taking regular aloe juice by Lily of the Valley, but this seems better.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend for anyone!!</li>
      <li>I may yet try to just \\&quot;slug it down\\&quot; as she suggested, but I certainly would never buy it again.</li>
      <li>within a few days I was feeling much better!</li>
      <li>I dont mind rating products, but putting requirements on the wording and title makes it very bothersome.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Thanks...  </li>
      <li>I wouldnt drink a glass of it for fun, but its far from gag-inducing.</li>
      <li>Thanks, Michele</li>
      <li>I really wanted this product to work.</li>
      <li>The pain was so intense</li>
      <li>Like a very tangy Kaopectate (sp?)</li>
      <li>Has really helped with my stomach upsets.</li>
      <li>and it worked really well.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I really wanted this to work.</li>
      <li>I feel this product is much better because it helps relieve a sour stomach or whenever one feels bloated because you ate too much.</li>
      <li>Here is the deal Short and sweet.</li>
      <li>It should be taken every day for better health down below.</li>
      <li>If you do that it really does not taste as bad as you had imagined.  :D</li>
      <li>Price is good for what you get, the bottle last a long time, now I can have a extra cup of coffee</li>
      <li>I highly recommend the product.</li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t worth sending it back</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s worth the extra money.</li>
      <li>Take a shot before big meals or right after.</li>
      <li>wow did it work!</li>
      <li>The taste varies: sometimes it is sweet, sometimes it is bitter.</li>
      <li>Chilled in the fridge, a few tablespoons are easy drinking, and it works so well,</li>
      <li>I was really hoping to like this aloe vera concentrate because it was 10$ cheaper than the similar product by Aloe Life</li>
      <li>When my daughter was 6, she had severe GIRD (acid reflux) complete with esophageal erosion.  </li>
      <li>I also learned that slippery elm bark is a natural digestive aid that has been used for centuries.  </li>
      <li>I have tried aloe too but never really had 100% success.  </li>
      <li>The stuff worked fine, but the company has two different products on Amazon, one that&#x27;s mint flavored (costing less) and this one.  </li>
      <li>I drink it right down.  </li>
      <li>I eat healthfully, generally, although different in taste it is by no means repulsive.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My stomach has always been the \\&quot;reactant\\&quot; part of my system.  Recently I had some bloating/indigestion that it seemed I just couldn&#x27;t get rid of.  Cutting back on coffee helped a little, but not much.  I found this product and it took care of the problem within just a few days.  Since then, I&#x27;ve tried other products that are predominantly aloe juice, rather than the stomach formula.  They&#x27;re probably doing me some good, but I have definitely noticed that they don&#x27;t address my stomach symptoms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding the taste - the peppermint flavor is dominant.  Compared to the others I&#x27;ve tried, this formula seems slightly less vile.  I&#x27;ve gone through 3-4 bottles of aloe vera juice, all different brands, in the last couple of months.  What they all have in common is their viscosity!  I keep the juice in the fridge as directed and as I slam my morning shot, I always feel like I&#x27;m downing a giant shot of chilled SPIT.</li>
    <li> Thia is a great natural substitute (and frankly, more effective one) than liquid antacids. In fact, it has succeeded when the famous OTC pills have failed. It does the job, quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lot of complaints about the flavor - in my opinion, its fine. I wouldnt drink a glass of it for fun, but its far from gag-inducing. Chilled in the fridge, a few tablespoons are easy drinking, and it works so well, the flavor to me begins to taste like relief. On my third bottle. A go-to.</li>
    <li> I bought this hoping to heal sores caused by acid reflux. wow did it work! within a few days I was feeling much better! my only issue is the awful awful taste. reading the other reviews: \\&quot;be prepared for the horrible taste\\&quot; was an understatement.lol I have a strong gag reflex so it&#x27;s hard for me to get this down. even so, I&#x27;m trying to power through because it had such an amazing outcome!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve haven&#x27;t been taking the product long enough to give a rating at this time.  Product has a good taste. I can&#x27;t compare the product with anything at this time, have&#x27;t had another to compare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;J.B</li>
    <li> I was really hoping to like this aloe vera concentrate because it was 10$ cheaper than the similar product by Aloe Life [[ASIN:B00028OSKS Herbal Aloe Stomach Plus formula - 32 oz - Liquid]]. Unfortunately, despite similar ingredients this one tastes horrible while the Aloe Life one is actually pretty good. It has a weird soapy kind of taste, and I&#x27;m actually not sure if it&#x27;s from the aloe or the calcium they add. It tastes similar to dissolved tums or chalk. I don&#x27;t even know why they add calcium to this mix of all things. I wanted to like this brand better to save money but I think my taste buds will probably drive me towards the other brand in the future.</li>
    <li> I think this has all the right ingredients. But it&#x27;s bitter as heck and really hard to take the two tablespoons. I did finish it eventually but now I&#x27;m using Aloe Life&#x27;s Stomach Aloe formula which is much more agreeable(not awesome) and just as effective. I also found that this formula made it harder on my GERD symptoms (burning sensation).</li>
    <li> My daughter has GERD and was prescribed all sorts of nasty meds none of which were particularly helpful.  I found this product in my local Kroger and it has been like a little miracle for her.  We dumped the pharmaceuticals and now use only &amp;#34;Lily Juice&amp;#34;, as she calls it. She takes a full shot of it before breakfast and after school. Thanks, your product has made a huge improvement in our lives.</li>
    <li> Has really helped with my stomach upsets. I use this along with licorice root drops &amp; have had relief from &#x27;leakey gut&#x27; symptoms. The mint flavor helps but it is a bit vile.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because I wanted to discontinue my acid reducing OTC meds.  I have been able to do this by changing my diet and by taking this Aloe juice.  I am still not willing to give up my coffee(which probably is causing most of my problems) but this juice seems to be neutralizing it, at least.  I don&#x27;t mind the taste at all.  It&#x27;s not delicious, but not bad.  Based on the other reviews, I was expecting to dread taking it.</li>
    <li> Helps digestive system, can help keep you regular. It is also helpful with heartburn. The Taste is tart but ok/pallatable.</li>
    <li> I have had a lot of GI issues this year and was desperate for some natural healing.  This stuff seems to help.  I was taking regular aloe juice by Lily of the Valley, but this seems better.  At first I found the taste pretty bad.  Like a very tangy Kaopectate (sp?) if you know what that is.  For some reason tho, I actually sort of like the taste now, which is really weird.  I think it&#x27;s because I know it&#x27;s helping?  I don&#x27;t even chase it with juice like I had to at first.  Good Stuff!  Would give it a 5* but I can&#x27;t say for sure that it&#x27;s helping me, just seems like it.</li>
    <li> Dealing with stomach ulcers &amp; gastritis last night, &amp; couldn&#x27;t sleep, with my stomach swelling in size: Took one shot of this, &amp; I could not believe I was pain free a 1/2 hour later!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well done Lilly... They know what they are doing. All other remedies I&#x27;ve tried to relieve gastritis have not worked nearly as well as this. I am beyond impressed. I&#x27;m actually still a little shocked.</li>
    <li> Here is the deal Short and sweet.My doctor says ameprazole is not really bad for the joints. I disagree. Drink this horrid potion instead! Take a shot before big meals or right after. It should be taken every day for better health down below. The taste varies: sometimes it is sweet, sometimes it is bitter. Shake it up! AS usual, I don&#x27;t review it unless I try it.</li>
    <li> I have had stomach acid control for  problems years , tried many supplements and medicines , but a cap full Aloe Vera Gel-Stomach gives me quick relief , doesn&#x27;t taste good , but it works . Price is good for what you get, the bottle last a long time, now I can have a extra cup of coffee and it gives me trouble I have a way to put a stop to it.</li>
    <li> My wife had an immediate improvement with stomach acid and reflux. She also started taking less medication for acid reflux.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However it tastes terrible.</li>
    <li> I am African American and this product was perfect for moisturizing the hair.&lt;br /&gt;I would smooth this through my hair just after a wash, and it made my hair very soft and manageable. I also use this on my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> I have been dealing with horrible acid reflux for almost three years, have had an endoscopy, modified my diet, tried many different OTC and prescription solutions to no avail. The medicine side effects were sometimes worse than the GERD!  I have tried aloe too but never really had 100% success.  Recently I did a little research and discovered this aloe on steroids!  I also learned that slippery elm bark is a natural digestive aid that has been used for centuries.  Its addition here is brilliant. I know many others have commented on the taste. Frankly, I look forward to it every morning. I eat healthfully, generally, although different in taste it is by no means repulsive.  Maybe because i drink earthy teas and like sprouts the taste seems just fine to me?  I would eat dirt if it had the same affects as this MIRACLE!  I have been taking 2T prior to each meal and I take more if I feel the need throughout the day.  I highly recommend this wonderful, natural product.</li>
    <li> Alright to be honest, the seller sent this promptly and I would order again if I ever need it.. I ordered it to help with H-pyloria.. I am not an oil person.. It is hard to swollow, but for those who have no problem with it.. It is an excellent product in cooking, hair, etc.. Love the smell, texture etc..</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. Keeps my mild IBS at bay. I usually use it for a week (every meal), to get back on track. I cannot recommend this product enough to anyone who suffers with stomach/intestinal discomfort.</li>
    <li> I have had to take Prilosec or something like it for years.  I tried this stomach formula and it is a miracle juice! Sure, it doesn&#x27;t taste great but I don&#x27;t care about that - it&#x27;s over in a second.  I drink it right down.  I DO NOT have to take Prilosec anymore.  I also take a couple other kinds of aloe juice as I completely believe that, just as it heals the outside of your body, it heals the inside as well!  Definitely worth a try!</li>
    <li> works great, it actually healed the damaged intestines. I was able to eat spicy food again. I still need to stay off alcohol and coffee though as they bring back the heart burn. It might be little hard on you teeth, if they are sensitive. Had it twice a day for a month and it worked really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use to take acid ease and I&#x27;m off from that and started taking this and it cured my symptoms and providing relief  as opposed to  just providing me relief with other medications</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m searching for a product that will stop or ease heartburn and/or acid reflux.  The description of this product met that search.  I ordered it, only to find that Aloe Vera Juice Stomach Formula  is the worst tasting \\&quot;medicine\\&quot; that has ever passed between my lips.  It was so bad, in fact, that I called the number on the bottle and told the person that answered how dreadful the taste was.  She agreed with me!  I asked if there was something I could mix it with to quell the taste, and she and I discussed a number of possibilities, but in the end, she said it&#x27;s probably best just to slug it down fast and then drink something afterwards to get the taste out of my mouth.  She says it works.  I have no reason not to believe her.  But I just can&#x27;t get past the taste.  I may yet try to just \\&quot;slug it down\\&quot; as she suggested, but I certainly would never buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have to agree that this stuff tastes nasty ... but it is amazing and works so fast. I have an ulcer and a hiatal hernia. The pain was so intense I thought I was having a heart attack. My doctor ruled out a heart attack and started ordering tests to find the source of my pain. In the meantime I read about this and ordered some. Within one minute of the first nasty tasting shot the pain went away. The first day I needed 12 shots spaced through out the day. After 1 week one 2 oz shot in the morning and I am pain free all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I swear by this stuff and love having it on hand (just gave a bottle to my Mother-in-law).  I told her to imagine the worse tasting stuff in the world and take a shot followed by water. If you do that it really does not taste as bad as you had imagined.  :D</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an effective product, having the desired effect in my gastro processes, and it arrived here in good condition and surprisingly quickly..  Thanks...  jn</li>
    <li> I want to start by saying, do yourself a favor and drink this with apple or grape juice. Anything besides citrus.  It will go down just fine and work just as great!  Chasing it with water could deter you from trying it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I commented on other&#x27;s reviews and decided that mine was loooong over due.  This has been an amazing staple in my family.  When my daughter was 6, she had severe GIRD (acid reflux) complete with esophageal erosion.  I gave her this and a great enzyme and after six months of her having nightly attacks feeling she was burning from the inside out (we would be up until like 2am every morning)... she got relief.  She was on adult dosages of Prevacid and two other drugs for approximately 4-5 months.  Her pain made me cry with her so many nights.  But natural was the best way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whenever I have heart burn I take it also and it is quick and does the trick.  The aloe also helps to heal the damage the acid causes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also this along with something like fennel is great for ulcer sufferers.</li>
    <li> The stuff worked fine, but the company has two different products on Amazon, one that&#x27;s mint flavored (costing less) and this one.  I was willing to pay more because I specifically did NOT want mint.  Lo and behold, it comes in the mail and what I had didn&#x27;t match the picture--it was the mint flavored one!  It wasn&#x27;t worth sending it back so I still used it and it seemed to work well for me, I just wish I would&#x27;ve known before I bought it.  My favorite kind of Aloe Vera Juice is the Aloe Life - Herbal Aloe Stomach Plus Formula.  It costs more but I like the taste better and felt like it worked a lot better with my stomach issues, so to me it&#x27;s worth the extra money.</li>
    <li> Actually helps with gastritis. Allows one to stay awa from pharmaceutical problems which have long term negative effects. Thanks, Michele</li>
    <li> I really wanted this product to work. It, in short did not. I got past the weird taste by drinking it right out of the bottle from the fridge. You do get used to it. But it didnt work for the horrible reflux and throat burn I was having suddenly... I even stopped taking it for a week and tried again today and it wasnt so great. Perhaps the PH and my body dont agree.&lt;br /&gt;I am also trying marshmallow and licorice along with manuka honey.</li>
    <li> My mother in law uses this to settling her stomach. It has help immensely.</li>
    <li> I have taken numerous prescription drugs for my gastrointestinal problems, they all have side effects and may or may not actually help. This AV stomach formula works for stomach and colon trouble and no side effects. It is a solution that heals rather than just treats. I don&#x27;t even mind the taste, in fact once you know what it can do for you, the taste is welcome.</li>
    <li> I really wanted this to work. I&#x27;ve been suffering from Gerd for quite a long time. It seems that the pills work in the morning, but during the evening, my GERD returns. So, I thought about trying this stuff. First, it doesn&#x27;t taste all that great, but that really isn&#x27;t a problem for me. Rather, every time I use it, I feel queasy and nauseated. Oh, well, back to the drawing board.</li>
    <li> I have stomach problems and had heard that the aloe vera juice might work.  It does seem to help with the burning and irritation.  The taste is not that bad either.</li>
    <li> Great! I dont mind rating products, but putting requirements on the wording and title makes it very bothersome.&lt;br /&gt;I can sum it up in just a few words.</li>
    <li> This product has helped me tremendously with digestive issues and has also helped my kids.  It sooths indigestion and promotes regularity.  Highly recommend for anyone!!</li>
    <li> I have ordered this many times now. I have severe stomach problems and I had heard that aloe vera is good for the tummy.  Well, this stuff works wonders for me. If my stomach is hurting, burning after eating I take the recommended dose and it always takes away the pain!</li>
    <li> I had problems for couple of months with acid reflux &amp; food coming up. This stuff is God-sent. I take it 3 times a day before meals and it helped me tremendously. So thankful for it! Great healthy alternative to Pepcid, tums and other medicine.</li>
    <li> if you can get past the taste this stuff really works..you have to take as directed..i gave it a four star because of the taste! great product</li>
    <li> It tastes awful. However, it works. I get acid reflux whenever I eat after 8 p.m. I drink about 2 to 4 oz. And, follow it up with 2 ounces of a 100% fruit juice. Then, I drink bottled water. I am able to sleep without getting acid reflux. I highly recommend the product. I was purchasing Aloe Cure through the mail but they raised the price. I use to pay $50 for 6 16 oz. bottles. Then, they reduced the purchase to 4 bottles for $50.  I now, pay $47.00 which includes s/h. for 4 32 oz. bottles of this product and it works the same. I feel this product is much better because it helps relieve a sour stomach or whenever one feels bloated because you ate too much.</li>
    <li> This product works!  I recently began to suffer from acid reflux and did not wish to use any non-natural products.  Some are actually very bad for your health and simply mask symptoms.  This is more.  It seems to work on the problems that cause the acid reflux in the first place.  Try it!</li>
