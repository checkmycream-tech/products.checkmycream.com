<ol>
      <li>Best product I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
      <li>NuVie is a wonderful product for my skin.</li>
      <li>Very good product.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how the &#x27;&#x27;dispute&amp;#34; will turn out, but I will say I had already started using the Nerium products with great results.</li>
      <li>I too ordered the trial for $4.95, and was able to cancel before the 14 days were up!  </li>
      <li>I will say, however, that I have had incredible success with this product.  </li>
      <li>I have had great success with that product as well.  </li>
      <li>Buyer Beware for Sure.  </li>
      <li>Glad I read these reviews.  </li>
      <li>this product promises &amp; I&#x27;ve been using it for more than 30 days.</li>
      <li>If you want something fantastic check the Nerium website and get the 5 day samples that are free and see for yourself!</li>
      <li>I also was duped into getting this product, but I didn&#x27;t read the fine print that I would have to cancel before 14 days</li>
      <li>Break out is the only effect that I experienced</li>
      <li>Thank you  for the free trial.</li>
      <li>I also felt scammed after buying with the free trial, and not realizing the $89</li>
      <li>Regardless of how good this product might work (and so far it hasn&#x27;t) I will not do business with a company that treats its customers this way:  </li>
      <li>Thank you so much!!</li>
      <li>I saw this offer on line &amp; evidently when you click &amp;#34;claim my trial offer,&amp;#34</li>
      <li>Glad I found the above review before I ordered it.  </li>
      <li>I should have looked at the reviews first.  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to see if it even does any good, and with a company like this, I never will.</li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t name the very pricey line here, that you can only find in the top department stores, but cut back on it with the exception of their toner first.  </li>
      <li>I used Nuvie for three days and people randomly,  I didn&#x27;t even know, as well as, friends and family began complimenting on how beautiful my skin looked.  </li>
      <li>I have used one of the top 2 most expensive products since my late 20&#x27;s, and always told that I had beautiful skin with minor wrinkles at age 60.</li>
      <li>I literally had to contact my bank and have a new card issued to me, they will not discontinue this item.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Might have to get a new CC # to make this stop.</li>
      <li>I chose the above rating because I really haven&#x27;t seen much of a difference in my skin.</li>
      <li>Being too busy as a realtor, I didn&#x27;t have time to deal with it.  </li>
      <li>My skin is soft and the wrinkIes are leaving my face.</li>
      <li>and I am 61 years old.  </li>
      <li>I feel completely scammed.  </li>
      <li>On Amazon might be legit but DO NOT deal Directly with them.  </li>
      <li>Like many other of the reviewers, I saw the ad on facebook for a free trial for approximately $4.95, saw nothing about the exorbitant price charged after 15 days and automatic deliveries every month.</li>
      <li>I told them I was going to dispute this, and fortunately for me, me card had been closed out due to &amp;#34;suspicious activity&amp;#34; by the bank.</li>
      <li>I am 78 years old and I am looking much younger</li>
      <li>I have taken care of my skin all this time, so I probably wont see dramatic results, but I love this product.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very good product. I Start seing some result.When combined with the physician formula, it works.</li>
    <li> JUNK!!!! DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY</li>
    <li> Needless to say, I have not seen the results this product promises &amp; I&#x27;ve been using it for more than 30 days. I saw this offer on line &amp; evidently when you click &amp;#34;claim my trial offer,&amp;#34; you are agreeing to pay the $4.95 for the shipping &amp; handling AS WELL AS THE $89.15 PER MONTH UNTIL YOU CANCEL. I called customer service asking for a refund &amp; of course it was after the cancellation period of 14 days. Extremely angry about this &amp; this company has been reported to the BBB!</li>
    <li> [...]    Do NOT purchase from this company.  On Amazon might be legit but DO NOT deal Directly with them.  NUVIE has Horrible customer service practices and refuses to refund your money.  Buyer Beware for Sure.  Not a happy customer.  I am notifying my bank of charge and If it shows up again will contact a Lawyer Im so done with them.</li>
    <li> I used Nuvie for three days and people randomly,  I didn&#x27;t even know, as well as, friends and family began complimenting on how beautiful my skin looked.  At 50 years I&#x27;ll take that!!!  The only thing I was doing different was I had added Nuvie to my daily skincare routine.</li>
    <li> I chose the above rating because I really haven&#x27;t seen much of a difference in my skin. I am an black american and have used the product for approximately  weeks.  I&#x27;m not sure if I haven&#x27;t given it enough time, but I&#x27;m not sold and I purchased based on segment on Dr. Oz</li>
    <li> Never will I buy anything from the Dr Oz ads. They also charged my bank account with out even an e-mail. Was very rude; like it was their money and not yours. And it didn&#x27;t work I guess I made him richer and I kept my wrinkles. Stay away from this mess. Also they will only return half of your money and did I say they were rude.</li>
    <li> What a scam!  Glad I found the above review before I ordered it.  The ad had said shipping and handling was 1.95. After filling out name, address, etc., I was moved to the billing page, where the shipping and handling was 4.95, not $1.95. This prompted me to search for scams regarding this product. Hence I found this review.  Thank you so much!!</li>
    <li> I have contacted this company with several email to discontinue sending this product and do not charge to my account.  Well it never stopped the item from coming to my home and it continues to withdraw money from my account.  I literally had to contact my bank and have a new card issued to me, they will not discontinue this item.  Whatever you do, do not deal with this company.  It is a rip off and will continue to take money out of your account.</li>
    <li> Amazon did not let my 1st review thru. Maybe this one will work.&lt;br /&gt;NuVie did not only not work (might just be water in it??) - but they also keep charging for nothing (no product except for trial offer).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You cannot talk to a human, when calling their number 888-978-2310. But they have an automated voice offering the cancellation for $44.58. Have my doubts, that that will work. My CC is also on this case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Might have to get a new CC # to make this stop. Total loss: $134.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had no idea, I am on autoship - what a deceit and scam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry - posted accidentally the same on some other \\&quot;Wrinkle\\&quot; cream.....but took the comments out.</li>
    <li> Rip off ....customer service is terrible&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t know I was signing off on monthly deliveries BB should shut them down</li>
    <li> I tried it for 2 weeks.  Didn&#x27;t like it at all.  Break out is the only effect that I experienced and I am 61 years old.  It was drying to my skin and did not do anything that was promised.  My skin was not moisturized and tighter.  BOO.  I was sorry I wasted my money.  I should have looked at the reviews first.  Barbara - Clearwater, FL</li>
    <li> I can feel the difference in the softness of my skin without the greasy feeling. I have taken care of my skin all this time, so I probably wont see dramatic results, but I love this product.</li>
    <li> I also was duped into getting this product, but I didn&#x27;t read the fine print that I would have to cancel before 14 days so now my bank account is short 90 dollars and I have a overdraft charge. and the company was not very helpful in returning my money when I said I would return the product. plus I would have to pay 15 dollars for a restocking fee.</li>
    <li> SCAM!  Do not buy this product!  I ordered the trial and called to cancel before the 14 days were up and got billed $89!  I put it in dispute with my credit card and still did not get it resolved.  Plus the product does NOT work.  Save your money and aggravation and do not buy this!</li>
    <li> Personally, I&#x27;m never buying anything again that&#x27;s recommended by Dr. Oz.  Too expensive and don&#x27;t live up to their claims.  Could it be because Dr. Oz is raking in the dough on this sort of thing?  Shame on you, Dr. Oz.</li>
    <li> Like many other of the reviewers, I saw the ad on facebook for a free trial for approximately $4.95, saw nothing about the exorbitant price charged after 15 days and automatic deliveries every month. Since I have internet banking, I happened to notice they were charging my account $89.15 after only 9 days from the order, only 3 days after receiving it! I obtained the number to the company from the bank and immediately called and cancelled and was told I would be issued only a $31.20 refund. The lady said the charge was issued after 15 days from the initial order, and I later realized it had not been 15 days from the order date and called back again, and told I would receive another 15% refund. I told them I was going to dispute this, and fortunately for me, me card had been closed out due to &amp;#34;suspicious activity&amp;#34; by the bank. I plan to contact the company again and ship the remainder of the product back. I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to see if it even does any good, and with a company like this, I never will. They are shooting themselves in the foot with this scandalous and deceitful scam. I don&#x27;t know how the &#x27;&#x27;dispute&amp;#34; will turn out, but I will say I had already started using the Nerium products with great results. Its pricey, and that&#x27;s why I wanted a comparison. Well I got my comparison the hard way and will never, ever, do something like this again. I can&#x27;t believe Dr. Oz endorsed this product as some have claimed. Usually he will endorse an ingredient, but never a specific product. I&#x27;ll have to check his web site to verify this for myself. If you want something fantastic check the Nerium website and get the 5 day samples that are free and see for yourself!</li>
    <li> I also felt scammed after buying with the free trial, and not realizing the $89+ charge they automatically charged within 14 days, then then the next shipment I received at $89+.  Being too busy as a realtor, I didn&#x27;t have time to deal with it.  I will say, however, that I have had incredible success with this product.  After using for just a few days, two large stretch marks on the sides of my face are totally disappearing, (from weight loss and gain), as well as other small wrinkles around my mouth.  I have used one of the top 2 most expensive products since my late 20&#x27;s, and always told that I had beautiful skin with minor wrinkles at age 60. I won&#x27;t name the very pricey line here, that you can only find in the top department stores, but cut back on it with the exception of their toner first.  This is the only change I have made, other than the RXRepair I ordered at the same time, with the same scan.  I have had great success with that product as well.  I am going to continue to use, and the next bottle as well, eliminating my other EXTREMELY pricey products until gone, then make my final decision.  I am truly amazed at what a difference I have since in about a week&#x27;s time!  So for all of the people with one star, I&#x27;m giving it a 5!</li>
    <li> Glad I read these reviews.  I too ordered the trial for $4.95, and was able to cancel before the 14 days were up!  I like the product, but not that much, it is way too expensive.</li>
    <li> My skin is soft and the wrinkIes are leaving my face. I am 78 years old and I am looking much younger every day.&lt;br /&gt;Your NuVie is a wonderful product for my skin. Thank you  for the free trial. Britie</li>
    <li> Horrible company. I feel completely scammed.  No paperwork was sent with product.  Nothing I saw indicated a 14 day cancellation period followed by an $89 monthly fee.  Regardless of how good this product might work (and so far it hasn&#x27;t) I will not do business with a company that treats its customers this way:  underhanded, manipulative.  When I called to cancel my order the customer service rep finally agreed to reduce my charge by 50% when a told her she and her company would be hearing from my attorney. Horrible way to do business.</li>
    <li> Best product I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
