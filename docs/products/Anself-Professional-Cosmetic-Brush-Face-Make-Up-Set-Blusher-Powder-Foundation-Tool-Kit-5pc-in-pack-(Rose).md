    <li> Personally not a big fan of these makeup brushes. Took well over a month for them to get delivered to my door. The bristles on the brush are way too soft to apply powder or blush. Good shape but not sturdy enough to be useful. I suggest looking elsewhere.</li>

    <li> I got them earlier than expected... Maybe a week after I ordered. You can not choose a color so I got the orange ones with I&#x27;m fine with. They remind me of the real technique brushes with the look of them.The packaging when is is is good the is plastic wrap to keep the hairs in place. The brush doesn&#x27;t drop hair and the brush is SOOO soft!!! These are definitely must for face brushes!!</li>
    <li> Love these brushes ! Really good quality. I use them everyday!</li>

    <li> brushes are not dense enough to pick up or blend makeup products. save your money and don&#x27;t buy these!</li>
