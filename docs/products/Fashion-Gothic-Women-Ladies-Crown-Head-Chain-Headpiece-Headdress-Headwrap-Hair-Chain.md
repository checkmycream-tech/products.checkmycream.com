      <li>gets tangled but cute</li>
      <li>It worked out just fine and was a GREAT gift to a friend that was getting married.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s super cute!</li>
      <li>It looks ok, but the metal is very bright therefor obviously an inexpensive piece.</li>
      <li>I think it would work just fine.</li>
      <li>but after a quick fix it was ok</li>
      <li>Overall it fits great</li>
      <li>I was really excited for this piece to arrive, I love head crowns and own several.  </li>
      <li>We will add embellishments to enhance further but, for the price, was a good deal.</li>
      <li>I received it early than expected, which is awesome!</li>
      <li>This is very pretty peice.</li>
      <li>However, I ordered it anyway, since it is pretty cheap.</li>
      <li>Very pretty.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted!</li>
      <li>This item is exactly as described and shipped so very fast!</li>
      <li>Came right before the estimated date.</li>
      <li>It broke right away.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very cute and cheap, but the problem is that the metal changes color pretty quickly and makes it look dull</li>
      <li>alright quality for the price though so can&#x27;t really complain!</li>
      <li>I think I paid under $5 for it &amp; its cute for an occasional outfit</li>
      <li>This came quickly is so pretty its not damaged</li>
      <li>Looks exactly like the picture</li>
      <li>Exactly how it looks.</li>
      <li>Really pretty.</li>
      <li>however the sizer broke the first time i tried it</li>
      <li>so it sits higher on my forehead.</li>
      <li>The gold is really pretty</li>
      <li>Honestly I didn&#x27;t like the two sections that came down across the forehead, so I removed those</li>
      <li>and it lays nicely on my head with little effort getting the chains to hang as they should.</li>
      <li>Would have appreciated instructions.  </li>
      <li>Shipped fast and looks fab</li>
      <li>I really like it</li>
      <li>i would have liked itt as a 5 but one of the loops is missing a gold chain</li>
      <li>Wore it once, it&#x27;s a really bright gold and comes off as super fake.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really pretty but don&#x27;t be surprised if it brakes.</li>
      <li>Came in a decent amount of time.</li>
      <li>High quality.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s stunning, but a bit small for me, so I had to use a bobby pin to hold it.</li>
      <li>I wish it wasn&#x27;t bright fake gold colored</li>
      <li>So depends on how big your head is haha.</li>
      <li>you wear your hair straight or with simple waves</li>
      <li>A little small than I thought but still cute!</li>
      <li>For the price the metal seems pretty nice, the only complaint is that is extremely small.  </li>
      <li>Not necessarily but if you have a little head dont get it, it won&#x27;t fit properly.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a cute headband, but when it arrived some parts of it was broken.</li>
      <li>I bought this one in particular (out of other similar ones available on amazon) because I thought it didn&#x27;t have the middle chain part that goes down a middle part, it DOES.</li>
      <li>I usually don&#x27;t write reviews on products, but I thought I should write one and let others know it is totally worth buying.</li>
      <li>but it broke right away :/</li>
      <li>It does however have a chain down the middle for your part and you can see it in the picture of the blond if you look really close.</li>

    <li> made me look very nice however the sizer broke the first time i tried it but after a quick fix it was ok</li>
    <li> This came quickly is so pretty its not damaged i cant wait to wear it to the dreamscape festival</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s Noting Not To Love About This ,Outher Than How Long It Took To Ship</li>
    <li> I wish it wasn&#x27;t bright fake gold colored &amp; it got here with an extra chain on half of it that made it not work so I had to take that piece off...not the end of the world for the price. Its way better then $10 or $20....I think I paid under $5 for it &amp; its cute for an occasional outfit so I recommend it overall.</li>
    <li> Product was damage when I opened the bag</li>
    <li> Love it, perfect for all sizes ( (adjustable))</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so cute! Took about 1 week to get here and I love it</li>
    <li> Took about 3 weeks to get to me. Wore it once, it&#x27;s a really bright gold and comes off as super fake. When I tried to were it a second time it was discolored and had a rusty smell to it. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Very pretty. 😍 Ordered May 17. Came right before the estimated date. 🙌</li>
    <li> This head chain when I got it in the mail and opened it. There&#x27;s like a piece that already broke.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s stunning, but a bit small for me, so I had to use a bobby pin to hold it. So depends on how big your head is haha. Still gorgeous and worth the buy 👍</li>
    <li> Love this. Very unique and the price was great. High quality.</li>
    <li> Product is great! I recommend only people with big heads to purchase this item. Not necessarily but if you have a little head dont get it, it won&#x27;t fit properly. I love it, I wore it two days in a row.  :)</li>
    <li> Did not even get to wear it before it turned black</li>
    <li> I was really excited for this piece to arrive, I love head crowns and own several.  For the price the metal seems pretty nice, the only complaint is that is extremely small.  I do wear my hair in a long afro and my curls are really thick, but the first time I tried to put it on several of the chains snapped.  I was able to re-assemble it, still a let down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you wear your hair straight or with simple waves I think it would work just fine.</li>
    <li> It looks ok, but the metal is very bright therefor obviously an inexpensive piece.</li>
    <li> Looks exactly like the picture and it&#x27;s really bright and cute...I will def. Buy more soon!</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t look like the picture at all</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really pretty but don&#x27;t be surprised if it brakes. One of the pieces broke and it was dangling.</li>
    <li> Exactly how it looks. Love it.</li>
    <li> Really pretty. I like that it&#x27;s adjustable, as I have a smaller head so I was able to move the band in so it sits higher on my forehead. The gold is really pretty and it hangs nicely. I will say, it has a weird thing that runs in the middle of your head, but I just disconnected that because I didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> loved this. didn&#x27;t break on me and i had it for a year. i&#x27;m re-purchasing it now because it turned on me. :( but for the price, it aint s***</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a cute headband, but when it arrived some parts of it was broken. Not something I was expecting.</li>
    <li> The headband was not assembled correctly when I received it in the mail and fell apart when I tried to put it on my head.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to order it, based on what others said. However, I ordered it anyway, since it is pretty cheap. I received it early than expected, which is awesome! The head-piece is perfect so far. I usually don&#x27;t write reviews on products, but I thought I should write one and let others know it is totally worth buying. It is a gorgeous piece and I cannot wait to wear it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very cute and cheap, but the problem is that the metal changes color pretty quickly and makes it look dull..when I got it, it was a nice gold color, but within the span of about a month it&#x27;s now a copper-ish type tint. Not a total waste of money, though. I&#x27;ll still wear it and see if there&#x27;s something I can do about the color.</li>
    <li> I love it fits perfect</li>
    <li> Cute. The price is low so you get what you pay for. Prompt delivery.</li>
    <li> its hard to place in your hair without tangling the chains up! alright quality for the price though so can&#x27;t really complain!</li>
    <li> gets tangled but cute</li>
    <li> Shipped fast and looks fab</li>
    <li> I loved it! It&#x27;s super cute!</li>
    <li> Looks like it&#x27;s a good quality! I like it and get compliments when I wear it. I love that it&#x27;s adjistable .</li>
    <li> This peice is wonderful but if you have a really really small head it isnt for you. It does however have a chain down the middle for your part and you can see it in the picture of the blond if you look really close. Overall it fits great i just cut out that ugly middle chain with kitchen scissors. The chains sit perfectly if you put it on right.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted!</li>
    <li> i would have liked itt as a 5 but one of the loops is missing a gold chain</li>
    <li> This item is exactly as described and shipped so very fast! I have no complaints, just look at the picture and you&#x27;ll see the item you will get. :)</li>
    <li> This is very pretty peice. I had to buy one for my sister. You can ware it in so many ways I do recommend this for any age.</li>
    <li> Got here fast &amp; its great !!</li>
    <li> A little confusing to figure out.  Would have appreciated instructions.  Will work for the purpose we purchased for (Renaissance festival costume).  We will add embellishments to enhance further but, for the price, was a good deal.</li>
    <li> I bought this one in particular (out of other similar ones available on amazon) because I thought it didn&#x27;t have the middle chain part that goes down a middle part, it DOES. All the pictures look like it&#x27;s just the hippy headband piece but nope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simple fix with some needle nose pliers, but annoying that I spent the time looking for one that didn&#x27;t just for this to show up with it. and the picture shown definitely don&#x27;t have it on there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;nice quality for costume jewelry, all links are well connected and it lays nicely on my head with little effort getting the chains to hang as they should.</li>
    <li> It broke right away. Very bad quality but I&#x27;ll give it 3 stars for the prize.</li>
    <li> Beautiful and it makes me look good</li>
    <li> I like it good  buy haven&#x27;t  tried it  on yet</li>
    <li> A little small than I thought but still cute! I really like it</li>
    <li> Honestly I didn&#x27;t like the two sections that came down across the forehead, so I removed those, I also didn&#x27;t like the part down the middle so I also removed that and I absolutely love it, if you don&#x27;t mind the parts across your forehead then this is perfect and it&#x27;s amazing quality it does get tangled when trying to put it on but there is ways too avoid that and it also came a week and a half early ^.^</li>
    <li> Came in a decent amount of time. The head piece is perfect, and doesn&#x27;t look cheap or like costume jewelry. Fits perfectly, can&#x27;t wait to wear it out more often!</li>
    <li> There was a clasp missing on the item. I had an extra clasp that I attached to the Crown Head Chain. It worked out just fine and was a GREAT gift to a friend that was getting married. A few flowers were added to the Crown Head Chain and my friend wore it on her wedding day last weekend.</li>
    <li> I liked it but it broke right away :/</li>
    <li> Very happy with item and seller.</li>
