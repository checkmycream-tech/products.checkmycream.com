      <li>and I just love it</li>
      <li>I am very happy with this toothpaste overall.</li>
      <li>So far so good!</li>
      <li>it is just OK and has a strong mint smell, overpowering...</li>
      <li>The bubbles could be easily pushed out of the screen.</li>
      <li>ENAMAL RENEWAL; and within those, MINT, CLEAN MINT, RADIANT MINT; and even more variations.  </li>
      <li>My husband and I are pretty thrilled.</li>
      <li>Love this Toothpaste, leaves my mouth very clean, and also whitens my teeth, I absolutely love it, and it really really works, It does whitens teeth</li>
      <li>, my  normal toothpaste works really great, but I wanted to try this to brighten up my smile.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using advanced vivid for 2 years now and it is by far the best whitening toothpaste available.  </li>
      <li>I like the all-day smooth feeling I get on my teeth</li>
      <li>This goes great with 3d crest white strips.</li>
      <li>Good product, I can clearly see my teeth whitens after couple of days.</li>
      <li>So for me, this is the most cost effective way to keep my teeth pearly white and free of damage.</li>
      <li>I have been using it in conjunction with the 3D white luxe mouth wash (which I would also give 5 stars) and i am loving the improvement in my teeth!</li>
      <li>and I was excited to have \\&quot;whiter teeth\\&quot;</li>
      <li>Fun!</li>
      <li>this new one &#x27;tastes&#x27; great, just like its advanced vivid &#x27;siblings&#x27;.  </li>
      <li>Super worth the price!</li>
      <li>Brushing with this toothpaste caused more bleeding, swelling, inflammation and very sore gums.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Now as to Crest&#x27;s plethora of \\&quot;3D White\\&quot; toothpastes, which include the following and many versions of them and have as many as eight words in their titles:</li>
      <li>I like that this toothpaste gives you whitening results quickly but also</li>
      <li>I purchased Crest 3D White Advanced toothpaste prevously and liked it.  </li>
      <li>, i would honestly just buy strips next time.</li>
      <li>and my smile is brighter everyone askes were</li>
      <li>so you are only left with the \\&quot;white\\&quot; part...other than this its a great product.</li>
      <li>Maybe it will be as good as what I had previously; I don&#x27;t know.  </li>
      <li>and I even have gotten my 14 year old son to start using it, we all know how much teens and kids love junk food, pizza, soda and candy.</li>
      <li>ADVANCED VIVID, ...</li>
      <li>Whitening strips last 14 days at most</li>
      <li>However, you could see better results if you use it several times a day, atleast twice.</li>
      <li>Overall, I&#x27;m pretty pleased.</li>
      <li>4 stars because it really does whiten your teeth pretty quick but a little pricey for how effective it is</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t believe this product whitens as good as the standard 3d white product tho, so I will be alternating between each to get both benefits!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if it whitened my teeth, because I started using it the same time as Whitestrips, but I am overall very pleased whit this product.</li>
      <li>One thing about white teeth though, when traveling in Europe having a dazzling white smile will mark you as an American and can cause you to be a target of undesirables.</li>
      <li>It also really foams up in your mouth so don&#x27;t use it after you&#x27;ve gotten dressed for the day.</li>
      <li>I noticed my lips were very chapped all day after using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>No wonder toothpaste costs to much.  </li>
      <li>1: First time using this, taste was ok, made a slight foam to coat my whole mouth.</li>
      <li>And there is also no sensitivity with this paste, unlike many other whitening products.  </li>
      <li>It is far better than I expected, and better even than more expensive whitestrips and manages to cover your whole mouth.  </li>
      <li>Both also helped with sensitivity, which I have some mild issues with if I use a regular toothpaste.  </li>
      <li>However, I received another version (more on that later), Crest 3D White Luxe.  </li>
      <li>So nothing new or particularly \\&quot;enamel renewing.\\&quot;</li>
      <li>i would really recommend this to anyone with yellowish teeth or sensitive teeth that need to be whiter.</li>
      <li>I will most definitely be purchasing this again in the near future!!</li>
      <li>While I was brushing, like normal, this made my gums bleed.</li>
      <li>My normal toothpaste hasn&#x27;t caused any issues what so</li>
      <li>It stays looking new for months.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend it to those wanting whiter teeth and when you use it in conjunction with crest professional whitening strips...</li>
      <li>I checked the 3D effects mouthwash and see hydrogen peroxide is the other main ingredient, so i assume this is a mild version of what would be sold as a whitening gel.  </li>
      <li>VIVID RADIANT ...</li>
      <li>For the price, you can&#x27;t find another toothpaste that will keep your teeth white and shiny all day and help clean stains daily when you use it like 3D!</li>
      <li>When it comes out of the tube it is a distinct pattern, the first discrenable as the ordinary witening paste, and the rest is the new whiter paste.  </li>
      <li>This product promises to remove 90% of surface stains in just 7 days, half the time of the regular 3D white, as well as 10% more.  </li>
      <li>I had been using the regular vivid white and prohealth toothpastes before this one, and both worked very well.  </li>
      <li>Here in Ukraine such toothpastes is not, it is now clear why the whole of America goes with white smiles</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 5: I went back to my normal toothpaste after letting my mouth have a break from being so damaged and hurt.</li>
      <li>but this is a product you have to use over and over because it does not last, only a few months but the warning on the label said do not use more than twice a year, not buying this again</li>
      <li>Ordered another flavor and was told this was a new packaging with the &amp;#34;same formula&amp;#34; so why did it taste different ...</li>
      <li>We have been using this product for the past month and we have noticed a significant difference.  </li>
      <li>Crest 3D White VIVID, ....</li>
      <li>I should note that the Prohealth and regular 3d effects toothpaste tended to make my mouth \\&quot;shed\\&quot; which the dentist said was normal and actually renews your mouth.  </li>
      <li>During my travels, I have frequently overheard (as I speak 17 different languages) thuggish looking men and painted women discussing amongst themselves the idea of robbing the &#x27;American with the blinding white teeth.&#x27;.</li>
      <li>At least I didn&#x27;t pay the full price</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a minty toothpaste with a slightly grainy feel to it, so you can really tell it&#x27;s polishing away the stains on your teeth.  </li>

<li> I had slightly darker teeth from drinking Coke Zero in the mornings and not brushing again until night, as well as the normal discoloration on the tops of your teeth that seemed to never go away.  </li>
<li> keeps your teeth white on a daily and long term basis.  </li>
<li> I find the Enamel Renewal feature very helpful, as other whitening toothpastes have hurt my teeth with their harsh products, this one whitens and protects!</li>
<li> The secret seems to be that there is normal 3D white toothpaste that is combined with what is likely hydrogen peroxide gel.  </li>
<li> The other is blue silica-based whitening toothpaste.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used plenty of whitening strips in the past and even those for \\&quot;Sensitive Teeth\\&quot; end up effecting my sensitivity.</li>
<li> Little did I know it&#x27;s just 2 regular toothpastes that stream out of the tube together.</li>
<li> - I only drink coffee a couple times a week, but I do eat a ton of dried cherries, and I&#x27;m trying to prevent any staining from that.</li>
<li> I figured for a few extra dollars</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Here in Ukraine such toothpastes is not, it is now clear why the whole of America goes with white smiles</li>
    <li> I purcshased this because I also ordered Crest whitestrips and I think it&#x27;s great. It tastes very good, minty and fresh (maybe even a bit sweet). I don&#x27;t know if it whitened my teeth, because I started using it the same time as Whitestrips, but I am overall very pleased whit this product.</li>
    <li> I usually buy Crest 3D white anticavity toothpaste but this time I wanted to try enamel renewal. it is just OK and has a strong mint smell, overpowering...which I don&#x27;t like.</li>
    <li> I drink coffee and cranberry juice and this toothpaste keeps my teeth very white. People are always thinking that I go get my teeth whitened, but I never do, this is all I do.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this toothpaste overall. Nice flavor/taste, good mouth-feel, foams nicely, cleans well. You need only about a pea sized amount to get the job done. It keeps my teeth white in between my twice yearly dentist visits. One thing about white teeth though, when traveling in Europe having a dazzling white smile will mark you as an American and can cause you to be a target of undesirables. During my travels, I have frequently overheard (as I speak 17 different languages) thuggish looking men and painted women discussing amongst themselves the idea of robbing the &#x27;American with the blinding white teeth.&#x27;. So, whenever I sense danger, I casually vacate my seat or barstool and, without fanfare, demonstrate some of the many martial arts moves I learned from my sensei master as a youth. It works every time!</li>
    <li> My husband and I have been using this for under a week and we can already see a difference - without experiencing any sensitivity. I&#x27;ve used plenty of whitening strips in the past and even those for \\&quot;Sensitive Teeth\\&quot; end up effecting my sensitivity. Noted, I don&#x27;t have extremely yellow teeth - I only drink coffee a couple times a week, but I do eat a ton of dried cherries, and I&#x27;m trying to prevent any staining from that. So far so good! My husband and I are pretty thrilled. Whitening strips last 14 days at most and you&#x27;re spending over $30 for a good treatment. This toothpaste will likely last a couple of months, and Amazon sends it in a dual pack. So for me, this is the most cost effective way to keep my teeth pearly white and free of damage.</li>
    <li> I wanted a whitening toothpaste but worried about wearing off the non-renewable enamel with all that abrasive silica. So I thought this would be a great solution. Little did I know it&#x27;s just 2 regular toothpastes that stream out of the tube together. One is regular white Crest fluoride toothpaste. The other is blue silica-based whitening toothpaste. So nothing new or particularly \\&quot;enamel renewing.\\&quot; It also really foams up in your mouth so don&#x27;t use it after you&#x27;ve gotten dressed for the day.</li>
    <li> for some reason this was on clearance at my local Wal Mart so I bought one and figured I&#x27;d give it a try. I just quit smoking a month ago. I smoked for 17 years. I drink coffee from time to time, soda, koolaid, fruit juices..... Needless to say my teeth were less than white. Now that I have been using this awesome tooth paste my teeth are visibly whiter!!! The stains are going away and I even have gotten my 14 year old son to start using it, we all know how much teens and kids love junk food, pizza, soda and candy. His teeth look better too11 I will most definitely be purchasing this again in the near future!!</li>
    <li> It stays looking new for months. The bubbles could be easily pushed out of the screen. Super worth the price!</li>
    <li> I used this and it did wonders for my teeth overall whiteness! but this is a product you have to use over and over because it does not last, only a few months but the warning on the label said do not use more than twice a year, not buying this again, i still have some permanent whiteness but not as as i had when i used it at the beginning of the year</li>
    <li> Ordered another flavor and was told this was a new packaging with the &amp;#34;same formula&amp;#34; so why did it taste different ...</li>
    <li> I like the all-day smooth feeling I get on my teeth (I believe from the enamel renewal).  I don&#x27;t believe this product whitens as good as the standard 3d white product tho, so I will be alternating between each to get both benefits!</li>
    <li> We have been using this product for the past month and we have noticed a significant difference.  We did find that as the product diminishes, it becomes harder to get the \\&quot;blue\\&quot; toothpaste out so you are only left with the \\&quot;white\\&quot; part...other than this its a great product.</li>
    <li> Great product. I started to see results after about a week of use. This goes great with 3d crest white strips.</li>
    <li> v v good and a super way to shine your thath and i have realy liked it a v good</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using advanced vivid for 2 years now and it is by far the best whitening toothpaste available.  While one cannot know if i is in fact rebuilding enamel this new one &#x27;tastes&#x27; great, just like its advanced vivid &#x27;siblings&#x27;.  I would highly recommend it to those wanting whiter teeth and when you use it in conjunction with crest professional whitening strips... The results are amazing.</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste.  I am a coffee drinker and I have noticed a difference when I run out of my Crest 3D. I like that this toothpaste gives you whitening results quickly but also keeps your teeth white on a daily and long term basis.  It also tastes good and isn&#x27;t too strong or chemical tasting.  I&#x27;ve been very happy with this toothpaste and I&#x27;ve been using it for about a year.  For the price, you can&#x27;t find another toothpaste that will keep your teeth white and shiny all day and help clean stains daily when you use it like 3D!</li>
    <li> Good product, I can clearly see my teeth whitens after couple of days. However, you could see better results if you use it several times a day, atleast twice.</li>
    <li> yes this worked with the other crest 3d products as well and my smile is brighter everyone askes were did i get it.</li>
    <li> I love how this toothpaste whitens without damaging my teeth. I find the Enamel Renewal feature very helpful, as other whitening toothpastes have hurt my teeth with their harsh products, this one whitens and protects! It&#x27;s double duty. i would really recommend this to anyone with yellowish teeth or sensitive teeth that need to be whiter. It&#x27;s the best of both worlds.</li>
    <li> Love this Toothpaste, leaves my mouth very clean, and also whitens my teeth, I absolutely love it, and it really really works, It does whitens teeth and I just love it, enamel strengthening also working, my teeth feel and look better shinier! :D</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it is the toothpaste or the whitening mouthwash, but I have noticed some whitening to my teeth. Overall, I&#x27;m pretty pleased.</li>
    <li> 4 stars because it really does whiten your teeth pretty quick but a little pricey for how effective it is, i would honestly just buy strips next time. But im sure this keeps my teeth whiter for longer</li>
    <li> Now, I will say that I have only been using this tooth past for 3 or 4 days, but as a college student who has been drinking at least 2 cups of coffee a day since I was 14, I will say that 3 or 4 days in my friends and family have all noticed and commented on the difference in my teeth. I have been using it in conjunction with the 3D white luxe mouth wash (which I would also give 5 stars) and i am loving the improvement in my teeth! I would definitely recommend purchasing.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a minty toothpaste with a slightly grainy feel to it, so you can really tell it&#x27;s polishing away the stains on your teeth.  I used just one tube, three times a day, and after two weeks had several people comment on how white my teeth were.  It might have been my imagination, but it felt ever so slightly tingly, too.  Fun!</li>
    <li> I purchased Crest 3D White Advanced toothpaste prevously and liked it.  So when I got to the last tube I had, I went to Amazon to reorder, found the product, and placed the order with this seller.  However, I received another version (more on that later), Crest 3D White Luxe.  Maybe it will be as good as what I had previously; I don&#x27;t know.  I do know that I don&#x27;t like ordering one product and receiving another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now as to Crest&#x27;s plethora of \\&quot;3D White\\&quot; toothpastes, which include the following and many versions of them and have as many as eight words in their titles: Crest 3D White VIVID, ....ADVANCED VIVID, ...VIVID RADIANT ...LUXE, ... GLAMOUROUS, ...LUXE GLAMOUROUS, ENAMAL RENEWAL; and within those, MINT, CLEAN MINT, RADIANT MINT; and even more variations.  WHY?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is Crest just throwing them all out on the market to see which sells the best?  Is it all about the name, the box, WHAT?  No wonder toothpaste costs to much.  They are spending a fortune producing all these \\&quot;versions,\\&quot; which may all be the same formula.  Beats me.  Think I will just avoid Crest until they make up their mind, assuming they have one.</li>
    <li> This was unsafe for me, and I wonder if others have had the same issues I have. I don&#x27;t understand how this can be on the market as safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this because it was on sale and I was excited to have \\&quot;whiter teeth\\&quot;, my  normal toothpaste works really great, but I wanted to try this to brighten up my smile. Here is what happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 1: First time using this, taste was ok, made a slight foam to coat my whole mouth. While I was brushing, like normal, this made my gums bleed. I thought it would be a one time thing, but it was not. I noticed my lips were very chapped all day after using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 2: Second time using this toothpaste. My gums bled again, and after using this they were puffy, inflamed, swollen, red and bloody in general. They stayed swollen, and red all day and became tender and sore. I also noticed I was drooling today, like my mouth just wasn&#x27;t acting normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 3: Third time using; I thought I should try one last time to see what happened. Brushing with this toothpaste caused more bleeding, swelling, inflammation and very sore gums. That night when I took an up close look at my gums I was shocked. They were receding, that was shocking, they looked really terrible, I called them \\&quot;zombie gums\\&quot; because they looked sort of dead, with little white chucks just sloughing off. They were red, but like a old blood red, they were very strangely veiny and spidery, they hurt very badly all day, and caused me discomfort all day. Once I saw this that was it for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 5: I went back to my normal toothpaste after letting my mouth have a break from being so damaged and hurt. My gums don&#x27;t look that great still but the soreness has gone down. My normal toothpaste hasn&#x27;t caused any issues what so ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never put anything Crest makes into my mouth ever again. I can only imagine what would have happened if I had continued to use this on my teeth and gums. At least I didn&#x27;t pay the full price so I am only out $2, but still, I don&#x27;t know how something with a horrible reaction can be on the market as safe. This was not a good experience and I would give it 0 stars if I could.</li>
    <li> I had been using the regular vivid white and prohealth toothpastes before this one, and both worked very well.  Seeing how well those worked I figured for a few extra dollars i&#x27;d try this.  I should note that the Prohealth and regular 3d effects toothpaste tended to make my mouth \\&quot;shed\\&quot; which the dentist said was normal and actually renews your mouth.  Both also helped with sensitivity, which I have some mild issues with if I use a regular toothpaste.  This product promises to remove 90% of surface stains in just 7 days, half the time of the regular 3D white, as well as 10% more.  After just 4 days of use I see no reason to question this, it is visibly making a difference!  I had slightly darker teeth from drinking Coke Zero in the mornings and not brushing again until night, as well as the normal discoloration on the tops of your teeth that seemed to never go away.  They are literally fading before my eyes!  It is far better than I expected, and better even than more expensive whitestrips and manages to cover your whole mouth.  The secret seems to be that there is normal 3D white toothpaste that is combined with what is likely hydrogen peroxide gel.  When it comes out of the tube it is a distinct pattern, the first discrenable as the ordinary witening paste, and the rest is the new whiter paste.  I checked the 3D effects mouthwash and see hydrogen peroxide is the other main ingredient, so i assume this is a mild version of what would be sold as a whitening gel.  The added benefit of this is not only witening, but also helathier gums, since hydrogen peroxide helps heal small scratches and irritation caused by bateria, scrathes from eating and brushing, etc.  My mouth also has an extremely pleasant feeling after using this, almost as if it&#x27;s lubricated.  And there is also no sensitivity with this paste, unlike many other whitening products.  If you&#x27;re skeptical, I would urge you to try this, I have been extremely pleased with the results.  It will be my \\&quot;normal\\&quot; toothpaste at least until my teeth are as white as i&#x27;d like.</li>
    <li> This whitened our teeth in less than one tube. We plan on buying more when ours runs out! Love it!</li>
