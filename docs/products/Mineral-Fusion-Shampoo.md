      <li>No dandriff and beautiful hair, would definately recommend!!!</li>
      <li>Works great!</li>
      <li>The best part is that because oils are removed with clay, I can still go 3 days between cleansing my hair, just like I did with the cleansing conditioner.</li>
      <li>It works awesome.</li>
      <li>Also, as others have said, it smells wonderful.</li>
      <li>Smells amazing!!!</li>
      <li>After using this shampoo, the flaking stopped and the itchiness subsided GREATLY.</li>
      <li>and It has a great amount of lather.</li>
      <li>It does a great job of getting rid of itchy scalp</li>
      <li>, it smells nice, AND it&#x27;s cruelty-free!</li>
      <li>I bought this shampoo and within 2 washes It was entirely good.</li>
      <li>and it has kept things fairly in check.</li>
      <li>would recommend that if you buy this product, use a really good conditioner afterwards, as it can be a tad drying on the hair.  </li>
      <li>I love this product!</li>

      <li>Nice lather.</li>
      <li>Has a nice citrus smell.  </li>
      <li>Does the job, and smells really nice.</li>
      <li>The smell is nice</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve struggled to find the right product for years and I am overjoyed to have found this incredible solution.</li>
      <li>The best I&#x27;ve found so far!</li>
      <li>Originally tried this item out at a health-food market and loved it, so I started buying it online.</li>
      <li>I switch between regular shampoo, pyrithione zinc dandruff shampoos and this kind (salcylic acid), because it&#x27;s helped keep the dandruff at bay the best.  </li>
      <li>smell is ok/neutral, but not my favorite.</li>
      <li>I love the shower gel in this line</li>
      <li>Love the smell of this product.</li>
      <li>I look forward to ordering more of this product as I&#x27;ve noticed an improvement.</li>
      <li>This is an awesome product and I would definitely continue to use it and recommend it.</li>
      <li>I love the tea tree smell</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many, many dandruff shampoos to no avail.</li>
      <li>but as my scalp was doing better, my hair quality was declining.</li>
      <li>Make sure to use a conditioner after shampooing with this.  </li>
      <li>and I really love this shampoo.</li>
      <li>This is by far and away the best &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; way to clean my hair.</li>
      <li>But this shampoo has a mild nice smell and more importantly, it works.</li>
      <li>Probably works best for mild to moderate dandruff.</li>
      <li>This shampoo leaves my hair feeling very clean, light, and silky.</li>
      <li>The conditioner is equally amazing with a squeaky clean finish and fresh scent.  </li>
      <li>It also has a very pleasant and refreshing fruity odor that isn&#x27;t heavy at all.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>At over a dollar an ounce you can&#x27;t call this shampoo cheap but for what you get</li>
      <li>Even though this isn&#x27;t sulfide free, I decided to give it a shot based off the reviews.</li>
      <li>so it was important to me that shampoo did not have gluten in it.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t realize just how great this shampoo worked for me until I started using H&amp;S again because I mis-shipped my last purchase and didn&#x27;t feel like reordering.</li>
      <li>Works great as being a salicylic formula, especially those days when your hair feels itchy for whatever the reasons.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m itch free when I sweat in the gym, and it&#x27;s</li>
      <li>not too sure how the ingredients in this shampoo differ from other dandruff shampoos, but I find this shampoo very effective in dandruff and itching relief.</li>
      <li>I was pretty fed up with all the flaking and discomfort and scoured Amazon for a better alternative.</li>
      <li>This is not a color friendly shampoo.  </li>
      <li>This has been an amazing product and has performed better than I possibly imagined.</li>
      <li>This shampoo smells amazing, takes care of my dandruff issues, and is completely cruelty free.</li>
      <li>Leaves if feeling so clean.</li>
      <li>The Nature&#x27;s Gate worked perfectly to get rid of my flaky itchy scalp but wasn&#x27;t otherwise very exciting, my hair was clean but slightly dull.</li>
      <li>Really good shampoo, does not leave your hair without shine as many other do.</li>
      <li>I purchased this for my son who is a teenager and has special needs.</li>
      <li>Makes hair lay better, doesn&#x27;t help much for dandruff  though.</li>
      <li>Despite this being sulfate free, it is not as gentle as a true sulfate free shampoo.  </li>
      <li>My hair is neither dried out or oily after 2 days which is good for me!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many other products that were vegan safe but none helped!</li>
      <li>My hair wasn&#x27;t dry and my scalp felt good too.</li>
      <li>It has a VERY light fragrance, one my husband couldn&#x27;t detect, but that I would describe as soft citrus.</li>
      <li>It does clean up dandruff pretty well.</li>
      <li>Makes the expense completely worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>But the tradeoff to have a itch-free scalp is very much worth it, and the dryness is nothing a supplemental conditioner</li>
      <li>and I rarely use heat)</li>
      <li>My dermatologist&#x27;s solution was prescription shampoo and 200 dollars worth of steroids to put on my head each month.</li>
      <li>Nice enough</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>Tried it without success.</li>
      <li>worth mentioning that I use this in combination with having adjusted my eating habits.</li>
      <li>It leaves my scalp very calm and clean, hair looking soft and shinny</li>
      <li>Actually makes my scalp more itchy.</li>
      <li>I love this shampoo and will be a regular buyer from now on!</li>
      <li>and I have tried many different shampoos.</li>
      <li>This is my husband&#x27;s favorite shampoo, and I use it occasionally as a clarifying shampoo.</li>
      <li>I am almost done with my first bottle</li>
      <li>My hair gets a bit oily and my scalp gets EXTREMELY itchy and flaky during the warmer months, so I needed something that would address the itchiness and also be a nice thorough cleanse for my hair.</li>
      <li>Defiantly recommend this to anyone who struggles with moderate to severe dandruff that is looking for something vegan friendly!</li>
      <li>UPDATE: Still loving this shampoo, but it does not last as long as I had originally anticipated.</li>
      <li>I have only as many flakes as the normal head of hair might release.</li>
      <li>I tried this shampoo purely based on the &amp;#34;100% vegan&amp;#34; label which means no animal bi products and no animals getting blinded in test labs.</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t need much for my shortish hair.</li>
      <li>I really like this shampoo.</li>
      <li>I really like the smell.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s gentle on hair without over drying it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s shampoo really made a difference for me.</li>
      <li>works really well to get rid of my itch and dandruff</li>
      <li>I do not itch as much.</li>
      <li>This Shampoo lathers really well</li>
      <li>It effectively rids the flakes after a few uses!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The 2 times I have run out and tried another dry scalp shampoo, I am quickly reminded why I am so loyal to this one.  </li>
      <li>almost more scabby patches (gross I know, but it is true) than dry flaky patches.</li>
      <li>only drawback is the price, but its performance makes it worth it!</li>
      <li>/&gt;I will say that this shampoo leaves my hair softer and more manageable than other drug-store brands.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This shampoo not only didn&#x27;t solve my dandruff issue, it gave me twice the flakes as I started with. Perhaps I just have more sensitive skin, but after using it my scalp felt raw, and I had lots of spots that were irritated and almost more scabby patches (gross I know, but it is true) than dry flaky patches. I tried it again some. I this later and result was the same. Smell was nice, but not a good choice for those with sensitive scalps.</li>
    <li> After 2 months it is still working. This has been an amazing product and has performed better than I possibly imagined.</li>
    <li> Makes hair lay better, doesn&#x27;t help much for dandruff  though.</li>
    <li> works really well to get rid of my itch and dandruff, I had a huge flake outbreak around newyears that was so bad out of nowhere. I bought this shampoo and within 2 washes It was entirely good. The only problem is when I first started using it it dried out my hair really bad, and now it leaves it a bit oily which entirely confuses me , but overall great shampoo love that its natural. It also actually works!</li>
    <li> cleared my husbands dandruff without all those nasty chemicals!</li>
    <li> Been using for a year now. Does the job, and smells really nice.</li>
    <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite shampoo, and I use it occasionally as a clarifying shampoo. It leaves my scalp feeling great, and hubby&#x27;s free of flakes. It&#x27;s not easy to find so hooray for Amazon!</li>
    <li> For someone who has battled dandruff for years, this product has been a godsend! It effectively rids the flakes after a few uses!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback is the price, but its performance makes it worth it!</li>
    <li> Actually makes my scalp more itchy.</li>
    <li> This shampo is helping me get rid of dandruff and dry scrap I have for years&lt;br /&gt;Also I notice is protecting the keratin treatment I have in my hair. I wash my hair twice a week a least.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing!!! Works great on my stubborn dandruff! Leaves if feeling so clean. Nice lather.</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo. It does a great job of getting rid of itchy scalp&lt;br /&gt; However it seems to make my hair frizzier and on the dry side</li>
    <li> I tried using a Paul Mitchell brand moisture shampoo and conditioner because my scalp is extremely dry from the weather (I rarely use products that would irritate my scalp and I rarely use heat) but as my scalp was doing better, my hair quality was declining. I decided to try Mineral Fusion anti-dandruff shampoo because other reviewers mentioned that it did not dry their hair out when treating the scalp. I have long, thick, coarse hair that can be difficult to manage while focusing on one problem.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s shampoo really made a difference for me. My hair is doing much better and what many other shampoo attempt failed, this product does help my scalp stay flake free.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s worth mentioning that I use this in combination with having adjusted my eating habits. Removing wheat and dairy drastically improved my scalp health.</li>
    <li> I get an itchy head when using other shampoos but this shampoo soothes and heals my scalp. I love the tea tree smell and It has a great amount of lather. I particularly love that It does not contain harsh chemicals like so many other beauty products.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loves this stuff and will not use any other dandruff shampoo. I have in my subscribe bin so we don&#x27;t run out.</li>
    <li> I have eczema and can have bad flare-ups around allergy season. I also have color treated hair.  I wanted to find a sulfate free shampoo that would not strip the color, but control even my worst flare-ups.  I can say, this product did the job.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is a bit lemony and clinical, it lathers well, it gets the job done.  Despite this being sulfate free, it is not as gentle as a true sulfate free shampoo.  I do notice my color lasts longer than when I use a regular shampoo, not as long when I use vegan, sulfate free shampoo.  Despite this, I will continue to buy this product.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend that if you buy this product, use a really good conditioner afterwards, as it can be a tad drying on the hair.  Paired with a good conditioner, I can use this as often as needed with minimal stripping of color, or use it 1x/wk when my flare ups are minimal.</li>
    <li> Originally tried this item out at a health-food market and loved it, so I started buying it online. Works great!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work, unfortunately. Tried it without success. Nice enough otherwise- but didn&#x27;t do the job. World return it if I could</li>
    <li> I had been struggling with horrible dandruff and itching since I was 11 and even with H&amp;S(which is what I was using before) the itching would return within a day and there were still a lot of flakes left remaining after I washed my hair. I was pretty fed up with all the flaking and discomfort and scoured Amazon for a better alternative. After using this shampoo, the flaking stopped and the itchiness subsided GREATLY. I didn&#x27;t feel like shaving my head or scratching it raw if I didn&#x27;t wash it in two days, as I used to experience even with other shampoos. I didn&#x27;t realize just how great this shampoo worked for me until I started using H&amp;S again because I mis-shipped my last purchase and didn&#x27;t feel like reordering. Without this shampoo, the itchiness and large flakes returned, and my scalp is miserable once again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not too sure how the ingredients in this shampoo differ from other dandruff shampoos, but I find this shampoo very effective in dandruff and itching relief. It also has a very pleasant and refreshing fruity odor that isn&#x27;t heavy at all.&lt;br /&gt;The only downside I&#x27;ve found to using this shampoo is that it leaves my hair with a dry, and I mean DRY, texture. But the tradeoff to have a itch-free scalp is very much worth it, and the dryness is nothing a supplemental conditioner can&#x27;t fix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.5/5, and I would definitely recommend to other dandruff-sufferers.</li>
    <li> Really good shampoo, does not leave your hair without shine as many other do. Works great as being a salicylic formula, especially those days when your hair feels itchy for whatever the reasons.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for 3 years.  The 2 times I have run out and tried another dry scalp shampoo, I am quickly reminded why I am so loyal to this one.  I have found nothing better (or even close)!</li>
    <li> Nice shampoo. I like the way my hair feels and smells. Does seem to help with dandruff, but it doesn&#x27;t clear it up. Probably works best for mild to moderate dandruff.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for several years now after struggling with dandriff.  No dandriff and beautiful hair, would definately recommend!!!</li>
    <li> It didnt work for me.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my son who is a teenager and has special needs. He also has Celiac so it was important to me that shampoo did not have gluten in it. Water tends to run down onto his face when I wash his hair so it was also important to have natural ingredients that wouldn&#x27;t cause me to &amp;#34;freak out&amp;#34; if I see him accidentally swallow some with water. My son has very thick hair (envy him) and a lot of it. Every winter we struggle to get flakes out of his hair because he tend to scratch relentlessly his head. So this winter we tried Mineral Fusion Natural Brands Anti Dandruff Mineral Shampoo to see if this helps with controlling his itchiness and flakes. I would say that it took about a month before we saw his head clearing up and he no longer scratch. We now rotate his shampoos - one week Mineral fusion and 3 weeks of Seventh generation orange body wash/shampoo. His hair look healthy and no more flakes. We have to keep up with washing routine since he goes to beach daily and flakes usually reappear but I am hoping this summer will be different.</li>
    <li> At over a dollar an ounce you can&#x27;t call this shampoo cheap but for what you get I think it&#x27;s worth it. I tried this shampoo purely based on the &amp;#34;100% vegan&amp;#34; label which means no animal bi products and no animals getting blinded in test labs. Yay! for no animal torture for me to wash my hair! Other shampoo&#x27;s have left my scalp itchy or left an odd residue. This shampoo leaves my hair feeling very clean, light, and silky. It has a VERY light fragrance, one my husband couldn&#x27;t detect, but that I would describe as soft citrus. I really like the smell. My hair is neither dried out or oily after 2 days which is good for me! No itchiness and no dandruff. I love this shampoo and will be a regular buyer from now on!</li>
    <li> I have been struggling with some scalp problems due to a medication I am on. It goes between being inflamed to flaky. My dermatologist&#x27;s solution was prescription shampoo and 200 dollars worth of steroids to put on my head each month. Instead I opted for this for daily use and then have been doing a coconut oil and apple cider vinegar mask each week and it has kept things fairly in check. It hasn&#x27;t completely solved the situation, but there has been a big improvement. I think for someone who has less serious issues this would work even better. Also, as others have said, it smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> Not pleased at all. I have dry scalp and this just made my scalp worse. Within 4 days of use, it was snowing from my head in a bad way. Never again.</li>
    <li> 2 weeks in and works well. Smells like oranges. I do not itch as much.</li>
    <li> Has a nice citrus smell.  Really deep cleans and so it leaves hair a little dry.  Make sure to use a conditioner after shampooing with this.  Works well.  I switch between regular shampoo, pyrithione zinc dandruff shampoos and this kind (salcylic acid), because it&#x27;s helped keep the dandruff at bay the best.  For some reason, if I use ONLY one type of dandruff shampoo, the build-up gets worse.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. My hair gets a bit oily and my scalp gets EXTREMELY itchy and flaky during the warmer months, so I needed something that would address the itchiness and also be a nice thorough cleanse for my hair. I used to use Neutrogena T-gel coal tar shampoo which (until this Mineral Fusion shampoo) was the only thing that kept the itchiness at bay. But once I realized they (Neutrogena) test on animals I decided I would not buy it again. THIS stuff, has exceeded my expectations. It leaves my scalp very calm and clean, hair looking soft and shinny (my boyfriend has even commented on the shininess and started using it too ha), it smells nice, AND it&#x27;s cruelty-free! Not to mention it&#x27;s inexpensive, and a little goes a long way so I expect this bottle will last longer than my previous coal tar shampoo. A+ Mineral Fusion! UPDATE: Still loving this shampoo, but it does not last as long as I had originally anticipated. In all fairness though, no shampoo ever does as I have very thick, long hair.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical of this stuff at first. I&#x27;ve tried many, many dandruff shampoos to no avail. They all kind of work for awhile, then stop being effective at all. I have seborrheic dermititis that becomes particularly problematic during high allergy season (thanks, ragweed), and the shampoos I&#x27;d been using were exacerbating the issue. Even though this isn&#x27;t sulfide free, I decided to give it a shot based off the reviews. I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised!  It&#x27;s still high allergy season where I am, but the itching has almost completely subsided and I&#x27;m no longer getting flakes. I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the scent when compared to other brands--it&#x27;s kind of lemony and smells a bit like industrial floor cleaner...but not enough to offend, just enough to make you think of it.  It does lather well and I don&#x27;t need much for my shortish hair. I get my hair dyed professionally and after three weeks of use neither I nor my  stylist have noticed it stripping the color out. At least, not any more than my old shampoo (H&amp;S) did. Would definitely recommend for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that this shampoo leaves my hair softer and more manageable than other drug-store brands. It&#x27;s actually nicer than several of the salon brands I&#x27;ve tried. We&#x27;ll see if its effectiveness wears off. I&#x27;ll try to update the post in a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit 09/16: I&#x27;ve been using this for a long while now (closer to a couple years, I think). Still loving it. A little bit of the scalp itch has come back, but still no flaking. Five star review stands.</li>
    <li> This shampoo smells amazing, takes care of my dandruff issues, and is completely cruelty free. May this line be produced forever.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s got everything I&#x27;m looking for in a shampoo. I&#x27;m itch free when I sweat in the gym, and it&#x27;s SLS/cruelty free.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is ok/neutral, but not my favorite. They should throw in some fragrance.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve managed to use my 1st bottle of Mineral Fusion Anti Dandruff Shampoo. By using this product as directed my dandruff has disappeared. Love the smell of this product. It&#x27;s gentle on hair without over drying it. I look forward to ordering more of this product as I&#x27;ve noticed an improvement.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a solution to dry/itchy/scaley scalp, oily hair roots and brittle hair. My flakes are more like psoriasis than dandruff made worse by anything containing unnatural alcohol, and my long hair can&#x27;t handle the lack of moisture provided by other types of anti-dandruff shampoo. Products like Head&amp; Shoulders might work great for some, but they actually made my flakes worse. And prescription shampoos were really no better. I was at my wits end when I found this product!&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo actually removed the flakes from your scalp - removes all build up. I have only as many flakes as the normal head of hair might release. The moisture level of the rest of my hair is balanced - I think it&#x27;s the healthiest my hair has felt in a while. I started with every other day use, and now I&#x27;m only using it once or twice a week. Makes the expense completely worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to anyone struggling with flakes - embarrassing, itching and worse every time you touch them, flakes. I&#x27;ve struggled to find the right product for years and I am overjoyed to have found this incredible solution.</li>
    <li> The best I&#x27;ve found so far!</li>
    <li> Hubby loves this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo a lot. It makes my hair a little dry but it works better than any other shampoo I&#x27;ve tried for sensitive scalp/occasional dandruff.</li>
    <li> I get a Brazilian Blowout every couple of months for the past three years.  As a result my scalp was having issues, little bumps and embarrassing dandruff.  After one use there was a major difference and now I am on a subscription plan and won&#x27;t use anything else.  The conditioner is equally amazing with a squeaky clean finish and fresh scent.  This is a must have for anyone using Keratin type treatments.</li>
    <li> I love the shower gel in this line so I wanted to give the shampoo a try.  I have color treated hair, with a semi-permanent hair color. This is not a color friendly shampoo.  It took the color out of my hair.  I love the smell and it worked well for the dandruff treatment to bad I can not continue to use with my hair color option</li>
    <li> I am almost done with my first bottle and I really love this shampoo. I have had stubborn dandruff/seborheic dermatitis for years and I have tried many different shampoos. The commercial stuff I bought at the store irritated my scalp really badly and didn&#x27;t smell so good. Other shampoos smelled really bad. But this shampoo has a mild nice smell and more importantly, it works. With every daily use, I had less and less dandruff and no irritation. My hair wasn&#x27;t dry and my scalp felt good too. This is an awesome product and I would definitely continue to use it and recommend it.</li>
    <li> It does clean up dandruff pretty well.</li>
    <li> This shampoo smells awesome. It works awesome. It doesn&#x27;t burn like some do. I am skeptical that it is making my hair break more, but I have made a lot of changes lately so I can&#x27;t pin it on this.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I&#x27;ve only used it twice and I&#x27;ve noticed a DRAMATIC difference in my dandruff! I&#x27;ve tried so many other products that were vegan safe but none helped! I was beginning to lose hope! Defiantly recommend this to anyone who struggles with moderate to severe dandruff that is looking for something vegan friendly!</li>
    <li> After going no shampoo for about 6 months (using Wen knockoffs), I got my very itchy dry scalp that comes a few times a year. I gave this a try, hoping that the minerals would be soothing, and it worked! This is by far and away the best &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; way to clean my hair. No parabens, no sulfates. The best part is that because oils are removed with clay, I can still go 3 days between cleansing my hair, just like I did with the cleansing conditioner. (By the way, I used Hair One in Olive purchased here on Amazon as well.)</li>
    <li> I switched from Nature&#x27;s Gate Tea Tree Shampoo to this one. The Nature&#x27;s Gate worked perfectly to get rid of my flaky itchy scalp but wasn&#x27;t otherwise very exciting, my hair was clean but slightly dull. So I tried the Mineral Fusion and found my dandruff and itchy scalp came back a little the first week. It did mellow out though and now it&#x27;s just occasional, mild dandruff and the itching is gone. But I was really pleased at the unexpected other benefits of this shampoo, it ended up giving me a lot of extra volume, and my hair felt healthier with a thicker texture. I have shoulder length, fine hair that is very thin on top and thick in the back. This Shampoo lathers really well and I don&#x27;t have to use a lot of it. I use this with the Fortifying Conditioner which is fantastic, I thought it was too light and barely felt it when I put it on my hair, but it washed out very easily and with just little bit it left my hair really soft and manageable without leaving my fine hair weighed down.</li>
    <li> The smell is nice but when it comes down to it, the product just didn&#x27;t work for me. I had the same amount of flakes and had to move to Head and Shoulders Extra Strength, which has worked well so far. It&#x27;s probably just for me, but I can say it did not work 100%</li>
