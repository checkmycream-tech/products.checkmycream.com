<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought these brushes after seeing a positive review on YouTube from one of the channels I am subscribed to.  For the price and 100% guarantee I decided to try them out. This brush set is awesome! So soft and they don&#x27;t shed. I have used them for a month and highly recommend them!</li>
    <li> Quality brushes. I just don&#x27;t know how to probably use each brushes! But they felt very nice on my face.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping.  Great brushes</li>
    <li> Loved the brushes, amazing! They pick up the makeup nicely and blend it beautifully . Brushes don&#x27;t shed density is perfect. The quality is just outstanding and the price is great for the quality you receive.  Buy these brushes you will have no regrets!!!</li>
    <li> These brushes are very good. I was impressed with the quality and the set includes all the brushes I need to complete my make up. Overall a good purchase!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m super happy with this brush set!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s good quality and affordable so therefore I would highly recommend😊</li>
    <li> These are the best brushes I ever used!!!!</li>
    <li> I love my new set of brushes.  I&#x27;ve been using Mary Kay brushes  and this set is WAY better.  Professional quality at an affordable price.  I also love the black case they come in.  It&#x27;s perfect for travel and looks great on my bathroom counter.</li>
    <li> The brushes are great still getting use to it because I&#x27;m learning but they do feel great</li>
    <li> Love my new brush set</li>
    <li> Super quick shipping .. everything I wanted .. beautiful performance ...</li>
    <li> Who knew brushes could be so soft! I absolutely LOVE this long thought-out purchase considering all the expensive brands I&#x27;ve gone through in trying to find the right brush set. And they are super easy to clean at night, ready to be used by morning.</li>
    <li> I love the case it&#x27;s very convenient for makeup artists like myself to have a case like this for your table set up when going over to a client&#x27;s house. .sometimes I don&#x27;t have much space to lay out my brushes and this also helps with separating your dirty brush from your clean ones..the brushes had a bit of powder on them but I&#x27;ve washed them and so far no shedding..I can&#x27;t give it 5 stars yet because I want to use them more to see if they last over washing..but I&#x27;m very satisfied with the product..and all my orders from amazon have arrived on time or a little early which I think is awesome!  My first time ordering things from amazon and I think I&#x27;ll be ordering a lot more from them..also thanks to the people that have reviewed this product...I usually stick to popular brands but I saw and read the reviews and decided to try them..thanks guys! I&#x27;m a happy customer!</li>
    <li> Beautiful soft brushes! I absolutely adore these things! I have lots of prestige brand (mac, sigma, urban decay) brushes and these are just as good as the high-end ones. I was hesitant at first to purchase an off brand but after this I&#x27;ll be getting another set. I contour a lot &amp; these brushes helped blend out my product beautifully. The only problem I had with them was color deposit. I used one for blush and where ever you set the makeup is where is going to stick unless you uses the stippling brush to blended out very very well. There was no fallout of the fibers or lose bezels and I have now had them over a month. I have washed them and they have held up very well and still extremely soft. My other complaint is that these are not labeled with descriptions on what each brush is for. I kind of had to figure it out on my own. Other than that these are an absolute perfect buy for anyone looking for a good deal.</li>
    <li> Brushes are great. Exactly like advertised</li>
    <li> These are not professional makeup brushes! Might as well take a 50 dollar bill and set it on fire. Save your money people! These suck the hairs fall out everywhere all the time. Not worth the money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to makeup and I&#x27;m very please with these brushes. They don&#x27;t shed like some of the other brushes I&#x27;ve purchased. I am very pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing!</li>
    <li> I received the brush set, but im not sure what brush is for what because there was no information sheet enclosed. I haven&#x27;t started using it.</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing!!.. I usually don&#x27;t leave any reviews on products that i buy but I had to for this specific product because it&#x27;s soo great. Flawless application and it&#x27;s very soft!!.. makeup lovers..try this. . You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> These brushes amazing with creams, liquids, and LOOSE powders but not with compact powders.  They are super soft, almost too soft to loosen up and pick up any respectible amount of compacted powder.  Definately a must have for your collection but look for something else for those compact pallets.</li>
    <li> super soft. No loose hair on brushes</li>
    <li> Recived the brushes almost instantly. They are even nicer than in  the ! Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Great product! Super fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Like them very much....</li>
    <li> Very excited to have them:)</li>
    <li> Really nice brush, great for powder....its too soft for liquid, maybe great for bronzing this summer</li>
    <li> Good quality brush set. This is a Christmas gift but I&#x27;m seriously considering keeping them for my self. :)</li>
    <li> Stop reading this and buy these brushes! I cannot believe the quality you get for the price you pay!</li>
    <li> I love the brushes, they are great quality.</li>
    <li> The brushes are amazing. I can&#x27;t wait to use them.</li>
    <li> I AM IN LOVE WITH THESE BRUSHES!! They feel like butter! I used them on a friend of mine for the first use to do a test run on her bridal makeup and they are SUPER soft, accurate and I&#x27;m going to order more. WOO WOO!!</li>
    <li> I purchased a set for my daughter. Her makeup looks flawless now.&lt;br /&gt;I plan to purchase a second set for myself.,</li>
    <li> At first I loved these. I first got them and they were SO soft. I washed before first use and used them for a week before doing another deep cleaning. After every use I always do a daily spot cleaning to get my brushes sanitary. After the second washing there wasn&#x27;t something right about the bristles, like there was residue left on them. I use the MAC brush cleanser on all of my brushes including my MAC brushes, Sigma brushes, and IT Cosmetics brushes which I have had for a year now and never had this issue with those bristles. I decided to pick up a different brush cleanser from Sephora. After letting them air dry they still felt weird. I tried once more with a DIY recipe I&#x27;ve used before that was successful in the past, and the Lamora brushes still felt like they had residue. After that I threw them in the trash. DO NOT BUY THESE BRUSHES! I should have taken $50 out of my wallet and tossed that in the trash instead since that basically what I did with these.</li>
    <li> Very good Brushes. I Loved it. I use it every day.They are very dense.</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazed by these high quality brushes. Soft, distribute makeup evenly, easy to wash. Very, very pleased!</li>
    <li> Great product. High quality. Gave 4 stars bc I didn&#x27;t quite get that these are all for the face. The skinny brushes are for various concealers, highlighters, contouring, and NOT eye makeup. I didn&#x27;t have a need for 10 brushes for foundation and concealer. I ended up buying the same brand&#x27;s eye brush set.</li>
    <li> Holy amazing! I am a member of the beauty blogger community and very interested in makeup artisty, and let me just say, these brushes are absolutely to die for! I recieved mine in the mail this week and have been loving them ever since! I&#x27;ve had experience with high-end brushes like Sigma and IT cosmetics, and these brushes are just as great, if not BETTER! The value is unbelievable! The flat kabuki brush is a mirror image dupe of the popular Sigma F-80. Do yourself a favor and buy these! You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> For the price I paid they are amazing they are truly soft foundation goes on smoothly with the flat top brush I was looking for a good brush set for a long time but did want to have to pay 150 for like 5 brushes I was really happy with this product</li>
    <li> Love these brushes. So soft and easy to clean. The bag does have a weird smell, but after airing it out, it&#x27;s not bad. The brushes also have a smell to them but after the first wash, smell goes away. Quick shipping, excellent customer service.</li>
    <li> Was very nervous buying these brushes cause I usually only buy Sigma but they really proved me wrong, amazing quality for a great price! Definitely recommend them !</li>
    <li> Bought this for my girlfriend. She loved it.</li>
    <li> Love the brushes and the pouch they come in!</li>
    <li> Wonderful!!! The feeling is very soft. I&#x27;m not a pro, but this is on top.  They fulfill my expetetions.</li>
    <li> This item is a gift for my sister and it arrived quickly and the packaging was Done Extremely well as the product arrived in perfect condition. I&#x27;m sure she will love the set!</li>
    <li> The brushes are amazingly soft.  LOVE the eye brushes for my eye makeup.  The facial brushes are really wonderful.  Not sure what to do with the facial brush with the point, but it will be fun to figure that out.  With the number of brushes and the case it is a good deal.</li>
    <li> Best decision buying this brush.. its so soft and the application is flawless although im not giving 5* because one of my brushes arrived detached</li>
    <li> I bought these as a gift for my daughter. She loves them! They net her needs perfectly. They were delivered quickly too. Very happy!</li>
    <li> it is so amizing i liked and i am luky for chosen thanks</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Very high quality. Great price</li>
    <li> Great Brushes, I got them for my fiancé and she is static about them. Brushes are smooth and great applicators. Got the pink set and they shipped within 4 days. Awesome product and great customer service. Do recommend!!</li>
    <li> I love it , its such an amazing brush set and soft for my skin 👌 must have</li>
    <li> I am super happy with my brushes. They definitely exceeded my expectations. The quality and look of these brushes almost beat my MAC and CHANEL brushes.</li>
    <li> I have only had these brushes for a month and I have used these for a few times and washed them. These brushes are good quality at an affordable price and l love the softness!!</li>
    <li> Love them!!. Id be willing to pay a little more for a real leather bag because the fake one has an awful smell, but the brushes are great!!!</li>
    <li> These brushes came with NO instructions. I have no idea what each brush should be used for. Also, the smaller brushes, that I assume are for the eyes, seem too big for the detail needed for the eyes. I can&#x27;t rate their effectiveness because I haven&#x27;t used them yet. I will have to do a lot of research to find out how to use them or I will return them. Leaning towards returning.</li>
    <li> Very quick shipping and the brushes are so soft. I love them.</li>
    <li> These brushes smelled like a can of spray paint. For the price...I expected them to be better. I should have just bought the cheaper ones without the Lamora name on them...same brushes, except they&#x27;re only like $10 for the entire set.</li>
    <li> Brushes are very good quality. Haven&#x27;t had any issues with them. Great buy!</li>
    <li> Very pleased with set - soft and rarely sheds. It includes more brushes than what I use, but the price and quality is excellent in comparison to other sets.</li>
    <li> Love the brushes!!! Amazing quality and price!!!</li>
    <li> Love these bushes.. Best thing I have ever done for myself..</li>
    <li> This Brush Set is ok. The bristles are soft but I&#x27;m using more pressure to spread and blend products than I do with other brushes  and they&#x27;re pulling my skin which is not good.  I have a &amp;#34;It Cosmetics&amp;#34; brush which I love but they are expensive which is why I bought these.  I will use them for a while and see it they need to be broken in but right now I can not recommend them because I feel there will be sagging skin down the road.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes.  Works great</li>
    <li> I love them so far. The only downfall is that they shed a little. But over all, they are good brushes. Very soft.</li>
    <li> The only difference between these and my SIGMA brushes is the $86.00 price difference! I put myself through nursing  school with my Cosmetology license, and I&#x27;ve used thousands of brushes! Very soft, dense, and give a flawless finish. No shedding whatsoever after washing or applying product. They also came with a cute faux leather carrying pouch that I use as a clutch. Very good brushes</li>
    <li> 5.26.2015: This is the best value for the money spent. I used to spend this much on one brush from Mac. Now I get 10, and the quality is just as good or better. I love it! Highly recommend! I never review a product I like, I usually only review products I am disappointed in to warn people from making the same mistake. However, these brushes are amazing, gotta share!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated 6.9.2017: The bristles will fall out after three cleanings. I would use one, until the bristles starts to fall out then discard and move to the next brush. So you get what you pay for, and for 34 dollars, its not that bad of an investment. I am now on my last big kabuki brush and will be buying another set on Amazon, just not this brand.</li>
    <li> The brushes are so soft, high quality and the customer service is great</li>
    <li> I received this product.&lt;br /&gt;I love it.&lt;br /&gt;Very soft and good choice for my skin.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re sensitive to the off gassing of toxic plastic then this may not be the product for you. At first I thought it was just the &amp;#34;leather&amp;#34; bag but that isn&#x27;t the case. I bought this and the eyeshadow brush set, both sets smell like they&#x27;ve been soaked in pure acetone.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Lamora for my sore throat, headache and burning lungs. Much appreciated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes do seem soft, but unless the smell goes away within the next week, I&#x27;ll never know if they work well or not.</li>
    <li> Love the brushes!!! As a makeup artist they are the best set I have ever found at that price that incorporates face and eye brushes. I am so impressed with the quality. I will say some are a little more dense than others and seems to be better geared towards use with liquid or cream. I have used about half with powder and really like the results. Overall a great buy and I would buy more!</li>
    <li> these brushes are gtesy</li>
    <li> My daughter loves them!</li>
    <li> Was absolutely satisfied with this order! It came really quick and the brushes seem a high quality. You will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I got my brushes today,and the first thing I did to check if they shed.Sure enough everylittle hair from the roots falls.It wasn&#x27;t what I&#x27;m expecting.Returning this item.One star for the case.      updated:    customer service is very excellent.</li>
    <li> I love this brush I had good breaking up with them, very good.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a last minute Christmas gift, literally 3 days before Christmas. The product shipped ASAP and was at my house on Christmas eve! The brushes are very soft and high quality. It&#x27;s not a bad deal for a whole set of brushes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried and tested some of brush sets personally and by far this is one of the best one I would recommend to anyone. It comes with a hard case which is very nice and handy and it also looks very great. It would be even better if it had a smaller size of brush. Other than that, I was very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had these brushes for a little over a week, and I am very pleased!  I was looking for brushes that don&#x27;t shed and that are soft as well.  My previous brushes constantly shed and actually kind of hurt my face when I was applying my makeup.  These are literally the polar opposite.  I use mostly the large rounded brush and the large angled brush for my mineral powder foundation, bronzer and blush application.  I have not used the eye shadow brushes yet, but look forward to using them soon.  I do agree with the suggestion of printing the use of the brush on the actual brush handle, as other consumers suggested.  The PDF is nice, but who wants to go through the hassle of looking it up each time you go to use a different brush?  Overall, I am very happy and I hope to use these brushes for a long time!</li>
    <li> I just received my brushes. Absolutely excited to use them!  They are super soft and great quality!  I had someone from Lamora reach out to me before I received the brushes just to make sure hey met my approval!  Totally impressed with that customer service.</li>
    <li> Love love love them!!!! :)</li>
    <li> I love finding cheap (but good quality) alternatives to expensive makeup and brushes. This 10 piece Lamora set is fantastic!  They are so incredibly soft and well made! When opening the black travel bag that they come in, I noticed a strong smell.  The brushes did not smell, just the bag, so I am currently airing it out to see if I can get the smell out and be able to use it when traveling.  After opening the pack I immediately washed all 10 brushes because I was so excited about trying them out.  I only noticed 1 brush hair come out while washing all 10 brushes, but haven&#x27;t seen any shedding since!  They look very similar to Sigma brushes, but I do not own them, so I can not fully compare. I ordered these brushes to try out the styles of brushes and find out which ones I like best before I ordered the Sigma ones and other high end brushes.  However, as long as these hold up (which they feel like they will last a long time), I won&#x27;t need to spend the money on more expensive brushes!  Overall, I am very pleased with these Lamora  face brushes!</li>
    <li> If you like morphe brushes or sigma brushes, this brand definitely matches their quality if not better than those other higher priced brands. I would 100% re purchase this brand again and recommend this to everyone! The synthetic brushes are great for applying your cosmetics, liquid foundation, concealer, powder, eye shadow, blush, bronzer, highlighters, and whatever else you can apply with makeup brushes. These brushes are AMAZING! I love these brushes all of them much more than any other brand of brushes I&#x27;ve ever purchased. I recently purchased Morphe Brushes, and the brush part are already coming literally un-glued from the handles. From the price I have paid for the Morphe brushes you would think that they would last for more than 4 months. I will re-purchase the Lamora brushes over and over again without a single doubt in the world. I LOVE THESE BRUSHES!</li>
    <li> Although I&#x27;m not yet sure how to use all of the different brushes, I very much like the set. It is of very good quality.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes. The way they apply my foundation is so smooth and natural looking. They are extremely soft and high quality and it makes me excited to play with makeup looks. The leather looking case is cute that it came with. Now I just need to get the eye brush set !</li>
    <li> I love it!!!!!!!!brushes are amazingly soft and they work extremely amazing..</li>
    <li> I love these brushes! And they are so thickly packed and are very great quality. They are better than my mac brushes. I would definitely buy these again in a heartbeat.</li>
    <li> Given the price of these brushes, I was skeptical but decided to give them a shot. AMAZING! I am used to using Chanel &amp; Bobbi Brown brushes and these are so much softer. I&#x27;ve only had a chance to use to blush and contouring so far but they work very well. The bag they came in is beautiful.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re perfect and soft</li>
    <li> Lovely Brushes.. Very Happy!</li>
    <li> Best brushes I&#x27;ve used. I recommend to everyone. Reasonable price and amazing brushes. I&#x27;ve had them for months use them everyday and still feel the same as the day I got them. Great buy. Don&#x27;t think twice about getting them! So worth it!</li>
    <li> These brushes came super fast and are great quality brushes! If you&#x27;re looking into buying sigma brushes these are exactly the same with a way better price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with these brushes!</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing! Highly recommend them to anyone</li>
    <li> Best product that I have ever got&lt;br /&gt;thanx</li>
    <li> My wife says they are not as &amp;#34;tight&amp;#34; as the expensive sephora brushes, and the set is missing a flat foundation and a flat eyeshadow brush... That&#x27;s just what she says.... Take it for what&#x27;s it&#x27;s worth... Good value for the money</li>
    <li> Great brushes very soft</li>
    <li> This is one of the better brush sets I have ever tried!  I just wish I had discovered it sooner, instead of wasting so much money on more expensive brushes just for the &amp;#34;name value&amp;#34;.  These are just as great as those, at a fraction of the price and with a better value.  To begin with, they are extremely soft to the touch and feel velvety on the skin, so there is no scratching or irritation.  They are excellent on all types of makeup (have tried with both liquid and powder and loved the results of both).  The result is a very natural yet polished finish that hides my pores, without looking caked on or too heavily made up.  Last, but not least, they are extremely easy to clean.  The bristles are densely packed, but I was pleasantly surprised at how quickly and easily the make up came out.  Give it a try!</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and reached my expectations. Great make-up brush set at a great price!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with these brushes!  They are so soft and dense enough to apply my products correctly.  They can each be used multiple ways depending on the products you use.  I highly recommend them.  The value is amazing.  I&#x27;ve already ordered their eye set and can&#x27;t wait to get those:-)</li>
    <li> I purchased these brushes for my makeup kit because I&#x27;m a makeup artist, and I needed some extra brushes. Little did I know they would become some of my favorite, high quality brushes to use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend! I even purchased another set of theirs once I received the first set I bought. They are absolutely amazing for the price.&lt;br /&gt;I am also a vegan and cruelty free non animal hair makeup brushes are super important to me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for being awesome, Lamora Beauty!&lt;br /&gt;Xoxo,&lt;br /&gt;Free Spirit Makeup</li>
    <li> like these brush so much&lt;br /&gt;Thanks alot</li>
    <li> Great  Product , super fast shipping .</li>
    <li> This brush set is amazing! Can&#x27;t beat the price either. Totally recommend!</li>
    <li> Very nice quality brushes. Excellent price for number of quality of brushes you receive. They also email you a very thorough and informative breakdown of each brush (a number on each handle identifies each one) and it&#x27;s recommended use with regards to makeup, along with some tips. Care/cleaning instructions for brushes, etc.</li>
    <li> Great brushes....I more utilize the face brushes though. My fav are the flat, pointed and rounded kabuki</li>
    <li> I received my brushes about a week ago and I LOVE them. They are super soft and apply make up beautifully.  I know one person said that they had some shedding when they first got them but mine haven&#x27;t done that at all. They had a slight chemical smell when I first got them but I washed them first thing and it went away.  The price is great as well. I think you get high quality brushes for a very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I am NOT a professional makeup artist but I really do like these brushes. they are feathery soft and they appear to flying the makeup on with ease.</li>
    <li> This brush set is really NICE! I read the reviews and bought them because of that alone. I have used a lot of brands varying from, MAC, Mary Kay, Sephora...etc! These hands down, are so much nicer! They are really soft and well constructed. I have used them to apply foundation, contour, and blend and they work perfect. No shedding so far. The smell that everyone is talking about is the bag it comes in. All the brushes come individually plastic wrapped. I would recommend these to anyone! Enjoy ladies, This is a Great QUALITY brush set for a fraction of the cost that you would pay for other &amp;#34;Name Brand&amp;#34; brush sets.</li>
    <li> Very nice brushes. Delivered quickly!</li>
    <li> Love these brushes and the variety of sizes and shapes for almost any use. Came with a great leather bag for storage as well to keep them in good condition. Good price, excellent value.</li>
    <li> The brushes are definitely soft and quality for the price, however the &amp;#34;eye&amp;#34; brushes I wish were a little smaller and different variety. They all seem to do the same thing and are very large for blending and creasing. I am not sure if they are a &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; in your brush collection set! So I was a little bummed about that! Overall it is a good purchase, but I still need to buy more brushes now to add to the collection. ( for the eyes). The 5 face brushes are very good. I found them to be comparable to my sigma brushes! I really enjoy those and have used those a ton already! Overall glad I purchased as you get a cute leather makeup bag, just wish it had better eye brushes :(</li>
    <li> Love these brushes but am giving them only 4 stars as there are none for applying eye makeup. How many brushes does one need for shading, shadowing &amp; contouring? These are the real deal. Would recommend them but as mentioned feel that there are too many&lt;br /&gt;redundancies.</li>
    <li> I am in love with these brushes! Great quality and a steal for this price! I can&#x27;t imagine spending hundreds on Mac brushes after discovering these! I wish I could find the pink ones on Amazon!</li>
    <li> These brushes are so amazing high quality fast shipping im extremely satisfied and will def buy from you guys again I couldn&#x27;t believe how high quality these were along with the awesome bag</li>
    <li> I love these brushes! Honestly, I wasn&#x27;t expecting much about these brushes. When I was looking into Sigma brushes on Amazon, which cost twice more than the Lamora brushes, I realized that everyone who purchased Lamora brushes love all about their orders. I just wanted to give it a shot since it&#x27;s only half price of what I was planning to get and now I fell in love with these brushes! I have received the brushes yesterday and tried one of kabuki face brush for buffing my foundation on the skin this morning, it didn&#x27;t leave any streaks or lines at all! All of them are very soft and smooth application. I am going to wash and try all of them tonight. So excited about these Lamora brushes!  Better than the expensive brushes on the market!</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast. Products r good!</li>
    <li> I was actually looking for high end brushes after reading on makeup&lt;br /&gt;forums and ended up with seing these lamora brushes and had to get them.&lt;br /&gt;The brushes came in a nice black carrying case and i realised that i&lt;br /&gt;have actually two brush holders and as well the brushes which is really&lt;br /&gt;awesome. There was no smell when I unpacked them. Each brush had a&lt;br /&gt;plastic wrap around them. The handles are smooth black and well put&lt;br /&gt;together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These brushes are so super soft. They feel super smooth on the skin. I&lt;br /&gt;had to put them right away on my face. What I really like is the&lt;br /&gt;combination of the buffing and precision brushes. I have tested them&lt;br /&gt;applying liquid foundation, primer and concealer and there was no&lt;br /&gt;shedding and there is no impression of future shedding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush set is really providing me with a great value. I am really&lt;br /&gt;impressed with the quality of this brush set. If you think about getting&lt;br /&gt;this brush set i would totally recommend it. The brushes are now in my&lt;br /&gt;daily routine and they help me to achieve the flawless look i want.</li>
    <li> Soft and beautiful brushes . I am a professional makeup artist and I like the product its soft and very high qualityI  I recommend it</li>
    <li> These brushes are great! You get a lot for the price. I love the fact that they have the smaller versions, you can get into the small areas of the face. They are Dense, as I wanted. I had no shedding when I washed them. Overall, great product!</li>
    <li> I love this set. Very high quality...makes applying makeup so much easier. It comes with a nice cylinder container too.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes they are awesome they work very well and the hairs don&#x27;t fall out at all and the make up is more flawless</li>
    <li> As a freelance makeup artist i must say that these brushes are very good. The only problem I have is that the paint on the handles are cracking. Other than that they get the job done and give my clients an airbrush finish.</li>
    <li> This set was wonderful! The brushes are soft and it had basically everything you would need. My only issue with it was that when I got it, the bag that holds the brushes smelled strongly like paint thinner or some sort of crazy chemicals. I washed everything before I used it, but besides that, I was happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> At first I though why should I spend the money  if I can buy something chipper, that looks just as good as this set. So, I did. Guess what?&lt;br /&gt;I payed  $19.99 for a different company&#x27;s makeup brush set(12 peaces)and waisted my money!  As soon as i received my package, I was so disappointed. Those brushes looked like their were from the dollar store, and they were shedding everywhere !&lt;br /&gt; When I decide to go back and order the Lamora makeup brushes( 10 peaces set from Lamora) I have to tell you , what a difference!!! You get what you pay  for! These brushes are amazing!!! They are so soft and very pretty. Now I also want to order the 6 piece set from Lamora, I really like the cup holder that comes with them. My brushes came with  a little leather  bag, which is perfect to use to hold your make up (lipstick,mascara..)&lt;br /&gt;I included some pictures . :)</li>
    <li> They are pwefect...love my brushes</li>
    <li> These brushes are fantastic I use on my clients every day! HIGHLY recommend.....&lt;br /&gt;They are so plush and luxurious. Great for applying liquid foundation.</li>
    <li> Happy with brushes foundation goes on smoothly, great value, case is great for travel .&lt;br /&gt;Will buy more brushes .</li>
    <li> Fantastic packaging.  Love these!</li>
    <li> This will be part of a gift for my niece who just graduated from cosmetology school.  I&#x27;m sure she&#x27;ll love it.  I wanted to get her something that&#x27;s professional and well-made, and I&#x27;m so glad I found this brush set.  A lot of brushes and a nice-looking case.  The company, Lamora Beauty, also followed up with me on e-mail to ask if my order arrived in good condition and if I was satisfied with my purchase.  That&#x27;s great customer service and says a lot about the company and the product they sell.</li>
    <li> Awesome brush set! Wow!  I am a MUA,  and I needed extra brushes for when I have multiple people to work on.  I like to work with clean fresh brushes.  I am so impressed with the quality.  They are as good as my expensive brushes.  Really, they are better. Soft, but not too soft.  Very full,  not skimpy and thin.  No shedding at all.  Excellent selection.  Love the zippered bag they come in.  One of the best buys I have had period!</li>
    <li> I thought that I qould try these brushes out because they looked so similar to sigma brushes.  I have been using then for about 2 weeks and they are great! They are soft and apply my make up very well. They are a great buy for the price. I would say that they are very comparable to sigma brushes but much less expensive.</li>
    <li> This is a great value for these brushes. Very satisfied customer!</li>
    <li> These Brushes are the best!!! I love them. I u still dont convinced your</li>
    <li> Fantastic......daughter loves them.  Very high quality....well worth the money spent and saved.</li>
    <li> One word : Awesome ! You cannot skip such a deal , I love my brushes ! Soooo glad I bought them !</li>
    <li> Love the brushes, but really like the case</li>
    <li> Soft and fluffy. Great value for the price. It shipped quickly.  I enjoy these brushesfor my makeup to make it look fabulous</li>
    <li> After some review of this product, I decided to give it a try. I&#x27;ve used Sigma and MAC brushes before and let me say this set does not disappoint. It&#x27;s super soft and works and blends really well!!! and best of it....the PRICE!!! Thanks!</li>
    <li> Impressed!! Very nice brushes! I was in search of a high end brush set and almost pulled the plug on Sigma brushes but i&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t! These are super soft and I can see a huge difference in how my makeup looks when using these fabulous brushes. So far I have washed them once and no shedding what so ever. I just wish they put what each brush is for on the brush itself but they do email you a sheet with this information. I highly recommend these!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with these makeup brushes. I&#x27;ve been using them non-stop since I got them about 2 weeks ago. They are so incredibly soft.</li>
    <li> AMAZING brush set!  Almost identical to my sigma brushes in quality and feel.  Really a great deal for such useful and versatile brushes.</li>
    <li> soft, washes well, didnt shed. only complain is i hope the bristles are more packed i find that when i used it on my face for  foundation the bristles get soft wet and clumpy. but overall i think its. good value.</li>
    <li> I only had a chance to try one brush from this set as I bought a few sets of different brands. It&#x27;s a flat brush which I use it to apply foundation. This one brush make tremendous different to my make up routine. My face look flawless and it save me a whole lot of time try to look like I have great skin. These brushes are the same quality with those high end brand, might even be slightly better than some expensive one. The only different is there&#x27;s no name on each brush, which make it difficult  for newbie who want to invest in a good set of brushes. They do send instruction to your email but still, it&#x27;s better if they have name carved or printed.</li>
    <li> These makeup brushes are phenomenal!  The quality is absolutely second to none--especially for the price!!!  I compared them to MAC and Sigma brushes, and there was virtually no difference--again, except for the price.  This is my first set of makeup brushes, so I am NOT an expert, but these brushes are amazing.  There was absolutely NO SHEDDING when I took them out of the packaging, and the bristles are locked tightly into the handles.  They are soft, but firm; they feel wonderful on my skin!  They pick up just the right amount of product, and they apply effortlessly. I highly recommend these brushes, with no reservation whatsoever.  Also, Lamora customer service is FANTASTIC.  I had a couple of questions that were answered promptly and courteously.&lt;br /&gt; I will say that the bag in which the brushes arrive smells AWFUL (very chemical-y)...but after airing out for a couple of days, the smell dissipated and I don&#x27;t even notice it anymore.  :)</li>
    <li> Very soft and sturdy brushes! In regards to the strong chemical smell others have mentioned, I agree. BUT it&#x27;s NOT the brushes it&#x27;s the bag. It has a strong spray paint smell. I came to this conclusion after receiving the Lamora 7 Piece Eye Brush Set. Those brushes came in a box and odor free. A simple solution would be to leave the brushes out of the bag over night and possibly put a fabric sheet in the Lamora bag itself. You&#x27;ll want to keep these sleek brushes out on your vanity anyway. So don&#x27;t let that stop you from this great steal! I would recommend these brushes and will be purchasing again for my sisters B-day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Lamora Beauty&amp; Amazon!</li>
    <li> I am in love with these brushes! I am new to makeup but it is so easy to use these brushes. If you are having any doubts, don&#x27;t! These are a great investment.</li>
    <li> I love this brush set! ! Got to my house fairly on time and would recommend purchasing from this buyer again.</li>
    <li> I just got a product today, usely I don&#x27;t levea a comment but with this I got to say, it a great brush... It super solf and full... U will not disappoint it ... It&#x27;s a great brush for the prices it&#x27;s even better.</li>
    <li> i love it! thank you so much!</li>
    <li> FOR THE PRICE YOU JUST CANT BEAT IT......YES I OWN SOME SIGMA BRUSHES, BUT THESE COME PRETTY DARN CLOSE..SO IF YOU ARE WONDERING IF YOU SHOULD GET THEM AT THIS PRICE YOU WONT REGRET IT.....</li>
    <li> They are really great! I am truly impressed, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> I first heard of these brushes from Jaclyn Hill on YouTube and she always recommended them, so when I saw they were on sale, I decided to try them out. I am IN LOVE with these brushes and I do not regret buying them at all!!</li>
    <li> I had been researching and looking for good quality brushes and I had considered Sigma brushes or Sedona Lace Brushes.  Both costed quite a bit and didn&#x27;t have all the brushes I had wanted in a set.  I had searched around amazon looking to avoid the shipment fees and stumbled upon the Lamora makeup brush set.  I had seen that the price was priced higher than the cheap Made in China ones where you can buy a set for under $15.  I read all the rave reviews and researched the company.  I found their facebook page and their website.  In addition to their site I had read about them through some news articles and found them to be in high demand.  I decided to take the plunge and order the set.  Since I had amazon prime, I received the set within 2 days and they were high quality brushes with dense fibers, which was what I was looking for.  It also came with a brush holder as well.  Like other reviewers mentioned, the brush holder had a chemical smell to it but I didn&#x27;t smell it on the brush.  I had wiped the case down with baby wipes and washes the brushes with baby shampoo.  None of them shed.  Makeup application with these brushes has been great and provides a flawless, even application without any streaks.  I find that using the flat angled kabuki brush with my cream foundation has provided better coverage and I ended up using less product than with a sponge.  I also like how the tops of the brushes are white so I can see how much product is on it and make sure they&#x27;re clean when I wash them. Customer service has been great.  After ordering, I received an email with washing instructions as well as a pdf with directions on how to use each brush. A couple weeks after receiving the product I also received a text message from Lea Milds to see If I had received my brush set yet.  Overall, I would highly recommend this product and am looking forward to any more brushes they make in the future!!</li>
    <li> The order was perfect, well packaged and exactly what my wife needed. When she is happy I am happy.</li>
    <li> Third set of Lamora bushes and satisfied, yet again! This set is perfect for my gym bag and traveling. It&#x27;s exactly all I need and I love that I don&#x27;t have to constantly move my home set around. These are silky on the skin, easy to clean and quick to dry. I have yet to have a complaint with Lamora products. Satisfaction with out drama down the road! Love it!</li>
    <li> So far, this product looks amazing! I bought two for my daughters for Christmas so I will know what they think in 22 days! 😄They love all things makeup!</li>
    <li> The best set I have ever used! It felt so soft and dense I can&#x27;t wait to purchase the deluxe eyeshadow brush set!!! Thank you, Lanora Beauty!!!</li>
    <li> Blending is amazing.  So glad I choose these brushes. Used them for a bride this weekend absolutely no shedding. Amazing!!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these brushes, they are absolutely amazing. Lamora beauty has the best brushes in the whole world lol</li>
    <li> I was slightly hesitant before ordering them online because I had no way of feeling the bristles, and I was only able to base my decision off of previous reviews. But let me tell you, these are absolutely AMAZING brushes!!!!! Fantastic quality! Comes with a tutorial so you know how to use each brush. The price for these bad boys is quite a steal!!! Get them while you can</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these brushes for about two weeks now, and I love them! So soft and durable for the price. I was using a much more expensive brand and now I&#x27;ll never go back. I purchased these brushes based off of other reviews and I&#x27;m so happy that I did, worth the money 100%!</li>
    <li> As a few other recent reviewers have mentioned, the toxic smell is overwhelming.  I had to set these brushes in the spare bedroom because the fumes were so strong.  I have to believe there has been a recent cheapening of manufacturing because the brushes that I received would have never garnered such glowing reviews.  They smell worse than a can of spray paint.</li>
    <li> These brushes are so soft and they gave me flawless application! Will be buying more!</li>
    <li> This is under my sons name but I just had to do a review anyway! Absolute wonder set of brushes!  They are so soft yet do exactly what is needed!  I will buy more for gift for my sisters at Christmas!</li>
    <li> Very impressed with the quality of these brushes. They are very comparable to sigma brushes but much more affordable, my favorites are the tapered kabuki and angled kabuki.  Have washed them various times and not a hair has shed. They are dense enough to get a nice blend and super soft. Came with a cute brush holder which I use to store them when not being used.</li>
    <li> I really like this 10 sweep, floating light level up! But also brought a bag! I love this!</li>
    <li> This brush set is absolutely worth the money - especially at their sale price for a limited time! I have been searching for the perfect brush set and have consider Mac, Sephora, Sigma...you name it.. I came across this brush set and decided to give it a try and I am SO glad I did!! They are the perfect firmness (not too lose and not too firm) and all 10 brushes are great quality.  If you are looking for good brushes for everyday make up or contouring, this is the perfect set, and you can&#x27;t beat the price.  The leather carrying case is also a MUST have for all make up brushes, and they really went above and beyond with this set. If you are looking for a great quality brush set for a low price, THIS is the right one to purchase. I have a Sephora Pro Airbrush #55 that cost $38 dollars, and with this kit you get 10 brushes plus a case for cheaper!  I will definitely check out Lamora products in the future.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush set for my wife. She was thrilled and raved about how soft and how high quality these brushes were. I have never seen such a reaction to a gift before! What a pleasant surprise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, whatever Lamora did to create these brushes gets a high five from me!</li>
    <li> These are amazing I&#x27;m just a average girl that wears basic makeup everyday to work . I love these brushes there super soft and the handles are sturdy , it does have a weird smell but I washed mines with baby shampoo and it&#x27;s gone . The travel case is a must . I would recommend these to anyone who needs a good set of makeup brushes . The only con is I wish I had a manual or book on how to use the brushes for best use and a brush for the eyebrows</li>
    <li> Beautiful packaging, super soft, beautiful brushes for a great price! Amazing when you have a seller text your phone to make sure you received and are happy with the product!</li>
    <li> I luvvvvvvvvv my purchase. Its been over a year I made my purchase and feel I owe it to Lamora to write this review. The case is like a state of the art case and looks elegant as well as protects my brushes extremely well while I travel. I am careful about my make up and like to preserve everything in good condition. I hate distorted bristles and the case was perfect and despite taking at least 15 flights last year my case and brushes look BRAND NEW!!!!! I luv you Lamora : ))  The brushes are a very good looking set of brushes. They save time and I get done in half the time I usually took in application and blending. They waste less product because of the well designed synthetic bristles. My foundation lasted me 3 months when I used a make up sponge  and now its lasted me 8 months. with these brushes.  I am ABSOLUTELY DELIGHTED with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for some synthetic brushes for awhile now but couldn&#x27;t talk myself into spending $100 for a set of brushes. I randomly came across these one day even though I was skeptical about the quality of these brushes at first, it was fairly cheap and I thought to give it a try. I am so glad because I am blown away by the amazing quality of these brushes; they are not only soft but very dense. I&#x27;ve been using them everyday since I got them, no fall out from everyday use, and no fallout from wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do own some Sigma brushes as well and these are, to me, way better. It is affordable and on par with every major brand of brushes I own. I will be getting a 2nd set for my sister.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: Just get it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Love the brushes. Very soft, and the greatest part is that he bristles dont come off! Love this!</li>
    <li> I just ordered this set (silver) and am super impressed with the quality!! Very soft brushes and I love the plating, although I wish I had ordered gold (just a personal preference). The tapered and angled kabuki brushes are quite dense which will be wonderful for foundation and contouring. The eye brushes are wonderful as well. The makeup brush holder is a wonderful bonus and has sturdy leather feel with snaps. Absolutely perfect!! I just wish I had them in good! 10 out of 10 from me!</li>
    <li> really good brush, easy to use and clean. product as describe</li>
    <li> I bought these for my fiancee and she absolutely loves it! She talks about how soft they are and thought the brushes were made from real animals and was surprised to find out that they are synthetic. She couldn&#x27;t believe how amazing the quality of these brushes were compared to some top name brands.</li>
    <li> I like these brushes very much!  The brushes work well and don&#x27;t leave hairs on my face.  Make up stays on the brushes which is great.  I also like how soft the brushes are and there were so many brushes included in the set, so I have alot more options now.  I would definitely recommend these brushes.</li>
    <li> Superb customer service. Quality product and makeup bag. Fast shipment.</li>
    <li> I just recently bought these brushes. I have a sigma highlighting brush. Let me tell you girls, ladies, women: these brushes work great!! Especially considering the low low price.A total airbrush finish. There are many brushes large and small to choose from in order for you to have ALL the of the tools you&#x27;ll need to put a great foundation on your face whether it&#x27;s full, medium, or light coverage, and because of the kinds of brushes provided you&#x27;ll be able to do some great contouring ( bone sculpting) as well. Any woman or man with a woman reading this I seriously would HIGHLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU GO BUY THEM NOW ... NOW...!! BEFORE THEY HIKE THE PRICE UP. Because I have tons of HIGH DOLLAR brushes and these Lamora brushes are worth way way more than they are selling for.I use them when I put on my foundation almost every time... The only reason why I don&#x27;t use them EVERY time is only because I have so many different brushes and have so many moods. ;) Besides experimenting with all of your brushes is good. So I mix it up. It surely has nothing to do with the Lamora brush quality and results. They are  not to hard nor too flimsy. They are very soft on your facial skin and pick up product well. I think it relevant to mention that I also have almost the entire line of IT brushes.. so I know very good brushes. Please do yourself a favor and trust me: a sephora VIB ROUGE COSMETIC PRODUCT JUNKIE....(addicted to quality beauty products) go buy them NOW!! Put down what your doing and buy them. You won&#x27;t regret it. Even if you&#x27;ve already got a set of foundation brushes. Good brushes should be bought because: you just never know for what different things you may want to use each brush for. Each brush can have its own product and it&#x27;s own purpose..if your a person like me--somewhat OCD. They DO NOT shed. The glue holding the brush together is solid. They feel good in your hands. Not to short and not so long that your hitting the mirror. They clean well. They function like my brushes that cost $34-58 a piece. No lie. The only thing that could possibly make these brushes ANY better ( and this is for Lamora IN HOPES that they might listen and make this slight change for the better of this product, is: the density could be a little bit thicker. Not that they are thin by ANY means, I just believe that extensively thick brushes are more rich and feel much better on one&#x27;s skin.. while providing an extra oomph in airbrush capabilities. I repeat these are great. But even great things can be improved; these can hang with MAC and Sigma all day long. And if you (Lamora) make these a bit more dense these brushes would be a real force to be reckoned with for those other brands, especially if you keep the price reasonable. Thanks Lamora. Sweet product. Looking forward to watching you grow.shes that cost $34-58 a piece. No lie.

    <li> Five star customer service!  They response the question in time and solved any problems without hassle.  Great product! The brushes are so soft and comfortable on the face. Lived the black leather cup holder for the brushes!  I bought 4 for giving out as gifts. I know the girls are going to love it just I I do.  Highly recommended for everyone!  Will do business again!</li>
    <li> Love these brushes !!!</li>
    <li> I was in the process of searching for brushes when I came upon these - Based on all of the reviews I decided to order and I am happy with my order! The brushes are super soft and come nicely packaged in the container.  Of course you must wash your brushes before use - however the variety in the pack is great! Just what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping! Love my brush set! Thank you!!!!</li>
    <li> Love these brushes! They are soooooo soft!! Yet dense so it picks up powder without absorbing into the brush. Much better than the sephora brushes.</li>
    <li> When I was building my make up I build up my brushes. From different brands I spent about $32-40 dollars on just one brush. Unfortunately I went on a trip and lost my brushes. I had to get something quick and was looking into sigma. Luckily I came across Lamora and purchased them. I was nervous at first but I received then quickly. Washed them and tried them out the next day. They are amazing! No shedding nothing. I was so pleased I purchased a second set for my sister n she loves them as much as I do! So inexpensive and such great quality you can&#x27;t get any better deal.</li>
    <li> I have to say that as an artist, these brushes are an amazing additional to my collection. Not only are they made really well, and properly weighted in your hand, they provide smooth seemless application with every texture of product, liquid, powder, cream. And can we talk about the incredible value?? Invest in these, and I promise you, you will not be dissappointed. They will easily become your fave go to tools.</li>
    <li> Very nice set of brushes. They come in a large makeup bag to keep them all in one place. Various sizes for makeup, eye shadows and lips. They are washable.</li>
    <li> Very soft brushes.  have only used four as of now and enjoy them.  I have only used one other brand before, but these are very soft and easy to clean.  They are a bit longer than some so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend them as your travel set.  When you open the case, it smells a bit and I have it airing out.  I think it will be fine.  As of now I have them in a little glass vase.</li>
    <li> I bought these brushes several months ago and they are perfect.  I will buy from again!</li>
    <li> super soft and good quality.</li>
    <li> These brushes are are soft and good quality. They are a must have.</li>
    <li> I did a video reviewing these brushes, and I love them!!!! They are soft, only shed a little bit before washing the first time, and blend makeup wonderfully! For my whole review, feel free to watch my video :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;6DvQZpXA0zk&amp;feature&#x3D;youtu.be</li>
    <li> Am really loving my brush set.  Very soft and comfortable on my face,  no scratches or nothimg. Very satisfied customer</li>
    <li> Amazing brushes!  Amazing price and a company that really wants to please customers.  You really can&#x27;t go wrong.  I&#x27;ll be ordering more.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Received my brush set and it is absolutely amazing, the case is a bigger bonus, they are so soft and makes the application look flawless and the price was so affordable</li>
    <li> These brushes are the best I have used. They apply makeup flawlessly.  Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this set. You won&#x27;t be sorry!!!!</li>
    <li> Great set of brushes.  Very good value.  Very soft and don&#x27;t shed.</li>
    <li> These makeup brush set Kabuki brushes by Lamora are great. I purchase them because it attracts me when I saw them, read description product👍 then the brushes are zoom in large and like it again👌. This is the one for me. The brushes are amazing in blending liquid makeup and feels good to the skin.  I use it everyday, it is worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;It will be my makeup tool forever❤️</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast, product is great!  I watched several reviews on YouTube before I purchased.  Most loved the product, but some complained of shedding.  I have had my brushes for two weeks now, and I have seen NO shedding! These brushes are a must have and are very comparable to the higher priced brands. My daughter has those brushes and is constantly stealing my Lamora brushes.</li>
    <li> This was a good purchase to get me started working with a set of kabuki brushes. They haven&#x27;t shed (maybe a couple of hairs when I first unwrapped the packaging- nothing to complain about) and they&#x27;ve held up nicely so far. The black makes them look sleek and professional and I like the faux leather case they came in. Easy for traveling. They are dense and soft and you get a nice variety of sizes. This is a good buy for someone looking to try some brushes without paying a high price!</li>
    <li> Best value ever. I was skeptical about what I though we&#x27;re cheap brushes since all my brushes are from mac. My mac brushes all shed even though they are great brushes. I have this set for three months now. What I think make them great is that they do not shed. Application and the application is flawless.</li>
    <li> I ordered these b/c of all the great reviews. I&#x27;m a makeup junkie, have it and tried it all! These are nice, pretty good quality but I still think Mac has the best brushes out there...especially the smaller ones. All of these are fairly large and bulky...perfect for blush/foundation/powder. I&#x27;ve only used 5 of the larger ones...and have liked &#x27;em. Not the best top quality but pretty good. Worth the $ b/c compared to the prices of Mac or Chanel burshes ($30-$40 each!) these are a great deal. Try it.</li>
    <li> These brushes are so incredibly soft and they are a joy to use.</li>
    <li> really good brushes .. Excellent .. Very soft. N perfect to apply foundation n everything else.. Worth spending money ..</li>
    <li> Very good quality and do the work perfectly well. I haven&#x27;t seen one little hair coming off the brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I think Lamora does a really great job giving you the correct information on how to use your brushes and how to take good care of them.</li>
    <li> The brushes are high quality. I am very happy with the purchase as well as the fast professional transaction. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Love these brushes! Great Blending Power...a little shedding at first</li>
    <li> I love this set so much I went to purchase another just like it!  The bristles are soft, easy to clean with baby shampoo, and dry within a day.  I&#x27;ve always been using a sponge to apply my makeup and didn&#x27;t realize just how well brushes work.  It&#x27;s a smooth, matt-like finish that looks professionally done.  I&#x27;m sold on brushes from now on.</li>
    <li> Amazzing, sigma quality</li>
    <li> LOVE!! More affordable than MAC brushes, but equal in quality of not better!! Leaves your foundation looking flawless!</li>
    <li> They work great! Can be used for many different makeup styles! The only thing is that I would have preferred them to be bigger. In the picture they look bigger in size than in person but either than that, they work just fine!!</li>
    <li> Amazing.  So soft. . Apply makeup beautifully.  I was about to spend the money on the sigma brushes I hear raves about. ... and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t.  I am extremely happy with the quality of this product.  :)</li>
    <li> These brushes are really good! At first I was iffy if I should purchase them or not and just keep saving up for the sigma ones but I&#x27;m so happy that I bought these! I use them everyday and put my other brushes aside!</li>
    <li> These brushes feel professional for a great price.  I love these brushes!</li>
    <li> Great brushes, as good as It brushes but at tenth of the price, hope to see and buy more sets in the future, thanks Lamora!</li>
    <li> I bought these on my husbands account but I felt awkward reviewing these brushes under the name Ricardo so it doesn&#x27;t say I&#x27;m a verified purchase of this product but trust me, I have them and I love them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received them last night, washed them (per Lamora&#x27;s recommendation) and could not WAIT to use them this morning!  First of all, the quality looks amazing and the case is pretty money as well but lets move on...they feel like heaven!  They are probably about 100x softer than any MAC brush that I own and the flawless coverage you get with them is beyond expectation!  They do not seem to absorb product so you can rest assure you&#x27;re not wasting more product than necessary.  When I was looking at brushes I originally wanted to buy a Sigma brush kit but lets be honest, I&#x27;m too cheap for that nonsense.  I have wasted enough money on MAC and other expensive brushes that I hate so when I saw these I was thinking &amp;#34;What&#x27;s the worst that could happen?  I waste $40 on some brushes I don&#x27;t like? I&#x27;ve done that before...but I&#x27;m not wasting $180 on some brushes I hate&amp;#34;.  Anyway, I don&#x27;t feel at all like I&#x27;ve wasted my money, in fact...I sort of feel like I&#x27;ve robbed the fine people over at Lamora because these brushes were a steal!  I see that the price has increased since I ordered last week which I completely understand now that I&#x27;ve used them.  I&#x27;d pay the $120 for them and not bat an eye or feel bad.  These brushes are worth every penny!  Just shut up and buy them already!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, one more thing...A lot of my other brushes make my face hurt during application and for like an hour after I do my makeup.  I&#x27;m not sure if I am the only person with this issue but my other brushes sort of feel like I&#x27;m stabbing myself with tiny pins and my face kind of itches for an hour or so after I do my makeup.  I didn&#x27;t experience this AT ALL with these brushes and my face feels normal (as if I applied with my fingers).  I mean, seriously...just stop reading this review and put these in your cart already!</li>
    <li> I bought this set for my sister who is picky about her beauty products and she loves these brushes.</li>
    <li> Brushes are a bit larger than I expected but work beautiful none the less.  No shedding of the brushes thus far.  Easy clean up, nice feel in the hand and the storage container is a definite plus.</li>
    <li> I really like these brushes they are so soft and durable and I LOVE the fact that they have their name on the side of it so I know which brush is which but I really don&#x27;t know a lot about brushes and what kind does what do I have to go online to see what each brushes purpose is when usually something would come with the brush to tell you therefore I haven&#x27;t gotten to use them that much because I havnt done my research yet but overall the are awesome definitely worth the money!</li>
    <li> Best makeup brushes ever!  Brushes are soft, which is perfect for sensitive skin. They deposit the perfect amount of pigment and help to blend makeup into a very natural finish. Worth the investment as you will use less makeup but get more coverage.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes! So full and soft. A good feel holding them too. Never realized how horrible my other brushes were until I got these! Trashed the old ones and feel like I have a set of  &amp;#34;grown women&#x27;s&amp;#34; make up brushes that I deserve. I buy pricey make up and feel better applying it with proper brushes. Worth every penny! Love the brush case too. Very nice stuff!</li>
    <li> Good product , only thing is the smell of blush but hope it is better after wash</li>
    <li> These brushes are GREAT!  In comparison to my Mac brushes,  Sedona Lace brushes &amp; Sigma brushes Lamora Beauty rank very high. I have NO shedding and the makeup application the brushes give are AMAZING! The brushes are extremely soft. My favorite thing to do is use the small fiber brush to apply my concealer or my mac paint pot. I also enjoy the cute leather cup case that the brushes came in. I use the case as a brush holder. I did a video review on these brushes because I love them so much. Check out my video. MrsFabBeautyBlog is my YouTube name. Thanks Lamora Beauty!</li>
    <li> Not the best quality! I&#x27;m disappointed ...</li>
    <li> Great brushes, no shedding, applies makeup well. Comparable to high end brushes!</li>
    <li> The brushes are pretty good&lt;br /&gt;They are soft and they make the product go on smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;However when I got the package I only got 9 of the 10 brushes which was very upsetting.</li>
    <li> I am excited about receiving this brush set.  I have not gotten to use many brushes yet but overall, they are of a very nice weight and are very soft and look like they will be quite durable.  They also come with an e-guide that explains their uses, which is quite helpful.  Also, the brushes that are included are brushes that I am likely to use most of.  Some sets include such strange brushes I know I will never work with, which makes the price even higher per usable brush.  Happy to have accidentally stumbled across this lovely surprise online!</li>
    <li> Great brushes for the price. I was kind of skeptical at first because I&#x27;ve never heard of the brand but I happy I got them! They are soft and apply flawlessly. I like the flat kabuki for foundation, angled for contouring, tapered for under eye concealer and the precision brushes for concealing &amp; highlighting.  And it comes with a brush holder! The only thing is the brush holder smells pretty bad.</li>
    <li> Ohhhhhhhh I love my Lamora brushes!&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how I ever lived without them&#x27; they go were ever I go. They are so soft soft ans smooth. They make my makeup flawless. And I love my leather case it&#x27;s so top of the line. All the ladies in my family want to own a set. These brushes make me feel like a Professional make up artist. I&#x27;m gonna need a second set just to keep in my car when I&#x27;m traveling. I recommend this set for all you ladies every where you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Excellent product!! My fiancé loved them. She had been looking for a set and gave these a try. They have exceeded her expectations and said they are just as good or better than the known name brands. Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> The brushes are great quality brushes and I have to say I love them!. I followed the instructions and I washed them. There was no shedding  of any sort. I&#x27;m no expert when it comes to makeup and makeup brushes but these brushes are really soft, works with my makeup perfectly and I like how the case turns into two cupholders and it&#x27;s great if I need to travel. I recommend these brushes to anyone.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Amazing brushes for an amazing price! They are super soft and don&#x27;t shed. These brushes are just as good as ones that cost a lot more $.</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed using these brushes! Extremely soft, but dense enough for great application. I bought them at $45 and couldn&#x27;t be more happy. A lot of Sephora brushes shed but these haven&#x27;t so far. I would definitely buy these or another Lamora Beauty product again!</li>
    <li> I love the brushes! They are so soft!</li>
    <li> I really love how soft these brushes are. They apply well and don&#x27;t shed when I clean them. I&#x27;m a fan!</li>
    <li> This was a gift and it has been received exceptionally well.  The brushes are excellent, very few if any loose bristles and a nice balanced weight.  Overall these brushes present an exceptional value while delivering an equally high level quality.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these brushes, I use high end mineral foundation and liquid drugstore foundation and with these brushes, nobody can tell the difference! Each application is flawless and these brushes make applying concealer, foundation and powder so easy. I have no idea what I ever did without them, I am a fan of Lamora for life!  Update, 2015: I bought these brushes in October of last year (2014). They have NEVER shedded on me, they still look like I just bought them yesterday. They still work as well or better than the first day I tried them. I switched to MAC Studio Fix and I swear the Lamora Round Kabuki blends my foundation like no other. I look absolutely airbrushed. As a comparison, I tried to Tarte Bamboo brush and the MAC 196, The Lamora Round Kabuki and the Flat Angled Kabuki outperforms them both. I had no idea when buying these brushes I would be buying such quality, but I am so glad I did.  I am a cynic by nature, but Lamora has made me a believer. I absolutely love these brushes and if anything ever happened to them, I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to purchase them again. Seriously, if you have any doubts about buying them, don&#x27;t, they really are that good.</li>
    <li> These brushes are wonderful. I love the feel of them and even though I have only just gotten them I compared them to my Bare Escentuals brushes ($20-$30 each) and IMO they are a much better quality brush. I have not noticed any shedding so far. Unfortunately, my set was missing one brush I am trying to get that taken care of with customer service and hopefully it will be resolved soon.</li>
    <li> If you didn&#x27;t get the email (like Disappointed Rosanne) email me @ babysteps_5@live.com &amp; I&#x27;ll gladly fwd it to you. :)&lt;br /&gt;These are REALLY soft! &amp; I love the case! I looked into buying Sigma or Mac brushes &amp; although the quality of those is prob better, I&#x27;m not paying for two or three brushes what this whole set cost me! I bought the set of 10 &amp; set of 7. So 17 brushes for $75 is roughly $5/brush!!!&lt;br /&gt;Plus! Sears.com sells them for $170!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought the Lamora makeup brush set for the first time. I used it and the brushes are so soft, blend my foundation to a flawless look. I already have a few pieces from the Sigma line and I really don&#x27;t see or feel any difference.  I will not by anymore from Sigma because Lamora is just as good or maybe better because it cost less for the same type of brushes.  Thank you Lamora your brushes are wonderful and the price is worth it.</li>
    <li> Amazing brushes that seem more expensive then they actually are. The quality and their application are incredible and flawless.  Great purchase!</li>
    <li> I love these brushes so much that I bought a second set for my teenage daughter for Christmas. They are super soft and do not shed at all. The brushes are well made and the handle are sturdy.  I have paid the same price for one brush elsewhere and that brush sheds all the time. These brushes are a steal at this set price.</li>
    <li> I like my brushes very much, the only thing is that I don&#x27;t know how to use the flat  small ones.  They wash very nice they are incredibly soft, and for the price, they are really a great deal!  I wish they have a tutorial so I can learn the use of the flat ones.  Great purchase!</li>
    <li> love my new brush set.  I&#x27;m enjoying them everyday.&lt;br /&gt;Having done makeup for years can tell this set was put&lt;br /&gt;together with much thought and planning.  Very professional.&lt;br /&gt; thank you</li>
    <li> I love this set of Lamora brushes. The set is  high-quality made and looks very chic.  The only recommendation I would give if you want to broaden your buyers categories is to write the name-purpose on each brush. You have detailed description attached when the brushes first come in, but that piece of paper gets lost eventually and a person end up with a lot of pretty brushes saying &amp;#34;Lamora&amp;#34; on each with no clue how to use them. Customers who are new to make up will definitely appreciate that touch.</li>
    <li> I received the brushes in a timely fashion. I love makeup and have used a limited amount of brushes through out my 55 years. They seem like nice makeup brushes. I read up on makeup&lt;br /&gt;Brushes , synthetic verses natural, after the fact , again not the sellers fault. Why I gave 3 stars is that the seller promises email explaining the different brushes and what the use is. I never got that email. I have little knowledge of what to use but it would be great if they had instructions to what the brushes are used for. They give some idea with the larger brushes but little to NOTHING on the smaller eye brushes. Please send some info about them. What is the purpose of selling and purchasing these or any other makeup&lt;br /&gt;Brushes to novices if you don&#x27;t explain what their purposes are. Thank you</li>
    <li> Brushes are soft. Little to no shedding.  The carry case/tube can fit more brushes (like small eye detail brushes). Also the little face towels the set comes with are very nice and they also have very little shedding to none.</li>
    <li> Thank you for the brushes! They&#x27;re soft, easy to work with and I love the packaging! They are perfect!!! Arrived on time, everything was so smoothly dealt with! Will definitely repurchase! The one con thing I will say is the smell of the brushes, it had a rubbery scent to it. But I don&#x27;t mind. After a few washes, it went away.</li>
    <li> This brusher are my favorite they are really amazing.... Its really soft and easy to use</li>
    <li> Great product!!! ..the bristle is so nice!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s awesome ! so soft and incredible for blending...</li>
    <li> This is one of the best cosmetic I&#x27;ve ever made. This is a great value.</li>
    <li> Great price n I love the brushes :)</li>
    <li> Great price for a great set of brushes. Very soft and durable.</li>
    <li> These are amazing brushes. I&#x27;ve  been in the cosmetic industry for about 8 years now and was hesitant to buy online with out trying but it was well worth it! These brushes are perfect for application of foundation (cream and powder) as well as placing and blending eyeshadow. The synthetic bristles are easy to clean and don&#x27;t loose their original soft texture after wear (or the bristles!). Well worth the buy if you are looking for a versitile set that applies smooth. Very happy customer!!</li>
    <li> This is one excellent value.  The brushes are of exceptional quality, and if that doesn&#x27;t convince you, I saw these same brushes on sears.com for $170.00!  Also, other web sites have the cost around $75 - $100.  Thank you Lamora and amazon.com for one of my best purchases in beauty ever!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have a very elaborate brush set so this was my first.  I&#x27;m still trying to decide if I really like it but it&#x27;s definitely an upgrade from what I had before.  I really like the blush brush but I wish some of the other powder brushes were denser and bigger.  Still not quite sure what brush to use for what but it&#x27;s still a great value.</li>
    <li> I love this brush set.  The case is god quality and brushes are very soft.  Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> **Update 11/18/14: brushes are still as good as they were brand new. No shedding and perfect condition even after washing numerous times!!    **Update 4/19/14: after a week or so of using these brushes, I am still totally happy. Work great and no shedding. They never had a smell and am still loving them!    All I can say is I am super impressed! I was a little leery ordering these brushes even with the good reviews because you just never know. I was deciding between a sigma brush set and this one. I have to say so far I am very pleased and super excited about my brushes. They are the softest brushes I own so far. I was very impressed with the black \\&quot;cup\\&quot; packaging. It by far exceeded my expectations. It is something I will actually use as oppose to throwing it away like I thought I would do. It is that nice! The brushes are fantastic. I washed them with Philosophy purity face wash. No hairs shredded and a very nice brush. They kept their shape really well. I can&#x27;t wait to use them more. I will post an update after a few weeks and let you know how they are holding up. I would love if the name of each brush was printed on them like a lot of reviewers have mentioned but it is something I heard they are working on. Also would love to see some more eyebrow, eyeshadow, concealer, etc brushes. The ones that came were great don&#x27;t get me wrong, just can&#x27;t ever have too many for different purposes or colors!    I cannot wait to see what other brushes they put out! I will definitely buy more! I am so glad I stumbled across this set before spending the same amount on half as many brushes!!</li>
    <li> I love this set! The brushes are so soft and durable. They barely shed, if at all, when washed. They blend face and eye make up to a flawless finish. For the price they&#x27;re great and I would recommend them to anyone looking for great tools for their make up application.</li>
    <li> This bush set is actually an investment, the quality of the brushes is amazing and the feeling in your face is great! I was hesitant to buy it as I was looking for something cheaper, indeed. But after making some calculations I realized that each brush would cost me less than 5 bucks each and still getting the case for free!! So I took the chance and made the purchase, and I definitely don&#x27;t regret it!! All, quality and excellent customer service worth every penny!! I&#x27;m actually thinking on buying another one for my sister&#x27;s birthday :D</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been contemplating for months now whether to buy the Sigmax Essential Kabuki Brush set from Sigma but kept putting it off because of the price. So glad I came across these brushes on Amazon. Great brushes!! Definitely comparable to Sigma and MAC brushes with 3/4 less of the cost! The brushes are really soft yet packs on the product to give great coverage.  Especially impressed with the case that comes with the brushes! Very sturdy and professional looking. The brush case alone looks like it cost 3 times the price!! Overall definitely exceeds my expectation and very very happy I made the purchase :)</li>
    <li> Best brush set I have ever used .</li>
    <li> I have read tons of superb reviews on these brushes. I also see that they are very similar to sigma brushes which are almost 3 times expensive. So why not purchase these when you get the same result.</li>
    <li> I love this Kabuki Powder brush set! They work so much better than my Chanel brushes. I like them so much that I plan on gifting them to all of the wonderful women in my life this Christmas!!!</li>
    <li> High-quality brushes with cheap price.</li>
    <li> The brushes seem to be of great quality so far, I like the variety of the sizes and types. Great deal for the amount of brushes and the price. The clean up easily and the makeup goes on smoothly</li>
    <li> what a waste of money.  The brushes are waaaaaaaaaaaaaaay to firm.  I finally went and purchased some where I could feel the texture.  I would have liked to have returned them but they come from China.... if anyone on here knows about returning China products, you know what I mean.  You are stuck.  I do like the case they came in, and</li>
    <li> This is the first makeup brush set I have owned and I absolutely love it! The brushes are extremely soft and I love the way my makeup looks when I&#x27;m finished. Definitely a great product!</li>
    <li> Love this brush set!! They are just as great as any MAC brushes. Such a great deal on such a great product!! I fell in love with them and all of my friends went out and bought their own</li>
    <li> Amazing brushes! Works very well with wet foundation!!</li>
    <li> I love love these brushes. So soft and lovely to use. I&#x27;m happy with this purchase</li>
    <li> The bristles are soft and feel like they are high quality.  Unfortunately, the handles are simply glued to the brush heads.  They detach easily.  They should be riveted or screwed in place.  In retrospect I never would have purchased this set.</li>
    <li> These brushes are great!!! Sooo soft and long thick handles! Love these!!! So far so good! I am very pleased. Price is great too!</li>
    <li> Very nice brush set.  The brushes are sturdy and they do not shed.  You cannot go wrong for this price!</li>
    <li> I have got these for a friend and I was amazed at the quality they are excellent&lt;br /&gt;elegantly designed the hold the bristles they were dense and soft&lt;br /&gt;in fact I was amazed at the quality of the brushes they are very similar to the quality of top brands brushes&lt;br /&gt;at asking my friend she said she tried them with both powder and cream makeup and were so great easy to blend and carry product very well .. small brushes more than perfect&lt;br /&gt;those arrived on time and in great condition and packaging too&lt;br /&gt;thank you Lamora</li>
    <li> I love these brushes, they feel way better than the MAC ones for a lot less. What&#x27;s really amazing is that they don&#x27;t shed all over the place like other brushes.</li>
    <li> You need to get this product ASAP. This product the price to quality ratio is outstanding. These brushes are so soft and apply make up great. I cannot tell you how much I adore Lamora brushes. The case is also very nice and convenient. If you are thinking of buying over priced sigma or mac brushes you are wasting your money because Lamora honestly has the same or better quality than other brands. I cannot express more how much I do love their products. i recently purchased my eye brush set is on its way!</li>
    <li> the collection of brushes is redundant, it doesn&#x27;t include any fine tip brushes</li>
    <li> Love my brushes. I&#x27;ve used a couple a few times since getting them. The only con for me is that the thin ones still seem a bit thick for my liking, so I&#x27;ve had to use some of my old ones too. Other then that really good quality and soft.</li>
    <li> Lovely brushes, soft and perform well. No problems with fallout have washed a few times already and they look exactly the same.</li>
    <li> I have to say at first glance I loved the container the brushes came in! Second I&#x27;ve been using the brushes since I got them and I absolutely love them!! So soft and def blends my foundation well!! I would def recommend these brushes!!</li>
    <li> Where do I begin? To make it short and simple, these brushes are a must have!  The kabooki flat brush is on par with Sigma&#x27;s flat F80.  I washed the brushes beforehand and have been using them since I received them.  For this price, I recommend to any makeup lover, beginner or advanced, to have these in your set.  The leather bag they come in is very nice as well!</li>
    <li> Love them so much just ordered the eye brush set😍</li>
    <li> I like this set sooooooo much! They are a lot better than the Lancome brushes I have, and of course less expensive. They don&#x27;t shed and apply the beauty products quite evenly. Also, the case is a very good organizer, which makes this set even better. I highly recommend this product and will purchse some more as gifts.</li>
    <li> Love them  great  brushes  lots of varying styles and shapes this set is all you will ever need in makeup brushes.</li>
    <li> Bought these brushes for my girl &amp; she loved them. Everytime she uses them, she makes it a point to let me know how great they are.</li>
    <li> Great, quality product. Super great price!! Customer service &#x3D; excellent. Company is dedicated to customer satisfaction. Definitely recommend this merchant!!!!</li>
    <li> By far these are the best brushes I&#x27;ve used.  They have no chemical smell, a plus for me because I am hyper-sensitive to smells.  Any cosmetic goes on smoothly, providing coverage that looks so natural.  I love these brushes!!</li>
    <li> I love the brushes, really good quality and good price!!</li>
    <li> Very good brushes, love the case as well</li>
    <li> I bought these brushes for my wife&#x27;s birthday and she loved them.</li>
    <li> Great brush set, comparable to my MAC and Sifma brushes if not better. May even purchase another set as a gift.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with this purchase. Nice product and nice price! The cylinder case is not too large like I believe I read in another review. Its a perfect size and fit for these 10 brushes.  The company emails a nice brochure with tips on the product and how to apply your makeup...nice extra.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing eliminating a star is the followup phone calls from the company to ask product satisfaction questions, etc. I didn&#x27;t know I signed up for that and the calls came in later in the evening which is dedicated family time for me! It was very telemarketer-ish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But overall -- Love the  brushes so far.  Definitely preferred over my Sigma brushes that shed (and two broke!)..which led to this purchase at over 50% less!</li>
    <li> Great service. Love the brushes!! A++</li>
    <li> So I have been using these brushes since I have received them. I love them!! My makeup simply looks differently than from my generic brushes. I highly recommend these for anyone that is getting into makeup!!</li>
    <li> Forget Mac.,Sigma  and etc. there is a new standard of quality in the World of Beauty! .  I LOVE LOVE my  Lamora kabuki brush set.  I have been using them for approximately three weeks.  I am not sure of what I did prior  to this purchase.  LADIES ,it&#x27;s a  highly qualitative investment,  especially if your existence  and viability are contingent on a budget.  THE BRUSHES DOES NOT, DOES NOT SHED, even after washing them.  It&#x27;s often said that you get what you pay for.  But in this case, YOU GET SO MUCH MORE!  YOU will not be disappointed. Now, you can get that professional made up look via the use of this investment.</li>
    <li> I bought these as an early Christmas gift for my daughter. She was thrilled and she loves them! Sidney had asked for makeup brushes and it wasn&#x27;t until she opened these did I realize she was more than a little anxious about what I might buy for her. She showed open relief, that&#x27;s when I realized i&#x27;d chosen correctly. It really pays to read customer comments because that&#x27;s all I had to go by. I knew nothing about makeup brushes (I still don&#x27;t), but my daughter does. She called last night to say how great they are and that there are more than enough for everything she uses them for. What can I say? Another happy customer.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes!!!!</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews on these brushes, watched the reviews from youtubers... everyone had something positive to say about it! So, I did research and compared them to the Sigma Kabuki brushes and found out that they are the same thing!! This saved me so much money &amp; I received them in 2 days. I love the container they come in. I&#x27;ve done my makeup once with these and fell in love instantly! I would recommend these to anyone who has a love for makeup!</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing for applying foundation and concealer.  I also have used them for eyeshadow.  I will never need to buy more expensive brushes!</li>
    <li> Since this was my first brush purchase I was really sure what to expect, but I don&#x27;t know of it was just instincts because as soon as I had these brushes I knew they were perfect a feeling just told me. So after I used them my feelings weren&#x27;t wrong. I love how my make up comes out! Flawless!</li>
    <li> great brushes!! i was going to get sigma brush on amazon. these brushes looks good quality on pics and rewiews. Then i decide to give a try. both brushes and the brush bag are goof quality. brushes are really soft, they helped me apply my foundation easily. i got sigma F80 later than these. i like both of them!! i use sigma apply the foundation at left side face and use lamora apply the other side. i can&#x27;t tell any differents. compare with the price, these are must get brushes. i will definitely purchase again</li>
    <li> Unfortunately I sent them back because after looking at them in person I felt the large brushes were too much the same and the same for the thinner brushes.  It was to be a gift for  my granddaughter.I should have bought a 3 or 4 pack set. This would have been more appropriate  for an 18 year old girl. I will say that they certainly are beautiful and maybe I was very wrong in my decision.</li>
    <li> It is my first time getting makeup brushes that don&#x27;t just come with the makeup. I can never go back now. These are so soft and good quality, it really makes the chore of applying makeup feel more like pampering myself :)</li>
    <li> Love these brushes&amp;#34; Can&#x27;t remember what life was like before these brushes, oh yeah picking little pieces of brush fiber from my face, NOT with these Brushes, NO shedding, soft, easy to clean, work great, and great price. LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> The price it´s great, the customer service too. I am beginning to use and i´m happy until now. I will try during long term and i can get a definitive criterium. When they arrive the smell its strong but after first wash the strong smell finish.</li>
    <li> Amazing brushes! After purchasing some for myself, my friend feel in love with them. So I bought some for her birthday. Extremely happy about my purchase😍</li>
    <li> Love, love, love these brushes!!! Although I don&#x27;t use all the brushes in this set, the ones I do use are great. No shedding!!! Holds and move makeup very well. I do own a brush from the other line that starts with &amp;#34;M&amp;#34; and I must say for the money the quality is awesome! . Just purchased the eye set with the coupon code I received from them. Soooo excited they came out with an eye set!!!! Can&#x27;t wait to receive them!  Thanks! !</li>
    <li> Best brushes of my life!!!!!!! I would definitely buy them again... They work great, the quality is great!! I absolutely love them!!!</li>
    <li> Love Love Love!!!!! Just as wonderful as my MAC brushes!!!!!</li>
    <li> Fabulous brushes!!! Very quick shipping!!</li>
    <li> I really like these brushes! they pick up the product really well. I don&#x27;t use as much make up with these brushes.&lt;br /&gt;I have had them for 2 weeks now, and I wash them everyday with Sephora brush shampoo. I haven&#x27;t had any&lt;br /&gt;shedding yet.</li>
    <li> awesome brushes... very happy</li>
    <li> The great thing about being an Amazon Prime member is that almost everything I order always recieve my shipment in two days! I really love the brushes. I pretty much used it the very next day and cleaned it as well. I love the quality of the brushes. It reminds me of the sigma beauty brushes. After cleaning the brushes, they were still soft and it still retained it shape. I highly recommend these brushes.</li>
    <li> A little larger than expected</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t write a lot of product reviews but thought that this product is worth a review.  The brushes are excellent for the price.  These are great quality brushes and the application is fab!  The only complaint I have about the brushes are that it comes individually wrapped in plastic inside of a black bag.  The brushes smelled like really strong plastic/ chemicals.  I just had to wash them first before using them. The smell on the brushes went away but the bag is still pretty strong.  I can do without the bag.  All in all I&#x27;m so glad I bought this set!</li>
    <li> Love my brushes ❤. I will highly recommend</li>
    <li> These are wonderful brushes. So far, no shedding.</li>
    <li> Loved it....its soft and dont shed when u wash it</li>
    <li> I love these brushes. Excellent quality.</li>
    <li> Great brushes and quick shipment. I&#x27;m one happy girl! 😃</li>
    <li> these brushes are fabulous at first however i get extremely into doing make up and tend to do a full face every day. after about 6 months i noticed that my they started to get loose at the handles. the hairs on the brush are nice and soft and do apple makeup beautiful the reason i give them 3 stars is because they do not handle wear and tear well and i personally expect more from my makeup brushes</li>
    <li> Completely LOVE these brushes. they&#x27;re extremely soft and gentle on my skin and don&#x27;t leave little hairs everywhere. Plus the case makes it convenient to take everywhere.</li>
    <li> very soft, good quality and have a useful storage case. and overall good price-quality</li>
    <li> Great brushes very smooth minimal shedding during the first few uses but overall I love them!  Makeup application has resulted in a flawless look.  Saved me a lot of money.  Thank you</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the quality of the these brushes...and I love the case too.</li>
    <li> My daughter really loved these. Thanks</li>
    <li> I got these brushes a few days ago but wanted to try before giving a review. They came in wonderful packaging and right away I loved them! They feel heat as in sturdy good brushes....not like heavy my arm will fall off lol you can tell they are made with good material. The brush itself is stiff but so soft. So, far I used the all the big brushes and a couple of the smaller ones but they put on my makeup so well. Will definitely be buying some more sets from this seller. Love love them. Definitely great brushes without breaking the bank.</li>
    <li> I was really interested on buying the Stigma brushes but was a little hesitant because of the price. I started to look for another brand of brushes that is less pricey and was glad to purchase LAMORA eye brush set and also another set of face brushes. They work great in blending the makeup into the skin and compared with my old brushes ( no name brand ) so I really like the finish look on my face ( flawless, smooth, well blended ). Overall I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase and glad I saved my money.</li>
    <li> I accidentally ordered these brushes thinking they were a different brush set that has similar packaging. The quality is terrific if not better than the brand I thought it was. Soft, no shedding. Took them on vacation,  great, convenient holder. Totally reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to buy these brushes because I wasn&#x27;t sure on the quality, but believe it or not they are great!!! soft on the skin, easy use with blending and I love the travel tube that it comes with! I will definitely buy more of them. Can&#x27;t go wrong with affordable good quality make up brushes.</li>
    <li> I would absolutely recommend these brushes!! You can&#x27;t beat them for the price I am so happy with them.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant at first, because I really wanted to buy the Sigma Kabuki set and needed reliable brushes for my reviews. I&#x27;m so happy I made the decision to buy them!! They are perfect and I couldn&#x27;t be any happier.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re very nice brushes. All it&#x27;s missing is a little fullness but who can complain with this price, right?!</li>
    <li> I love the case and the brushes are very nice, no shedding. Nice full stiff brushes</li>
    <li> returned these tooooo expensive for what you get</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing! Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Great brushes love them!!!! The only bad thing I would have to say is that they shed.</li>
    <li> These brushes are comparable to much more expensive brushes for a fraction of the cost. Buy them up before they go up!</li>
    <li> I really like this set.  The bristles are VERY soft and there are a lot of them!  I wish there were more options from Lamora for a stiff brow brush, a thin angled eye liner brush, a short smudger brush, and a standard angled eye liner brush.  I am very happy with this purchase and I got them for a great deal!</li>
    <li> I love them. Very soft and good quality and you can not beat the price! The only thing I do wish is that they came with a book explainning about the brushes. For example; what they are made from, the names of the brushes, best way to care for them, ect.....</li>
    <li> Love them!! Very easy to blend my makeup!!!👍 And very soft!</li>
    <li> I ordered my Lamora brush set, and received it much quicker than I thought I would, which made me very happy.  However, the reason I give this 5 stars is not only the quality is excellent, but I received follow-up on my order from Lamora along with a &amp;#34;how to use&amp;#34; the brushes booklet.  They went above and beyond just sending out an order.</li>
    <li> Beautiful set. Bristles are soft and the spring back is awesome! Immediately tossed some of my other brushes once I used them. I like how fluffy the brushes are and how they pickup product.</li>
    <li> I love love love the brushes! They are good quality and for a good price?! Can&#x27;t beat this deal</li>
    <li> I thought my makeup looked pretty decent until I started using Lamora brushes, but boy, was I wrong. These brushes are amazing, and have made all the difference. These brushes are so soft, and my makeup looks flawless. I have already recommended these brushes, and I&#x27;ve only been using them as couple weeks! AMAZING brushes! :D</li>
    <li> Excellent brush at an amazing price! It&#x27;s so soft and does a beautiful job with my foundation.</li>
    <li> I love Lamora brushes! I use them everyday and they are so easy to clean. The brushes apply makeup onto your face very nicely!</li>
    <li> The brushes seem very high quality and the customer excellence is superb! They have included several helpful tutorials and have been readily available for any additional questions. I am very happy with my purchase as well as the price! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I loved the set. Great brushes. Would recommend to friends and family. They come in a beautiful case. Customer service was very friendly.</li>
    <li> I bought this set when they were 40% off and what a great deal. If you think you need to spend big $ for brushes Stop here at purchase this set. They are just as good as the other top name brand brushes out there. They came in a nice black leather case which u can also use as two brush holder containers. Love these brushes! Only downfall is they should have the name of what each brush does right on the handles but they did send an email explaining what each brush is used for, so that was good. Give these brushes a try, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I bought this product like a present to my boyfriend, He is studying to be a esthetician and he loves it. I recomend it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy I purchased these brushes! I was kind of apprehensive about buying them without seeing them in person but they are nice and dense with a quality handle. They haven&#x27;t fallen apart like some of these other brushes you see being sold on amazon for around the same price point. I&#x27;m looking forward to buying the eye brushes next!</li>
    <li> Purchased these for my wife she loved them the quality was great and the case they came in she loved .  Take the case open up turn&#x27;s into two pieces turn upside down put brushes into both.</li>
    <li> Good Brush set for the money.</li>
    <li> These brushes are so soft and very great quality the price is amazing.</li>
    <li> These brushes are so soft and have very good qualities. I really really love them.</li>
    <li> Oh my goodness, these brushes! They&#x27;re amazing. Cheap, sturdy, and great quality!! So silky on my face, and blend beautifully! I recommend to everyone!!</li>
    <li> Wonderful brushes &amp; case, exactly what I wanted.  Love the finished look of my makeup.  Very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I’ve been using these daily since I received them, and I’ve been very impressed.  My most used is the flat angled brush, I use it for my cream foundation and it is perfect.  I haven’t used the precision brushes as much as the others, but I do like every single brush in this set.  Definitely a great deal.  Although I haven’t used high end brushes such as Sigma, I would imagine that these are similar and much more reasonably priced.  I’m very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very impressed with these brushes. They have a nice weight in the hand and the bristles are so soft! I was looking at purchasing the Sigma version, but at $150, it was too steep for me. I own hundreds of brushes from MAC, Bare Escentuals, Tarte, Too Faced, etc. While sable-hair brushes are luxurious, they do start to shed and lose their soft texture after a few months. That has been my experience. These synthetic bristles get the job done and withstand the daily washings I give them (I don&#x27;t like to leave product on them for more than a couple of days).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of the 10 brushes in this set, I have used the flat kabuki and ound kabuki face brushes the most. The flat version is perfect for applying BB Creme (I love BE&#x27;s new BB primer!), as well liquid foundation. The rounded version is great for buffing BE mineral foundation and mineral veil, and it works well for blending in my UD NAKED foundation. The angled face brush is ideal for bronzer/countering and the tapered kabuki is great for blending in foundation around the nose and eyes. The smaller brushes are good for spot treatments. Cream shadows, concealers, under-eye brighteners should be applied with these babies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to the brushes, you get an awesome cylinder to store them. Talk about value. You really can&#x27;t go wrong with this set. I highly recommend these to everyone, from beauty novice to professional. If they offer more brush sets for eye make-up (like Sigma), I&#x27;d totally buy them!</li>
    <li> Very nice brushes!!  Pleasantly surprised at the quality of the brushes and how well made they were.  I have used Sigma and MAC brushes in the past and these are just as nice!  You get a lot of brushes in the set for the price.  Would purchase from Lamora Beauty again.</li>
    <li> like the smaller brushes they smell very toxic and the odor does not go away with a week of airing out. I want to return them.</li>
    <li> Love these, super soft and blends foundation and concealer beautifully. I hope they last a long time and hope they come out with more types of brushes.</li>
    <li> I would like to give this product a 4.8 if I could and it is just because of a minor nit picky thing but first off, If you are contemplating getting this brush set just do it because they will not disappoint. I was expecting the face brushes to be a bit bigger because I am more used to brushes that cover more of my face but the eye brushes are standard size. Besides that minor detail, I have tried out every single one of the brushes and they have definitely made a noticeable difference in the way my skin looks compared to using other brushes I own.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this set to anyone who is looking for a high quality brush set who doesn&#x27;t want to spend an outrageous prize just because they are &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Love the brushes. They&#x27;re smooth and applies make-up well. The only thing is there was some shedding. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s because there new.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with my brushes. They appear to be of good quality and do not shed. Out of so many choices, I&#x27;m glad this set is the one I purchased. I also like the case they came in and am pleased with the quality. The case had dual use for me. The brushes are in the bottom part of the case. I have several fat eyeshadow pencils and the stand up nicely in the other part where I can see each one&#x27;s color and select the one I want to use. Thank you Lamora Beauty for having such a good product on Amazon!</li>
    <li> Love the brushes and the container they come in.  I that it keeps all my brushes together ,as I travel a great deal.</li>
    <li> These makeup brushes are amazing!</li>
    <li> For the price I paid I think it&#x27;s a good buy. They are nice and soft.</li>
    <li> Good quality and matches with its price. I think it&#x27;s good for everyday use but I may need more eye brushes to do better.</li>
    <li> Fantastic customer service! Fast response time! Love the brushes and I am very happy. This is a perfect set effects brushes if you use cruelty free and or 100% vegan products. I JUST REALLY LIKE THE BRUSHES AND THE EXPERIENCE I HAD WITH THE COMPANY.</li>
    <li> Wonderful value for the cost.  Wash excellent. No shedding</li>
    <li> They Are simply amazing, and they are very soft.  They work great for blending.</li>
    <li> First, these brushes are INCREDIBLE, especially for the price. The brush end itself is of the same quality as my one Sigma brush, and I get 10 of these for the price of one Sigma brush. You cannot possibly beat that. The only reason I am docking a star is because mine in particular didn&#x27;t come in the mail in the best condition. They were a Christmas gift, so it could have just been the result of rushing shipments. Some of the metal bindings were dented, and then there were a few where the metal portion that holds the bristles was separated from the shaft. The denting is not a big deal in terms of effecting use, but I had to super glue the ones that were separating -- also an easy fix, but not preferable for new brushes. You can see in the photo what I am talking about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that said, even with the few that weren&#x27;t in pristine condition, they are worth every penny because they feel as wonderful and apply makeup just as well as the higher end brushes out there.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love these!!  Very soft on face..great coverage!! Thanks!!</li>
    <li> These are such great face brushes, expressly for apply foundation and concealer! They are amazingly soft and buffs every product on very nicely. I found myself using these brushes everyday, and they have become part of my everyday routine. I would recommend that if you are considering buying brushes like sedona lace or sigma - then try these first! The quality is VERY similar and for the price you can buy 2 of this set! They make great gifts too. I have also done a complete review of these Brushes on my youtube channel, because I love them so much, if you are interested here is the link: youtube.com/ditzystarsz  [...] [[ASIN:B00GW4OVF8 Makeup Brush Set by Lamora - Professional Kabuki Brush Set - Premium Cosmetic Brush Set - Best Professional Make Up Brush Set With Makeup Cup Holder - 10 Piece Collection - Synthetic Brush Set - Makeup Brushes - Cosmetic Brushes - Face Brushes - Eye Bru...]]</li>
    <li> Good quality brushes for the price! I love these brushes they give my foundation a flawless look and they are so soft and perfect. I highly recommend these for all kinds of foundations and concealer.</li>
    <li> Love this set of brushes! I wanted brushes that did not leave the bristles on my face, this set is it. The brushes have stayed intact and are working great.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this brand for brushes. I usually go to Nordstrom and buy Mac brush set but this out beat mac brushes</li>
    <li> So far so good, I just used them for the first time today and I loved them. They didn&#x27;t shed at all when I washed them and they&#x27;re still incredibly soft. I definitely recommend them!</li>
    <li> Good product , satisfied 100%</li>
    <li> Best brush set that I have ever purchased!!!</li>
    <li> I love these brushes....great quality.</li>
    <li> Received this product rapidly. As described. Had a few loose brush strands upon initial opening but after cleaning them up the brushes are sturdy. Soft material make it easy to apply makeup without irritating my already sensitive facial skin. Comes with the zippered pouch in the photo so it&#x27;s easy to keep them away from dust and grime. Love this and would buy again!!</li>
    <li> Great quality brushes, awesome case.  Very happy!</li>
    <li> Beautiful makeup brushes. Quality exceeded my expectations.</li>
    <li> These brushes are so amazing! They are super soft to your skin, probably the softest I&#x27;ve ever used. They make it so easy to apply foundation and give a flawless look to your skin. They are easy to clean also. The travel container they come in are great for traveling and also just to put then in on your vanity! Give them two thumbs up!!!</li>
    <li> I love how soft the bristles are.  The tapered kabuki one is absolutely perfect for any under eye concealing and the other brushes are nice for powders.  I do not like it as much for a thick or heavy foundation, but the buffing brushes are good for runny or light foundations.  I adore every eye brush included because they pick up a perfect amount of eyeshadow and fit the crease and lid nicely.  All in all, I would definitely recommend these brushes to any amateur or makeup artist/guru because they are affordable, high quality, and superbly made.  (I don&#x27;t mind the carrying case because I rarely will bring all 10 brushes.  You can also compare these to Sigma which are 4x more expensive)</li>
    <li> I love the brushes! I did an extended research on make up brushes and these ones are a very good pick! I got them after three days I placed an order. The brushes a very soft and very well made. Good quality for good price. Very easy to use, great for everyday make up!</li>
    <li> I got these brushes about 3 weeks ago and I absolutely love them. I find myself using them everytime I put on my makeup. They are very similar if not better than other high end brushes that I own. If you are on the fence, go ahead and make the purchase, you won&#x27;t regret it. I am happy with my purchase</li>
    <li> The quality of the Lamora brushes is excellent. The case that comes with it is impressive (larger than expected). Lamora brushes are excellent for the makeup novice or professional. The only thing that I wish was different, is that the brush handles had a little more weight to them, this is the reason for 4 stars.</li>
    <li> I received my brushes as promised. I have used them several times and the are good quality brushes. They are gentle on the skin but durable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy I took sometime to read the reviews, I LOVE THESE !! They are so worth it and the case they come in travels so well it is very sturdy. I highly recommended them !!</li>
    <li> Love these brushes! Very good quality and I use them all the time. They wash well and keep their shape. Haven&#x27;t noticed shedding.</li>
    <li> the best wife loves them</li>
    <li> I just received these brushes a week ago and I love them so far! They are really soft and easy to apply on your face. This is the first time I have really invested in a good set and these are absolutely wonderful!</li>
    <li> Great brush set.  I wanted something I could use at home or take on trips.  The case can stand easily and my brushes can be protected all the time.</li>
    <li> Ok Brushes, but hard to clean. Nicely set a round container. New, they are great. To clean....hmmm I dont know.</li>
    <li> They are very good quality, thank you.</li>
    <li> Absolutely perfect....  and I am willing to admit how completely picky I am when it comes to cosmetics, brushes and beauty supplies in general... wonderful!!!!</li>
    <li> I like that they are soft but the set is not very versatile enough because it does not even include a liner brush. And they shed!!!!!!! All the big brushes after first wash shed. Even though they do not shed like crazy but I was still expecting this set to be in higher quality...</li>
    <li> Absolutely love them and the case it comes in.</li>
    <li> Highly HIGHLY recommend this product. The brushes are flawless and come in a cute little case! Seriously you can&#x27;t go wrong with these!</li>
    <li> Great brush set! High quality brushes, no shedding. A must have and a great gift idea!!</li>
    <li> In all fairness, I&#x27;m new to wearing makeup. Being a novice, &amp; not having much to compare, I don&#x27;t feel confident leaving a review. Lamora keeps harassing me to do so, so here it is.</li>
    <li> I just love these brushes! Just as good as my Mac &amp; Sephora brushes but a fraction of the cost! Amaze Amaze Amaze!</li>
    <li> These brushes are magnificent!  I was extremely reluctant to purchase make-up brushes site unseen but went ahead and took the plunge.  BOY!  Am I glad I did!  These brushes are amazing.  The make-up applied with these brushes goes on smooth and flawless.  The tubular case is attractive enough to leave out on your dresser or vanity.  Do yourself a favor and buy these brushes now.  By the way, they also now offer a set of eye shadow brushes as well.  I promise you WILL NOT be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have had this brush set about 2 weeks now and I love these brushes. I bought my sister a set as well because she loved mine so much.  They kind of look like my sigma brushes but way less expensive.  I get the most use out of the five larger kabuki brushes. Overall I think it is a great brush set and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> Amazing set of brushes for every need. Soft and durable. I haven&#x27;t noticed any shedding, and they are also easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift for my daughter who is very picky. She LOVES these brushes. Very high quality, no shedding and came in a perfect storage tube. Would buy these again!</li>
    <li> Gorgeous brush set.  Beautifully packaged.  My daughter was delighted with this set.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and just as described.  These are quality brushes at half the price, highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought your brushes on a recommendation of a friend.   I own over 100 very good (and very expensive)  make up brushes... I got  the chance to use  my  new ones  yesterday and I could not be more pleased  :)  My other brushes will now  gifted to my sisters &amp;#60;3  And,  although I have yet to use it,  your customer service seems  to exceed most any other company for which I have been a customer :)   THANK YOU!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amber &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Naples,  Fl</li>
