      <li>Love, love this oil-free sunscreen, it literally leaves a matte finish on your face, absorbs easily, and lasts all day without oil build-up (great oil control for those with combo/oily skin).</li>

      <li>Its very light.</li>
      <li>I was also able to wear face make up over the sunscreen &amp; my</li>

      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I love that.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty fair already, so I wear it alone as</li>
      <li>It feels very light and stays smooth all day.  </li>
      <li>most importantly it works.  </li>
      <li>So easy to work with.</li>
      <li>It took about a week to get here which is fine by</li>
      <li>Love the mild fragrance.</li>
      <li>Light weight liquid for a comfortable ware.</li>
      <li>Goes on smooth, doesn&#x27;t leave cakey residue, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, protects from sun exposure.</li>

      <li>This goes on so evenly, don&#x27;t be put off by the liquidy texture, it goes on smoothly and wears well with my moisturizer and makeup.</li>
      <li>This product comes out light and smooth.</li>
      <li>It is light and you don&#x27;t even know you&#x27;re wearing it.</li>
      <li>He feels that it goes on smooth, a bit watery, but to oily at all.</li>
      <li>This facial sunscreen is great - goes on matte</li>
      <li>I am outside A LOT (walking the hills of SF w/no car) every day and need a great sunscreen.</li>
      <li>Make me feel so comfortable when using it.</li>
      <li>but I feel it was totally worth it!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had this sunscreen before and originally bought it off Macy&#x27;s but after shipping this was $35 (maybe 40?).</li>
      <li>wouldn&#x27;t exactly call this a moisturizer, more like an oil-controlling sunscreen.  </li>
      <li>What&#x27;s even better is that it feels so light and absorbs into the skin really well.  </li>
      <li>I was able to for-go wearing face lotion as this product was very moisturizing.</li>
      <li>This is the real deal at a better price than I got anywhere else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Over time it doesnt get super greasy like others Ive tried (Neutrogena, Olay, etc) and does well at over time lightening my acne scars.</li>
      <li>Worth every cent.</li>
      <li>all are right and</li>
      <li>I also received the product very fast.</li>
      <li>but the price will be higher).  </li>
      <li>It really works!  </li>
      <li>My skin feels smooth and soft and makeup goes on like a dream.  </li>
      <li>One side of my face to be exact.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m sticking with this sunscreen for awhile, you barely feel it on your face and it&#x27;s so easy to apply it in the morning.</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t necessarily have a skin tone prone to burning fairly easy (NC40 in MAC, think Alicia Keys with no makeup</li>
      <li>(Yes my make up also has sunscreen but not enough for the strong FL sun).  </li>
      <li>On a positive note, it is definitely non-greasy and smooth under makeup.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend, worth the rather high price.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think it moisturizes very well at all.  </li>
      <li>Fast shipping process.</li>
      <li>My husband likes it, and that&#x27;s a winner in my book because he is very picky.</li>
      <li>I have oily-combination skin and often get a very oily t-zone.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Dries out my skin too much</li>
      <li>But I am really looking for a sunscreen with anti-aging properties</li>
      <li>and I didn&#x27;t feel I saw much of that with this product.</li>
      <li>It really protect my skin from sunburned.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery.</li>
      <li>It goes on very light &amp; does not leave the greasy feeling other sunscreens do.</li>
      <li>Super expensive for the volume you get but truly a remarkable product.</li>
      <li>This doesn&#x27;t leave my skin tacky and greasy like most other sunscreens.  </li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t as allergic to it as with many of the other Shiseido products.</li>
      <li>so it isn&#x27;t greasy (as so many other sunscreens are).</li>
      <li>It smells nice, goes on smoothly, &amp; disappear quickly, but after wearing it for a few hours, I can feel the icky, sticky, greasy film on my face.  </li>
      <li>Love the little bottle.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going back to Neutrogena dry touch, which is lighter &amp; works better for oilier skins.  </li>
      <li>It dries quickly and can wear all day long.  </li>
      <li>I received this product on time &amp; in brand new in-the-box condition.</li>
      <li>This is the ONLY face sun screen I&#x27;ve found that goes on light enough that I can put my make-up on</li>
      <li>In her day sunscreen wasnt seen as important within the black community.</li>
      <li>Before this, I have been using Clinique City Block Sheer Oil-Free Daily Face Protector SPF 25 for the last 5 years, and towards mid-day or the end, my face feels oily and the tint would rub off easily.</li>
      <li>Initially if you use a bit too much it can have a bit of a white cast due to the zinc oxide in it, but that quickly fades and wears very well under makeup.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This sunscreen is so much better, and is at least water resistant for 40 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Being light and African American wearing sunscreen is just my personal necessity.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin meaning everything makes me break out</li>
      <li>(I have combination mature skin).  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had a few blemishes since starting to use this product, although I can&#x27;t say for sure if this was the cause.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I absolutely love this sunscreen!  I have acne prone skin, and this doesn&#x27;t make me break out at all.  What&#x27;s even better is that it feels so light and absorbs into the skin really well.  It sort of feels like a primer and my makeup goes on smooth over it.  This doesn&#x27;t leave my skin tacky and greasy like most other sunscreens.  My skin feels smooth and soft and makeup goes on like a dream.  Also, I know this works, because I wore this on my face and neck, and a different sunscreen on my upper body, and I got a slight burn everywhere except where I put on the Shiseido.  I played tennis for 2 hours and sweat like crazy, and still the Shiseido sunscreen protected my face!  I love this and even though it is expensive, will continue to repurchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really confused with all the positive reviews for this product. I bought this sunscreen from Sephora. It is the best feeling sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used. It is light and you don&#x27;t even know you&#x27;re wearing it. Here&#x27;s the downfall, my face got sunburned while I was wearing it. One side of my face to be exact. I was sitting at a middle school football game on a Saturday afternoon and the left side of my face that was in the sun got burned. It was great walking around with one side of your face red.</li>
    <li> This is the real deal at a better price than I got anywhere else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I run out I will keep Amazon in mind.</li>
    <li> Light weight liquid for a comfortable ware. It isn&#x27;t sticky at all!! I apply it after moisturizing my face and neck, before applying make up on.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this sunscreen before and originally bought it off Macy&#x27;s but after shipping this was $35 (maybe 40?). So to save some money I bought it from this seller. I just got it today. It took about a week to get here which is fine by me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About me&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t necessarily have a skin tone prone to burning fairly easy (NC40 in MAC, think Alicia Keys with no makeup that&#x27;s me) but I&#x27;ve always been in the habit of wearing sunscreen especially since it was something my grandmother struggled with in her later years. In her day sunscreen wasnt seen as important within the black community. Being light and African American wearing sunscreen is just my personal necessity. I&#x27;m also oily and acne prone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product&lt;br /&gt;This is the best sunscreen Ive tried. Over time it doesnt get super greasy like others Ive tried (Neutrogena, Olay, etc) and does well at over time lightening my acne scars. This does leave a slight white cast but nothing a little powder or bronzer couldn&#x27;t fix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller&lt;br /&gt;Nice person. Sent me an e-mail when the product was dropped off. The product isnt fake or anything. Ive had this before from Macys and nothing out the ordinary when I opened package. I plan to buy from this seller again. THANK YOU SELLER FOR SAVING ME $$$  :o)</li>
    <li> It really protect my skin from sunburned.</li>
    <li> too pastey.  Dries out my skin too much</li>
    <li> I bought this moisturizer because I was desperate and found it relatively inexpensively at TJ Maxx.  I have oily-combination skin and often get a very oily t-zone.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t exactly call this a moisturizer, more like an oil-controlling sunscreen.  I don&#x27;t think it moisturizes very well at all.  I would definitely only use this in the summer and not during the dry winter months.&lt;br /&gt;That being said it has a beautiful finish on the skin, very velvety.  Initially if you use a bit too much it can have a bit of a white cast due to the zinc oxide in it, but that quickly fades and wears very well under makeup.&lt;br /&gt;There is a noticeable alcohol smell that is hidden partially by fragrance.  It is a very thin formula that needs to be shaken before application.  Because of the alcohol, if there are any dry patches on  your skin it will make them stand out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I might purchase it again just to use as a facial sunscreen, but I am hesitant because of the high alcohol content.</li>
    <li> Product and service as expected</li>
    <li> It feels so good when applied. Does not feel like the other oily sun-cream at all. Make me feel so comfortable when using it.</li>
    <li> I wear this product all spring and summer long.  It really works!  I&#x27;ve used the product since it came out.  I swim and perspire and it stays on my face.  I wear it under my make up and it helps make up stay on.</li>
    <li> Love the little bottle. It goes with me everywhere</li>
    <li> Texture, lightness, scent all are right and most importantly it works.  This is the only one I use for my skin protection for face and neck.  Hope this could be little less expensive .</li>
    <li> I had a sample of this. GWP. I wasn&#x27;t as allergic to it as with many of the other Shiseido products. Always a plus. But I am really looking for a sunscreen with anti-aging properties and I didn&#x27;t feel I saw much of that with this product. So, I will keep looking.  If you are not looking for that, then it may be good for you.</li>
    <li> it leaves a shiny finish but effective</li>
    <li> I had the same sun block before I order this one and somehow it wasn&#x27;t the same. I doesn&#x27;t feel like or looked like the one I got.</li>
    <li> nice , it&#x27;s a gift and she like it</li>
    <li> It smells nice, goes on smoothly, &amp; disappear quickly, but after wearing it for a few hours, I can feel the icky, sticky, greasy film on my face.  It also leaves a whitish cast on my face.  This rich thick lotion is definitely not for people with oily skin.  I&#x27;m going back to Neutrogena dry touch, which is lighter &amp; works better for oilier skins.  Shiseido makes amazing skin are products, but this sunscreen is not a winner.</li>
    <li> Super expensive for the volume you get but truly a remarkable product. Goes on smooth, doesn&#x27;t leave cakey residue, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, protects from sun exposure. I only use this for my face and haven&#x27;t had any issues with breakouts or discomfort.</li>
    <li> Great sunscreen and moisurizer</li>
    <li> When I wear it, I can&#x27;t feel it on my skin. I love that. I have sensitive skin meaning everything makes me break out but this is the only SPF lotion that does not clog my pores. Worth every cent.</li>
    <li> It is non greasy. It gives my face a finished matte look, yet it is not powdery. It doesn&#x27;t leave any white residue like some of the others.</li>
    <li> My husband likes it, and that&#x27;s a winner in my book because he is very picky. He feels that it goes on smooth, a bit watery, but to oily at all.</li>
    <li> Outstanding product! I do not use sunscreen on my fac as everything I have tried in the past made my sensitive skin break out. Not with this product! It goes on very light &amp; does not leave the greasy feeling other sunscreens do. I was able to for-go wearing face lotion as this product was very moisturizing. I was also able to wear face make up over the sunscreen &amp; my make up did not run as it has with other products. There is a bead/small ball in the bottle to ensure the product is mixed well when you shake the bottle (like the bb you find in some nail polishes, only larger). This is a very small bottle however, you truly don&#x27;t need much as a little goes a long way. The formula is somewhat thin which I think adds to the moisture content instead of greasy feel some sunscreens have. I received this product on time &amp; in brand new in-the-box condition. I would use this seller again.</li>
    <li> This is truly like a primer/sunscreen.  My skin has never looked so good (I have combination mature skin).  It even feels great going on and coming off.  So easy to work with.</li>
    <li> I am 37 and have never used a sunscreen product on my face that didn&#x27;t bother me or irritate my skin.  This product is amazing!  It dries quickly and can wear all day long.  It didn&#x27;t bother my problematic skin, and I couldn&#x27;t even feel it was on.  I was a little skeptical about trying it because of the price (I&#x27;ve spend so much in other products already) but I feel it was totally worth it!  I will never use any other sunscreen on my face, thank goodness I found this product!</li>
    <li> I had heard rave reviews about this product. It&#x27;s very thin, and does not blend well... I have to use quite a bit of it to cover my face. On a positive note, it is definitely non-greasy and smooth under makeup. I&#x27;ve had a few blemishes since starting to use this product, although I can&#x27;t say for sure if this was the cause. I&#x27;ll finish using the bottle, but will likely not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Love, love this oil-free sunscreen, it literally leaves a matte finish on your face, absorbs easily, and lasts all day without oil build-up (great oil control for those with combo/oily skin). Before this, I have been using Clinique City Block Sheer Oil-Free Daily Face Protector SPF 25 for the last 5 years, and towards mid-day or the end, my face feels oily and the tint would rub off easily. This sunscreen is so much better, and is at least water resistant for 40 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The liquid is runny and when you apply it on your face, it does leave a very faint white cast, however, it&#x27;s hardly noticeable at all if you wear make-up over it. I&#x27;m pretty fair already, so I wear it alone as is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sticking with this sunscreen for awhile, you barely feel it on your face and it&#x27;s so easy to apply it in the morning.</li>
    <li> I am outside A LOT (walking the hills of SF w/no car) every day and need a great sunscreen. This goes on so evenly, don&#x27;t be put off by the liquidy texture, it goes on smoothly and wears well with my moisturizer and makeup. I&#x27;m 41 and need good protection, and I&#x27;ve found it in this product! Highly recommend, worth the rather high price.</li>
    <li> I have acne prone, t zone oily , sensitive skin, I often wear this alone, it is so sheer, or as a primer, it does not clog my pores, nor does it feel like i have a load of product on my face. I also received the product very fast.</li>
    <li> The packaging was open upon receiving this product and there was no plastic to provide that the product was not already used. For spending $30 on a product I am very unhappy. The product works, but this is just not the place to buy it.</li>
    <li> Excellent. Fast delivery.</li>
    <li> The bottle is very small. Not sure how long it will last. Pretty high price for such a small amount and seems a bit watery.  I have used Shiseido before and was very pleased. The jury is still out on this one.</li>
    <li> This facial sunscreen is great - goes on matte so it isn&#x27;t greasy (as so many other sunscreens are). And I love that it is SPF 40+, great for my skin!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent sunscreen to wear underneath makeup/foundation.  It goes on, and sinks into the skin and is virtually invisible. You don&#x27;t feel or look like you&#x27;re wearing sunscreen and it doesn&#x27;t ball up or flake off as you apply makeup over it.&lt;br /&gt;Only reason I gave it 4 (instead of 5) stars is that it contains chemical sunscreens (octinoxate 7.4% and octocrylene 3.0%) AND physical blocks (zinc oxide 8.6%).  I prefer physical/mineral only blocks and for this reason will not buy this again.&lt;br /&gt;But if you don&#x27;t care about using chemical sunscreens, then this could be an excellent product for you!</li>
    <li> This is the best sunscreen I have used.  It feels very light and stays smooth all day.  This is not your typical sunscreen where they tend to feel heavy and make my skin oily.  Love this product.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I live in south west Florida where it is hot, sunny and humid year round. This is the ONLY face sun screen I&#x27;ve found that goes on light enough that I can put my make-up on like it&#x27;s not even there. (Yes my make up also has sunscreen but not enough for the strong FL sun).  This product comes out light and smooth. It soaks into my skin with no residue and no oily feeling.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not really sure what went wrong but this broke me out pretty badly and irritated my skin. I was pretty disappointed since it&#x27;s so pricey. I gave it away to a friend.</li>
    <li> Perfect and non-oily. Love the mild fragrance.</li>
    <li> Im a sunscreen junkie and have tried most all of them. This one wins for best consistency, best ingredients and most accessible (easily available in most dept stores as well but the price will be higher).  I use it over my treatment serums and apply foundation over it (Guinot Youth Time) and it looks perfect and protects me while Im out and about walking and driving. Its a lightweight matte finish and can be reapplied throughout the day over makeup without looking greasy or smearing. The tiny bottle is TSA friendly and fits in any bag, even my little Marc Jacobs Natasha mini bag. No offensive fragrance and does not sting. Japanese have the idea with their sunscreens - pass on the Korean ones that make me have zits.</li>
    <li> Great product! Its very light. Good to use before foundation to protect your skin from the ultraviolet. Fast shipping process. Love it!</li>
