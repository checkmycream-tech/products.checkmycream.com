### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The best I have seen is a tint to my white/grey hair.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Edited in August to let you know that this product worked wonderfully for me,  </li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s a very good product  </li>
      <li>As yet she has not indicated that the solution is very good or not....</li>
      <li>Now I&#x27;m extremely happy.</li>
      <li>The gray ban does a great job on my stubborn gray and the creme keeps the brunette</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s so close that it blends in with the rest of my hair great.</li>
      <li>I have nearly-black hair with about 25% bright silver hair coming in.  </li>
      <li>well..smells good and there is no side effects..highly recommended</li>
      <li>The good news is that it does work.  </li>
      <li>Good product.  </li>
      <li>Good price.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff!</li>
      <li>Much to my pleasant surprise this product works even better than they claim.</li>
      <li>It is very easy to use, and does not irritate his skin, which is very important.</li>
      <li>It goes on with a pleasant smell but gradually builds into a powerful sulfur smell.</li>
      <li>GrayBan is effective and easy to use.</li>
      <li>Very easy to use and gives a beautiful natural color.</li>
      <li>It has been for many years and remains gray.  </li>
      <li>gonna keep changing it until it doesn&#x27;t work any more.</li>
      <li>What I did notice was that my hair became drier and drier, and more and more brittle.  </li>
      <li>It makes me feel better about myself.</li>
      <li>Nevertheless she did say that it is much better than others.</li>
      <li>The smell is so overwhelming that I had to give it up.</li>
      <li>use it to keep from getting more gray than I already am, not to</li>
      <li>This is more a question than a review.</li>
      <li>I am more dispapointed by the smell than i am about the effectiveness, because nothing is 100% foe everyone.  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff and hope they never stop making it.</li>
      <li>Everything I ordered turned out to be as expected, very happy.</li>
      <li>The other excellent quality is that it does not wash out.</li>
      <li>He says he easily sprays where the gray is.  </li>
      <li>I can highly recommend this and hope you get as good results as I have.</li>
      <li>I also like the body it adds to my fine</li>
      <li>--I spray it on my fine comb and use the comb to&lt;br /&gt;apply</li>
      <li>works fast has nice smell</li>
      <li>but u have to remain steadfast in using every day.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how anyone lasts a full 4 weeks with this stuff.</li>
      <li>I use this regularly and it is a good product because it delays the coloring process of my hair.  </li>
      <li>If you only have spots of gray, or want to cover roots, it&#x27;s a good choice.</li>
      <li>Altough the result is not as good as the producers claim its enough for me to stop the proccess of darkening of the rest of my hair and to darken to some extension the gray hair I had.</li>
      <li>But for somebody with a head full of gray hair, this turns your hair purple.</li>
      <li>at best, maybe a  slight change in color of gray, but its not a game changer.</li>
      <li>By the second week I&#x27;m only using it 2-3 times a week and am very happy with the results.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The smell is mild to me, and not unpleasant.  </li>
      <li>I noticed favorable results from the very first application.  </li>
      <li>This product seemed like a great idea and would probably work for people with a little gray.</li>
      <li>Aaand, it dissipates fast enough &amp; your hair smells good</li>
      <li>I can tell where it is sprayed on, as those areas are really soft and healthy feeling.</li>
      <li>you have to be fairly religious about applying it, plus the smell is off-putting, kind of like a sulfur smell.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve read some of the negative reviews and am baffled as to why GrayBan doesn&#x27;t work for everyone, ( hair texture, DNA maybe??? ), because no words can express how delighted I am with this product!</li>
      <li>, I dont think really that no one of both products will recover my hair to its original color albeit</li>
      <li>right</li>
      <li>and that is all that counts, right guys.</li>
      <li>I tried using the product and it started to work banishing gray right away.</li>
      <li>All I see is the smell difference which to me, was far better the first time.</li>
      <li>I have noted a very noticeable darkening of my hair specially on the forefront.</li>
      <li>Surely by morning, it&#x27;s gone &amp; all that&#x27;s left is the mild throes on your scarf.</li>
      <li>and I am no longer doomed to looking 10 years older than I am!!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how this works, but it is fabulous and even better after I paired it with the (very expensive but very effective) gray ban</li>
      <li>, I can&#x27;t imagine that this product could be healthy to use regularly or even once.</li>
      <li>An even better solution is to only apply it at night &amp; tie the hair up so that u don&#x27;t have to be awake &amp; complain about it.</li>
      <li>I tried a similar product in Germany-Grayban is so much better.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s been 3 months now, and my hair is still incredibly brittle and thin.  </li>
      <li>First you get a headache for about 3 hours after applying, thats probably because the chemicals are poison (of course that&#x27;s not disclosed in the adds).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>After the first week it just takes an&lt;br /&gt;occasional application to the areas I want to change.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Any who, I most definitely recommend this product.</li>
      <li>My husband has been using this stuff since the first time he tried it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll update this review after a few weeks to help you to see what the longer term results are, (good or bad!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Hopefully I will begin seeing some positive results.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure what is in this product, but it can&#x27;t be good if it did that to my skin.</li>
      <li>Not to forget to mention that after it dies down, it mixes well with your own chemistry or even a signature scent u may wear.</li>
      <li>so I stopped coloring last winter and found I was a full 95% silver!</li>
      <li>For now what I can say is that the lotion has been making my hair much healthier.</li>
      <li>This stuff really does work well.</li>
      <li>In fact, when I noticed this, I sprayed it on some hair that had been over-processed during a bleaching for color streaks and the hair seems much healthier.</li>
      <li>It worked best for me on days when I decided to not shampoo, but that drove me crazy (again, the smell).</li>
      <li>Very unsatisfied customer.</li>
      <li>But as for my hair, not so much.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t see any real change</li>
      <li>The product acts fast and smells acceptable.</li>
      <li>Anotherwords, your hair only stays lightly colored(not even fully) till you wash your hair.</li>
      <li>Some ppl really need to let things alone &amp; be grateful</li>
      <li>it is now a silvery light ash blonde</li>
      <li>I really regret trying this.  </li>
      <li>Who wants purple hair?  </li>
      <li>I have been using this product for about a year and it seems to keep my hair reasonably brown and does not look like it is dyed.</li>
      <li>After about 10 days of use I was about to give up because I didn&#x27;t see much improvement.</li>
      <li>Apparently the bottle leaked during shipment and wasn&#x27;t quite full when I opened the package.</li>
      <li>It can get a tad messy (any overspray will turn anything brown), so just be tidy when you use it and wipe off any overspray immediately.</li>
      <li>in fact i was able to see the difference the first few days i started using it</li>
      <li>My greys are now light brown and look like highlights in my long medium-dark brown hair - just what I wanted.</li>
      <li>but I couldn&#x27;t last for the recommended 4 weeks for the full effect.</li>
      <li>a vibrant color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The spray is a little sticky when it dries, and make sure to not get any on your fingernails (wear gloves when you spray and comb it in) because they will begin to darken slightly.&lt;br</li>
      <li>After less than 7 days most of my gray hair is now a very natural looking shade of brown and no one even noticed a change.</li>
      <li>unexpected and very welcomed benefit of GrayBan is the improved condition of my hair.</li>
      <li>To me, it seems like it colors your scalp more than the actual grey hairs.</li>
      <li>I have 80% grey on the sides, 50% on the top and back.</li>
      <li>This product does nothing more than give a yellow cast to the grey hair.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> After about 10 days of use I was about to give up because I didn&#x27;t see much improvement. At that I doubled up using it twice a day. The results rapidly took a turn and after three weeks nearly all grey was gone. Now I&#x27;m extremely happy.</li>
    <li> This was a horrible mistake in purchasing  if I could get my money back I would, however I threw the s*** in the trash</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a year and it seems to keep my hair reasonably brown and does not look like it is dyed. Not sure how it would work for black hair.</li>
    <li> All this product does is slowly \\&quot;\\&quot;paint\\&quot;\\&quot; your hair, but it washes right out when you wash your hair. Anotherwords, your hair only stays lightly colored(not even fully) till you wash your hair. To me, it seems like it colors your scalp more than the actual grey hairs.A waste of money. A complete rip off.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of weeks now and i can already see the difference  in fact i was able to see the difference the first few days i started using it, a majority of the grey is gone, i still have a little grey  near the edge of my hair line but i guess i just have to keep working on it, still this product does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
    <li> I am using Youthair in the morning and Greyban in the evening, I dont think really that no one of both products will recover my hair to its original color albeit I have noted a very noticeable darkening of my hair specially on the forefront. Altough the result is not as good as the producers claim its enough for me to stop the proccess of darkening of the rest of my hair and to darken to some extension the gray hair I had. I think the best moment to use this product is when gray hair is just beginning to grow because once it has turned grey is very difficult to restore.</li>
    <li> GrayBan is a terrific product.  My husband uses it and it makes his grey hair looks like his natural brown.  He says he easily sprays where the gray is.  The other excellent quality is that it does not wash out.</li>
    <li> This is more a question than a review. A few years ago I bought this product from a catalogue but when I saw that one of the ingredients was lead, I sent it back. I believe that the use of this type of product over the long term may be unhealthy. Does anyone know for certain the effects of long term use?[[ASIN:B000B91MYS Verseo Greyban Anti Grey Solution]]</li>
    <li> works fast has nice smell</li>
    <li> As previous rating, this is passed onto my wife. As yet she has not indicated that the solution is very good or not....She indicates that she needs some time to see how it works. Nevertheless she did say that it is much better than others.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical when I bought this but thought I would give it a try anyway. Much to my pleasant surprise this product works even better than they claim. After less than 7 days most of my gray hair is now a very natural looking shade of brown and no one even noticed a change. Not even my wife. I spray it on before I go to bed and that&#x27;s it. By the second week I&#x27;m only using it 2-3 times a week and am very happy with the results. I would recommend this product!</li>
    <li> The product acts fast and smells acceptable. It doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as other  similar products. The only thing I was upset about was the box the product came in was wet when it arrived. Apparently the bottle leaked during shipment and wasn&#x27;t quite full when I opened the package. All else went well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products before.  YouthHair being one of them.  The other products either didn&#x27;t work, or they turned my gray hair green.  Nasty.  Well, I tried Grayban and in two days I could see the difference.  In 4 days (today) my hair has gone from 85% gray to 40% gray.  Looks completely natural.  I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
    <li> I have only been using it a few days, so I will come back later with a more in depth review. For now what I can say is that the lotion has been making my hair much healthier. I can tell where it is sprayed on, as those areas are really soft and healthy feeling. In fact, when I noticed this, I sprayed it on some hair that had been over-processed during a bleaching for color streaks and the hair seems much healthier. The gray is looking slightly less noticeable, but I think I would use it just for the way it makes my hair feel.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for 3 weeks and have not noticed any change at all. The instruction says use for 2-3 weeks daily and then switch to 2 times a week. I am not sure if I should stop using it now or just keep doing it daily till some miracle happens.</li>
    <li> I really regret trying this.  I used it faithfully every day for 30 days, and I didn&#x27;t see any change in my hair color at all.  I have nearly-black hair with about 25% bright silver hair coming in.  What I did notice was that my hair became drier and drier, and more and more brittle.  So I stopped using it.  It&#x27;s been 3 months now, and my hair is still incredibly brittle and thin.  My shower drain clogs every day with all the hair I&#x27;m losing.  It&#x27;s probably going to take at least a year for it all to grow back out.</li>
    <li> works like it always does.  still has a little smell</li>
    <li> I like this cause it is gradual and fits in with dash-and-go and it is a spray so you don&#x27;t have to do a whole big deal to do a treatment; I like a quick spray before bed with time to dry out first.</li>
    <li> I purchased this hoping it would replace my current hair-coloring regimen.  The good news is that it does work.  I noticed favorable results from the very first application.  The bad news is that about 12 hours later, I also noticed an unpleasant odor emanating from my hair. It continued to get stronger throughout the evening.  Washing has helped, but has not as yet removed the odor completely.  Needless to say, I will not be using any more of the product.  What a shame....</li>
    <li> I purchased the product 3 months ago. Label with improved product packaging and results in 3 days. I used the product for 3 months and did not see even one white hair changed color. I turned to the company and they even did not respond as expected. Do not buy this just a fraud and waste of your money.</li>
    <li> I have used this product CONSISTENLY for the past 4-5 months.  If you follow the directions and use it as instructed it WILL work.  The secret is to NOT give up and if you have to use it daily for 6 weeks as I did, due to thick hair, then you should.  Now it is only twice a week.  I had dark brown/gray hair when I started.  It is now TOTALLY dark brown.  It even darkened the hard to color hair at my temples.  People, who I have not seen for a few months, are amazed when I tell them that I do not dye my hair.  If you don&#x27;t like it&#x27;s low keyed fragrance you can always buy African Pride hair deodorizer which comes in a variety of scents.  I prefer the cucumber melon.  It masks the scent of the Greyban as well as cigarette odor if you smoke (I don&#x27;t).  All you need to do with the Greyban is GIVE IT TIME AND USE IT REGULARLY.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t work for me- i do have primarily white and grey hair- it darkened a few areas that still were &#x27;sale and pepper&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This sprays on your dry hair. Unless you shampoo every morning before going to work, I suggest you use it on Friday nite, Saturday &amp; Sundays. I love this stuff! It worked for me and did it in a week. I have 80% grey on the sides, 50% on the top and back. On my hair, medium brown, it looks so natural that no one in my family even noticed! It didn&#x27;t make my grey hair as dark as the natural color but it&#x27;s so close that it blends in with the rest of my hair great. I can highly recommend this and hope you get as good results as I have. This happens to be my second bottle.</li>
    <li> wife uses it in between hair colors and she likes it and that is all that counts, right guys. Never argue with a woman.</li>
    <li> ...at returning my white towels to their natural color, which, I assume, must have been black/dark gray. It also colors my white countertop blackish. But as for my hair, not so much. I&#x27;ve heard mention that this stuff penetrates the hair and combines with your natural blah, blah, blah to restore your natural hair color. This cannot possibly be true, or I would not have black towels every time I wash and towel dry my hair. This may darken your hair (and anything else you spray it on) from the outside, just like spray paint would, but my hair is not changing color. The smell is unpleasant and the texture of my hair is even worse. This is a big disappointment.</li>
    <li> I bought this with very low expectations. I&#x27;ve had premature gray since I was in my 20s, and I hate coloring it and damaging it every 6 weeks with semi permanent color---so I jumped at the chance to try this stuff, thinking that even if the very worst happened and it made my hair fall out or turn green, it would be worth it just to see if it actually did work.&lt;br /&gt;Well, I applied it exactly as the directions stated, and in 2 days there was a definite darkening of the silver grays. By the next day, my hair looked the way it looks 2 weeks after I color it, and today (day 4) I washed it (I have natural african american hair, so it gets washed twice a week or so) and I was preparing myself to see the color wash right off----but it didn&#x27;t! In fact it got deeper and that day&#x27;s application continued to restore my natural color. The gray hair at my temples and front hairline (my most annoying areas of gray) are almost completely gone, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I can&#x27;t wait to see the results after a few weeks. The spray is a little sticky when it dries, and make sure to not get any on your fingernails (wear gloves when you spray and comb it in) because they will begin to darken slightly.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update this review after a few weeks to help you to see what the longer term results are, (good or bad!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edited in August to let you know that this product worked wonderfully for me,  the key in stubborn areas was to apply the spray and comb through with a rat tail comb daily until the color was right. I don&#x27;t know how this works, but it is fabulous and even better after I paired it with the (very expensive but very effective) gray ban shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;I was VERY skeptical when I purchased this last winter, but I hope they stay in business forever because their products really are a way for me to avoid the awful hair dyes that I&#x27;ve hated.</li>
    <li> Well it worked but then I got paranoid about putting these chemicals on my head and by my face so back to the natural dye.</li>
    <li> I got fed up with the hassle and damage caused by coloring my hair so I stopped coloring last winter and found I was a full 95% silver! After several remarks over the last year from friends and family about how much older I looked I did some research on hair color restorers and decided on GrayBan.&lt;br /&gt;I had serious doubts because none of the reviews I read were from people like me who are nearly 100% gray - I am amazed at the results!&lt;br /&gt;My natural hair color is dark ash blonde, after using GrayBan for about a week it is now a silvery light ash blonde and I have no doubt that after another week it will be the natural color I&#x27;ve been hoping for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An unexpected and very welcomed benefit of GrayBan is the improved condition of my hair. I was born with relatively thick, wavy hair but being post menopausal and living at a very dry 7000 feet above sea level, my hair had become thinner, dry, frizzy and unmanageable. Since I started using GrayBan my hair feels and looks thicker and has renewed shine and body!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read some of the negative reviews and am baffled as to why GrayBan doesn&#x27;t work for everyone, ( hair texture, DNA maybe??? ), because no words can express how delighted I am with this product! Now my hair looks and feels healthier and I am no longer doomed to looking 10 years older than I am!!</li>
    <li> My wife says to get it for her and I do.  Her hair is gray.  It has been for many years and remains gray.  She uses it faithfully.  Not a clue why she does.</li>
    <li> I use this regularly and it is a good product because it delays the coloring process of my hair.  It works immediately to cover the out growth of grey.</li>
    <li> This product does nothing more than give a yellow cast to the grey hair. It also will stain clothing and linens.</li>
    <li> I am an African American. Before purchasing  this product I  contacted the company and asked would it work in the same fashion for your &#x27;typical&#x27;  African American hair texture.  (i.e., \\&quot;kinky)  and they said yes.    I have used for OVER a month now and have NO significant change in hair color and the smell is God-awful!!!  My girlfriend complained that she has a hard time with the smell also, so I know its not psychological.    I am more dispapointed by the smell than i am about the effectiveness, because nothing is 100% foe everyone.  the smell though is mentioned specifically in their ad as being odorless.    Very unsatisfied customer.</li>
    <li> Having a chemical engineering backgound, I am guessing this works by the Bismuth Citrate reacting slowly with Sulfur to produce a dark Bismuth Sulfide which colors the hair.  This is much less toxic than Lead which is used in the less expensive product, Youthair, which probably combines Lead Acetate with Sulfur to produce a dark Lead Sulfide.  Youthair really sounds dangerous as Lead Acetate is a soluble substance that can be absorbed through the skin. If you use Greyban, you should research the biological effect of Bismuth in case you start getting some symptoms.</li>
    <li> Everything I ordered turned out to be as expected, very happy.</li>
    <li> My husband has been using this stuff since the first time he tried it. Although it does not help him to get rid of the gray hair as advertised, just covers it, he still loves it and buys it on the regular basis now. It is very easy to use, and does not irritate his skin, which is very important.</li>
    <li> This stuff really does work well. You must stay vigilant &amp; diligent in applying in order to see results. I&#x27;m not sure if it works on full head of &amp;#34;wisdom&amp;#34; color but it does on one starting to get &amp;#34;wise&amp;#34;. It doesn&#x27;t wash away as far as I can see but u have to remain steadfast in using every day. Maybe even twice a day. U spray it on the &amp;#34;wiseness&amp;#34; carefully as it is liquid &amp; will run but use your fingertip/s to kinda massage or rub slightly into avoid wasting product &amp; provide sure contact. It takes a week or so to start to notice difference but it does work! And it&#x27;s not a dye. Nor is it heavy or thick. The formulation has changed &amp; has promised to work faster shielding quicker results. I&#x27;m not sure because the old formula worked for me. All I see is the smell difference which to me, was far better the first time. So many ppl complained ( mostly piggybacking off other reviewers they read) about the smell which was that of a man&#x27;s cologne or aftershave. Definitely not offensive in any way. Aaand, it dissipates fast enough &amp; your hair smells good but u know how it is with trying to please some. Not to forget to mention that after it dies down, it mixes well with your own chemistry or even a signature scent u may wear. An even better solution is to only apply it at night &amp; tie the hair up so that u don&#x27;t have to be awake &amp; complain about it. Surely by morning, it&#x27;s gone &amp; all that&#x27;s left is the mild throes on your scarf. Some ppl really need to let things alone &amp; be grateful the thing u sleek works.they&#x27;re gonna keep changing it until it doesn&#x27;t work any more. If it doesn&#x27;t work for u, I don&#x27;t know what to say other than each person is different maybe? However, I think &amp;#34;Verseo&amp;#34; the company offers a guarantee of sorts. Check &#x27;me out &amp; ask &#x27;em. Any who, I most definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Been using this product as directed for several weeks. Can&#x27;t see any effects whatsoever..</li>
    <li> Its been only 2 weeks i have using it and my grey is almost invisible.it works well..smells good and there is no side effects..highly recommended</li>
    <li> I used this product for about 10 days. I didn&#x27;t see any real change but I couldn&#x27;t last for the recommended 4 weeks for the full effect. It Stinks to much!! The smell is so overwhelming that I had to give it up. It goes on with a pleasant smell but gradually builds into a powerful sulfur smell. It follows you around all day. My bathroom smells like sulfur this morning just from washing it out of my hair. I don&#x27;t know how anyone lasts a full 4 weeks with this stuff. If you use it at night be prepared to throw away your pillow. I was wondering why I had never heard of this product before and now I know why.</li>
    <li> After ignoring the advise of others, I bought it anyway.  I can&#x27;t speak for others, but it did not work for me!</li>
    <li> My husband used the product for a week. at best, maybe a  slight change in color of gray, but its not a game changer.</li>
    <li> I like this stuff.  I got it to help blend in my gray as I let it grow out, so I wouldn&#x27;t have that awful demarcation of where the gray hair starts and the old dark hair is still dyed.  It can get a tad messy (any overspray will turn anything brown), so just be tidy when you use it and wipe off any overspray immediately.</li>
    <li> using it along with the shampoo and haven&#x27;t seen any change yet.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy ever it. It&#x27;s not working as described. It makes your scull black. If you wash hair everyday, it would not work for you.</li>
    <li> GrayBan is effective and easy to use. I no longer need to take a scissors to my gray hairs. It makes me feel better about myself.</li>
    <li> I have used it religiously for 1 month, and the result was no change in my hair colour, after paying for this product plus postage I feel cheated, when the product arrived it did not have the red star on it to say it was the new improved product, maybe I had old stock, It does not even rate 1 star, a waste of my time and my money</li>
    <li> I tried using the product and it started to work banishing gray right away. However I started to have allergic reactions of a sore scalp and fatigue.&lt;br /&gt;The smell of sulphur became unbearable and I really can&#x27;t put up with it long enough to have the product work. The smell kept me up at night.&lt;br /&gt;For those of you who don&#x27;t have allergic reactions, I can&#x27;t imagine that this product could be healthy to use regularly or even once. Oh well -&lt;br /&gt;disappointed again.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff and hope they never stop making it. I&#x27;m now on my fourth bottle.  My greys are now light brown and look like highlights in my long medium-dark brown hair - just what I wanted. I also like the body it adds to my fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had purchased this in late summer last year and using it every day in addition to sweating did make my hair too greasy.  This time, I started in early spring so the first six weeks of daily use that are required to tone existing hair wasn&#x27;t such an issue - or could at least be offset with some dry shampoo spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I wash my hair, apply any styling products, let it dry, spray Grayban in, then let it dry again.  I only wash my hair a couple of times a week so I&#x27;m only applying the Grayban a couple times a week now and it seems to be enough.  Occasionally, if I know I&#x27;ll be washing my hair the next day, I&#x27;ll apply it to the roots to make sure any new growth is getting enough applications, so that might up it to four times a week at most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does leave a slightly darker area on the collar of my light trench coat, but the brown dry shampoo spray I sometimes use does the same thing - for me it&#x27;s worth it to get a highlighted look rather than doing flat single-process color or having time-consuming highlights (which damage my hair anyway) put in at the salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is mild to me, and not unpleasant.  My husband doesn&#x27;t notice and once I spray on some hairspray or perfume, it&#x27;s definitely not an issue at all.</li>
    <li> This item didn&#x27;t work for me, it turned my hair yellowish brown and made my hair sticky, did have hair lost with this as well.</li>
    <li> you have to be fairly religious about applying it, plus the smell is off-putting, kind of like a sulfur smell.  It worked best for me on days when I decided to not shampoo, but that drove me crazy (again, the smell). The color stayed longer and also looked natural.  If you only have spots of gray, or want to cover roots, it&#x27;s a good choice.</li>
    <li> This product should be pulled off the shelves, where is the FDA when you need them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I starting using this product and expected some results, but found the adds are complete lies.  First you get a headache for about 3 hours after applying, thats probably because the chemicals are poison (of course that&#x27;s not disclosed in the adds).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other obviouse problem is the material has a brown tint which makes your white hair dull.  After two weeks of use my hair was a dull grey which looked dirty not brown. Even worse my natural hair color is black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money on this stuff.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Good price.  Speedy shipper.  Works well, but only on dark hair.  Very natural look.  Used it for years.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product even though there were negative reviews, shame on me!  I used the product as indicated and it turned my skin black.  I&#x27;m not sure what is in this product, but it can&#x27;t be good if it did that to my skin.</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s a very good product  my hair is turning black gradually and there are not side efects like itching</li>
    <li> This review is from: Verseo GrayBan Anti Grey Solution 6.8 oz. (Misc.)&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the product from verseo. Label with improved product packaging and results in 3 days. I used the product for 3 months and did not see even one white hair changed color. I turned to the company and they even did not respond as expected. Do not buy this just a fraud and waste of your money.</li>
    <li> Who wants purple hair?  This product seemed like a great idea and would probably work for people with a little gray. But for somebody with a head full of gray hair, this turns your hair purple. No bueno.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle of this product and I am well pleased.&lt;br /&gt;I use it to keep from getting more gray than I already am, not to totally&lt;br /&gt;eliminate all the gray in my hair.  After the first week it just takes an&lt;br /&gt;occasional application to the areas I want to change.&lt;br /&gt;I do not spray it on--I spray it on my fine comb and use the comb to&lt;br /&gt;apply it to the areas I want changed.</li>
    <li> Doesnt work, smells awful and metal stains jewlery.</li>
    <li> I do like the fact that it covers gray, but it runs down my face and leaves dark streaks I need to clean off.  Not a huge problem, as it just takes a washcloth and water and rubbing.  But I hadn&#x27;t noticed it on the skin near my temples one time and went out with areas of stained skin on my face.</li>
    <li> I admit this is a bit pricier than other brands, but you get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spray this on the worst gray spots around my temple area. I spray it on my hair before I dry it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do use another product (I won&#x27;t mention it). It comes in a creme (and I wish gray ban came in a creme, too) and I use it on the rest of my long hair while it&#x27;s wet, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re a gray killer combo. The gray ban does a great job on my stubborn gray and the creme keeps the brunette a vibrant color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No bad smell from gray ban, just great results.</li>
    <li> I bought this to help naturally cover the few strands of gray that I have. Unfortunately, it has not worked and I&#x27;m still plucking out those stubborn gray hairs. I have been using it for about a month now. I&#x27;m going to keep on using GrayBan until it&#x27;s gone. Hopefully I will begin seeing some positive results.</li>
    <li> Like some other reviewers, I have only white and grey hair. Also, I get a hair cut every three weeks. The best I have seen is a tint to my white/grey hair. Maybe works for less white/grey hair but not for me. If anything changes by the time the bottle is finished,  I will update this review.</li>
    <li> Smells terrible after being applied and exposed to sun.  It gave me a bad headache.</li>
    <li> I tried a similar product in Germany-Grayban is so much better.Very easy to use and gives a beautiful natural color.Thank you,Verseo!</li>
