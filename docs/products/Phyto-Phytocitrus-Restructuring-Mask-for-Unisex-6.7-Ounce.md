      <li>I love it and recommend it.</li>
      <li>Changing shampoos to moisturizing worked better.</li>

      <li>I have fine hair that is chemically treated.  </li>

      <li>I have wavy, thick hair, and it conditions my hair perfect.</li>
      <li>The masque has a pleasant, soft &amp; gentle aroma.</li>

      <li>It made my hair soft and healthy without any silicones.. which work temporarily but eventually really dried my hair out.</li>
      <li>Very natural &amp; no yucky perfumes, also it did not bother my allergies.</li>
      <li>I have to use all natural products &amp; many do not work, are overpriced &amp; just plain</li>
      <li>It not only makes it straighter, but so much softer!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my first time trying Phyto, and now I&#x27;m trying their entire line.  </li>
      <li>My experience was it makes the hair little smooth</li>
      <li>With some reluctance, I tried the Phytocitrus Mask and was pleasantly surprised.</li>
      <li>I was introduced to this on my last cruise, I will use no other conditioner, I live in the south and frizz is a BIG problem, I&#x27;m amazed at how much this helps</li>
      <li>I usually don&#x27;t splurge on shampoo/conditioner but this stuff actually makes a huge difference.</li>
      <li>I typically would not be interested in such a product as I normally use only conditioners.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t see the \\&quot;shine\\&quot; in my hair as other stated, and I can get just as much softness with pantene at a fraction of the cost.</li>

<li> so it has a tendency to get dry and damaged.  </li>

<li> not worth the bother.</li>

<li> I had previously tried a sample of [[ASIN:</li>
<li> I needed this product less often.</li>
<li> At 53 I finally had to break down and get color put in my hair because I got tired of plucking the gray ones out!  </li>
<li> I have just past the shoulder length hair, it&#x27;s color treated &amp; lots of gray.</li>
<li> This hair mask worked well for my thick, wavy and colored hair.</li>

    <li> I had high expectations on the Phyto products and i ordered this hoping it will help my extremely damaged thin and straight hair.  My experience was it makes the hair little smooth but you could get the same results from some other products which are much lesser in price  I think i wont give it another try..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of hair masks, but stopped looking when I found Phytocitrus. I use Phytocitrus once a week and it makes my hair soft and shiny without weighing it down like some other products. I get lots of compliments on my hair because Phytocitrus keeps it healthy and shiny. Wouldn&#x27;t want to be without it!</li>
    <li> I have coarse, thick, puffy hair, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products, from \\&quot;organic\\&quot; to obscure, hard-to-find brands. This one worked. It made my hair soft and healthy without any silicones.. which work temporarily but eventually really dried my hair out. I wish I&#x27;d found this earlier.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe I actually bought this especially given the price. However I read the reviews and thought if it worked this well maybe it&#x27;s worth it, NOT!! I don&#x27;t see the \\&quot;shine\\&quot; in my hair as other stated, and I can get just as much softness with pantene at a fraction of the cost. I have one more thing to say SAVE YOUR MONEY.</li>
    <li> By using Phytocitrus Restructuring Mask for Color Treated Hair, along with Phytocitrus Shampoo for color-treated hair, my hair stays beautiful and silky, rather than dried out, as color-treated hair often looks.  I receive many, many compliments about my \\&quot;beautiful hair\\&quot; and I love it.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a number of years and it is wonderful.  I have fine hair that is chemically treated.  I use this mask about once a week and it leaves my hair feeling wonderful and behaving as it should.  I usually don&#x27;t have a great amount of time so I apply it in the shower and leave it on a max of 5 minutes.  My hairdresser tells me that I would love it even more if I put it on wet hair and put a warm towel around my head for 20 to 30 minutes, then rinse out.  Haven&#x27;t had time to try that yet.</li>
    <li> My stylist used this product on me after I got colored and highlighted and my hair felt amazing.  I have thick curly hair that I blow dry and straighten daily so it has a tendency to get dry and damaged.  I bought it to use at home, but she gave me a great tip.

That routine has really made my hair shine and I barely have to use the flat iron after blow drying because it is so manageable.  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I feel like I have bought all conditioners, leave-in treatments, etc. on the market in an effort to improve my hair that had begun to feel like straw, particularly on the ends.  Nothing seemed to make a difference, until I tried Phytocitrus!  I just received it yesterday, and after one use, there is an amazing difference in my hair -- softer, silkier and shiny.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this on my last cruise, I will use no other conditioner, I live in the south and frizz is a BIG problem, I&#x27;m amazed at how much this helps</li>
    <li> I am ordering this now after receiving a sample from Nordstrom in some makeup that I ordered.  I typically would not be interested in such a product as I normally use only conditioners.  At 53 I finally had to break down and get color put in my hair because I got tired of plucking the gray ones out!  I noticed that my hair did not feel as luxurious as it did before I had color put in.  After using Phytocitrus my hair felt even better than before I had color applied.  I LOVE THIS STUFF!!  My hair feels clean, SHINY, and packed with body without any residue feeling.  In fact it&#x27;s super shiny!!  I just put a quarter size amount to my hair after shampooing, and leave it in for 5 minutes. (while I finish my shower routine)&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion Phytocitrus works like magic!!</li>
    <li> I have frizzy/curly hair and like to straighten my hair. This product gives it a whole new texture.  It not only makes it straighter, but so much softer!</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of the Phytocirtus mask, and as soon as I tried it I HAD to order it - it&#x27;s just amazing!!  This products leaves my hair feeling so soft - I&#x27;ve honestly NEVER felt my hair this soft in my life.  It&#x27;s my first time trying Phyto, and now I&#x27;m trying their entire line.  I don&#x27;t love all of their products, but this one is a keeper.  I have wavy, thick hair, and it conditions my hair perfect.</li>
    <li> I use this only when my hair feels very dry.  It&#x27;s not a every day use.  Changing shampoos to moisturizing worked better. I needed this product less often.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this mask. I usually don&#x27;t splurge on shampoo/conditioner but this stuff actually makes a huge difference. My hair looks fuller and stays cleaner longer. I have blonde hair and it tends to look greasy the day after washing, but not with this stuff! I often get compliments on my hair after using this in combo with the PhytoCitrus shampoo.</li>
    <li> This masque is terrific! I have just past the shoulder length hair, it&#x27;s color treated &amp; lots of gray. My hair felt like butter &amp; like it was when I was a teenager, I&#x27;m now over 50. The masque has a pleasant, soft &amp; gentle aroma. Very natural &amp; no yucky perfumes, also it did not bother my allergies. I have to use all natural products &amp; many do not work, are overpriced &amp; just plain not worth the bother. Thank you Phyto, brilliant!</li>
    <li> This hair mask worked well for my thick, wavy and colored hair. I had previously tried a sample of [[ASIN:B000LW1I2Q Phyto Phytobaume Conditioner - All Hair Types 6.7 oz]] but it hadn&#x27;t been sufficient for my hair type at all. With some reluctance, I tried the Phytocitrus Mask and was pleasantly surprised. I didn&#x27;t need to use a lot of product (Quarter-size was enough) and also left it in only for about 4 minutes. The result was shiny, smooth hair that was also quite manageable. In addition, it seemed to have given my color a bit of a refresher which was nice. This one I might buy again, depending on whether I can find it at an attractive price...:-)</li>
    <li> Best conditioner on the market.</li>
    <li> Leaves my color-treated hair silky soft and has greatly reduced the breakage problem I was experiencing. I love it and recommend it.</li>
    <li> I actually haven&#x27;t used this as directed yet.  Instead, I use it more as a conditioner,  in the shower, after shampooing, I apply to my hair and leave it in while I shave my legs.  Then I rinse.  It gives my hair a wonderful silky texture.  I feel sure it would benefit me to leave it in longer, as directed, and I plan to try that, as well.</li>
    <li> really good product, makes the texture of your hair softer and more managable, the price was great too!!! I really like it</li>
