    <li> [[ASIN:B002WR58XS (1 oz / 30 ml) GLYCOLIC Acid 70% Skin Chemical Peel - Unbuffered - Alpha Hydroxy (AHA) For Acne, Oily Skin, Wrinkles, Blackheads, Large Pores &amp; More (from Skin Beauty Solutions)]]This product is good but be careful it does burn your face if you put too much on .</li>
    <li> This stuff is wonderful! But you must be very careful. If you have never used this high of concentration, please use with caution. It can burn you. It only takes a few drops on a cotton ball to cover your entire face. Leave it on for less than a minute your first time and work your way up to longer and longer gradually. It&#x27;s a great price for the amount. I use it a couple times a week and love what it does for my skin. It helps keep me free of breakouts, diminishes my fine lines, and helps reduce the appearance of my pores.</li>
    <li> This is a great product but it is NOT the one to buy if you are not already an experienced peel user. It is strong and could cause serious burns. I use this on my arms and legs and started with leaving it on only two minutes and increasing time as I learned my skin&#x27;s tolerance. The dark spots/freckles that I had on my arms and legs were greatly improved after several treatments. Now I use it once a month for maintenance. Be sure and use sunblock to keep the spots from returning. I use the 40% solution on my face. As others have noted, I found this product does the same or better than expensive chemical peels I had at a dermatologist&#x27;s office. Read the directions, start with leaving it on a VERY short time (until you know how your skin reacts) and enjoy clearer, smoother skin.</li>
    <li> I was going to the dermatologist paying $66 a pop for a quick lunch time exfoliation/peel...doctor&#x27;s office was using 70% glycolic acid...this appears to be much stronger than the product used at the doctors office...you must be careful with this very potent product...I can only leave it on for up to one minute...but it works...just be careful.</li>
    <li> 100% would be better but its good enough also good quality. 70 is good for the face it wont scar as bad as tca</li>
    <li> I got no peeling and it did not improve brown spots.</li>
    <li> it wasn&#x27;t quite as strong as I expected it to be, but it is good. And, a good value for the money.</li>
    <li> Just started using this product a couple weeks ago. so far my skin is noticeably softer and more smooth which makes my make up look better and last longer. I haven&#x27;t really noticed any improvement in scarring, pores, or hyperpigmentation but am hoping that I will see results with continued use. This stuff is powerful so follow directions! Also make sure to have the baking soda and water mixture made before you apply.</li>
    <li> As with any product that contains an acid base follow all directions and less is always best until you are familar with this product.  Only speaking from personal use I love this product.</li>
    <li> THIS IS A GOOD PRODUCT...BUT YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL NOT TO LEAVE IT ON TOO LONG OR IT&#x27;LL BURN YOU!</li>
    <li> This Glycolic acid 70% skin chemical peel is great! But you must be very careful. Use with caution. It can burn you. Work up from the lower concentrations so your skin can adjust to it.  Leave it on for less than a minute your first time and work your way up to longer and longer gradually. I use it a couple times a week and love what it does for my skin. It bleaches the aging spots, reduces wrinkles, and stimulates collagen growth.</li>
    <li> Does work but will burn if left on for more than a few minutes. I mixed some baking soda with water in a spray bottle and I deactivate it with that.</li>
    <li> Glycolic peels are typically expensive, and when I looked at other places to get it myself, I couldn&#x27;t find a weak solution for under $79.  This was a great deal because it&#x27;s stronger (so you can dilute it and make it last longer).  Just make sure you read up on how to apply it safely and effectively because it&#x27;s an acid you are putting on your skin.  So again, BE CAREFUL on how to apply this.  Great product, great price!</li>
    <li> I mix this half and half with a light moisturizer, leave it for a few minutes and then shower it all off. My skin is so much smoother and toned.&lt;br /&gt;Do avoid the eyes and eyelids and only use a tiny bit until you know how your skin will react. You can always use a bit more next time.</li>
    <li> I would reccomend it to anyone. This does work, but you must follow the directions as stated. It is very easy to use, but if you abuse it, it will make you pay... And, it can take a month or two, to correct what ever over use damage you did. But don&#x27;t, panic, your skin repairs it&#x27;s self, if you harm it ... Just don&#x27;t get there, Like I did.. I have used it many times and it works, and I am 57 years old...</li>
    <li> Very strong. Use as directed and if it burns, get it off immediately. It also helps to neutralize your skin after you have washed it off with baking soda made into a paste using water.</li>
    <li> I used it and almost no sensation and no effect and no need to remove it. My wife used it and minimal effect and certainly no peeling. She left it on for 10 minutes or more. Considering what others are posting is some of the product diluted?</li>
    <li> Of course, for optimal skin you should really combine a couple of treatments as well as using excellent skin care daily! I got turned onto Microdermabrasions and these type of peels when I was just 21. Now, almost 40 (having continued this level of skin care ever since) I have beautiful skin! And I&#x27;m very fair and Caucasian. Yes, this product is a \\&quot;no brainer\\&quot;. Now I get the treatments that used to cost me $150. (per area) at home for pennies on the dollar! My only warning is you NEED to read the insert (instructions) carefully and follow them to the T. This is NOT a case of more is better. Last but not leat, do NOT use this product within days of another abrasive treatment (like a wax or microdermasion etc). You will get scars or hyperpigmentation that could take years to get rid of!!! Otherwise, I suggest this product all the way!!!</li>
    <li> No change in skin been using it for about 3 months now i dont see any significant change not even slightest change in my skin. It didnt shrink my large pores though my oil skin doesnt get that greasy now dont notice any other changes..</li>
    <li> Good source for Glycolic Acid.</li>
    <li> Buyer beware. This is 70% solution of glycolic acid is very potent. Be sure to follow the enclosed directions exactly as stated. I wish I had started with a less potent solution such as 30 or 40% glycolic acid and worked my way up. If you leave it on too long, you will definitely end up burning your face. I made that mistake thinking the longer I have it  on my face, the better the results will be. Wrong! Now I have discoloration on the left side of my cheek :(</li>
    <li> Wonderful product does not seem to be too strong for sensitive skin. Will save you hundreds of dollars by not going to the spa.  You simply put it on, wait for few minutes and rinse it off  it&#x27;s very simple and easy.  Makes my skin very soft, helps with any sun damage</li>
    <li> I started out buying &amp; using the 50% peel. After I felt that it was no longer beneficial to me, I decided to get this. After just one treatment, the rest of my stubborn acne scars are gone!! I&#x27;m so xcited &amp; will be continue to use this. Be very careful though. If you&#x27;re not then you can do more damage than good. I suggest that you dont get something this high if you&#x27;re  just starting out</li>
    <li> Great product...buy it but be careful and use as directed</li>
    <li> I would recommend buying a less potent formulation of this glycolic acid solution. Its really way to powerful and borderline dangerous on skin.</li>
    <li> I used the peel for only 2 min. on my face and had no visible peeling effect though the skin was smooth and clean after 4 days.</li>
