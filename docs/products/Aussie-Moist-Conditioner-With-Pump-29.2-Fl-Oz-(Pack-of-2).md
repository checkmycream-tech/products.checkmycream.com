<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It has great moisturization and slip for anyone who has natural hair. That is all I can attest to cause that&#x27;s what I have. Very few ingredients and does a great job of helping me to detangle my hair in the shower and providing much needed moisture and conditioning. The price point on Amazon for the dual pack can&#x27;t be beat and they include a coupon? I&#x27;m sold!</li>
    <li> I bought this because a lot of the reviews stated that it was very moisturizing. I also saw this particular Aussie product listed on some &amp;#34;dry hair&amp;#34; blog posts. I had been feeling like my hair was getting too much protein since almost every deep conditioner, shampoo, etc. adds proteins of some sort to their products. Stupid fads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The overdose of protein and the recent move to an area with very hard water was leaving my hair, scalp and skin dry as can be. I stopped washing my hair and just started conditioning. I have used Aussie&#x27;s 3 minute miracle products and those are very moisturizing. I feel that this product isn&#x27;t really any better than a generic Suave conditioner. I tried leaving this conditioner on my hair for a minute total (even though the directions don&#x27;t specify to do so) and it still didn&#x27;t make my hair softer and actually made my hair feel stiff after the minute was up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up buying a pricier product that works so much better and conditions without proteins. I still have this in my shower because it came with two giant bottles but I just mix it with the other conditioner to provide more coverage. I might end up throwing the second bottle away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess sometimes you get what you pay for. Love Aussie products but this conditioner just didn&#x27;t cut it.</li>
    <li> Great product. It left my hair feeling soft and managable LOVED THIS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> The commodity price is really high, smell good, the price is not high, very love</li>
    <li> Make my hair so smooth</li>
    <li> This is a great product for those with thick hair! Really quenches my hair&#x27;s thirst!</li>
    <li> I am absolutely in love with Aussie shampoo. I have been using it for 15+ years and didn&#x27;t realize what it did for my hair until I switched to salon brand. I bought some shampoo from my hair dresser and was disappointed with it. I started using my Aussie again and my hair is visibly shinier, and smooth to the point where I can run my fingers through it and there isn&#x27;t a single tangle. The best combination is the Aussome Volume shampoo with the Moist conditioner. This leaves your hair feeling really clean, but also really smooth and shiny. Sometimes you take the things you use every day for granted until you switch to something else. This is also a pretty good deal on the package, but I&#x27;m not quite sure why this is an add on item.</li>
    <li> I already love aussie moist, I buy it locally to co-wash my natural hair and to mix in with deep conditioner. I got it on subscribe and save with a 20% discount plus coupon so I almost got 2 bottles for the price of one.</li>
    <li> I will not use any other conditioner on my hair!</li>
    <li> I love Aussie moist. It smells great, has great slip and moisturizes exceptionally well. I love the pump it makes using it in the shower so easy. Did I say it has great slip? I have huge curly hair and with Aussie Moist detangling is a breeze. The ingredients are great it doesn&#x27;t have tons of the stuff no one can pronounce let alone knows what it is. I&#x27;ve been using Aussie Moist for a few years know and probably will never stop.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this conditioner. I cannot believe how condition my hair feels after using this product. In addition to using it after shampooing, I also use it as a leave-in by diluting it with water and mixing a little aloe vera gel and argan, olive or coconut oil. Great stuff and great price. I will definitely continue using.</li>
    <li> Works great in mine and my childrens hair. Leaves hair smooth and less tangles.</li>
    <li> Curly hair girls, this is a great conditioner! I have been using it for almost 15 years now and it hasn&#x27;t let me down. They have been slowly taking away the ounces though :(</li>
    <li> I love the Aussie 3-minute miracle conditioner but it is just a little too deep for everyday use.  That&#x27;s why I love this &amp;#34;moist conditioner&amp;#34; because it is just like 3 min miracle but not as heavy.  I can use the moist conditioner every day and not worry about it making my hair greasy or heavy.  I also love the coconut type scent . . . Mmmmm!  :)</li>
    <li> After reading the e-book \\&quot;Curly like me\\&quot; I bought this on recommendation.  Winter is officially here and I need a conditioner that will take care of my latina mix of \\&quot;S\\&quot; and \\&quot;corkscrew\\&quot; curls.  This conditioner does the job and I love the convenience of the pump.  The smell is great and I carry a little bottle in my purse to \\&quot;freshen\\&quot; up my curls during the day if need be.  Good deal too!</li>
    <li> I like Aussie Moist as a regular conditioner. I prefer other products for a deep conditioner, but I find for regular conditioning on my 4a/4b hair, Aussie moist is great!</li>
    <li> We all know that it&#x27;s all the rage these days for manufacturers to down-size their products a bit rather than raising prices.  Aussie takes this to a new level.  The new pump bottles -- which sell at similar prices to the original pump bottles -- contain a whopping 20% less product than they used to.  For the same price of the old \\&quot;125 uses\\&quot; packages, you can now get a \\&quot;100 uses\\&quot; package.  It&#x27;s good conditioner, but suddenly there&#x27;s a whole lot less of it.</li>
    <li> Aussie products rock!  And they&#x27;re not expensive or difficult to get.  Make my hair soft, shiny and nice-smelling.  Yay, Aussies!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years too. I like the bottle, pump, and the conditioner really does help my hair.  I use the other 3 min treatment by this company for frizziness when the weather is really weird. Good product line.</li>
    <li> Love this makes your hair soft and manageable ... Lovely smell and would buy some more when I run out....</li>
    <li> I am an African American woman with natural, medium-length, shoulder-grazing Type 4 tightly curly hair.  I follow what&#x27;s known as the Tightly Curly Method, as designed by author Teri LaFlesh as laid out in her eye-opening book, \\&quot;Curly Like Me.\\&quot;  This method revolves around the use of a moisturizing \\&quot;combing\\&quot; conditioner that is combed through soaking wet hair with a Denman brush and left in, not rinsed out.  I love the method, it works well for me, and this conditioner was highly recommended by the author.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came to Aussie Moist because my previous absolute favorite, Herbal Essences Hello Hydration (from here on out referred to as HH), had added a potentially harmful ingredient (sodium hydroxide) that I did not want to use on my hair (one of the most important aspects of the TC Method is to pay attention to ingredients).  Prior to that, HH was my Holy Grail of conditioners. Five stars all the way. It combed well with plenty of slip, it defined my curls, it moisturized...and it smelled AMAZING.  It was a sad, sad day when I realized that I should no longer use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been happily using HH for almost a year, so I was a little nervous about trying something new.  But when I did...I must say I was quite pleased with the results!  In some ways I think Aussie Moist is actually superior to HH, and in some very small ways it is not quite as good, in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it is a different texture than HH, a lot lighter/more watery, not as dense.  I therefore had to use more at a time.  I&#x27;ve always added a little bit of olive oil to my combing conditioner for shine, slip and to help seal in moisture.  But I have to say that combing my hair out with the Aussie Moist in my hair was much nicer than combing with the HH.  The Aussie Moist was just so much silkier for some reason, allowing the brush to glide through my hair - and any little tangles - much more effortlessly.  I couldn&#x27;t believe the difference!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 2nd most noticeable thing:  The scent.  Aussie Moist smells great, but it&#x27;s definitely an inferior scent to HH.  Aussie smells very nice, but it kind of has a more synthetic-smelling underscent.  I mean, to me, there&#x27;s no comparison.  Herbal Essences has a lock on really great, more complex scents.  Say what you will about the line, but they know how to hook you up with delicious smelling hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another difference I noticed is that with Aussie, the conditoner - which, like HH, goes onto hair white - takes longer to fade/soak into the hair.  Again, with the TC method, the conditioner is applied, combed through the hair and left on the hair, not rinsed out.  When you&#x27;re leaving it on your hair, most conditioners will soak into your hair and fade away quickly, and you definitely want this, especially if your hair is very dark, like mine.  In my experience, the Aussie Moist, in a few tiny places, took a lot longer to fade away than the HH ever did.  This may also be because I had to use a little more of it, I&#x27;m not sure.  All I do know is that a few tiny spots took a bit longer for it to fade away, and I had to manually assist it more by smoothing it with my fingers and adding a tad bit of water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT...softness points go back to Aussie Moist!  HH defined my curls really well, better than Aussie Moist, in fact, but the curls were harder, which I just accepted as being a necessary part of aggressive long-term curl definition.  I was really surprised to see that Aussie Moist definted my curls well, but they were much softer. Because my hair was so fluffy soft after using this, it didn&#x27;t have as much movement as it did when using HH.  With the HH, when my head moved, my curls bounced and swung, even when it was shorter. The Aussie Moist just doesn&#x27;t strike me as having as much weight to it, which is a detriment for me.  Time will tell to see if my curls remain all week...I definitely will be updating my review as the week wears on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And finally, though this is aesthetic, as pretty much any conditioner can be put into a pump bottle! - I LOVE the pump!  :-)  Super convenient, and I don&#x27;t have to pick up and try to hold onto the bottle with slippery hands...though after almost a year, I&#x27;ve become an expert at handling bottles, a brush and hair clips with slippery, water-olive-oil-and-conditioner-soaked hands, rarely dropping anything.  It&#x27;s amazing how you can learn to evolve to your surroundings!!  HA!!  But hey, a pump is pretty awesomely easy to handle!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, Aussie Moist gets two thumbs up from me!  I like!  PROS: PERFECT slip, PERFECT moisture, great smell, decently good curl definition, touchable softness.  CONS: just a few - takes a little longer/more effort for visible signs of conditioner to soak/fade into hair, curl definition not as good (may get frizzier faster), not as much weight to the product so curls don&#x27;t bounce and move as much when dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is 4 stars, but I&#x27;m still looking for that 5 star conditioner that I&#x27;ll fall in love with. Next, I&#x27;m going to test run another conditioner, Herbal Essences None of Your Frizzness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE (03/04/14): It&#x27;s been a full week.  As explained the Tightly Curly Method involves using a combing conditioner (in this case Aussie Moist) to comb out soaking wet hair, and then the conditioner is left in the hair, never rinsed out.  Every morning after for the reminder of the week until its time to wash again, the hair is wetted and then a tad more conditioner is applied to refresh the curls and provide moisture.  After a week of doing this, a few things:  Aussie Moist provides great moisture.  I love it in that respect.  It still smells very nice.  However, my concerns about the softer hair were founded.  Yes, my hair is gloriously soft.  However, my curls are not as defined and my hair gets frizzier much quicker and easier than it did with HH, so I wish that Aussie had more weight to it. :-(</li>
    <li> While I love this product, I am very upset because I ordered a Pack of 2 and did not receive 2. When my package arrived it consisted of only 1 bottle.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t realize I was receiving two, so I was super surprised and happy with this</li>
    <li> I love the size of this conditioner! And my hair feels excellent when I use it, it has done wonders! Love this product!</li>
    <li> Perfect and with delicious smell.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner, I can&#x27;t tell you how amazing this stuff is, if you need extra conditioning like I do than your hair will love this too, it keeps away the breakage and split ends, I have never had split ends using this, and my hair is way less frizzy, without this I wouldn&#x27;t be able to comb my hair at all, because its thick and tangles but this stuff is great, I also use their hairspray as well. too bad amazon doesn&#x27;t offer this in the subscribe and save two pack anymore</li>
    <li> Very good product as shown in the page for a very good price !! I recommend, and hope you enjoy like me !</li>
    <li> A really good detangler for super curly and dry 3c/4a natural hair!! It&#x27;s cheap, has slip, and you get a good size amount with a pump and makes my hair soft, silky and shiny. Def a staple!!!!</li>
    <li> Let me just say that this conditioner is very good, especially if you have very tangly hair..and if you&#x27;ve tried the Aussie 3 Minute Miracle then this is exactly like that but a lighter consistency...I&#x27;m not going to rave too much about this since I found the conditioning to just be normal but definitely try it if you have hair that isn&#x27;t too damaged and would like a lot of condish at a great price! Just try it out for yourself :D</li>
    <li> I posted this same review on the Moist shampoo as they are a pair in my case!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...I found it! I&#x27;ve tried Pantene (which isn&#x27;t even good for your hair), John Freida, Aveda, Garnier, Tresseme...you name it. Some of them were OKAY but none were great. I&#x27;ve tried mousses, leave-ins...everything. Anyways, I have extremely thick, DRY, coarse horse-like texture hair. And then I use this combined with the Moist shampoo and not only do I not have to use extra products but it just feels sooo soft and takes away some of the bulky volume I fight (even with layered hair) and creates style as oppose to frizz. And even though it adds moisture it actually feels VERY light and VERY clean!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this to anyone with oily and/or thin hair, but for anyone with my annoying hair type, I definitely would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I&#x27;ve been using this for about 1.5 months.</li>
    <li> This is a great conditioner with a very bad pump on the bottle that stops pumping when there is still a lot of product left in the bottle.</li>
    <li> Aussie Moist is amazing, I use it for a cowash and deep conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;However, I ordered two packs of two. What I received: one of my packs were Aussie MOIST and the other was Aussie CONFIDENTLY CLEAN. Not the same at all.</li>
    <li> I love this product and have always enjoyed using it.  My daughter and I love the way it leaves our hair feeling and smelling.  I&#x27;m more of a Redkin lover but for the price, it leaves me feeling a bit worked over.  This Aussie product gives the same effect but for a fraction of the price and Amazon&#x27;s specials make it an even better buy.  Pair this with the shampoo and it&#x27;s superb.</li>
    <li> This is some really nice conditioner for co-washing. The only gripe I have is with the pump, once it gets down to the bottom the pump is useless...  I had to take it apart to get to a lot of the conditioner.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an African American girl who has bleached her hair a few times and used color, and if you can imagine my hair is damaged from the harsh chemicals. I started to experience breakage immediately and thought that protein conditioners were the way to go. I tried that and experienced MORE breakage. I then decided after some researching, to buy a moisture based conditioner for dry hair. I&#x27;ve tried a couple of suggested ones from black hair forums online, but this was BY FAR the best choice. It not only smells good but it leaves my hair soooo soft afterwards. My breakage didn&#x27;t stop right away, but I kid you not, there were barely any hairs in my comb after I finished. I&#x27;m saying it seems like my hair breakage is reduced 90%. Every single time. I didn&#x27;t hear my hair snapping either like I did after using protein conditioners. It just felt so soft. The great thing about this is that I can use it everyday if I wanted to and it wouldn&#x27;t be harsh on my hair at all. I only leave it in for an hour, but you can leave it on longer.</li>
    <li> This product is just wonderful and give me an awesome hair day with every use! I love that it can be bought in bulk cheaper than at walmart!!!</li>
    <li> LOVE this product! My hair is curly but it gets ALOT of salt water and sun damage which dries it out very quickly. When i first used this product i was amazed. My hair instantly felt smooth and silky. It looked shiny and healthy. I&#x27;ve been hooked for about 6 months now. I love love love it!</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this conditioner!!! It has great slip for my curly 3b hair and it made detangling a breeze! My new holy grail conditioner :-)</li>
    <li> You can find this for $3-6 at walmart or similar stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried using this stuff for about two years before I gave up and ventured out to others. I mainly used this in DC mixes for moisture and protein. It&#x27;s just OK as a plain rinse out, co wash, or DC. Honestly nothing special there. I think this conditioner works best with homemade mixes, mixed with aloe vera and oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has way too much fragrance in it. It&#x27;s in the top 5 ingredients. It smells good but too overpowering and obnoxious. It&#x27;s also a bit heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a normal rinse out conditioner, I would look elsewhere. It&#x27;s one of the more expensive cheapie conditioners at $5.37 for 29oz, and doesn&#x27;t preform all that well on it&#x27;s own. Also, the makers decreased the bulk size a few years ago without decreasing the price. I prefer Tresemme Hydrating Curls Conditioner, and that&#x27;s what I now use.</li>
    <li> My go-to conditioner as a leave-in or co-wash. Never lets me down and has good slip for detangling.</li>
    <li> Good conditioner, feels conditioned, not greasy!</li>
    <li> My scalp does not like this product.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner for many of the same reasons I love the shampoo. I bought them together, in &amp;#34;Moist,&amp;#34; and the conditioner is wonderful on my extra long hair. It is easier to comb through than most brands, and I like the pump and delivery system.  Also, my scalp is very sensetive, and like the shampoo, this conditioner does not give me a rash. Please continue to make this item in this size, along with the pump, and in &amp;#34;Moist.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I love love love this conditioner.  Aussie Moist makes my hair really soft.  The slip is great and the price was really good.  I will order this product again.....</li>
    <li> I am hispanic with very frizzy, curly hair.  I use this condition it the shower and rinse it out after 5 minutes.  Then, I apply more after towel drying.  It keeps my hair from getting frizzy.  It defines my curls.  I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> This works pretty well. I have wavy/curly hair, and it does a good job moisturizing it. I prefer aussie deeeeeep three minute miracle for its thickness and lingering smell. This smells good, but doesn&#x27;t stay. It can also make hair a little greasy if you put it at the roots, sokeep it at the end.  It&#x27;s a good conditioner for the price.

    <li> I love this shampoo &amp; conditioner because it smells good and is great for my curly hair.  I use very little shampoo and way too much conditioner every week to keep my hair in good health so these pumps are perfect for my needs.  The only complaint I have is that there is A LOT left in the container once you get down to the end, so to use it all you need to throw away the pump and shake it upside, which is not ideal (but is the case with many hair products).</li>
    <li> Nice product and shipping!</li>
    <li> This is a very nice conditioner.  After using it only once, my hair feels soft and smells very nice.  Would definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> this was my first time using this brand, and I absolutely love this product. It moisturizes well and smells good. plus, if you&#x27;re a person that wears weaves, this conditioner is great to use</li>
    <li> I love both the shampoo and the conditioner Aussie made available in the large 29 oz bottle with a pump.  No more hassle of trying to grip a wet, slippery bottle, which usually slips out from my hands when trying to get the cap open.  The pump on the Aussie ensures ease of getting the right amount of conditioner each time, without wasting due to spills.</li>
    <li> use this as a pre-poo as well as a co-wash and it has great slip and makes my hair feel so soft.</li>
    <li> I have natural Black hair, and I needed a good conditioner for co-washing, and I&#x27;d read a lot about Aussie Moist. The reason I bought it was the price, and the size of the bottles. Really, I&#x27;d have to pay more in a store for one of these giant bottles, than I did for the double pack. I don&#x27;t know about some, but mine came with the pump tops. I&#x27;ve had it now for months, and I&#x27;ve only recently started using the second bottle, because the first one is so low that it doesn&#x27;t pump out, I guess I&#x27;d have to de-bottle it to get the rest, which is about an eighth of the bottle. I use quite a bit each time I do my hair, especially if I&#x27;m detangling, and it does its duty. Until I can find a cheap DIY conditioner that has the slip I need, I&#x27;m sticking with this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years, along with its shampoo counterpart.  However I have always bought it in the stores until now.  I was pleased to find that the large volume 29.2 oz versions are available online with the subscribe &amp; save option.  These bottles last me for a few months, and this \\&quot;Moist\\&quot; brand does a good job to keep the natural dryness and stiffness of my hair under control.</li>
    <li> no as much slip for my transitioning hair</li>
    <li> This makes my hair feel so very soft.  It helps my hair stay moisturized.  I will definitely buy this stuff over and over again.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and it&#x27;s an excellent detangler.  Makes my curls soft.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is amazing and really nourishes hair. But the best thing is the smell, it&#x27;s incredible. I definitely recommend this conditioner to all!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why it took me so long to try this conditioner but I AM IN LOVE. It smells great, it thick and rich, gives great slip and best of all leaves my hair soft and moisturized, kinda like butter - (I don&#x27;t know if that is a good analogy or not lol). But my hair really loves this conditioner and it is definitely a staple product for me.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s simply my favorite conditioner. It has great slip, smells amazing and makes my hair soft. Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For what it&#x27;s worth, my hair is very, very fine but I have a metric crapton of it. Seriously, so much hair.</li>
    <li> I swim three to five days a week which, even with wearing a swim cap and using chlorine removing shampoo, really takes its toll on my hair. Flummoxed at the prices of the fancy salon conditioners, I asked a friend of mine who is a former beautician what I should use. She recommended this conditioner and I took her word for it because she&#x27;s very picky about what she puts in her hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a full week of using this conditioner - both under my cap during my swim for a deep conditioner/protection from chlorine and during my shower afterwards, my hair feels like it&#x27;s back to normal. Actually, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s better than normal; it&#x27;s turned from straw to silk!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love the scent of this conditioner and it&#x27;s thickness. I only use about a half pump&#x27;s worth at a time and have barely touched my first bottle after a full month of use. I liked it so much, I ordered a subscription from Amazon because I can&#x27;t find a better product for a better price.</li>
    <li> Does not last as long their shampoo.  I have long hair, a little pass my shoulder blades, it take about 3 pumps to condition my hair the shampoo is just one.  Takes a few mintues to fully rinse out,  not as long as the &#x27;3 minutes conditioner&#x27;  that is at lease 5 minutes to rinse out.  Works very good, I have used this brand for 15 years, my hair is always strong and shinny, No dry scalp or spilt ends.  I condition about 2 times a week.</li>
    <li> The product says\\&quot;pack of two\\&quot; but I only recieved one bottle.  Disappointed.  Otherwise it was packaged well and the right size bottle.</li>
    <li> I have 4a/b hair and this stuff makes my detangling sessions in the shower much easier (provides a lot of slip, making it easier to comb through my hair). I add a bit of olive oil to make it into a deep conditioner. And I love the fact that there&#x27;s a pump, which makes it easier to handle while in the shower. And you can&#x27;t beat the price. I highly recommend this conditioner for anyone with curly hair.</li>
    <li> This is great conditioner to get tangles out of my 6 year olds hair.  She has long hair which she hates to have brushed, but this conditioner helps minimize the tangles.  After washing hair, I will put some at the ends of her long hair and let her play in the tub.  Right as she is ready to get out, I rinse it out.  Really makes combing the hair much easier with less tears.</li>
    <li> Aussie Moist Shampoo and Conditioner are great products! They both smell great, have great lather, and rinse well. Aussie Moist Conditioner makes my hair silky smooth, my comb glides right through without a problem, and it leaves my hair smelling wonderful. This is one of those conditioners that has a long lasting great smell that can last almost all day. Its great, I would recommend this to anyone that needs a thick conditioner to moisturize their hair, or someone that needs a conditioner that will make their hair manageable in the shower.</li>
    <li> I use this conditioner almost daily. I also use it for on my 8 year-old daughter&#x27;s hair.  Great for getting rid of tangles. I also use it to shave my legs.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have super thick hair that gets dry because I blow dry it a lot. This conditioner is the only one I&#x27;ve found that leaves my hair soft and smooth!</li>
    <li> When I wear my hair curly (I often flat iron it), it gets VERY dry very quickly. I really love Aussie because it is not super oily, and conditions my hair very quickly in the shower without being super heavy and hard to rinse out of my mass of curls. In fact, it is even light enough that when I want a frizz-free look, I I only rinse it out at the roots and use it as a leave-in, and it works like a charm (although you definitely need to rinse it out that night or the next day!). Also smells delicious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All around, perfect for me since I have to use so much every time I condition to really moisturize my hair, so the cheap price and the pump are both necessary. My best conditioning experince so far (as opposed ot other, more expensive brands like Pantene, Treseeme, John Frieda). Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> i love this conditioner its amazing and it helps your hair alot and the price is great i would recomend this conditioner.</li>
    <li> I have tried a couple different conditioners in my day..Right before I tried Aussie I was using \\&quot;Hello Hydration\\&quot; to no avail. did little to nothing for my hair. However when I tried this Aussies Moist OMG for my usually dry hair that doesn&#x27;t usually detangle until I use my leave in/detangler conditioner. This stuff did the job I used it as a deep conditioner under a hooded dryer and my hair feels like silk,butter whatever you want to call it feels great! Also walmart sells the pump size for $5.37 so you can also get a great deal there in store....Thanks I&#x27;m forever yours,Aussie!</li>
    <li> I have been using this conditioner for 6 years now and I haven&#x27;t found any other one that gives me that kind of quality for the same price. My hair is always soft and smelling good.</li>
    <li> Been using this conditioner for years and I swear by it. I always get complimented on how my hair smells. Great product.</li>
    <li> I love the Aussie products, especially the moist shampoo and conditioner. They leave my hair so clean and soft and smelling nice. These big pump bottles of conditioner will last me a very long time.</li>
    <li> Aussie Moist is the only line of in-shower shampoo and conditioner that I use. It is so great for my long hair. My ends usually dry out really fast and that leads to split ends and other nasty stuff. I let this conditioner soak into the ends of my hair while I shower and it makes a huge difference. My hair looks healthy and doesn&#x27;t tangle.</li>
    <li> I love this smell and the conditioner keeps my hair feeling soft and moisturized. I love the pump too comes in handy while using in the shower.</li>
    <li> I like the amount, and the way it makes my hair feel. The smell is a bit chemical-y though, which is off-putting but not so much so that I will stop using it.</li>
    <li> I used to buy this in stores and its so nice to have it on amazon now.  I love that I order and it just shows up, no more putting it on a list and making sure to get to the store before you run out.  the product is good too, pretty standard shampoo/conditioner.</li>
    <li> Allergic reaction! I have a nut allergy and after using this my throat slowly closed up in a matter of hours and I had to take benedryl, take a shower and wash my hair out with a clarifying shampoo. No rash, just eye irritation, discomfort, and throat feeling like it&#x27;s closing. I&#x27;m not allergic to aloe as I use that in my hair... I will not use this or jojoba again.</li>
    <li> I love love love this conditioner. It always leaves my hair feeling oo so soft and full of moisture.  My hair has been thriving tremendously after the start of using this product. I highly recommend it especially for natural hair girls, like myself, that struggle with hair that gets dry quickly.</li>
    <li> This conditioner performs similar to the conditioner you get in a box of hair color. I have long, thin, colored hair that is dry and this is the best conditioner I have found for it (and I have tried a lot). Leaves my hair feeling really good, shinny and smooth. The value for the price is great! I had only found one other conditioner that worked like the hair color box conditioners and and it was only 8 ounces for twice the price. I&#x27;m really pleasantly surprised by this conditioner.</li>
    <li> I use it all the time.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product and I use it with the paired shampoo.  I have medium to long normal hair that becomes dry because I live in the desert (of course this is mainly due to my water intake).  I only wash my hair with the shampoo every other day and use the conditioner in between days so I don&#x27;t get build up.  About once every week or two (depending on if it&#x27;s winter or summer) I use a cheap clarifying shampoo just to prevent any normal build up on my hair.  This product is excellent and doesn&#x27;t weight my hair down (shampoo or conditioner).  It goes a long way and is the best price per ounce that I have found.  The shampoo lasts me about 4 months and the conditioner about 2.5 months (but I sometimes use it when shaving my legs too!).  Smells great as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have recently noticed that this product is EVEN better when used with &amp;#34;soft water&amp;#34; but still works great with a great lather (shampoo) in hard water.</li>
    <li> loved!! the way it made my extensions feel and it smells amazing, however i didnt notice a difference on my hair</li>
    <li> I use this conditioner along with the shampoo, and it is awesome! I use about 3 pumps of the shampoo and 4 or 5 of the conditioner then leave it in for 10 minutes, and wash it out. my hair is SOOOO silky and soft when I get out of the shower, usually it is poofy and fluffy and blea, but this conditioner makes it super soft and it smells so good. it isn&#x27;t greasy at all, and I use a little bit when my hair is dry to make it extra shiny and smooth and it is great. I have very layered hair, and with other conditioners and shampoos they usually make my layers stick out and look frizzy and gross, but this smooths them all out and it makes my hair very pretty. I do a lot to my hair, from bleaching it to dying it many colors to straightening it everyday, and it keeps my hair completely manageable and nice. I highly recommend to anyone!! :D</li>
