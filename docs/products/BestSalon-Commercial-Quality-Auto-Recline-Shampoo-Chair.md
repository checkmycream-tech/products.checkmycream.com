      <li>The chair once it was put together is nice.</li>
      <li>Honest people</li>
      <li>Fits perfectly with our stainless steel sink.</li>
      <li>A place for me to retreat to, a place to do my own hair and makeup.  </li>
      <li>This chair is perfect for what I needed: a normal shampoo chair.</li>
      <li>thanks for a good product at a great price....</li>
      <li>For at home use, which is what I use this chair for...it&#x27;s good, however I would definitely not suggest anyone that is a salon owner purchase these for your shop thinking you&#x27;ve found a great deal!</li>
      <li>i got this chair about a month ago...was very happy to see a good, solid chair.  </li>
      <li>This product was exactly what I was looking for and a great value.  </li>
      <li>The price is too good to be true and it is.</li>
      <li>Very comfortable and sturdy.  </li>
      <li>The instructions are not step by step as many users are probably used to.</li>
      <li>I love my girly version of the man cave</li>
      <li>Once i got it assembled it seemed to be OK.  </li>
      <li>My wife (who it is for) would not have been able to assemble it.</li>
      <li>for the space that I have but its ok</li>
      <li>This is more than a shampoo chair, it can be used for many purposes.</li>
      <li>I will be buying more from this company.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m happy, but there&#x27;s clearly a lack of quality assurance on the manufacture&#x27;s part.</li>
      <li>can&#x27;t pick up chair without it becoming unsafe.</li>
      <li>It was easy to put together, VERY sturdy, and makes for a good hair styling chair if you don&#x27;t have one.</li>
      <li>Wobbly and will not stay reclined easily.</li>
      <li>It was really easy to put together, and will do the job.</li>
      <li>The chairs arrived very quickly and they are an affordable price.</li>
      <li>Quality construction, decent price, all around a good deal</li>
      <li>opening the box, everything looked fine.</li>
      <li>so you better have a strong person to help plus someone who can rig them to go together right.</li>
      <li>none of the pieces fit together, the holes on the arm pieces did not even fit on the screws that were already pre drilled on the product.</li>
      <li>...hope to enjoy the use for years to come.</li>
      <li>overall i am happy with my purchase and i wouldnt hesitiate to purchase another item form this seller.</li>
      <li>I had to chisel the hole to fit.</li>
      <li>Comfortable</li>
      <li>This shampoo chair is priced very well, great construction and most definitely professional.  </li>
      <li>She likes them both as the chair and bowel fit well together.</li>
      <li>This seems to fit the bill well.  </li>
      <li>so good so far ...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty happy with the chair so far.</li>
      <li>But the instructions were easy to follow and it went together quickly once I purchased the bolts.</li>
      <li>I have a small Salon and the chair is perfect!</li>
      <li>, all my friends enjoy the pampering and fun</li>
      <li>the only good thing about this chair is the cushion seat otherwise would never purchase one of these again....</li>
      <li>It was slighty challenging to put the chairs together, but they are very sturdy.</li>
      <li>Overall, I would probably spend more money on a better chair if I had to do it again.  </li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m sure many people would have sent it back and had to wait on another shipment...    </li>
      <li>works well except doesn&#x27;t lean back real easy.</li>
      <li>so I had to modify the stop so it would recline more like a normal shampoo chair.    </li>
      <li>Also it arrived very fast!</li>
      <li>Fortunately I was able to fit the  back and seat to the frame of my existing chair.</li>
      <li>thank you this was to fast and easy</li>
      <li>spend the extra money on a better chair!</li>
      <li>but once you do it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
      <li>spend the extra cash and buy it pre-made, unless your good with tools and good with dealing with missing parts and having to go buy some.</li>
      <li>I read the other reviews and figured this was a good deal.  </li>
      <li>the stop bracket for the slider under the cushion was installed in the rear end instead of the front, had to unscrew it and fasten in the right place.</li>
      <li>Deal or no deal pack the right supplies guys.</li>
      <li>, it took a lot of work to get these together, including drilling out a hole that wasn&#x27;t in the right spot.</li>
      <li>Very much the quality you would find in a salon.  </li>
      <li>Very responsible delivery</li>
      <li>Thanks for all your help!</li>
      <li>I have to make sure my clients sit their butt in the back of it and almost stretch their neck.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
      <li>its a littler complicated to  assemble it, but when you do it, is perfect to use with the shampoo station</li>
      <li>However after a couple minutes, one thing became evident....</li>
      <li>you have to recline the chair first then</li>
      <li>Wish it was a little more ajustable but works fine.</li>
      <li>I really like them, when I had a problem with a product they fixed it right away and replaced it!</li>
      <li>Luckily I had the skills and the tools to complete the assembly.</li>
      <li>Leg cross braces were not shaped correctly to allow for the bolts to be easily installed.  </li>
      <li>When I received the chair the box had a large hole in it.</li>
      <li>When I looked over the product I found a large hole in the cusion as well and when I emailed the company about it they told me they would send me the part but never offered a refund.</li>
      <li>This one will work for now I suppose, but look elsewhere unless you absolutely have to go as cheap as possible.</li>
      <li>this answers some of your concerns (as I was very apprehensive about buying this chair, but took a gamble because of Price)</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t used it on clients yet, but I&#x27;ve heard a lot of people order from this company and really like their equipment.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this chair!</li>
      <li>Very simple to use and comfortable chair.  </li>
      <li>Fast delivery.</li>
      <li>: Chair is comfortable and goes back and forward as advertised&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very responsible delivery</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed. Could use real instructions on putting it together.</li>
    <li> this was a very good pick for the price...hope to enjoy the use for years to come.</li>
    <li> After having a really bad experience from another company I thought this would be a let down also. I&#x27;m pretty happy with the chair so far. It was really easy to put together, and will do the job. I haven&#x27;t used it on clients yet, but I&#x27;ve heard a lot of people order from this company and really like their equipment.</li>
    <li> It took a little while to arrive, but it is just what I needed. As stated in other reviews ( I think), the instructions are super confusing. Other than that, it is just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> When I received this item, it was really a mess. I wrote to the company and they told me  to take pictures before I return it.  This items is very heavy and it would have cost me more to ship this item back to the company. The legs on the chair were not even, it is a very poor product.</li>
    <li> We love this chair! I have a small Salon and the chair is perfect! Fits perfectly with our stainless steel sink. Looks nice and feels good to all my clients. I&#x27;m very picky about things and I was very pleased!</li>
    <li> I really like this chair. It is firm, sturdy, and easy to assemble. This is more than a shampoo chair, it can be used for many purposes.</li>
    <li> Awful product!!!! missing pieces that I went out and purchased (company did offer to send) When trying to put chair together which took awhile and was very frustraing holes do not match up and legs are crooked and dont all sit on the floor so chair leans. Emailed company and all they offered to do was send the missing parts again which made no sense. I decided to return the chair and was told even though it is defective I had to pay for shipping it back and wouldnt be reimbursed. To ship back it cost almost as much as the chair did. So dont waste your time still trying to get shipping charges back.</li>
    <li> I recieved the product and it was damaged and missing screws n parts to assemble the chair. Ive been going back n forth with the guys from the company and the problem isn&#x27;t sloved and its been a month. The chair that does have all parts operates very poorly and cant be funtional. So.disappointed.  But thats what u get for $55 shampoo chair.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t even use it in the shop.  When clients sit down in the chair it collapses.  The metal piece is to small.  Very disappointed:(</li>
    <li> spend the extra cash and buy it pre-made, unless your good with tools and good with dealing with missing parts and having to go buy some. it also came a bit damaged. again what a nightmare. (shipping was fast though)</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo chair for my mother who has dementia.  Once I got it together, it was great.      (I also bought a hand held shower head and two shampoo aprons - one for the front and one that drapes into the tub)    We just jump the stops and lay the chair all the way back over the tub - Major problem solved!!!    My main problem with this chair is that it shipped with defective parts - missing one screw and one leg didn&#x27;t have a hole pre-drilled for assembly.  Drilling the hole wasn&#x27;t a problem for me but I&#x27;m sure many people would have sent it back and had to wait on another shipment...    I would have rated this item at 5-stars (for the price) without the Q.C. issues.</li>
    <li> The chair arrived in a timely manner, but the frame came with the incorrect horizontal stabilizing brackets.  They were 2 inches too wide for the rest of the frame. Fortunately I was able to fit the  back and seat to the frame of my existing chair. It took alittle effort and some brainstorming on my behalf, but it is functional now and I no longer have a broken shampoo chair.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo chair, great value AMAZING company with LIGHTNING FAST SHIPPING!!  Received my item in 3 days!!!</li>
    <li> It was just what I needed and for a great price.</li>
    <li> I read the other reviews and figured this was a good deal.  I suppose for 57 bucks shipped it wasn&#x27;t too bad, but the chair isn&#x27;t that great either.      First off, the instructions are useless.  Throw them out.  Secondly, the holes were not drilled straight.  I had to nearly bend the leg to get the holes to line up, this makes the chair rock since the legs aren&#x27;t level.  And finally, the chair doesn&#x27;t recline enough so I had to modify the stop so it would recline more like a normal shampoo chair.    Overall, I would probably spend more money on a better chair if I had to do it again.  This one will work for now I suppose, but look elsewhere unless you absolutely have to go as cheap as possible.</li>
    <li> This chair is very nice.  However, as is everything in this country (Made In China).  Go figure!!  In China, they must not know the difference between a washer and a nut. Thank God I had a couple in my tool box.  Deal or no deal pack the right supplies guys.</li>
    <li> Great price, good quality, NIGHTMARE to put together! The holes don&#x27;t line up well, it took a lot of work to get these together, including drilling out a hole that wasn&#x27;t in the right spot. I did finally get them together and I&#x27;m happy, but there&#x27;s clearly a lack of quality assurance on the manufacture&#x27;s part.</li>
    <li> i got this chair about a month ago...was very happy to see a good, solid chair.  it works perfectly with no client complaints...thanks for a good product at a great price....</li>
    <li> Very comfortable and sturdy.  Very much the quality you would find in a salon.  Great price too!  Highly recommend this chair!</li>
    <li> When I received the chair the box had a large hole in it. When I looked over the product I found a large hole in the cusion as well and when I emailed the company about it they told me they would send me the part but never offered a refund. They asked me for pictures which I sent and  they have not responded to me about what they are going to do to rectify this issue and the deadline for my return is in 3 days.  This is not a company I would order from again</li>
    <li> Very nice. Comfortable</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. Good product. Honest people</li>
    <li> Wish it was a little more ajustable but works fine. I little too&lt;br /&gt;big for the space that I have but its ok</li>
    <li> This chair is perfect for what I needed: a normal shampoo chair. It was easy to put together, VERY sturdy, and makes for a good hair styling chair if you don&#x27;t have one. I use this chair for both shampoo and styling when I work from home. My client&#x27;s dont mind because they can recline back a little and be comfrotable. Also it arrived very fast!</li>
    <li> works well except doesn&#x27;t lean back real easy.</li>
    <li> We really like the modern salon shampoo chair.  I purchased this for my wife along with a shampoo bowel  She likes them both as the chair and bowel fit well together.</li>
    <li> I ordered this auto recline chair 2months ago...its not what it claims at all...the chair cannot be reclined while client is sitting in the chair...you have to recline the chair first then have client sit and lean back,which is very inconvenient.....the only good thing about this chair is the cushion seat otherwise would never purchase one of these again....also seems like once a week a screw falls out the chair.</li>
    <li> The seat slides back by itself</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s sturdy but the assembly was a pain in the butt</li>
    <li> thank you this was to fast and easy i&#x27;m verry happy with my chair and shampoo bowl thank you so much</li>
    <li> Parts do not line up causing chair to not work properly so we have to buy hardware to fix.</li>
    <li> This product was exactly what I was looking for and a great value.  I will be buying more from this company.</li>
    <li> Great chair but like other reviews it was missing bolts that I had to go buy. But the instructions were easy to follow and it went together quickly once I purchased the bolts.</li>
    <li> As good an item as the beauty supply places and I paid 1/3 the price! It is great!</li>
    <li> I really like them, when I had a problem with a product they fixed it right away and replaced it! Also they ship really fast.. I would definitely recommended them to anyone!!! Thanks for all your help!</li>
    <li> There have been mixed reviews on this chair. I&#x27;ve attached pictures for future buyers to alleviate questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon opening the box, everything looked fine. All the pieces were there and instructions. However after a couple minutes, one thing became evident....this chair HAS to be modified. This is not an IKEA piece of furniture. The instructions are not step by step as many users are probably used to. If you have a DIY background, this chair can be a great buy. Here is a list of things I had to do:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Slot the holes in the leg braces (Need drill press )&lt;br /&gt;2. Realign the hinge connecting the back to the seat (Need level + screwdriver)&lt;br /&gt;3. Change nuts from acorn style nuts to a standard lock nut. The acorn are chosen for a clean look but honestly a waste of effort to try and use them (I would recommend nylocks)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary:&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re frugal DIY kind of person buy it, otherwise buyers BEWARE!</li>
    <li> BestSalon Commercial Quality Auto Recline Shampoo Chair&lt;br /&gt;Did not like this product, I traded it in for a better one!</li>
    <li> its a littler complicated to  assemble it, but when you do it, is perfect to use with the shampoo station</li>
    <li> The chair once it was put together is nice. It was a bitch to get it put together tho, it definately takes two people and some muscle</li>
    <li> This chair is uncomfortably tall. I have to make sure my clients sit their butt in the back of it and almost stretch their neck. I also have a footstool for their feet because its just so tall. and I am 5&#x27;9</li>
    <li> Chairs were poor quality. A waist of money. The legs did not fit on the chair properly. Not recommended.</li>
    <li> This came with missing screws but we had some to make it work. I didn&#x27;t try contacting anyone because I just needed to get my shop open. I would spend a little more and get one that&#x27;s a little better quality then this.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t lean back far enough to the shampoo bowl they have to practical sit up during the shampoo service.</li>
    <li> These chairs have to be rigged to make it work.  They suck to put together so you better have a strong person to help plus someone who can rig them to go together right.</li>
    <li> my first review of this chair was that it was uncomfortable. but after using it for a month the chair has been \\&quot;broken in\\&quot; and comfort is not an issue now. The chairs arrived very quickly and they are an affordable price. It was slighty challenging to put the chairs together, but they are very sturdy. overall i am happy with my purchase and i wouldnt hesitiate to purchase another item form this seller.</li>
    <li> Like the other reviews, this chair didn&#x27;t contain the supplies listed. Obviously, the company packing the chair wasn&#x27;t familiar with English. Nuts weren&#x27;t there and washers weren&#x27;t either.  At one point nuts are refered to as washers.  The holes didn&#x27;t remotely line up and weren&#x27;t cut large enough for the screws to fit.  I had to chisel the hole to fit. The screws aren&#x27;t long enough to support the weight of a person sitting in the chair.  Of course, it&#x27;s not worth sending it back (I think that is point the company was counting on) I&#x27;m just mad at myself for buying it.  The price is too good to be true and it is.</li>
    <li> This was my replacement chair, the worker said that it is to tall, back to long.&lt;br /&gt;The chairs that I ordered in the past was already assemblied.</li>
    <li> The cushions look firm and well done but the front and back stretcher of the chair were bent past the right angle making imposible to use the bolts included with it and had to buy longer ones in order to put it together, the stop bracket for the slider under the cushion was installed in the rear end instead of the front, had to unscrew it and fasten in the right place. There is no way this chair could be put together with the instructions and hardware provided.</li>
    <li> I normaly don&#x27;t write reviews, but this product deserves a bad one!!!  Don&#x27;t make the same mistake we did!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bolts are too short.  Holes don&#x27;t line up.  Brackets aren&#x27;t bent correctly.  Assembling this chair should have taken 5 minutes, but it took over an hour and a lot of elbow grease.  Once assembled it does work, but the legs aren&#x27;t level and it doesn&#x27;t recline far enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor and choose another chair!</li>
    <li> i spent hours trying to put this chair together. What should have been a few simple pieces put together with a few screws ended up being nothing simple at all!! none of the pieces fit together, the holes on the arm pieces did not even fit on the screws that were already pre drilled on the product. And directions ? what directions! No help! spend the extra money on a better chair!</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t pick up chair without it becoming unsafe. Small hook on the bottom insuffiecent. I am forced to buy another chair.</li>
    <li> Simple to mount, reclines with body position and lightweight. Had a minor issue with one of the mounting bolts as the alignment of the holes to attach one of the leg braces was a bit off and needed to be forced in with some assistance. Other than that, the item is sturdy and comfortable for the client.</li>
    <li> Very simple to use and comfortable chair.  It&#x27;s a little be hard to put together but once you do it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
    <li> Like a lot of the others who bought this chair, I too had to make some adjustments! My screws that came with this chair to attatch the supports to the front and back of the chair were WAY too short! I replaced all 8 screws with longer ones to get the chair together. Overall for the price it&#x27;s sturdy once you get it together. Someone wrote that their legs on their chair was uneven...same here it rocks a little because the legs were not made evenly. For at home use, which is what I use this chair for...it&#x27;s good, however I would definitely not suggest anyone that is a salon owner purchase these for your shop thinking you&#x27;ve found a great deal!</li>
    <li> I am returning my chair beacuse it was damaged I&#x27;m guessing in route here but the company is working with me on getting it worked out....so good so far ...</li>
    <li> The product required simple assembly but none of the parts fit.  I had to redrill holes in the side legs, the legs did not fit properly to the main part of the chair, the fastening bolts were too short,  there were extra cap nuts that did not belong to this chair.  Once i got it assembled it seemed to be OK.  Luckily I had the skills and the tools to complete the assembly.</li>
    <li> Starting a home salon on a tight budget.  This seems to fit the bill well.  Quality construction, decent price, all around a good deal</li>
    <li> Poor Instructions.  Leg cross braces were not shaped correctly to allow for the bolts to be easily installed.  Had to use pliers/clamps to press the metal in so that the bolts could be tightened.  The guide on the bottom of the chair that allows the person sitting on the chair to lean back was installed on the back/bottom of the chair, but should have been on the front bottom.  My wife (who it is for) would not have been able to assemble it.</li>
    <li> Great for my at home salon , very good quality easy to assemble, I&#x27;d definatly recommend it to a friend</li>
    <li> Instructions didnt even go with the product..wrong size screws,  crooked bars. Had to go buy my own screws, missing some&amp;too short. Ridiculous. Extremely heavy. Completely dissatisfied.</li>
    <li> So after much searching, we bought this chair based on the fact, it was the cheapest by far.  We went through all of the reviews and were a little nervous about buying it, so below is my experience&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRO: Product in box was not damaged when delivered (Note: We used a different seller to buy this one, so experience may alter based on seller&lt;br /&gt;PRO: Chair is comfortable and goes back and forward as advertised&lt;br /&gt;PRO: My wife is happy and doesn&#x27;t even realise that I had the challenges listed in the CONS section.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CON: The instructions were terrible and all the parts in the instructions were not there in the actual box.  However, the part that was missing were washers, that I don&#x27;t really believe were necessary, so I built it without the washers described.  Works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CON: While I could get the bolt through the holes to connect two of the parts, I couldn&#x27;t get the nut on (as there wasn&#x27;t enough of the bolt hanging out for the nut to latch on).  I went to Home Depot that night and bought a two screws and nuts that resolved the problem perfectly. This cost me about $1 extra (a little more than normal b/c I had to buy Metric Bolts and Nut as opposed to Imperial), but overall it was a lot cheaper to buy this chair than something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definately buy this chair again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this answers some of your concerns (as I was very apprehensive about buying this chair, but took a gamble because of Price)</li>
    <li> I have been a hairdresser for 28 years, and I have always wanted to setup an area just for me, in my home.  A place for me to retreat to, a place to do my own hair and makeup.  This shampoo chair is priced very well, great construction and most definitely professional.  I love my girly version of the man cave, all my friends enjoy the pampering and fun we have when we just experiment.  A grown up pj party!!!</li>
    <li> Terrible.  Screws came loose in the box.  Not even in a little bag.</li>
    <li> Th legs are uneven had to put something under but other than that it&#x27;s nice</li>
    <li> The screws are too short due to the poor quality in shaping the legs. Other than that it works fine.</li>
    <li> Works well does what it is supposed to do</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like this chair at all. Wobbly and will not stay reclined easily. Because of the force needed in order to recline, the chair will not stay in position, it slides.I need another salon chair but will never order this one again</li>
