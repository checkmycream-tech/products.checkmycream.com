      <li>Excellent product that makes your skin look fresh and reduces the appearance of fine lines.  </li>
      <li>I found it to be the best solution to my characteristically sensitive and oily skin.</li>
      <li>The newer version is also excellent but is more creamy white.</li>
      <li>I tried so many brands, nothing is like this one.</li>
      <li>It is pretty amazing!</li>
      <li>I am sure I reviewed this product already...</li>
      <li>they love it too.</li>
      <li>fast shipping and a great product.</li>
      <li>I love the way it feels going on</li>
      <li>and  creates a more youthful appearance in my opinion.  </li>
      <li>The skin becomes more smooth.</li>
      <li>I use about 1 pearl-sized bead, just a little more at night or during the winter, and this seems to be perfect</li>
      <li>This gel spreads smoothly over my skin.</li>
      <li>The effect is instant and great.</li>
      <li>Although I have to use pills for the hormonal breakout e treating it from the inside out, this stuff is great for the regular bumps and unevenness/appearance of my skin.  </li>
      <li>The scent is very clean and fresh as well.</li>
      <li>I really wanted to like it because my skin felt really good at first.</li>
      <li>I love it so much!</li>
      <li>but you will get to like it, simple, good level of moisture.</li>
      <li>The texture of the product is really interesting, a very soft and smooth clear/whitish gel.</li>
      <li>I have been using the samples of Aqua-collagen-gel, super moisture for morning, and enrich-lift-ex for night, for two weeks.</li>
      <li>I discovered Aqua-Collagen Gel Super Moisture a week ago.</li>
      <li>Well worth the money.</li>
      <li>This is well worth the money.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m impressed by the cost of the skin care product, it really moist and last whole day long, and it includes one important ingredient: Collagen.</li>
      <li>This single product cares for my dry skin perfectly.</li>
      <li>Labo&#x27;s gel really is like nothing I&#x27;ve tried before -- it goes on very light and smooth and my skin can actually breathe when I put it on.  </li>
      <li>I tried this item first when I got it as sample gift that came along with my order of Aqua Derm Essence.  </li>
      <li>RESULTS so fast!</li>
      <li>I first used it, I found it to be really hydrating yet not greasy.</li>
      <li>Your face will have a full of trouble for sure.</li>
      <li>After looking on Amazon, I bought her this for her birthday and after two weeks she still thanks me.</li>
      <li>I love how it sinks into my skin.</li>
      <li>i absolutely like it.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone, regardless of skin type!</li>
      <li>I am on my 4th jar, which says a lot, because I VERY rarely use the same moisturizer twice.</li>
      <li>My skin is a lot less oily, actually looks supple and bright, and even my mother, who has carefully avoided talking about my breakouts since I was a teenager, remarked one day that my face has cleared up and looks a lot better.      </li>
      <li>It reduced or removed fine wrinkle completely after short time.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve also tried the one with aloe but doesn&#x27;t seem to be any different than the super moisture.</li>
      <li>but now my whole skin is very soft and moisturized.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend and think you will agree it works well</li>
      <li>I was not sure it was good enough just using one product.</li>
      <li>have very sensitive skin and used to  use Estee Lauder verite moisturizer until I found this.</li>
      <li>Put it all over my face and woke up to find my skin feeling VERY soft but NOT greasy at all.</li>
      <li>It absorbs right into your skin and keeps it feeling soft n moist all day long.</li>
      <li>So I&#x27;ve been using this cream for many years and its the only face cream that doesnt make me break out or grow little dots on my skin.</li>
      <li>It feels even lighter on the skin, moisturizes evenly, and, I noticed a considerable lessening of wrinkles after overnight application.</li>
      <li>i am 59 years old</li>
      <li>With this face cream a little goes a long way and it is absorbed in to your skin quickly.   </li>
      <li>+, the enrich-lift-ex with a little bit thick texture seems better working than super moisture.</li>
      <li>Its a little more expensive but you get more.</li>
      <li>My skin is combination skin in which get very oily during the Summer time and very dry U-zone during winter  </li>
      <li>A little sticky at first</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> if this is just collagen gel, why do you not buy it from amerimark at about $6.00 an ounce?  isn&#x27;t collagen, collagen?</li>
    <li> I love it so much! This single product cares for my dry skin perfectly. This gel spreads smoothly over my skin. Even if I only put a small amount, in morning, my face is still moisturized. I am extremely satisfied with this product, and I plan to keep using this!</li>
    <li> Its effect is dramatic. It reduced or removed fine wrinkle completely after short time. I tried so many brands, nothing is like this one. I definitely will stick to this one from now on.</li>
    <li> I am sure I reviewed this product already... but since it was my second time purchasing this through Amazon.. why not?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin and used to  use Estee Lauder verite moisturizer until I found this. Its a little more expensive but you get more. Its a bit sticky but you just use a small amount and it dries in a few minutes.</li>
    <li> within a few days, I started breaking out with little white bumps all over my forehead and chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first used it, I found it to be really hydrating yet not greasy. I really wanted to like it because my skin felt really good at first. but then when the little bumps started showing up, i started getting worried. i kept using it for another week, hoping that my skin would get used to it, but it never did. so i stopped and teh bumps disappeared within 2 days.</li>
    <li> I just used it last night before I went to bed. Put it all over my face and woke up to find my skin feeling VERY soft but NOT greasy at all. I never had a mositurizer that made my cheeks feel \\&quot;plump\\&quot; and \\&quot;supple\\&quot; before.    The texture of the product is really interesting, a very soft and smooth clear/whitish gel. I love how it sinks into my skin. I had dry spots around my eyes but now my whole skin is very soft and moisturized. The scent is very clean and fresh as well. I love this!</li>
    <li> I bought this at Epcot&#x27;s Japan - Disneyworld Florida.  I have always had acne prone skin, small bumps, and hormonal breakouts.  I didn&#x27;t know anything about it, just thot I&#x27;d try it.  The next morning I looked in the hotel mirror, and could not believe the difference in my skintone.  RESULTS so fast! Although I have to use pills for the hormonal breakout e treating it from the inside out, this stuff is great for the regular bumps and unevenness/appearance of my skin.  I&#x27;ve been buying it for 2 yrs now.</li>
    <li> I heard this product from my friend. I was not sure it was good enough just using one product. After I used a month, I am very happy with this product. I do not feel dry on my skin all day long just using this product in the morning. It is pretty amazing!</li>
    <li> i started to use this product about 3 years ago.  it works as it proclaimed. i am 59 years old but people guess my age 30 somthing. i recommend it to my church friends.  they love it too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m impressed by the cost of the skin care product, it really moist and last whole day long, and it includes one important ingredient: Collagen.</li>
    <li> A year ago I started using Dr. Ci:Labo Aqua-Collagen-Gel. My dermotologist friend was raving about it. I found it to be the best solution to my characteristically sensitive and oily skin. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product. But I was wrong! I discovered Aqua-Collagen Gel Super Moisture a week ago. It feels even lighter on the skin, moisturizes evenly, and, I noticed a considerable lessening of wrinkles after overnight application. I highly recommend this product to anyone, regardless of skin type!</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;ve been using this cream for many years and its the only face cream that doesnt make me break out or grow little dots on my skin.It absorbs right into your skin and keeps it feeling soft n moist all day long. I was so stressed because I recently ran out and my nearby stores stopped selling the product...but thank goodness I found some on Amazon. I&#x27;ve also tried the one with aloe but doesn&#x27;t seem to be any different than the super moisture.</li>
    <li> I swear by this.  I have had dull, acne-prone, oily skin that&#x27;s taken years of beating from the New England winters.  Most moisturizers I&#x27;ve tried were sticky and heavy and made me have bad breakouts. Dr.Ci:Labo&#x27;s gel really is like nothing I&#x27;ve tried before -- it goes on very light and smooth and my skin can actually breathe when I put it on.  I use this under makeup too.  My skin is a lot less oily, actually looks supple and bright, and even my mother, who has carefully avoided talking about my breakouts since I was a teenager, remarked one day that my face has cleared up and looks a lot better.      The directions say to use 2 pearl-sized beads in the morning and a cherry-sized ball in the evening, but this is excessive for my oily skin.  I use about 1 pearl-sized bead, just a little more at night or during the winter, and this seems to be perfect -- I press it into my face with my fingertips, and my skin just drinks it up.  This 4oz jar lasts me 3-4 months.    They have the \\&quot;regular\\&quot; Aqua-Collagen Gel, and then this \\&quot;Super\\&quot; Aqua-Collagen Gel.  I don&#x27;t know what the difference is, but since the gel is expensive anyway, I decided to cough up the little extra for the Super at my first purchase. I have done so ever since -- I&#x27;ve purchased this moisturizer over and over.  This is well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Terrible product. you can&#x27;t even say it&#x27;s a skincare. Your face will have a full of trouble for sure. Guarantee!!! I contacted their head office in japan, but horrible customer service and ungenerous treatment were given instead of any advises. I saw their official website. They are out of business. Don&#x27;t trust. This product is just watery glue.Nothing to do with your skin.</li>
    <li> You have to try this product....I love the way it feels going on and I never feel greasy. I have oily problem skin and have not had any problems. I am on my 4th jar, which says a lot, because I VERY rarely use the same moisturizer twice. If not sure try the mini size first. Seriuously this is a must try product !!!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent product that makes your skin look fresh and reduces the appearance of fine lines.  Excellent after shave product for men.  With this face cream a little goes a long way and it is absorbed in to your skin quickly.   I highly recommend and think you will agree it works well and  creates a more youthful appearance in my opinion.  I like the original formula best as it is opaque.  The newer version is also excellent but is more creamy white.</li>
    <li> I found this product in 2006 at the Airport in Tokyo. Then I never saw this again anywhere in the market. Lately I have found they have stores now in HK and Taiwan. I ordered this when I was back in LA and I can tell you if you have never try it, it&#x27;s a nice product for the person on the go. A little sticky at first but you will get to like it, simple, good level of moisture. I have given this to my mom and my sisters and they say they will buy this again.</li>
    <li> I have been using the samples of Aqua-collagen-gel, super moisture for morning, and enrich-lift-ex for night, for two weeks. The effect is instant and great. Even with a pearl-size each time, my dry skin is fully hydrated and nurished. The pores become smaller. The skin becomes more smooth. As I am over 30+, the enrich-lift-ex with a little bit thick texture seems better working than super moisture. Anyway, both products are great.Though the product is a little pricy, but I cannot find any other product with same effect and lower cost.</li>
    <li> I tried this item first when I got it as sample gift that came along with my order of Aqua Derm Essence.  My skin is combination skin in which get very oily during the Summer time and very dry U-zone during winter  I started getting breakouts with L&#x27;occitane brand and getting flacky skin due to harsh winter weather.    So I started using this product and voila my skin was back to normal with balaced moisture and no more flaky skin.    I think this product forms the barrier agains the dry and cold air to keep the moisture balanced. so after finishing this sample contatiner I ordered the big one.  My husband also uses it because it has no \\&quot;feminie\\&quot; scent to it and men&#x27;s skin care was not giving him enough moisture.  Also bought one for my mother to try it.</li>
    <li> My wife has always had extremely dry skin in the winter. After looking on Amazon, I bought her this for her birthday and after two weeks she still thanks me. Her review: \\&quot;It&#x27;s fabulous!\\&quot; Dry skin issues are gone and I can reclaim counter space since this is all she needs. Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> i absolutely like it.</li>
    <li> fast shipping and a great product. i&#x27;m v.v. happy! i would recommend to all types of skin. it helps my skin from dryness.</li>
