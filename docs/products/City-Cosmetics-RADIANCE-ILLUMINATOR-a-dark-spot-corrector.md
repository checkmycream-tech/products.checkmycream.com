      <li>Thank you City Cosmetics for all your wonderful products you&#x27;ve formulated from long lashes to beautiful skin to softer and plumper lips.</li>
      <li>The serum has a nice floral scent.</li>
      <li>I purchased this product after reading a very impressive review in First Magazine rating it one of the top three melanin spot lighteners that do not use hydraquinone  </li>
      <li>It did smell good and goes on easily.</li>
      <li>I have tried on my own skin many spot correcting products, as this has always been a problem for me.</li>
      <li>My shiny bald head looks so good, that it makes people with full heads of hair jealous.</li>
      <li>She is a Latina woman with a very light  brown skin tone.</li>
      <li>but if it gets very light like it looks like it will,  </li>
      <li>This was so easy to use and the results were amazing.</li>
      <li>I have been using it every day and the results are better than I could have imagined.</li>
      <li>I am in my 60s, and I feel better about my skin now.</li>
      <li>I think this is the ideal product for anyone who does not like to tan or appreciates their natural skin color.</li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m glad I kept on using it.</li>
      <li>I never had the acne problems that most of my friends and even some of my siblings had when we were growing up.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t wait to see what it can do with more time.</li>
      <li>Like anything worthwhile  follow the directions</li>
      <li>Scars are fading and I am beginning to be more confident.</li>
      <li>We didn&#x27;t buy here because we found a better price elsewhere.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve decided to embrace my spots and declare them to be cute.</li>
      <li>I demanded my wife buy more</li>
      <li>I am three months into using this now and I am definitely pleased.</li>
      <li>He started smiling again and was hanging out with friends more.</li>
      <li>I bought 4 containers of this and used it as directed for more than a month.</li>
      <li>With the three weeks use of Radiance Illuminator I am seeing it lighten more every week.</li>
      <li>I have been a freelance makeup artist for many years, and clients often come to me with pigmentation issues.</li>
      <li>We weren&#x27;t sure if this product was going to work, but it was a budget-friendly alternative compared to going to a dermatologist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>none of these have pleased me.</li>
      <li>Maybe it would have helped if I&#x27;d had more product</li>
      <li>How dare they be able to charge this price for .5 oz.</li>
      <li>this is BETTER and patience  </li>
      <li>I will give it some more time.  </li>
      <li>and I love it</li>
      <li>I love this however</li>
      <li>He told me they were nothing to worry about -- &amp;#34;just age spots.&amp;#34; He also told me I could probably expect to get more of them.</li>
      <li>Works like magic.</li>
      <li>Used this product as directed and it created more brown spots.  </li>
      <li>Now I have twice as many as before.  </li>
      <li>I love love LOVE this product.</li>
      <li>It does a great job treating hyper-pigmentation and I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>My skin is now becoming smoother, and more radiant as it goes.</li>
      <li>I will try another product that is more reasonably priced and had good reviews.</li>
      <li>I like this product because it is easy to use, not visible on my skin, and because it works!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I liked the product very much.  </li>
      <li>It has also reduced fine lines.  </li>
      <li>I was a huge skeptic, but after trying a sample of hers for a week, I started to see</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a REALLY tiny bottle and although the product is great, I wish it would be a tad cheaper.</li>
      <li>This had such a great review when I researched this product.</li>
      <li>While it is easy for me to teach them how to cover them up, my preference is for them to be able to clear it up more permanently.</li>
      <li>This is my new favorite must-have beauty product!</li>
      <li>Full correction will take more time depending on how much darker your spots are than your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>-twice a day on the spots use a qtip or your  pinky  - put it on a  super clean  face .  </li>
      <li>and I love it so much that I bought another one.</li>
      <li>I am pleased to say that this is the real deal.</li>
      <li>How cool is that?</li>
      <li>As a Licensed Esthetician I make it a point to try as many products as possible to stay informed and up on the latest and products.</li>
      <li>I have been blessed with pretty smooth skin all my life.</li>
      <li>With the amount of freckles and sun damage to my skin I can see a great improvement in the dark spots on my skin.</li>
      <li>I am confident being bare faced and free.</li>
      <li>They take first place in the &amp;#34;Hall of &amp;#34;Shame&amp;#34; !</li>
      <li>It works great just takes a few weeks</li>
      <li>It is a nice, light moisturizer but had absolutely no lightening effect on the sun damage on my face and neck skin or on the age spots on my husband&#x27;s face.</li>
      <li>This product is definitely worth using.</li>
      <li>but I feel it was worth the results.</li>
      <li>My age spots became a problem pretty quickly.</li>
      <li>It ended right below the CITY COSMETICS LINE.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s hard to feel beautiful when you think everyone is staring at your scars instead of you.</li>
      <li>She has used many with varying degrees of success - this one is working a little better than some others.  </li>
      <li>My pigment looks more even and the fine lines around my mouth and eyes are harder to see.</li>
      <li>I have a spot on my left temple and the other one on my right check, they became lighter, which is a good thing, I will continue another week since the ingredients are safe.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve enjoyed using this product; it is easy to use and does not make a mess.</li>
      <li>Shop online first.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> did not have the results that i expected</li>
    <li> This product does lighten sun spots but it takes awhile so don&#x27;t get discouraged</li>
    <li> This product is actually pretty great!</li>
    <li> Did not see any change in spot appearance. Total waste of money!</li>
    <li> has not done a thing and I paid 80.00 :(</li>
    <li> So far it is a two star. I am 3 weeks into to it, and my facial spots are not  much lighter at all. I don&#x27;t see a change yet. Hopefully soon. This had such a great review when I researched this product. I will give it some more time.  HM Jenson</li>
    <li> It works great just takes a few weeks and they are fading  love it!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Bought this directly from the company web site, it does not work at all. I saw no difference in color on dark areas on my skin. What a waste of money! I wish I could get refund, save your money and buy something else.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t give me any good impression at all.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed in my results.  It really did not lighten the dark spots on my hands at all.  Maybe mine is just a tough case.</li>
    <li> The dark spots seem to be going away. Or fading some what. The product does not cause irritation or redness, not greasy,</li>
    <li> It hasn&#x27;t done what I expected it to do yet and I&#x27;ve been using it for almost 2 months.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like the container. It&#x27;s hard to control the flow and sometimes delivers a watery product instead of creamy.</li>
    <li> I like this product because it is easy to use, not visible on my skin, and because it works!&lt;br /&gt;I am using this product only about one month. The dark spot on my face which I have about 25 years (!) bcame not very dark and I think in the future will be gone!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you City Cosmetics and good lack to you!</li>
    <li> Whaaat a great product! It brings a glow to my skin as soon as I apply it. I have been using it every day and the results are better than I could have imagined. Another amazing find within City Cosmetics.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried this product yet, but once my face clears up from feeling so dry, I will try it.  I doubt I will be disappointed and I hope it does all it claims to do.</li>
    <li> Used as recommended. I am not sure it really worked to improve my dark spots.&lt;br /&gt;Worth a try. Shop online first. I could have gotten 2 for the price of one.</li>
    <li> I used the entire bottle and didn&#x27;t notice any difference in the appearance of my skin. The brown spots were still there as they were when I started. It was also very expensive, which leads to greater disappointment. I&#x27;ve tried other brands as well, and so far, I&#x27;m coming to the conclusion that a sunscreen to prevent further spots, and treatment by a doctor is probably the only way to reduce age spots.</li>
    <li> no stars DID NOTHING  TINY TINY  BOTTLE  WASTE of MONEY</li>
    <li> I have been using this for the past two weeks and I can already tell the difference on some of my spots.  They are definitely lighter. Does not leave my skin feeling oily or gross.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because consumer reports listed it as #1 dark spot lightener.  I will lighten spots on your face but will not do anything for spots on hands, chest or legs.  Due to the price and results, I would not order again.</li>
    <li> The first thing I noticed about this product was the price. It is a large number, but after reading numerous reviews about it, I decided to indulge. And boy, am I glad that I did! You really get your money&#x27;s worth with this one. I have been using it for a couple weeks and I will definitely be investing in more of these little miracles! It has worked on everything: dark spots, acne scars, age spots, fine lines.</li>
    <li> I was one of the lucky women who developed dark spots on my once clear complexion during pregnancy. In addition to these, I have spent most of my life in the sun and did not pay attention to the importance of wearing sunscreen until recently. A friend recommended City Radiance Dark Spot Corrector to help eliminate the wear and tear on my face. It has only been a couple of weeks since I have started using the serum on a daily basis, and I already can notice the difference in my skin tone and even in the texture. My pigment looks more even and the fine lines around my mouth and eyes are harder to see. I can&#x27;t wait to see what it can do with more time. It is also a great value compared to what you can get from the dermatologist.</li>
    <li> I wanted something that would get rid of the dark spots on my hands. This cream has definitely lightened them. I am still using it and hope for complete results.</li>
    <li> Obsessed with this product. It cleared away all my dark spots! My skin looks so much more even and bright. It&#x27;s my one splurge I can&#x27;t live without at this point!</li>
    <li> I am 81 years old, I used this dark spot corrector twice a day for about a week, for my face only. I have a spot on my left temple and the other one on my right check, they became lighter, which is a good thing, I will continue another week since the ingredients are safe. Later  I will attack my hands where I have few spots and also a couple of spots on my legs. I am very white skin. when I was younger, I used to be prone to sun burns with blister and temperature when laying in the sun at the beach of Berk plage in the Atlantic ocean in France. I do not lay in the sun any longer. I do not remember how I got this product, my daughter must have purchased it for me. I would give this product three stars for now. Helene</li>
    <li> I liked the product very much.  Very expensive for the amount of product one receives.  Couldn&#x27;t continue using at the price.</li>
    <li> dispensor did not dispense. I would like to try another bottle but was not given that option.. send me another bottle.</li>
    <li> I have been using the product as directed for at least  two weeks and have not seen my dark spots lighten.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think this worked at all, and I consider this to be fruadulent in the amount.  Afrer mine ran out, I put a toothpick in to find the bottom of container.  It ended right below the CITY COSMETICS LINE. Nothing below, so it was more than 1/2 empty.  Don&#x27;t buy!</li>
    <li> Where do I begin....this stuff simply does not work.  It reminds me of snake oil advertisements....limp dick correction; taller or skinnier by taking two a day, et. al.  If anything my dark spots are larger as a result of this stuff.  Buyer Beware!</li>
    <li> The biggest waste of money in a long, long time. This product comes in a bottle that you have to shake vigorously to get even a drop out, a terrible design. And the product doesn&#x27;t work at all. The contents measure little less than a teaspoon and worthless.</li>
    <li> Used this product as directed and it created more brown spots.  Now I have twice as many as before.  I am getting a burning sensation all over my face.  Tried to contact Citi Cosmetics on their site but when I bring up their page and try to search, my Norton Security advises me to close the page as it is unsafe to navigate.  Amazon should remove this company from it&#x27;s site.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my wife. She has some dark spots on her arms from being out in the sun all day while training for marathons. We weren&#x27;t sure if this product was going to work, but it was a budget-friendly alternative compared to going to a dermatologist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She followed the directions carefully on the small bottle and after a couple of weeks the results started to show. It works! I would recommend this to others because I saw the positive transformation myself. Just don&#x27;t forget to apply it diligently.</li>
    <li> As a Licensed Esthetician I make it a point to try as many products as possible to stay informed and up on the latest and products. I can then personally get a first hand experience of what I feel comfortable recommending to my clients. I have tried on my own skin many spot correcting products, as this has always been a problem for me. I used hydroquinone for years and seemed to get nothing but irritated skin, and it didn&#x27;t even work. I have tried many other products to help rid my spots and needless to say, they did not work either. Radiance Illuminator by City Cosmetics and been a God sent. Not only did this help lighten my dark spots, I&#x27;ve received many compliments on my glowing skin. Thank you City Cosmetics for all your wonderful products you&#x27;ve formulated from long lashes to beautiful skin to softer and plumper lips. Love it, Love it all!! Thank you City Cosmetics!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 3 weeks. I have a large brown spot below my neck caused from all those years in the sun. I have gone to dermatologists and med spas and all have claimed that they can try and lighten it but nothing will take it totally away. Plus they would charge big $$$$ just to get it lightened with no guarantee. I have used Clinique and other OTC products and none have shown any improvement in the spot. With the three weeks use of Radiance Illuminator I am seeing it lighten more every week. I don&#x27;t expect it will totally disappear but if it gets very light like it looks like it will,  I will be very happy!</li>
    <li> Yes, this is a total scam. Used twice a day on several light sun spots on face and not a inkling of change after several weeks . How dare they be able to charge this price for .5 oz. which is nothing more than a basic cream. They take first place in the &amp;#34;Hall of &amp;#34;Shame&amp;#34; !</li>
    <li> Honestly, I thought that getting older meant less acne. Since I am wrong about that, I am happy that this product helps correct certain spots on my skin. Primarily, I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin looks less red now. The other day I even took a picture without needing to edit and face blemishes! How cool is that? I&#x27;ve told my friends about this product and I will definitely be a repeat customer.</li>
    <li> Most of the reviews I read were very positive, maybe there should be an age limit factored into this product at some level.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen very little results, like none!</li>
    <li> I have been blessed with pretty smooth skin all my life. I never had the acne problems that most of my friends and even some of my siblings had when we were growing up. Still as I get older I find my skin getting a lot looser and spotted than I would expect since I&#x27;m only 39. At one point I even resorted to using a small amount of my wife&#x27;s makeup to cover up these awful uneven dark spots but as a guy I could only stomach that for so long. Finally one day when I was watching Tv my wife called me into our bedroom and said &amp;#34;look babe its here...try this for you skin.&amp;#34; It was City Radience Dark Spot Corrector. This is one case where saying I was skeptical would be a gross understatement. I&#x27;m very wary of products that claim to specifically do one thing but like I said I was so desperate that I was wearing cover-all makeup so I had nothing to lose really. After about 2 weeks of using I was pleasantly surprised by how freakin even my skin had become. I demanded my wife buy more and we both have been using it ever since. It&#x27;s sort of on the pricey side at $80 a pop but I feel it was worth the results.</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 bottles of this and I am very disappointed.  The first bottle only lasted a little over 2 weeks and I didn&#x27;t see any difference at all,  I only had a couple of spots on my face and on my hands, the directions said to apply morning and night which I did and I used it very sparingly knowing it was a small bottle.  I couldn&#x27;t tell you if it works in the long term because it is way too expensive for me to continue to use it. I thought I read that it would last 3 months,  if you only had one tiny spot it wouldn&#x27;t last.  Sorry to say the second bottle is being returned.</li>
    <li> After trying numerous dark spot correcting cosmetics I found this product works best.&lt;br /&gt;Expensive for the amount of product in this small bottle,however, I have found it has made a very satisfying difference in my total complexion .&lt;br /&gt;I recomend this product to anyone seeking to improve their facial appearance from sun damage and age.&lt;br /&gt;Oconee Shopper&lt;br /&gt;Greensboro, GA.</li>
    <li> I bought this several months ago, use it on a weekly basis and I still have enough in the bottle. This stuff doesn&#x27;t make me breakout and makes my skin glow. I have a very busy schedule and I can’t get enough sleep and because of if I have under eye dark circles and this product even helps my dark circles. I look fresh thanks to City cosmetics</li>
    <li> This product did get rid of some of my dark spots but they were not gone all the way and I still have remaining dark spots and hyper pigmentation . I would only recommend this product to someone who has minimal dark spots.</li>
    <li> totally worthless, been using for 4 months on 2 spots and see zero difference, very very expensive, what a complete rip-off</li>
    <li> I recommend this product for anyone hoping to reduce the signs of aging, remove dark spots and blemishes overall. After days of use you will notice a change in complexion and an overall lighter tone of the skin. My skin does not seem to pigment as much after using the product, and it seems to have reversed some of the skin damage caused by the sun. I&#x27;ve enjoyed using this product; it is easy to use and does not make a mess. In fact, application was simple and I noticed a difference in several days. I think this is the ideal product for anyone who does not like to tan or appreciates their natural skin color.</li>
    <li> I have been using the product twice a day for about 4 weeks. After applying it I wait a few moments to add a little moisturizer on top of it. I find that it absorbs into my skin quite well. My skin is now becoming smoother, and more radiant as it goes. With the amount of freckles and sun damage to my skin I can see a great improvement in the dark spots on my skin. It has also reduced fine lines.  I am in my 60s, and I feel better about my skin now. I have always hated pictures, and now I find that after using this product that I love getting in pictures, and not so scared to show off my skin. I give this product 2 thumbs up.</li>
    <li> Used this product on dark spots on my forehead and hands day and night for six weeks with little or no change. Too expensive to not work!  A big waste of money!</li>
    <li> When summer arrives I&#x27;m always doing some sort of outside activity, whether its gardening or lounging in the pool and that has given me several dark spots on my chest. I&#x27;ve tried many dark spot correcting cosmetics and I haven’t found any products that work. Although Radiance Illuminator has made my skin smoother and brighter, but there hasn’t been any change to my dark spots. I don&#x27;t think that I would buy this product again because it is way to expensive for the amount that you get. Sorry, I&#x27;m not recommending this product at this point unless they increase the amount and lower their price a bit.</li>
    <li> I have tried to send this product back with no success  it has not helped at all if anything it made it worse</li>
    <li> With my girlfriend working late nights, she started to develop dark spots especially under her eyes and I bought her the City Radience Dark Spot Corrector after a friend recommended it, and she loves it. The product worked excellent and after a week she and I noticed considerable reduction of dark spots. It has been a month now and the dark spots are virtually gone.</li>
    <li> I generally stay away from serums, as Im usually pretty sceptical about the effect they have and I already use a good moisturizer and cleanser. My friend recommended this serum and I have to say the difference is really amazing. It&#x27;s the perfect base for my morning makeup routine. It feels so cool and refreshing when applied to my face, prior to my foundation, and I also use it before bed and my face looks so much brighter, clearer and younger every day.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way. I apply one pump to my cheeks and work it around. I have several noticeable spots larger than freckles after so many years in the sun. After about a week I noticed a difference in the dark spots and the fading has continued for several weeks now. After the cost of dermatology and spa treatments the price here is not so bad at all. The serum has a nice floral scent. I will buy again as long as the spots continue to fade.</li>
    <li> Husband bought two bottles for my birthday (at my request) and somehow ended up with an extra order of three more bottles, a total of 5 containers. My husband ended up giving me all 5.  Tried product but because of extreme health issues was not able to fully evaluate how it worked immediately.  Finally decided it was not worth the price and sent three unopened containers  back as it did not seem to work well for the price.  Was told that we sent it back 9 days too late and refused to refund  product yet they kept the three we sent back. So they have our $107 and the three containers. Worst birthday present I ever had.</li>
    <li> Saw results within 5 days.  Absolutely amazing</li>
    <li> All through high school, acne was a problem for me. As I faced my early adult years, I looked forward to what was ahead, until I would look in the mirror and see all the scars that were left behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to feel beautiful when you think everyone is staring at your scars instead of you. A friend referred me to City Radience. I was a huge skeptic, but after trying a sample of hers for a week, I started to see a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered my bottle and applied it as directed. Some days, I wanted to just keep applying it ever few hours in hopes that I would wake up and it all be gone&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, here I am, just a few months later and I can tell you that it is one of the best investments I&#x27;ve made. Scars are fading and I am beginning to be more confident. I&#x27;ve even gotten compliments on how amazing my skin looks!  Thank you, City Radience for your Dark Spot Corrector.</li>
    <li> I have always struggled with acne from a young age and as I got older it turned into cystic acne which leaves lots of dark spots. I have tried all kinds of products including prescriptions from my dermatologist and over the counter serums. City Radiance Dark Spot Corrector actually delivers, which is quite a relief because even though I am in my mid twenties my cystic acne doesn&#x27;t seem to be going anywhere. I have been using it for a few months (applied twice a day) and my dark spots have improved drastically. This is my new favorite must-have beauty product!</li>
    <li> I bought 4 containers of this and used it as directed for more than a month. I saw no results! It is WAY too expensive for the lack of results. The pump did not work on 3 of my containers, and I had to scoop it out with something. Very disappointing! Also, it has very little product in the bottle. I will try another product that is more reasonably priced and had good reviews. I cannot believe Consumer Guide rated this high. It is not a good product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll keep it simple. The product didn&#x27;t work for me at all--no lightening whatsoever of my hyperpigmented spots. I&#x27;ve decided to embrace my spots and declare them to be cute. At least the product caused no harm and has a pleasant flowery smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Seller was very courteous and prompt about my return and refund (we agreed 50% was fair).</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. Doesn&#x27;t work and can result in a breakout.</li>
    <li> Where vitamin and mineral treatments failed, this corrector succeeded in eliminating the liver spots on my legs and back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I developed the age spots, I always enjoyed wearing dresses with a plunging back - especially in the summer.  My age spots became a problem pretty quickly. I suppose they were there for awhile but they were never noticeable or ugly until this spring when I noticed my back had &amp;#34;big ugly freckle moles.&amp;#34;  That&#x27;s how I described them to my holistic doctor when I went to find out if I had developed skin cancer. He told me they were nothing to worry about -- &amp;#34;just age spots.&amp;#34; He also told me I could probably expect to get more of them. He suggested some specific vitamins and creams which I used faithfully with no visible results, though they may have slowed down the development of additional age spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I found out about this dark spot corrector and I began using it in July. No new spots have appeared but astonishingly to me the ugliest spots on my back have faded somewhat. They are not completely gone but they don&#x27;t look like &amp;#34;old lady spots&amp;#34; and I am wearing clothing with deep plunging backs once again. I am hopeful that with continued use of this product I will continue to see improvements in my skin.</li>
    <li> I love this however, it&#x27;s too expensive.</li>
    <li> I used this expensive product the correct way for 2 months and there was absolutely no change on my dark spot</li>
    <li> used the entire bottle never saw a difference at all.  Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> Works like magic. I admit, I am always a bit skeptical when a product claims to work on dark spots or discoloration. Many products I have tried in the past have either irritated my skin or not worked at all. I am pleased to say that this is the real deal. Not only did it help remove dark spots on my face, it was also very gentle on my skin. Although it is a bit pricey, I put no monetary restrictions on a product that does what I need it to do. I no longer have to cover acne blemishes with make-up. I am confident being bare faced and free. I love this product and think it is a wonderful option for removing scars and evening skin tone.</li>
    <li> City Cosmetics produces great makeup, and this is one of them. I bought this for my girlfriend and she absolutely loves it. She has dark spots around her arms and few on her face. She applied the makeup and covered great. She wants me to order another thing of it. I highly recommend the City Cosmetics Radiance Illuminator.</li>
    <li> Used this product for several weeks and saw absolutely NO CHANGE in my skin tone/dark spots.  For the price, I would have expected better performance.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t recommend this product or the seller to anyone!  I have dark spots on my hands and was willing to pay $80 for something to help remove them.  What I got was 5 pre-measured doses which wasn&#x27;t enough to accomplish anything!  Maybe it would have helped if I&#x27;d had more product, I don&#x27;t know, but I also reacted badly to it with a migraine that lasted the entire 5 days and went away immediately after the last application.  I was told there was \\&quot;No Issue\\&quot; when I contacted the seller; according to her/him everyone else loved paying $80 for at most a teaspoon of product... along with having a 5-day migraine!</li>
    <li> They only gave me 7 days to see if a dark spot corrector would help my skin, otherwise no returns after 7 days.  You need at least 30 days to be able to return something - espcecially something you  have to use for a while to see results.  Dissappointed</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the dark spot corrector for over two months now with no changes at all in my dark spots.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product directly from the company.  The container shows 0.5 oz or 15 ml, which is a small amount, but it did not appear to be even that much product in the container.  The little pump spigot in the cap is only about 1/4 inch long and clearly does not reach down into the container so cannot pump up the tiny bit of product.  Unfortunately, I ordered two containers of what is essentially air.  Pricing is similiar to price here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alone, the product gives a slight sheen to the skin, but no lightening of dark spots.  Used in combination with the Mary Kay timewise dark spot reducer I think I see a little fading after a couple of months of use of the MK.  I will continue to use in tandem now with the MK until product is completely empty, but will not reorder.  I&#x27;m using it because I spent my money for it, so may as well.</li>
    <li> I bought this for myself the first time and I love it so much that I bought another one. It really does help your face with&lt;br /&gt;dark spots and if you have any acne it will clear it up.  If you haven&#x27;t tried this product you must! I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Better off buying something less expensive as this product works but no better than those costing a third of the price. Way over rated</li>
    <li> I bought 5 and nothing happened</li>
    <li> My wife uses these types of products to lighten her dark spots on her face. She is a Latina woman with a very light  brown skin tone. She has used many with varying degrees of success - this one is working a little better than some others.  You can&#x27;t use it for a few days and expect results, you do need to apply it for at least a week to start to see change.  Full correction will take more time depending on how much darker your spots are than your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Docked it one star because of the price. Also, do check around. We didn&#x27;t buy here because we found a better price elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I tried this product and used the entire bottle and so know changes.  I am still looking for a product that will really get rid of dark spots.</li>
    <li> This product has tiny &amp;#34;sparkles&amp;#34; in it, which must be the illuminator. It is a nice, light moisturizer but had absolutely no lightening effect on the sun damage on my face and neck skin or on the age spots on my husband&#x27;s face. We used the product for about 8 weeks, 2x/day. My advice is to save the money for a visit to your dermatologist.</li>
    <li> At the beginning, I really didn&#x27;t care about this product because I didn&#x27;t like its viscosity and found it to be too sticky but I&#x27;m glad I kept on using it. After about 3 weeks, I didn&#x27;t see the difference but other people did and I was surprised when couple of friends asked me which kind of foundation I was using to hide my dark/ aged spots because my skin looked like it had no make up on it. I told them that I was not using any kind of foundation and that all I needed was City Cosmetics Illuminator and that I used it only on the dark spots.&lt;br /&gt;When you look at yourself on the daily basis it&#x27;s hard to see the improvements but when other people notice, you know it&#x27;s working!</li>
    <li> I have been impressed with some of the city views Products and I have ordered lots of the eye correctors and skin products.  The Dark spot corrector works somewhat slower than the othwr products which may stand to reason since dark spots are hard to have anything work to remove them.  I have noticed a lightening of all the dark spots on my face.  Even the curling iron burn spots.  You have to be patient with this product because it takes a while for it to lighten the spots but it works.</li>
    <li> This product did NOTHING for my age spots.  I am totally disappointed.  I wish I could get my money back!</li>
    <li> I love love LOVE this product. I rub it on my head after I get out of the shower every morning and it makes my head so soft and smooth. My shiny bald head looks so good, that it makes people with full heads of hair jealous. Do yourself a favor and rub this magic potion all over your dome!!</li>
    <li> I had no idea there were actual working products that get rid of dark spots! I&#x27;ve been using it on my freckles and they&#x27;re a lot less intense than they were a month ago. I will say it did take a few weeks for me to notice a difference, but I did. My friend suggested it after she used it on dark stretch marks from pregnancy and swears by it. I give this product an A+++!</li>
    <li> Not one bit of change after using twice daily on two large dark spots for over two months.</li>
    <li> This product impressed me quite a bit. I have been a freelance makeup artist for many years, and clients often come to me with pigmentation issues. While it is easy for me to teach them how to cover them up, my preference is for them to be able to clear it up more permanently. Most products do little to treat the problem. This one does the trick.  It does a great job treating hyper-pigmentation and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> When my son came back from football camp before his senior year in high school, he had terrible acne on his face. We went to the doctor to get antibiotics to cure the acne, but there were still some pretty bad scars. He was very conscious of the scars and became withdrawn and moody. On a whim, I ordered some City Radience Dark Spot Corrector for him to try. Within one month, there was considerable impromvement. He started smiling again and was hanging out with friends more. By the time school started, he was back to his old, normal self and even won homecoming king! This product is definitely worth using.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after reading a very impressive review in First Magazine rating it one of the top three melanin spot lighteners that do not use hydraquinone  which now is  touted as harmful to the skin. I have tried all the products from med spas -So I thought why not - I like it and  it is working ! Like anything worthwhile  follow the directions -twice a day on the spots use a qtip or your  pinky  - put it on a  super clean  face .  I have paid hundreds a treatment for laser and chemical peels this is BETTER and patience  You didn&#x27;t develop the spots over night don;t expect them to disappear  after a couple of days. Remember just treat the Spots.</li>
    <li> I have a few acne scars around my chin from my teenage years and I have always been very self conscious of them. I have tried other correctors and have used good old foundation application... none of these have pleased me. This product was recommended to me by a friend a few months ago, and I thought it was sort of pricey. But, I was desperate so I went ahead and took a chance. I am three months into using this now and I am definitely pleased. This stuff actually prevents other problems from reoccurring and makes your overall look and feel of your face even better than how you started out with. I am giving it four stars solely because of the price... it&#x27;s a REALLY tiny bottle and although the product is great, I wish it would be a tad cheaper.</li>
    <li> They did a sneaky thing &amp;#34;recommended by Consumer Guide&amp;#34;  They are hoping people will mistake it for &amp;#34;Consumer Reports&amp;#34;,  the organization that truly does &amp;#34;unbiased&amp;#34; testing and reporting.  The arm of Consumer Reports that does product testing, supplement testing ie the real contents of claimed products etc is &amp;#34;Consumer Lab&amp;#34; You have to join to see Consumer Reports and Consumer Lab testing.  Sneaky!</li>
    <li> This worked really great for me. After a few times of using my dark spots and sun spots on my face had disappeared and my skin looked great. My skin was back to original form and I couldn&#x27;t be any happier! This was so easy to use and the results were amazing. I was very skeptical to try this and figured it would be a waste of money but it actually worked really well.</li>
    <li> In my 74 years, I have wasted a lot of money on products with extravagant claims and no results.  After using the Radiance Illuminator for 3 weeks, I am seeing positive results.  For the first time ever, my brown spots are actually fading!  I have only been applying it once daily, maybe I would be seeing a greater improvement if I actually followed the recommendation and used it twice a day.  This is the ONLY product ( and I&#x27;ve bought lots and paid a lot more) that has ever worked for me.  My only disappointment is the cost, it&#x27;s pricey BUT it works for me.</li>
    <li> I am still on my first container of this product and for me it really works.  I actually use one pump amount on my finger and apply it to both cheeks.  I play tennis every day and my skin takes a beating even though I go on the court with a white face of sunscreen- I can truly say it works for me- I use it every morning and night-I bought three containers and I love it</li>
    <li> Disappointed with the result.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t lighten the dark spots at all. Expensive and disappointing. It did smell good and goes on easily.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really understand all the negative reviews - although everybodies skin reacts differently.  I love it.  My skin is brighter and it has lightened the spots and freckles.  Very dark spots are lighter and hopefully in time will go away.  My husband uses it as well and loves it.  It does seem to have a very short tube inside to dispense the product, but most of the time it works.  Ours lasts for several weeks and we use it daily.</li>
    <li> So frustrated with this purchase! The bottle components are either defective or just lousy. The cap won&#x27;t go back on without causing the pump to compress, causing the product to be wasted. I don&#x27;t even know if the cream works, but it&#x27;s way too expensive to go unused. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have many age spots around my face and neck, which is really annoying when you are striving for a younger look. These stubborn areas would not fade or go away no matter what I used. Even though this product did not fully remove them, it helped make them seem more faded and less noticeable. My face feels even and more youthful, and I am happy that I decided to purchase this product. Much better results than anything else I have tried!</li>
    <li> I bought 4 bottles directly from CitY Cosmetics as there was a warning that the ones sold by amazon.com were a copy. Well, after 2 months applying on a rough spot in my face and some minor ones on the hands, I didn&#x27;t se ANY difference in the face. But on my hand I saw a little fading.&lt;br /&gt;Interesting thing: Check out the reviews on their website: Not a single revue is negative - and mine, of course, was never published. I wonder if all the positive reviews here were written by employees of City Cosmetics ?</li>
</ol>
