      <li>It was nice that it came already charged.</li>

      <li>I own two Panasonic men&#x27;s wet/dry shavers and I love them.  </li>
      <li>But I do suffer from dizziness problems, so it will be good to use when I am too dizzy to risk getting into the tub/shower, or for quick shaves when going somewhere.  </li>
      <li>You get very good, very close and very quick results that way.</li>
      <li>It sits in the outlet and the shaver sits on top of it.</li>
      <li>It shaves closer and smoother, hugs the curves better, and has a longer battery power than the brand I have been using for many years.  </li>
      <li>The results were a bit better than how my legs would feel the day after a razor shave.  </li>

      <li>No matter how many times I cleaned the thing out, it just never worked as well as it did</li>
      <li>Now, I can&#x27;t get it to charge at all any more.  </li>
      <li>I have it one month &amp; now it won&#x27;t charge any more.  </li>
      <li>I love this shaver.</li>
      <li>The bikini attachment acted more like a brush than anything</li>
      <li>So far, so good!  </li>
      <li>It was great for trimming the bikini region pretty evenly and quickly.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t think the Remington was that fantastic, but it did better than this.</li>
      <li>It is well constructed and easy to use.  </li>
      <li>This is a pretty shaver; a nice lavender/purple color.  </li>
      <li>but it was less than ideal (pulled the hair, wasn&#x27;t very precise).  </li>
      <li>(I get lots of irritation and ingrown hairs if I do) which was fine in winter...</li>
      <li>The grip is easy to use and it is easy to clean.</li>
      <li>This little razor is just wonderful.</li>
      <li>I am very pleased with this purchase and would highly recommend it to others.</li>
      <li>However, it will take time to go completely smooth versus using a razor.</li>
      <li>It does a fantastic job on underarms also.  </li>
      <li>It is easy to clean.  </li>
      <li>It was nice for using in or out of the shower, but the battery died on it pretty quick.  </li>
      <li>It is quick to use and easy to clean.  </li>
      <li>Of course it will not compare to a regular razor but for a quick convenient shave, it works great.  </li>
      <li>I am not disappointed with this Panasonic wet/dry shaver.</li>
      <li>The shaver worked OK when I first got it</li>
      <li>I was really excited when it got here and</li>
      <li>reason this gets two stars instead of one is that it does do a good job on my legs, and the shaver holds a charge well, for several shaves.  </li>
      <li>If you grow hair quickly like I do, this is an issue.</li>
      <li>I went to do a quick shave on my calves and ended up with stripes from the sides of the unit scraping my legs.</li>
      <li>I wanted something I could use in or out of the shower and that would be quick.    </li>
      <li>You will need to use it every day or two if your hair grows quickly.</li>
      <li>It charges quickly and stays charged.</li>
      <li>and it was quick.  </li>
      <li>: It&#x27;s cordelss, recharchable, easy to clean, pivots, it&#x27;s curved, it works well wet or dry, awesome with shave gel</li>
      <li>I bought it mostly for dry shaving and easy clean up.</li>
      <li>I get a very close shave and it leaves my skin silky smooth.  </li>
      <li>The pop-up trimmer is great for stray hairs, or if you have a few days of growth.    </li>
      <li>Well worth the money in my opinion.</li>
      <li>Obviously if you want silky smooth, a blade or wax will be much better.  </li>
      <li>But this one is loud too - you can hear both of them from many rooms away.</li>
      <li>This is a pretty device (I ordered the mauve, kind of a pearlized pink color) and is easy to hold and to use.</li>
      <li>Having read the reviews for this one on Amazon, I decided to take a chance since the price was right.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s quick - much quicker than shaving with a razor.  </li>
      <li>It shaves close, and very fast.</li>
      <li>I have seen the same exact item for more money than what Amazon charged for it.      </li>
      <li>the first time I used it</li>
      <li>I tried going over areas several times and never felt satisfied with the result.</li>
      <li>I purchased this as a first time shaver for my daughter.  </li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m very satsified!  </li>
      <li>This is her first electric shaver.  </li>
      <li>The trimmer works pretty well, although I&#x27;m still getting the hang of it.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s much much better than the last shaver that I had.</li>
      <li>I have used it once wet and one dry and loved the results of both!  </li>
      <li>The charger is small and tends to be unobstrusive; the cord is long, which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;ve been very pleased to not be using a razor and cream!!</li>
      <li>The reviews of this seemed promising, and I&#x27;m glad to say, I definitely</li>
      <li>&quot; feature, allowing a closer shave for certain spots gave out first.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t find it that helpful for removing underarm hair but it is fantastic for the entire leg, leaving a soft smooth feel to the touch.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a really low maintenance type girl, so I thought this would suit me fine, and it did for the first 5 months.  </li>
      <li>I was a little hesitant due to the pivoting head since I haven&#x27;t had much luck with those, but this is wonderful.</li>
      <li>I normally get right out of the shower after I shave my legs.  </li>
      <li>If you are looking to be smooth down under, you are better off using a trimmer (Panasonic makes one for women or Wahl for men) to cut things down to an easy length for shaving or preparation for waxing.  </li>
      <li>You could be shaving along la di da and all of a sudden get a huge area of hair.</li>
      <li>They got much closer without having to apply force.  </li>
      <li>I called Panasonic&#x27;s support line hoping that they would have an alternate charger available.</li>
      <li>That said, my primary concern is shaving my armpits without irritation, which it does, and without having to keep going over the same area to catch all the hairs, which it doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
      <li>In her case the results were better than expected, but she hopes that this will improve over time.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve owned several electric razors in the past and this one is by far superior to the others.  It gives you a close shave without causing any nicks or burns like my old one.  It can be used either wet or dry and works well both ways.  I also like the fact that you can change the angle of the head to shave your armpits vs your legs.  Of course it will not compare to a regular razor but for a quick convenient shave, it works great.  You will need to use it every day or two if your hair grows quickly. Well worth the money in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I received this product as a gift in Nov 09 and have been very pleased with it.  I have never had an electric shaver before, and thought it might be a time/energy/money-saver.  So far, so good!  It seems to work better dry, rather than wet, which is actually better for me (shower is too small to shave in anyway!).  I learned to go slow, otherwise it needs a second pass, but I don&#x27;t expect other electric razors are much different.  The trimmer works pretty well, although I&#x27;m still getting the hang of it.  The charger is small and tends to be unobstrusive; the cord is long, which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;ve been very pleased to not be using a razor and cream!!</li>
    <li> At 62, my shaving needs are basic, so I have nothing to say about the bikini features, for obvious reasons.  I don&#x27;t particularly care to shave in the shower either.  All I want in a shaver is for it to work well for my armpits and legs.  I have sensitive skin, so I took a chance on this shaver; it&#x27;s my first Panasonic, and my last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason this gets two stars instead of one is that it does do a good job on my legs, and the shaver holds a charge well, for several shaves.  That said, my primary concern is shaving my armpits without irritation, which it does, and without having to keep going over the same area to catch all the hairs, which it doesn&#x27;t.  You would think that with the rotating head that this contour feature would help, but this shaver will not give you a close shave under your arms without several passes.  I don&#x27;t even have thick hair, so if you do, I certainly wouldn&#x27;t recommend this shaver.</li>
    <li> I am disappointed with this shaver. I bought it based on the other reviews, but I have tried it wet and dry and it is does not give a close shave.</li>
    <li> I was tired of nicks and the hassle and waste of water (I live in the desert) of shaving with a blade. I was wary of buying an electric shaver because I have purchased both shavers and epilators in the past and found they did not work and/or were just too painful to use. Having read the reviews for this one on Amazon, I decided to take a chance since the price was right. All I can say is, WOW! I am really impressed by this shaver! It is not quite as close as a blade shave, but really good. I saved a lot of time, and a lot of water (even better!). It also did not irritate my underarm area like some electric shavers I have used. I am very pleased with this purchase and would highly recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> Looking forward to Panasonic creating the same quality razor for women as they do for men.    This &#x27;top of the line&#x27; electric razor was encased in plastic and hard to open. The materials used in the razor itself unfortunately matched that lack of quality. Cutting heads were rudimentary and did not provide a close or even shave. My wife is going back to a blade not because she loves it, but at least it works as an effective tool.</li>
    <li> I love this shaver. It charges quickly and stays charged. It removes leg hair painlessly without leaving stubbles. The grip is easy to use and it is easy to clean. I travel with it as well. I didn&#x27;t find it that helpful for removing underarm hair but it is fantastic for the entire leg, leaving a soft smooth feel to the touch.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think I ever got one decent shave with this razor. Wet or dry it is far from a close shave! I bought it mostly for dry shaving and easy clean up. I don&#x27;t know if mine was defective or what, but it felt like it just pulled my hair instead of cut it. I tried going over areas several times and never felt satisfied with the result. I didn&#x27;t buy this razor to go over areas over and over again... It&#x27;s time consuming and uncomfortable; worse than using a disposable razor. Defeats the purpose of buying an electric razor.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife. The charger is a small block designed so that the razor balances on top while plugged into a VERTICALLY ORIENTED outlet. If, like our house, your outlets are oriented horizontally, the razor sticks out sideways and will not remain on the charger. I called Panasonic&#x27;s support line hoping that they would have an alternate charger available. Their only suggestion was to visit a hardware store to find an adapter to turn the outlet. Unacceptable, horrible, short sighted product design.</li>
    <li> I had a Remington wet/dry that finally got outdated and I thought to replace it. I did a lot of research and decided to try this Panasonic. I was really excited when it got here and the first time I used it I loved it and was all set to write a raving review. But I thought I should wait a couple weeks. I am very unhappy with it, as it turns out. I wish I had my Remington back (or got a new Remington). Yes, the Remington is a little louder. But this one is loud too - you can hear both of them from many rooms away. So really, that&#x27;s not a big deal. I ended up getting another Remington and it is much better.  What got me is two things with this one:  1) The sides that hold the razor in place are taller than the razor area. So when you go to get a close shave, the sides of the unit scratch/scrape your leg. It is plastic, so no blood drawn or anything, but it doesn&#x27;t feel good. Has no one else noticed this? I went to do a quick shave on my calves and ended up with stripes from the sides of the unit scraping my legs. And it didn&#x27;t even get the little stubble. I didn&#x27;t think the Remington was that fantastic, but it did better than this. Someone suggested to put the side extenders down. I do see the extenders (per the angry reply to this post), but they are down all the way. The won&#x27;t go any farther down. So your angry post is not applicable. If I did not apply force to my leg with the razor, the length of the stubble it left was ridiculous. Again, maybe very long stubble is just the way it is, but not with my two Remingtons. They got much closer without having to apply force.  2) It vents out the cut hair once in a while all over your leg. You could be shaving along la di da and all of a sudden get a huge area of hair. I thought \\&quot;I already went over that area?\\&quot; but it was just the hair that got spit out from the razor. It is a little gross, I&#x27;m always wiping the cut hair off my leg. I&#x27;ve had two Remington&#x27;s that did not do this. The Remington might have left the hair on the ground, or kept it in its head for me to clean later, but I prefer the Remington that didn&#x27;t spit out puffs of hair on my legs incrementally. Again, the angry reply to this about including a vacuum is a bit silly.  Another disadvantage is that this one&#x27;s charger plugs straight into the outlet, instead of having a cord. So I have to find an outlet to leave it in to charge that my kids won&#x27;t get to. I like the cord better, so I can plug the cord in behind my dresser and have it sitting on top of my dresser in the little charger base. This one, you have to put the razor in the charger directly into the outlet. I could deal with this though if it didn&#x27;t spit hair out all over my leg or leave scrapes down my leg. Yes, you could get an extension cord, so it&#x27;s not that big of a deal. Just one more thing to add to a poor design IMO.</li>
    <li> This shaver works extremely well.  I get a very close shave and it leaves my skin silky smooth.  It is easy to clean.  I have very sensitive skin and have had no outbreaks or razer burn from this little shaver.</li>
    <li> I was completely unimpressed with this shaver.  Perhaps I received a defective one, but it scratched my legs all up.  The design on the shaver part is a bad one (right next to the bikini trimmer pop-up portion).  It made the edges of the shaver scratch my legs as I attempted to shave.  This is the worst shaver I&#x27;ve ever used - and I&#x27;ve been using electric shavers for about 15 years.  I sent it right on back to Amazon.  I have to say I was extremely impressed with Amazon though - they fully refunded my money, even including what I paid to ship it back to them.</li>
    <li> It was nice that it came already charged. I have used it several times and have not needed to charge it. I like that the charger is small. It sits in the outlet and the shaver sits on top of it. I have a small bathroom and I don&#x27;t want another bulky base and extra attachments laying around. I use it when I don&#x27;t have time to shave. You can still feel the hair but you can&#x27;t see it.</li>
    <li> The shaver worked OK when I first got it but after a few months it stopped working very well.  I don&#x27;t shave everyday.  Maybe that&#x27;s the problem.  I know you&#x27;re suppose to change the foil and the blades after a year but it wasn&#x27;t even a year before it stopped working.  This is the second electric shaver I got.  Never again.  I stick to the old fashioned blade razor.</li>
    <li> This is the best electric shaver I have ever owned.  Besides the fact, it is one of the best electric razors.  The price is more than fair beause I have seen the same exact item for more money than what Amazon charged for it.      I would definitely recommend this item.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned this shaver for about six months. I bought it originally to save money on replacement blades, save water and also produce less waste.  I&#x27;m a really low maintenance type girl, so I thought this would suit me fine, and it did for the first 5 months.  Now that the blades are worn, the razor refuses to cut all the hair on my legs even after multiple passes.  The replacement blades are about $20 and foils another $10.  A whole new razor is $40.  It only holds enough charge for one shaving (legs, bikini, and underarm) and although that&#x27;s not a big problem, I do have to keep up the pace or it tends to sound like it&#x27;s about to die and the shave gets REALLY crappy.  SO....do I spend $30 after 6 months (I think I&#x27;m not saving much money vs. disposables) to replace the blades and foil, chuck the whole thing in a landfill and buy a whole new one for $40 (this does not save any waste) or go back to regular razors??  Sounds like a lose/lose situation to me.</li>
    <li> After about 2 weeks of using this shaver, I must write and say this:  It is better than any other I have used in a long time.  It shaves closer and smoother, hugs the curves better, and has a longer battery power than the brand I have been using for many years.  I have only used it dry without shaving gel and I have suffered no nicks, no burns, no irritation, no bumps.  The price is also good.</li>
    <li> I decided to go with this model because of the pivoting head and the bikini attachment.  When I was a teenager, my mom bought me a ladies electric shaver.  It was nice for using in or out of the shower, but the battery died on it pretty quick.  I&#x27;ve realized now that I hate shaving with a razor in the shower.  I just have a shower stall, not a bathtub/shower unit, so it&#x27;s very cramped and uncomfortable.  I wanted something I could use in or out of the shower and that would be quick.    The key thing to remember with an electric shaver is it&#x27;s not going to give you as close of a shave as a razor.  If you think it will, you&#x27;ll be disappointed.  With that in mind, I was VERY satisfied with this shaver&#x27;s performance.  I&#x27;ve tried it now both wet and dry.  It is quick to use and easy to clean.  It didn&#x27;t cause the shave itch I normally get right out of the shower after I shave my legs.  It worked very well for tidying up my nether region.  Again, no itch and it was quick.  The attachment was very easy to get on and off.    The downsides to the product are:  the switches are a little hard to operate in the shower when your hands are wet.  If you are using the bikini trimmer attachment in the shower, you need to go a little slow because wet hair tends to clog things.  I can&#x27;t shave my armpits with this.  The skin there is too delicate, so I have to stick to a single swipe with a razor there.    I gave this 5 stars because it exceeded my expectations.  It&#x27;s a much closer shave than my old electric shaver and it&#x27;s quick - much quicker than shaving with a razor.  The results were a bit better than how my legs would feel the day after a razor shave.  The shaver is very quiet and easy for me to maneuver in my hands, wet or dry.    Tips: Don&#x27;t press down hard while you shave - go smooth and light over your skin.  If you are shaving dry, pull the skin taut above where you are shaving.  You get very good, very close and very quick results that way.</li>
    <li> I am writing this on behalf my wife.  This is her first electric shaver.  I own two Panasonic men&#x27;s wet/dry shavers and I love them.  She bought this because she is a recessionista - it&#x27;s expensive over time with disposable shavers.    The good: It&#x27;s cordelss, recharchable, easy to clean, pivots, it&#x27;s curved, it works well wet or dry, awesome with shave gel and it works well for the underarms and legs.  Obviously if you want silky smooth, a blade or wax will be much better.  The pop-up trimmer is great for stray hairs, or if you have a few days of growth.    What&#x27;s so-so - using it to get silky smooth down under. If you don&#x27;t like hair there, it&#x27;s great for keeping the hedges in check.  If you like the bald look, it will get you there.  However, it will take time to go completely smooth versus using a razor. She says it&#x27;s great for touch ups between blade shaves or waxes. For instance, she used it a lot during her pregnancy. In her case the results were better than expected, but she hopes that this will improve over time. It&#x27;s probably a really good solution when you are traveling and are going to be wearing a bathing suit almost everyday - especially at the beach.  The salt water may not irritate the area that much.    What&#x27;s bad: The bikini attachment is useless.  My wife didn&#x27;t bother trying the attachment.  If you are looking to be smooth down under, you are better off using a trimmer (Panasonic makes one for women or Wahl for men) to cut things down to an easy length for shaving or preparation for waxing.  If you are looking to trim down there, again use a cordless trimmer.    Bottom line, it is a great shaver than cuts down on wasted money and waste with disposable razors.  Just remember it takes time for your skin to get used to an electric shaver.</li>
    <li> I am 66 years old and this is the BEST razor I&#x27;ve ever used! It shaves close, and very fast. I can&#x27;t recommend it highly enough. It comes with a bikini attachment, but it shaves wonderfully without it! Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my eye on this for awhile, and finally got it for Christmas. There were a few key reasons I wanted one. First, wet/dry shaving sounded great, especially dry without wasting water down the drain. Also, the cost of replacement razors for the venus and similar items is ridiculous, so I&#x27;d only change it when it got very dull. Plus, I hated throwing away the plastic and adding to the landfills. The reviews of this seemed promising, and I&#x27;m glad to say, I definitely agree!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor works really well dry shaving, and its so much easier then balancing precariously on one foot in a wet shower. Not too loud, once you get started you forget it&#x27;s making any noise. According to the package, you need to replace the foils once a year and the razors in the machine every two years. Imagine the money I&#x27;ll save! Especially if you go thru multiple 8 packs of venus razors a year. It doesn&#x27;t get as close a shave as the regular razor, but thats not a big deal for me. I&#x27;ll use this on a normal basis and get out the razor when I need the babysoft feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a big fan, and will never go back to using traditional razors full time.</li>
    <li> It was time for my granddaughter to begin shaving. But razors can be a bit scary with sharp blades! Even though an electric shaver does not shave as close as a blade shaver, it also does not nick! This is a pretty device (I ordered the mauve, kind of a pearlized pink color) and is easy to hold and to use. It holds a charge for a long time. For closest results, go over the area in every direction and do both straight and circular movements.</li>
    <li> I never thought I&#x27;d find a shaver that could handle my sensitive skin and coarse hair. Creams burned, hair removal treatments left red spots and razors left bumps. So, I decided to go with a shaver as a last resort. I am not disappointed with this Panasonic wet/dry shaver. Works in and out of the shower as stated. Bikini attachment is wonderful while pop up trimmer is a great feature. If all instructions are read and followed, shaving won&#x27;t be a problem at all.</li>
    <li> I was not crazy about this product, 3 months later it hardly works at all. I have to go over the same patch of skin before it cuts all the hairs which leads to skin irritation also it&#x27;s not a close shave so while it worked I found myself having to shave every morning.</li>
    <li> When I first received this shaver, it worked great!  I have it one month &amp; now it won&#x27;t charge any more.  I was extremely careful with it &amp; only charged it when the charge was gone, and never over-charged it.  Now, I can&#x27;t get it to charge at all any more.  I&#x27;m very disappointed with this shaver - worked great for one month &amp; then died!  I would not buy this type of item from Amazon again either, because they don&#x27;t even know how much of my money they will be refunding.  They can&#x27;t promise me a full refund because it&#x27;s been over 30 days since I placed my order, even though the shaver is now useless!!  Lesson learned here!</li>
    <li> I was new to electric women&#x27;s razors, and chose this one because it was relatively inexpensive.  I really wanted it to use outside of the shower, for quick \\&quot;leg\\&quot; shaves.  As a few other reviewers have mentioned, I had to go over several spots on my legs continuously.  Sometimes, I had just had to give up and go back to my disposable razor/shaving cream.  I&#x27;d only had it a few months when it started to give out.  The \\&quot;push out\\&quot; feature, allowing a closer shave for certain spots gave out first.  No matter how many times I cleaned the thing out, it just never worked as well as it did the first few times I used it.  I was getting nicks/pulls and finally I tossed it.  I&#x27;d considered calling the \\&quot;parts\\&quot; number, but after reading several reviews about never getting any replacements for it, I gave up.</li>
    <li> This product came as a faulty one. I can&#x27;t charge it with the charger that came with. Actually I can get it to charge if I hold and tilt the shaver to one side but as soon as I let go, it stops charging. I tried using the shaver and I have to say I wouldn&#x27;t give up my Gillette razor for this. It could be handy if you travel and only need a relatively decent shave, as it didn&#x27;t cause me razor burn when used dry.</li>
    <li> This is the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had with an electric razor and I&#x27;m thrilled.  I was a little hesitant due to the pivoting head since I haven&#x27;t had much luck with those, but this is wonderful. It does a fantastic job on underarms also.  I&#x27;ve had mine almost a month and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s worth paying a little extra for this one. It&#x27;s much much better than the last shaver that I had.</li>
    <li> This little razor is just wonderful. I thought that I wanted another name brand but my price point and their price point were way off. So based strictly on the reviews I got this one. I love the wet/dry factor, I love how easy it is to recharge(my previous razor had a home base and a cord which took up a lot of space), and the one thing that I thought I&#x27;d never use, the pop-up trimmer, I use all the time. I do agree with some of the previous reviews the bikini trimmer is useless but everything else makes up for that. I would definitely recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a first time shaver for my daughter.  It is well constructed and easy to use.  My only worry is that it a little rough on her skin.   The plastic strip on the shaving surface itself is  just a little too prominent and it rubs against the skin creating friction and scrapes against the skin.  It isn&#x27;t painful by any means, but certainly a little uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been needing to replace my last electric shaver to use on my underarms for ages but felt overwhelmed by options. Instead I was using a regular razor sink-side.  But that meant I couldn&#x27;t shave everyday (I get lots of irritation and ingrown hairs if I do) which was fine in winter...but now it&#x27;s getting warmer. I finally decided on this one because it&#x27;s got the added bonus of the bikini trimmer.  I had always had a separate trimmer for that but it was less than ideal (pulled the hair, wasn&#x27;t very precise).  I tried this one last night on my legs, with shaving lotion, too.  It works pretty darn well on all counts - not as close as a regular razor but that&#x27;s to be expected.  It&#x27;s a little less gentle than my old electric on the underarms so I&#x27;ll have to tread carefully in that ares.  It was great for trimming the bikini region pretty evenly and quickly.  It took about half the time of my old trimmer.  So I&#x27;m pretty happy about this purchase!  Hello, summer!</li>
    <li> I have never written a product review online before but my experience with this razor definitely deserves one!  I recieved this on Wed, charged it and began use on Thursday.  I have used it once wet and one dry and loved the results of both!  It is quiet, provides a close shave already (claims to improve over three weeks!), and gives me NO razor burn.  The whole reason I bought this razor was to try to find something that would eliminate razor burn for me and I had yet to succeed after trying all kinds of epilators, razors, depilatory creams, and other electric razors.  This finally has me happy!  It may not give the perfect smooth shave that my sister always seems to get right out of the box but I&#x27;m very satsified!  I was never able to shave more than twice a week before so this will give me a closer shave with a better experience hands down!  Can&#x27;t wait to see what happens after the 3 week point!</li>
    <li> The razor itself is great. The bikini attachment is useless. I got a nice close shave on my legs and no razor burn. The bikini attachment acted more like a brush than anything and I dont need to brush my bikini area! LOL</li>
    <li> This is a pretty shaver; a nice lavender/purple color.  I like that it has the base that you can leave it on while unplugged, so storage is not an issue.  It shaved pretty close the first time, although, I would have to use it everyday to keep my legs looking halfway decent, and that is too time consuming.  It does not shave anything like a manual razor, nowhere near as close, so stubble is a constant.  But I do suffer from dizziness problems, so it will be good to use when I am too dizzy to risk getting into the tub/shower, or for quick shaves when going somewhere.  I will have to charge it before every shave, as the charge ran out halfway through my second shave, so I have to think of this ahead of time, no big deal.  It is a nice electric razor for what it does.  It did not scratch or cut my skin, even around my knobby knees.  Just keep in mind that electric razors do not shave anything like a manual shaver; no where near as close.  If you grow hair quickly like I do, this is an issue.</li>
