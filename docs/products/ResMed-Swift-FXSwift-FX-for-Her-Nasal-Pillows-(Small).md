      <li>It arrived in a timely manner and fit like a glove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>With the right fit, my CPAP is the easiest thing in the world to tolerate - except for the night</li>

      <li>Thanks!!</li>

      <li>The nose piece has a double layer and you have to make sure it is in the right place.  </li>
      <li>the internal part keeps popping inside out, but otherwise ok</li>
      <li>Exactly what I needed</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>They arrived really quickly and were the same soft ResMed Swift FX/for her that I originally received.  </li>
      <li>Although this was the item we intended to purchase, we were concerned with it being medical equipment, primarily respiratory supplies, that the pillows did not come in sealed, sterile packaging.</li>
      <li>how much my OSA was diminishing my quality of life until I got treatment for it.</li>
      <li>He&#x27;s reluctant to change, and a real &amp;#34;SOB&amp;#34;, so who knows?</li>
      <li>If you move much this might not work for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>it is much easier to put on and remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t sleep very well for those 5 days, but my sinus passges thanked me.</li>
      <li>Way cheaper than getting a new mask.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is the exact same nasal pillow that I&#x27;ve been using for 2.5 years.  </li>
      <li>I can think clearly again, and remember what people say to me and what I&#x27;ve read.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used a CPAP for nearly 15 years.  </li>
      <li>The direct air can cause some pain from the inside nasal passages drying out.</li>
      <li>I sleep very still, on my back, with the tubing on my chest</li>
      <li>price was much cheaper than my coinsurance when I went through my medical supply company</li>
      <li>Sealed in the package but they are soft like when it was time to change my old ones.  </li>
      <li>They are small, fit well and keep the air flowing without making my face break out as the masks did.</li>
      <li>Also, you should wash these in warmish -not warm hot- water with a mild soap, and air or dry once (1 x) a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I think I might need an extra small but that size isn&#x27;t available.</li>
      <li>I found these &amp;#34;Nasal Pillows&amp;#34; about two (2) years ago, and I haven&#x27;t gone back to the old mask til recently.</li>
      <li>This is the exact same thing at half the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>, remember my dreams, and my mental clarity has returned to normal.  </li>
      <li>My insurance company provided me with new nasal pillows that turned out to be not only uncomfortable, but felt inferior to the original ones that came with my headgear.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Perfect replacement part</li>
    <li> Although this was the item we intended to purchase, we were concerned with it being medical equipment, primarily respiratory supplies, that the pillows did not come in sealed, sterile packaging. For all we knew, they could have been in bulk in a bin and handled by who knows. Each one was simply in a small ziplock bag. Therefore we sterilized them.</li>
    <li> I sleep very still, on my back, with the tubing on my chest so I have very little trouble with leaks.  If you move much this might not work for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does not block my vision as the mask systems do.  It gives me much more freedom and with &amp;#34;around the ear&amp;#34; head gear it is much easier to put on and remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons include the propensity for a whistle from the nose piece if it is not fitted just right.  The nose piece has a double layer and you have to make sure it is in the right place.  It did cause some soreness on the inside of my nose but time and getting the right adjustment took care of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon&#x27;s price was much cheaper than my coinsurance when I went through my medical supply company</li>
    <li> The Nasal Pillows were as expected, enclosed in a small sealed plastic bag, but they did not smell fresh. I had to wash them in white vinegar to get a smoky smell off them.</li>
    <li> My insurance company provided me with new nasal pillows that turned out to be not only uncomfortable, but felt inferior to the original ones that came with my headgear.  I  ordered a set from Amazon as the price was very reasonable and there was no shipping cost!  They arrived really quickly and were the same soft ResMed Swift FX/for her that I originally received.  Ahh, back to sleeping in comfort.  Thanks!!</li>
    <li> There is nothing wrong with this product. I cannot tolerate anything in my nose and didn&#x27;t know that until I tried this system. I am certain most people will find this product very comfortable.</li>
    <li> They fit perfectly with my head gear and at a fraction of the cost of cpap sites.</li>
    <li> Sealed in the package but they are soft like when it was time to change my old ones.  Had to tighten head gear to get to seal</li>
    <li> I used to purchase my Cpap supplies through a medical supplier, very expensive! This is the exact same thing at half the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the nasal pillow for over a year and love it! I replace every couple of moths when I feel the seal is not good around my nostrils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend</li>
    <li> Have used these before and they are very comfortable.</li>
    <li> Good deal. Nice to be able to find CPAP supplies on Amazon.</li>
    <li> DESIGN FLAW&lt;br /&gt;the exhaust blows out all over the user. the hose wiggles it loose. terrible. I ended up with a better model Airfit 10... so much better!</li>
    <li> Wonderful to know I can buy them on line.</li>
    <li> They have always been great.</li>
    <li> This was a part replacement for my original Swift FX for Her mask nasal pillows. Way cheaper than getting a new mask. I&#x27;m so glad that an Amazon seller has these parts available. Thanks!</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re just as described. SOOOOOOOooo COMFY!. LOVE THESE! What a fantastic find! A great replacement for my CPAP nasal/mouth mask, which is really dificult to sleep with, or getting used to. I found these &amp;#34;Nasal Pillows&amp;#34; about two (2) years ago, and I haven&#x27;t gone back to the old mask til recently. The reason I did go back was b/c after prolonged use (that I experienced, everyone is different) my nasal passages seems to need a break, so I switched back for 5 days. I didn&#x27;t sleep very well for those 5 days, but my sinus passges thanked me. I&#x27;m trying to get my dad to switch to these, as he wears the face mask from fifteen (that&#x27;s right 15!) years ago. He&#x27;s reluctant to change, and a real &amp;#34;SOB&amp;#34;, so who knows? He might surprise me some day (Though I doubt it) -lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip/Hint: I use a cotton swab to dip (lightly saturate) into vitamin E oil and swab the inside of my nasal area. The direct air can cause some pain from the inside nasal passages drying out. This HELPS! I also add a little lavender oil for aroma therapy. Also, you should wash these in warmish -not warm hot- water with a mild soap, and air or dry once (1 x) a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Super soft&lt;br /&gt;Designed well&lt;br /&gt;Variety/Choice (There are different sizes and made for both men and women)&lt;br /&gt;Super Comfortable&lt;br /&gt;Affordable&lt;br /&gt;Easily convertable. though it depends on the manufacturer of your air machine and the type of hose. You will might need to buy a hose and different headgear. Well worth the investment to get a good nights sleep!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;May dry out your nasal/sinus passages&lt;br /&gt;Prolonged use may irrate your nasal/sinus passages</li>
    <li> I struggled with cpap masks until I found these. They are small, fit well and keep the air flowing without making my face break out as the masks did. I love them.</li>
    <li> Perfect, was much cheaper than ordering thru home health center even after insurance paid.</li>
    <li> These are the best nasal pillows around - gave the XS 5 stars - I never thought I had small features but the S is too big.  With the right fit, my CPAP is the easiest thing in the world to tolerate - except for the night I had a toothache.  From the very first night, I slept through the night - first time in years - woke up easily with my alarm, never get sleepy during the day anymore, remember my dreams, and my mental clarity has returned to normal.  I can think clearly again, and remember what people say to me and what I&#x27;ve read.  I had no idea how much my OSA was diminishing my quality of life until I got treatment for it.</li>
    <li> the internal part keeps popping inside out, but otherwise ok</li>
    <li> I love all the ResMed Swift for Her products because they are so flexible and comfortable. This nasal pillow is much easier to wear than the hard plastic one I used to use. I gave it four stars because it sometimes allows air to escape and has to be adjusted. I think I might need an extra small but that size isn&#x27;t available.</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used a CPAP for nearly 15 years.  As such, I&#x27;ve had plenty of experience with both price and service.  This could not have been easier!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the exact same nasal pillow that I&#x27;ve been using for 2.5 years.  It arrived in a timely manner and fit like a glove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely save the bother of buying from medical supply companies.  With Amazon Prime, I don&#x27;t have to worry about paying $$ for a light package.</li>
    <li> works with the headgear.  Exactly what I needed</li>
    <li> For use with CPAP instead of a nasal mask or full face mask. I love it . I would not consider it if my pressures were above 10cwp (centimeters of water pressure.</li>
