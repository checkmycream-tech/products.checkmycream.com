      <li>It is absolutely amazing!</li>
      <li>no, THAT&#x27;S AMAZING!</li>
      <li>There are many awesome ingredients in this product that are of note:</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s a good thing --</li>
      <li>Growth was going so good, reduced capsules to 2 a day without any change.  </li>
      <li>That’s a good product, too.  </li>
      <li>i think it&#x27;s a good produce</li>
      <li>Good luck to you</li>
      <li>I have been using this for a year without any good results.</li>
      <li>I am very satisfied with the product at this point...and will continue ordering it.</li>
      <li>And while I have to say &amp;#34;not a miracle&amp;#34; -- when you&#x27;ve lost hope, it sure feels like one!</li>
      <li>I still have 2 months to go, hope to be able to add one or two stars at the end of the 4th month!</li>
      <li>Not any more!  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I could not ask for a more pleasant conversation.</li>
      <li>Just received the nicest surprise from Dr. Carlson – a free bottle of Provaxa and what great timing.</li>
      <li>a nice chat with Lois.</li>
      <li>All of Dr. Carlson&#x27;s products are impeccably created based on the latest research producing outstanding results for patients.</li>
      <li>My hair is very important to me,&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
      <li>Very attentive.  </li>
      <li>So many reviews here with 5 stars and reviews</li>
      <li>More hopeful after chat with Lois.</li>
      <li>I have been using PRO-VÄXA for many months, as have my patients.  </li>
      <li>and so healthy</li>
      <li>How many ways to say thank you to Dr. Carlson?  </li>
      <li>What more could you ask for?</li>
      <li>I look forward to more improvements.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I also switched to the recommended shampoo, and I love it.  </li>
      <li>Just follow the instructions and be sure to take 3 capsules a day.</li>
      <li>I’m glad to see it’s now on Amazon</li>
      <li>take more than they recommend, but bottom line...</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is the most caring doctor.  </li>
      <li>I am a long-time satisfied Pro-vaxa user of about 9 months.  </li>
      <li>Pro-Vaxa is fabulous!  </li>
      <li>The area of shedding were mostly the front and the  side.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Did not hurt either, but at this price, I was expecting more</li>
      <li>I had hair loss at the top and temple area.</li>
      <li>here’s my results which are outstanding.  </li>
      <li>I can’t see the top</li>
      <li>I had better luck just taking the Biotin and</li>
      <li>it was explained to me, my hair was able to grow again because Provaxa blocks DHT production.</li>
      <li>Got a nice gift of a free bottle of Provaxa and another supplement Dr. Carlson created called Stop-It that stops sugar cravings.  </li>
      <li>Hair shedding stopped after a week taking this product and remaining 20% of hair loss is still mostly on the front.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Thank you for the excellent customer service you&#x27;ve provided and for helping us not give up on the supplement and helping us \\&quot;troubleshoot\\&quot; the possible problems (yes, they call you and talk about your habits, meds, history, etc..</li>
      <li>Now I have more hair than ever before.  </li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>I have horses and spend most of the day in the heat around the barn and riding.</li>
      <li>Every month thereafter hair growth was better and better.</li>
      <li>I have not stopped shedding, the itching is more subdued, and the mid-top portion of my scalp continues to get thinner and thinner.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t wait to start going to Toni and Guy with my father for hair cuts and styling :)</li>
      <li>so I got a handle on this before more loss came.</li>
      <li>I ordered 3 months worth to give the product a fair chance.  </li>
      <li>Within 60 days of using Pro-Vaxa, I noticed more hair density in the thinning areas.</li>
      <li>This is truly an amazing combination and well worth the money!</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this great product.</li>
      <li>The people at pro vaxa are very helpful and show great concern they even sent me a months supply for free, thank you  Going to stick with the program.</li>
      <li>She was so sure this would work, and even sent me a a free bottle to get me going again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and my hairline has filled in with about an inch or more of growth.</li>
      <li>true to their word \\&quot;most people do not see a change before</li>
      <li>One huge benefit of Pro-Vaxa is my hair is stronger and fuller than ever.</li>
      <li>they are providing 90 day supply for free.</li>
      <li>I’ve been taking it for 3 months with fabulous results.  </li>
      <li>I started buying this from Dr. Carlson’s office before it was available on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>IMPORTANT:</li>
      <li>Life got in the way and honestly didn’t have much hope.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s surprising to see most of the reviews for this product are very recent and all 5 star.</li>
      <li>My hair is so soft without even needing conditioner that my stylist commented on its great condition and how pretty it is now.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for many months and first noticed after month 1 that my hair had stopped falling out in the shower.</li>
      <li>Within 30 minutes I received a friendly response asking me to call to discuss my experience.  </li>
      <li>so I am thinking of purchasing it for my father as it&#x27;s his birthday very soon and most importantly he&#x27;s already bald.</li>
      <li>And the good news is that with continued use, hair may come back in thicker and with color.  </li>
      <li>The review indicated that by using Nioxin shampoo, which I was, in conjunction with the supplement it would stifle Pro-vaxa&#x27;s full capabilities.  </li>
      <li>I would like to say that my hair did get fuller and stayed full.</li>
      <li>Will give it a full six months before I make my mind up which vitamin I will continue with.</li>
      <li>Now I have a full head of hair again</li>
      <li>Biotin is the 2nd ingredient listed (hopefully it is a good shampoo).</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Me and my fiancee share the same account, I don&#x27;t write reviews often, but I had to share my experience with pro vaxa...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did 2 treatment, and did not notice any improvement.  I was very diligent with the 3 pills a day and never skipped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did not hurt either, but at this price, I was expecting more and I think this is actually just a scam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too bad, but I cannot recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m finishing up my first bottle, and I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised.  I didn&#x27;t expect much a few weeks in, but I realized this week that I don&#x27;t need to fill in vacant areas in my eyebrows.  I purchased this product out of worry about my disappearing eyebrows, thinning eyelashes and thinning hair.  I&#x27;m jaded about over the top about unjustified claims, but thought I&#x27;d try this product for a little while anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happily surprised to have such have a good result so quickly!  I look forward to more improvements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  I just ordered yet another 3 bottles.  I was so pleased with my eyebrows returning to their former state that I forgot about the thinning at my temples.  Well, for good reason - it&#x27;s gone!  I also switched to the recommended shampoo, and I love it.  My hair is curly and can become frizzy and dry, so I&#x27;ve used a lot of products to control it.  Not any more!  My hair is so soft without even needing conditioner that my stylist commented on its great condition and how pretty it is now. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My son has started using pro-vaxa as well.  He was shedding quite a bit and receding at the temples even though only in his early 20&#x27;s.  It&#x27;s still early days, but the hair loss seems to have stopped.</li>
    <li> I have been watching the NBA Finals and can&#x27;t help but notice Manu Ginobli&#x27;s bald spot. This is mainly because I am quickly resembling him. Over the last 2 or 3 years I have been noticing my hair getting thinner, but in the past year especially, I have been shedding a lot with scalp itching. As of today, after doing some research, I would say according to the savin scale, I have a savin mid pattern 3 or maybe 4, where I have hair loss, thinning, and a bald spot quickly emerging around the mid-top portion of my scalp. I found Provaxa through Amazon, read the reviews, and decided to give it a shot. This was 2 months ago and I am now done with 2 bottles. For the 1st 45 days I took 1 pill in the morning, 1 in the afternoon, and 1 at night, but for the past 2 weeks I have taken all 3 at once. In addition, for the past month I have used a topical spironolactone lotion called G5 and alternated between Nizoral shampoo and a scalp energizing shampoo while also using a Revivogen thickening conditioner. I have not stopped shedding, the itching is more subdued, and the mid-top portion of my scalp continues to get thinner and thinner. Although there is not a slick bald spot yet, there are few strands of hair in small areas and I seem to still be losing hair. I will say my hair seems to be a little thicker, but i&#x27;d like to see the shedding stop. A week ago I added Tricomin therapy spray to my regimen as I have read it helps with scalp irritation and hair re-growth. I am going to use the last bottle of provaxa as it says it can take up to 90 days to see results, but wanted to post this review for some perspective as most other reviewers were Dr. Carlson&#x27;s clients and seem to be raving about how it was almost a miracle cure after 30 days or so. This product is expensive as well so I hope I start re-growing some hair in the next month or I have a decision to make as to whether to continue with the product or not. As of now, I give this 3 stars, I&#x27;ll update in a month. I&#x27;m hoping togive it 5 stars like the rest of the reviewers did!</li>
    <li> Just received the nicest surprise from Dr. Carlson – a free bottle of Provaxa and what great timing. I’ve been taking it for 3 months with fabulous results.  I’m a 61 year old female and about a year ago,  my hair started falling out. If I ran my fingers through my hair, I found strands in my fingers.  I found hair on the floor, in the shower and my brushes. It’s fine and thin and my hairdresser was growing alarmed.  I found Provaxa on Amazon and bought it because a medical doctor formulated it.  That mattered to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So here’s my results which are outstanding.  I had hair loss at the top and temple area. My hair line had receded so much not even bangs could cover it. After the first month, shedding stopped and crossed my fingers this was going to work. Then the second month could see very faint “peach fuzz” growing back in.  Just finished the third month and my hair dresser says new growth is about l/2 inch long. My normally thin and fine hair now has body, shinny and feels so healthy. In 61 years, I’ve never had hair like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the most caring doctor.  I sent a few questions through his site and he replied.  I see he’s replying here, too.  I don’t understand comments left from people complaining about other products they tried that did not work yet they haven’t tried Provaxa? With all the gimmick products out there, this one has a guarantee and it’s the only one that does. What more could you ask for?</li>
    <li> Its been 2 months and 1 day and i still do not see any type of change in my hair growth. No change at all. same hair loss(not much but same).I had a lot of itching earlier on periodically and then it stopped. I have been taking  3 pills every day and did not miss a single day. Rating this 2 currently ..still fingers crossed..spending approximately 120$ will hurt if there is no change at all.i still hope it will work seeing all those reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update:-Had a nice chat with Lois. she explained what all i was doing wrong. Will try once again now. More hopeful after chat with Lois.</li>
    <li> I am a long-time satisfied Pro-vaxa user of about 9 months.  I started buying this from Dr. Carlson’s office before it was available on Amazon.  I tried many different products none of which helped at all.  Pro-vaxa stopped my hair loss and thinning.  Growth was going so good, reduced capsules to 2 a day without any change.  Then to 1 a day with no adverse affect.  Provaxa is the real deal and recommend anyone going through hair loss to get this product.</li>
    <li> This is my second order so I am now going on four months and have not seen much improvement.  I was taking another hair vitamin from Natural Well Being which I think might actually work better. Will give it a full six months before I make my mind up which vitamin I will continue with.</li>
    <li> I had originally posted a review on how I finished the 3rd bottle without seeing any results. I received a call from a very pleasant lady named Lois. I had said I have been using Provaxa along with other products (nioxin shampoo and conditioner and the Igrow laser) designed for thinning hair. She told me that I have been using products and shampoos that would further cause the loss of hair due to the chemicals present in them. She said they have found that once people stopped using those other solutions with provaxa and took Provaxa on its own, results started happening. She was so sure this would work, and even sent me a a free bottle to get me going again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could not ask for a more pleasant conversation. Lois seemed like she cared about the concerns I had, and had knowledge of how this works. I was begining think this just doesn&#x27;t work on me, but she told me that only a handful of people out of the thousands who tried provaxa didn&#x27;t receive results, and that was because they had some other underlying medical condtion. I am going to give this another shot and will use Lois&#x27; instructions. Use a simple biotin shampoo and proxaxa, that&#x27;s it.&lt;br /&gt;I am giving this 5 stars right now just because of the follow ups Lois has given me and the care they seem to have with my hair loss. I will report back in a month or so to tell of the results</li>
    <li> Feel like I fell for some misleading reviews on this one, didn&#x27;t help me a bit and was a waste of money for me.</li>
    <li> i think it&#x27;s a good produce that&#x27;s why it cost so much but it doesn&#x27;t work for my sister&lt;br /&gt;maybe the produce works on certain people only not my sister.</li>
    <li> Complete waste of money. I bought this because of all the great reviews. I&#x27;m now on the last of three three bottles and no change whatsoever. My hair is still dropping off in clumps with every brush stroke. Only change is that my nails grow faster, but that&#x27;s not the reason why I bought such an expensive item. I&#x27;ll probably go to Costco and buy the big bottle of vitamins for hair and nails and try that. Much cheaper and will probably get the same (hopefully better) results.</li>
    <li> If you want a product that really works, this is it.  I&#x27;m a 33 year old guy who had a premature receding hairline and overall thinning. I was looking a lot older than my years and started searching hair loss solutions.  Read about side effects with some products and found Provaxa hair loss vitamins about four months ago.  I took photos before I began and recently took more to see how much my hairline changed.  Big, big difference.  I’ll try to upload them here from my phone.  I got very quick results seeing hair sprouts the first month.  Just finishing month 4 and my hairline has filled in with about an inch or more of growth. Got a nice gift of a free bottle of Provaxa and another supplement Dr. Carlson created called Stop-It that stops sugar cravings.  That’s a good product, too.  I&#x27;ll take Provaxa forever to avoid looking older than my years from a receding hairline. Highly recommend this great product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not noticing those big changes that everyone is claiming to notice...I&#x27;m at the end of my 2nd month, maybe not enough to see results, I&#x27;d be curious to see what would happen if I stopped taking it. If it has not improved my situation, at least it is keeping it stable, which means I&#x27;m not getting any worse. I still have 2 months to go, hope to be able to add one or two stars at the end of the 4th month! But I&#x27;d give it a try, we&#x27;re not all the same and there are always people who don&#x27;t see benefits and people who do. At least it&#x27;s natural and has no side effects (on me, at least). I also have to say I&#x27;m following a diet (very healthy, but not eating much) and I lost 10 pounds in the past 2 months, so definitely this has to considered as well when it comes to hair loss, even if I&#x27;ve had it for many years...</li>
    <li> It took about 3 to 4 months for it to work for me but I&#x27;m beginning to see substantial hair growth on crown and hairline. The people at pro vaxa are very helpful and show great concern they even sent me a months supply for free, thank you  Going to stick with the program.</li>
    <li> After third month it&#x27;s showing tendency of hair growing back.&lt;br /&gt;Will update again after 4th month.&lt;br /&gt;the coupon for 99% discount is really worth</li>
    <li> Too expensive and doesn&#x27;t work</li>
    <li> This product works and I&#x27;ve even been using it wrong.  It does take a couple of months, so be patient and consistent.</li>
    <li> I ordered 3 months worth to give the product a fair chance.  I really wanted it to work; however, my hair has continued to thin and it didn&#x27;t do anything.  Must not work for everyone.</li>
    <li> It appears that I have almost stopped completely loosing hair while taking the 3 vitamin pills a day and when I had to stop taking them due to a surgery, I began loosing lots of hair and upon taking the vitamins again, the hair loss again has almost stopped completely. I did discover that it does take the 3 vitamin pills a day to control the hair loss, and, I am hoping that new hair will eventually grow back and thicken-up, however,  I have not been on the program too awfully long at this point.  I am very satisfied with the product at this point...and will continue ordering it.</li>
    <li> This is my second order of Provaxa and just finished my 4th month. Last month Dr. Carlson sent a free bottle with a little note thanking me for being a customer and giving Provaxa a try. Well, I have to thank him!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair loss began over a year ago. I have horses and spend most of the day in the heat around the barn and riding. It means that I wash my hair twice a day and at first thought that was causing hair loss. I thought it was shampoo and tried all the organics but my hair kept shedding. I went to see my doctor who did blood work and found that my body was converting testosterone into DHT and DHT was blocking hair follicles causing hair loss. This seems to be more common in men that have pattern balding but it happens in women, too. My doctor recommended Provaxa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As it was explained to me, my hair was able to grow again because Provaxa blocks DHT production. I had large thinning spots across the crown area, temple and overall my hair was thin and limp. I can’t see the top but my hairdresser says there’s great hair growth there and I see it in the temples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got Provaxa about 8 months ago but was not consistent taking it. Life got in the way and honestly didn’t have much hope. I took it hit and miss and of course not much happened. About 4 months ago got serious about taking it daily putting it next to my coffee pot in the morning. Not only do I have new hair growth, my hair has gone from limp and thin to having weight and body. I am very happy with Provaxa plus I know it’s helping with testosterone problem. Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I used Pro-vaxa faithfully, everyday for three months and I did not notice any changes in my hair.  I continue to lose lots of hair daily.  I had high hopes for this product but I am very disappointed in the results.  Since this product is not cheap don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Please don&#x27;t use this, if you have acid reflux. It will cause Chest Pain or terrible acid reflux. I am so disappointed, I had to stop using it.</li>
    <li> I have been using PRO-VÄXA for many months, as have my patients.  As the owner of Evizion Medical in Tampa, Florida, an anti-aging clinic, I greatly appreciate products designed and formulated to actually provide results for patients. All of Dr. Carlson&#x27;s products are impeccably created based on the latest research producing outstanding results for patients. PRO-VÄXA is one such product.&lt;br /&gt;At 28, my hair was thin and wispy along the bottom at shoulder length. After 6 weeks of taking PRO-VÄXA, it has thickened greatly and I can now grow it quite long down my back. It is luxuriant and radiant. In our younger female patients between the ages of 25 and 35, these young women want hair as thick as a model and after taking PRO-VÄXA for a short time, they are ecstatic they now have thick hair that genetics may have denied them. In our female patients 40 and older, many complained of premature hair loss finding clumps in the bathtub.&lt;br /&gt;For these women, their hair stopped shedding, their fears about balding abated and all are happy with the results. I would highly recommend PRO-VÄXA to any man or woman who is losing their hair or who wants thicker, more luxurious hair. Be patient with it. Some had results quite quickly while others took a few months.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad to see Dr. Carlson added phone calls with him to get support and questions added at [...]  That&#x27;s very helpful and I know my patients will appreciate that.&lt;br /&gt;Kathleen Vaes, Envizion Medical, Tampa, Florida, anti-aging clinic, [...]&lt;br /&gt;I wrote my review months ago but its Oct 2013 and we continue to get reorders from patients who have had success and continue to swear by this product.</li>
    <li> I have been taking Pro-vaxa for the past 3 months.  I have seen a great reduction in hair loss but no noticeable re-growing.  Before ordering another 90 day supply, I decided to reach out to Pro-Vaxa for confirmation of a review I recently read.  The review indicated that by using Nioxin shampoo, which I was, in conjunction with the supplement it would stifle Pro-vaxa&#x27;s full capabilities.  I noticed a company web address at the bottom of the bottle and sent an email.  Within 30 minutes I received a friendly response asking me to call to discuss my experience.  So, I called.  Like the other Amazon user I spoke with Lois and WOW!  Not only was she extremely friendly she was very informative.  According to Lois by using products like Nioxin (Rogaine, Propecia) I was interfering with their supplement.  She suggested using Mill Creek Biotin Shampoo with Peppermint and thought I would likely see the results I was hoping for.  However, Lois also warned me that I should not expect results overnight and that I needed to give it time.  I agreed, after all the thinning of my hair has been an ongoing problem for the past 15 years.  If there is any hope of this product working I would be beyond grateful and fully willing to continue its use.  I ordered another 90-day supply as well as the recommended shampoo and hope to post a follow-up review soon with exciting results.  - Paul</li>
    <li> This is a fraud, complete waste of your money, time and hope. DO NOT BUY.</li>
    <li> Subject line:  43 year old male with hair loss from diet&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 43 year old male who never had hair loss problems until the last few months when I noticed more than usual falling out during shower and combing my hair.  I read the reviews, the Provaxa Guide that comes with it and bought Biotin shampoo.  Decided to take six capsules a day for 2 weeks to get a jump start.  Zero side effects.  Shedding stopped within a few weeks so I got a handle on this before more loss came. I was on a diet for a few months and I’ve read that creates hair thinning and loss.  Very happy with the quality of this product and the great Guide that comes with it.</li>
    <li> I am a 45 yr old man.  I began to notice shedding of my hair 6 or 7 months ago.  The area of shedding were mostly the front and the  side.  I have been taking this product about 5 months.  I would say the recovery of my hair is still in progress.  Now is mostly filled up approximately 80% prior to my hair loss.  Hair shedding stopped after a week taking this product and remaining 20% of hair loss is still mostly on the front.  Now I have more hair than ever before.  One side effect is that you get some type of pimples(?) once in a while, but it&#x27;s not a major problem.</li>
    <li> Ordered an initial 3-month supply of Pro-vaxa a few months ago, and took it diligently exactly as instructed. After only a few weeks, I noticed my hair looked thicker and shinier- and I felt it was more than just a placebo effect in such a short time. I imagine it was probably the much needed vitamins going to work in strengthening and thickening the hair I had (left). However, after 3 months of using Pro-Vaxa, I didn&#x27;t find any new hair growth, and officially checking about a month or so after I stopped, I am not sure whether I retained any of those benefits from the first month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I&#x27;m willing to give it another shot. So I reordered another 3 months and will be paying closer attention this time in terms of before and after and new hair growth.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s surprising to see most of the reviews for this product are very recent and all 5 star. Being objective and perhaps somewhat sceptical I would expect some variation in feedback but clearly not in this case. Additionally all reviewers, with the exception of one, do not have a review history of any other products and I could not locate any reviews of this product (through a google search) on any other site or forum either. However taking the present feedback at face value, this product obviously provides a long awaited balding cure so I am thinking of purchasing it for my father as it&#x27;s his birthday very soon and most importantly he&#x27;s already bald. Watch out all the hair specialists out there, your days of playing on peoples anxieties are numbered!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s I have also given this product a 5* rating in line with other reviews. Can&#x27;t wait to start going to Toni and Guy with my father for hair cuts and styling :)</li>
    <li> My balding started on my crown as well as thinning channels moving towards the front. I have been searching for a natural solution for years, having researched the usual pharmaceutical solutions and discovering numerous side effects. I came across Pro-Vaxa and gave it a shot  Within 60 days of using Pro-Vaxa, I noticed more hair density in the thinning areas. After 90 days there was a significant difference, as the thinning areas were fillimg back in. I also noticed my hair looked healthier and less brittle. Provaxa is a fabulous product without any side effects because it’s all natural. I highly recommend this product!  Ray T, Sarasota, FL</li>
    <li> My hair is growing back. This is a great product! Thank you Dr. Carlson.&lt;br /&gt;I take more than they recommend, but bottom line... My hair is very important to me,&lt;br /&gt;As I am a hair stylist.  Great job!</li>
    <li> It may be unfair of me to rate only 4 stars because the product works very well.  I am mixed race, and my hair is naturally curly.  It almost immediately reduced the amount of fall out and  my hair grew from the middle of my back, to my waist!  However, it did not make my hair thicker.  Again, this may be unfair because I did not follow the instructions.  I used up all bottles in 5 months, not 3.  My first order was in May 2013.  Today is Dec. 1, 2013 and I just re-ordered.  I have confidence in this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this supplement for my husband for thinning hair/bald spots, and we didn&#x27;t see any noticeable changes for 3 months. Contacted customer service for the money back guarantee, and they were extremely polite and helpful, they called my husband, talked to him about his meds and offered a free 2 month supply, because he was on statins, and statins deplet the body and we were told that it might take a little longer for it to work. Thanfully his Dr. agreed to wean him off the meds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So after almost 5 months on the supplement we can finally see changes, his bald spot is growing new baby hair, where it was almost shiny from having no hair at all! Yes, it did take a while for it to work, maybe due to the meds he was on, but it&#x27;s finally working, I just ordered another 3 month supply and will continue purchasing the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for the excellent customer service you&#x27;ve provided and for helping us not give up on the supplement and helping us \\&quot;troubleshoot\\&quot; the possible problems (yes, they call you and talk about your habits, meds, history, etc..).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TL;DR: It works, be patient, great service, buy!</li>
    <li> My hair began thinning about 5 years ago at 45.  My hair brushes were full of lost hair and I’d find clumps in the shower.  I began using Prov-axa per Dr. Carlson’s instructions 3 months ago.  By the end of the first month, my hair stopped falling out.  By the second month, my hair felt thicker and softer. It had become brittle and dry. I just finished the third month and buying another 90 days. I am so happy with this product! For all women, of any age, who want hair like their teens back, Provaxa will give you that.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t work wasted a money don&#x27;t buy</li>
    <li> Here is my review starting from 23 July 2013:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;23 July 2013: Received my Order of Pro-Vaxa today. Took all three pills at once (with food), hopefully what I experienced was coincidental but I ended up having terrible bowel cramps followed by a nasty case of Diarrhea. Will post if this happens again, or if it happens again, I&#x27;ll switch to one pill at a time 3 times a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;14 Aug 2013: 22 days in, no change. I get slight stomach irritation if I take all three without a meal. No stomach irritation when taken with plenty of water and food. I take all three in the morning before breakfast. Still have the same amount of fallout, and where I would have expected my hair to at least thicken, it has not. I have not missed one day of the regimine. I am 3/4 the way through the first bottle: No visible effects yet. Gonna down grade my rating to 4 stars until I see some benefit of this supplement. Whoever the guy was that said don&#x27;t take if you have acid reflux. I have acid reflux, I take prilosec daily. I have noticed no adverse reaction to my acid reflux 3 weeks in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;21 Aug 2013: I am one dose away from finishing my first bottle. true to their word \\&quot;most people do not see a change before their 2nd month\\&quot;. I have not seen any change. My shower this morning yielded the largest shed count I can remember and was a little disconcerting. Although I have discontinued the nioxin shampoo for this my second day. I ordered a Biotin shampoo (Millcreek Biotin shampoo). Biotin is the 2nd ingredient listed (hopefully it is a good shampoo). I expect delivery in about 10 days (currently stationed in East Africa, ordering though APO/FPO). Will post another update in 1 month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;24 Aug 2013: I am trying to stay as subjective as I can with this treatment. I have lost confidence to even look into the mirror at myself. I comb my hair, but my confidence has faded and I have no strength to look at myself. For the last 2 days, I have noticed that my hair is fuller. I live in a very humid and windy area and you might know that humidity will flatten your hair, adding to your loss of confidence. Today, for the 2nd day in a row I have noticed that my hair has withstood the test of humidity and wind. My thinning is taking place at the peak of my widows peak and temple area. When I started this program I looked closely at the peak thinning area, and naturally grew sick looking at it. I&#x27;m at work and I realized it had been at least 30 days since looking at that widows peak balding area, I pulled the mirror from my drawer, and while it is still noticable, the balding appears to be much less pronounced. I wish now I had taken a picture 30 days ago. Managing expectation, I have also noticed a little less fallout in the sink and shower. The goal is to STOP the shedding first and PRAY for a miracle for regrowth, but god please stop this shedding. Progress? I certainly hope so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;30 Aug 2013: While the shedding has continued I have noiticed progress as the shedding has slowed. My hair is thicker and no longer flat and lifeless. It combs and styles well. Still seeing the shedding, but seeing less and having a fuller head of hair certainly helps&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10 Oct 2013: Shedding worsened after my last entry. I went back to using Nioxin shampoo as using the Biotin shampoo seemed to increase the shedding (made no sense). Been using the Nioxin shampoo for about the last 10 days and thankfully the shedding is slowing again. One huge benefit of Pro-Vaxa is my hair is stronger and fuller than ever. It withstands the element of the country I am in (really high winds and high humidity). My hair does not go flat anymore and seems to \\&quot;stay in place\\&quot; much easier than before and lasts all day. In Summary: I have not noticed any re-growth, the shedding has continued. I just placed an order for another 3 month supply, giving hope to the fact that maybe my body needs more time to process, (I do have a slow metabolism). I am reducing my rating to3 stars. After all the only benefit after nearly 3 full months of use is fuller hair. I can get that same benefit from one of MANY different (less expensive) hair loss products. Still have hope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;15 Nov: 4 months in and still no change. Shedding has continued and as of recently my hair has fallen flat again. This occured once I started taking the second order of Pro-Vaxa (4th bottle)? My hair is flat and un-managable, hard to style and getting very thin on top. I am reducing my rating to 2 stars and gonna say with some certainty at the 4 month mark, this product does not work for me. I will finish taking the product but it has been rather ineffective for me. I will continue to post my results until I have finished the product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;24 Jan 2014: 6 months, almost finished with the sixth bottle of Provaxa. I will not purchase anymore, it did nothing for me. Shedding continued, no new growth. Don&#x27;t let my review sway your decision, it may work for you. It did not however, work for me. I would like to say that my hair did get fuller and stayed full. I will switch to a less expensive product to maintain the fullness, but for the shedding and regrowth? It did not work for me. Good luck to you</li>
    <li> Have already gone through 3 month supply. So far, have not really seen any change. I&#x27;m hoping its just a slow process because I just purchased another 3 months. It will be a real disappointment not to mention a huge waste of money if this doesn&#x27;t work! Not sure how to get money back guarantee if it doesn&#x27;t work</li>
    <li> Started using it a few weeks ago.so far no side effects.the product has lots of positive reviews on amazon.Hope it works!</li>
    <li> Been using Provaxa for a little over three months now. Just bought another order. There may have been some improvement so far, but if so, it&#x27;s been much too negligible to say for sure. Very hopeful that things will start visibly improving in the fourth and following months as several reviewers have stated. I&#x27;m 27 with a receding hairline that&#x27;s only recently begun to get worse, and I&#x27;ve been using the recommended biotin shampoo along with Provaxa since August. I have not been using any other medication, topical or otherwise. As for the company, they&#x27;ve been very professional and dependable!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** Update:  After nine months of use, I have sadly not seen any further improvement than was made after the first four months. Any improvement was very minimal, however, and I sadly feel as though I am beginning to loose again what little added thickness I&#x27;d developed. I&#x27;m going to continue use for now, but mainly because I&#x27;m scared it&#x27;ll get much worse now if I stop. The provaxa company was very helpful in the beginning, and it appears many people have had success, so I guess maybe it&#x27;s just me.</li>
    <li> I was very hopeful with this product. Especially after seeing all of the positive reviews. After closer inspection of the positive reviews, it appeared that they were most likely fake. But I was optimistic, and so, bought the 3 month set. I followed the usage religiously, taking a pill every four hours 3 per day. Now that the last bottle is gone I can come back here and give you my results... This product is bogus. It is no better (but worse) than taking some of the GNC vitamins like saw palmetto and biotin. I noticed no improvement from using this product. I had better luck just taking the Biotin and Saw Palmetto by themselves. Do not waste your money on this BS product.</li>
    <li> Great company. Wonderful customer service.&lt;br /&gt;Hair has stopped falling out, haven&#x27;t noticed any new growth yet but have only been using for a not quite 2 months.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend.</li>
    <li> For Regen &amp; Regrowth i was looking for a natural solution. Each capsule includes vitamins B6 &amp; B12, Iodine, magnesium, Selenium, Horsetail Extract, &amp; Green tea... Buy it Try it. Cheers!</li>
    <li> I just finished day 83 of taking Provaxa.  I have not missed a day and have taken exactly as recommended.  To date I see literally no noticeable change.  I was very hopeful in the beginning and really held out hope that suddenly it would start working until a week or so ago.  While I will finish the last seven days out of principle, I see no reason to think this will start working now.  Very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update.  Lois is working with me.  Very attentive.  trying to make this work.  A plus for customer service. We will see what happens...they are providing 90 day supply for free.</li>
    <li> I like getting emails from Visio Elan with updates and tips.  It&#x27;s still too early to tell, but hopefully I&#x27;ll get to see some results soon after the first bottle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for many months and first noticed after month 1 that my hair had stopped falling out in the shower. Over the next month, I noticed that I had so many flyaways not even my hair stylist could help me tame them! That&#x27;s a good thing -- no, THAT&#x27;S AMAZING! Instead of battling the daily hair-loss grief, I was finally dealing with NEW GROWTH! My hair has not yet reached its original thickness (I&#x27;m not sure it can be expected), but it continues to grow like crazy and hair loss has stopped almost completely. The new hair growth is very thin and, in my experience, is much lighter than normal. Some might call that color &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;gray,&amp;#34; but I don&#x27;t like to use bad words. Almost all of the hair products that promise new growth warn of this. Rome wasn&#x27;t built in a day, I guess, but this product offers a little bit of hope. And the good news is that with continued use, hair may come back in thicker and with color.  *** THESE INGREDIENTS OFFER SO MANY OVERALL HEALTH BENEFITS! *** It took me a lot of time and effort to research them individually, and here they are in one synergistic formulation! I would recommend that you research the many positive benefits this product offers in addition to hair growth! This is truly an amazing combination and well worth the money! It could possibly replace several others you&#x27;re currently taking. I don&#x27;t think a product label is shared here, so I&#x27;m adding one to my review. There are many awesome ingredients in this product that are of note: Vitamin B6 2.5 mg Vitamin B12 250 mcg Biotin 2500mcg Iodine 75 mcg Magnesium 125 mg Zinc 12.5 mg Selenium 37.5 mcg Saw Palmetto Berry 750 mg Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) 350 mg Horsetail Extract 250 mg Betasiterol 200 mg Green Tea (leaf) 37.5 mg  Dosage is 3 capsules and each bottle contains 90 capsules.  IMPORTANT: It is of utmost importance to note that if you do not see results with this product, you may need to address another underlying health condition. This is not a miracle treatment for hormonal issues or a thyroid condition, but in conjunction with therapies for those conditions, it will help your hair! And while I have to say &amp;#34;not a miracle&amp;#34; -- when you&#x27;ve lost hope, it sure feels like one! Some negative reviews note there were no results. In these cases, there is probably something else going on. I would recommend that you look to the information you can find through Dr. Carlson&#x27;s protocols (on Provaxa website and his other social media). There are several books I could recommend to match up your symptoms to possible causes, but if you start on Provaxa or pick up a Suzanne Somers book as reference, you&#x27;ll be at a good starting point.  For those who are still reading and are interested, I&#x27;m a female (not 30, but not 50, wink, wink) and was experiencing adrenal fatigue, hormonal imbalances and thyroid issues. My hair loss started in my late 30s and continued for several years before I found relief. It is heartbreaking, as a woman, to see your hair thinning and falling out in front of your eyes! And I&#x27;ve talked to so many other women experiencing the same symptoms! Most of us identify so strongly with the idea of having long, lush hair, it can make us feel depressed and ashamed to go through this process! This product and the info I found through Dr. Carlson (who I found through reference in Suzanne Somers books) provided relief and hope I needed. I searched for years for a solution to my problems!   I don&#x27;t think you should discount anyone&#x27;s personal review (in terms of those who did not have success), but I would recommend in your own search to dig deeper into the symptoms you are experiencing. If you have addressed the underlying conditions and want to have your hair back, this is ***THE*** product you need to have!</li>
    <li> I just want to say how grateful I am to be included in Dr. Carlson’s clinical study for PRO-VÄXA. I’m glad to see it’s now on Amazon and I just purchased more!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to Dr. Carlson for developing this wonderful supplement, PRO-VÄXA. It is absolutely amazing! I had only been taking it for a month when my hair stylist asked what I had been doing and commented on how much my hair had growth . Then good friends came to stay for spring break from up north who had not seen me in approximately 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They couldn’t believe how much my hair had grown and the condition was much shiner and so healthy they said to me several times. Also I know you said it would help my nails, I have never had long nails and at 44 years old and my nails are stronger and longer than they have ever been naturally. Please tell all your patients about this as it is so incredible! Thank you.</li>
    <li> How many ways to say thank you to Dr. Carlson?  I go to an anti-aging clinic and the owner knew Dr. Carlson.  She recommended Provaxa.  It&#x27;s my understanding Dr. Carlson developed this for his private patients and other medical professionals.  Even knowing that, I didn&#x27;t have great expectations. I was somewhat resigned to my hair falling out.  Now I have a full head of hair again and it&#x27;s soft, lots of volume and luxuriant.  Just follow the instructions and be sure to take 3 capsules a day.</li>
    <li> I’ve been taking this for 6 months and all I can say is, Pro-Vaxa is fabulous!  As others wrote, I’ve gone the gambit trying numerous hair growth products with very little success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I felt really good about Provaxa because a doctor developed it plus higher concentrations of vitamins and herbs than any other product on the market.  Maybe that’s why it’s so powerful.  What I noticed the first month was my hair stopped shedding. Next month my barber said  he saw new hair growth at the crown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The crown area and channels had very few strands of hair left.  The third month brought more hair and it became thicker and fuller.  Every month thereafter hair growth was better and better. Thumbs up for this product and Dr. Rob whose a great doctor!</li>
    <li> My hair was falling out greatly and that’s stopped.  I’ve been using Provaxa for 3 – 4 months and my hair is thicker.  I have 2 patients that have been on Provaxa for 30 – 45 days that are very happy with results, too. I am very happy with Provaxa and recommend it to all my patients with hair loss. Dr. William Meadows, Bradenton, FL</li>
    <li> Just bought it today: June 17, 2013...Will give you guys an update to see if this thing works! It says money back guarantee if it doesn&#x27;t work after 90 days. So many reviews here with 5 stars and reviews I found somewhere else but were same exact reviews provided for this product. I&#x27;ll give you guys monthly updates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John, Seattle WA...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;This THING doesn&#x27;t working!! Money back guarantee? I&#x27;d ton think so...never got my money back...STAY away!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a year without any good results. In my opinion, it&#x27;s a WAY overpriced vitamin that made my hair healthy, but did not make it grow back.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 27 and have been struggling with hair loss since I was 21. I&#x27;ve tried prophecies, rogaine, dht blocking shampoos and all that claimed to work. It didn&#x27;t. Actually got side effects from most of em and still continued shedding. I&#x27;ve been working with Lois and provaxa for 6 months now. Provaxa instantly helped with the shedding right away but never actually stopped it. I was encouraged to see a dermatologist by Lois and I&#x27;m so glad I did!!! They found that I had dermatitis which I actually thought was taken care of by dermazinc I was using a few months ago. Nope. I was prescribed ketaconozole 2% shampoo and it has COMPLETELY stopped my shedding in conjunction of use with provaxa. I&#x27;m excited to see provaxa really start kicking in now as I know that with dermatitis, it has little to no chance of effectiveness in regrowth and shedding. THANK YOU LOIS for all the time and energy you&#x27;ve spent with me on this journey so far and if anyone is reading this, please go see a dermatologist as it will save you time, money, and hair. :)showered even with rough shampooing and conditioning. I couldn&#x27;t believe it. It finally worked. They say 60% of the battle is stopping the shedding, 40% is regrowth. Lois gave me all the support and confidence to stop taking propecia and stick with the provaxa. I threw away all those horrible pills and a few days later, and am on the road to recovery. I have Provaxa in the mail coming my way. (thanks for that Lois!)&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Carlson even took the time to talk to call me and give me great advice and direction on how to handle my situation. Since I stopped propecia, he gave me direction on what to do and what to expect. It was incredible talking to him! Thank you to Lois and Dr.Carlson for all the help and direction and if any one reading this has any question about this product, try it, its worth it. I promise. And for those who feel it didn&#x27;t work, you didn&#x27;t reach out to Lois. They will help and will truly care about you. THANK YOU LOIS, DR. CARLSON, AND PROVAXA!!!!!!</li>
