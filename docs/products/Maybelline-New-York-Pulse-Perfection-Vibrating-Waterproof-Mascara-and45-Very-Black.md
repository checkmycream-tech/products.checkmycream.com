<ol>
      <li>Another discontinued product, but was very happy to find on line.</li>
      <li>The best mascara EVER!</li>
      <li>Can not believe how great this mascara is!!  </li>
      <li>This stuff is AWESOME.</li>
      <li>but once you get the hang of it you end up with great looking lashes!</li>
      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>Thank you for one very incredible product.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t impressed at all with the vibrating thing</li>
      <li>This is the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>Was I ever impressed!  </li>
      <li>This is a really great product!</li>

      <li>The mascara and brush is that good!</li>
      <li>They are separated and beautiful</li>
      <li>It separated my lashes, defined them, and lengthened them beautifully.</li>
      <li>Excellent price, excellent buy, super recommended!</li>

      <li>LOVE IT!!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m totally satisfied with this product!!</li>
      <li>and I got an excellent price on my first purchase: $.01!!!</li>
      <li>and I had seen good reviews of it.  </li>
      <li>I thought the pulse feature would be a good way to separate my eyelashes</li>
      <li>but it does tend to clump your lashes together but gives them good length.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
      <li>many products like this out there, but this makes her happy</li>
      <li>It is clumpy and my $4.99 mascaras are better than this one!</li>
      <li>It has been discontinued and I just love it!</li>
      <li>is the first review I&#x27;ve ever submitted for Amazon even though I&#x27;ve been a member for years so that should tell you how impressed I am with this product.</li>
      <li>My eyelashes have never looked better!  </li>
      <li>LOVE IT!</li>
      <li>I love this mascara!</li>
      <li>There are better mascaras than this one out there ladies!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>After reading the reviews, I thought this mascara would be amazing.  </li>
      <li>Still on the search for an amazing mascara.</li>
      <li>I dont use the vibrating part often but it is a nice option.</li>
      <li>The best feature I like about this mascara is the vibration it really helps bring out all your lashes and separating them all.</li>
      <li>I have been on the hunt for a good waterproof mascara since Sallys&#x27; Beauty Supply quit carrying the waterproof mascara I had used for more than 10 years.</li>
      <li>Nice packaging retro look.</li>
      <li>If you buy this, make sure you have a good waterproof remover.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used every brand of mascara from the drug store to the high priced cosmetics sites and this is the best!</li>
      <li>I love the vibrating brush and the formula holds curl nicely.</li>
      <li>The wand is the newer kind - plastic \\&quot;combs\\&quot;, I love it.</li>
      <li>This is by far the best mascara ive ever used.</li>
      <li>Makes putting on mascara easy and makes eyelashes look longer!</li>
      <li>I ended up just using the mascara as regular non-pulsing mascara and found I really liked the brush- excellent lash separation and coverage.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great though for going to the beach and wearing super light makeup</li>
      <li>As a mascara, it&#x27;s ok.</li>
      <li>I bought the waterproof version last year and wasn&#x27;t as impressed.</li>
      <li>The formula is a consistency that lengthens and thickens without the slightest \\&quot;clumpy eyelash\\&quot; look (which I don&#x27;t find cute).  </li>
      <li>I Love This Product.</li>
      <li>The mascara is ok, but the vibrating brush isn&#x27;t all it&#x27;s cracked up to be.  </li>
      <li>Love this mascara - it is waterproof, flake-proof and stays on till you take it off.  </li>
      <li>Was able to sell them to a friend for a fraction of the price I bought them for.</li>
      <li>I love this mascara.</li>
      <li>:)  Separates your lashes from the root to the tip while covering them.  </li>
      <li>If you love mascara you will like to add this to your addition of mascaras..</li>
      <li>I have short lashes, and this separates and extends them wonderfully.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s been about 3 days and the mascara is mostly off.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>You will love it for sure</li>
      <li>This mascara is better than any I have ever used.</li>
      <li>as many as 4 coats!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love how it goes on-doesn&#x27;t clump or irritate my eyes.</li>
      <li>I bought more even though I didn&#x27;t use the pulse feature.</li>
      <li>I guess it&#x27;s ok for a mascara</li>
      <li>I love this mascara and the way it coats my lashes.</li>
      <li>maybe they&#x27;ll be able to use it.</li>
      <li>the vibrating wand achieves that goal of coating the lashes much better.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t have any problems with flaking or anything in the non-waterproof version and this one took a lot more effort to get off my lashes.</li>
      <li>Seems like if you have such a unique product you would make sure all parts of it were perfect.</li>
      <li>It clumped up more easily to the point I had to use a spoolie brush to separate my lashes.</li>
      <li>I was glad that it is still available.</li>
      <li>I will say that I received my shipment very quickly.  </li>
      <li>It does keep my lashes curled most of the day, but I spend more time wiping it off my eyelids than its worth.</li>
      <li>This was the first mascara I&#x27;ve ever tried, and at the time I really liked it.</li>
      <li>Excelente compra, super recomendada!    </li>
      <li>I am very pleased to find this particular item as the oscillating motion</li>
      <li>smooth gliding, none sticky .</li>
      <li>I just ordered 8 of these, with free shipping, through Amazon.</li>
      <li>It does separate and coat beautifully, and my lashes have never looked so clean, long and flattering.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s alright, nothing to get too excited about.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve since switched to Bare Minerals Flawless Definition mascara and it gives me the same (perhaps a bit better) beautifully lengthened and defined lashes that the non-waterproof version of this gave me, and with even less effort.</li>
      <li>I got this because I was intrigued by the claims that a vibrating mascara does something special to your lashes.</li>
      <li>I love how it looks when I put it on, makes my lashes nice and long looking.</li>
      <li>It just doesn&#x27;t make my lashes full at all.</li>
      <li>For those of you that like the look of full, separated, VIBErant (yah, I went there) eyelashes</li>
      <li>Definitely not bad though</li>
      <li>Now that I&#x27;ve grown up a little and realized that there were better mascaras out there than this one, I realized that this really isn&#x27;t a good mascara.</li>
      <li>I love the Maybelline New York Pulse Perfection Waterproof Mascara.  </li>
      <li>I first got in back in 2010 (before it was discontinued) in the non-waterproof version, and I absolutely loved it.</li>
      <li>really helps separate my fine lashes.</li>
      <li>The button to hold does take some getting used to, but it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
      <li>The button for the vibration was not hard to press as some reviews I had read led me to believe, I found it easy to manage.</li>
      <li>Shipped right away</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Decrease the price and I will think of buying it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;pulse\\&quot; feature is really unnecessary but the idea was good.  The mascara itself was fine, but shipping was WAY too expensive.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara and the way it coats my lashes. They look very full and long after using the product. I&#x27;ve used the Pulse Perfection Mascara before but not in waterproof. If I had it to do over again, I would order the non-waterproof version because this mascara does NOT come off. I&#x27;ve tried everything. It&#x27;s been about 3 days and the mascara is mostly off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I TOTALLY recommend the pulse perfection line, but not in waterproof.</li>
    <li> I just ordered 8 of these, with free shipping, through Amazon. Why? I can&#x27;t find this mascara ANYWHERE!!  I ran out and realized that my eyelashes looked horrible w/o it.  I&#x27;ve tried every &#x27;lash lengthening&#x27; and have found that if you use this pulse as your bottom layer, to get your eyelashes separated and the way you want them to go, then use Loreal&#x27;s Voluminous, you are set to go for the night!!  I know that this mascara is a little harder to get off, but it&#x27;s SO worth it, because it keeps your lashes exactly where you want them.  LOVE IT!!  I&#x27;m giving it a 10!!</li>
    <li> Estoy totalmente satisfecha con esta compra!! Esta máscara realmente es estupenda, el cepillo vibrador separa las pestañas y hace que se miren gigantescas! La amo! Para mejores resultados la debes pasar lentamente desde la raiz hacia la punta! Excelente compra, super recomendada!    I&#x27;m totally satisfied with this product!! This mascara it&#x27;s really something, the vibrating brush gets into your lashes, separates them and make them look GInormous! LOVE IT! Excellent price, excellent buy, super recommended!</li>
    <li> The vibrating feature actually works wonders! I was taught years ago by a make-up artist to wiggle the wand back and forth when putting mascara on...the vibrating wand achieves that goal of coating the lashes much better.  The formula is a consistency that lengthens and thickens without the slightest \\&quot;clumpy eyelash\\&quot; look (which I don&#x27;t find cute).  The price here can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
    <li> WOW!!  Finds every little lash and extends them OUT TO HERE!!  Lasts all day with relatively little smudging (I use the waterproof).  Ususally only takes one coat unlike others I&#x27;ve tried recently (as many as 4 coats!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first review I&#x27;ve ever submitted for Amazon even though I&#x27;ve been a member for years so that should tell you how impressed I am with this product. I have been searching for a replacement since my previous favorite (L&#x27;Oreal Lash Out) began to last about only 3 weeks before it ran out. I&#x27;ve tried at least 6 other brands/types with little dissapointing results and decided to try the Define-A-Lash on a whim because of the price and the novelty with relatively low expectations.  Wow!  Was I ever impressed!  I will definitely be stocking up!</li>
    <li> I am an active \\&quot;girly-girl\\&quot;- wouldn&#x27;t think about leaving the house without a little bit of mascara and some colored lip tint. I have been on the hunt for a good waterproof mascara since Sallys&#x27; Beauty Supply quit carrying the waterproof mascara I had used for more than 10 years. Love this stuff, and the fact that with the vibrating brush, I only need 1 coat. I will be stocking up.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews, I thought this mascara would be amazing.  It&#x27;s alright, nothing to get too excited about.  Definitely not bad though</li>
    <li> Not real sure what the buzz is about this mascara.  I guess it&#x27;s ok for a mascara but it does tend to clump your lashes together but gives them good length.  I wasn&#x27;t impressed at all with the vibrating thing and it was just irritating and clumsy to use. I wouldn&#x27;t get it again.</li>
    <li> I have very thin lashes and this mascara lengthens fine but i was hoping for a mascara to thicken my lashes as well. It just doesn&#x27;t make my lashes full at all.</li>
    <li> This was the first mascara I&#x27;ve ever tried, and at the time I really liked it. Now that I&#x27;ve grown up a little and realized that there were better mascaras out there than this one, I realized that this really isn&#x27;t a good mascara. First of all I really don&#x27;t know what the purpose of making a vibrating mascara is. It didn&#x27;t do anything for it. The formula was dry and clumpy. There are better mascaras than this one out there ladies!</li>
    <li> This mascara is better than any I have ever used. The vibrating brush really gets in between the lashes to fill them out to their max. I&#x27;ve had problems with waterproof mascara flaking throughout the day, but not this one. Thank you for one very incredible product. I can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore, so thank you Amazon for enabling me to purchase this once again. I was so happy to find it that I bought three.</li>
    <li> This was my first purchase through Amazon, and I purchased more of the same item from two different vendors and both delivered as promised.  I am very pleased to find this particular item as the oscillating motion really helps separate my fine lashes.</li>
    <li> I got this because I was intrigued by the claims that a vibrating mascara does something special to your lashes. It doesn&#x27;t. I&#x27;ve found that this works exactly like every other mascara, and the vibrating wand is little more than a distraction. As a mascara, it&#x27;s ok. It&#x27;s not my favorite mascara, but it works just as well as any other standard mascara. I&#x27;d compare it to Maybelline&#x27;s Great Lash in terms of quality, I was just disappointed that the vibrating action is so useless.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best mascara ive ever used.I hope Maybline is not planning on discontinuing this Mascara. I dont use the vibrating part often but it is a nice option.</li>
    <li> This stuff is AWESOME. But it&#x27;s A pain in the butt to remove....it&#x27;s really waterproof! If you buy this, make sure you have a good waterproof remover. Some of my lashes fell out</li>
    <li> I recommend it hard to find in stores tear resistant And almost water proof. buy it does what it says. If you love mascara you will like to add this to your addition of mascaras..</li>
    <li> I love this mascara! Makes putting on mascara easy and makes eyelashes look longer! I use the waterproof and it stays on until you want it to come off!</li>
    <li> This is a waterproof mascara which is very hard to get off even with soap put right on it. It leaves smudges on the bottom of my eye and takes me at night and in the shower in the morning washing my face to get it off... The vibrating brush really does nothing but move a little, and where the button is located at its hard to keep it pushed down while applying. I will not buy again.</li>
    <li> I love the Maybelline New York Pulse Perfection Waterproof Mascara.  I cannot find it anywhere in stores around where I live.  It goes on without clumping and does not smear under my eyes, and stays on all day.</li>
    <li> Can not believe how great this mascara is!!  My eyelashes have never looked better!  They are separated and beautiful I hope this product is not discontinued and I will be ordering more!!</li>
    <li> Was looking forward to using this product and I had seen good reviews of it.  However, the product I received was dried out and unusable.  I reported this to Amazon, which processed my refund promptly.</li>
    <li> The best mascara EVER! It defines, seperates, lengthens and KEEPS THE CURL! I&#x27;ve tried ALOT of different mascaras and occasionally still keep trying mascaras...none ever measure up! BUT this has been discontinued in stores(can not figure out why) which is why i purchase on Amazon...I&#x27;ve re-ordered this product at least 5 times now...I definately recommend Very Black...i&#x27;ve tried &#x27;blackest black&#x27; and it seems to be a different formula....when i curled my lashes and applied&#x27;blackest black&#x27; -the curl didnt stay! BUT &#x27;Very Black&#x27; waterproof Pulse Perfection</li>
    <li> Ever since this first came out I have been hooked on it.  easy to apply, makes your lashes look full, long and natural. Vibrating mechanism lasts the entire time mascara is available. Great product too bad it is so hard to find.</li>
    <li> Great product! Great smell , smooth gliding, none sticky . Surprisingly long lasting. Nice packaging retro look. You will love it for sure</li>
    <li> sorry this has been discontinued?</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Not able to find it anywhere in stores anymore - so was glad to find it on Amazon.  Take a bit of getting used to if you&#x27;re a fist time user of the vibrating application handle, but let me reiterate...I Love This Product. :)  Separates your lashes from the root to the tip while covering them.  For those of you that like the look of full, separated, VIBErant (yah, I went there) eyelashes then this is the mascara for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note: The waterproof version definitely is waterproof - you&#x27;ll need a makeup remover to thoroughly clean it from your lashes</li>
    <li> Purchased 10 waterproof maybelline vibrating mascaras and got the right brand, but wrong product. I got regular that only makes your lashes weigh down heavy. It was too late to return since I opened one without realizing.  Was able to sell them to a friend for a fraction of the price I bought them for. I don&#x27;t realize how you can send that many of the wrong product??</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see the advantage of having a vibration when putting on mascara.  This mascara was clumpy. I had to separate my lashes after putting them on. It just looked very unnatural.</li>
    <li> This is a &#x27;meh&#x27; mascara. I first got in back in 2010 (before it was discontinued) in the non-waterproof version, and I absolutely loved it. It separated my lashes, defined them, and lengthened them beautifully. I bought the waterproof version last year and wasn&#x27;t as impressed. It clumped up more easily to the point I had to use a spoolie brush to separate my lashes. Removing it was a pain too. I didn&#x27;t have any problems with flaking or anything in the non-waterproof version and this one took a lot more effort to get off my lashes. The one downside both had in common was that the battery died before I ran out of the mascara. I&#x27;ve since switched to Bare Minerals Flawless Definition mascara and it gives me the same (perhaps a bit better) beautifully lengthened and defined lashes that the non-waterproof version of this gave me, and with even less effort.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d like to give it a 5 because it is everything I wanted in a vib mascara wand. But you can&#x27;t just change the battery when this one is exhausted. The battery is recyclable but big whup everything else goes in the trash. I am going to try to put in a new batt when the time comes though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mascara formula is very disappointing. Regular ol&#x27; clumpy. Seems like if you have such a unique product you would make sure all parts of it were perfect. Oh well. I&#x27;m going to buy a different mascara and use this wand with it. I&#x27;m eventually going to try Lancome&#x27;s vib mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have arthritis and fibromyalgia and I thought that this product would ease the trouble I normally have w/mascara application. It does. It&#x27;s like 2-3 seconds and the first coat is done. Yay! Also, I don&#x27;t have to hold my eye open so far for so long to apply - that helps me too. I can&#x27;t use this on my lower lashes because they&#x27;re too little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It tickles at first but I am getting used to it. The wand is the newer kind - plastic \\&quot;combs\\&quot;, I love it.</li>
    <li> Another discontinued product, but was very happy to find on line. many products like this out there, but this makes her happy</li>
    <li> Esta mascara para cílios é muito boa. Tem ótima durabilidade e realmente define bem os cílios.

O custo-benefício desta máscara torna este produto essencial na bolsa de qualquer mulher. Mascara de custo baixo e com PERFEITA resposta no look do make-up. Use e abuse dela. Showw</li>
    <li> Ordered five of this product. It has been discontinued and I just love it! Shipped right away and I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I say to snatch this up while you can because this product seems to have been discontinued from Maybelline.     I love the vibrating brush and the formula holds curl nicely.</li>
    <li> I could not find the mascara in the store since I first purchased. I was glad that it is still available. I love this mascara.</li>
    <li> Love this mascara - it is waterproof, flake-proof and stays on till you take it off.  Vibrating wand is not necessary, but it is cool.  Unfortunately, I believe it&#x27;s been discontinued, which is the reason I ordered it from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Wow. For some reason I never heard of this stuff before I noticed it on Amazon, or I would have been buying several at a time.  If it has been discontinued, I&#x27;ll be collecting as many as I can, because not only is it waterproof, which I am determined to use since my last teary/\\&quot;racoon-eyes\\&quot; experience - but the vibrating feature is so clever and works so well it&#x27;s a miracle all mascara manufacturerers don&#x27;t incorporate this little gimmick.  It does separate and coat beautifully, and my lashes have never looked so clean, long and flattering. The button to hold does take some getting used to, but it&#x27;s worth it.  Great product and I got an excellent price on my first purchase: $.01!!!</li>
    <li> This mascara works really will gos on smooth and really defines my lash my husbands likes the way my lashes look with this mascara</li>
    <li> I thought the pulse feature would be a good way to separate my eyelashes but it was difficult to hold the top down (that&#x27;s how you keep it vibrating) and still apply the mascara. I ended up just using the mascara as regular non-pulsing mascara and found I really liked the brush- excellent lash separation and coverage. The formula is non-flaking, definitely water-proof and leaves the lashes thick and shiny. I bought more even though I didn&#x27;t use the pulse feature. The mascara and brush is that good!</li>
    <li> This is the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used. I have short lashes, and this separates and extends them wonderfully. No clumping. I&#x27;m a big fan of the silicone applicator instead of the regular bristles. Love it!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. This mascara stinks. The vibrating mechanism is stupid and to get it to vibrate you have to hold down the applicator HARD and it hurts. It is clumpy and my $4.99 mascaras are better than this one!</li>
    <li> This is a really great product! I love how it looks when I put it on, makes my lashes nice and long looking. The only thing is it&#x27;s hard to wash off so i would recommend buying a makeup rinse to get it off. It&#x27;s great though for going to the beach and wearing super light makeup then you don&#x27;t have to worry about your lashes getting messed up. The best feature I like about this mascara is the vibration it really helps bring out all your lashes and separating them all. If you have bigger fingers however, that part could be a pain.</li>
    <li> Very very waterproof, though the main danger here is clumping. Since the product is so water resistant and the formula is really thick, you have to separate your lashes beforehand (like with an eyelash crimper/curler or a comb) to apply it clump-less. the vibration function isn&#x27;t very helpful, but is really cool to show to friends and impress them. Since the formula is already so thick, vibration to get MORE of the formula onto your eyelashes isn&#x27;t really needed. Definitely adds definition to lashes, just be careful applying it or you&#x27;ll end up with a mess. I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars because the formula was too gooey and thick for my tastes. But definitely waterproof if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
    <li> So there are good things and terrible things to this mascara. I could barely get anything out of it even just rubbing it against my skin. The vibrating brush worked really well at separating my lashes so that was one plus. The button for the vibration was not hard to press as some reviews I had read led me to believe, I found it easy to manage. The tiny tiny bit of the mascara that a actually could get off the brush was VERY waterproof, I scrubbed to get it off my skin and it didn&#x27;t work... all in all it was a waste of my money. Still on the search for an amazing mascara.</li>
    <li> This mascara is not exactly as wonderful as everyone described it.  It does keep my lashes curled most of the day, but I spend more time wiping it off my eyelids than its worth.</li>
    <li> After reading the comments from others, i decided to buy this item.  It is nice but gets dry so fast.  I wish this could give me some length too.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know why they stopped selling this in the stores so I was happy to find it on Amazon.  Takes a bit to get used to but once you get the hang of it you end up with great looking lashes!</li>
    <li> I will say that I received my shipment very quickly.  The mascara is ok, but the vibrating brush isn&#x27;t all it&#x27;s cracked up to be.  You have to grip the button pretty tightly while trying to gently brush your lashes.  It makes for a very clumsy, very messy application.  Maybe I&#x27;ll get used to it?  I&#x27;ve handed it off to my daughters...maybe they&#x27;ll be able to use it.</li>
    <li> Maybelline needs to bring it back. As usual, it was discontinued &amp; I&#x27;m glad I could get it on-line</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used every brand of mascara from the drug store to the high priced cosmetics sites and this is the best! I love how it goes on-doesn&#x27;t clump or irritate my eyes. The vibrating brush is great. Gets between your lashes and makes them look fuller and separate. I bought three (3) packages of this mascara. Stocking up on a good thing is best and the price is wonderful!!</li>
