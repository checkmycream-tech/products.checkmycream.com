      <li>Works great &amp; softens skin without leaving it greasy!</li>

      <li>Recommended by our wonderful Dermatologist!</li>
      <li>excellent!</li>
      <li>Its just great!!!!!!</li>
      <li>I am happy with this product, my friend placed a purchase after he has used mine!</li>
      <li>Perfect coverage.  </li>
      <li>If in the ocean for longer than an hour then the best protection is Vaseline.</li>
      <li>very good, and the price is good too!</li>
      <li>Makeup goes beautifully over it.</li>
      <li>This is a great sunscreen.  </li>
      <li>This is a great sunscreen and I have been using it for years now.  </li>
      <li>Has been doing a great job keeping skin from the suns rays.  </li>
      <li>This provides great protection.  </li>
      <li>Also known to be great for preserving tattoos that get exposed to sunlight often.  </li>
      <li>The Coppertone Sunscreen Lotion has always been a great product, i just can go to the beach or go fishing without it.  </li>
      <li>Worked great and we escaped the summer without burns</li>
      <li>great protection, just don&#x27;t use it on your kids faces as it burns their eyes.</li>
      <li>Great price, Great lotion, keep it on hand for kids and company at the pool.</li>
      <li>Unless you happen to be a marathon swimmer who is going to be soaked for hour and hours in the oceans&#x27; salty water without any shade, then Vaseline will act as the best sealer there is, but for a surfer like me, usually higher organic ingredients are the best since I am in and out of sun which washes away the mix in the oceans’ salty water.</li>
      <li>I will have a good summer with it.</li>
      <li>, doesn&#x27;t smell, has good staying power.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t used it yet, but I think it&#x27;s good to me.</li>
      <li>And I believe  Tissot is a good brand.</li>
      <li>Sunscreen is good, is to compare greasy</li>
      <li>This product worked a bit too good.</li>
      <li>The price is good.</li>
      <li>Lovely smell - reminds me of Reef Oil that I used as a teenager!</li>
      <li>But I love this sunscreen!</li>

      <li>It was a nice product that worked.</li>
      <li>good stuff, not as smelly as most screens</li>
      <li>so am very aware of using a good SPF rated Sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;Coopertone is a good lotion, I recommend it.</li>
      <li>it very cheap but good quality, it very useful in summer when i do sports or go to the beach!</li>
      <li>Not greasy, it is easy to apply, the effect is good</li>
      <li>Nice smooth sun screen that feels good going on and seems to work well preventing sun damage.</li>
      <li>This sunscreen is very easy to apply.</li>
      <li>If you use a lot of sunscreen, then you may consider mixing your own since you can get protection by adding more zinc with fewer ingredients.</li>
      <li>As always with Coppertone you obtain an excellent protection, I use it daily and is really a good sun light protector.</li>
      <li>I will not purchase it any more.</li>
      <li>We enjoyed many days at the community pool using this sunblock.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s just sunblock, nothing more to say</li>
      <li>This is my favorite sunscreen ever.</li>
      <li>The ride itself can wear me out,  but if I add a sunburn on top of it</li>
      <li>I love this sunscreen because of the smell, reminds me of summer.</li>
      <li>but overall I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>Went to a water park and me and my daughter were burn free!</li>
      <li>Love Coppertone smell.</li>
      <li>This one is valid to 2016.&lt;br /&gt;Then, I chose to try this product because so many people recommended this brand.</li>
      <li>make my own sunscreen but for times when I do not, I need as close as formula to clean ingredients in the mix as my organic sunscreen formula mix.</li>
      <li>I like it really good, i like it very much.</li>
      <li>This sunscreen has strong scent,but it doesn&#x27;t matter because I love</li>
      <li>Easy to use</li>
      <li>This was far more superior.</li>
      <li>/&gt;i am allergic to so many ingredients in sunscreen &amp; lotions so am very pleased that so far this works for me</li>
      <li>The scent is fairly light, but I would prefer unscented.  </li>
      <li>PABA free; It must spell out on the face of the container.</li>
      <li>and I found that this is much for effective in blocking the harmful rays.</li>
      <li>goes on smooth non greasy as with all sunscreen you need to reapply it every now and again</li>
      <li>FREE or without chemical ABSORBERS.</li>
      <li>Smells like cheap perfume.</li>
      <li>PABA free; It must spell out on the face of the container.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Still, a good product that prevented sunburn so far.</li>
      <li>Good old reliable (but updated) brand: Coppertone.</li>
      <li>It had the same non-greasy, easy to apply consistency that I loved about Coppertone&#x27;s Oil Free line, but also stayed on well in the water.</li>
      <li>I thought this Sunscreen was okay at first use, but I did not use it on my face at that time.</li>
      <li>Great sunscreen for days when you&#x27;ll be in the sun for a long time.  </li>
      <li>This chemical absorbs through the skin in significant amounts.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not huge either so ideal for travel.</li>
      <li>Light summer beachy smell that makes me smile when I apply it.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t feel comfortable when use it in hot summer.</li>
      <li>well, I was surprised that this sunscreen doesn&#x27;t irritate my neck!!!!!</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t get the red skin but a nice</li>
      <li>I keep it refrigerated till I use and always go for a fresh sunscreen all the time</li>
      <li>But, I would make sure that it is rubbed in completely and re-apply every hour.  </li>
      <li>I keep it refrigerated till I use and always go for a fresh sunscreen all the time</li>
      <li>Says water resistant right on the bottle.</li>
      <li>open, a fragrant jasmine fragrance, and my friends are very like the taste, is our favorite flavor!</li>
      <li>First of all, works great with water and at the same time your skin feels as it is being moisturized at the same time.</li>
      <li>I religiously wore Coppertone&#x27;s Oil Free Sunblock SPF 30 because I liked its non-greasy, easy to apply consistency, but found I still got quite dark with it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s pretty well,thank you.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve heard that sunblocks don&#x27;t make a difference above SPF 30, but found I don&#x27;t get as many visible tan lines with this stronger SPF50</li>
      <li>I used this while in Mexico for the first time.  </li>
      <li>I bike for 3-4 hours at a time, often under the hot Texas Sun.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried other brands when Coppertone wasn&#x27;t available, but Coppertone is the best - at least for me.  </li>
      <li>It has a nice scent, and offers SPF 50 protection at a solid price.  </li>
      <li>we spent 3 weeks in Indonesia, and were many hours in the hot sun.&lt;br /&gt;We came out without any sun</li>
      <li>only comment I have is that the container is not so easy to handle.&lt;br</li>
      <li>is a pure chemical ingredient with fragrance.</li>
      <li>Cost is very high.</li>
      <li>Product works very well.</li>
      <li>Thanks a lot.</li>
      <li>It is really what I wanted.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very nice!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s much cheaer than buy it in target or stopshop~</li>
      <li>this is a really very efficient sun screen.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>Very well, very satisfied&lt;br /&gt;submit</li>
      <li>My friend and I really like this product!&lt;br /&gt;When</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It smells like Summer.</li>
    <li> No more lobster man!  Works as advertised, smell is not terrible, doesn&#x27;t come off with extreme sweat.  Haven&#x27;t tested it in the water.</li>
    <li> My friend and I really like this product!&lt;br /&gt;When open, a fragrant jasmine fragrance, and my friends are very like the taste, is our favorite flavor!</li>
    <li> I train for long distance triathlons (Half Ironman and Ironman distances) and am an avid scuba diver so I&#x27;m in the sun almost every day of the week! I religiously wore Coppertone&#x27;s Oil Free Sunblock SPF 30 because I liked its non-greasy, easy to apply consistency, but found I still got quite dark with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A friend suggested I up my SPF and I tried Coppertone&#x27;s Sunscreen Lotion Ultra Guard Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Lotion SPF50 and Coppertone Sensitive Skin, 50 SPF. This was far more superior. It had the same non-greasy, easy to apply consistency that I loved about Coppertone&#x27;s Oil Free line, but also stayed on well in the water. I found the Sensitive Skin line way too thick and difficult to rub into my skin (it left a visible, thick white film on my skin). Blech.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve heard that sunblocks don&#x27;t make a difference above SPF 30, but found I don&#x27;t get as many visible tan lines with this stronger SPF50 and I&#x27;m spending just as much time in the sun, if not more! I have light yellow Asian / Spanish skin that can get quite brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is not overpowering at all to me and a plus. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Active Ingredients: Avobenzone (3%) (Sunscreen), Homosalate (13%) (Sunscreen), Octisalate (5%) (Sunscreen), Octocrylene (7%) (Sunscreen), Oxybenzone (4%) (Sunscreen). Inactive Ingredients: Water, Sorbitol, Aluminum Starch, OctenylSuccinate, VP/Eicosene Copolymer, Stearic Acid, Triethanolamine, Sorbitan Isostearate, Benzyl Alcohol, Dimethicone, Tocopherol (Natural Vitamin E) (Vitamin E), Polyglyceryl 3 Diisostearate, Fragrance, Methylparaben, Carbomer, Propylparaben, Disodium EDTA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sunscreen needs to protect and needs to protect for a reasonable price. If you want to go by what Consumer Report recommends which rates protection without any consideration for ingredients in the sunscreen then in that case, I can get you roofing tar for less money, so we might as well consider that... Zinc is the solution, more zinc for less money with organic ingredients that are not carcinogen or harmful to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONCLUSION:&lt;br /&gt;This is a pure chemical ingredient with fragrance. Five of the worst chemicals absorbed by the skin. Oxybenzone is a sunscreen ingredient associated with photoallergic reactions. This chemical absorbs through the skin in significant amounts. It contaminates the bodies of 97% of Americans according to research by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I make my own sunscreen but for times when I do not, I need as close as formula to clean ingredients in the mix as my organic sunscreen formula mix. If you use a lot of sunscreen, then you may consider mixing your own since you can get protection by adding more zinc with fewer ingredients. ZO is what surfers put on their nose for protection, the white looking chalk. If in the ocean for longer than an hour then the best protection is Vaseline. Majority of sun screens with ZOs are creams. Creams are more difficult to apply than lotions. Producers of sunscreens sells their products for what they think they can get for each ounce of sunscreen based on their formula and ingredients that they put in that particular sunscreen, especially the percentage of the ZO varies by different production. More ZO cost more, less ZO cost less but then again, less ZO offers less protection. Producers write whatever they want to push a mix and it is up to consumers to read ingredients and compare facts. Unless you happen to be a marathon swimmer who is going to be soaked for hour and hours in the oceans&#x27; salty water without any shade, then Vaseline will act as the best sealer there is, but for a surfer like me, usually higher organic ingredients are the best since I am in and out of sun which washes away the mix in the oceans’ salty water. What I put on my skin is the same as consuming it through my skin since it is absorbed by the skin. I don&#x27;t intend to have the sunscreen for snack but it is good to know that when I choose one, it offers the least amount of chemicals in the mix. Quality sunscreens are not over 30 SPF and if any above 30 SPF, it is a simple marketing, meaning positively worthless. I wear a rash guard when surfing which covers my upper body so I am protected all the time. What worries me is my face. For a small investment, sunscreens may offer me the possibility of avoiding sun burn, pain, cancer, medical bills, pain killers, etc. that come with exposure to the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look for clean formulas all the time with following pointers;&lt;br /&gt;1. ACTIVE INGREDIENTS of more zinc less titanium, the best-rated mineral sun blocks. Majority have many different ingredients than zinc and titanium as ACTIVE INGREDIENTS.&lt;br /&gt;2. Must have the blessing of the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s annual Sunscreen Guide.&lt;br /&gt;3. I do not pay attention to water proof or water resistant. How stupid, I am going in the ocean, in salt water under the sun. Unless I put a deck coating or a roof on my head, it will not last. Anyone looking for those wordings should avoid sun and ocean. Producers like to spin the facts and challenge our knowledge and intelligence by claiming it as WITHOUT any harsh chemical or chemical FREE or without chemical ABSORBERS. Chemical is a chemical regardless.&lt;br /&gt;4. Majority have fragrance which I avoid. After all, I am going in the ocean not on a date. Why do I need fragrance on my skin which is alcohol regardless, and this is from an athlete where I consume fresh garlic napping in vinegar every single day. If I want any perfume, I will apply the perfume I purchase separately.&lt;br /&gt;5. I never leave the sunscreen in the sun. I keep it refrigerated till I use and always go for a fresh sunscreen all the time so I never worry about few months old mix. Freshness is a priority in any mix especially when it comes to oil. I insure to check the expiration date and purchase anything that I consume especially anything that it goes on my skin which is absorbed by the skin and processed by the liver.&lt;br /&gt;6. I always apply 30 minutes before any exposure to the sun since it needs to absorb.&lt;br /&gt;7. BROAD SPECTRUM; It must spell out on the face of the container.&lt;br /&gt;8. PABA free; It must spell out on the face of the container.&lt;br /&gt;9. I avoid OXYBENZONE which apparently disrupts human hormonal system.&lt;br /&gt;10. I avoid vitamin A (retinyl palmitate) which seems to boost skin cancer risk.FREE or without chemical ABSORBERS. Chemical is a chemical regardless. 4. Majority have fragrance which I avoid.

    <li> This sunscreen has strong scent,but it doesn&#x27;t matter because I love it.&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t used it yet ,but I believe it makes sense for proventing sunshine.</li>
    <li> I previously use to use the aerosol sunscreen and I found that this is much for effective in blocking the harmful rays. I have yet to get any sunburn from using this.</li>
    <li> Went to a water park and me and my daughter were burn free! The only thing is it stung a little when it got in my eyes</li>
    <li> Product works very well. However the description says it is waterproof which is a lie. Says water resistant right on the bottle.</li>
    <li> I just have used once,and I haven&#x27;t know from experience if it work or not.It smells good,like fruit flavour.but not lasting</li>
    <li> just what i was expecting</li>
    <li> good stuff, not as smelly as most screens</li>
    <li> I have read that sunscreens over level 15 are of no greater value but based on personal experience totally disagree. This sunblock will protect you from burns and bad rays, it soaks in quickly and gives great protection.</li>
    <li> Very well, very satisfied&lt;br /&gt;submit</li>
    <li> Not greasy, it is easy to apply, the effect is good</li>
    <li> Excelente Producto!!!</li>
    <li> Nice smooth sun screen that feels good going on and seems to work well preventing sun damage. I like it.</li>
    <li> Smells like cheap perfume. My eyes were burning (before I put it on my face) from the smell.</li>
    <li> It is a product containing paraben.For safety reasons，I usually chose  paraben free products，so  I don&#x27;t like it.I will not purchase it any more.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for two years and will order again. It works perfectly - no sunburn at all, easy to apply, no mess, no problem. Nuff said.</li>
    <li> The smell is very bad. I don&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
    <li> I used this product on a recent vacation and it ruined three of my shirts costing me over $500 since they were so completely stained I had to throw them out.  There is a small disclaimer on the label that warns that it &amp;#34;may stain some fabrics&amp;#34;.  That is an understatement.  Warning do not use.</li>
    <li> smells awful, chemical-like, and spreads pretty far.</li>
    <li> Spend a lot of time outdoors and I have had a few skin cancers so am very aware of using a good SPF rated Sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;Coopertone is a good lotion, I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Bad smell , clean up very white, some of the fat.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s just sunblock, nothing more to say</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s one of the daily essentials. I always buy this band sunscreen and recommend it to my friends. You just know it&#x27;s the one you need when you try it.</li>
    <li> I used this while in Mexico for the first time.  It protected my skin really well and I did not get a sunburn.  Being from the Pacific NW, it is saying something!</li>
    <li> 6 month old got slight rash so we switched to a sensitive skin formula</li>
    <li> Perfect coverage.  Light summer beachy smell that makes me smile when I apply it.</li>
    <li> I am happy with this product, my friend placed a purchase after he has used mine!</li>
    <li> I bike for 3-4 hours at a time, often under the hot Texas Sun.  The ride itself can wear me out,  but if I add a sunburn on top of it I&#x27;ll be even more exhausted.  I&#x27;ve used some SPF 50 sunblocks that I still got home with a burn.  I haven&#x27;t had a problem with this one.  Apply before I start and I&#x27;m covered for the entire ride.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed. It has stained the clothes the kids have worn when they were applied this sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;Very tempted to call Coppertone and have them pay for the cost of replacing these clothes.&lt;br /&gt;Also I will initiate a refund thru Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy!!!! You have been warned.</li>
    <li> Contains parabens, which the EU believes to be cancer linked.</li>
    <li> I overpaid, just bought a few days on the price, and I am very unhappy!</li>
    <li> This is a great sunscreen.  It has a nice scent, and offers SPF 50 protection at a solid price.  It&#x27;s not huge either so ideal for travel.</li>
    <li> As always with Coppertone you obtain an excellent protection, I use it daily and is really a good sun light protector.</li>
    <li> When this product arrived, it was in a different color container. The product also didn&#x27;t feel like the same product that I always purchased from the stores. Therefore, I came to the conclusion that this was a counterfeit product and definitely &amp;#34;WILL NOT&amp;#34; order it again from this seller.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s sunscreen for heaven&#x27;s sake!  It either works or it doesn&#x27;t  Use this on my horse&#x27;s PINK nose during the summer months.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very nice!&lt;br /&gt;I take it for my friend ,she likes it.&lt;br /&gt;So it&#x27;s pretty well,thank you.It works well !</li>
    <li> this is a really very efficient sun screen. we spent 3 weeks in Indonesia, and were many hours in the hot sun.&lt;br /&gt;We came out without any sun burn.&lt;br /&gt;The only comment I have is that the container is not so easy to handle.&lt;br /&gt;The Sunscreen is 5 stars!</li>
    <li> My child broke out in bad rash - red skin and white dots from this product.</li>
    <li> its sunscreen. it works.</li>
    <li> I thought this Sunscreen was okay at first use, but I did not use it on my face at that time. The second time I DID use it on my face and as I began to sweat in the sun it got in my eyes and it was terrible. I had to leave the event.</li>
    <li> It was a nice product that worked. However, the extreme amount of smell was a bit sickening. Still, a good product that prevented sunburn so far.</li>
    <li> The Coppertone Sunscreen Lotion has always been a great product, i just can go to the beach or go fishing without it.  Highly recommended...</li>
    <li> I decided to try this based on beautipedia review. My problem is that my neck usually can&#x27;t handle the same sunscreen I use on my face. I like to use high SPF on my face which is chemical based sunscreen (it&#x27;s not pasty) which normally irritate my neck. So I&#x27;ve been using zinc oxide based or titanium dioxide based sunscreens on my neck....well, I was surprised that this sunscreen doesn&#x27;t irritate my neck!!!!! Its just great!!!!!! It will leave your mouth bitter if it gets in there , be careful. It will sting your eyes too (I use another sunscreen around my eyes). But I love this sunscreen! 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I will have a good summer with it.</li>
    <li> It is really what I wanted. Thanks a lot.</li>
    <li> This provides great protection.  The scent is fairly light, but I would prefer unscented.  If it were scent-free I would give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> In Bahamas for a week and nobody got burnt!</li>
    <li> With this summer, not allergic, but a little oil。Capacity is large enough。</li>
    <li> This product worked a bit too good. i didnt get burned at all and i put this lotion on every 2-3 hrs... Only thing that sucked was that i barley got a tan when i was at the beach on a hot day for 6 hrs:/</li>
    <li> The price is good. I hadn&#x27;t chose the cheap one because I was afraid to get those short-dated bottles. This one is valid to 2016.&lt;br /&gt;Then, I chose to try this product because so many people recommended this brand. However, it&#x27;s too greasy for me...I didn&#x27;t feel comfortable when use it in hot summer. The smell was light, neither good nor bad...</li>
    <li> excellent! It&#x27;s much cheaer than buy it in target or stopshop~</li>
    <li> It was tough to rub in and even though it was a 50 SPF Broad Spectrum, I still got burned.  Not as bad as it could have been.  But, I would make sure that it is rubbed in completely and re-apply every hour.  I am not sure where this 80 minute standard came from, but it&#x27;s not true.</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t like scented products, steer clear of this one! The texture was great, not too greasy, not gritty at all, but I can&#x27;t wear it on my face because the perfume makes me feel ill.</li>
    <li> This is a great sunscreen and I have been using it for years now.  First of all, works great with water and at the same time your skin feels as it is being moisturized at the same time. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Recommended by our wonderful Dermatologist!</li>
    <li> Cost is very high.I am so like~</li>
    <li> Great price, Great lotion, keep it on hand for kids and company at the pool. Love Coppertone smell.</li>
    <li> Survived 5 days in Cancun without getting burnt, so this product definitely works!</li>
    <li> it very cheap but good quality, it very useful in summer when i do sports or go to the beach!</li>
    <li> Sunscreen is good, is to compare greasy</li>
    <li> i have sensitive skin and this lotion is the first to not cause allergy.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t get the red skin but a nice tan.&lt;br /&gt;Even though the lotion is thick it does its job to protect your skin.&lt;br /&gt;Also noticed I don&#x27;t get more freckles or sun spots.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite sunscreen ever. I have dry, acne prone skin, and this moisturizers nicely without feeling heavy and making me break out. Makeup goes beautifully over it.</li>
    <li> We enjoyed many days at the community pool using this sunblock. Worked great and we escaped the summer without burns</li>
    <li> I am an active Arizonan with a family history of skin cancer, so I don&#x27;t mess around with my sunscreen! This lotion has a natural scent to it, not overpowering or perfumed. Also known to be great for preserving tattoos that get exposed to sunlight often.  :)</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it yet, but I think it&#x27;s good to me.</li>
    <li> I did not get the one on the picture instead I got the Kroger brand Coppertone. So disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great sunscreen for days when you&#x27;ll be in the sun for a long time.  A little greasy though, but ok for the body. Lovely smell - reminds me of Reef Oil that I used as a teenager!</li>
    <li> goes on smooth non greasy as with all sunscreen you need to reapply it every now and again but overall I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Has been doing a great job keeping skin from the suns rays.  Easy to use, doesn&#x27;t smell, has good staying power.</li>
    <li> very good, and the price is good too!</li>
    <li> need this when I go fishing</li>
    <li> great protection, just don&#x27;t use it on your kids faces as it burns their eyes. You can use a zinc sunscreen stick for that.</li>
    <li> Good old reliable (but updated) brand: Coppertone. This sunscreen is very easy to apply. No need to rub hard to spread. At this point in the summer, I&#x27;m very happy with the 50 protection.</li>
    <li> product is just satisfactory&lt;br /&gt;i am allergic to so many ingredients in sunscreen &amp; lotions so am very pleased that so far this works for me</li>
    <li> I like it really good, i like it very much. And I believe  Tissot is a good brand. Buy it!</li>
    <li> I love this sunscreen because of the smell, reminds me of summer. Does what is expected of a sunscreen, works well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands when Coppertone wasn&#x27;t available, but Coppertone is the best - at least for me.  It has gotten good reviews, the price is good, and it goes on easily and doesn&#x27;t smell bad or make a mess.</li>
    <li> eyes feel uncomfortable</li>
    <li> Works great &amp; softens skin without leaving it greasy!</li>
