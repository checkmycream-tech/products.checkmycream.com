### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Perfectly sized bottles with drippers.</li>
      <li>Great products too.</li>
      <li>so its a great deal.</li>
      <li>Great product, I have been using minoxidil for years</li>
      <li>Very pleased.</li>
      <li>amazing indeed.</li>
      <li>Effective if used morning and evening.</li>
      <li>but I think more effective than the foam.</li>
      <li>Got better result with this product than Regaine, but may have been cause</li>
      <li>I would feel better if they came in sealed bottles, but decided it&#x27;s a reputable company</li>
      <li>a month plus, don&#x27;t see any hair growing yet but the hair I do have is healthier and more manageable.  </li>
      <li>I was more diligent in applying it every morning and evening.</li>
      <li>It would be a better product if it went into the scalp</li>
      <li>It works best on the back of your scalp, but it works on the front too.</li>
      <li>But I have a lot more than my father did at 40, and I am 80.</li>
      <li>I do not need to pay more to buy</li>
      <li>I gave this 5 stars because it goes on easy and dries within 10-20 minutes; it&#x27;s also very cheap given the amount.</li>
      <li>So if you have lots of time on your hands to give yourself a hot oil treatment 3 times a week then this product might be good for you.</li>
      <li>amazon firms always deliver quickly and easily.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s only good for hair loss at the back-top of your head.</li>
      <li>Wearing a hat is a nice crutch for going out in public and also protects your head from the elements.</li>
      <li>I truly wish that Kirkland(Costco) does not discontinue this economical product.</li>
      <li>Received it right away.  </li>
      <li>Shaving your head makes it look like you chose to be bald, which is better than pathetically hanging on to every hair on your head despite there being an obvious glare/baldness.</li>
      <li>BE AWARE;  </li>
      <li>When I first started using it</li>
      <li>but I prefer the Kirkland Minoxidil 5% Extra Strength Foam better.  </li>
      <li>I also use natural apple cider vinegar to clean my scalp in the morning.</li>
      <li>(Using Nizoral, or hot oil scalp treatments) I didn&#x27;t really see any difference when using Nizoral shampoo, but the oil helped hydrate my scalp.</li>
      <li>No dramatic effect yet but seems to be working.</li>
      <li>and when I started drinking too much of it.</li>
      <li>Going over that won&#x27;t really help.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s only been somewhat effective on the bald spot at the back of my head.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend these.</li>
      <li>I also noticed a little more hair on my chest.  </li>
      <li>That way I can have normal looking hair for the day.</li>
      <li>My wife says (and I agree) the increase in hair is noticeable, especially towards the front of my head where I still had a reasonable amount of hair.  </li>
      <li>Dry scalp is a common side effect that&#x27;s easily fixed with anti-dandruff shampoo (which is super cheap and is also a 2-in-1).</li>
      <li>Priced right, arrived sooner than expected.</li>
      <li>Instead they are making it in foam form making It much more expensive but not necessarily more effective.</li>
      <li>Seems to be working, even on my hairline I can see new hairs starting to sprout, it is a tad greasy though.</li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t having much luck with the foam and the liquid is getting harder to find.</li>
      <li>Apparently, excess caffeine can cause DHT levels to rise.</li>
      <li>That doesn&#x27;t mean I have a full head of hair.  </li>

    <li> I used this for a couple of weeks but had to stop as it was giving me incredibly bad dandruff. Also made my hair harder to manage with the residue it left on my scalp.</li>
    <li> I cut the cost of my minoxidil habit by using the $$$$ foam in the morning and the $ liquid at night. That way I can have normal looking hair for the day. Nobody cares if the liquid is little less &amp;#34;cosmetic&amp;#34; if you put it on before you hit the hay.</li>
    <li> Effective if used morning and evening. Very pleased. Got better result with this product than Regaine, but may have been cause I was more diligent in applying it every morning and evening.</li>
    <li> It&#x27; s been used for two years now, i am seeing a big different which everyone  can notice after  using for one month.</li>
    <li> I did not like this product!</li>
    <li> I gave this 5 stars because it goes on easy and dries within 10-20 minutes; it&#x27;s also very cheap given the amount. Shedding is expected after 1-2 months. Dry scalp is a common side effect that&#x27;s easily fixed with anti-dandruff shampoo (which is super cheap and is also a 2-in-1). Results are expected in 4-6 months, and the peak is 12 months or a little bit after. So if it still looks really bad after 12 or 16 months, then just ditch it and own your baldness. Or save up for a stupidly expensive hair transplant. I&#x27;ve only been on it for a month, and I&#x27;ll update this review in 4 or so months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s a tip, buy a hat and also shave your head. Wearing a hat is a nice crutch for going out in public and also protects your head from the elements. Shaving your head makes it look like you chose to be bald, which is better than pathetically hanging on to every hair on your head despite there being an obvious glare/baldness. It also makes it easier to spread the solution. It works best on the back of your scalp, but it works on the front too. All you have to do is up the dose to 1.5ml or 2ml. Going over that won&#x27;t really help.</li>
    <li> The product was deliver on time.  I like this product but I prefer the Kirkland Minoxidil 5% Extra Strength Foam better.  I will purchase again. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I have somewhat diffuse hair loss, and have been using this product for about 1 1/2 years now.  I rub it in all over the areas that are thin twice a day as recommended.  My wife says (and I agree) the increase in hair is noticeable, especially towards the front of my head where I still had a reasonable amount of hair.  It&#x27;s only been somewhat effective on the bald spot at the back of my head.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for a while now and have had minimal or no results. After doing some research, I finally figured out what might have caused my bald spot to begin with. I think it started when I started drinking coffee years ago and when I started drinking too much of it. Apparently, excess caffeine can cause DHT levels to rise. So, I just recently removed caffeine from diet...and to my surprise... the minoxidil started working and hairs have started to pop up on my bald spot ...amazing indeed. I also use natural apple cider vinegar to clean my scalp in the morning. I was also going to try the caffeine shampoo since I read that it might help as well...just no caffeine to drink. Hope it helps or works.</li>
    <li> Received it right away.  I would feel better if they came in sealed bottles, but decided it&#x27;s a reputable company so went ahead (get it, &amp;#34;a...head?).  Into the program a month plus, don&#x27;t see any hair growing yet but the hair I do have is healthier and more manageable.  BE AWARE;  it&#x27;s only good for hair loss at the back-top of your head. Does not work for receding hairline and/or anywhere else but.</li>
    <li> I went to yoga and this stuff was in my sweat. Causing my face to break out within hours of practice. The break out then became worse as days passed. After a week my entire face began to swell up. Finally after dealing with it for over a week I went to urgent care because it didn&#x27;t seem to be going anywhere. I am still peeling from my face and only used maybe one bottle.</li>
    <li> This product is too oily and greasy !! It would be a better product if it went into the scalp</li>
    <li> Great product, I have been using minoxidil for years and It has helped me to keep my hair in place. I do not need to pay more to buy Rogain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great delivery time.</li>
    <li> amazon firms always deliver quickly and easily. Great products too.</li>
    <li> Seems to be working, even on my hairline I can see new hairs starting to sprout, it is a tad greasy though.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product off and on for a few years. When I first started using it I hardly had any side effects (dryness, itching, and flaking), but now the side effects show within a few hours of application. I have read tips on remedies that help too. (Using Nizoral, or hot oil scalp treatments) I didn&#x27;t really see any difference when using Nizoral shampoo, but the oil helped hydrate my scalp. So if you have lots of time on your hands to give yourself a hot oil treatment 3 times a week then this product might be good for you. For me I&#x27;ll just cut off all my hair until I find something that has less embarrassing/annoying side effects.</li>
    <li> I truly wish that Kirkland(Costco) does not discontinue this economical product. Instead they are making it in foam form making It much more expensive but not necessarily more effective.</li>
    <li> A little messy but I think more effective than the foam.</li>
    <li> The 5% Minoxidil keeps my hair looking youthful and, to this point stopped any further hair loss.  It works so well that it is hard to tell that I use the stuff.</li>
    <li> Was a sceptic on purchasing these online. After using these for 8 months my hair is coming in. I highly recommend these.</li>
    <li> This product worked for me, my hair is noticibly thicker on the vertex and in the front.  I also noticed a little more hair on my chest.  In my opinon This product works as well as the name brand stuff so its a great deal.</li>
    <li> My hair did NOT grow back and it is known. This is my humble opinion after over 30 years. Is the claim wrong? Dr. Schwarz</li>
    <li> This stuff works, even my nails grow faster from putting it on.</li>
    <li> The bottles were not sealed! IT could be anything inside! I&#x27;m not using it! It could be water inside! NEVER SHOP AGAIN! HASTA LA VISTA!</li>
    <li> Perfectly sized bottles with drippers.</li>
    <li> No dramatic effect yet but seems to be working. No side effects also as what others are compalining about.</li>
    <li> Priced right, arrived sooner than expected. Wasn&#x27;t having much luck with the foam and the liquid is getting harder to find. I expect to be looking like the Wolf Man in no time! Would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Has worked for me for 25 years.  That doesn&#x27;t mean I have a full head of hair.  But I have a lot more than my father did at 40, and I am 80.</li>
