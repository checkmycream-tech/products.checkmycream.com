      <li>This is the best foot file I have used, and I&#x27;ve tried many.  </li>

      <li>This is a great product if you don&#x27;t want to spend more for an electric appliance!</li>
      <li>Until I tried the Tweezerman LTD, my favorite was the PedEgg, but it still didn&#x27;t do a very good job.  </li>
      <li>I love my feet again!  </li>
      <li>I love the fact that this is ergonomic!  </li>
      <li>And I love that he cares!</li>
      <li>Better than the ones they send home with you after a pedicure!</li>
      <li>When we first got the Ped Egg, we were so impressed and thought it was the answer to all the world&#x27;s problems.</li>
      <li>I LOVE this product!  </li>
      <li>I love this foot file!  </li>
      <li>First off, Tweezerman is an excellent brand, and I have been thrilled with all of their products, specifically their line of tweezers, including this one [[ASIN:</li>
      <li>This works amazingly well.&lt;br</li>
      <li>You&#x27;re supposed to soften your feet in warm water before using the file, but I just use it while I&#x27;m in the shower.</li>
      <li>/&gt;While it isn&#x27;t designed to do this, it&#x27;s also a handy art tool for putting a point on charcoal, graphite and contra crayon.</li>
      <li>The file can be washed in warm water and air dried.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>this as nice as the diamond file I used to have?</li>
      <li>With this composite, the tool is extremely effective.</li>
      <li>I am thrilled with this product.</li>
      <li>B009WUA658 Tweezerman Deluxe Nail Clipper Set, 2.34 Ounce]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and it is at a nice price point as well.</li>
      <li>It is super comfortable to hold, and both sides work wonderfully well for my foot care.  </li>
      <li>It washes up nicely so it stays good and clean</li>
      <li>This one is by far the best that I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
      <li>This one has been by far the best.  </li>
      <li>The thing I loved the most about this product is that I don&#x27;t have to lean all the way over in order to sand and smooth my feet.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Almost as good as getting a real pedicure--the quality of the \\&quot;job\\&quot; is just as good--</li>
      <li>I am no less impressed with the Tweezerman File, in fact I&#x27;m more</li>
      <li>and I go to great length and expense to keep a pretty foot.  </li>
      <li>The grip is very comfortable on the Tweezerman LTD and I do recommend this product for your feet maintenance needs.</li>
      <li>This is great tool that I actually use in my work capacity because for certain jobs with wood and evening plumbing it&#x27;s been the perfect tool to help me with my tasks.</li>
      <li>What more can you say about something like this.</li>
      <li>I guess you&#x27;re supposed to massage your feet with the handle for better circulation</li>
      <li>The Tweezerman had better reviews</li>
      <li>You will may want to purchase more than one at a time.</li>
      <li>This Tweezerman foot file is much more to my liking.</li>
      <li>I have used loofa, stones, those things that look like lemon zesters and have received many foot files from someone who loves giving extras to me.  </li>
      <li>have some curved bamboo paddles with sandpaper but the shape of this file and the grit of its sandpaper makes it much more</li>
      <li>favorite design feature is that the two sides of the handle have a distinctive grip pattern.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s too big for travel, but perfect for shower and tub.</li>
      <li>I find it hilarious</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s much better if you&#x27;ve soaked your feet or use it just after taking a shower.  </li>
      <li>Most of the time this doesn&#x27;t bother me, but in the summer, when my feet are more exposed, I&#x27;d like them to appear more</li>
      <li>The foot file works better than most that I have tried.  </li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is what I love about it:&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>It is definitely the best foot file I have ever used.  </li>
      <li>This is definitely the best foot file I have ever used! :)</li>
      <li>shape is much more conducive to filing feet than the Ped Egg.</li>
      <li>I also love the size of this product.  </li>
      <li>I love this foot file.</li>
      <li>I LOVE the Tweezerman brand.</li>
      <li>Oh, she has even tried it on her efforts and is pleased.</li>
      <li>I have used several implements for foot callouses and the Tweezerman product is one of the best!</li>
      <li>used this file after a long shower because I have always found it best to soften the skin on my feet before filing.  </li>
      <li>I purchased this on recommendation from Vivianna Does Makeup and I was not disappointed!</li>
      <li>But this Tweezerman file works great, with no pain in my wrists and no trouble reaching any part of either foot!</li>
      <li>but honestly I&#x27;m more comfortable using my shaver and</li>
      <li>Still, this is a definitely a useful and effective product, and I would rate it 4 1/2 stars.</li>
      <li>This file has a good grip, and the grain pad is sturdy and gentle.</li>
      <li>Other than this, I&#x27;m surprisingly very impressed with this foot file.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s easy to grip and hold on</li>
      <li>It is easy to hold and maneuver.</li>
      <li>This is strong and durable so you won&#x27;t have to replace it because it breaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>--it is that strong.  </li>
      <li>She is very pleased with the feel and the gentle way</li>
      <li>In my case, I used the fine sides on calluses on my elbows and fingers.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s sturdy, has 2 varying degrees of gravel/sand (one on each side) and it does the trick much more quickly than the ones that are basically sand paper and wear away after a couple</li>
      <li>This is more effective than a pedicure, way more effective than the clairsonic foot scrubber, or an other lotions, peals, callous shavers I have tried.  </li>
      <li>I have very ticklish feet and am able to use this with no problem!</li>
      <li>The fact that it has 2 levels of \\&quot;grit\\&quot; - coarse and fine is a great feature to speed up the smoothing process.</li>
      <li>One side is wonderful at attacking calluses and the other side is very fine and smooths the skin out very well.  </li>
      <li>But I had a bunch of replacement pads that fit them.</li>
      <li>There are even adhesive replacement sanding pads available in both the 100 and 60 grit versions that can be found by searching for \\&quot;Flowery foot file</li>
      <li>This keeps them smooth and fissure free.</li>
      <li>This is the third product I have tried on my feet and this if by far the best, much better than a pumice stone or a \\&quot;grater-type\\&quot; heel file.</li>
      <li>Lasts for a very long time and does a great job.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is the best foot file I have used, and I&#x27;ve tried many.  Better than the ones they send home with you after a pedicure!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping this is great quality its not like the cheap ones that are thin and grit rubs off. You will not be disapointed. I am a nail tech and this is the ONLY foot file we will buy. It will last a long time! Its worth spending a few extra bux for this.</li>
    <li> I love this foot file. My feet are very smooth and no more cracks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Soft-Grip Foot File on my girlfriend. Before that I was using the Ped Egg. I&#x27;ve noticed a remarkable improvement over the Ped Egg when using this file.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shape is much more conducive to filing feet than the Ped Egg. It&#x27;s much easier to handle, and frankly, does a better job. When we first got the Ped Egg, we were so impressed and thought it was the answer to all the world&#x27;s problems. I am no less impressed with the Tweezerman File, in fact I&#x27;m more so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make this choice with confidence. This is the right one.</li>
    <li> First off, Tweezerman is an excellent brand, and I have been thrilled with all of their products, specifically their line of tweezers, including this one [[ASIN:B000EMUDUQ Tweezerman  Stainless Steel Slant Tweezer, Pink]].  I also have found their nail clippers to be high quality, including [[ASIN:B009WUA658 Tweezerman Deluxe Nail Clipper Set, 2.34 Ounce]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the Tweezerman Soft Grip Foot File, I especially love the size, as it makes it much more comfortable for my hands, which I have trouble with due to arthritis.  It is super comfortable to hold, and both sides work wonderfully well for my foot care.  I highly recommend this foot file, and already purchased a couple for my sister and mom.</li>
    <li> This may be the safest, most painless way to smooth rough feet. I soaked my feet for 30 minutes before using the file and I could see the pile of snowy white shavings accumulating on the floor. This works but it doesn&#x27;t work miracles and it does take several uses to get the job done. My feet weren&#x27;t too bad to begin with and after two uses, I still have a little way to go before all the dead skin is gone.</li>
    <li> I LOVE the Tweezerman brand. This file has a good grip, and the grain pad is sturdy and gentle.</li>
    <li> The Tweezerman Soft Grip Foot File has comfortable soft-touch plastic on the handle, one side of which has bumps that can be used to massage the feet&amp;mdash;although for that it is necessary to use the \\&quot;business end\\&quot; as a very uncomfortable handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The filing surfaces are basically sandpaper.  The shape seems odd at first but works quite well.  There are two grits of sandpaper with the rough side just right for removing dead skin and the other side just ride for buffing.  The sandpaper collects dead skin but it is easy to clean off under running water with an old toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have some curved bamboo paddles with sandpaper but the shape of this file and the grit of its sandpaper makes it much more effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This foot file is branded Tweezerman but the same exact item in other colors is sold on Amazon under various names that are a variation of \\&quot;Swedish foot file\\&quot;.  There are even adhesive replacement sanding pads available in both the 100 and 60 grit versions that can be found by searching for \\&quot;Flowery foot file pads\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I get horrible callouses and try hard to keep my feet smooth and neat. For several years, I used a file that I bought a file that I bought in a beauty supply store. Eventually that one disappeared and I ordered a swedish foot file on Amazon. I broke two with just regular use. I did not want to reorder one because they obviously weren&#x27;t sturdy. But I had a bunch of replacement pads that fit them. I was a little frustrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I saw the tweezerman LTD soft Grip foot file, I was hopeful that it would fit my refills. It does. Perfectly. Plus it is a dream to use. The handle is easier for me to use so I am not applying as much pressure trying to grip it. The grits are perfect for removing serious callouses and for smoothing the skin. It is fast and easy. I am thrilled with this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a pumice stone and a clay foot file from India. Both are uncomfortable to hold and neither has the right abrasive surface to really soften my feet. This Tweezerman foot file is much more to my liking. It&#x27;s easy to get a good grip on it, and the coarseness of the surface is just right for removing dead skin. You&#x27;re supposed to soften your feet in warm water before using the file, but I just use it while I&#x27;m in the shower. I also like the way it narrows at the end so I can get at the calluses on my tootsies.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use it, and bought it for my wife.  She says there is nothing like it!  She has bought several more for Family/Friends</li>
    <li> This is a terrific foot file. Callouses and dead skin come right off, without much elbow grease. In the foot filing business, that&#x27;s a hard trick to follow.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had great luck with Tweezerman products.  I&#x27;m still using a pair of Tweezerman tweezers I bought probably 10+ years ago, maybe 15.&lt;br /&gt;I have a wonderful Tweezerman callus shaver (like this one [[ASIN:B001HS29LM Tweezerman LTD Safety Slide Callus Shaver and Rasp]] ) that I use&lt;br /&gt;about once every two weeks or so.  I used to be able to buy the blades at normal stores, but now order them on Amazon.  Even with that, I&#x27;m prone&lt;br /&gt;to dry skin, especially on my heels.  This is great as an in-between measure.  It&#x27;s not enough for the issues I have, but it definitely helps.  When things&lt;br /&gt;get really bad, I use [[ASIN:B00011JZWW ProLinc Callus Eliminator, 4 Fluid Ounce]], but honestly I&#x27;m more comfortable using my shaver and a file.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is this as nice as the diamond file I used to have? No...but it doesn&#x27;t cost as much either, so I&#x27;m less likely to be upset if it&#x27;s lost...or my toddler does something&lt;br /&gt;to it.  WIll this last forever? No...but it&#x27;s still great Tweezerman quality.</li>
    <li> Between this and something like the [[ASIN:B00113FENI Ped Egg Pedicure Foot File, Colors may vary]], I think I&#x27;d go with the Ped Egg.  This file is kind of hard to hold in your hand properly and get an ergonomical grip.  Also, I don&#x27;t see the point of the pink nubby section - it kind of hurts my hand while I&#x27;m holding it!  Not my favorite personal care product so far...</li>
    <li> The foot file comes in a clear plastic sleeve. I have very calloused feet as I enjoy walking barefoot, even outside. No other file or pedicure tool has made my feet as soft and baby foot-like as this tool has. The large size of the tool makes it easy to work quickly. I was skeptical that it could be used more than once but I have used it five times for intense pedicure sessions and it still works like new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wish the handle were a more up-to-date color than the pink it comes in. I am the only one who is going to see it, but even a print would make it more fun.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product!  It is definitely the best foot file I have ever used.  It does a great job of smoothing out the rough areas without being overly aggressive.  The two sides (coarse and smooth) allow you to get just the right amount of skin from your foot without taking off too much skin.  I also love the size of this product.  All of the other files I have used felt too small but with this one you get plenty of area to use and it also feels nice and sturdy - not flimsy.  It washes up nicely so it stays good and clean and you can use it over and over again. It is a good solid product that works as it should and it is at a nice price point as well.</li>
    <li> There are other foot files. There are other foot filers with emery material. But I haven&#x27;t seen any that are so long and tapered, making it easy to reach all areas of both feet easily and without straining your wrist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usually when I use any kind of file for foot care, they are several inches long and I have trouble reaching the opposite side of the foot where I can&#x27;t see. I end up bending my wrist and contorting it until it gets sore. But this Tweezerman file works great, with no pain in my wrists and no trouble reaching any part of either foot! The file is a little over 10 inches total. The filing surface is 5-1/2 inches and tapers, making it easy to reach your entire foot and easy to get not just the heels and sides of your feet, but also the area around the toes. This works amazingly well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One side is an emery surface that is rather coarse, the other side is a finer emery for buffing. These work very well. I used this foot file on my left foot three times over the course of a week and did nothing to the right foot. You could really tell the difference. And though that would be true of any foot file, what separates this particular file is the shape. The grip end is plastic, lightly tapered and comfortable; one side is rippled for an easy grip, the opposite side is bumpy and can be used as a massage surface -- run it along your foot for stimulation and massage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A truly well-designed and useful product for those who want to soften up their feet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried various foot files and shavers.  Until I tried the Tweezerman LTD, my favorite was the PedEgg, but it still didn&#x27;t do a very good job.  As I&#x27;ve aged, my calluses have thickened and started cracking, and even the PedEgg didn&#x27;t get rid of my cracked calluses.  It did thin them out a bit, but the were never really smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I tried this Tweezerman LTD.  Oh man, I was in heaven by time I finished.  In just a few minutes, the cracks were gone, and my feet felt as smooth as they were when I was in my 20s!  The directions say you can file with wet or dry feet, and that it goes faster if your feet have been soaking for awhile.  Mine were dry when I filed them, and I was VERY satisfied with the job it did.  I love my feet again!  Thanks Tweezerman!</li>
    <li> Best file I&#x27;ve purchased. Lasts for a very long time</li>
    <li> I love the fact that this is ergonomic!  The foot file works better than most that I have tried.  This can be attributed to the fact that it is wider and more coarse.  It is very durable, easy to clean, and has a nice clear and sturdy case.</li>
    <li> I have very rough, virtually permanent callouses under both of my big toes.  Most of the time this doesn&#x27;t bother me, but in the summer, when my feet are more exposed, I&#x27;d like them to appear more smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many different types of foot smoothing products, including various lotions, files, and pumice stones, all with mixed success.  Given this, I was surprised by how will this file works!  The instructions say to use wet or dry, so I tried using dry.  The more abrasive side did an excellent job of sloughing away the worst of my rough skin, whereas the finer-grain file helped to then soften and smooth the filed skin.  As I&#x27;ve started to make this a regular part of my skin care, my tough callouses are now barely noticeable!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit, I don&#x27;t like the bright, Pepto-Bismal pink color of the handle; I also find the idea that the grooves on the handle can be used for an \\&quot;invigorating massage\\&quot; to be a gimmick.  Still, this is a definitely a useful and effective product, and I would rate it 4 1/2 stars.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different foot files and callous removal products, including the PediEgg, and this Tweezerman product is by far my favorite.  I have barefoot/sandal wearing/hot sand walking Florida feet so I need something that really works well and is easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One side of this foot file is quite rough and really sloughs off the hard dry skin; the other side is less rough and sands everything smooth.  I tried using it dry (instructions say you can) but it&#x27;s much better if you&#x27;ve soaked your feet or use it just after taking a shower.  The grip has ridges and bumps on it so it won&#x27;t slip.  I like that you don&#x27;t have to press hard to get results and the large surface area allows you to really work on rough heels and sides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product!</li>
    <li> This is the third product I have tried on my feet and this if by far the best, much better than a pumice stone or a \\&quot;grater-type\\&quot; heel file. I often have very rough, cracked heels. Just one session of using first the most coarse and then the less coarse side of this file, followed by some cream made a huge difference in my heels. I am a huge fan and would recommend this to anyone with rough heels. Don&#x27;t waste your money on cheaper products that don&#x27;t get the job done.</li>
    <li> This really does the job as a foot file and buffer to reduce skin build-up on the heel and other trouble spots on the foot. The file appears to have chips of some almost diamond-hard composite within the file. With this composite, the tool is extremely effective. On the opposite side is a buffer to smooth out the skin. The handle is very sturdy and grips well with the hand. The description on the package of the \\&quot;Soft Grip Foot File\\&quot; is indeed what the product does. It&#x27;s very well-made, so durability should not be a problem.</li>
    <li> This is a big file with two sides, one to do the tough work of heels and the other to smooth the sides of your feet. In my case, I used the fine sides on calluses on my elbows and fingers. Worked just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s too big for travel, but perfect for shower and tub. The long handle has a rubbery grip so no slipping and no smashing into the bottom of the tub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite design feature is that the two sides of the handle have a distinctive grip pattern. The rough side has big bumps on the handle and the finishing side has smoother grooves. I don&#x27;t like to touch files to find out which side is which, and now I don&#x27;t have to. The handle lets me know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it isn&#x27;t designed to do this, it&#x27;s also a handy art tool for putting a point on charcoal, graphite and contra crayon. The weight of the file keeps it firmly on my studio table.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I was looking for to take care of the rough spots on my heels. While instructions say it can also be used dry,I prefer to keep it in the shower and use the two black sides to scrub and buff feet when the skin has softened a bit in the hot water. It&#x27;s done a great job of smoothing out my feet. With a quick rinse and keeping it hung where it will dry between uses, I&#x27;ve had no trouble keeping the file clean. I don&#x27;t really like the feel of the soft pink half as a foot massager, but it does make a comfortable handle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always going barefoot, so my feet have callouses. I was shaving them off (scary!), but I found this nifty file: rougher on one side, and gentler on the other. It really hones the rough spots down to a nice, smooth surface, and doesn&#x27;t require a lot of effort. Get one!</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a file that will cut through the iron bars of a jail cell, this is not it. This pink implement will make quick work of calluses and dead skin without leaving the area raw and sensitive. Everything about it is well considered and manufactured from quality, long lasting materials.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve owned my share of pumice stones, rasps and files and this one is truly the best of the lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) It has two file surfaces: rough and fine.....both the exact-perfect texture for eliminating rough and dry patches without damaging the sensitive skin below. You start with the rough side to get the tough stuff and then switch to the fine to smooth and polish.&lt;br /&gt;2) It is easy to hold and maneuver. The 10.5\\&quot; length and 1.5\\&quot; maximum thickness feels right in the hand and a textured handle keeps it slip free.&lt;br /&gt;3) A tapering at the top allows the file to get to small, difficult to reach areas such as between the ball of the foot or between the toes.&lt;br /&gt;4) It can be rinsed easily.&lt;br /&gt;5) It can be hung from a hook.&lt;br /&gt;6) Although the color is Pepto pink, the file is not horrible looking.&lt;br /&gt;7) The price is reasonable.</li>
    <li> Well made. Great textures on both sides.  One side is wonderful at attacking calluses and the other side is very fine and smooths the skin out very well.  I love sturdy products that are manufactured to give excellent results.  This is one of them.  I highly recommend this Tweezerman foot file.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.&lt;br /&gt;I am adding this extra information after reading a three star review that recommended the Ped Egg instead of this product. Don&#x27;t do it.  I used the Ped Egg for years. The reason I found and bought this foot file is that a woman giving me a pedicure a few months ago said NEVER to use any product that cuts calluses off your foot.  She used a liquid to remove some of my calluses and my heels looked great. Weeks later, I still have calluses but they are not nearly as thick as they were before my last pedicure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She specifically said not to let anyone use a razor on your calluses and not to use a Ped Egg (which is like small version of a grater for carrots or potatoes.)  She said cutting calluses only makes them worse.  Turns out it&#x27;s illegal in my state for people selling pedicures to use a razor on foot calluses. But years ago when I got regular pedicures, the woman used a razor on my calluses all the time.  Some still do.  I&#x27;m glad I finally learned the truth and hope this helps someone else.</li>
    <li> After snapping another cheap foot file in half I decided to look for a better file.  I have other Tweezerman products and think they are top quality.  Long story short...this feels sturdy in my hand and does the job in half the time.  I got mine at the local CVS and paid more than the price on Amazon.  Nothing fancy, just a very good product.  I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of foot files over the years... this one blows them all away.  I use it dry first time around and get all the dry skin off, then I dampen it and go over my feet another time.  My feet are so soft after creaming them.  I use it every couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> I did not think I would be wow&#x27;d by a foot file but this one is really really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is what I love about it:&lt;br /&gt;- It is 10-1/2 inches long and its sword-like contour is easy to grasp and file with even on the smaller areas of the foot.&lt;br /&gt;- There are two exfoliating sanders; the coarse side is used to remove rough skin and the less abrasive side is used to finish with light buffing.&lt;br /&gt;- The handle is ribbed so it&#x27;s easy to grip and hold on to.&lt;br /&gt;- The file is sturdy and well-made and not flimsy.&lt;br /&gt;- The handle has nubs on one side and ribs on the other.&lt;br /&gt;- The nubs are used to massage the soles and heels. (The nubs caused a slight tickling sensation until I got use to it.  I also used the ribbed side, but that had little massaging effect on me. The package says to use the nubbed side, but I still had to try the other side of the handle.)&lt;br /&gt;- The file can be washed in warm water and air dried.&lt;br /&gt;- The file also comes in a reclosable plastic envelope for storing similar to the type that make-up brushes come in.&lt;br /&gt;- At $11.99 I think the price is reasonable too. If this one wears out I will definitely purchase one of these as a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this file after a long shower because I have always found it best to soften the skin on my feet before filing.  The coarse file seamlessly removed the dead skin on my heel and the buffer smoothed the skin out.  I then used the massager and finished off by applying moisturizer. The only thing that I did not like is that I had to hold the file area while using the handle nubs to massage my feet; that was not as comfortable as holding on to the nubbed handle when filing. Other than this, I&#x27;m surprisingly very impressed with this foot file.</li>
    <li> The thing I loved the most about this product is that I don&#x27;t have to lean all the way over in order to sand and smooth my feet.  This wand is about 10\\&quot; long and I&#x27;m able to reach the bottom of my feet with no extra effort (having had hip replacment surgery, I&#x27;m always careful when bending).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It provides 4 different surfaces for sanding, scraping, smoothing and stiumlating your skin. You can keep it in a drawer, hang it on a small nail, or just leave it next to the tub or shower for quick access.  All of the options work extremely well on the sensitive foot area.  And with a name like Tweezerman you know you&#x27;re getting a quality product. Now I just have to get another one for my husband.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several other items on the market to combat calluses on my feet. In my experience they have either been to harsh and pull off too much skin or too timid and barely do anything at all.  I found Tweezerman foot file just right.  It works on dry or soaked feet.  I suggest to follow up with a great moiturizer and socks before going to bed.</li>
    <li> As a nurse, I am always on my feet.  I try to get a pedicure as often as possible, but my feet still get dried and cracked.  I use this file in the shower 2-3 times a week.  Since I&#x27;ve been using this file, my feet have felt nice and soft; no more painful cracks in my heels.  I&#x27;ve tried several types of foot file, from the expensive ones you buy at the spa to cheap ones at the dollar store.  This one has been by far the best.  Tweezerman&#x27;s products never disappointment.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had one like this (came from a spa) for years. This is basically a private labeling of a generic (but good!) product. Two sides, different patterns, can be used wet or dry (but wet works better), rinse clean, dry, repeat. Super practical especially in the summer when feet are on display. I guess you&#x27;re supposed to massage your feet with the handle for better circulation but ain&#x27;t nobody got time for that.</li>
    <li> This is a quality product that works very well.  I don&#x27;t particularly like using a foot file but I like the results.  Especially in the summer when I seem to have much rougher feet (I guess because of wearing sandals).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tweezerman is a name brand that can be trusted.  This is strong and durable so you won&#x27;t have to replace it because it breaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almost as good as getting a real pedicure--the quality of the \\&quot;job\\&quot; is just as good--the only down side with this is that you have to do it yourself.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product, delivery was a little slow but worth the wait.</li>
    <li> This is great tool that I actually use in my work capacity because for certain jobs with wood and evening plumbing it&#x27;s been the perfect tool to help me with my tasks. I&#x27;ve purchased a number of these through the years and though it is pink it helps get the job done~~!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this foot file!  The fact that it has 2 levels of \\&quot;grit\\&quot; - coarse and fine is a great feature to speed up the smoothing process. the narrow tip works well in the tighter spaces near your toes and do a great job smoothing, without irritating. the handle is rubberized and provides good grip both when used wet or dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;definitely a product I would use for home pedis!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not one for maintaining my skin softness in the feet area but the Tweezerman LTD has proven to be quite useful if you&#x27;ve got dead skin building up.  The Tweezerman LTD comes with two sides for buffing and polishing your skin.  One side is more coarse and the other a lot more fine.  The grip is very comfortable on the Tweezerman LTD and I do recommend this product for your feet maintenance needs.</li>
    <li> Best ever tool for your feet.</li>
    <li> This is the best file I have ever used.  I have tried everything at the store and I thought it was hopeless! I don&#x27;t have thick calluses or anything, but I use this on my heel and ball of my foot to file away dry skin in the bath.  This does the job quickly and gently.  Yay the search is over!</li>
    <li> A technician used one of these recently when I was getting a pedicure and I knew I had to have one. I have very ticklish feet and am able to use this with no problem!</li>
    <li> I am thrilled with the Tweezerman LTD soft grip foot file, it really works well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been struggling finding a foot file small enough to work around the toes and ball of foot. This is small enough to get into the more tiny and space limited areas on my foot. I would buy this again and recommend it for use on the &#x27;hard to reach&#x27; areas on ones foot.</li>
    <li> This is more effective than a pedicure, way more effective than the clairsonic foot scrubber, or an other lotions, peals, callous shavers I have tried.  I am blessed with horrible calloused feet and I go to great length and expense to keep a pretty foot.  This file is all you need.  I file my feet dry, about 3-4 times a week- for about two minutes.  That&#x27;s it.  You want to spend a bundle, go ahead!  All you need is this file.  I find it hilarious they have nothing remotely like it.</li>
    <li> best foot file ive ever found and ive tried them all!</li>
    <li> It is a file and does the job.</li>
    <li> Husband loves this for his rough feet. And I love that he cares!</li>
    <li> My FAVE foot file.  It lasts a long time, does the job, cleans easily using an old toothbrush with soap and water and the price is reasonable.  A+++</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know I needed this until I purchased it. I use it with Microplane&#x27;s Colossal Pedicure Rasp. Together, it&#x27;s like having a professional pedicure without leaving the house or having to smell all the nail polish in a salon setting.</li>
    <li> works like I wanted it to</li>
    <li> This is a great product if you don&#x27;t want to spend more for an electric appliance!</li>
    <li> Have used it for years.  Lasts for a very long time and does a great job.</li>
    <li> No offense, mom, but your feet are gnarly. This keeps them smooth and fissure free.</li>
    <li> This is the only thing I have found that truly removes all the dry skin from my feet and it does it so well that when I go to the nail salon for my pedicure they barely have to do any scrubbing on the bottom of my feet.  Use every morning in the shower for lasting results, I wouldn’t use anything else!</li>
    <li> It works and the price is right.  I wish I could get a color other than pink.  What more can you say about something like this.</li>
    <li> I have used several implements for foot callouses and the Tweezerman product is one of the best! Easy to handle, easy to hang, two different &#x27;filing&#x27; options. It is a little more expensive than some others but worth the month. Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> My wife really loves this foot file.  It has a very sturdy feel, and looks like it has been made to use in industry.  The handle has a soft grip and the file head is tapered.  She is able to grip it, unlike her other foot file, and to manipulate to the area that she wants to work on.  Personally, I don&#x27;t see the problem with some calluses on the feet, but for some reason it bugs the diggings out of her.  She is very pleased with the feel and the gentle way this foot file removes the calluses.  Oh, she has even tried it on her efforts and is pleased.</li>
    <li> I have tried everything from callous remover cutting tools, other files and even the callous remover liquids and nothing has helped. When I was younger I used to walk outside barefoot on a regular basis and even now I am barefoot when I am home and I sometimes walk outside barefoot. My feet are very calloused and hard but the first time I used this file I noticed a huge improvement. My feet are literally baby soft, my feet probably haven&#x27;t been this soft since birth. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different brands of foot file and this is by far the raspiest. The handle is strong and pliable, so it seems unlikely it will crack like the other brands.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I&#x27;ve used many of these and Tweezerman is the best. The construction is sturdy (I&#x27;ve had others snap in half) and the two-sided file does the job. One side of the file is rough, the other is for smoothing. A word of caution: the rough side is VERY rough. I got a little over-zealous once and scratched up my heel without realizing it. Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this on recommendation from Vivianna Does Makeup and I was not disappointed! This is definitely the best foot file I have ever used! :)</li>
    <li> I have used loofa, stones, those things that look like lemon zesters and have received many foot files from someone who loves giving extras to me.  This one is by far the best that I&#x27;ve ever had. It&#x27;s sturdy, has 2 varying degrees of gravel/sand (one on each side) and it does the trick much more quickly than the ones that are basically sand paper and wear away after a couple uses.&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s going to last me a lifetime--seriously--it is that strong.  It&#x27;s pink but honestly I&#x27;ve never seen a dude use one of these things before so who cares.</li>
    <li> I have hyper keratosis and this is the only foot file that works for me.  Great value for money too.  I only wish I could get it in Ireland.</li>
    <li> I love it. Does a great job!</li>
    <li> I had a Swedish Flower Foot file that I used for over a year.  I loved it, but I use it in the shower everyday and the sand paper was wearing down and not as effective.  The Tweezerman had better reviews so I bought it from Amazon.  After using it in the shower, I hang it on a hook to dry.  After one month, the sandpaper delaminated at the small end on both sides.  Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> I used to love the Red Clover foot files, but the quality of those has declined in recent years.  This foot file&lt;br /&gt;seems more durable than the newer Red Clover&#x27;s.  So far I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
    <li> This is about the best  file I have ever used...</li>
    <li> This works great, I use it a few times a week after the shower and it keeps them in good shape. I did get a little overzealous at first and rubbed my heel raw but now I know I don&#x27;t need to rub so hard or so much.</li>
    <li> Gets the job done and has a convenient little hanging hole.</li>
    <li> Best file on the market.  However, it gets dull a bit too soon.  You will may want to purchase more than one at a time.</li>
</ol>
