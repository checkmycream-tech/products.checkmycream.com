      <li>Worth it!!!</li>
      <li>That aside, though pheromones don&#x27;t increase a womans sexual attractiveness to men, it does increase confidence and makes the woman feel more sensual, which can result in a woman being more sexually attractive to men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>Fast delivery - wife loved it!</li>
      <li>I love this fragrance and was able to purchase it at an amazing price.  </li>
      <li>this is not some kind of love potion that will bewitch men into liking you,however you might receive better treatment from some of them, they might be more friendly,polite and talkative then ever    </li>
      <li>SO VERY MUCH!!!</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>My man classifies it as sexy and provocative.</li>
      <li>More on the musky side.  </li>

      <li>I can&#x27;t say that it is my favorite perfume or scent, but it does appear to have that pheromone effect that others have commented on.</li>
      <li>Not as exiting as the famous Andron pheromone cologne by Jovan in the 80s.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I found it.</li>
      <li>Seems like my husband&#x27;s glad</li>

      <li>am sure its working on the guys as well........</li>
      <li>noticed my hubby likes it on me too :)</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I seem to recall women used to always smell pretty with their own signature scents on,  Not so much any more. Well the wife moved on after buying this perfume, honestly it Made my wife smell like a two dollar wh well you get the picture, she bought the perfume threw on makeup and went on Craigs list, met a guy and moved out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thank&#x27;s Relm. you smell great. .</li>
    <li> I was so hoping this would be a beautiful fragrance for me, but that was not to be.  First, I spritzed it into the air and&lt;br /&gt;it smelled pretty, but after about 15 minutes the pretty wore off and what was left was not pleasant to me.  It reminded me of old perfume that had gone rancid.  I then thought I would try it on my skin, thinking perhaps that would make a difference; it did not.  I noticed in the other reviews that many said they got  compliments when they wore it out in public, but I never tried wearing it around other people. I will say that the smell in the room and on me lasted for many hours, so if one enjoys this fragrance, it is enduring.</li>
    <li> The scent is too strong for my taste. I used it sparingly and it still seems overpowering. Have to try something else.</li>
    <li> I love this smell..I would have given it 5 stars but Im yet to snag a date based on the pheromones lol.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t wear perfume often but I wanted something a bit different and more sensual and I&#x27;m so glad I got this. Seems like my husband&#x27;s glad I got it too:) I don&#x27;t put much on at all because if I were to use a full spray, it would be too strong for me; however, a small amount still does the trick. This is definitely going to be the perfume I use all the time.</li>
    <li> this smells so nice on my friend, so I got me some. I will Not be wearing it! It goes on strong and smells way too spicy then it is almost totally gone an hour or so after I have gagged waiting for the scent to mellow. I am so disappointed! thank goodness it is not expensive since it is not returnable.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I always get rave reviews when I wear it. It makes me feel good too! Great scent. Hard to find in stores.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t been able to find this interesting stores.  Love it and great price</li>
    <li> This is a great product.I love it been using it for years.&lt;br /&gt;And what a big bottle for the price.You cant beat it.&lt;br /&gt;Have noticed my hubby likes it on me too :)</li>
    <li> I was looking for a perfum with pheronomes (if it exist), they add this product as if it real. Didn&#x27;t smell as perfum really  didn&#x27;t smell, nor last. I didn&#x27;t return because it was too expensive to do it, and doesn&#x27;t worth to spent more money. An other   scam.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance! Had not heard of it before I bought it and ordered it purely based on tons of reviews regarding the lasting smelling power. Worth it!!! The smell seemed to change throughout the day where it smelled like vanilla at first and then changed to a spicy pepper smell. I really enjoy the fragrance and would order again.</li>
    <li> If you like a soft scent that smells better on you the longer you wear it, you will like this one.</li>
    <li> This is the other &amp;#34;version&amp;#34; of the Realm perfume. It has a stronger muskier smell, but I still like this one also.</li>
    <li> I just got my order today and OMG! I love it. It gets better the longer it&#x27;s on.. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> And lower priced!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I much prefer Realm&#x27;s original scent for women to their Inner Realm, but I get more compliments with Inner Realm. The fragrance notes for this are mandarin, water lily, sandalwood, vanilla and honey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I became intrigued about pheromones when this seemingly gimmicky cologne came out and decided to do some reading on them. It seems that regarding sexual attraction and pheromones, they only increase the sexual attractiveness of men. Men are mostly visually stimulated whereas us women are much more complicated(note there is no pharmaceutical Viagra for women). Smell means more to us than men by far when it comes to sexual attractiveness. That aside, though pheromones don&#x27;t increase a womans sexual attractiveness to men, it does increase confidence and makes the woman feel more sensual, which can result in a woman being more sexually attractive to men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said before, I prefer this to Inner Realm. I feel more confident when I wear this and probably a bit more sensual. I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because even though it doesn&#x27;t smell cheap, it doesn&#x27;t have the same umph as say Ralph Lauren or Calvin Klein perfumes, which are more evening perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good purchase. Very nice price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is for daytime wear</li>
    <li> I was surprised at how many people here say they like the smell; I find the scent anoyingly sweet, not classy and it does linger on. It did nothing for my husband, who&#x27;s as H---- as they come. Not as exiting as the famous Andron pheromone cologne by Jovan in the 80s. Wish they&#x27;d bring it back! My current fragrance is Givency&#x27;s Organza edt.</li>
    <li> I came across this perfume and was intrigued by its use of pheromones. I had read about the effect of pheromones on others and was curious to experiment a bit. It is not what I would consider a high cost perfume so I decided to give it a try. I can&#x27;t say that it is my favorite perfume or scent, but it does appear to have that pheromone effect that others have commented on. The first time I tried it on, I definitely got a reaction from my man - oh là là! The scent is definitely subtle, but lingers for quite a while. It has what I would classify as a slightly spicy oriental scent. My man classifies it as sexy and provocative. It seems to have a similar effect on others as well - I get many more comments and casual stares from this scent than I have from my personal favorites.</li>
    <li> One of the bottles leaked plus it doesn&#x27;t smell quite like the perfume I used before.  Doesn&#x27;t last as long.  Disappointing.</li>
    <li> Thanks! Great price! Love this perfume and I have been using it for about 12 years. Thanks for an easy transaction. :)</li>
    <li> I love perfumes!  This smell is very nice!  More on the musky side.  I like it!  Great packaging!  Pheromone perfume.  My first.  We&#x27;ll see!</li>
    <li> The perfume is off the chain, smells of something I can&#x27;t quite put into words. But the only thing I dislike is the fact of it not lasting long enough. I would spray realm on my neck wrist and so forth, and it would be gone in a hour or two. I love this product but it doesn&#x27;t Last Long Enough.</li>
    <li> My favorite all time fragrance. Never tire of it and always receive compliments when I&#x27;m wearing it.</li>
    <li> I like it very much&lt;br /&gt;very plesant smel&lt;br /&gt;I use it every day and very satisfied&lt;br /&gt;Will buy it again</li>
    <li> I must admit, I was wondering how well this would actually work since it was so cheap. But after reading so many great reviews I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right off the bat I loved the smell! Its like a sweet, senual smell with hints of woodsy spice and a clean finish. But still, for under $20 I was initially expecting a low percentage of poor quality pheromones. And while the percentage is lower than other brands, the quality of the pheromones in this perfume make up for that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this for 2 reasons: The first is because I am a waitress, and the second is because my former coworker and I have been flirting and hanging out together for months but nothing has ever happened and so I wanted to steer things in my favor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I almost always get 20% tips AND I have a boyfriend lol!</li>
    <li> Wonderful fragrance!&lt;br /&gt;Exactly as I remember it.  The bottle had a tiny imperfection,  and the sprayer seems to barely work though.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife because she liked my Realm for Men.  It has a different scent but we both really like it.</li>
    <li> Love this perfume, have worn for years and get lots of compliments</li>
    <li> Have had many ask what I was wearing..........too bad they were girls lol.&lt;br /&gt;I am sure its working on the guys as well........ I am buying another bottle. You can&#x27;t go wrong for less than 17.00 a bottle. Its well worth it.</li>
    <li> I use this perfume when I go out, I use this and you just sit back and watch the men notice you and start checking you out .&lt;br /&gt;The men smile and speak and even make some talk. It&#x27;s not one or two either it quite a few all day long.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of realm. Nothing smells like this. The first time I tried it I was hooked. Its a very unique perfume. I will always buy realm. It arrived fast. And a great price. Thank you so much.</li>
    <li> did not order this off of amazon but did buy this in the mall an i have to say i was skeptical at first but within hours of just having it on i got compliments hell i even got a discount at the place i usually eat an people where much more nice an talkative to me this smells a little too much at first but after awhile you get use to it i love this an will be wearing this constantly try this is out you definitely won&#x27;t regret it it will help you out a lot especially to get what you want : )</li>
    <li> I was looking forward to the arrival of this product, imagining the men flocking to my side…laying coats over puddles, carrying all my kids stuff for me, mowing the lawn to offer a little help to my awesome hubby...etc. I eagerly opened the box and took a big whiff of it. Whoa! My first thought was that it smelled very strong. It wasn&#x27;t my &amp;#34;usual&amp;#34; scent style, but I still had visions of masses of men flooding towards me, so I powered through it and applied. To my surprise it ended up being a nice smell on me. And while I&#x27;ve stepped in quite a few puddles, carried my kids stuff like a sweaty pack mule, and the lawn hasn&#x27;t been mowed…I&#x27;ve seen quite a few women behind me at the checkout being asked out on dates…weird.</li>
    <li> When I first put this on it was really strong smelling, but after a while, when the scent mellows on my skin it smells really nice.  I like it.</li>
    <li> It is a good idea to not blast yourself with this at close range. It would be overpowering.  Hold it further away from your skin than you would another cologne or perfume and spray lightly.  It might be a little strong, but it is too good to pass up.  It has staying power, and seems to transform after being on your skin for awhile. I could still smell it slightly on arising the next morning.  I have worn it twice since receiving it, and received a lot of hugs both days.  Does it draw the hugs, or does it make me feel magnetic and that draws the hugs?  I can&#x27;t say.  I do like this fragrance.  It is worth adjusting your application method.  I plan on purchasing this product again for myself, and  gifting it to someone this Christmas.</li>
    <li> I am pretty sure that the bottle they sent me had been on a shelf for the last 15 years. It smelled old and rancid. I have been wearing Realm for many years, but this is the first and the last time I will buy it online.</li>
    <li> i remember when this came out, i was excited. used to wear jovan&#x27;s andron for women in junior high and that was a similar type fragrance. i don&#x27;t really know if it &amp;#34;works&amp;#34; but it certainly smells great. getting hard to find. this happens with uninhibited by cher, which was my signature fragrance in the late 80&#x27;s.That was unfortunately discontinued. this is a slightly sweet seductive understated scent. not overpowering when applied normally.</li>
    <li> I love this sweet musky scent. My husband seems to like it as well. This is one of my favorite perfumes. I have been using it during the past year and I am almost out. I will definitely re-order some more at some point. It is ethereal and earthy.</li>
    <li> When I first bought this scent about 20 years ago, (am I showing my age? lol) I adored it. At that time it was almost $20 an ounce, (OUCH) so glad the price has dropped to a more realistic number. Love the smell, the compliments etc, So glad I bought this. :)</li>
    <li> Such a good price! Thank yous!</li>
    <li> Can no longer find in department store. Thanks for carrying this. I am allergic to all other colognes and perfumes but Realm. Love it, just bought 2 more.</li>
    <li> Perfect. Just as I remember. One of my husbands favorite fragrance on me.</li>
    <li> rich&#x27;s stopped selling years ago, couldnt find it. AWSOME! amazon had it, and for a crazy price. this is a wonderful produt that inhances your pharmone, i get lots fo complements on it. i love it.</li>
    <li> impressed me. No erox aroma effect. Bottle is hard to hold and spray...however it looks modern and atractive on a table.</li>
    <li> Okay, just a regular perfume, Nothing Special.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance and was able to purchase it at an amazing price.  The ordering/receiving process was EXCELLENT!  Am and WELL pleased.  THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH!!!</li>
    <li> Item received promptly.  I would recommend this to most people and I love the smell and would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Very sexy scent! I&#x27;ve received more compliments from men on this perfume than anything! Strangers even ask &amp;#34; what is that great smell?&amp;#34; I&#x27;ll never give out of this!</li>
    <li> Very nice product! Warm and gentle scent.</li>
    <li> X_X at first I did not like this scent very much, it to strong and spicy for my taste but after the 2nd day of wearing this fragrance I got used to the spicy scent and started liking it slowly. a couple spritzes here and there is good enough(and the scent and pheromones do last a long time), if you spray to much you will get a headache and its very unnecessary . and the pheromones do seem to work a little(some guys I work with were more polite to me then ever),but do not expect too have a large amount of men all over you! this is not some kind of love potion that will bewitch men into liking you,however you might receive better treatment from some of them, they might be more friendly,polite and talkative then ever    I give this 4 stars because it works, the smell will just have to be getting used to</li>
    <li> This is my signature perfume I&#x27;ve used it for years and will always return to this fragrance, I receive compliments all the time!</li>
    <li> Each person&#x27;s body chemistry is different and I&#x27;ll start by saying the top notes of this fragrance are awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it dries down the pheromone scent becomes obvious (at least to me) and its kind of like burned pork. Not attractive at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other odd thing I noted is that males around me became VERY aggressive on days i wore this fragrance. Not aggressive with me but aggressive in general. I think that the pheromone blend in here works, but to the degree it makes one attractive I am not sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wear it.</li>
    <li> A gift to a mother b*day makes such a great gift.. and is a whole lot cheaper then buying it from the stores..</li>
    <li> Great cologne, but wish they had in a perfume oil form, but still love the scent! Love it!  It&#x27;s a great buy and seller is great on this product!!</li>
    <li> Smells like an old lady! I saw so many good reviews on this spray so I ordered it.  It has a raunchy smell and needless to say it does not work.  WARNING: If you buy it, only use a PINCH of this spray, it&#x27;s extremely strong, bold, cheap smell.</li>
    <li> I am a little surprised at all the favorable reviews for this scent.  Of course, all the positive feedback is the reason I purchased this scent.  I wish I had smelled it in a store, I would never have bought it.  Luckily, I didn&#x27;t pay too much for it, but still, what a waste of money!  The smell is cloying and gave me a bit of a headache.  I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s partially my fault, I sprayed on a bit too much, but it doesn&#x27;t change the fact the smell is bad.  Sickeningly sweet and cheap smelling.  My husband told me I smelled like an old church lady.  He also says he likes sexy scents on me better.&lt;br /&gt;As far as the effectiveness of the pheromones, it&#x27;s hard to say.  I only could bring myself to wear it one time, during which I did have some brief friendly interactions with a couple of guys and more importantly, my husband was all over me. . .but that&#x27;s normal!  So, I don&#x27;t know.  The way the perfume smelled was most important to me, and it&#x27;s pretty awful.</li>
    <li> The product was shipped promptly but  unfortunately I didn&#x27;t care for the smell.  I am going to send it back.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this for years. It used to be far more expensive--glad its not anymore. It&#x27;s not a light, fruity or floral scent. It is some sort of synthetic pheromone. It does work. let the pheromone, not the scent,  do its job by making sure you spray this and then walk through it, otherwise it could easily get overwhelming.</li>
    <li> I really like this perfume .</li>
    <li> I have been wearing Realm for many years. I try to keep an extra bottle on hand because it isn&#x27;t always easy to find. The online price was less than I have ever paid. The shipping was fast; it was nice to have it come to me. I will definitely purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> This was a bit spicier of a scent than I expected. I haven&#x27;t gotten any &amp;#34;looks&amp;#34; or compliments on it. My boyfriend says it&#x27;s &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34;. Overall not very satisfied with this, esp after reading all the great reviews about it.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t tell if it works or not. My friend like the smell. Some also say that the scent is mild, but I feel like its to much, but I always put on too much.</li>
    <li> I wore this years ago and didn&#x27;t think I would be able to find this again...  I get a lot of  &amp;#34;what are you wearing&amp;#34; ? !</li>
    <li> Daily someone will ask me what I am wearing.  Of course I smile and tell them. The scent is not overwhelmning, it&#x27;s soothing to me. Will order another bottle soon to make sure I do not run out.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery - wife loved it!</li>
    <li> Love this! Great scent for me. This has a deep scent and is not flowery IMHO. Something I would want to know, as I am not into florals as fragrance. I really don&#x27;t know how to describe fragrance notes, I just know I like it, and I get lots of compliments. Has something that seems to attact men LOL :) Stays on for hours, well, at least my hubby says so. I also wear it as part of a trio of fragrances that makeup my unique scent. Lancome Tresor and PS Design are the other two. I layer the three, Design 1st (spray on my hair &amp; body), then Tresor and finish with Realm behind my ears and on decollete. I know this seems like overkill but it works for me, and no one has ever mentioned that it is too strong. (Like my grown kids, and believe me, they would tell me if they thought it was to much!)&lt;br /&gt;Start with smaller amount and see how it goes for you. This combination of three gets me more compliments than I can say, from men and women. Almost everytime I go out of the house (no kidding) someone wants to know what perfume I&#x27;m wearing!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to Amazon for having all of these available, as I can&#x27;t find two of these in my area anymore. This is always on my Christmas wish list if anyone asks.LOL! Amazon has great price.&lt;br /&gt;So I hope this helps someone, I love it!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I used to wear it all the time. I&#x27;m glad I found it. It smells so clean and refreshing. The product arrived early and was packaged well. I will use this company in the future. Great product, fast and cheap shipping,...I give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Beautiful sultry scent. My husband loves it! I was skeptical at first, but after trying it for about a week, the responses were out of this world!</li>
    <li> Great fragarance.  My wife enjoys the atmosphere it creates. Excellent price.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume. It isn&#x27;t floral or overwhelming like a lot of women&#x27;s perfume tends to be. I&#x27;ve been using it for years and will continue to use it until it&#x27;s no longer available or I die, whichever comes first! haha &#x3D;]</li>
    <li> Everyone is soooo chatty with me now. I really notice a difference. When i first put it on. It smells really floral. But after a ouple hours it changes. I started to notice it was more like warm vanilla. Love it so much. I used to forget to wear my perfume all of the time. Not anymore. I get mad if i realize ive forgotten it.</li>
    <li> I smell like Vanilla with this wonderful perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How wonderful it is...unique...!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it...and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Great perfume at a GREAT price. I have been buying this fo years in the store and could not believe the bargain. It arrived before date expected.</li>
    <li> It is not bad for the price.  It has a nice scent, but I have not received any compliments on it. I most likely will not purchase it again. I&#x27;ve used it off and on for several months now.  I will search for something else in the future.</li>
    <li> This is the first perfume that my wife wore when we met and it still brings back wonderful memories with the wonderful scent you will never forget.</li>
    <li> Everytime I&#x27;m wearing it people ask me what I&#x27;m wearing. Very liltte goes long way so don&#x27;t use lot, it is strong.</li>
    <li> The purchase was quick and easy.  It has a bit of a cinnamon, orange and asiatic smell. Do not spray too much otherwise, it is a bit too musky.</li>
    <li> Realm has always been my favorite! I&#x27;ve been wearing it for years! It makes me feel good! I guess you could say its my signature scent! Love it!</li>
    <li> I loved this scent when it first came out and it is just as I remembered it.  The only down side is that the spray nozzle lets out barely a drizzle and some of the liquid seeps out from under the spray cap onto my hand.  If necessary, I will take the cap off and put the cologne into another bottle.  This stuff is too good to miss.  I hope this is just my bottle and not a widespread defect.  March 12, 2015 - The sprayer that came with the bottle never worked properly.   I have to buy a bottle for it, break the cap and pour it into another bottle or else I will not be able to enjoy it.   No matter.   I love the scent.  It&#x27;s worth it.   When it debuted, I bought the roll on for my cousin to keep in her purse and she flipped!  Realm is not for everyone, but if you like it....get it.</li>
    <li> Shipping was okay therefore they earned the one star BUT The smell was bad. The packaging was horrible.  Wish I did not buy this product.  I would not recommend the product nor would I buy from the seller again.  I threw it away.</li>
    <li> Not fond of it.  Read reviews but doesn&#x27;t work for me.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I really like the smell of this! I do not like sweet, flowerly scents. I like my scents to be more spicy and sassy like myself! It is hard to find that happy medium though. I do not want to smell like a spice cabinet! But spicy is sexy! My husband loves it and I have been stopped by someone I did not know a few times asking me what it is. However, I usually say, &amp;#34;Oh I do not remember which one I put on today&amp;#34;. I say this because I like the fact that it is not a smell that everyone has. It is not a familiar smell. It is different and it is sexy!</li>
