<li> It smells awful and burns incredibly when you put it on.</li>
<li> The tube is pretty small and usually, when I open the tube, a big glob of the gel accident squirts out all over....</li>
<li> It helps, but not completely.</li>
<li> No more unsightly red bumps for me!</li>
<li> When you push down on the cap, you apply pressure to the tube.</li>
<li> You need to push down and turn the cap.  </li>
<li> for a couple of seconds after applying.&lt;br /&gt;-Kind of expensive for those of us who need such a product regularly.</li>
<li> at least until the tube is about half empty.</li>
<li> Even after putting it on, it did not do anything different than a thin lotion or oil would do.</li>
<li> THE ITCHING AND BURNING IS DIMINISHED WITHIN A FEW MINUTES.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
<li> and i swear by them they treat those painful ingrown hairs and if you apply right after shaving prevents them ...</li>

    <li> Didn&#x27;t work still had razor bumps:(</li>
    <li> No more unsightly red bumps for me! Because I only shave about once a month, I was getting a lot of red bumps &amp; stuff. Once i STARTED USING THIS, i FELT LIKE cINDY cRAWFORD. Ooops, didnt realize I hit the CAPS button! My bad.</li>
    <li> I put this on after shaving and it burned and stung horribly. Also smells very strong and chemically. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT NOT ONLY WORKS IN THE BIKINI AREA......I USE IT UNDER MY ARMS AND MY UPPER LIP AFTER WAXING AR SHAVING. I HAVE ALSO USED IT ON MY EYEBROW AREA!! THE ITCHING AND BURNING IS DIMINISHED WITHIN A FEW MINUTES. GOOD PRICE. FAST SHIPPING. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for years - no redness, no bumps - works great! Even suggested it to my husband to use after he shaves his head. He loves it too and will never use anything else again - the performance is far superior to any after-shave.</li>
    <li> I use the after shave gel religiously.  Helps to reduce bumps and irritation... just like it says.  Would not be without it!</li>
    <li> This stuff is ah-maz-ing. For the first time I had zero annoying itchy razor bumps after shaving my bikini area. For $5 bucks, how can you not buy it?</li>
    <li> This is my first time using this product it glides on smooth and it leaves your skin feeling really smooth. Takes the itch away and it doesn&#x27;t burn my skin. I&#x27;m glad I found this product because I have sensitive skin and using shaving cream just made my skin burn and itch like hell!</li>
    <li> This stuff really works! I put it on right after shaving and I never get and razor burn. It smells kind of like menthol.</li>
    <li> The product is okay once you get the cap off.  The cap is child proof.  You need to push down and turn the cap.  The problem is........It&#x27;s a TUBE.  When you push down on the cap, you apply pressure to the tube. When the cap comes off, the stuff squirts everywhere.  Why they would put this type of cap on this product is beyond me.  The stuff is completely clear and dries pretty quickly.  It works ok.  it doesn&#x27;t completely eliminate bumps after shaving or waxing, but it helps.  It minimizes the redness.  I would recommend.</li>
    <li> smells awful but the smell does not last.  It definitely helps reduce irritation and red bumbs in the bikini-zone after a shave.  I&#x27;ve been very happy with the product and I do recommend it.  The tube is pretty small and usually, when I open the tube, a big glob of the gel accident squirts out all over....at least until the tube is about half empty. That part annoys me.  But the gel itself works well.</li>
    <li> Difficult to open. Almost squeezed it but failed.</li>
    <li> Omg ive been using Bikini Zone products for over 5 years and i swear by them they treat those painful ingrown hairs and if you apply right after shaving prevents them ...some times i try and be slick and wont apply it after shaving and everytime i prove myself wrong i need this stuff ...Also i shave once a week and this 7 dollar tube has lasted 7 months so its not like you have to buy to often ...</li>
    <li> Not sure if it helped or if it was in my head.</li>
    <li> I would not buy this again. It smells awful and burns incredibly when you put it on. Even after putting it on, it did not do anything different than a thin lotion or oil would do. I threw mine away.</li>
    <li> I always get a rash after I shave, and this product did nothing for me to get rid of the bumps and irritation.</li>
    <li> PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-Within seconds eliminates any pain or itching.&lt;br /&gt;-Dries quickly.&lt;br /&gt;-Gentle enough for use in the most intimate areas of the bikini region (I speak from experience).&lt;br /&gt;-One application provides relief for hours or all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;-Does not get rid of bikini bumps.&lt;br /&gt;-Stings for a couple of seconds after applying.&lt;br /&gt;-Kind of expensive for those of us who need such a product regularly.</li>
    <li> I use the Bikini Zone Anti Bump shave gel first and afterwards I use the Bikini Zone After Shave gel the burning is suppose to happen to get into the hair folecules but these are some awesome products!!! Works great with excellent results EVERYTIME</li>
    <li> Works very well. Much better than the creme version. Just wish it wasnt as expensive for such a little tube.</li>
    <li> it did not actually kept the bumps away but it did cool the itch. I might think about buying it again, probably.</li>
    <li> Use witch hazel oil during shaving. Works 100% of the time. I still get razor bumps with this product. It helps, but not completely.</li>
