      <li>but i love how it feel when i put it in my hands just like garnier fructis products i have used some of the products before and love the results</li>
      <li>Lightweight and seems to be safe for color-treated hair, as claimed, but this seems more like a styling gel rather than a leave-in conditioner.</li>
      <li>I love that Garnier Fructis now has a Color Shield line of products.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping, good packaging.</li>
      <li>its really light weight...not the density for a leave in conditioner</li>
      <li>I  have been using this product a long time and have great results after sampooing.</li>

      <li>I love using this after I towel dry my hair.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think it really &amp;#34;seals&amp;#34; in my color, though.</li>
      <li>Recommend it very highly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ronv</li>
      <li>It really protects the color.  </li>
      <li>From $35 Salon products to everyday drugstore brands &amp; this is by far my favorite!</li>
      <li>other than that its fine.</li>
      <li>I ended up throwing mine away, these did absolutely nothing to keep the red.</li>
      <li>I put it on first on my wet hair</li>

<li> I have purple and green hair and this makes the colors stay vibrate forever.</li>
<li> I am not sure about this stuff yet.</li>
<li> Hard to find.  </li>
<li> Just gets sticky and hard.</li>

    <li> I love this stuff! I put it on first on my wet hair and then I put on my styling gel. It makes the gel much more pliable. I don&#x27;t think it really &amp;#34;seals&amp;#34; in my color, though. But it does make my hair soft and supple. :-) I hope to use it forever!</li>
    <li> LOVE this product! My review of this (&amp; most hair care products in general) is based on 2 important things: 1).How well the product works at the time of use AND 2).How well the product has performed over long-term use-And this product has earned FIVE STARS for BOTH! Plus there&#x27;s the added bonus of cheap pricing! Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;ll spend money on a  hair product IF it really works and believe me, I&#x27;ve tried them all AND spent some serious money in the process. From $35 Salon products to everyday drugstore brands &amp; this is by far my favorite! It instantly conditions &amp; smooths my hair, yet is so lightweight I use it everyday without my hair feeling weighed down or flat. It keeps my RED color vibrant &amp; Healthy! Definitely reccomend!</li>
