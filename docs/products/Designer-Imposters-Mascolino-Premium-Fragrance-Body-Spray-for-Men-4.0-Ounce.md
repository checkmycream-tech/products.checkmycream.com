      <li>For the record, I own BOTH Masculino and Acqua di Gio.</li>
      <li>I have found some scents that are close to the real stuff with aqua H2O being the best</li>

      <li>This body spray is great and does smell very much like</li>

      <li>I love this Body spray.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>What&#x27;s more, this cologne spray LASTS.</li>
      <li>It is about 1000 times better than Axe, Tag or those types - you can wear it without feeling like a teenager.  </li>
      <li>Ok after all the great reviews on here i decided to go to walmart to check this product out to see if the hype is for real cause honestly if it is just as good as the real acqui di gio who wouldn&#x27;t purchase this instead besides for namesake.</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t smell like fish. :)</li>
      <li>Firstly, I love Acqua Di Gio.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this body spray and I am super picky!</li>
      <li>Its way better than the products available in the market.  </li>
      <li>, Masculino wasn&#x27;t near as lemony as Acqua di Gio which I was happy about.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth way more than that</li>
      <li>I actually really enjoy this one.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;This would be perfect for fragrance starters, especially teens who don&#x27;t have the money to buy real fragrances.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Refreshing fragrance that keeps the ladies interested.  </li>
      <li>And it is worth every penny!</li>
      <li>I have gotten several compliments since I first bought it 3 hours ago, great stuff buy it while you can</li>
      <li>my husband has a shelf full of colognes but when we hang out I always ask him to use this spray.</li>
      <li>I smelled it on a gentle man it left a great impression,  </li>
      <li>Pay less and get great smell....</li>
      <li>The scent is fantastic and the women I know really seem to respond to it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s totally worth it though.</li>
      <li>Just go out and buy the real thing or seek another original fragrance for yourself.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had this spray before and it&#x27;s exactly how I remember.</li>
      <li>When you factor in the price I dare you to find a better overall scent.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d been wearing it for a few weeks and the funny thing is, I&#x27;d been getting compliments from GUYS, &#x27;cause it&#x27;s THAT good.</li>
      <li>i love it, its very similar to the georgio armani alternative.</li>
      <li>I first discovered this body spray at Target.  </li>
      <li>but this by far does not compare with the original.</li>
      <li>They have several other fragrances that are great too</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t write online reviews for products unless I am really a ardent and avid user of the product.</li>
      <li>I get more compliments on this product, than the $60 stuff I used to buy...and it lasts twice as long!</li>
      <li>But it fades much too fast and is overpriced.</li>
      <li>Well to start off it smells like the real stuff</li>
      <li>only caution that those who are always trying to find a way to seek cheap imitations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>wouldn&#x27;t recommend the fragrance Eau de Toilette version of this to substitute the real Armani.</li>
      <li>Such a great alternative to the real thing!&lt;br /&gt;Smells just like it, and at a small fraction of the price.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
      <li>I have smelled the true Giorgio Armani Acqua de Gio and I can tell you this is that but way longer lasting.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never received as many compliments from any other cologne than this stuff!    </li>
      <li>(impulse by mainly...</li>
      <li>I now use it exclusively now as my main scent.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>I have been searching for quite a long time for something that would blend quality and moderate price at the same time, a rare blend which i found in this product which i am so pleased to use.</li>
      <li>Its strong enough that you do not need to use a lot - and one application will last all day!    </li>
      <li>Strangley after trying several items to keep a 12 year old smelling fresh this works.  </li>
      <li>its a must, last long, its strong and its a spray.</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t buy it here, it can also be found in most Targets (that&#x27;s where I usually obtain it).</li>
      <li>, I work with a suit so it often gets hot especially in Florida.</li>
      <li>But in addition to them, I had a girl come up to me and mistake it completely for Armani&#x27;s Acqua di Gio</li>
      <li>Masculino, however, was still subtle and very nice smelling; it not only smelled just like the Acqua di Gio, it also did not have the extra \\&quot;sweat\\&quot; smell that I did not like with the Acqua di Gio; not only that</li>
      <li>Most cologne sprays have a very cheap note to them; you can tell something is missing, wrong or just off about them.</li>
      <li>only thing I have against masculino is that it is much subtler after a few hours compared to Acqua di Gio, so you may have to spray yourself over twice if you need to smell nice for extended periods (this only applies if you want other people to smell you from a distance).</li>
      <li>The smell lasts so long and the price is so reasonable.</li>
      <li>purchased this for my 5 year old son so that he would feel like a big boy wearing cologne ...</li>
      <li>It is an extreme fraction of the price and lasts much longer.</li>
      <li>TOO LATE, even if youre a girl, its cool.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I know it may seem cliche to say this, but I promise you that this will get the ladies to compliment you. I just picked it up at Wal-Mart one day (impulse by mainly...I liked the tiger design on the front) and it was just amazing. I counted 13 different women compliment me on this fragrance. At the checkout at a store, walking through the store, at college, just everywhere. I have smelled the true Giorgio Armani Acqua de Gio and I can tell you this is that but way longer lasting. I can&#x27;t tell the difference. It is an extreme fraction of the price and lasts much longer. Pick this up and you cannot be disappointed.    -Christopher.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this body spray and I am super picky! my husband has a shelf full of colognes but when we hang out I always ask him to use this spray. it&#x27;s hard to find in stores so we have to start ordering it online. It&#x27;s totally worth it though. This spray rocks!!!</li>
    <li> I have gotten several compliments since I first bought it 3 hours ago, great stuff buy it while you can</li>
    <li> I started buying this for about 2-3 years now and I cannot even count the amount of compliments that I received from it.    Walmart&#x27;s price is only $3! It&#x27;s worth way more than that if you ask me!    I will never buy expensive cologne again. I&#x27;ve never received as many compliments from any other cologne than this stuff!    Its strong enough that you do not need to use a lot - and one application will last all day!    They have several other fragrances that are great too but this one tops them all!</li>
    <li> I put it on and instantly i felt a heavenly breeze overcome my soul and take me on a journey to the heights of ecstasy. Buy it, NOW, DO IT BEFORE ITS TOO LATE, even if youre a girl, its cool. If i met a girl and she smelled like this, OMIGOSH, imma tell her to stop drop and roll cuz she on fireeee!..........peace</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know anything about designer scents, but seeing the amazing reviews on this and all of its variants, I decided to give it a shot. I&#x27;d been wearing it for a few weeks and the funny thing is, I&#x27;d been getting compliments from GUYS, &#x27;cause it&#x27;s THAT good. But in addition to them, I had a girl come up to me and mistake it completely for Armani&#x27;s Acqua di Gio and that&#x27;s when I knew this was it.</li>
    <li> Such a great alternative to the real thing!&lt;br /&gt;Smells just like it, and at a small fraction of the price.&lt;br /&gt;Will never buy the name brands again.</li>
    <li> Firstly, I love Acqua Di Gio. The scent is fantastic and the women I know really seem to respond to it. But it fades much too fast and is overpriced. So you can imagine how excited I was to find a cologne spray which mirrors that wonderful scent. Most cologne sprays have a very cheap note to them; you can tell something is missing, wrong or just off about them. That is not the case here. What&#x27;s more, this cologne spray LASTS. And it is insanely inexpensive. If you don&#x27;t buy it here, it can also be found in most Targets (that&#x27;s where I usually obtain it). And it is worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I love this Body spray. its a must, last long, its strong and its a spray.</li>
    <li> I first discovered this body spray at Target.  It is about 1000 times better than Axe, Tag or those types - you can wear it without feeling like a teenager.  It lasts a lot longer than the big-name ones, too.  Perfect for days where you don&#x27;t want to use your cologne, but still want to smell nice; women give me compliments all the time when I wear it.</li>
    <li> I get more compliments on this product, than the $60 stuff I used to buy...and it lasts twice as long!</li>
    <li> Purchased 4 cans for my son. Strangley after trying several items to keep a 12 year old smelling fresh this works.  He loves it and the response he gets from friends and family (not to mention girls at school)makes him blush and proud. I smelled it on a gentle man it left a great impression,  I thought it would be costly or foreign...it was neither. I should have purchased a box.  It is great. I even gave one can to my guy (fortysomething years) as a gift, he is crazy about it.</li>
    <li> I own a Armani Acqua Di Gio myself, and compared the differences. This body spray is great and does smell very much like the original Armani.&lt;br /&gt;The longevity is quite good too. What&#x27;s great about this spray is the price tag for it. If you&#x27;re seeking a body spray for a workout, or as a deodorant spray for construction/carpentry work, then this is for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would be perfect for fragrance starters, especially teens who don&#x27;t have the money to buy real fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;However, I usually don&#x27;t buy \\&quot;imposters\\&quot; or anything that smells similar to the real thing.&lt;br /&gt;Fake products usually means that the individual himself/herself is also a fake or fraud.&lt;br /&gt;I only caution that those who are always trying to find a way to seek cheap imitations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s all about the brand name and what you&#x27;re wearing that define who you are.&lt;br /&gt;I only purchased this spray to give it a try and review it myself personally.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t mind wearing it when I have to go for a good workout, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend the fragrance Eau de Toilette version of this to substitute the real Armani. Just go out and buy the real thing or seek another original fragrance for yourself.</li>
    <li> Refreshing fragrance that keeps the ladies interested.  What else needs to be said?  Good stuff that will keep things spicy.</li>
    <li> Usually I smell pretty bad. I&#x27;m allergic to shower water. So I decided to give this product a try.&lt;br /&gt;Now I don&#x27;t smell like fish. :)</li>
    <li> This body spray is really awesome.  Its way better than the products available in the market.  I use everyday morning and it lasts till 7pm in the evening.      I can say that this is the best product.</li>
    <li> Nice deo,,, cheap price and smells great..... I recommend this product.... received some good comments on this. Pay less and get great smell....</li>
    <li> Ok after all the great reviews on here i decided to go to walmart to check this product out to see if the hype is for real cause honestly if it is just as good as the real acqui di gio who wouldn&#x27;t purchase this instead besides for namesake. Well to start off it smells like the real stuff however it does not nearly last as long smell whore off after i had left abt a hour or so later from the walmart. Maybe the liquid eau de toilette version is longer lasting but this is not. I have found some scents that are close to the real stuff with aqua H2O being the best but this by far does not compare with the original.</li>
    <li> I work in a large retail setting and I get compliments at least once or twice a week on my smell. And from all types and ages of women. They almost always want to know what I&#x27;m wearing. Sometimes I say Armani ,and other times I tell them Mascolino. I tried this stuff by chance as a weekend bag type body spray. I now use it exclusively now as my main scent. I have used different(read expensive) colognes all my life. This will be my only choice for the foreseeable future. I don&#x27;t write online reviews for products unless I am really a ardent and avid user of the product.When you factor in the price I dare you to find a better overall scent.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for quite a long time for something that would blend quality and moderate price at the same time, a rare blend which i found in this product which i am so pleased to use. I love it.</li>
    <li> The best! Why? All the girls at work would pass by and say, &amp;#34;What is that great cologne you have on?&amp;#34; I &#x27;d say, &amp;#34;it&#x27;s not cologne, it&#x27;s like underarm deo!&amp;#34; Nuff said, it&#x27;s the ONLY deo that I wear now. I order it regularly on amazon. I can never find it in the drug store!</li>
    <li> purchased this for my 5 year old son so that he would feel like a big boy wearing cologne ... it smells great without that cheap cologne smell that you want to wash off of them immediately.  I actually really enjoy this one.  :)</li>
    <li> Originally got this as a kind of joke for my boyfriend (thought the name-mascolino-was funny) and ended up loving it on him!!!! Smells super sexy!!!</li>
    <li> I feel like a million bucks wearing this deodorant. Smells great all day, I work with a suit so it often gets hot especially in Florida. Will buy more when needed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this spray before and it&#x27;s exactly how I remember. Perfect! Arrived on time and undamaged. My girlfriend lives it too hah</li>
    <li> This product is all I expected it to be. It serves rhe purpose for which it was intended. Thank you</li>
    <li> nice product  very nice scent  i would buy this agian  great price point  lasts all day and so on and so on</li>
    <li> For the record, I own BOTH Masculino and Acqua di Gio. I decided to test these on each of my arms. I waited for a bit and after smelling, they were almost dead on identical. The Masculino had a slightly harsher scent at first, but after a little bit it dies down. After a few hours, I smelled both again and I have to say, even though I love Acqua di Gio, it has this sorta weird smell that comes up about an hour into wearing it; the smell is comparable to sweat and I&#x27;m not a fan. Masculino, however, was still subtle and very nice smelling; it not only smelled just like the Acqua di Gio, it also did not have the extra \\&quot;sweat\\&quot; smell that I did not like with the Acqua di Gio; not only that, Masculino wasn&#x27;t near as lemony as Acqua di Gio which I was happy about. I prefer this to the original...crazy right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I have against masculino is that it is much subtler after a few hours compared to Acqua di Gio, so you may have to spray yourself over twice if you need to smell nice for extended periods (this only applies if you want other people to smell you from a distance). It&#x27;s a great investment.</li>
    <li> This product smell great! i love it, its very similar to the georgio armani alternative. and for the price you really cant go wrong with this product.</li>
    <li> Hands down! Deodorant but smells like high-class perfume. The smell lasts so long and the price is so reasonable. I highly recommend this product.</li>
