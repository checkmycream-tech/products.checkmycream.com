      <li>This is a great buy (3 bottles).</li>
      <li>I bought it because of the great price and the reputation of the brand.</li>
      <li>A good buy.</li>
      <li>always a good product</li>
      <li>I love Nair!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
      <li>I use gloves to apply; (like the kind you use with hair dye) b/c</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very easy to apply, but kind of smelly.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m super happy with the results.</li>
      <li>Feeling brave, I then attempted to use this on armpits, but after 2 or 3 minutes I knew \\&quot;this is not going to work\\&quot; and I cleaned it off right away.  </li>
      <li>Even some of us older ladies, I&#x27;m 65, love to show off are legs and a great help in displaying gorgeous gams is Nair.</li>
      <li>If you buy it, make sure you follow the directions well.</li>
      <li>Despite my best judgement, I left it on.</li>
      <li>I say more?</li>
      <li>Now I&#x27;m going to go place an order for more on Amazon before they change the formula again.</li>
      <li>I love the ease of this product.  </li>
      <li>It is easy to wash off when I get into the shower and makes my skin very smooth.</li>
      <li>I had good success with the 7 minute run, and most importantly, there was no burning or irritation.  </li>
      <li>The Product Itself Is Just Fine</li>
      <li>I was lucky to get three bottles for $7.99!</li>
      <li>I just thought I should provide fair warning for those who have sensitive skin!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a fantastic alternative for leg shaving.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This was my first try using a depilatory and it worked ok for me.  </li>
      <li>It works great as long as you follow the directions.</li>
      <li>I have been using Nair hair removal products as long as I can remember and by far Nair products are the best.</li>
      <li>Satisfied, I did my entire legs, and was really pleased to see all that hair just wipe right off, and that I could sit and read a magazine while it was working!  </li>
      <li>I used a wet warm cloth to wipe the hair off and my legs were smooth!</li>
      <li>The results just weren&#x27;t worth</li>
      <li>Unsatisfied customers are the loudest, right?</li>
      <li>You&#x27;re thinking &amp;#34;look at all these positive reviews!</li>
      <li>The new formula smells better and seems to work the same or better.</li>
      <li>This is the first product I tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Today I tried this formulation for the first time.</li>
      <li>This product leaves your legs smooth and soft.</li>
      <li>Also, the chemical it contains seems to be very harmful to the skin if you keep it longer</li>
      <li>I bought the one with the baby oil and did not like it nearly as much.</li>
      <li>This one works well and is not irritating if you do these things:&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT leave on ANY longer than 4 minutes.</li>
      <li>The upside is that this is very affordable to try.</li>
      <li>Much cheaper on here.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Following these instructions, I notice I get much smoother and closer than with a razor and the job</li>
      <li>It has come a long way and the smell has improved and they have added stuff to make the body area feel smooth and</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to first start by saying anyone with sensitive skin or allergies may want to avoid this product.</li>
      <li>I have heard many complaints about the smell of depilatory creams previously but this one just smelled rather chemically with the aloe scent overlaying it and went away</li>
      <li>Highly recommend and this was a deal for the three pack.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>Nair works great when properly used (leave it on long enough but not too long).</li>
      <li>: I started using this product more often since during the spring and summer months your hair grows faster - and it seems like the results don&#x27;t even last a day because by the next day, the hair started to grow back under my arms (which is why I went from three stars to two stars).</li>
      <li>I have to apply it at least twice which wastes a lot of my time and the results aren&#x27;t all that great, plus it irritates my skin if I keep it on for longer than 3-4mins.</li>
      <li>I would not recommend this product to people with sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Much cheaper than buying in the local store.</li>
      <li>The hair washes away completely.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and didn&#x27;t want to try for longer than 5 minutes.</li>
      <li>I also do not have to suffer from the cuts I frequently get when shaving.</li>
      <li>Last so much longer than shaving</li>
      <li>Summer is fast approaching</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re going to use it near your bikini line, I advise caution.</li>
      <li>You just out this product on just like you old lotion.</li>
      <li>I have really sensitive skin, and it seems like ANYTHING will provoke a rash.</li>
      <li>completely overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have rather sensitive skin and</li>
      <li>I have used this on my legs, underarms, and near the bikini area.</li>
      <li>I know that after I finish this product, I&#x27;ll be looking for something else (or otherwise, I&#x27;d be using the cream every other day which is kind of a waste and an inconvenience for me).</li>
      <li>The hair wiped away as it should and left the skin fairly smooth but the dark root was very visible just under the skin and by the next day I had a stubble that needed shaving again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This obviously isn&#x27;t for everyone and should be tested first as it states on the back of the product.</li>
      <li>I have long thought I was from another planet, given that Nair-like products work on one part of me and do nothing someplace else, even in quantity, even after too much time.     </li>
      <li>No damage done, but for me I&#x27;ve decided that legs are fine, other sensitive areas will require other solutions.</li>
      <li>Surprisingly, this did the trick in about 5 minutes with minimal skin irritation (just some slight itchiness, but the same thing happens with shaving, so I&#x27;m not really concerned about it).</li>
      <li>/&gt;In general, depilatories just make me nervous though ---</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been shaving my legs for over 20 years and my shave barely lasts 8 hours.  </li>
      <li>I have moderately sensitive skin, so I&#x27;m terrified to leave anything on my skin for longer than recommended, but my hair is relatively thick so most other products did practically nothing in the recommended time frame.</li>
      <li>Not a single hair came off with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>These great reviews are fake (don&#x27;t be surprised, that&#x27;s common practice)</li>
      <li>Also, it didn&#x27;t dry out my skin, which was an unexpected plus.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is the worst product I&#x27;ve ever tried! I figured the \\&quot;soothing\\&quot; aloe would help, but just a few minutes after putting it on my legs were stinging, burning, and I was bleeding all over. And not one hair came off. I took the Nair all off half an hour ago, and it still hurts so bad I&#x27;m practically crying, even with the pain relief ointment I put on in the worst areas. I need to go take a pain killer, because it feels horrible.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving my legs for over 20 years and my shave barely lasts 8 hours.  I have heard many complaints about the smell of depilatory creams previously but this one just smelled rather chemically with the aloe scent overlaying it and went away completely overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was my first try using a depilatory and it worked ok for me.  I have rather sensitive skin and the instructions say the max is 10 minutes so I left it on about 7 minutes.  The hair wiped away as it should and left the skin fairly smooth but the dark root was very visible just under the skin and by the next day I had a stubble that needed shaving again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In general, depilatories just make me nervous though --- what if someone accidentally grabbed it and used it as shampoo or something?  Or if it was on my towel or hands after washing this off and then used it to wash or dry my hair after a shower (it takes some doing to get the goop off)? The results just weren&#x27;t worth the extra worries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this would probably work for some people depending on the person and their hair so despite the two stars, each person probably has to just try it out for themselves at least once.  The upside is that this is very affordable to try.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going to first start by saying anyone with sensitive skin or allergies may want to avoid this product. My sister used it once and it ate into her skin. This obviously isn&#x27;t for everyone and should be tested first as it states on the back of the product. I got this pack of 3 because it&#x27;s way cheaper than buying just one. 3 for the price of one bottle? Can&#x27;t beat that. It has lasted me quite a while and doesn&#x27;t damage my skin. I also do not have to suffer from the cuts I frequently get when shaving. I have used this on my legs, underarms, and near the bikini area. If you&#x27;re going to use it near your bikini line, I advise caution. You don&#x27;t want to get this stuff too close to your delicate parts. It&#x27;s very easy to apply, but kind of smelly. I leave it on for about 7-10 minutes to ensure that all the hair is taken off. It is easy to wash off when I get into the shower and makes my skin very smooth.</li>
    <li> After getting so incredibly tired of shaving my legs, I set out to try something new.  I read about product after product that burned skin, didn&#x27;t work, etc, and finally chose the Aloe and Lanolin lotion.  It wasn&#x27;t well tested, but what was there wasn&#x27;t negative.    I did a small test run on a patch on my leg, and after 3, 5, and 7 minutes wiped a little of it off to see how it fared.  I had good success with the 7 minute run, and most importantly, there was no burning or irritation.  Satisfied, I did my entire legs, and was really pleased to see all that hair just wipe right off, and that I could sit and read a magazine while it was working!  The hair removal also seemed to last a little longer than shaving, too.    Feeling brave, I then attempted to use this on armpits, but after 2 or 3 minutes I knew \\&quot;this is not going to work\\&quot; and I cleaned it off right away.  It was starting to burn a little, and I was not going to go another 5 minutes (and since the hair is different it may have even taken longer).  No damage done, but for me I&#x27;ve decided that legs are fine, other sensitive areas will require other solutions.</li>
    <li> always a good product</li>
    <li> Even some of us older ladies, I&#x27;m 65, love to show off are legs and a great help in displaying gorgeous gams is Nair. I have been using Nair hair removal products as long as I can remember and by far Nair products are the best. Highly recommended. 5 Stars</li>
    <li> The Product Itself Is Just Fine But The False Advertisement Really Makes Me MAD They Tell You It Is A 3 Pack But They Only Give You One. I Really Hate Being Lied To.</li>
    <li> I like this one..I bought the one with the baby oil and did not like it nearly as much. It itches and seems harsher. This one works well and is not irritating if you do these things:&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT leave on ANY longer than 4 minutes. If you are sensitive, start with 3 or even 2 then wipe a small area and see if hair is coming off.&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT use under arms if you have recently applied deodorant. It WILL react with the deoderant. I made this mistake one time and it burned my armpits very badly. I had done it before without issues so I concluded it was the deoderant and it hasn&#x27;t happened since. And again NO longer than 4min.&lt;br /&gt;Also I use gloves to apply; (like the kind you use with hair dye) b/c yes it will smell up your hands and the smell seems to stick around even after showering.&lt;br /&gt;Following these instructions, I notice I get much smoother and closer than with a razor and the job probably lasts 1.5 to 2 times as long.</li>
    <li> I got Nair as a backup for when I run out of my razor refills (which cost $26 per refill and sometimes I just don&#x27;t want to pay it.)I put a thick layer on without rubbing in at all and let it sit for 4 minutes. I have sensitive skin and didn&#x27;t want to try for longer than 5 minutes. I walked around from the bathroom to the living room and did have some small burn feelings and assume that is the chemical working into the hairs. I decided to just sit still while I waited my time and the burning feeling went away. I used a wet warm cloth to wipe the hair off and my legs were smooth! I recommend using the cloth to remove the lotion and rinsing off in a lukewarm shower and patting your legs dry. 1 day later and I have no red bumps, chemical burns or irritations. I took one star off for the burning I felt because I know in a perfect world- Nair would not burn.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this here, but at my drugstore because I needed another alternative to shaving. I use this to shave my underarms, arms and legs. I find that sometimes, it does get the hair off and other times, I have to reapply it to the area(s) where there&#x27;s still hair. It also seems like it lasts a lot longer than if I shave, so I will continue to use it until it runs out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: I started using this product more often since during the spring and summer months your hair grows faster - and it seems like the results don&#x27;t even last a day because by the next day, the hair started to grow back under my arms (which is why I went from three stars to two stars). I know that after I finish this product, I&#x27;ll be looking for something else (or otherwise, I&#x27;d be using the cream every other day which is kind of a waste and an inconvenience for me).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several brands of hair remover and none of them have worked until I tried this one. I have moderately sensitive skin, so I&#x27;m terrified to leave anything on my skin for longer than recommended, but my hair is relatively thick so most other products did practically nothing in the recommended time frame. Surprisingly, this did the trick in about 5 minutes with minimal skin irritation (just some slight itchiness, but the same thing happens with shaving, so I&#x27;m not really concerned about it). Also, it didn&#x27;t dry out my skin, which was an unexpected plus. I&#x27;m super happy with the results. The only downside I can think of is the funky chemical smell.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m recovering from burns. You have to use quite a bit of product to get the desired result and it doesn&#x27;t get rid of it all. I&#x27;ll stick to shaving.</li>
    <li> You&#x27;re thinking &amp;#34;look at all these positive reviews! This is my alternative to daily shaving or painful waxing!&amp;#34; and you&#x27;re wrong. These great reviews are fake (don&#x27;t be surprised, that&#x27;s common practice) this stuff is garbage. Beauty products are notorious for not living up to their claims, but this is the worst offender since anti-aging creams and mascara commercials. Here is what will happen:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 1: Waste a few dollars&lt;br /&gt;Step 2: Waste 10 minutes of your life&lt;br /&gt;Step 3: Have red, burning, hairy skin that&#x27;ll be too tender to shave until at least the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still know what you&#x27;re thinking. &amp;#34;Ok, so it didn&#x27;t work for some people. Unsatisfied customers are the loudest, right? It might still work for me..&amp;#34; save yourself the time, money, pain, and disappointment; shave or wax.</li>
    <li> I would never recommend Nair products.  They are harsh chemicals on your skin.  I put it on to try it out and when I took it off it did an awful job and burned my skin. I actually had burns that took a while to heal.  It&#x27;s not like it was just for one day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend using these chemical lotions.  Stay away from Nair.</li>
    <li> i use this brand of nair. I usually just buy it out of the stores for about 5 dollars. I ordered this one because it said pack of 3 for like 5 dollars. that&#x27;s mean I would get 3 for the price of 1. after receiving this ordrer and opening the box I only had 1 nair and that upset me. its like this seller is false advertising. it is the same product in the picture though. its just in the newer bottle.</li>
    <li> After all these years, Nair&#x27;s scientists finally formulated something that works for me. I have long thought I was from another planet, given that Nair-like products work on one part of me and do nothing someplace else, even in quantity, even after too much time.     Today I tried this formulation for the first time. It removed hair everywhere I wanted, in under 5 minutes per area, without burning, without the stench. I am very happy.     Now I&#x27;m going to go place an order for more on Amazon before they change the formula again. I&#x27;m gonna be stockpiling this puppy!</li>
    <li> worst thing ever !!!&lt;br /&gt;sending it back. left it on for 3min  like it said to do &amp; nothing came off. then again for 5 min and nothing. even worst it that when i received it had leaked.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sick and tired of spending so much time in the shower, shaving my legs every single day. Summer is fast approaching and I want to do something different this year. This is the first product I tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know that some products smell really horrible, and the first thing I noticed was that this stuff hardly had a scent at all. I put a little dab on my ankle to test. I have really sensitive skin, and it seems like ANYTHING will provoke a rash. After ten minutes of the small spot doing nothing, I wiped it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that the hair didn&#x27;t come off with it, though. Despite the ineffective test run, I decided to go ahead and try it anyway. I spread on a rather thick layer, all over my calves. Immediately afterward, I regretted it... I couldn&#x27;t get the stuff off my hands! It left a really weird residue that wouldn&#x27;t come off. I tried the soap I regularly use in the bathroom to wash my hands. Then I tried dish soap. Then I tried my boyfriend&#x27;s pumice scrub he uses to wash oil and dirt off his hands after work. The pumice scrub worked... sort of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, after about 5 minutes, my legs started to burn. I tested a small spot to see if it had worked yet, and the hair was still there. Despite my best judgement, I left it on. The burning continued to get worse, until I finally took it off at 10 minutes. Not a single hair came off with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I had to deal with removing the residue from my legs! I kinda started panicking, because it was burning and I couldn&#x27;t get it off. But I didn&#x27;t want to scrub because the skin was already so irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s now two hours later and my skin still burns like crazy. I have patchy rashes all over, and the hair is still there!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t be using this stuff again. I might try other products, but this one is a definite no-go. I just thought I should provide fair warning for those who have sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> It says pack of three I got 1 need I say more? Provide what you advertise smells like a scam</li>
    <li> I have used Nair for years and found no difference in trying the aloe version. Same product. Same results. 100% happy customer!!!!!</li>
    <li> Nair works great when properly used (leave it on long enough but not too long). This is a great buy (3 bottles). The new formula smells better and seems to work the same or better. A good buy.</li>
    <li> I love Nair! I have been using it for years! I was lucky to get three bottles for $7.99! What a steal! Much cheaper on here. Love it!!! Will continue to buy.</li>
    <li> It works great as long as you follow the directions. I use it on my arms often. The hair does grow back in couple of days. I bought it because of the great price and the reputation of the brand. The reason I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars is because it doesn&#x27;t work as well on my legs (even if the hair are small enough) as it does on my arms. I have to apply it at least twice which wastes a lot of my time and the results aren&#x27;t all that great, plus it irritates my skin if I keep it on for longer than 3-4mins. Also, the chemical it contains seems to be very harmful to the skin if you keep it longer (even a min or two extra can cause damage). It does tend to burn, even bleed (yes!) if you keep it on longer than 3mins. I would not recommend this product to people with sensitive skin. If you buy it, make sure you follow the directions well.</li>
    <li> Excelent product! I never used a depilating crean so efectiv like this one</li>
    <li> I love the ease of this product.  Last so much longer than shaving and I don&#x27;t have to worry about hair bumps.  It has come a long way and the smell has improved and they have added stuff to make the body area feel smooth and not like you just had a chemical on your body.  Highly recommend and this was a deal for the three pack.  Much cheaper than buying in the local store.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a fantastic alternative for leg shaving. You just out this product on just like you old lotion. Wait for 3 mins and Raines. It&#x27;s amazing. The hair washes away completely. This product leaves your legs smooth and soft. Great product!</li>
    <li> Hair comes back the very next day waste of money</li>
