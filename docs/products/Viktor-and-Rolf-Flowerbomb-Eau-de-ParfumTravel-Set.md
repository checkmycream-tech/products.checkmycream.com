      <li>A co-worker said it best when she quipped, &amp;#34;ewww ,that smells like some old woman&#x27;s perfume&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the kind of perfume that smells better through out the day.</li>
      <li>I more than liked it.</li>
      <li>in my opinion it is alluring, bellowing,  exciting, elegant, exquisite with a touch of cotton candy for fun and flirtiness!</li>
      <li>This is a timless fragrance that is appropriate for all ages, and it&#x27;s very easy on the nose.</li>
      <li>;) lol</li>
      <li>so I assume anyone who purchases it will also love</li>
      <li>What more can a guy expect when giving a lady perfume?</li>

      <li>I have Gucci by Gucci, Michael Kors, Donna Karan Cashmere, Viva La Juicy by Juicy Couture, SJP Lovely, Betsey Johnson</li>

      <li>I love this perfume.</li>
      <li>The bottle is not a roll-on as many people seem to think, but</li>

      <li>Loving the aroma of fresh light-scented floral, I picked this.</li>
      <li>and I was almost knocked flat with a very nice kiss that more than suggested she was pleased.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t go through perfume very quickly (and with this scent you don&#x27;t need a lot of it)</li>
      <li>, you get more than your moneys worth, and the shipping cost is okay.</li>
      <li>Thanks for a useful great gift idea.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Saved money buying this. You will not go wrong, mature fragrance and lasts all day long. Gives you time to save for the larger bottle.</li>
    <li> This fragrance is mesmerizingly goegeous...and potent.  A little goes a very long way.  This set will last a long time though it comes in a eensy, teensy, cute little bottle.</li>
    <li> Love the smell. Its, despite the name, not too flowery. It has a subtle, sweet, grown-up smell but its not so heavy or musky as something your grandma would wear. This travel size is perfect to try it out.</li>
    <li> The travel size is perfect for a first timer of Flowerbomb. Love the smell. Hoping to purchase a larget bottle in the near future very soon. Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> Bought this on a whim (based off of other reviews) for my girlfriend for Valentine&#x27;s day. I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, especially since she had never heard of Flowerbomb. But to our surprise, this scent is amazing! It has a wonderful, lingering, intoxicating scent that just lures you in! Everywhere we go, people are asking her, \\&quot;what perfume are you wearing because I love that scent!\\&quot;  So to keep this short, this is a must buy for women! It is priced right and a little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> I am soooooo in love with this perfume but can&#x27;t afford to pay full price, which is why I purchased the travel duo. I had read another customer&#x27;s review that said it wasn&#x27;t a spray, but something (can&#x27;t remember what) made me think it might be. So I called Sephora and asked a sales rep. She said it IS a spray, not a dab-on. My order arrived today and it turns out she&#x27;s wrong. Mildly disappointed, but hey--you just can&#x27;t beat the price either way! Honestly, I probably would have purchased it even if I had known.  :)</li>
    <li> I wanted to give my wife a thoughtful gift for a trip and she was thrilled at getting this as a gift!</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful perfume, with plenty to last in this set.  What is not to like? It smells fantastic, you get more than your moneys worth, and the shipping cost is okay.The bottle is not a roll-on as many people seem to think, but so what? For this price, who cares. This is a great deal on a wonderful perfume.</li>
    <li> it doesn&#x27;t seem to have the same staying power.  Wears off fast.  Might have to try FB extreme.  Maybe that lingers longer.  However,the size is perfect for my purse and easy reapplication.  The reactions to this scent is amazing.... I cannot post the comments here, but I have gotten a lot of attention since purchasing this scent. :)</li>
    <li> Smells yummy! The product was great for the money. I prefer a spray decanter. So, I transferred some of the perfume to a small purse spray container  I already had.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume. It&#x27;s the kind of perfume that smells better through out the day. Unfortunately it&#x27;s not a spray, but it was worth the price.</li>
    <li> I love it. I wanted to try a small bottle to see if I would like it. I more than liked it. I loved  it. Just a little is all you need ladies. The longer you have it on the better it smells.</li>
    <li> Perfume is a little too sweat for me. Don&#x27;t see reason for refill. Both bottles are small and are not spray or roll-on.</li>
    <li> Just got this today, I LOVE it!! beautfiful scent that lingers on the skin for hours, really the most sexy scent ever. The bottle is small but for how concentrated the perfume is, you can not beat it for the price. I would reccomend this to anyone who is not sure that they want to invest in the big bottle, IT IS WELL WORTH THE PRICE FOR SUCH A AMAZING COLOGNE!!</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume on a whim, but all the other vials were soo expensive! When i found this i was ecstatic and purchased it at once. For as discounted as it is, you are still getting a good amount of perfume for it. I am very impressed and so in love with the smell. They dont come in a spray bottle, but you need so little of this fragrance that a couple dabs on the neck and wrists is more than enough to smell it every time you turn. I would say I would recommend this product, but I dont want my girlfriends to start smelling like me ;) lol</li>
    <li> Picture was very deceiving and there was no ounce description. Very disappointed for the price I paid.</li>
    <li> I consider myself a close and personal friend of Chanel, Chance perfume--I rarely stray away from her, with the exception of a smattering of summertime body splashes (love Love Spell from V. Secret!!).  On a random night at a random club in Baltimore, a young woman, a friend of a friend, passed by me wearing a scent that: brightened my world, filled the world with adorable retriever puppies, storm clouds sprouted colorful rainbows... pretty much, it smelled better than anything I&#x27;ve sniffed before &#x3D;)  I had to have it, make it MY scent, and now I have (and I already purchased the larger 1.7 oz. bottle to show I&#x27;m dedicated to my new scent pal, haha)...</li>
    <li> This perfume is absolutely wonderful!! The price is great and I love putting it on in the morning.  I tested it at the store, but wasn&#x27;t ready to drop $180.  This set was the perfect size and price.  I will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> My wife loves the fragrance, and I like it also, the only negative thing I have to say is just be careful not to spill it on your dresser, It will remove the finish.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this fragrance and would definitely recommend it!  You will not be disappointed.  I received my order quickly and it was exactly as pictured and described.</li>
    <li> Got the product when Amazon said Sephora would ship and deliver. It was actually a little bigger than I thought. It contains a side bottle to refill small travel bottle. Very nice scent. But after a few minutes I knew it was not for me. Scents can change when on someone&#x27;s body and they change when I have them on and can start smelling like mosquito repellant. It was too overwhelming for me, but my younger 20something&#x27;s daughters loved it. Then I had to make a choice of which one to give it to!</li>
    <li> Bought this fragrance because my husband smelled it on a co-worker and loved it but I am typically not a florals kinda girl so I bought the travel size to try it.  Although I don&#x27;t see what the big fuss is about(it smells good but nothing out-of-this-world-crazy-good), everytime I wear it, I get tons of positive comments/responses from men and women alike. More importantly, my husband LOVES it and that&#x27;s what matters.  The fact that this travel duo is neither a spray or roll on is not a problem for me at all.  I&#x27;m able to control the amount I use and make it last.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to take a lot to get that wonderful response from the hubs.  :)</li>
    <li> OMG I love this!!! I&#x27;ve been wearing this since Summer and several people have asked me about it already. I keep the travel size in my purse for touch-up&#x27;s throughout the day. I was going to buy the fill size bottle, but seeing how much of the perfume is still left in the bottle I can afford to wait far into next year, or maybe even into 2013 before needing to replenish the supply. I also bought the Flowerbomb Extreme, but unfortunately didn&#x27;t like it, so I gave it away. The Extreme wasn&#x27;t as flowery, to me it was muskier, but that&#x27;s just my nose.</li>
    <li> item was exactly what my girlfriend wanted. didnt know if it was the right size but the travel package was perfect for her thank!</li>
    <li> I just got this perfume in the mail a few days ago. I don&#x27;t go through perfume very quickly (and with this scent you don&#x27;t need a lot of it) so this set is perfect for me. The bottle is small but there is also the refill tube (and it is a pretty good size) so I am really pleased with the amount of perfume I got for $30. The am completely in love with the scent. It isn&#x27;t really heavy and overpowering like a lot of perfumes. It is light but very fragrant.</li>
    <li> This is a cute little set with a lot of perfume in it.  I have always been curious about this perfume.  In my experience, it seems that men really like it.  The scent lives up to its&#x27; name when you first put it on.  It hits you in the face with an explosion of mellow, dark florals.  As you wear, it fades into a sharp but musky warmth. Always a clashing of bright and mellow, sharp and soft.  It&#x27;s a mysterious and complex scent.</li>
    <li> My daughter was very happy</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m writing this based on the reaction of the recipient to whom I&#x27;d given it. She liked it. She liked it a lot and I was almost knocked flat with a very nice kiss that more than suggested she was pleased. What more can a guy expect when giving a lady perfume? If it works for her, then it&#x27;s good to go for me. I personally think it smell like taking a header into a Dutch flower field but I&#x27;m a man, what do I know?</li>
    <li> The frangrance is wonderful, but the refill function is very wasteful. The perfume does not flo through the funnel, and I ended up wasting the frangrance and my money.</li>
    <li> My wife loved this for a gift.. I highly recommend this..</li>
    <li> It a good product quality, I hope it lasts a long time to use. The beautiful model. Recommended 100%. Thanks</li>
    <li> I did read the size on this but for the life of me it is still very small. I am happy with the purchase but would have preferred the travel piece was an atomizer.</li>
    <li> Best perfume I&#x27;ve bought in a very long time - and it lingers all day.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love Flower Bomb and I have a full set, but I am traveling and needed something to go in my carryon. This is perfect size and it came earlier than expected.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong wth Flowerbomb! It was a well received gift to my daughter.  Pretty spendy stocking stuffer but worth it to see her smile and smell her walk by.</li>
    <li> ITS VERY TINY THAN I EXPECTED BUT IT SMELLS SOO GOOD AND SOO NICE. I WISH I WOULD&#x27;VE GOTTEN A BIGGER BOTTLE BUT I LOVE THE WAY IT SMELLS ON ME.</li>
    <li> My daughter-in-law loved the sample scent I gave her, and this is the perfect size for me to get her hooked on going for the larger bottle.  I think this is perfect for her, and her sons agree! Speedy delivery and careful packaging. I&#x27;m very satisfied with the whole transaction.</li>
    <li> Did not smell like original flowerbomb</li>
    <li> I was sitting near someone recently and mustered up the courage to ask what fragrance she was wearing...she took out the roller perfume of Flowerbomb from her purse......truly a wonderful scent...will be my signature scent from now on.</li>
    <li> What can one say.....FLOWERBOMB....anyway you shape it, small, medium or large size...it is a beautiful fragrance. I own this in all the sizes and have the travel for work and vacation.</li>
    <li> I got this kit for my girlfriend who travels for work several times a month. She says it is perfect because she can bring the perfume she loves onto the plane without all the Security hastles. Flowerbomb is just that - the BOMB! Fantastic Scent!!!</li>
    <li> Great size for someone trying a new fragrance.</li>
    <li> Love the scent and a very handy travel size and nice the funnel is included to refill the travel size bottle.</li>
    <li> I initially bought my Flowerbomb at a duty free shop in Canada and was searching for a replacement bottle in theStates.  When I found it on  Amazon my prayers were answered!  The travel size bottle is perfectly sized to fit in my handbag, and the funnel makes it easy to refill !  I love the fragrance, love the travel size and I love Amazon!</li>
    <li> I ordered this based off of reviews. Not what I had expected,it just smells like old lady perfume..powdery and musky. Giving it to my gramma for Valentine&#x27;s Day. So not a complete waste.</li>
    <li> Smaller than expected</li>
    <li> I Love, Love, Love, FLOWERBOMB!!!  This kit is unbelieveably priced for the large amount of fragrance you get!! I wanted this perfume for 3 yrs. and finally committed to the 3.4 oz. bottle. Then shortly after saw this great deal...and couldn&#x27;t resist. I was hoping that the tall tube was a roll on but it isn&#x27;t, it&#x27;s a pour top. I&#x27;m going to put it into a pretty little atomizer for my handbag.  I hope it is priced as affordably for Christmas to give as gifts. The fragrant is quite complex... in my opinion it is alluring, bellowing,  exciting, elegant, exquisite with a touch of cotton candy for fun and flirtiness! The drydown is slightly powdery but SOPHISTICATED! I have Gucci by Gucci, Michael Kors, Donna Karan Cashmere, Viva La Juicy by Juicy Couture, SJP Lovely, Betsey Johnson, Clinique Happy just to name a few but... &#x27;FLOWERBOMB&#x27; IS THE....BOMB!!!</li>
    <li> My daughter purchased this fragrance as a gift for me Xmas 2012, I loved it then and I just adore it now.</li>
    <li> Came as described and pictured. Packaging was nice as well. It is a gift, so I can not yet attest to the quality of the fragrance sent.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and this scent is the best.</li>
    <li> it smells good and lasts long which is good to me which means it is not fake.  it was a good price and i can not complain either since my mom can take it traveling and not worry about it becoming confiscated.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume and the travel kit is awesome. A little messy but awesome. I just wish the small bottle would have a sprayer. I am not really into dabbing it on. I travel a lot for work and this is perfect for my little travel case.</li>
    <li> I order this product because my wife ask for it. I had already bought her a bottle from the store, but I was looking for something so she could take with her when she go on trips out of town. This product was just what I was looking for as a Christmas present for her. She open the gift and was very happy with the product. The product arrive a head of schedule which was a plus. She like the product so much that she is using the seller website to find more items that she wants to buy. I recommend this product to the ones who is looking to buy or get someone a travel gift.</li>
    <li> I ordered this as a Christmas present for my best friend as she requested lol. She absolutely loves it! The delivery was perfect and I received it just in time for the holidays. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> It is fake!!! That&#x27;s all I want to say!</li>
    <li> Flower bomb has a very elegant  and sweet smell. Wherever you go, people will ask what perfume you&#x27;re wearing (: it is very expensive in large bottle, but this size is perfect for the purse and very low price. Recommend it!</li>
    <li> I bought this based on the name. Loving the aroma of fresh light-scented floral, I picked this. Extremely disappointed in the fragrance. Very heavy, not floral (to me) at all. Overwhelmingly and almost a &#x27;soured&#x27; aroma. Not on me, but when simply sprayed into the environment (but also on my skin). I will never order this again. A co-worker said it best when she quipped, &amp;#34;ewww ,that smells like some old woman&#x27;s perfume&amp;#34;. One star only because I was forced to pick one. I&#x27;d rather give it none.</li>
    <li> I had this perfume in the small spray bottle years ago and used it all. I remembered how good it smelled and decided to go for this size to avoid spending $100 or more. I gave this perfume set 5 stars because i feel like i got a great deal on one of my favorite perfumes. This is a timless fragrance that is appropriate for all ages, and it&#x27;s very easy on the nose. I think after i use all the small bottle, i will just refill it with water for decoration on my perfume tray. I like the &amp;#34;refill&amp;#34; bottle better because it seems less fragile and definitely has a better cap.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this fragrance!  I get compliments from both males and females walking by saying that I smell so great,  Pefect size to keep in your purse or in your car while traveling.</li>
    <li> Good price and my daughter loved the travel size and easy refill option.  Thanks for a useful great gift idea.</li>
    <li> It really don&#x27;t smell very long</li>
    <li> Love this scent and this is a great price!!!</li>
    <li> Flower Bomb, I expected exactly that however I got more of a musk, sandalwood, patchouli scent. Don&#x27;t take my review badly. Its a romantic scent. Its not refreshing like a flower, Its sexy and more like something you would wear in the evening.</li>
    <li> Lovedit!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This perfume combination was a gift for my friend and former business partner. She received it and absolutely loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know her taste so I assume anyone who purchases it will also love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thomas Butler</li>
    <li> It came in a timely manner and was exactly what I expected. The little funnel is great for those who travel and frequently have to refill their travel bottle. Great gift!</li>
    <li> Didnt like how small. And it wasnt a spay or mist bottle ... disappointed by the size too. Give more info on size</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell for as long as the first one I bought in the mall. But same smell</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE BEST SMELLING PERFUME on the market. So much so that I had to yell it via typing. I have been wearing this perfume for several years. I could only find it at Nordstroms and now it&#x27;s everywhere. Buy it if you want attention. People always compliment me on my smell.</li>
    <li> Another gift for a friend who loves this particular fragrance and, needless to say, she was very happy with the gift.</li>
