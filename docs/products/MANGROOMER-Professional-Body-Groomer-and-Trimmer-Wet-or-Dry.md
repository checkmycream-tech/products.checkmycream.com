      <li>Easy to use and does a great job.  </li>
      <li>Popping the guards onto the groomer is somewhat easy, and they can be mounted in either direction, which is very nice.  </li>
      <li>tried using the combs and said that they didn&#x27;t seem to work as well as he would have liked.  </li>
      <li>that&#x27;s nice.  </li>

      <li>Great product overall, superior to others my husband has purchased.</li>

      <li>It did an ok job.  </li>
      <li>I have used many groomer/shavers in my life.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;i have to say that immediately, I love the hexagonal rubberized grip.  </li>
      <li>(It must be safe, but I opted not to press my luck and try doing any in-depth testing in that regard).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I find the Mangroomer does a much better job of evening</li>
      <li>As for the core function, this does a good job of trimming and the motor seems sufficiently powerful.</li>

      <li>The philips is rounded and sloped and while its easy to use, I feel like i have more precision control with the mangroomer grip.  </li>
      <li>three size comb attachments are nice and effective, the lengths achieved are about 2mm to about 7mm in real world tests.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m able to shave my eyebrows with the 5mm and it looks fine, so</li>
      <li>If feels more substantial that the Norelco - which always felt cheaply made.  </li>

      <li>The rubberized grip means that it&#x27;s easy and comfortable for him to hold in the shower or out; he says it&#x27;s one of the most comfortable grips he has found.</li>
      <li>The 100 % waterproofing it for use in the shower or out, and for easy cleaning just by rinsing with water maintenance-free.  </li>
      <li>It glides on and removes unwanted hair in one easy stroke.  </li>

      <li>This trimmer / shaver fits comfortably in your hand and glides along easily.  </li>

      <li>but otherwise shaves without issue.&lt;br /&gt;The foil head with fine tooth shaver at either side</li>

      <li>/&gt;While the Philips Norelco feels quite sturdy, and good in my hand, I&#x27;m still not quite sure I&#x27;m holding the MANGROOMER correctly, especially given the geometry of the handle.</li>

      <li>My fiance&#x27;s favorite thing about this is that it&#x27;s waterproof; he can use it right in the shower.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Since the norelco and this one are pretty much the same price point, I would recommend going with the one that feels better in your hand and that will always give you the best shave.  </li>

      <li>The MANGROOMER Professional Body Groomer is pretty spectacular!</li>
      <li>However, the powerful head makes it easy to get a clean shave on the chest and arms and face even without a razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I&#x27;ve used other Mangroomer products before, so I&#x27;ve come to trust the name. This one stands alone, as the best so far. I&#x27;ve been &amp;#34;grooming&amp;#34; myself for years &amp; had come to accept the fact that no product existed that could deliver the way the Mangroomer could. As soon as I got the product, I removed it from the packaging(it already comes charged) &amp; began a trial groom. It was easy, efficient, and smooth. It packs a lil power unlike most clippers &amp; maneuvers through the body&#x27;s contours like a roadster on a winding road. I&#x27;m going to keep this puppy charged up &amp; I look forward to using it.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re a porn star or aspire to be groomed like one, this is the product for you. The Mangroomer grooms all those hard to reach places, without nicking your most important body parts.</li>
    <li> This is a nice regular trimmer.  I have the full body Mangroomer and love it and thought this would be nice for trimming facial hair.  The main benefit I have found from the other Mangroomer is the telescoping arm where I can get by back, this does not offer that so that makes this only good for the front.  It does a good job on the front and the three heads offer a few nice size choices.  Since this leaves very little hair with the largest clipper I do not use it on certain parts where more hair is needed.  However, the powerful head makes it easy to get a clean shave on the chest and arms and face even without a razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also really like the charging station as when not charging I can simply fold it and it goes flat in the drawer in the bathroom.  I am really happy with this and highly recommend it.  It does a great job and provides a close shave (their trimmer heads are really nice and powerful and do a close shave).  With this and the mangroomer that I have for my back this is a great combination of keeping the hair in check!</li>
    <li> Review of: MANGROOMER Professional Body Groomer and Trimmer Wet or Dry (by Marut Enterprises, LLC).  I have used many groomer/shavers in my life.  This one does the job!  The Mangroomer is a solid battery operated one-piece trimmer that comes with three grooming attachments, cleaning brush, and charging stand.  The grooming head does not detach but does slightly swivel from front to back allowing the groomer to adjust to face or body contours.  The battery will last for approximately two hours of continuous use after a full charge.  The foil blades will buzz through dry hair although clogging presented a slight problem when wet.  A facial shave can be had but getting it smooth proved to be a task as the shape of the grooming head, being created for multi-use, does not allow for full contact around neck and Adam&#x27;s Apple areas.  In that regard it is bulky and slightly unwieldy.  Other than that the Mangroomer is a very functional and versatile tool for men&#x27;s care.  The major advantage is the ability to use it in the shower where rinsing can alleviate clogging of the head while in use.  Good grooming tool.  Five stars.</li>
    <li> I have owned several man groomers in the past, this one is the best so far.  I like the fact that it has a powerful motor that easily cuts the hair smoothly with  no pulling.  It cuts super close without the attachments without chaffing.  I like the charge light so that you know when it is fully charged.  This company makes high quality products for men&#x27;s grooming as I also have the back groomer which works equally as well. I highly recommend this groomer for the man that keeps himself up.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my husband to use when he shaves his head based on the claim it can be used head to toe, but it is not intended for this purpose. However, it&#x27;s a very good product featuring a pivoting head which fits easily in the hand, can be used wet or dry, and is basically maintenance-free other than rinsing with water. It comes with 3 trimming attachment combs and charger. It&#x27;s very cost feasible and so far has worked well.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty powerful little groomer. I don&#x27;t have a lot of need for this type of device, but there are just a few places where I&#x27;ve found it to be very useful. There are some places on my arms where the hair pattern is not the same from left to right. I&#x27;m sure no one besides me has ever noticed, but it has always annoyed me. I find the Mangroomer does a much better job of evening those spots up than a razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And how can you not love a product named &amp;#34;Mangroomer&amp;#34;?</li>
    <li> This works well on shorter body hair but not so well on anything longer than a quarter inch (6mm) or so. I like the build quality and one charge lasts forever.&lt;br /&gt;It is described on the packaging as a wet/dry body groomer but the instructions say that it will not trim wet hair very well, then in another part of the instructions, it actually says not to use it on wet hair.&lt;br /&gt;It does however, say you can rinse it clean under running water...I did try this while it was switched off and  after drying it it fired back up nicely.&lt;br /&gt;My biggest beef is that it does not sit well it the charger, in fact it is downright wobbly! It has a &amp;#34;flap&amp;#34; that can be  moved arond presumably to keep the groomer steady while charging but it it still quite wobbly.&lt;br /&gt;The gromming attachments are not very effective, do not stay on well on my unit and it seems to quickly get clogged up.. so if you are very hairy as I am, you may want to look for something else!&lt;br /&gt;Still I do like it and it will suffice for my needs.&lt;br /&gt;Oh and it says it is for body hair only, (i.e. not for head or mustache hair)  but I find it works best as a sideburn / mustache trimmer just don&#x27;t tell anyone lol!</li>
    <li> Yes, you can shave everything.  &amp;#34;Everything&amp;#34; you say?  Yes, &amp;#34;everything&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used a few different groomers over the years, and to-date, the best one is still the ingenious, dual-sided, Norelco BG 2040/34 Bodygroom 7100.  For the price it&#x27;s at, compared to this one, it&#x27;s the better deal.  There are plenty of review for the Norelco so I won&#x27;t really address it here, but I&#x27;ll address a few issues with this one that are a bit better on the Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The foil on the ManGroomer runs on the small side.  Compared to the Norelco, it&#x27;s about 15-20% smaller.  Yeah, it&#x27;s not a huge deal, but it&#x27;s always nicer to finish shaving faster.  There might be some argument that the smaller size lets you get in smalls spaces easier, but I don&#x27;t see any difference when it comes to that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The guards that you can use with the foil come in 3 lengths.  3, 5, and 7 mm.  I&#x27;m able to shave my eyebrows with the 5mm and it looks fine, so that&#x27;s nice.  Popping the guards onto the groomer is somewhat easy, and they can be mounted in either direction, which is very nice.  Taking them off is another story, and at first I thought I might break it, but it came off okay with a little effort.  It&#x27;s not the most elegant design, but not the worst either.  The Norelco beats this because it has 5 lengths, and because the Norelco has clippers on one end and a foil at the other, you can keep the guard on all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charging stand on the ManGroomer is quite since because it doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of counter space, and it stands straight up.  This is a better design in my opinion than the Norelco, but it&#x27;s a small win when compared to most everything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The groomer is comfortable to hold, but the on/off slide switch can get a bit slippery when wet.  Not a huge deal really.  Because the groomer is smaller and the grip is smaller, it is easier to maneuver it around the body than the Norelco, and that can be nice when getting those hard-to-reach places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those that care, the ManGroomer is dual-voltage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The actual shaving works as expected.  I shaved my chest and it took quite a long time, too long, to get the bulk of the hair off.  The Norelco would let you use the clippers to get the long hair off, and then follow it by using the foil.  The only thing you can use here is the foil with the side mini-clippers, and they will do it, but it takes time.  If you are always going to keep your hair at a length where it just needs the foil, and it&#x27;ll never get long, or rarely get long, then you might like the ManGroomer.  If you are frequently going to let your hair get long again, then this is not the groomer for you, get the Norelco.to-reach places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those that care, the ManGroomer is dual-voltage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The actual shaving works as expected.

    <li> It works in the shower and dry too.  The trick is that the grooming shields are not built in, nor is there way to store them on the charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, clipper gets backed up with hair pretty quickly if you are doing any serious body grooming, so you need to clear it with you finger nail, or some other pointing utensil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design is not all that well thought through, and the benefit of being water proof does not out weigh the two items I mentioned above, which are design flaws in my book.</li>
    <li> One of the first things I look at with budget trimmers like these is how easily you can clean them out. This one allows sufficient access to get at all those stray long hairs that gunk up the works after a while. It&#x27;s certainly more accessible than the budget Gilette models, which I can only use for about a month before being grossed out by. As for the core function, this does a good job of trimming and the motor seems sufficiently powerful. The guards are a little flimsy but do the trick and it&#x27;s definitely waterproof. At the right price, it&#x27;s a great choice that&#x27;ll probably last you 2-3 years, what more can you ask for at the price?</li>
    <li> Great body groomer. Easy to use and does a great job.  Adjustable and cuts close but not too much irritation. Easy to clean afterwards.</li>
    <li> My husband prefers to dry shave because he finds that it is less mess in the shower drain when he is done and it keeps the drains clear longer. However, with this groomer, he has found it works better wet in the shower and not great dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHAT IS THIS TRIMMER LIKE?&lt;br /&gt;Rechargeable, the trimmer sits on a recharge base (that folds smaller when not in use) which sits up nicely on the table when opened.  The trimmer has red sides on it that have some rubberized feel to them for a good grip, and hard plastic black on front and back.  The on switch is the little silver diamond shape that you see in the picture.  It comes with three combs for different length hair to trim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOW DOES THIS TRIMMER PERFORM?&lt;br /&gt;DRY&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t pull the hair, but it irritated my husband&#x27;s skin, turning it very pink.  He has used other trimmers and razors such as the Peanut without any irritation whatsoever.  When using it dry, the hair does not come out of the cutters easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WET&lt;br /&gt;When used wet, this trimmer performs MUCH better.  The shave is smoother with no skin irritation.  It seems to get a lot closer and cleans out with water much better than when used dry.  It was easy to hold and use without slipping or being clumsy at all.  It seemed to run out of charge pretty quickly, but we are working on that to see if perhaps we were not charging it correctly.  It did seem to get weaker after about 8-10 minutes.  Again, we are testing this out a few more times to see if perhaps we did not charge it correctly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;COMBS&lt;br /&gt;He tried using the combs and said that they didn&#x27;t seem to work as well as he would have liked.  He thought it was a bit difficult to figure out which size is which quickly without really having to look at them (something in a hurry that is frustrating for him as he needs glasses to read the print).  He said that he didn&#x27;t dislike them but he is not really that thrilled either when used on armpit hair, which is what he wanted them for. He feels that you have to use too many passes and it still misses a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHAT HE LIKED&lt;br /&gt;-close shave when used wet&lt;br /&gt;-like the idea that you can use it front or flipped around to the back, cuts both ways&lt;br /&gt;-lightweight&lt;br /&gt;-pretty easy to maneuver&lt;br /&gt;-charging light lets you know when charging and when is fully charged (done charging)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHAT HE DIDN&#x27;T LIKE&lt;br /&gt;-combs (too many passes needed and missed to many hairs)&lt;br /&gt;-should have come with a cleaning brush&lt;br /&gt;-packaging has to be destroyed to get into, leaving no storage container to keep this in&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE BOTTOM LINE&lt;br /&gt;This is supposed to be a trimmer for a variety of body hair on men.  For use on hair that is to be shaved off from the body completely, it works great in the shower- not so great when dry.  When used with the combs, this does not seem to work very well.  It takes a lot of passes and misses a lot of hair.  This shaver is lightweight and easy to maneuver, but seems to be best suited for wet use in the shower when you want to completely remove hair.  For longer hair, not so much.  Because it only seems to work best for shower and complete removal of body hair and not so much with the combs My husband feels this is only about 3 stars as it only performs well for about half of the functions that it is supposed to.m for. He feels that you have to use too many passes and it still misses a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHAT HE LIKED&lt;br /&gt;-close shave when used wet&lt;br /&gt;-like the idea that you can use it front or flipped around to the back, cuts both ways&lt;br /&gt;-lightweight&lt;br /&gt;-pretty easy to maneuver&lt;br /&gt;-charging light lets you know when charging and when is fully charged (done charging)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHAT HE DIDN&#x27;T LIKE&lt;br /&gt;-combs (too many passes needed and missed to many hairs)&lt;br /&gt;-should have come with a cleaning brush&lt;br /&gt;-packaging has to be destroyed to get into, leaving no storage container to keep this in&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE BOTTOM LINE&lt;br /&gt;This is supposed to be a trimmer for a variety of body hair on men.

    <li> This groomer does a pretty decent job. It trims pretty well, although I had to go over a few areas a few more times than I usually would. It&#x27;s pretty easy and comfortable to use. I really like the stand it comes with, which folds up very easily for convenient storage. Overall, this is a pretty good trimmer that could maybe use a little more power.</li>
    <li> This trimmer / shaver fits comfortably in your hand and glides along easily.  It does have a smooth cut and doesn’t pull or jerk the hair follicles out of your skin as some shavers can.  It charges easy on the stand and doesn’t take up much space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the only nit I have is it is touted as being able to be used wet, but I wouldn’t recommend it as the wet hair does tend to clump and sometimes clog up the unit.  Seeing as how it isn’t a good idea, for example, to use an electrical product in a shower or tub, I wouldn’t recommend using it there, but truy to have your hair reasonable dry before using.</li>
    <li> What a waste of $30. I tried using this once and threw it in the trash can. It could barely cut hair with the guard on.</li>
    <li> The MANGROOMER Professional Body Groomer is pretty spectacular! Wet or dry, body hair is shaven cleanly and quickly without being ripped out. The Mangroomer does snag sometimes if you are going a bit too fast or are holding the shaver at a disagreeable angle but otherwise shaves without issue.&lt;br /&gt;The foil head with fine tooth shaver at either side is a weird configuration but I suppose it&#x27;s to do with the fine tooth shaver trimming to a certain length and then the foil head is to take the hair all the way off.&lt;br /&gt;The three size comb attachments are nice and effective, the lengths achieved are about 2mm to about 7mm in real world tests.&lt;br /&gt;The unfolding charger is pretty nifty too. Small and compact, the charger folds to less than palm sixed for east storage and travel.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Pretty much your basic body groomer.  Have only used it once but didn&#x27;t have any issues.  Very good for cost.</li>
    <li> When used as directed, the Professional Mangroomer delivers on its promises. I noticed other reviewers disparaged it but in their remarks it was clear they were not following the simple directions. Don&#x27;t blame a product if you use it not as intended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product and I did not get off to a great start, however. Following the &amp;#34;be sadistic when packaging a product&amp;#34; dictum, the folks at Mangroomer put this in one of those hot-sealed plastic tombs. That&#x27;s bad enough, as these are notoriously difficult and dangerous to open. But that particular tomb would have made a good storage tray. All they had to do was tape it shut at one end. Instead of this tray, we have a device with attachments and no way to store them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my first though was that if the packaging is so terrible can the product be any good? As it turned out, the product was fine (even though getting it out of its plastic was a bad user experience).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I model for fitness photos, I need to remove hair for the photo shoots. I can reach my fingertips to any part of my body, but that flexibility is not enough to allow for easy shaving with a standard cartridge-type razor. I found a trick to making this more efficient, and that is to shave my back when it&#x27;s dry. That also works for the front. But still, not very easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Mangroomer, I was able to do that shaving job efficiently. Because it&#x27;s electric, it gives you audio feedback in the form of the hairs going &amp;#34;zip zip&amp;#34; and from that I can tell if the angle is correct.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contrary to some other reviewers&#x27; assertions, Mangroomer does not pull hair. But that assumes you use it correctly. I was able to get it to pull hair by simply going too fast. I also got the angle wrong when first working with it and felt those teeth that in two rows on the exterior boundary of the shaving area. By simply reducing pressure, I made this problem go away regardless of the angle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick, curly hair. If anyone would have pulling problems with this device, I would. But as noted, no pulling unless used incorrectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I have exceptional flexibility, the 6.5 inch length from handle tip to shaving blades is enough for me. I question whether it will be enough for a person of normal flexibility, should that person desire a cleanly shaven back. Some body shavers come with much longer handles. But for my purposes, it means no longer using a depilatory agent. Those depilatory creams and sprays irritate my skin, and sometimes cause me to break out in a rash. The Mangroomer doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all. The packaging is the only irritating thing about this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the fold-up charger and have to say this product has an overall handsome appearance. For something that costs about thirty bucks, the Mangroomer is punching well above its paygrade. It&#x27;s a great value.</li>
    <li> My fiance&#x27;s favorite thing about this is that it&#x27;s waterproof; he can use it right in the shower. The rubberized grip means that it&#x27;s easy and comfortable for him to hold in the shower or out; he says it&#x27;s one of the most comfortable grips he has found. It doesn&#x27;t pull his hair and the battery lasts a good long while. A winner!</li>
    <li> I replaced my Norelco with the Mangroomer - and have been impressed with the initial performance.  If feels more substantial that the Norelco - which always felt cheaply made.  The quality - at least in the short-term - is great.</li>
    <li> Did not perform as advertised.</li>
    <li> This product is supposed to take care of most body hair on men (with the exception of the face and neck). It comes with a charger and three types of combs. The best thing is that it’s lightweight, waterproof and easy to hold.  The charger also folds, which makes it easy to store and possibly use it for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately the blades tend to clog up quickly, especially if you have thick, coarse chest hair. My husband said he had to go over his chest and stomach several times before the hairs fell off and even pulled a few (ouch!). After he learned to pace the thing (if you go slowly it works more effectively), he said it takes a little getting used to but does the job.</li>
    <li> This shaver does a good job, especially if your hair is shorter to begin with. The cut hair is easily cleaned out of the razor comb by simply pushing the trimmer in the opposite direction you normally go to cut your hair. It also works very well in the shower. I have no problems with it getting wet and trimming body hair sufficiently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is however one significant problem I noticed, and I only felt it was a problem because I&#x27;ve used other body hair trimmers that did not have the same problem. The reality is, this trimmer is like the perfect back scratcher, and probably not in the way you think. It scratches your skin, wherever you are trimming hair, it will be abrasive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scratching effect is awesome if you have an itch, but if you don&#x27;t, well, expect to have slightly reddened skin after you&#x27;re done. I&#x27;ve tried different angles and methods, but no matter what I do, it still scratches me. No permanent marks to speak of, it doesn&#x27;t do any damage, I just thought it was worth pointing out that there might be some discomfort in cutting your hair with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, great device. Smaller than the usuals, efficient enough and has a pretty cool design.</li>
    <li> It charged quickly.  Maybe, it was because if was already partially charged, not sure. I&#x27;ll update that part after a few uses.  Works fine on regular women&#x27;s hair.  I have found a hairy man that I will give it a try on and update in a few days.  It feels sturdy in the hand, not cheap but not overly heavy. Love the different size combs.  Update:  I used this on a hairy back.  It did an ok job.  I had to keep going over spots several times.  This is not the shaver for you if you are looking for a clean shave.  It does a decent job but you do have to keep removing hair from the shaver.  Just don&#x27;t expect that close shave.</li>
    <li> For better or worse, this review of the MANGROOMER Professional Body Groomer and Trimmer will be based upon my experience with the Philips Norelco BG2040 BodyGroom Pro, which I&#x27;ve had for almost a year and a half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be honest, when I first purchased one of these products I thought I was actually getting a facial trimmer, but neglected to keep an eye on the titles and product descriptions as I bounced between the products. But having purchased one there&#x27;s a certain appeal to keeping things tidy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the Philips Norelco feels quite sturdy, and good in my hand, I&#x27;m still not quite sure I&#x27;m holding the MANGROOMER correctly, especially given the geometry of the handle. The MANGROOMER gets points for the compactness of it&#x27;s charger/stand, but again it doesn&#x27;t feel as sturdy as the Norelco, and I kept thinking it was going to fall out of the stand (although it never did).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Philips Norelco product has two heads, with a (removable) sliding bit of plastic to adjust length if you want to keep some length to your hair. The MANGROOMER instead has one head, but includes attachments for three different lengths, which have the length written directly into them. Having a facial trimmer that doesn&#x27;t include this it&#x27;s amazing how much it&#x27;s missed when it isn&#x27;t included, so props for that. However, I don&#x27;t seem to have gotten as well a cut with the MANGROOMER clippers as I did with the Norelco, and the clips actually seemed to do a good job of pushing hair into the actual blades, resulting in me needing to brush it out much more than any clippers I&#x27;ve ever used (head, face, or body). I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m doing anything wrong, but something seems wrong, unless this was done intentionally so it could be emptied intentionally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally we have the close shave. You&#x27;ve got to trust clippers when it comes to this bit, and I trust my Norelco much more than the MANGROOMER. The Norelco features a thicker head, which actually means less work (tilting) on my part. Additionally, because the MANGROOMER has the single head, it attempts to serve two purposes, which results in part of the blade moving in a rather menacing way. (It must be safe, but I opted not to press my luck and try doing any in-depth testing in that regard).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, we come to the wet or dry bit. While these products usually say they work both wet or dry, the manual for the MANGROOMER, and others, usually recommend using it in dry conditions. So I would recommend the &#x27;wet or dry&#x27; bit be ignored if comparison shopping. And speaking of the manual, it&#x27;s a mess to read it due to a questionable folding decision. I know it&#x27;s cheaper, and more and more electronics in general go this route, but I do miss nice booklets for manuals, so I don&#x27;t need to unfold the entire thing to read it in a single language.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m the target demographic for the MANGROOMER Professional Body Groomer and Trimmer. It feels and looks like a budget item (which based upon the price it is) for teens and men in their 20s. Which isn&#x27;t a knock against the product, but rather an observation. For me, I think I&#x27;m going to just stick with my Philips Norelco BG2040 BodyGroom Pro. It&#x27;s not hip, but I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the reasons above I give the MANGROOMER Professional Body Groomer and Trimmer 3 of 5 stars. It&#x27;s not a bad product, but it doesn&#x27;t stand out either. This might serve as a good entry point, but you may want to eventually upgrade.) on my part.

    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different trimmers, by different makers and in different price ranges.  Despite the name, &amp;#34;Mangroomers,&amp;#34; I am really happy with this trimmer.  You can use it both wet and dry.  The different sized attachments are very handy. I found that it works really well, and is easy to use.  I&#x27;ve used it for 2 months with no problems,  but I usually like to update my reviews after using the product longer, so I&#x27;ll be back with an update in a few more months.</li>
    <li> The best hair removal product on the market, hands down.  I have bought and used many different products and NONE of them compare to the MANGROOMER Body Groomer!</li>
    <li> Mangroomer holds up well against Norelco bodygroom products.  I like the overall attractive design and long-lasting battery.  It glides on and removes unwanted hair in one easy stroke.  However, it still &amp;#34;bites&amp;#34; any tender or sensitive area if not done correctly.  Therefore you should take your time, instead of going &amp;#34;lumberjack&amp;#34; on your sensitive areas.  Three adjustable combs are decent and stand-up charger is better than Norelco&#x27;s awkward-looking chargers.  However, where is the carrying case?  In order to protect it from dust when not in use, you will have to get your own protective case, so expect that spend a few extra bucks, if possible.</li>
    <li> Great price and great grooming machine - nice design, shaver is sharp, does not yank your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are into personal grooming, this is a must.  5 stars would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Bought 2 and returned both. Would never charge.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll compare this to the Philips Norelco BG2034/42 3100 Bodygroomer http://amzn.com/B00OX58Y92 .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a bit smaller and thinner compared to the Philips version. The first difference is that the head slightly and i mean slightly pivots on the Mangroomer. I didn&#x27;t find that it made much of a difference in certain areas because it moves when you need it to stay in place especially when trimming your back (if that makes sense). but most will find it a nice feature especially for chest areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One major difference is that the clipper blade ends are sharp (pointy) unlike the philips which have rounded ends (points). I&#x27;ll also mention that the Mangroomer&#x27;s clipper blades are closer together and while that helps you from getting nicks, it also doesn&#x27;t let as much hair in to get cut. Especially if you have thick corse hair. I tried to trim my groin area and it immediately was clogged whereas the philips didn&#x27;t have this issue. And as others have mentioned it pulls a few hairs here and there which i bet is because of the closeness of the blade points.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did find that the foil part gave me a closer shave so i&#x27;d say the mangroomer has a slight edge over the philips on this. Both are wet/dry so you can use them in the shower. They both have 3 length comb clips and a rechargeable stand/cradle. Which on both you must use to recharge them as you cannot plug them in without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Philips comes with an extension arm that really helped get into areas of my back that one could not do by themselves. The Mangroomer does not have this attachment. They do make a different trimmer with one but its nothing like this particular model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They both do the job well though but for me in my tests and opinion, I much preferred the Philips for the reasons mentioned above (especially the clipper part).  Would most be happy with the Mangroomer absolutely! but having both, the Philips is my pick.</li>
    <li> Mangroomer X88-6 Professional Body Groomer and Trimmer Wet or Dry has full pivot head that can smoothly follow the body contours for constant blade-to-skin contact resulting in the close shave wet or dry.  The ergonomic design allows to comfortably and conveniently groom, shave, style, and trim all areas of the body incl. the underarm, shoulders, chest, legs, arms, stomach, and groin.  The soft rubberized handle allows strong grip facilitating max. control, stability, and comfort, while the hypoallergenic stainless steel oversize foil is design specifically for sensitive skin preventing any irritation.  3 included attachment combs are to keep the cutting head at the 3-mm, 5-mm, or 7-mm distance from the skin each allowing the selected trim length for desired styling and trimming.  The 100 % waterproofing it for use in the shower or out, and for easy cleaning just by rinsing with water maintenance-free.  The X88-6 comes equipped with the low profile, collapsible charging stand/display, which folds flat for easy storage and travel.  The indicator light alerts you to charging or full charge.  The X88-6 is affordable, but without the luxury splendor and thus only almost perfect.</li>
    <li> Gave this to my fiance last month and he absolutely loves it.  He says he easily shaves all spots perfectly and literally everywhere….</li>
    <li> Great product overall, superior to others my husband has purchased. He does wish the handle was a little longer though.</li>
    <li> I use this bad boy to keep myself from looking like a beast at the pool.  It does an outstanding job of taking care of body hair (the instructions specifically state to only use this from the neck down), and it cuts very closely.  The attachments allow for a pretty good variety of lengths, so you can trim your chest and stomach (if you&#x27;re a hairy guy - or girl, I&#x27;m not judgy) to whatever look you like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did take me a few minutes to figure out how the charging system worked (just rotate the bar all the way over).  Also, you need to move the razor at a measured pace over your skin - anything faster, and you&#x27;re likely to snag and pull some hair, which can be a bit of a painful surprise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looks really cool, so that&#x27;s an added benefit.  If you&#x27;re looking for a good body groomer, I&#x27;d definitely suggested checking this one out.</li>
    <li> Shaver is a lot easier on the skin than the original Mangroomer and seems to do the job. Not sure how long battery lasts for but ran strong for at least 10 minutes.  Not crazy about the fact that you can&#x27;t plug it in or use rechargeable batteries in it, if it dies out that&#x27;s it until you charge it. Mangroomer makes quality products and they fully back it with great service so don&#x27;t be afraid to purchase from them.  Great company.</li>
    <li> It works as described, but it pulls on longer hair, which is painful. For $25, it&#x27;s worth the money, but if you can afford a $60 product, there are much better out there.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had quite a few male grooming razors and have settled that shaving or trimming isn&#x27;t joyful no matter the product, but being the wet bear in the pool, etc isn&#x27;t the current look today... north of the equator.  Before trying this razor my standard was the philips norelco bodygroom, which has been a great razor and has a home in my shower and charged every other week.  The mangroomer comes similarly outfitted with three guides, a charger and is also waterproof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i have to say that immediately, I love the hexagonal rubberized grip.  The philips is rounded and sloped and while its easy to use, I feel like i have more precision control with the mangroomer grip.  Time will tell if the shower and soap products impact the grippiness, but for the first week in there, its doing well.  The other cool factor of the mangroom is the fold up charger.  I don&#x27;t keep in it the charger daily, so when I&#x27;m not using it, it folds up nicely in a drawer and takes little space -- also good for travelling.  (just remember to pack it so that the razor cant be accidentally switched on.  airport security is never happy to have a buzzing suitcase.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In use, it performs just as well as the norelco in trimming, with a powerful motor that doesn&#x27;t seem to bog down, but I&#x27;m not killing it when I use it frequently.  Like all razors of this type, it will need to be cleaned to continue to mow down your manhair with ease.  I cannot easily use it to reach my entire back without duck tape and a stick, but they do have a specific product for that - its not this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the norelco and this one are pretty much the same price point, I would recommend going with the one that feels better in your hand and that will always give you the best shave.  For me, I&#x27;m sticking with the mangroomer.</li>
    <li> The Pro Body groomer works great if you go slowly and carefully along the contours of your skin.  It is very easy to use and operate.  I cannot speak about the longevity of this product personally, but I do have one of the original Mangroomers and it functions as well as the day I received it four years ago.  I found the plastic guards to be practically worthless, though.</li>
    <li> I got this Mangroomer as a gift for my son who is in his 40s. (I am too old to care much what I look like anymore.)  Steve says that so far he has only used the mangroomer to trim his sideburns and the hair over his ears and by his neck.  He says it works quite well.  He said the packaging it came in was almost impossible to open.  He said he broke two of his fingernails trying to open the thing.  It reminded him of that TV ad where a guy goes to buy razor blades and he gets tazered by the store manager, and the ad guy comes on and says &amp;#34;It&#x27;s almost like they don&#x27;t want you to buy their razor blades...well, I want you to buy mine.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And Steve also said he read the warning label that comes with the groomer, and the warnings go on and on and on.  He said he&#x27;s sure it&#x27;s okay to use in the shower, but he guesses they have to protect themselves legally against some moron who might take it into the bathtub and then plug it in to a wall socket while its wet.  Anyway, he said he didn&#x27;t intend to use the groomer in the shower in the near future anyway, but after reading the warning label he probably never will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But hey, my son says he likes the groomer.  He says it does a perfect job.</li>
    <li> The Mangroomer is a solid trimming device.  The different levels heads are helpful for achieving the depth of trim I want.  The blade is not quite efficient as other trimmers I have owned, but it still gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Groomer stopped working completely exactly 1 day after the 30 day return policy.</li>
    <li> Who likes hair?!?!?!  There is not a better product to remove hair off of your body!!!!  I keep everything nice and tidy with the MANGROOMER!!</li>
