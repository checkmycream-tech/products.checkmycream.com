<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The only thing that my husband will use on his eczema.  He loves it.</li>
    <li> Low fragrance, a little goes a long way, not greasy, and very effective at softening dry skin.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my Aunt and she was pleased with it and that it was a larger size than she finds in the local stores. Thank you</li>
    <li> The best moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used the cetaphil moisturizing cream, though I&#x27;ve used the cetaphil wash and moisture lotion for years.  This product is noticeably thicker than the lotion but it is not oily and it really does soothe acne prone skin without zinging it like other products on the market.  And of course, being cetaphil, it is not scented, which is a big reason why I use cetaphil.</li>
    <li> I get extremely dry, itchy skin since I live in New England and am often outside in harsh weather. I have all kinds of lotion, and for some reason never tried Cetaphil. I bought this and it&#x27;s now the only thing I use--it&#x27;s that good! In addition to dry, my skin is very sensitive and allergy prone as well. I&#x27;ve used Aveeno with some success, since it&#x27;s unscented, as is this. I found the main advantage in this as opposed to Aveeno is it&#x27;s extremely moisturizing. I smooth it on in the morning and find that at the end of the day my skin is still very soft and not at all dry. It&#x27;s the longest-lasting lotion I&#x27;ve ever tried. It&#x27;s not at all too heavy though, or sticky and it absorbs well. It&#x27;s nice because I can use it all the time without getting tired of an overpowering scent. I would highly recommend this to anyone, from people who just want good lotion to those with skin conditions (e.g. psoriasis, eczema).</li>
    <li> My mom is going through chemo therapy and her skin is very dry... this is the recommended lotion by her doctor.</li>
    <li> In early March, I finally bought this moisturizing cream because I was sick and tired of having ashy, dry winter skin! I don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t buy this earlier, but I wish I did! Although it&#x27;s a bit more expensive than other creams, it is worth every penny. I love how thick and creamy this moisturizer is so you don&#x27;t have to use a lot to soothe your skin. It can get a little greasy if you use a lot in one area, so just spread it out evenly and really rub it in. After just two applications (I had to use it twice a day because my skin was cracking so badly), I had already noticed a difference. It was so supple and soft, I couldn&#x27;t believe it! I may or may not have forced my sister and some of my friends to feel my skin... Ahem! It was that soft!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this over other creams and lotions. Before using Cetaphil, I had tried Vaseline and Dove as well as plenty of Victoria&#x27;s Secret and Bath &amp; Body Works products. I mean, if you can afford a $10 bottle of lotion from those stores, you might as well pitch in an extra buck for a moisturizer that not only works immediately, but is 10x more effective! Plus, for those who don&#x27;t wanna walk around smelling like tropical flowers and fruit, it&#x27;s a bonus that this cream has no fragrance AND is non-comedogenic (good for people who break out a lot). I&#x27;m glad I switched; my skin is certainly thanking Cetaphil!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product since it was recommended to me by my dermatologist maybe 10 years ago. This purchase was to restock my mother&#x27;s supply as use of the cream to help prevent skin infections (she is 97, with very thin and dry skin). The cream does its magic well, can last several days after appled (my skin) and does not leave a greasy feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had not ordered from this retailer before and chose the item on Amazon by price and the 20 oz size jar. The item arrived in good shape promptly with standard shipping, 5 days after ordered. My one annoyance is that Amazon&#x27;s third party shipping message said that it would be delivered within three weeks.  I wrote to the retailer who reponded that that message was not correct and arrival would be much sooner, which it was. As Amazon&#x27;s system generated the message, I have no idea how or why there were wildly different projected arrival dates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy from this reseller again, hoping that the shipping message is more accurate.</li>
    <li> Great for dry skin!  Now that it&#x27;s winter I put this on right after every shower.  Cetaphil has a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; feel and isn&#x27;t greasy.  Don&#x27;t use on your face if you are prone to acne.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! My 2year old son has really bad eczema and we have been trying everything we can to control it. Now understand that each person is different but I think very highly of this product. I could see a big difference after 1 week. This stuff keeps his skin moisturized for a lot longer and we have been using Vaseline. We apply it about 6 times a day just about every time we change his diaper.</li>
    <li> my friends stole this from me.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist loves this cream-and so do I!  Very good moisturizer and does not irritate my sensitive rosacea skin!  The price is also reasonable.</li>
    <li> Not greasy but the moisture lasts</li>
    <li> good product, price is good too</li>
    <li> I have been using this lotion for 20+ years (basically my whole life). It is moisturizing, scentless, and can be used for body and face. One jar lasts me a few months and I use it daily. I will never switch to any other lotion and don&#x27;t think I can find a better one.</li>
    <li> This arrived as if it was really old, the texture was different than it normally is and i&#x27;ve been using cetaphil for years.</li>
    <li> I like this product. I have eczema and been looking for something to help with the itch. This cream is non sticky and absorb quickly. I can see improvement on my legs and feet which usually have most problem for me. My feet also peeling in summer but now it seems to be ok and not peeling as much. And the smell is not bad, very light and almost no smell at all.</li>
    <li> As someone who has always suffered with dry skin - I like to think that I&#x27;ve tried every lotion and cream on the market.  My skin, especially in the winter, is always itchy. I was so thrilled to find Cetaphil, a product that is never greasy, but has transformed my dry skin into skin that always feels healthy and moist.  I realize that this cream is intended for targeted dry spots (elbows, etc), but I&#x27;ve found that it works well as a general body and hand cream.  It&#x27;s really a miracle product.</li>
    <li> super light and great for moisturizing, has no smell and does not feel heavy at all. makes my skin soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> I had been using CeraVe lotion for almost two years.  Friends told me that Cetaphil was better so I checked with my dermatologist.  She said she personally liked it better and it really helped her especially during the winter.  The practice where she worked had both of these in stock so I bought my first jar of Cetaphil - 16 oz. for $12.  Thinking that I could buy following jars for less, I checked on Amazon.com but was suprised to learn that it cost more.  Usually that&#x27;s not the case with Amazon.  One other comment - my dermatologist told me to be sure and buy the cream....not the lotion (same thing goes for CeraVe.) She said the lotion has more water in it, most of which evaporates after application...which can dry the skin a bit when compared to the cream.  Makes sense to me.</li>
    <li> This stuff absolutely destroyed my face. I cant imagine they actually mean it to be used for a facial moisturizer, but they dont say NOT to either. Coming off of 2 straight weeks of horrible breakouts after 3, perhaps 4 uses. feels waxy, like it is sealing your skin like an apple in a supermarket.      great on elbows, knees, feet. seems to be good on tattoos as well.      one additional thought: make this stuff in a squeeze tube, not a tub. this isnt a safe form factor for a moisturizer unless you are sterilizing your hands before use.</li>
    <li> Formulated specifically for chronic dry, sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;Clinically proven to bind water to the skin and prevent moisture loss.&lt;br /&gt;Free of lanolins, parabens and fragrances that can irritate sensitive skin. Non-comedogenic.&lt;br /&gt;Provides long-lasting relief to even severe dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;Cosmetically appealing for facial use&lt;br /&gt;BUYER BE WARE.. CETAPHIL HAS ADDED PARABENS (METHYLE AND PROPYLE BOTH) TO THEIR INGREDIENTS BUT FRAUDULENTLY SELLING THIS PRODUCT AS PARABENS FREE.  INFACT , PARABENS HAVE BEEN ADDED RECENTLY .  cOSTCO USED TO SELL IT SIMILAR JAR WITHOUT PARABENS BUT NOT ANYMORE.</li>
    <li> Amazing....Works great</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected</li>
    <li> Recommened by my dermatologist for my dry skin. So far so good</li>
    <li> I Did the math just to compare the price with other websites, to my surprise I realized that it is more pricey than what is listed here.&lt;br /&gt;Simply divide 12.18 by 20 to get per ounce Price..&lt;br /&gt;if 20 ounce is $12.18&lt;br /&gt;1 ounce is 12.18/20 &#x3D;.609 or .61&lt;br /&gt;Here it is listed As .13 per ounce which is not correct.</li>
    <li> I have used this moisturizing cream for well over a decade. My dermatologist recommended it because of my tendency to have eczema which usually flared up during winter. At first I would purchase the product at drug stores and it was rather costly however, it did the job. My skin responded to it and eventually my eczema was no longer my worst enemy.  I find that after bathing when the skin is moist is the best time to use this cream. It absorbs very well and it is non greasy. My skin feels nice and soft. During the winter I  use extra on my areas which have have joints eg. elbows, hands and knees. A little of this cream goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am glad that Amazon sells this product especially in the 20oz size in packages of two. At the drug stores it was always difficult to find the 20oz size and when I did find it I would buy two jars because the supply was limited. Additionally I like the fact that this cream is unscented and does not irritate my sensitive skin. I gave this cream 5 stars because it continues to meet my expectations.</li>
    <li> It works better than any other we tried.</li>
    <li> This is best moisturizing cream for little ones.  We usually get this from Costco when it is on sale.  Price on amazon was great!  I wanted to purchase more but they had only one in stock.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried all the &amp;#34;heavy duty&amp;#34; lotions out there to combat my dry winter skin (Eucerin, Aquaphor, etc.), and this is far and away my favorite.  It is non-greasy and absorbs quickly.  I am noticeably less itchy and flaky after a couple of uses.  Great buy!</li>
    <li> I will never use another cream on my face!  Recommended by my cosmetic surgeon.  Affordable, too, and has no perfume.</li>
    <li> My wife uses this and I order it all the time.  She thinks its great.</li>
    <li> My face usually turns bright red when I put soap or lotion on my skin, but not this time. It is very light weight and not to oily. Plus, it doesn&#x27;t have all those extra chemicals that often upset my skin. You may need to apply the cream twice or three times if you have really dry skin.  This cetaphil cream is great for people who have skin conditions (rosea) or just have sensitive skin. I couldn&#x27;t find anything on the package showing that it contains any vitamins. I wish it did. The product at least is gentle and can be used every day.  (Tip: Look at the weight of the product, some containers are very large) Also Recommend: I like to use this product after I use Dermadoctor mild senstive skin (forget the exact name) cleaner (Dermadoctor brand is medicated for Rosea treatment).</li>
    <li> This lotion is not greasy and scented. Best lotion ever, great for anywhere on the body and weeny rubbin!</li>
    <li> The best moisturizing cream and the only cream that suits my baby&#x27;s skin. Very happy parent. I like it so much that I too use this quite often.</li>
    <li> I destroy my hands from washing them all the time and wearing latex gloves--and this stuff is a miracle worker. Love it for whole-body use too. Makes your skin baby soft--no smells, no irritating chemicals, non-greasy. Helps heal dermatitis, no joke! I just love this product!!</li>
    <li> I used a sample of this cream on my daughter, a 3 year old that had dry, bumpy skin. It was like a miracle! As soon as I put it on, her skin felt like baby skin again! So I had to buy a large tub of it. She has been using it for over 2 weeks and her skin is wonderful!</li>
    <li> I actually use this on my face because I like the thicker consistency. Works great! I had tried using another moisturizer but after a few weeks I looked older and my skin not as tight. I switched back and within a few days had my &#x27;regular&#x27; skin back. Won&#x27;t try switching again!</li>
    <li> I love how thick this cream is, feels really good on my skin and absorbs well. I only need a tiny bit for my face so this 20oz jar should last me a lifetime!</li>
    <li> Bought at Costco. I was apprehensive because most moisturizers break me out. Even Cervae cream.  This is a dream!  I can slather it on and no break outs!!!  I also use tazorac..maybe that helps breakouts. I love this stuff. Always wash hands before getting into tub.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing moisturizer cream. It has no yucky fragrance or chemicals that are irritants, so it works wonders on damaged hurting skin. I just got done using my chainsaw is some limbs, then weed eating. My hands were all scraped up, with a cut thumb. This cream is on my hands and helping as I write this. Absorber quickly and does not leave a greasy or slick feel. Gets into your skin to where it&#x27;s needed.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the BEST and it doesn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg!!  No perfumes or anything that can irritate your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just simple, plain, no-nonsense moisturizer--for use on your face and all over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few years&#x27; ago, my eyes started burning and tearing after a long day of wearing makeup at work.  It got worse, I couldn&#x27;t wait to get home and wash my face.  It took a while, but I finally figured out it wasn&#x27;t just the makeup, it was the moisturizer I was using also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long-story-short, my cousin introduced me to this. I buy the biggest tub they offer (20 oz).  I use it under makeup in the a.m., my arms and elbows; and at night after washing my face (they make a cleanser also, if you&#x27;re interested).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can spend ridiculous amounts of $$ on moisturizers; believe me, I&#x27;ve done it.  No more.  This stuff works the best for me; I won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> I suffer with occasional eczema and let me tell you this product is great!!! My dermatologist recommended it to me and I&#x27;m so happy that I got it. This isn&#x27;t greasy and it&#x27;s very light, don&#x27;t use too much though only a little is needed. I will forewarn you that you should put this on in the, morning, although it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy it leaves a little shine. This will last a long time because it only takes a little. Cetaphil has great products overall, I also use their face wash (which is AMAZING, gentle, soft &amp; clean feeling) as well as their lotion I hate cerave products they are too greasy and way too thick.</li>
    <li> Best lotion I found and the price was really reasonable.</li>
    <li> We love this moisturizing cream, we considering making this our daily all over body uses.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my friend&#x27;s baby, very nice product.....</li>
    <li> If you have dry skin, believe me, this is what you&#x27;ve been looking for. I&#x27;ve purchased tons of moisturizers, trying to find the perfect one for my dry skin. I was very hesitant to buy cetaphil, because it is kind of costly, and what if it doesn&#x27;t work? Finally, I found a smaller container with this same product to try on first and a miracle happened! No more dry skin for me.</li>
    <li> After a nine month long battle with staph, my doctor told me not to use anything on my skin but Cetaphil cream. My skin is very dry as well and Cetaphil has totally changed. I have soft upper arms for the first time in 30 years. As a Masters Swimmer I use it on my feet nightly and cracked dry heels are gone! The price is much better then Rite Aid stores-you get 4 ounces more in a jar.</li>
    <li> Cetaphil is so great for any sensitive skin. I was using Baby Aveeno for my newborn and it was still leaving her skin dry. A friend recommended to buy a big tub of Cetaphil and I love it. I even started using it for my hand that is recovering from a large 2nd degree burn and I swear it is the reason why I have barely any scaring! What a great product. Go ahead and buy a large container. You can use it just like it says: Every age, every stage, every day!.</li>
    <li> Love this. It makes my face, arms and legs feel great.</li>
    <li> Pregnancy causes dry skin, especially during the winter. How about an expanding belly that itches like crazy!? This is the only cream that doesn&#x27;t make me want to scratch all the skin off of my belly. I have tried aveeno and cocoa butter but none worked like this. I have no stretch marks and no scratch marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use this on my face and it works great!</li>
    <li> I have normal skin with very minor \\&quot;acne\\&quot; this mosturizer made my face look so greasy. If you have extreme dry skin then this is totally for you.</li>
    <li> They weren&#x27;t kidding when they said for dry, sensitive skin. I don&#x27;t really have dry skin, but this thing really does moisturize your skin. It was good.</li>
    <li> My daughter&#x27;s Pediatrician  recommenced this product to me when she got eczema, it worked really well, thanks a lot!!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  I bought it online because I couldn&#x27;t find it at the two stores where I regularly shop.  After I bought it, though, I finally found it somewhere else at a cheaper price, so I won&#x27;t buy it here again.  Anyway, I like Cetaphil because it seems to do its job without being very greasy.  It does seem to get into my skin well, whereas if I apply Nivea after my shower, say, it just goes on in blobs and I have a very hard time working it into my skin.  To sum it up, buy the product, but see if you can get it cheaper somewhere else.</li>
    <li> I have dry skin along with excema.  I Love cetaphil moisturing and use it right after I shower.  It penetrates my skin quickly and takes the dryness away for hours.  I also have a spare jar near my bed because it is also a great lube!</li>
    <li> Being my age (58) with very sensitive skin, I have been ALL OVER the world trying this product and that lotion and this vitamin to help with moisturizing my skin. All to no avail and less money in my wallet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter in Cetaphil. Awesome, incredible product that moisturizes my skin beautifully! No oily residue yet my skin is soft! Bravo! I won&#x27;t purchase anything else!</li>
    <li> Cetaphil is freaking awesome!! It is like a magic cream to your skin. Don&#x27;t waste your time buying  any other moisturizer. Get Cetaphil to achieve perfect skin!!! This product is kickass awesome!!!</li>
    <li> I HAD severe dry skin in a sensitive area. Tried 2 other products for 2 months. Frustrated I purchased Cetaphil Moisturizing Cream for Dry, Sensitive Skin, Fragrance Free, Non-comedogenic (20 Oz $15 on amazon) and used it 4 times in two days. Applied once in the morning after showering and once before bed time. Cetaphil cured the dryness in 4 applications and I cannot believe it. (I am not a salesperson for cetaphil or any of these products)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;- cured the 2 month dryness in 4 applications&lt;br /&gt;- stays on the applied area for a long time even if the area sees a lot of friction due to garment and movement&lt;br /&gt;- absolutely fragrance free&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;- While i am not  a fan of the jar packaging, the product works as well or better than promised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: This is for VERY DRY skin</li>
    <li> The best cream/lotion ever!  Never leaves skin greasy, but soaks right in.  Has kept my skin moisturized and supple for years.  I constantly get compliments on my clear and young looking skin.  I even use it as a face moisturizer (as a dermatologist once suggested).  It is not full of chemical and perfumed ingredients and it is fragrance free. I don&#x27;t have to worry about being around doctors&#x27; offices etc where perfumes are refused due to allergies. I have spent so much $$$ on wrinkle creams and face moisturizers in the past when it wasn&#x27;t necessary.  This was all I needed!</li>
    <li> I feel that the jar is an awkward size.  It is harder to get the cream out of the bottom of the jar, and by reaching in I get cream on the side of my hand (not intending to put cream there).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps this is not a concern for others, but the jar is so tall that it doesn&#x27;t fit into the drawer in the nightstand beside my bed.  Since I use the cream at night on my feet, it would be very convenient to be able to reach for it in my nightstand after I get into bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not appreciate the fact that the jar was not sealed with rigid plastic when it was delivered.  So I honestly could not know if the jar had been tampered with.  The jar came in a loose plastic bag, which was taped shut.</li>
    <li> My skin is already very soft, and increadibly strong, so i wasnt usually one for this kind of thing. but i figured why not? my grandma had a big ol&#x27; tub of it at her house and when i stayed the night i&#x27;d use it... and let me tell you it works WONDERS on my skin making it softer feeling and healthier looking in no tome at all... my only complaint: it made my skin a little red for a few secongs upon application and it can occasionally feel heavy. But if in the winter you get dry flakey skin this is the quick fix you&#x27;ll need!</li>
    <li> Good product since I have a very sensitive skin this works very good.  Not oily at all.</li>
    <li> Thank you for this great product!  It&#x27;s so great for my skin.  I used to work for a dermatologist and this is the #1 recommended cream.</li>
    <li> Feels good, doesn&#x27;t cause acne, haven&#x27;t had a complaint yet. Recommended for dudes, feels smooth on the face. Will recommend.</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me for dry skin.  It works very well and keeps my skin moisterized.  No I recommend it to anyone with dry skin.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something that was sensitive enough to use on my newborn&#x27;s skin that still added lots of moisture.  This is thick cream that absorbs so quickly into his skin.  We use it immediately after baths on his entire little body and I am extremely happy with the results.  He had exczema as an newborn and now (8 months later) his skin is smooth, clear, healthy and supple.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> got for my daughter 2-3yrs old. She has mild dry skin so it seems to work fine I guess. Wife hasn&#x27;t mentioned anything abnormal to me about it. So that is a good thing.</li>
    <li> Best there is and recommended to me over the years by every dermatologist I have seen.  It is excellent product, causing no problems with allergies and especially for sensitive skin.  I don&#x27;t buy anything else.</li>
    <li> An allergy to Eucerin, so I&#x27;m very happy that I could find this product on Amazon (it&#x27;s no longer stocked at my local store).  It&#x27;s a huge jar, that will probably last a year or more!</li>
    <li> I have allergies and sjogren&#x27;s syndrome.  My skin has alway been very sensitive.  Products on the the market tend to make my skin feel uncomfortable.  Recently my skin started to get very dry and cracked.  My dermatologist recommended the Cetaphil Lotion &amp; Cleanser.  I also  tried Cetaphil Cream and loved it.  No reaction or discomfort.  (It took a few days to work.)  I use is all over including the bottom of my feet.  Put the cream inside gloves and wear for an few minutes, it will soften hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My sympathy  to nut allergy people. I constantly have the same experience, ingredients are suddenly changed.  (Two of my allergies are aloe and oatmeal which many \\&quot;gentle\\&quot; non-allergic body products have.)  Unrealized the formula&#x27;s changed,  I&#x27;ve gotten reactions and don&#x27;t know why.  It&#x27;s dangerous  as well as costing money  (I have to throw out my supply).  It is of course a  bigger problem with a baby since they can&#x27;t tell you they have a problem, parents have to see the reaction, by then it is gotten worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not buy this product thru Amazon because I&#x27;ve gotten it sightly cheaper locally.  However I am considering just subscribing for the convenience.</li>
    <li> This is absolutely the good stuff. You really don&#x27;t need any other fancy moisturizer for your face. I use this every morning on my face, neck, arms, and legs. It makes my face glow a little bit, even. It doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes and it blends in nicely into my skin. I&#x27;ve never had skin issues (and I can be sort of sensitive to those problems). Aside from this, I only use Coconut Oil and Makeup wipes for my face, so I&#x27;m a minimalist when it comes to this stuff. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> My daughter has had eczema since birth and this is the only cream that works at keeping her flair ups to a minimum. Love this stuff.</li>
    <li> My daughter has eczema and her Dr recommended using this daily. It works good! The other Cetaphil products are good too, I have been using the face wash for years.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sensitive to fragrances and lanolin, so I ordered this product by Cetaphil. It works great: made my skin soft while absorbing quickly, and I am not sensitive to any ingredient. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> Love this Cream, it is so rich and creamy, and it really does a BODY GOOD. I use it, my kids use it and my Grandkids use it.  I would recommend it to all , especially if they have dry skin.</li>
    <li> I buy lots of cetaphil products and I love this lotion.  I will keep using it and I use it all over my face and body.</li>
    <li> My sister and I have suffered with winter dry skin all our lives.  I bought a jar of Cetaphil, tried it and loved it.  Greaseless, odorless and works!  At Thanksgiving dinner at my sister&#x27;s house, I recommended that she buy it and try it.  She said that she has her own brand and will not switch.  Her daughter asked me the name of the moisturizer,  I said Cetaphil.  My niece said:  Oh we use that!  It was recommended to us by my husband&#x27;s sister (a dermatologist).  My sister then took out a pen and paper and asked me to spell it.</li>
    <li> I ordered,but had to return because it was overly priced on here. I got it at another store for a few dollars cheaper. May order from here if they drop a few dollars off. Otherwise,its great product and work wonders on my dry skin and my daughter&#x27;s eczema.</li>
    <li> but i love it from the time i read it cant wait to use it i hear it is a very very good product an i have very bad scaly skin so am excited to use it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is pretty nasty, it&#x27;s &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34; and yet smells like some strange off-putting chemical. It also has the consistency of the kind of paste that kindergartners (and me) eat. It doesn&#x27;t soak into the skin well, it leaves this greasy film that just sort of floats on your body. It&#x27;s expensive and worthless. Other than that, highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Instant results in my babies skin</li>
    <li> Purchased this because I was looking for the most basic moisturize I could find.  I have pretty sensitive skin so it&#x27;s hard to try new face products out without breaking out, turning red, etc.  This moisturize doesn&#x27;t seem to cause any of that.  And, it does an AMAZING job at moisturizing my skin and getting rid of peeling/flaky skin.  I use it primarily because of recurring acne breakouts that I use benzoyl peroxide to manage, which often results in red/peeling skin.  However, a few things to note about it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(1) You do NOT need a large amount, at all, to cover your face.  I literally skim my index finger across the cream to pick up a very thin layer and apply that to one cheek, and repeat for the other cheek, forehead, and chin/nose/lip area.  I made the mistake of using a lot more when I first got it, and it left my face shiny/smelling the rest of the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(2) It is labeled as &amp;#34;fragrance free&amp;#34; but it DOES SMELL!  I believe the &amp;#34;fragrance free&amp;#34; label means that they do not ADD any additional fragrances to the product, but there is some sort of &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; smell to the product itself.  In fact, one of the first few times I used it I applied way more than I needed to without realizing it, and later that morning I was making a deposit at the bank and the teller commented on &amp;#34;how nice I smell&amp;#34; which was slightly embarrassing cause I&#x27;m a guy.  I had NO deodorant/cologne on that morning, all I had used was the moisturizer, and I could actually smell it a bit myself.  It wasn&#x27;t a big deal and it was because I used more than I needed to, but just a heads-up to people thinking they are getting a product with no scent to it, because it DOES smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(3) I&#x27;ve since gone to ONLY using it at night, before bed.  Even using a very minimal amount, there can be some &amp;#34;shinyness&amp;#34; left on my face for at least a few hours afterwards.  I&#x27;d just rather not have a shiny face when I&#x27;m heading out for the day, so I onlyuse it before going to bed now.  It works out well because I wake up in the morning with 0 dryness/peeling on my face, and that generally lasts all day until I apply it again that night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;tl;dr (1) you do NOT need to use a lot to get great results (2) there are no added fragrances, but the product DOES smell (3) i suggest using it only at night before bed, because it may leave your skin a but shiny/oily feeling&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend it and I will be using it for a long time.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for year for dry skin and mild excema.  It is the best.  I have no breakouts as long as I use it.  It is not greasy at all compared to other creams.</li>
    <li> I opened the package and the jar did not have a seal on it. Opened cap and there was not a seal on the rim but the contents looked untouched. Aintree Emporium (THE SELLER) quickly resolved the problem with a detailed description of the problem and how they resolved it.  I am a happy customer and am updating this to 5 stars due to the excellent customer service from AINTREE EMPORIUM.  THANKS AGAIN.</li>
    <li> Great for Ultra Dry Skin. NOT greasy at all.</li>
    <li> Cetaphil Moisturizing Cream is a great product for those with sensitive skin for allergies. It&#x27;s fragrance free with a nice creamy texture. The tub will last a while.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years. I have mild exzema and this lotion allows my skin to stay hydrated. The price has come down over the years and this is the only lotion I use, I think going on at leat 10 years now. I keep this in solid rotation. My son has exzema and so he has used this lotion since he was a youngster as well. Great for kids and adults, no issue, also working out a lot this allows my skin to breath and not feel like I am covered in a heavy product. Great buy.</li>
    <li> Great product! I recently started Isotretinoin (Accutane), and this has helped my skin stay moisturized without feeling slimy.</li>
    <li> We use it for the skin of our daughter (with atopic dermatitis). it has some discomfort at the first touch where the skin is injured but has a remarkable and lasting effect on teh skin vitality and moisture.</li>
    <li> Cetaphil is a very good product for dry skin and i am hapy with it</li>
    <li> There is nothing better to nourish your skin, I use it on my face and it does not clog pores or make my skin look oily.</li>
    <li> Cetaphil cream is the most moisturization you can get for super-sensitive skin like mine. I&#x27;ve tried various other brands (CervaVe, etc) but always come back to this one. Excellent, excellent, excellent!</li>
    <li> brought this from pharmacy, smell is completely disgusting, it smells like a homeless that hasn&#x27;t shower for 30 days, if you rub it on your hands and smell! Also negative on the ultra hydrating lotion, smells like sunscreen, and not very effective for me</li>
    <li> Excellent price for amount received.</li>
    <li> This is a cheap, over-the-counter, moisturizer that provides the same relief as Acid Mantle, AMantle, and Risabal-PH.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommend this skin cream to replace an expensive (and he told me, not suitable for long term use) cortizone cream my GP had prescribed for cracking around the thumb nails in dry can cold weather. He told me he used it himself and gave me a few sample tubes. I was very pleased with it, not just for the hands but as a face cream too for protecting against cold dry wind. When I looked for a larger supply, I noted that there are a number of different versions, and this was the only example of the &amp;#34;Moisturizing Cream for Dry, Sensitive Skin&amp;#34; type of Cetaphil -- just like that of the samples I had been given --  that I could find. It is well worth the money, even though my wife has found out how good it is and the jar is now going down fast.</li>
    <li> Won&#x27;t use anything else. I have Lupus, and it is non-allergenic. It helps me to prevent Lupus flares and is great for keeping anybody&#x27;s skin younger looking. Love this stuff . . .</li>
    <li> I have rosacea and EVERYTHING burns my skin.  My skin is also crazy dry.  I got this and its been a game changer.  I slather it on at night and there&#x27;s no burning at all.  It really does moisturize.  Great product!</li>
    <li> This cream works to moisturize my son&#x27;s dry patches from eczema.  It does not make the eczema go away, but his skin is not as dry in the morning after we moisturize him the previous night.  In our experience, it was not as absorbent as the Cerave cream and kind of sticky.  But it definitely moisturizes!</li>
    <li> it keeps the skin moisturized for along time , oily little bit.&lt;br /&gt;always use at night or after a good shower</li>
    <li> This stuff is unbeatable. Dermatologist recommended it, and only it.  Not even Cetaphil lotion is as beneficial, according to her</li>
    <li> Whatever positive things this moisturizer could do, is taken away by its packaging. The moisturizing vitamin E cant stay stable in jar packaging. We take the lid off, expose it to light, dip our fingers in it an contaminate it, introducing bacteria that kill off all the positive things this cream could do.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t contain other important things like antioxidants that could really help out super dry skin.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff...  recommended by my dermatologist for my dry, sensitive skin..  I have to say, it keeps the itching at a minimum and I use it daily after my shower.  I&#x27;ve tried other brands and keep returning to Cetaphil.</li>
    <li> I have keratosis spots all over my ribcage. I was using another product that was supposed to help with the itching but it wasn&#x27;t. My doctor recommended this for my extremely dry skin and I started practically bathing in it. It does a good job of curbing the keratosis itch. Goes on smooth and absorbs into my skin so it doesn&#x27;t get all over my clothes.</li>
    <li> Saved my skin and cuticles all fall and winter. One of my sons has sensitive skin and for him this has been a lifesaver for his skin - especially when he was taking Accutane to get rid of his acne.</li>
    <li> highly recommended for dry skin!!! Just within few days, I saw a great improvement . My skin no longer dry and itchy. I love this product very much!</li>
    <li> Worth every penny! I promise</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s good, larger than I thought. My skin is sensitive, but I like to use it, and It&#x27;s really comfortable.</li>
    <li> great stuff expensive but it really works my wife has chronic dry itchy skin it used to keep her up for hours at nite.  but the stuff works very quickly 1 use usually stops the itch for days  mr a</li>
    <li> This is the perfect moisturizer to use underneath makeup, at night, on elbows. It’s light, won’t clog pores and is great for my skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer for years, because it is the best damn moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used. I am a massage therapist and use varieties of lotions and oils and gels throughout my work, my work actually leaves the rest of my skin quite dry. I use this after washing my face, or after showers. It has no harmful or stingy chemicals that leave your face feeling strange. It is delicate enough for daily use on sensitive skin. I no longer have dry skin around my nose or upper arms. High recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Hooked after the first purchase. This product is great for dry skin. I use it daily and can&#x27;t do without it now.</li>
    <li> I have used so many moisturizers, but always found my skin getting dry after few hours. I have tried, Aveeno, lubiderm, vaseline, what not. But after I tried cetaphil cream, there is no going back. Summer or winter, I use this for my extremely dry skin, both face and body. Just use a little for the face, very little. Even the body does not need a lot, a little goes a long way. My skin stays soft and moist all day. I use this on my kids too, and it works like magic. My kids developed a rough dry patch of skin, on the thighs and on the shoulder, after using cetaphil cream for 2 days, the skin was back to normal. Be sure to buy the cream and not the lotion. The lotion is not as effective as the cream. I will always buy this. If you have a costco membership, you get the 20z bottle, for quite less there. I hope they dont discontinue or change the formula, am sure I would never find any other moisturizer as good.</li>
    <li> I have very dry, scaly patches of skin on my feet, legs and hands.  I&#x27;ve tried soaking and exfoliating and many creams and lotions including Eucerin and Neutrogena which work quite well for dry skin.  (I can&#x27;t use scented at all)  Unfortunately those creams and lotions did nothing on the really dry patches.  I&#x27;ve found most lotions are useless for tough jobs.  I finally went to a scleroderma site and they recommended Cetaphil and a very few others.  I chose Cetaphil in part because I could order &#x27;subscribe and save&#x27;.  I&#x27;m very happy with the results (which I saw within days)  and would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> This saves my acne prone super sensitive skin. It&#x27;s greasy looking, but doesn&#x27;t clog my pores. I use it at night and wake up to softer healthy skin.</li>
    <li> I gave to my friend and she loves this product</li>
    <li> The very, very best Moisturizing cream. Love it. Fast delivery and a good size for the prize. Will order again.</li>
    <li> Incomparable cream lotion.!</li>
    <li> I enjoy using this project on my legs after I shave, or even on my face if I am chapped or windburned.  The tub is quite large and lasts a very long time.</li>
    <li> My daughter has extreme allergies and very sensitive skin. This is her GO TO skin moisturizer in order to not have reactions.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for dry skin</li>
    <li> My 9 month old has moderate eczema and I have had a hard time finding a moisturizer that kept his skin soft and hydrated.  This is thick and creamy and does the trick.  Also it works better than their lotion that is specifically made for eczema and other eczema specific lotions/creams.</li>
    <li> I bought this product based on a recommendation by my pediatrician, as well as recommendations from friends, for my daughter&#x27;s dry skin/eczema.  This product did not help her and caused her much discomfort.  We later learned she is allergic to almonds and this product contains Almond Oil, to which she reacted negatively.  I gave it 3 stars because I know for some people, it works great, but the fact that it contains a highly known allergen makes it risky in my opinion.  We switched to California Baby, and it worked much better for us.</li>
    <li> I struggled with acne for YEARS. From ages 13-20 I tried every single cleanser and toner and face mask you can possibly imagine. Somethings could get rid of the acne a little bit but not make it go away. I had acne pretty bad but not enough for the doctors to want to give me accutane. It was horrible and incredibly embarrassing. Over all those years I had tried different options of everything except the moisturizer I used. Finally I decided to try aquaphor. It is a little different since it is an ointment- feels more like a gel, but if you put on a thin layer it works fine. When I switched moisturizers my acne WENT AWAY! I couldn&#x27;t believe it. All those years it wasn&#x27;t that I was using the wrong cleanser. It was that I was using the wrong moisturizer. For whatever reason, cetaphil gave me acne. Looking back I am frustrated that I didn&#x27;t figure it out until I was 20, but I am glad that I now know. I&#x27;m not sure why this product worked for so many others but not for me. Maybe I just have rare skin, but if what I have described sounds familiar to you, try getting rid of cetaphil. Now I am 21 and when I stop using aquaphor, my acne comes back. I don&#x27;t know why, but that&#x27;s how it is.</li>
    <li> Great cream for extra dry skin.</li>
    <li> wonderful Item to skin</li>
    <li> My daughter has eczema and her skin is extremely sensitive and dries quickly. I was recommended to use the body wash by the doctor when she was 2 and decided to buy the cream a month ago at age 7 now. I waited this long because she was prescribed a different lotion by the doctor that we stayed with. I was thinking she is gonna break out if I put this on her so I did a spot test before applying all over and no reaction( smiles). This product is amazing the itching has nearly come to an end due to dry skin and her skin Looks good (I&#x27;m a happy mom). This product go on smooth as opposed to her prescription lotion which is a major plus. I truly recommend this if you have dry skin or eczema.</li>
    <li> Nice and thick, and without too many crazy ingredients. Love it!</li>
    <li> Feels good when I put it on, but half an hour later my skin is dry again.</li>
    <li> Great for dry, sensitive skin. I use it on face and body.</li>
    <li> top brand for moisturizing dry skin.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hydrate my skin and made it smoth, but it was sticky at the beginning</li>
    <li> I would tell every one I can .it is great I love it. pass it on to others&lt;br /&gt;Get it now amazon is the place.they are great.</li>
    <li> I have to use this cream for psorisis per my dermatologist orders and pricing at local stores is much higher than I paid for this and it&#x27;s even a bigger jar, so it will last longer.  It&#x27;s unscented and has a cooling feel when I put it on it&#x27;s instant relief.  I would recommend buying online to save money.</li>
    <li> No adverse reactions. Free of harsh chemicals and light enough for the face, yet thick enough for everywhere else, this is a versatile lotion that has become a staple product in my skin care and tanning routines. No complaints here.</li>
    <li> This moisturizing cream has had such a tremendously positive impact on my quality of life. I suffer from dry and sensitive skin, particularly on my arms and legs, as well as some unknown allergies to clothing materials. Cetaphil has reduced so much of the anxiety I used to have about the health of my skin. It feels wonderful going on, is unscented, and causes no irritation. My skin stays moisturized until I bathe and I swear the layer of cream is protective against environmental irritants. I have used it at least six days a week for about three months now and my legs rarely itch and look enormously better than they ever have. I am so grateful to Cetaphil. I will be a lifelong devotee and advocate.</li>
    <li> This cream was recommended by my dermatologist for dry hands. It&#x27;s kept my hands from drying out this winter. Just beware this is a BIG jar.</li>
    <li> Very, very, very, good. Complete satisfaction.</li>
    <li> Our baby daughter started suffering from either dermatitis or eczema a year ago - just a red bumpy rash - and unscented Dove and Cetaphil cream were recommended by the pediatrician, pediatric dermatologist, and an allergist. Unfortunately, they didn&#x27;t know that Dove had changed the product formula and that Cetaphil contained sweet almond oil. We really wish they had - it would have saved her a year of terrible itching and rashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As background, our daughter was diagnosed with a milk allergy after we switched her to Alimentum and within a day or two her skin cleared up significantly. With consistent use of Dove in warm daily baths, hydrocortisone 1% cream on spots and Cetaphil cream, she soon had mild eczema. However, even though her skin was clearer, some red bumps and frantic itching continued, to the point that she was scratching areas so feverishly she was digging into the skin and bleeding. Nothing helped - not even antihistamines. Dairy had been eliminated so there had to be a secondary cause.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quite by accident, I used her Dove soap two weeks ago. And I too started itching like crazy, even though I had used it without problems years ago. And it turns out I wasn&#x27;t alone - even unscented Dove&#x27;s own website addresses this issue. After some research, it turns out that in 2007 Unilever quietly changed its formulation, combining unscented Dove (recommended for years by allergists and dermatologists) and Dove for sensitive skin, into one product, unscented Dove for Sensitive skin. They changed the surfactant base and the ingredients for the whole line. In other words, the product that doctors have been recommending for years for eczema is no longer the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another interesting thing is that Dove uses tallow - an animal byproduct that is often derived from cattle. This may cause a reaction in people with milk allergies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taking this one step further, a recent study suggests that children with milk allergies may have a higherrisk of peanut sensitivity (my daughter does). Whether this can translate into a true peanut allergy is not known yet, it will take several years of research with children to find this out. One step further - some people with peanut allergies are also allergic to tree nuts. The milk -peanut - tree nut sensitivities (and sometimes allergies) can coexist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What does all this mean? That the very mix of products recommended by three doctors - Dove and Cetaphil - may have been a trigger for her second bout with eczema. This is the multi-step process that finally worked to clear it up:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#1 - Eczema is often triggered by a milk allergy. Avoid all dairy, cheese and yogurt. Also, avoid milk byproducts such as whey (in white bread for example) or foods that might contain milk proteins such as chocolate. We saw huge improvement with Similac Expert Care Alimentum Hypoallergenic Nutrition Formula, Powder, With Iron, 1-Pound (454 g) (Pack of 6) and insurance may cover it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#2 - If you&#x27;re using Dove soap for eczema and itching continues, try another product. We are having success with Johnson&#x27;s Baby Natural Head-to-toe baby wash for both hair and body; other moms like California baby. Our daughter&#x27;s frantic itching stopped completely overnight after we stopped using Dove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#3 - If you&#x27;re using Cetaphil cream as a moisturizer, take note of the ingredients, especially if there&#x27;s a chance of allergies to tree nuts. It contains sweet almond oil and we found that this was causing small red non-itchy bumps in both our twins. We are now using Aveeno Baby Eczema Therapy Moisturizing Cream and it&#x27;s lightweight and not greasy. Aquaphor Baby Healing Ointment is also a good barrier moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#4 - Change detergents. Even Dreft has fragrance. Several mom friends have found that All Free and Clear makes their babies itchy. I didn&#x27;t notice a change in my daughter&#x27;s itching but have switched to Tide Free &amp; Gentle. I did notice a change in my own hands, for the better (they used to get red and cracked doing laundry).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#5 - always have a layer of 100% cotton next to the skin, especially with fleece clothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#6 - change crib sheets and vacuum once a week as dust could be a trigger (it wasn&#x27;t for us).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#7 - Hydrocortizone 1% (OTC) on spots plus a thin layer of moisturizer right after a warm daily bath still remains the best treatment. On tougher spots, apply twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the above suggestions our daughters&#x27; skin has cleared up almost completely. We are truly astonished as the ingredients in the very products recommended by her three doctors - Dove and Cetaphil cream - by all appearances were causing her rash and itching during the last year. She&#x27;s like a new baby, her skin is glowing and she&#x27;s finally smiling and peaceful.</li>
    <li> A dermatologist suggested this for my dad&#x27;s very, very dry skin. It kept his arms moisturized longer and better than anything else. I use it myself I was so impressed.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great all purpose body cream...that I use from face to feet.  Perfect for my needs</li>
    <li> Love this not greasy, good size jar....Don&#x27;t need to use a lot of the cream less wasteful......</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have been using it for a month now and have no complain. My skin is sensitive and acne prone. I have tried so many different products and almost every single one breaks me out. This Cetaphil is very gentle, no fragrance, thick and doesn&#x27;t clog my pore, a tiny bit goes a long way. Because I never apply makeup (makeup products break me out too), so I use Cetaphil every morning and night. For those of you who apply make up, this product maybe a little bit oily. You should use it only at night. It moisturizes my skin wonderfully, and help reduce my fine lines considerably. because it is so gentle, I use it around my eyes and necks. Love it!</li>
    <li> The product was already opened by someone although I bought a new product.&lt;br /&gt;I was even more shocked when I found there was a finger mark on the surface of the cream.&lt;br /&gt;Since I am really busy, I won&#x27;t return it but you might be unlucky one like me and always be careful since they might intentionally choose and send defect item to try you to remove their spoiled items.</li>
    <li> Aaaaaah, relief for my dry skin - and it doesn&#x27;t stink, either! I had been using Coconut Oil previously, which worked really well for summer, if a bit greasy, and then got two jars in a row of rancid, very smelly product, so I switched to this product. It is not greasy, does not smell, and absorbs really nicely into  my skin. Sometimes organic is NOT best. I&#x27;m very happy with this moisturizer - plus it can be used anywhere on your body, including your face. And a great price, too. I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Product came open and already used... It was horrible and i am not able to use it. Buy it from your local drug store.</li>
    <li> Both my wife and I have been using this for a while now and feel it works well on our dry  skin.</li>
    <li> If you are plagued with dry skin - this is a product for you. I have a life time problem with dry skin. A dermatologist once counted six distinctly different type of eczema on my body. She recommended this product, and I have been using it for over a decade since. It simply works, and it doesn&#x27;t take much. Try it and you&#x27;ll be very glad you did.</li>
    <li> little bit too oily for face, and to oily enough for other places, but its still a good one.</li>
    <li> I have always thought of myself as a pretty girl with perfect skin, but then I got severely dry skin on my face when I hit 25, on top of that I also got an acne issue with it as well. It made it very difficult to look at myself in the mirror and to love myself. No doctors, or beauticians could tell me what the heck was going on with my skin or what to do about it. I have tried all kinds of moisturizers and they&#x27;d just end up making my acne issues worse and not healing my severely dry flaky skin, it was so bad to me that I was starting to convince myself that I had leprosy - I felt THAT hideous and I couldn&#x27;t even wear make up to hide it! Then I logged on to Amazon and was determined to find a moisturizer that might help me, I read through hundreds of reviews and I thought I would put my good faith into this one because it sounded like some of the other people who have tried this product had similar issues. I mean what could I lose? I was a little iffy on some of the comments saying that it is a bit oily, but I tried it anyways. When I got it in I tried it on my face, yeah it is a bit oily but that just lasts for like 10-20 minutes until your skin soaks it all up, but a week after using this my dry skin got better and it didn&#x27;t even give me an acne break out. 2 years of mental pain and suffering is now finally over thanks to this godsend of a product. I can now look in the mirror again and feel beautiful. I just wish I found this stuff sooner! Thank you Amazon for the reviews and this wonderful product! :) PS: It is even helping reduce stretchmarks after having my first baby!</li>
    <li> Cetaphil was recommended by my dermatologist. I&#x27;m sure this is a very good product for most people with dry skin. It contains almonds, however, and I could not use it. I have since discovered Clinique Deep Comfort Body Butter. It is also available in a large jar and is reasonably price.</li>
    <li> I really started to use this when I moved from the beach to the mountains.  It was so dry up there that I couldn&#x27;t stand it.  I started using this after I showered and I noticed a huge improvement in my skin.  I use it all over my body wherever it feels dry.  I get dry skin and this stuff is not greasy but just really moisturizes well.</li>
    <li> I like this product very much, and buy it often as needed.  I would recommend it to anyone who needs a good product of this sort</li>
    <li> One tube lasted me 2 years and I use this everyday! This moisturizer is one of the best not only because of its excellent ingredients, but because it leaves your skin feeling soft and refreshed. I recommend this to everyone!</li>
    <li> ***update 3/27/15: BEWARE! This product contains parabens. This is the best moisturizer that I have ever used on my face but it has parabens :-( After reading around online, it looks like they have only recently changed their formula and added parabens. Why oh why would you do this to your glorious moisturizing cream, Cetaphil?? I guess my search continues...  Original review: I use this as a facial moisturizer and it is AMAZING!!! I have very sensitive skin and it gets very dry, especially in the winter. After my regular facial moisturizer changed their formula and started causing me to have breakouts, I went through a nightmare trying to find something to replace it. Everything I tried either made me breakout or just didn&#x27;t really moisturize. Then I found this glorious Cetaphil Moisturizing Cream and  was utterly amazed!! It seems kind of thick when you scoop some out of the tub, but when you apply it to your face it is so creamy and smooth and feels amazing going on. You dont need to use much. A very small amount really moisturizes my entire face. I bought a huge 16oz tub of it at Wal-Mart for $10 or $11 and I think it&#x27;s going to last me forever! Best of all, I&#x27;ve been using it for several months now, and no breakouts!!! I LOVE LOVE LOVE this stuff and will never moisturize my face with anything else, ever again!</li>
    <li> I love the feel of this cream. It makes my skin feel very soft</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years, no smell and no breakouts.</li>
    <li> i have been this  cetaphil for over ten years i can recommend it to any very goog for  dry skin</li>
    <li> A few years ago I developed chronic dry skin. I&#x27;ve bought some very expensive moisturizers, hoping they would help with the flaky dryness that kept me from wearing any foundation or powder because it would just showcase the flaky skin and wouldn&#x27;t go on smoothly. Everything I tried (I won&#x27;t name names but the prices ranged from the 6 dollar bottle that didn&#x27;t do anything to the 50 dollar tiny jar that made me break out) left me disappointed. Until two days ago when I purchased the Cetaphil face wash for sensitive skin and the moisturizing cream for dry, sensitive skin. In only two days, my skin looks almost 10 years younger, I can put makeup on again, it looks and feels so soft and I just can&#x27;t believe how great these products work and how quickly! I can&#x27;t imagine ever using anything else again.</li>
    <li> cetaphil cream is alot more moisturizing for very dry skin than the cetaphil lotion. Big difference in hydration. Love this stuff for very dry mature skin. Especially in the winter months when the wind zaps the moisture from your skin!</li>
    <li> Doctor recommended for a family member.  Helped the condition immediately.&lt;br /&gt;No need for any prescriptions.  And good for those in the household who simply&lt;br /&gt;want a lotion/cream to use for hands/feet and no skin issues.</li>
    <li> Best moisturizer you can buy for a reasonable cost.</li>
    <li> Very effective.  It is light but very, very emollient, soothing and long-lasting moisturizing.</li>
    <li> Have used this for years...suggested by my dermatologist..keeps my very dry skin from peeling..will continue to order as needed.</li>
    <li> This lotion is amazing! My whole family uses this. We tried many other lotions and none of them worked. Then we found this. Purchasing over and over again</li>
    <li> Hypoallergenic and not greasy</li>
    <li> advised by my dermatologist  good product</li>
    <li> I have psoriasis and not many things help. This moisturizer is probably the best I have used. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s not a cure, but it sure does help. It has lasting power which is what I wanted.</li>
    <li> excellent product and sender.</li>
    <li> I bought two lotions at the price of $34 but someone told it was worth it. Went to costcos with my mom the same week, found same lotions for $7.99.</li>
    <li> very soothing, I love this product for  healing of my dry skin. I use it in the morning and at night.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B00113HNB4 Cetaphil Moisturizing Cream for Dry, Sensitive Skin, Fragrance Free, Non-comedogenic (20 Oz)]]Recommended by dermatolgist to my wife for her dry skin - to put on after a shower while still somewhat wet. Worked great for her - and now I use it and recommend to my patients. Barry Solomon,R.Ph  M.Ed</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a several months - I use for almost all of my skin needs, face, legs, etc.  I have sensitive skin.  I stopped buying most other skin products, and that has saved me money and clutter.  Well done</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dermatologist and I would also recommend</li>
    <li> A sample come with my cleanser (which I also wrote a negative review for) and while it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin, it didn&#x27;t do much for it.  I would use this if I had no other moisturizer but I definitely would not buy this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have doubts whether the ingredients are actually that sensitive as I am looking at it closely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think the ingredients are simple either.  I honestly don&#x27;t know what people mean by that.  It definitely doesn&#x27;t have as many as other but that&#x27;s not an automatic positive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I question this product.  It didn&#x27;t seem to do anything and I don&#x27;t feel like it has ingredients to do anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe people don&#x27;t find it irritating and that&#x27;s a plus, but I would rather find another non-irritating product that has better ingredients that would actually benefit my skin if I could.</li>
    <li> I tried to get it all in the title :-)  This is the same product I love when I buy it at my local store.  This is a serious cream, slightly looser than petroleum jelly.  It&#x27;s very similar to Eucerin in weight, but I find it less greasy.  It has a major difference from another popular thick cream Cerave which has ingredients to slough off dry skin.  This cream only forms a smoothing and soothing barrier on the top layers of my skin which holds in my skin&#x27;s own moisture.  I often put it on right after a shower or bath while my skin is still slightly wet.  Also works great when I&#x27;m already dry.  I can put it on every inch of my skin, including face and eyelids, and other very sensitive areas, even including little shaving nicks, sunburns, etc.  A little goes a long way.  If I don&#x27;t use too much, I can achieve the sense of the product completely \\&quot;soaking in\\&quot; or \\&quot;drying\\&quot;.  If I use too much, I remain feeling slippery.  When that happens, I lightly run a towel over my skin, and then I don&#x27;t feel icky.  Sometimes I put this on my feet and slip on socks before going to bed.  Doesn&#x27;t slough off thick scaly skin, but softens.  Glad to find this product for a less expensive price than at my local expensive drugstore.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizing cream. I am currently on Accutane and it has been making my skin dry out like crazy. This stuff definitely offers some relief. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I love its simple and functional cream that meet my needs at descent price. I don&#x27; t need frequent rehydrate my skin and just need to have it once a day. My skin can remain moisture the whole day. This is my personal experience. Others may have different type of skin, so try it before purchase a huge amount.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Non-greasy, unlike other creams&lt;br /&gt;Good for eczema&lt;br /&gt;Is truly fragrance free-has virtually no smell at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Though it is advertised for sensitive skin, my skin tingled in an unpleasant way for about a minute after application.</li>
    <li> I have tried many creams for dry sensitive skin but this one is one o the best that I have found.</li>
    <li> Love this cream.  It hydrates SOOO well.  I use it everywhere:  face, arms, legs, torso.  I just wish it has SPF, but I squirt some into my hand before applying.  A little too greasy for my palms, though.  Oh well, you can&#x27;t have it all.</li>
    <li> For years I had used Moisturel for my dry skin and was shocked to learn it is no longer produced. After a frantic search, I&#x27;ve found Cetaphil to be the best substitute. While not quite as good as Moisturel, it is available, does a good job in helping to seal in moisture in our dry climate, and is fragrance free, a real plus. It is also a reasonable cost. The delivery was very fast.</li>
    <li> A local pharmacist recommended this cream when I was searching for a moisturizer for a elderly patient with dry and fragile skin.  There&#x27;re several moisturizers that we&#x27;ve tried with mixed results, Eucerin being one of the better ones.  Most provided what appeared to be good moisturizing characteristics when first applied, but the moisturizing effects didn&#x27;t seem to last very long.  Some had fragrances that were either overwhelming or soon became annoying and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the risk of those fragrances introducing an irritant to the skin.  We found that the Cetaphil lasted the longest, and being fragrance-free was ideal.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not for me, it&#x27;s for my brother... but he has used it many times and nice results in his body, in skin specifically.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, I saved time buy ordering online rather then going through my Dr.  While ordering online cost me and it would have been free with my Dr. i must use this&lt;br /&gt;Great for dry patches, body, face, feet, great for a lot of different skin disorders. I love to use it on my face right out of the shower. i can&#x27;t apply any makeup until it drys, but at 4 months shy of 30 I have great skin and no wrinkles. my skin is soft and supple and my completion is better. I have mild rosacea, eczema, psoriasis. So the trifecta of skin issues. But you would never know. As long as I keep up with my cetaphil, then I am good to go.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 74 and had developed a severe itchy unknown cause of dermatitis. After spending hundreds of dollars in dermatologist fees and rx salves, creams, and otc creams, I stumbled upon this product. Wish I had tried it several months ago. Very impressive. A very different feel with great results.</li>
    <li> Such a great moisturizing cream for sensitive skin esp when most other moisturizers I&#x27;m allergic too.</li>
    <li> This is a great product,  the moisturizer is not grease and works very well with my senitive skin.  Great product.</li>
    <li> My wife uses it. She had a reference from a friend and is very satisfied with it. Recommended it to friends.</li>
    <li> you can&#x27;t get a better body cream the &amp;#34;Cetaphil-Donahue&amp;#34;..that&#x27;s what i call it.  It&#x27;s the perfect lotion for dry skin...goes on smooth, last long, looks great and does exactly what its&#x27; suppose to do.  I&#x27;ve been buying the cream for 20 years now...it rivals those expensive creams and at a fraction of the price...it&#x27;s that good!</li>
    <li> This product is great, I have extremely sensitive skin and this has been wonderful as a daily all over moisturizer. I even use this product on my face, and it has not caused any breakouts even though it is cream. It has a great texture and spreads easier than Eucerin brand (Which is great if you need really heavy duty cream.) One thing I love about the tub is that you don&#x27;t have any waste because you can get your hand all the way to the bottom, versus the pump, there is always lotion left that the straw won&#x27;t reach and then you have to fuss with it to get it out, or waste it. Amazon also offers this product at a great price.</li>
    <li> Very good for your skin I really recommend this item</li>
    <li> I ordered the Moisturizing Cream but instead received the Gentle Skin Cleanser. I&#x27;ll keep it anyway, but will order the Moisturizing Cream from a different vendor next time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Cetaphil for years. Love this product.</li>
    <li> My 3 year old daughter&#x27;s skin is much smoother since using this and the red bumps on her legs have almost completely disappeared.  Her arms are being more stubborn and they persist there, but are much smoother overall.  We will continue to use it daily in hopes of even better results.  She has had no bad reactions either.</li>
    <li> used this product for years.  It works good for using  after your shower&#x27;  Just sorry I don&#x27;t get free shipping  any more</li>
    <li> Cetaphil is my go-to cream during the winter when my skin is so dry. I love that it makes my skin feel smooth and moisturized and that it is unscented. Fabulous for extremely dry skin.</li>
    <li> Excellent moisturizer...worth every penny</li>
    <li> Really awesome stuff! Ingredients are simple and I&#x27;ve added a few drops of essential oils for fragrance. After a shower/bath and a little bit of this stuff, rub all over you and you&#x27;ll have super smooth skin. Awesome for the price you pay.</li>
    <li> Good produce &amp; good price. My children use it when they were born until now.</li>
    <li> i have no complaint with service nor product</li>
    <li> Softens skin beautifully! Absorbs quickly! Love It! :)</li>
    <li> Offered very little moisturizing, even though it&#x27;s so heavy that it takes a long time to absorb fully.</li>
    <li> The lotion does what it says good for dry shine want leave but face greasy at all I would recommend it</li>
    <li> This was recommended by my dermatologist, I purchased a smaller jar at the drug store but I now have a larger jar at the same price (no shipping costs for &amp;#34;Prime&amp;#34; members).... it works great, not greasy and makes a difference immediately.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  my skin condition requires daily covering from head to toe.  This does the job.  However the suppler on Amazon is overpriced.  Shop around.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer does what it says it would do. My face now has a very softened skin tone .Very pleased with the results. Removes levels of dryness and does moisturize.</li>
    <li> This is the best creme. I get really dry skin (dry itchy patches) in the winter. And this definitely prevents it. It&#x27;s more costly than other brands, but well worth the money. And a little goes a long way. It&#x27;s great for sensitive skin and there is no fragrance what-so-ever. And it goes on so smoothly and absorbs really well. I use this daily in the winter and once a week (other regular lotions the rest of the time) in the summer.</li>
    <li> Is a very nice product, is really useful four my daughter, she has a sensitive skin and she can not use creams with perfume or fragrances.  Very nice product.</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion. We&#x27;ve been using it for 3 years on our 4 year old daughter and since there is no alcohol in it, it doesn&#x27;t dry her skin.</li>
    <li> I live for this stuff. Yes, it&#x27;s incredibly thick, but unlike lotion, it truly creates a barrier between your skin and the elements. I live in the Chicago area and we had a brutal winter - this Cetaphil cream kept me from emerging in the spring as a scaly lizard. It also lasts forever  - you don&#x27;t need to use much. I get a new one every 4-5 months. Great for sensitive skin and NOT greasy - just don&#x27;t use too much. Really wonderful. Would have to stockpile this a la Elaine with the sponges if it was ever discontinued.</li>
    <li> I love this cream!!! I&#x27;ve tried all the expensive stuff, and this is the only thing that hydrates me more than anything else (especially when it gets colder), and makes my skin feel like butter. Plus, it doesn&#x27;t make me break out at all.</li>
    <li> It has been excellent on my rash and dry skin!! I have tried many products for my skin condition but none can compare with Cetaphil.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;m using this product and I love this moisturizer it makes my skin feel soft and keeps it moist.</li>
    <li> PARABENS have been added to this product.  Is going in the trash today and am looking for a replacement.    Update:  I contacted Galderma regarding the \\&quot;adding\\&quot; of parabens to their product.  This is their response:    \\&quot;Although, the label of Cetaphil® Moisturizing Cream has changed, the ingredients and manufacturing processes have not. The changes made to the Cetaphil® Moisturizing Cream label were made to reflect current information from Galderma&#x27;s ingredient vendors and the International Nomenclature of Cosmetic Ingredients (INCI). Cetaphil Moisturizing Cream has always had the parabens in it.     Five Cetaphil® products contain parabens:    * Cetaphil® Therapeutic Hand Cream   * Cetaphil® Moisturizing Cream   * Cetaphil® Gentle Skin Cleanser\\&quot;  * Cetaphil® Daily Facial Cleanser  * Cetaphil® Daily Facial Moisturizer SPF 50\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Cetaphil Moisturizing Cream for Dry, Sensitive Skin, Fragrance Free, Non-comedogenic was recommended to me by my dermatologist.  It&#x27;s a reasonably priced product.  And he suggested it for the treatment of my hands, which were super-dry, scaly, red, cracking and peeling, and all that good stuff, after several weeks&#x27; use of a perfumed soap.  Mind you, I know/knew better, but the soap was given me by someone of whom I&#x27;m fond, and I just wanted to use it.  Bad decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At any rate, the doctor recommended I use the moisturizer morning and evening, and after every hand washing that I could, and I have.  I also use it after the morning shower, to buff up feet, knees, elbows, various bits and pieces.  The makers state that is a creamy, non-greasy formula, free of lanolins, parabens and fragrances that can irritate sensitive skin; also that it has been formulated to be non-comedogenic.  They further state that it has been clinically proven to bind water to the skin and prevent moisture loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see a lot of steroids in the product&#x27;s ingredients and that does trouble me.  But I do notice that the formulation is non-greasy enough to be acceptable for workaday use, and that my hands are in a better condition than they were.  And I swear, I don&#x27;t care who gives me perfumed soap in the future: I&#x27;m not going to use it.  Or only to scent the sock drawer.</li>
    <li> This Cetaphil Moisturizing Cream has turned my aging dry skin into healthy softness, without anything greasy or perfumed.&lt;br /&gt;I simply can&#x27;t believe the low cost!&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t tell anyone, but I&#x27;d be willing to spend more for it.. but will gladly purchase more at this price!&lt;br /&gt;My skin looks great again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommend!</li>
    <li> Fast Shipping-product is great! Will purchase again!</li>
    <li> My top pick for unscented lotion. I have very dry skin and I hate scented lotions. I love this stuff.</li>
    <li> Best product I have found for my dry skin. I notice my skin actually feels softer- even my face- which I also use it on.</li>
    <li> I am impressed with this cream, it is thick but goes on well and soaks into the skin nicely, i would recommend</li>
    <li> The best so far. I tried so many products. I like this most. It makes my skin soft and it is indeed not GREASY. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is an ok moisturizing cream, but nothing differnt then a bottle of regular lotion of any brand. Its no big deal</li>
    <li> Nice large size product is fragrant free and great for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because it says its free of parabens.  Not true.  It is clearly labeled twice on the jar that was shipped to me.</li>
    <li> This is good for dry skin,after a shower.  Doctor told me to get this.</li>
    <li> Best hand moisturizer on the market</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very please with this product.  It was shipped fast and it moisturize my dry skin and doesn&#x27;t break me out being that I have sensitive skin. It also leave my skin feel soft.</li>
    <li> IT HAS PARABENS---ingredients list on this page are wrong. This is listed on the label&lt;br /&gt;methylparaben, propylparaben&lt;br /&gt;I wish this seller would update and not let people think it was paraben free. I bought this for my newborn and was very upset when I read the label and saw the PARABENS listed.</li>
    <li> Hands down one of the best moisturizers I have ever used. I actually stumbled upon it by accident when I ran out of my generic store-brand moisturizer. I used to think all moisturizers were pretty much the same (Oil of Olay, Ponds, Lubriderm, etc) so I just bought whatever was on sale. They all say they are &amp;#34;hydrating&amp;#34; and provide &amp;#34;x hours of dry skin relief&amp;#34; but few live up to those claims. This one actually does. I used to have this really itchy, dry patch of skin on my neck that would never go away no matter how much other lotion I used. After using Cetaphil, it went away in about 2-3 days and has never come back. A little also goes a long way. A finger-tip size is enough to provide a full day of hydration for me without having to re-apply it. Use sparingly on your face because it can feel greasy if you apply too much. I usually switch off with Cerave Lotion in the summer when the Cetaphil Cream feels too heavy. The 20 oz tub usually lasts me over half a year so it&#x27;s a really good deal. If you are a Costco member, I&#x27;ve seen the 20 oz tub for sale for around $6-$7. It&#x27;s usually between $10-$20 when it is not on sale.</li>
    <li> My baby has sensitive skin and it really helps soothe and moisturize her skin. It&#x27;s really value for money so I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Have enjoyed using it for years because it is unscented and keeps my skin comfortable from head to toe.</li>
    <li> I purchased this recently, not here but at WMart, a little less expensive than here.  But what amazes me is that for years, I am 66, I have spent lots and lots of money on expensive facial moisturizers.  And was going through a period of trying out new ones since I was having a continuing problem with flaking on one side of my face and around my eye.  I tired Anew, for eyes, and liked it, but it didn&#x27;t correct the flaking.  I tired Oil of Olay, I have tried  some stuff I bought on a cruise that cost me about $110. a jar.  And then I decided I needed a moisturizer for my legs, and when I saw this was good for your face also, I tried it on my problem area, well no one was more shocked than me that the next day the flaking was gone.  WT heck, this is for sensitive skin and non-comedogenic, and cost $11, a jar.  Never again will I bother with anything else.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s non greasy and it goes on very smoothly. Great for all skin types. I will continue buying it!</li>
    <li> Cetaphil has been great for us.  it just works to keep our little one&#x27;s skin normal.  We use it every night to keep him from getting dry skin.</li>
    <li> We bought this on the advice of our pediatrician to try to clear up baby&#x27;s dry skin dermatitis (pre-eczema).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very effective, doesn&#x27;t irritate her skin (aveeno did, surprisingly), and is far less greasy than the aquaphor. Plus mom and dad just rub it into our hands when we&#x27;re done instead of feeling like we have to immediately go wash it off.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this cream for all dry skin issues</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got very dry skin and Cetaphil is the only lotion out there that works for me. Awesome product and great pricing here on Amazon!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Cetaphil for years, and this price is much lower than at any retail store. I&#x27;m very pleased and will re-order as necessary.</li>
    <li> non-greasy...manly lotion...lol....It is the best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used...I am bald and in the sun a lot...use this product because it is non greasy and my dermatologist gave me samples...</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and as expected.</li>
    <li> I am 62 and though I am still slightly oily in my t-zone, this moisturizer gets the job done where I am drier...around my nose and cheek area.. Gives the skin a &amp;#34;dewy&amp;#34; healthy look. The only thing that bothers me is some readers have found there are parabens in it...which I am not too thrilled about.</li>
    <li> Use this on my 2 year old son.  Works great on his sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I definitely do NOT recommend this for acne or rosacea.  It is too strong.</li>
    <li> Cetaphil is the best for any age we all use it in my house</li>
    <li> This stuff is heaven.</li>
    <li> I have tried all kinds of moisturizers over the years and spent s ton of money doing so...This is the best at a very aforadable price</li>
    <li> My friend gave me a 20 oz jar of this highly rated Cetaphil Moisturing Cream, fragrance free, etc........  Well, the first thing I noticed was that it felt so greasy that I would NEVER put it on my face, even my lips.  I have used it generously while slathering it on my feet and hands sitting on the edge of the bed before going to bed for the night.  I did not buy this from Amazon but my friend bought it, and several more for friends, at Costco for about $8 because they get coupons for $4 off.  I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t purchase it through Amazon because I would hate myself for wasting the money.  Another negative, in my book, it that the jar is so large that you have to dig down into it and the cream gets under the nails, which I don&#x27;t like.  Of course, I had to tell my friend that I loved it (with fingers crossed) but I will never buy it.  Instead, I will purchase Gold Bond in tubes, and the O&#x27;Keefe&#x27;s was a very pleasant surprise with the nice, easy to use container, and the fragrance free cream.  Surprisingly, Suave and Equate in the squirt jars turn out to be favorites because I use hand lotion so frequently during the day.  I think I will try the Gold Bond in the squirt jar next.</li>
    <li> I have tried many, many kinds of facial creams ranging from Very Expensive to around the $20 range.  I bought this, thinking, what the heck, I have nothing to lose, and I can always use it on my body if I don&#x27;t like it for my face.  I&#x27;m AMAZED at how smooth it goes on, how it moisturizes so well and does not leave a greasy feeling. ( I have normal/oily skin with dry patches around my chin/mouth)  I&#x27;m in awe of this product and can&#x27;t believe how much money I have wasted when I look at all the other &#x27;now useless&#x27; jars of cream that I will no longer use.  Imagine the money I would have saved over the past 30 yearsâ€¦ As far as the paraben concern, I didn&#x27;t read the ingredients yet, but I will still use it regardless, because the cream works that well!! I&#x27;m a vegetarian, I don&#x27;t smoke, or partake in heavy drinkingâ€¦.I think I&#x27;ll take my chances if it does have parabens.(which it might notâ€¦I&#x27;ll have to research it)  Still, my final decision is that I LOVE THIS CREAM.</li>
    <li> My Dermatologist has been telling me to use cream after cream for my chronic dermatitis / itching. She never recommended Cetaphil; but my fathers Doctors did for him. Well, I bought this and I am so happy I did! For once in about 2 years, my hands etc do not itch / bother me 90% of the time! Damn GOOD product; I would, without a doubt, recommend it!</li>
    <li> great product terrible price</li>
    <li> my favorite Cream as I step out of the shower and apply right away. Naver sticky you can put your clothes on with no problem.</li>
