<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> does its job but if you apply to much, it can make your hair shiny and hard</li>
    <li> I have tried many different hair sprays in the past. Claims made by various companies include &amp;#34;Strong Hold&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Super Hold&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Extreme Hold&amp;#34;. In the end, many of these other hair sprays did not hold as much as they advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This spray is very high hold and even very thick hair can be managed. The thicker your hair, the more you&#x27;ll need to spray. Do not spray too closely to your head or you&#x27;ll risk applying too much product. Because this spray is so high holding, you&#x27;ll want to spray a little bit at first then increase as you need. Too much &#x3D; clumpy and sticky hair (this applies for most if not all hairsprays).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell of this product is decent (slightly fruity smell) but goes away in a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Love this hairspray!!  Never need to run a comb or brush thru my hair once I spray it.  Super hold!</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  I have been satisfied with all of the Bea Head products I have tried. Thanks</li>
    <li> With my job I need total control hairspray and this is the Best!! I would buy this item again for sure.</li>
    <li> This is a very good hair spray and I think it is used in many salons.</li>
    <li> I bought it (male) for a dry hold. It works good and smells fine, but mainly no problems with the shiny gel look that most have. At the rate that I use it, I think that it will last until I lose all of my hair.</li>
    <li> Love it! It holds my hair but I can brush through it too so it isn&#x27;t HARD on your hair.</li>
    <li> i live on the water so i was looking for a hair spray to keep my hair in place and this really works.  the only problem i found is it makes my hair really stiff.  so i have to wash it out every night i use it.  will buy again</li>
    <li> the cap was broken and it&#x27;s a pain to return/or refund.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work well with my hair- thick, dark.</li>
    <li> I really have thick hair and it&#x27;s very difficult to style but when I tried Bed Head I had no problems styling my hair anymore. I&#x27;m definitely gonna be a long time customer!</li>
    <li> I am now a BedHead Hairspray addict.  I can&#x27;t believe how GREAT it is!  In fact, I didn&#x27;t believe it when my daughter told me that she pays extra for hairspray because I thought that all hairsprays were created equal.  I would buy the cheap stuff that said \\&quot;extra hold\\&quot; on it and told her she was wasting her money. BOY WAS I WRONG!  She handed it to me and said \\&quot;give it a try\\&quot;.  I&#x27;ll tell you it was like NIGHT and DAY to the \\&quot;extra hold stuff\\&quot; I used to buy.  It&#x27;s not sticky, doesn&#x27;t have a heavy residue, it just does exactly what hairspray SHOULD DO and does it perfectly.  It&#x27;s tough to explain but I will say, if you want long lasting hairspray that works without sticky residue, this is it.  They have it mastered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every time we travel we always have to find the nearest store to buy it (due to airport regulations on traveling with aerosols) because no ordinary hairspray will do anymore!  My daughter laughs now because she was absolutely right!  Who would have thought that there IS a difference!  Love it! If you are even a slightly bit skeptical at least give it a try to see for yourself.  It&#x27;s a fantastic product which I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</li>
    <li> Love the product and the price!  Arrived quickly</li>
    <li> I ordered this hairspray thinking I was getting a great deal. The product is awesome.  But the one I got here was empty, or maybe had 1/10 of what should have been in the can.  When I wanted to return it they informed me they don&#x27;t take back hazardous or flammable material:)</li>
    <li> My favorite- hair stays in place and doesn&#x27;t get weighty. I wish there was a travel size, but its worth checking a bag to have it with me.</li>
    <li> A little sticky but holds really well.</li>
    <li> Great solid hair spray when you don&#x27;t want anything to move.</li>
    <li> After reading some reviews on the product I decided to give it a try. I found it at a local store, cheaper in the long run when you consider the shipping and handling that is added. First of all I am a woman with what some consider an unusual cut, I have a spiky, messy, type of cut and use bed head hard head gel for it. I have tried all kinds of hair spray over the years to help keep my spikes in place, but none worked all day. This spray is amazing, I spray it on in the morning after I&#x27;ve spiked and \\&quot;messed it up good\\&quot; and it stays all day. Once you spray it on your hair isn&#x27;t moving. One warning though, don&#x27;t try to brush it once its on, it will cause an ouch moment.</li>
    <li> My all time favorite hair spray. Will give body to a limp hairstyle, but can also freeze a bun into place. I love the fresh, clean smell of this hair spray, too. I&#x27;ve used different hairsprays in the past that become white and flaky if you go for a day without washing your hair and then try to use a straightening iron...and this brand is NOT one of them. A bit on the pricey side but well worth it!</li>
    <li> I really dislike this hair spray!  I used to use Sebastian hair spray and decided to give this a shot because of the reviews.  Worse decision I ever made.  Once you spray this your hair is stuck!  You can&#x27;t even brush it out and hope it looks nice.</li>
    <li> Strong hold good price not too overwhelming scent.</li>
    <li> Great hairspray!  Holds well and works for anyone. The best value for the price. TIGI products are the best products!</li>
    <li> I normally never review products, and I buy a ton of stuff from Amazon. This was an exception. FINALLY a hair product that does what it says.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me start off by saying I am a male with thin, straight hair. I have tried countless gels/clays/pomades to work my hair into the style I want (sort of up and pushed to the side). They all end up doing nothing and my hair just falls flat or ends up greasy. This hair spray is an amazing solution. Shower, style my hair with just a tiny bit of gel, and spray. It hardens within a minute without looking like glue. You can further work your hair into a desired style afterwards. It lasts the entire day, even into your next shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This must be what the movie stars/singers with the perfectly styled hair use. One of the best products I&#x27;ve purchased on amazon.</li>
    <li> This hairspray has some serious hold.  It&#x27;s probably not for daily use and it&#x27;s definitely not for the faint of heart.  I was surprised at how much hold it had with just a light mist.  Industrial strength comes to mind.</li>
    <li> I have short hair, and I am a belly dancer.  I need a hairspray that is going to stand up to makeup, sweat, weather, and spins, and keep my hair in place and frizz free. This fits the bill!  This is a strong hairspray, and is probably not the one if you want your hair to move at all!</li>
    <li> I have tried many hair sprays.....hands down.....this is my all time favorite!  I have fine, limp, short hair and this product gives me the ability to work with it......yet keep the hold ALL DAY LONG.</li>
    <li> I keep coming back to this one! Little pricey, but it still does the best on my hair.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Best hairspray on the market.</li>
    <li> hard, strong hold, its great</li>
    <li> My favorite hairspray!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hairspray...I&#x27;ve been using it for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Holds like a champ. I have long, fine hair and this spray makes it look thicker and keeps my bangs where they need to be without looking like a helmet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Sticky. Really sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: If you want firm hold, this is your product. If you want to style your hair after you spray, don&#x27;t use this - it&#x27;s a finishing product only.</li>
    <li> I love this hair spray, as I only have to spray it once a week, and it keeps in nice, and plus it is water soluable so washes out easily.</li>
    <li> the nozzle on the spray can isnt a good one and the spray comes out in one stream  not a mist not happy with it</li>
    <li> Great product, I like the smell, and the spray can keep the hair style long lasting than my previous sprays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is actually my second time ordering this item. First order was canceled 1 day before the Estimated ship date, claimed \\&quot;out of stock\\&quot; in my order after spending 4 days to process, but it still showing \\&quot;in stock\\&quot; in its listing during and after those 4 days.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon failed to delivered the product on time for my second order. It was supposed to arrive on 8/12, but so far I still cannot receive it.&lt;br /&gt;I would rather ordering from them directly next time.</li>
    <li> To start off, I would like to say that my hair type and style is probably different from those of most other reviewers. I have what most people like to call \\&quot;Anime Hair\\&quot;, which means it is dyed, severely layered, and spikey/messy/fluffy. I&#x27;ve tried many hairsprays, from the cheaper ones such as Pantene and Tresemme, to the more expensive ones such as Sebastian Shaper Fierce, Matrix Vavoom, and now TIGI Bed Head Hard Head. The cheaper products did not hold as well unless I put many layers; however, this would make my hair extremely stiff and unnatural-looking - I don&#x27;t like to have the individual spikes be too defined as I feel it takes away from the natural-ness (if that&#x27;s a word). Further, it would never last more than a few hours before my hair started losing its volume and definition. Sebastian worked fairly well, but would also give my hair a bit of a \\&quot;wet\\&quot; look. It also would not hold up under windy conditions. Matrix Vavoom simply did nothing for my hair - I sprayed on several layers, and by the time I walked to my car from my house, the hairspray was completely gone, and it was like I had put nothing in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read up on some reviews about TIGI Bed Head Hard Head, and so I decided to try it - I am extremely glad I did! This hairspray has an extremely light and pleasant scent, and it seems to be indestructible. I spray on only 2 layers in the morning after I style my hair, and it lasts the entire day. I walked outside in windy conditions, and my hair was still EXACTLY the same as it was when I first sprayed it! Later that day, I was even walking outside for around 20 minutes as it was drizzling/raining lightly - I was sure my hair would be dead, but when I looked at the mirror in my car, my hair was still perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also sleep with the hairspray still in my hair, and it does not flake or do anything of the sort. I usually wash it out in the morning when I shower, and it washes out easily, without leaving any residue in my hair. I honestly feel that this hairspray is perfect in every way - it smells nice, it holds my hair perfectly (which no other hairspray has been able to do until now), and it is easy to remove!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For anyone who&#x27;s on the fence about buying this hairspray or is just looking for an amazing hairspray, buy this and you won&#x27;t regret it!stly feel that this hairspray is perfect in every way - it smells nice, it holds my hair perfectly (which no other hairspray has been able to do until now), and it is easy to remove!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For anyone who&#x27;s on the fence about buying this hairspray or is just looking for an amazing hairspray, buy this and you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> Keeps my hair in place and isn&#x27;t too hard on the hair like some other hairsprays I&#x27;ve used in the path.</li>
    <li> This is seriously strong hairspray. It is great if you prefer the edgier looks, but for a more subtle every day look, it probably won&#x27;t be your thing. I love that it gives that strong hold without looking clumpy or overdone. It is a bit of a pain to wash out though. I used it for teasing up my hair big when I went through that phase, but now it mainly sits for when I need to do a special occasion kind of look.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my teenage son he said that it holds well...but not sticky. Would buy it again.</li>
    <li> i usually use aussie instant freeze but wanted to try this but it is not even close to the same kind of hold. this hairspray didnt hold my hair at all. i was very disappointed. will not buy it again...i&#x27;ll stick with my aussie :)</li>
    <li> This hairspray works very well.  It&#x27;s a strong enough hold to keep my style all day but it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair too hard.</li>
    <li> The product arrived on time, but after a couple of uses the sprayer broke off one of the cans and was no longer useable. The cost and time to return was not worth the hassle.</li>
    <li> I have very thick and coarse hair and this spray did not hold my hairstyle very well. I do however, have a hard time finding any spray that will keep my style.</li>
    <li> Very good hold. Long lasting. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, scent and hold, hate when i run out of it!!!</li>
    <li> This is the best hair spray out there.  I use this when I curl my hair w/ a curling iron or use hot rollers. a few sprays and your hair will look fresh and styled HOURS later. I swear by this hair spray.</li>
    <li> Damaged, won&#x27;t spray straight went in my eye and caused infection.</li>
    <li> This by far is the best hairspray that I have used. It holds really well and can be brushed and washed out easily.</li>
    <li> TGI Bed Head Hard Hairspray is a great product.  It is one of the best hair sprays I have ever used.  Great hold and does not feel sticky or hard..  Just holds style really well.</li>
    <li> Love it, I been looking for hair spray like this for years. With 2 or 3 sprays, it holds for at least 2 days. My hair stays in style even in windy weather. It smells great but the spray button is kinda turn off for me. It takes effort to press the button. Otherwise, great product.</li>
    <li> My hair is very thin and fine; therefore, always look for ways to increase volume.  Once I have the volume style put together using various volume products, this hair spray keeps the volume style for a few days even after sleeping. Love it.</li>
    <li> I really like how easily my hair stays in place on using this spray. If i straighten my hair and then use the spray, the style lasts longer and survives a night of sleep. But I&#x27;ve noticed dust settles in my hair right after spraying it on, and my hair also looses the shine that came from conditioner, so it doesn&#x27;t look fresh anymore. So some days I skip the spray to keep the shine.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this hairspray. It&#x27;s the only brand I&#x27;ve used that doesn&#x27;t make my hair burn-toast stiff, yet gives it plenty of hold. A little goes a long way. Spraying too much will leave a silver-y residue on the hair, but as I said, you will not need to use that much to give your hair the amount of hold it needs.</li>
    <li> I have super (x1000) thick medium-short hair.  I have a near impossible time finding any sort of hair product that gives me the hold I want.  I have to say that this is definitely one of, if not THE, strongest hold hair spray I have found.  Definitely locks your hair in place, works great with a strong-hold  paste/wax as well.  Does not require much either which makes the bottle go a long way, have already repurchased and will definitely make this a staple of my daily hair routine.</li>
    <li> I use this hair product to keep my hair in place over a long day. This is the hardest hair spray that I have tried and it performs well in that capacity. I would not use it if you want that natural or matte look to your hair. It gives a light shine that makes it very obvious that you have product in your hair. This is not a bad thing but it might be different than some people are looking for. For a guy, combine with some shaping paste.. Use the paste to achieve the style you&#x27;re looking for then spray to keep it in place all day!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good, a little bit stiff, but good.</li>
    <li> I have thick asian hair and it is fairly long on top and basically shaved on the sides. This hairspray works great at keeping my hair in place all day even in the crazy heat and humidity of summer. It works too well, in fact, because if I use it too many days in a row, it becomes more and more difficult to wash out. Otherwise, its awesome</li>
    <li> Love it! Smells great and works perfect. Well worth the money. Definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for good hairspray.</li>
    <li> good hold, but opening clogs up frequently and residual spray fallout will make sink top sticky</li>
    <li> I have a short pompadour hairstyle that requires a lot of teasing and product to keep it from falling throughout the day. This hair spray does the trick! It doesn&#x27;t flex, which is what I need. The smell is good for products of this type (a lot of really powerful hair sprays smell awful). It does leave some residue in my hair, but I shower daily because of how much product I use, and it washes right out.</li>
    <li> Great hold, great value!</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT product! Holds my curly hair PERFECTLY!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hairspray and I have been using it for years.  It&#x27;s a harder hairspray, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if you like to comb through your hair afterwards.  But having said that there is still some flexibility. It also smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> Best hold on the market. Fairly easy to comb out.</li>
    <li> This is a very firm hair spray, but it does an amazing job when you need to have something that works in high humidity.  I get compliments on my hair even in the sultry Alabama summers, and I can even go from water aerobics to a club meeting, and my hair is still in place.  I do have gray hair, and a short haircut, so it is suitable for me! Amazon&#x27;s price is also unbeatable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been so used to a tight hold hair spray that allowed my hair to stay in form but somehow still feel like hair. That product got discontinued so I decided to give this one a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is not a bad spray but it&#x27;s also not what I am looking for. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, this spray will hold your hair into place, but it&#x27;ll definitely give that standard &amp;#34;this hair has spray on it&amp;#34; feel. Some people can live with that, but I have my own preferences. The nice part about this spray is that it doesn&#x27;t feel sticky and it&#x27;s not hard to wash off, relative to other products I&#x27;ve tried. I would definitely recommend this to anybody who&#x27;s looking for hair spray in general.</li>
    <li> Very strong hold. No residue Mild fragrance but not bad.</li>
    <li> This hair spray will hold your curl like a pro. Don&#x27;t use too much or your hair/curl will look stiff.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hairspray. . Its alot cheaper on Amazon then any retailer. Stays put all day</li>
    <li> I have not been able to find this in the stores in my area and my beautician can no longer get it.  I love it and it works better than any other spray</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like. Made my hair stiff like a brush.</li>
    <li> I really love this for my hair.</li>
    <li> I have used Bed Head Hard Head for about five years. I like the way it holds my fine hair in place. Your prices are much cheaper than where I have been purchasing it. I like having it delivered to my door, and the fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Great hairspray without spending salon prices.  Isn&#x27;t too stiff but holds all day.  Lid is a little hard to open.</li>
    <li> Probably the best hair spray I&#x27;ve ever used. It holds my hair great and doesn&#x27;t make it hard like other hairsprays. It also doesn&#x27;t smell funky, in fact it really has no smell. I have Asian dull hair, so it&#x27;s hard to make my hair stay with regular hairspray but this does the job without making it hard.</li>
    <li> love this hairspray...... &amp; I need to order more........ love it - comes to my door - great price.... keeps my hair in one place... even if it&#x27;s windy........ love, love, love the product........</li>
    <li> this was easy to order, great hold, better price than local or at the hair dresser / will order again</li>
    <li> Am from HUMID Central Florida.  This really holds.</li>
    <li> LOVE!  My hair stylist thinks I&#x27;m nuts for using this, she says it gives you helmet head.  I say it gives my hair awesome body and hold.  Just don&#x27;t try to run your fingers through it.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair spray I&#x27;ve ever used.  It will hold your styled hair at least a halt day, longer if not active. Plus, the can will last for some time before needing to be replaced.  I am so satisfied with this product that i would not consider testing another product.</li>
    <li> This is the only hair spray that I use because it hold my hair in place all day.  I was real happy about the time it took to reach my house.  Quick turn around and I like that!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this hairspray.  I have very fine, limp hair and have searched for what seems like my whole life for a hair product that gives me more volume.  This is it!  I have to say, my hair looks FABULOUS haha!</li>
    <li> I have used this hairspray for at least the last 4 years.  It&#x27;s the only hairspray I use now because it really does the job.  If you want light hold - just spray a little - but when you need a lot of hold, there is no other like it.  Hard head is true! Without this spray, I feel incomplete.</li>
    <li> Love this hairspray. Will definitely hold.</li>
    <li> Love this spray.  It washes out of your hair easily.  Holds my hair well.  The sprayer doesn&#x27;t clog up like some sprays. That drives me nuts.</li>
    <li> Best. Hairspray. Ever.  And I&#x27;ve tried a bunch.</li>
    <li> Hold is fantastic. A little use goes a long way. I do think that it builds up on the hair over time. That is the reason for the deduction of a star. However, a stripping shampoo or a couple of washes with baking soda and you are good to go. The nozzle on this NEVER clogs, by the way.</li>
    <li> Nozzle is too strong and narrow so you don&#x27;t get a very good mist. It&#x27;s more of a spray so it makes it harder to control how much you want to use and can easily spray too much in a area. Does hold hair in place somewhat, not sure if it locks/freezes it as others have stated. I&#x27;ve tried it on curls and it doesn&#x27;t hold exactly in place after the hair cools down, but much better than any other hairsprays I&#x27;ve tried. It doesn&#x27;t make your hair a helmet and does a good job of holding. The spray has a sweet scent that isn&#x27;t too overwhelming, but noticeable. Spray in small amounts as too much will make your hair look gray.</li>
    <li> This by far is the best hairspray I have ever used!!  Even though it costs more than some hairsprays, you do not need to use as much, so the bottle lasts longer.  It is great in humidity, is not sticky, and washes out easily.  It is more of a \\&quot;dry\\&quot; hairspray, so it does not weigh down your hair.  Also, the smell is nice.  Try it, and you won&#x27;t go back!!</li>
    <li> Holds all day without weighing down my hair!</li>
    <li> Love this product!  I need to order more!</li>
    <li> It really works astoundingly well, doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent and seems to last a long time.  The cap is bizarrely hard to get off sometimes though.</li>
    <li> applies very naturally</li>
    <li> My curly headed wife wubs it!</li>
    <li> . . . and she&#x27;s ALWAYS been hard to please!</li>
    <li> Well as Phil would say, &amp;#34;HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY&amp;#34; that pretty much sums it up for me !!! really great to have.</li>
    <li> By far my favorite hairspray. It is light yet strong. I can put a little on and it will hold or a lot and walk out in 65 mile an hour winds and it will still hold. I love it and I love the fact that it isn&#x27;t heavily scented.</li>
    <li> This was a decent price for a product that will last awhile. It does hold, you don&#x27;t need a lot -- and if you don&#x27;t use too much, it will not be too sticky.</li>
    <li> This is my go to &amp;#34;spray and lock&amp;#34; hair finisher. You gotta work fast if you spray with a heavy hand. But after practice you&#x27;ll understand that spraying from a distance is key.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really is a hard head hold, lasting me all day long. Only thing to watch out is clogged nozzles, that&#x27;ll convert the fine mist into an off stream mess. All I do is either run it under warm water, or pick the build up off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried the got2b cement spray, but the mist is not fine enough. This gives a super fine mist for the most intricate and natural looking hair. But be warned, too much product and it&#x27;ll give a shine you may or may not like.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for hairspray where your hair will not move at all from the wind this is perfect. I just don&#x27;t like that it hardens your hair and if you need to fix it after you accidentally spray it on, it&#x27;s really hard to fix your mistake after because your hair harden as soon as you spray it and if you keep messing with it the spray turns into this white flaky mess on your head. Just make sure you are set before you spray it on.</li>
    <li> Product received with cap broken</li>
    <li> This stuff is great.  It holds securely even in strong wind.  If you need a stiff hold, this is the product to get.  And Amazon has the best price on this as it tends to be pricey.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my.new stylist. Spray from at least 12&amp;#34; away in small sprays for a soft, gentle hold that stays in the Seattle winter.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a long time and love it. I bought a couple for stocking stuffers and it went over well!</li>
    <li> Great product.  Great shipping.</li>
    <li> My hair is very straight, fine, and nearly impossible to shape.  I used to just use Green Tree styling paste to control my hair; however, my hair would just fall down after a couple of hours.  Now I shape it with the paste and then spray it with this.  My hair will now keep it&#x27;s shape for the entire day.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this hairspray.  I have rather thin fine hair, so I back come for volume and this always holds my pouf in place!  Price on here, along with Prime free shipping was at least $5 cheaper than getting it at a salon!</li>
    <li> Some of the best spray on the market. I&#x27;ve been using for years. It is especially good for fine or limp hair.</li>
    <li> Love this hairspray as it doesn&#x27;t stiffen my hair and holds it in place perfectly!  I can&#x27;t stand having heavy spray on my hair and this does a great job.  Keeps it together without making it &amp;#34;stiff hair&amp;#34;.  :)</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy it! It said it would get here in three days and it ended up taking three months!  It leaves hair spray particles on your hair follicles and when it dries it gets flaky.  Don&#x27;t recommend it. Big sexy hair is way better than this bullboob!</li>
    <li> I am not sure if they changed the formula, but this didn&#x27;t use to leave my hair so stiff and stuck together. It gave good hold but before wouldn&#x27;t make hair so hard.</li>
    <li> This hair spray is great.  do not need a lot to keep hair in place just a light spray.  The best  hair spray ever  not sticky  hair feels soft but does not move even if it is windy out.</li>
    <li> My VERY favorite hairspray....it is the only one that holds my hair in place  : )  Thank you!</li>
    <li> This was my first time using Hard Head Spray.  I purchased it because I needed something that would hold my hair when I teased it when giving it volume.  This spray does the trick!  Freezes the hair almost instantly and doesn&#x27;t budge until you wash it out.  Best of all, a little goes a loooong way.  LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> Saved my having to stop at the salon to pick up hairspray and a better price than at the discount store.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a hair spray like this for a long time.  I can&#x27;t tell you how many trial and error hairsprays I bought before finding this one.  I like to fix my hair in the morning and have it stay in place ALL DAY.  Other hairsprays I&#x27;ve tried held my hair for a while and then broke down or something.  My hair would feel soft and not stay in place.  TIGI Bed Head Hard Head is my forever hairspray ( they better not quit making it either!!)  It has a nice and not overppowering fragrance, too.</li>
    <li> I have tried alot of hair sprays but nothing compairs with this. Holds my hair all day and never makes my hair oily!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this hairspray for quite a while now ... I&#x27;ve lots of hair but it&#x27;s fine and silky and will lay flat if I don&#x27;t give it a boost.  My formula?  I use Pureology Volume Shampoo and Conditioner, Redken Thickening Lotion 06 with a blow dry, and then Hard Head, which holds the boost in place, BUT, and this is a big but ... it doesn&#x27;t look or feel like I&#x27;ve anything on my hair.  It still feels soft and silky.</li>
    <li> It is the best Hair spray i&amp;#34;ve ever used. It is hard-to hold and is not affected by humidity.  Thank you so much.</li>
    <li> This is honestly the only spray I use. Wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive though. Very strong hold. Which is great because I&#x27;ve got medium length hair I&#x27;m trying to style.</li>
    <li> good product. holds hair for hours and doesn&#x27;t&#x27; dry my hair out.I recommended this hair spray for limp fine hair..</li>
    <li> I have baby fine hair that with some sprays just doesn&#x27;t work well. My beautician just introduced me to this one and I love it.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to anyone. It works really well and keeps your hair staying where you want it all day!</li>
    <li> I have super-fine hair that gets weighed down easily by products. If a hairspray doesn&#x27;t hold well enough on the first try, and I have to keep respraying - dull hair. If it&#x27;s at all sticky or heavy - flat hair. It&#x27;s a fine line, and the best hairspray I&#x27;ve tried is Hard Head. I agree with other reviewers that the hold might not last as long as you&#x27;d like, but it&#x27;s light enough to reapply for a touch-up without risking getting flattened.</li>
    <li> The bottle has a dent in it, and the lid has a crack too.</li>
    <li> Great. If you want your hair to stay in place use this product!</li>
    <li> love this hair spray, it&#x27;s the only one I can find to really hold wild hair in place, even on windy days.</li>
    <li> It is and was a very good product</li>
    <li> Been using this hairspray for at least 10 years.  Have had short pixie hair and now longer shoulder length hair, it has worked great for both.  I&#x27;ve also used it on multiple family members who have various types of hair-long, short, thick, thin.  Everyone should use it, and all other hairspray thrown away :)</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years.  It doesn&#x27;t cause breakage when you comb it out like others.  Definitely would recommend it.</li>
    <li> You cannot find this product cheaper in any store.  If you are looking for a hairspray that really works, this is it.  You will love it!</li>
    <li> This product had rave reviews. However, it is not comparable to Kenra which I went back to using. Th hairspray holds to a certain degree but is sticky when u try to brush it out. I would not say it is a power hold.</li>
    <li> I have very thin baby fine hair.  Most hair sprays either make it very limp or do not hold at all.  This hair spray holds my hair without making it limp or sticky.  This is a great hair spray, wish I had found it sooner.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair spray I&#x27;ve ever used. It has great hold and somehow manages to leave hair flexible enough to move and not look like a helmet. Some hairsprays that allow movement essentially just have less hold, but this actually will hold my style all day, until I sleep on it or wash it. Even then, I only have to style my hair the next day, don&#x27;t even really need to reapply the spray. It doesn&#x27;t get flakey or fuzzy and white like a lot of hair sprays. I can adjust my hair or even comb/brush it after spraying this on and it doesn&#x27;t get that fuzzy white texture. In fact, when I do brush out my hair, it still holds the shape it was sprayed in. I&#x27;ve tried expensive and cheap, flexible hold and strong hold and all around this is the most versatile, fantastic hair spray. I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more. I used to use multiple sprays depending on what I was trying to do with my hair and now I only reach for this one. Worth the purchase!</li>
    <li> I have very thick, very straight hair.  BedHead is the only product I can count on.  When I don&#x27;t feel like fussing with my hair, I can spritz on some BedHead, do some scrunching, and feel fabulous.</li>
    <li> I love this hair spray. Its the only kind I will use. It does clog up sometimes, but some hot water and youre good to go!!</li>
    <li> I have recently been doing some hair spray testing. I&#x27;ve purchased 7 different kinds in the past month or so. This one wins! It&#x27;s now become my go to spray. Does a great job holding my hair and I&#x27;m not left with hard or crunchy hair. Once my current bottle runs out I will absolutely be purchasing another.</li>
    <li> Cans were old and rusted.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years, love it!</li>
    <li> This is the spray my hair stylist uses.  It has great hold.  I  will continue to buy this hair spray.  .</li>
    <li> I love this hairspray!  It holds my hair all day but isn&#x27;t super heavy. I would recommend this product &amp; the price isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
    <li> One of the best hairsprays. This is very strong and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I purchesed this. My boyfriend love this, he uses it when we have going out for dinner with friends or when we going out for shopping. He found it in many retial store for a long time, and could not find it. Thanks Amazon carry this product. It is not too sticky, and I like the smell by the way. After spraying this, hair can stay at the same style all day. No matter you do some sports, it still can keep your hair style.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this hair spray for years now! I&#x27;ve tried various different &amp;#34;strong hold&amp;#34; hairsprays, but none have lived up to the task like TIGI Bed head Hard Head Hair Spray! YOur hair will definitely feel a little crunchy afterwards, but nothing a brush can&#x27;t smooth out.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the only hair spray I use.  It holds good but doesn&#x27;t leave your hair stiff or sticky.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This does exactly what it is supposed to.  The hold is as strong as anything, and it sets pretty quickly.  I have pretty long and thick hair (for a male), but this keeps it coiffed all day.  It definitely earns the \\&quot;hard head\\&quot; title, but I knew that going into it so that&#x27;s not a drawback for me.  Washes out easily.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why I keep trying other hair sprays just to find out that they don&#x27;t come close to being as good as Hard Head!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, let me state that I am wind-phobic.  I grit my teeth when I feel the wind blowing through my carefully coiffed hair.  I want every strand of hair on my head to stay in the same place I so carefully put it in the morning.  So this is the hairspray I turn to.  It holds extremely well without the smell or stigma of something like aqua net.  The other plus is that you do have a short amount of time after spraying to finger style before it dries.  Also, I have yet to experience any clogging on the nozzle and I have been using this product for over a year.  This hair spray also washes out cleanly and easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a really hard hold-this is a great product.</li>
    <li> I have used this hairspray for at least 10 years and it is still my favorite.  I like that you can strengthen the hold by adding layers without looking like you are shellacked.  Some people complain that the lid is too hard to pull on and off, so I say just leave it off.</li>
    <li> I wanted something to hold well. this does the trick.  I was able to brush it out as needed.  Would order it again to go over my regular spray.</li>
    <li> holds great only  spray i use wouldnt use anything else</li>
    <li> I have used this hairspray for years! Great price!</li>
    <li> I have tried others but this is the best!</li>
    <li> Ok, I&#x27;ve used a lot of hairsprays, but have found this one to be the best I&#x27;ve found by far.  It has a good hold, but not &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; feel.  The smell is not a put off either.  It dries quickly and is &amp;#34;combable&amp;#34;.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Does what it says, all day hold for my curls (which would always fall flat the second I left the house) Awesome!</li>
    <li> This has come as a refreshing break frm lame sprays made in Kenya or UK....nothing can hold my hair here...so BH was sooooooo amazing! Really holds my hair in humid climate!</li>
    <li> The spray itself is good but when I received my spray 2 DAYS LATE, it was all banged up and the lid was smashed to pieces and the spray piece was off. Really?! Order this product, but from someone else!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had trouble with hair spray - my hair gets flat by the end of the day.  However, with Bed Head Hard Head, it lasts all day.  Only use a little, because it&#x27;s some powerful spray, or your hair will look like a helmet.  It&#x27;s worth the $20.</li>
    <li> My hair is very fine and thin and takes a lot of product to keep it in place.  But if I use TOO much, it will lay limp.  Hard head is the mixture of these.  I go into salons and they have the STRONG hold sprays and they are usually wimpy.  If I had a full head of thick luxurious hair I wouldn&#x27;t use something this strong, but I don&#x27;t.  I love it for its hold, but it isn&#x27;t so sticky that you can&#x27;t brush it out when you need to.  Hope TIGI doesn&#x27;t change the formula and mess it up!</li>
    <li> I DONT CARE FOR THIS PARTICULAR PRODUCT--IT DOESNT SMELL GOOD AND DOESNT SEEM TO HOLD WELL EITHER. I HAVE FINE STRAIT HAIR, AND USUALLY GO FOR THE PROFESSIONAL PRODUCTS--BUT I ALSO CARE HOW THEY SMELL. I LIKE TO CHOOSE ONE THAT HAS A GOOD SWEET SMELL TO IT. THIS ONE DOES NEITHER!</li>
    <li> Best hairspray around!</li>
    <li> Did the job and on time</li>
    <li> Super product.  Holds head firmly without the 60&#x27;s tight spray look.</li>
    <li> needed an extra, heavy duty holding spray and this fits the bill.  So good that I have recommended it to a friend.</li>
    <li> I got this in my mailbox last week and used it for the first time yesterday. And I was compelled to write a review bcoz it is soo amazing, that it would be criminal if I didnt write one for it! :) I used it to get that bump at the crown, and initially i sprayed it twice, also my hair is very fine and not all that volumnous, so it didn&#x27;t hold the bump for more than 5 min.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I re-read the instructions at the back of the bottle and it said - \\&quot;the more the spray, the harder it gets\\&quot;. So I sprayed 5-6 times, and the look stayed INTACT this time! My hair didn&#x27;t move. They stayed like that till evening and after it, I just sprayed it again once and I was good to go, for the rest of the evening. I can understand now why the bottle is huge! You will need that much quantity if you want to hold the hair in place. But the more your spray, the better the look stays in place. It almost freezes your hair in place. Now with all that spraying I was concerned that I might not be able to comb my hair through if needed, but brushing my hair wasnt a problem either. Generally you should avoid brushing after you have sprayed the look, in order to avoid reducing the effectiveness of the spray, but if need be, you can brush your hair, even after spraying them, and you wont have an issue! Tried and tested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it left no residue on my hair like the others might leave. And it does not grease even a bit, even after heavy spraying. I washed my hair today, after using it yesterday, and it did no damage to my hair. None whatsoever! I love it so much, that after it&#x27;s constant promotion with my sis, I had to order one for her too! She couldnt help getting one for herself :) It can be used daily for the on-the-go quick looks! Just spray it and you are good to go! At this price, it is really worth the money! Every cent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try and you will love it!! I do :) TIGI HARD HOLD SPRAY ROCKS! :)</li>
