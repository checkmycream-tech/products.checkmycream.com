<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have to say that I have never used this bag for its intended purpose of creating nut milk, but I have used it many times as an all purpose strainer and in that respect if does a fantastic job and is extremely durable. I haven&#x27;t had any issues whatsoever with it and it more than lives up to its description of being durable and able to get the job done literally no matter what you are straining, whether it is in the kitchen or in the garage, this very durable nylon mesh bag will get the job done. Highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shawn Kovacich&lt;br /&gt;Author and Creator of numerous books and DVD&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> High quality, and so far has taken a lot of abuse by many nuts.</li>
    <li> I love almond milk, but it&#x27;s expensive.  This cheesecloth-like bag takes out all the work.  It cleans up well and stores nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soak some almonds, blend them and cheese.  That&#x27;s it.  Unlike store bought milk, the leftover almond meal can be used in recipes.  My tip:  almond (or cashew) pesto.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:  I was solicited for this review and received a free product.</li>
    <li> unfortunately the soy bean milk I made is hot and so fine... that many got caught in the bag and I can&#x27;t easily wash off.. but the soy milk is so smooth and I can&#x27;t taste the soy bean at all. It is indeed a very strong bag. I would buy it again...</li>
    <li> Great buy and you save a lot of money making your own almond milk!</li>
    <li> I use this for homemade greek yogurt. It works perfectly  and is easy to clean. I would get it again.</li>
    <li> Appears to be very durable. Has lasted the longest of all bags purchased to make my nut milks</li>
    <li> Best quality nut milk I&#x27;ve made came from this nut milk bag. I made almond milk and it barely took any time at all. Love it!</li>
    <li> Great bags and came in very quick! Just 3 days on regular shipping. I can&#x27;t wait to use them for Almond milk and ricotta cheese!</li>
    <li> I bought this bag primarily to make juices with my Vitamix blender. I have used it twice already - once for carrot juice, and once to strain strawberry limeade. It is wonderful!  So much more convenient and efficient than straining by hand&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hesitant before making the carrot juice because I was afraid it would turn orange, but it washed up nicely. A very high quality product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m looking forward to attempting nut milks with it soon, and I will update my review after I do.</li>
    <li> This nut bag is fabulous! Very strong and sturdy and did an incredible job filtering even the softest smallest pieces out. I highly recommend this bag for anyone making their own nut milk.</li>
    <li> This bag works better than any other bag I have used, and is very easy to clean.  It appears to be constructed of quality materials and should last a long time if cared for properly.  I highly recommend this bag.</li>
    <li> I really support healthy eating and have imbibed it in my everyday life. Being able to make my own almond milk is something that I have recently incorporated in my low carb lifestyle. I like the fact that I know exactly what kind of ingredients are in my food/beverage. This product is pretty amazing because not only can I use it to make my almond milk...I can also use it for sprouting - which I do on a regular basis! It is so versatile and easy to use - I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for other consumers like myself. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
    <li> Best nut milk bag EVER!!</li>
    <li> There are two ways to make almond milk. The first involves purchasing a masticating juicer. Feel free to price around for one of those. The second is to grind them in your blender and strain them through cheesecloth. Guess which one costs less?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is where these bags come in very handy. They are actually larger than I expected and will hold plenty. But unlike cheesecloth, there is no prep, cutting, and worrying. Just pour everything into the bag and let the milk drain out and squeeze the last out when you are done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like cheesecloth, this bag can be used for other products that need fine straining - my personal favorite is making yogurt cheese. But it can be used for just about anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since it is reusable, you can wash it out once you are done and use it again, and again, and again. While I don&#x27;t think we will save the earth by not using cheesecloth, it is nice not to have to buy new cheesecloth every time I need to strain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a coupon for a free sample so that I could test mine for a review. It is now a part of my canning supplies since that is an area I often need to strain.</li>
    <li> Using this for a review on our group on Facebook: The Recipe Club, and I must say it is SMASHTABULOUS!!! Two thumbs up!! I will definitely tell our members that this nut bag surpasses all!! Easy to clean no remnants in the milk! JUST GREAT!! Thank u!!! I will be giving a lucky member in our group a gift of one. :-)</li>
    <li> great quality, can&#x27;t beat this price, fast delivery</li>
    <li> Love it! Used it the day I received it!</li>
    <li> Of all the nut milk bags I&#x27;ve owned, this is the highest quality and most durable. I love that it&#x27;s reusable too. I&#x27;m excited to also use it for cheese!</li>
    <li> Fantastic quality &amp; fast delivery. Outstanding! Will be back. :)</li>
    <li> 1st time user and not sure what to expect. I have been making healthier meals.One particular meal is with spaghetti squash and preparing it as a &amp;#34;pasta&amp;#34;. The 1st time I prepared it my squash was watery and not appetizing. It was edible, but really did not love it. This time after baking my squash, I put half in a strainer and the other half in the Nut Milk Bag. The squash in the bag drained dramatically more that the one in the strainer. I actually put the rest in the Nut Milk Bag. Of course I did need to squeeze the bag, but it did not turn my squash in to mush. Only a gentle squeeze is needed. My squash was much more similar to a &amp;#34;pasta&amp;#34; this time around&lt;br /&gt;I am super excited to use it in more ways.&lt;br /&gt;It was also vey easy to rinse. Super easy and time saving.&lt;br /&gt;I was sent this to review, however that does not impact my review.</li>
    <li> I used this bag to make almond milk.  Bag is strong (no popped seams), easy to clean, and quick to dry.  It will be perfect for rinsing quinoa--no more bits stuck in a standard metal mesh strainer.</li>
    <li> My first official nut bag! So far so good, and easy to clean and not creating a mess as my cheese cloths have previously. Hope to put this to more use!</li>
    <li> I just started making almond milk a few weeks ago. I already had a Vitamix, so all I needed was a nut milk bag; I ended up getting two. This bag isn&#x27;t quite like the picture, but it works perfectly. The mesh is very fine, so I have no bits of almond in my almond milk. The only thing I would wish for would be for a wider mouth so I could open the bag out over my measuring bowl when I pour through it. As it is, I need to hold onto the bag with one hand while pouring with another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro tip: The bag looks like it is inside out when you receive it, and it is. However, leave it like that. With the seams on the outside, it is much easier to clean.</li>
    <li> Sturdy bag with a good capacity. No more buying coconut milk for me!&lt;br /&gt;Making it myself is healthier, fresher, cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;I intend to keep this bag busy!</li>
    <li> I loved it!&lt;br /&gt;I love making almond and hemp milk with it.</li>
    <li> Works great and prompt service.  Thank you</li>
    <li> Have only used it once, but seems sturdy and worth what I paid for it.</li>
    <li> Ever have grainey home made almond milk? No more! This bag allows you to &amp;#34;strain&amp;#34; your milk to ensure that all the pulp is out of your almond milk or any other nut milk. It&#x27;s super useful to have in the kitchen. Definitely would recommend to strain things. The design makes it easy to use and much better than cheese cloth.</li>
    <li> Perfect!! Better than cheese cloth and timely delivery</li>
    <li> nut bag arrived quickly and was of high quality.</li>
    <li> Quick ship, works great, quality product, will enjoy this item for other uses in kitchen as well as nut milk..Highly Recommended</li>
    <li> This nut milk bag is the best one I&#x27;ve tried!  It strains beautifully, and has been very easy to use, as well as clean.  I highly recommend this bag for straining anything - nut milk (its original intended purpose), straining fruit or vegetable juices that were done in a blender, and even for rinsing wild rice!</li>
    <li> I bought this to make homemade cheese and it works, even on goat&#x27;s milk which develops very small curds during the process.  Unlike using cheesecloth, using the Nut Milk Bag results in hardly any waste and is more sanitary plus it already has its own string for hanging it up.  Since it is reusable, I save time and money.  The fact that this is BPA-free was  one of the main reasons that I purchased this product.  Clean-up is easy, too.  I will try using it for other kitchen chores.</li>
    <li> This is my third nut bag and by far my favorite. I recommend it highly! If I could give it 10 stars, I would.</li>
    <li> The best nutbag I have ever used! It did not stretch when squeezing out liquid. Excellent quality and perfect size!  We will be using it to hang cheese too thank you</li>
    <li> This nut bag is fantastic!  I have been using it daily for making almond milk and rinsing beans and grains and plan to use it tonight to strain the seeds out of the homemade tomato soup I am making!  What an awesome product and an even better price.  This bag is so versatile, how did I ever live without it???</li>
    <li> Perfect for making almond milk.</li>
    <li> Great quality and perfect size. Can&#x27;t wait to use this</li>
    <li> Not what I expected but ended up working better that what I originally wanted; it also shipped quickly. I would definitely recommend this bag for milk. (it beats the cheese cloth or strainer i usually use)</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with my purchase! It is easy to use and clean. My nut milk came out just as good as what I buy at the store. Love the fact that it can be used to make other foods/beverages! I&#x27;ve shared mine with all of my friends and shared where they can obtain their own.</li>
    <li> Great quality item, would recommend, thank you! A+++++</li>
    <li> Perfect for cold-brewed/cold-press/cold-filtered coffee! This bag has become my best friend for the warm-weather months, because they mean I can finally make really rich, low-acid iced coffee with nearly no effort. Following the standard cold-brewed coffee recipes I found online, I made a gallon of rich, concentrated coffee overnight in my fridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summer just got even better.</li>
    <li> In the interest of full disclosure I need to start with two facts:  1) I received this as a free sample from the manufacturer as they were interested in hearing experiences with their product, and 2) I do not make nut milk,  though this bag may inspire me to start since I am gluten free and use almond flour and almond products all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s why I wanted this bag and why I think many of you may want it as well.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I often saute vegetables to use in recipes.  The latest recipe I&#x27;ve been trying to conquer is the lo carb gluten free quiche (aka crustless quiche).  My problem has always been that the sauteed veggies add way too much water to other recipes, particularly the very sensitive custardy quiche.  I&#x27;ve tried putting the veggies in a strainer but it just doesn&#x27;t do the trick.  I&#x27;ve kept them in the fridge overnight on a bed of super absorbent paper towels and though this works to some extent, its a long process and involves changing out the paper towels several times.  Therefore, tedious and NOT environmentally friendly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter the nut milk bag....  PERFECT!  After sauteing I put the veggies in the bag and hang the bag over a bowl.  I just sauteed 2 large onions  with a pound of mushrooms and a box of spinach and put all that in the bag.  (If you&#x27;ve ever sauteed that combination you know how much liquid it produces!) The bag still had room to hold more. As I type this the liquid is draining.  Every so often I give the bag a little squeeze to help the draining along.  This is exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for.  In the time it has taken to type this I&#x27;ve extracted a cup of liquid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It solves a few problems....&lt;br /&gt;1) in a strainer your veggies are exposed to the elements while they drain.

    <li> Bag measures 10\\&quot; x 13\\&quot; made from very tight mesh nylon. Easy to clean in warm soapy water. Does not retain odors or fine particles.&lt;br /&gt;Quality construction with superior grade materials.&lt;br /&gt;I mainly used it to make yogurt and Greek yogurt. It can also be used to strain for all sorts of nut milks, blended fruit/veggy/sprouts/hemp etc.- the limit is only one&#x27;s imagination.&lt;br /&gt;I plan to purchase a few more for my kitchen and to give as presents. Recommend without hesitation.</li>
    <li> Not only is this great for nut milks but it is great for draining anything. I have a Vitamix and have used this bag to filter pulp when I make juice.</li>
    <li> This is a great little accessory to have. I received this as a sample in exchange for a thorough review. Unfortunately, I myself did not get a chance to use it myself because I am not much of a kitchen gal, but I gave it to my parents and they love it. They use it all the time for so many different things. It was a great gift and they were very pleased. I highly recommend this item for a gift or for anyone who needs to strain anything. My dad makes us pomegranate juice and we can use this to strain out the seeds. It is brilliant. And delicious. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As another reviewer noted, I did receive multiple emails from the seller with information on how to use this bag but I appreciate the attention the sellers take in order to help you with new and interesting ways to use the product. I personally think it&#x27;s great and you can unsubscribe if you don&#x27;t want to receive the emails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller is great and very helpful. A+ product!</li>
    <li> Very fine mesh, worked perfectly and easy to clean</li>
    <li> My nut milk bag arrived quickly. Love it -- sturdy, versatile, quality materials. Thanks again!</li>
    <li> High quality. Well made. I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I found this product to be very well made. The materials and craftsmanship are excellent.  I checked the stitching carefully, and it appears to be flawless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very handy drawstring at the top.  I expect that this product will provide years of good service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also appreciate the 100% money back guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;√ Great product, but really &amp;#34;Homemade?&amp;#34;  C&#x27;mon, Kitchen Essentials, it really isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;homemade&amp;#34; is it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Product sample provided for review]</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use my bag for milking. I use it for boiling, simmering or blanching foods in a pot on the cook top. It works just great: Rice and grains for cold salads; blanching veggies for freezing; containing fish heads and bones, chicken carcasses, and other ingredients for broths and stocks, and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went in search of a bag like this after I tried a new product from Betty Crocker, Simply Salad. I really liked the technique; it worked so well: The rice and grain ingredients are enclosed in a fine mesh plastic pouch. You toss the pouch into boiling water and let the grains swim in the pouch in the low-boiling water for X amount of minutes, then remove the pouch from the boiling water and place it in a colander and rinse it under cold water until its cool, then you let it drain, then slice the pouch open and pour the grains into a bowl. You end up with nice separate grains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am here to tell you that this bag holds up well in boiling liquids, it is easy to wash out, and it is resistant to staining. (It will pick up some stain along the way, but it doesn&#x27;t retain smells to any great extent. I would suggest that you get at least two, if you intend to use it for cooking and straining for almond milk or making shrub drinks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received a sample product from Everyday Kitchen Essentials.</li>
    <li> I received one of these awesome bags to review on my blog.. I had never made almond milk before, and wanted to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;My daughter LOVES almond milk!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I set off to find a recipe and set to work.. I made a few bad choices in containers, but thanks to the excellent design of this bag, I was able to salvage my efforts.. Using a bunch of cheesecloth and strainers and such is a mess, but this bag makes the whole process simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It holds a lot of weight, the string helps you secure the bag and the cleanup is super easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great product!</li>
    <li> Excellent quality straining bag that has multiple uses.  This bag is very high quality.  The mesh is very fine and strong, the stitching is even and strong, and the design is perfect with the rounded edges.  Rounded edges make it so much easier for the liquid to drip out one place - the lowest point at the bottom.  No corners for the pulp to get caught in or get messy as things tend to just get caught up in corners.  There is a drawstring top.  It&#x27;s a high quality item that will stand up to multiple uses, not like cheapily made products or cheesecloth.  It&#x27;s a large bag, 10 X 13.  In the Bonus Recipe Book you get recipes and directions for Almond Milk, Creamy Chocolate Hazelnut Milk and Pistachio Milk.  It&#x27;s strong, easy to use, easy to wash and has the full backing from a very knowledgeable and friendly company.  So who would like this product?  The person who wants to make healthy homemade nut milks, fresh fruit juices, yogurts and cheeses.  The gardener who would like a reusable product for sprouting seeds.  The Prepper who would like to include this in their bug out bag for filtering out large particulates from a water source.  Recommended!</li>
    <li> This product is exactly as described.  It arrived earlier than it&#x27;s due date.  I love making my own almond and cashew milk!</li>
    <li> Prompt delivery.  Looking forward to making almond milk soon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been intending to make my own nut milk for a while now, but it seemed like a messy proposition at best.  So when I got the chance to evaluate the Everyday Kitchen Essentials nut milk bag, I jumped at it.  I am so glad I did because I just finished making a batch of really delicious almond milk, and am busy planning what comes next:  Cashew?  Macadamia?  Walnut?  What about pistachio?  I&#x27;m starting to feel kind of carried away by the nut milk love here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s an easy process, though it does take time.  I soaked the almonds for about 10 hours, and while I was waiting for the magic  to happen I thought I&#x27;d give a shot to an idea that occurred to me the day I opened the package: Will this help me make fruit and vegetable juice?  See, I&#x27;ve had juicers in the past, and the sheer amount of work involved was more than I wanted to bother with.  They were big, clunky machines that took up a lot of space in my kitchen, cost a small fortune and were so difficult to clean that I rarely used them.  But I never really lost the desire to juice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So today I tossed an orange, and apple, some carrots, and a bit of ginger into the old blender and hit High.  I let it work a bit, and then poured the resulting slurry through the bag.  Boomski, I had a delicious glass of juice, the pulp was easy to get rid of, and the bag got tossed into a bowl of warm, soapy water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I&#x27;m saying here is that the possibilities are, if not exactly endless, extensive.  This bag is a fast, reliable way to strain liquid from solid.  It&#x27;s a good, heavy mesh fabric that cleans up easily.  It&#x27;s a low-tech solution to a lot of kitchen tasks.  I&#x27;m thinking I may be able to use it to strain homemade cheese, or Greek-style yogurt, too.  In light of that the approximately $12 price tag isn&#x27;t as unreasonable as I first thought it was since it&#x27;s clear I&#x27;m going to get a lot of use out of this bag, and save money while I&#x27;m doing it.</li>
    <li> This bag worked awesome to make homemade juice. I have never made almond milk. However, I love homemade juice but hate having to get out the blender to make it. I used watermelon and strawberries. It was awesome to get the juice without the strawberry seeds. And the watermelon worked really well too. I washed it and was surprised that even after washing, the bag was like brand new. I was making a cold pasta and our strainer was dirty. I used this in its place and it worked really well! I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing what other uses I can come up with and may even try almond milk!</li>
    <li> WARNING TO OTHER REVIEWERS. THIS SELLER SENT ME AT LEAST 6 EMAILS ASKING FOR A REVIEW AFTER I POSTED THIS.  HE WENT SO FAR AS TO SEND TWO REQUESTS ON THE SAME DAY.  MY REVIEW IS IN EXCHANGE FOR A FREE PRODUCT AND A LOT OF FRUSTRATION.  I ENDED UP BLOCKING HIS EMAILS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never make nut milk and I have no idea how to do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a heavy-duty reusable nylon fine mesh strainer with lots uses. It is cross-stitched and double-stitched at every seam.  The nylon fabric has a very fine mesh which makes this strainer so versatile.  It can substituted for things like cheesecloth, metal strainers, tea filter, coffee filter, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may stain but who cares.  This is a well made product but no nut milk for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the smaller version of this nut milk bag, and this one is equally great.  It is nylon, so it is easy to clean and doesn&#x27;t make big gaps that let pulp through when squeezed.  As with other bags, processing nuts or some fruits too much, creating a creamy texture, can block up the tiny holes and make it hard to use until you clean it.  I&#x27;ve been using it to strain my blackberries, and it has worked very well.  The liquid flows through well and the thicker portion is easy to wring out.  The resulting liquid is free of seeds and has a smooth consistency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, it does what a nut milk bag should do and is easy to work with and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you to the company for a review unit.</li>
    <li> I have a Rawsome creations nut milk bag that is starting to split at the seams due to my partner squeezing a bit to hard, so I needed another one as a backup for when the Rawsome finally pops a seam. I got this bag as it was around the same price, and WOW, this one is sooooooo much better! The mesh is finer, so there is less pulp in your juice. The mesh is much more durable, so it will stand up to my always-running-late-and-in-a-hurry partner much better than the Rawsome bag. The fine mesh is easier to clean and it isn&#x27;t stained yet (though I haven&#x27;t tried it with turmeric root or beets yet). I am able to squeeze all the liquid out of the pulp so much more easily with this bag. I was shocked to see only about 1/2 a cup of pulp was left in the bag when I&#x27;d filled the blender jar to the very top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this bag for making juice with my VitaMix!</li>
    <li> I received one Homemade Nut Milk Bag, from Everyday Kitchen Essentials to review!  It’s quite impressive that you can make milk from nuts and it’s super easy!  All you do is take a cup of Almonds and soak them over night in a bowl of filtered water.  Then you just strain and rinse them.  Put them into a blender, with some filtered water and blend them for 5 minutes on high.  After that, you just empty the blender into the bag and squeeze the milk through the bag, into a bowl.  At this point you can add sweetener or whatever else you would like.  IT’S THAT EASY!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most AWESOME thing about this bag is that it can be used over and over, plus it’ll produce nut milk to die for!  It’s made out of premium nylon.  Another great feature this bag has, is that it’s large enough to hold everything!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is another one of my favorite products, that I would stand behind and highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Wanting to try making my own almond milk, I ordered this and it arrived promptly.  It was extremely easy to use and to clean. I&#x27;m sure I will get a lot of use out of this bag.  Why pay top dollar for almond milk with additives, in a non-recyclable container, when it&#x27;s so easy to make your own? Buy this bag, make your own almond milk. You will not regret it.</li>
    <li> Great customer service.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic bag that is well made, the seams are tightly stitched and the fabric is perfect for straining nut milk. I could imagine that you could use it for other straining purposes. I threw mine in the wash machine and it held up very well. You can also just rinse it out and re-use. I think this is a good price/value product, I am very happy and would recommend to others!</li>
    <li> Much easier to clean than using several strainers.</li>
    <li> Love my new nut milk bag!!&lt;br /&gt;Sturdy, strains milk from pulp quickly, squeezes out the last of the milk easily.  The pulp is easy to remove completely from bag with no effort.  Washes and dries so well, too!</li>
    <li> I have to admit, I&#x27;ve never liked nut milk all that much. In fact, most of the time I rather despise it, mostly because of the seemingly always grainy texture no matter what sort of filtering method my wife and I have used. It always ended up grainy, which made it a poor substitution for dairy milk, that is, until now. This nut milk bag is superb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is very simple in concept and execution, so this review will be short and sweet, just like the milk it produces. I&#x27;ve used all manners of nut milk filters, cheese cloths, you name it, but THIS particular bag was the best of all by a long shot. Using it to filter almond milk creates drink that is deliciously creamy and VERY smooth. It&#x27;s fantastic. We&#x27;ve also used it to filter juices and other fresh made liquids to make them smoother and free of particles, and it works just as well for those things as well. It&#x27;s also very simple and easy to clean, and for a dumb caveman like me, this is pleasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So overall, it&#x27;s a product as simple in concept and execution as its name would suggest, but it&#x27;s the quality of the results that elevates this nut bag higher than the rest, for me anyway. If you&#x27;re like me and you don&#x27;t normally like nut milk because it&#x27;s too &amp;#34;rough&amp;#34; to enjoy, then I&#x27;d heartily recommend this bag. When I got mine, the price was quite cheap, so it&#x27;s definitely a great value. I hope you enjoyed this review and found it helpful. Thanks for reading. Toodles.</li>
    <li> While I have not yet used this bag to make nut milk- although I certainly plan to!- it is a valuable addition to my kitchen and work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I drain a lot of stuff, from thawed frozen spinach, through homemade yogurt to get a thicker result, and especially for ricotta (an ideal graveyard for sour but palatable milk).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I honestly do not know how I got along for these past several years with merely cheesecloth and old kitchen towels, without this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m all about home made, and love making cheese. I have always used cheesecloth previously, and have found that while cheesecloth works, sometimes it&#x27;s a pain to use and clean. So when Everyday Kitchen Essentials offered me this nut milk bag to try in exchange for a review, I agreed with the thought that I would try it for cheese making.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mainly make goat cheese chevre, and this bag works amazing in straining out the whey from the chev. I was able to easily pour everything into the bag, tighten the drawstring, hang, and done in half the time. I also made rice milk using this bag, and it was much easier to use than the fine mesh strainer I was using previously, and because of the size of the bag, I was able to strain a larger amount in a shorter amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It cleans much easier than cheesecloth (it is nylon, so naturally it would), I have been washing it in the dishwasher and it seemed to have held up fine, though I couldn&#x27;t find any instructions on whether or not it&#x27;s dishwasher safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m extremely happy with this bag, and I highly recommend it. I can see it being used for numerous projects.</li>
    <li> This is a large strong, fine mesh bag that you WILL use over and over again. I love the rounded bottom which makes cleaning easier. Besides making nut milks and straining juices, I&#x27;ve used this bag to strain a bursted tea bag out of the tea. You&#x27;ll find many uses for this top quality bag. I received this bag as a sample.</li>
    <li> I’m not a nut milk person. I am a cheese person. I had heard that this nut milk bag makes a good substitute for cheesecloth, and because I don’t make cheese very often because it is such a pain to clean up, I welcomed the opportunity to try this bag instead. (The manufacturer provided me with a free sample bag for purposes of this review.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a substitute for cheesecloth, this is more than effective at straining out the whey from the curds. The fine plastic mesh is much easier to handle than traditional cheesecloth, and the drawstring makes it easy to hang up the bag for extended draining. Some of the curds did tend to stick to the inside of the bag a little bit, but it’s easy enough to scrape them off with a spoon or spatula. Cleanup is also quite easy. You just turn the bag inside out and put a little dish soap on it, and it cleans up in seconds. To dry, you just hang it up by the drawstring. My only complaints about the bag are design related. The first is that the drawstring is on the inside of the bag, so it is a little tricky to keep it out of the curdled milk going in and the cheese coming out. I suppose you can just turn this thing inside out to use it, but I wonder how that will affect the seams and mesh. The other complaint is that the shape of this bag is a little goofy, somewhere between a square and a circle. This means it doesn&#x27;t really have a clear way to be held to pour out the contents. Of course, if you’re making nut milk, these are both mute points, since you’re going to be squeezing and handling the bag anyway, and the extraction of the contents and location of the drawstring are irrelevant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m not sure I’m going to make cheese any more frequently because of this bag, but I can say, when I do make cheese, I’ll likely reach for this bag before I reach for the cheesecloth. That said, it’s not perfect, which is why I rate it at a full four stars.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted and received it fast.</li>
    <li> I love my new Bag!  I do not want to call it a Nut Milk Bag as I plan on using it for juicing and rinsing Quinoa. The material is amazing.  The bag rinsed clean and dried quickly which is a plus.  I am confident that this is a high quality product and I will be able to use it for many years to come.</li>
    <li> This is a quality nut bag. We have an Omega juicer that does nut milks and I&#x27;ve found this to be an invaluable combination along with that. Are you required to have a juicer for this to work? No.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a quality bag and you can really feel that quality in your hands compared to the ones we can get at Target and places like that.</li>
    <li> I got this bag with my mother in mind, and she loves it without reservation. I admit it&#x27;s personally quite staggering how many versatile uses this kind of bag has, never before really paying attention to all that sort of thing in the past. Heck, I&#x27;ll say it: I hadn&#x27;t a clue how one &amp;#34;milks a nut&amp;#34; before now. LOL Yet now after observing my mother using this Nut Milk Bag, I have to wonder off hand how a kitchen can do without one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Every Day Kitchen Essentials Nut Milk Bag has now become a daily tool for her. The touted quality of long lasting durability has taken up the gauntlet of intense usage. She does it all, nut milk, sprouting, Vitamix juicing, etc, so much in fact that I may have to get her a couple more bags to handle it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bag has seen intense versatile action in a short amount of time, and it&#x27;s handling as well as it claims!</li>
    <li> Love this bag! Sturdy construction, easy to clean and works like a charm!</li>
    <li> This is THE BEST Nut Milk Bag that I have ever used.  It&#x27;s easy to clean and allows me to get the most out of my almonds.  I&#x27;ve also used it to rinse my quinoa and it was just the easiest thing to do.  I love it.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with this Nut Milk Bag.</li>
    <li> Due to food allergies, we drink almond milk.  I have always wanted to try to make my own, but was not sure where to start - the good news being that there Nut Milk Bags available!  I received a Nut Milk Bag from Everyday Kitchen Essentials for review, but my opinions are 100% honest and 100% my own!&lt;br /&gt;This nut milk bag is great because, as a first time nut milk maker, it comes with an easy to follow booklet of recipes and instructions.  I set to making my own almond milk and was very impressed with how easily it all came together!  Once I made my own almond milk by using this bag (delicious by the way - and the bag kept all the pulp out and left us with a smooth and silky almond milk that the whole family enjoyed!  I am looking forward to using this reusable bag for making different types of juices, too!  We love raspberries, but those seeds are killer!  I think this bag will be fantastic for that.&lt;br /&gt;The bag is very easy to clean and it dried nicely, too.  I look forward to using this for many years to come!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use it, but I love the fact that it is reusable!  I am planning on using it to make almond milk and apple juice!  I will update my review once I make the milk and juice!</li>
    <li> Almond Milk. We&#x27;ve all seen the commercials for it. If you&#x27;re anything like me, your first thought was probably something along the lines of &amp;#34;Huh?&amp;#34; The next question was probably &amp;#34;Milk comes from cows, how exactly do they make it out of almonds?&amp;#34; Third question is probably &amp;#34;I wonder what it tastes like?&amp;#34; Your fourth question was probably &amp;#34;I&#x27;ll bet it&#x27;s expensive.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes I know number four wasn&#x27;t really a question.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now there is an easy way to find the answers to all your questions. The Everyday Kitchen Essentials Nut Milk Bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in case you are wondering, here&#x27;s how it works. Take some almonds and soak them in water for a day. One key point here is to not let them sit for more than a day. The water gets this fuzzy stuff on top that doesn&#x27;t look super appetizing. I think they call it mold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, after the almonds have soaked for up to but not more than a day, you drain off the water, and blend them up in a blender with some fresh water. Then you pour all that into the nut milk bag inside of a large bowl. Squeeze it out and you have fresh almond milk. Add in some natural sweetener like maple syrup and a little cinnamon and you have a tasty milk replacement. It&#x27;s a lot healthier and tastes a lot like regular milk. Yum!</li>
    <li> Far better than cheesecloth! I had never made almond milk before, but this made for an easy process. Was thinking apple juice, and pressing cheese when I got the bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s strong, a finely woven nylon with double stitching along the seams and a rope cinch for closing. Claimed to be BPA free. It cleaned easily between batches just by hand (though you could launder or dishwasher it).</li>
    <li> Easy to use, easy to clean, great price.  Made perfect nut milk. Very happy with product.  Just what I wanted, needed, and expected.</li>
    <li> Love it!! It&#x27;s made life so much easier! I even began using the recipe for almond milk from the free recipe book. It&#x27;s delicious!</li>
    <li> I was used to compare the several products.&lt;br /&gt;This product is a product of so-so.</li>
    <li> This a great alternative to cheese cloth! It is strong and durable. It held up to all the squeezing and twisting and turning that I could dish out. I used it to juice blackberries, which have tiny seeds. It worked great! The seeds did not get through and I did not have to worry about ripping the bag and having to start over. Clean up was a breeze also. It did require a drop of bleach but it came clean and is ready for the next use. A definite plus for jammers and juicers. I received this product for a fair and honest review.</li>
    <li> I have been making almond milk for my lactose-intolerant daughter for a couple of years. I have always strained the milk through a cheese cloth. It worked, but was messy and tedious and the cheese cloth could only be used a couple of times before it had to be replaced. Frequently the pulp would also squirt out when I went to squeeze it. This bag makes it SO much easier to make the almond milk! The nylon is very thick and will hold up for quite a while, I am sure. I have yet to have any little holes where the pulp comes out. I just set the bag in a pitcher, pour ALL of the milk in (I used to have to strain the milk in 3-4 batches), squeeze and done!</li>
    <li> Okay - my use of this bag is a little different that its intended use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live out in the boonies and I have fruit trees and berry bushes that produce lots of great tasting fruits that also make great flavored liqueurs. I like to turn ripe fruit into liqueurs that I then use for mixing interesting cocktails for friends and family who come to visit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Typically, you pick your fruit and put it into a jar and then cover with your booze of choice - like vodka or brandy - let is sit for some time, and then strain the fruity muck through cheesecloth or coffee filters to get a clear end product. I have problems with coffee filters in that it takes forever to filter the fruit from the booze as the pulpy fruit blocks passage of the booze into the end result bottle. Cheesecloth works a little better but passes smaller particles of fruit to the booze so it is thicker and not clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I saw the nut bags on Amazon, I got to thinking that this product may solve my problem for good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, here is my setup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I have a gallon glass tea container with a spigot at the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;- I pour a 1 liter bottle of vodka into the jar.&lt;br /&gt;- Pick a gob of ripe blackberries from my patch and fill the nut bag about 3/4 full.&lt;br /&gt;- Drop the filled nut bag into the top of the jar, spread the open top of the nut bag over the jar top and screw the lid over the top of the jar/nutbag top so that the nutbag is suspended in the vodka.&lt;br /&gt;- Shake and set the jar in a cool dark place - like the basement.&lt;br /&gt;- Every couple of days, shake the jar.&lt;br /&gt;- After a week or two, take the lid off the jar, pull the nutbag our and squeeze the bag back into the jar to get any juices left in the bag into the liquid gold in the jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What you have left in the nut bag are the seeds and garp you don&#x27;t want in your liqueur. Add sugar to the jar and taste via a shot glass under the spigot. When you get your desired sweetness, use the spigot on the jar to fill empty bottles to store in your bar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This turned out to be a very sturdy strainer. I squeezed as hard as I could with my hands (messy but kinda fun) and the bag held up just fine.  When done, I just turned the bag inside out to dump the fruit garp into the garbage. It does leave a dark stain on the bag which fades quite a bit when you just wash it under cold water. I tried putting some bleach in the sink with cold water and letting the nutbag sit for a while and then helped lighten the stain, but not get rid of it completely. I just look at it as battle scars and a reminder of the tasty contents the bag held when fulfilling its purpose of producing liquid gold for my liqueur cabinet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also worked fine for fresh peaches and making a peach liqueur. So, you can add this capability as another use for this terrific product.very sturdy strainer. I squeezed as hard as I could with my hands (messy but kinda fun) and the bag held up just fine.  When done, I just turned the bag inside out to dump the fruit garp into the garbage. It does leave a dark stain on the bag which fades quite a bit when you just wash it under cold water.

    <li> Great if you make coconut milk or almond milk.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally make nut milk, but I do make jelly and wine and liqueurs from scratch. And I usually will put a coffee filter in a wire mesh strainer to catch the solids and strain the juice. That is not the most wonderful way in which to do this, but it&#x27;s what I had.&lt;br /&gt;The Nut Milk Bag, while wonderful for making almond milk and the like, is even better for those of us who make small batches of jelly and wine. The shape of this bag allows the juice from my prepared fruit to drip perfectly in to whatever bowl, bucket, or measuring device that I choose. I&#x27;ve even read that people are using it to help finish off their product when making yogurt. I have always wanted to make that so now I may just try it with my nutbag. It&#x27;s easy to empty, and it&#x27;s perfectly washable in a little warm soapy water, so I can use it over and over. This is a handy straining bag, and it holds a pretty decent amount as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided by vendor.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly, works great. Makes excellent almond milk!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it for almonds or making almond milk but it is perfect for straining pineapple tidbits and crushed pineapple being much better than any colander.  Easy to clean by simply turning inside out and washing off and hanging on hook to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a free Nut Milk Bag for my review.</li>
    <li> (Disclaimer - My wife and I were invited by the seller to try and review their products. I only agree to these requests when it&#x27;s something we would actually use. The fact we received them for free has no bearing on our review, and we have written negative reviews in the past for products we were sent for free. Also, for this type of invited review, I always begin with a disclaimer.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bag is more stiff than the typical gauzy straining bags. That stiffness makes it easier to clean than the softer ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared the wire strainer that comes with the soy milk maker we have, this bag does a far better job. The resulting milk strained by the bag (using soy beans and various nuts) is significantly smoother, without any residue that would irritate the throat when drinking. We actually made two cups, one using the wire strainer, and one using the Nut Milk Bag, and then taste-tested both. Absolutely no comparison at all--the bag wins hands down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We highly recommend this to anyone who dislikes drinking stuff that has powdery or gritty residue left from using inferior strainers. You will get a really smooth and clean liquid with this bag.</li>
    <li> This is the first nut milk bag I&#x27;ve used so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to. It is long in length which was easy to squeeze. Also easy to clean. I compared my homemade milk to the 365 organic unsweetened &amp; the homemade is soooo much better!</li>
    <li> Prompt on delivery and awesome product.</li>
    <li> Large size seems to be well made.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used cheesecloth bags for years for draining the whey from yogurt, butter and soft cheeses. Sometimes the holes were a little big and a little more escaped the bag than I wanted. I&#x27;ve also used cheesecloth to strain the seeds out of strawberries, blackberries and blueberries when making jam. And I&#x27;ve used cheesecloth to steep elderberries when making syrup. Cheesecloth can get stained, sometimes has seeds stick to the cotton, and sometimes doesn&#x27;t stay together when washed by hand or in the washing machine so I most often tossed it out. When I had the opportunity to test and review a complimentary Everyday Kitchen Essentials Nut Milk Bag, I was excited to try something with smaller holes and something that would hold up to repeated uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with this product - it&#x27;s made draining and straining foods more efficient, and I don&#x27;t lose any of the curds or yogurt I&#x27;m trying to keep. It also washes up perfectly and so far I haven&#x27;t had any staining. I turn it inside out and rinse off seeds with very little effort. It has a little drawstring at the top, which is useful for securing the bag to the top of a container or stand, so it doesn&#x27;t slip off. It&#x27;s also pretty big - 10 inches wide at the top, and about a foot tall a the tallest part. The seams are securely sewn, so nothing can escape!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My next new project will be trying my hand at making nut milks, and I look forward to using this bag in place of cheesecloth!</li>
    <li> Although this product is marketed as designed so the consumer can make milk from nuts at home, it&#x27;s actually useful for many more purposes.  Of course, it&#x27;s great for straining the solids out of processed nuts, but it&#x27;s wonderful for separating the Wheaton yogurt and soft cheeses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it for draining tomatoes and cucumbers for summer salads, and for rinsing berries.  The mesh is very fine, and you won&#x27;t lose any pulp.  It&#x27;s easy to clean; just turn it inside out and wash by hand.  I like the drawstring.  It&#x27;s generous, and I can hang the bag on my pot rack to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to sprout beans and alfalfa.  The bag can be used for this, also.  It&#x27;s ideal for thorough rinsing, and it&#x27;s sheer enough to see at what stage the sprouts are in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bag is way more efficient than cheesecloth, and I&#x27;m happy to have it.  I was provided a sample for review.</li>
    <li> Used this for the first time tonight! My husband was afraid this was going to burst as he was squeezing it to get all the milk out of the almonds, but it held up great! It was such a cinch to clean, too.</li>
    <li> Though this Nut Milk Bag is meant to be used to create your own nut milk, I instead use mine as a fruit juicer... and I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love nothing more than to have a cup of freshly squeezed orange juice, however I don&#x27;t like the pulp. Instead of spending a arm and a leg for a juicer, this nut milk bag does the trick! I simply take whatever fruit I want to juice, peel it if necessary, and pop a few pieces in the bag and squeeze. If I have quite a few pieces of fruit in the bag, I find using a rolling pin to work great at extracting all of the juice, and the bag collects all the pulp. Simple, easy, and only takes a few minutes to have freshly squeezed juice! Cleaning up is a breeze. I just wipe out the inside of the bag, and pop the bag into some warm water with dish soap. Lightly wash, and hang it up to dry. Super easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bag is a lot larger than most other nut milk bags I have seen on the market, which is fantastic. Some of the other bags are less than half the size of this one, at the same cost! This bag comes in handy so much. I&#x27;ve used mine for juicing, and straining out tofu. I am positive that you could find many different uses for it in your home!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
    <li> I switched to almond milk for my afternoon smoothies more than a year ago. I needed substitute for cow’s milk that was lower in calories, fat, and especially sugar. In short, I needed a diabetic friendly alternative and there were lots of coupons for almond milk back then. Easy as that, almond milk became a household staple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, like most commercial dairy products, almond milk still contains some preservatives, added sweeteners, and even artificial flavors. While it is still a better choice for me than cow’s milk, it still contains some extras I would rather do without and I recently found out that I actually can! I can make my own almond milk at home! The process is so simple that I can’t believe I have never tried homemade almond milk before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two most important factors in making homemade almond milk are fresh raw almonds and a quality milk nut bag. I found fresh raw almonds at Winn Dixie on sale for 2 cups for $4.00. This is enough to make about 2 quarts of almond milk. Everyday Kitchen Essentials was kind enough to send me their premium nylon nut milk bag to evaluate in this experiment. It is so durable that there is almost no chance of the bag tearing and comes with a handy drawstring to keep nuts in while squeezing out the milk. It is also the largest nut milk bag I&#x27;ve found to date.It easily drapes over the sides of a bowl to make the straining process a much easier one person job. Once done straining my freshly made almond milk I simply turned the bag inside out, shook off the almond pulp, and rinsed the bag clean. An hour or so propped in my dish drainer and the bag looked like new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can imagine so many jobs for this sturdy bag. HIGHLY recommended for any kitchen tool connoisseur.</li>
    <li> Works lovely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to make your own almond milk at home this is a great fine mesh bag for accomplishing just that.  I was very pleased with the quality of the material and seams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are lots of helpful videos on the net on how to make almond milk. Its much cheaper and yummier to make at home.  This will enable you to make it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this bag for over 2 weeks now and I have used it to make coconut milk and to drain excess liquid from vegetables. It is very sturdy, easy to clean and definitely a step above regular cheesecloth!</li>
    <li> The material was extremely hard to handle- it was not flexible and did not fit into a funnel very well. I lost half my lemon juice trying to finagle the product.</li>
    <li> have used it 3 times and works great.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly.  Making almond milk is so much easier with this than any other method.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I have been making nut milks and using various means to strain the solid pieces out. This is a great product and I recommend it wholeheartedly.</li>
    <li> I will admit, when I was asked to review a “nut milk bag”, I had no idea how to obtain the “milk” from almonds – or any other tree nut, for that matter. I grew up on cow’s milk, and to this day I enjoy a creamy glass almost daily. What I do know, however, is how to make homemade jams and jellies. So with that in mind, I agreed to test out the Everyday Essentials Nut Milk Bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Construction&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product description sums up the design of the Everyday Essentials Nut Milk Bag; it is also BPA free and cleans easily. The nylon construction feels durable and the drawstring is rugged enough to withstand being hung from a hook. Finally, the mesh is very fine, but not so tightly woven that it “clogs” (wherein you have to strain small batches at a time or the bag/filter will become “clogged” and begin to overflow, potentially wasting your mixture).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First and foremost, the Everyday Essentials Nut Milk Bag (EENMB) is both durable and a cinch to use as a strainer. Place a bowl underneath it and load the mixture that you wish to strain into the mouth of the bag at the top. You can either allow gravity to do the work and hook the bag over the bowl and walk away or, for a quicker method, tie off the bag and start applying pressure by squeezing (making sure that the liquid hits the desired container, of course – I got a little crazy the first time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy, right? So how well does it work? As I mentioned above, I decided to make jelly with my EENMB and the result was magnificent! To wit:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The mesh of the bag is durable enough to withstand warm liquids without damaging the fabric. This is a key issue for me as taking fruit from a pulpy mess and turning it into a beautiful jar of jelly requires a lot of straining or warm-hot liquids. Which brings me to…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) The EENMB filtered the detritus, including the smallest seeds, thorns, and miscellaneous “goop” (the technical term, you see) from the fruit reduction (the first step to jelly-making, wherein you chuck a bunch of fruit into a pot with some sugar and let it dissolve into a fruit goop, see above) with ease. With the added bonus of being able to squeeze the bag to get the most straining power of the EENMB, the old-fashioned cheesecloth-and-strainer method is a distant memory in my house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) The dimensions of the bag are 10x13in, which doesn’t really tell you the volume. This is plenty large enough to handle 20-30oz of liquid, if not more, of jelly at a time in order to strain the mix before adding the gelatin. This is also large enough to have the mouth of the EENMB open sufficiently to allow room for ladeling and/or pouring contents without having to worry about the mixture spilling everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final Say&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, if you are looking for a durable method of straining liquids to remove even the smallest of detritus, including strawberry and raspberry seeds, blackberry thorns, “scuzz” that forms while canning, and a whole host of other issues, the Everyday Essentials Nut Milk Bag fits the bill. It is better than cheesecloth, has the advantage of being able to seal off to squeeze every last bit of flavor from the contents inside, and cleans up like a charm. This is definitely something to keep on-hand during the busy summer canning season!from the fruit reduction (the first step to jelly-making, wherein you chuck a bunch of fruit into a pot with some sugar and let it dissolve into a fruit goop, see above) with ease.

    <li> I primarily wanted this as a replacement for cheese cloth... so I could reuse it after straining my homemade yogurt to make Greek yogurt.  It works PERFECT for that; it&#x27;s large enough that I can put quite a bit into it, it strains quickly but somehow leaves the yogurt portion inside the bag in spite of the speed.  It&#x27;s also super easy to clean; I just squeezed all the yogurt into a bowl and then rinsed the bag and wiped it down with a soapy rag like I would a plate and it cleaned that easily... literally only took me 10 seconds.  It&#x27;s perfect!  Well made, dries quick, will last forever!  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Its just the right size and does a great job for its intended use I have made two quarts already and they came out great.</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  Makes almond milk much creamier and smoother, not to mention the great taste of home made almond milk.  Clean up is easy enough as well  and it&#x27;s great that it is reusable.</li>
    <li> Very impressive little bag.  I finally made my own almond milk by following the instructions on the Homemade website and it was so easy.  Just soak one cup of almonds in 4 cups of water over night with some sweetener(I used sugar, and one teaspoon was not enough).  I then blended it and strained it through my Nut Milk Bag it it strained at a rate that was so quick it was almost as if there were no crushed nuts in the bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I finished, there were not pieces of almond in my milk, and rinsing the bag was as easy as turning it inside out.  There were no corners for anything to get caught in and now my bag is back to perfect.  It dried quickly too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was tempted to run a bottle of wine through the bag to get the sediment out, but I was afraid I&#x27;d stain the bag.  It still might happen in the future.</li>
    <li> I was quite happy with this nut bag. I haven&#x27;t gotten around to making almond milk yet with it but i can tell it will work great for it. It&#x27;s a great size. Much bigger than my other one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this to make zucchini bread from farm fresh zucchini. One of the challenges to a good fresh zucchini bread with lots of zucchini flavor is to get the water out of zucchini and not into the bread making it dense and soggy. This was able to squeeze a ton of water out while leaving the pulp in tact! I was very pleased with the results. If you are going to make any baked goods from fresh veges ie. Pumpkin, zucchini, squash etc. This bag is indispensable!  Definitely grab one.</li>
    <li> Great product, great customer service!</li>
    <li> I never knew how easy it would be to make my own Almond Milk. This is an excellent product and great value. I will recommend it to all my friends!</li>
    <li> Love this! Works so well, I use it for much more than just nuts.</li>
    <li> I have yet to make almond milk with this product but I do  use it for rinsing fruits like cherries, strawberries, and blueberries. It&#x27;s much easier to clean it in here, let it dry, and then store in my tupperware containers. The bag is very well made. Double stitched all around and the mesh is a very durable material. One day, I&#x27;ll make almond milk. Based on the other reviews who do use this bag for that purpose, I look forward to my own experience with the bag.</li>
    <li> Great quality nut bag! I have to confess that I use this bag for dyeing with plant materials rather than for making nut milk, but the bag is well made, lasts a long time and works perfectly.</li>
    <li> I am so excited to no longer have to buy cheesecloth!  great customer service, too.</li>
    <li> everything went smoothly</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the bag to successfully strain coconut milk, carrot juice, yogurt, and coffee. The bag is sturdy and seems a very good product.</li>
    <li> Good quality straining bag. Did not feel like it would break even when twisting tightly. Price is right and quality is there. Customer servicwakes sure you&#x27;re satisfied with the product too.</li>
    <li> I got my nut milk bag and use it and it was fantastic!!</li>
    <li> This is a great nut milk bag!!  Makes nut milk making a breeze!!</li>
    <li> I had trouble getting my rice milk to come out nice and smooth (I use raw rice flour, and there would be a lot of gritty bits left behind after filtering.) This bag solved my problem. The fine mesh in this bag doesn&#x27;t let any grit though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also: It&#x27;s easy to hand-wash. Sediment rinses right out, and if you need to use a bit of dishwashing detergent, that rinses out completely as well. Hang it to dry and it will be ready again in no time.</li>
    <li> This is a very versatile mesh bag that will easily become indespensible in and active kitchen. Not only is this large and tough hombre good for making almond and other nut milk, it easily strains veggies and salad and is helpful making fruit and vegetable juices too. And I&#x27;m sure that just scratches the surface. The nylon weave is tough, and I&#x27;ve yet to make a hole or widen the very fine weave. Cleanup is easy as well. Kudos to the manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a complimentary sample for review purposes and was pleasantly surprised at how versatile and stury this product actually is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Kort</li>
    <li> Very helpful and responsive seller. Nut bag is well made and durable.</li>
    <li> I use it for making coconut milk with my blender and it works like a charm. Very thick material, great for hand squeezing...</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly as was exactly as described. So far I&#x27;ve used it for making both almond milk and vegetable juice.  Very please.</li>
    <li> Seems sturdy and works well.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this yet, but the quality is good. Will use soon.</li>
    <li> This is a nice large capacity, and quality made.</li>
    <li> This is a great nut milk bag. I&#x27;ve already used it to make oat milk and rice milk. I&#x27;m going to use it to make ricotta cheese next. It&#x27;s sturdy, the perfect size; and clean up is easy! Thanks for a great product!</li>
    <li> This is great in making things like a stew where make a herb bag but don&#x27;t want the herbs in the stew! I love it</li>
    <li> Arrived promptly and works great!</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Made almond milk and it worked great.  And the shipping was very quick.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality and fast shipping.  Thanks for the superior product.</li>
    <li> Great product at an excellent price!  It is well made and very sturdy.  I am very pleased!</li>
    <li> Great bag and very fast shipping. I would recommend this item for anyone with a Vita Mix</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;It works! It&#x27;s very well made and the material is really strong. I was able to really wring out the almond milk without any pulp squeezing thru. Also easy to clean and nice big size. Great product! &amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so excited I purchased this nut milk bag. I have been able to make homemade almond milk twice since I purchased it. I love being able to control the ingredients and make sure there are no chemicals or preservatives in my almond milk.</li>
    <li> This awesome bag is a good size, well made, sturdy enough to hold up to whatever I might want to strain though it. It washed easily and dried quickly.</li>
    <li> I LOVE the nut bag!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought a couple of more for my friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We make a fruited vinegar drink (also known as shrub) to take to summer Civil War reenactments.  Straining the fruit through cheese cloth is always tedious and takes quite a bit of time (and a lot of cheese cloth). During the straining with cheesecloth, the cheesecloth would always fall apart and it was truly a mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nut bag is perfect for this! It rinsed easily, even with raspberry, and strawberry seeds! :-)  I have never thought of anything like this and only came upon it after I purchased my Vitamix and saw this product advertised on the Blender Lady Vitamix Facebook page.  My first purchase was made when the second coupon came out and more when the price was dropped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shrub recipe, if you would like to try it! :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Equal parts  Fruit, Vinegar, and sugar (or honey)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soak the fruit in apple cider vinegar (cider vinegar with the Mother is best)  for up to a week, but at least 24 hours. Strain into a bowl and place the fruits in a cheese cloth. Squeeze the fruit over the bowl until all the juice has strained into the bowl and you have dry pulp. Add the sugar or honey and stir well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You now have a syrup. Fill a glass with ice and add syrup to the quarter mark, then fill the rest with water. (you can add more syrup if you would like)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s refreshing and a nice pick me up for a hot summer day.</li>
    <li> I love it.  Easy to use and to clean.  I use mine for yogurt and it works great.  I used cheesecloth before and it was such a mess I ended up tossing it in the trash but this bag  works so well I plan to order another one.</li>
    <li> Excellent nut milk bag.  In fact, it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve used.  It does a great job straining nut milk, but works just as well for straining whole food juices, like carrot juice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bag is very roomy, and I really like the rounded corners, they help make the bag easy to clean, and it dries quickly as well.</li>
    <li> Sometimes it is the simple things in life that contribute the most to our pleasure. This nut milk bag is neither pretentious nor complicated, rather just exactly what it claims to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nylon mesh is very fine so that not only does it do a superb job straining, but it is easier to clean. The rounded bottom keeps any bits from getting stuck in corners. The seams are durably chain-stitched and serged and the drawstring cinches tightly, yet is easy to release. I know of no better nut milk bag on the market today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it is not restricted solely to being a nut milk bag and is useful for so many other things. It is handy for rinsing greens, grapes, or berries, for storing onions or garlic, and for straining just about anything if a fine mesh is required. It can be reused almost indefinitely if kept away from open flames.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyday Kitchen Essentials provided a nut milk bag for evaluation and review.</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised, this bag washes and is reusable. I&#x27;ve made almond milk twice now and it&#x27;s great. No grit!</li>
    <li> I received my nut milk bag.  I haven&#x27;t gotten out to buy any nuts yet.  The look and construction look great.</li>
    <li> This bag is the best way to strain anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know this bag is sold as a \\&quot;Nut Milk Bag\\&quot;, which it does a great job at. Also, this bag has multiple uses in the kitchen to filter whatever you need. I am a fan of loose tea, which is not the easiest thing to work with. Since having this bag I have been able to make more than a few cups of my favorite tea with ease. After my pot of tea is cooled, I use this bag to filter the small bits of tea and end up with a pitcher full of goodness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the hand it is almost weightless, yet strong. The entire bag is made of nylon, which does not stain. The screen size is big enough to let liquid move freely, while catching debris. Cleanup is very simple, just turn inside out and hand wash with warm soapy water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best feature is the sewn edges, this means the bag will not fray and all apart after repeated use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was supplied a sample for the purpose of review.</li>
    <li> One of the best Nut Milk bags I have used! I make my own almond milk and use the strained almonds to make almond flour. The milk runs through quickly and is easy to handle when I need to squeeze it. The bag is durable! I look forward to making different nut milks with this bag.</li>
    <li> I was really impressed with the quality and ease of use. The material it is made out of is sturdy and doesn&#x27;t tear or rip with use. I squeezed my almonds till there was nothing but powder and all the milk was in the cup. And it was ONLY milk, no grain or mushy stuff made it through. It&#x27;s also large enough to hold everything I needed it to. It was perfect for this first time nut milker. Not to mention, clean up was a breeze. I just turned it inside out and washed it off.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent nut bag. It is very stain resistant and also very sturdy. I made carrot juice with my Vitamix and it did the job very well. It is one of the strongest bags I have use and I think it is nylon so the carrots didn&#x27;t stain the bag. Very good nut bag I would recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> This is just what you need to make nut milk, and anything else in your kitchen that has to be strained!</li>
    <li> Love it!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to order another one just for rinsing rice, and quinoa.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product!</li>
    <li> Love the milk bag.  It works great and cleans up so easy!</li>
    <li> I love this nut bag so much I ordered an additional one for my sister. Hands down the best one on the market!</li>
    <li> I love it, but used it and the first time it is now stained...</li>
    <li> THE PROCESS:&lt;br /&gt;1. Soaked 1-cup almonds overnight.&lt;br /&gt;2. Strained/drained.&lt;br /&gt;3. Put in blender with 4-cups filtered water and blend for 3-5minutes&lt;br /&gt;4. Poured into this nut milk bag and worked at it hard for a good 5-minutes, trying to get every drop of moisture.&lt;br /&gt;5. Put milk back in blender and added sweetener, cinnamon, salt and cocoa.&lt;br /&gt;6. Put in fridge to chill&lt;br /&gt;7. Dried and stored leftover almond meal (see below)&lt;br /&gt;8. Turned bag inside-out and it cleaned with ease!&lt;br /&gt;9. After chilling, stir before serving &#x3D; YUMMY!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE MATH:&lt;br /&gt;In the end I got about 48oz. for my 1 cup of almonds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our family spends easily $3 per 64oz (1/2 gal) container of pre-made almond milk from the supermarket and we buy three of them each week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One(1) pound almonds is a little over 3-cups almonds.&lt;br /&gt;I can get 1-pound of almonds at Costco for about $6.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thus, with nut milk bag, each week I&#x27;m saving almost $3 ($10-$12/month &#x3D; helps with Netflix bill!) AND I get to control whatever extra ingredients I want to put into it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLUS, I get the almond meal leftovers (dry it in the oven, then store it in the fridge), which is expensive at about $10/pound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if adding in the almond meal usage, the savings more than pays for this nut milk bag AND I have almond meal to put in cereal, yogurt, as a crumble on muffins/pies or when I get enough I can use it as a flour substitute for all kinds of baked goods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My man hands were squeezing hard on the almond meal, but the nut milk bag held well under the pressure. Almond milk would seep out everywhere, but none of the meal came out in to the mix. We only got milk in the bowl. Nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL:&lt;br /&gt;Great product. I&#x27;m looking forward to trying to make other things with it, such as:&lt;br /&gt;+ Sauces&lt;br /&gt;+ Sprouting&lt;br /&gt;+ Juicing&lt;br /&gt;+ Teas&lt;br /&gt;+ Cheese&lt;br /&gt;+ hops bag for home brewing&lt;br /&gt;+ remove excess water from tomato sauce for lasagna&lt;br /&gt;+ the possibilities seem endless. . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received this product free or at a discounted price, in exchange for the purposes of a product review.

    <li> Prompt shipping, love the product.</li>
    <li> Works so much better than straining through cheese cloth.</li>
    <li> I shared the Nut Milk Bag by Everyday Kitchen Essentials with my friend&#x27;s high school age budding chef and we made almond milk together.  He had so much fun and was delighted with the results when he made the almond milk for a recipe he wanted to make.  We live in a rural area and he had not found a place to purchase almond milk locally, so he was most pleased with being able to make it from scratch.  I made a gift of the Nut Milk Bag to him when he promised to make me almond milk whenever I needed any for cooking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only concern was that we had to go online for instructions, so anyone receiving one of these as a gift without Internet access would have a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My budding chef and I thank Everyday Kitchen Essentials for the product to use and review.  This review reflects our experience.</li>
    <li> Nut Milk Bag not just for Nut Milk. There has been so many food alerts and recalls lately, I&#x27;ve been trying to wash our fruit really well. I&#x27;ve been using a strainer to put the fruit in and using my hands to pull the fruit from the bottom to the top. Well, this nut bag has made the process a lot simpler and I feel, way better. I can toss in our blueberries, grapes or what ever smaller fruits we buy. I can wash the fruit through the bag. I don&#x27;t have to mush up the fruit with my hands, like I wound up doing with a colander or strainer. The bag is really well made and holds up really well to my soaking and washing. It&#x27;s a heavy weight, nylon mess. Wish I had a bag like this when I use to wear hose. It would be great for putting the hose in when washing in the washing machine.  It&#x27;s got a life time money back guarantee, what more can you ask for. Gee, I night even try making nut mike with it! BTW, this is a great bag for straining cold brewed coffee.</li>
    <li> I was admittedly skeptical when I was asked if I would like to receive a copy of this product in order to post a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The truth was, I had never considered doing anything like this. When it arrived, I was at first confused because there are no actual directions, so it assumes that I knew what I was doing (nope!). However, they had a website right in the packing label and I was all set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have nothing to compare it to except going to the store and buying some almond milk and then comparing. It reminded me of the first time I had eggs from my own chickens. How I would ever be able to use store bought is beyond me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you DO know what you are doing, you will be happy with this, but if you are a newbie like me, DON&#x27;T BE SCARED. It is not as hard as you think.</li>
    <li> This is my first nut milk bag I&#x27;ve ever purchased and I did so because of the high reviews. I like it but if feel like if the fabric allowed just a smidge more room, I could get more of that excess delicious creaminess. I feel like more could have been squeezed out :/</li>
    <li> I’m comparing this nut milk bag to the Amazing Nut Milk brand Bag to make the review more useful.  In the past I used cheese cloth and although it works, it’s messy.  Nut milk bags make the process so much easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Kitchen Essential nut milk bag has a very fine weave which would makes it an excellent strainer for greek yogurt.&lt;br /&gt;I liked both nut milk bags but the Kitchen Essentials is easier to clean.  The Amazing Nut Milk bag was easier to squeeze, because the Kitchen Essentials fabric is a bit stiffer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish they made a smaller size because to make yogurt, it would be easier if you could hang it up over your sink but the bag is so long, you can’t hang it by the string.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have to say I prefer the Kitchen Essentials Nut Milk bag, just because it’s easier to clean.  I compared the amount of milk I got from each bag and the amounts were equal.</li>
    <li> I seriously love this bag!!! This makes making my almond milk so easy. It&#x27;s extremely durable, very easy to clean and dries super fast!! I love it and love making my almond milk!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought this item. This is so much easier than cheesecloth or kitchen towels. I make almond milk about every 3-4 days and this will definitely make it easier and reduce the mess.</li>
    <li> I have owned many nut milk bags and I really just do not like this one. This one is made out of a mesh/plastic type material that makes it very difficult to pull the drawstring closed, so if you are making nut milk the nut puree easily starts to come out the top while you are squeezing it. I also found when I tried to make pecan milk with this bag that it would not come through the bag at all, I never had this problem with any of my prior (square) nut bags that I had purchased off amazon that were more of a cloth like fabric. The positive on this one is because it is more of a mesh like plastic it is easier to clean than my prior nut bags but with that said that is not enough of a positive for me to keep using it so I have put it on the shelf and went back to my old ones as this one is just inconvenient to use. I would recommend using one of the more cloth like square nut bags on amazon.</li>
    <li> I used/bought this bag to make greek yogurt and quark. The end result is perfectly thick , creamy, and rich. So I know it would work great for nutmilk as well- if it strains whey this great, it&#x27;d definitely strain the pulp really well too! My only qualm is the shape and size of the bag. It is impractical for fitting into large pots and cilanders to strain overnight or to leave unwatched in general. Because the bag comes together at one seam, there is no &amp;#34;base&amp;#34; if you will. Ziplock bag as opposed to paper bag if you will. It tipped over at one point, and I ended up lising a lot of my precious yogurt! It was also small so I had to do it in two batches which was annoying (that might be cause I did a whole gallin of milk at once though.) So yeah, if the shape was different and a little bigger (or I had been a little less greedy?) 5/5.</li>
    <li> Sturdy, well made and works just as advertised. Don&#x27;t miss out on the link that comes with the bag to get your pdf book of recipes. I tried out the pistachio milk when the bag first arrived, and all went well. Rinsed out the bag and used it the next morning to make soy milk with dried soybeans I soaked overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another benefit of making your own nut milks is that the nut meal that remains can be used in all kinds of dishes and pastries for added texture and nutrition. The 10 x 13 size (with drawstring closure) is convenient for making both medium and small batches without any problem. Definitely recommended.</li>
    <li> Great, high quality product! I personally use this for making almond milk. I used to use fine strainer but there were always bits of almond meal sneaking into my almond milk! This feels very high-quality and I believe it will hold up through many uses. The size is very large (will hold up to 6 cups of almond meal). This a great product and very versatile, so I highly recommend it for everyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I soak almonds 12-18 hours then place them in boiling water for 2 minutes. The peel just comes right off! Perfect for a gritless leftover almond meal i can use for baking!</li>
    <li> This nut milk bag works exactly the way you&#x27;d expect it to. It is made of a plastic mesh which is perfect for straining the way out of yogurt to make yogurt cheese, or of course for making nut milks. I used it to make tigernut milk recently, and the wonderful thing about the stiff plastic mesh that is used is how easy it is to clean. With previous cloth nut milk bags I had to put them through the washer, which was always kind of weird having a little bit of laundry soap sent on my nut milk bag. This just rinses off with water and sometimes a scrub brush.</li>
    <li> Works great! I made walnut milk with it and the milk turned out super creamy and delicious. Going to make walnut butter out of the leftovers. Mine didn&#x27;t arrive with the instruction manual so I had to Google recipes but other than that, its a great product! Not sure how the best way to clean is...took me a minute to get the gunk out</li>
    <li> Fantastic milk bag.  Have used it for nut milk as well as straining juices and squeezing water out of spinach.  It&#x27;s taken on a yellow green hue from all the spinach but it&#x27;s easy to clean and works wonderfully.</li>
    <li> great nut bag, minimizes pulp significantly. Unbeatable price!</li>
    <li> Ordered (on sale and w a coupon code!) and received promptly. Used it to make almond milk with my vitamix. It is durable and did a great job straining out the pulp. Was easy to clean. Very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Made Almond Milk this morning and used this bag for the first time.  My experience can be summed in one word:&lt;br /&gt;W O N D E R F U L !!!!!&lt;br /&gt;After using this bag, I put my old cloth bag in a plastic bag and placed it in the pantry (will likely not be used ever again).&lt;br /&gt;The nylon bag is much better than my cloth bag.  It is:&lt;br /&gt;Easier to wash and rinse&lt;br /&gt;Dries faster&lt;br /&gt;Nut milk strains faster&lt;br /&gt;Nut meal does not cling to the bag&lt;br /&gt;These differences are not subtle...they capture your attention.&lt;br /&gt;No discernable difference in taste or consistency of Almond Milk vs cloth bag.&lt;br /&gt;I think we have a real winner here.</li>
    <li> .I received my nutmilk shortly after the order was placed. It works great I am very happy to have purchased this bag. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I received the nut bag to make almond milk, but ended up using it this week to make relish.  Squeezing the liquid out of the veggies before cooking was a breeze.  I read that some have had trouble with the seams.  A sewing machine should take care of that problem.  I&#x27;m very glad I got this!</li>
    <li> I love to make milk from different nuts and seeds especially coconut. So I was happy to review this nut milk bag that I received for free to review. This bag is great to strain out any pulp so that my beverage is very smooth and refreshing. It is sturdy and durable. The drawstring and rounded corners are a big plus. You can tell that Everyday Kitchen Essentials has had tons of experience making nut milk and designed the best bag ever!</li>
    <li> Great product, fast shipping, great quality... perfect to go along with my vitamixer! !</li>
    <li> Overall the nut bag was super easy to use and did a great job keeping the nut mess out of our milk. The only thing was that I didn&#x27;t know how to wash it??? I rinsed under sink water then put in a bowl to soak and laid out to dry. I doubt we&#x27;ll be making our own almond milk on a regular basis but it was still a fun activity and something we&#x27;d do on special occasions.</li>
    <li> I love nut milk (like almond milk, etc) and when I got my Nut Milk bag from Kitchen Essentials, I expected to use it on making nut milk, but little did I know you can use it for so many tasks!! It filters wonderfully and is an impressive size. I used it to dust cacao powder on toast, to make my own almond milk perfection, and to filter out some matcha tea that was a bit too grainy at first. I like the idea of using these for loose leaf tea on trips, as well, because they can be transported easier than you can others. It folds up nice and easy.&lt;br /&gt;You can even clean it in your dishwasher. How awesome is that?&lt;br /&gt;If you love making healthy foods, this needs to be in your kitchen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one for free to facilitate review, but my opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> This bag was perfect for making homemade almond milk.  The fabric is durable and held up to the job, without allowing little pieces of almond to sneak into my milk.  I do wish it had a wider opening at the top, so that it could be laid over a bowl for easier straining.  The bag is strong and reusable and would recommend it highly to anyone wanting to make their own milks at home!</li>
    <li> Right away I noticed it was made from a premium nylon fabric which was sure to hold more than the average cheese cloth or cheaply made milk bags.  I love the drawstring which makes it easy to lift anything, keeping it all together.  I&#x27;ve been using this for a variety of tasks not just straining either!  And best of all I was able to clean this easy as running it through soapy water and tossing it on my drying rack.&lt;br /&gt;Read more at http://www.aluckyladybug.com/2014/08/nut-milk-bag-from-everyday-kitchen.html#aesMeXBe7LOfiseq.99</li>
    <li> This is a great nut milk bag!!</li>
    <li> This bag is ideal as a strainer for making nut milk and juices. It has just the right porousness to do the job and it can be washed and reused for a long time. It is made from a nylon material that should hold up fairly well. If you need a strainer bag for making milks and juices this seems to be an ideal option. This item was provided to me by the manufacturer at no cost for review.</li>
    <li> This bag is easy to use and clean.  It is useful for making nut milk and probably a lot of other things.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes of making my own almond milk, but I haven&#x27;t gotten the ambition to actually do so yet. I decided to use this as a strainer for my loose tea. It works great. It gets out all the little bits that my other strainers miss.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this bag. It definitely seemed like it would be more convenient than cheese cloth when making almond milk. Unfortunately when I squeeze the liquid out, it appears that some of the almond grit comes through the bag as well. This does not happen when I use 4 layers of cheese cloth. I use my Vitamix to blend the almonds, so the almonds get very fine. Anyway, thanks to this bag, my almond milk is now gritty. I&#x27;ll be going back to cheese cloth. If you don&#x27;t mind little bits of almond in your almond milk, then this is not a bad product and clean up is easy.</li>
    <li> Nut Bag Love along with great communication!</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted and arrived on time.</li>
    <li> This bag is a great thing to have in your kitchen because you can use it for so many things.  My daughter- in- law soaked a bunch of almonds for 24 hours, mixed them up in the blender, then poured the liquid paste into this nut bag and it did a wonderful job of straining the milk out and leaving the pulp behind.  Since our grandson drinks almond milk and he especially likes it when it&#x27;s fresh, this is a great find.  You can also use it after blending fruit for a wonderful smoothie if you don&#x27;t like the pulp that can go along with it.  You can use it over and over and it&#x27;s easy to clean.  It didn&#x27;t come with instructions how to clean it, but a little common sense plus some dish soap and water did the job and there are other recipes and ideas on how to use it on Everyday Kitchen Essentials&#x27; website.  Five stars for the Nut Milk Bag.**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I was asked to use this product and then write an honest opinion in an effort to help consumers make a more informed purchase decision.  The above review is my honest opinion and no other form of compensation took place.</li>
    <li> I had the opportunity to review Everyday Kitchen Essentials Nut Milk Bag. I have to admit, I had never heard of a Nut Milk Bag&lt;br /&gt;before. I have purchased almond milk, but never once thought of making my own almond milk. But, now I can say that I have done just that, and it is delicious!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Nut Milk Bag is a strong nylon mesh bag. It comes packaged in a plastic wrapper so it is protected. Once you open the bag, I recommend rinsing it out before use. This nut milk bag can be used many times over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went ahead and made my own almond milk using raw almonds I already had in my pantry.  You can get the recipe to make your own almond milk by going to the website provided with your Nut Milk Bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I set the almond milk in the fridge to chill, I started cleaning up. Aside from setting the blender pitcher in the dishwasher,&lt;br /&gt;I just had to wash and rinse out the Nut Milk Bag. I wasn&#x27;t sure how quickly this process would go, but I was pleasantly surprised by how easy it was to clean up. This entire process of making the almond milk and cleaning up took just 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;Frankly, it takes me longer to drive to the grocery store to buy almond milk, than it did for me to actually make it.&lt;br /&gt;The bag cleaned up really quickly and I just propped it in my dish drainer to dry for the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The almond milk was creamy and delicious without any pulp or shell from the almonds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other uses for the Nut Milk Bag include straining quinoa before cooking, straining juices when canning or making broth, and for use in making yogurts or cheeses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you normally use a cheese cloth for straining, I highly recommend using the Every Day Kitchen Essentials Nut Milk Bag&lt;br /&gt;for ease of use, durability, and quick cleaning.</li>
    <li> Even though, I love soy milk, but I don&#x27;t make Nut Milk at home. It&#x27;s just easy to buy from the store than making it at home. The product name says \\&quot;nut milk bag\\&quot;, but this types of bag can be used for different application other than making Nut Milk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this bag to be very useful in my kitchen.  I am making cabbage juice every single day (it&#x27;s for Stomach Ulcer and one of my family member has it). If anyone make Cabbage juice will know it is almost impossible to get the juice out of it and adding water using juicer is not going to work.  If you are using blender like Vitamix, which I am using it to make this Cabbage drink, you still have to add good amount of water and it still so thick and so much, it is hard to get it down.&lt;br /&gt;So, I am using this bag to get the liquid after grind cabbage with Vitamix. Pour it into this bag, squeeze it and you can get the liquid without the fiber.  It&#x27;s so easy to drink cabbage juice now.  Other application for this bag that I&#x27;ve used when my 2 years old niece came to stay with me for few days recently.  She want some carrot juice.  Well, I don&#x27;t own a juicer and I didn&#x27;t have any carrot juice.  So, I used my Vitamix to grind carrots and pour it into this bag and squeeze the juice out of it.  It&#x27;s easy to use, easy to clean, re-usable.  Great buy.</li>
    <li> i love, love, love my new nut milk bag! Gone are the days trying to make my nut milks with cheese cloth!This bag is of great quality and is very sturdy. Rinses out very easily. Love it. Will also use it to strain my berries for jelly and raspberry juice.</li>
    <li> The Nut Milk Bag by Everyday Kitchen Essentials is a wonderful tool that should be in every kitchen. Although made for making Nut Milk, this durable bag makes a fantastic strainer for jellies, herbal infusions, juices, etc. and is fine enough to strain yogurt to make yogurt cream cheese! I&#x27;ve used it a lot since I received it and cannot sing its praises enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nylon material is strong and allows for squeezing without ripping. I love the drawstring top. It makes keeping things in so much easier than having to band and hope the band holds. I will say that if you do use this for juices and jellies, you may find it stains and won&#x27;t look as pretty as the day you purchased it BUT that won&#x27;t affect how the product works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use, easy to clean and with a lifetime guarantee - you really can&#x27;t go wrong with the BRAND NEW Nut Milk Bag by Everyday Kitchen Essentials.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received a sample bag for testing purposes. I was not required to post any positive feedback about the outcome of using this bag.</li>
