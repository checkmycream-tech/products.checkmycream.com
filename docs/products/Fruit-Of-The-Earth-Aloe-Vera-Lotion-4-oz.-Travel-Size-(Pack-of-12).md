    <li> used this lotion on holiday in florida the last four times been on my hols always bought bottles back with me  but managed to run out before our next visit so was ecstatic when found could order  this on line,this is the only cream found that helps  stop the my skin breaking out in rashes and keeps  my condition  under control.</li>
    <li> The lotion is wonderful.  Feels great under makeup and as a daytime and nighttime, or anytime lotion.  The only problem encountered was the packaging.  The lids were either not on tight to start with, or they jiggled loose during shipping, either way, there was lotion to clean up, and some wasted.  If only they could have been shrink wrapped, the problem would have been avoided.</li>
    <li> My daughter absolutely loves this lotion --- light, and it disappears on the skin. The travel size is good-sized and packaged by the &#x27;dozen&#x27; -- was a good idea; she has one in purse, one in bedroom, one at work, one in the car ------ well you get the idea; the larger size would be simply in one place :-(</li>
    <li> I was a big fan of this product. But the last order... there was a weird smell. Hard to describe. Just unbearable... I don&#x27;t know if a new smelly ingredient was added or I was just unlucky to receive spoiled one. Too bad... I really loved it. So, be aware, in case you are thinking of ordering this, the smell... repellent.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and am allergic to many products that contain perfume or any fragrance.  This is the ONLY hand cream that I can use that doesn&#x27;t cause my hands to break out.  And, it leaves a smooth clean feel after applied.</li>
    <li> Over the years I have tried so many hand lotions and have thrown away so many that I did not like.  I was thrilled to find this product.  It was reasonably priced and is the best lotion I have tried- ever!  It softens skin without leaving a greasy feeling.  It is so nice I would call it healing.  That&#x27;s how your skin feels upon use- healed.  Love it!!</li>
    <li> This is wonderful lotion and love getting all the smaller sizes as the lotion stays so fresh.  They last for a year or more; I use as a night creme on my face too.</li>
    <li> This is a great product at a very good price.  I like the travel size because I&#x27;m always on the move.</li>
    <li> This lotion gave me a chemical rash and my skin started to peel and got all red and itchy. I had to go to urgent care and spent $200 to be told that the chemicals in the lotion gave me a chemical burn!! You guys are lucky im not suing!</li>
    <li> Have used it for years as a face cream.  When I read it was used in the winter olympics&lt;br /&gt;I knew it would be a great product.</li>
    <li> I use to buy the in the store but now I can&#x27;t find them anymore except on here. It is great.</li>
    <li> How cheap it is. 12 little bottles in the box, easy to carry on.&lt;br /&gt;easy to absorb and good smell</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  Lotion is healing and moisturizing.  The first ingredient is aloe and not water like most products.  I have a friend who works at Panera and all of his co-workers beg him to use his lotion. They love it.  I&#x27;m sure because of the healing properties.  Please, please, please always keep this lotion available. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I recommend this product because it is perfect for very dry skin.  I live in a very hot climate and this lotion is excellent.  I could not find it in the stores in Puerto Rico so I looked for it online.  I&#x27;m so glad I found it.</li>
    <li> This is a great idea to sell this product in smaller containers so that the user can have a little everywhere!</li>
    <li> This lotion has the best texture, doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, and the smaller bottles are very handy to carry around.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used  this lotion for years and it&#x27;s great for very dry or red areas,I especially appreciate how it works for my feet in the winter or anytime they are just tired, it&#x27;s good for all areas I&#x27;d recommend this product to anybody.  I can&#x27;t always find in stores anymore,like many products so I depend on online shopping.</li>
    <li> I use this in conjunction with lush.com&#x27;s \\&quot;enhanced eye cream\\&quot; for puffiness under the eyes and dark circles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two together work like magic.  Lush cream before bed, and fruit of the earth first thing in the morning.  Tightens up the skin too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Makes you look fresh in the morning.  No puffiness or dark circles!</li>
    <li> not watery, non greasy.  absorbs into skin well.  I started using this product in the 90s for my skin after swimming and have been using it ever since.  When I run out of face lotion, I&#x27;ll use this without regret.</li>
    <li> Product is excellent, wish they also came in larger bottles for home use. Vendor ships very fast, and price is good</li>
    <li> Have used this lotion for a couple years ... my wife and I enjoy it.  We have the larger size for home use and use this smaller version for travel (retirees so always on the move).  Recommend - very nice product, size and reasonable price.</li>
    <li> If you need a good lotion that doesn&#x27;t have a really strong or distinct fragrance, this is the one. Unfortunately, my local pharmacy stopped stocking it. I was so glad to find it online</li>
