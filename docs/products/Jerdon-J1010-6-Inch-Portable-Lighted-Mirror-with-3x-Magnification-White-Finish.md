<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It was fine just to small so we returned it for a full refund</li>
    <li> I liked this but it broke from just having a few things laid on top of it. Shouldn&#x27;t have broken so easily.</li>
    <li> Love my new makeup mirror.  I like to put on my makeup, on the kitchen table. It&#x27;s the perfect size and the lighting is great.</li>
    <li> My 3 year old mirror switch finally gave I was hesitant on this type of mirror as past ones I have had.like it got to hot with all the bulbs. Needless to say I really like this one. Very pretty on my vanity, does not get hot, has the perfect amount of light, does what it is intended for. Fast delivery.</li>
    <li> This is what I wanted and needed at a price I could afford. At the age of 81 I find it difficult to see the chin hairs I have begun to grow.I can use this mirror setting down and seeing is no problem.</li>
    <li> THE MIRRORS WERE EXACTLY AS DESCRIBED!</li>
    <li> I am satisfied with this product .the packaging is ratchet ,though . But anyway the price is nice and I am happy to own a light mirror!</li>
    <li> I LOVED IT I HAVE A YOUTUBE CHANNEL AND I LOVE THE EXTRA LIGHT THESE PROVIDE AS WELL AS THE GREAT QUALITY OF THE MIRROR ALL AROUND!!! IVE DROPPED IT A MILLION TIMES AND YET HAS STILL TO BREAK IVE HAD IT OVER A YEAR AND I STILL HAVENT HAD TO REPLACE ONE LIGHT BULB</li>
    <li> I like this mirror and the lighting is very helpful and bright in my dark bathroom.  I do have only the complaint that it is a little short and I had to find something to put it on so that my neck is not bending down during use.  I did not think about that when I bought it - so just good for you to know if that might be an issue for you.</li>
    <li> Eyes are getting old and wanted a mirror I could take with me. This is just right. Bright enough, magnifies enough, small enough, light enough and the right price too.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Can&#x27;t get any better for the price.  The lights do get hot though, so if you&#x27;re spending a lot of time in front of the bulbs you&#x27;ll get a sunburn LITERALLY.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with my purchase.  It fits my needs perfectly, and I would recommend it to anyone in need of a lighted makeup mirror.  The expediency with which I received my purchase was greatly appreciated, and the product exactly as advertised, though I couldn&#x27;t tell the package had ever been opened, if in fact, it had.</li>
    <li> It is the perfect portable makeup mirror.  I like to two way mirror and the lights are good and bright.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the bulbs on it</li>
    <li> I recieved my product in a very timely manner, actually quicker than I expected.  It was just what I needed on my vanity to put my makeup on.  Just enough light, but if you want lots of light it wouldn&#x27;t be for you.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter for her birthday. I had one of these many years ago and gave it to her about 20 years ago and I had it several years before that. It finally died and we were lucky enough to find this on Amazon and it was the same one. She loves it and I use it sometimes too.</li>
    <li> This mirror does everything I want it to. It&#x27;s bright (but not overly-bright), it has a dual-sided mirror (the magnified side is great for eyebrow tweezing or applying eye makeup) &amp; the mirror actually stays in place when angled! Definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> Really good product for the price listed , it was delivered fast . The only negative thing i found is that after a little while if you are to close to it you start feeling hot for the light but other then that it makes a good product to have or to give as present .:)</li>
    <li> Nice to pack for traveling.  Good product.</li>
    <li> When I received the product I immediately tested it t to make sure everything was working correctly (i.e. the bulbs and wiring). The bulbs on the mirror were very bright (though they do have a yellow cast, which I do not mind). I noticed that the mirror had only been plugged in for a very short amount of time before I could feel heat coming from the bulbs, once again doesn&#x27;t bother me, but an observation for the future consumer. Overall, very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas gift to my 12 year old daughter... yes, 12!!! She started wearing light make up, shaping her eyebrows and taking more care about her appearance when she turned 12. I think this is the right age to learn to take the best care she can of her skin, right before pimples appear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her first reaction was getting scared of seeing she had a mustache. She took care of it immediately and now she wakes up 10 minute earlier every day to take good care of herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, as other reviews say, the light is way too high... the expected for 4x120W bulbs. You only feel disturbed a few seconds. After that, the getting beauty job is more effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I need one for myself because I caught myself often in the need to go to my daugher&#x27;s room</li>
    <li> This mirror is compact and easy to use. My daughters brought it with them on a recent trip which they took to Italy because it is easy to pack and is fairly light-weight. The brightness of the bulbs is very good for pulling whiskers (unfortunately, they take after me in the whisker category). The only drawback I find with this item is that it is not easy to find replacement bulbs; I had to order them directly from the manufacturer. Other than that and the fact the bulbs can get a little hot are the only complaints my daughters and I have.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect mirror for my purposes. I needed something small enough to go on a makeup vanity and something that had a magnification view and the lights are a plus!   Great mirror, very glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> I really like it just wish it was a little larger but the mirror clarity is great</li>
    <li> I had the hardest time finding a lighted makeup mirror! I did not want the one with 3 mirrors, too big.  I found this one on Amazon, not expensive and got mostly good reviews.   I think the lighting is really good!  It does get a bit warm, but I turn off the switch in between the time I&#x27;m using it and doing other things to get ready.  The lower left bulb cracked at it&#x27;s bottom base so it kinda just hanging there, but it&#x27;s most likely due to me putting it away in my cabinet incorrectly.  So only 3 lights are working now, but it&#x27;s still PLENTY of light!  I DO recommend this lighted makeup mirror.</li>
    <li> I have used this type of mirror for years..The first one I had lasted about 10 years if not more.  The second I had lasted maybe two years the problem with that purchase was I wrapped the cord around the mirror and that made the cord come out.  I read the instructions more carefully on the new purchase and I will not wrap the cord.</li>
    <li> This make-up mirror is super-bright, you can see every tiny pore on your face, which is exactly what I wanted. I had tried other brands and returned them all to the stores for being too dim. I was not satisfied until I found this mirror. Delivery was very fast! Buy this mirror if you want to see what you REALLY look like...</li>
    <li> This mirror has good magnification and great light, with one small problem:  it gives off enough heat to be a space heater!  I hate sweating when I&#x27;m trying to get ready to go, and this mirror ensures that I will sweat.  If you&#x27;re always cold, go for it...but if you have an internal thermostat that runs hot, like mine does, you&#x27;ll do better with a fluorescent model of some sort.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mother because the one she had was ancient and didn&#x27;t work well anymore. The mirror shipped in very good time. I was a little surprised at the size of it (i thought it wouldn&#x27;t be quite as small), but it was still a reasonable size in my opinion. Then I checked out the lighting, which I needed to be good because my mom doesn&#x27;t have the best vision anymore, and i was very pleased with how bright it was. You could see every little detail of the face clearly while looking into this mirror and that&#x27;s what i felt my mom needed. She seems very pleased as well with the product and was very happy that I got it for her at such a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> This is a handy little mirror with a nice magnifying side so you can really see the details of your face when applying make up.  However, it is not very bright at all and I find I must turn on additional lighting in the room and sit by the window during daylight hours to make this mirror work for me.  The only difference between this mirror and my bathroom light is that I can at least sit down while I put on my face.  The bulbs do get hot, but it&#x27;s not intolerable.  Overall, the product is ok for convenience but lousy in execution.</li>
    <li> I found the Jerdon Mirror J1010 to be too small and not adjustable.  I would have preferred the mirror to be taller.  Also the lights are extremely hot on this item.  Makeup mirrors usually have fluorescent lighting.  I did return this item.</li>
    <li> The lights on here are too yellow. The size is great and I only wish I could find a whiter, more natural looking light for this. I did chuck it to the good will bin because of the un natural light color. Just didn&#x27;t work with applying make up for best results.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted. It is small enought to travel with.</li>
    <li> The lights are bright you can see every detail! I am so happy with this purchase that I am buying another one for a friend.</li>
    <li> I own two of these mirrors! They are very bright and have great magnification. I have purchased other brands in the past - but this mirror is the best. I leave one at home and take the other with me when I travel. Hotels never have a nice, lighted mirror for applying make up, so this one does the trick without taking up too much space in my suitcase. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this mirror.</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror because I needed one that will light up, and this does that. it does get a little hot, but it does the job.. The box was a little damaged, but it didn&#x27;t seem to hurt the mirror.</li>
    <li> I love this mirror it is the best for at home makeup application. It&#x27;s hard to find replacement bulbs so this is the third Mirror I hve purchased but I now know how to get the extra light bulbs. I always have a great shipping experience with amazon as well!!!!!</li>
    <li> This mirror works perfect for what I needed. It fits on my vanity and provides great light and magnification for doing my make up everyday. The bulbs get a bit hot on your face if you lean in close to the mirror but I&#x27;ve learned to work in a way that keeps my face from being so close to the lights. The mirror is a good size. I can see mostly all of my face in the mirror up to 6 inches away. The tilt on the mirror is easy to use but stays in places when adjusted where you want it. The support on the back also stays in place. I hope this mirror lasts for a long time and is still available when I need a new one.</li>
    <li> The best lighted mirror out there!  Actually puts off enough light to do my makeup whereas others are weakly lighted.</li>
    <li> I bought it for the wife. She&#x27;s happy, I&#x27;m happy, the world is at peace.  That&#x27;s all the review you need!</li>
    <li> I had a terrible time finding a make-up mirror that had the magnification I need &amp; wasn&#x27;t too big for my vanity.  I returned this one &amp; ended up purchasing &amp; returning 6 mirrors before settling on a Conair.  It&#x27;s not exactly what I wanted, but it&#x27;s ok</li>
    <li> Not exactly what I expected but good product for the price, and convenient for travel.</li>
    <li> I purchased this mirror after looking at pretty positive reviews. It worked pretty welll - not as bright as the reviews said, but good for the price. I&#x27;ve only used it a few times in the 6 weeks I&#x27;ved owned it.&lt;br /&gt;But each time, the light goes off and on at random sometimes. It&#x27;s inconsistent. Most recently, I turned it on, and the wire started smoking. As in, burned a hole through the rubber wire.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product. It&#x27;s not safe or reliable.</li>
    <li> I bought this for the price, but may return it. The mirror is a bit small, which I thought I could live with, but the magnification mirror is distorted and that bothers me. Lighting is good enough. I will probably look for a taller mirror with better magnification.</li>
    <li> I have a mirror just like this one. I&#x27;ve had it for about 20 years. I&#x27;ve never purchased another type because I didn&#x27;t like them. I&#x27;ve looked in the stores for this one and could never find it. I was so happy when I saw it here on Amazon. Thank you I&#x27;m happy again.</li>
    <li> I looked at mirrors in stores, and they were twice the price.  This is mirror a value.  No complaints.</li>
    <li> The magnifying side of this makeup mirror is wonderful to use with my 56 year old eyes!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product easy to use.</li>
    <li> Really fast shipping!  Nice looking product</li>
    <li> GREAT PRICE AND FAST SHIPPING!! WHAT MORE COULD YOU WANT?!? THIS IS A WONDERFUL MIRROR FOR MAKEUP AND THEN YOU CAN FLIP THE MIRROR OVER FOR AN EVEN BIGGER VIEW FOR TWEEZNG!!!!!!!! LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!</li>
    <li> I needed a mirror for doing my makeup because the lighting/mirror in my room was not the best.... for the price it is a good mirror.. other people have send it wasn&#x27;t very good because of the heat it gave off witch is true as soon as it is turned on there is a heat sores that comes from the light... but I&#x27;ve deiced to change the bulbs itself... I believe the reason for it being so hot is the result of very cheap bulbs I will keep u posted after I do so.... but all in all a good buy</li>
    <li> Best buy for a lighted mirror...I have 3 of them ! Small enough to take with you on trips.  I like to use the magnifying side for make-up application. Since I am of the older generation, and need glasses for just about everything, this is the perfect mirror. Can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> I bought this basically for light to do my eye makeup and to shape my eyebrows.  My bathroom light is poor.  I will keep it and give it to my teenage daughter.  I tried using in two places; my bathroom and in my well lit living room.  It was not good or easy in either place. The lighting is yellowish.  The magnifying side does not really magnify all that much.  When I was trying to pluck my eyebrows my hand kept making shadows across my eyebrows because the lights are along the sides.  It made it very difficult.  Would not recommend this mirror.</li>
    <li> Had 1 of these for 20 years and it finally broke.  So upset until i found again on Amazon.  Love it, great features, great lighting compared to others that cost even more.</li>
    <li> This product is what I was looking for; however, it is very bright because there is nothing covering the lights. I do believe that a cover should be on then at least for safety because they look to be very hot; I have not actually touched them to see if they get hot though. My children will eventually find out for me.</li>
    <li> The Jerdon is half the size in height of my old mirror. Not usable for me. I had to hold it up for me to see my face adequately. So I am returning the mirror and getting one from Conair which has the height I require. I have a vanity with a seat that I use so a different mirror would be best.I also appreciate the longer style of the Conair because of the lighting. [[ASIN:B001RJBL7E Conair TM8LX Illumina Double-Sided Makeup Mirror with 4 Light Settings]]</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a bright, lightweight mirror, this is what you need. It&#x27;s great for travel and almost any surface. Yes, the lights can get warm on your face, but hey...you&#x27;re a star!  Good for small spaces. Flippable mirror. Standard plug in, cord toggle-on switch.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once so maybe later I&#x27;ll wish I gave it 5 stars. It does seem to be terribly bright, I can see all the lines and imperfections. It&#x27;s the right size for my needs and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> Bought this for a Christmas Present for my Mother. She absoultly loves it. She loves how it&#x27;s Lighted and Loves that one side of the Mirror you can get really close up. Definitely would Recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this. It&#x27;s not the newest or prettiest but it&#x27;s the. Best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Its OK...lights get hot.</li>
    <li> This is perfect, does exactly what I need.  I keep in a drawer with my Mae-up and use as needed. Much better than redoing all the lighting in bathroom. Recommend!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using my lighted makeup mirror since 1967 when I received it as a gift.  I&#x27;ve had difficulty finding light bulbs for it and have had to have it&#x27;s electrical cord repaired as well.  On a lark, I googled lighted makeup mirrors and to my amazement I found an exact replica of my 45 year old mirror.  I am thrilled.  Not only was I able to get a mirror, but also ordered replacement bulbs through Amazon.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with both products.</li>
    <li> Yes your face can get warm with the lights on BUT if you are looking for a magnifying mirror that lights up this is it!!!  The price is right and it has the perfect amount of magnification.  You will be able to tweeze/thread your eyebrows or put your makeup on perfectly.  This is a must have!!!</li>
    <li> The mirror is fine and worth the price. The only problem I have is that there&#x27;s no protective lens over the bulbs</li>
    <li> This mirror is ok.  The mirror is small and the lights are blindingly bright and tend to get hot fast.</li>
    <li> Works well. I don&#x27;t notice any more heat from than expected from the lights (they are going to get warm, of course). I HAVE TO USE IT UPSIDE DOWN, so the mirror is in the position I prefer, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
    <li> My room is very dark, so this light has really helped .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for this item for years.  I had one eight years ago and it got broken when I moved.    When these were delivered to me (I bought two), one had a corner broken into little pieces (plastic).    Other than that mishap, I&#x27;m glad I bought these.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Bright lights&lt;br /&gt;Double sided mirror&lt;br /&gt;Easy to pack/store&lt;br /&gt;Light&lt;br /&gt;Inexpensive&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Feels cheap&lt;br /&gt;Look cheap&lt;br /&gt;Hot lights&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this mirror as a replacement for my Conair mirror which broke. I&#x27;d had that one for years and years, so when the light stopped working, there was no way for me to find a light replacement. I really did not want to buy an expensive mirror because I am clumsy and knock things off my vanity all the time. I chose this mirror because of the lower price than others and the mostly positive reviews. I like this mirror because I can store it elsewhere instead of on my vanity, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about knocking it into the floor as often. I like that it&#x27;s light and easy to move, and I love the magnified mirror and regular mirror. The lights provide a good amount of light for me to tweeze my eyebrows and apply my makeup. I dislike that the lights give off a warm, yellow-y glow, but I can live with that. I like that the lightbulbs are exposed, therefore easily changed if broken/out. The only huge issue I have with this is that the lights get really, really hot on my face after only a few minutes. I work in movies, so I am accustomed to having bright, hot lights on me all the time, but this mirror gets incredibly hot. It&#x27;s bearable, but it&#x27;s quite annoying. I find that I feel the need to take breaks because it makes my face feel so hot.&lt;br /&gt;If having your face warmed doesn&#x27;t bother you, this is an excellent mirror for the price.</li>
    <li> The best makeup mirror I have ever purchased, it has wonderful lighting &amp; magnification, I could not ask for a better product!</li>
    <li> If you want a super bright lighted mirror, this is the one for you! Perhaps a bit too bright, I do wish Jerdon had put (even if optional) something over the bulbs to help diffuse them a bit. Even when trying to avoid looking directly into the bulbs you still have a hard time looking in the mirror itself and when you look away you get those red blurs on the sides of anything you look at for a while (even when you close your eyes they are there!) I think they were trying to design a smaller version of those studio makeup mirrors that have the bulbs all around it. The problem is that those you can use because everything is large and spaced out between where you can look into the mirror and the bulb itself. This you have to get too close to the mirror and the bulbs and it just doesn&#x27;t work. I swear, I&#x27;m a bit nauseous after using this mirror and my eyes are all wonky now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t give it a lower rating because other than the bulbs it&#x27;s a good quality mirror and a good size for me so I&#x27;m thinking of trying to find something to put over the bulbs (something that is fire resistant of course) to help diffuse them a bit. Otherwise this would have been a great mirror for those that needed something small due to a cramped space. But the bulbs just hurt your eyes too much.</li>
    <li> I really wanted a lighted make-up mirror because of my eyesight. I needed the magnification and I see much better with a lot of light. Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t read the description well enough, and when I got it I found that the lights were just regular bulbs for a make-up mirror, but the lights could not be adjusted to mimic different types of light (daylight, lamp light, florescent etc.) I didn&#x27;t return it because I&#x27;ll be able to use it for something, but basically, I was a little disappointed. I recommend that you read the descriptions really well before purchasing.</li>
    <li> Mom loved the mirror!</li>
    <li> Exposed bulbs, nothing to protect the bulbs from breaking whilst in transit.</li>
    <li> Years and years ago, Conair used to have a makeup mirror similar to this one. I used it until I could no longer find it or replacement bulbs. I&#x27;ve tried many makeup mirrors since, but they were not as brightly lit as my old Conair, and I missed it.  I had grown tired of the problems with my latest makeup mirror, yet another one of those with the 4 different lighting settings (dimly bright, dim, darkly dim, and might-as-well-be-off), so I went in search of a replacement. I could not believe it when I saw this one, so much like my old Conair. And when I saw the reviews that mentioned the hot lights, I remembered that was the only thing I hadn&#x27;t missed from the old makeup mirror.  My first look in this Jerdon mirror upset me mightily. I was MOR-TI-FIED! There were marks, clogged pores and blemishes on my face that I had not been able to see using my previous makeup mirror. No wonder it seemed like blemishes erupted with no warning-- there wasn&#x27;t enough light to see the warning to put something on it! I can&#x27;t address what I can&#x27;t see, and I always used the magnifying side-- which, btw, was stronger than this Jerdon magnifying side. But without enough light, I thought I was leaving the house looking halfway decent. Far from it-- I was scandalous!  I&#x27;m already getting compliments on my skin again. I&#x27;d forgotten they&#x27;d stopped, I guess I figured when I hit my mid-40s that was over. Now everyone suddenly thinks I have this perfect skin. Well, no, but I have been able to address the enlarged and clogged pores, the blemishes, and even see my first wrinkles. And of course I&#x27;m able to apply my makeup better.  On the bad side, I had to spend a pocketful of money to get some good products to deal with all these problems that I can now see thanks to my Jerdon mirror, but then again, the other day the lab tech doing my blood work was astonished when she noted on my chart I am 52. She said I looked nothing near it, and looked genuinely surprised, not just being sweetly southern. She&#x27;s seen me every 3 months for the last 4 years, noting my age every time. She&#x27;s never said that before.  So if your experience is like mine, you will have a bit of psychological trauma when you first get your mirror, but after taking care of some issues, you&#x27;ll look years younger. And let me tell you, the heat of those bulbs is nothing compared to the compliments-- or seeing how much better my skin is looking now that I can see it again!</li>
    <li> I saw the mixed reviews before I bought this product, but the price was too good not to check it out.  I wish I listened to the negative reviews.&lt;br /&gt;1.  The lights are hot.  With all the heat they generate, they should be a lot brighter.  However, they just don&#x27;t generate enough light to put on make-up unless you are already in a bright room (in which case they are irrelevant)&lt;br /&gt;2.  The lights give a distinct yellowish cast to your face so that your makeup looks completely different in normal indoor and outdoor lighting&lt;br /&gt;3.  Because of the heat from the bulbs, you have to be back far enough so that only part of your face shows up in the mirror and makes the 3x magnification useless.&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion - defective design - does not work as well as an unlighted unmagnified dollar hand mirror.</li>
    <li> The lighting is awful.  It&#x27;s a funny color not worth buying this no matter what the price is.</li>
    <li> The mirror is very bright and you can see your brows very well to pluck them.Great for applying makeup and doing your hair.A reproduction of the 60&#x27;s vintage \\&quot;mirror go lightly\\&quot;.A must have!!</li>
    <li> What ever happened to the wonderful vanity mirrors that were so easy to find when I was growing up?  They were nice and bright, to the point of being horrifying when you see your face in all that light.  I started out with a Revlon one from the store, I couldn&#x27;t even tell if it was off or on the lighting was so poor so I got this one instead.  The lighting is very yellow, which I was somewhat disappointed in.  While it is a little brighter than the Revlon one, it still isn&#x27;t what I&#x27;d hoped for. I&#x27;ve however invested all I care to in the venture so I&#x27;ll stick with it, it&#x27;s livable.</li>
    <li> This mirror is good.&lt;br /&gt;My only issue, the lights become very hot very quickly.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite travel mirror.  It fits anywhere in my luggage and is a must have when I travel.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this lighted mirror. It is very much like one I had for 10 years, just an inch or two smaller in size. The magnified side is scary, really see all the wrinkles!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my daughter for Christmas. She uses it every morning and really likes it. It&#x27;s a great make-up mirror and I haven&#x27;t heard any complaints!</li>
    <li> Size of mirror is smaller than I thought it would be.  Took the light bulbs out of this mirror &amp; put them in my old mirror.  Light wasn&#x27;t as good with this mirror.  Would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> this is a great mirror, you can see everything on your face. (kinda scary but love it)&lt;br /&gt;will recommend this product. still working perfect!</li>
    <li> i love the two sides of this mirror. The stand holds the mirror very well, even when i use it on my lap! Although the bulbs do get hot quick.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! Searched everywhere for one of these and this was the only place I found it for a reasonable price! Best makeup mirror ever!!</li>
    <li> I have been trying to find a high-quality lighted mirror, but at a reasonable price. Well, I finally found one, and this is it. I use it every day when I apply makeup and/or tweeze my eyebrows. It works great, and the seller was great.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like that the magnified mirror side was distorted.  No matter which way I tried moving the mirror, it&#x27;s warped and distorted.</li>
    <li> Have had this for about a month.  Light is bright enough, two-sided mirror easy to use and offers good magnification.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this mirror years ago and couldn&#x27;t remember the name of it, the only reason I didn&#x27;t use it anymore is because I lost it in a move. Such a great mirror! The lights do get hot but it&#x27;s not so hot where you have to worry about the bulbs burning out. The mirrors it&#x27;s self are great. I really recommend this mirror to anyone who is looking for a long lasting mirror.</li>
    <li> Good mirror for the price. I don&#x27;t like that the bulbs are exposed without a cover to protect them. Bulbs are very bright and it takes your eyes a few seconds to adjust. Overall it&#x27;s ok for the price.</li>
    <li> What I had been looking for.&lt;br /&gt;Gave as gift to grand dauthers.and they love it...Thank you for making easy to find.</li>
    <li> This item has very bright lights, a good thing to put on makeup BUT you cannot see in the mirror due to the brightness.  Not a very good design.  I sent it back for a refund!</li>
    <li> This is just what she wanted and at the right price</li>
    <li> i am enjoying the mirror much</li>
    <li> I have a small face and this is too small for me</li>
    <li> I was very happy with my purchase. This mirror is really great and BRIGHT! Perfect for all I need it for!!!!</li>
    <li> i live in an apartment and apply make up at my desk.  So I have to keep this in a desk drawer.  I rarely plug it in, because I am too lazy to make the effort.  However, I have a window that faces me and provides north light, (bad for plants: very good for judging make-up!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you go out at night, I suppose the lights will come in handy when zero light comes through the window&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I enjoy the handiness of this mirror.  And that I can stand it up and use both hands for fixing my face.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know who thought that it was a good idea to make a makeup mirror with yellow lights on it. Just no. This is terrible. I would not recommend. Sure, you can change the lights to proper makeup lights, but why waste more money? Just get something with white lights.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this mirror. The lights are very bright and in the daylight when I don&#x27;t need them, the mirror is perfect. The magnified side is just right and the normal mirror is also just right.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my teen daughter to help with putting on her contacts.She loves it, and it has lasted her, which is saying a lot cause she breaks everything. Great product for price, she doesn&#x27;t wear makeup YET! so can&#x27;t say how true the lighting is, but works great for contacts,and plucking eyebrows.</li>
    <li> I broke my previous makeup mirror, so I needed to look around to get a new one. I wanted one that was very bright, as my eyes are not as good as they once were. This mirror fit the bill- it is very bright and the window shows all.</li>
    <li> I had read so many mixed reviews of Jerdon&#x27;s other models, that I decided to stick with the original.  I had this model previously for years and the cord finally had a short.  I like this one just the same.</li>
    <li> Nice mirror, especially for the price</li>
    <li> I have this same mirror with a different brand name on it. Love the mirror, but never thought I&#x27;d find an exact replacement, since my daughter took mine. This mirror is also great for traveling, because it&#x27;s not too big, but big enough. Great buy !</li>
    <li> i ordered this because of all of the great reviews. i live overseas and didn&#x27;t realize that it&#x27;s 190V so as soon as i plugged it in and turned it on, i blew a couple of fuses in my house and fried the mirror for good.  i still decided to try using it as a mirror only, but it&#x27;s just useless. the swivel mirror is weighted wrong, whenever i put it to the right angle it slowly falls to a point where i have to hunch over to see my face. every time i&#x27;ve used it i have to fix the angle 5 times during my application. it&#x27;s ridiculous designing for the price, annoying, uncomfortable, and unfortunately a waste of money. the mirror is also quite small and unless you prop the mirror directly in front of your face, on some books or something, you&#x27;re just looking at yourself from a bad angle, and you have to be literally and inch or two away from the mirror to see yourself. total disappointment.</li>
    <li> This was just like the Profile make-up mirror that I purchased several years ago.  One of the sockets burned out on the old one.  Good to find that they were still being made - even if under a new name.</li>
    <li> Not compliant with our electricity .&lt;br /&gt;Not advertised as such.&lt;br /&gt;Brought a converter plugged it in blew bulb and switch&lt;br /&gt;Can not buy replacement bulbs.</li>
    <li> This mirror works great for me. I find it to be the perfect brightness. I won&#x27;t be using the flip magnifying side as I find it too magnified and distorting.  To be fair however, I tend to find all super magnified mirrors that way.&lt;br /&gt;It also came in handy when doing halloween makeup for others and they could really see all the details because the light was so bright. Very happy with the mirror overall.</li>
    <li> Nice to have a lighted magnifying mirror but doesn&#x27;t work for peach/orange makeup. Yellow cast to light makes it hard to see details.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been a few years since I purchased this. It&#x27;s still working great. The magnifying side is very helpful.</li>
    <li> I have bad eyes and this helps me get my makeup on. I had to go several years without one like this because you can no longer buy them at WalMart of KMart.  So I had to use an alternative, but it did not compare to this mirror.</li>
    <li> Size is great for travel.  Lights are a bit yellow, but really assists in hotel lighting.  Magnification is good also.</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this.. because it has 3x that is very hard to find.. but the bulbs get hot and I can feel the heat on my face when looking on the mirror.. sorry.. not for me</li>
    <li> I needed a much brighter mirror than the other makeup mirrors out there.  This is a good one.  Plus the magnification helps too.  The price plus free shipping with my Prime membership made this a perfect purchase.</li>
    <li> this is just what I wanted</li>
    <li> Perfect! we bought this for our son for his orthodontics stuff. He can get up close and personal when cleaning his teeth...at least that was the idea. When he&#x27;s done with it, then I get it! 😀 Win. Win.</li>
    <li> Very weak magnification and lighting.  Would never buy it again and only use it when desperate!  Can&#x27;t see a thing, even when wearing my glasses!!!</li>
    <li> ITS OK JUST WISH IT WAS BIGGER  AND HAD A STAND ON THE BACK OF IT......IT DOES GET REALLY HOT BUT THAT DOESNT BOTHER ME BC I&#x27;M ALWAYS COLD AND IT HELPS MY CREAMS BE MORE PLIABLE BUT MY SIS IN LAW SAID SHE WAS SWEATING BULLETS LOL</li>
    <li> Loved everything about this mirror, although I thought it would be brighter, hence the 4 stars. Not quite &#x27;natural&#x27; light as some other reviewers claim.</li>
    <li> Very nice! Great lighting, lightweight and magnification is perfect multipals! Great seller! A+ seller</li>
    <li> Not happy with this mirror at all.  It didn&#x27;t seem to make things close enough and the lights were too yellow.</li>
    <li> when I read it I thought it had several brightness levels. Its ok but not what I wanted but will do.</li>
    <li> I use this mirror everyday to do my makeup. It works very well and I don&#x27;t have any issues with it. I&#x27;ve had it for well over an year. Love it!</li>
    <li> Works great. Nice lighting for applying makeup</li>
    <li> the mirror is great. My sister loves it. It is perfect for her small bedroom and does the job of being able to see her eyebrows to tweeze.</li>
    <li> Loved it, But it is smaller than I thought it would be. But it does say 6-inch portable.Good for travel.</li>
    <li> I thought the magnifier would be larger but like it anyway. Lights are bright enough to heat up the room..</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful mirror. It&#x27;s very light and easy to store. The tiltable mirror makes doing your makeup anywhere a snap. The only thing to be aware of which has already been mentioned is that the bulbs do tend to heat up so you will definitely feel some warmth while putting on your makeup. If this doesn&#x27;t bother you (as it did not bother me) this is a great choice.</li>
    <li> The mirror itself seems distorted and not in the normal Makeup Mirror way. The lights are not bright at all and get super hot. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this at all.</li>
    <li> Just the right size to travel with!! Love it!! Not too big, not too small. Love that it&#x27;s a smaller version of the big one on my vanity!</li>
    <li> This is a good mirror, though not what I was originally looking for but I don&#x27;t have any complaints about it. I came looking for a trifold light up makeup mirror with a magnifying side like my mother had when I was growing up. I looked hard at this one &amp; decided it was a good deal but, when it is all said &amp; done, I think I  needed the nostalgia.&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely works as advertised, I  still feel I would like the enhanced view of the trifold but that is MY error, this mirror is a great deal.</li>
    <li> Perfect! You don&#x27;t need one any bigger than this.  VERY bright. I can only use two of the lights burning at a time. Had to unscrew two of them. I had been searching for one of these for a while, but they were usually much bigger, or a tri-fold and much pricier. This one fit all my desires of size and price. I&#x27;d reorder this same one If I needed. I&#x27;m going to give one to my daughter next month for her birthday. Love Amazon! What did we do before?</li>
    <li> I cannot as this time as it is a Christmas present.</li>
    <li> I like everything about it except the prop behind it is a bit short thereby making it lean too far back. This is only because where I have to put it is rather high and I need it more straight up, making it a bit unstable.</li>
    <li> This is a nice mirror, but I ended up returning it. The lights were not bright enough and wouldn&#x27;t stay on consistently. Will try another brand.</li>
    <li> Bulbs blew, can&#x27;t find replacements</li>
    <li> To replace the bulbs will cost as much as a whole new mirror.</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror because it was just like one I had years ago. It&#x27;s everything I expected it to be now maybe I can put makeup and be able to see what I&#x27;m doing.  I can&#x27;t wait to use it for the first time :)</li>
    <li> It works great and is a nice compact size so it fits in the area where I use it. I recommet this product</li>
    <li> Could not find any good small make-up mirrors for travel. Had this brand before. Could not find at the store.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a two sided mirror (one with magnification and one without) with lights. There isn&#x27;t much to it. Though, I did notice the manual called the blank areas &amp;#34;pressed pieces&amp;#34; with an image of nice flowery pressed design around the mirror and the lights but this one only has smooth rectangles where I think the pressing should have been. It&#x27;s a shame because the images of the mirror in the literature that comes with it looks much prettier.</li>
    <li> The lighting on this is terrible.  Good thing I bought it for my 10 year old daughter&#x27;s desk just starting out with dapping a bit of lipstick on.</li>
    <li> I bought this four years ago and it&#x27;s still going strong.  Haven&#x27;t had to change the light bulbs yet either.  This is a great mirror for those who small tight spaces.  I can do my makeup without waking up my husband, a perk he loves as well.</li>
    <li> Superior lighting and easy flip mirror. The bulbs are exposed for easy changing.  Just like the high dollar professional vanity mirrors, only in a personal/home size.  Glad I chose this one.</li>
    <li> Works great b6t had to take of tge bright lights out it was bright with all 4 lights in it</li>
    <li> Bought this so I could have good lighting while on vacation at our family cabin to do my makeup.The bulbs get way to hot, safety issue and the lighting was horrible! So disappointed! Sadly this will be going into the trash. Waste of money!</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a lighted vanity mirror.  It is perfect and looks exactly like the picture.  It was not expensive which was a big plus in my consideration.  I would buy again from this seller.</li>
    <li> Lights everything up perfectly, my mother had one just like this from the seventies and I love it and this one is just the same, it&#x27;s exactly what I wanted</li>
    <li> Great value for the price. I am very happy.  Ordered 2 and gave one to my friend who is also pleased with product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s like looking in an old-school fun-house mirror. I wear glasses but need them OFF while I use the darned mirror. Unfortunately, you CANNOT see the areas in need of trimming without getting so close to the mirror itself that, well, you can&#x27;t see what you&#x27;re trying to do without putting glasses back on and even then it&#x27;s very difficult. The older ones like this mirror (different manufacturer I suspect) were way, way better to use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this product. I have no complaints. It works well and is the perfect size for my needs. CS</li>
    <li> Lights too strong, too close to mirror - blinding rather than illuminating .  Daylight needed to use conveniently. Found disappointing.</li>
    <li> Perfect for travel or small spaces. Gives off a natural lighting and excellent quality mirrors. I have a small vanity area for getting ready and this sits on the desk, I use it daily and love it. Bought another for my daughter who also loves  it. Bulbs remind me of a classic Hollywood vanity. Great product.</li>
    <li> I have a strange lighting situation so I was very excited to try this built-in-lighting mirror (which I purchased). Unfortunately, the itty bitty light bulbs are aligned inward so I have almost no light directed at my face. The end result is a dim orange tinted light that is not optimal for makeup application, which is the reason I bought this mirror in the first place.</li>
    <li> This little mirror is great ... It tucks away when Im done with it very well .. Great for putting on makeup.. The light bulbs watts are just right .. Great as a gift for someone ...</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my daughter who sells makeup &amp; needed something that lights up.  She loves it.</li>
    <li> Very nice mirror if a bit small. Good magnification and very bright lights. Tends to get hot after using for a few minutes.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 12 year old daughter who loves it.  Since we have only one bathroom, her and her older brother wait until the last possible second to get ready for school in the mornings, which used to end in fighting over the bathroom.  Because of this, she uses this mirror in her bedroom to put on her make-up.  The lighting is bright and she can adjust the angle of the mirror to what she needs.  It makes for more peaceful mornings in our home.</li>
    <li> This is the best mirror I have owned and I probably owned about 15 of them.  Would buy again.</li>
    <li> This lighted make-up mirror is replacing one that finally died after decades of use.  The bulbs are only one color: slightly pink; and they get hot very quickly.  While I would have preferred a duplicate of my old one, this one will do.  Especially since they no longer make my old version.  The 3X magnification is good, but I find that propping my small 15X mirror in front of the 3X mirror is even better.&lt;br /&gt;I found the brace in the back to be useless.  It is not long enough to hold the mirror in a semi-erect position. To use the back brace I would have to hover over the mirror instead of sitting in front of it.  Solution: I stood the mirror upright and then tilted the mirror.  Seems to work fine.</li>
    <li> It was just what I wanted.  Good lighting and portable!</li>
    <li> I love this lighted mirror! I can place it on a desk and angle the mirror to exactly how I need it, and the lighting from the side light bulbs hits just perfect without me having to continuously adjust the mirror. I purchased this product because I was getting frustrated with using standard ceiling lights or floor or desk lamps in combination with a non-lighted standup or handheld mirror--the lighting just doesn&#x27;t illuminate your face the right way in a mirror, so you have to keep repositioning yourself in front of the mirror in order to see. With this lighted mirror, I can get my makeup done just as if I was in front of an adequate bathroom mirror. I take it with me when staying away from home. Other reviews state that the lighting is too bright or the bulbs are too hot; I personally think that they are just fine.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS! It is my second one. The first one I now use for travel. The bulbs lasted for a good seven years. With daily use. I would advise going to a lightening store - bring one of the bulbs - and order a few to have on hand for down the line. I have only had to replace one bulb in the sevenish years I have had my original one. I love it so much I use one at home and one for travel. Also bought one for my daughter.</li>
    <li> Very impressed by this mirror! I bought it to replace a very old one I had that was similar that I was sure I&#x27;d never find one to compare but this one is great! I love it and would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> this mirror is smaller than I expected. the lights are super bright. quality seems good but a bit expensive for what you&#x27;re getting. shop for something at Walmart or Target instead.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter for Christmas she loves this mirror,I thought it would be a little small but it works great!</li>
    <li> I like this mirror, it&#x27;s good for the price, the lights are very bright and mirror quality is good. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that I have to put it on something really high up or else I have to bend down to see myself in it because it doesn&#x27;t have any elevation like other makeup mirrors have a &#x27;neck&#x27; but this one is portable so that&#x27;s why it doesn&#x27;t have that. The lightbulbs have worked for a long time and I haven&#x27;t had to change any at all since I got it over 6 months ago which I was surprised about because it&#x27;s pretty cheap and I use it a lot.</li>
    <li> I have had this same lighted makeup mirror for 10 years. Some people have said the bulbs are too hot. I don&#x27;t think so, but I only spend about 10 minutes in front of it fixing my face, so maybe I&#x27;m not there long enough to feel the heat the rest of you are talking about. If some of you don&#x27;t care for the shading of the frosted bulbs, switch them out for clear ones. I go back and forth with them. You can pick up replacement bulbs at any lighting store for cheap. I&#x27;m hoping this mirror will last me the next 10 years as well as the last one has. And I hope these will still be available then,  too. I absolutely recommend this lighted mirror.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good mirror considering the price.  I bought it as a replacement for my ten year old Conair mirror that was broken by my cat.  My only complaint is the Jerdon is not as magnified as my previous mirror but the lighting is much better. I have to admit I was hesitant to purchase this after reading previous reviews about the lights making the mirror too hot to use.  It&#x27;s been fine for me and I&#x27;ve found it doesn&#x27;t get too hot.  Not a bad product for the price. I would definitely recommend....</li>
    <li> Love this mirror.  Exactly what I wanted.  Nice bright lights.</li>
    <li> Good travel light but a bit too small and sits too low for every day use. But still good product for travel.</li>
    <li> I love this mirror. It&#x27;s a necessity</li>
    <li> I have had several Jerdon Makeup mirrors and this one does not meet the standard of the others.  The mirror, which is what you are buying, is distorted and wavy.  Stay away from this one!</li>
    <li> This mirror is too low, you have to put it on a high desk or use a low chair when working with it, unless you don&#x27;t mind working with it at an angle. I would of peferred something eye level though didn&#x27;t think of it when I bought this. I would of also preferred a larger mirror, you can see your whole head in it, but that is because the mirror makes your head appear smaller than what it is. The lighting is too bright, I find it doesn&#x27;t accurately portray the color when it is that bright, the lights also get hot.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST lighted make-up mirror ever.  The lighting is great and I love the regular mirror and the 3X magnification.  3X is perfect for plucking eyebrows and applying make up flawlessly.I have used this very type for many years and I am so glad it is still made.  It stores easily in the drawers so it does not have to be left on the counter all the time.  It is so much better than others I have used.  I have never been able to find replacement bulbs for it, but they do last a long time, and the mirror is such a good price that I did not mind buying a new one when my other bulbs were out.</li>
    <li> The first thing I noticed , as I took the mirror out of the box, was that the stand did not support it well.  It would not stay in the position I put it.  The mirror is too small, and it could use more magnification.  Also. one of the bulbs burnt out in the first 5 minutes of use.  I would not recommend this mirror.</li>
    <li> I had a make-up mirror exactly like this one. I got it in 1972 as a gift. And,it lasted this long! I did replace the bulbs once. It finally quit working. I was thrilled to find this one! It&#x27;s compact, with  good lighting.</li>
    <li> The mirror is perfect you can see clearly . I would definitely get another one for , my neice</li>
    <li> I finally look the same in natural light as I do inside b/c I&#x27;m not slathering on loads and loads of sunscreen and foundation under bad lighting then going outside and looking like either a terra cotta pot or a zombie.</li>
    <li> I like this mirror, the light come from the sides and the back support are very thoughtful. The only thing is it is not easy to carry~~~but no one will bring this to walk around.</li>
    <li> Really practical. I use this on a monthly basis for the times where I just really want to sit and do makeup, and not stand in the bathroom, the lights are a but more yellow than I would have liked, and so my makeup always looks a little different than when I go to a different room or outside.</li>
    <li> Got this as a gift for my 16 year old niece. The 4 light bulbs are very luminous to see facial details but are not blinding. She has a small room so I didn&#x27;t want to get her one too big for storage reasons. The size is just right for her.</li>
    <li> Love this lighted mirror so useful and am fully satisfied I made this purchase exactly what I needed</li>
    <li> I love it , I had something very similar in the past , and that&#x27;s the reason I choose this one , this is perfect, nice size lights are perfect.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing i didn&#x27;t love it is the quality in the magnifier mirror it has a little distortion on the borders, doesn&#x27;t bother me much.&lt;br /&gt;But thats the reason is not perfect.</li>
    <li> Excellent for the price. The lighting is very nice, bright but not too bright. The only problem is the stand it comes with. It should be a telescoping stand. As is its currently subject to only one angle and that it&#x27;s a very low angle. If you like to lean over your vanity then perfect but if you like to sit up, you&#x27;ll have to rig it somehow with books behind it or some other means.</li>
    <li> I need another one of these! Mine blew up while I was in Turkey and tried to plug it in with an international adapter. Don&#x27;t do that, okay? This lighted mirror, in addition to my reading glasses, is the only way I can see the hairs on my chin to tweeze them outa there! LOL!</li>
    <li> This make up mirror is great for the price. Lights are nice and bright and the mirror has two sides and one side is magnified.</li>
    <li> The lights are too yellow and not bright enough. I should have spent a little more money to get a better mirror.</li>
    <li> I thought this was battery and plug in  very disappointed.  looked old...light bulbs were older looking as well.</li>
    <li> Perfect for a 13 year old.  Just the right size and not too expensive.  Shipping was great and I had it in a couple of days..</li>
    <li> Not my favorite mirror, its smaller than I pictured when I sit this on my vanity but I am a pretty tall woman. The lights are bright and the mirror is ok, a little small but it does the job.</li>
    <li> The lower right light doesn&#x27;t work.  I have switched bulbs and that didn&#x27;t help.  It is a faulty mirror.  I didn&#x27;t save the box to send it back in, so that is why I didn&#x27;t return it. I&#x27;m not happy with it.</li>
    <li> Although I did not return it, the light on the mirror was not good enough to use as a make-up mirror.  Make-up mirrors should have lights that would allow you to see your make-up in natural daylight.  I did have a make up mirror that did that and could not find another.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t really know how to rate these things but my granddaughter loved it.  That&#x27;s all the proof I need!</li>
    <li> The lights get very hot so be careful handling product.</li>
    <li> Provides the best lighting for applying all my facial products.</li>
    <li> 3X magnification, not 5X. I would use this for my everyday mirror if it had the 5X magnification. Nice bright lights, long cord, compact size, great for travel, easily fits in a carry on.</li>
    <li> This mirror is excellent, it has great light.  I had one before this but the light was too dim this one is a good mirror highly reccomend</li>
    <li> I recently purchased the Jerdon J1010 lighted makeup mirror. Jerdon JPT25W 25-watt mirror replacement light bulbs, 2 on a card, popped up as an \\&quot;add on\\&quot; item. Why not, I thought, these bulbs must fit this mirror if they are shown side-by-side, so I purchased 3 packs (past experience has taught me that replacement bulbs can be very hard to find, and I wanted extra). But guess what? These bulbs do not fit. The base is too small. (And shame on Amazon for promoting this \\&quot;add on\\&quot; ...) Okay, I said to myself ... irritating ... but not a big problem. I decided I would skip the headache of returning the bulbs and just try to find a use for them here at home. In the meantime, I figured Jerdon must offer the correct replacement bulbs, so I went to jerdonstyle.com to place my order. Ah! I was wrong again! The jerdonstyle.com website does not offer replacement bulbs for the Jerdon J1010 lighted makeup mirror. SERIOUSLY????? Okay. Very irritated now, but still not defeated. I called Jerdon consumer assistance at 866-759-4650 to find out how I could go about ordering replacement bulbs. I called multiple times ... different days ... different times of the day. Each time I called the phone rang and rang and rang and rang then a prerecorded message flipped on saying \\&quot;Thank you. Goodbye.\\&quot; And the call was ended. ??????? GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE JERDON!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am soooooo disgusted. I purchased this mirror because I could not find replacement bulbs for my old mirror, and now I am in the same boat as I was before!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, here is my review of the mirror itself:&lt;br /&gt;1. The base is somewhat narrow, so the unit can be easily tipped over. If you set it on a firm, level surface and are careful when positioning the angle of mirror this will probably not be an issue.&lt;br /&gt;2. I really like the overall look of the unit, but the size of the mirror itself is smaller than what I expected.&lt;br /&gt;3. When I purchased this mirror I thought 3x magnification would be enough for my needs, but it is a little bit weak. Admittedly, I wear bifocals, so that in itself could be the problem.&lt;br /&gt;4. The mirror lights up very nicely, but the bulbs do get warm with use. (LOL! That is until they burn out and you have none to replace them with!!!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if you do not mind spending money on a lighted mirror that will be of no use to you once the bulbs have burned out, then this is not a bad buy.my needs, but it is a little bit weak.

    <li> These bulbs get very warm on your face while using it. The color from the lights are warm/yellow. Not a bright bulb, so if you are looking for something to REALLY enhance your imperfections, or for tweezing, even with decent eyesight, I would recommend a different mirror. This is my second try at this exact mirror over the course of my 38 years. I&#x27;d hoped that my first mirror purchased was a fluke (19 years old) and that this one would be better (37 years old). If I had it to do over, I would pay the EXTRA money AFTER going to a physical store to get a feel for the bulb color, etc. prior to purchasing.</li>
    <li> This mirror was a great idea for a gift.  The quality was good.  I did not get a chance to use it because it was damaged in shipment.  I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> Great makeup mirror small and its good for travel</li>
    <li> I received my mirror in the mail and I&#x27;m pleased with the weight, considering this will be used as a travel mirror, and the brightness of the lights. The only problem is the heat of the lights. Is there a way to change the light bulbs to different ones that will be just as bright but not as hot?</li>
    <li> I have a hard time seeing because of migraines.  Yes I know I have a lighted mirror and have migraines but I can see with the magnifying without the lights on and I don&#x27;t have to hold it and I can sit down.  I can also on good days turn it on or unscrew however many lights I need to make it just right for my migraines.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed with the quality and magnification of the mirror on this product.  The light bulbs were not bright enough to see clearly or close enough to use accurately. Dissapointed</li>
    <li> This mirror is a great little makeup mirror.  THe only complaint I have is the replacement bulbs are VERY difficult to find.  So much so that it is almost easier to buy a new mirror instead of hunt down the bulbs.  Plus if you need a couple bulbs - these can sell for $3.00 each plus shipping and the whole mirror can be found for about $12.99.</li>
    <li> This mirror is very bright and i like how it has the 3 times magnification on one side of the mirror and then the 1 times magnification on the other side of the mirror. The ligting does have a yellow tint to it and it does get hot very quickly but i was looking for a mirror with yellow lighting as weird as that sounds because i noticed my makeup turns out better with it because it is brighter then most lights and the fact it get&#x27;s hot very quickly does not bother me because it does not take me long to put my makeup on. The feel of this mirror is hollow and plastic and it is very small the only things that slightly bother me are thoughs. But you get what you pay for and i have not been able to locate recplacment bulbs for it online at all but i will just call the number it came with when i need them or i will just go into batterys plus with one of the bulbs and i&#x27;m sure they will have it. I would recomend this product if you do not mind the cons in it that i just listed and i would more then likely purchase this again and from this seller again unless i found one cheaper that had better reviews.</li>
    <li> I purchased this one after having to return one that arrived broken.  I changed from the Conair Oval one to this one......it definitely suited my needs much better.  I needed one to use in our RV......small and portable.  The magnification is just right....and lights are bright.</li>
    <li> i love this makeup mirror i got it for christmas and its amazing i love the lights on it and how it has a stand to hold it up and it can flip to the normal side or the magnification side.</li>
    <li> its not a strong as I needed but I like it anyways..... lights are super bright but I heard there hard to fine</li>
    <li> Would give 5 star but light seems just not bright enough</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror for my daughter and loved it so much I ended up ordering one for me. This mirror I&#x27;d the perfect size. It is large enough to use st a Vanity but small enough to travel with. The lights are so bright you can see everything. The magnification feature really helps to see everything. I can&#x27;t recommend this mirror enough.</li>
    <li> Good mirror for travel since it is compact and the lighting it throws is adequate. I&#x27;ll probably order another as a backup since these are becoming more difficult to find.</li>
    <li> I received my MIrror the next day after I ordered it so that&#x27;s a plus. I love it. It does get pretty hot but still good lighting. I would of loved it if it was higher Just so I don&#x27;t have to be bending down to look into the mirror but that&#x27;s fixable :) Cute overall and worth the price</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting to love this product as much as I do. It&#x27;s awesome. I get compliments on this every time someone sees it. It&#x27;s cute and functional. The lights are bright enough to really illuminate the face and allow you to see every aspect of whatever you are doing to your face. Love that it has a magnifying side for seeing things like small eyebrow hairs. I&#x27;ve had this for six months now and haven&#x27;t had any problems. One thing I might change on a future model - give this thing a longer cord. The cord is fairly short.</li>
    <li> Lighting is awful.  Not a good purchase.</li>
    <li> Very happy with mirror.  First of all, the price was absolutely excellent, lower than in stores.  Secondly, I got thru Prime so it arrived in 2 days. Lastly, the quality is great, I love the magnifying mirror and the lights make it easy to see.</li>
    <li> I had one for 30 years with fluorescents on both sides and a dial for daytime, office, night.  I loved that mirror. Was looking for something comparable. This isn&#x27;t. I need both bright light and excellent magnification.</li>
    <li> Great product for the money. My wife would highly recommend this makeup mirror to all her friends or anyone else that needs a new mirror.</li>
    <li> Not the greatest, but it&#x27;s portable, lighted and magnified....gets the job done.</li>
    <li> I use this mirror to twizz my eyebrows.  I like it because it gets the job done, lights my face to be able to see my eyebrow better.  Its&#x27; not really portable since you have to be close enough to an outlet to plug it in.  It&#x27; not really good for makeup mirror, since the makeup will probably melt off before you are finished since the bulbs heat up so much you feel like you are in a sauna.</li>
    <li> This worked fine until the light bulbs started going out - cannot find the light bulbs any where. Have looked in all stores and online - nothing! Not very good  without light bulbs !!</li>
    <li> Happy with purchase!  This is a great little make up mirror, no complaints! Bright lights and dual sided magnified mirror.</li>
    <li> This is a mirror that I have used for many years and my old one wore out, so I purchased this one, I love this style of mirror..</li>
    <li> Not bulky so it is great for travel or home. Very bright and the magnification is perfect. Would highly recommend this product. .</li>
    <li> Best small mirror I ever had I can set it right on about anything and it stays there and those small lights in it are just the right brightness sure wish I could of found this a long time ago.</li>
    <li> This is a perfect replacement for my very old makeup mirror.  I was surprised to still be able to find this style. The lighting makes it so easy to see every detail, and it&#x27;s light and compact to even take on vacation!</li>
    <li> Love this mirror, The lights are bright(but not too bright), the mirror had two sides one is  magnifying and it sits great on my vanity. The mirror swivels well and stays where you angle it. I really love it , use it everyday.</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 of these mirrors for my preteen granddaughters for Christmas.  I know they both will love them alot.</li>
    <li> This just goes to show you that it is not a good idea to buy items online without the ability to try them out first in person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I returned this mirror to Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can forget about any decent light output from the tiny 7 watt bulbs that come with the unit.  You can install up to 10 watt bulbs, but even that won&#x27;t help you very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These bulbs also give you a sickly yellow look, so you&#x27;ll feel like getting checked for jaundice if you buy this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 3X side of the mirror significantly distorts your image because it is made from what is obviously the cheapest material they could find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is fun, however, to spin the mirror around on its little axis and the little wheel on/off switch is quite entertaining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, it does offer some good points, but just not as a makeup mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot recommend this mirror in any way unless you simply don&#x27;t have the money to buy a decent one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What can I say?  $20 including shipping and tax.  You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Can not wait to use it.</li>
    <li> I just love it. I keep it in my desk drawer. When i go to the office really early it helps me polish my look before others arrive!</li>
    <li> I still have it and it works great I just wish it had a carrying case.</li>
    <li> This item was sent back because the lights are wrong you cant see your mirrored image because the light are on the mirror it destroys the image some much you can see.</li>
    <li> it is perfect for any vanity table to apply makeup or twiz those eye brows or whatever needs to be closely scrutinized on you face. thank you for a product worth the money</li>
    <li> Purchased mine in December. It&#x27;s May and everything is still perfect. Good item at a good price. I would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had this mirror for about a week, but so far so good. I love the way it looks on my countertop in the bathroom. Would also complete the look on any vanity. Since it&#x27;s white, it goes with basically any décor. Firstly, I was very pleased at the shipment speed of this item, even though I opted for free shipping. That was such a bonus! Then, to be totally pleased with the product, makes me one happy woman. Thanks!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve wanted mirror like this one for quite sometime. Since I was a little girl, actually, but I&#x27;ve never seen one like this in any store near me. They&#x27;re all tall standing mirrors, that may swivel, but mostly didn&#x27;t have much to speak of in the way of lighting. I love the lower profile of this one and it&#x27;s simple design.</li>
    <li> Nice size for the vanity brite and stays where u put it</li>
    <li> Its A Great Mirror, Really Bright and Good Quality plus It does Exactly what i need... Its The Best Mirror For The Price... I&#x27;m Really Happy with It!</li>
    <li> awesome it made me happy in my pants.. i will never need another mirror again.. i look so great it hurts</li>
    <li> Not as bright as everyone suggested​.</li>
    <li> I am happy with this, I do wish that it was a little bigger or taller but other than that I am happy with it.</li>
    <li> This is a great make-up mirror, it is very bright. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it was that it has a cord instead of running on batteries but it is great for the price.</li>
    <li> This mirror does exactly whats expected, I love it and am happy with my purchse! Be aware if you have little ones the bulbs get HOT so watch little hands other than that i haven&#x27;t had any other issues.</li>
    <li> Great product very convenient nice light strength</li>
    <li> Bought for granddaughter so she would have her own.  But she was unhappy about light bulb going out.  Other then that she liked it</li>
    <li> Great mirror for the price. I love it use it everyday!</li>
    <li> Just received the mirror,perfect for the job</li>
    <li> I had a make-up mirror like this yrs ago and when it kicked the bucket I went to Wal-Mart and couldn&#x27;t find anything even similar. I purchased one they had in stock, which was much taller, and heavier, and didn&#x27;t like it at all. After recently seeing this one on Amazon, I purchased it immediately, and gave the one I had to my daughter. This tabletop mirror is the best and magnifies perfectly for plucking eyebrows or applying make-up. The bulbs last quite awhile as well.</li>
    <li> Great smaller mirror. I wish it were a little brighter but it works great. I wanted a smaller size.</li>
    <li> There are expensive mirrors out there, so for the price this one does the job.. There are reviews regarding how hot it is, and its true, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me. I use it for tweezing facial hair and eyebrows, it&#x27;s good enough for that.</li>
    <li> I obviously love this make up mirror by my title!!! I had one that was very much like this and it as manufactured by Windmere. It broke last year when I went to Europe. Even with an adaptor the electric blew on the mirror. I looked and looked for a replacement. I went to my local Ulta store and they carried this mirror by Jerdon, but they were sold out for the holidays, so I turned to AMAZON and was thrilled to find this mirror! The delivery time was very prompt!!!!&lt;br /&gt;After my Windmere mirror broke I purchased another make up mirror that was 2.5 times the cost and side view mirrors and different settings for light. I DID NOT LIKE the new mirror. Too bulky to pack and too neavy to pick up and hold in one hand while I put on my mascara. The mirror by Jerdon I can use and pick up easliy to put on my mascara, the lighting is bright and I LOVE IT!!! The mirror is small enough to pack and IT DOES NOT TAKE UP SO MUCH COUNTER SPACE!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I was so thrilled to find the product that I purchased two of them!!!&lt;br /&gt;i am sure that you will not be disappointed!!!!</li>
    <li> The mirror is great, the lights are perfect. I would recomend it to anyone. The magnification&lt;br /&gt;is just right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elaine</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter to go on her new vanity.....great price....quick shipping....solid quality.....works well. My daughter loves it and it keeps my bathroom clean as she now has a vanity and a great mirror to do her make-up...contacts etc</li>
    <li> I ordered this and didn&#x27;t realize that the magnification was not great. I would not recommend this for anyone who wears glasses or is older or does not have perfect eyesight. Even with perfect vision, the magnification isn&#x27;t great. Maybe for a starter mirror for teens with great eyes? I do not recommend this. I prefer this type over the round type, but this type at a good magnification is hard to find. But this isn&#x27;t magnified enough for anyone.</li>
    <li> use it for trips  handy</li>
    <li> I bought this for somebody in the hospital after their stroke. The lights were a plus for them and so was the 3X magnification. Has a switch on the cord to turn off if you don&#x27;t want to unplug each time. It&#x27;s lightweight and has a metal stand that is good for stability/tilt. The mirror is regular on one side and 3X on the other, it swivels easily. Can&#x27;t beat the price of around $15.00.</li>
    <li> I love the idea but it&#x27;s Hot under the lights, I want to use it more but I have to have a fan.&lt;br /&gt;good if you have AC or a fan.</li>
    <li> The overall size and design are okay, but the light is way too dim and too yellow. Unlike the photo where the mirror gives out this bright light that resembles day light, the mirror actually gives out a yellowish light that cannot even lighten up your entire face. You don&#x27;t  want to put on makeup under this sick, yellowish light, you will end up with horrible makeup for sure. Returning it, will try another brand.</li>
    <li> This mirror is amazing! The only complaint I have is that the lights are extremely bright. Other than that, this mirror has been a true lifesaver. I have used it to apply my make-up, and for the price, it is the best product out there. Expedient shipping and I received it the week after. I would recommend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> Looked for several months for a reasonably priced, small makeup mirror for application of eye makeup.  I like this mirror because I can pack it for travel, it does not take up a big space on the vanity, it has a magnification mirror, the lights are strong enough that I see how to trim brows and apply eyeliner and it is inexpensive!!</li>
    <li> I knew I wasn&#x27;t buying the best out there, but the reviews were still pretty decent for this mirror and the cost was budget friendly. However, it was still below expectation for what I was hoping... As other reviews mentioned: the lights get hot, really hot, very fast (but they do cool quickly once you turn them off) but so long as you&#x27;re not already sweltering or in a hot room, it&#x27;s not too terrible. For me, the bummer was that the lights are not nearly as bright as I&#x27;d hoped they&#x27;d be and other reviewers had mentioned. They aren&#x27;t the worst, but in a dim room, they don&#x27;t have much umph. (they also put out a very warm, yellow light - not as white as the picture suggests - just fyi). My other major qualm is with the mirror itself, the magnified side is very distorted - not like a good quality mirror when you&#x27;re not close enough... this is more fun-house style distorted.&lt;br /&gt;Not terrible for the price but if you&#x27;re okay with spending an extra 10-20 bucks, I&#x27;d go for something a little better.</li>
    <li> I always wanted a vanity light to help me put on makeup in the morning when it&#x27;s still dark. I love this light and mirror. Gets hot quick as expected. Great purchase.</li>
    <li> I use this when I travel as it packs well and yet is still a good enough size for seeing. the only issue I have is that it gives off a lot of heat. I try not to use it in hot places as it makes me really hot. I also have rosacea and heating up my face is not a good thing. Other than that its a good product. Very lightweight, and a bit cheap feeling, but it was a very cheap lamp.</li>
    <li> The lamps are too hot to get close to the mirror for fine work, whether it be eyeliner or tweezing.</li>
    <li> I thought the mirror would be alittle bigger than what it was.  Also the light does not seem very bright.</li>
    <li> It was the worst lighting ever. I couldn&#x27;t see how anyone could apply makeup with that mirror if they tried. It isn&#x27;t worth anything at all. It isn&#x27;t worth even 1 star</li>
    <li> My youngest granddaughter has just begun to wear make up.  She&#x27;s very good at putting on the right amount for her age, but I thought the lighted mirror would make it easier.  I had one when I was young and liked it.</li>
    <li> I got this for my daughter for Christmas.  Just got it and tried it out.  I&#x27;m sure it will be fine for her (she&#x27;s 13) and it was cheap, but it is a little on the small side and the lights--though bright--are rather yellow for getting a good feel for how your makeup will look in real lighting.  The magnified side of the mirror is fine for looking at specific areas of the face but it&#x27;s distorted to look at your whole face at once.  Then again, I don&#x27;t think most people should look at their face in a magnified mirror because it just makes us feel bad about things that no real encounter with another human will ever see. Probably wouldn&#x27;t get it again, but won&#x27;t bother sending it back...</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror for traveling. I used it for the first time two weeks ago. One light bulb turned black immediately. The other three just blew out completely.  Arrived home today and tried replacing the bulbs. The mirror does not work at all. I still have an old jerdon mirror that I use. Please advise as to what needs to be done to obtain a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;Diane Guiliano</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good, little more modern, lighted mirror. I love this 1. When I got it in &amp; my 16 year old daughter saw it, &amp; I had to order another 1 for her.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a moderately priced mirror with lights, because I didn&#x27;t have great lighting in the apartment. This did exactly what I needed it to do.</li>
    <li> Great! But I find that the light makes my makeup look good in the mirror but in natural light......not so much.</li>
    <li> I had an old one that had discolored and the bulb finally went after some 14 years!  Couldn&#x27;t find a new bulb so looked for a &amp;#34;similiar&amp;#34; one - found this one, exactly what I needed.</li>
    <li> For the low cost you get high power.  One of my bulbs in my old one burned out and it was easier to buy another mirror than look forever for a replacement bulb</li>
    <li> This is perfect for a desk...on the smaller size then what I used to have but works just as great without taking up the space</li>
    <li> Great for travel. Really like</li>
    <li> Now I want one for myself.</li>
    <li> I was happy with he delivery and product.Thanks so much....Have not used it yet since I had surgery and one hand in a cast for 4 months,but I look forward to it</li>
    <li> I choose this rating because the product was just what I wanted and expected.&lt;br /&gt;I love the product, and would recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> The size is perfect, the lighting is pretty good also, but the mirror itself is wavy on the most magnifying side. It sometimes makes me feel a little dizzy and I have to look away because it makes me feel like I want to throw up. I thought about sending it back but I need a lighted makeup mirror of this size and style to fit my dressing table.</li>
    <li> Quick shipping and it has the BEST lighting!&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the bulbs are exposed. But it&#x27;s really not that big of a deal because it doesn&#x27;t get that hot</li>
    <li> I had one of these wonderful mirrors many years ago. I wore it out as I took it traveling with me.  Lucky for me....I found another one on Amazon. Always find what I need on Amazon...no matter what it is.&lt;br /&gt;The bulbs stay much cooler so that you can put it away right after you use it instead of waiting for it to cool.&lt;br /&gt;I glued a stronger magnifying mirror to the front mirror for needed help. It has a nice stand in the back&lt;br /&gt;and you just swivel the mirror part around for the stronger magnification.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> My mirror arrived fast and without a scratch. It was well packed and was just what I was looking for. Very please with the price also, I was amazed at how much make up mirrors were in the stores. Even with shipping I saved money!</li>
    <li> Present for my mom ... she likes it ... wants a bigger mirror but thought this was nice</li>
    <li> My granddaughter was delighted with this mirror.  It was well worth the price.  She is just starting to use makeup and can easily use this product.  It is a good size, the lights are bright and she enjoys using it.</li>
    <li> What a great little mirror, at a great little price.  I didn&#x27;t want to go all out on this item as I was not sure she would even use it.  It is way better than I would&#x27;ve expected at the price, and it fits on a bookshelf which is perfect for her.  I do wish I could find a similar one without the magnifying feature.  I don&#x27;t think any of us need to see our faces blown up that big.  From my own experience it can lead to a lot of unnecessary picking and fussing that can drag out getting ready, so if anyone knows of this style of makeup mirror, with lighting but not magnifying, please let me know.  She is very pleased with it though.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something smaller. The mirror is pretty large. If it was more attractive on my table top, I would have kept it. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s pretty cheap looking as well. I ended up returning it.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I needed. It gives off so much light you know exactly what your ma,eup look like..</li>
    <li> I bought two of these mirrors for Christmas gifts.  For the cost I feel they were a great deal for my teen and preteen daughters.  No complaints as of yet!</li>
    <li> I have blepharitis which is basically gunk in my eyes and have to squirt them clean at least twice a day....this mirror is hot, annoying if the bulbs burn out and cheap BUT it&#x27;s the BEST travel mirror EVER.  I traveled all over Mexico with it for over six months and was duly able to clean my eyes out every where.  Had one for years and am excited to have found it to reorder!  You&#x27;ll definitely love it for it&#x27;s compact size and amazing bright lights. Oh, and I headlined my review with a \\&quot;year,\\&quot; because it went back with me twice more!</li>
    <li> Yes, it&#x27;s cheap but folds up easily and can re-box if you don&#x27;t have much tabletop space. Bulbs are 7 watts x 4 of them.A tad too much glare but may unscrew one or two bulbs next time I use... or look for smaller watt bulbs Worth the money as is.</li>
    <li> This product was a gift for my mom and it really helps her with all the feminine things, and you just feel great looking in it!!!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my grandaughters birthday and it is perfect for her room.  I only gave it 4 stars because the light bulbs are very difficult to get out to replace.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great for traveling.....I couldn&#x27;t see in a regular mirror any longer.</li>
    <li> Great make-up mirror. I am completely satisfied.</li>
    <li> I like it a lot but sometimes I get glare from the lights.  I will use it alot nice addition to the bath room.</li>
    <li> This is one of the worst shopping on line mistakes that I made because I could see, touch and operate/analyze it&#x27;s performance. I will not be shipping back because it&#x27;s not even worth paying shipping. Another item to donate. IRS hates me because of my charitable donations, deductions, lol...</li>
    <li> Product looked great came really quick great price very satisfied this is a great starter mirror for my teen daughter.</li>
    <li> For the price, this is a great makeup mirror.  The lights are warm, but I don&#x27;t spend more than 10 minutes in front of it, so it&#x27;s fine.  Magnification is not as great as some, but for everyday, it&#x27;s a good size and a very bright mirror for getting the job done!</li>
    <li> When I plugged it it explode .. I dont know what to do .. what makes it worse is that I ordered two !!!</li>
    <li> Oh my word, I love it. I did not think this mirror would be large enough. To my surprise. , its just right. I am buying these as Christmas gifts. Absolutely beautiful. It functions very well. I needed it to put on my Clown Make up as well as regular cosmetics. It makes me feel Special , like a Star.</li>
    <li> The mirrors were distorted; I could not see clearly in either side of the mirrors.  I replaced my &amp;#34;Mirror Go Lightly&amp;#34; with this version as they looked exactly the same which they were except for the distorted mirror.  In lieu of sending it back, I was able to take the mirror off my old one and put it in the Jerdon.  If I had not been able to replace the mirror, I definitely would have returned it.</li>
    <li> The bulbs are really yellow. So when i put gold eye shadow, I have no idea how yellow my eyes are. I will get white bulbs.</li>
    <li> Love the price of this mirror, only downfall is that since the lights aren&#x27;t covered they let off alot of heat when your face is close to the mirror. This concerns me because I wear fake eyelashes and don&#x27;t want them singed!</li>
    <li> My pricier Jerdon mirror&#x27;s bulbs went out and instead of trying to find replacements I ordered this one. It&#x27;s ok. The bulbs get really hot quickly so if you&#x27;re close to the mirror you&#x27;re going to start to sweat. But I suppose it&#x27;s OK for the price.</li>
    <li> Wow the lights on this mirror INTANTLY heat up. If you&#x27;re a naturally cold person you will love this. The lights are pretty bright. After using the mirror it takes a second for my eyes to readjust to the regular lighting in the room. You can see every flaw in your face when using this mirror---could be a good or a bad thing. The lighting in my house isnt that great, and it was making it hard to tell if I was blending my makeup well enough or not.... This mirror sure helps with that problem. lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mirror is about the size of a spiral notebook, and then a couple inches thick....makes it very compact to travel with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because the lights get so freaking hot I will deduct a star, but other than that I like it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have a bright room so this works PERFECTLY so i can see my make up and what i&#x27;m doing. I love this so much.. the lights are kinda bright at first but you get used to them. also the mirror flips and magnifys so i love it. I would tell a friend.</li>
    <li> The lighting is excellent. It is perfect for daytime or evening makeup. I have tried other makeup mirrors, and this is the best for me.</li>
    <li> This product is adquate, if like me, you never owned a vanity mirror.  It is small, but placing it on a box or something will help.  The lights are yellowish, but adequate.  And, I found out it would have been cheaper to buy it from a beauty supply store, like Ulta.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice lighted make-up mirror I will give to 19 yr old grand-daughter .  I know she will just love it as it looks very nice and the lighting is good.</li>
    <li> I purchased this mirror especially for travel.  I was looking for a make-up mirror with a magnifying side, like the one that I use everyday, except smaller so that I can take it with me when I travel.  This one is perfect.  It is lightweight and doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of room in my suitcase.  The lights are bright and they do get warm, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me.  I wouldn&#x27;t use a mirror this small for everyday use, but for travel it is great.</li>
    <li> the on/off switch should be on the unit  itself not on the cord, its hard to reach because it hangs down with the cord. But the lighting is great......</li>
    <li> I was not as happy with this item because it was much smaller than the original I was replacing.  I have it and use it but prefer my old one that is one third larger.</li>
    <li> this mirror is amazing! so, i got it a day earlier when it was supposed to come, i got it on wedsenday &amp; it was supposed to come on thursday.. so thats so good. &amp; um, so i make youtube videos &amp; plus i have terrible eye sight lol i wear glasses &amp; its hard for me to see when I&#x27;m doing my makeup so i bought this so i can zoom in with the 3x mirror... or out. the only thing i don&#x27;t like it the stand.</li>
    <li> needs to magnify larger</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. The mirror is good quality but she didn&#x27;t like the lighting color (yellowish) and the size is smaller than was expected. As a result we returned the mirror.</li>
    <li> Really great mirror, took off one star due to one bulb was nearly burned out when I received and was only on a few seconds.  Could not find the bulbs locally at Walmart, Home Depot, or Lowes so had to order from Amazon.  Cheap enough but worth it for an inexpensive mirror that you can actually see very well using.</li>
    <li> This product was more than I expected it to be.  It is exactly like the one I owned years ago and is still made of the &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; stuff.  Regular on one side and 3X larger on the other.  Perfect for people with poor eyesight to put contacts in or make-up on and to see any and all the imperfections that you might want to hide/cover up.  My original had two blown bulbs and I could never replace them.  In these days of modern technology, I not only can replace them, but, I still love the price.  Thank you for making such a wonderful product and keeping it that way.  I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a lighted mirror and I think it would be a great gift!</li>
    <li> My house doesnt have mirrors that are bright enough to do my makeup so every time I did it and went out, it looked terrible and I had to always fix it in the car. Love this mirror. It fulfills all my needs and its small and compact to travel with.</li>
    <li> For the price, you can&#x27;t beat having this product. I say this, when I first turn it on, it is blinding. It does serve the intended purpose though.</li>
    <li> THIS MODEL HAS BEEN AROUND FOR MORE THAN 30 YEARS.  I HAD THIS MODEL FOR THAT LONG AND IT FINALLY STARTED GIVING ME PROBLEMS WITH THE ON/OFF SWITCH.  RATHER THAN RISK AN ELECTRICAL PROBLEM I DECIDED TO REPLACE IT.  VERY THRILLED TO FIND THE EXACT SAME MODEL AT AMAZON!  SOME REVIEWS SAY THE BULBS GIVE OFF TOO MUCH HEAT.  IT DOESN&#x27;T TAKE ME MORE THAN 5 MINUTES TO PUT ON MY MAKEUP SO I NEVER NOTICED THE HEAT.  IT IS VERY STURDY AND HAS PLENTY OF LIGHT AND THE IN CORD ON/OFF SWITCH. MY OLD ONE WAS A TORTOISE COLOR THAT WENT VERY NICE IN MY BEDROOM.  THE WHITE IS OK.  SILVER WOULD BE MORE GENERIC AND WOULD MATCH MY PHONE AND ALARM CLOCK.</li>
    <li> This is a great product works perfect for me.the price is very fair too.Came in the mail pretty fast.Thanks again</li>
    <li> Still trying to find replacement bulbs</li>
    <li> When I turned this on I was so pleased to see that the light was so bright and natural. My vision is very poor but the magnification lets me get things right without my glasses. There isn&#x27;t a harsh glare or off color tint.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great mirror, but the lighting was just a little too yellow for me. My teen daughter loves it though and uses it all the time. I guess I&#x27;m used to a whiter, brighter light.</li>
    <li> good for make up on face</li>
    <li> this makeup mirror is awesome . Its very easy to pack and lighting is just right for apply makeup. I use this in my dressing room for theater shows and its amazing . This is a great purchase .</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my Jerdon I had had for several years that has the different light settings, a larger mirror with side panel mirrors as well, but didn&#x27;t want to spend as much. This will do. It gets the job done I will admit. I wish the lighting wasn&#x27;t so \\&quot;natural\\&quot; though. When I think of my makeup mirror, I&#x27;m not looking for romantic mood lighting for my den, I&#x27;m looking for something to light my face up good and bright. This light is very mood worthy and a bit yellow caste. I wanted something like bright daylight close to blue almost so the colors aren&#x27;t distorted making you look tanner than you are. It doesn&#x27;t screw with your makeup or anything but I do personally prefer a true blue/white light up mirror, such as my previous Jerdon had. The photo of it also gives the impression that it&#x27;s a brighter whiter light than it really is. It is very nifty looking with the chrome behind the naked bulbs, which is fancy and cooler looking than the other Jerdon though. But because the bulbs are exposes, while chic, it gets pretty warm sitting in front of this thing. It could be a little sturdier maybe. But you get what you pay for and it&#x27;s worth $15 I will say.</li>
    <li> Not enough magnification for me. It&#x27;s just my eyes don&#x27;t see as well as I get older. Good mirror if you have decent eye sight.</li>
    <li> I have used this several times since it arrived and love it.  The size is compact so easy to store when not in use. I have limited counter space.</li>
    <li> When it arrived I was shocked to find that it wasn&#x27;t as large as I had thought when I ordered it -- but I really like that now!  It doesn&#x27;t take up that much space and it&#x27;s really bright.  I like that it has a on/off button, too.  Nice price. Well worth it.</li>
    <li> I got it, then put it up and don&#x27;t use it. It&#x27;s hard to see yourself because the lights are a weird color and are right in your eyes. I tried taking a couple of the lights out but that didn&#x27;t work either.</li>
    <li> bought for our granddaughter for Christmas. she loves to play with makeup and enjoys this bright light to see how she looks.</li>
    <li> It is light weight and works well--just a tiny bit small.  The lighting is really good though,</li>
    <li> I really like this make up mirror.  I was a little disappointed by the size and the fact that you have to set it on top of something in order to see in it as it sits really low. (I put it on top of my vanity with a box underneath it to bring it higher up).  But as I wear single vision contacts (and have to wear reading glasses with them in order to see up close) the magnifying size is perfect. It allows me to see everything without having to take out my lenses.  The small size makes it great for travel.  I have read other reviews that complain about the heat from the lights but I haven&#x27;t really experienced that.  All in all good for the money, but would have preferred it to be larger or at least have the capability to stand in vertical position.</li>
    <li> Small enough to setup on table, but large enough to to see and do make up. Light is good but my need more.</li>
    <li> Its compact design and clear view make it a must for the beautification daily process.  It was something I thought she would like....surprisingly she did.</li>
    <li> These mirror are harder to find than I anticipated, my daughter wanted one for Christmas. I found one Amazon, just the right size and polis&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daughter wanted one for Christmas, and had a little trouble finding one, especially for a teenager. I didn&#x27;t what to spend to much.  This one fit the bill, everyone was happy.</li>
    <li> The lights are pretty bright, although they give off a yellow light, which can be annoying when trying to put on foundation and since the lights are positioned on either side of the mirror if you get too close, to &amp;#34;pick at your face&amp;#34; (as I call it) or to apply liner, a shadow projects across other half of your face making it hard to compare eyes. For the price its okay, but next makeup mirror I&#x27;m just going back to the Conair lighted pedestal mirror. The lighting was better, and I didn&#x27;t find myself slouching in my chair as much since it is positioned higher other than just sitting on my makeup counter. I would say the Conair is worth the extra 5-10 dollars, and it comes with 5X magnification.</li>
    <li> It is not very bright. Not very strong. Don&#x27;t sit on table for correct access to see. Used it once then stuck it in drawer and went an bought one from local retailer.</li>
    <li> My teenager loves it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this mirror as a spare so I have not used it yet.  I like this type mirror because I can sit it on my lap instead of standing to put on makeup.</li>
    <li> it was smaller than i thought it would be but for 14 dollars i guess it can work.&lt;br /&gt;the light bulbs give off a glare that&#x27;s not as favorable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave my mom a lighted mirror that&#x27;s a little better quality. It had different setting where this one doesn&#x27;t the mirror flips from top to bottom not side to side where you can get different side views which i prefer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The light bulbs are hot.</li>
    <li> This tabletop 2-sided lighted mirror replaces an almost identical one that I broke. I am so glad I found this mirror to replace it. It is so handy to use anywhere. I would recommend it to anyone who likes the convenience and mobility it provides.</li>
