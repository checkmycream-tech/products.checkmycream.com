### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The lavender scent can be best described as laundry detergent smell.</li>
      <li>The salts smell wonderful and do help me with my relaxation</li>
      <li>Baths are the best treatment during the week to ease my issues.  </li>
      <li>She said they were the best bath salts she had ever had.  </li>
      <li>My husband also tells me how good I smell when I&#x27;m done, and he never notices anything like that!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Would make a good foot soak salt too!</li>
      <li>On the plus side, my husband smells great.</li>
      <li>I love these bath salts they are wonderful</li>
      <li>These are the very best lavender bath salts I&#x27;ve ever used, and I hope that Amazon gets more in stock soon.</li>
      <li>It has a pleasant fragance and eases my pain.  </li>
      <li>Lot of people seem to have good experience with them, and I am not going to disagree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy</li>
      <li>This product smells mineral-y and flower-y and does a good job of silkening my toes and soles.  </li>
      <li>Great product and very good price and fast shipping.</li>
      <li>Nice way to take a relaxing bath.</li>
      <li>Honestly I am unimpressed.</li>
      <li>and it felt like I was just sitting in warm water.</li>
      <li>These are actually really nice bath salts.  </li>
      <li>I love bath salts and these were amazing.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the best deal out there as far as cost, and I like the way it works.</li>
      <li>This is a great product and has a very relaxing scent to it.</li>
      <li>She also said they had such a wonderful fragrance</li>
      <li>I love the fragrance and how it does soften the water.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t get any more benefit from these than i did with just epsom salts.  </li>
      <li>Fantastic!</li>
      <li>I aim for a weekly soak, and I can tell when I don&#x27;t get it - my skin gets rougher and stress affects me more.  </li>
      <li>I have been doing so most Sunday afternoons for a couple of years now, and I use Masada Bath Salts&#x27; Lavender.  </li>
      <li>I am not purchasing this product again for sure.</li>
      <li>However, the scent is not as overbearing and in fact, quite relaxing for lack of better word.</li>
      <li>All the whatever ingredients will turn you into a magical unicorn too.  </li>
      <li>To top it all off, it gave me diarrhea and a stomach ache</li>
      <li>Maybe the salts have some magical benefit.  </li>
      <li>Salts have a nice level of scent and dissolve quickly.</li>
      <li>The lovely bonus is the fantastic, natural-smelling lavender aroma.</li>
      <li>skin is soft, I smell really good, and I fall asleep easily (sometimes in the bathtub, which is another review all</li>
      <li>I bought these for a huge party I was having.</li>
      <li>but it wasn&#x27;t particularly cheap, so I looked online for bulk, unscented salt instead.  </li>
      <li>As an allergy sufferer, a lot of floral scents can set off a sneezing fit, but this one doesn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Amazon please never stop carrying this product, especially continue to offer a great discounted price.  </li>
      <li>and I have enjoyed them so very much.  </li>
      <li>A bit pricy, but worth it!</li>
      <li>I say, it is worth giving it a try because you may enjoy it too.</li>
      <li>They ask you to use 1-2 cups per bath, and honestly, you can go through the whole 64 ounces pretty quickly.</li>
      <li>I bought Masada Bath Salts as a way to reach the $25 super saver shipping offer, I had read about them being the highest quality</li>
      <li>you get an even better price &amp; can set when &amp; how often to get a new supply.</li>
      <li>me: Happily picking up little stones in NY.</li>
      <li>But for the price they aren&#x27;t really worth it.  </li>
      <li>I thought this was going to be fun.</li>
      <li>and now everyone makes fun of me at school.</li>
      <li>These bath salts are wonderfully relaxing, contain just the right amount of lavender and are a bargain compared to purchasing them in smaller sizes at other stores.</li>
      <li>but, unfortunately, is no longer available.&lt;br</li>
      <li>is the first time I tried bath salts.</li>
      <li>Four stars only because I&#x27;ve had slightly more fragrant bath salts.  </li>
      <li>Masada&#x27;s scent is preferable to me and the smaller packaging is convenient but for those on a budget like me, cheaper alternatives can keep the healthy practice going.</li>
      <li>I first purchased this in February for around $15 with Subscribe and Save.</li>
      <li>so hot soaks in tub are a neccesity and lavendar</li>
      <li>if I had to use 1-2 cups, it seems like a lot to use for so much money!</li>
      <li>I look forward to taking a hot bath with this product.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve gotten pretty good at pulling nurse duty for her (ironic, since she&#x27;s been an actual nurse for more than a decade now) and have gotten taking care of her down pat when these issues arise.  </li>
      <li>thing you notice right away is the salts dissolve much faster than other salt crystals never leaving hard deposits on the bottom of the tub, the infused scents are much more powerful and soothing and you really get a very large amount of salts for a good price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>You can use pretty much any epsom salt to soak for pain relief, and this one doesn&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
      <li>fact that they are actually imported and extracted from the dead sea, you can tell by the way the water feels softer from them dissolving that these are very good and high quality</li>
      <li>Way too much perfume.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t really feel anything</li>
      <li>Im very satisfy with Masada Bath Salts, I would like to make another business again.</li>
      <li>masada bath salt makes your water feel softer and the lavender smell really relax your body.</li>
      <li>/&gt;These bath salts really irritated my skin and did not soften the bath water.</li>
      <li>There simply is no other lavender bath soak like this, and the price is VERY reasonable, especially if you do Amazon Prime or get the over $25 free shipping.</li>
      <li>As far as bath salts go, these add a good scent to your otherwise vapid bathing experience.</li>
      <li>I resonate to this particular scent, and when I&#x27;m soaking, it permeates my nose.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend for relaxing and soothing away the day&#x27;s stresses.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t get us high at all.</li>
      <li>Also, I really like how soft my skin is when I get out of the tub.  </li>
      <li>I grabbed a new Dr. Scholl&#x27;s foot soak massage unit and needed a soak solution.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product for relief from all forms of muscle aches and fatigue, and also to clear your sinuses for allergies and headaches.</li>
      <li>is a very soft relaxing scent that calms and helps with sleep.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t feel much different compared to plain warm water.</li>
      <li>B000IMXVNI Masada Bath Salts, Relaxing Lavender, Dead Sea Mineral, 64 Ounces (1.814 kg)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading most of the reviews on the above product, I was \\&quot;sold\\&quot; and very eager to try it and ordered this product on Amazon.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>after a hard day at work, when i ache all over, these salts in a hot bath soothe my muscles and relax me so i can enjoy my night...</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know about men, but as a woman who can&#x27;t use bubble bath products because it causes irritation in certain submerged areas, this causes the same problem.</li>
      <li>I can handle lightly scented products but this one is heavily perfumed.</li>
      <li>This product caused me to eat my friends alive.</li>
      <li>In fact, I&#x27;m ecstatic that Amazon offers them for sale, because my long-time distributor is no longer carrying them.  </li>
      <li>I just scoop a cup into an old plastic jar.</li>
      <li>I have bathed in these for 20 minutes and enjoyed the experience as they made my skin soft, at least during the time I was in the bathtub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My only real dislike is that these (even the big jugs) don&#x27;t really go very far since each bath is 16oz of salt.</li>

<li> These bath salts are instrumental for relieving muscle tensions, and do their job so well that she sometimes finds it hard to get out of the tub, as she enjoys it so much.  </li>

<li> Between massages with mineral ice, these bath salts, and a heating pad, my wife felt as little discomfort as possible.  </li>
<li> I purchased these for my sister that is going through a rough time.  </li>
<li> Not sure if the label has a mis-print on the amount to use per bath, as we&#x27;ve used far less than that amount</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used other products, but always return to this brand, and this scent.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;d probably buy some epsom salts and sprinkle some lavender or some other thing in the bath.  </li>
<li> /&gt;In terms of value, I would advise you to seek out other brands or scents if you can find some that are cheaper.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love bath salts and these were amazing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what it did for me. Didn&#x27;t really feel anything and it felt like I was just sitting in warm water.</li>
    <li> These are the very best lavender bath salts I&#x27;ve ever used, and I hope that Amazon gets more in stock soon. You can use pretty much any epsom salt to soak for pain relief, and this one doesn&#x27;t disappoint. I have moderate to severe arthritis in my shoulders and up &amp; down my spine (bad genes), and I feel so much better after I get out of the tub after a long hot soak with salts. These are no exception. The lovely bonus is the fantastic, natural-smelling lavender aroma. It isn&#x27;t that \\&quot;chemical\\&quot; lavender smell you get with a lot of lavender products; this smells like someone put a million fresh-cut lavender flowers into the plastic jar. As an allergy sufferer, a lot of floral scents can set off a sneezing fit, but this one doesn&#x27;t. My husband also tells me how good I smell when I&#x27;m done, and he never notices anything like that! I have noted one or two tiny pebbles, as noted by a previous reviewer, but it&#x27;s nothing that will clog your drain, and all you have to do is chuck it in the trash. There simply is no other lavender bath soak like this, and the price is VERY reasonable, especially if you do Amazon Prime or get the over $25 free shipping. They also offer these as a subscription-- you get an even better price &amp; can set when &amp; how often to get a new supply. Fantastic!</li>
    <li> I love the fragrance and how it does soften the water.  I have fibromyalgia so hot soaks in tub are a neccesity and lavendar is a very soft relaxing scent that calms and helps with sleep. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I purchased these for my sister that is going through a rough time.  She said they were the best bath salts she had ever had.  She also said they had such a wonderful fragrance, she opened the container and placed it in her upstairs landing, the fragrance perfumed her upper landing as well as the foyer at the bottom of the stairs. She said they are heaven on your skin.  A bit pricy, but worth it!</li>
    <li> The bottle came with the lid off and salt all over the place. Will not order from these guys again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t take baths, only showers.  I grabbed a new Dr. Scholl&#x27;s foot soak massage unit and needed a soak solution.  I was using salt and baking soda and lavender oil, but hated doing the mixing - even though it is relatively cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This item does it all for me.  I think it is a bit pricey, so I only use about 2-3 tbsp of it at a time.  That will add up to about 20 foot baths or about $1 each soak.  Bed Bath and Body Works sells similar bath soak items, but for $$$.  This product smells mineral-y and flower-y and does a good job of silkening my toes and soles.  I think next time I&#x27;ll try peppermint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how it would be for bath use, but man if I had to use 1-2 cups, it seems like a lot to use for so much money!</li>
    <li> PRODUCT 3 STARS.&lt;br /&gt;This is the first time I tried bath salts. Honestly I am unimpressed. Doesn&#x27;t feel much different compared to plain warm water. I do feel stickier after the bath though because of the salt. With regard to its analgesia, I think it&#x27;s all placebo effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PACKAGING ZERO.&lt;br /&gt;Packaging is extremely poor. It was delivered with the bottle completely open, half of the contents spilled, and some leaked through the carton gaps. My concierge was so concerned when it was delivered and called me because \\&quot;white powder\\&quot; was leaking from the package. To the manufacturer, common sense and simple adhesive tape would solve this packaging issue. The bottle seal under the lid comes off easily and is useless. I am not purchasing this product again for sure.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000IMXVNI Masada Bath Salts, Relaxing Lavender, Dead Sea Mineral, 64 Ounces (1.814 kg)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading most of the reviews on the above product, I was \\&quot;sold\\&quot; and very eager to try it and ordered this product on Amazon.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These bath salts really irritated my skin and did not soften the bath water. The brand I had been using did but, unfortunately, is no longer available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worse yet, I am out some $22 since this product had been opened and does not qualify for a refund.</li>
    <li> I am a bath fanatic and I look for products that work with a spa tub - those that don&#x27;t foam and bubble.  I also like products that retain their scent through the entire bath and that soften my skin.  This product fails on both counts - there is barely any scent and it does nothing to soften the water or your skin.  I have used other products of Masada and have only been disappointed with this one, so far.</li>
    <li> My masseur recommended that I soak in dead sea salts to remove some aches and pains.  I have been doing so most Sunday afternoons for a couple of years now, and I use Masada Bath Salts&#x27; Lavender.  It&#x27;s the best deal out there as far as cost, and I like the way it works.</li>
    <li> These bath salts are wonderfully relaxing, contain just the right amount of lavender and are a bargain compared to purchasing them in smaller sizes at other stores. Highly recommend for relaxing and soothing away the day&#x27;s stresses. Try some.</li>
    <li> these are heaven in a bottle....after a hard day at work, when i ache all over, these salts in a hot bath soothe my muscles and relax me so i can enjoy my night...a definate must in my cabinet, at all times</li>
    <li> I have regular arthritis and muscle pain.  Baths are the best treatment during the week to ease my issues.  I have tried several bath products to help ease my pain and tension.  This is now the one I use exclusively.  It has a pleasant fragance and eases my pain.  I look forward to taking a hot bath with this product.  I say, it is worth giving it a try because you may enjoy it too.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and has a very relaxing scent to it. My only real dislike is that these (even the big jugs) don&#x27;t really go very far since each bath is 16oz of salt.</li>
    <li> I wish I could give this 0 stars. I bought these for a huge party I was having. I had about 20 kids over and we divided this into 3 ounce portions. We took turns smoking, injecting, and eating this. It tasted like SOAP! It didn&#x27;t get us high at all. I thought this was going to be fun. To top it all off, it gave me diarrhea and a stomach ache and now everyone makes fun of me at school.</li>
    <li> I first purchased this in February for around $15 with Subscribe and Save. The price went up to $23 with the next order and is now $32. The salts smell wonderful and do help me with my relaxation but if the price is going to be so crazy, that kinda negates the benefits. I did cancel S&amp;S and will check manually, which means I may try another product. I do like the product but not for over $30.</li>
    <li> Dead sea bath salts?  Why not.  I mean if you believe everything like i do then you&#x27;re also a sucker.      I run and work out a lot and after a long day of work am sore.  I sometimes like to just sit in the tub and soak.  These are actually really nice bath salts.  But for the price they aren&#x27;t really worth it.  I don&#x27;t get any more benefit from these than i did with just epsom salts.  They claim that the powers of nature will cure all your problems.  All the whatever ingredients will turn you into a magical unicorn too.  I don&#x27;t think i&#x27;d buy this again.  I&#x27;d probably buy some epsom salts and sprinkle some lavender or some other thing in the bath.  Same effect.      Don&#x27;t get me wrong.  Maybe the salts have some magical benefit.  I just didn&#x27;t see it.</li>
    <li> I bought Masada Bath Salts as a way to reach the $25 super saver shipping offer, I had read about them being the highest quality and my wife loves taking baths and using salts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing you notice right away is the salts dissolve much faster than other salt crystals never leaving hard deposits on the bottom of the tub, the infused scents are much more powerful and soothing and you really get a very large amount of salts for a good price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact that they are actually imported and extracted from the dead sea, you can tell by the way the water feels softer from them dissolving that these are very good and high quality salts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would always by Masada Bath Salts again and am going to try other scents in the future.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product without knowing how it works. The instructions did not warn against smoking it. This product caused me to eat my friends alive. I&#x27;d like my money back.</li>
    <li> Long ago I discovered the importance of making time in my life to relax at the end of the day.  Little did I know about the nasty joke mother nature had in store for my muscles as the years have gone by.  The answer to both of these was the Masada Bath Salts in Lavender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, they have a few little stones in the mix (pick them up and toss them out if they don&#x27;t go down the drain).  I figure that they are from the Dead Sea and there are probably rocks there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is soft, I smell really good, and I fall asleep easily (sometimes in the bathtub, which is another review all together).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon please never stop carrying this product, especially continue to offer a great discounted price.  I tell my friends about the relaxation properties of this product and explain \\&quot;Hey, it&#x27;s cheaper than a psychiatrist!\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sign me: Happily picking up little stones in NY.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Lavender Dead Sea Mineral Bath Salts for over 10 years now.  I&#x27;ve used other products, but always return to this brand, and this scent.  In fact, I&#x27;m ecstatic that Amazon offers them for sale, because my long-time distributor is no longer carrying them.  I resonate to this particular scent, and when I&#x27;m soaking, it permeates my nose.  Also, I really like how soft my skin is when I get out of the tub.  I aim for a weekly soak, and I can tell when I don&#x27;t get it - my skin gets rougher and stress affects me more.  I even take it when I travel - I just scoop a cup into an old plastic jar.</li>
    <li> I love these bath salts they are wonderful and I have enjoyed them so very much.  I would purchase again</li>
    <li> Nice way to take a relaxing bath. Salts have a nice level of scent and dissolve quickly. Product arrived promptly with no problems.</li>
    <li> Based on a trip to Israel, my wife loves these bath salts. She hinted, I bought, I&#x27;m a hero at least once a week. Neat, huh?</li>
    <li> As far as bath salts go, these add a good scent to your otherwise vapid bathing experience. The lavender scent can be best described as laundry detergent smell. However, the scent is not as overbearing and in fact, quite relaxing for lack of better word. I have bathed in these for 20 minutes and enjoyed the experience as they made my skin soft, at least during the time I was in the bathtub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of value, I would advise you to seek out other brands or scents if you can find some that are cheaper. They ask you to use 1-2 cups per bath, and honestly, you can go through the whole 64 ounces pretty quickly. These are simply scented salts and they shouldn&#x27;t cost thirty dollars. So if you can heed my advice, go for a cheaper alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if you can afford it, I would say go ahead and buy these bath salts. Lot of people seem to have good experience with them, and I am not going to disagree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy bathing fellow halophiles!</li>
    <li> I usually go with the lavender bath salt from Mistral, but since they were out of stock I figured I&#x27;d try this one. What a disappointment. It doesn&#x27;t smell anything like lavender it just smell salt period. Had to return it. Try Mistral is my advice.</li>
    <li> masada bath salt makes your water feel softer and the lavender smell really relax your body.</li>
    <li> Four stars only because I&#x27;ve had slightly more fragrant bath salts.  That said they were also more expensive.  Not sure if the label has a mis-print on the amount to use per bath, as we&#x27;ve used far less than that amount and there&#x27;s still a noticeable amount of lavender fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would make a good foot soak salt too!</li>
    <li> My wife suffers from occasional fibromiagia attacks, the last one stayed with her for a couple weeks in some degree.  I&#x27;ve gotten pretty good at pulling nurse duty for her (ironic, since she&#x27;s been an actual nurse for more than a decade now) and have gotten taking care of her down pat when these issues arise.  These bath salts are instrumental for relieving muscle tensions, and do their job so well that she sometimes finds it hard to get out of the tub, as she enjoys it so much.  Between massages with mineral ice, these bath salts, and a heating pad, my wife felt as little discomfort as possible.  I highly recommend this product for relief from all forms of muscle aches and fatigue, and also to clear your sinuses for allergies and headaches.</li>
    <li> Great product and very good price and fast shipping. Im very satisfy with Masada Bath Salts, I would like to make another business again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know about men, but as a woman who can&#x27;t use bubble bath products because it causes irritation in certain submerged areas, this causes the same problem. Way too much perfume. I can handle lightly scented products but this one is heavily perfumed. I couldn&#x27;t use it. On the plus side, my husband smells great.</li>
    <li> I bought this to help deal with some stress and I do recommend it but it wasn&#x27;t particularly cheap, so I looked online for bulk, unscented salt instead.  Masada&#x27;s scent is preferable to me and the smaller packaging is convenient but for those on a budget like me, cheaper alternatives can keep the healthy practice going.</li>
