<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I use this with the showere gel and does not feel greasy at all.  My skin is nice and soft.  I do also see some improvement of stretch marks.  definetly worth the money</li>
    <li> My bestfriend used this lotion and I tried it. I LOVE IT! It has a light pretty fragrance, and its not greasey. It leaves my skin feeling like velvet. I LOVE LOVE LOVE This product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They sell this lotion at Ultra and Target for 15, if you want to save money on shipping.</li>
    <li> Thick and creamy, absorbs well. The only downside for me was the scent which is personal so doesn&#x27;t really impact my rating. The scent does smell like flowers, but very bright, almost tangy (couldn&#x27;t come up with a better word) flowers. Like the feel of the product but would not purchase again related to the scent.</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s just me but once again I found the smell to be overpowering (just like Soap &amp; Glory Shimmering spray) but other reviewers love it. I liked the feel and consistency of the butter but once again my 12 year ended up with - she loves it.</li>
    <li> Just received on Christmas Eve.  EXTREMELY fast shipping time -- wow!!!  Just as delicious smelling as everyone says.  Smells CLEAN, like you&#x27;ve just gotten out of the shower.  Not heavy and overpowering yet the soft scent REALLY lingers.  Glad I tried this.  I think it will become a staple for me.  It absorbs fairly quickly, too.  Great great smell.  I read ALL reviews before purchasing anything I&#x27;m not totally familiar with, and all other reviewers are right on.  This stuff is WONDERFUL!</li>
    <li> Everytime I wear this product I get comments on how good I smell.  Seriously - from perfect strangers - ALL the time.  This is great stuff.  I almost don&#x27;t want people to know how good it is because I want it all to myself, ha ha :-)</li>
    <li> First off the container is WAY larger than it looks.  The cream is lovely.  My issue is that the perfume in it is too strong for me.  Most would probably love the smell.</li>
    <li> I used to love Soap &amp; Glory products and I was so excited to find them on Amazon after Target stopped carrying them. However, the most recent S&amp;G products have been more heavily scented than the ones I loved so well in the past. They still work great, but the powerful smell bothers me. I&#x27;m going to send this back...</li>
    <li> The item is amazing!! I love soap and glory, it smells so good and makes your skin so soft!! The shipping on this item was super fast! I received it way before estimated delivery time! Which just means I could use it that much sooner!!!</li>
    <li> Love Love Love the product! Lives in London years ago and slathering it on my arms and legs sent me right back home to Jolly Ol England, HOWEVER, I think I could have swam the English Channel and walked it over to America faster than the shipper sent it from the U. K.</li>
    <li> The butter is thick and is pretty good at moisturizing, although my organic shea butter is much better at moisturizing. This product has a very strong smell that I get comments on but not necessarily GOOD comments. I think it smells like my grandma, which is ok I guess but I prefer a lighter scent</li>
    <li> The marketing is definitely for a foreign audience, but don&#x27;t let that deter you. This is the best lotion I have ever used, and it&#x27;s worth every cent.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin that suffers most in wintertime. It is sensitive enough that even \\&quot;noncomedogenic\\&quot; moisturizers and products that \\&quot;won&#x27;t clog pores\\&quot; cause bumps and breakouts.    The Righteous Butter does precisely what its package claims to: leave my skin velvety smooth. It lasts for hours without the greasy residue or irritation I experience with other moisturizers. Works great on dry skin as well as right out of the bath.    This is the best butter I&#x27;ve ever tried. Perfect.</li>
    <li> makes my feet nice and soft; great for dry cracked heels</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t take the smell and the feel of the product on my skin. Too watery feeling.</li>
    <li> For the longest time i heard many people raving about this body butter and i finally decided to bite the bullet and purchase it. And im not impressed with the overall results. Supposedly &amp;#34;it smells good&amp;#34; but honestly it smells like something a 40-60yr old women would wear. Disappointed this didnt work out for me like i thought it would. Might just give it to my mom because it was quite pricy to me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m praising this body butter whenever I can, and I can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s not sold in France! It&#x27;s light, not greasy, cheap, and to be honest, guys love it too!</li>
    <li> I absolute love this product!</li>
    <li> Good product but Too long to deliver. I will not order again. There are other products that are just as good that are less costly and can arrive in less than half the time. Done waste your time or money .</li>
    <li> I like the texture of this body butter and it absorbs well. It smells too much like roses for me, though</li>
    <li> I love how rich and buttery this is and the scent is amazing. People always compliment me on how good I smell!</li>
    <li> Great product, came really fast, top of the line quality formula. Great for dry skin. As I said, the smell is AMAZING!</li>
    <li> Nice thick cream.  I don&#x27;t like the scent.</li>
    <li> Golly, this stuff is swell! Smells like heaven, thick and rich! Great price and super fast shipping.</li>
    <li> This product lives up to all the rave reviews. I love it and several friends are now converts after trying it.</li>
    <li> I live in the Northeast (Maine) needless to say in the winter I suffer with dry skin the likes of which I could create my own snowstorm just getting out of bed in the morning!  I keep &amp;#34;Flake Away Scrub&amp;#34; in my shower and when I step out of the shower &amp;#34;Soap &amp; Glory&amp;#34; gets applied immediately.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I recieved this as a gift and absolutely love it. It leaves your skin feeling so soft and it isn&#x27;t greasy like most butters. I would recommend this to anyone.  It is my new favorite line of products. I think it is very much worth the price.</li>
    <li> Soft and super moisturizing, love it!</li>
    <li> This stuff is heavenly. It is so soft and creamy and smells AMAZING.</li>
    <li> Not only is this lotion great for my skin, but I love the smell, I use it in place of perfume.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love just after one use! My skin has never felt so soft before and the smell is fabulous!!!!</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this product. the scent is addicting and it is an excellent moisturizer. I cant get enough or say enough. I really love the line and keep trying new products. the only ones I really didn&#x27;t care for were the lip balm ( too sticky) and the heating face mask(did not feel clean after). Besides that, I highly recommend this body butter, I am a sucker for lotions and creams and I am very pleased I found this one and will be sticking with it  for a long time.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. The fragrance is light and smells amazing and is very, very hydrating. I am a pretty thrifty girl who normally wouldn&#x27;t shell out $15-$20 on some body cream, but this stuff is worth every penny.</li>
    <li> As far as body butters go, this one works nicely and keeps my skin soft throughout the day, without being too thick. It also smells amazing and my husband always compliments me on the scent whenever I use it.</li>
    <li> I suffer from eczema and I&#x27;ve tried everything to help my skin be a little less dry. This stuff works. It not only smells amazing but it moisturizers without leaving your skin oily. I get compliments all the time during class because it has the loveliest smell for a lotion.</li>
    <li> I received this body butter as a gift at Christmas time and I love it! I get migraines from some smells and, although this product does have a strong smell, it doesn&#x27;t give me headaches. I also tried the sugar crush scent because I thought it might be more subtle but it&#x27;s not. I work in a hospital so I try to keep my smelliness to a minimum for our patients&#x27; sakes. I am buying more of the righteous butter because I like the scent and I still wear it at the hospital. I think it fades once it dries and it&#x27;s really the only body butter I&#x27;ve found that fully soaks in without leaving my hands greasy and oily, which makes it easier to make myself reapply throughout the day. Highly recommend this product as long as you don&#x27;t mind strong, flowery (but good flowery) smells.</li>
    <li> This is good stuff. It smells so amazing. It smells like a woman should smell. Just deeee-lightful!!</li>
    <li> The smell is heavenly!!</li>
    <li> I love it!!!!! Will be repurchasing!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Love the scent of this lotion.  The scent lasts and is strong so you don&#x27;t need to use a whole lot.  A little goes a long way and it is a wonderful moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This body butter is the best I&#x27;ve ever used! I&#x27;ve had dry, rough elbows formats long as I can remember. No cream&lt;br /&gt;Could cure that until I got a sample of this. They were instantly soft and smooth, and stayed that way! In the dry Alaska atmosphere, this stuff is a must. I use it as a night time face cream too. It also smells good.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I love the smell and how it makes my skin smell.I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I am enjoying this lotion. Leaves my hands and feet feeling soft the smell is lovely.</li>
    <li> This product is over-the-top in soothing and moisturizing the skin.  The company I went through in ordering this product has gone \\&quot;above and beyond\\&quot; to accommodate my personal needs in getting this product to me.  Not one but two staff there were on top of taking care of the last detail!!!  Including the shipping needs I had!!!!</li>
    <li> Bought this body cream on a recommendation of a friend.  Love it.  Nice smell and applies easily.  Perfect gift item.</li>
    <li> The skin on my legs is extremely dry, so I&#x27;ve tried lots of different moisturizers, but nothing really worked, so I chalked it up to old age.  Then I received a sample of The Righteous Butter, and couldn&#x27;t believe how wonderful it is, so I purchased it at Amazon.  It goes on easily, and dries in quickly, and has really worked on the dryness.  I don&#x27;t even have to use it daily, and my legs stay very smooth and moist.  It is the best body moisturizer I have ever used, so I can&#x27;t recommended it enough.  I know some people aren&#x27;t crazy about the smell, but I don&#x27;t have a problem at all.  I find it very pleasant.  It does the job, and that&#x27;s all that matters.  No more crocodile skin for me!</li>
    <li> A great moisturizer! Not greasy. Very hydrating.</li>
    <li> This lotion smells great, it feels great, it works great.  Only problem is not being able to get it locally, but Amazon does a great job of getting it from Great Britain to Missouri quickly!</li>
    <li> Thank you very much for your hounesty and speed shipping .. The product is great , the price is excellent and you r the best seller ever 😊</li>
    <li> I love the smell of it and how soft it leaves my hands. I ran out so I will be ordering some more ASAP!!</li>
    <li> This body butter is great for winter skin, and it has a lovely fresh fragrance. This is my second time to purchase this product and I highly recommend it for the winter. It&#x27;s shipped from the UK so sometimes customs slows the shipping a bit, but this past time I had it in about 8 to 10 days via USPS! I don&#x27;t know if it will make you look better naked but it sure was a relief on my dry skin.</li>
    <li> This is NOT the authentic formula. It is runny and does not absorb normally. The fragrance seems the same, but definitely either spoiled or fraudulent.</li>
    <li> I simply just bought this to prolong the smell of the &amp;#34;The Scrub of Your Life&amp;#34; wash and fell in love with it. When it&#x27;s combined with the wash, this lotion is amazing. It keeps my skin soft and smelling great throughout. I honestly only apply it once in the day whereas some other body butters don&#x27;t last long or I&#x27;ve had to apply heaps of it. It&#x27;s not really greasy and a little bit actually goes a long way! I use maybe a quarter sized amount and it covers my whole calf just fine. I wear size 6 pants if that helps with calf size.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product based on the positive reviews that it smells good, worked well and there were even some reviewers who said they were searching for this product to buy since a store discontinued. I thought I would pay the higher price since it must be an above average  product since some were searching out this product.  In my opinion,  I thought this was all around just ok.  It smelled ok and it worked ok.  Didn&#x27;t leave me with me wanting to buy more. I would not purchase again since it was unforgettable and too much for a body butter priced at just under $20. The body butters by &amp;#34;C. BoothBody Butter&amp;#34; in my opinion are above average all around. Feels amazing when you put on, smells great, comes in larger container and the price is right.</li>
    <li> Love everything about this product!!</li>
    <li> I have loved this body butter since I bought it at Target.  I smells so fresh &amp; clean.  It is one of those rare scents that I don&#x27;t get sick of smelling.  The only issue I have with it is I can&#x27;t buy it at Target anymore, &amp; they have raised the price since selling at Sephora.  Smell alone, though, I still give it 5 stars!  Also, it smells just like Miss Dior Cheri, so I wear it with that perfume all the time.</li>
    <li> I love this product but it is getting very difficult to find.  I hate that I fall in love with a product that can no longer be found at most retailers.  A word of warning, this product will grow old if not used in a timely manner and will smell awful.  That is why I am afraid to buy it from just any place.  I hate to waste good money in case it would be out dated material.</li>
    <li> I love this body lotion. It has a strong smell but in an amazing way. A little citrus &amp; sweet at the same time. It heals my skin specially in those winter months when my skin dries out a lot!</li>
    <li> There is nothing I don&#x27;t love about this body butter. Love the feel, texture, smell, etc. I will reorder long before I am out so there will be no waiting. I have used many butters, but not one compares to this one even if I have to order from UK.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my wife and she loves it!</li>
    <li> My new favorite body cream/lotion.  Had a sample, fell in love.  I take a strong diuretic so my skin can get very dry.  Smells wonderful, not overpowering though.  Sinks into skin rapidly, no greasy feel.  Will keep purchasing, love it!</li>
    <li> This stuff&#x27;s great.  Leaves the body soft but not oily.  Great fragrance too.  I use it all over.  Great on the feet as well.</li>
    <li> Love love love this body butter! Every time I wear it I get compliments.</li>
    <li> A very nice, thick body butter that leaves your skin velvety soft - just like the jar claims! The jar is decently priced for the size you get as well. The only issue I have with this product is the smell. Sometimes the smell is light and pleasant, while other times it&#x27;s very overpowering like a strong musky perfume. If you are sensitive to strong odors, I&#x27;d avoid this body butter as a precaution.</li>
    <li> This body butter is essentially perfect.  It has the perfect consistency, is delicately and beautifully scented, and it makes your skin feel great.  Soap &amp; Glory The Righteous Butter Body Butter is essential for every woman&#x27;s skin care regimen.  It&#x27;s sensuality wrapped into the perfect body butter.  My only wish is that the product shipped faster.  This product is delivered on the slow boat.</li>
    <li> Beloved amazing smell and texture. Great stuff!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have very dry skin and this really works well.  I have tried a lot of body butters and so many of them are to greasy.  This one is light and creamy.  Others I have found that are similar to this are way to expensive.  The smell is nice.  I also recommend their Hand Food hand cream.</li>
    <li> A most have that&#x27;s all that I can say smells delicious last a long time love it. Got in 3 days</li>
    <li> Love this line of products,  they smell so good! !</li>
    <li> I use it alongside the Soap &amp; Glory Clean on Me body wash, and it&#x27;s awesome.  I tend to have pretty dry skin so I always lean towards lotions, creams, or body butters that are heavier moisturizers.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been happy with this because it moisturizes well, however I do find at times it leaves my skin feeling a little greasy, so I&#x27;ve had to learn that a little bit goes a long way, at least for me. I think I&#x27;m going to pick up The Righteous Butter Lotion to use during the day, and just stick to using the body butter at night.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is wonderful,It&#x27;s a floral kind of scent with a touch of mandarin orange in there, and I do find it a little over-powering sometimes. Especially using both this body butter and the matching body wash that come within the same fragrance family.&lt;br /&gt;The tub that it comes in is larger than any other tub of body butter I&#x27;ve ever owned so I see this lasting me for a while, so the price is worth it for as much as you get.&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t take that long to get here, it was here sooner than the expected arrival date, which was nice. I had expected a little bit of a wait since it&#x27;s shipped from over seas, and it came nicely packaged and not at all damaged in any way.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;ve been very happy with this, and I will repurchase when I finish it.</li>
    <li> I am usually not a fan of things with rosewater scent, but I really do love the soft, delicate scent of this body butter. The best thing about this product is that it lives up to it&#x27;s name. It is just like smoothing butter over your body without the greasiness. It&#x27;s soft and just melts into the skin leaving it so soft. I would recommend this product to my friends and family</li>
    <li> This product is more than I expected. It spell fabulous and make my skin soo soft. I used it almost everyday. I am going to order before I run out :)</li>
    <li> Smells great and works wonderfully</li>
    <li> When receiving the shipment and found one of the pieces is broken and leaking them what was inside was stained pieces Other</li>
    <li> This is one of the best smells ever...It stays on all day and feels great.  Worth every penny.  If you love smells this is a great body butter to have.</li>
    <li> I ordered this based on the rave reviews that I read.  I&#x27;m not a fan.  The floral scent is just too overpowering.  I prefer Butter Yourself Body Cream.</li>
    <li> I was turned on to this product when it was given to me as a Christmas gift.  When I ran out, I couldn&#x27;t find it in any of the stores I usually shop.  Thanks, Amazon, for having this product available to me.  Keeps my legs &amp; arms soft.</li>
    <li> The product does what it says it will do. My skin drinks it up and feels so soft all day and night.</li>
    <li> Okay, let&#x27;s talk about what you need in a body butter. 1. Thick and moisturizing quality. 2. Delicious smell. That about covers it. This has both. My husband is obsessed and wants me to wear it always. It&#x27;s my new favorite.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a huge body butter fan--especially in winter when my skin tends to dry out.  I&#x27;m always looking for a variety of lotions and potions to make my skin feel soft and smooth and make me happy if I need a little pick up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soap &amp; Glory The Righteous Body Butter is great in the skin softening category.  It&#x27;s thick.  It goes on smooth.  It leaves my skin feeling soft and not at all greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I don&#x27;t like is the scent.  I know people love it, but to me it&#x27;s just...weird.  It&#x27;s lightly scented.  I can&#x27;t describe the smell.  I just don&#x27;t like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know I can&#x27;t wear it when the kids say &amp;#34;you stink&amp;#34; shortly after I step out of the shower.  Now, they&#x27;re kids, they overdramatize.  This body butter does NOT stink.  It just isn&#x27;t my favorite fragrance.  But I get what they&#x27;re saying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The body butter does deserve the great reviews and I really wish the scent was more to my liking.  In the mean time, I&#x27;ll stick with my unscented Clinique Body Butter.</li>
    <li> so perfect! I&#x27;m not sure how people could even rate it below a &amp;#34;5&amp;#34;. It has a very unique scent and you seriously can&#x27;t compare it to anything. It is it&#x27;s own scent. It&#x27;s very addicting. People always ask me what I&#x27;m wearing when I wear my righteous butter. And, unlike other butters, this scent truely lasts all day. I highly recommend trying this body butter!</li>
    <li> Rich and moisturizing.  Nice for hands and feet at bedtime.</li>
    <li> This lotion smells amazing: fresh and sweet. The scent is apparent, but not overpowering. I can forego wearing a perfume when I use this lotion and it lasts all day! The texture is silky and leaves my skin moisturized, again, all day! It does not make me feel oily. Love this stuff! Will repurchase!</li>
    <li> Love this! Don&#x27;t even wear perfume now ...this smells so good.</li>
    <li> A friend from England gave me a jar of this and I loved it so much, that I ordered my own!  Love the clean smell and how soft it leaves my skin.  I love this product.  It arrived on time.</li>
    <li> Smell amazing and keeps you moisturized!</li>
    <li> Love this product...love the smell. This is my favorite product</li>
    <li> Smells heavenly. I don&#x27;t need a fragrance when I wear it. Very moisturizing. Not greasy.</li>
    <li> Love this body butter.  Feels great on my skin and you only need to use a small amount.  The fragrance is great and lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I love the fragrance as it is not over board.  It lingers but doesn&#x27;t over power.  This creme is great for just dry skin.  I don&#x27;t recommend it for overly dry skin.  Use directly after bathing or showering.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a really good body butter, but in all honesty I didn&#x27;t find anything special about. It&#x27;s as good as other good quality body butters I have used before.</li>
    <li> LOVE this product. Not sure it&#x27;s authentic, because it was not sealed when i got it, but i still loved it ! would probably purchase again.</li>
    <li> I loved it so much I bought the whole line.&lt;br /&gt;This product smells very good&lt;br /&gt;i Love this product so much</li>
    <li> I have yet to find a Soap &amp; Glory product that I don&#x27;t love, but this body butter is the top of the list.  No other moisturizer comes close to the quality.  You will see a difference the first time you use it.</li>
    <li> Best lotion EVER!!!! I&#x27;m a junkie when it comes to buying products and trying new things because I&#x27;m never satisfied. Seems like my house is a store itself lol BUT once I tried this out I feel in love! Makes my skin silky and I personally love the smell. The butter don&#x27;t last me long since I use it on dry skin although it says not 2 but I also buy the lotion which lasts longer but I prefer the butter although the lotion is also great! My boyfriend loves it 2 n he never notices when I try something. He enjoys the smell and told me I feel extra soft lol</li>
    <li> How do I love this body butter, let me count the ways. I love this product. It&#x27;s not terribly thick,  yet its so moisturizing .  It sinks right in and there is no greasy feel after.  The smell is delightful, almost floral. This is my favorite body butter/lotion EVER!  Worth every penny and then some. Great product. I have sensitive and dry skin and it works like a charm!!!</li>
    <li> I love Soap &amp; Glory products, but this is by far my favorite.  The scent is soft and delicious with real lasting power, and my skin feels younger than it has since I was a kid!  I normally just pick this up at Sephora, but didn&#x27;t want to end up buying a lot of stuff I didn&#x27;t need so decided to check here first.  Saved a few dollars and the Prime shipping was extra fast because I had it in hand the very next day!</li>
    <li> Of all the body butters and lotions I&#x27;ve used lately, this is one of my favorites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Pleasant scent (that&#x27;s not overpowering)&lt;br /&gt;*Absorbs into the skin fairly easily (even if you use too much)&lt;br /&gt;*Thicker than the average lotion, but not so thick you can&#x27;t spread it&lt;br /&gt;*Doesn&#x27;t leave residue on the skin&lt;br /&gt;*Very moisturizing&lt;br /&gt;*Non-irritating&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Some of the ingredients are not ideal (including artificial fragrance and several parabens; see full list below)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Water, Shea butter, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Coconut Oil, Cocoa Seed Butter, Rosa Moschata Seed Oil, PEG-100 Stearate, Dimethicone, Fragrance, Phenoxyethanol, Dipropylene Glycol, Hexyl Cinnamal, Methylparaben, Carbomer, Propylene Glycol, Ethylparaben, Tocopheryl Acetate, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Limonene, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Potassium Hydroxide, BHT, Linalool, Benzyl Salicylate, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Geraniol, Glyceryl Acrylate/Acrylic Acid Copolymer, Tetrasodium EDTA, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Citral, Propylparaben, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Disodium EDTA, Butylparaben, Isobutylparaben.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether or not this is for you depends a lot on what sorts of ingredients you&#x27;ll accept in a bath and body product.  If you don&#x27;t mind parabens, this is wonderful.</li>
    <li> Righteous Butter body is an amazing product. Once I shower or taken a bath. This product I rub over all my body. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I love this product - it&#x27;s rich and creamy and smells like heaven!  Plus the packaging is very girly too!</li>
