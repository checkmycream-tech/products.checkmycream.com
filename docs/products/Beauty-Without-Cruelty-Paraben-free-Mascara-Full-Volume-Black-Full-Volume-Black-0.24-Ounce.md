      <li>Best mascara</li>
      <li>/&gt;Still searching for the &amp;#34;one&amp;#34; perfect, or &amp;#34;Best&amp;#34;, mascara and have gone through a lot to find the one and only!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Best of all?</li>
      <li>happy with the product</li>
      <li>This is impressive for cruelty free, I would recommend this.</li>
      <li>One of the best vegan and cruelty free products on the market.</li>
      <li>so nice to find a good, long-lasting mascara that isn&#x27;t tested on animals.</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>I freaking LOVE this mascara!</li>
      <li>If BWC created a formula that gave more volume instead of just length, I wouldn&#x27;t be opposed to that!</li>
      <li>I love this mascara!</li>
      <li>This mascara goes on nicely and adds fullness without being too clumpy.</li>
      <li>Stays nicely put.  </li>
      <li>Smooth mascara with no clumps and goes on very nicely.</li>
      <li>Dries quickly, water resistant, great for my contact lenses, lengthens lashes.</li>
      <li>Love this mascara.</li>
      <li>Ok, but won&#x27;t buy again.  </li>
      <li>This is really a lovely mascara.  </li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s cruelty free!</li>
      <li>This is quite lovely.</li>
      <li>I love the brush applicator.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m still getting used to the brush which I find fatter and thicker than most.  </li>
      <li>It goes on well, doesn&#x27;t clump, and washes off easily without having to use makeup remover.</li>
      <li>easy application and easy removal.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m giving it three stars because it is cruelty free.</li>
      <li>I wanted to love this product as I am interested in using animal cruelty free makeup</li>
      <li>If you try to apply more than one coat, your lashes will stick together in a very unflattering way.</li>
      <li>It applies robust right from the first application and isn&#x27;t wimpy and &amp;#34;watery&amp;#34; like so many.  </li>
      <li>Love this product and its totally guilt free!</li>
      <li>I have been searching far &amp; wide for a cruelty free vegan friendly mascara that looks good and gives me some volume</li>
      <li>good thing is this one doesn&#x27;t smear off, it just makes my lashes straight or flat..</li>
      <li>Right away it applied the way I want my mascara to.  </li>
      <li>I recommend you try it if you are having a hard time, as I was, to find a good, cruelty free mascara</li>
      <li>It provides a more natural look but it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes, the brush is nice and it&#x27;s five dollars less than this.</li>
      <li>Thanks BWC!</li>
      <li>After months of trying various mascaras only to have an allergic reaction to them, I am so pleased to finally be able to wear mascara again.  </li>
      <li>all be all, this BWC mascara is pretty close to it.</li>
      <li>Stays put well and doesn&#x27;t smell funny like some vegan mascaras can.</li>
      <li>It is way too bulky and I never failed to get mascara on my eyelids.</li>
      <li>I really wanted to love this... Was accidentally sent the wrong color, which I was able to keep free of charge, but every time I wore it, it seems to make my eyes burn a bit and water.</li>
      <li>However, this mascara made my eyelashes very clumpy and sticky.</li>
      <li>If you are into the whole &amp;#34;clump</li>
      <li>I have been trying different mascaras that are cruelty free.</li>
      <li>It goes on without clumping, makes my lashes really long and full, and the company doesn&#x27;t test on animals!</li>
      <li>So far, this is the first one I like.</li>
      <li>As you can imagine, this creates a snowball-effect in which I tear up, more mascara runs into my eyes, and then down my face.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know about formula&#x27;s for this particular beauty product...</li>
      <li>I apply a lot of moisturizer to my face and particularly under my eyes.  </li>
      <li>I love this mascara for about two weeks, after that it gets so dried out I can&#x27;t use it anymore.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll have to find a new vegan mascara that lasts longer.</li>
      <li>all I know is it is close to my eyeball as possible and would enjoy safer product ingredients, if possible.</li>
      <li>I tried this mascara in place of another vegan friendly one that I usually use, and while it does seem to be more volumizing than the other brand, it also made my eyes irritated.</li>
      <li>If you have sensitive eyes, this is not the product to go with.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t consider my eyes to be particularly sensitive</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m surprised others haven&#x27;t mentioned this issue.</li>
      <li>Being mature</li>
      <li>I went back to my old mascara!</li>
      <li>The big plus is all natural ingredients, no chemicals.</li>
      <li>I barely wear makeup</li>
      <li>Such a pleasure to open up a brand new mascara and not have to &amp;#34;break it in&amp;#34</li>
      <li>This is a more traditional mascara that applies fairly thickly and stiffens your lashes, unlike some vegan mascaras I&#x27;ve tried which create a softer more natural but less dramatic lash.  </li>

<li> I have long lashes</li>
<li> The only critique might be that the brush is a little too big.</li>
<li> If I can make it through the day without this happening, I find after several hours of wear it does tend to flake a little - though if it didn&#x27;t have the running/stinging issue this would not be enough to dissuade me from buying it again.</li>
<li> The formula is a bit too liquidy for me as well, takes a very long time to fully dry.</li>
<li> I usually have no problems with makeup around or near my eyes...</li>
<li> Not worth it.</li>
<li> maybe it&#x27;s a little too heavy...</li>
<li> so I don&#x27;t use this everyday.</li>
<li> and so I need only apply two or three applications for dramatic and &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34;</li>
<li> (if you work out a lot and sweat during the day, which is understandable), so that&#x27;s why I gave it the rating I did, not perfect but close enough to it.</li>
<li> Not impressive, glop&#x27;s a little when applying.&lt;br</li>
<li> I sadly will never buy this product again.</li>
<li> and I cried today and the mascara ran through my eyes and stung terribly!  </li>
<li> and I feel terrible to write this.</li>

    <li> Smooth mascara with no clumps and goes on very nicely. I love the brush applicator. The big plus is all natural ingredients, no chemicals. Love this product.</li>
    <li> so nice to find a good, long-lasting mascara that isn&#x27;t tested on animals.</li>
    <li> This is really a lovely mascara.  It applies robust right from the first application and isn&#x27;t wimpy and &amp;#34;watery&amp;#34; like so many.  I have long lashes and so I need only apply two or three applications for dramatic and &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; effect.  I&#x27;m still getting used to the brush which I find fatter and thicker than most.  Such a pleasure to open up a brand new mascara and not have to &amp;#34;break it in&amp;#34;.  Right away it applied the way I want my mascara to.  Being mature I apply a lot of moisturizer to my face and particularly under my eyes.  No problem with smudging or running with this mascara.  Stays nicely put.  100%.</li>
    <li> I freaking LOVE this mascara! Dries quickly, water resistant, great for my contact lenses, lengthens lashes. Best of all? VEGAN</li>
    <li> Ok, but won&#x27;t buy again.  Flattens the lashes even after curling them with a curler.  Not impressive, glop&#x27;s a little when applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still searching for the &amp;#34;one&amp;#34; perfect, or &amp;#34;Best&amp;#34;, mascara and have gone through a lot to find the one and only!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good thing is this one doesn&#x27;t smear off, it just makes my lashes straight or flat..maybe it&#x27;s a little too heavy...I don&#x27;t know about formula&#x27;s for this particular beauty product...all I know is it is close to my eyeball as possible and would enjoy safer product ingredients, if possible.</li>
    <li> This mascara goes on nicely and adds fullness without being too clumpy. This is a more traditional mascara that applies fairly thickly and stiffens your lashes, unlike some vegan mascaras I&#x27;ve tried which create a softer more natural but less dramatic lash.  The downside is that I find even the tiniest amount of moisture causes this mascara to run into my eyes and it stings! As you can imagine, this creates a snowball-effect in which I tear up, more mascara runs into my eyes, and then down my face. If I can make it through the day without this happening, I find after several hours of wear it does tend to flake a little - though if it didn&#x27;t have the running/stinging issue this would not be enough to dissuade me from buying it again. I don&#x27;t consider my eyes to be particularly sensitive so I&#x27;m surprised others haven&#x27;t mentioned this issue.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara for about two weeks, after that it gets so dried out I can&#x27;t use it anymore. I barely wear makeup so I don&#x27;t use this everyday. There is no reason for an $18 tube of mascara to last only a couple of weeks. I&#x27;ve even tried to replenish it with eye drops- no luck. I&#x27;ll have to find a new vegan mascara that lasts longer.</li>
    <li> easy application and easy removal. Love this product and its totally guilt free! Thanks BWC!</li>
    <li> After months of trying various mascaras only to have an allergic reaction to them, I am so pleased to finally be able to wear mascara again.  If you are allergic to beeswax, this mascara by BWC may just be what you are looking for!</li>
    <li> Love it! Stays put well and doesn&#x27;t smell funny like some vegan mascaras can. The only critique might be that the brush is a little too big.</li>
    <li> happy with the product</li>
    <li> One of the best vegan and cruelty free products on the market. I tried others which didn&#x27;t give any impact. This is quite lovely.</li>
    <li> This was bought for me as a gift and I feel terrible to write this. However, this mascara made my eyelashes very clumpy and sticky. If you are into the whole &amp;#34;clump my eyelashes into one&amp;#34; thing than this product is for you. I sadly will never buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara! It goes on without clumping, makes my lashes really long and full, and the company doesn&#x27;t test on animals! I will definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this product as I am interested in using animal cruelty free makeup and I cried today and the mascara ran through my eyes and stung terribly!  A.k.a. Not waterproof mascara!!  If you cry or plan on being in rain, avoid this mascara!</li>
    <li> This is impressive for cruelty free, I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> Best mascara and it&#x27;s cruelty free!</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this... Was accidentally sent the wrong color, which I was able to keep free of charge, but every time I wore it, it seems to make my eyes burn a bit and water. I usually have no problems with makeup around or near my eyes... The formula is a bit too liquidy for me as well, takes a very long time to fully dry.</li>
    <li> I tried this mascara in place of another vegan friendly one that I usually use, and while it does seem to be more volumizing than the other brand, it also made my eyes irritated. If you have sensitive eyes, this is not the product to go with. I also do not like the application brush. It is way too bulky and I never failed to get mascara on my eyelids. If you try to apply more than one coat, your lashes will stick together in a very unflattering way. Not worth it. I went back to my old mascara! It provides a more natural look but it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes, the brush is nice and it&#x27;s five dollars less than this. I&#x27;m giving it three stars because it is cruelty free.</li>

I recommend you try it if you are having a hard time, as I was, to find a good, cruelty free mascara</li>
    <li> Love this mascara. I have a big problem with mascara allergies and I can wear this without being itchy. The one thing i would say is it really does need to be replaces every like 4-5 months because it gets a little dry and then my eyes get itchy.</li>
    <li> I have been searching far &amp; wide for a cruelty free vegan friendly mascara that looks good and gives me some volume and although it&#x27;s not the end all be all, this BWC mascara is pretty close to it. My only reservation about it is it needs to be reapplied (if you work out a lot and sweat during the day, which is understandable), so that&#x27;s why I gave it the rating I did, not perfect but close enough to it. If BWC created a formula that gave more volume instead of just length, I wouldn&#x27;t be opposed to that!</li>
