      <li>Great sunscreen.  </li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t smell very nice either.</li>
      <li>So many wonderful oils.  </li>
      <li>So I decided to invest the $30 or so (six times the price of my Coppertone, per ounce) to see if this would be as good without all the harmful ingredients.  </li>

      <li>SO... we will spend the money to keep us all safe.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just the individual&#x27;s preference for which works best for them.</li>
      <li>Up to now I have been using Badger sunscreen and love it.</li>
      <li>but we know we have safe ingredients on and no worries about the sun.  </li>
      <li>Overall, it is the best sunscreen I have found on the market.</li>
      <li>I am allergic to most sunblocks, but not this one.  </li>
      <li>I prefer those much more.</li>
      <li>I like most of his products and know they are safe plus the price was a bit cheaper.  </li>
      <li>If anyone has suggestions on better product for athletes please let me know.</li>
      <li>If you are shopping for a sunscreen that has \\&quot;natural\\&quot; ingredients that is safe to use, then UVNaturals may fit your needs.</li>
      <li>We always laugh and joke at how gray we look after applying it (kind of like the sunscreen when we were kids)</li>
      <li>Best of all you don&#x27;t have to reapply every 30 minutes as you do with some other products.  </li>
      <li>Spreads better than their original product (two yrs.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It seems to come off fairly easily with soap and water...</li>
      <li>I live in Florida so use a lot of sunscreen and wanted something I could feel good about putting a lot on and am training for a marathon</li>
      <li>I bought 2 bottles and quickly returned the unopened one!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s quite possible that this sunscreen could be a great product, aside from the smell, perhaps it just needs a light fragrance like lavender added to it??</li>
      <li>All of these products have around 25% Zinc-Oxide as the primary sun blocking ingredient.</li>
      <li>it was Amazon...plus free shipping.</li>
      <li>Never got sunburned, and I really enjoy the smell.&lt;br</li>
      <li>No, so I suppose it met the important criteria, but trust me</li>
      <li>One of the things I like most about it is that it absorbs very readily.</li>
      <li>and you never burn and your skin feels richly moisturized.</li>
      <li>I was all excited to find an alternative to the chemical laden sunscreens out there...</li>
      <li>It is a bit of a hit and miss to find this product at a local store (San Francisco Bay Area), so your best bet may be to order from Amazon or direct from</li>
      <li>just make sure you don&#x27;t apply too much.</li>
      <li>I feel confident knowing that the largest organ on my body - my skin - isn&#x27;t absorbing Oxybenzone, Avobenzone, Homosalate, Octinoxate, or Octisalate.  </li>

      <li>Use it daily and it feels good on my skin.</li>
      <li>I am super Type A about ingredients, and this sunscreen meets all of my rigid standards, both health and environmental concerns.  </li>
      <li>Was so happy I bought another bottle when I got back to have ready for the NJ shore.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in Arizona and the sun gets very hot, even in the cooler months.  </li>
      <li>As for this sunscreen, first it has excellent ingredients and although it has a high amount of zinc, it rubbed it in very easy, unlike other natural sunscreen.</li>
      <li>Cons:  Does not come off easily, you really need to scrub your skin.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend this if you&#x27;re concerned about all of the other sprays and chemical-ridden sunscreens that do more harm than good to your skin and body.</li>
      <li>But it does actually work amazingly well.  </li>
      <li>Also, am equally important, it works really well.  </li>
      <li>I wear it everyday and also is a great moisturizer after shaving.</li>
      <li>I bought this because it was all natural and on the safe list of sunscreens that don&#x27;t have cancer causing additives.  </li>
      <li>There are a lot better natural sunblock options out there, so</li>

      <li>I tried this product as it is natural and am I glad I tried it.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;superior, better for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I knew from the first squirt and rub that this wasn&#x27;t going to work</li>
      <li>yes, it has a funny smell (you get used to that), and yes it&#x27;s pricer,  </li>
      <li>Do not use too much!</li>
      <li>However, once your skin has absorbed it, you don&#x27;t see it on and it protects very well.  </li>
      <li>Pleasant smell (to me at least), will not run into your eyes, even if sweating heavily, rated as one of the top safe sunscreens by the Environmental Working Group, prevents sunburn.    </li>
      <li>UV Natural absorbs readily and applies easily.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for the last few weeks now, and I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
      <li>how much a like it.  </li>
      <li>The Sport one is also sweatproof, and it really works.</li>
      <li>it really works.</li>
      <li>This really delivers on it&#x27;s claims to be water resistant.</li>
      <li>I just bought a tube of this sunscreen at Whole Food and rushed home to test it out.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any particularly objectionable smell about it.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>After reading the EWG&#x27;s report on all the unhealthful sunscreens out there (which is most of them,) I decided to look for something better for me- less harsh chemicals.</li>
      <li>really like the product because of it natural ingredients and the high level of zink.</li>
      <li>Sounds kind of obvious, but you&#x27;d be surprised how ineffective certain high-SPF sunscreens are, especially when you start sweating and actually doing something in them.  </li>
      <li>Use it sparingly, you don&#x27;t need to slather it on like a normal sunscreen.  </li>
      <li>Definitely oily/cream, difficult to rub in and wash off but works pretty well, sticks on me good when I surf in Waikiki for a couple hours in the hot sun.  </li>
      <li>I tan, not burn, but I barely have any tan from 2 full days in desert sun this last weekend.  </li>
      <li>my last tube lasted two years without  a single burn, just nice slow light browning.</li>
      <li>But as soon as I put it on, the smell was overwhelming, not sure it&#x27;s revolting or just takes some time getting used to.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this sunscreen for years, primarily for high-exertion activities where I can&#x27;t be bothered to re-apply sunscreen every half hour.  </li>
      <li>Make sure you wait half an hour before heading outside so that it can absorb into your skin.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used UV Natural for several years and really like it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I use sunscreen on a daily basis to protect myself at work. After reading the EWG&#x27;s report on all the unhealthful sunscreens out there (which is most of them,) I decided to look for something better for me- less harsh chemicals. I&#x27;ve been using this for the last few weeks now, and I&#x27;m happy with it. It is thicker than the Neutrogena ones I&#x27;ve been using, but it&#x27;s not too heavy. It has an interesting patchouli smell that took a couple days to get used to, but I like it. I haven&#x27;t gotten so much as a tan line after using it, and I&#x27;m very happy about that. The Sport one is also sweatproof, and it really works. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awful, unless you prefer to put your sunscreen on with a paintbrush.  A friend sent a link to a website of a lab that rates over 500 sunscreens on the basis of how \\&quot;healthy\\&quot; they are for humans; i.e., least harmful ingredients (sorry, am on vacation so don&#x27;t have the info with me).  It&#x27;s amazing the junk that most sunscreens have.  I live in Florida so use a lot of sunscreen and wanted something I could feel good about putting a lot on and am training for a marathon so wanted a sport variety.  UV Natural Sport SFP30+ got the best rating of any sport sunscreen (a 1 on a scale of 1-10!).  My usual (Coppertone Sport SFP 30) got a 4.  So I decided to invest the $30 or so (six times the price of my Coppertone, per ounce) to see if this would be as good without all the harmful ingredients.  I knew from the first squirt and rub that this wasn&#x27;t going to work but I persevered -- let&#x27;s try it since I have it.  Directions said to wait a half hour for it to absorb.  An hour of waiting and an hour of running and it still never absorbed.  I looked like a clown covered in white paint.  It took over a half hour in the shower to feel like at least some of it scrubbed off.  Did I get burned? No, so I suppose it met the important criteria, but trust me I won&#x27;t ever put this stuff on again. What a pity.</li>
    <li> This really delivers on it&#x27;s claims to be water resistant. We spent days in and by the ocean and none of us burned! The water just beads up and rolls off. I will always keep this stuff around.</li>
    <li> Sunblock purpose fulfill at it best. It has a \\&quot;unique\\&quot; smell and one other thing is that when I get out of the water mosquitos seems to dig it and get all over my face!&lt;br /&gt;I really like the product because of it natural ingredients and the high level of zink.</li>
    <li> We live at the beach in southern california, and are constantly in the sun and the water. This is the best waterproof sunscreen we have ever used. The water literally \\&quot;beads up\\&quot; on your skin so you know its working. We have been on long trips to Hawaii and Costa Rica with this stuff. Every day in and out of the water....it really works. But, you need to put it on sparingly. Do not use too much! It takes longer to spread initially than other sunblocks, but once you have even coverage, you do not need to re-apply as often. I have been using this for my kids and my family for years. It washes off with soap and warm water. Don&#x27;t slather this on - spread it out.</li>
    <li> I just bought a tube of this sunscreen at Whole Food and rushed home to test it out. I am a triathlete and I have race this weekend and have been searching for long wearing sweat proof sunscreen. Up to now I have been using Badger sunscreen and love it. But I don&#x27;t believe it will last for three hours in the sun, while swimming and sweating and I have won&#x27;t have much time to reapply during my race it.  As for this sunscreen, first it has excellent ingredients and although it has a high amount of zinc, it rubbed it in very easy, unlike other natural sunscreen. But as soon as I put it on, the smell was overwhelming, not sure it&#x27;s revolting or just takes some time getting used to. So I&#x27;m going to leave it on and if it still bothers me in few hours than I&#x27;m going to return it. It&#x27;s quite possible that this sunscreen could be a great product, aside from the smell, perhaps it just needs a light fragrance like lavender added to it?? If I keep it, than I&#x27;m going to use it this weekend and see how it goes. If anyone has suggestions on better product for athletes please let me know.</li>
    <li> Product seems to last a long time however on a recent long bike ride I came back covered in bugs stuck to the sunscreen.  It&#x27;s just a bit too greasy.</li>
    <li> If you are shopping for a sunscreen that has \\&quot;natural\\&quot; ingredients that is safe to use, then UVNaturals may fit your needs. It definitely does for me. I wear it everyday and also is a great moisturizer after shaving. It is a bit of a hit and miss to find this product at a local store (San Francisco Bay Area), so your best bet may be to order from Amazon or direct from the manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other sunscreens I have used and recommend are made by GreenScreen and Badger. All of these products have around 25% Zinc-Oxide as the primary sun blocking ingredient. It&#x27;s just the individual&#x27;s preference for which works best for them. For me though, I prefer UVNaturals sunscreens. I definitely recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> Great sunscreen.  Spreads better than their original product (two yrs. ago) and seems to blend in more naturally.  Use it daily and it feels good on my skin.</li>
    <li> What is a little initial greasy feel (it absorbs after a few minutes, as the directions say) and a fragrance that could be improved (I liked the suggestion someone made about lavender) when compared to the bigger picture of HEALTH?  I am allergic to every sunscreen on the market.  Minutes after applying them my skin is red and burning.  NOT THIS ONE!  I feel confident knowing that the largest organ on my body - my skin - isn&#x27;t absorbing Oxybenzone, Avobenzone, Homosalate, Octinoxate, or Octisalate.  I&#x27;ll take a little zinc oxide mixed with natural ingredients when it does the trick and doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel like it has sunburn BEFORE I go into the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS (If they added in the lavender fragrance, I&#x27;d give this 5 stars!)</li>
    <li> This is the best sunscreen I have ever used.  Ingredients are all natural.  So many wonderful oils.  I feel it is actually good for my face!  Protection is wonderful!</li>
    <li> I bought this because it was all natural and on the safe list of sunscreens that don&#x27;t have cancer causing additives.  (Which if you look at the American Cancer Society, they dispute that fact anyway.)  It is so thick that you cannot even spread it.  I also bought the baby version and my son was coated from head to toe.  I will say that none of us got any sun that day, but it was like wearing a mask.  It didn&#x27;t smell very nice either.</li>
    <li> So, this is the third time I have purchased this sunscreen, which I think goes to show how much a like it.  I am super Type A about ingredients, and this sunscreen meets all of my rigid standards, both health and environmental concerns.  Also, am equally important, it works really well.  It lasted all day every day through all-day long hikes and bouldering in the desert landscape of Joshua Tree.  I only apply once in the morning.  I am not saying I recommend this for everyone, if i get a little sun I tan, not burn, but I barely have any tan from 2 full days in desert sun this last weekend.  A little of this sunscreen goes a long way.  It is very thick, which can take some getting used to.  And I know some people don&#x27;t like the smell, but I don&#x27;t have any problems with it; I barely notice it smells at all.  Overall, it is the best sunscreen I have found on the market.</li>
    <li> I was all excited to find an alternative to the chemical laden sunscreens out there...but....this one smells so strong and so bad, you can&#x27;t stand to wear it.  The smell takes repeated washings to get off your skin.  My husband works outside everyday and the guys that work with him made fun of the way he smelled.  Also, it feels weird on you skin.  I bought 2 bottles and quickly returned the unopened one!</li>
    <li> This is one of the few sunscreens I feel comfortable putting on my three small children.  Even \\&quot;organic\\&quot; sunscreen&#x27;s have some horrible ingredients in them.  You have to read the lables and ressearch which ingredients are toxic.</li>
    <li> The pluses: It works brilliantly, even after hours running, biking and swimming. Never got sunburned, and I really enjoy the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The minuses: It is a bit hard to put on, and you have to be careful not to put on too thick of a layer, since it does not absorb fast. Thus, after long bike rides; bugs, which just stick to the sunscreen, cover me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest negative is the amount of Zinc dries out my skin- so that after using it daily on vacation, my skin started looking like snake skin, until I bought myself moisturizer, I would put on at night. I never usually use moisturizer on my legs and arms, so I will likely look for another natural sunscreen next time around.</li>
    <li> My Dermatologist recommended this as THE BEST. I disagree.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t even get my 15 year old surfer to use this product. It&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;Greasy and nasty, Shiseido is much better, and protection is&lt;br /&gt;superior, better for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> After reading reviews on other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; products that were not very positive, I admittedly rolled the dice on trying this one.  But I can happily say that the gamble paid off.  Excellent coverage, you don&#x27;t need to use a ton of it, goes on easily (feels a little greasy initially but soon absorbs into the skin).  I used it daily on a recent trip to Maui and one tube got me through the whole week.  Was so happy I bought another bottle when I got back to have ready for the NJ shore.  Highly recommend this if you&#x27;re concerned about all of the other sprays and chemical-ridden sunscreens that do more harm than good to your skin and body.</li>
    <li> When used as directed (applying 30 min before sun exposure), the oiliness absorbs/dries a little with time and exposure to water.  It&#x27;s oiliness is only an issue to those that either forget to apply early, or just don&#x27;t have time to wait that long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems to come off fairly easily with soap and water...the better sports suncreens take a couple soapings and a good toweling to get all off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I prefer the Raw Elements Eco-stick.  I get less redness, it stays on, no oiliness, no time constraints...but the stick gets very hard in cold climates and needs to be warmed up before application.</li>
    <li> great just like how it is described. Would recommend it. Need something like this in Hawaii!!! Would definitely buy again!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used UV Natural for several years and really like it. One of the things I like most about it is that it absorbs very readily. The thing I like least about it is the cost.    I tried the Badger sunscreen, which was less expensive, but I could not get it to absorb easily. I looked as if I were wearing a white mask. Also the Badger had an overpowering perfumey-smell, so I ditched the Badger and went back to UV Natural.    UV Natural absorbs readily and applies easily. I haven&#x27;t noticed any particularly objectionable smell about it. It has an excellent safety and effectiveness rating at Environmental Working Group&#x27;s study.    My only complaint about it is that it is so darned expensive.</li>
    <li> Definitely oily/cream, difficult to rub in and wash off but works pretty well, sticks on me good when I surf in Waikiki for a couple hours in the hot sun.  Smells like you can eat it, although I never tried...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this sunscreen for 8 years.  I loved how safe the ingredients were and wanted that for my babies.  Our family has used this for our annual Florida beach vacation every year, with the exception of last year when we thought we would try Dr. Mercola&#x27;s sunscreen.  I like most of his products and know they are safe plus the price was a bit cheaper.  Well...this year we are back with UV Natural SPORT.  Our family lives in GA and we don&#x27;t use sunscreen during the summers here, we just slowly build a tolerance to the sun without burning.  BUT...when we head to the Florida sun, it&#x27;s a different story.  I can tell you that there are five of us and in the past 8 years we have never burned after applying this sunscreen.  Yes, it&#x27;s thicker, yes it&#x27;s somewhat greasy (that goes away) yes, it has a funny smell (you get used to that), and yes it&#x27;s pricer,  but my children, my husband and I can spend hours playing in the water and on the beach and not worry about burning.  IT&#x27;s WORTH EVERY PENNY!!!  We always laugh and joke at how gray we look after applying it (kind of like the sunscreen when we were kids) but we know we have safe ingredients on and no worries about the sun.  Their baby formula is GREAT for babies which I used on my girls as babies.  A little goes a long way and it lasts.  SO... we will spend the money to keep us all safe.  THAT in itself is priceless.  Always shop on line for the best price.  This year...it was Amazon...plus free shipping.</li>
    <li> truly the best and least toxic. a tube lasts forever and you never burn and your skin feels richly moisturized. just make sure you don&#x27;t apply too much. it takes a while to put on because it is thick, but it is not white and for me at least it doesn&#x27;t need reapplication. my last tube lasted two years without  a single burn, just nice slow light browning. I can feel the chemicals in other sunscreens and feel sick after  a couple of days of putting them on, but could use this daily and feel find.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in Arizona and the sun gets very hot, even in the cooler months.  If you don&#x27;t want to always stay inside or lug around a umbrella to keep the sun off, you must put on plenty of sun screen and keep reapplying constantly.  I tried this product as it is natural and am I glad I tried it.  It is a bit thick so it takes a few minutes to absorb into the skin and not leave that pale zinc tint I have seen with other zinc oxide sunscreens. It must be spread on rather than slathered like the thin sunscreens.   However, once your skin has absorbed it, you don&#x27;t see it on and it protects very well.  Best of all you don&#x27;t have to reapply every 30 minutes as you do with some other products.  I literally went close to 2 hours and I was still protected on a day it was a 103 degrees this 4th of July. It does have a slight smell that my husband says is like almonds.  However, I did not find it overwhelming or unpleasant and this sunscreen definitely gets the job done and protects against harmful sun rays.</li>
    <li> I have been using this sunblock for several years now.  I am allergic to most sunblocks, but not this one.  It has freed me to be outside all year around.  It lasts all day.</li>
    <li> Activities:  Cycling, hiking, trail running, and lounging poolside.    Pros:  Pleasant smell (to me at least), will not run into your eyes, even if sweating heavily, rated as one of the top safe sunscreens by the Environmental Working Group, prevents sunburn.    Cons:  Does not come off easily, you really need to scrub your skin.  Rather expensive.  Will leave smears on random things like glass, sunglasses, LCD screens, some fabrics.    Summary:  I&#x27;ve used this sunscreen for years, primarily for high-exertion activities where I can&#x27;t be bothered to re-apply sunscreen every half hour.  Previous sunscreens had that harsh, chemical smell, and would run into my eyes and burn after I started sweating.  Rarely have that problem with this sunscreen, and even when it does get into my eyes, it doesn&#x27;t burn.  Also, I have yet to get sunburn with this sunscreen.  Sounds kind of obvious, but you&#x27;d be surprised how ineffective certain high-SPF sunscreens are, especially when you start sweating and actually doing something in them.  Use it sparingly, you don&#x27;t need to slather it on like a normal sunscreen.  Make sure you wait half an hour before heading outside so that it can absorb into your skin.</li>
    <li> The sunblock worked great except its pretty greasy and doesnt soak in the skin that well.  I would have given 5 stars if it wasn&#x27;t for the greasy problem.</li>
    <li> This stuff is way way too thick. It&#x27;s like Crisco lol. But it does actually work amazingly well.  I just hate wearing it. It seems like it&#x27;s for sports people....</li>
    <li> I use it sometimes because I hate letting things go to waste, but every time I do, I hate this product more and more. The smell is horrendous that I&#x27;d prefer to not use this on my face. Also, when I have used it on my face, its so slimy and sticky that I can&#x27;t seem to wash it off after I am done with my workouts. I feel like I have to scrub my face to get it off. There are a lot better natural sunblock options out there, so I wouldn&#x27;t bother with this one. If you want a non-toxic, natural sunblock, try Thinkbaby or Burnout. I prefer those much more.</li>
