    <li> i have a very dry skin even if i live in a tropic country. all our locally made lotions doesnt work on my skin. only vaseline can do wonders for some reason. it has to be this line or their fragrance free one. it&#x27;s just too heavy for summer day use so i can only use this at night. we have a local vaseline distributor here but their formulation is not good match for my skin so i still have to order this online. i also hope they create an &amp;#34;in-shower lotion&amp;#34; body wash so i wont have to use lotion on day time. other than that am very happy with this purchase, i love the scent and will definitely repurchase!</li>
    <li> I received this lotion from Influenster. I am picky over the lotions I put on my body but I tried it for a few days. I am a stay at home mom, so I am in the kitchen a lot, always washing dishes or washing my hands. By the middle or end of the day my hands are dry! In the Winter, they even crack at the knuckles. As soon as I used this lotion I noticed it was creamy, not watery or oily. It moisturized right away. I liked it so I put the bottle next to the sink and now use it after each dish wash/hand wash. My hands are so soft!! I am so happy I was able to try this. I&#x27;m hooked!!</li>
    <li> exactly what i ordered.</li>
    <li> I received this for free from influenster and LOVED it! My skin is so dry especially now in the colder weather and I saw a difference in my skin within a couple of days. I mostly used this for my arms and hands and loved the light scent, lightness of the lotion (didn&#x27;t feel oily or like I had anything on) and that my skin stayed hydrated the entire day with just one application . Best part too is I have sensitive skin and it didn&#x27;t bother me at all. I would definitely buy this once I&#x27;m out and have recommended it to multiple people.</li>
