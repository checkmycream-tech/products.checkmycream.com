      <li>It looks much better from the front.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love this.</li>
      <li>this wig has bangs that reach my nose and there is more hair in the bang area then anywhere else.</li>
      <li>But now its just delaying me even more because now I need another wig.</li>
      <li>And when i opened it most of the hair was in the bag and nov un the wig.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a pretty good quality wig from what I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s pretty darn good.</li>
      <li>The only reason I am not giving this a five is because it was incredibly itchy</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great wig, but honestly I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be so long.</li>
      <li>It was a Christmas present for my daughter and she loved it!  </li>
      <li>Overall, it was a great purchase. :)</li>
      <li>It came very quickly, about 13 days before the DEADLINE started.</li>
      <li>the fiber feels soft and looks amazing!</li>
      <li>First off, it&#x27;s not a Kasou wig, I own one</li>
      <li>The picture isn&#x27;t that accurate.</li>
      <li>but overall I am really happy with my wig.</li>
      <li>The wig is comfortable and not itchy.</li>
      <li>This is a cheap wig.</li>
      <li>Looks great just a lil to short</li>
      <li>Mine also didnt fit my head.</li>
      <li>It was easy to wear and fun for her to be in.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It was nicely packed, came early along with their &amp;#34;medal of approval&amp;#34; and the wig cap as promised.</li>
      <li>I would suggest it to someone looking for a good white wig.</li>
      <li>This is easy to care for and fits pretty well.</li>
      <li>or so which was quite quick</li>
      <li>It was quickly shipped.</li>
      <li>so it falls of really quick.</li>
      <li>Ok I got the wig before expected and it looks nice and</li>
      <li>It does tend to shed easily, but it is soft and easy to style.</li>
      <li>I wore this to school when I first got it, dressed as prussia, and my friends thought i dyed and cut my hair!</li>
      <li>The only thing is that the hair in the front was a bit longer that the picture, but that&#x27;s okay!</li>
      <li>Exactly what I ordered!</li>
      <li>The wig wasn&#x27;t the best, the hair fibers were sown in with black thread and you can clearly see it.</li>
      <li>I was very nervous about the cheap prices in the beginning.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Daughter loved it so much she got her haircut in the same style.</li>
      <li>It takes longer but TOTALLY worth the wait.</li>
      <li>Honestly this is just a hair net with a couple of yellow-ish strands.</li>
      <li>Shipping was super fast, got here in just 11 days!</li>
      <li>Other then that, the wig color is accurate, its very easy to style,</li>
      <li>The package also came with two hairnets, one tan and one black, so that&#x27;s good.</li>
      <li>This was the first that didnt.</li>
      <li>This picture was stolen from another company who has much higher rating, I would suggest going to them.</li>
      <li>I actually used twice more since then.  </li>
      <li>The top is pretty short and the thing is not stylable at all.</li>
      <li>First off the wig  was reaaly sparse, and you could see the mesh underneath.</li>
      <li>This wig is the first one Ive ever bought for a cosplay</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a more spot on look, then I reccomend knowing how to cut and style a wig beforehand , since it will be necessary to know.</li>
      <li>you didn&#x27;t know), the wig will not look like the picture because you have to layer it and style it the way you want, and those adjusting hooks are what goes in the back of your head, not the front... :)</li>
      <li>I bought this wig from Anangel for the first time.</li>
      <li>overall satisfied.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping, got here a couple weeks before estimated date!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> So, yes, I did get my wig earlier than the original date. However, this wig looks NOTHING like the picture and the black netting the hair is connected to is visible through the sparsely covered wig. When I put the wig on, it promptly shed all its crappily put-on hair all over me and left me with a wig the quality of a balding 40 year-old man. Would not recommend; really s***ty</li>
    <li> I ordered this wig to go with my White Rabbit costume. Shipping was super fast, got here in just 11 days! The wig is full and really soft. I was a bit worried about it since the cost was so cheap, but what a deal! The wig is super comfy and fully covers all my thick, curly hair under my hair net! Great item!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a pretty good quality wig from what I&#x27;ve seen. It takes a bit to figure out the best way to part it but once you get that done with it&#x27;s really nice. I&#x27;ve worn it for my Prussia cosplay and I&#x27;m considering modifying it for an Allen Walker cosplay!</li>
    <li> I like it I guess ... There&#x27;s parts a really don&#x27;t like about it the netting was white but the hair fibers are sewn on with black thread and it&#x27;s really visible and there&#x27;s not a lot of hair to cover that up ... But the wig is large and dosent have the side elastic to make it smaller so it falls of really quick. I do not recommend buying this wig ESPECIALLY for cosplay.</li>
    <li> First off, it&#x27;s not a Kasou wig, I own one and this is not one. It doesn&#x27;t have the Kasou tag and isn&#x27;t structured like one either. This wig is just one big lace piece with wefts sewn on it, not the standard smaller lace piece with wefts sewn around it. If that makes sense. I&#x27;m not saying this wig is bad, for the price it&#x27;s pretty darn good. The only issue i really had with this wig is that the wefts in the back were cut very short and straight across making it very difficult to hide the wefts from showing when you put the wig on and the hair is a bit thin. Other then that, the wig color is accurate, its very easy to style, very soft fibers and mine didn&#x27;t shed that much at all.</li>
    <li> The actual wig doesn&#x27;t look like the picture. It sheds everywhere. The wig is very small it doesn&#x27;t cover my head completely. The shipping  was fast. It came in two weeks early.</li>
    <li> Great Cosplay wig for Halloween.  I actually used twice more since then.  Looking forward to wearing again next year.</li>
    <li> I just got this wig and it is by far the worst one I&#x27;ve ever received. As soon as I pulled it out of the package and saw how thin the hair was, I knew it was not going to be good. The hair is ridiculously thin and you can see the netting under it. It looks nothing like the picture, (admittedly I was going to use it for Kaneki Ken, not Prussia, but still...) It&#x27;s shedding really bad. Like there are little sections of white hair everywhere now. On the plus side it came early. But now its just delaying me even more because now I need another wig. Oh bonus! I got a creepily long black hair along with it. None of my wigs have long hair and neither do it. DO NOT BUY THIS WIG! I am attaching photos. You can see in the pictures how bad its shedding on my hoodie. And how thin the hair is.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Perfect!</li>
    <li> Great looking wig. It was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Looks great just a lil to short</li>
    <li> This is amazing! I wore this to school when I first got it, dressed as prussia, and my friends thought i dyed and cut my hair!</li>
    <li> this wig&#x27;s okay. the hair is kind of thin though. It&#x27;s also a little small, so people like me with lots of hair/big head might opt for a different wig.</li>
    <li> I wore this wig after getting it in the mail, and it fits comfortably! It&#x27;s also good to style since I don&#x27;t need much hair, so I&#x27;ll better get to cutting. The package also came with two hairnets, one tan and one black, so that&#x27;s good. Only thing is that the wig doesn&#x27;t come with a netting for storage. Regardless, I can&#x27;t wait to use this for cosplay!</li>
    <li> This wig looks nothing like the picture it has black on the inside that shows through the hair and there is not a lot of hair you can style it to kina cover up the black but it doesn&#x27;t stay very well but I did get it for 9$ so I guess I got what I paid for.</li>
    <li> The wig arrived on time and in good condition. The bangs were a bit long so I had to trim it. The only reason I am not giving this a five is because it was incredibly itchy and I had to wash it twice to make wearable. It is a good wig, good quality with a good solid color. It doesn&#x27;t really shed and holds styles very well. I would suggest it to someone looking for a good white wig.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great wig, but honestly I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be so long. I generally understand that wigs are longer than what is shown, but like, this was down to my shoulders long, which was rather unexpected.</li>
    <li> Wig was trash! There was black netting and the hair fell out, too. I am not satisfied. It took very long to arrive. Not worth it at all.</li>
    <li> Fits good. Daughter loved it so much she got her haircut in the same style.</li>
    <li> It is awesome all I can say. it is what I hoped it would be so I am very happy.</li>
    <li> I ordered this wig for my Prussia cosplay outfit. It is great! The color is perfect. The only thing that has caused me a few problems is the length of the bangs, but after styling the wig this won&#x27;t be an issue.  Overall, it was a great purchase. :)</li>
    <li> Exactly what I ordered! looks great and is really comfortable. I did have to trim the back up a little bit but other than that, totally worth it!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t do this much so it&#x27;ll probably very long or very quick. You&#x27;ve been warned people. Alright, first things first, it got here 2 weeks late so I had to go cosplaying as a background character, all gray. Once it got here I was ecstatic, but, BUT, it looks nothing like the picture. The top is pretty short and the thing is not stylable at all. Way to short and came late. Over all I would recommend the other one that&#x27;s like 6.99. It takes longer but TOTALLY worth the wait.</li>
    <li> This item is okay, not bad but decent, kinda thin and a bit small which is ironic since my head is already small but beside that it okay. I am gonna tease it up for my cosplay when halloween comes around. And the item did come in early much earlier then expect so fast shipping I like.</li>
    <li> i am super suprized!!!!! the fiber feels soft and looks amazing! the quality is a bit meh but the fabric and material was beyond the price! this wig has bangs that reach my nose and there is more hair in the bang area then anywhere else. i would recommend this wig! if you are planning to get it then get it!</li>
    <li> The wig is kinda meh. Little bit of a dissapointment to be honest. You can clearly see the thread used and the inside sticks to the wig cap. The wig is white not silver and when I got it, for some reason the inside was filled with black hair</li>
    <li> Came a bit later than it said it was but i wasn&#x27;t really in a rush. It looks awesome and feels really great!</li>
    <li> Probably the worst thing I have ever bought</li>
    <li> It was very high quality and I am pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> It was very full and thick, though it&#x27;s too small for my head! Maybe make it bigger?</li>
    <li> I bought this wig from Anangel for the first time. It was about $4 and another $5 for shipping, which wasn&#x27;t bad at all. I was very nervous about the cheap prices in the beginning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was nicely packed, came early along with their &amp;#34;medal of approval&amp;#34; and the wig cap as promised. It fit very well, the fibers are extremely silky and easy to brush. I had to do very little trimming to get the exact hairstyle I desired (I am using this wig for another character, not Prussia). My only issue is that you can see the wig net if the back is not properly styled. I recommend wearing a nude colored hair net rather than the black one it came with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I was very satisfied with the product for the extremely cheap price. I will support this seller later in the future.</li>
    <li> Edgy, fun, and helpful on my bad (65 yr old ) hair days trying to let the grey come thru with style and acceptance!&lt;br /&gt;ooops and did I mention the quality/ for the price Superb!!</li>
    <li> The wig arrived rather quickly and the quality wasn&#x27;t horrible. It does tend to shed easily, but it is soft and easy to style. I will add that it looks nothing like the photo, and is very long In the bangs. If you&#x27;re looking for a more spot on look, then I reccomend knowing how to cut and style a wig beforehand , since it will be necessary to know.</li>
    <li> This wig is amazing! it is super comfortable and not itchy like some other wigs. As some other reviews said they got theirs a little long, but I think mine is actually a little shorter then the picture, but that&#x27;s ok. Over all awesome wig</li>
    <li> Three and a half stars, you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I just got my wig today and was very disappointed in the wig. It looked nothing like the pictures. The lining of it was horrible, nothing like the picture. It was a black lining, hardly hair to cover it. You would think it would be like advertised, no not for me. I am really disappointed in it and sending it back for a refund.</li>
    <li> This wig was terrible, I got it 2 weeks early, which was cool, but everything else was aweful. First off the wig  was reaaly sparse, and you could see the mesh underneath. Upon further inspection, I realized that it was one wig weft, sewn in a spiral WITH BLACK THREAD. Its a white wig, why would you do that? On top of it all, when i went to try and add more vulume to it, the hair was falling out in chucnk. It also came with a black wig cap, when I was prommised a white. Don&#x27;t waste your time with this wig, I had to flat out throw it away. This picture was stolen from another company who has much higher rating, I would suggest going to them.</li>
    <li> It came very quickly, about 13 days before the DEADLINE started. People are saying that you can see black threads through the hair, but mine does not have that issue. The wig is comfortable and not itchy. I absolutely love this. I&#x27;m defiantly going to use this for a Prussia cosplay. (I&#x27;m also going to walk into school with it on)</li>
    <li> Appreciate the effort but it is a bit crude.  It was quickly shipped.</li>
    <li> It was a little too small for my head, but the colour and feel of it was awesome.</li>
    <li> Very Nice wig! Made very well. It was a Christmas present for my daughter and she loved it!  Works great for Cosplay.</li>
    <li> White wig not silver?????&lt;br /&gt;And why in the world was it sewn in black not white....? That makes no sense!&lt;br /&gt;Sure its soft but its for small heads too plus unevenly cut?&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a critic but its pretty noticeable</li>
    <li> Definitely not like the photo shown- Im still trying to figure out how to stylize it after having it now for a week.</li>
    <li> Apparently all of the wigs are completely different from one another. The one I received is better than some, yet worse than others. I may have bought it for my brother, but I am the one in the picture- and yes, I am a girl. The second picture didn&#x27;t download correctly onto my computer, but this one shows the front. From the back, you can see the wefts. &amp;#62;.&amp;#60;&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This wig is so pretty and such good quality, with a lot of extra hair to work with, the length comes almost to my shoulders before styling.  But a little story, this was my first wig I ever purchased for cosplay reasons and apparently I didn&#x27;t know how to put on a wig so I was cutting and styling this wig with it on backwards!  Luckily I didn&#x27;t butcher it up too much before realizing I had it on backwards, and since there was a lot of extra hair still, I managed to save it.  So heads up(in case you didn&#x27;t know), the wig will not look like the picture because you have to layer it and style it the way you want, and those adjusting hooks are what goes in the back of your head, not the front... :)</li>
    <li> i ordered this for my kaneki ken cosplay. i believe it got to me within a week or so which was quite quick so i was happy. i need just a little trimming for my taste but overall good. i even used it to costest Clear from DMMD and it looked good too. overall satisfied.</li>
    <li> I bought the wig and was happy when I got it! Fast shipping, got here a couple weeks before estimated date! The only thing is that the hair in the front was a bit longer that the picture, but that&#x27;s okay! Loved the wig~</li>
    <li> I agree with the others. It is a little soft, but horribly crafted.  Who sews a white wig with black thread?  Now I need to go and find another wig</li>
    <li> My mom bought this wig for me as a birthday present (after I previously showed it to her), which I can use for my Teutonic Knights cosplay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I&#x27;d like to point out how early it got (It was purchased on Oct. 18; Delivery estimate was between Nov. 13 - Dec. 2; I received it on Nov. 12).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, when I opened the package it was in, I noticed it is longer than the picture I saw online, though it is fixable with a little trimming (I have yet to trim the bangs).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that, the back of the wig spreads outward for some reason (I&#x27;m not sure if it was like that before or after it was packaged, but it&#x27;s no big deal, as I trimmed the back a little, so it&#x27;s less obvious).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from those flaws, this is a rather great wig, even for $9.98 (the price at the time of purchase)!</li>
    <li> Ok I got the wig before expected and it looks nice and all but it DID NOT come with the wig cap as it says it will in the description other than that I have no complaints (oh by the way just FYI it comes Chinese air mail so it comes in a teal package)</li>
    <li> The wig itself looked nothing like the photo, and the color was not right. The color appeared to be a faded yellow and there almost was no hair on it at all. The layers itself were incredibly choppy. Honestly this is just a hair net with a couple of yellow-ish strands.</li>
    <li> A really good wig, love the quality of the fibers. It could be a little fuller but it&#x27;s still an amazing wig.</li>
    <li> not my best wig but I like it. I expect to have to fiddle a little to find where to sit a wig. I start by cutting of the fitting straps, they just make me uncomfortable. I expect a wig to each fit a little different and require proper care. This is easy to care for and fits pretty well. Looks pretty much as pictured.</li>
    <li> I got it within like 2 weeks(｡&#x27;∀｀)ﾉ, but the quality was meh. The top of it you could see the black netting, and the hair was almost everywhere.  I mean, you get what you pay for, but I think that there are some better ones out there.</li>
    <li> The wig wasn&#x27;t the best, the hair fibers were sown in with black thread and you can clearly see it. And it&#x27;s to thin. The picture isn&#x27;t that accurate.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girlfriend and she absolutely loves it, perfect for her Prussia cosplay. Very soft and got in earlier than expected. 10 stars!</li>
    <li> This wig came and was not the wig that was shown in the picture. It was thin, and you could see right through it. DO NOT ORDER IT!</li>
    <li> Thank you for a lovely item, good fit and quality. I use this cosplay for Prussia/ Hetalia. Love it, love it.</li>
    <li> The weave is a little too thin in the back, showing my real hair, and it was both a little too small for my head- but my head is a little larger than most- and a little too short. I wanted to add some spikes and trim the back to look like the character I was cosplaying but it was too short for any trimming.</li>
    <li> I order the wig on April 12 now the estimate time of it being delivered was Wednesday May 8 - Friday May 24. I got it by April 25 now the wig is coming from China so I guess it could take longer for other people, but it was really fast shipping. It does come with the wig cape I didn&#x27;t see that part but overall I am really happy with my wig.</li>
    <li> This is a bad wig for cosplay. Firstly, this wig had a black net and it should have a nude net because of its light color. You see the black very clearly see the black where the wefts are sewn in. Secondly, the wefts are very poorly sewed in there&#x27;s strings all over and you have to cut them out otherwise it looks like you have streaks in the wig. Thirdly, its an unadjustable net so if you have a big head? You&#x27;re S.O.L. on this wig. Not good for cosplay, not good at all. The quality is terrible if you need a white wig, look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> My daughter wore this to her 8th grade graduation. Everyone thought it was her real hair. It was easy to wear and fun for her to be in. It came on time and in great condition. We loved it. If you&#x27;re looking for a Prussia wig this is the place to get it.</li>
    <li> you can see the black seems</li>
    <li> it was really thin you could see the netting underneath. Mine also didnt fit my head. I have a rather small head so almost all the wigs i buy fir me. This was the first that didnt. I bought another wig along side this one and it was horrible even worse than this one. It was broken, choppy, the hair was shedding everywhere. Im only giving it two stars and not one because at least it was the correct length unlike the other wig i ordered</li>
    <li> This wig is the first one Ive ever bought for a cosplay and I love it. It came on time and also fits really well. A Little thin but its not horrible.</li>
    <li> As described. My daughter is happy with the quality.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter for cosplay.  Cute wig, but the hair falls out very easily.  You can also see through to the netting in the back.  It looks much better from the front.  But, it works for my daughter.</li>
    <li> my duaghter uses it in cosplay. loves it. uses it</li>
    <li> This productos id really bad, it doesnt look anything lime the picture and its really crappy for no better way ti describe it. Whats the return policy con this because its really bar and i cant make use of it at al. It sheds alot. And when i opened it most of the hair was in the bag and nov un the wig.</li>
    <li> The wig feels and looks nice, but the hair is thin and you can see the black wig cap through it unless you find a way to style it where the wig cap doesn&#x27;t show, but it&#x27;s too thin to do so. It also sheds quite a bit. The color is also this yellowish white. I was gonna use this for my Kaneki Ken cosplay but I&#x27;m disappointed with the whole wig cap situation. I would suggest you buy a different white wig.</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t buy if I were you. When I bought it, there were all positive reviews. After I got it, there were all negatives reviews. &amp;#62;-&amp;#62; You can SEE the black netting through the white wig and it&#x27;s SO THIN REALLY THIN. You can&#x27;t even style it considering there&#x27;s nothing to style.PLEASE don&#x27;t buy this if you were looking for a adjustable wig with a lot of hair. Because it&#x27;s not even adjustable. Just stetchy.</li>
    <li> This is a cheap wig. If you&#x27;re looking for a high end &amp;#34;I Can&#x27;t Believe It&#x27;s Not Hair&amp;#34; wig you should expect to pay a lot more. But for an inexpensive wig this is one of the best I&#x27;ve seen. It doesn&#x27;t shed much, styles normally for a wig, and has only moderate shine to powder out.</li>
