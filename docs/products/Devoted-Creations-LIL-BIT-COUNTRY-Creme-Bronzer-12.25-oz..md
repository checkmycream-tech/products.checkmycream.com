<li> Works well need to wash hands right after stains a little on your hands if u dont</li>
<li> and i used the same amount as my other lotion</li>
<li> but no sooner after putting it on you smell like a wet dog...</li>
<li> Be careful when you apply though, have some sort of wipes for your hands, itll get in between your fingers and make them a darkish orange.</li>
<li> Half the price as the tanning salon.</li>
<li> , I sold all the packets and have people who want us to order a few bottles so we can start selling them.</li>
<li> I would say it seemed to just give you the few shades darker</li>
<li> MOSQUITOES are horrible, but when i went outside i never had the first one bite me</li>
<li> I would have to hope this is a fake!</li>
<li> I will not need to go to the hospital my rash is very bad.</li>
<li> This isn&#x27;t the worst, but the color results are subpar.</li>

I applied some after my shower and it went on clear and smooth i liked that fact alot, and where i live MOSQUITOES are horrible, but when i went outside i never had the first one bite me i could not believe it! The tatoo protector really does an amazing job as well! I honestly hope i can become as dark as Taylor (Lil BIt) using this product!</li>
    <li> I really like this lotion because it smells amazing after you tan, but you have to make sure you rub it in well because it will streak of you don&#x27;t!</li>
    <li> Love this lotion!! Definitely could notice a difference after the first use! The smell is great, doesn&#x27;t smell like your typical tanning lotion and makes your skin feel so soft! I would say it seemed to just give you the few shades darker but my skin didn&#x27;t get darker after each tan session it just seemed to maintain, still love this and would highly suggest for a user that doesn&#x27;t tan all the time like myself</li>
    <li> Love this! Heaven in a bottle! After one use and being outside for just two hours I could tell a difference!</li>
    <li> I noticed results the first time I used this! Love the smell! I will definitely buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I love it. It gives me a natural looking tan</li>
    <li> Overall its a good product. Has a nice smell,not to overpowering. Does not make you a orange bronze but gives you a natural looking tan. Be careful when you apply though, have some sort of wipes for your hands, itll get in between your fingers and make them a darkish orange. Other then that I love this lotion!!!</li>
    <li> I tried this lotion at the salon I work in. AMAZING. Love this product so much.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t the worst, but the color results are subpar. I tan extremely easy and will normally see dramatic results upon switching lotions. This one was just meh.</li>
    <li> I bought a packet at my tanning salon and lived this lotion. I have sensitive skin so I always test products. This bottle in the salon was 70$ so I thought let&#x27;s check amizon. I had recieved the product in two days may 29th 2015. This product smells like thr packet  along with having the same consistency however I instantly got hives from using the bottle I purchased off amizon. I would have to hope this is a fake! I would beware of purchasing. All cross fingers I will not need to go to the hospital my rash is very bad. Over all I don&#x27;t want to bash the seller they were very accommodating  and  responded promptly.</li>
    <li> Bought this at my local salon and it seems to help me greatly, I am fair skin and this has helped me achieve some nice color... only complainthe is the smell.... it smells nice in the bottle but no sooner after putting it on you smell like a wet dog... this is my first year using tanning beds and from what I&#x27;ve heard most lotions don&#x27;t smell good after, but this is really making me self-conscious.</li>
    <li> Great price, quick shipping! Half the price as the tanning salon. I love this product. It smells great and gives a nice bronze color.</li>
    <li> Great smell and this lotion made me 2 shades darker in just one session.</li>
    <li> Everything was good with it..but i noticed it goes fast and i used the same amount as my other lotion but over all it was good</li>
    <li> Absolute best tanning lotion I have ever tried &amp; I&#x27;ve tried a ton!! Love it! The results in my picture is only have TWO days of using it!!!</li>
    <li> Love the smell! My skin seemed so soft and smooth after tanning! Would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This. Is. Amazing. I work at a salon and tried a packet, I sold all the packets and have people who want us to order a few bottles so we can start selling them. This is not something id expected, b ronzers usually have some kind of color so when I opened the packet and saw white I was thinking this wasn&#x27;t going to be good. This, escapade, camp queen and spell bound are by far my favorite bronzers.</li>
    <li> I can always see results immediately after tanning with this lotion!</li>
    <li> Smells so good until after you tan, then It has a sunless tanning after smell. But it don&#x27;t streak or stain and gives a nice tan color.</li>
    <li> I wish it had more bronzer in it!  But the smell is amazing and stays smelling good well after you tan!</li>
