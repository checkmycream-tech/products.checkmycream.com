      <li>Work well, great for when you need to fill in areas when the ink from the ditto paper smears away.</li>
      <li>10 of em for under 5$ should of known lol.</li>
      <li>the ones that did did work good</li>
      <li>Good though.</li>
      <li>the fine tip works best for piercings but can be used for  detailed tattoo stenciling.</li>
      <li>Packaged nicely.</li>
      <li>That kind of stuff.</li>
      <li>I was hoping the tattoo aspect would make it more suitable for skin, but the ink bleeds.</li>
      <li>a ballpoint pen almost works better.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be sure to post another review in time, but if you purchase, purchase with the possibility of them drying before 1 or 2 uses.</li>
      <li>the fat end works better but is too fat for detail....</li>
      <li>The round tip is great for tattoo stenciling, but all go great on skin</li>

      <li>Great for writing/marking on dry skin.</li>
      <li>Great Pins to work on any body part you need to mark love that there are two ends one small and one large</li>
      <li>these are ok but they dry out really easy and the fine tip end doesnt get good enough flow to really write on skin.</li>
      <li>We even wrote thanks to the surgical team for doing such a good job.</li>
      <li>Markers were cheap, marked well on skin, and didn&#x27;t smear.</li>
      <li>For my older teenagers, college kids and up?!</li>

    <li> Seems as if some of these stopped working, or dry up quickly. I&#x27;ll be sure to post another review in time, but if you purchase, purchase with the possibility of them drying before 1 or 2 uses.</li>
    <li> Was what as described on the description. Packaged nicely. Good buy!</li>
    <li> Great Pins to work on any body part you need to mark love that there are two ends one small and one large</li>
    <li> Great for writing/marking on dry skin. However, after pattern transfer they clog up fast. Also bleed and stain skin. Good though.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see what makes these pens any different from an ordinary pen. I was hoping the tattoo aspect would make it more suitable for skin, but the ink bleeds. It doesn&#x27;t even last long. Pointless.</li>
    <li> do what they are ment to fill if a stencil starts to wash off works very well and the colors do help show where i want to blend some color</li>
    <li> Work well, great for when you need to fill in areas when the ink from the ditto paper smears away. Thanks.</li>
    <li> you get what you pay for here. 10 of em for under 5$ should of known lol. they bleed on the skin</li>
    <li> these are ok but they dry out really easy and the fine tip end doesnt get good enough flow to really write on skin. a ballpoint pen almost works better. the fat end works better but is too fat for detail.... theres the truth, do what u want with it</li>
    <li> Markers were cheap, marked well on skin, and didn&#x27;t smear. They last through a few washings and come in two colors. Takes a couple of weeks to deliver, but they arrived faster than Amazon estimated.</li>
    <li> I bought the pens to write positive affirmations and funny things on my body prior to hip replacement surgery.  My girlfriends didn&#x27;t write in the immediate area of the surgery - but elsewhere - legs and arms. We even wrote thanks to the surgical team for doing such a good job. That kind of stuff. The writing only needed to last for the day of surgery, and it served that purpose well.  I&#x27;d buy them again for that use, though I hope to never need to.</li>
    <li> Pens seem dry scratchy does not allow for drawing smooth lines on skin I would not buy these again garbage</li>
    <li> The pens showed up in a box and each one was individually wrapped as expected. They have dual tips as described and seem to work well. So what&#x27;s the \\&quot;...but...\\&quot;, well...I can&#x27;t read the language on the pens, so I&#x27;m really not sure if there are any warning there or not!</li>
    <li> I do a lot of free hand work and these were what I need. Two tip sizes for each pen, one black, one blue in every packet.&lt;br /&gt;Got what I paid for. Fine pens that can hold up to a session</li>
    <li> Works great stays long and strong wont wipe away. Only last one or two times so no huge coverage, but it works</li>
    <li> Marker label is misspelled, it said for any surface which could be very dangerous for use on the skin for tattoo or piercing. It is simple junk!!</li>
    <li> Very unhappy, really???!!! blue and red tattoos?! For my older teenagers, college kids and up?! Ummmmm no thanks. Waste of money..  could have gotten black something marker at the dollar store!!! Wtf</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a new tattoo artist so these pens help me out a lot when my stencil begins to fade away.</li>
    <li> Not all the markers work but the ones that did did work good</li>
    <li> the ink runs out fast,the ink wont stay on the skin. bum trip&#x27;. im gonna give it to my neice as color markers&#x27;.</li>
    <li> I did not like the markers, because they were not Tattoo markers as listed in the ad; they were just plain dry rotted old markers.&lt;br /&gt;I received a refund.</li>
