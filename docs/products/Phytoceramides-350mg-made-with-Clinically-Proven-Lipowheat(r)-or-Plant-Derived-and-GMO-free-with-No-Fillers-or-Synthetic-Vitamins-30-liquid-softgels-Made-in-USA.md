<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have been taking these for approximately two months now. I have seen a significant difference in my facial skin and my neck. However, I must disclose that I take more than one of them a day. Sometimes I take two in the morning and two at night and there are times when I take three in the morning and three at night. It does not upset my stomach at all and I think that&#x27;s possibly why I&#x27;ve seen such rapid results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I began perimenopause and noticed that my lines on my face were becoming very apparent and that made me very unhappy when I looked into the mirror. I am used to people thinking that I am much younger than my age of 45 and I was now starting to feel like I looked my age and I did not like what I was seeing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My eyelids were becoming very crepy and my right eyelid was becoming more heavy than my left. I was very unhappy about that becoming more prominent. The lines under my eyes were more prominent, my smile lines were much more prominent. I had an overall droopiness look to my face now with awful looking wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can say with all honesty that at this point I have such little crepiness on my eyelids and my right eyelid has actually pretty much lifted where the two now line up so closely that I no longer see the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically what I can tell you is that I fully believe that these Phyto Ceramides do work. I am so much more happy with my facial skin when I look into the mirror. I feel like myself again and I can honestly say that I look freshfaced again. I don&#x27;t even notice my wrinkles and I certainly don&#x27;t notice the droopiness in my face any longer. My make up is so easy to do now also. My facial lines are disappearing and the sides of my mouth where it was drooping significant enough to really have me start thinking &amp;#34;am I really going to have to get a facelift&amp;#34;? I can say with all honesty that they&#x27;ve tightened up so much it&#x27;s hard to believe what I&#x27;m seeing actually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also recommended these to a girlfriend of mine and she has told me how she has seen such a significant difference in her eyes and she&#x27;s so happy. I&#x27;m happy. I&#x27;ve also now discovered the skin care product line CeraVa because I was searching for cleanser, moisturizer, and eye cream that also contained ceramides. I&#x27;ve only used their three products for just a few days, so I&#x27;m really excited to see if I experience even more improvement in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you look and see any of my previous reviews, I give very honest reviews. Mostly I&#x27;m disappointed in products. Not with these. This is one of the most amazing things I&#x27;ve discovered.

    <li> This product does seem to work well!</li>
    <li> Been using the product for 4 weeks and although subtle, my skin does appear smoother and is less dry.  Will continue using hoping that continued use will show additional improvement.</li>
    <li> I having been taking this for 5 months.  The first month I was not so sure anything was happening.  I went on vacation and forgot to take my Phyto-ceramides with me.  I noticed a change to the worse while on vacation.  I resumed taking when I got home and I did see a difference.  My experience was a slow change but there is a change.  I will continue to take.</li>
    <li> Received the order super fast, and have been taken 1 per day for the past 20 days. So far so good, NO any bad feeling or negative reaction. I have ordered another 2 bottles, will continue to the product and with the hope to see my changes in the near future.</li>
    <li> I have tried several brands of Phytoceramides and this brand is by far the most effective. The soft gels, similar in form to vitamin d and fish oil, are much more effective than the capsules sold by other brands.  I&#x27;ve noticed a big difference in the elasticity of my skin, especially after my second bottle.  Pure quality and great results.</li>
    <li> I love the size of the capsule, very easy to swallow--I hate talking supplements because they are always soooo big. If only all supplements were like these! I&#x27;ve only been taking this product for 2 weeks and can&#x27;t really see any significant changes but I&#x27;m looking forward to it soon!</li>
    <li> I was very excited about this product. My sling was glowing and the rest of my body was also softer. I noticed a difference in like 3 weeks. Unfortunately, I started my 4th bottle and the glow is gone and my skin is dry as it used to be. I had not had any other changes still use same products, eat the same way, etc. Did I receive a bad batch or effects subside after a while? Did anybody else experienced the same? Please send me a message if you had a similar experience. I will try another brand. I will appreciate any response. Thanks</li>
    <li> I am 58 years old and soon to be 59.  I am Caucasian and fair skinned.  In the past year I have started to notice crepey skin on my arms and my thighs.  Not happy.  Started taking this supplement with Sports Research Biotin and Dr.&#x27;s Best Collagen type 1 &amp; 3 and there is a major improvement; so much so, that I just purchased my second bottle.  I judge my skin when I get out of the shower, when it is at&#x27;s its driest, before applying all the lotions and cremes and gels for \\&quot;youthful glow\\&quot;.  Major improvement with this. Definetly a keeper</li>
    <li> 27 days no actually 27/30 uses have not seen any results. Debating on buying another bottle or two before I completely write it off.</li>
    <li> I have tried it only for 12 days and have not seen any improvement but will go the month and see results</li>
    <li> I have been taking Phyto-Ceremides for one month and am seeing very positive results.  My skin is smoother, softer and fine lines have disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;The capsules are easy to swallow and I have been pleased with the prompt service from Amazon on delivery.  I have ordered 3 more months supply.</li>
    <li> Phytoceramides with Lipowheat is a great product that hydrates skin from the inside out - I am on my second bottle and my family and friends have been complimenting me on my skin.  I have had zero negative side effects, this is just a Great product, I highly recommend it.  The service was prompt and packaging was sealed.  I will be reordering for a long time to keep my skins healthy glow.</li>
    <li> I first saw phytoceramides on Dr. Oz.  I was very skeptical about purchasing this initially. After all, Dr Oz made it sound too good to be true. I must admit that it wasn&#x27;t as great as Dr. Oz described. However, it makes a small difference. I find that it makes my face glow. However, it&#x27;s not a miracle pill.</li>
    <li> Wow Phytoceramides 350mg Liquid softgel capsules are truly a great product.&lt;br /&gt;I have taken the first bottle and found them to be making my skin so much more softer.&lt;br /&gt;I have even noticed a big difference with my extremely dry scalp as the condition has improved considerably&lt;br /&gt;and am so happy with this product.&lt;br /&gt;It is so true that they work from the inside to outside of the skin.&lt;br /&gt;You can just keep apply creams oils moisture only to the outside its something that has to come from within.</li>
    <li> OMG ...... CAUTION !!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have Very dry skin so I was Excited when I learned about this ..... BUT after taking 1 1/2 bottles I started too Notice I was getting Spots ALL Over my legs !!!!  They Look like freckles, But U can Feel them ! They are like little worts !  I saw a Dermatologist &amp; he said it is called  &#x27; Keritosis &amp;#34; .  I am Covered with it ! He does Not think it is from taking this supplement, But I&#x27;m  thinking it had something too cause this Sudden change....&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m devastated ! They bleed when I try to remove them &amp; now i&#x27;m trying to sof&#x27;n them with heavy duty creams.&lt;br /&gt;Every ones different, but keep your eye on your skin !</li>
    <li> I am giving 4 stars only because I have not seen any startling results yet.  I have just started my 2nd bottle so will give it more time.  Meanwhile, the pills are easy to take and there are no side effects.  Many years of aging will not be erased overnight, so I am still hopeful that I will see signs of improvement  soon.</li>
    <li> This is magic..my skin has never looked so young!</li>
    <li> After trying this product for a month, I&#x27;ve seen results that I normally would not notice in that short of a timeframe. I decided to continue using it to see how much of a difference it makes versus other products that I&#x27;ve used in the past which didn&#x27;t work at all. This is another product that was recommended on Dr Oz&#x27;s show that has proven it does work. Try it and you can see for yourselves.</li>
    <li> I tried these but I like the capsules better from another company.&lt;br /&gt;Look around.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m now on my second bottle and plan to keep using it! I&#x27;m noticing gradually diminishing wrinkles around my eyes and mouth. Love the results!</li>
    <li> Working with this company has been effortless.  I have been using Phytoceramides from Sports Research for a couple months now.  I am 51 years young and my skin feels healthy and hydrated.  My husband says I look 30 something.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been taking this for about 6 months now. Have noticed my skin is clearer and smoother after the 1st month. I live in the desert and I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin seems more hydrated and plump. I panic when I run out now without having my next bottle!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve notice improvement since starting Phytoceramides 350mg a month ago! The improvement is subtle, but enough to make a visible difference. I&#x27;ll continue taking this product for progressive results.</li>
    <li> I have been using for one month and am seeing some results.  My skin seems plumper and more luminous.  Never used this kind of product before - Dr. Oz endorsement means a lot.  Hope this keeps going!</li>
    <li> I love these pills, I have tried another brand of phytoceramides in the past and the pills were large in size,  I LOVE that these pills are small, easier to swallow,  I have been using them for 2 weeks now and already I have noticed my skin is much more hydrated! And I have a healthy glow, I haven&#x27;t noticed any wrinkle reduction yet but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s just too early for that, I&#x27;ll keep using it and see if that changes but overall this is a GREAT product,  wish it would go down in price as it is quite expensive to buy monthly but I will say it is worth it</li>
    <li> I chose this rating since it may be too soon for my results to be seen.  I am just coming up on the first month and I don&#x27;t know if I am imagining some results or if they are really happening.  I will continue for another few months to really determine results or not.&lt;br /&gt;I will update my review after I have used this product for a longer time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 53 years old and was getting dry skin, fine lines and wrinkles.  I&#x27;ve used this product for 30 days now and definitely see a difference!  My skin is no longer dry.  My fine lines are almost all gone!  And the annoying wrinkles on my top lip are beginning to disappear!  It&#x27;s one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve ever made and will continue to use daily! Everyone&#x27;s skin is different, but this sure works for me!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this supplement, from about a week after I started taking them, my skin looked more supple and not dry at all.  I first noticed it on my hands and since I have continued to take them, I have noticed my legs, facial skin all looking less dry, and younger... I will continue taking this supplement. I love it... thanks</li>
    <li> I love the Phyto-ceramides.  They are easy to swallow (tiny soft gel caps) and GMO free with no preservatives.  Great price and a money-back guarantee.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Just one a day.  Small , easy to swallow, no taste softgel.  My skin looks youthful .  WooHoo.  Enthusiastic customer service.  Thanks</li>
    <li> Too soon to tell, but product looks as stated. Easy to take and hope works well.  I am hopeful that this product will deliver results</li>
    <li> Excited! Only been using this for a few days and I can feel a difference in my skin!  I live in a very dry climate.. Las Vegas NV so I need it!</li>
    <li> Well tolerated&lt;br /&gt;Will see if it works&lt;br /&gt;Taking it only few days</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several months now and must admit that I have experienced a noticeable change to my skin.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> my skin has never been in better shape</li>
    <li> Skin feels much better, need to try more to be sure, but so far pleased with results with first bottle</li>
    <li> Have taken about 1/2 the bottle and already see an improvement in my skin&#x27;s hydration!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over a year and it is a part of my daily supplement routine. My skin is visibly more radiant and hydrated and I plan to continue the regiment.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about 60 days and see an improvement in the texture and dryness of my skin. I have dry skin and although my skin is still dry it appears to have made an improvement. I also see a positive difference in my face. I just purchased another 60 day supply.</li>
    <li> I have used Phyto-ceramides for almost a month.  I see a difference in purity of the skin and reduction for me anyway of the brown spots.</li>
    <li> I am a 53 year old male and have been taking SportsResearch Phyto-Ceramides for over 30 days. I believe this supplement has improved the texture and appearance of my skin. My skin is more hydrated, crows feet have smoothed out and I have a healthy glow. I recommend this product as part of any anti-aging regimen.</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping and good communication. I like these phytoceramides. I tan year round and these help keep those pesky undereye lines at bay.</li>
    <li> My itchy skin has improved. I have also noticed that my nails are growing and not breaking as easily.</li>
    <li> WISH THEY WOULD HAVE SPECIALS EVERY NOW AND THEN. BUT STILL LOVE THEM.  also ordered Vitamin D 3. why are there two different style gelcaps inside bottle? one is clear and the other a smoky off white, which tends to look like Biotin.</li>
    <li> I heard about this product from a friend who raved about it.  I&#x27;m one of those people who will try almost anything and usually end up sorry I spent the money.  That definitely does NOT apply to this product!  Even after only a few days I&#x27;m noticing an improvement in my skin; I swear it feels more firm.  Like some other reviewers, I have tried cheaper products with no success.  An added bonus is that it&#x27;s gluten free.  I will definitely be purchasing this product again!</li>
    <li> I have been taking Sports Research Phyto-Ceramides 350mg liquid softgels for exactly 21 days.  I did not expect to notice any potential improvements until after a period of at least 6 weeks.  The improvements that I have already noticed: 1) more hydrated skin; 2) less facial redness; and 3) a smoother complexion.  It is my intention to continue taking Sports Research&#x27;s Phyto-Ceramides as it is proving to me to be a worthy product.</li>
    <li> very nice item, fast and safe shipping. I am very happy. thank you so much!!!</li>
