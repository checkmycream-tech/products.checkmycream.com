      <li>Smells better than the nail polish remover you find in the store.</li>
      <li>I like the OPI brand remover better but</li>
      <li>Satisfied with the results</li>
      <li>On the other hand, it smells quite nice and works perfectly as nail polish remover!</li>
      <li>This product was not as strong as I had hoped.</li>
      <li>Liquid did not have a strong order.</li>
      <li>This stuff is really strong</li>
      <li>, I will most definitely be buying more!!</li>
      <li>strong and useful !</li>
      <li>works great on regular nail polish as well</li>
      <li>This may work better with different brands of gel nails, but it does not soak off sensational gel polish.  </li>
      <li>It was super easy to take off stubborn glitter nail polish.  </li>
      <li>Great product, works much better than the watered down stuff you buy at the cosmetic counter.</li>
      <li>I expected a more effective ( i.e. faster and more thorough ) nail polish remover than the cheap drugstore variety but that is not what I got.  </li>
      <li>Nothing special.</li>
      <li>I LOVE this stuff it soaks off the nails and acrylic really well</li>
      <li>I love how fast this works.</li>
      <li>removing the gel was a pretty easy process...</li>
      <li>a big bottle at a good reasonable price!!</li>
      <li>My normal nail polish remover works better.</li>
      <li>I was expecting to not be able to smell the coconut scent over the acetone, but was pleasantly surprised that it does smell like coconut!</li>
      <li>Do NOT take a big whiff expecting to smell nice coconuts.</li>
      <li>Regular nail polish remover works better.</li>
      <li>So for customers who are looking into buying it, it really works!</li>
      <li>Even with buffing first and cotton/foil soaking, it did not work.</li>
      <li>I found that both brands actually work better for me if I do not try filing off any of the polish before applying the remover.</li>
      <li>A clean nail ready for new polish.  </li>
      <li>It successfully removed my gel polish, although it left my nails and fingers very dry.</li>
      <li>I use it with cotton and tinfoil wrapped over my nails and after 15 minutes it softens my polish but doesn&#x27;t really release it from my nails.</li>
      <li>Soaks off remarkably fast with no damage to the nail bed.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping /</li>
      <li>Just got it yesterday and really like it.  </li>

      <li>It works very well at getting glitter polish off...</li>
      <li>, i got my item on time and my product was super protected thank you to the seller for such care of my product</li>
      <li>However, it feels a little more moisturizing.</li>
      <li>I am totally surprised how fast this takes products off.</li>
      <li>I have got to say, this removed gel from my nails MUCH quicker than the 100% acetone in the clear bottle</li>
      <li>After applying new polish, take care of your hands and moisturize.</li>
      <li>Just used this for the first time last night.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know what is much difference between this and the same company&#x27;s 100% acetone (the clear stuff) besides the coconut and hydration stuff.</li>
      <li>It even removes old paint from wood...</li>
      <li>Product is ok I but can get the same results with a less costly product on my local Walmart shelf.</li>
      <li>I will use the clear stuff to remove regular polish but this will be my go-to for my gel polish!</li>
      <li>Did not dry out skin after use.</li>
      <li>Removes shellac easily but is a little messy - but all of the removers for these products are.</li>

<li> Removes shellac easily but is a little messy - but all of the removers for these products are.</li>
<li> Haven&#x27;t noticed a big difference between this one and the generic acetone you get at Target, other than the price.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure if I scraped too hard, or if my nails were weakened from a shellac nail polish, but it seems to me that my nails are chipping/peeling/breaker much easier than normal.</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t need to soak my nails as long and</li>
<li> It does dry out and remove all oil from your nail but isn&#x27;t that what you want?  </li>
<li> Afterwards, i used cuticle cream because my nails were dry and proceeded with my at home mani.  </li>
<li> of course it&#x27;s going to dry out the skin around your nails.</li>
<li> but they dry nails</li>
<li> no normal nail polish remover stink</li>
<li> The only thing I can compare it to is the gelish brand remover which I think works a little better and doesn&#x27;t dry out my nails and surrounding skin as bad as the ONYX.</li>
<li> This product works as expected.</li>
<li> I would have had it done tonight but the Nail places closed because of a storm.</li>
<li> It does seem to have other oils added to it to keep from harming your fingers.  </li>
<li> Superfast removal of gel polish without the extreme harshness of acetone soaking.</li>
<li> But less time than other removers on the market.  </li>
<li> My only complaint is probably its masquerading as smelling like coconut.</li>
<li> No it&#x27;s not a quick process to remove gel polish ...</li>
<li> I poured a little bit into a bowl and soaked for 25 mins and everything came off...</li>
<li> little side note...</li>
<li> It still takes a little time to work the glitter off.</li>

    <li> Works great, much better than anything I tried before!</li>
    <li> Soaks off remarkably fast with no damage to the nail bed. It&#x27;s the best I have used in years.</li>
    <li> This stuff is really strong so you might want to wear a mask while using it, but then again it has to be to get the shellac off.  Use cotton balls to get the shellac off.  It does seem to have other oils added to it to keep from harming your fingers.  I accidently breathed in some of it and you don&#x27;t want to do that.</li>
    <li> Great product, works much better than the watered down stuff you buy at the cosmetic counter.</li>
    <li> Works okay but not as well as I&#x27;d like. I use it with cotton and tinfoil wrapped over my nails and after 15 minutes it softens my polish but doesn&#x27;t really release it from my nails. I have to use a cuticle pusher to scrape the softened polish off. If I leave it on for 25 min or so it starts to lift the polish off but only around the edges of the nails. The only thing I can compare it to is the gelish brand remover which I think works a little better and doesn&#x27;t dry out my nails and surrounding skin as bad as the ONYX. I found that both brands actually work better for me if I do not try filing off any of the polish before applying the remover.</li>
    <li> I was expecting to not be able to smell the coconut scent over the acetone, but was pleasantly surprised that it does smell like coconut!</li>
    <li> It even removes old paint from wood...strong and useful !</li>
    <li> Works great and smells even better...no normal nail polish remover stink</li>
    <li> It works very well at getting glitter polish off...didnt have to soak it for that!</li>
    <li> This product only softens the shellac and then one must scrape off the soften shellac with something like a finger nail.</li>
    <li> Nice quality product!Does the job although takes a while to remove gel polish...you need to soak atleast 15 mins to get that off!So I used an Emory board to scrape and then this to soak off the remainder.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed. This product did not remove my gel nail polish.  Even with buffing first and cotton/foil soaking, it did not work.</li>
    <li> Thank you!!! I like it</li>
    <li> Removes shellac easily but is a little messy - but all of the removers for these products are.</li>
    <li> It works but it takes a while for it come off.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff it soaks off the nails and acrylic really well, I will most definitely be buying more!!</li>
    <li> Didnt get much gel off</li>
    <li> Talks gel off after soaking</li>
    <li> This product has a nice smell not obnoxiously strong.  I put a small amount of liquid in a glass bowl to soak off my old artificial nails.  On the bottle it says soak 15 minutes.  I have to say it took longer than 15 minutes. But less time than other removers on the market.  I had to remove my fingers occasionally as the liquid made my fingers cold.  Yes, this harsh to the skin, very drying.  Used hand lotion and cuticle oil to replenish the skin.</li>
    <li> Get weak nails after using this?  I&#x27;m not sure if I scraped too hard, or if my nails were weakened from a shellac nail polish, but it seems to me that my nails are chipping/peeling/breaker much easier than normal.</li>
    <li> Nice but they dry nails</li>
    <li> It still takes a little time to work the glitter off. Nothing special.</li>
    <li> Good product I will purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what is much difference between this and the same company&#x27;s 100% acetone (the clear stuff) besides the coconut and hydration stuff. Regardless, I bought this since it specifically states its for gel and shellac. I have got to say, this removed gel from my nails MUCH quicker than the 100% acetone in the clear bottle and it didn&#x27;t dry out my nail as bad. It smells pretty dang good (as much as acetone can smell good!) I didn&#x27;t need to soak my nails as long and removing the gel was a pretty easy process... no scraping of my nail! Hey.... I&#x27;m absolutely happy with this product! I will use the clear stuff to remove regular polish but this will be my go-to for my gel polish!</li>
    <li> I use this polish remover to get off various brands of gel nail polish. It works well using the tin foil/ cotton ball method, however it dries out my cuticles and surrounding finger pretty bad. Doesn&#x27;t smell anything like coconut either. I like the OPI brand remover better but for the cost this one works well.</li>
    <li> I am super happy with this nail polish remover.  It was super easy to take off stubborn glitter nail polish.  It does dry out and remove all oil from your nail but isn&#x27;t that what you want?  A clean nail ready for new polish.  After applying new polish, take care of your hands and moisturize.</li>
    <li> Did not take off my gellish gel polish, ended up having to file off after 15 mins</li>
    <li> There is no coconut smell. Just acetone would work. However, it feels a little more moisturizing. So i&#x27;ll soon compare. It worked well, i do like it.</li>
    <li> I bought this at Walmart and hoped to remove my three week shellac nail polish and french tips. I followed the directions, I had to scrape off the polish and still have a lot on the nails. This stuff stinks and hurt my lungs breathing it in. I had to keep the bowl a ways away from me in order to even tolerate it. I am taking it back and going to have my nails cleaned. I would have had it done tonight but the Nail places closed because of a storm. Bummed.</li>
    <li> Awesome product works great and smells good too, i got my item on time and my product was super protected thank you to the seller for such care of my product i recommend this seller to all.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this. Purchased at a local retailer for $2.89</li>
    <li> Works very well with gel polish.</li>
    <li> This product does not remove the gel nail polish as indicated.</li>
    <li> Works great, smells goog</li>
    <li> This product works as expected.</li>
    <li> Just used this for the first time last night. It successfully removed my gel polish, although it left my nails and fingers very dry. My only complaint is probably its masquerading as smelling like coconut. Do NOT take a big whiff expecting to smell nice coconuts. It smells like ammonia.</li>
    <li> Product is ok I but can get the same results with a less costly product on my local Walmart shelf.</li>
    <li> a big bottle at a good reasonable price!!</li>
    <li> Product was great but I found same product, same size, same brand elsewhere for 2.99.  I think I paid 8.00 for this bottle..</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed a big difference between this one and the generic acetone you get at Target, other than the price.</li>
    <li> This may work better with different brands of gel nails, but it does not soak off sensational gel polish.  On the other hand, it smells quite nice and works perfectly as nail polish remover!</li>
    <li> I think this product works great with aluminum, much better than soaking and love tge smell!</li>
    <li> I am totally surprised how fast this takes products off.</li>
    <li> Turned my nails orange will not come off.</li>
    <li> Nothing like the remover they use in salons. It takes forever to soften the polish.</li>
    <li> Great product. Its nice to have the delightful scent instead of the strong chemical smell.  I am extremely pleased with this purchase!</li>
    <li> Works great, very happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> Love the scent! Takes of gel nails quite well!  Satisfied with the results</li>
    <li> I expected a more effective ( i.e. faster and more thorough ) nail polish remover than the cheap drugstore variety but that is not what I got.  The Onyx --used as directed--  took longer to remove gel nail lacquers than the generic nail polish remover I buy at the local drugstore and remove using a disposable cotton pad.</li>
    <li> Takes a while to get the polish off.</li>
    <li> Great Purchase, Thank You!</li>
    <li> This product was not as strong as I had hoped.</li>
    <li> Item was as described. Items was deliever in time agreed upon. Liquid did not have a strong order. Smell was that of coconut. Did not dry out skin after use.</li>
    <li> Works great for shellac and gel polish remover. Has a wonder coconut smell. Try it out.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great. It removed nail polish I hadn&#x27;t been able to get with my acetone pads just like that! I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll need to look around for another nail remover. I love how fast this works.</li>
    <li> This product is great!</li>
    <li> Love this product! Superfast removal of gel polish without the extreme harshness of acetone soaking. You can get it cheaper at Wal-Mart though!</li>
    <li> Use to take off gel nail enamel.</li>
    <li> Poor product, they do not remove gel polish without a lot of work.  My normal nail polish remover works better.</li>
    <li> works great on regular nail polish as well</li>
    <li> Works as intended but is expensive. I can buy a similar product cheaper at the beauty supply store.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping / Great item! Very happy!</li>
    <li> Smells better than the nail polish remover you find in the store.</li>
    <li> Works real well to remove polish.  Just got it yesterday and really like it.  Got it for my daughter who just graduated from Cosmetology school.  Great item!</li>
    <li> I use this nail polish remover to get my gel/shellack polish off. To the people that are rating this product 3/5 stars....it&#x27;s acetone....of course it&#x27;s going to dry out the skin around your nails. Wash your hand and it goes away. So for customers who are looking into buying it, it really works! Also, you can buy it at walmart for 3 bucks</li>
    <li> Regular nail polish remover works better.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great.  I came onto Amazon to read reviews on nail polish remover that is good to remover gel polish and this is the stuff.  No it&#x27;s not a quick process to remove gel polish ...it takes TIME and SOAKING, but it works.  I poured a little bit into a bowl and soaked for 25 mins and everything came off...I didn&#x27;t even have to scrap anything.  Afterwards, i used cuticle cream because my nails were dry and proceeded with my at home mani.  If you&#x27;re looking for a good gel polish remover without using the cotton balls and tin foil trick this is the way to go.  I guess you can use this with that trick too.  I just opted on soaking because i had the time to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little side note...it does not smell like coconut at all it smells like nail polish remover.</li>
    <li> When I received my purchase, one of the bottles had leaked 1/4 of the shellac gel through the bottom of the crack in the bottom of the container.  The package was soaked.  I find the shellac gel does a very good job.</li>
