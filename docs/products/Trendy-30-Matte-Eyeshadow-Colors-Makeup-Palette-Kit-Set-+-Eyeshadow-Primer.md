    <li> I can&#x27;t see the eyeshadow when I put it on. It is sort of transparent. Colors look great in the containers but not on skin.</li>
    <li> First off this product looks like its just one case but it isnt. It&#x27;s two small separate cases. BUT I would say that you get a good variety of colors which is very cool. And to add these colors are very matte and vibrant. There are very few with shimmer but overall I love this product I always wanted some great matte colors and this did the job. With a good primer the colors would go on even better.</li>
    <li> Love the colors, I&#x27;m still learning on how to use my bruskes with this Platte</li>
    <li> excellent product and 100% reliable</li>
    <li> This is a very nice makeup set.  I got it as a Christmas gift for my step sister and she loved it.</li>
    <li> This item is perfect. The colors are gorgeous I love it&lt;br /&gt;For this price and quality everyone should by this product</li>
    <li> Completely awesome! :) I ordered this on Friday, and it arrived yesterday night (Monday). The colors are nice and matte, and the primer works well. The only thing that might be iffy, is that each palette seems to have one of the same blue</li>
    <li> Thought the colors would be better.The primer is not as good as it should be and it clumps up. Its of for a my young daughter but I would not use</li>
    <li> I guess you get what you pay for. Eye shadow really don&#x27;t show up on the eyelids.</li>
    <li> Nice color palette with very vibrant matte colors!</li>
    <li> I wanted some Matte eyeshadows, these are Matte but, I did not like how they apply, you really need a good eye primer to be able to make these look decent. Wouldnt recommend.</li>
    <li> BEAUTIFUL Matte eye shadows I use the daily! Great vibrant colors that last all day! I will be buying more!</li>
    <li> It got here  earlier then I was actually expecting. Got here the 16th, was supposed to get here between the 17th and 22nd. So shipping was fast and easy.&lt;br /&gt;All the colors are beautiful and vibrant, I see no shimmer at all. Perfect matte.&lt;br /&gt;The cases are cute and small, very easy to carry them around in a purse in case of makeup emergency.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I really like this product.</li>
    <li> Overall it was good, shipped on time, none were broken. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was it says matte but most of them are shiny.</li>
    <li> this has not come in the mail I&#x27;ve been waiting for a long time for it and never got it.&lt;br /&gt;If i have gotten it i would have rate it more but i don&#x27;t know what to to say about it.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my daughter to play and experiment with since she is learning to wear and do makeup.I was surprised at how nice the colors were in person.My first impression: nice colors, nice smooth matte to touch which will make them a bit easier to blend.Overall it arrivwe&#x27;ll packaged,NO DAMAGE.</li>
    <li> This keeps showing this picture, which I didn&#x27;t order this yet,but put on my wish list. I did order the Amuse 42 color Matte Palette which I got.There are 22 rectangular shadows in very pretty, well pigmented colors. Then there are also 20 tiny (smaller than a dime)shades in there too. This comes with 2 small palettes. Nice colors in both palettes which some have a little shimmer and some are totally matte. I think I paid $5.95 for these which are a bargain. It&#x27;s a shame the shipping was as much as the product. I would recommend the ones that I got,but can&#x27;t say anything yet about the ones pictured here. I probably will order the ones pictured here soon.</li>
    <li> I just got them last night and I was pretty excited but they come exactly what the picture shows and the primer is in like a lip gloss tube.</li>
    <li> happy with purchase and arrival time. Product works well eith usage of primer and moisturizing</li>
