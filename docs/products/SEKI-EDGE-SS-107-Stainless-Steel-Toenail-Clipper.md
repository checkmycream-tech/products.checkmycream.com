<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is the absolute BEST nail clipper I have ever used.  I now am searching for additional products by this manufacturer.</li>
    <li> this really is better then the others i have used.</li>
    <li> I bought my husband one of these to go inside to one of his Christmas presents (leather toiletry kit). He immediately saw the difference in quality, and ordered himself the finger nail version.  We&#x27;ve both gotten so used to them, we get made when the other sneaks them on business trips. Can&#x27;t go back to Revlon cheapies now! Even got my father his own set last Christmas.</li>
    <li> Best toe nail clippers!</li>
    <li> The strength, craftsmanship and build is more than I expected! I would definitely recommend getting an extra pair of these, just in case they stop manufacturing them.</li>
    <li> So many reviews I won&#x27;t say much, but want to agree with those who are impressed by the gorgeous quality and design of this clipper. It feels great in the hand, and it definitely does the job. Do NOT get your skin in the way, these things are powerful.</li>
    <li> I lobve this ntoe ail clipper.  Nice clean cuts aand easy to grip.</li>
    <li> Just read my review of their fingernail clipper. The same applies here. Both are mediocre knock offs of the Green Bell clippers.</li>
    <li> I thought that spending a little more would mean a nice premium cut and clip feel.  Alas the cut on these is very rough and I&#x27;m back to the classic revlon from the local drug store</li>
    <li> The clippers are well made and are easy to keep in place. The distance between cutting edges is a little narrow which makes it harder to get under the nail. Overall they are a very good cllipper for the money.</li>
    <li> I like this a lot. It&#x27;s a good size for toe nails. I have the finger nail version as well. It is very sharp and high quality. Amazon shipped the wrong one at first but after 30 minutes with customer support we got it worked out.</li>
    <li> Was looking to replace my older clippers.  Read the reviews and some people said this one was just like the others.  Not true.  I feel like I have a surgical instrument in my hand.  Performs the expected clipping but gives me a sense of great control and precision.  The must have clipper in your kit.</li>
    <li> These clippers are easy to use and very sharp. No nail bending. Outstanding! Finally a clipper that continues to stay sharp for longer than one use.</li>
    <li> Booyah - if you appreciate really well made products, this one&#x27;s for you.  If you don&#x27;t loose it you won&#x27;t need any more clippers.</li>
    <li> Are you tired of cheap drug store clippers? Then buy Seki branded clippers. Even the finger nails clippers are tough enough to use for toe nails. The metal doesn&#x27;t bend and they seem perfectly balanced. Pretty close to salon quality or Better!</li>
    <li> If you are coming to this product because others won&#x27;t trim your thick toe nails, go elsewhere. Very disappointed since I expected more after reading all the glowing reviews. Not close to getting on my big toe nail. And the curve of the blade is too much for toenails and will probably promote ingrown nails. I will get the pliers kind with a wider opening for the toenails.</li>
    <li> The clipper is made out of stainless steel.  Using it is very difficult    because of the slippery handle.</li>
    <li> A topof the line product.</li>
    <li> None better, first quality, top notch professional clippers. Well worth the purchase price, you get what you pay for with these.</li>
    <li> I finally wore out my cheapie clippers that I had for 10 years and decided to see what Amazon had to offer.  I saw that rave reviews so I took the plunge.  They are nice clippers, but Im not sure they are quite worth the price I paid.  They dont seem to really cut any better, but they do look good and seem well made!  I guess the best way to justify the price is that they will be the last clippers you will ever buy, assuming you dont lose them.  Where did I put those dang things anyway....</li>
    <li> This will cut through the most grueling of iron-like toenails as if they were butter. Get one or miss out on the experience.</li>
    <li> These clippers are amazingly sharp, making nail trimming completely effortless. Ya know what I hate about those cheap chrome-plated dull-edged clippers that are so common in drug and grocery stores? First, they rust. Second, because they are dull, it usually is NOT a pleasant experience when the clippers finally cut through in a quick snapping motion, sending a jolt through your nerves. Not only that but sometimes the handle will slide sideways mid-cut and bend your nail in a very uncomfortable fashion, sending another uncomfortable jolt through your nerves!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I tried these out for the first time, I could not believe how easily they cut through my nails. Seriously, NO EFFORT needed. They are stainless steel so they will NEVER RUST!! I have a feeling (and a nice one at that) that I will have these clippers for a very very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside about these is my pair has a slight visual defect, almost looks like a drop of liquid/hot metal was dropped on the base during manufacturing. It is purely cosmetic and doesn&#x27;t hinder the action of the clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, these are very highly recommended! Stop using cheap rusty dull clippers! And thanks to all of the Amazon.com reviewers here that make everyone&#x27;s purchasing decisions more informed :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned these for over two years and they work just as well as when they were brand new.  Actually, they still look brand new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received them, I did a visual comparison with my old Revlon clippers.  I saw very little difference; the curve of the cutting edge was ever so slightly different.  And I thought,  \\&quot;Why did I spend so much on these?\\&quot; Initially unimpressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But they are sharp, and the fulcrum, for lack of a better word, is stronger.  They&#x27;re great but I am too cheap to give five stars.  They are expensive.</li>
    <li> Fantastic, the best Toe Nail Clipper I have ever had, by far.</li>
    <li> These clippers are absolutely supreme.  Around $20 might seem a bit much, but trust me, it will be the best money ever invested.  I can&#x27;t believe I lived for over 40 yrs with nothing but junk clippers.  Seriously, buy these, now...</li>
    <li> These are awesome clippers.  I never thought I&#x27;d pay this much for a pair, but now that I have them you&#x27;ll never find me buying the .99 ones at the drug stores ever again.  They seem to stay super sharp and actually cut instead of tear.  They also have a nice weight to them and appear to be made very well.  Extremely happy with these.</li>
    <li> I have found the Seki Edge toenail clippers to be the best so far of the ones I&#x27;ve used.  Compared to others (e.g., Trim, Revlon, and a pair of very expensive, professional-style Dovo nippers), the Seki cuts better and easier.  First, the blades are sharper, and, between the sharpness of the blades and leverage of the longer and well-shaped handle, they cut easily with fairly light pressure needed.  Surprisingly, they require less effort/pressure than the professional Dovo nippers that have long handles that fit in your hand like a pair of pliers.  Second, they are easier to hold securely.  The end of the upper/moving part of the clippers has a spoon-shaped curve and a ridge that your thumb more securely rests in/against and doesn&#x27;t keeping slipping off like other clippers.  The bottom part is wide and curves slightly downward so that it fits against your other fingers comfortably and securely.  And, they are hefty, solid stainless steel, and nicely finished.</li>
    <li> Sharp, easy to clip, ergonomic.  Highly recommend this clipper even though it is slightly more expensive.</li>
    <li> Seki brand is by far the most reliable and efficient nail clippers I have owned.  I have another toe nail clipper from this brand with slanted tip for ingrown toe nail.  That angle is so good to use on regular clippings.  Since I also have this straight edge, I will give this to my son.  He is young enough to handle the straight edge.</li>
    <li> Outstanding product. Excellent quality. Worth the  extra dollars for a lifetime product.</li>
    <li> You could probably cut off a toe with these, they&#x27;re damn good.  I have never bought a pair of toe nail clippers before, I have always just used what my wife had or I have used finger nail clippers.  These things cut great, quick and easy.  They feel strong and sturdy, our last pair broke while trying to cut my big toe nail :(  These feel like they will last a long time.</li>
    <li> The best clippers I have ever used!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll never use cheap drug store clippers again. These things cut fast and neat. You barely even have to squeeze the handle.</li>
    <li> Tough,thick nails or softies from the show cut easily, quickly, and with precision. The clippers stay sharp, too.</li>
    <li> I waited one year to post a review. After taking this little guy on many flights and dropping them at least 10 times, I can say that they are rugged. Work as if they are still brand new. Definitely a keeper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The aluminum finish is easy to grip confidently. The edge is as sharp as the day I bought it. If I lost this I would order a replacement without giving another thought.</li>
    <li> Above and beyond the best nail clipper I have ever used.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Anyone who appreciates a proper tool (even for this mundane of a task) should opt for this.</li>
    <li> Stainless steel except for some part in the pivot point, which causes rust over time to accumulate. I&#x27;ve used these toenail and regular nail clippers in the shower and left them wet. After one night rust started to show on the pivot point. There must be an anchor or screw somewhere in the mechanism that is not stainless. The rest of the build quality and materials used is excellent, but disappointing that i&#x27;ve been starting to see rust on these expensive clippers.</li>
    <li> Great cutting action but lacks file for smothing. Doesn\\&quot;t open as wide as cheap ones which could be a problem to some people.</li>
    <li> This relatively large nail clipper is extremely smooth and accurate in operation. All stainless-steel, brushed-finish (blades are polished). Note the Product Dimensions: 3.5 x 0.8 x 0.6 inches. Designed for someone who prefers to create their own nail-edge curve during the cut, the very sharp blades are only slightly concave -- almost straight. Despite its slightly larger size, this clipper is ideal for travel, and its soild construction keeps it perfectly aligned. Narrow curved/arched finger nails (not flatter toe nails) might be better trimmed with Seki&#x27;s smaller-version clipper [[ASIN:B000SSG0FI Seki Edge Stainless Steel Fingernail Clipper SS-106]]</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t quite understand the lavish praise -- it&#x27;s a sharp and solidly-made clipper, yes, but I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s only 2.5x the quality of normal drugstore clippers at 4x the price. If you find the Seki Edge on sale for closer to 15 bucks, then it&#x27;s a more reasonable value. I do appreciate the lifetime warranty though, so if they wear down I will probably use that instead of buying another cheap pair.</li>
    <li> I received these yesterday and the cut is easy and  requires no effort for thick nails. Can&#x27;t believe I have been buying cheap clippers for 35+ years</li>
    <li> I was not disappointed with this product.   I read the other reviews and that is what got me to choose these nail clippers.  I have arthritis in my hands and needed a good tool....I was not disappointed.  Worth the extra dollars!  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Liked it so much - I bought another for a gift.</li>
    <li> Great for thick, stubborn nails.</li>
    <li> I have HARD toenails, and a few of them a thick as well.  After spending way over $20 on numerous sets of toenail clippers that don&#x27;t work at all, or  leave jagged edges, I finally broke down and purchased a set the these.    These clippers are heaver in weight, made of a much better grade of steel than most found on the market  these days, and cut clean through the nail.  NO jagged edges!!      These clippers are worth the money paid for them and should last for many years.</li>
    <li> Ba-dow. These things are amazing simple click and they work super sharp blades highly recommemd</li>
    <li> Large, super well-made clipper does an excellent job.  Some reviewers claim the open jaws are unusually narrow, but I didn&#x27;t find them so -- they open to the same width as my old, beat-up clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one issue: these don&#x27;t have the little nail file thing, you know, with the rounded hook thing that gets under nails and into corners -- I&#x27;m now using my special &amp;#34;Ingrown Toenail File&amp;#34; tool for that job.</li>
    <li> This nail clipper is to a drug store nail clipper as a Samurai sword is to a butter knife.</li>
    <li> I have always been disappointed with drug store nail clippers.  Even if they work well at first, eventually they do a poor job of cutting nails cleanly.  A few years ago, I found a pair of very expensive nail clippers made by a German knife company, and they became my prized possession.  Then my kids lost them.  I have been looking for a replacement ever since.  And now I have found something even better--the Seki Edge nail clippers.  Every household should have several of these!!  And, the price is reasonable, when you consider that you will have these 10x as long as the drug store clippers.  Small things like this can make your life so much easier.  Indulge yourself.</li>
    <li> Rated this toe nail clipper with 5 stars because it is the only one, ever, that doesn&#x27;t slide out of my hand when trying to cut my toe nails.  Cuts with little effort and is worth the price.</li>
    <li> Great, sharp and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> I have been wondering for a long time if there where ANY quality clippers on the market. The pieces of junk that sell in store are horrendous. You can tell the difference in quality as soon as you take it out of the package. Solid construction, very sharp nippers. The effort needed to clip the nail is a fraction of store bought clippers. The cut is smooth, leaving no jagged edges. I have owned these for about 2 months now &amp; I am very happy I found these!</li>
    <li> This toe nail clipper works so much more easily than any other I&#x27;ve ever used....it seems completely effortless.  My only worry is that it&#x27;s so sharp I may snip more than I intend!</li>
    <li> I go through nail clippers faster than any person really should.  I&#x27;ve very picky, and found that most I&#x27;ve used are either poorly designed, flimsy, or just plain dull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are none of those things.  They&#x27;re made from heavy duty steel, and they feel it.  The blades are sharp, and cut cleanly. And, my favorite part, they put a little &amp;#34;ramp&amp;#34; on the handle to keep your thumb from sliding off. Thats a problem I have with most other clippers I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought both the fingernail and toe nail versions, and they are both great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They aren&#x27;t cheap, but you get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If lost, I&#x27;d buy them again.</li>
    <li> Much better than the cheap ones at CVS that I&#x27;ve broken a few of. This looks like its built to last.</li>
    <li> This product is not designed very well. It is big, bulky and difficult to use. It cuts well but it is hard to maneuver.</li>
    <li> I love this toe nail clipper very much! You don&#x27;t need to spend a lot of energy on it. It is very sharp and very easy to use.   It is made of stainless steel and is easy to clean.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t get the fuss about this clipper at all. It&#x27;s worse than the random ones I get from drugstores. I bought both the finger nail one and this toe nail one. Both are difficult to use and tore the nails rather than cutting them. This toe nail one is particularly harder to manipulate due to its size, weight, and lack of help with gripping since it&#x27;s bare metal. When I use it, I feel I give more attention to using the clipper &amp;#34;correctly&amp;#34; to avoid the rough cut (you can avoid it by trimming off tiny bit at a time; forget about cutting out a bigger piece with precision - it won&#x27;t do that) and making sure it doesn&#x27;t slip off my hand and chip off my sink or bathtub or something.  It is ironic how a trivial tool that should not be top of mind at all is demanding attention like that. I wanted to invest into a quality clipper to make my life easier, and that definitely didn&#x27;t happen. I have been hanging on to my drugstore brand clipper for the six months since I got this, and continue to use that old thing instead of this. I only occasionally used this when I am in the mood of &amp;#34;maybe I should give it another try&amp;#34; but this is definitely one of the few times that I feel let down with an apparently popular purchase based on Amazon community reviews.</li>
    <li> The cutting blade really is superior.  It goes through my thick nails with no trouble.  Though it lacks any rubberized/nonslip surfaces, I can still hold it steady left-handed.  Though without a nail catcher, relatively few nail clippings go flying away.  I still think $17 is a lot for a no-frills clipper; but it&#x27;s hard to argue with the results.  It only does one thing, but it does it well.</li>
    <li> Very sturdy but not as wide as I would like. You have to cut twice to get the big toe done.</li>
    <li> My favorite nail clippers, liked them so much I bought a pair for my scrow at work...he liked them so much he wouldn&#x27;t share.</li>
    <li> Cheapskate that I am I put off buying this item for a very long time.  Finally I broke down and ordered and am glad now that I did.  It&#x27;s really quite an improvement over the drugstore purchased trimmer I&#x27;d been using for years, or maybe decades.  The Seki trimmer works extremely well making the (inherently difficult at my age) task of toenail management much easier.  I use them for my fingernails too.  Made in Japan.  No warranty as far as I could tell from the minuscule print on the package.</li>
    <li> This clipper is really great.  It cuts my thick toe nails with ease.  However, I wish that it came with a swivel out pointed nail file like most smaller clippers come with.</li>
    <li> Never had much luck getting a good pair of toenail clippers. I had some Japanese hand nail clippers that were great, so I thought I would stick to Japanese made, since we don&#x27;t make anything in the U.S. any more. I got them and couldn&#x27;t be happier. They cut even the hardest nails like butter. I highly recommend the Seki brand.</li>
    <li> One would think that with some dimpling on the part where you would press down with your thumb, these would not slip, but I&#x27;ve yet to use them where the \\&quot;lever\\&quot; didn&#x27;t move to left or right or just slip out of my hand. You&#x27;d think for this price, it would have been engineered better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I \\&quot;engineered\\&quot; it better by putting a piece of moleskin on the bottom of the level and the bottom of the clipper, and everything is fine. I would have thought the manufacturers would have thought of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, they&#x27;re the sharpest toe nail clippers I&#x27;ve had and certainly do the job. As for leaving sharp edges, every pair leaves sharp edges. You can&#x27;t expect to make one clip and be done.</li>
    <li> Outstanding quality and superb functionality. Should last a lifetime.</li>
    <li> This clipper is much heavier with a smoother finish than the standard clipper and feels good in your hand. It has a very sharp clip and should function well for many years.</li>
    <li> The finger nail versions worked so well, we got the toenail clipper as well. good texture on the painted/anodized surface makes it more secure to hold than the slippery chromed ones. I prefer the size and control of the fingernail clipper even for toenail use but my wife likes this one for toenails.</li>
    <li> I have looked for sometime for nail clippers that I didn&#x27;t think were junk.  These are exceptionally well made.  They function perfectly.  I would buy again.</li>
    <li> I have peripheral neuropathy. I  chose the toenail cutter to use on my fingernails because I believed I would get more leverage.  probably not neecessary as the blade is very sharp and cuts with ease.  not  cheap, but worth every penny.</li>
    <li> This is absolutely the best toe nail clipper I have ever owned. It works great on finger nails too! I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good clipper and works, although reviews here are likening it to the sharpness and clean cut of a samurai sword - I didn&#x27;t get that, just an average cut.</li>
    <li> Though quite expensive for clippers, it really is sharp and cuts through even the thickest of nails like a hot knife cutting through butter.  Would highly recommend it over the $1.95 clippers you would find at a drugstore.</li>
    <li> Thanks to all the other reviewers who gave this such great reviews.... they&#x27;re why I purchased it. No other nail clippers (and I&#x27;ve had more than I can count) can even come close to how easy it is to use and what a great job it does.</li>
    <li> Update 8/2015: I bought a second pair to keep in my suitcase for travel. The original pair are still like-new and cutting perfectly, many years later. Buy with confidence - these are the real deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently, those with unusually thick or curved nails might have issues with the &amp;#34;limited&amp;#34; opening on these, those with teflon fingers might not be able to grasp them well, and those who require a built-in metallic file will be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For 95% of the population, though, these are the last clippers you will ever need to buy. Unless, well, you lose them or someone steals them from you. But otherwise, your search ends here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As almost every other reviewer has said, they cut cleanly and easily through nails, they&#x27;re accurate, they&#x27;re safer because they require less force, and they are made with quality materials. Yes, they&#x27;re relatively expensive. But they&#x27;re worth it, and the difference between these and standard drug-store clippers will impress you. Plus, they have noticeable heft to them, so, if you&#x27;re attacked while clipping your nails, these can also be used for self-defense.</li>
    <li> The only improvements I could make to this would be a rubber grip and perhaps a wider cutting area (it takes two clips for my fingers, let alone toes).  That aside it&#x27;s high quality and very sharp.</li>
    <li> Great set of clippers.  Super smooth cut, and easy to use.</li>
    <li> These are high quality clippers that will be appreciated by anyone who appreciates quality cutting tools.  They are butter smooth and appear as if they will last a lifetime.  These are pricy but the build quality backs up that high price.  I&#x27;m really not passionate about nail clippers and don&#x27;t give 5 stars lightly, but this is a well made product that deserves it.</li>
    <li> At first my husband thought it was an extravagant purchase. However, after I started using the Seki Edge toenail clipper, I feel, it is something that I will use for years. There&#x27;s the power in each clip that I have not experienced in other cheaper brands. It is something that people with hand arthritis can use without difficulty, as there is not much effort in each clip. More people should own one!</li>
    <li> After using cheap drugstore clippers for the past 18 years and dealing with nails that seems to be growing thicker over the years..I finally broke down and ordered these. Once I recvieved them, all I could say was \\&quot;Wow!\\&quot; These work insanely well. Effortlessly cutting through my finger and toenails with precision. Almost too well, I have to watch where I put them because they can quickly slide too far under the nail! These come with a lifetime guarantee but I can say if I ever have to order new ones, they&#x27;ll be from Seki :) I&#x27;d highly recommend these to anyone!</li>
    <li> This is not your old cheap bargain store clipper.  It is a heavy professional nail clipper for both toes and fingers.  It is amazingly sharp and clips with little effort.  The Seki clipper is extremely well made and should last a long time.  It is designed well and is as attractive as a toenail clipper can be. It does the job and well worth the price.</li>
    <li> Just as advertised... Sharp, correctly angled, comfortable</li>
    <li> Bought this item due to all the rave reviews it got.While it is not the usual drugstore clipper that you get for a few bucks this is a good quality clipper that blows the competition away BUT the opening is rather small which makes it impossible to cut toenails.Mine are not unusually thick so i am a bit disappointed in this clipper&#x27;s performance.Don&#x27;t get me wrong these are quality clippers that did a fantastic job on my fingernails but not for the purpose  i bought them for thus the 3 star review..</li>
    <li> Think about it, cutting your toe/finger nail is a LIFE TIME process, that is to say, there&#x27;s no way you can skip this task until your death so it makes sense to get a really good clipper. I purchased this clipper based on the recommendation of other Amazon buyers and have been happily clipping away for a year now. Simply put, this is one of the finest clipper you can get for a reasonable amount of money. If feels solid, performs superbly, and clips like day one even after a year of use. \\&quot;Made in Japan\\&quot; which means quality is virtually assured.</li>
    <li> Perfect clipper! Extremely sharp and excellent build quality!</li>
    <li> This is Japanese industrial design at its peak.  Think of a little Samurai sword for your toenails.  It really is an extraordinarily well-crafted device, beautifully designed, surgically precise and effective.      And thank good old Amazon for offering it at a reasonable price.  I bought it for my 91 year old Mom after her cheapo clipper broke--an odd but wonderful gift for anyone who wishes a glimpse of satori-like perfection in a humble tonsorial device.     The toenails have grown  Now a beautiful clipping  That reveres the Spring</li>
    <li> I used to have a one-off pair of clippers that came in a Nautica grooming kit, which were lost a few months ago. Searching online, this pair came up very highly rated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good:&lt;br /&gt;- They are sharp, and very sturdy. The quality in construction seems to be very good.&lt;br /&gt;- They are large enough to clip toenails, and if you&#x27;re a big guy, they work OK for fingernails (not ideal though)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad:&lt;br /&gt;- Quite large... a lot of handle and manipulate when you&#x27;re trying to use them&lt;br /&gt;- The blades on mine seem to be just ever so slightly out of alignment, which can make for some painful clips on occasion&lt;br /&gt;- No built in file&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, they work pretty well. It&#x27;s hit or miss with nail clippers, even a cheap pair can be the best pair in the world if the blades are aligned well and adequately sharpened.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband to use based on the reviews and he is extremely happy with it.  It works effortlessly and cleanly.</li>
    <li> My wife ordered this clipper for me because she said it stated, it had a wide cutting area. It doesn&#x27;t have anymore space than the ones I currently own. So purchasing this has wasted my time and money. They do work but they aren&#x27;t wide.</li>
    <li> Excellent Item and Fast Shipping! Thanks!</li>
    <li> Best Nail Clipper Ever!!</li>
    <li> Thought there was nothing new under the sun? Embarassed by those ugly, split, and/or overgrown toe nails you just can&#x27;t cut properly with a standard clipper? Almost ready for the podiatrist to do the trimming? Hold on a little while! I found this trimmer on Amazon called the Seki Edge that says it can cut those crazy overgrown toe nails which are causing so much trouble. So I &amp;#34;bit the bullet&amp;#34; and ordered the little fellow. In came the cutest dog-gone clipper you ever saw! Looks kinda like standard clippers, but leverage system is different, and is SUPER SHARP!; and it works!&lt;br /&gt;Grab one of these and you will be well on your way to eliminating another of those &amp;#34;little problems&amp;#34; in life. I heartily recommend, and am pleased that I bought it.</li>
    <li> I misplaced my old clippers , fortunately, for had to try these.  these are great for my tough nails,clean cut and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Seriously the best, smoothest clipping, sharpest, most wonderful toenail clippers I&#x27;ve ever tried!</li>
    <li> I always hated using clippers, but then I had chemo&amp;radiation. Since then my nails have been both very hard and very brittle. I bent and broke a few sets of nail and toenail clippers over the last few months, and finally sprung for these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply put, they are very sharp, but I don&#x27;t really like them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They don&#x27;t have a nail file, but after you trim your nails with these you REQUIRE a file. These are very sharp and cut the nail easily, but leave a knife-like edge of my toes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also find them to be weirdly weighted and difficult to hold when trimming my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sending them back, because that&#x27;s a hassle &amp; I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s no such thing as an enjoyable nail clipper. And, I&#x27;d honestly be very happy with them if they had been half the price. But they weren&#x27;t, so I feel like the price is too high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe if I&#x27;m still using these clippers when I&#x27;m 85, I&#x27;ll feel like I got my $ worth out of them! Ha!</li>
    <li> As described.  Would buy again.  Very sharp and well made</li>
    <li> I knew this when I bought it: It is indeed a fine nail clipper, and it is not worth the money. I bought it on a whim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Under these circumstances, it would be nice if this thing shipped with some sort of small, protective carrying case. That way, I could put it in my traveling bag. I certainly don&#x27;t want to risk damage to the cuttinge edges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, I don&#x27;t think that the handle is \\&quot;cast iron.\\&quot; It is \\&quot;die cast,\\&quot; but I see no evidence of cast iron.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the same toe nail clippers for literally as long as I can remember. Now I can remember far enough back that my previous statement should imply some sort of durability. However durable they were they didn&#x27;t work well. I didn&#x27;t realize this until using these ridiculously wonderful Seki Edge Toe Nail Clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was only due to the ridicule of my girlfriend calling my previous toe nail clippers \\&quot;toe nail clippers they use for dogs\\&quot; that I bought these clippers, but now that I have the dogs can keep those other ones. I&#x27;ve never had any clippers quite this sharp. They could be brand new out of the box from Walgreens, from CVS, or any other store yet these Seki Edge clippers&#x27; sharpness would stand unmatched.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They feel good in the hand, and cut through nails like butter. While I was using the other toe nail clippers for ever, these new clippers seem drastically more durable then any other pair of clippers I&#x27;ve held. With the weight and sturdiness of the actual JAPANESE STEEL that the Seki is made with, it feels less like it belongs under the bathroom sink and more like it belongs in a toolbox (a good thing, by the way).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would also highly recommend to purchase the Seki Edge finger nail clippers.</li>
    <li> This is the sharpest toe nail clipper I&#x27;ve ever used! It cuts my toe nails so easily, it&#x27;s like paper! Nothing to complain about this one! Might be a little more expensive than the average toe clippers, but it&#x27;s definitely worth it. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I know this is just a toe nail clipper we&#x27;re talking about here.  But we all need to clip our toe nails, and this is the best toe nail clipper in the world.  None I have ever had before compare to this fantastic clipper.  I was visiting friends who let me use theirs and I immediately purchased one!!</li>
    <li> I had been using cheap drug store nail clippers my whole life, but my last pair broke so I went to the same place I buy everything nowadays: Amazon. And ended up buying this pair.  I just used these for the first time, and my reaction was, \\&quot;Holy swear words! These are sharp!\\&quot; One snip and my nail is done. They are big, they are sharp, and I love them.  Not very precise though, if you are concerned with that (I&#x27;m looking at you, ladies).</li>
    <li> This is beautifully manufactured and cuts finger and toe nails flawlessly.  Best of all it&#x27;s easy to use.  Well worth the price and you don&#x27;t need anything else.</li>
    <li> Very effective product and extremely well made. Highly recommended. I purchased 5 different brands to test for gifts.  This one was the best of the lot.</li>
    <li> These clippers are made by the same people who make the Samurai sword in the mountains of Seki, Japan. How cool is that?!</li>
    <li> I have tried many clippers over the years and this Seki is with out a doubt the very best.</li>
    <li> I lost a good pair of toenail clippers and bought a few cheaper supermarket pairs to try and replace them. They were both awful so I looked for a pair that received a lot of good reviews here. I found these and took a chance. I&#x27;m glad I did because these are the best clippers I have ever had. I would recommend them to anyone so if you&#x27;re on the fence about spending this much on a simple pair of clippers I would say go ahead and get them you wont regret it.</li>
    <li> Yes I loved the easy action on the SEKI large clipper, Cutting heavy nails is a breeze. I let my parents use it. they&#x27;re 80 and have heavy OLD nails.... Dad has his done at the podiatrist. Mom took this cutter from me tho, she loves the ease of use and great cutting action.&lt;br /&gt;I am left with the SEKI in grown nail cutter which I find easier to use than the larger SEKI that my MOM took.&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful cutter&lt;br /&gt;Tom&lt;br /&gt;10/15/12  -  my Mom and Dad enjoy the ease of the cutting of their \\&quot;RHINO_HARD\\&quot; nails. Well worth any extra dollers they cost over inferior cutters...If it&#x27;s not a SEKI it&#x27;s an inferior cutter.</li>
    <li> With nail clippers being an impulse buy at CVS that end up not doing the job, it&#x27;s amazing to find something that juts plain works. I bought a set of these for my brother and he couldn&#x27;t be happier as well.</li>
    <li> Very sharp, be careful! Very effective too, which is the most important thing.</li>
    <li> Opening for the toe nail is too small.&lt;br /&gt;Difficult to get on the nail!</li>
    <li> Most folks don&#x27;t give nail clippers much thought until they don&#x27;t cut or you have to nearly bend the clipper before it goes through your nail.  Not these.  They&#x27;re incredibly sharp and very well made.    Basically you get what you pay for.  A well made product for a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I used to use a fingernail clipper on my toes but the curvature would cause bad results and I had to try really hard not to cause ingrown nails. With this toe nail clipper, I can do my toes much more quickly and safely.</li>
    <li> Best clippers ever!  Quality, very sharp, throwing away all those old, dull, cheap clippers.  My husband loves them!</li>
    <li> Perfect.  Just perfect.  Until I got these I had no idea just how horrible the nail clippers from the drugstore are.  These cut so smoothly it is unreal.  Really a wonderful product</li>
    <li> This clipper does a great job on all but my big toe toenails. The jaws don&#x27;t open wide enough for them but on the others it makes a smooth easy cut without causing the clippings to fly across the room. I am going to try the Seiki clipper for ingrown nails to see if it can do my big toes.</li>
    <li> I EXPECTED BETTER FOR THE PRICE.  PERFORMANCE IS ONLY AVERAGE COMPARED TO OTHER CLIPPERS.  THE CUTTING EDGE IS A BIT LARGER THAN MY OTHER CLIPPERS, AND THAT FEATURE I  LIKE.</li>
    <li> I reviewed the fingernail clippers separately - but figured that since I spent almost $20 on each clipper, I should review each one.  The long and the short of it is, if you are looking for the best pair of clippers out there, look no further.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toenail clipper, much like the fingernail clipper, will knock your socks off - and make you look forward to cutting your toenails.  The hardest part about cutting my toenails now is contorting into position (which, ok, isn&#x27;t all that hard - but puts into perspective the ease of using this clipper!).  I could not recommend the quality and functionality of an item higher - it is worth the price premium.</li>
    <li> I LOVE these toe nail clippers.  They cut toe nails with ease.  The finish is smooth also.  I get pedicures every 3 months, so I do cut my toe nails often in between pedicures.  These make the job so easy.  I highly recommend these to anyone.</li>
    <li> Very effective. Very sturdy and well made.</li>
    <li> The Rockefeller of toe nail clippers...  what else can I say?  You&#x27;re hard pressed to find anything better.  It cuts through my hardest nail like butter... and my fiancee&#x27;s too.  His nails are so hard...  I love this thing and am assured I will never have to purchase another toe nail clipper again.  Nor will I ever curse it for not cutting properly.  This is the best of the best.</li>
    <li> This toe nail clipper really worked for me. I had a particularly difficult toe nail that no ordinary clippers could cut, and this clipper did the trick immediately. I got exactly what I paid for, and I&#x27;m grateful.</li>
    <li> Purchased this toenail clipper thinking it would have a larger opening for ...&#x27;older&#x27; toenails. Not the case. Not any different from the type found in drug store for much less.</li>
    <li> I found this to be very effective foe trimming my nails, the trimmer is sharp and well built also operates smoothly</li>
    <li> I have purchased many clippers in search of the ones that will do the job. Found them!</li>
    <li> These are solid. Sometimes you just have to buy quality. These work fine for both toe and finger nails. No need to buy the finger nail clippers. These work fine.</li>
    <li> I wish it had a built in under toe digger (what else do you call that) anyway, great product. worth the extra cost</li>
    <li> I bought this a year ago and it&#x27;s rusting already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The claim that it is stainless steel is untrue, the pin will rust as shown in the picture. For that, you may as well buy a cheaper nail clipper. I tried to get the company to refund me or send me a new one that doesn&#x27;t rust but they were not very helpful, hence this review is well deserved.</li>
    <li> My girly toes curled in fear when they saw how sharp the Seki edge toe nail clipper was, but when I easily cut through the nail without grabbing and tugging, bending the nail because the edge is dull, or several swipes to get all the nail they uncurled and sat beautifully trimmed on the edge of my feet.If  But..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My twenty something sons happened to be hanging around so I asked them to trim their Ogre-like gnarly toenails and the Seki edge clipped right through their thick nails turning their feet from Ogre scary to prince charming.</li>
    <li> I love these! Great quality, good price and does the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had these for a while, and they&#x27;ve never failed to disappoint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Great balance, really sharp, a stark contrast from the Revlon nail clipper I&#x27;ve been using for the last 30 years. Not that the Revlon is bad, it definitely got the job done but this product is just plain great.  It&#x27;s really not all that expensive.  I recommend you try it.</li>
    <li> While it was difficult for me to spend this much on something so simple as a toe nail clipper, the thing is simply amazing.  No more having to \\&quot;crunch\\&quot; my nails.  This thing cuts like a hot knife through warm butter.  As long as it stays sharp...should prove to be a worthwhile investment!  I would definitely recommend this purchase!!</li>
    <li> I bought this clipper since I&#x27;ve had bad experiences with cheap ones that wont cut no matter how hard you press (one even broke apart first before than the nail was subdued!!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far this have been pretty good, its your regular nail clipping experience, but well done. You press, nail gets cut. You don&#x27;t have to fight it, and that is worth the extra money to me. I like the look and feel too, they are sturdy and with good weight and a nice texture.</li>
    <li> I have purchased many clippers over the years.  As I have gotten older it has been increasingly difficult to clip my large toe.  I read somewhere that when you have thickened nails you should clip on both sides an then cut the remaining nail in the middle.  It works quite well for me especially if you have been soaking your feet in warm-hot water.  it cuts the smaller nails with ease.  If your nails are especially thick you might consider going to a Podiatrist.  As a RN i managed a geriatric unit in a hospital setting.  Most people had not been caring for their feet so we had quite a few major problems. I arranged for a Podiatrist to come in once a week. We had plenty of business for him.  If you have diabetes or circulatory problems I highly recommend you see a Podiatrist if this is possible.  Infections are very common and can become a major problem that could require hospitalization.  Infections develop quickly and result in severe pain and swelling and require IV antibiotics.  Make sure your MD or Nurse Practitioner checks your feet when you visit them.  With all that said I definitely recommend these clippers.  They can do the job easily.  As others have noted the blades are much sharper than your typical clipper so be careful!</li>
    <li> Right out of the package these clippers impressed.Very sharp so they cut through even a thick big toe nail effortlessly.It looks like the cutting blades are perfectly aligned and very sharp.Construction quality is very good and it looks like they will last a long time.The toe nail clipper is so good I don&#x27;t think I even need the  smaller SEKI finger nail clipper.Very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I just received my nail clipper and decided to give her a try. MY GOD it really is amazing. I know people say, whats the difference? its just a nail clipper? but this baby is like a surgical scalpel. it cuts effortlessly and makes clean cuttings. well worth the money. made in Japan, stainless steel. get it and clip away. thats what I did :)</li>
    <li> If you are 75ish as I am, you have a need for an easier-to-use toenail clipper that doesn&#x27;t require huge amounts of strength. Works really well.</li>
    <li> By far the best nail clipper you can buy. Very, very sharp and handles well while trimming. Easy to recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought this clipper because of the good reviews on amazon. I was very disappointed: It didn&#x27;t work very well at all --you have to cut several times. In fact, its performance is much worse than any cheap (but new) clipper. The problem of seems to be that the two halves of blades are slightly misaligned. I probably got a bad one. But I think buyer should be aware of the risk.</li>
    <li> I originally purchased these clippers to be a gift. After speaking to a few folks, I was convinced a watch might be better for the intended recipient. I received the CLIPPERS quickly and without incident. I let them sit around unopened for a few days, until deciding that I would keep them for myself. It turns out that I have never used a quality-made CLIPPER up to this point in my life. I am over fifty. They are very nearly a work of art. The metal surfaces are flawlessly smooth, the quality is immediately noticeable. I opened the handle to the cutting position and held the clippers, positioned for use. I was impressed with the ergonomics of the various control surfaces, the indention on the handle for your thumb position, the grooves cut through the base, providing a slip free grip. These clippers just fit your hand. The action of the cutting stroke is short and precise, no side-to-side sloppiness that you get with cheap clippers. The blades CUT. It isn&#x27;t work. You position the clippers and work the lever, the clippers actually cut the nail...all the way through, without smashing or pulling. Highly recommended. Best gift I ever bought for someone else!</li>
    <li> I always buy the cheap cutters but thought I&#x27;d try this kind based on previous reviews.  Like night and day.  I highly recommend these clippers.  Very sharp, good leverage.  Cuts clean with no effort.</li>
    <li> These clippers are sharp, heavy duty and well-made. They make fast and *easy* work of some pretty thickened toenails that have previously broken several pair of drugstore clippers and that have even defied low-end nippers.</li>
    <li> These babies are sharp and need little pressure to get the job done. An unusual analogy I admit, but they cut like butter.</li>
    <li> These clippers are somewhat pricey compared to \\&quot;drug store\\&quot; clippers but they stay sharp and are very durable. I&#x27;ve had these a couple of years and they seem as tight now as when they were brand new.</li>
    <li> Seki Edge makes some of the best nail clippers out there. Our whole family now uses it from small baby (different size clipper of course), to wife and myself. We turn to this product as it affords a clean cut.</li>
    <li> these are THE BEST toe nail clippers that i have ever used. my husband requested them after i purchased the fingernail clippers by seki edge.</li>
    <li> Although the design is pretty much the same as other toe nail clippers, the build quality is outstanding. I was a bit disappointed that the jaws do not open wider than typical clippers but they are built to last forever.</li>
    <li> Best Toe Nail Clippers that I have ever owned. Super sharp and quality heavy duty construction. No flexing or mis-allignment.</li>
    <li> I bought these to cut my elderly Mother&#x27;s toe nails.  They are difficult to manage, and these clippers do the job.  They are very easy to use and durable.</li>
    <li> Best clippers we have ever had. Well made and work well. We liked them so much we got one for a gift.</li>
    <li> After spending about $20 dollars during the past 12 months on regular nail clippers from places like (ULTA, Target, Walmart), I decided I couldn&#x27;t take it anymore and did a few google searches for &amp;#34;Best nail clipper&amp;#34;, after researching (randomly for a few days), I decided to just invest on this close to $20 dollars nail clipper.... I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks and I have to admit that is the best nail clipper I&#x27;ve used in my life.  It is sharp, and it cuts extremely smoothly, so smooth that one doesn&#x27;t need to put as much pressure as one would with the cheap Chinese ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this Japanese nail clipper I won&#x27;t go back to the cheap brands.</li>
    <li> It is hard to believe how much better this is than other clippers. It is well worth the money, for sure.</li>
    <li> Cuts through the toughest toe nails with ease.  Sharp fine edge makes easy clean cuts.  Well worth the cost. A good investment.</li>
    <li> bought these because I thought they would last -- they are worse than the cheap ones.  tried to return but it was outside the window.  this is blatant false advertising</li>
    <li> The quality of this item is outstanding. It&#x27;s worth the extra money up front. We&#x27;ve had it for years and it&#x27;s been great.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;d broken at least 3 cheap drugstore nail clippers before i bought the Seki.  it cuts through toe nails like a hot knife through butter, is solid in the hand, and feels like it will never break.  the blades are sharp enough to require some care while clipping. a superior product for hygiene - never buy  a cheap clipper again!</li>
    <li> I have really thick nails and most clippers struggle to cut cleanly.  These clippers are sturdier and do the job efficiently.  They are pricey, but I have kept them for over a year.  The search for good clippers ends here.</li>
    <li> This clippers are actually clippers. Let me explain: they actually clip your nails as opposed to others which seemingly pinch/tear/break the nail away. It is sturdy and sharp, definitely a premium purchase. Love it, I won&#x27;t clip my nails with anything else.</li>
    <li> These clippers actually make it a joy to cut toenails.  They are substantial clippers, with an attractive stainless steel finish, and feel like they&#x27;ll last a lifetime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are also sharp as can be.  So sharp, in fact, that you might remove a little bit of skin and not notice it.  But as someone else has mentioned, the grip could have a rougher texture.  I found it too easy to have them pop out of my fingers if I wasn&#x27;t holding the clippers firmly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for cutting, these take the cake.  They don&#x27;t chop at the nail and fragments don&#x27;t go sailing across the room.  It just neatly and precisely slices the nail off, exactly where you place the cutters, with very little pressure required.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are worth the price.</li>
    <li> I waited quite a period of time to receive these clippers and they finally arrived.  Now I find they feel like a good weight but they do not cut nails.&lt;br /&gt;Which is the purpose of nail clippers!  Do not buy them.  I wonder if they are the same one everyone else is talking about?</li>
    <li> Very impressed with this clipper. It&#x27;s extremely sharp (probably the sharpest I&#x27;ve ever used)and I&#x27;ve had no problems with the handle slipping. The ones in drugstore&#x27;s can&#x27;t hold a candle to these.</li>
    <li> This is one hella expensive nail clipper.&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately- it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;My husband is super picky about his nails, and he loves this. Every time he uses it, he has to show me how perfect his nails are after.</li>
    <li> Nice, pretty big but get&#x27;s the job done. Cleans cut so no complaint there. Definitely recommended.</li>
    <li> excellent product, but dulls after a while</li>
    <li> These clippers while expensive feel very high quality. They can cut through Shrek&#x27;s toenails like a hot knife through butter.</li>
    <li> These are nice clippers, but I really miss the under-nail digger and filer that comes standard on the 35 cent drugstore clippers. For the price, these clippers should really have all the bells and whistles, don&#x27;t you think?    I won&#x27;t buy this again, they&#x27;re \\&quot;just clippers\\&quot; to me. And they&#x27;re lacking features.</li>
    <li> This clipper makes cutting nails a pleasant experience. Very high quality material and great craftsmanship, looks like it will last forever.</li>
    <li> Nail clipper was too sharp.  This is dangerous for people who have problems with their feet affecting the ability to feel pain etc.</li>
    <li> Simply put, these are the best toe nail clippers I&#x27;ve ever bought. Before settling on this one, I tried a few others, which cost less, but the quality wasn&#x27;t nearly as good. This Seki version costs a little more than average, but it&#x27;s completely worth it.</li>
    <li> These definitely cut well enough, but as soon as you get them out of the box, you see that the construction quality is shoddy.  They just look cheap, with very rough finishing.  Additionally, after a few weeks, they started to rust terribly and are now a rusted mess.  This is only from keeping them on my bathroom shelf and never getting them wet.  Low quality product way overpriced.  1 star.</li>
    <li> How good can a nail clipper be? Just try this one. It is far superior to anything I have ever used before. Clips effortlessly and perfectly.</li>
    <li> Sound engineering design, materials appropriate to function, careful manufacture combine to create a product that works as well as possible and portends to last a lifetime.</li>
    <li> Heavy duty clippers.  Something that I can get a good grip on and trim my nails.  So much better than the ones in various stores.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not just advertizing hype, in my opinion; these really are the best nail clippers in the world! The quality of these clippers is outstanding. Fit, finish, esthetics and feel are, again, outstanding. Functionally, they are so sharp that minute portions of the nail may be removed and the cut&#x27;s finish is as smooth as though a file had been used.</li>
    <li> We used to have an old Revlon brand clipper which was really good, but it was lost. After trying a few drugstore clippers, I quickly found out how poor quality they are. Searching here on Amazon, I found great reviews for this and decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;The cutting is clean and takes little effort. The first time I used it, it felt like I wasn&#x27;t really cutting anything!&lt;br /&gt;I was used to hearing a sharp &#x27;click&#x27; sound when cutting, but these are so sharp they create a lot less sound.&lt;br /&gt;The precision cut may need a little getting used to because the first time I used it, I created a few thin slivers on the end of my nail that I could feel but didn&#x27;t see. So now I&#x27;m sure to wear my glasses!</li>
    <li> These clippers are no different from those carried by Walgreens or CVS. They are completely unusable on my thick, rock-hard nails, and are grossly overpriced</li>
    <li> These are wonderful and cut my ugly toenail so easily.  Had problems with previous drugstore slippers.  Would have to make several cuts and risk raggedy edges.  These cut so quickly and easily.  I just ordered the fingernail clippers and a couple of extra pair for Xmas stockig stuffers.  The design is lovely too.</li>
    <li> Yes, they are more expensive than most, but the quality is undeniable.&lt;br /&gt;Even with small hands, these clippers are easy to use. I like the brushed metal finish and the grooves on the underside of the handle.&lt;br /&gt;This is my second pair, thought I preserve the edge and make one for travel use.</li>
    <li> very sharp.  cuts with very little effort.  almost too little.  the only weird thing is the handle visually doesn&#x27;t match the rest of the clipper.  it works fine just visually inconsistent from a design stand point</li>
    <li> The best nail clipper I&#x27;ve ever used.  It&#x27;s very sharp.  I thought it might be an issue, not having a nail-file built-in, but this clipper is so sharp and cuts so cleanly, that I really don&#x27;t need a nail file at all.  That surprised me.  It&#x27;s got a good amount of &#x27;leverage&#x27; too, which I love.  My big toes have very thick nails and I need a good amount of leverage on my clippers to cut them.  These Seki&#x27;s work great on all my nails.  Very good quality clippers.</li>
    <li> This nail clipper makes cutting nails a easy job.  It is a very nice&lt;br /&gt;instrument.  It is a high end nail clipper.</li>
    <li> The handle design makes it much easier to cut toenails.  I have also used it effectively on fingernails.  Be careful as the blade is sharp.</li>
    <li> The \\&quot;BEST\\&quot; I have ever used, heavy, solid design and manufacture...very sharp and clean cuts, no nail file needed...nicely sized for a man...well worth the extra cost. They also work great on fingernails. Longevity is yet to be determined, but the quality of edge appears up to the challenge. Too bad an American company didn&#x27;t make it.</li>
    <li> Finally, a pair of clippers that feel like the tools my father passed down to me, and cut as you would expect. Now I have to hide them from my family.</li>
    <li> Way too big so you can&#x27;t reach the corner or edge. The nails flying everywhere so I&#x27;ve to use it outdoor only. Sharp though.</li>
    <li> Sharpest pair of clippers I&#x27;ve ever owned.  If the nail fits in the jaws, it will slice through with ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only surprise was that there was no swing-out nail file as is typically found on other clippers, but I just kept my old Revlon clippers for that purpose, since that&#x27;s about all they are good for after less than a year of owning them.</li>
    <li> These are the best nail clippers on the market, hands down! I take care of my mom who has very brittle, thick toes nails and these go through them easily. I had such a hard time before I found these. They&#x27;re a life saver and worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I always had difficulty clipping my nails with my old toenail clipper.  It was a lot of effort for something that I think should be so simple to do and it was also hard to cut the nails.  I bought two because I always felt with my old clipper that I needed another clipper to do the edges.  The Seki Toe Nail Clipper was so easy to use and took very little effort.  I finished so quickly.  I never even opened the In-Grown Toenail Clipper because I didn&#x27;t need it.  I told several people I know to purchase it.  I wish I had it years ago.</li>
    <li> Cuts your oyster shells like a surgeon&#x27;s lazer! Has the heft and construction of a Rolex. Keep it in your grooming kit and don&#x27;t tell your wife.</li>
    <li> I use these toe nail clippers for my finger nails. I own 2 of them (@home &amp; 4 travel). Words can&#x27;t describe how great they are. I can&#x27;t imagine anyone couldn&#x27;t love them.    N.B. I don&#x27;t think these or any clippers of this style could work for toe nails.</li>
    <li> Great quality. Clean cutting.Good weight and finish. The finger nail size seems a bit small. Toe nail size is perfect!</li>
    <li> How thick of toenails do you have to have if these won&#x27;t fit around your toenail?! Maybe a heavy duty pruner from home depot will be a better option for those people than cheap drugstore clippers that chew your nails instead of cutting them, which break in less than a year. I&#x27;ve had the seki edge toenail clippers for 4 years and they&#x27;re just now starting to feel a little dull, but they still cut way better than any crap you find in drugstores and gas stations. I use them for my finger and toenails. These work great for men as fingernail clippers. Clean snip every time. I am reordering and getting some extras to give as gifts as well.</li>
    <li> Very well made and works like a champ.  I also bought the fingernail clipper, but my husband pre-empted it, so I use this.  I think I actually like it better for fingernails.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my 85 yr. old Mom because she was having a tough time with the &amp;#34;made in China&amp;#34; brand. They were off center and required lots of effort to use. The Seki&#x27;s cut cleanly with minimal effort. Worked so well I bought us both Seki fingernail clippers. Simply the best.</li>
    <li> I wish I had bought these many years ago.  They cut thru nails with no issue.  Good weight and size.  Well made</li>
    <li> these are very sharp I think the will stay that way for a lot longer than other clippers the design is top notch</li>
    <li> Purchased this because I was tired of my toenail splitting every time I cut them.  Happily, these clippers do not cause this problem/</li>
    <li> This clipper is larger in size than other clippers I&#x27;ve used and so you can use it with very little effort, which was a surprise to me. Also blade is quite big which minimizes time spent on each nail. I really like it and I think it&#x27;s worth the money.  There&#x27;s also another Seki toe nail clipper for half the price that caught my attention just now, which may be better value: [[ASIN:B000REOEYM Seki Edge In-Grown Toenail Clipper]]</li>
    <li> +1 for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality is vastly superior to the clippers bought in your local grocery/drug store. I threw out all my clippers and replaced with Seki.</li>
    <li> Although this is listed as a toenail clipper, it only works on my smaller toes.  The cutting edges have an \\&quot;over bite\\&quot; and don&#x27;t open very far.  The cut is smooth but many small clips are needed to clip the big toe nail and middle toe nail.  Clipper feels good in the hand and is powerful enough for the job but the jaws are too close together so nails don&#x27;t fit in.  The cutting edge is as narrow as most fingernail clippers.</li>
    <li> These are a bit pricey- but well worth it!  They have a solid smooth feel and have a generous grip for those who lack precision dexterity.  Also, very sharp. Not too much more to write about for a pare of nail clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never thought I would be writing a review on nail clippers, but the Seki nail clippers exceeded my expectations.</li>
    <li> The best toe nail clippers that I have ever owned</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected.  Top quality clippers.</li>
    <li> Beat toe nail clippers I have ever used!! Cut my thick amd ugly toe nails with ease and not even right out of the shower when they are softer. Wpuld highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy.  I have big guy figures and nails. Still have to cut them.  These things are actually the best I have ever seen.  I saw one rating that gave them one star, the reason was basically if you do not have feeling on the didget of the nail that you are cutting do not use.  Someone likley cut themself.  That is likely true. I haven&#x27;t tried, but I am pretty sure these things could be used as tin snips.  These are almost like a power tool of nail clippers.</li>
    <li> OK, when it comes to certain things, I am really picky. And the personal grooming tools I use have got to be high quality and sharp. I don&#x27;t like cutting toenails anyway, but when I have to do it, I want my clipper to be comfortable in my hand and above all, the blades must be sharp and properly aligned. Nothing is worse than a clipper for your hands or your toes that break the nail instead of cutting it. Treat these tools with care and don&#x27;t leave them out where your kids will rip them off. It seems like every time I spend a small fortune on these types of tools, my daughters come over and when I need them, they have walked off all by themselves. So now, I buy really good quality grooming tools such as these and keep them where my kids don&#x27;t know where they are at.&lt;br /&gt;These clippers are great, the blades are so sharp it takes no effort to cut through any nail needing cut. The handles fit my big hands and don&#x27;t slip out while trying to use them. If you are anything like me, spend the bucks and buy a good set of nail clippers and then guard them from getting up and walking away. These will last for a long time if you take good care of them.</li>
    <li> Insanely sharp. Well worth the extra $. Wish they had a file too, but still an easy 5 star item.</li>
    <li> Best toe nail clippers you&#x27;ll ever use</li>
    <li> Best toenail clipper. Works great.</li>
    <li> Broke…was supposed to have a lifetime warranty, but not if it is not sold by Amazon…so out of luck.</li>
    <li> Very sharp, thick/high-quality steel, nice spring action, cuts through nails easily.  There is however one problem.  With any other clippers I have used, if you run your fingertip over the top of your freshly-clipped nail it feels smooth.  But with these if you do the same motion you will feel a sharp edge.  Maybe this is the &amp;#34;Seki edge&amp;#34; lol, but whatever it is it shouldn&#x27;t be there.  It&#x27;s not a huge deal since you can just file it down, but it was a big enough deal that when my Seki&#x27;s accidentally got thrown out, I opted to try a different brand.</li>
    <li> This product met the expectations of what I needed it for. It does what it &#x27;s suppose to do.It is highly recommended.</li>
    <li> What can you say about a nail clipper?  After a couple of months using these, I&#x27;m impressed.  They allow precision control.  I like to keep my fingernails clipped quite closely to ease typing on a laptop computer, and these (and a strong light and good glasses... I&#x27;m over 50) allow me to do the job without any fear that I&#x27;ll cut too close.  I can cut the barest amount of nail off with ease.  My wife saw me using them, and now she&#x27;s hooked too.  Definitely worth the price.</li>
    <li> The subject of clipping toenails is not really something that I expected to be writing about.  However, we all have the need to clip our toenails from time to time, and performing this task is not usually something that we look forward to.  Most of us pickup a cheap set of clippers from our local pharmacy.  After all, one wouldn&#x27;t normally consider spending much money for a tool to perform such a menial task.  Therefore we come to accept the poor cutting quality of these budget clippers.  Unfortunately, for those of us with very hard nails, these cheap clippers can cause splitting and tearing of the nail, and usually leaves a rather rough edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using several of these low-end clippers over the years, most of which ended up breaking before I replaced them, I decided to look for something with better build quality.  I figured someone has to make a quality set of clippers that will last me for years, and I hoped that their cutting ability would be better for clipping my thick, hard nails.  After searching all over the Internet, and reading countless reviews for clippers that were claimed to give excellent results, I finally decided to give the highly acclaimed Seki Edge Toe Nail Clipper (model SE-02/SS-107) a try.  It set me back as much as I would normally spend for roughly 4 sets of budget clippers.  Still, I had faith that it would be money well spent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon receiving the new clippers and removing them from their stylish packaging, I could immediately tell that these were no ordinary toenail clippers.  They are moderately heavy and have a nice satin smooth finish.  The handle is thicker than budget clippers, and the spring feel of the device is firm but smooth working.  When using the Seki Edge clippers for the first time, I was a bit cautious because they are extremely sharp and have an entirely different feel when cutting.  They don&#x27;t make a sharp \\&quot;SNAP\\&quot; like the low-end clippers I am used to.  They cut with an almost scissor like feel.  The twice tempered blades slice through the thick nails effortlessly, and leave a smooth, uniform edge.  The curve of the blades makes a nice, gentle curve to the end of the nail, which follows the shape of the end of the toe almost perfectly.  Another thing that impressed me was the taper of the cutting blades.  This allows a precise insertion of the bottom blade under the nail, and it doesn&#x27;t tend to travel too far under the nail, which would cause the user to cut the nail too short.  The top push handle (or whatever you call it) of the clipper sticks up a bit higher than what I was used to with previous devices, which took a little getting used to.  However, this extra height allows more leverage for your thumb, which makes each cut smooth and requires very little strength.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using these new clippers for the past month or so, and I can honestly say that the Seki Edge Toe Nail Clipper is an amazing, precision tool.  The blades are extremely sharp and the tool cuts clean, without any cracking, splitting or tearing of the nails.  The device is very easy and safe to use.  If you are used to using cheap clippers then this quality tool may take a few days or weeks to get used to, just because it has a totally different feel and angle.  But once you use them a few times you will never want to use anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Seki Edge SS-107 is made of twice tempered Japanese Stainless Steel, with a Diecast lever for extra strength.  The manufacturer states that the cutting edge is hand-grinded and honed for precise cutting.  The lever action is smooth and easy, and the overall design is quite ergonomic.  The clipper assembly measures 3.5 x 0.8 x 0.6 inches, and weighs in at roughly 3 ounces.  This and all other Seki Edge model clippers and scissors come with a lifetime warranty, which covers any defects in materials or workmanship.  They will repair or replace any defective tool free of charge.  They will also sharpen or repair any damaged tool for free, but you must send a check for $5.00 to cover the return shipping costs.  I am quite impressed with how the manufacturer stands behind its product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my new Seki Edge Toenail clippers.  They look, feel and perform like a top quality product.  They don&#x27;t come cheap, but for under $20 they are really not that costly.  If you think of this as a onetime investment, they will certainly pay for themselves over time, as you would likely buy several cheap clippers over your lifetime anyway.  After spoiling myself with the Seki Edge SS-107 clippers, I have since purchased a set of Seki Edge fingernail clippers, and also a Seki Edge Slant Edge In-Grown Nail Clipper.  They are all great products, and I no longer find nail clipping to be such an unpleasant chore.  I highly recommend this toenail clipper to everyone.  I think you would be hard pressed to find a better clipper on the market today.check for $5.00 to cover the return shipping costs.

    <li> I was skeptical about wether nail clippers should be worth more than a buck or two. Now I realize that as with any cutting edge, quality counts. The leverage of the thumb lever and the knife sharp cutting edges, make these a fabulous tool that should last forever. No more shattered nails or rough edges to file.</li>
    <li> This nail clipper is amazing. I bought one for my father and it worked great so I bought another one for my self. You couldn&#x27;t imagine how easy could cut my thick nail. If you try this nail cutter one time, you will never ever use anything else.</li>
    <li> These things are great. They cut through my thick nasty nails (picture the pedicure scene in Dumb and Dumber) with ease. They seem plenty durable. A little rubber on the handles to aid with grip would&#x27;ve been nice.</li>
    <li> My husband was finding it hard to cut his toenails.  This makes the drug store type look like complete junk.  Buy it -- you won&#x27;t believe the difference.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m disappointed with this clipper.  The opening isn&#x27;t wide enough for my fingernail...let alone my toenails .</li>
    <li> Sharp, easy to handle.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t you hate cutting your nails then having to FILE them, because your nail clipper left them sharp, and worse, left them with jagged edges that catch on everything? This nail cutter trims throw nails effortlessly and leaves a clean smooth edge. And since they are stainless, you can even WASH or sanitize them and they won&#x27;t rust!</li>
    <li> Best nail clippers ive ever owned. Cuts like butter. Toes and hands.  I highly recommend the item for anyone interested.</li>
    <li> Have gone thru nail clippers, never finding &amp;#34;The Pair&amp;#34; that actually lasted and worked well at the same time.  Read the reviews on these (Seki) &amp; got &#x27;em.  Any one reading this, they are WONDERFUL....sharp, handle well, OMG, they do the job perfectly.  Frustrated with WalMart clippers?  Clippers fall apart?  Were never sharp?  THIS is the answer.</li>
    <li> This toe nail clipper is basically the same as the nail clipper by Seki (see my review on that), but slightly bigger and more expensive. In my opinion, the regular nail clipper is good enough to handle both your fingers and toes. The blades on these are excellent and should last a long time.</li>
    <li> These are very well made and, as far as possible in toe nail clippers, esthetically appealing. They have remained as efficient in their cutting as they were when new two years ago. For friends and family I have purchased about 9 or 10 pair of the toe nail and the smaller finger nail clippers. So far, only satisfied reviews.</li>
    <li> Who would have thought that someone could have improved the lowly fingernail/toenail clipper, but they did.  We bought one, used it, then bought another for the RV.</li>
    <li> Good quality, seems to retain an edge, I would be willing to pay more if needed.  But this is best clipper I&#x27;ve had, probably good for a Professional.</li>
    <li> This is not a toenail clipper as far as my toenails are concerned. It is great for fingernail clipping, but jawas do not open wide enough for the nails on my foot.</li>
    <li> If you have thick, hard, toe nails; then I highly recommend spending the extra money on these clippers. The handle is made so that it does not slip out of the hand while you are using it.</li>
    <li> This nail clipper works effortlessly when cutting my toe nails and finger nails! In the past, I&#x27;ve had to use two hands to cut my big toenail. These clippers have much better leverage and quality metal that cuts my nail quick and painlessly.</li>
    <li> Great stocking stuffers.  Everyone loves using it because it is made so much better than the other brands and is very sharp.  The quality is worth the money.  How many cheap brands have you bought and they break and don&#x27;t clip well?  Buy this one and you won&#x27;t have that problem.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s worth the price. This thing is a lot... bigger, than I expected it to be. I mean it&#x27;s unnecessarily big. The tip of it is completely excessive and it makes it difficult to grab onto. You&#x27;d think it would HELP, but that&#x27;s not what I found to be the case. It cuts, though when I click down it makes a clicky sound which is really annoying, and it probably shouldn&#x27;t do that. All in all it&#x27;s not bad, but it&#x27;s not any better than the cheaper ones. I&#x27;ve only used it a few times, so maybe it&#x27;s longer lasting than the cheaper ones, but I don&#x27;t know that yet.</li>
    <li> These toe nail clippers work very well.  They cut the nail quickly without having to use a lot of pressure.</li>
    <li> The best nail clipper I&#x27;ve found, and I&#x27;ve gone through a lot.  Have several of these now (in suitcases, different sides of the house, etc).</li>
    <li> These are the top tier of nail clippers, definitely a great price for the quality of clippers</li>
    <li> Works well, only critique it could have a bigger opening for thick toenails.</li>
    <li> I had bought several others but Seki really makes very durable and reliable products. This is japanese made and very sturdy, very well made.</li>
    <li> Super sick. Super quality. I can&#x27;t say much but don&#x27;t use if you have bad eyesight, you can cut yourself.</li>
    <li> I bought this clipper for my tough toe nails and it really works! My only caution is make sure you are at the correct height because once you squeeze the effortless trimmer that is it. they are strong and sharp.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after using the Seki stainless nail clippers.  Both are awesome products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May seem ridiculous but I&#x27;ve owned at least 10 pair of clippers. All of them were capable of clipping my nails. However until using the Seki Stainless, I had never realized how much the old ones squeezed the nail (mild discomfort), then cut it, leaving a rough edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are like using a razor to slice right through my nails. I cannot say enough about how much easier and faster it is to trim my nails and our children&#x27;s. Our kids used to complain that the old clippers hurt. Not a peep since using these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No rough edges to smooth out, no bending my nails - wow! I wish I had purchased them sooner. Worth every penny to me. Will buy more for travel since they aren&#x27;t too big to take with me in my bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I posted the same review for the \\&quot;finger\\&quot; nail Seki clippers.</li>
    <li> To those who complained that these nail clippers were too small and weren&#x27;t able to cut their nails...what kind of giant, rock hard toe nails do you have??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are perfect. They cut through nails like butter.</li>
    <li> Not what I&#x27;d expected</li>
    <li> this cutter created bad cuts leaving big burrs everywhere it cuts; save yourself time and money not ordering this cutter;</li>
    <li> I wish the blade was not curved like a fingernail clipper. Expected a straight edge blade like on most traditional toe nail clippers. Very sharp blade cuts cleanly.</li>
    <li> My husband swears by these clippers, he&#x27;s bought them for years. I&#x27;ve been losing them for years, which is why he always has to order a new one. He&#x27;d rather wait for these (all of two days with our TOTALLY worth it Prime membership, if you don&#x27;t have it, get it!) than run out to the drugstore for a new one. He finally ordered me my own and I&#x27;m not allowed to take his. I have to admit these stay sharp and tight, unlike other brands that seem to grow loose over time. I use mine on myself as well as my 3 kids, fingers and toes. Never a complaint because it cuts fast and easy, which should be a given with clippers but is actually not always the case. A pair of poor clippers can cut jagged and leave you with scary razor toes that will cut your legs in your sleep!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We also have their toenail clipper and ingrown clippers. We are fans of the Seki brand.</li>
    <li> old clippers no good - so I bought these and no regrets. More expensive but they were well worth the money.</li>
    <li> The best toenail clippers I&#x27;ve ever owned to date!!! All the others I&#x27;ve had either didn&#x27;t clip the toenail even though I crimped all the way down! Just not sharp enough! Then some were just not large enough! Others broke easily!</li>
    <li> Toe nail clippers need to be straight across.  These are not and I couldn&#x27;t tell that when I ordered it.  The jaws are somewhat narrow and difficult to get on toenail.  It does not cut well and tore the nail rather than cutting it.  I&#x27;ll be looking for something else to buy.</li>
    <li> A friend of ours broke a nail at our house and asked to use a clipper.  She emerged from the bathroom some time later having clipped all of her fingernails AND toenails because she enjoyed using a quality tool so much.</li>
    <li> I use this toenail clipper for my fingernails, too. Because it&#x27;s bigger, I can get more of the nail in one clip for a nice straight edge on the top. The edges are very sharp - a completely different experience from kind of chomping and tearing off my toenails. It&#x27;s strong and sturdy. I never get that slipping of the pressure lever off to the side that I used to get with other brands. Worth the price. I&#x27;ve had it for a couple of years with no discernible dulling.</li>
    <li> i love it when i use it because it&#x27;s sharp and work smoothly. i highly recomand it for every body.</li>
    <li> A nail clipper is just a nail clipper right? Well, this one has great leverage to it, and the way it feels in the hand is a notch above the standard versions I&#x27;ve used. Only minus is it doesn&#x27;t come with one of those foldout scraper things to get under the toe nail. Not a big deal since I use the one on my other clipper, but it would be nice to have one on this model.</li>
    <li> I grow thick toenails and clipper stop working quickly.  This one is seriously tough and obviously will last for a long time.</li>
    <li> I am extremely pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> Nail clippers are nail clippers right? Wrong. I grew tired of buying cheap clippers, thought I would try these out. You will notice the difference of quality right away.</li>
    <li> Honestly, there isn&#x27;t much that I can say that hasn&#x27;t already been said, but yet I feel the need to add yet more glowing praise for these clippers.  My toe nails are really thick, requiring I squeeze crappy drug store clippers with all my might only to barely get a cut.  That seemed almost dangerous, as if my hands slipped while squeezing that hard I could easily tear a nail.    I decided it was time to pony up for some good clippers, and these really deliver.  They cut straight though my nails, requiring only a fraction of the force of a standard clipper.      They feel solid when held in your hands, and seem like a product which should last.  When you consider what you get for the price, these don&#x27;t feel like these are &#x27;overpriced&#x27; clippers at all.  You pay a little more to get something which actually does the job really well, instead of a poor product which was made only to be as cheap as possible with performance as a distant secondary concern.</li>
    <li> Advancing age has given me thicker toenails. I don&#x27;t know why, but it just is. Cheap toenail trimmers just don&#x27;t work for me anymore. These are sharp, easy to hold and operate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only problem with them is they should be straight instead of curved like fingernail clippers. Other reviewers have pointed this out and they are right. Next time, I&#x27;ll pay more attention and get straight trimmers.</li>
    <li> I have owned this toe nail clipper (and the smaller finger nail clipper) for several years and have been very please with the quality of the product. I am a guy and I found the toe nail clipper a better size for both finger and toe nails. It easily cuts through thicker toe nails. This clipper is far superior to any of the literally dozens of various drug store clippers I have purchase and the only clipper I will purchase again. After several years of use I used a diamond Crystal Crafter file to hone the cutting edge and it again cut like new. As long as it is not lost it should provide a lifetime of use. I did lose my original clipper and just purchased a replacement. The second clipper&#x27;s quality is just as good as the first.</li>
    <li> The best on the market. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> As advertised.  This is the best nail clipper I&#x27;ve had.  Solid, well-built, sharp and clean... compared with cheap ones I&#x27;ve had over the years.  Seems a little price-y, but worth it if it holds up.  Handles thickest toenails without a problem. While the curved cut is perfect for fingernails, it&#x27;s a little too short an arc for wider toenails to be done on one cut... but still doable.&lt;br /&gt;It came within just a couple of days of ordering.</li>
    <li> I was &amp;#34;bored&amp;#34; on a Sunday and was looking up reviews on nail clippers. I had just bought some drug store ones to replace the old ones I couldn&#x27;t find. I thought they must make something better? So I read the reviews and decided what the heck? Wow!!! Very impressed, sharp, quality feel, etc... If I loose these I&#x27;ll definitely buy more.</li>
    <li> The moment I opened the package I know this is not your average joe nail clipper. It is heavy, brushed stainless steel body and so sharp that it go through my toe nails like butter. Why do we need a nail clipper that sharp? Well, if its not, it may perhaps yank your nail off your toe instead of cutting it (it has happened to me)... and Made in Japan quality is a plus. Look like this clipper will last a life time!</li>
    <li> High grade materials. These are very sharp toe nail cutters. For thick toe nails it is still a struggle to cut through them even with  a softening agent. I think the leverage could be better:  a larger size.</li>
    <li> Very sharp, cuts nails cleanly. A bit large and awkward to hold.</li>
    <li> Why didn&#x27;t I get these years ago?!  The nail clippers typically sold at drugstores and other retail stores are junk!</li>
    <li> There are no other words, then amazing. Clipper is fantastic, sharp, easy to use, well built, balanced. After trashing several drug store clippers, went for this one, and will not look back, this is the ultimate nail machine you can ever want. In few words, masterful Japanese craftsmanship.</li>
    <li> Well, at least mine are. I can&#x27;t speak for you. I&#x27;ve forced my toenails off with cheap fingernail clippers my whole life. I don&#x27;t know what happened, but one day I had a burining urge to change that. That&#x27;s when I discovered the Seki Edge Toe Nail Clipper. This beast is big, sharp, and sturdy. Toe nails don&#x27;t stand a chance. It&#x27;s almost too good. My toes are happy, my carpet is happy (no more little scraps everywhere), and I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> You know that piece you can usually flip out like a switch blade on many nail trimmers?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one doesnt have it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thats not to say they don&#x27;t do a great job cutting toe nails, but I do appreciate a multi tool in the bathroom and without that thing to, i dont know, gouge at my toes every once in awhile...I feel gyped.</li>
    <li> Tired of the performance of the more common, less expensive fingernail and toenail clippers, we decided to buy a serious, top of the line sort of product.  We bought both the fingernail and toenail clippers.  They are simply a great pleasure to use.  The cutting is easy, the amount of force needed to clip is so much less.  Ergonomically well designed, these clippers simply make it terribly unattractive to ever settle for anything less again.</li>
    <li> I love how smooth and sharp this cuts, but I&#x27;ve got some pretty large toe nails and this clipper doesn&#x27;t actually open up enough to cut some of them! :(  Also, I read in another review that it does not have the &amp;#34;snap&amp;#34; sound when clipping, but found that it made just as much noise as my other nail clippers.  Lastly, the very high angle of the handle makes it a bit cumbersome to use...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with this nail clipper. It cuts nails very easily without having to apply considerable preassure; its ergonomic design also helps too.  I&#x27;m also very pleased with the quality and workmanship of this nail clipper. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll have to buy a nail clipper for a couple of decades. I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Makes nice clean cuts, which means sharp edges at the top and bottom of the nail. Also, if used for fingers there isn&#x27;t a strong curve, so you have to make multiple cuts, risking having sharp points where two cuts meet. So you&#x27;ll want a file of some sort, which isn&#x27;t included in the clipper. Also not included is anything to catch the clippings.</li>
    <li> Yes, I&#x27;ve owned Tweezerman toenail clippers, and YES, these are better. There are a few reasons WHY these are better, they are sharper for one, also they have a built in grip. It makes it easier to cut your toe nails. Seriously high quality nail clippers.</li>
    <li> Easily cuts toe nails and cleanly too. Well made, easy to grip and is by far the best toe nail clipper I have used.</li>
    <li> Because I lost my original 777 toe nail clipper, I tried this item. It is okie with its price. The blades are sharp and easy to use. However, it does not incorporate the nail pick or nail file. I am a little disappointed about the missing functions.</li>
    <li> This nail clipper puts the fun back into cutting nails.  The product is excellent.  I also bought the fingernail clipper.  Both are excellent.</li>
    <li> The description seems to suggest that this clipper works well, as does a YouTube video, however, I have used it many times and the clipper slips out of my finger&#x27;s grasp.  I prefer the Revlon clipper sold in most drugstores.</li>
    <li> It may be the best cutter on the market, but it has a fatal flaw as far as I am concerned.&lt;br /&gt;There is no grip for your thumb! It slides right off the polished metal! I can&#x27;t believe that the manufacturer tried these out and said &#x27;well, good enough;, because they aren&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Best I have owned. Stayed sharp and working for several years and lost them so ordering again</li>
    <li> Sharpest clippers I have ever used.</li>
    <li> The cutting edges are two close together for my toenails. I use it for my fingers.I don&#x27;t like the minimum number of words I need to type. I have arthritis in my hands.</li>
    <li> These clippers seem to be built strong and have a good design.  They handle well and the edges seem to cut very well.  I think the main thing I like about them is that they cut well without applying very much pressure. I would say the same thing about the fingernail clippers.  I bought both.</li>
    <li> Made very well but not what i was used too. Too small and not curved enough. I had to make multiple cuts and then file to eliminate all the rought places. They are so well made, just did not work for me.</li>
    <li> Cuts well, looks awesome, no toenail cleaner.  for this price, it should have a cleaner or at least a pic.</li>
    <li> This is amazing that nail clipper the best that I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Nice feel in the hand,cuts great. I wish it provided a metal nail file.</li>
    <li> these make clipping a dream...</li>
    <li> It works better than all the clippers sold at convenient stores. However, the nail clipper is quite large.</li>
    <li> Like many other elderly, my toenails, especially on the big toes, are thick and curl under at the edge. This clipper was of no help at all and could not get under the nail edge. I got better results out of &amp;#34;nippers,&amp;#34; which look like small wire cutters. It may be that at this age one needs to get professional pedicures. That will be be embarrassing.</li>
    <li> Feel sturdy, heavy duty-well made. Clipper only- no file/pick. Trims well.</li>
    <li> I did not find this toe-nail clipper to be any better on my tough nails than the less expensive ones.</li>
    <li> clippers are well made and easy to use. This is my first pair of clippers at this price and they are well worth it.</li>
    <li> The reviews are spot on.  This is the best clipper I have ever used.  It is super sharp and works perfectly for me.</li>
    <li> We were getting frustrated at trying to find a quality nail clipper. This is a high quality tool. Easy to use. Sturdy. Fits well in your hand when you are using it. Stable.</li>
    <li> These are absolutely the best quality clippers that I have ever owned. The steel-on-steel sound as you slide the handle into place is the first difference you will sense before the clippers even touch your toe nail. Unlike cheap drug store clippers, these do not noticeably flex as you start to cut. For less that $16, these are a bargain.</li>
    <li> From years of running, my toe nails have become quite thick and ingrown. Needless, to say trimming these guys is not something I relish. It&#x27;s still not something I look forward to, but the Seki Toe Nail Clipper has made the job immeasurably more comfortable. I think its because the longer handles give a decided mechanical advantage and the cutting edges seem especially sharp.</li>
    <li> These clippers are just okay. They are not super sharp, they are not particularly well designed, they work pretty much the same as regular drug store clippers. They are a lot more expensive though. My advice? Save your money.</li>
    <li> great quality very sharp</li>
    <li> H-U-G-E.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, the blade is very sharp, as many other reviewers have stated. But the size of this and the insufficient curve of the blade don&#x27;t seem to be useful to me and my &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; (shoe size 9.5) feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a zookeeper, these may have utility. One of the few (only?) purchases from Amazon that will just go into the trash. Much better to stick with the more homo-sapien-appropriate Revlon or other common brand, that is also much less expensive.</li>
    <li> Definitely the best out there.  Even my husband who never cared about which nail clipper he cut his nails reacted by saying, &amp;#34;Wow, this cuts very well.&amp;#34;  He only looks for this to cut his nails now.  You will know the difference once you use it.</li>
    <li> Blades are sharp and cuts cleanly.</li>
    <li> A powerful, sturdy clipper, but still not powerful enough for our toenails.  Works great on fingernails.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy I finally pulled the trigger and bought these.  Worth every penny I paid for this and the regular clippers.</li>
    <li> I never thought I&#x27;d be writing a review for a toenail clipper but this little ruby deserves a good word.  They are the best clippers I&#x27;ve ever used...smooth and percise.</li>
    <li> I bought these because I already have the nail clippers. Seki has the best adult nail clippers I have ever found! I will never go back to the cheap crappy ones you buy at Wal-Mart, Sally&#x27;s, etc.</li>
    <li> They were expensive, but they are worth it. They have a nice finish that will not chip. Very sharp, cut effortlessly.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it is advertised to do.  Very pleased with the quality and the ease of use.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this to anyone with tough or hard to trim toe nails.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with purchase.</li>
    <li> Great &amp; sharp product.  Not the first one of these I&#x27;ve purchased for someone else--we already have many of these floating around our house!  The Japanese engineered blade is great quality.</li>
    <li> This one for people with devil type of toe nail go for it</li>
    <li> All the nail clipper you will ever need.  Feels comfortable and effortless after break-in period of a couple of trimmings.</li>
    <li> I love the clippers!  I have owned clippers from this company before and purchased sets for my family as gifts. They last for years with regular use on tough nails.  The problem is that I received a used set and that is disgusting!  I am a regular shopper on this site and place multiple orders per week for all of my retail needs.  I will reconsider purchasing cosmetic items from amazon after today.  I did receive a prompt refund and customer service was sympathetic to my complaints.  I am super freaked out that a pair of nail clippers that have a torn package and yucky stuff (complete with a fuzz or hair) on the clipping blade made it past returns and to my home.  This gross oversight is in no way a reflection of the product or it&#x27;s ability to do a good job so I did not lower my 4 star rating for the product but I will be purchasing the replacement locally.</li>
    <li> All i can say about this is that it is very sharp.  It barely opens far enough to trim fingernails, but NOT toenails.  My $2.00 \\&quot;Trim\\&quot; clipper does a much better job.</li>
    <li> This is a top-quality, precision manufactured product.  The leverage of the longer handle makes trimming your nails a snap.  And the cut is as sharp and clean as a medical instrument.  Seki should be very proud of their toe nail (and fingernail!) clippers.  Both are a good example of the quality, carefully made products we remember from our youth.  Worth double the cost!</li>
    <li> Granted, I haven&#x27;t tried anything but the &amp;#60;$4 clippers you get at the drug store.  These are so much better than those.  There may be better ones out there, but I don&#x27;t need them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sliced through my (fairly thick) toenails like butter.  No pulling to get the part you clipped off, or squeezing hard.  They just work.</li>
    <li> Bought this clipper because my nails are so thick and hard I was cutting them with a dremel. This is the first clipper I&#x27;ve found that actually cut the nails, not crushed them and sent shrapnel flying. I&#x27;ve had these for 4 years now, and they are still cutting like the day I bought them. Yes they are expensive, but they are worth the price because they stand the test of time.</li>
    <li> Best pair of nail clippers we ever bought</li>
    <li> It is quite refreshing to have a cheap mass-produced product that actually works. Oh, it is made in Japan... That must be why.</li>
    <li> Smooth and strong. Excellent quality!</li>
    <li> These did not open any wider than the one I bought at dollar tree. I am returning it. Have about given up, this is my third try.</li>
    <li> I got these and tried to use them the next day and before I could cut one nail they flew apart!  Worst product in the world!!!  Wish I&#x27;d known this before I purchased them!!!</li>
    <li> This is a nice high quality clipper, no comarision to the clippers you get at walmart.</li>
    <li> These clippers cut through the nail with the ease of sharp scissors through note-book paper. They are head and shoulders above drug-store purchased clippers.</li>
    <li> If you appreciate fine tools, buy this. And throw all your other clippers away.</li>
    <li> Worth the price...Cuts like nothing else</li>
    <li> These are absolutely awesome - very sturdy and do a nice, quick job.</li>
    <li> well made and very sharp. I do wish the opening was just a tad wider as it sometimes is a little difficult getting the nail in there with out clipping your skin if your not careful. it is a quality nail clipper so am happy overall with it.</li>
    <li> I was looking on Amazon for a good quality set of nail clippers and I ran across this brand. After taking the chance I can tell you that the reviews giving it the good rating are indeed true. It has a smooth action and is able to cut cleanly on the first pass with little leverage.</li>
    <li> simply the best. like a surgical instrument.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm! It is a very sturdy instrument. I&#x27;m very glad I made the purchase. Go for it!</li>
    <li> Based on all the great reviews, I thought this was a no brainer decision, but I found my nails are too thick to easily insert into the clipper.</li>
    <li> Update: November 11, 2015 Still sharp as ever with regular use! My 5-star rating stands.   Original Review: June 23, 2014 Is it weird to love a pair of nail clippers? Because I do. I love these so, so much.  These Seki&#x27;s are sharp. I mean, really sharp. And they stay sharp. They&#x27;re hefty (you can tell the material is quality), and I&#x27;ve seen zero flaking of any metal coatings or overlays. I&#x27;m quite happy with this purchase, and will purchase additional styles for my future clipping needs.</li>
    <li> Very sharp.  Works well.</li>
    <li> If you would have asked me if I would ever be writing a review on nail clippers in my future I would have thought you were nuts.  But, alas, here I am!  I am doing so because I am compelled to express how great these are!  They cut through my toe nails with ease.  They even can bang through my husband&#x27;s ham hock toe nails!  Magic!  Seriously, though, the Seki brand nail trimmers are more expensive then your everyday clippers but, trust me, they are worth it!  You get what you pay for and in this case you are paying for quality and construction - both which are top notch!</li>
    <li> This clipper is very nice. Feels good in the hand, and sharp. You can&#x27;t find this quality in the local drug store.</li>
    <li> Works well, cuts cleanly and effectively but would certainly recommend buying the ingrowing toe nail version if you have that issue</li>
    <li> whoa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my toenails. they look like S#*T!!!!!!!!! i&#x27;m a girl but i&#x27;ve got the toenails of a 55 yr old, unkempt, software engineer and bachelor who still lives in his mom&#x27;s basement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i need help. serious help. i&#x27;ve gone through several toenail clippers with no luck. some had terrible grips, some had crappy clipping blades, others rusted out before i could even use them a few times. out of sheer desperation, i turned to amazon. could there be a toenail clipper that could survive the bimonthly clips on my ragged feet???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the answer was simply: yes. these toenail clippers, made in Japan (not garbage China) are just what the pedicurist ordered. i don&#x27;t know what kind of amazing Japanese engineering went into these bad boys, but they make clipping my thick-as-kaka toenails as smooth as butter. i&#x27;m serious. it doesn&#x27;t take ANY effort to grasp the clippers, squeeze, and BOOM: a 5 inch chunk of yellowed out toenail comes flying off my feet. normally with cheaper toenail clippers, i&#x27;d have to squeeze with the strength of 6 bodybuilders to get enough force to apply the clippers. not these puppies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t go cheap. i can&#x27;t repeat this enough times. do not go cheap. you get what you pay for and these suckers will last you forever. i actually look forward to clipping my nails these days because of these clippers. i know what is going to go into everyone&#x27;s stockings this christmas!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;buy this clipper. the person you sleep with at night will thank you.</li>
    <li> Easiest clipper to use for arthritic hands.  Blade are sharp and make a clean cut.  I just wish it had a design to prevent clippings from flying everywhere.  But it&#x27;s so easy to use that I will work around that problem.</li>
    <li> This is truly the Cadillac of nail clippers. I know have the toe, fingernail and infant clippers from Seki Edge.</li>
    <li> Man, these are really sharp and very hefty feel.  The stand out after all the drug store cheapos.</li>
    <li> Having been using cheap clippers all the time, I am quite surprised by the quality of this. It&#x27;s sharp and takes so little effort to do the job. The experience of clipping nails is so good with these clippers that I apparently do this more frequently ( :</li>
    <li> Excellent clippers.  Leave a nice cut, no tearing of nails.  Cut straight through my thick man toe nails.  Great value.  Have had for a few months now -- still super sharp!</li>
    <li> these clippers are great I&#x27;ve never seen one as sharp and accurate.</li>
    <li> Best clipper I have ever had.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had a pleasant nail cutting experience before, but that&#x27;s likely due to my toe nails being as thick and rough as a German Shepard&#x27;s (despite how many peticures my wife sends me to).  The clippers always required considerable effort to cut through my nails, and left them with a rough edge.  These cut though my nails easier than a hot knife though butter.  I&#x27;ve never imagined that I could enjoy such a mundane task as trimming my nails, but that&#x27;s all changed now.  For any of you with nails like mine, I highly recommend them.  Well worth the $15 I spent.</li>
    <li> Worth every penny. These are the only clippers I buy now. So much nicer than anything I have ever used before. Got the whole family hooked on them!</li>
    <li> These are so nice, build quality feels great and they are super sharp. My nails are perfectly cut, hahahaha. I recommend!</li>
    <li> Super sharp and comfortable but not sure worth the price.  I not only use these on myself but to clip my pets nails too.  Extra sharp keeps pets nails from splintering leaving clean smooth cuts.</li>
    <li> Sharp, precision blades cut clean through the nail without any breakage. The material and design are both excellent. A bit large, however, even for a guy with big feet and hands like me. The large cutting surface makes it a bit awkward for digging into ingrown nails but the sharp precision blades more than make up for it&#x27;s hefty size. I don&#x27;t regret buying these and will keep using them but they&#x27;d be perfect if they were a bit smaller.</li>
    <li> Only complaint is that the Seki clippers are wider than standard ones and are tough to slip into your personal grooming kit slots.  Otherwise these are built to last and sharp with plenty of leverage to clip clean.</li>
    <li> Best, and sharpest, toe nail clippers I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
    <li> I like these, but they may be more suitable as finger nail clippers.</li>
    <li> really good and strong&lt;br /&gt;i am not a big nail clipper guy, always used to buy from the 99 cent store, but this is different.  worth the high price</li>
    <li> I purchased this immediately after loving the finger nail clippers, but I&#x27;m not as fond of this toe nail set.  I felt the shape of it kind of gets in the way when cutting toe nails and it would be nice to include a file in this larger set.  Overall the cut is very good but would give it a 5 if the above could be addressed.</li>
    <li> Really love this purchase. Bought them after finding the Seki Edge fingernail clippers a bit diminutive in my hands. These are larger, easier to control, and my new favorite for fingers or toes.</li>
    <li> I thought that these nail clippers were the shit when I first saw them, but now that I own them, they are the best thing in my life.</li>
    <li> My eyes are bad and reach is short so it made me a bit nervous to try super sharp clippers when it is such a struggle to clip my toenails. However, I had no problem and even felt less likely to cut myself than with my other clippers. The clippers are very steady with no twisting or slipping.  Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Excellent nail clippers.</li>
    <li> The only reason I bought this, is because of the glowing reviews - it&#x27;s not that I needed a better clipper.  But, the reviewers were right.  I found that the Seki Edge does make a very smooth cutting edge on the fingernails and toenails.  It is a surprising difference in the cutting experience.  I definitely like this cutter much better than any other I&#x27;ve used.  It will take a few more cuts, but this does a great job on fingernails, too.</li>
    <li> This nail clipper will cut through your thickest eagle-like toe nails. It is well design and cuts effortlessly. It is made of Japanese stainless steel.</li>
    <li> These clippers are expensive but they work great. I&#x27;ve never used a pair this good in my live. I can feel the quality every time I touch them. If you&#x27;re willing to pay a high price, I don&#x27;t think you can do batter than this.</li>
    <li> These are outstanding nail clippers.  Having tough fingernails along with tough toenails I&#x27;ve always used toenail clippers on both.  My old clippers seemed dull so I researched Amazon and saw the great reviews for this product.  Sounded a little expensive but I gave it a try.  I couldn&#x27;t have been more pleased.  Both my wife and I think they work great.  Only one problem, my daughter tried them and than I had to order another pair for her. :)</li>
    <li> This is the best you can get. It&#x27;s been a year since I got it and it&#x27;s still going strong. I use it for both my fingers and toes.</li>
    <li> The best toe nail clipper out there.Very easy to use with a great design.</li>
    <li> What can I say other than the Seki Edge toe nail clipper is superior to any other clipper I have ever used in my lifetime, regardless of price.  If you can spare a few extra bucks for perfection in a product, then go for anything made by Seki. You will not be disappointed, plus Amazon has it to your door very quickly.</li>
    <li> Great Googly Moogly, these are the sharpest, best made clippers I have ever found. Better than German made clippers that cost 2 times as much. They actually cut the nail as opposed to splitting them. The key difference from all the others I have tried, is the precision ground edges. Just a well made product that simple does a great job. Doesn&#x27;t sound like a big deal, until you start to thing of all things that are not well made anymore. Bravo Seki, Bravo!</li>
    <li> A dirty little secret stains the neat homes that lurk behind the tree-lined streets and across the manicured lawns of suburbia: those little nail clippers you picked up at the Walgreens for $3.99 will never cut through a man&#x27;s gnarled, oaken toe nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;ll make little cuts in it, they&#x27;ll promise and fail to deliver, they&#x27;ll even break apart in ashen resignation to the formidable power of the nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those cheap little metal gizmos were made to sell on promise alone. You need a nail clipper that was not designed by the bean counters and the marketing wizards, but by the car guys ... I mean ... the toenail engineers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That would be the Seki Edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not humungous. It&#x27;s just made out of the kind of components and with the kind of leverage that can actually do the job on those ghastly chunks of horn that adorn our toes under the ironed dress socks and shined-up wing tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t need to tell anyone about this. In fact, you&#x27;d best not. Just buy the Seki already. The rest can remain a secret.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to complement the [[ASIN:B000F35R00 Seki Edge Stainless Steel Fingernail Clipper]].  I probably could have just used the finger nail clipper to clip my toe nails but I like the idea of having a wider blade with larger radius specially made for toe nails.  These make nice gifts for family and friends as they will be pleasantly surprised by the build quality, design, and sharp blades.    Some of my thoughts:  - Cost: Yes initially they are more expensive than the cheaper ones but after having used them for over 6 months, it looks like it will last longer.  However, these are not to the point of out-of-reach high luxury items with gold plating and studded with diamonds.  They are probably more expensive because of quality build, carefully thought out design, and the use of good materials and processes.  I also contacted Seki Edge through e-mail and confirmed that they are made in Japan which also probably contributes to the higher price.  - Features: It would have been nice if these nail clippers came with a file.  The cheaper ones I&#x27;ve seen have this feature and can be pretty handy to help smooth out the nail after cutting.  However, if you are mainly using it for manicure or pedicure purposes at home, then you can always buy a separate file for the job.  Also note that in addition to not having a file it also does not have a finger/toe jam picker.  Hey it sounds nasty but this is all part of the cleaning process!  But it&#x27;s okay because if I see jam, I&#x27;d rather just cut my nails short and give them a good washing.  - White Sticker: The white rectangular shaped sticker with \\&quot;Seki Edge\\&quot; logo in red and black looks like it might come off over time.  I wish they instead engraved or stamped their name or even kept it off entirely.  This of course is not a big issue but my first impression was that this sticker somewhat cheapened the look.  - Size: Another first impression was that these clippers are not small or travel sized (especially this toe nailclipper version).  If I had to choose I would take the finger nail clipper to my travels and leave the toe nail clipper at home.  Possibly the ergonomic design and leverage needed to cut with ease contributes to a slightly bulkier product design compared to the cheaper ones.  Despite this bulkiness, I can see this clipper being ergonomically friendly for those with large or small hands.  - Quality: The build quality is like a tank and yet it feels nice to hold in the hand.  Also when you open and twist the handles, it flows smoothly and it does not feel like it will fall off or disconnect like the cheaper ones often do.  I notice a hint of metal to metal sound when turning the handles, which probably will produce scratch marks over time, but this is not such a big issue to me.  I am not sure what the two slots on the edge of the handle are for but I assume that it is for style and to help lighten the weight.  I also appreciate the stainless steel material.  The brushed stainless steel found on the body and the smooth sandblasted surface look on the handle is nicer than the chrome plated or \\&quot;gold\\&quot; plated shiny ones typically found elsewhere.  The angles and curvatures throughout the design also contribute to a nice looking clipper.  The blades are what really set itself apart from the competition.  You can really feel that the perfectly aligned sharp blades actually grip your nails before proceeding to clip off the nail crisply and assuredly.  I wonder though how long the blades will last over time.  Thankfully I understand that this is twice tempered steel and that it can be sharpened.  As with any tool you need to get used to it.  I recommend cutting a little less nail in the beginning until you get the hang of it (no pun intended).  For me I got a little carried away in the beginning and I cut off too much nail.  After a day of handling items, opening doors, and typing on the computer, I noticed my nail was slightly separated from the finger on the very tip causing it to be sore (sorry for those who are squeamish).  Anyway, there is also sometimes a clicking noise after immediately following each nail clip depending on the amount of force you give.  This sound assures you that the clipper did its job and is ready for the next \\&quot;bite\\&quot;.    Overall I found these two tools to be a nice and helpful addition to my everyday life.  The fact that I know that I do not have to struggle with low quality clippers (easily dull and misaligned blades and small design that is hard to hold and slips when given too much pressure) when clipping my nails gives me peace of mind.  For a few bucks more, I consider this to be a significant upgrade.  If it were up to me, I would rate these 4.5 stars out of 5 because it is not absolutely perfect but close to it.  However I will give these 5 stars since this is the best nail clipper I have ever experienced.    As a side note I feel like these nail clippers give the similar unexplainable good feeling that is produced by Felco Classic Pruners [[ASIN:B00023RYS6 Felco Classic Manual Hand Pruner #F-2]] (for gardening purposes which I highly recommend) when using it and yielding great results.  If you own one you know what I mean.</li>
    <li> A mighty expensive toenail clipper--but after the pain of an ingrown toenail I listened to my podiatrist, who recommended getting a good one. Well-constructed,it clips crisply and neatly--clearly superior to the $3 clunkers at the drugstore. It clips fingernails equally well,no need to buy a separate one for that purpose.</li>
    <li> This is the best pair of nail clippers I have ever owned.  They are a work of art to say the least.  You will not be disapointed, I look forward to clipping my nails now, they work for both finger and toe nails, bye the way.  I have to say that the mechanisms are perfect, nothing is loosely fitted here, perfection in engineering indeed.  I do not even want to use the cheaper regular made one&#x27;s anymore.</li>
    <li> I never thought I could really like a nail clippers! I thought they were all the same. Not so. This one is truly different and makes it much easier to use, especially with kids!</li>
    <li> These have a nice look and feel with the brushed aluminum and they clip unlike any clippers I&#x27;ve had before. There really is a difference. Clean cuts, effortless, no snagging or ripping. Nice.</li>
    <li> You may think that this clipper is too expensive when you can get clippers for only a couple of dollars, but this is an example of &amp;#34;you get what you pay for.&amp;#34;  I have found that quality always pays in the long run.  This clipper operates smoothly and easily and it doesn&#x27;t tear up your nails.</li>
    <li> My husband requested this item.  Opened it last night and is very happy.  Loves the heft and&lt;br /&gt;solid feel.  easy to use</li>
    <li> The clipper is well made. The alignment is good and blades are sharp.  If you have tough nails, this would be a good choice.  If your nails are average, there is no reason to spend the extra money.  The slight extra force needed to operate a conventional set of clippers does not justify the extra price.</li>
    <li> This tool will last you forever.  Clean cuts the nail, sharp, and I love that it is stainless steel.  Ergonomically sound too!</li>
    <li> Hope she likes it as she asked for it.  Might buy one for myself if daughter says she likes it!</li>
    <li> Excellent clipper. Sharp and easy to hold. The samurai sword of toe nail clippers. Dull nail clippers fracture your nails.</li>
    <li> I HAVE &amp;#34; TOUGH, HARD &amp;#34; NAILS .THIS IS THE ONLY CLIPPER THAT I HAVE EVER USED THAT MAKE THE CLIPPING EASY !</li>
    <li> yep.  don&#x27;t lose it though.</li>
    <li> The best toe nail clippers by far.  Well constructed, designed and sharp.  While they are a bit pricey, the cost is well worth it given the overall top flight nature of the clippers.</li>
    <li> Seki Edge toe nail clippers took the chore out of cutting. Has a quality instrument feel and a durable finish. This product will&lt;br /&gt;not disappoint!</li>
    <li> These are really awesome clippers! No rough or torn edges when you clip your nails...great smooth finish and easy to handle.</li>
    <li> My dog has always been fascinated with my nail clipping sitting within inches intently watching every wonderful clip.  The Seki Edge has a different sound due to the plastic nail catcher.  My dog hates it.  I have lost my nail clipping buddy.  PS.  Great nail clipper.</li>
    <li> Only thing keeping it from a 5 star is that the straight blades take a little bit of maneuvering to cut curved nails.  Other than that, it is great.</li>
    <li> These nail clippers work really well. I already had the Seki Edge finger nail clippers, which I felt were worth the high price. So I got these and am just as happy with the toe nail clippers.</li>
    <li> Without doubt the best clipper I have ever owned. The larger size makes clipping easy. Very sharp!&lt;br /&gt;I have trouble with regular clippers because of hand pain. This takes that problem away.</li>
    <li> The product works as advertised, I have only had it for about 30 days so I have only used it maybe 3 times but the quality and feel seems to be first class.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier!  As the package says, &amp;#34;smooth and easy action.&amp;#34;  My toenails are extra-thick, and I&#x27;ve always had to soak my feet for half an hour or more to get my toenails soft enough to cut.  Not anymore!  Even my big toenails cut with this clipper with very little effort without having to soak them first.</li>
    <li> after searching the internet for the Best clippers. Amazon had the best prices and shipping . After using them , they were as suggested . very smooth cut and excellent quality.</li>
    <li> I bought both the SS-109 and SS-106 thinking I was getting a fingernail and toe nail clipper as described. Beware, SS-106 is not a toe nail clipper it&#x27;s a finger nail clipper.</li>
    <li> No more flying finger nails. These are so sharp that it doesntmsend them sailing all over the place. They are the best!</li>
    <li> Twice tempered, forged in the mountain mists of ancient Japan, my family passed it down from generation to generation, a Seki blade. With a barely noticeable flip of the wrist, my blade dispatches bone and sinew with the greatest of ease. However, I will readily admit that even my skill is not so great that I could replicate the same success when trimming my toes. And I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh how I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some may say its silly to spend money on a toe nail clipper when one only has one toe remaining, but the day I learned of the Seki Edge To Nail Clipper - forged in the same mountains as my sword, Uni - I did not hesitate. After all, does one need 10 toes to recognize true beauty, art, and crafstmanship? Who am I to begrudge the modern day samurai sword masters, who do to the march of time and rise of industry, must find new ways to put rice on the table? Must we all suffer the indignity of $1 clippers because we are too proud to see their true skills go to waste?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I say nay, we do not. So do yourself a favor and put down your $1 clipper and your 1,000 year old sword. Invest in a Seki.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your ancestors will smile from the heavens.</li>
    <li> the product  is actually a fingernail clipper.  it is a nice fingernail clipper, but we could get this item in our local store.</li>
    <li> The cutting edge of the Seki Edge easily cuts even the thickest of toenails. The clipper is well constructed and should last forever (it may well end up as a family heirloom). I did not give it 5 stars because it proved difficult to position on some nails which had significant curvature ... I have had the same problem with all other toe nail clippers I have tried.</li>
    <li> They need to design it so you can keep a better grip on it when using.&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to cut yourself.</li>
    <li> Bought the Seki and love it. Although I tend to prefer a straight blade, the Seki is nicely balanced, easy to use, and razor sharp.</li>
    <li> Who would have thought clippers could be made better. Well they can. A clean crisp cut from a very comfortable set of clippers. Seki makes a quality product. Time to throw away all the other clippers in the house.</li>
    <li> I was expecting a wider gap for cutting. Not different from any other clipper. I&#x27;ll just have to keep looking</li>
    <li> Expensive but very very sharp and works&lt;br /&gt;great. Gave one as a gift &amp; kept one. I love&lt;br /&gt;this product. Paid for itself since I don&#x27;t have&lt;br /&gt;to go out to get pedicure.</li>
    <li> Toenail clippers should be a \\&quot;straight across\\&quot; or \\&quot;reverse curve\\&quot; blade design when used for people toes, or you risk getting ingrown toenails. The curve of this blade is completely wrong for people toes, but it works beautifully for trimming pet claws. The handle and lever are long enough for a good grip, the curve at the end of the lever fits the fingers correctly, and the blades are very sharp and cut claws cleanly and easily. I never use it on myself, but my cat seems to be much less annoyed by this clipper than by other versions.</li>
    <li> The glowing reviews are what sold me on this, but it works a little less well than whatever no-brand clippers I&#x27;ve been using for years. They are a bit harder to grip and the top lever is a bit too short, so they tend to slip out of my hands. The front cutting edges dont seem to line up perfectly though which may be why some attempted cuts tear a bit, I dont know if this is the design or I was sold one with a defect but either way I feel like I wasted twenty bucks.</li>
    <li> strong, well built, very sharp</li>
    <li> Finally a nail clipper that clips nails.  After buying that last &amp;#34;clipper&amp;#34; at CVS (the most expensive one I could find) which *did not* clip nails, I knew I needed the big guns.  This is it.</li>
    <li> This thing is just amazing.  You know those nail clippers that you can slide along your nails and clip without making huge *CLICK* noises?  Yeah this is one of them.  It makes a low *thud* noise instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buuut, the one thing it&#x27;s missing is the fold-out undernail cleaner/file; that thing that looks like a blade with a rough texture on it.  That thing is a must when cleaning out toenails after you&#x27;ve cut them!</li>
    <li> Best clipper I&#x27;ve ever owned!  Effortless cutting results in a perfect cut every time.  Great product that I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Works just like I had heard. Would recommend to all. Lot better than the cheap ones in the stores. Heavy duty.</li>
    <li> Best nail clippers ever.</li>
    <li> This clipper really does the job!  After years of drugstore varieties, I&#x27;m wondering why I was so long discovering this!  And delivery was fast!</li>
    <li> Fail, fail for me. I had chemotherapy, and one of the side effects was that my toenails broke in half, so when the new nail beds grew in, I had double thickness toenails on the top half of my toes. I tried using my toenail clippers I had at home, but they did not work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, these toenail clippers were also too small. They were fine for my little toe, but that is not acceptable. I do take full responsibility for ordering these clippers without checking every review. I have gone back to the drawing board, and I have ordered a different type of nail clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not Recommended For Me. prisrob 07-19-15</li>
    <li> yES A LITTLE EXPENSIVE BUT DOES A GREAT JOB ON NAILS,  hAVING IN THE PAST BROKEN BOTH TOES AND MY NAILS THERE BEING THICKER THIS IS HARD T USE AS DOES NOT OPEN WIDE ENOUGHT, BUT IT IS GOOD FOR THE OTHERS,</li>
    <li> I love these clippers.  They leave a really nice, clean cut.  My cheap clippers leave a ragged edge.  They are worth the money!</li>
    <li> Benefits of these nail clippers include:&lt;br /&gt;1. Cut fingernails don&#x27;t go flying everywhere&lt;br /&gt;2. Sharp enough that fingernails don&#x27;t break/chip mid-cut&lt;br /&gt;3. Comfortable to hold&lt;br /&gt;4.  Larger size makes cutting toenails easier&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, this really made the fingernail cutting experience much more enjoyable.</li>
    <li> Works great! I wish that I had been using something like this all of my life.</li>
    <li> GOOD QUALITY AND PRICE.  I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BRAND</li>
    <li> I have very thick nails, and after buying all kinds of cheap nail clippers, I came across Seki. I&#x27;m NEVER going back.</li>
    <li> Generally I like this nail clipper.  It cuts nicely.  But the one negative, is that it is slippery in your hand.  So it is sometimes hard to control it as precisely as you might like.  I wish they would put a rough, non-skid surface on the part that you hold in your hand.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t split, chip, or crush the nail.  Cuts it off very neatly.  Just be careful.  These things are SHARP!  Best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
    <li> I love the quality of this clipper. It cuts cleanly instead of tearing the nail--as the cheaper clippers do these days (they didn&#x27;t used to...). But I wouldn&#x27;t call it a toenail clipper. The edge is somewhere between that of a fingernail clipper and a toenail clipper, definitely smaller than what I&#x27;m used to.</li>
    <li> The clipper work fine and makes clean cuts.  I like the way it fits into my hand and is easy to control.  Shipping was terrible - took 9 days.</li>
    <li> These cost more than many other, similar-looking clippers.  But you get what you pay for.  These are well-made, substantial, and very sharp.</li>
    <li> Would be nice if it would open a bit wider for really thick toenails. (Being solid stainless, can grind the tips a bit shorter to achieve a wider opening.)</li>
    <li> This is the very best nail clipper I have ever seen or used. Its very well made and clips your nails with ease</li>
    <li> First I had my doubts about benefit of pricey nail clippers, since I&#x27;ve always used cheapo ones from the Dollar store. But one drunk day I decided to just try it out, since it is pricey and looks fancy, but not so much that it&#x27;s out of financial reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is it. You&#x27;ll never need any other nail clipper ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s thick so it&#x27;s easy to handle, and more importantly, it cuts cleanly through the thickest nails without a fuss. No jagged multi-layer big toe nails to trim when you use these clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had mine since 2009, and it&#x27;s just as sharp and easy to use as ever. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if this last as long as my cast iron pans. If it ever breaks, I&#x27;d order another one for sure.</li>
    <li> way to keep your toenails in good shape for long days on the trail. It&#x27;s compact enough to take along &#x27;just in case&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the ginsu knife of nail clippers.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best nail clippers I have ever used!</li>
    <li> Pricey, but excellent.  This is the only clipper you wI&#x27;ll ever need. The quality is exceptional.</li>
    <li> This is hands down the best nail clipper I have ever used PERIOD!! I have thick toe nails which other regular cheap clippers just couldn&#x27;t make the cut (no pun intended). I have cut my toe nails pretty deep for ingrown nails with ease and no pain compared to store bought ones which require some strength and pain just to clip them off. Seriously I&#x27;am considering buying one for my dad since he has thick toe nails. Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> This Seki Edge Toe Nail Clipper has been in use for many months now and has lost none of its clipping capabilities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That edge is sharp!  It continues to clip clean edges after many months!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We rate it one star from optimum only because it is slippery to hold.  It looks great but it really would benefit from a finish that would not slip so much when one is trying to hold on to it.  Darn, but that is annoying!</li>
    <li> I never really gave much thought to quality for something like a nail clipper before owning these, but I can&#x27;t go back to anything less than a Seki after owning this product.  The blades are very sharp and perfectly aligned for good cuts without ragged edges or flying shrapnel.</li>
    <li> Good delivery time. Item came as describe.</li>
    <li> Highly recommended. Wish I bought these a long time ago. The increased leverage makes even the thick toenails easy to cut. A very high quality tool. Treat yo self.</li>
    <li> It is as they say it is in the other reviews -- I refer to those who extol its sharpness and ability to cut with little effort. Also, they are correct that the gap could be wider to insert the toenail, but I manage with a little extra effort, and I&#x27;d still purchase it again. Also, it&#x27;s easier to use on fingernails too!</li>
    <li> Best clippers on the market!</li>
    <li> Love this nail clipper.  It has remained sharp through multiple uses, it&#x27;s sturdy in the hand and allows for precise clipping.  I&#x27;m very happy with it - definitely superior to the &amp;#34;drug store&amp;#34; brands of clippers that I&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>
    <li> This is the best nail clipper I have ever tried.</li>
    <li> This clipper is easy to use and sharp.  The older one gets, the farther away the toes seem--trimming is easy with this clipper.</li>
    <li> Works great to cut very tough toenails. Feels good in the hand. Very sturdy-feeling, too.</li>
    <li> Sharp, great clippers</li>
    <li> Excellent quality and soft mechanism. I like it very much, thank you!</li>
    <li> IT WORKS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; After trying several clippers, nippers, cutters purchased locally, we were still struggling with toenails. I&#x27;m old enough and arthritic enough that my wife has to cut my toenails. I hated it because she struggled to squeeze the locally-purchased tools hard enough to cut through my (seemingly normal) nails, and a couple of slips had me pleading for mercy and a Kleenex to staunch the red flow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the Seki Edge clippers with only mild expectations. My expectations were far exceeded. A job both I and my wife hated is now tolerated by both. I wish I could magically command the cuticles to stop growing, but since they continue to grow, I&#x27;m glad I bought the Seki Edge clipper.</li>
    <li> They are absolutely worthless. They will not cot my toenails no matter how I try. I have to file my nails as best I can.</li>
    <li> Sharp and clean cuts. I only wish they had a pointed nail file attached as many toenail clippers do.</li>
    <li> Excellent, quick and sharp cut. Would prefer for it to include a nail file attachment.</li>
    <li> It is hard to get excited about something as mundane as a toenail clipper, but I believe in giving credit where credit is due.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t see how a tool that is made for this purpose could be any better than this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s face it: clipping your (toe)nails is one of those jobs that are really a &amp;#34;chore&amp;#34; and something most people hate.&lt;br /&gt;But, unless you can afford to go get a pedicure every time you need to get them cut it is something we just have to deal with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So then it surely does help to have the right tool for the job.&lt;br /&gt;And this one sure makes it a lot easier and faster.&lt;br /&gt;Of course there will always be some people who will say: &amp;#34;oh but this one (...) is soo much better!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Well, good luck to them, but this one is perfect for me and worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;Works great on finger nails too, of course.&lt;br /&gt;Watch out though: this thing is SHARP!!</li>
    <li> I never thought I would review a toe nail clipper but I have to in this case. This product is amazing. No chipping of the nail, clean cuts, and great leverage. It is amazingly good. I used to just replace my clippers by going to a local pharmacy but not any more. It is much pricier than your average nail clipper but the quality is absolutely worth it for me.</li>
    <li> Does the job easily and safely.  Does not. Jam or clog and stays open, does not stick or jam. Recommend.</li>
    <li> I use clippers a lot to reduce the rate of hole formation in neoprene socks (worn frequently). Precise, effortless clips - can&#x27;t ask for more. Worth the price if you value clipper performance.</li>
    <li> At the first use I noticed that this toenail clipper is sharper by far than any I have ever encountered. This factor greatly reduces the effort needed to clip thick nails. More expensive than others but worth it.</li>
    <li> This pedicure implement is one serious tool! I bought the Seki Toe Nail Clipper for a male friend who had let his toe nails grow wild (you should see the holes in the toe area of his socks)because every time he attempted to trim them, the nail clipper he had would give out. I waited quite a while for this because it was back ordered. Let me tell you, it was well worth it. WOW!!!! With the least amount of effort this clipper cut the toughest, thickest toenails. Now my friend&#x27;s feet look human again. He has tried MANY clippers and he cannot believe how well the Seki Edge clippers work. Forget those cheap drug store clippers, these Seki Edge Toe Nail clippers are worth every penny and then some. They are well made, extremely sharp and constructed from heavy duty stainless steel. You will get many years of good usage. If your toe nails seem impervious to trimming, you will find your prayers answered with the Seki Edge Toe Nail Clipper! Your socks will breathe a sigh of relief and thank you!</li>
    <li> In the past, I have dealt with clippers shredding the tips of my nails and turning themselves practically out of my fingers when I tried to use them. That didn&#x27;t happen with these. I have spent more on bad clippers in the past year than these cost. I am very pleased and I think that anyone who buys these will be pleased as well. However, a word of caution... You can easily cut the skin if you try to cut your nails too short.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s super sharp and works really great. I was disappointed to find out that it doesn&#x27;t have nail file. Don&#x27;t understand why.</li>
    <li> Excellent, excellent product!  I purchased this for my Mom who absolutely loves it!  She said it&#x27;s the best clipper she&#x27;s ever used in her life.  It&#x27;s large and easy for her to handle.</li>
    <li> I was tired of my old clippers that barely cut and got the Seki hoping for a better tool.  It is strongly made and feels heavy in your hand compared to other brands.  It is very sharp.  Use with care.</li>
    <li> This is actually the second clippers I have bought because when I moved, somehow I lost/misplaced my first set.  These are easily the best clippers I have ever owned.  Super sharp (Japanese), these things clip right throw with minimal effort.  I love these so much that I make other people try them--is that gross--and most people are like, &amp;#34;they are clippers, what&#x27;s the big deal?&amp;#34;  Then after one &amp;#34;clip&amp;#34;, they all say, &amp;#34;Wow! These are amazing.&amp;#34;  I just sit back and smile because I know my job here is done.</li>
    <li> Cutting our toenails is something that can be a pain if you don&#x27;t have good tools to do the job. From the moment you feel these in your hand you know they are high quality. A bit more expensive than most but well worth it! You can feel the sharpness of the blades as soon as you cut your first toenail. You barely have to use any force to cut. They are Japanese made and have a nice polished stainless finish. Can&#x27;t imagine anyone ever going back to anything else after using these once. Perfection!</li>
    <li> Best clippers i have ever had, very good quality.&lt;br /&gt;Had a single clippermfor last 20years, realise they were only splitting the nail, not cutting&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend</li>
    <li> Affordable &amp; High quality</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:77b3455dfe601f323560d1a7bcddab8f]] Will never use another clipper again. These clippers are super sharp, so it makes clipping nails a breeze. Love that it has the clippings catcher unit around it as well - keeps them in there till I&#x27;m ready to dump out and they don&#x27;t end up all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would just get the toe nail clipper instead the smaller one (for hand nails). I&#x27;ve bought about 10 of these over the past two years and have been giving them as gifts (who doesn&#x27;t like a solid nail clipper?)</li>
    <li> Stop buying cheap clippers. My wife made fun of me when I actually took time to look for a good set of clippers. Now she steals these every time she needs clippers, when I cant find them, they are in her drawer! I use these for both toe and finger nail clippers and think they are the best! Sharp so you get a nice clean cut, no tearing etc.</li>
    <li> These clippers cut my nails satisfactorily for a few months.  However, after approximately four months, they dulled.  I was disappointed with that, due to the good reviews advocating this product.  I do not recommend these clippers at all.  They were quite sharp initially, but quickly dulled.  Now, I&#x27;ve had to buy a replacement for these.  I won&#x27;t bother trying to return these.  I will simply shy away from this Seki brand.</li>
    <li> These things are expensive, but the quality is outrageous! I bought a second one because I lost the first one. Found the &amp;#34;lost&amp;#34; one later, so now I have one in my travel bag.</li>
    <li> Love these things, cut even the thickest of nails with ease, made in Japan also so its not some cheap chinese junk. Not much to say about nail clippers other than they are perfect.</li>
    <li> This is the best nail clippers made, bar none.</li>
    <li> Awesome little tool for men&#x27;s grooming. Quality head-and-shoulders above what one gets with pharmacy sold clippers. Used it for a year now and it&#x27;s still very sharp and you get that crisp click sound when clipping the nail.&lt;br /&gt;While not as cheap as pharmacy or dept store sold clippers, this one is made to last.</li>
    <li> the best but don&#x27;t loose it</li>
    <li> I have this item and the Seki ingrown toenail clipper. The latter is my favorite - even though I don&#x27;t have any ingrown nails&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The slant edge is extremely ergonomic and makes it easy to see where I am cutting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sharp blades too.</li>
    <li> Have thick nails and they cut right through them. Great product. Would recommend to anyone. Somewhat expense but you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Everything went well, thanks</li>
    <li> These are very sharp and high quality.  They don&#x27;t stick when used and take little effort</li>
    <li> Good, good good product</li>
    <li> Look ok at first but seems to break nails more than cut them, leaving very sharp, jagged nails at the end.&lt;br /&gt;Would not recommend this cutter.</li>
    <li> Beautifully made and finished, but with a terrible design flaw.  The opening between blades is small.  They only work on thin and straight nails!  What&#x27;s even worse, when you rotate the handle into the clipping position, it narrows the opening even more!  How incredibly dumb to have such a beautiful product ruined by such a fundamental design flaw.  Unless you have perfectly thin and straight nails, seek another clipper with sufficient opening. Seki&#x27;s clippers for ingrown nails have a much larger opening.  I feel I paid top dollar for a basically unusable product.</li>
    <li> this nail klipper is the best one i have ever brought it is just great</li>
    <li> After years of using the couple bucks cheap-os from walmart etc. I splurged on these. They are absolutely AMAZING. Only downside I&#x27;ve noticed is you must be careful on placement. If you go to far in, by the time you notice it may be too late. They are quick, easy, and clean cutting.</li>
    <li> Maybe a 3.5 but no more. I read and re-read the reviews and I though this would be a wonderful Nail Clipper but the Seki Edge Toe Nail Clipper is just okey. Sometimes it is a pain and have to find other angles something I never dealt with much cheaper clippers. I will give it praise for the looks for it does command respect. For performance so so. 3.5 Stars.</li>
    <li> Personally I hate crappy nail clippers.  The things are rock solid, won&#x27;t rust and incredibly sharp!  The brands from Wal-Mart and drug stores tend to bend under pressure, not these.  I liked these so much I plan to give them as gifts in the future.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got thick toenails.  This cuts through them like butter.  Very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> This nail clipper has some teeth !  Easy to manage, and can deal with tough nails with minimal effort.  Just don&#x27;t lose it.</li>
    <li> Wow, the best clipper you will ever buy. Never knew they existed.</li>
    <li> Have tried all clippers made and there is no comparison as far as how they cut. Only problem is clipper opening is rather small. Other than that- they want be beat</li>
    <li> Well, when I say sharp, I mean SHARP!!!  It was my own fault and not that of these clippers, but the first time I used them I promptly nipped off the tip end of my right middle toe - the meat, not the nail. Hurt like the dickens and blood everywhere..... Then, I put my glasses on to finish the task at hand. (Or foot). These babies are sharp and they don&#x27;t take a lot of effort to clip a nail. Very well made too.</li>
    <li> Very sharp and well made. A bit small and curved for toenails.</li>
    <li> Luxury Class Toenail Clipper!  No kidding.  I&#x27;ve lived over 25 years in Asia and this is what the bath house ladies use to clip your nails and I&#x27;ve always admired the precision of their work.  True professionals!  The view isn&#x27;t bad either.</li>
    <li> So glad I found these. They are wonderful,can&#x27;t believe the difference.Everyone in my family is getting a set for Christmas</li>
    <li> i can&#x27;t even say how well it works because the edges don&#x27;t open wide enough to go over the nail (my nails are not that bad). that being said, the product is worthless for me.</li>
    <li> Read athese in a magazine review.  Great clippers with instructions on how to best cut your nails.  Will probably never need to buy another pair.  Cuts tough toenails with ease.</li>
    <li> Absolutely, perfect. The moment I got this nail clipper I knew it was destined to be. It cuts extremely well.</li>
    <li> Excellent Product and Delivery</li>
    <li> Absolutely and positively the best I have ever used.  Finely made and infinitely superior to what  is usually available..  Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Finally a clipper that has all the design that will cut my alligator toenails before the other half starts on me about it.&lt;br /&gt;Other clippers aren&#x27;t made right that I&#x27;ve had and trying to cut, the clipper slides off my thum. Not this clipper.&lt;br /&gt;It takes a lickin&#x27; and keeps on clippin&#x27;!</li>
    <li> These clippers are exactly what I wanted.  Stainless steel, designed for functionality and sharp.  These clippers are very sharp. The nail is actually cut with these, rather than smashed.  Superb.</li>
    <li> first time ever splurging on fingernail clippers.  Always just used cheap drugstore type.  Gotta say, I purchased these after I dropped my old ones off a 15 story balcony based on reviews..... and I am more than impressed with the quality and the ease with wich you are able to clip your nails.  My old clippers had to be a lot of pressure applied and always slipped around on my nail and in hands..... These sekis are almost effortless.  Highly recommended!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also purchased the  satin finger nail ones</li>
    <li> I recently bought the Seki Edge Finger Nail Clipper at a street fair at College of the Desert.  It works like none other.  The price is well worth it.  The store bought ones like Revlon, etc. slip out my hands, and are not very sharp.  I suppose one cannot expect much for $3.99.  The Nail Clipper feels like a quality well built tool.  It is made with real stainless steel, not dipped in some sort of chrome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just received the Seki Edge Toe Nail Clipper I&#x27;d ordered on Amazon two days ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only regret is that I did not know of or buy a Seki product until I reached my 62nd year.</li>
    <li> Does its job. Easy to handle. Seems to be the right size. We will have to wait and see on how long it holds it&#x27;s sharpness.</li>
    <li> The king of Nail Clippers</li>
    <li> I have been using this same pair of clippers since purchasing them right here on Amazon for the past 5 years.  They are built very solid, have a good feel in your hand, and stayed sharp all this time.  They are far above any clippers you would find at your local pharmacy store or big box store.  Short of losing them I would bet these could last a lifetime...</li>
    <li> These work really well.  They make an unpleasant task much easier!</li>
    <li> Want a pair of clippers that are sharp and cut your nails perfect?  Get these! I absolutely recommend this product.  We&#x27;ll worth the dollars.</li>
    <li> Cuts very quickly and very well but I had to stop using because it was causing ingrown toenails.  I had never had this problem in my life of 60 years.</li>
    <li> This was a great purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This industrial-strength clipper does its job very easily, and it looks like it will last a lifetime.</li>
    <li> It does not open near wide enough !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  And it would be nice if it collected the cut nails !</li>
    <li> EASY TO USE, VERY SHARP</li>
    <li> Came completely dull and unusable. Decided to try it in my tackle box since it wouldn&#x27;t cut nails and it wouldn&#x27;t even cut fishing line. Cheap. It&#x27;s now trash</li>
    <li> MY FIRSST PAIR LASTED ABOUT 15 YEARS BEFORE BEING STOLEN. VERY STRONG AND SHARP.</li>
    <li> They work very well. Only observation is the lower part if kind of bulky so it is harder to reach some areas. Then again, as sharp as this are, I would&#x27;ve lost a lot of blood if they where easier to maneuver.</li>
    <li> nice sharp high quality nail clipper.  used for fingernails and toenails without a problem.  heavy weight metal feels like it will last.</li>
    <li> Read most of the reviews beforehand to get an idea of why this was a little more expensive. I was use to the $1.99 clipper and it got the job done but i figured there was better out there.  I was impressed that this clipper was so sharp. It cut without any issues at all. The tool just feels heavy and built to last.</li>
    <li> The clippers were sent to the correct person but,  inside was a poorly written and grammatically incorrect  Happy Birthday message to someone I do not know. The person receiving the gift gave it to someone with the name mentioned in the note. Now they are out the product and I have purchased a product for a total stranger. Unforgivable! If I had wanted to include a note, which I did not, I would have at least used proper grammar. Someone is not paying attention to detail.</li>
    <li> Appears to be well made. It is sharp so that it takes minimal effort to cut through thick nails. I use on my finger nails as well but because they are toe nail size, it&#x27;s hard to get the shape you want without having to file the edges after.  I like that it doesn&#x27;t make my nails bend while cutting (I have thick nails) like other clippers that aren&#x27;t made as well.</li>
    <li> I have nerve damage in one hand and this clipper allows me to do both finger and toe nails. It is well made and durable.</li>
    <li> These were a replacement for an identical product with a different brand that I got more than 10 years ago from Brookstone. Eventually they got dull but they had lasted a long time and done very well. From the first few uses, these will be exactly the same.</li>
    <li> You don&#x27;t even have to wet your nails to cut them, although it is recommended to ensure smooth cut. Works as advertised.</li>
    <li> These clippers are sharp, effective and easy to use.  Much better than what I expected when I ordered them.  I would recommend them to anyone able to bend over or that has someone else to assist them.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a toe nail clipper and it works fine. I have bought the cheaper ones at the local outlets and some work but most are not very good. This costs a little more but it is as good as I have had.</li>
    <li> I use these for trimming my toe nails which are quite thick.  They work very well and most will find them very useful.</li>
    <li> I bought several toe nail clippers for the purpose of clipping my cats claws.  I got the Seki Edge, Tweezer Man and Mehaz.  I thought the Seki Edge worked the best out of the 3, because it made a really clean, smooth cut.  The Mehaz left a slight jagged edge (although I could live with it), but pressing down on the clipper to cut was really smooth and almost effortless.  I do not recommend the Tweezer Man; it left a jagged edge and wasn&#x27;t as easy to use.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed in this purchase. While they did not last, the cheap clippers I had before these worked better; apparently the opened further making it easier to clip my nails.</li>
    <li> good quality steel but not as good as the as seen on tv clippers the as seen on tv clippers have a wider mouth and better gripping quality is just as good as the seki ones don&#x27;t get me wrong these are nice clippers but there are better ones out there</li>
    <li> I use this clipper for both fingernails and toenails. I have size 13 (US) feet and so very large toes, and this works fine. It is a _little_ on the small side for cutting my big toe nail (too much curvature), and so I have to be a little careful when using it to clip my big toes. It works perfectly for fingernails and all other toenails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wash the clipper off with soap+water and it has not shown any signs of corrosion or wear yet after a few months of use.</li>
    <li> I have always had a problem keeping my nails trimmed as I hate the feeling of cheap clippers trying to force their way through my nails. I purchased the fingernail and toe nail clippers at the same time and it makes all the difference in the world. These cut cleanly through my nails with very little effort, they are very comfortable to hold and seem very solid. I had no idea that crappy clippers were the reason I hated cutting my nails, but now that problem has gone from my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for my toe nails, I have had several pairs of clippers break while trying to cut my thick nails. These will not have that problem. I barely have to use any pressure to cut right through them. It just amazes me what a difference a quality product can make&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be recommending these to everyone I know, and will be trying to convince everyone to trash their cheap clippers. If you are hesitating because of the price difference of these compared to your Wal-Mart/dollar store/pharmacy clippers, stop and remember: sometimes you get exactly what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Very well made and easy to use. Does not slip in your fingers as others do. A great nail clipper for the price. Only thing sometimes better is a profrssional pedi..5 stars...A+A+A+</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used cheap 1$ nail clippers, where it&#x27;s mostly force that cuts the nail. These clippers are high quality, sharp and effective. Not saying I won&#x27;t go back to 1$ clippers, however I don&#x27;t see these breaking for years.</li>
    <li> These are the best nail clippers I&#x27;ve ever used. Sharp, sturdy, and very easy to grip. They are worth every single penny.</li>
    <li> This item is well made and material has very good quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is the best nail clipper of this kind I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Quality materials.Quiet operation.Easy to cut nails.Much better than any other of this type I have used.Recommend that you give these a try.</li>
    <li> The only reason that I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that it doesn&#x27;t open as wide as I would like. No, my nails that thick, but I do use clippers for other things.</li>
    <li> Great clippers that are well made and minimize the amount of pain while cutting. Can also be used to cut finger nails. A nice tool!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my husband, who has very thick nails. It was a splurge, and I didn&#x27;t expect much. I was pleasantly surprised at the difference a well-made implement could make. The head is angled so that the lever is on the bottom, which makes it much easier to manipulate when dealing with &amp;#34;the feet.&amp;#34; I recommend this item very highly.</li>
    <li> Clearly better than your run of the mill product.  Nice, smooth action.  I think it&#x27;s well worth the extra money you pay for it.</li>
    <li> straight cut to the point toe nail clipper, not sure how to expand on that nice packaging shinny object easy to find in the medicine cabinet</li>
    <li> Works as expected. Solid construction. Blades are very sharp, and mesh properly. No problem clipping nails and hangnails. Comfortable in the hand.</li>
    <li> i think it&#x27;s a nice clipper but not a great one. it still leaves very sharp edges after cutting so i am not very satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> Disappointed.  This clipper is bigger and bulkier than I expected.  I had a German made one that was very effective and yet elegant and slim (my daughter took it away).  Although the Seki is a little clumsy to use, it is powerful.  But I think it is best suited for trimming Gorillas at the zoo.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t stand when nail clippers don&#x27;t give a crisp, clean cut. These do, and for that they are worth 5 stars. I&#x27;ve only been using them for a few months, but every cut is crisp and they&#x27;re easy to use. These are a safe bet (and even feel pretty hefty, for what it&#x27;s worth).</li>
    <li> the Japanese made great swords.  Now they make really nice toenail clippers.  Very good quality.  I would buy again but probably wont ever have to.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s like God himself sent down angels to trim my toe nails. These toe nail clippers cut through my nails like a hot knife through butter. Never before have I experienced such effortless clipping.</li>
    <li> Love it, best toe nail clipper I have ever had. Clips through the hardest toe nails with ease. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> These are big serious clippers for guys with thick toenails. Overkill for mine.</li>
    <li> As for high-quality nail clippers they are the best I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first bought the fingernail clippers.  They were so small and tightly curved that I thought they were for women and gave it to my wife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Than I got these toenail clippers and  they are about the right size for my fingers- my hands are not that large.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how others feel about this but both are so slippery that  can&#x27;t control where I am cutting. Sometimes they slip out of my hands. I expected the toenail clippers would be easier to hold but no.  Finally I put shrink tape on both parts and now I can hold them.&lt;br /&gt;Richard</li>
    <li> These. Are. Amazing. My nails are THICK and grow very quickly. I have to soak my nails in the shower to get them soft enough to cut with most clippers, and still, it&#x27;s very difficult to get a good cut. With these? One quick cut that barely takes any pressure slices cleanly, even outside of the shower. This is the Ninja of nail clippers, get them, you will be glad you did.</li>
    <li> hands down best nail cliiper you can find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i have owned some cheap clippers and got really frustrated with how hard they are to use.&lt;br /&gt;Finally i am investing in a good one, and this one makes clipping nails not painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totally recommend this to anyone who find clipping nails a bad experience.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best. Outstanding quality. Worth the price because you will never need to buy another set of clippers. I have several and the smaller ones for the fingers as well.</li>
    <li> A tool, not a toy.  Good heft and designed for handling.  Easy to use and sharp as a razor.  Very reasonable price to boot</li>
    <li> These are super duper clippers! Very strong and can easily cut nails. Would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> These are really nice sharp nail cutters. I&#x27;ve grown up with the cheapy ones that always had a chance to hurt because they were a bit dull. These cut really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only complaint was that it did get some rust spots after some months in a humid bathroom environment -- I&#x27;ll be more careful to store it in the cabinet which doesn&#x27;t get as wet.</li>
    <li> This is a a top tier nail clipper. Toe nails can be tricky to cut and this does a wonderful job. This  is especially important if you are (as I am, diabetic) Anyway, this is well made and will last for years. I am glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> Best quality toe nail clipper I&#x27;ve found. I plan to buy another one.</li>
    <li> I can definitely testify that these will cut through the thickest nails with ease. Maybe not a silent and some people have said, though they&#x27;re pretty darn good none the less. I do find that I slice a bit of the top layer of my nail on the ends of the fresh cuts. This might mean I need some more practice. They&#x27;re super comfortable as well.</li>
    <li> Seki is well-known for the quality of its products, and this clipper works quite well.  I gave the product only 4 stars because of a personal anomaly.  I have one toe which I injured several years ago.  It is fully healed; however the nail.is somewhat thicker than the others and it is slightly twisted.  The clipper will not open wide enough for nail to fully enter the opening, so I can&#x27;t cut this nail as easily or as straight as I can the others.  Another 1/8 inch in the opening would have prevented the problem, so -- minus one star.  If you don&#x27;t share my problem, I&#x27;m sure that you will.be very pleased with this clipper!</li>
    <li> These clippers are very sharp and cut very easily. They are easy to handle and work really well. Highly recomend.</li>
    <li> Razor Sharp and easily snips thick toe nails.</li>
    <li> These are sharpen than the other nail trimmers we have purchased in the past and do a great job of cutting the nail.</li>
    <li> Well, it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do- but its simply does it better than the drugstore brands I&#x27;ve been using all my life. This is a quality instrument and worth paying a little more for the sharp blades, clean, precise cuts and comfortable grip.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a great toe nail clipper. sharp, fast, sleek (sometimes too sleek to hold but it takes a bit of practice). I like the sleek design because it&#x27;s easy to clean and disinfect. I used to have to cut multiple times with other clippers; but not with the seki, just one cut. I&#x27;m not sure what other reviewers mean when they say poor construction. These clippers feel hefty in my hand, more so than other drug store brand clippers I&#x27;ve purchased in the past. I really like this clipper.</li>
    <li> Look No Further !!!  This is the one !  .....I&#x27;ve thrown out many clippers over the years;  but the quality of this &amp; how it cuts is amazing... I feel this will last a lifetime.  Worth the extra money... Go for it !</li>
    <li> Very sharp, easier to avoid spit nails with this clipper.</li>
    <li> I brought this for myself because if arthritis in my thumbs and was having trouble with another brand.  The clipper is easy to use because of the soft closure and sharp cutting surface.  My husband is thinking of swiping them, may need another pair.  Best buy for us.</li>
    <li> This is a high quality product. The blades are sharp and give a close cut, few bucks more than your $2 clippers but these will last forever. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> As soon as we lose a set of these, they are replaced immediately. Please make clipping your nails much more enjoyable than the cheap drugstore variety.</li>
    <li> I used to dread cutting my toe nails because it&#x27;s so thick and my regular drug store nail clipper just isn&#x27;t cutting it, literally. When it does, it breaks for of the nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seki Edge is so sharp. It&#x27;s effortless to cut my nails even my toe nail. It&#x27;s quite pricey but how often does it need replacing?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: After owning it for a year or so my opinion on it dimishined somewhat. While it does cut, the edges of my nail were always torn instead of cleanly cutted. It&#x27;s still better than cheap ones I guess.</li>
    <li> Good quick cutter for tough toe nails.  Used in combination with the Seki Edge Ss-202 Professional Nail Nipper for the side really curved sections does a good job.</li>
    <li> This are the best.. Excellent steel, sharp, they do the job just as described.. Don&#x27;t know how I put up with the cheapo&#x27;s for so long</li>
    <li> The openning gap is not 2mm either and can not grab or cut the tthick nails and it is not recommended.</li>
    <li> The clipper is of high quality and, as a result, a pleasure to use for a chore I could certainly do without.  It feels good and heavy in my hand and the blades are perfectly aligned for a quick, clean cut.</li>
    <li> I had been having problems with nail clippers, never finding the right ones that would do a good job clipping my nails cleanly and evenly, not leaving spurs, could clip fingernails and toenails, could handle the corners on ingrown nails or problem areas, could handle small clean-up spots without making matters worse, and so forth. I also had trouble finding clippers that would work in my hands with some very bad nerve tremors. I had bought individual clippers, sets of grooming tools, specialty clippers and items, and all sorts of things, all to no avail. I took a chance when I saw these Seki Edge clippers, and I could tell immediately I did not go wrong. First, they are very sharp, high-quality clippers - and sharpness makes a huge difference! They are aligned well, which eliminates the spurs and uneven spots. The basic fingernail and toenail clippers have specially formed ends and holding grooves on both the top and bottom ends to make them much easier to hold when your arm is extended, even with hand tremors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t imagine using anything else now. I let my wife try them out, and she loved them. I watched over her as she used them, took them back from her immediately, hid them from her, and am buying a set of them for her for her birthday at the end of this month. All the clippers purchased are excellent products I would highly recommend to anyone who wants great clippers at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> The toenail clipper is very sharp and clips easily, however it&#x27;s bottom part is too thick for small nails and I still need a regular, cheaper clipper for most of my nails.</li>
    <li> Someone said this was like the Cadillac of nail tools. It most certainly is. Smoother performance than even your imagination could deliver. Made with superior materials that are pretty well indestructible. I don&#x27;t know how to describe this product other than saying using it makes me feel guilty like i stole it out of some million dollar home. Might i add this was of course purchased for my husband and you know how male toenails are. They work the same on his nails as mine...like cutting through butter.&lt;br /&gt;I will be up-grading to all of their tools!</li>
    <li> It is hard to believe that something as simple as a nail clipper can offer such a high level of mechanical precision.  This one does.</li>
    <li> I purchased one of these at a much higher price from Brookstone 6 or so years back. It still works great. It is far more solid than the cheaper clippers that you&#x27;ll find at the big box retail and drug store chains. I have thick nails and these cut through them like butter. The only problem is that my wife keeps taking it out of my drawer and leaving it around the house. I purchased a second one recently and the build quality appears to be identical to my first one. I am very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Give me my old chip clippers back please. I&#x27;ve had these less than a year and they no longer clip my nails, they just dig softly in to my nails and I end up having to tear my nails off. I&#x27;m going to return them.&lt;br /&gt;Looking at the blades, which used to be super true and sharp, they now have chunks missing out of the blades so when they make contact there is very little true cutting area and no more &amp;#34;clip&amp;#34; sound. It looks like someone tried to used them as wire strippers.</li>
    <li> i have both this nipper and the smaller Seki and i like this better for my hands.  i never tried using it on my feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;outstanding quality - cuts like a laser beam with the most positive and reassuring \\&quot;click\\&quot; you can dream of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;why 4 stars ?  well it is more of a 4.5 star product, but the hinge looks fragile, and i do believe i heard somewhere that they do break.  it is weird too, because the clipper itself is built like a tank, but the hinge is very flimsy - i wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if it failed at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if the hinge was stronger i would have given it 5 stars - performance is flawless - but then, as i said, i use it on my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;its smaller brother looks like a toy - i really don&#x27;t see the point of getting the smaller one - i wish i only ordered this one instead of both.</li>
    <li> These are great clippers, are well made and work well!</li>
    <li> Overall, I&#x27;m happy with this product.  I like the ergonomics of it.  It cuts cleanly and evenly.  My only complaint is that it rusts easily (FYI I live near the coast).</li>
    <li> It functions well enough but as soon as I gave it a quick rinse it left a big rust stain on my counter and now the bolt and the area around it is rusted.  After ONE single rinse!  It&#x27;s supposed to be made out of stainless steel!</li>
    <li> I really do like these clippers.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the clipping edge is not what I am used to.  I&#x27;d prefer it to be longer...so you can cut more nail at one shot.  I would not suggest these clippers if you are prone to ingrown toenails.  It&#x27;s a bit too curved, so you have to be extra careful.</li>
    <li> Normally I would not write a review on a toe nail clipper but this thing is so easy and surgical.  No rough nails just a clean, crisp cut.  Worth the additional cost in my opinion.  My wife agrees.</li>
    <li> Craftsmanship you will enjoy For years of use. Affordable luxury. Not many luxury things that I can afford to buy but this is one.</li>
    <li> I know it is silly to be excited about a toe clipper but this is so sharp and accurate I love it!</li>
    <li> This Toe Nail Clipper is of exceptional good quality. The finish is superior to any other item of this nature I have ever owned. No doubt the Japanese people take pride in what they produce. Recommended 100%</li>
    <li> This it the best clipper! I&#x27;ve started giving them to family members as gifts since mine always tend to &amp;#34;disappear&amp;#34;!! Smooth stainless finish and amazingly clean fast clip of even the thickest nails. This item makes doing this chore effortless. Highly recommend this clipper.</li>
    <li> work very well just wish they had the under nail cleaner, its an option that I very much prefer</li>
    <li> Not the quality one would expect for the price.</li>
    <li> leaves a bit of a nasty edge that i think you need a file to finish.</li>
    <li> Great product! The design is not as simple as I would have liked, but it gets the job done. The top piece sometimes feels too clunky and uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> had no idea that nail clipper can be this good - it makes my feel that my nails are only paper thin!  amazing clipper!</li>
    <li> Cuts great and clean.  Also feels good in the hand.  Definitely worth buying!</li>
    <li> Very sharp and sturdy  I have tough toe nails and this product is the ticket</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to get excited about a toenail clipper, but this Seki Edge brings the goods. It feels nice and solid, won&#x27;t slip in your grip, and features extremely sharp blades. I&#x27;m able to clip nails in a matter of seconds, without worrying about leaving sharp edges or having to use a file to smooth them. Also, the bigger nails no longer require soaking - the Seki Edge slices right through them. Yes, it&#x27;s relatively expensive - but it&#x27;s an item you&#x27;ll likely keep in your toiletry bag for years without requiring a replacement. I&#x27;m very pleased with the purchase.</li>
    <li> It is wholly inadequate for toe nails. I was thinking \\&quot;GIANT \\&quot; toe nail CLIPPERS. One that has leverage like a fulcrum. Perhaps I should have specified \\&quot;MEN\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> The product is easy to use and of good quality. I would recommend it to anyone grappling with toenail issues.</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful nail clipper and will probably be the only one anyone would have to purchase due to the overall quality of steel,sharpness of blades,and overall construction.I had no problem buying this toe nail clipper due to the fact I currently own a smaller finger nail clipper which still cuts as well as it did when I bought it 30 years ago.</li>
    <li> The workmanship is exceptional. Finally, a clipper that actually works with minimal effort and clean cuts. Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> I love it.  Would recommend it .</li>
    <li> Great, very sharp and well built. In fact I bought the nail clipper and loved it so much that I purchased the toenail clipper</li>
    <li> These are so much better than your typical clippers I can&#x27;t describe it. They are sharp, solid and function very well. They are not semi-disposable like your more typical examples</li>
    <li> This is the best toe nail clipper I have purchased.  It is sharp, and cuts my nails without chipping.  It is well designed which makes it easy to hold and manipulate.  My grand-daughter is even confident when I use it on her because she sees how&lt;br /&gt;quickly and painlessly her nails are cut.</li>
    <li> Very best clippers I ever owned!</li>
    <li> Sharp. Hefty. Clean cuts. These are a well needed  upgrade to the run-of-the-mill grocery store beauty aisle nail clippers. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> is excellent. It keeps an edge, cuts very well, and is a vast improvement over the chrome clippers I have been able to purchase locally.</li>
    <li> I thought I was crazy spending $16 on clippers. But in the end this thing is amazing! I will never go back to the cheap brands again. I get nice clean cuts, it&#x27;s just so easy to use. Got it in two days with Amazon Prime.</li>
    <li> I got this clipper about a year ago and it was great. Unfortunately, it broke after a year of regular use - too bad.</li>
    <li> First I was sent fingernail trimmers instead of toenail trimmers. So I got the return label, drove them to UPS, and was credited for the return. Then I re-ordered and was correctly sent the Toenail Clippers this time, but their opening is way too small -- only 1/16\\&quot;, half the size of the opening on a cheap drugstore toenail clipper I already have! Wouldn&#x27;t recommend unless you have dainty toenails. See my customer image showing side by side comparison with cheap drugstore clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because the reason for return is \\&quot;not Amazon&#x27;s fault\\&quot; they said they might charge about six bucks for return shipping, plus I&#x27;d have to make another trip to UPS, so I&#x27;m giving these away...but hopefully I&#x27;m saving you from having to do the same if you have thick nails.</li>
    <li> One word, OUTSTANDING.</li>
    <li> This clipper is easy to use and works very well on old, calcified nails. It makes the task much easier.</li>
    <li> This is the best clipper by far of any that I have ever owned. I like the handle, a good size, not small like others. The cutting edges cut very well. Good leverage, someone finally it right in looking at how to improve a nail-clipper.</li>
    <li> There is something very satisfying about a truly well made product. This seki trimmer is such a device. All others seem to be designed to save every last penny of product cost, at the expense of quality.</li>
