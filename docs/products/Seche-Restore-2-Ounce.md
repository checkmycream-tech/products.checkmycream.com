      <li>This restored my top coats including sally hansen and essie</li>
      <li>And it saves me money because it more than doubles the life of a bottle of Seche Vite, which is my favorite top coat.</li>

      <li>Some polishes need more than others.</li>
      <li>I use it on all of my polishes and my Seche Vete Top coats.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works great!  Especially to restore my seche Vite top coat.  Glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Excellent size. Great price.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. Not only does it work on the seche top coat, but it works for all my other polishes as well. When I got it in the mail I couldn&#x27;t wait to use it on one of my favorite polishes that just simply was stingy and thick from how many times it&#x27;d been used. This stuff almost immediately turned stringy and thick back in to it&#x27;s original state when I bought the polish!! LOVE LOVE LOVE!! It&#x27;s the best polish restorer out there if you ask me!</li>
    <li> I wish i had this way sooner, because in the past I have thrown away so many great colors of polish because they got clumpy and gooey. All you have to do is open your polish, put in a few drops, shake, and then check what the consistency looks like. Some polishes need more than others. Great product and this size should last you forever, just be careful with the glass bottle and glass dropper! Store as needed to keep everything safe.</li>
    <li> Product as described, I love how big the bottle is for the price. I would definitely buy the thinner again. Love it!</li>
    <li> A few drops salvages any nail polish from becoming too gloopy and sticky. I don&#x27;t even use this for seche vite top coat, I got it for all my polishes.</li>
    <li> Used this on 3 different bottles of nail polish (Opi for Sephora brand). One bottle was a glitter type polish, two were not. 40 drops later per bottle and nothing changed. The polish didn&#x27;t dilute, loosen, smooth out, whatever you want to call it. The polish remained thick. I had high expectations of this product based on the success of other reviews. Sadly it was not meant to be.</li>
    <li> Works fantastically.  Love this thinner.  Great quality, fast shipping.</li>
    <li> this is a wonderful product, but the packaging isn&#x27;t great. It arrived to my house fine, but while still in the box it fell off the counter top onto the ground and cracked the glass bottle.  I quickly salvaged what I could and thinned out as many of my polishes as I was able. 5 stars for the product itself, but the packaging would receive 1 or 2 stars.</li>
    <li> now I don&#x27;t have to use nail polish remover. which messes up my nail polish&lt;br /&gt;I work wonderful will buy again when I run out</li>
    <li> If you love doing your nails get this product! It says to only use with seche but it works with other nail polishes as well.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and worked great on my molasses-consistency polishes. Just keep adding a few drops at a time and shake until its back to its normal consistency. One really thick polish took about 20 drops, but it was almost a solid to begin with. This is a huge jar and will last forever.</li>
    <li> Love this product, I use it to keep my nail polishes the right consistency when they start to get goopy. I wish they made a size between this large bottle and the smaller bottle but overall I think it is a decent value. Main complaint on this is the smell, like the top coat this thinner has a very strong chemical smell.</li>
    <li> My favorite Orly Toast the Couple polish became too thick to use. The Seche Vite nail polish thinner solved the problem, and I was able to use the full bottle of polish.</li>
    <li> Essential if you use Seche Vite since it will invariably get goopy by time you&#x27;re midway through the bottle (which is okay with me, since Seche works so well). I also use it on other polishes I have to revive them to new! I had bought the smaller bottle last time (0.5 oz), and I should have just bought this bigger bottle because it is a better value.</li>
    <li> You NEED this thinner if you use seche vite. If you use seche vite, then I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve had the unpleasant experience of having it thicken up about halfway. Do not fret! This baby will save your topcoat! It also works well for other polishes and topcoats. I&#x27;ve used this in in my OPI&#x27;s, China Glaze, Sally Hansen...you name it. It&#x27;s a great thinner and works very well with seche vite. The 2oz bottle on Amazon is a steal, considering you get 4 times the amount for less money than you would if you bought in stores. It comes with a dropper for ease of use. I totally recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have not used this brand yet, but other thinners have always worked to save old polishes from the trash!  I expect this will do just as well.</li>
    <li> This does a good job of restoring Seche Vite (which thickens quickly) and also old polishes that don&#x27;t dry any more.</li>
    <li> This is a must own product if you use Seche Vite topcoat.  I use it to maintain proper viscosity to my topcoat as well as my other nail polishes.</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING!! I was in possession of 3 bottles of super thick, goopy, unusable Seche Vite. I purchased this product and now I&#x27;m the proud owner of 3 bottles of USABLE Seche Vite!! It completely restores it to as good as new quality. I have also used it for many older colored polishes I own, and they work perfectly once again as well! I could not be happier with this product.</li>
    <li> This product is great and keeps my old, sticky nail polish fresh and thin. The thinner came quickly and packaged well. It comes with a dropper to put the thinner in the polish and was not damaged at all. Everything came perfectly and I love it!</li>
    <li> Works as intended...fast ship.  Can be used with any polish it seems.  I also recommend the clear top coat made by this company.</li>
    <li> This really does the job of restoring polishes to their former glory. I have a few polishes that I use constantly that tend to get goopy after a couple uses. But a few drops of Seche Vite and they&#x27;re back to normal. I&#x27;m glad I bought this and will continue using it to restore my nail polishes as needed.</li>
    <li> Works great with only a few drops to make thick old polish new again!</li>
    <li> Since this product either works or doesn&#x27;t, and it worked fine for me, I&#x27;m doing more of a PSA about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seche Restore contains toulene, among other solvents, so it can dilute any polish on the market (not sure on uv-gel though). Other thinners, depending on their status as 3, 4, or 5 free may be devoid of this universal thinner property--adding another thinner to some polishes, including Seche Vite may not dilute it. Adding Seche Restore to a 3,4,or 5 free polish will dilute it, but will cause it to no longer be 3, 4, or 5 free because it contains those chemicals intentionally left out of the others. Toulene (along with many other chemicals) has been linked with causing cancer, but it evaporates out during drying, so this product (along with all polishes, regardless of #-free status) should be used with care in a well-ventilated area to reduce/eliminate risk.</li>
    <li> I love that this totally turns an old sticky bottle of Seche Vite into an brand new bottle. My problem is that the bottles top isn&#x27;t secure enough. This last purchase was my second bottle because my first bottle leaked out/evaporated. I really do make sure that I twist it extra tight when I close it. I&#x27;m thinking that maybe I need to place plastic wrap or something over the opening before closing it. Maybe that&#x27;ll help. Just be warned that when you get this, even if you are not using it often, check the bottle occasionally and absolutely store it upright.</li>
    <li> This should have been here a few days ago and it&#x27;s still not I hope it gets here by next week</li>
    <li> WORKS!!!! I now can still save my bottles!!! ^_^ i am so happy to have used and found this product.</li>
    <li> Nothing bad to say. Works like it should and had standard shipping...</li>
    <li> Restore is a must have.  If you have a lot of polish you need this.  It is great.</li>
    <li> The thinner works to restore polish back from gloopy grossness without compromising the quality of the polish!! It really is worth the buy as only a few drops bring a useless polish back to life!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. It&#x27;s absolutely necessary if you&#x27;re using Seche Vite top coat, which gets goopy very quickly, but what&#x27;s been amazing is how many of the other polishes in my collection. I&#x27;ve been able to restore from &amp;#34;a little thick&amp;#34; to &amp;#34;pretty goopy&amp;#34; to &amp;#34;almost completely dried out&amp;#34;. Seriously, I had a 20-year old glitter polish that was almost a brick, and a couple of vials of this brought it back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a note, if you&#x27;re worried about scary chemicals, and you buy toluene-free polish and you use this on them, you&#x27;re negating your whole &amp;#34;less harsh chemical&amp;#34; polish. This is a STRONG solvent of butyl acetate, toluene, and alcohol. Beware the smell too.</li>
    <li> It just does what it says! And not only does it restore polish, but it makes it dry faster, shinier, and much more durable. A polish that had peeled before lasted a solid week. It basically makes make cheap polishes perform like much more expensive ones. And it saves me money because it more than doubles the life of a bottle of Seche Vite, which is my favorite top coat.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it to restore all of my polishes and so far it has worked phenomenally.</li>
    <li> Fingernail polish always dries out after a while and starts clumping when you paint it on.  Seche Restore solves that problem and returns the polish to a wonderfully fluid composition.  Couldn&#x27;t do without it.</li>
    <li> If you love nail polish, this is the BEST product in the world! you MUST have this in your arsenal. It will unclump and rehydrate any old polish, any brand in 2-3 drops!  You NEED this product!</li>
    <li> What more can I say? I love my Seche Vite topcoat, but it gets very thick very quickly, and once we go there we have strings of topcoat all over the place.  What&#x27;s a gal to do? Thin it down, but do it right. My two bottles of previously unusable topcoat are now perfect. Comes with a handy dropper, too.</li>
    <li> I have restored not only my Seche Vite, but also many bottles of polish that I thought were gone for good. Great stuff!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  Used it to restore my Seche Vite as well as some white nail polish that was previously goopy and too thick to use.  A few drops of Seche Restore, and they were like new.  The only complaint I have is that it would be nice if the dropper was somehow incorporated into the lid.  I&#x27;m afraid it will end up broken or lost.</li>
    <li> Love my Seche Restore. Wish I could find it for a cheaper price, but that&#x27;s a different issue. Since I use Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat as a final coat on all my manicures to give that super-professional look to the polish, I go through a lot of Seche Vite. When the Seche Vite (the small, .5 ounce bottle) is down to about halfway or less, it starts to thicken and dry in the bottle. This Seche Restore is the only thing that will thin it so I can use the last half of the product. As the manufacturers claim, Restore does restore well, without changing the way Seche Vite applies and dries. Other thinners contain different ingredients and make the Seche Vite much less effective (yes, I unwisely tried, but on the tiniest bit so there was little waste -- that high cost keeps me conservative). I also use the Seche Restore on my non-Seche nail polishes when they start to get thick. I consider Seche Restore to be as essential as Seche Vite itself, although I agree that Seche Vite does chip and shrink too much, but that&#x27;s a different review.</li>
    <li> This did exactly as it said it would.  Added it to my Seche Vite top coat and it thinned it out for use again.  My only complaint (hence the 4 stars) is that if you try to use it in this bottle, by pouring some into the nail polish bottle, you spill and waste quite a bit.  Wish it came with a dropper or even better, in a dropper bottle.</li>
    <li> this is the greatest stuff since sliced bread....if you haven&#x27;t used it already please try it and you will like it a lot</li>
    <li> Seche Vite is the perfect topcoat, but it does tend to thicken in the bottle with use.  This perfectly restores it to the right consistency and is well worth the price.  This purchase was a bargain at $6.88.</li>
    <li> Great for your Seche Vite Topcoat as well as older polishes that have thickened. I find it saves $ in the long run and it keeps my topcoat always perfectly self leveling. Seche Vite is definitely a Holy grail product for me.</li>
    <li> Thins the nail polish perfectly.  The nail police is like new!  A few drops go a long way.</li>
    <li> This is great! I haven&#x27;t used with actual Seche Vite top coat yet to see how that thins out but works good for all other polishes. I saw on some reviews that people said that the thinner made other polishes more shinny and I do think that is true. Not super shinny but shinier than it was</li>
    <li> The thinner showed up in great condition. It&#x27;s in it&#x27;s own sturdy box with a separate dropper to use it. The product itself is AMAZING. I was going to have to throw out a couple of my favorite polishes that were only half way gone but had gotten much too goopy to use. I used a full dropper for the thickest and now they go on like new. As another reviewer said this stuff even makes polishes a better quality. A must have if you care about your polishes!</li>
    <li> Best polish thinner ever. Comes packed in a real sturdy cardboard box with a secure compartment for the dropper, so I&#x27;ve never had one come damaged and I have purchased many. The quality of this product is just awesome.</li>
    <li> I loved it.  It restored many of my old nail polishes that were ready for going to the garbage container&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> Very liberal supply of dilution liquid and can ce used for both fast drying best ever top coat and nail polish with just 2 drops.</li>
    <li> What an easy to use thinner and it comes with a dropper!  You need very little to get your polish back to a normal consistency!</li>
    <li> I love how seche vite comes in glass containers. It really makes their product more high quality. The packaging is nice. :D</li>
    <li> It may be designed to work slowly, I don&#x27;t know. I have used other brands of nail polish thinner that require just a few drops, do not ruin the quality of the polish and work well. This product requires a great deal be used. I&#x27;m just not that satisfied.</li>
    <li> As a polish collector, I&#x27;ve had my fair share of dried up, old polishes. It&#x27;s part of owning polish. In the past, I threw these polishes away when they would get old. Now, I add Seche Vite Restore and will a few drops, they are good as new! (Some even better than new!) It makes the polish easy to apply and more fluid as well. This product DOES have a strong odor but it will not make all your polish smell the same, it fades ones added to the bottle of color. This is a GREAT investment. I&#x27;ve had my 2oz bottle for months now and I have used it on over 50 bottles- I&#x27;ve used about half of it.</li>
    <li> I tried it twice and its not like a magic liquid or something it did restore the polishes to a more liquidy form but nothing like the original form . its OK but not worth the money.</li>
    <li> well the product it self is fine. It will make your nail polish a bit thinner and usable but there is no shine. I think the acetone can do the trick too if the original shine of the nail polish is not going to be preserved.&lt;br /&gt;One thing that I really didn&#x27;t like and was and still is bothering me is that on the box it is written that this product may cause birth defects! Well ...... I know! I know; that this may mean nothing but it sticks at the back of your mind and every time I use it I feel like something may happen to me! lol though that I am not pregnant or something but you always wonder, what if......</li>
    <li> This bottle could be better designed. It is a big bottle with a screw top that comes with a separate glass bulb pipette that is fragile and easily lost. It would be better if the applicator was contained within the bottle. Also be aware that whatever this stuff is, it really stinks.</li>
    <li> Perfect and soooo helpful! I could kick myself for how long I went without this &amp; how many nail polishes were wasted. I use like 1/2 a dropper at a time to add to the nail polish. A couple times I&#x27;ve had polish that has really, really thickened and have had to use a couple of droppers-ful... this stuff worked like a charm on polishes that I thought were &#x27;dead&#x27;. I&#x27;ve also used it for quick dry and a top coat. I recommend it HIGHLY.</li>
    <li> i know this is made specifically for other seche products (got knows my vite turns into something resembling what comes out of a glue gun eventually), but i actually use it on all my polishes that get too gunked up over time and it works just as well on them, although you need more than 3-4 drops. i&#x27;d say start with 5-6 and go from there until you achieve the desired consistency.</li>
    <li> There comes a time in nearly every woman&#x27;s life where your favorite bottle of nail polish stops performing as it used to.  Instead of letting it clump away and then eventually toss it, you can buy this amazing product which actually will restore your nail polish to its original, uncongealed state.  This even comes with a dropper!  I bought the smaller size to see if I actually would like it, used that all up and moved on to the bigger size.  If you have a serious nail polish collection, skip the little bottles and buy the biggest one you can, because you will love it and use it often.</li>
    <li> This restored my top coats including sally hansen and essie ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My way to use it is, I first took thinner to a bowl and dip the brushes  from the goopy polishes into the thinner and then put those used thinner into the bottle. This way, the thinner renews the brush and the polish like magic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An update: I found out that the second ingredient of this product is toluene which is one of 3 chemicals that every polish maker now emphasize that they are free of. I do not know too much detail about what harm it can make, but if you try to avoid toxic chemicals, this might not be your best bet.</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff!! I don&#x27;t use Seche Vite Fast Drying Top Coat (at this moment...) but this has given life to so many of my other polishes that were on their last legs that I thought I might have to throw out. I&#x27;m so glad I ordered the large bottle as I have a large polish collection too!!</li>
    <li> So happy i found this! My top coat nail polish always becomes thick. I always need to buy a new bottle before its empty. Then i found this! Its so perfect for my Seche Vite top coat nail polish that i love. Now i can renew my top coat instead of buying a new one! This stuff is great. Works with all nail polishes.</li>
    <li> i love this product. Mostly because i don&#x27;t need to throw away all my dried up nail polishes. You do have to use more than the amount it says on the directions but thats fine with me. Probably like 10-15 drops. which is honestly no big deal. My advice to anyone buying this is don&#x27;t go reviving all your old nail polishes at once in hopes that they will stay that way. I usually only use it when i want to wear a certain color and its dried out. Because after sometime it goes back to being thick. Use this product only when you know you need too.</li>
    <li> I need more!! and i&#x27;m broke! lol I love this stuff it has saved so many old polishes that I have not used in a while. I have about 150 polishes of different brands and it works on them all. I need MORE and I will get MORE. when im not broke lol. :)</li>
    <li> This is the ONLY nail polish restore liquid I know I can count on. I&#x27;ve used others - and they are usually okay - but this  one is right every time. Yes, it is expensive- but so is my nail polish.  Why save a few bucks on the restore when you&#x27;ll lose that much or more letting you polish gum up or ruining with a less reliable product.</li>
    <li> I used it for restore my nail polishes but it did not work well as I expected.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this with a few polishes and it works as expected</li>
    <li> I need to buy some of this stuff as gifts for every woman in my life to save them some money! This product helps you renew old nail polishes, thus preventing the need to just throw them out!</li>
    <li> I have a lot of polishes and it&#x27;s good to know I never have to throw them out. The amount of money this saves you in being able to keep your polishes is so much!</li>
    <li> Six months ago I purchased the Seche Vite fast drying top coat as well as many Seche polishes and the UV top coat.  Thought ahead and putchased this bottle of restore.  Very important purchase!!  It doesn&#x27;t take long for the polishes to start losing their consistency, starting to go on gloopy or the top coat taking way too long to generate a bead.  But it only takes a few drops of the restore to bring it back to new consistency.  It comes with a handy dropper.  I expect this will last my lifetime even with needing to use it pretty much every time I polish my nails!</li>
    <li> Am so happy i ordered the thinner, i was using the nail polish remover but after sometime the polish will get bad. With this thinner makes my thick polish good again and don&#x60;t ruin it.</li>
    <li> In love with Seche Vite Fast Dry Top Coat but not in love with it shrinking my color about half way through the bottle. The Restore is a big help with that. I won&#x27;t go without either product.</li>
    <li> Why have to to trash many bottles of expensive nail polish when you can save then all! Works on all brans of nail polish that I have including sinful colors,ice, NYC, lo real, revlon, and seche vite top coat</li>
    <li> This is just about the best thing you can invest in! It&#x27;s a miracle worker!! This even works on cheaper brand polishes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to the Seche Vite line and am very impressed with the products I&#x27;ve used so far, including this thinner.  I have a large nail polish collection, so I use thinners all the time on older bottles.  Even if the nail polish hasn&#x27;t gotten very thick, it usually takes a lot of thinner to get the polish to the right consistency.  In addition, thinner makes nail polish more brittle so that it chips more easily, so I need to use more layers of top coat to protect it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Seche Vite thinner, I can get the right consistency using a lot less thinner, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to make the nail polish brittle, so I don&#x27;t have to use a ton of top coat to protect my nails.  It works great with both Seche Vite products and products by other companies.</li>
    <li> I used this thinner on many of my old, dried out manicures. This works great on manicures that are not too old but got a little bit thick in consistency. Do not expect it to turn your 8 year old nail polish into a new nail polish. I&#x27;d buy again once I run out of it since it seems to do the trick when my favorite nail polish starts drying out!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. I use it on all of my polishes and my Seche Vete Top coats. It does the job and is a great value.</li>
    <li> A few drops of this stuff into that gloopy bottle of a favorite old color,  stir gently or roll in your hands and POOF! New nail polish.  I&#x27;ve wasted so much money on nail polish before I found this stuff.</li>
    <li> works well, it did in fact restore my seche vite.  I&#x27;m not sure how many drops i&#x27;m supposed to put in, but I just go for it until my my top coat is working with me.  I like that it comes with a little dropper, its good to have this if you paint your nails every 3rd day like I do, because seche vite tends to lose its consistency.  I think it does help with other nail polishes, but I&#x27;m not sure.</li>
    <li> Love it! Works so well for use on the Seche Vite top/bottom coat and any other polish I have. Wish I seen this before I threw out my original thick top coat! We have mani pedi nights and girls always want to &amp;#34;borrow&amp;#34; this!</li>
    <li> Great value for the size. I love that I can make all my thick nail polishes like new again with this product. This bottle will last a very long time. A must for anyone who owns nail polish!</li>
    <li> This thinner will thin out most any polish you have and it comes with a dropper, so it is very easy to put into any polish</li>
    <li> Best polish thinner out there!</li>
    <li> works good to thin Seche Vite and other coats and colors.  Smells strong but goes away because it evaporates quickly.</li>
    <li> I like this thinner, cause it works great for restoring my seche vite top-coat, and works great on all other nail polishes too.</li>
    <li> Seche vite restore does exactly what it says, restores seche vite top coat with only a few drops...and more. I also use a few drops in other nail polishes that are starting to get thick and it restores them so I can use them. Seche vite restore cleans the dried sticky polish off the top of your bottles easily also. I love the restore and top coat of this brand.</li>
    <li> Love Seche and it requires this Restore to dilute it.  Love having a big bottle to use.</li>
    <li> This stuff WORKS!  I used it with my Seche Vite top coat and with a few color polishes.  I got 3-4 extra uses out of my favorite color because of this stuff.  amazing.</li>
    <li> was finally able to rescue my almost dried up nail polishes, especially the metallic ones which have the tendency of drying really fast.</li>
    <li> I believe this product will be great, as I love the clear coat nail polish. I just haven&#x27;t had to use this product yet.</li>
    <li> This will:&lt;br /&gt;- Restore your glumpy, gloopy, uselessly thickened Seche Vite topcoat to its former glory&lt;br /&gt;- Thin any of your other polishes that have become too thick to apply properly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am told that it is expensive for what it is - that regular paint thinner would work fine. That&#x27;s as may be, but I&#x27;d rather not experiment with my polishes, and since Restore works so well, I&#x27;m sticking to it.</li>
    <li> I put it in everything. If a nail polish isn&#x27;t going on smoothly enough, I drop some of this stuff in there every time. I actually can&#x27;t imagine being without it now - it&#x27;s so useful. I even use a few drops in Seche Clear when it gets close to the bottom of the bottle and gets a little goopy.</li>
    <li> Good product but so little amount for a price that&#x27;s higher than the other brands that have more than 2 oz</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! You can actually use an entire bottle of seche vite if you add this thinner. Saves money in the long run.</li>
    <li> Too often my polish thickens &amp; becomes unusable before it should. I&#x27;m extremely happy with the performance &amp; wear after use. Their top coat is great too!</li>
    <li> Got this to restore my seche top coat, as well as other polishes. Works amazing in only 2 drops. Before I knew of polish thinner, I was guilty of using acetone to thin down my polish. I ruined so many polishes in my days and am totally glad I found this! This bottle may be small, but it will last me forever at just 2, maybe 3 drops a polish.</li>
    <li> This stuff definitely saves your Seche Vite.  My was all glumpy and leaving trails because I had misplaced it and hadn&#x27;t been able to use it in some time, so it was open a long time.  I added this (and a couple of metal balls to aid mixing) and shook, added and shook, added and shook.  Finally, the texture returned to smooth and glossy, and as good as new.  It really did!  As to adding this to restore regular nail polish-- I haven&#x27;t tried it yet.  You do get a large amount, so now you can buy large amounts of Seche Vite and have no fear that it will lose its oomph, because this stuff will fix it right up!</li>
    <li> Works great, and a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;Restored my 7 year old Hard Candy nail polish back to it&#x27;s former glory!</li>
    <li> Now I can really use my polishes to the last drop. Bottles I was about to throw out with half of the product still in them, I can now use. Happy!</li>
    <li> I love this thinner.  It does exactly what it says it will do.  Would purchase again.  Best price I found.</li>
    <li> This works wonders to restore nail Polish to original constancy.  Sometimes I only need a drop or two, other times I need a dropper full.</li>
    <li> Really good value, thins out other polishes well too. Wish it didn&#x27;t have such a strong smell. Recommend if you&#x27;re a seche topcoat user.</li>
    <li> I ordered this to keep my constantly-refilled bottle of Seche Vite in check.  I have a normal, half ounce sized bottle of Seche Vite that I refill from a larger, 6oz bottle (that I also bought here on amazon for a steal.)  Once my in-use bottle reaches the half full mark, I alternate between filling it all the way back up and thinning it with the Restore.    This s*** is amazing, okay?  I was one of those broads who bought the cheap 4oz bottles of polish thinner from Sally for five bucks and claimed up one side and down the other that it worked just fine for thinning polish and Seche Vite alike.  I was.  I&#x27;ll admit it.  I was also so.. effing.. wrong.  Can you thin your Seche Vite with regular thinner without destroying it?  Sure.    But this stuff is so much better.  SO MUCH BETTER, okay?  I used about a dropper full (it comes with a rad glass dropper.  muy bueno.) to try and fix up a bottle of polish I&#x27;d had since high school... and it worked.  I&#x27;m gonna be thirty in a couple weeks, alright?  For ye who are allergic to the maths, that&#x27;s about fifteen years.  As in, this crusty old bottle of nail polish is almost an antique, and Restore Frankensteined the crap out of it and made it use-able again.    Does it smell?  If course it smells.  It&#x27;s volatile chemicals.  Chances are that if you&#x27;re looking to buy this stuff, it&#x27;s because you have a half full, goopy bottle of Seche Vite already.  It smells like that.  Because it&#x27;s all the crap that was already in your top coat and evaporated out.    So, ya know.  Like I said.  Stinky bottle of black magic.  It works.  Buy it.  Tell your friends.</li>
    <li> This product is great! Saved me from having to through out some of my favoret nail polishes. I would definatly recomend this.</li>
    <li> After seeing the reviews, I decided to give it a try. I really like it! Some of my polishes are starting to get chunky in texture, now I don&#x27;t have to throw them out.</li>
    <li> Restores not just SV but all of my goopy polishes and brought them back to their original state. Love it.</li>
    <li> You need this to maintain the consistency of Seche Vite top coat, which is a marvel of a product itself. It can also be used as a thinner for other nail polishes. Not only will it restore them to workable consistency, they may even perform  better than originally with this rapid-drying solvent.</li>
    <li> Continue to purchase once I run out. Am complete head over heals with Seche products. Nothing negative to say. Item arrived very well packaged and in top notch conditon.</li>
    <li> The 1 downfall to Seche Vite topcoat is it sometimes thickens up and needs to be maintained with the Seche Vite Restore Thinner. The restore thinner can also be used with other polishes. I will definitely purchase both the topcoat &amp; restore thinner again when my is empty.</li>
    <li> I love that they made a thinner for the top coat. It dried out too quickly and regular thinners didnt work, but this does.</li>
    <li> I wanted to bring my Seche Vite top coat back to life, this is what this is meant for and did the job. I also used it for other nailpolish bottles. It took a bunch of drops but it brought back to life one of my polishes that was so dried out it was just cracked and cacked on the bottle. I didn&#x27;t think it would work, but I wanted to give it a try anyway. I kept putting drops in and shaking the bottle (I know you&#x27;re not supposed to shake bottles but it works best for trying to restore a nailpolish bottle) and then finally toward the end it was back to being useful. So excited about all the nail polish bottles I was able to save and restore back to being useful. Hope this helps in whether or not this is what you are looking for.</li>
    <li> saved alot of my nail polishes ♥</li>
    <li> This thins old sticky thick nail polish down to how it was originally was. Great product !</li>
    <li> prodotto molto valido e utile in quanto evita l&#x27;essicazione dello smalto di ricopertura e così più lunga durata. Sono  molto contenta di questo acquisto. Grazie.</li>
    <li> If you own a boat load of polish, this stuff is a must have!  Just as few drops brings old, thickened polish back to just like it&#x27;s a new bottle.  Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d read on someone&#x27;s blog that this stuff would restore ANY gummy polish, and it&#x27;s true! I restored some vintage colors I had and they are now as good as new again. I will never go without having a bottle of this around. It&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> As someone who is really into nail art and nail polish, one of my peeves is when polish becomes too thick to put on or too clumpy.  For example, I found a polish that was quite old and a few drops of Restore, it went on as new.</li>
    <li> Omg!!! This stuff is AMAZING, a few drops and your polish is good as new. I&#x27;m always doing designs on my nails and my strippers dry out quickly forcing me to buy new ones, now I just add a few drops of Seche Vite Restore shake it up and let it sit for a second. Couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> Seche vite is my favorite top coat so when it started coming out stringy I bought the restore and was so happy to have saved my polish. Needed more than a few drops but very happy with it.</li>
    <li> For anyone that uses Seche Vite, you know that you can only use their thinner &amp;#34;Restore&amp;#34;...it is hard to find, but I found it on Amazon and am very happy with my purchase and the seller, who was very prompt in shipping.</li>
    <li> The price paid for the product was a great deal! I only use Seche Vite fast dry top coats and I needed this to thin them out when they get to thick. Also great for thinning out regular nail polishes as well!</li>
    <li> This is the only thing that works for my seche vite top coat. I&#x27;ve tried using regular stuff from Sally&#x27;s and it didn&#x27;t do anything at all. I just wish Seche Vite Top Coat didn&#x27;t dry out and thicken SO fast! But this stuff is really great!</li>
    <li> For some reason the Seche Vite top coat seems to thicken very quickly.  You absolutely need this thinner so that you don&#x27;t toss your top coat!</li>
    <li> Way beyond my imagination....this product really lives up to its name. It actually retores the top or base coat to its right consistency. I&#x27;ve also tried it with other nail polishes and it works beautifully.....just a few drops needed.Will definitely order again and again</li>
    <li> Received item several days earlier than expected. Have only used it once, but it worked well on the that product.</li>
    <li> SO I LOVE LOVE LOVE Seche Vite top coat, but it does tend to get thick. I have been using this top coat for a couple of years now and it is the only brand I have used where I love it so much that I use the entire bottle, but it does tend to get really thick near the end. I tried this on my current &amp;#34;thick bottle&amp;#34; it works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; tested side by side with a new bottle I bought and when my nails dried the nails with the new bottle v the bottle I thinned with The Restore Thinner both looked the same. I have in the past tried to use remover to thin my bottles of polish, this works better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Also I tried this on a couple of colored polishes and it worked just as good. I need to use several droppers full for the seche vite top coat but needed much les for my colored polish. I would suggest using a little at a time then mixing and adding more if needed so you don&#x27;t use too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I am very satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> I actually save money by purchasing this product since I no longer have to throw out my old &amp; favorite nail polish. I add a few drops of Seche Restore and it&#x27;s as good as new.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! it restores any polish! and another plus was that it shipped super fast! I got it 3 days after i had ordered it. this product is heaven for all us nail polish lovers.</li>
    <li> I fell in love with the Seche Vite line of products as soon as I used their dry fast top coat, over time however the top coat thickens but the restore thinner is the perfect thing to bring it back to life. Very good price for the size and I believe it will last me a long time.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I was able to use some to thin out a beautiful OPI polish that is no longer made. I also use this to keep my Seche Vite from being too thick. This product helps save money from having to buy more Vite.</li>
    <li> I only wish the dropper was integrated into the cap as it could get lost or broken.</li>
    <li> I needed a thinner for my Seche Vite top coat. Those who use SV know that it gets thick and goopy after about half way through, a few drops of this and it is good as new! It also works great on regular polish. It only requires 2-4 drops to get it back to it&#x27;s original consistency, so 2 oz will go a long way.</li>
    <li> There is nothing to not like about restore thinner for nail polish.  It extends the life of your nail polish.  Previously I&#x27;ve thrown away perfectly good nail polish before knowing about this product.  I use it regularly and recommend it for people who have several nail polish colors that tend to dry out or get too thick before they use it up.</li>
    <li> This stuff is a miracle product. I have yet to find a nail polish that can&#x27;t be made like new with this. I bought a large bottle so I don&#x27;t have to be so worried about running out because sometimes you do have to use a liberal amount!</li>
    <li> love this product, so glad i tried it.  works great!  highly recommend to anyone with old polish laying around don&#x27;t throw em out do urself a favor and invest in this!</li>
    <li> Works fantastic to thin Seche Vite topcoat and all other polishes.  Next to Seche Vite, this is a MUST HAVE.</li>
    <li> Like the way it works and am always glad to get a good deal. Most any Seche Vite product in a 2 or 4 ounce size is going to be worth the money just because of the price of the 1/2 ounce sizes. The fact that this will let me use all of my top coat instead of having that 1/4 of a bottle too thick &amp; stringy to use is just the best. Would recommend.&lt;br /&gt;  2-22-13 Have added this to some OPI polish that was over 1 yr. old and just too thick. Not only did it thin it without changing the color but it dried in less than half the usual dry time. I may have put a few too many drops in the bottle because it did need 2 coats instead of 1 but not waiting for 10 mins. to dry was worth the 2 coats. It also made using a 2nd color easier. Not only would I recommend but I&#x27;m going to share with a friend &amp; when this bottle is gone I&#x27;ll be buying more!!!</li>
    <li> Great stuff!!! If you own the topcoat you NEED this! It is also handy to have to help restore any clumpy or thick bottle of polish. Would definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> Very strong smell!!!!!!! I mean stronger than any other product that I&#x27;ve ever used, but it works. As long as your polish isn&#x27;t too far gone. It does not revive dead dried out polish, just polish that might be on the thick, sticky, or tacky side. Don&#x27;t expect a miracle, your polish must still be usable.</li>
    <li> Worked wonderfully with my old Sally Hansen nail polishes.</li>
    <li> Love it works wonderful will buy again shipping was also awesome came super fast loved that</li>
    <li> Best thinner out there, I think! I have some polishes that are pretty ancient and really needed some help getting back to their former glory and this was just the thing!!</li>
    <li> This is awesome. Not enough in the bottle but it is awesome. I will definitely buy more.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!! So glad I found it!!! I kept having to throw out my half used bottle of the top coat, now that I have this I can use the whole bottle without it getting goopy! It has saved many nail polishes too!! This bottle will last a long time! You just need a couple drops and your nail polish and Seche top coat is as good as you just bought it!! A must have!!!</li>
    <li> Ladies, along with the other reviewers I agree that this product works. However the reason why it works is because it&#x27;s a big old bottle of toluene. Check the ingredients and you&#x27;ll see that it&#x27;s true. Why does this matter? Because toluene is that nasty chemical that was taken out of all major nail polish brands because it was deemed harmful. That&#x27;s why your nail polishes were reformulated during the past 10 years or so. So when you use this, you&#x27;re adding it back in. You should be aware that that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re doing. If you don&#x27;t care, keep using this. If you don&#x27;t want to be putting toluene on your nails, which I don&#x27;t, you&#x27;ll just spring for a new bottle of nail polish. If you buy a higher priced polish, the new Dior varieties are my choice, you&#x27;ll find that you&#x27;ll get the use of most of the bottle without any thinners because they&#x27;re just better.</li>
    <li> Seche Restore has made it possible for me to finish my bottle of Seche Vite without throwing it away once it gets goopy about halfway through. It says to add a &amp;#34;few&amp;#34; drops, but I usually use an entire dropper or more, depending how thick the top coat has gotten. I&#x27;ve tried using it on some other polishes with mixed results, and I would not recommend adding it to 3/5-Free polishes as this contains toulene. It smells strongly of chemicals, so I suggest you use it in a well ventilated area.</li>
    <li> Great for thinning the Seche Vite topcoat and any brand of nail polish as well!</li>
</ol>
