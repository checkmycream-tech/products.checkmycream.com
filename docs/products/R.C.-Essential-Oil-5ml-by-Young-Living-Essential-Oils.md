    <li> This is amazing!  My allergies are so bad and I have a difficult time breathing.  Just a small drop on the finger and place&lt;br /&gt;on the outside of the nose so that you can smell the oil is so helpful for me.  If you have sensitive skin you may need to check&lt;br /&gt;with your doctor and Young Living supplier for how to best use this product.</li>
    <li> I can see the difference when I use R.C. on my mother.  Just a drop or two and I can see that her breathing is improved, and allergies symptoms subside.  I would recommend this product to anyone interested in finding help with respiratory problems.</li>
    <li> for daughter to take to Korea in case she gets respiratory problems.</li>
