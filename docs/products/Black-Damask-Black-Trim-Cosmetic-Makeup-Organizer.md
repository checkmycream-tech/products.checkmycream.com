      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Love it.  </li>
      <li>But to be on fair side I am not the right to rate it.</li>
      <li>Super cute and durable!</li>
      <li>This bag holds all my make-up and keeps everything organized...plus its super cute!</li>
      <li>Looks like a great bag for my young grand daughter.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a real nice size and can hold pretty much anything you would be taking with you on your trip.  </li>
      <li>The pocket wasn&#x27;t even full!</li>
      <li>It is of much better quality than I had anticipated it being, it&#x27;s super cute.. not too bulky to fit into a carryon sized bag.  </li>
      <li>It kind of smells when first used but the smell will eventually go away.</li>
      <li>It holds everything that I need it to hold and looks super cute.</li>
      <li>We gave one as birthday gift for one of my daughter&#x27;s friends whose sister liked it so much that she took it</li>
      <li>I can fit all my perfumes (I have a lot..</li>
      <li>I use it at home for make up and it wipes clean easily too.  </li>
      <li>I would say with too much in it, as I well over packed it wouldn&#x27;t close all the way by the Velcro when rolled up but putting my larger bottles in a ziploc for the airplane was no problem and worked out best as I wouldn&#x27;t want any spills from baggage handlers tossing my checked luggage around.</li>
      <li>It was easy to find and the price was right.</li>
      <li>Good enough quality for the price.</li>
      <li>my toiletry bag has absolutely no bad odor.  </li>
      <li>&amp; it&#x27;s super cute &amp; very convenient.</li>
      <li>I do love that there aren&#x27;t too many different compartments ..</li>
      <li>worth the price I modified it by coloring in the white part with bright highlighters</li>
      <li>Folds up nicely and the hanger hook is extra convenience.</li>
      <li>I am planning to purchase the large rolling suitcase here on Amazon with the matching pattern :) Highly recommend</li>
      <li>I might have liked one large plastic pouch instead of two smaller ones because I generally carry a full size tube of toothpaste, but I was able to make it work.</li>
      <li>(I had to fix them to zip right).</li>
      <li>Just the right size.  </li>
      <li>I would have liked it more if it came with a mirror, but of course that is not a big deal, (that is the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The first time I opened the case the stitching that holds the velcro on ripped right off.  </li>
      <li>If I can&#x27;t get it clean, I love it so much that I will be buying another one for next year.</li>
      <li>I have a small bathroom and it is nice to hang on the towel rod for easy access.  </li>
      <li>Shipping was very fast -</li>
      <li>Zipper broke on first usage.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty, and might work if you don&#x27;t want to fill the pockets.</li>
      <li>But the first time I went to zip close the pocket the zipper broke off.</li>
      <li>It has many compartments for toiletries, perfumes, personal items and hangs just about anywhere the hanger that comes with t.  </li>
      <li>oops) in the bottom pocket and the two clear ones can fit my makeup rather well.</li>
      <li>This is an efficient way to store and organize your makeup and roll it up when you are traveling (which for me is pretty often).</li>
      <li>The mesh area is nice for other odds and ends and jewelry.</li>
      <li>This is a large hanging organizer and with a 2 week trip to Sweden</li>
      <li>that way I can just fit what I need into the bigger zipper compartments (makeup, brushes, etc.)</li>
      <li>However, when you do use all the pockets, it doesn&#x27;t fold and the velcro to close it doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
      <li>Its a good bag a recommend for everyone to at least have one.</li>
      <li>I used this or one trip and the zipper in the main compartment broke -</li>
      <li>The product is cute and an excellent size for travel toiletries, but the horrible smell makes it unusable.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this as a traveling bag.  </li>
      <li>High marks for this well made product.</li>
      <li>middle zipper also broke the first time I used it!</li>
      <li>I would definitely buy this again and it was worth the price for me.</li>
      <li>When really full, it struggles to Velcro close a little bit but other than that I love it.  </li>
      <li>and I love that it is NOT really that big.</li>
      <li>This bag is smaller than I had expected it to be, however I still love it</li>
      <li>The only negative thing I have to say is that when I folded to close it velcro wasnt very strong to keep it closed buttom clip would have been better and stronger.</li>
      <li>I will say that I am pleasantly surprised!  </li>
      <li>It was also larger than expected but still fit the suitcase well.</li>
      <li>but when I bought it, it wasn&#x27;t clear that it was a tri-fold</li>

    <li> My daughter is in competitive dance and it holds ALL her makeup and hair products and a few extra things we carry. This bag has plenty of leftover room and I love that it is NOT really that big. It has been one of my best finds. I haven&#x27;t tried cleaning it yet ... the make up we use gets EVERY where. Glitter too. If I can&#x27;t get it clean, I love it so much that I will be buying another one for next year.</li>
    <li> Shipping was very fast - It looks great, it only has four pockets which is a little inconvenient when I have a lot of different things I want to put in it.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Larger than I expected for the price. Made great gifts</li>
    <li> Looks like a great bag for my young grand daughter.</li>
    <li> Great quality and very large. I have a lot of makeup and things I like to travel with so this is absolutely perfect!</li>
    <li> The product is cute and an excellent size for travel toiletries, but the horrible smell makes it unusable. I&#x27;ve washed it repeatedly with detergent, dish soap, and hot and cold water. No matter what I do, the smell remains. I&#x27;ve read that it could be due to toxic chemicals used in manufacturing, though I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s the case for this particular bag, I&#x27;m throwing it away just to be on the safe side.</li>
    <li> Beautiful, useful and stylish. Excellent! For any woman  who travels and wants to have their personal items close, without fuss.</li>
    <li> It was a gift for my granddaughter,which she just loved it.  It has many compartments for toiletries, perfumes, personal items and hangs just about anywhere the hanger that comes with t.  It&#x27;s a real nice size and can hold pretty much anything you would be taking with you on your trip.  The color really stood out which went with a same color case for her hair dryer.  I recommend for those who need a handy place to carry all their necessities when traveling.</li>
    <li> I agree with the previous comment about the bag being smelly! I put it outside in hopes that it would air out!&lt;br /&gt;The middle zipper also broke the first time I used it! I&#x27;m trying to pack my hospital bag for labor so no time to send it back!</li>
    <li> This is a large hanging organizer and with a 2 week trip to Sweden I needed something to hold all my essentials for the trip. This product was just what I needed and kept me organized and sane. I would say with too much in it, as I well over packed it wouldn&#x27;t close all the way by the Velcro when rolled up but putting my larger bottles in a ziploc for the airplane was no problem and worked out best as I wouldn&#x27;t want any spills from baggage handlers tossing my checked luggage around.</li>
    <li> Perfect bag for traveling.  I recently took this on a trip to Europe and it held all the items I brought plus some.  I was able to use the bottom pouch for brushes and a straightener which, saved me from bringing an additional bag.  The fabric is durable and attractive.  I would highly recommend this as a traveling bag.  Most of the pouches are see through so, you get to see where you put everything.  High marks for this well made product.</li>
    <li> Got this for my niece for Christmas along with some other makeup stuff. She loved it and it has plenty of space for her stuff.</li>
    <li> It fits everything I have. I don&#x27;t need to dig around in a makeup bag to find the things I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
    <li> This bag is smaller than I had expected it to be, however I still love it &amp; it&#x27;s super cute &amp; very convenient. I am definitely a satisfied customer :)</li>
    <li> Loved it&lt;br /&gt;Large n fit my needs&lt;br /&gt;It was a gift for my sister&lt;br /&gt;That is all I have tosay</li>
    <li> This bag is perfect for carrying whatever you need for travelling. It was also larger than expected but still fit the suitcase well.</li>
    <li> Sturdy reliable product with convenient compartments. Love the print. Wish it were a tad bit longer with 2 additional pockets.would recommend product again.</li>
    <li> I was replacing a bag I had for a long time and searched hard for something with lots of room that was also functional. The zippered area is spacious and holds a lot (and you can still close it up). I might have liked one large plastic pouch instead of two smaller ones because I generally carry a full size tube of toothpaste, but I was able to make it work. The mesh area is nice for other odds and ends and jewelry. Folds up nicely and the hanger hook is extra convenience.</li>
    <li> Zipper broke on first usage. The fabric is nice, price was good, but it should have lasted longer than one hour.</li>
    <li> Very cute! Good enough quality for the price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty, and might work if you don&#x27;t want to fill the pockets. However, when you do use all the pockets, it doesn&#x27;t fold and the velcro to close it doesn&#x27;t work very well. It&#x27;s not terrible, but I wish I&#x27;d gone with something else.</li>
    <li> Super cute and durable! I am planning to purchase the large rolling suitcase here on Amazon with the matching pattern :) Highly recommend</li>
    <li> For the price, I can&#x27;t complain, hangs well, and is very compact and flat when it rolls up, EVEN PACKED WITH STUFF. the only thing is the zipper needs some breaking in because the way the bag was shipped, the zipper flattened away from the tag making it get stuck when closed.</li>
    <li> I bought this bag for my daughter for her dorm room. Works great, great space saver!&lt;br /&gt;First time I have had to purchase something like this. Definitely give this a thumbs up!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my friends. Seems they like it. But to be on fair side I am not the right to rate it.</li>
    <li> This is a perfect compact size. I love it. I will put it to good use when I travel anywhere.</li>
    <li> I used this or one trip and the zipper in the main compartment broke - it wasn&#x27;t even overfilled! :(</li>
    <li> This product is good for people who travel a lot and have A LOT of make up like me. It kind of smells when first used but the smell will eventually go away. Its a good bag a recommend for everyone to at least have one.</li>
    <li> Love it so far, all my makeup fit perfectly and its easy to find! deff. worth the price I modified it by coloring in the white part with bright highlighters and it looks great! i deff. recommend it.</li>
    <li> Most satisfactory for the cost</li>
    <li> I read the other reviews and was slightly hesitant to purchase this toiletry bag.  I will say that I am pleasantly surprised!  It is of much better quality than I had anticipated it being, it&#x27;s super cute.. not too bulky to fit into a carryon sized bag.  I plan on using it on our travels to Europe for 2 months and by the looks of it, I anticipate it holding up well.  I do love that there aren&#x27;t too many different compartments .. that way I can just fit what I need into the bigger zipper compartments (makeup, brushes, etc.) and the top zipper compartment is mesh-like so I can put washcloths in it and allow them to dry!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, others commented on a smell.. my toiletry bag has absolutely no bad odor.  I got the black &amp; white damask print.</li>
    <li> I like how it I was able to organize my makeup alot of pocket. The only negative thing I have to say is that when I folded to close it velcro wasnt very strong to keep it closed buttom clip would have been better and stronger.</li>
    <li> I bought this to take on a trip.  The first time I opened the case the stitching that holds the velcro on ripped right off.  Such a waste of money!</li>
    <li> Love it.  It holds everything I need for a night or weeks away from home.  Attractive too.</li>
    <li> Holds all my essentials! It is great when I go to the gym and take showers. It hangs on the shower door well!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t traveled anywhere with this but the option to hang it up in my closet is amazing. I can fit all my perfumes (I have a lot.. oops) in the bottom pocket and the two clear ones can fit my makeup rather well. Bag fits a lot of things and I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t count on putting too much in the zippered compartment at the bottom as the bag will not fold up and close properly especially if you have already put things in the other compartments. Great for two day trips.</li>
    <li> When It first arrived I was so pleased as it is the perfect size to fit everything I needed for traveling. But the first time I went to zip close the pocket the zipper broke off. The pocket wasn&#x27;t even full! I was very disappointed in how fast it broke. I was leaving the next day and had to use it anyway and some shampoo got on the inside so I feel I cant return it but want to warn others from buying this.</li>
    <li> I bought a similar bag for my daughter at a craft show a couple of years ago. The cosmetic bag has plenty of pockets for everything needed for travel. We gave one as birthday gift for one of my daughter&#x27;s friends whose sister liked it so much that she took it ( so I bought another one. So when my mother asked for a bag - I knew I had to find one on line. It was easy to find and the price was right.</li>
    <li> The bag did the job but when I bought it, it wasn&#x27;t clear that it was a tri-fold and that was definitely not what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I bought this bag along with the small cosmetic makeup bag and the duffle bag all in the damask print. All were in good condition except for this one which I recieved with a rip in it on the exterior shell of the bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, onto the product.  It folds into three with a Velcro closure.  It has all the compartments as shown in the picture.  All the compartments are spacious and could accommodate more than just travel sized items/ toiletries e.t.c.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chances are every bag shipped won&#x27;t have a rip in it, so it is a good buy all in all.</li>
    <li> Fits all my travel makeup! Love it!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know about this one. I purchased it for toiletries and think I&#x27;m sending it back, not much room for shampoos or toothpaste. I&#x27;d hold off on this one.</li>
    <li> The item was not what I expected it to be. On day 2 after recieving the item the hook came undone and the zippers did not work well (I had to fix them to zip right). The sad thing is that I didnt have any cosmetic items in the bag yet so I just didnt bother to use it. Not that satisfied.......:(</li>
    <li> This bag is great and it will be awesome to take on trips and vacation because it holds so much</li>
    <li> This bag holds all my make-up and keeps everything organized...plus its super cute!</li>
    <li> Love it.  Just the right size.  Doesn&#x27;t drag on floor when you hang it from a door knob.</li>
    <li> I love this bag and have used it every day for almost a year.  I have a small bathroom and it is nice to hang on the towel rod for easy access.  I like the compartments and it rolls up nicely and has a lot of Velcro for expanding from products.  When really full, it struggles to Velcro close a little bit but other than that I love it.  I have traveled with it for my toiletries and it is small with just enough room inside.  I use it at home for make up and it wipes clean easily too.  All-in-all I would definitely buy this again and it was worth the price for me.</li>
    <li> smaller than expected</li>
    <li> I love the look of this. I haven&#x27;t yet packed with it, but will be traveling soon. I&#x27;m looking forward to trying it out!</li>
    <li> The only negative thing I have to say about this bag is that it does not have a removable carrying case, but I knew that when I purchased it so it&#x27;s okay. It holds everything that I need it to hold and looks super cute. It didn&#x27;t have a bad smell and came nicely packaged in a box with protective plastic air bags surrounding it. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone who needs a more organized toiletry bag for travelling or dorm rooms.</li>
    <li> This is an efficient way to store and organize your makeup and roll it up when you are traveling (which for me is pretty often). It has Velcro on it so it just rolls into a little bag with a little handle when you are on the go. I would have liked it more if it came with a mirror, but of course that is not a big deal, (that is the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a lot of makeup, I would get a bigger one. If you have an average amount (the basics that you need), this works well. The bottom pouch I put my brush and hair binders and it&#x27;s really nice to just have all your things in one spot. I also like that is hangs.</li>
