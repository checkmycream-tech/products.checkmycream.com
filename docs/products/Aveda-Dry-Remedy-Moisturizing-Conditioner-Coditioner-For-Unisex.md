<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> For the past 6 winters (since I moved to Minnesota) I have been looking for a product that would eliminate static in my hair, unsuccessfully. My hair was so dry and my scalp so itchy that it was driving me nuts. None of the regular moisturizing products helped at all. I tried all kinds of shampoos, conditioners, and finishing treatments which did absolutely nothing. I even tried spraying Static Guard on my hairbrush and hair spray, which I hate using, without any effect. I had my hair cut at my local Liv Aveda 6 weeks ago, and asked for a recommendation, and they sold me these products. When I used them my initial thought was that the products feel rather insubstantial, no suds, my hair didn&#x27;t feel soft when wet, and I thought it wouldn&#x27;t work. I was wrong. The static and itchy scalp completely went away, and my hair is soft and shiny. I have asked at that salon before, but the products they sold me then did not help, so I assume these products are new.&lt;br /&gt;They are expensive, but I still have plenty left after six weeks of using them every other day, so the cost is reasonable. I do not yet know how these products will be in the summer, but I know what I will be using next winter. Awesome.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t very impressed with this product. I don&#x27;t think  it lives up the hype. Not worth the money.</li>
    <li> This product works very good. I have very long hair and my ends get dry. I work it into wet hair and cover with a plastic shower cap. Than I put a very damp towel in the microwave for about 15-25 second and wrap it around the plastic cap. It is just as good as going to a salon and getting a deep conditioning treatment. In the comfort of your own home. I do it twice a week, but my hair is to my waist. Great product, you will be impressed.[[ASIN:B002CMLS7I Aveda Dry Remedy Conditioner, 6.7-Ounce Tube]]</li>
    <li> The bottle says Aveda, but this conditioner is very different from the same product bought at an Aveda Salon.  The consistency and smell are not the same and twice as much needs to be used.  I will not buy this product again as this was a huge disappointment.</li>
    <li> I have coarse hair which is also color-treated.  Drugstore conditioners just don&#x27;t do the job for my hair. I especially don&#x27;t like coating my hair with cheap conditioners full of wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Aveda Dry Remedy does a very good job and you need very little, therefore, it&#x27;s actually not more expensive in the long run since you need just a little. If you have fine hair, you can probably get by with much less product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This smooths, softens and moisturizes my hair with the buriti oil ingredient. It has a natural scent which is not obnoxious and doesn&#x27;t linger on the hair. Very effective.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got thick hair that&#x27;s not very soft or shiny...except when I use this stuff.  Dry Remedy Conditioner is not cheap but it really has a huge effect on my hair.  I leave it on for a minute or two, and my hair comes out unbelievably soft.  It feels like silk.  I don&#x27;t think that most hair products really deliver the results they promise, but this one does.  I guess that&#x27;s why Aveda is able to stay in business all these years.  I really LOVE this stuff.</li>
    <li> My sister sells Aveda products and I wasn&#x27;t interested in the products until I tried them.  I have really dry short grey hair and I am used to shampooing every day since I&#x27;ve always had oily skin. First, I tried the [[ASIN:B001H1PW9A Aveda Dry Remedy Moisturing Shampoo 200ml/6.7oz]] followed by this [[ASIN:B001H3OHXK Aveda Dry Remedy Moisturizing Conditioner - 200ml/6.7oz]] (also with &#x60;buriti oil&#x27;, which is very close to your skin&#x27;s normal oil) for normalized and healthy hair.  She recommended using this daily or less.  And, there is the [[ASIN:B001H3CUTI Aveda Dry Remedy Moisturizing Treatment Masque 8.5oz]] which you would use only every one to two weeks.  My hair is soft, shiny and healthy looking and its nice to not have to look in the mirror at work and go, &#x60;Ugh, my hair sucks&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These treatments are expensive, but you only have to use so very little, they really are worth it.  I still can&#x27;t believe I used to used any kind of store shampoo or conditioner until my hair starting getting ratty (even when short).  I suppose the lesson here is, \\&quot;less is more\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I thought this would be more nourishing and healing for my hair. It isn&#x27;t. I was disappointed. I have used this product for a few months now.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser turned me on this product. It&#x27;s great to work into your scalp after shampoo to help dry scalp.</li>
    <li> I have fine, somehat curly hair and my husband has thicker, very curly hair with a scalp that tends to be dry in the winter.  Both of us love this product.  After applying to wet/damp hair, let it soak in for a couple of minutes and then don&#x27;t rinse it out completely.  It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, it moisturizes the scalp, and it encourages a nice curl pattern and shiny hair.  A little goes a long way, so this tube lasts a long time.  Oh, and it smells delicious!</li>
    <li> Besides switching from a Kerastase leave-in to &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a 10&amp;#34; leave-in, I also switched from my Kerastase rinse-out conditioner to this one in an effort to save money on my hair care products.  This conditioner coupled with the &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a 10&amp;#34; leave-in really works on my hair.  I don&#x27;t miss my Kerastase or the Kerastase prices.  Definitely recommended!</li>
    <li> I bought this product and used a whole tube of it on my blonde dry hair over a span of about 5 weeks (used according to directions). I thought it was just an OK product; my hair still had dryness issues and I ended up buying a oil enhancing product to help with the conditioner. I would recommend this product but knowing that this didn&#x27;t cure all my hair drying issues. This product is better than the over-the-counter conditioner I was using before.</li>
    <li> Fantastic!  I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years now when I noticed my hair was breaking off when I brushed it.  I have so much less breakage now.  I use it mostly in the winter.  Very satisfied and so glad I could buy it on Amazon.  I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere close by.  I was surprised since I live in the Detroit metropolitan area.</li>
    <li> It works like a charm!!!! I&#x27;ve tried various conditioners,  while my hair remained dry and brittle.  My hair is very thick and course, so it&#x27;s hard to know which conditions are effective for my hair type. THIS STUFF WORKS!!! Even if I use it just once a week, it keeps my hair healthier and shiner. LOVE IT</li>
    <li> Living in WI, winter is very harsh on my fine hair and skin, and I desparately need something to keep my hair moisturized.  I got a sample of the Aveda Dry Remedy Moisturizing Treatment Masque and really loved it, so I bought the full size shampoo and conditioner.  The combo gets the job done, but my hair feels like it is getting weighed down.  I would suggest getting a traveler&#x27;s size to see if you like it before committing to the full size bottles.</li>
    <li> We always purchase our Aveda products from Amazon.  We love this line for hair care.  We will be purchasing more.  Thank you</li>
    <li> Recently I got a new barber. I figures, as long as I&#x27;m spending $50 on a hair cut, let me ask him about what hair products he recommends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He taught me the secret for getting rid of dry hair. Before this I never used conditioner (didn&#x27;t really understand what it is for). All you have to do though is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Wash you hair ONLY with Conditioner once a day&lt;br /&gt;2. Wash your hair with Shampoo FOLLOWED BY Conditioner every 3-4 days (twice a week).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed a change in my hair quality in less than a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little pricey but worth every penny if you want really awesome hair.</li>
    <li> Use this once or twice a week.  Let it sit in your hair while you finish your shower.  You will love how it makes your hair feel.  You can also lightly rinse your hair leaving just a little bit of this conditioner in your hair. This will help to repair your hair.  It will not leave your hair feeling greasy.  I really recommend this product for damaged hair.</li>
    <li> This product is very nice but only good for very dry hair. If you have thin or fine hair it is much too heavy/thick.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! I have long, fine hair that gets dry about half way down. In the winter, I have horrible static. Regularly using this keeps the static at bay and is one of the few I have found to work well. It keeps my hair soft without weighing it down. I use it every other day and never directly on my scalp.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner.  Unfortunately it is no longer being made, and the replacement doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
