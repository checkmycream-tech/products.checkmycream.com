      <li>After applying this on ur face, u can even feel ur skin is more moisturized , and it feel so smooth.</li>
      <li>Honestly, I don&#x27;t know how this works on fair-toned people, but the color right out of the bottle is rather</li>

      <li>I love love  this BB cream very much.</li>
      <li>The texture of the cream is extremely smooth though and easy to apply.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fabulous on your face and will make you glow with perfection.</li>
      <li>so I like the Korean brand which are made to light your skin.</li>
      <li>Therefore, I just put on some hydrating toner or oil free moisturizer/sunblock, and bb cream.</li>
      <li>I decided to try this bb cream after having huge success with Gowoonsesang&#x27;s other products (namely the super aquasis line and perfect cleansing oil).</li>
      <li>I needed to wait almost 2 hours before the BB cream matched the color of my original skin color.</li>
      <li>When this magic product goes on your face the first time it&#x27;ll look gray, don&#x27;t worry...</li>
      <li>The product came with several BB samples and I tried it&#x27;s really nice, il trying more BB product of this brand.</li>
      <li>There are many cheap bb cream alternatives ($10-$15) with decent blemish coverage and SPF protection.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s one of my favorite products ever—a classic in my beauty repertoire!</li>
      <li>one is much for mattifying, although I was told that there are better mattifying BB creams out there.  </li>
      <li>for this particular BB cream, I love it.</li>
      <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.</li>
      <li>I did, the price was way less that what she has been paying, she is happy with the product and price</li>
      <li>While it is a Korean product, I&#x27;ve seen it everywhere in the US—Amazon always has it in stock for sure, and for a pretty reasonable price.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really like using foundation because it&#x27;s streaky and hard to find the perfect match.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pricy but worth it.</li>
      <li>As a BB cream, it doesn&#x27;t have as full of coverage as a high-end foundation would (not that I expect it to), but it comes pretty darn close.</li>
      <li>The coverage of this BB cream is great (slightly less coverage than my foundation, as expected), and it&#x27;s very smooth and easy to put on.  </li>
      <li>Also, if you don&#x27;t notice right away, then take a picture.  </li>
      <li>For those of you who are still new to Korean BB creams, many of the \\&quot;popular\\&quot; brands advertised on the internet and sold at Sephora is not what many Koreans actually use.  </li>
      <li>have relatively pale Asian skin and the color is perfect for me.  </li>
      <li>When I opened the package, I was surprised to find they sent free samples of EVERY BB cream</li>
      <li>surprisingly theres an inclusive of small bottle of bb cream which they didn&#x27;t mention that it comes with</li>
      <li>problem for a whole day</li>
      <li>she said she pays too much and wanted me to see if I can get it at a lower price.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also very moisturizing.</li>
      <li>It was really soothing, but very oily.  </li>
      <li>This BB cream makes me look really ashy.  </li>
      <li>I really really like this cream.  </li>
      <li>However, with Dr G BB cream, it lasted the whole day and not oily at all.  </li>
      <li>I have light or light-to-medium skin, with a yellow undertone.</li>
      <li>So if you puttoo much, you may look pasty or ghostly.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really like using compact powder because it&#x27;s, well, powdery.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this!</li>
      <li>it feels so gentle and wont cause any skin irritation</li>
      <li>Coverage lasts a whole day, and because it&#x27;s so light, it never melts off, even in hot, dry NorCal weather.&lt;br</li>
      <li>GOOD but the color a little bit deep.</li>
      <li>However, I choose to use Dr. G&#x27;s bb cream because they use high quality ingredients.</li>
      <li>It look slightly grey on my skin, but overall it is ok.</li>
      <li>I just added a tiny bit on my nose and forehead right now and it stays on just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It completely covers all of my redness, acne, and acne scars.</li>
      <li>When I only use a pea-sized amount  over the whole face and blend my neck</li>
      <li>It makes my skin tone look completely even, and it covers up any blemishes or hyper pigmentation I have on my face.</li>
      <li>Prior to this BB cream, I had used one that cost twice as much and was touted as being one of Korea&#x27;s \\&quot;premier\\&quot; BB creams.  </li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t even have a problem with my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Go to a Korean cosmetic store and they can show you the real brands that the Koreans in Korea actually use.</li>
      <li>So I definitely get a clear line of dermacation near my jaw and neck.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;BB creams generally have ingredients that help heal/fade scarring.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Before I order this product online, I checked this product reviews, seems good to me.&lt;br /&gt;And after I got it, I knew that the reviews are real, its not oily at all, and I also love the scent like some kind of flowers. Nice coverage and keep all day long.&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t  get disappointed.</li>
    <li> I really really like this cream.  I dislike putting on foundation as it clogs the pores and leave my skin feeling oily after 2 hours.  However, with Dr G BB cream, it lasted the whole day and not oily at all.  My face looks radiant too. Excellent coverage without clogging pores and a tube can last almost a year.    With this BB cream, I will never go back to using foundation again.</li>
    <li> Ladies and dudes! Please try this product out! It&#x27;s fabulous on your face and will make you glow with perfection. When this magic product goes on your face the first time it&#x27;ll look gray, don&#x27;t worry... MIRACLES will happen! It starts to blend flawlessly into your skin tone.  Wear with or without foundation after application. Remember ladies to use toner and moisterizer.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my friend she said she pays too much and wanted me to see if I can get it at a lower price. I did, the price was way less that what she has been paying, she is happy with the product and price and I was happy I was able to help her. I know we will be ordering this item again.</li>
    <li> GOOD but the color a little bit deep. but it covers the acne well.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for the samples.&lt;br /&gt;Good!</li>
    <li> The texture of the BB cream is really nice and easily to blend with our skin. The promoter claims that this bb cream matches everyone skin after it oxidize and it cover all the imperfections such as redness, blemishes, dark circles, pores, and etc. And after i try it, it can almost covers all the imperfections on my skin which is really great !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This BB cream leave no stickiness or anything, it is absolutely looks great on your skin. It covers all your imperfections and give you a perfect looking skin. *thumbs up*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Dr. G BB cream comes with only one shade and the colour is little pale and greyish. It look slightly grey on my skin, but overall it is ok. And i guess this suits all type of skins. I personally have oily and acne prone skin. It does a great job on controlling my oily skin. I love love  this BB cream very much.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t review this...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my favourite/only bb cream I&#x27;m using (well sometimes I use perfect pore)&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just great!&lt;br /&gt;No problem for a whole day and you don&#x27;t have a &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; face when you using it.&lt;br /&gt;It might take 5minutes after you put it on to make it not so white, but after that it&#x27;s just perfect!</li>
    <li> Good coverage. Makes you appear extremely pale when first applied though. I needed to wait almost 2 hours before the BB cream matched the color of my original skin color. The texture of the cream is extremely smooth though and easy to apply. Hid all my blemishes. Word of of advice though, if you have oily skin, definitely use primer beforehand or else the cream only works for up around 4-5 hours before appearing shiny.</li>
    <li> This stuff is ah-ma-zing. As a BB cream, it doesn&#x27;t have as full of coverage as a high-end foundation would (not that I expect it to), but it comes pretty darn close. I almost never wear foundation anymore because this stuff just works so well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s like a primer, foundation, and concealer all in one—saves time and money! While it is a Korean product, I&#x27;ve seen it everywhere in the US—Amazon always has it in stock for sure, and for a pretty reasonable price. It is around $33 for the 45 mL tube (not including shipping), but it lasts so long—one tube lasted me a year and a half. Unlike foundation, where you need a couple squirts of product to blend out, you really only need a small pea-sized drop of BB cream to cover your entire face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suffering from both sensitive skin and redness, I found this product to be a lifesaver; it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, break me out, or wear out after a few hours. Coverage lasts a whole day, and because it&#x27;s so light, it never melts off, even in hot, dry NorCal weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does make me slightly oily after a few hours, but that&#x27;s nothing some oily blotting sheets or translucent powder (like the one from MUFE) can&#x27;t fix. I have tried other BB creams, both Korean and American brands, but I always come back to this one. It&#x27;s one of my favorite products ever—a classic in my beauty repertoire!</li>
    <li> Very nice BB cream. I am Asian, this BB cream lift my skin color little lighter, made my skin look brighter and healthier. I&#x27;m not into tanned skin so I like the Korean brand which are made to light your skin. The product came with several BB samples and I tried it&#x27;s really nice, il trying more BB product of this brand. It&#x27;s pricy but worth it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really glad that there is an official provider of Gowoonsesang products on Amazon. Sometimes when you buy Korean beauty products on ebay, you worry that the price is low because the products are almost expired or something. After my Dr. G bb cream from Amazon arrived in the mail, I was pleased to find that the expiration date was 2014. There are many cheap bb cream alternatives ($10-$15) with decent blemish coverage and SPF protection. However, I choose to use Dr. G&#x27;s bb cream because they use high quality ingredients. They are advertised as having a highly experienced team of doctors and dermatologists that have tested this product. I like that they have lipophilic and hydrophilic ingredients to help your skin retain moisture from both inside and outside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend bb creams to anyone with fair or medium skin tones. I&#x27;m really lazy, so I can&#x27;t be bothered to put on makeup every day. Also, I&#x27;m NOT a fan of heavy, cakey makeup. However, I have some acne and some fading acne scars, so I need some basic coverage. Therefore, I just put on some hydrating toner or oil free moisturizer/sunblock, and bb cream. I don&#x27;t really like using foundation because it&#x27;s streaky and hard to find the perfect match. I don&#x27;t really like using compact powder because it&#x27;s, well, powdery. Therefore, bb creams are the perfect solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. G bb cream has medium coverage. It completely covers all of my redness, acne, and acne scars. It won&#x27;t give as much thick, heavy coverage as foundation, though. Therefore, after a couple hours, if you&#x27;re oily/sweaty, you will have to reapply the bb cream. The texture is like a thick, creamy liquid and it&#x27;s lightly scented. It has a matte finish, but it&#x27;s also creamy and moisturizing, so it&#x27;s kind of dewy. It&#x27;s not shiny at all though. Neither is it \\&quot;powdery.\\&quot; It&#x27;s hard to explain. It&#x27;s just perfect. If you have medium skin with yellow tones, it WILL make your face look PALER. It also eliminates yellow tones. So if you puttoo much, you may look pasty or ghostly. If you are one of those Asians with white skin, it will probably blend in perfectly. I have light or light-to-medium skin, with a yellow undertone. Dr. G bb cream does make my face look whiter. However, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s too noticeable. Also, when it oxidizes it becomes darker and blends in. Many people mix their bb cream with another bb cream or foundation. I may try this, like mix one pump of Dr. G bb cream and one pump of yellowish foundation on my hand and apply. I don&#x27;t think I would recommend Dr. G bb cream to people with medium/dark skin. Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with this product. I like the finish and the coverage. However, I&#x27;m only giving it 4 stars because it can make your face look pale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BB creams generally have ingredients that help heal/fade scarring. I don&#x27;t know if the Dr. G bb cream has those ingredients though. If you know which ingredients help heal scarring, you can check the list of ingredients in Dr. G&#x27;s bb cream to see if it has any of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the list of ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;WATER, CYCLOPENTASILOXANE, GLYCERIN, TALC, PEG-10 DIMETHICONE, ETHYLHEXYL METHOXYCINNAMATE, METHICONE, DIPROPYLENE GLYCOL, ARBUTIN, ISOEICOSANE,&lt;br /&gt;TRIETHYLHEXANOIN, HEXYL LAURATE, DISTEARDIMONIUM HECTORITE, DIMETHICONE/VINYL DIMETHICONE CROSSPOLYMER, CYCLOMETHICONE, ACRYLATES/DIMETHICONE COPOLYMER, MAGNESIUM SULFATE, C12-14 PARETH-3, IRON OXIDE, PALMITIC ACID, DIMETHICONE, METHYLPARABEN, IMIDAZOLIDINYL UREA, TOCOPHERYL ACETATE, SILICA, PROPYLPARABEN, BETAINE, ALUMINUM STEARATE, ALUMINUM HYDROXIDE, SODIUM METABISULFITE, ROSMARINUS OFFICINALIS (ROSEMARY) LEAF OIL, ROSA CENTIFOLIA FLOWER WATER, PORTULACA OLERACEA EXTRACT, CITRUS GRANDIS (GRAPEFRUIT) PEEL EXTRACT, CAMELLIA SINENSIS LEAF EXTRACT, FRAGRANCE, GLYCOSYL TREHALOSE, HYDROGENATED STARCH HYDROLYSATE, TRIMETHYLSILOXY SILICATE, DIMETHICONOL/SILSESQUIOXANE COPOLYMER, BUTYLPARABEN, PROPYLENE GLYCOL, BUTYLENE GLYCOL</li>
    <li> I love this product so much, Korean cosmetic products just amazing. After applying this on ur face, u can even feel ur skin is more moisturized , and it feel so smooth. it feels so gentle and wont cause any skin irritation</li>
    <li> I bought this after my aesthetician started applying this on me after my facials.  Prior to this BB cream, I had used one that cost twice as much and was touted as being one of Korea&#x27;s \\&quot;premier\\&quot; BB creams.  Problem is that it was waaay too oily for my oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is much for mattifying, although I was told that there are better mattifying BB creams out there.  However, I chose this one because I know from experience that it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin (i.e. cause breakouts).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rated this 3 stars though because the color is rather ghastly.  Literally ghastly.  I am a darker skinned Korean so I have what I term medium skin tone.  This BB cream makes me look really ashy.  The more I put on (and sometimes I need to put on more), the ashier I look.  So I definitely get a clear line of dermacation near my jaw and neck.  Also, if you don&#x27;t notice right away, then take a picture.  You&#x27;ll definitely notice the unnatural ashiness then.  Honestly, I don&#x27;t know how this works on fair-toned people, but the color right out of the bottle is rather grayish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI, the previous BB cream that I used was the AHC brand.  It was really soothing, but very oily.  For those of you who are still new to Korean BB creams, many of the \\&quot;popular\\&quot; brands advertised on the internet and sold at Sephora is not what many Koreans actually use.  Go to a Korean cosmetic store and they can show you the real brands that the Koreans in Korea actually use.</li>
    <li> I already got my order! surprisingly theres an inclusive of small bottle of bb cream which they didn&#x27;t mention that it comes with it.&lt;br /&gt;Product wise, i&#x27;ve been using this since I got first employed 5 years ago in a tropical country of Singapore and now I&#x27;m here in Canada. Means, it goes along with any kind of weather. And it just perfectly matches with any skin type and very safe to use. I highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> I have tried &amp;Eacute;tude House, Dr. Jart, Maybelline, Holika Holika, and a couple other bb cream brands. They all left me with devastating break-outs; deep, giant zits in the nose and chin area. I decided to try this bb cream after having huge success with Gowoonsesang&#x27;s other products (namely the super aquasis line and perfect cleansing oil). LOVE IT. I have been wearing it for almost a month now and it has actually healed my acne and brightened my skin tone! My only complaint is that the color is exactly 1 shade darker than my face (I am very, very fair). When I only use a pea-sized amount  over the whole face and blend my neck well it looks perfect, though. Provides excellent cover and smells nice, too :)</li>
    <li> I will definitely order this again when I run out.  The best one so far. Good coverage and matched my skin tone. Didn&#x27;t even have a problem with my sensitive skin. I used other foundations and I break out, this one none.  Thank you</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d say if you&#x27;re looking for a good BB cream, Dr. G is the way to go. For one, their service is excellent. I received my item less than two days after ordering it on standard shipping (and I live across the country from where it shipped). When I opened the package, I was surprised to find they sent free samples of EVERY BB cream they make.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for this particular BB cream, I love it. It goes on really easily. It makes my skin tone look completely even, and it covers up any blemishes or hyper pigmentation I have on my face. The color matches me perfectly, as well (I&#x27;m a fair-skinned, Caucasian male).  I can&#x27;t speak for the long term healing effects of the cream, but if you&#x27;re looking for coverage without having that &amp;#34;I just put on make-up&amp;#34; look, this is the way to go. Will definitely recommend it to my friends!</li>
    <li> I just got this in the mail yesterday and I happily put it on this morning (around 7:30am) before going to work.  It is now almost 3pm and it&#x27;s still going strong!  I basically replaced this BB cream with my regular foundation, and put on powder and blush.  The coverage of this BB cream is great (slightly less coverage than my foundation, as expected), and it&#x27;s very smooth and easy to put on.  Usually by the middle of the day, my face gets pretty dry and anything I put on after will look cakey, unless I add another layer of moisturizer.  I just added a tiny bit on my nose and forehead right now and it stays on just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has SPF 30, which is way more than what my foundation gives me!  It will definitely be my go-to for this spring/summer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have relatively pale Asian skin and the color is perfect for me.  For those who have darker skin, you may want to make sure this is a match for you.  Or maybe this is supposed to be lighter for the &amp;#34;brightening&amp;#34; effect?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and did I mention that this comes with some great samples?</li>
    <li> just tried it this morning. no obvious change of the skin tone. Maybe it is too thin. the seller has a good attitude. it is just the product is not that good.</li>
    <li> Gives an amazing glow and you can build the coverage a bit if needed. It&#x27;s also very moisturizing. My skin has never looked so good and I have gotten many compliments since using it. I would definitely recommend to anyone!</li>
