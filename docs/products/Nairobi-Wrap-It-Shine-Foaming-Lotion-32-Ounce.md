      <li>I am so glad I can purchase it on Amazon because other than through my stylist, there are no local retailers who offer it.  </li>
      <li>I use it for its intended purpose and not only does it make my hair soft and silky, but it dries really fast.  </li>

    <li> Works wonders on my hair.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years.  It leaves my hair soft and shiny as well as easy to style.</li>
    <li> It makes the hair so soft silky and adds so much body to the hair. I can&#x27;t do hair without it!!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Straightened the hair and leaves it slick and bouncy</li>
    <li> Best wrapping lotion ever!</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best foam wrapping lotion and great price!</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  Great soft hold. Stronger and thicker consistency than the smaller products that I purchase at the local beauty supply store.</li>
    <li> That stuff is great. It makes my hair soft and silky. I use it to wrap my hair when I want to wear my hair straight and flat iron It and I also  use it after I wash my hair to make my hair curly. I have a perm but when I apply it after I wash my hair it makes my hair look as if it&#x27;s naturally curly and silky.</li>
    <li> The best stuff for natural hair.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! I have used wrap lotions for years and this is the first that truly leaves my hair shiny and soft after the hair dries.</li>
    <li> By far theeee BEST wrap product EVER!! This is my 1st purchase after seeing it used on a professional stylist&#x27;s YouTube channel. She uses it for better hold and on resistant hair. I am a natural girl and this product EXCEEDED my expectation. I  AM IN LOVE!!  The product is not offered in the stores (in my area). SO GLAD I FOUND IT ON AMAZON!! I don&#x27;t write reviews so...hope this helps!</li>
    <li> Great product. Leaves hair feeling soft and silky. No flaking. It is my favorite wrapping lotion. Good price and fast sevice.</li>
    <li> great product....will buy again. it leaves hair shine and full of body!</li>
    <li> Expensive for the bottle but works good</li>
    <li> I already love this product and I was disappointed because all the local shops charge an &amp;#34;arm &amp; a leg&amp;#34; for a small bottle, so when I thought to check online and found this at a FABULOUS price...I was ecstatic!  I placed the order and it arrived sooner than anticipated and wrapped so nice to prevent any sort of leakage in the packing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will DEFINITELY order again!!!</li>
    <li> This product is a staple in my hair products collection.  I love the value of the big bottle. This product makes my hair shiny, bouncy, and light.  Dries fast too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this foaming lotion for years and I was so happy to find it on Amazon.  It dries fast and leaves your hair soft, unlike some other foaming lotions.</li>
    <li> Love the shine, Lasting curl</li>
    <li> I was unsure about ordering this online because it wasn&#x27;t from a licensed professional, but this product came tightly sealed which made me feel really good about it being authentic. Haven&#x27;t used it to refill yet, but I&#x27;m excited I have it and the price was right on!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite wrap foam.  It leaves my hair soft and not sticky or weighted down.  Highly recommend! I have even used it once in a rush to blow dry and it was still soft.</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd purchase of Nairobi. Lays my hair down really well and not stiff after it dries. Really good product</li>
    <li> I do my own hair in between salon visits and this is a must.  It lays down neatly for wrap styles and the resulting shine is the best.  I almost don&#x27;t need to use a wrap strip. There is no dullness after a few days and the hold is great. No wonder this is what they use in my salon.  Get the giant size, save your old foam bottle and pour this goodness into that. Couldn&#x27;t find it in any beauty supplies near me so glad to have found this on Amazon.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok not like some describe it as. No flakes that&#x27;s a Lie. But overall the foam does not stay which is good. It only last about a minute or two. It does give great body to my hair.</li>
    <li> This is the only wrapping foam that works on my hair type and keeps my very short, curly hair, straight.  It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair hard, as often other foams do, nor does it give me flakes.  Great product, great smell too.</li>
    <li> The best got it fast thanks just what I ordered happy camper as usual will order again and again thanks again</li>
    <li> The best wrapping and setting lotion out there. This lotion does not flake nor itch. I highly recommend</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product.  I LOVE how the product packed as well.  I have recommended to my friends on how this product makes my hair look and feel.</li>
    <li> Works just as I expected!!!  I love it!</li>
    <li> The title says it all.  I tried no less than 30 different detangler products for my 5 year old to no true success.  The only thing that ever came close to being halfway useful was a product by bio\\&quot;  \\&quot;.  I was out of the detangler and needed something smooth and silky for my daughter after her wash and condition and tried my foam, and it worked wonders.  This needs to be repackaged as a detangler because it works awesomly well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also swear by it for my own hair.  I use it for its intended purpose and not only does it make my hair soft and silky, but it dries really fast.  I Love it and it is worth every penny.  I am so glad I can purchase it on Amazon because other than through my stylist, there are no local retailers who offer it.  I&#x27;ve heard that only professionals can purchase it through the distributor.</li>
    <li> This is the best setting lotion I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
    <li> This Wrapp is the best, my hair remained soft that is what I really liked. I will continue to use this as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
    <li> I absolutely loooove this wrap lotion!!! It leaves no residue with that gunky feel after a few days.My clients love the way it leaves the hair  soft with lots of body but still getting that really wrapped smoothness!!!!</li>
    <li> By far the best mousse that I&#x27;ve used in 20 years. I use it to mold wet hair.</li>
    <li> I believe this product is fake! It does not look or smell the same as the products I&#x27;ve received from professionl salons. Also, the lettering on the bottom is different.</li>
    <li> My Product came packaged as if someone filled it and then wrapped it back. I saw one other review on here that says they think this product is fake. I have to agree. It smells like it has a higher alcohol concentration and does not leave my hair like my normal bottle does. I don&#x27;t know who is really fulfilling this item, but I wouldn&#x27;t purchase. I guess there&#x27;s a reason it&#x27;s so cheap :(</li>
    <li> The best wrapping lotion.</li>
    <li> This product is AWESOME! Beautiful setting lotuon</li>
    <li> This is the only product that makes my hair have that salon feeling from home. Whether it&#x27;s a wet set or if you are just using this to make your hair look nice, you will not be disappointed with the results. I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 5 years and I this lotion is a must have. However if you decide to purchase the larger product make sure that you have the foam bottle as well, because you will not get the same results from a spray bottle.</li>
    <li> Have you ever grown tired of bad experiences at salons? And &amp;#34;almost there&amp;#34; results? Well, look no further! Nairobi products ensure professional results at home. I first tried the product alone without using the complete line. My results were OK, but then I purchased the entire line of products ranging from the relaxer to shampoo in the Pamper line, then used the foaming lotion to finish...OH MY GOSH, what silky, smooth, and shiny hair I had. I am never using other formulas of foam lotion/wrap lotion. Nairobi has great products that enhance and strengthen your hair from inside out. You may find yourself never having to go to another salon ever again.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t miss out on this fabulous product and awesome brand of hair care systems. See it for yourself!!!</li>
    <li> Summer is here so I&#x27;m working out more...and washng my hair more often. Those little bottles just won&#x27;t cut it!</li>
    <li> I have nice shiny bouncing curls when I set my hair with this product.  My hair is natural so Ive been wet setting my hair.</li>
    <li> My sets are very silky and curls hold longer.</li>
    <li> Love this Nairobi Wrapp-It Shine Foaming Lotion.  I use it on my natural hair and it does not flake or make my hair hard.  A great product!!</li>
    <li> The best setting lotion for black hair care, it has no alcohol and works like a gel when you are under the hair dryer. It leaves the hair molded to form but exceptionally soft.</li>
    <li> Nairobi products is one of my favorite product on the market right know the wrapp makes my hair feels smooth and light I just enjoy all there products.</li>
    <li> This is the best to ever!!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product it does not leave a film or any residue - aids in getting a clean mold everytime.</li>
    <li> Great product &amp; great service</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product again and again.  It has met my expectation.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years, so I knew what i buying. However, I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would be getting the same quality with this particular distributor. Very happy and it arrived in record time. Running low, so I will be placing another order soon.</li>
    <li> Excellent value.  Will order again.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love it! It makes my hair very soft and manageable!!! That&#x27;s a plus, coming from a person&lt;br /&gt;who hates to write reviews :)</li>
    <li> My hairdresser uses this wrap and I love how it makes my hair shine and very manageable.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff...now that I got the hang of laying my hair down. I&#x27;m really loving my short cut even more.</li>
    <li> Love this foam wrap does not flake , soft hold highly recommend . The packaging was great last time I ordered from vendor it was leaking and half of my product was spilled. Definitely will order again!</li>
    <li> Nairobi Wrapp-it Shine Foaming Lotion offers a soft hold, but plenty of body after styling.  Also, the product does not flake, which is fantastic.</li>
    <li> This is something that I&#x27;ve been using for years. Love this product.</li>
