<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My wife of more than thirty years used this when we met.  It is an unforgettable smell.  We like it a lot.  It seems to have a bit of fruitiness to it.  Smell is strongly linked to memory.  This brings back lots of good memories.</li>
    <li> The original and just what my wife wanted. excellent&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;m a hero</li>
    <li> This was purchased as a gift from me to my mother.  I don&#x27;t particularly love it,&lt;br /&gt;but she does and always has!</li>
    <li> ok so im a guy i purchased this item for my mom for xmas i took a wiff of it and frankly i didnt find it so appealing or sexy or nothing i made this purchase without even smelling it in department stores or nothing. I just went with my instincts and saw the reviews saying it was a great perfume for women and yada yada yada. If my mom opens this for xmas and takes a whiff and says she likes it ill see if i can change my review but if not i really dont reccomend this to any one and shipping took FOREVER it got here like at night one day late i was like WTF.</li>
    <li> Mom&#x27;s Favorite. and the Christmas present she loves the most, since she can use this ALL year long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it old fashioned?, depends on your point of view, brings back pleasant memories for many who smell it.  Some think it&#x27;s romantic and a classic, to others it&#x27;s a fragrance that doesn&#x27;t offend, so you can wear this without giving anyone a headache, and yes some perfumes can cause headaches in anyone around the individual who&#x27;s wearing it. I know from past experience (an Elizabeth Taylor fragrance in a purple bottle) This is a soft fragrance (White Shoulders) and is fine for day or evening.&lt;br /&gt;They don&#x27;t make them like this any more, and they definitely don&#x27;t make Mothers like mine any more either. IF my review was helpful, please click YES below, Thank you.</li>
    <li> ABSOLUTELY GREAT PRICE!!!!! I WOULD BUY IT AGAIN WHEN I RUN OUT. PERFECT FOR CHRISTMAS AND CHEAPER THAN THE STORES. I USE IT 4 TIMES A WEEK. FAST DELIVERY!! A++++</li>
    <li> I had this sent to someone who has not let me know if it arrived. I am assuming it did and that it is fine but I have no way of honestly reviewing. I gave a review saying the same thing before but I didn&#x27;t punch in any stars because nothing applies in  my situation. This time I gave the middle number of stars so that it will be done and I won&#x27;t get asked again to review.</li>
    <li> This a great value for the money.  If you are looking for a perfume that does not have an overpowering scent, this is your perfume.  I used this perfume when I was 20 and was excited to find it 39 years later.</li>
    <li> Many of todays fragrances just plain stink to me! It is rare for anything to stand out and claim to be absolutely feminine. (Calvin anyone?)&lt;br /&gt; Use sparingly girls! Just enough to make him get real close to entice him with your womanly allure.&lt;br /&gt;Flowers, elegance, sophistication that&#x27;s what I think about.  The dance! His breath on your neck, Your quickened heart. A budding flower that opens right in the palm of his hands. Been around since 1949, Right at the start of the Baby Boom! Coincidence? Try it and find out!</li>
    <li> purchased as a gift and she loves it</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift and was thrilled to find the product at this price! Usually have to spend a lot more in department stores. This was a great buy and will buy from again when need to purchase this item in the future. Thank you for the great service!</li>
    <li> I was so surprised when I saw the size of the large bottle of spray perfume. A real bargain and a scent I used when I was a teen. Very good buy.</li>
    <li> I grew up as a child loving the way my mother smelled...I remember seeing her use White Shoulders when she was going out ... I loved the way she smelled afterwards ... My Father would always buy her White Shoulders for her Birthday or Christmas as it was her favorite... Now I wear it and every time I apply it I have lovely memories of my Mother...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s an ageless classic just like she is...</li>
    <li> I purchased this for Christmas 2012 for my Mom.  This was her favorite fragrance of all time.  Well, she passed away right after Easter, so I&#x27;m the happy recipient of this gift.  Every time I spray it on, I think of her!!!</li>
    <li> She specified it and liked it....hmmmm.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for White Shoulders for a while in the department stores but it was expensive, decided to check Amazon and found it at a great price.  Delivery was quick.  Will definately buy again!</li>
    <li> I bought White Shoulders as a gift for my sister. It is the fragrance that our mother loved.  My sister was&lt;br /&gt;happy to get it and is enjoying it!</li>
    <li> When I ordered my White Shoulders For Women Set from Amazon.com I sort of wondered if it would be the real thing, with the great lowered price that I was paying.&lt;br /&gt;I was pleasantly surprised when it arrived,as it is most definitely the real thing and I have enjoyed wearing the wonderful scent that recalls days past.</li>
    <li> White Shoulders appears to be difficult to find.  Happy that I was able to buy this product from you</li>
    <li> It is worth the money.</li>
    <li> This is my mother&#x27;s favorite so I ordered it for myself.  It came early, just as promised.  I don&#x27;t know why people don&#x27;t think they can smell the product, it is lovely and lasts. Now its time for me to order one for mom!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000P276AK White Shoulders By Evyan For Women. Set-eau De Cologne Spray 4.5 oz &amp; Body Lotion 3.3 oz &amp; Parfum .25 oz Mini]]</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying White Shoulders for my wife now for about 27 years.  In stores I&#x27;ve frequently paid double what I paid for this package, yet this one is the same quality, fragrance, and size.  You also get a couple of extras, which is very appealing icing on the cake.  No need for me to take the time or effort to brave the mall at Christmas, because it came right to my door!  What a deal.  Shipped fast and free, and my wife loves it.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift.  I was cautious because of the great price but thought that I&#x27;d give it a try.  It&#x27;s the same product as you&#x27;d get at a department store.  Save yourself some money and get this from this vendor!</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift for a sweet cousin. She loved it. She is a White Shoulders woman and this was perfect for her.</li>
    <li> I have always loved this scent but this is the first time I have ever purchased it.  Was pleased I did.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with purchase.  Exactly as advertised.</li>
    <li> This has been my favorite since I was in my 20&#x27;s.  It just seemed to not be available for a long time and then the prices were very high.  This set is for me and has everything I like.  The smell is flowery with a hint of Jasmine.  I especially like the body lotion , as the scent lasts all day.  The box was well packaged and no damage. The price is amazing, I will buy again!!</li>
    <li> The set came quickly, really smells good, great for gift giving or personal use, my Grand daughter wanted the small bottle and my daughter wanted the lotion, highly recommend this Cologne set, beautiful box!!!</li>
    <li> I ADORE this cologne and was thrilled with my purchase of the cologne, body lotion and parfum (perfume). Service great, fast delivery, I can&#x27;t find this anymore in the better department stores so I was thrilled.</li>
    <li> Have been purchasing White Shoulders for my wife for the last 40 plus years as it is my most favorite fragrance she wears . The price on this set cannot be better as I have looked locally and just the cologne in this set is usually priced higher then the price of this whole set.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance and order it online as you can not find it easily in stores anymore. I&#x27;ve worn it for year.s</li>
    <li> I used to buy this for my wife in the 1960&#x27;s, so I bought this as a nostalgic, romantic gift.  She likes it!</li>
    <li> Although, this is an old fragrance I still love it and it is the original designer fragrance. I am glad I found it and thanks Amazon.</li>
    <li> The scent is a light fragrance and stays with you, I&#x27;ve been using it for 10 years and love it for a special occasion yet great for everyday use.</li>
    <li> Have always loved this scent.  The lotion makes it easy to layer your scent and the small size is great for purse or travel.</li>
    <li> I got my first bottle of real perfume from my dad, who was on a consulting job back east.  It was the first time in my life that my dad had been away for more than a few days.  One day a package arrived from him.  In it were four bottles of perfume:  White Shoulders, Chantilly, Shalimar and Chanel No. 5.  My mom, my two sisters and I all reached out our hands for one, and we each picked up the one we wanted!  There was no conflict at all.  Somehow my dad knew just what we each would like.  I was about 16, and I&#x27;ve been wearing White Shoulders ever since (I&#x27;m 61 now).  The scent is delicate and lovely, and I&#x27;ve received many compliments.  I&#x27;ve got my lifetime perfume, and I love it!  I was very pleased when I saw this offer.  The price was incredibly reasonable, and the sizes very generous.  If you love White Shoulders, you should purchase from this seller.  I highly recommend this perfume, cologne and lotion.</li>
    <li> I received some of this for Christmas many years ago and I hated it.  It has a sickeningly sweet smell that I don&#x27;t care for.  I&#x27;m obviously in the minority with the reviews but that&#x27;s what this is all about - opinions and everybody has one!</li>
    <li> I was really disappointed when I got this scent.  Was looking for everyday, wear to work scent, but this definitely miss the mark.  It even seemed old like it was in storage for along time.  Would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> White Shoulders has been around a long time, but I still prefer the scent over newer perfumes.  It&#x27;s also makes a great gift!</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;White Shoulders&amp;#34; has been MY fragrance for more than 40 years. Back then, I could purchase the bath oil and shower gel in this fragrance, as well. The floral scent was so appealing--and lasting.  The quality over the years has significantly decreased--as with so many products these days.  The scent doesn&#x27;t last at all.  What a disappointment.  Will I still wear it? Shamefully, yes, I will, until I can find another fragrance so appealing to me.</li>
    <li> Gave as a present.  Haven&#x27;t heard anything from her.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using White Shoulders for over 40 years and have loved it since I was a little girl and my mother used it, It&#x27;s the only fragrance that I wear.  I&#x27;ve ordered this gift set before, a couple years ago and gave it 5 stars previously. Ordered this same gift box again in January 2017 and it&#x27;s horrible! It doesn&#x27;t smell anything like the perfume I&#x27;ve always used and loved. The cologne has an odd smell, it&#x27;s hard to describe, and the little perfume is cloudy and doesn&#x27;t smell anything like WS at all, either.  I don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;ve changed the formula, or what I received this time is a counterfeit knockoff, but won&#x27;t order this again. I will buy it in person from now on so I can smell it and make sure it&#x27;s the original, lovely, feminine fragrance that I&#x27;ve used and loved for so many years. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> just love white shoulders.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for a friend of mine on her birthday, she absolutely loved it.  It was received in a timely manner, wrapped so not to break it and thanks for getting it out so quickly.  The price was the best I had come across.</li>
    <li> Love it! Thank-You :-)</li>
    <li> This is one of my mother&#x27;s favorite fragrances.</li>
    <li> a bargain for an old favorite</li>
    <li> I wore this scent all through high school, pretty exclusively.  I decided to give it another try 40+ years later and it still smells the same.  LOVE it!</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed in the scent of the White Shoulders I ordered. Many years ago (over 40) I received White Shoulders cologne as a gift. It smelled wonderful and the scent lasted for hours. I opened this White Shoulders cologne spray and used it on neck and arms...it barely had a smell at all! It was a surprise-and not a good one. It seems a faint imitation of a once gorgeous memory. The company making White Shoulders should be ashamed!</li>
    <li> This is a classic perfume.  I believe that White Shoulders is one of the first fragrances produced by Evyan of New York City in 1945. It is a classic floral perfume.  I sprayed this perfume on myself many years ago and I was hooked with its rich smell and I discovered that the fragrance lasted all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was nervous about purchasing it again since Evyan was sold to Elizabeth Arden and I had used up all my \\&quot;Evyan originals.\\&quot;  So I took a chance and bought it through Amazon.  How pleased I was when I discovered that the formula was not changed and bought it at a great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an incredible fragrance and  I always get compliments when I wear it. No, it is not an \\&quot;Old Ladies\\&quot; perfume ANYONE can wear this fragrance.</li>
    <li> This has been my favorite since I was a child. I remember when you could only find this in department stores. I rarely bought it for myself so it was my favorite Christmas and birthday gift! Now that I am able to find it here I&#x27;m never without. I love the floral scent, sometimes I&#x27;ll even give myself a tiny spritz before going to bed. The floral blend of gardenia, lilac, amber, oakmoss, and jasmine smells wonderful. I love it! :)</li>
    <li> Wahoooooo. My wife loves White Shoulders! I love my wife...it all works out.</li>
    <li> Best gift for my Mom. I have been buying the fragrance for her since I was a little boy, so this will be a treat!</li>
    <li> What a GREAT purchase!  I first received White Shoulders as a gift in High School.  I&#x27;ve always loved it, but it was a bit pricey.  When I saw this set on Amazon, I knew I had to have it.  I&#x27;m adding it to my list of things to buy my nieces for Christmas.</li>
    <li> gift was received by the party earlier than expected.  Receipant was delighted with the gift set and says she will wear it forever.</li>
    <li> My mom has always loved this perfume! I was glad to be able to find it, and at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I referred this set to a friend &amp; she bought it &amp; loved it. I wonder why there was one bottle for about $25. I know the co. was sold.&lt;br /&gt;The price was great!</li>
    <li> This cologne many years ago was the best- A smell that will bring back memories. Just a pleasant smell that does not announce you before you get there. It was a gift that I always gave from time to time. Those years have passed, but still today just smelling this cologne will take you back to these memories. I searched locally and no one carried this anymore---so I looked for it on Amazon and to my surprise they had it ready to sell. So once again I give it as a gift.</li>
    <li> I am always satisfied with my purchase  thank you</li>
    <li> This gift boxed set for White Shoulders was delivered on time and was no small package! It is the authentic perfume and not some knock-off!  I purchased this set for my mother because it was a fragrance that I remembered her wearing when I was young and just opening the box and getting the first whiff brought back memories.  This is a very nice sized gift set and it will be appreciated by anyone who also enjoys White Shoulders perfume</li>
    <li> Purchased for my Mom.....it&#x27;s her favorite perfume.  She is extremely happy with it.</li>
    <li> This is the only cologne I use.  I have issues with a number of smells, but this one is just right for me.  I find that it is mild, but pleasing.  I even keep a bottle of the cologne in my laundry room.  I put some on a blouse or even my pajamas, then turn the dryer on for a few minutes.  Even at the end of the day or night there is a pleasant smell to my clothing.</li>
    <li> This is my moms favorite perfume, she has worn it for 50 years.  It has become hard to find in stores. I got I this as her Christmas gift and the price was great and I received it in no time like 2 days.</li>
    <li> i love the smell of this. its so soft and so lovely. its hard to describe but it&#x27;s the type of smell you can remember, a smell you can just rest in. it reminds you of a soft and comforting woman or a warm quilt when its cold outside.</li>
    <li> This was bought as a gift for my mother who loves White Shoulders; we can&#x27;t find it anywhere in stores anymore! This is a great gift set and very good value, too. Back when it could be found in stores, it was double this price for this gift set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Came quickly and packaging was undamaged.</li>
    <li> White Shoulders is all I have used for years. Usually spend big bucks in the local department stores. This is a great buy and where I will come looking next time and when I am looking for a great gift too!</li>
    <li> Love this perfume. The only one I use. Have used this product for many years. Wonderful smell. Not overbearing like some perfumes are.</li>
    <li> Long time favorite that is still in vogue.</li>
    <li> My mother loves this perfume. It is getting a little harder to find so I bought it for her for Mothers Day</li>
    <li> Wife loves this product, but it is hard to find locally. Happy to find it at a good price too.</li>
    <li> She keep it and used it!</li>
    <li> It was a gift and the person told me that she liked it!</li>
    <li> very pleasant if you like soft, feminine scents like Dior or Gucci. It is a subtle scent suitable for day or evening wear and for any season.</li>
    <li> This was bought as a gift.  The recipient loved it and has recommended to me.  I would definitely buy this again and do business with you.  Shipping was quick, on time and packaged well.  Everything that was promised was delivered.</li>
    <li> Loved this many years ago and still do.  Just doesn&#x27;t seem to last that long after putting it on.  I use the spray cologne and a dab of the perfume and I never hear \\&quot;Oh, what is that you&#x27;re wearing?\\&quot;  But I wear it for me so as long as I like how the fragrance is on me, I continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I bought this product as a gift for my Mother. This is one of her favorite Colognes. She was very happy with this gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t hesitate to purchase it!</li>
    <li> Standard purchase for wife</li>
    <li> Perfect gift set for my Mom. Not too strong and smells nice.</li>
    <li> OLD smelling. ...when I received it the  fragrance was off..like it was starting to go bad. I didn&#x27;t get the normal compliments that I usually got. Some said that it was really awful. That was back in May and June. Since then I stopped wearing it.  I decided to try it again 2 weeks ago , more bad reactions.</li>
    <li> Arrived perfectly~ thx!</li>
    <li> Wife loves this stuff as her grandma use to wear and I bought it for her to remember her grandma by.  The product was brand new and the pricing was great compared to other prices I saw for this.....quick shipment as well</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the only perfume, cologne I can wear that my husband likes &amp; my allergies don&#x27;t bother me. I love it &amp; have been wearing it for years. Also the price was excellent! Hope it stays that way.</li>
    <li> My wife used this cologne when we got married a long time ago.&lt;br /&gt;Whenever she is about to run out I replenish it for her. It is much&lt;br /&gt;less expensive at Amazon then at some retail stores (that is if you&lt;br /&gt;can find it).</li>
    <li> Cologne Spray arrived quickly, packaged well, and as advertised.  We bought this as a gift and our gift receiver loved it.</li>
    <li> This set is a very good price. I&#x27;ve always loved the smell of White Shoulders, so when I saw this product I had to buy it.</li>
    <li> What can I say My wife love White Shoulders, I love to smell it . She loves to get perfume.  WIN WIN</li>
