      <li>Stuff works great!  </li>
      <li>Your best bet if your like me who has no job and a nerve showing in a tooth which you can tell by the throbbing pain.</li>
      <li>The best thing I recommend is to follow directions.</li>
      <li>Great inexpensive fix when you can&#x27;t get to the dentist</li>
      <li>This is a great product.  </li>
      <li>Here is the good stuff -&gt;</li>
      <li>The Jerks probably won&#x27;t restock the good stuff because they would haft to do some work.    </li>
      <li>I always look for this brand since it lasts for a good amount of time when used as directed.</li>
      <li>I am very pleased with Amazon and the preferred market system.  </li>
      <li>that&lt;br /&gt;I am now dealing with at my own pain/</li>
      <li>It is stickier, bonds to the tooth better and lasts longer.</li>
      <li>I tried to use this stuff, but it never lasted more than one meal.</li>
      <li>Since it recommends waiting 3-4 hours prior to eating for best results, Goto bed after you put it in your mouth.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is okay.</li>
      <li>So its a pretty good product.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s available at most stores.</li>
      <li>the bonding power of this product is like as strong as epoxy...</li>
      <li>When I went to the dentist to have a new crown fitted after the holidays, he said that the product wouldn&#x27;t impair his repair in any way and that the Dentek looked as good as any temporary bonding he would&#x27;ve put on the tooth himself.  </li>
      <li>The description makes it sound like</li>
      <li>Clean your teeth and use the dentek as indicated on the directions.  </li>
      <li>but I honestly have no complaints so far.</li>
      <li>I was so looking forward to this to be a quick fix until I can see a dentist in a month or so.</li>
      <li>I ordered this product which was delivered quickly.  </li>
      <li>This one hardens quickly and stays on the tooth for 2 to 3 days.</li>
      <li>At most get a good night sleep which is usually 5-6 hours.</li>
      <li>Try this first!</li>
      <li>It is really useful temporarily.</li>
      <li>I tried pain killers, Oragel, clove oil, etc with varying success.</li>
      <li>and/or right before you goto bed.</li>
      <li>I have it in right now</li>
      <li>I received my purchase right away, packaging was expert</li>
      <li>While that&#x27;s nice, it can be a long, long&lt;br</li>
      <li>Just as described &amp; fast shipping!</li>
      <li>The PURPLE tub does a pretty decent&lt;br /&gt;job of keeping air and food out of the openings.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>I have read reviews that this problem only exist with Temparin MAX (The purple one), so the others might work differently or better.</li>
      <li>At first i had a tooth.</li>
      <li>Too many products have pretty words and fall flat, but DenTek does exactly what it says and with ease..</li>
      <li>Yes, it is only temporary, VERY temporary, but it works a lot better than its competitors.</li>
      <li>Only the DenTek Temparin in the Light Baby Blue/Cyan colored container is worth buying.  </li>
      <li>It won&#x27;t stay in a large area very well.</li>
      <li>, let it warm up between your fingers, roll it a little</li>
      <li>/&gt;Still, a much needed product.</li>
      <li>Very temporary product.</li>
      <li>(A really rotten dentist did a lot of damage</li>
      <li>This product really is temporary as it states.</li>
      <li>The only reason I&#x27;m giving this a one out of five rating is because that is the smallest rating available.</li>
      <li>I have no dental insurance and really don&#x27;t want to go into a major dental procedure right now</li>
      <li>This particular brand works much better than the other two brand names I&#x27;ve tried for temporary fillings.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 19 weeks pregnant and had a wisdom tooth that is cracked to start giving me a lot of pain several weeks ago.</li>
      <li>it is a decent filler.</li>
      <li>totally doesn&#x27;t worth the money</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about buying the product at first because I have read all of the negative reviews</li>
      <li>Good for filling cavities or in my case a broken tooth until I could get to the dentist to have it pulled.</li>
      <li>Works ok, doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
      <li>I used Dentek for the first time last night and so far it is working very well.</li>
      <li>and this did not relieve any pain or live up to it&#x27;s promise.</li>
      <li>And you cannot get it at Walgreens or many other places, only can get the purple colored garbage.    </li>
      <li>It dries to a chalk like hardness and breaks apart while eating even soft foods.</li>
      <li>It stayed soft and kept falling out.</li>
      <li>I would not expect it to last more than a few days.</li>
      <li>Sometimes I get a mild ache, nothing a little Advil can&#x27;t solve.</li>
      <li>It was on the bottom row, right side, 2nd to last tooth which is a big tooth.</li>

<li> They don&#x27;t last as long.</li>
<li> /&gt;This has helped me keep air out of sensitive areas, and given a little extra strength to&lt;br /&gt;a cracked tooth.</li>
<li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had a few old amalgam fillings fall out.</li>
<li> Dentek lasted as long as what the doctor used as a filling after my root canal.  </li>
<li> It lasted as long as a temporary filling from my root canal.  </li>
<li> I only put it in last night, but half of it is already gone.</li>
<li> I also limited chewing with the repaired tooth as much as possible and it lasted longer than I expected.  </li>
<li> Calling the dentist got pushed back a couple weeks due to work.</li>
<li> This is only going to result in chalk in your mouth and down your throat and anywhere else</li>
<li> I am actually able to bite down and touch my tooth without any stabbing nerve pain</li>
<li> dental insurance and can&#x27;t work outside the home anymore leaves little for&lt;br</li>
<li> Though it did not come out, it rubbed away like wet chalk.</li>
<li> The paste in the tube is slightly harder than play dough in texture.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve grown to not much care for the taste (like chalk),&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t get Dentem or any other one.</li>
<li> b/c i don&#x27;t work anymore due to a care wreck.</li>
<li> The other suggestion is to put it in after you eat</li>
<li> The Lidocaine stuff didn&#x27;t help at all, but jamming a big gob of this stuff into my broken tooth provided immediate and lasting relief.  </li>
<li> It was easy to apply and while it does taste like chalk slightly it isn&#x27;t that bad.</li>
<li> Not sure how long the filling will stay in since it is meant to be temporary, but it has worked overnight</li>
<li> When i bite down on the side i can tell something is in my tooth which i don&#x27;t like.</li>
<li> Some foods and drinks taste odd.</li>
<li> It takes a little patience to fill and shape the filling, but it does serve its purpose.</li>
<li> Its hurts a little bit.</li>
<li> I keep having little pieces break off and just float around my mouth.</li>
<li> I can always tell when food causes little pieces to break off - it&lt;</li>
<li> I was hoping it would have lasted longer than a few weeks, but there is plenty of fill in the little jar to keep me going until I can see a dentist.</li>
<li> For the price and for the effort of filling that painful hole, it is worth it.</li>
<li> Is totally a waste of money.</li>
<li> Actually made my toothache worse.</li>
<li> I have a few cracked fillings I thouth</li>
<li> Waste of money.</li>
<li> DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY.    </li>
<li> and he is unable to have it fixed while hes there.</li>
<li> Dentek Temparin is it -- you&#x27;ll waste your money on the others.</li>
<li> Had to refill the small area where I&#x27;d lost my filling every day once or twice, but it worked and kept things under control until I could get to the dentist for permanent repair.</li>

    <li> This stuff is AWESOME!  When my crown broke off during the holidays, exposing a nerve, I ran to the pharmacy and bought every toothache remedy they had.  The Lidocaine stuff didn&#x27;t help at all, but jamming a big gob of this stuff into my broken tooth provided immediate and lasting relief.  When I went to the dentist to have a new crown fitted after the holidays, he said that the product wouldn&#x27;t impair his repair in any way and that the Dentek looked as good as any temporary bonding he would&#x27;ve put on the tooth himself.  I thank God for Dentek, because I probably would&#x27;ve ended up getting root therapy in the emergency room without it.</li>
    <li> I have used this stuff before. I have it in right now b/c i don&#x27;t work anymore due to a care wreck. This stuff is okay. At first i had a tooth. It was on the bottom row, right side, 2nd to last tooth which is a big tooth. When i bite down on the side i can tell something is in my tooth which i don&#x27;t like. Its hurts a little bit. I keep having little pieces break off and just float around my mouth. I can tell you this that i have lost some taste in food using this product. Some foods and drinks taste odd. Your best bet if your like me who has no job and a nerve showing in a tooth which you can tell by the throbbing pain. Take some meds until you have no pain then put this stuff in. After that try and fall asleep. Its best to do this before bed so it can harden. Usually 2-3 hours at least. At most get a good night sleep which is usually 5-6 hours. Just keep applying it when it breaks. I bought mine from Wal-Mart for $3 after tax. So its a pretty good product. Don&#x27;t get Dentem or any other one. They don&#x27;t last as long.</li>
    <li> I tried to use this stuff, but it never lasted more than one meal. It dries to a chalk like hardness and breaks apart while eating even soft foods. The only reason I&#x27;m giving this a one out of five rating is because that is the smallest rating available.</li>
    <li> i bought this product for my fiance who is deployed because his filling fell out and he is unable to have it fixed while hes there. he followed the instructions to the t and the temp filling fell out that same day. i&#x27;m disappointed. i know its only a temp but i was hoping it would last longer than that.</li>
    <li> Yes, it is only temporary, VERY temporary, but it works a lot better than its competitors. It is stickier, bonds to the tooth better and lasts longer. Try this first!</li>
    <li> i put it on for not even one day, and it fall off. Besides, i couldn&#x27;t take off all the fillings from my tooth! totally doesn&#x27;t worth the money</li>
    <li> The description makes it sound like the bonding power of this product is like as strong as epoxy...Then use epoxy. LOL.&lt;br /&gt;IT JUST DOESN&#x27;T HOLD.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I&#x27;ve needed this product for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;No dental insurance and can&#x27;t work outside the home anymore leaves little for&lt;br /&gt;very expensive dental work. (A really rotten dentist did a lot of damage that&lt;br /&gt;I am now dealing with at my own pain/expense.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had a few old amalgam fillings fall out. The PURPLE tub does a pretty decent&lt;br /&gt;job of keeping air and food out of the openings.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is a VERY small piece of stuff, like you extruded playdoh. You take off a small&lt;br /&gt;piece, let it warm up between your fingers, roll it a little so it will conform, and push&lt;br /&gt;it into the opening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has helped me keep air out of sensitive areas, and given a little extra strength to&lt;br /&gt;a cracked tooth. It won&#x27;t stay in a large area very well. (They assume you are only using&lt;br /&gt;their product until you can get to the dentist. While that&#x27;s nice, it can be a long, long&lt;br /&gt;time before some of us can get help.) I&#x27;ve grown to not much care for the taste (like chalk),&lt;br /&gt;but I can deal with it. I can always tell when food causes little pieces to break off - it&lt;br /&gt;feels like a piece of chalk (literally) is inside my mouth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, a much needed product. Don&#x27;t bother bringing home the blue tub - that stuff only holds&lt;br /&gt;enough to get you to a dentist, maybe overnight. This one, the PURPLE tub, is the only one&lt;br /&gt;to get.</li>
    <li> It does fill the hole in my tooth and it helps to ease the pain of the exposed nerve. It takes a little patience to fill and shape the filling, but it does serve its purpose. It is definitely a temporary fix. I was hoping it would have lasted longer than a few weeks, but there is plenty of fill in the little jar to keep me going until I can see a dentist. For the price and for the effort of filling that painful hole, it is worth it.</li>
    <li> Just as described &amp; fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Had to refill the small area where I&#x27;d lost my filling every day once or twice, but it worked and kept things under control until I could get to the dentist for permanent repair.</li>
    <li> This particular brand works much better than the other two brand names I&#x27;ve tried for temporary fillings. This one hardens quickly and stays on the tooth for 2 to 3 days. The other two were worthless -- didn&#x27;t harden properly and stayed on the tooth for less than 24 hours.  Dentek Temparin is it -- you&#x27;ll waste your money on the others.</li>
    <li> I have not used this product yet.  I am basing my review on what others have said - here on Amazon and in my personal life.  I bought this product for stock.  When my husband retired we lost our dental insurance.  I do not want to lose a filling over a weekend when I can&#x27;t get to a dentist and have to suffer through the pain.  I&#x27;m counting on this product helping me and from what I&#x27;ve heard, it should.  I am very pleased with Amazon and the preferred market system.  I received my purchase right away, packaging was expert and I have nothing bad to say about this purchase.</li>
    <li> This did not work for me. It stayed soft and kept falling out. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Very temporary product.</li>
    <li> This product really is temporary as it states. I had piece of my filling come out. Being an International student here in the us and with the cost of dentist I decided to take a cheaper alternative. The paste in the tube is slightly harder than play dough in texture. Simply roll it in a ball as directed and insert in the desired tooth. Its actually that simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I placed mine in one night before bed with the expectation of a hard, set filling in the morning. The next morning I rubbed the end of my toothbrush on it to test. Though it did not come out, it rubbed away like wet chalk. I only put it in last night, but half of it is already gone. I would not expect it to last more than a few days. I have read reviews that this problem only exist with Temparin MAX (The purple one), so the others might work differently or better.</li>
    <li> I used Dentek for the first time last night and so far it is working very well. I wasn&#x27;t sure about buying the product at first because I have read all of the negative reviews but I honestly have no complaints so far. I&#x27;m 19 weeks pregnant and had a wisdom tooth that is cracked to start giving me a lot of pain several weeks ago. I have no dental insurance and really don&#x27;t want to go into a major dental procedure right now so I decided to give Dentek a try. It was easy to apply and while it does taste like chalk slightly it isn&#x27;t that bad. I&#x27;m still having a lot of nausea with my pregnancy so I would mention it if it tasted that horrible lol! I am actually able to bite down and touch my tooth without any stabbing nerve pain so it is working. Not sure how long the filling will stay in since it is meant to be temporary, but it has worked overnight and I&#x27;ve already eaten this morning without any problems. Not having any issues with it chipping off either. Great inexpensive fix when you can&#x27;t get to the dentist and it&#x27;s available at most stores.</li>
    <li> I have a few cracked fillings I thouth this was going to help me seal it temporarily but this thing dont even last 5 minutes with out melting dont know why these companies are in business with fake product like this save your money dont buy</li>
    <li> This stuff falls out/dissolves almost immediately. Is totally a waste of money. Someone needs to make a tooth filling material that works. Doesn&#x27;t seem like rocket science.</li>
    <li> Had a chipped tooth that needed immediate attention.  Dentists were booked, so had to go with this on the meantime...  Filling kept falling out</li>
    <li> We both have cavities and one of our teeth and this did not relieve any pain or live up to it&#x27;s promise. I was so looking forward to this to be a quick fix until I can see a dentist in a month or so. Very disappointed, don&#x27;t waste your money, might as well go to dentist and get a filling.....pop some bc powder until you do.......hope this helps.....</li>
    <li> I ordered this product which was delivered quickly.  I cannot rate the product itself as I haven&#x27;t used it yet...not until I have a problem with my problem tooth.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  It lasted as long as a temporary filling from my root canal.  My temp fell out before I got a cap installed.  Dentek lasted as long as what the doctor used as a filling after my root canal.  Stuff works great!  The best thing I recommend is to follow directions. If you don&#x27;t, more than likely, this is why the stuff fails.  The other suggestion is to put it in after you eat and/or right before you goto bed. Clean your teeth and use the dentek as indicated on the directions.  Since it recommends waiting 3-4 hours prior to eating for best results, Goto bed after you put it in your mouth.  I&#x27;ve done this both times I&#x27;ve used it.  Dentek is rock hard when you awake.  The only downside is it tastes a lil chalky while it dries.  I also limited chewing with the repaired tooth as much as possible and it lasted longer than I expected.  Calling the dentist got pushed back a couple weeks due to work. The stuff lasted till I got my appointment.  I&#x27;ll definitely use it again if needed.</li>
    <li> Good for filling cavities or in my case a broken tooth until I could get to the dentist to have it pulled.</li>
    <li> it is a decent filler. I always look for this brand since it lasts for a good amount of time when used as directed.</li>
    <li> I choose this product because it delivers on its advertisement.  Too many products have pretty words and fall flat, but DenTek does exactly what it says and with ease..</li>
    <li> Not an end-all solution, but definately helped me get some sleep and buy time until I could see a dentist.</li>
    <li> DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY.    IT SHOULD BE ILLEGAL TO SALE SUCH A WORTHLESS PRODUCT.    Only the DenTek Temparin in the Light Baby Blue/Cyan colored container is worth buying.  Here is the good stuff -&gt; [...]    And you cannot get it at Walgreens or many other places, only can get the purple colored garbage.    The Jerks probably won&#x27;t restock the good stuff because they would haft to do some work.    Stupid corporate people sit around tables and make blind ignorant decisions about what products to push off on  people. The store clerk and managers just plop onto the shelf&#x27;s what arrives in the trucks.    Don&#x27;t be like a dumb cow, don&#x27;t buy this crap !</li>
    <li> It will be almost nothing left on my teeth after one day. Wish it will not be bad to my stomach. It is really useful temporarily.</li>
    <li> Works ok, doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
    <li> This is junk. Lasts all of thirty minutes and falls out.... save yourself the time and effort and just go to the dentist or deal with the pain or situation of a lost filling or whatever. This is only going to result in chalk in your mouth and down your throat and anywhere else but the filling you&#x27;re trying to cover.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. Actually made my toothache worse.</li>
    <li> Got a broken wisdom tooth and the pain was unbearable. It happened on the weekend when I couldn&#x27;t see the dentist. I tried pain killers, Oragel, clove oil, etc with varying success. Shoved some Temparin in the tooth and soon the pain was almost entirely gone. It creates a seal to keep out air and food which irritate the nerve and cause pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three days later the Temparin is still holding. I&#x27;m waiting for my dental appointment. I&#x27;ve been avoiding chewing food with that side of my mouth, so that might explain why the Temparin is still in place. Sometimes I get a mild ache, nothing a little Advil can&#x27;t solve. Compared to the pain I had before, this stuff is a miracle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: the Temparin held for over 1 week! Got the tooth pulled, I&#x27;m saving the rest of this stuff for future emergencies.</li>
