    <li> A little awkward but it does the job and keeps me from making a mess and having to re-do my mascara over because I have such fine blond eyelashes they are hard to put the mascara on without getting it where it isn&#x27;t suppose to be.</li>
    <li> This is very awkward apparatus. Could not comfortably fit it onto my face and my eyes. Overall just awkward application</li>
    <li> just don&#x27;t need it, makes for more work</li>
    <li> Shape of product hard to accommodate different eye shapes.  Was hard to apply the mascara.</li>
    <li> Its works but its hurts lol  but all in all its highly recommended</li>
    <li> I got it for my lower lashes it worked fine. Also came 3 weeks early</li>
    <li> I use this also to hold my lashes down to help me line my eyes too.</li>
    <li> I did not find this useable.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Great little gadget. After doing one eye be sure to clean it with a tissue before doing the other eye.</li>
    <li> The item works but the packaging is not in English. I had to figure it out by I got it.I have only used it for the lower eye lashes and it keeps my from making a mascara mess.</li>
    <li> I always have difficulty applying mascara to my lower Asian eyelids without getting it on my skin. Pretty useful tool if you have the same issues. I do use it occasionally for my upper lids as well. Easy to use and good to have!</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t what to use it for my date out.</li>
    <li> A total pain in the butt to use, and kind of awkward..... There is defiantly a learning curve to using.&lt;br /&gt;It just seemed like the applicator got in the way (felt bulky) and working around it was more work then just applying the mascara..... I think this is going to be personal preference, I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s a one star product, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a five star either.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t spend a lot of money on this, so I&#x27;m not going to bother returning.&lt;br /&gt;I just see this is just something that takes up space in my make-up bag. Sorry</li>
    <li> If you have thinning lashes this is the product for you.  Wonderful, love it!</li>
    <li> While cheaply made, it looks like it will do the job of keeping mascara on the eyelids and off the eyelids. on use, I&#x27;ll likely never use it again.</li>
    <li> This is great for the price. It took forever to get delivered, but that was alright for 2 dollars. The combs are a little rough if not careful.</li>
    <li> No really what i thought it was going to be. It was very uncomfortable to hold on my eye while i put on my mascara and still if i did big strokes mascara would get on my eye.</li>
