      <li>I have had issues with the lightest colors (white/platinum) not always showing up on me but that is when I put them on with some of the loose powders I bought from Shany (which I ABSOLUTELY LOVE! )</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t have any issues with tugging or pulling; these apply really well, feel silky smooth and are very pigmented too.</li>
      <li>Items came in super fast, I waited about 4 days</li>
      <li>well when first put on then they stay put.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am IN LOVE with these pencils and will definitely tell my friends about this.</li>

      <li>I was able to replace my more expensive eyeshadows and eyeliners with this one set, which takes up a lot less space in my bathroom (I know my fianc&amp;eacute; is happy about that).</li>
      <li>They they compete very well with the higher end brands.  </li>
      <li>, you can get an idea for the colors but some of the eye shadow sticks have a really pretty shimmer that you can&#x27;t really see in the pictures either.</li>
      <li>Way better than expected.</li>
      <li>You get a lot  of colors for such a cheap price.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I ordered these eyeshadow pencils because I saw how cheap it was for 30 colors! When I received them I immediately tried them out. When I opened the box the pencils were in, I noticed there were also lip pencils! Awesome bonus. These pencils are extremely affordable and long lasting. The Colors are so vibrant and there are such a variety of colors. They are very easy to apply and blend which is very nice! They box they came in is so pretty and organizable. The lip pencils are such beautiful colors and stay on FOREVER. I have never had such a good lipstick. All of the pencils are extremely hydrating without being oily. The only thing I would change is how the pencils were placed in the box. The lip and Eyeshadow pencils should be separated but they are all kind of mixed together but thats nothing you can&#x27;t fix at home. I am IN LOVE with these pencils and will definitely tell my friends about this.</li>
    <li> I like this set a lot! There are so many useful colors for your eyes and lips and they apply so smoothly. You can definitely get creative with a set like this and I’m sure you can use some of the lovely pinks on your cheeks as well; they are so creamy they will blend nicely. I’ve used these great chunky sticks so far on my lips and eyes. I didn&#x27;t have any issues with tugging or pulling; these apply really well, feel silky smooth and are very pigmented too. I added some pictures with swatches of all the colors on my arm but it really doesn&#x27;t do them justice, you can get an idea for the colors but some of the eye shadow sticks have a really pretty shimmer that you can&#x27;t really see in the pictures either. A sample was given to me in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> These pencils work great for me as my eyes are SUPER sensitive to makeup. They are hypoallergenic and I find to be very moisutrizing. The sweat resistant formula really works too. I normally do my makeup in the mid AM, and my eyes still look great by 5! I&#x27;m really enjoying this set and creating different looks.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this set of 30 colors that I purchased. I am not one to usually use a lot of makeup; however, eye makeup is something that I have always been a fan of. This eyeshadow pencil set could not have been more perfect for me. I was able to replace my more expensive eyeshadows and eyeliners with this one set, which takes up a lot less space in my bathroom (I know my fianc&amp;eacute; is happy about that). Apart from the overall convenience of this set, the quality of each pencil is what really has me hooked. I honestly would have expected to pay a lot more for this set then what I ended up paying. I am impressed with how moisturizing these pencils are. I always feel comfortable in my makeup when I am using this product – some other brands make my eyes feel really dry and completely uncomfortable. This was definitely a great find and I will continue to be a loyal Shany customer.</li>
    <li> I love these so much, the price was great too.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had the Chance to play with these yet but It did come on time and I absolutely love the colors . Can&#x27;t wait to try them</li>
    <li> These pencils are fabulous! Again, another super pigmented product from SHANY! This box set, it the ultimate! So many colors, and there is a mix of shimmer and matte, everyone is sure to find some new favorites! I have several uses for these pencils, they are not only great as eyeshadow or eyeliner, but many make great highlighters, and I even use a few as lipstick. They are so creamy that they literally glide on, making application super easy, and they are a breeze to blend. The color doesn&#x27;t fade, and it doesn&#x27;t dry out and make the skin around my eye wrinkly like some other shadows. I also love that they are cruelty free! So many vibrant colors, easy to apply and blend creamy shadows, I can not recommend this set enough!</li>
    <li> The eye pencils are ok, well pigmented. However, it runs and stains other parts of the eyelid. The lip pencils are equally nice and more useful to me.</li>
    <li> I am so shocked by the quality of these eye shadow pencils. I am fairly new to makeup and just got tired of having to clean up my face after applying loose/pressed eye shadow so I went to seek out a cream or pencil and stumbled upon this. Blown away. It applies pretty smooth and no debris on my cheeks, which I am extremely thankful for. It lasts all day from what I can tell but I have oily eyelids so nothing stays there long no matter what I use underneath. Overall, I love these and the colors! Great price as well for 30!</li>
    <li> This product just glides on! No eyeshadow base necessary! I have never used a product that blended so well, highlighted, and line your eyes!! Vitamin E and Aloe infused???! Are you kidding me? This is a no-brainer! These pencils are enormous, and are sure to last quite a long time. Best part...THEY NEVER DRY OUT!!! Get out of here! PETA members created these products. Incredible. 5 stars. Why would you use any other makeup. SHANY is the new black.</li>
    <li> Items came in super fast, I waited about 4 days and that&#x27;s it...great pigment and long lalasting! The set box was a bit damaged but it was fine because its nothing too bad or harsh... I received30 wonderful chunky pencils and I&#x27;m so in love with them!I haven&#x27;t touched my nyx, mac, urban decay or sephora pencils!</li>
    <li> Great Eye Pencils, went back to.purchase more for gifts . Sadly they are no longer available.</li>
    <li> Disappointing application of eye colors.</li>
    <li> Came really nicely packaged, good colors. Same as pictured. Go on pretty bright, good quality for the price!</li>
    <li> You get a lot  of colors for such a cheap price. I love the variety  and how smooth the liners go on.</li>
    <li> DIDN&#x27;T LIKE IT BECAUSE IT DIDN&#x27;T TWIST UP OR DOWN. I FELT LIKE THE LIPSTICK WAS A LITTLE DRY.</li>
    <li> Omg!  I didn&#x27;t expect much because the price was so cheap, but I was pleasantly surprised.  These come in a nice box,with all the colors of the rainbow.  They are large and go on smooth.  They stay on all day.  They they compete very well with the higher end brands.  This is the best deal on Amazon!</li>
    <li> Love the packaging and the display box this comes in. Can&#x27;t wait to use these fun colors!</li>
    <li> better than i expected, love it</li>
    <li> NOT AS DESCRIBED! It says it contains only eye shadow pencils, but I received LIP PENCILS as well. I don&#x27;t typically use lip pens. Not too happy..</li>
    <li> Not all eye shadows in the set. There are 10 lip liners/lipsticks. Two are clearly mislabeled-a nude brown labeled as Onyx and a taupe/gold lipstick Bamboo is a eye shadow not lipstick. The lipstick stays on all day. Used the white eye shadow as a base and stayed on all day. Great value for the price.  I got a nice surprise when I discovered the &amp;#34;Onyx&amp;#34; lipstick was a duplicate for MACs Boldly Bare Lip Liner.  Just saved $18!  It wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if other lipsticks are dups for your favorite more expensive liners.</li>
    <li> Love the colours. The packaging is a bit much. But i will store them in it to protect them.</li>
    <li> I love these! I bought myself a set then when they got here, beautifully pigmented organized in the gorgeous display box, I wanted more for my daughters (so they don&#x27;t &amp;#34;borrow&amp;#34; mine). Sadly I must have been too greedy because after putting 3 of these &amp; 2 of the thinner eyeliner pencil sets into my cart &amp; a set of 12 other Shany eyeliners that I almost messed up &amp; bought with 1-click but I went back quickly &amp; canceled &amp; put them in my cart instead &amp; the items all had a code to save 25% on 6 Shany products, &amp; lower percents for fewer items. I finally chose all of the items I wanted &amp; the code wasn&#x27;t working. I tried to checkout 5 or 6 times stopping each time when the code wouldn&#x27;t work (I&#x27;ve had this happen before then went back an hour later &amp; had the code work so that&#x27;s what I was expecting to happen). I got sidetracked by one kid then another &amp; 3-4 hours later got back to my order only to find these were no longer in my cart but instead are &amp;#34;saved for later&amp;#34; and not currently for sale along with the other two sets of liner pencils. All I had to do was forget about the 25% off &amp; finish the sale!&lt;br /&gt;I come back and check to see if they are back daily. I still hope to pick up some for my girls for Christmas  (I always shop early! Helps keep from getting frustrated if things show up late)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set of pencils has 11 labled lip &amp; the other 19 are labled eye pencils but all seem to be the same formula (&amp; some eye colors look more like lip colors to me &amp; some lip colors I&#x27;ve used on my eyes)..&lt;br /&gt;The colors go on well, like a soft crayon, &amp; stay on.&lt;br /&gt;They blend well when first put on then they stay put.&lt;br /&gt;The colors that go on last! I have had issues with the lightest colors (white/platinum) not always showing up on me but that is when I put them on with some of the loose powders I bought from Shany (which I ABSOLUTELY LOVE! ) so maybe those products don&#x27;t work well together.&lt;br /&gt;I ended up staying up late with kids one night &amp; somehow not washing my makeup off until nearly 24hrs after putting it on &amp; it stayed &amp; looked good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really do like these! I&#x27;ve used them as eyeliner on the waterline. They are great for adding a quick pop of color to your everyday look. Toss a cpl into your purse &amp; use them to put your makeup on in the parking lot just before work if you wake up late &amp; you&#x27;ll still look beautiful as ever.&lt;br /&gt;And the price is crazy amazing! Even without % off specials &amp; such!</li>
    <li> These lip liners are fantastic, nice saturated color, goes on smooth and stays on, a bit moisturizing and makes your look complete</li>
    <li> I got these for my wife and although they have a variety of colors and are easy to apply, the make-up does clump. She said that this make-up was below average and needs to be applied often.</li>
    <li> These are much nicer than I had expected. I only paid $8 for the set, and I did use eyeshadow primer with it, I really liked being able to use the lip colors on the eye area and vice versa. We are using this set as theatrical makeup, and it is fantastic for that. I love that the product has no perfume in it.</li>
    <li> Great deal for the price! As a professional makeup artist, I must admit, I was definitely skeptical trying something new. BUT. The pencils glide on so smooth, no tugging on your eyelids at all!! The colors are great, delivering just the right amount of lightness or intensity depending on the day. I definitely suggest a primer before, but other than that I had no creasing, which I expected from something like this, and the lip pencils also lasted. I&#x27;ll definitely be back for more!</li>
    <li> Amazing! You get so much for such $10. The down side is that I don&#x27;t get why I had to pay $5 for delivery though. But will still give it 5 stars cos I love love love these pencils. Beautiful packaging too.</li>
    <li> So soft and the pigment is out of this world. Now you must set after applying but the color last allday and night!</li>
    <li> some of the colors are really light</li>
    <li> The kit comes with 12 lip pencils which isnt a problem for me but fot someone who strictly want eye pencils it might be misleading but you could still use the lips for the eyes! Same consistency! No creasing. Imo.better than la colors and nyx cause they are creamy but not slippery and oily and it comes in a nice cardboard case</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:a4abbe91cdcad510b58b7b5feb966cec]]i didn&#x27;t know I would love these as much as I did. The pencils are good for eyes and lips but I&#x27;ve used them for brows and cheeks too. With my baby on my hip these help me do all my make up in under 5 minutes with just this box plus foundation and mascara. The box has a perfect assortment of colors with different levels of translucency. The white is highly pigments and goes on very white. The frost white is more transparent and helps blending and is great to highlight under the brow and the inner corners. Plenty of fun darks for liners and shadowing. Colors are creamy and blend well while still allowing you to get a sharp line. Each pencil is about 4 inches. After a month or so of daily use I have only had to sharpen the frost white once, but I use it daily to blend.</li>
    <li> I love the texture of these liners. They are soft, silky, and go on incredibly smoothly. I love the colors offered. The only disappointment color-wise is that I wish there were a few more darker purple shades. Other than that, there&#x27;s a lot of colors to play with! If you&#x27;re going to be using them as eyeshadows, I would recommend an eyeshadow primer to really show off the color. They can be built up with powder eyeshadow to look truly brilliant. Well worth the money spent on this set. It&#x27;s easily the best affordable liner set I&#x27;ve bought on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Way better than expected. Some of the &amp;#34;shadows&amp;#34; are lipsticks and they are super pigmented!!!</li>
    <li> In my experience, the product did not perform as expected.  The description states: Long-lasting eye and lip shades that are sweat-resistant, heat-resistant &amp; water resistant.  Even after putting on the liner over eyeshadow base, the liner smeared after only a couple hours of wear.  I returned this set to Amazon.</li>
    <li> These are great because there are so many colors. The down side is that the tip is all you get. You cannot sharpen them, or twist them up in anyway. You&#x27;ll get great color using them gently, but when it&#x27;s gone it&#x27;s gone.</li>
    <li> The product description is not accurate.  It comes with eyeshadow and lip liner (not necessarily what I wanted, but can be used for eyes also.  Disappointed with the inaccuracy of product description.</li>
    <li> Love them so much just received them today they are creamy and glide on easily </li>
