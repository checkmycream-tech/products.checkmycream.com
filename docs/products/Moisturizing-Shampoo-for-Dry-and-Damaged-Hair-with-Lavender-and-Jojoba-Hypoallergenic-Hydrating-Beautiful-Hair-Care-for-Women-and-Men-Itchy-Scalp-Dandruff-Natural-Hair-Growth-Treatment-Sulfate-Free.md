<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I think this is a really great shampoo. I love that it is hypoallergenic and natural so it won&#x27;t aggravate my sensitive skin. I had excema on the back of my neck from my last shampoo and this one doesn&#x27;t cause that. I plan on buying this again but I would get a different version. This one seems almost too moisturizing. I have baby fine hair and it tends to need to be washed more often when I use this shampoo. I wish I had bought the Argan one instead but since I had the itchy flaky skin from my last shampoo I thought this one was the one. It definitely does the job, it&#x27;s just not the right one for me.</li>
    <li> I have extremely dry brittle hair with severe skin allergies(Rashes and extremely itchy skin. I originally tried their argan shampoo and was extremely pleased, I was offered I free product I decided to try this one. I just dyed my hair two days earlier and my scalp was extremely itchy I was dying to wash my hair, when mail women drop off this bottle. I read the directions provided . The redness and itch subsided immediately , so I decided to wash my body with it. The redness on my face dissipated and though the red patches on my body didn&#x27;t , the itching stop. I haven&#x27;t  used my cortisone cream yet it over 18 hrs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair dried, it was extremely soft and shiny and my color didn&#x27;t fade at all. The product did its job, my only problem is after dying my hair it came out a little darker than I liked , usually after washing it fades to a lighter color .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now after using both argan and hydrate I plan on going back to red hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The difference between their two products the argan provided a little more shine but hydrate moisten the scalp and hair&lt;br /&gt;Both products left hair shiny , the argan provided a bit more shine . Both product left my hair soft but hydrate left hair extremely soft .  HYDRATE  lathers slightly better . Both products didn&#x27;t cause any reactions. My mom tried both products and love it ,her hair came out better but she doesn&#x27;t have the problems with dry, scaly skin. We ordered twelve bottles between us.  Though It a little pricey, thank god I have a pickie,  I have used reken, Pantene, Aveda and biolage, none these products provided me with shine, Aveda did soften hair, but faded color.  Finally a product that didn&#x27;t cause irritation, hives, faded color and provided shine, and softness that I didn&#x27;t have for years&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have read some of the unfavorable some complained they saw no results ,or it didn&#x27;t come with instructions.&lt;br /&gt;Argan shampoo requires that you shake the bottle and leave in two to three mins then rinse. Use a quarter . I used a dime. My mom whose hair is a little longer than a houlder length,  first time had a bit of tangles at bottom of her hair. Next time I washed her hair  I used quarter which cover her nape and scalp  the other ten inches I used a little more ,no tangles . I also didn&#x27;t throw her long hair on top of her head to wash, I worked the product on longer part between my hands no tangles.  We both have straight hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hydrate  wet hair with warm water, apply product don&#x27;t leave product on longer than one minute, massage in small circular motion, rinse with a blast of cold water, (one downside, hate cold water) let air dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I little goes a long way  I used other products I used to use a handful , now I just use a dime(pickie with long bangs), which is more than enough Lathering doesn&#x27;t start right away ,but does lather provided you work in circular motion</li>
    <li> like this shampoo but it makes my hair a little dry</li>
    <li> I received a sample bottle of the Hydrate Shampoo by Maple Holistic&#x27;s.  I absolutely loved this shampoo, it has a great lather and does not completely dry out my hair when I wash it.  It also has a very nice scent.</li>
    <li> This conditioner works great!  It makes my hair very soft, yet does not leave it flat.  I really do think it has helped my scalp not be so dry and itchy. The conditioner also smells wonderful!  I would buy again for sure.</li>
    <li> I have struggled with dry scalp condition for the last 12 months. Hopeless, after trying many hair products, oils, home remedies.... I have found this miracle shampoo that have finally worked. After just one use the annoying itch was gone and my skin felt hydrated and invigorated. My hair feels softer and it looks healthier. Only small amount will lather up the entire head very nicely. The shampoo has a very subtle fragrance. I am so glad I found it. Thank you! I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Very good shampoo. I love it</li>
    <li> Keeps my thick hair from being greasy, but wish it were more reasonable priced.</li>
    <li> This shampoo arrived very quickly. I have been using it for a good while now. The first few times, I used it by itself without any other conditioner, oils, etc. It felt good on my hair, lathered well, rinsed out fine, and my hair came out feeling very clean with, surprisingly, little to no tangles. My hair actually felt hydrated. Unlike previous products that I&#x27;d tried, it also did not cause my hair to shed. I was surprised that it also reduced frizz/static (unusual for a shampoo to do). Later on when I used it, I began adding 2 drops of my Blood Orange essential oil, and it was the perfect combination. Who needs conditioner?! :-) I am so very impressed by this company and their products.</li>
    <li> It left my mother and my hair very dry and brittle.</li>
    <li> Use this on my baby and works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very pricey though, imo</li>
    <li> I am not a fan of the smell of this shampoo.  There is something in it that smells off to me and kind of ammonia-like.  The shampoo itself performs OK but I do not feel like it is worth the high price.  I will not be repurchasing.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is great for dry scalp. It&#x27;s has really helped my daughter who has had dry scalp since she was a baby. It also leaves hair soft. It helps out with winter dryness as well. I also got the silk 18 conditioner and love them both paired together.</li>
    <li> Smells pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;I wish there was more information on the bottle though, I like to read while in the shower</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this shampoo for three weeks, but so far I&#x27;m happy with it.  I have long, curly, color-treated hair.  I only shampoo my hair every 3-4 days, like many other curly-haired people who are prone to frizz and breakage.  While this approach has worked great for my hair, it left my scalp dry, itchy and irritated, with flakes of what I thought were dandruff falling out every time I scratched my head.  Turns out those flakes were dry skin, and since I started using this shampoo, they&#x27;ve completed gone away, along with the itching and the irritation.  My only neutral comment is regarding the smell.  It&#x27;s not terrible, but I&#x27;m not a huge fan.  That said, I&#x27;d rather deal the natural smell then have it be covered up by chemicals, so overall I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
    <li> This is the only sulfate free shampoo I&#x27;ve found that actually moisturizes my hair &amp; lathers.  I&#x27;ve tried many products over the years, from low end to high end, and this one is by far the best.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is great. Leaves my hair soft and my scalp refreshed and not itchy.</li>
    <li> Love the conditioner wanna try the shampoo</li>
    <li> I bought this product with the express purpose of treating dry scalp. I have been using the product for about two weeks and find that, slowly, my problem is clearing up. I make sure that I massage the producer into my scalp and let it sit for 2-3 minutes, as directed. Not a miracle worker, but the best that I have found so far....and I have been searching far and wide.</li>
    <li> I have been using the shampoo with its compatible rinse product for about 10 days. However, my scarf is still itchy. I feel like I use too much rinse, but actually I don&#x27;t. My hair is getting very dry and tangled. Lots of hair fall down during bathing.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money. Will not buy it again.</li>
    <li> This shampoo works for my dandruff problem. I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for two weeks and I usually let it sit for a few minutes. I&#x27;ve noticed that there are no flakes. Also it makes my hair feel cleaner and softer. I&#x27;d love to try their other products.</li>
    <li> Best products I have found for problem scalp with dry,  itchy, scaly issues. And I Love the fact that they are all natural with soothing herbs and vitamins.  I have used three of Maple Holistics products- Sage Shampoo, Hydrating Shampoo for Dry Hair and Flaking Scalp, and the Silk Amino&lt;br /&gt;Acids,Lavendar and Jojoba Oils Conditioner.  So as you can see, I am  Big Fan!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really surprised by this product. As I have a very sensitive scalp, been using treatment shampoo for so long , my hair started to become damaged. I needed a change. So, I found this miracle and couldn’t be happier. Thank you Maple Holistics !</li>
    <li> I have a dry scalp to where I get sores on my head.  This shampoo makes my scalp feel softer to where I am not getting as many sores like I did before, I didn&#x27;t even realize this was made for men.  Works well for woman too. Only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is the way it drys my hair out while washing it, but once the conditioner goes on, I completely forget the dryness of the hair.  My hair after a week of using this, feels so much healthier and less dry scalp.  I highly recommend everyone to try this females too!!</li>
    <li> My daughter swims competitively and is therefore in the pool 4-5 times per week.  The chlorine build-up in her hair is tremendous and it has been coarse and unmanageable as a result.  We have been trying to naturally strip it with apple vinegar, but it has been a slow process and she detests the smell of it.  I read reviews on Maple Holistics Shampoo for Dry Hair and Flaking Scalp and decided to give it a try.  By following the directions and letting it sit for a few minutes, the results were incredible!  Her hair is once again manageable and I believe a few more washes and we&#x27;ll have stripped the chlorine for good!  The complement of the Silk18 Conditioner made all the difference as well--we are hooked!</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t lie very must a skeptic about this one I was looking for something sulfate free but still moisturizing to the scalp and more importantly it will get rid of the dandruff and dry flakes so I can wear black tees again. I am on day 4.... not a flake or dandruff drop in sight. This literally cleans your scalp; when I first applied it felt like nothing so I did two rinses with my focus on dry patches, I part my hair every morning to check clean and and hair feels so light; yes it is pricey yes its not a big bottle but if dry over-processed and flaky hair is an issue you will find this product well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I did applied some coconut oil to my scalp after I conditioned but only because I love the smell of the coconut oil and it helps to moisturize my scalp throughout this winter cold.</li>
    <li> I am Chinese and have thick black hair but have a dry itchy scalp that is sensitive to most shampoos especially cheap ones. I was using Neutrogena dry hair shampoo which works great but have been using it for a long time and was feeling like my hair was getting weighed down by all the conditioners / product therefore I wanted to try an organic shampoo. I searched Amazon and found this one that seemed to fit the bill and was highly rated. I&#x27;ve been using it for one week and I love it! It lathers very well and I think this seems to be a problem with some organic shampoos. My hair is left feeling really clean, healthy and shiny and less weighed down. I am very glad I bought this product and it hasn&#x27;t irritated my scalp at all so I highly recommend it. You don&#x27;t have to use a lot of it as it lathers up really nice and I live in an area where there is hard water. It smells nice too. Nothing bad about this shampoo at all. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m currently on my second bottle.  I have thin, fine, delicate, slightly wavy hair that is prone to breakage. This shampoo cleans well without causing dryness or damage and leaves my hair soft and manageable. I&#x27;m planning on trying one of their conditioners next.  At first I thought the cost may be prohibitive, but you only need a small amount and can even dilute it with water. Oh, and the smell is divine :)</li>
    <li> I really really wanted to LOVE this shampoo, especially reading all the reviews. I needed a good moisturizing shampoo for my dry hair and scalp. It could just be me, but my opinion is it just dries out my hair. I am still using it, but will probably not buy this again.</li>
    <li> I only used this shampoo once but I really liked the results.  Actually I used it in combination with other hair products I used for the first time so I&#x27;m not sure which product made my hair smell, feel and look so good. Over all I like the shampoo and will Def use it again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s works for my dry scalp better than many other natural type products. I am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I chose this because it&#x27;s sulfate free. It works fine, make my hair very soft, and does not leave my scalp very dry. Like it.</li>
    <li> My hair is extremely oily with an oily scalp. After using this for the first time following the printed instructions on the label, my hair felt so much better. My scalp did not itch at all the following days. I will continue to buy this brand shampoo because i like the ingredients it contains. I think I will buy the degreaser shampoo since oil is more of a problem than an itchy scalp. Doesn&#x27;t leave my hair smelling funny either. It smells clean.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product!! I did need a little time to get used to the tea tree scent, but now I really enjoy it. Cleared up my dry scalp right away. Lathers really well and a little goes a long way. Leaves my hair feeling soft and smooth. Top it off with all natural ingredients and you have the perfect product!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product, it leaves my hair soft and silky, omitting other products from my life.</li>
    <li> My hair feel like straw after using this product. Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a sulfate-free, color-safe, dandruff shampoo and honestly, there are not many products out there that fit that calling card.  This shampoo did, and does what I&#x27;m looking for.  The flaking on my scalp has been reduced significantly and my color has not dulled at all.  The product makes my hair super duper &amp;#34;squeaky&amp;#34; and actually becomes fairly difficult to untangle if I didn&#x27;t use conditioner.  Also, the bottle is a bit small for the price - I have thick, medium length hair and I went through a bottle in about two and half months (I wash my hair every other day and use two applications each time).  However, I&#x27;m still happy with this product and will continue to buy it!</li>
    <li> Love love love this shampoo!  Very moisturizing and calming for your scalp.  Made my hair feel very soft and clean.  Doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down or make it feel greasy.  Would definately recommend if you have a dry flaky scalp.</li>
    <li> I can honestly say this product works pretty good.  Definitely helps with hydration of your hair and works hard on your dandruff problems. There is a noticeable decrease in the amount of dandruff in just a few short days.  I am happy with this product and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I have only used this shampoo twice and I have already noticed that I have less flakes! I have a combination of dry scalp and dandruff, so i get really bad flakes that is very noticeable near my face and it can make me very self conscious, but this shampoo is wonderful and even after using it only 2 times i have noticed there are less flakes in my hair!! Totally recommend this product!!!</li>
    <li> Used this shampoo as directed for two months (guy with short hair).  I have noticed zero change in the condition of my scalp or hair.  Save you money and look for something else.</li>
    <li> Both my beard and head-top hair had a tremendous amount of flakes even  just one day after using regular or a store bought dandruff shampoo. Dandruff shampoos did not stop the flakes.  This product does. I have been using this product now for a couple of years.  It works great for me.  Remember to let it sit on the hair for a few minutes.  ANOTHER BIG PLUS: IT IS MADE IN AMERICA. WHEN YOU HAVE A CHOICE, BUY USA PRODUCTS!!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing there&#x27;s no words i can describe to say how wonderful this product actually works</li>
    <li> I have very dry hair and scalp and this is the best shampoo I have ever used. I use it with their Silk conditioner. It is really too pricey for me as it is only an 8 oz bottle but I only wash my hair once of twice per week so I don&#x27;t have to buy it real often. I will continue to purchase this product. Healthy ingredients!  Good stuff!!</li>
    <li> I am sorry that I have to change my review of this product. I feel the term organic on this product is EXTREMELY misleading as it contains acrylate coploymers which is defined as plastics. Plastic is not natural nor can I believe that plastic is remotely organic. The argument that the FDA has approved a chemical as safe is NOT reassuring. The FDA has a horrible track record for fast tracking approval of chemicals and only after people have become sick or even die do they begin recalls. A few lucky(?) individuals may be aware that their health issues can be traced to a chemical and get a doctor willing to verify and documentand only then they may be compensated for their suffering and grief. I wouldn&#x27;t count on that scenario. I know been there done that, nearly died, can&#x27;t get a doctor to stand and admit the source of my problem. If you are truly concerned about the chemical in our food and personal care products you may want to rethink this purchase. If you choose to trust the FDA and loosely based claims of organic you will probably will be happy with it. My conscience demands I make these comments.  Finally I can shampoo my hair, have it feel great and the peeling sores that plague my scalp healed after 2 uses! I am amazed at the results as I can not even find a doctor who can or will diagnose my scalp problem. I have tried homemade no-poos, cowashes, everything. Some help my hair and aggravate my scalp while others helped my scalp and left me with Halloween witch hair. This shampoo combined with the natural conditioner has worked a miracle. No itching, no sores and my thick (I have so much hair) yet flyaway fine (a single strand is baby hair fine) feels soft, full of body and will hold a curl for 2--3 days. No more oily, no more dry static. Just beautiful hair with a happy scalp. I can go days on single wash, condition and styling. I recommend you don&#x27;t wash everyday for maximum benefit. Buy this one it works!</li>
    <li> Great product. All natural ingredients. You can smell the goodness in each bottle.</li>
    <li> I usually get a very dry, flaky, itchy scalp in winter and nothing ever really seemed to Work. A friend about a month ago recommended this product to me and finally I&#x27;ve found some relief. This is my new go to product.</li>
    <li> This shampoo right here works!!! I and my brother ha e both used this product and have to say its fantastic!!! Its really soothing and l i ve the scent!! Smells fantastic!! I dont have anything bad to say. I just love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once but it appears to have worked. I no longer have a itchy scalp. I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> I used a sample of this back when they offered to send one free sample of any product. It was a good shampoo, but I did not feel a difference from the Argan Oil shampoo in the dark bottle. It may be because they&#x27;re both moisturizing, so I was not sure what to expect. Either way, it&#x27;s a solid natural shampoo, which is hard to find.</li>
    <li> I have battled with dry scalp most of my life and it has been a challenge ! I have wasted a lot of time and money over the years trying to find something that works. This product WORKS !! After just five days of use my scalp is drastically different. The itchiness and flaking has subsided. I would recommend this to anyone who has a difficult time with winter dryness as well. The only thing I expected was a bigger bottle for the price . But this product is worth every penny :)</li>
    <li> I ordered this shampoo by mistake.  I have used the Maple Holistics Tea Tree shampoo before which I LOVE and is more what I need for my halir and scalp.</li>
    <li> I got this because I have a dry scalp when winter rolls around. I read other reviews and felt like this was the best choice to aid in hydrating my scalp. I was right! This product has helped with the flakes I normally have with all other shampoos that I&#x27;ve used. The smell is a little on the strong side inside of the bottle, however, when applied to your hair it doesn&#x27;t leave a smell that I&#x27;ve noticed. I also feel a cool, relaxing affect once I have lathered it on. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase, and would suggest it to anyone with dry scalp, or flakes.</li>
    <li> Omg smells Sooooo bad</li>
    <li> My mom needed a shampoo for dry hair and flaking scalp. So, I bought this wonderful product and now she has perfect hair! No problem with it, perfect shipment, perfect product. Thanks to the seller and thanks to the item! Now my mom is happy with her hairs!</li>
    <li> Make Hair soft and scalp feel moist. Good Product!</li>
    <li> Months of using different brands of &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; shampoo left me with a mildly flaky scalp. After only one use with this shampoo and their Silk 18 conditioner I was able to scratch my head and run my fingers through my hair with no flakiness. My curly hair is also frizz free and air dries beautifully!</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo because I do get dry skin, in particular on my scalp and the dry desert in the southwest does not help. I have used this shampoo every other day and have noticed less itching and flaking. It has a nice smell. Not strong or overpowering. The act that it doesn&#x27;t contain all the harsher chemicals used in other shampoos is also a bonus. Give it a try! I did, and will buy again.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, after use my hair felt so healthy.</li>
    <li> seems  to have a lot of mystery ingredients. reluctant to try it</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work as I expected it to. Used it everyday and still had okay results. Still in search of a product that&#x27;s better for me.</li>
    <li> It makes my hair look shiny and feel softer than it was, I highly recommend! I will buy again from seller.</li>
    <li> I really thought this would be a great shampoo but it was very disappointing or my hair is very disappointing. It made my hair feel like a rats nest of twine. Dry, brittle, and impossible to brush without being in pain!</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo I believe I have ever had!!!! Thank you</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo!! Only used a few times and can see a change in my scalp and hair. Excited to try other products.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for only around 2 weeks or so. It seems to have helped clear up a slight bit of dandruff flakes. However, at first the flakes were more abundant. Now it seems to have calmed down but I can&#x27;t say for sure. The smell is kind of odd but I like that it is supposed to be 100% natural. Hopefully with more time it might work a little better but so far it hasn&#x27;t made a great noticeable difference for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 41 years old and for 20 years I&#x27;ve had flaky scalp most the winter, sometimes thru spring. It got so bad, I&#x27;d have almost painful red spots on my scalp. The flakes were embarrassing.  I&#x27;ve tried everything, even prescriptions. This is the only thing that has ever worked. I have no itch, no flakes, my hair feels amazing. Wish I would have found this 20 years ago.</li>
    <li> I have struggled with a dry scalp and hair for a long time. I had almost given up on trying to find a shampoo. I INSTANTLY noticed a difference with this shampoo. I am no longer scratching my scalp and can wear darker clothing without worrying about people seeing the flakes on the shirts. Lather it on the scalp for 2 minutes, rinse, and repeat. It also smells great! Give this a try, you definitely won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> It has been a not bad experience so far.. Still leaving the hair little dried out. Will finish the bottle and edit the review if I find any difference.</li>
    <li> This shampoo has helped to relieve my itchy scalp, and I feel like it makes my hair feel softer.</li>
    <li> this is the best shampoo for treating flaking and dry skin issues , i have had flaking since many years and have been trying different shampoos like tar gel , tea shampoo,non sulphate etc but none of them worked , i had no issues for couple of days and then the flaking would start again but this worked like a gem , have been using it since a month now and have no flaking when i wantedly scratch or wave my hair....also the itching thing on head is no more happening..wonderful product..i would recommend to have a haircut ,short hair use this product for best results</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to take of my dry scalp. As this winter was particularly cold, my scalp got really itchy and started to flake. I did not want to buy a chemical anti-dandruff shampoo so I was looking for a natural alternative. Then I found this product. It was great from the first moment! Already after the first application my scalp got less irritated and felt great! Now, after several hairwashes, the flaking is completely gone and my hair feels great. It also smells really nice!</li>
    <li> I was excited about the reviews of this product and how it advertises balancing scalp skin issues.  I don&#x27;t think I have dandruff, I think I have a combination of dry skin and build-up from product and unhappy scalp! I&#x27;ve only used the shampoo twice so far but I&#x27;m confident it will work as claimed just based on the first two uses.  The first time, it felt and smelled great and honestly, my scalp felt better immediately.  The second time, 2 days later ( I have naturally curly hair and do not wash it every day), it felt the same but right after the shower I noticed the dry spots were a little inflamed.  However, within several hours those spots had calmed down and looked/felt better than they have in a long time.  I think it&#x27;s all part of the re-balancing and healing process.  My main concern is scalp itchiness, build-up and flakes, which are all being addressed with this shampoo.  But as a bonus my already healthy and shiny hair is not as weighed down and looks healthier!  I would be interested in trying the conditioner now.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with this shampoo!  I live in Utah which is very dry so I&#x27;m always looking for products that can help with moisture.  This shampoo does a very good job.  When I blow dry my hair, it does not come out all frizzy from the dryness.  I would recommend this product and I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for about a week and I can absolutely see a difference. It feels a little different when I wash it out than my previous shampoo - not better or worse, but I can tell it is a different product. When my hair dries it looks gorgeous, it adds a little body and shine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo on and off since I got it at the end of May. I enjoy the smell of it, it reminds me of a spa I visited only once this past year and brings with it fond memories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beyond the smell, I have noticed that since using it, my dry scalp has gotten a bit better. (I was told it was dandruff for years, but no dandruff shampoo has ever worked beyond a week or so before it stops working... OR it makes it worse immediately - but this past year I decided maybe it was just dry scalp and started playing around with dry scalp products instead since slathering lotion on it seemed to help a bit in the past.) Regardless, I&#x27;m not flaking off huge bits all over the place anymore and the tiny annoying flakes have decreased by about 2/3. There&#x27;s still a few rough patches here and there and one place that itches like mad no matter what I do. But for the most part, this shampoo seems like it&#x27;s working better than most have in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Should be noted after using it and getting out of the shower, your hair feels oddly... different if you&#x27;re used to other shampoos like I was/am. I though I was having dry hair issues at first (odd) but once my hair dried and i touched it, I was well aware this was not what was happening. I think it&#x27;s the lack of random chemicals and whatnot. Pretty awesome in the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now... what caused me to put 4 instead of 5 stars, you ask? Since I&#x27;ve been using it, I&#x27;ve been getting pimples on the back of my neck and around my ears. Not horrible ones, but the tiny red lump sort that just annoy. I go to bed with my hair wet, always have, rather than using a blow dryer and I think that the wet hair plus whatever the shampoo is doing to help the dandruff/dry scalp... is not liking my neck/ear area nearly as much. I&#x27;m trying to wash off that area with a scrub instead of just water after I shampoo to stop it. But probably having my hair pressed against my neck at night is not helping. So... one star comes off for the creation of a new nuisance, but 4 stars given for taking an age-old one and making it far better than it has been.creation of a new nuisance, but 4 stars given for taking an age-old one and making it far better than it has been.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with dry scalp and flaking for years and have never really found an effective way to combat it.  Moving to Denver where the air is notoriously dry didn&#x27;t do much to help the situation, and has been getting progressively worse over these past few winter months.  Kind of randomly stumbled upon this shampoo on Amazon one day and read the reviews and thought I&#x27;d try it out.  Now, my dry scalp was to the point that if I ran my fingers through my hair at all I&#x27;d get some noticeable flaking, but after using this shampoo only one time, it basically eliminated any of those visible flakes and &amp;#62;95% of those tiny little flakes that are always stuck deeper in your hair.  I&#x27;m actually still kind of in disbelief that the shampoo is working so well, but after a few washes with this stuff, my hair is virtually flake free.  Only gripe is that it&#x27;s a little pricier than the shampoos that I usually buy, but it&#x27;s certainly not anything to dock any stars for.  And as for the scent...meh, it has a kind of subtle minty smell to it - very gender neutral. Also picked up their Silk 18 amino acids conditioner and am pretty pleased with that product so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Wanted to make a note that this product is intended to help alleviate the symptoms of dry scalp (which it does very successfully), NOT dandruff.  Dandruff is typically caused by fungi of the genus Malassezia, which thrive in the sebaceous glands of your scalp.  If your flakes are larger/clumped together and oily and have a yellowish tint to them, then you probably have dandruff and should check out tea tree oil shampoos or something else anti-fungal.  If your flakes look dry and white and are relatively smaller in size, then this might be the shampoo for you!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo, I had very itchy and scaly scalp with patches, i was constantly scratching. With just one use I noticed a difference! I got it on Monday... Today is Thursday, the itching is not completely gone but the white flakes and patches are plus my hair is silky soft!! No lie. I am sure with continued use the itching will go away.</li>
    <li> I have had an itchy dry scalp for as long as I can remember. I have tried every shampoo out there, mostly the big brands. I found Maple Holistics on amazon and decided to try yet another product. This shampoo actually helps my scalp. After a few uses, I could tell that my scalp was less irritated and itchy. My hair was really soft too. I am so happy with this product that I feel like I need to stock up on it. It smells great from the lavender oil. It is a quality product that does what it says! Very, very good stuff!</li>
    <li> Everyone has different hair types. I have always had dry scalp which lead to flakes. I have tried shampoo and no shampoo. I decided to use this because it does not contain any sulfate. Although I still get flakes, I did notice my hair does feel much better. I have only been using it for a week or so now, so I am still monitoring to see how it goes My hair actually feels pretty healthy. I think it is a pretty good product and it is worth checking out if you still have not find a hair treatment that you like.</li>
    <li> Made my hair dry and itch , used it 2 weeks and never got any better !!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have tried several shampoos for dry scalp and flaking but this is by far the best yet, follow the directions and feel the relief.</li>
    <li> Hair feels great, soft and healthy after using this product. Also scalp feels clean without using a harsh dandruff shampoo!</li>
    <li> Did not improve my itchy dry scalp. Would not again.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo for my fine, straight hair. The main thing I want my shampoo to do is to clean my hair without weighing it down. That&#x27;s why I found this shampoo to be perfect for my needs.</li>
    <li> I hate this product. I used a different shampoo from the same manufacturer the bottle is purple in color. That works ok. But this one is terrible. I have thin hair and dandruff. After reading reviews i decided to give a try. I tried this for 3 months and there is no change in my hair fall and My hair weighed down and i got a feeling my hair is getting even thinner.. Stopped using it.. Wont recommend it</li>
    <li> This is the second bottle of shampoo that I have bought from Maple Holistics and I love their products. This shampoo works great on my dry scalp. I have not had dry scalp all winter long because of this shampoo. It is easy on my sensitive skin. Overall a great product.</li>
    <li> Have been using it for a week now and no results.. in fact the flaking is getting worse.. Doesn&#x27;t smell good either.</li>
    <li> Top-notch product that works great!</li>
    <li> I like this product ! I read a lot about shampoos for dry hair and flaking scalp and i&#x27;m very impressed with the results of this one.. I had some problems in my scalp and when i found  this product and used i really felt better.. This shampoo took care of my dry hair and scalp.. Aditional information: this minty smell is amazing.. Recomend this product !</li>
    <li> Made my hair limp, dull, and lifeless. No good.</li>
    <li> This product really save me. My hometown is a region of river and lake in China. But I am living in Texas now. Super Dry!!!! My hair and scalp will turn oil after I washing them only half a day. What&#x27;s worse, the dry cause eczema in my scalp, painful and itchy. I have used a lot of products like Paul Mitchell, Shiseido... but they did not work.&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo really works. It treat the itch and can last two days. And It feels very gentle, no chemicals irritating. Rich in bubble.. wash easily. five stars!&lt;br /&gt;zhen de hen hao yong a..</li>
    <li> Had dry itching, flaking scalp with acne bumps before using this product. Over a month later of using this shampoo my scalp is completely healed thanks to this shampoo. Just an added bonus that the ingredients are all natural</li>
    <li> This shampoo did not help to relief the itching of my scalp, after using it a few times my scalp felt very irritated and sore.</li>
    <li> I was really hoping this would help BUT while it felt nice while shampooing (nice and tingly) it did not help with my dry scalp and itching. My daughter told me that it&#x27;s a ph balance and to try spraying Apple Cider Vinegar on my scalp and wrap a towel on my head for about 20 mins so I&#x27;ll give it a go!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really happy with this shampoo. I was experiencing dry itchy scalp and tried a lot of different products for dandruff including both the standard stuff and the tea tree products; nothing worked. In fact, I think most made my head more dry and itchy. After about a week using this product, my scalped stopped itching. I&#x27;ve been using this for many months and I just ordered my second bottle so I&#x27;ll have it available when I finally run out. If you&#x27;ve been searching for something to help with itchy scalp, it is definitely worth the cost of this product to see if it works for you. It only takes a very small amount and it lathers up nicely. I recommend you follow the directions and leave it in for a couple minutes. Rinse and repeat wasn&#x27;t necessary for maintaining results, but as with any other shampoo, you will get a lot more lather the second wash and that may contribute to the results.  A dime size amount is all it takes, so depending how much hair you have, the bottle could last a long time.</li>
    <li> I live in New York and it&#x27;s always hard to find a good shampoo. But I&#x27;ve tried Maple holistic and I like it. For the first two times it was good. My hair isn&#x27;t so bad because of that. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I color my hair every four weeks and tend to get a flaky, dry scalp afterwards. I also only shampoo every three-four days to keep my color from fading. This has turned out to be the best thing I&#x27;ve tried to keep my scalp soothed and flake free yet not greasy. I may try a different formula from this brand just to experiment, but I think this brand is great quality and I have no complaints about this one.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is great.  Definitely worth trying.</li>
    <li> This dried out my hair. I was very disappointed since this is supposed to be formulated to hydrate. At the first couple of uses, my hair felt soft and it even curled a little better. But, with a few more uses, my hair ended up brittle. I tried changing the amount of time I left it on my hair, one day keeping it on for a long while, another day only lathering then an immediate rinse. It just got worse and I had to discontinue use. I am now doing oil treatments to try to get my hair back into decent condition. Their shampoo isn&#x27;t for me, but I do love their Silk 18 conditioner, which is the best conditioner I have used in my life. I will just stick with their conditioner and go with another manufacturer&#x27;s shampoo. I hate to waste the product, though, so I will use this as a body wash until it is used up.</li>
    <li> Dried my hair out and the itch was still there</li>
    <li> Used it for the first time. WOW!!! My hair is so smooth and shiny. My hair has not looked and felt this good in ages. I love this product! Best conditioner I have used.</li>
    <li> My hair is curly, and it&#x27;s frizzy most of the time. I switched to sulfate free shampoos in the last year, and have noticed a difference. This is by far the best shampoo I have used. It made my hair soft, shiny, and manageable. I had orange flakes of dandruff, but it&#x27;s cleared up. The shampoo is thick, and the bottle last a long time.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a moisturizing shampoo that was sulfate-free.  I tried this in combination with the Silk 18 conditioner.  The shampoo makes my hair feel clean and soft and helps to prevent that dry hair look.  I have even been using it on my 4 year old daughter (she is good about covering her face and keeping it out of her eyes) and it keeps her long, fine hair looking very healthy! I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Used for two weeks now and my hair and scalp feel much better.  Tried Wen products before and did not have much improvement..glad I tried this.</li>
    <li> This shampoo awesome with natural ingredients. I wanted which does not contain harsh chemicals that&#x27;s the reason I am buying this product again.thanks maple.</li>
    <li> I had my doubts about this product because I have tried so may shampoos that claim to work on dandruff and scalp flaking. I was not expecting much. I used the shampoo and noticed a few things. The shampoo did not make my hair feel dry or brittle. My hair felt soft. When my hair dried I noticed a huge difference in the flaking on my scalp. Huge decrease in the flaking and dandruff. After the second wash I noticed even less flaking. I am happy and very pleased with the shampoo and I will order again.</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t notice a difference with this product. I feel like it made my hair less manageable and actually drier.</li>
    <li> i used this product in the pass and its absolutely great,&lt;br /&gt;when using it ,once your hair get dry it get&#x27;s really soft .&lt;br /&gt;the smell of this shampoo its nice.it help eliminate dries hair and itching scalp&lt;br /&gt;love it</li>
    <li> My hair is very dry and damaged from years of bleaching, but this shampoo made it feel baby soft and much more manageable. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of the expensive stuff and none of them were as successful as this product. Plus the minty smell is a great perk! I&#x27;ve already recommended it to all my friends so they&#x27;ll believe me when I rave about it.</li>
    <li> Is what its says Hydrate.Its a mild shampoo and it leaves hair soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for the past couple of weeks and I&#x27;m still on the fence.  It does control the itchiness as it claims but it also feels as if it strips my hair just as any other dandruff shampoo does, which is disappointing since it&#x27;s called Hydrate.&lt;br /&gt;I also can&#x27;t understand how this shampoo creates suds when it&#x27;s supposed to be sulfate free but it&#x27;s not a deal breaker for me at all.&lt;br /&gt;Just wish it didn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling so stripped and snarled as it did with the typical OTC shampoos which are much cheaper.</li>
    <li> I hate the smell of this shampoo. I can&#x27;t quite describe it. It doesn&#x27;t have that clean, menthol smell you&#x27;d expect from an anti-dandruff shampoo. I didn&#x27;t buy it for controlling dandruff. I just needed a moisturizing shampoo. I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my hair since using it.</li>
    <li> Shampoo indeed relieved itchy, dry scalp that I had lived with for years. However, the scent is unpleasant, in my opinion. It is a rancid smell; the smell does not remain in the hair after rinsing.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! My scalp and hair have never felt better. My daughter tried it and now she is hooked.</li>
    <li> Does not control dandruff!</li>
    <li> This shampoo makes for a great experience when I take a bath and I feel this on my scalp and I smell the lavender and jojoba oil.</li>
    <li> Made my scalp much happier and less dry hoping to see more results over extended use.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is very effective and you really get quite a bit of lather from just a small amount of the shampoo. My hair and scalp feel less dry and my &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; hair is fluffy and shiny.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this stuff! With the first use I could tell the difference in the softness of my hair! Smells amazing too!</li>
    <li> The one and only reason I took a single star off my review for this shampoo is because, in my opinion, it smells pretty darn bad.  However, sometimes we have to sacrifice those nice fragrances we all love for the sake of something that actually works, and I can tell you this product really does work.  Even after just one use, my hair is noticeably softer and hydrated, and my scalp even FEELS better, as well as looks better! Not a single flake in my dark red hair!!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t take much and lathers very well. Its best action is on scalp skin. I feel very well after using this shampoo and I will order it again.</li>
    <li> I received a sample by mail. Shampoo works better for me than Head &amp; Shoulders! Smells like strong tea but is pleasant, lathers nicely, improves scalp dryness when used daily (hence the 4 stars) I still need to use conditioner for dry hair and needed to use more product than suggested (my hair is long and thick) All Maple Holistic products are safe for color treated hair so I will try the conditioner too. The price may be a bit more but not a deal breaker for this quality safe product.</li>
    <li> My husband was having issues with dry and itchy scalp.  His skin is sensitive to sulfates so we figured a sulfate-free shampoo would help.  We tried an inexpensive sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner but he still had problems.  We also made sure he was always around a humidifier but that also didn&#x27;t help.  Finally he decided to use a Burt&#x27;s Bees Body Wash exclusively for a few days.  That helped some but the issue still persisted.  Switching to this shampoo has almost completely resolved his problems.  It&#x27;s expensive but he has short hair so a single bottle lasts a long time.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Finally a natural shampoo that I am not allergic to!  It leaves my hair shiny, clean and soft.  There is not a coating or funky feel to my hair after I rinse. Nothing to weigh it down.  Plus no flakes, none, zero, zilch!  I use conditioner too, but only a little bit just for extra protection from the summer sun.  After a few of months of using this product I am still flake free and with no allergic reaction (I am allergic to everything!) to the shampoo!</li>
    <li> I like how it cleans my hair without leaving it dry. I&#x27;m using the Silk18 Conditioner and these 2 products work well together. I&#x27;ve definitely seen some improvement in the condition of my scalp and hair. The old shampoo was making my scalp itch (I have very sensitive skin and react adversely to different chemicals.) Now I enjoy shampooing my hair on a more frequent basis - every 3rd day - and no longer see a whole lot of my hair in the shower drain trap. I like this shampoo and the Silk18 conditioner and highly recommend both.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and I will buy it again, it helps my scalp from itching.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month. I like how it only takes a little bit to make a big lather. It seems to have cut the flaking some but not gotten rid of it. I&#x27;m still hopeful that it will rid my scalp of the flakes but how long should it take?</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t buy any other Shampoo. My hair would never grow in a year I&#x27;d cut my hair once that&#x27;s how bad it was. It was so think on top it was like straw. Since I&#x27;ve use Maple Holistics Shampoo Dry Hair and Flaking Scalp I have new growth on top and my hair is growing so much I have to cut it now once a month. It is looking full and healthy. I recommend this to all my friends. I get so many comments on my hair now. I hope they never get rid of this Miracle of a Awesome Shampoo!</li>
    <li> Tingly feel love it&#x27;s natural.</li>
    <li> Got it last night, used it this morning!  So fresh!  Didn&#x27;t really like the smell of the shampoo, but the conditioner I used afterwards by Maple Holistics fixed that right up!  Quick delivery too!</li>
    <li> I can see that this is great for flaking scalp. Really what I needed after seeing that it was not dandruff that I had.</li>
    <li> I have the a really sensitive scalp and I get flakes and dry scalp with pretty much any shampoo out there, including the very expensive ones. I started trying organic shampoos and some worked but they left my hair very greasy and couldn&#x27;t go more than one day without washing it again. This shampoo along with the tea tree shampoo from the same brand are a miracle for me because they got rid of my flakes and don&#x27;t leave my hair greasy.</li>
    <li> Shampoo ordered for a friend. Was very happy with the purchase and would recommend to others, despite the elevated price.</li>
    <li> the smell it&#x27;s ok but leaves your hair super tangled. Also I don&#x27;t feel that improved the scalp. still itchy and flaky. the sage shampoo from the same brand is better if you are looking to treat the scalp</li>
    <li> wow this shampoo is the best one in the entire world!!- I used this for the past week and my hair started feeling so good!!</li>
    <li> Good shampoo.  I bought this hoping it would help with a persistent case of itchy, flaky scalp - but hasn&#x27;t worked so great for that.  Smells nice and cleans very well.  The product line is great as I have also used their Silk 18 conditioner so I will be trying a different shampoo within their line to see if it will help with my scalp issues.</li>
    <li> Just like the other one similar to this, I would shop at Walmart instead. regulay dandriff remover will do just fine.</li>
    <li> It smells nice and does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, but it didn&#x27;t help me with my dry scalp/itching.</li>
    <li> After using this shampoo a few times I really noticed a difference with my hair. I was doubtful at first but after using it, it worked really well. I was afraid b.c my hair was color treated but as it says and is true, it&#x27;s safe. I&#x27;m excited to finally find a brand that can meet my needs at a good cost. The slight scalp flaking that began with my hair this summer is no more!</li>
    <li> A bottle of this is really useful for keeping hair clean and keeping scalp healthy and feeling nice.</li>
    <li> Let me just start by saying two things: 1) I NEVER write reviews and 2) I&#x27;ve always been skeptical about the effectiveness of &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; products.  But I&#x27;m so ecstatic with this shampoo that I feel it&#x27;s my civic duty to share it with the world.  I&#x27;ve had mild excema on my scalp for about the last five years.  At first the breakouts were very sporadic and did not go beyond my hairline.  I treated it with a topical steroid lotion prescribed by my doctor with good results.  In the last year or so I noticed that it was flaring up more frequently, and covering more territory on my poor, defensless scalp.  I even got it in my ears....ahh, good times!  Over this past Summer it began spreading.  I was getting red, angry bumps on the back of my neck, just below my hairline - which looked awesome when I wore my hair up (not!).  My prescription steroid did not seem to be working as well as it used to and I was getting desperate.  I turned to the trusty world wide web to find a solution and eventually stumbled on to this shampoo.  After reading a positive review from someone with very similar symptoms, I pulled the trigger and ordered.  I have used this shampoo a grand total of three times and cannot believe the difference in my hair and scalp.  After the first use, the itching was noticeably reduced and the redness and flakiness began to go away.  This was after one use, people!!  I was so excited that I began to research more natural and holistic remedies.  Enter, essential oils.  I bought some lavendar and chamomile essential oils (which are supposed to be good for maintaining a healthy scalp) and added about seven drops to the shampoo to give it a boost.  Wow!! Now I&#x27;m really on to something!  I dare say my scalp feels almost clear of any excema and my hair looks more hydrated and healthy.  And I haven&#x27;t used my steroid lotion since I got this shampoo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I follow the directions exactly (lather, let it sit a few minutes, and repeat). I also bought the Silk 18conditioner by Maple Holistics.  These products are exactly as advertised, which is so refreshing.  I&#x27;m now a believer in the power of  natural products.</li>
    <li> A wonderful and gentle shampoo, smells great too.  Some moisturizing shampoos I have tried in the past left my hair feeling heavy and coated.  This does not, it&#x27;s moisturizing, yet leaves hair feeling clean.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever found for dry scalp.  Most winters in the Midwest are brutal for my dry scalp, I had tried lots of shampoos over the years, but so far I&#x27;ve had the best luck with this stuff.  Note that this product is not for people with dandruff, but for people with dry hair and scalp.  For me, it did the trick!</li>
    <li> luv luv luv my hair is soft and manageable and no worries about dry itchy scalp flaking at the edges no more!</li>
    <li> Had very dry hair from coloring, was told to try this, really helped my hair recover! And it was much cheaper compared to what my hair stylist recommended.</li>
    <li> This shampoo does exactly what the company says it will do. I have notice that my hair retains moisture much better now. My hair doesn’t look dry anymore even without adding anything to it and it is much more manageable. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> It feels very soothing, and my hair feels much softer after using this shampoo. The shampoo&#x27;s smell is a bit unpleasant, however. A better scent would easily bump this shampoo up to five stars in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I bought this type of shampoo for my mom. His mom is quite dry and cracked. After using 5-6 times for washing her one, she got the good result. Her hair is becoming smooth and reduce the number of hair which are cracked and dry. She said to me that she really loves this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from scalp problems for years now. Part of that is my own fault, I guess; I&#x27;ve never seen a dermatologist, so I always assumed that my itchy, flaking scalp had to be dandruff. I tried just about every dandruff shampoo out there without much luck. I started to wonder if it was because I was limiting myself to products without toxic ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While browsing one of my favorite news sites, I happened to come across an article that explained the differences between dandruff and dry scalp. It certainly sounded like I might simply have a dry scalp, so I decided to give it a try: I wanted something without sulfates, without toxic ingredients, and with naturally-sourced ingredients that are known to work well at treating dry scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this shampoo for about a week, my itchy scalp itched no more. After another couple of weeks, my hair was noticeably less flaky; there is still a bit of that, since that&#x27;s part of how the body manages your scalp, but my scalp problems have been effectively resolved. What can I say? It works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re trying to rid yourself of dry scalp like I was, I also recommend purchasing a shampoo brush to apply the shampoo. It&#x27;s a small, plastic brush - sometimes with plastic bristles, sometimes rubber - that lets you really work the shampoo into your scalp -and- stimulate the scalp at the same time.</li>
    <li> I ordered this shampoo after reading numerous reviews. I have dry and itchy scalp year round. I have tried a variety of other dandruff shampoos and will continue my search. Although I don&#x27;t mind this shampoo, I was really hoping it would help tame my flaky scalp. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference. It does however, leave my hair manageable and doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling like straw, like other natural shampoos have done to my hair.</li>
    <li> It really works and my hair is soft and silky</li>
    <li> This shampoo is great for your hair, it made my hair soft and glossy. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s terrible for your scalp (at least for mine). Initially the itching seemed to reduce but then returned even worse. I&#x27;ve had a lot of hair loss, I made sure to exclude other causes and it must be this shampoo. Maybe it&#x27;s the ingredients or the scratching that makes the hair fall out, most likely both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that the ingredients of the shampoo they sent me are different from what it says on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will discontinue use.</li>
    <li> I have extremely dry hair.  To find a shampoo that works and gluten free that I like has been a nightmare.  I love this shampoo.  I will be back to by more.</li>
    <li> I was hoping for the best with this product. Sadly, it was not meant to be.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had dry scalp issues since I was a kid. Some periods are better than others and lately it&#x27;s been pretty bad. Every shampoo I&#x27;ve tried hasn&#x27;t done the trick. Perhaps I should give my scalp a two star rating instead of this shampoo. As with all the others, I had high hopes before using the product. But, I tried it for a couple weeks and there seemed to be more flakes, not less.  Bummer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: The only shampoo that has actually worked was Philip B, but after a while it lost its magic. They&#x27;ve since come out with a new formula that I have yet to try, but it&#x27;s pretty expensive.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as an experiment to see if my scaly scalp might be due to dryness. The first thing I noticed was the wonderful smell! So soft, and calming. Just a hint of lavender, and it&#x27;s a genuine lavender smell, not an artificial one. I have very oily skin and hair, so this actually didn&#x27;t help me much there. (It really does hydrate.) However, I ended up using it as a body &amp; hair wash on my 8 year old son who has VERY sensitive skin and cannot use anything with color or perfumes. He can totally tolerate it and has made his skin soft, and less bumps on his arms, therefore I give this a 5-star rating for him. I still use it as a bubble bath to enjoy the lovely scent.</li>
    <li> OMG my hair is shiny and strong again! I really harmed them with flat iron and multiple trips between different climates. Now I feel my hair is back to life! The shampoo is very nice and hair feel very clean right after shampooing.</li>
    <li> I recieved a free sample to review this product.It is a great shampoo,made my hair soft but did not help with tangles.</li>
    <li> I found this product really did the trick! Pictures shows it as a different color. It comes in a clear bottle with the label shown above, and a creamy translucent color shampoo. I have to wash my hair fairly often because my scalp is really dry, so I thought to give this a try. Like some other post I read, when you first use this product, you get some shedding. This had me a little concerned. Not to worry it has to be for the good, I didn&#x27;t notice any hair lost. It lathers up pretty nicely. Directions say let set for a couple minutes. On the first shampoo, it felt sliky. Once I did rinse and reshampooed, it was a little less. Not nearly as dried out as most shampoos make my hair feel before conditioning. It has a wax smell, not to over powering, and doesn&#x27;t matter if you through other things in your hair anyway. Quick condition and blow dry. I usually have flakes still left in my hair before I blow dry, however not in this case. It left my hair feeling clean, and no build up still on my scalp! Once blown out, my hair feels nice and soft.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> I was going back and forth on this one or the one for the oily hair. I chose this one because as the summer months approach, my scalp gets super dry and as a result itchy. Upon using this for the first time, my first impression was that it smelled really fresh. I also loved how it lathered. I&#x27;ve used other natural sampoos that did not lather. I have been using this for about two weeks now (I wash my hair every other day) and I&#x27;ve seen an improvement in my hair&#x27;s dryness. It definitely does feel more hydrated. I know some people have wrote that they don&#x27;t use conditioner after this shampoo but I follow with a conditioner only on my tips. Overall, I&#x27;m happy with this product.</li>
    <li> This shampoo makes my hair very very thin. I don&#x27;t know if it is a good thing or bad thing, but everytime I use this, my hair becomes extremely thin and light. And this made my scalp became dry.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sad to state it didn&#x27;t help my poor scalp any.  In fact, it itched and flaked a little more.  I&#x27;m at a loss on what to do.  Yes, everyone is different so for all of those whom this product has helped, I&#x27;m jumping for joy!</li>
    <li> I have used this shampoo for two years and it makes my dry fly-away hair feel heavier and healthier even before I dry it.  I wet my hair a little with my hands before I shower and put in my first dose. It stays on about 5 minutes before I lather up in the shower and then shampoo a second time. My hair even squeaks with joy.</li>
    <li> IIm still getting used to it thougj works ok, really haven&#x27;t seen much of a difference. I&#x27;ve had it for 2 months now and on the site it says its a natural shampoo which means doesn&#x27;t have chemicals but when it was delivered to me and I read the back I saw that it did. I was shocked but OK. I really did want a natural shampoo but its OK. I</li>
    <li> best shampoo really works for me ill definately keep  using it actually I seem to enjoy all their products .</li>
    <li> Only thing I&#x27;ve found that does the trick. Resolved my dry scalp after the FIRST wash. Will likely buy again when I run out. If you&#x27;re having a problem with dry scalp, you must give it a shot!</li>
    <li> I used this shampoo for about 3 weeks. The only difference that I experienced was dry &amp; hard hair. It did nothing for my dry scalp and dandruff considering the good oils that it has in the ingrediants.</li>
    <li> Just got this in the mail yesterday and I coudnt wait to use it. My scalp was very itchy and dry. I put this on let it sit for 3 minutes and I swear I could feel it working. Today My hair is shiny and healthy looking. I love it!! I think this will be my go to product from now on.</li>
    <li> My husband has been using this shampoo for the past one month and he has found it very effective against his dry scalp. He has had this problem for a while and has tried numerous shampoos and hair oils to address the problem until I found the Maple Holistics brand for him. He decided to give it a try and finds the product very hydrating for his hair and scalp. The only reason this doesn&#x27;t get 5 stars is because of the smell, although not unpleasant - it isn&#x27;t the most refreshing. And this could purely be because there are no chemicals in the product, but apart from that this is his go-to shampoo from now!</li>
    <li> After one shampooing, my daughter&#x27;s and my flakey scalps were cured!  I had tried making shampoo with essential oil and olive oil, but they just left us with oily hair.  Using expensive salon shampoo had left us with dry hair and still flakey skin.  Because this is so expensive, we are alternating every other shampoo with this and a cheaper one and because this shampoo is so effective, our hair and scalp remain beautiful snd flake free.  I wish I discovered this years ago!  Besides resolving skin flaking, this shampoo leaves our hair soooo soft and strong!</li>
    <li> It works okay I guess , but I really didn&#x27;t notice much difference from other shampoos I&#x27;ve used that we&#x27;re much less expensive. Didn&#x27;t really help moisturize my hair or my scalp.</li>
    <li> works well, I liked the lack for fragrance</li>
    <li> I do admit that I may have ironed and colored my hair a little bit too much and now it has turned all dry and dull. My scalp also got affected, its itchy and I really do hate that feeling. I am just so glad that this product has done the trick that most shampoos could not do, get rid of the itchy scalp and has hydrated my hair back to life. I love it</li>
    <li> Such a great product. Superb!&lt;br /&gt;My mummy had layers of scales due to dandruff in her hairs but now nothing, even the first wash had miracle effects . I love it and will continue buying it for her in future,</li>
    <li> After deciding to switch to more natural hair care products over the traditional store bought options, I opted to try Maple Holistics products based on their reviews. I purchased the Shampoo for Dry Hair along with the Silk 18 conditioner and was pleasantly surprised. The shampoo provides a very rich lather and combined with the conditioner has left my hair very soft and manageable. I will definitely purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> Started using this shampoo about a month ago and love it!  Leaves my hair soft, silky and manageable.  Was skeptical about not using conditioner - but haven&#x27;t missed it at all.  Static is gone.  I highly recommend this shampoo!</li>
    <li> I have dry scalp and have tried many Amazon and whole food products. This is the 1st product that has reduced my flaking dramatically. I have 20 bottles of shampoo in my shower but now only use 1.</li>
    <li> Did not work for me. Flakes ceased but I had to use more than directed.</li>
    <li> First , let me say that I am African American with natural textured  4b/c hair, that I color treat with demi-permanent hair color. My hair is dry and my scalp can be even drier! Sometimes, I can scratch my scalp with a comb and the pieces of dry scalp, just fall. The itching I experience can be intense, so I decided to give this shampoo a try. After trying other natural products and being disappointed, I thought this product wouldn&#x27;t be any different. I was wrong. I made sure to wet my hair thoroughly and apply the shampoo to my scalp only. I massaged the scalp well and let the lather sit for a few minutes.I rinsed well, and immediately I could feel that my scalp was not tight and dry anymore. I couldn&#x27;t give this shampoo 5 stars, because it isn&#x27;t as moisturizing for the hair as it could be. I would repurchase it, I just wish that the formula could be made more moisturizing. For people with extremely dry hair, this may not be the right shampoo. A conditioner was necessary after I used this shampoo. To some people, the biggest problem will be the price of this product.</li>
    <li> I shave my head and some times my scalp can really dry out on the days when I dont shave it.  But with this shampoo it never does.  I know, its weird that i use shampoo but shave my head. I like a clean scalp, what can i say.  So yeah..good stuff.</li>
    <li> I have a very sensitive scalp and this shampoo is amazing. My hair feels so soft. I&#x27;m definitely going to get one of the conditioners.</li>
    <li> This absolutely works! Dry scalp flakes have disappeared and my hair feels wonderful. I use this in combination with their Sage shampoo product and couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results.</li>
    <li> I use this for my dermatitis for months and it really works better than the medicated pharmacy brand. I shampoo every other day and it&#x27;s so smooth and silky and my scale doesn&#x27;t get too dry.  It looks great:)  I am so happy with this product after trying so many different products with different price ranges.  This works for my hair, scalp and most importantly my budget!  Thanks Maple Holistics!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is effective and natural. Plus, the company is stellar. They care about their customers and our feedback. I highly recommend this shampoo for people with dry hair.</li>
    <li> It worked for my husbands hair but not mine.</li>
    <li> couldn&#x27;t get past the smell, but it works GREAT!</li>
    <li> Over time my hair has been increasingly dry and flaky and when I have to wear a lot of black suits this creates a problem. After trying many products my wife directed me to this organic shampoo.  Hydrate Shampoo is by far the best shampoo I have ever used.  The shampoo refreshes and hydrates my dry scalp and rejuvenates the hair follicles.  The smell of the oils and lavender are also very pleasant and refreshing.  And as a result, my black and blue suits no longer have white flakes which makes me a happy man.  Another added bonus of this hydrate shampoo is that I also used to get a lot of sores on my head but this shampoo has eliminated this.  I could not be more pleased with this shampoo and I plan on buying a couple of more bottles here in the next few months.  I also love how there is a 100% money back guarantee which I guarantee you wont need because this stuff is magical.</li>
    <li> I got this shampoo as a sample as LOVED it so much I needed to get it in full size. It is light in consistency but is very hydrating! Love it!</li>
    <li> Best shampoo ever for a dry, scaly, flaky scalp! Tried so many things on my daughter&#x27;s scalp, but nothing ever worked. With just one use, my daughter&#x27;s scalp is 90% better! Might not work for everyone but definitely worth a try...especially for the price!</li>
    <li> My hair felt much better after just the first application. Honestly, I took 3 days just to make sure that the shampoo actually is as effective as it was after the first application. And, I am glad it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells great, it is very economic. I have tried way pricier shampoo than this one but none of them were able to control the moisture as it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Excellent shampoo. I thought I had dundruff but I never saw how that was possible without any greasiness in my hair. The anti-dundruff shampoo was even worse, so nothing really worked and I was not finding a solution. After some research I discovered that my problem was not caused by regular dundruff, it was due to my superdry scalp, what was causing my skin up there to die and &amp;#34;flake&amp;#34;. I tried this amazing shampoo, and it works so good. It really moistures my scalp and my hair looks healthier. No more ugly flakes on my shoulders. Highly recommended if your problem is dry scalp.</li>
    <li> Stripped my red hair color.</li>
    <li> i have a dry scalp ,dandruf and red soaring spots on my scalp  and decided to stop using the regular harming shampoo .i was lucky to order this shampoo .this helped a lot and when i ran ot of it had to use the regular shampoo for ten days and started having my problems again . thanks god i got the order today .this is a very calming shampoo ..i recommend for dry scalp</li>
    <li> Unfortunately my husband didn&#x27;t like the product</li>
    <li> I have dry color processed hair that required ironing everyday. Ever since I started using this shampoo, I have barely any frizz if any at all and my hair is super shiny and healthy. My hair is also thin and oily. It has not made my hair flat or oilier than usual. My scalp is not itchy. I am very happy with this product and will continue to repurchase. I found my HG shampoo.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this shampoo for those who have struggled with thick, coarse hair and dandruff.  For years I have searched for a shampoo that would allow my daughter to manage her dry flaky scalp and unruly hair.  This is the first product to do it well!  it has a nice fresh scent and you only need to use a quarter-sized amount.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my pre-teen daughter.  She has been experiencing very dry scalp with large skin flakes and itchy areas.  She has been using this shampoo for about a week and a half and there is a noticeable difference in the texture of her hair.  Her hair looks healthier and the itching and flaking are starting to decrease.  Though it’s a little expensive, I feel good knowing she’s getting an all-natural product to help with her dry scalp.</li>
    <li> I started using Maple Holistics shampoo this winter because my scalp was unbelievably itchy and nothing seemed to make it better, including a visit to the dermatologist.  I started using the Sage shampoo, loved the way it made my hair look and feel, but it didn&#x27;t help the itch much.  Next, I tried the Degrease, which again, was awesome but my head was still a little itchy (though not as much).  Thought I&#x27;d try one more time and opted for Hydrate.  Turns out, my scalp was dry and this made me feel much better!  It smells nice, lathers really well, and makes my hair look amazing.  I would recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> I recommend this product really works</li>
    <li> Definitely helps my flaking and it has a pleasant smell without being too overpowering.  A little expensive but if you&#x27;re dealing with dry scalp, its worth a try.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. You don&#x27;t need to use much, a very little amount is enough for long hair. Pleasant smell. Cleans hair well, doesn&#x27;t feel dry.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo!  I have a very dry scalp that flakes and itches constantly.  Since using this shampoo, that has gotten tons better.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now, washing every other day.  I didn&#x27;t find that it leaves my hair dry at all.  Quite the opposite.  My hair is actually softer and less frizzy looking.  Love that it&#x27;s all natural.  Smell is awful, but isn&#x27;t wonderful either.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Its a mild shampoo and you can actually feel a difference when you use it a few times. My hair became soft and easy to maintain.</li>
    <li> I used to get the Maple Holistics sage shampoo, which I enjoy quite a bit, because I had some sore places on my scalp, but my hair is very dry and I thought I&#x27;d try this.  I am delighted with it.  It smells a good bit like the sage, too-- sort of like my Russian sage bush, to tell you the truth, a little strong but not unpleasant.  I let it sit a few minutes while I shave or something, then rinse, the scent doesn&#x27;t linger. The sores and flakes have not returned, and this, together with the conditioner, make my hair problems a thing of the past.</li>
    <li> i justl love love love this product! my hair is beautiful now!</li>
    <li> I have terrible issues with my dry and flaky scalp.  I have tired every dandruff shampoo.  I have even tried medicated shampoos from my doctor.  nothing ever eliminated the problem.  saw this on amazon and emailed the company.  they were so nice and sent me a small sample bottle to try.  in three days, my scalp was clean and flake free!  This stuff is SERIOUS!!  I immediately ordered the full size shampoo as well as one of their conditioners and it has made such a difference.  I don&#x27;t feel self conscious in public anymore or worry that someone will point out the nasty flakes  in my hair!  if you have a problem like mine, u seriously should try this stuff.  I love it.</li>
    <li> I am African American and have natural (4c hair) and extremely dry and flaky scalp.  I&#x27;ve tried this for the past 2 weeks as instructed and it keeps the flakes away for maybe 3 days.  Every other shampoo I&#x27;ve tried normally keeps my flakes away for only a day, so I guess the 1 or 2 extra day of non flaky scalp is the only positive about this shampoo.  I more than likely won&#x27;t be repurchasing this item again.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo for my daughter. She&#x27;s been using it for 2 weeks or so now and I haven&#x27;t noticed her itching. She has not complained about her scalp since using the shampoo.  She has said her scalp seems to be healing and not bothering her at all. I would recommend this to people with dry scalp.</li>
    <li> I always had dry hair and  itchy scalp. After using a couple times my hair feels much softer.  It just amazing!!!.  You do not need to use much, a very little amount goes a long way. And the smell pretty nice too.  Can not wait to recommend to my friends.</li>
    <li> My head was itching so bad for months when I first moved to Florida, probably because of the climate change from the northeast. This shampoo had me itch free in 2 weeks time (I wash every 2-3 days)</li>
    <li> Reading all the reviews, I really expected this product work wonders. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s been over a month and I really didn&#x27;t see any difference in my hair or dandruff in that matter. I never had dandruff and moved recently so my scalp was in need of hydration and thought this would cure my minor dandruff problems, instead my hair felt really coarse when using the product and no major or minor difference. Instead, I started using home remedies of apple cider and also once a week of coconut oil to keep my hair shiny and healthy. All I have to say, is that the home remedies surpass all my expectations and cheap.</li>
    <li> I use to add several drops of tea tree (essence) oil to my normal shampoo during hair cleaning process. Thus I&#x27;m (probably oddly) happy with the smell of this product. It resembles the smell of tea tree oil, and its effect similar too. Overall a satisfied purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a dozen different commercial options over the years and nothing ever made a dent. I gave this stuff a go and it made an immediate difference. My hair stylist says there are no longer any flakes visible. It does have a unique smell but I can live with that. I bought a second bottle to ensure I don&#x27;t run out. Wish the bottles were a bit larger. Also the price is very reasonable; I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m being robbed to solve this problem.</li>
    <li> I am so happy that I got this shampoo, it works so much better than expected. I did hear good things about this shampoo, but when I tried it on myself, I was blown away. It gets rid of my flaky scalp like nothing I have ever used before. And, the smell of the shampoo is so divine, I love the smell of my hair right after I get out of the shower, it is a fresh and clean smell that is fragrant, but not overpowering whatsoever. The shampoo also adds so much moisture to my hair but doesn&#x27;t make it look greasy which is super important to me. This product goes a long way too, so don&#x27;t worry about that. I use the smallest amount and it cleans my hair, keeps it smelling fresh for days and also softens and silkens my hair. This shampoo is truly amazing and I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful for my short, unmanageable, fine hair. The first time I used it I immediately realized the difference in both my hair and my scalp. This is the only shampoo I will be buying from now on. Thank you, Maple Holistics.</li>
    <li> I loved this product!! its great for frizzy and unmanageable hair!!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this shampoo.  The first time I used it, it made my hair feel odd, sort of all tangled, it wasn&#x27;t tangled, just felt that way, it didn&#x27;t feel soft &amp; slick like most shampoos make it feel, didn&#x27;t like that at all, but after rinsing &amp; repeating &amp; using the Silk 18 conditioner my hair turned out great.  I do not have a problem with dandruff, but I do have itchy scalp which this seems to be helping.  Excellent products from this company so far!!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have been having a serious issue with itchy scalp due to the dry, cold weather conditions and this has been amazing. My scalp has honestly never felt better!</li>
    <li> I have used other shampoos made by Maple Holistics and was very happy with them: decent price, nice results, long lasting. This is why I bought this shampoo for my father which has a flaking scalp and was asking me if I know a remedy for this issue. He was happy with this shampoo and said it managed to solve his scalp skin issues.</li>
    <li> Hair has never felt so clean and shiny!  Great shampoo for dry, damaged hair.  Very moisturizing and helps with frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> I liked the shampoo and it seemed to help with the dry scalp.  My hair is really a mess, very dry and brittle.  I have a thyroid condition which is probably why and am seeing a specialist in 2 weeks so we will go from there but the shampoo is really good.  I&#x27;ll write back after I&#x27;ve used it several more times.</li>
    <li> I looked for a while before settling on this. I decided to go organic/natural/healthier for products that I can control.  Plus, my head was so dry and itchy, it felt like I was on fire.  Store bought shampoos were not doing the job.  My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t find this sooner.  I have used this product for 5 days and my head and hair feel great. Even after day 1, I could tell a difference.  I love the smell of the shampoo too. A faint earthy smell that you can&#x27;t smell unless you put your nose close to the product.  I don&#x27;t rinse and repeat like the directions say to, my hair is not long enough for that.  I don&#x27;t shampoo after I exercise and my head still feel great from my morning shower.  The only thing....I wish the bottle was clear so you could tell how much is left.  But only using a little drop of shampoo, the bottle should last a while.</li>
    <li> I know its for dry flaky hair but that&#x27;s not why I use it. I don&#x27;t have dry flaky hair but I have thin hair. This makes my hair seem fuller and absolutely makes it look better. My son got it for me and I decided that it was too expensive and would not replace it when I ran out. But when I ran out I changed my mind. I had to have it, but perhaps it won&#x27;t be used every day, [just when I want my hair to look especially good.]</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it as directed, massaging the scalp and rinsing with cold water. So far it works better than other shampoos that I tried. First 2 days after washing my hair it looks great, I can barely see a few flakes. After the second day my scalp start to dry again, and the flakes starts to appear. It depends on how often you wash your hair too.  Overall is a good shampoo, I will order again.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my boyfriend and it started working almost immediately.</li>
    <li> I bought this product as a gift for my wife. She really loves this product. It really helped her with her flaking scalp.</li>
    <li> I have an occasional issue with my hair that goes by seasons/weather, heaven knows why. All my life I thought that my problem was described as dandruff, but dandruff shampoos weren&#x27;t making the cut. My condition is not very bad or extreme, it&#x27;s just that when my hair dries out and frizzes some white powder starts snowing from it, and it gets very itchy as well. I am a man with medium-long straight-curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve saw on Amazon, this company called Maple Holistics that was getting a lot of good reviews by users, so I contacted them and asked for a solution. I was advised to try the Shampoo for Dry Hair, and let me tell you.... It worked! unlike hundreds of other options, it doesn&#x27;t smell bad, it is not thick and sticky, and is actually very cheap!&lt;br /&gt;I use it every other day, and helps my hair be clean, smell nice, and be away from all that white powder that annoys me so much....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Maple Holistics, thanks.</li>
    <li> Not bad if you want to go the organic route cleand up the flakes but not the ichy scalp that i was hopeing for if you stop use for a day my symptoms came back not bad but not the best .</li>
    <li> Moisturizes my hair like nothing else. Lavender is a proven anti-fungal (which creates dandruff). This combines lavender along with jojoba and almond oils for supreme moisturization / elimination of dandruff flakes. Works!!</li>
    <li> My scalp really sheds skin and it gets embarrassing since my hair is a bit short and I prefer a bald cut. this really helps in keeping my scalp healthy so that it does not get damaged.</li>
    <li> I previously purchased the Sage shampoo from Maple Holistics, as I have a chemical sensitivity and cannot use products with synthetic chemicals or fragrances, and struggle with scalp psoraisis.  It gave me great results.  Once satisfied with one product from a company, I am always more open to trying other new products, and was looking for something that provided the same, all-natural benefits, but was designed to be more moisturizing.  I have long hair that has a tendency to get dry at the ends, and live in a cold-weather state with harsh conditions indoors and out for many months of the year.  I really like the Hydrate shampoo as well.  It makes my hair soft, manageable, and shiny.  It also has helped to diminish the psoraisis scars evident on the back of my neck.  I am very happy with this company and believe they manufacture effective, high-quality products, and accurately represent them for sale.</li>
    <li> From the first use I had no flakes. This shampoo makes my hair feel clean and makes my scalp flake free. It&#x27;s a great product that I intend to buy again and again. I can&#x27;t wait to try the conditioner!</li>
    <li> So far so good!  I often have a very dry scalp and wanted to use a natural shampoo that would address this problem besides Tea Tree shampoo which dries my hair out. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple weeks and it&#x27;s been working it&#x27;s magic. The longer I use it, the better my scalp gets. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Hasn&#x27;t helped with my itchy scalp</li>
    <li> I have used Maple Holistics Shampoo for Dry Hair and Flaking Scalp for 2 months now.  I really do think it makes a difference.  I know that my hair feels slightly thicker and my scalp is no longer itchy!  I will continue to use the shampoo, though about once a week I do use a conditioner on my hair as well.</li>
    <li> Dealing with dry scalp for years and I have tried a number of products , mostly catering towards dandruff (head and shoulders, selsun blue, etc) since i didn&#x27;t really know any better. I purchased this shampoo and started noticing a difference after about a week of using it... less itching and scalp flakes. It is not completely gone, but it is definitely much better than before which is a win in my book.</li>
    <li> I have only used it once and I already see a difference! I have never used shampoo that made my scalp FEEL good!! It is amazing! I have horribly dry, brittle and tangled hair... I am just speechless with this product! No more tangles!!</li>
    <li> I was suffering from a bit of seasonal dry scalp and decided on a bit of advice passed down by my late grandmother to try an organic shampoo. I am SO happy I tried this one. Although it does smell quite herbal, it works even better than shelf brands like Head &amp; Shoulders, which I personally had no luck with. No more embarrassing flakes on my black shirts! My hair feels, looks and smells great after combining this shampoo with the silk protein conditioner also by Maple Holistics. I will definitely be buying this again.</li>
    <li> I got a sample from the website and my hair is soft but this made my hair 10 times softer I am going to order the big bottle next week I live it.</li>
    <li> I love Maple Holistic products, and this product doesn&#x27;t disappoint. This definitely helps my dry scalp that creeps up during the dry months of winter. It is also very gentle for my over processed hair. Using this with their Silk 18 conditioner I have the best hair I have had since before I started using curling irons/blow dryers/straightening irons daily.</li>
    <li> I am familiar with Homepathic medicines, so when I found this product I was very excited.  It is wonderful.  Thank you very much.</li>
    <li> I have had dry scalp for a long time, I could tell a difference the first week of using this shampoo. I use it as directed but don&#x27;t shampoo everyday, been using it for a few weeks now, so far it has worked great!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how well this stuff works! It only took a couple of time washing for me to really see a difference. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Shampoo for a week and my hair is super soft.  I still have little dry scalp but i hope it goes away completely as i continue to use Shampoo along with the Conditioners.  I have tried so many Shampoos for dry scalp and since im allergic to Sulfates i decided to try this one and im very satisfied with results.</li>
    <li> I was in search of healthy shampoo and Maple Holistics matched my criteria. After one use my hair feels great!</li>
    <li> This is the second Maple Holistics shampoo I have tried and I really like it.  I think it a deep cleanse and I only use their shampoos 1-2 times a week as I use another No poo cleanser the other days (i wash every other day).  I have shoulder length, fine, swavy hair.  I follow up with the Silk 18 conditioner - it is the best!  This shampoo cleanses really well and does not make hair feel stripped.  It may feel a bit dry but with conditioner I feel cleansed with out feeling like my scalp has been stripped and my hair has nice slip.  Highly recommend Maple Holistics.</li>
    <li> Smells nice, feels nice, does absolutely nothing for my dry and itchy scalp. I found that it did not improve my scalp at all and I have stopped using it. I don&#x27;t have dandruff or anything, but I do have an itchy and dry scalp. It didn&#x27;t help.</li>
    <li> I love this Shampoo. I am really glad i tried it! It helped with my dry hair, plus the shipping was fast too. You cant beat that! I will continue to use it. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I recently got a very short haircut and my scalp soon became very dry, itchy, and flakey. I live in very cold weather so keeping my skin hydrated in the cold winter months is very hard. After 2 days of using this product my scalp felt SO much better! It is no longer itchy or flakey! I love this and will keep on purchasing and using this product! I also really like that is doesn&#x27;t have much sent to it, but it is a very fresh and clean feeling.</li>
    <li> Best hair product I&#x27;ve used to date and it&#x27;s natural! Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> This product worked for me and smells nice without being to strong.</li>
    <li> Excellent! I tried many different shampoos before this and this was the only one that helped with the flaking. I always thought I had dandruff but turns out it it was dry scalp. This shampoo smells like lavender and lathers wonderfully! Would buy again and again</li>
    <li> Bought this product to combat the heavy flaking, and it works wonders! Better than any other product and leaves my hair super silky smooth! It is unscented, however does have a little bit of a medicinal smell to it, however when combined with the silk 18 conditioner, it is just perfect!</li>
    <li> The package arrived on time and product was intact! This is the creamiest shampoo ever! you can feel the moisture in your hands before you put it on your scalp!</li>
    <li> I purchased the Hydrate Shampoo and Silk 18 Conditioner to treat long standing issues of dry hair and a very itchy, dry scalp.  My curly, dry hair is colored, highlighted, and treated with keratin, so I need to find products without sulfates and sodium chloride.  Also, I tend to have sensitive skin and scalp, so I try to buy natural, organic products whenever possible.  I have only used the products once and I have found some relief for my dry scalp.  My hair is very soft after only the one use.  I hope to have continued success with the products and hopefully eliminate the dry, itchy scalp condition that is so bothersome!</li>
    <li> This is the best product i have tried for my flaky scalp due to Seborrheic Dermatitis. It smells great! It&#x27;s not medicinal smelling. It has a nice lavender scent.  Great for my fine medium length hair.</li>
    <li> Seems to be helping my itchy scalp. Also makes my hair soft. I will keep using it. I like that it is gentle. Smells goo too.</li>
    <li> Tried this out of desperation because I have itchy dry scalp - especially the area right around my face. I had tried natural remedies like tea tree, ACV, olive oil and coconut oil.  Nothing really seemed to help especially because I can&#x27;t go without washing my hair everyday.  The first time I used the shampoo my scalp felt great and I was able to go 2 days without washing my hair!  However, the same results haven&#x27;t kept up although I suspect that I have not swapped out conditioners yet.  I still think my scalp is feeling better and less itchy than before, there are definitely less flakes when I do have to scratch! But now, I&#x27;m planning to try this in conjunction with the Maple Holistics conditioner and hope that it gets even better!</li>
    <li> My hair was dry &amp; split end, but s after washing my hair with the shampoo my hair is shinny and healthy, glad I found this for dry brittle hair which I have no more, it is manageable &amp; in good condition.</li>
    <li> Keeps my hair moisturized, but has a REALLY strong smell in my opinion. I also use Maple Holistics conditioner which seems to cover up the smell for me.</li>
    <li> After chemotherapy, it seems like this is a good product.</li>
    <li> Smells very nice, and has a silky texture to it.&lt;br /&gt;Only small amount needed, dot the size of a nickel.&lt;br /&gt;Was effective on my dry scalp problem.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizing shampoo, and compared to other products, requires less shampoo per wash.  Anxious to try other products by this company.  Would be glad to see larger bottles available at lower price per ounce.</li>
    <li> I really liked this shampoo.  I paired it with their Silk 18 Conditioner.</li>
    <li> well they left out the &#x27;sulfates&#x27;  but they added about 67 odd sounding weird things. The product smells HORRIBLE!  2 of the added ingredients were almond oil &amp; parsley seed, but they were far down on the list. I would rather smell the almond oil, even parsley-- I am NOT even using this on my dog ! so sorry, I love online shopping but my last few purchases  did not please me.  Time for me to rest. bye bye</li>
    <li> I had VERY dry hair and i tried so many different thing&#x27;s some of witch worked a bit but not a real solution.&lt;br /&gt;This is helping tremendously! A real life saver for me . my hair is looking better and better. i also started punting it in my hair and letting it sit for like 10 minutes, i think that helps too.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice much the first couple times I used the shampoo, but after that;  WOW! I work in surgery and have to wear a get for 12 hours a day, the hats leave my scalp near my hairline so dry and nothing helped until I used this shampoo. It smells good too, I&#x27;d recommend to anyone</li>
    <li> Can I give this brand 10 stars? I used this together with the Silk 18 conditioner, which i absolutely love, love, love, and my (long, straight, fine) hair is hydrated , silky and as smooth as if though I had flat-ironbed it, but without being the slightes bit greasy or weighed down! What a miracle! Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it. This will be my absolute go-to brand from now on, and believe me, I&#x27;ve tried a lot of other brands.</li>
    <li> I had received a free sample of this shampoo is a 2oz bottle. It didn&#x27;t smell like strong lavender, which is fine, but it did, however, smell like dog shampoo. I used it the day I got it, and was surprised by the outcome. My hair, usually dry and itchy, actually felt pretty soothed from all the scratching I do. I break out to a LOT of beauty and bath products because my skin is so sensitive. So far I have not broken out yet! The slight smell is an even payout for the soothing and nonabrasive result this shampoo gives!</li>
    <li> So this weird thing happened in my twenties where my middle eastern thick curly hair started to fall out in chunks (along with a whole host of other things, like adult acne?! Come on!) - I also had itcy, dry scalp, flakes for some time that went away and big cystic pimples on my scalp.  I have tried everything!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the time I started this shampoo I did not have flakes anymore just an itchy, dry scalp with a lot of hair coming out in the shower everyday.  This shampoo smells fine, gives a nice lather and a VERY CLEAN feeling.  I&#x27;ve been washing my hair everyday ever since I could remember, but I am trying to wash it every other day. This shampoo cleans my roots and allows me to skip a day of washing.  I also have not had an itchy scalp and only a couple of scalp pimples.  My hair was getting to the point where my curls would just stick to my face and I just had limp, lifeless curly hair.  It looks so awkward.  This shampoo while is not working miracles, gives me a little more volume and &amp;#34;oomf&amp;#34; that is reminiscent of my old hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It is expensive but I only use it once in the shower, twice if I do a hot oil treatment before it.</li>
    <li> Horrible product. Holistc my a&amp;@! I used it once. Use it now for the dog</li>
    <li> I have only used this once, and already can tell that my search for the perfect shampoo is finally over! My hair is baby fine, with a dry flaky scalp, and dry ends, that needs to be washed daily otherwise it turns into an oily mess. I realize the issue is lack of moisture in my products, and this product definitely delivers! I also purchased the Silk18 conditioner, and the combo of these two have left my hair more manageable, shiny and soft than ever before. The natural ingredients, cruelty free policy, and reviews are what originally sold me, but this product actually does what it claims and then some. Thank you Maple Holistics, I will be a customer for life. :)</li>
    <li> Very good shampoo for dry scalp. Expensive but worth it.</li>
    <li> This stuff does exactly what it claims to. My scalp gets dry and itchy in the winter. Washing it with this stuff not only calmed my scalp down, but also made my hair feel amazing. It also is the only shampoo I have ever used that actually feels like it all comes out when you rinse. I&#x27;ve already reordered.</li>
    <li> I still have dry itchy scalp even after using this product a few times. I can say it&#x27;s not as bad as it used to be. I will reorder and try again.</li>
    <li> good bubbles, nice smell, no itching all day long, I really do like it!  I do use conditioner with it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s for a good price being that it is organic, the shampoo does smell nice and it adds volume to my hair (not sure how it works for everyone), very happy with it.</li>
    <li> this soap is the best in the world. This can be used everyday or every other day. will leave your hair perfectly balance.</li>
    <li> I did not receive this bottle of shampoo.  Instead I received a gentle shampoo that did not meet my needs.  It was in a white bottle and looks nothing like the picture shown here.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> this shampoo is amazing I have been using it for a little over 2 weeks and I already can tell a difference! I will be buying more shampoo by maple holistics I think they make the best shampoo!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had dandruff before, until I started using this. I&#x27;m on a hunt for an organic shampoo that doesn&#x27;t make my hair really greasy or really dry. I need a medium! It does feel really clean, but the itchy scalp kills me. I itch my head all day. I only wash my hair once every 2-3 days too and it&#x27;s hard to do with this! I don&#x27;t know how everyone else has such good luck!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using natural shampoos off and on for awhile now. I noticed the low rated reviews mentioned losing a lot of hair and that&#x27;s actually normal when you switch to natural shampoos. I even heard that it&#x27;s a good thing, but don&#x27;t quote me on this! I have thick hair, so when I lose hair when using this shampoo, it doesn&#x27;t bother me. Now, if I were losing clumps and gaining bald spots...then obviously something would be wrong!    The smell of this shampoo is ok, not chemical-y. It doesn&#x27;t lather a lot like &#x27;normal&#x27; shampoos, but it does a little bit and I appreciate that because since I have thick hair, it reaches all parts of my head so I don&#x27;t have to do a second wash (I&#x27;m trying to use as little as possible since the bottle isn&#x27;t fairly large to begin with). The direction says to do a second wash, but I find that I don&#x27;t need to.    It leaves my hair looking normal - which I like. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair or cause it to look limp.    The flakes from my dry scalp is still there, but I haven&#x27;t really had any bad breakouts since using this shampoo. Therefore, the flakes have been minimal. I plan to use coconut oil prior to using this shampoo to see what the results are.    Overall, this is a good shampoo and I&#x27;m hoping it stays consistent.</li>
    <li> I have tried this shampoo for a couple of weeks now and unfortunately it did not make any difference to my scalp problems.  The shampoo itself smelt great and my hair felt soft, but the irritation and flaking scalp remained the same - in fact it got a little worse and when applying the shampoo I could feel it stinging my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the hunt for another shampoo :(</li>
    <li> I was so excited to find this product.  I have had dry scalp for years and always hated to use the medicated shampoos as they felt rough on my hair and the second I stopped using them it would get worse.  I loved the feeling of this shampoo, it didn&#x27;t feel like I was soaking my head in chemicals.  Only 4 stars because the ingredient list does seem less natural than some other shampoos I have tried, even though this once seems to help my scalp a bit more.  Hard to tell if some of the ingredients on the back are natural or not.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo for my sensitive dry scalp! I have been looking high and low for a good natural alternative for dandruff control. Since I am not able to use much tea tree on my scalp, this is a great solution for me. The shampoo leaves my hair soft, and my scalp very calm. I have not noticed any itching, or flaking. I am so happy to have found this company, and really excited to try more of their products.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is as great as the previous one that I bought (argan). It is smooth and has a mild scent. My son (8) said before that the Argan shampoo was HIS because it does not bother his eyes. Now he wants this one to be HIS.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I really love the fact that this shampoo is sulfate free but lathers very nicely.  The scent is so nice - natural and subtle.  I&#x27;ve also used it on my babies hair and both my kiddos come out with fresh soft hair even without conditioner.  This is a keeper!</li>
    <li> Great Product. Water quality in my home is pretty bad and hair used to flakes with almost every shampoo I have tried. Since I started using this shampoo hair is soft and manageable. Strongly recommend this shampoo</li>
    <li> I live in a very dry climate in the long Winter. I have been searching for a shampoo that wouldn&#x27;t strip the color out of my hair like the commercial shampoos do. My hair is still damaged from a bleached ombre over the summer as well as just having dry hair and dry, flaky, itchy scalp plus year round frizz galore!! This shampoo changed my hair in 1 wash! It did itch a little while I let it sit on my head. I washed my hair twice and it has a nice, natural smell. My head is not itchy, there are no flakes, but the frizzy mop? It&#x27;s soft and silky! I actually don&#x27;t know what to do with it. My hair is half the size and I can see all the layers I cut into it. Amazing!&lt;br /&gt;The 1st time I was using it, I was so surprised how soapy and foamy it was, it was like it expanded on my head! All I could think of was when Brad Pitt and Ed Norton were stealing the fat from the Plastic Surgery clinic in Fight Club to make soap and then I thought well if these people are as hot as Brad was in that movie, I&#x27;m officially a lifer!! Ha!&lt;br /&gt;I wash my hair 2-3x/wk, so 2nd wash and I&#x27;m not disappointed, no oily scalp, no itch, no flakes just really soft, silky hair that has maintained the color. I&#x27;m happy and I dug out my copy of Fight Club. Thanks Maple Holistics!!</li>
    <li> This shampoo does the main thing what I want. It relieved my itchy scalp. A bit pricey, but so is trying a dozen different products. I tried Selson Blue, T/Gel, T/Sal and their generic versions of these as well as some other products out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I dislike is there is no store I can go pick it up so I have to monitor how long it takes to use this so I can place a recurring order.</li>
    <li> My hair was really dried out and I had some flaking on my scalp, I tried the Maple Holistic Shampoo and noticed a huge difference. It was not heavy and did not leave my hair greasy. I loved that it was all natural. Great product.</li>
    <li> I have suffered from flaky scalp and dandruff for about 2 years. I use head and shoulders for my dandruff but nothing ever worked for my flaky scalp. So I decided to try this shampoo by Maple Holistics. I was weary at first because there are all kinds of shampoos on the markets claiming to hydrate and none ever did the job, until now. This shampoo really relieves the flaking and moisturizers my scalp and hair to make my skin hydrated and not dry. The weather right now has especially made my scalp worse, but this shampoo fixed the problem. So glad I found it!</li>
    <li> I only tried this once but it really made my hair and scalp feel soft after one use. I can only imagine how great it would be after several uses.</li>
    <li> i have been using this product for a few months now and i love it. my scalp feels so healthy and my hair smells so good and feels much healthier. I will continue using these products. Customer service is wonderful too.</li>
    <li> I just recently bought this to help with my husband&#x27;s dry scalp.  He has only used it once, but he absolutely loves it!  He says his scalp feels better already!</li>
    <li> Good cleanser for almost any hair type.</li>
    <li> This shampoo left my hair silky, manageable, and moisturized. It also feels stronger and healthier. I didn&#x27;t have to use any conditioner afterwards. I highly recommend this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised with this product! I have had a dry and itchy scalp ever since I can remember and it has gotten worse over the last few years. This shampoo really helped- in just one wash. It also made my hair smooth and soft and it smells nice too. It is pricey but I would buy again!! I also want to try other products by this company.</li>
    <li> To start this review off, I have very thick hair. So dandruff has been a problem for me since my early teens. I&#x27;ve used just about every dandruff shampoo on the market (Selsun Blue, Head and Shoulders, Pert, even Prescription) and none have ever prevented dandruff with me. I stuck with Selsun Blue the longest because I had the least amount of flakes with its use. But still pretty flaky. Especially later in the day once the sweat from my job started accumulating. Upon receiving this shampoo I hoped its natural and no-harsh-chemical-additives ingredient list would help alleviate this problem. And I&#x27;ve got to say that within 2 weeks my hair is flake, itch, and sweat stank free! Heck within the first couple of washes I noticed an improvement. Also, because of the natural plant oils it&#x27;s really like a Shampoo + Conditioner. My scalp/hair had a healthy amount of moisture throughout the day. The shampoo is fragrance free, meaning no chemically added smells, but it does have a nice, clean scent to it which clung to my hair and scalp all day. And even that peculiar, sweaty hair smell that comes from a day of labor or skipping washes never reared its ugly head (confirmed by myself and my unwilling but surprised co-workers). I even let my non-dandruff roommate sample the shampoo for a couple of days and the he experienced the same effects. He just kept marveling at how clean his head felt. In all, this has been the most effective shampoo I&#x27;ve used and recommend it to anyone with dandruff, itchy scalp, or likes clean, moisturized scalp and hair. Best part: It&#x27;s All- Natural! Five Stars!</li>
    <li> I have suffered from dry scalp/dandruff for 15 years and now I don&#x27;t have to be embarrassed of my hair in public anymore.  This product has diminshided this health issue a lot. I will certaibly be a regular for it.</li>
    <li> I was intrigued by this because it was supposed to be free of all those chemicals that all the anti-dandruff shampoos have. My hair tends to get pretty oily these days so I don&#x27;t usually even need conditioner. The first time I used it, it was fine.The scent is a bit odd though - it smells like mint but not quite. A few more uses later, I was not impressed, in fact, I was kind of disappointed. I not only had an itchier scalp, drier hair, but residue (and yes, I followed the instructions on the bottle closely). I&#x27;m sure these results aren&#x27;t guaranteed and you&#x27;re more likely to have a better turnout. I would love a 2-in-1 anti-dandruff shampoo/conditioner that&#x27;s like a natural head and shoulders..but haven&#x27;t found anything that fits the bill just yet.</li>
    <li> This shampoo works well, and it delivered really quick.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I tend to have tons of build up on my sculpt (I&#x27;m guessing from previous shampoos, conditioners, and products over time) and nothing seemed to get rid of it. At first, I was a little skeptical, as one always is when purchasing something new, but after the first use I could almost feel my sculpt finally getting a chance to breathe and I could see the build up and flakes rinsing down the drain. Whaaat?! I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes when I saw this and brushed my hair later one, seeing that all the flakes and build up was gone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the beginning, I used it everyday because I have really oily hair and it needs to be washed everyday. But after a while I found that it keeps my hair cleaner for longer, and now I&#x27;ve gone down to using it about 3 times a week to keep that build up from all the hair spray I use away!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A bonus: It smells amazing!! And the ingredients are all super good for you hair as well.</li>
    <li> This is the only shampoo that has worked for my dry scalp. It took a few times to work but now it shows its quality. The only bad thing is that it&#x27;s expensive.</li>
    <li> I have very fine long hair and have always had a tender ,irritated, itchy but no real flaking head,especially in the dead of winter.I purchased this product and was so pleased with the results and the clean fresh natural scent.I am really into essential oils and when I am in the mood for say Spearmint scent I just add a few drops of essential oils into palm with this unique shampoo.I love the versatality of that option because the scent is natural and so are the essential oils.Also purchased on Amazon ,great prices and 100 % essential oils are available here!Moral with or without E.Oils my scalp does not itch or feel dry and irritated,even from a bobby pin! That is how sensitive my scalp is. I have yet to find any that compares.My hair and scalp just feel normal now and after all thats exactly the results I was looking for.I also love that I can change the scent with my many colorful moods! ha ha  Sincere Thanks ,Amazon and Maple Holitics Shampoo    Rachel Bata  January 7th,2015</li>
    <li> This is the best, best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I shave my head evey week, not sure if that&#x27;s why my head is very dry itchy and flaky But I do have a lot of dandruff. I have tried 3 different selsum blue and head an shoulders and they do not work for me. I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 days now and after day 1 my head  was not as itchy and flaky. Now after day 3 my head does not itch at all. The flaky is not as bad as before i started using the shampoo but is has only been 3 days. This product is worth the money to me.</li>
    <li> There is something too pasty and thick about the texture of this shampoo. I could never get what felt like clean hair out of this bottle, so I won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
    <li> This is good for a dry scalp. I would like to fully endorse it as a quality product. It has a lovely smell as well, and the lavender just smells great.</li>
    <li> Hair actually felt drier and more unmanageable. Product smelled awful to me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a review leaver, but I felt compelled to share the positives.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a week and a half and there is a marked difference in the hydration of my scalp.  It feels better, looks better and in turn I feel better and look better.  My hair is left feeling clean and smooth with no residue, which I appreciate as I have color treated hair.  I intend to continue to use this shampoo as I&#x27;ve tried countless others at 3x the cost, tried the DIY scalp masks, the oils, the professional treatments and nothing was consistent.  Finally!</li>
    <li> This product is excellent.  It effectively cleans the hair and scalp but doesn&#x27;t leave it frizzy and dry like just about every other shampoo that I&#x27;ve tried.  I like how gentle it is for sensitive skin/scalp whereas many drugstore shampoos are too harsh.  This product is nurturing to dry, flaky scalp.</li>
    <li> I have used this shampoo twice now.  It seemed to lather better the second time I used it. I believe I used a little more than the first time. My hair felt squeaky clean but not dry.  It has a pleasant light scent. I feel like my hair is back on track to getting healthy. Also, I normally have an itchy scalp by the end of the day and if I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday. I did not have any itchiness on the second day.</li>
    <li> I received a generous size 2oz sample of this shampoo from Maple Holistics, enough to try for about two weeks. I was hoping it would help my dry scalp issues, but so far not yet, but since I&#x27;ve tried so many things and nothing has helped I will say I&#x27;m not surprised. I do not leave it on three minutes as I&#x27;m usually in a hurry in the morning. Three minutes plus another few more minutes for conditioner and I&#x27;m out of hot shower water to rinse. As far as my hair itself goes, this product does a nice job on my fine hair, it&#x27;s gentle and has only a slight scent that I really can&#x27;t pinpoint but I like it and it leaves my hair shiner than usual. The lavender, carrot, parsely are at the very bottom of the ingredient list and the rest of the ingredients have very long names, six beginning with the word sodium, so I really can&#x27;t tell if this actually &amp;#34;holistic&amp;#34; as it seems to be full of the same ingredients as most shampoos, though no parabens.  I would probably purchase this again as I like the way my hair looks, but am still on the never ending search for a cure for dry scalp!</li>
    <li> My hair is flat and lifeless using this. My hair also started to fall out, can&#x27;t say if it was from this or what, but I had to stop using this.</li>
    <li> Difficult to rinse out of your hair</li>
    <li> Works better than others, but is not a magic cure all.  It is less drying than the pharmacy shampoo my doctor gave me.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described. My Scalp was really clean and no more itching and dandruff</li>
    <li> Used this at my girlfriends house first. I swim 3 to 4 days a week, and this is perfect for the dry hair created by the chlorine and other chemicals. Past few days she&#x27;s mentioned how soft my hair has been (the little I have left). She doesn&#x27;t even realize she&#x27;s been contributing to it. Very good stuff if other chemicals are destroying your scalp. Recommend highly.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome shampoo, a little goes a long way. I&#x27;ve used a lot of different shampoos and this is by far my favorite. I wash my hair everyday and it doesn&#x27;t dry it out, it&#x27;s always full of body and shiny. And it smells good too. Often times when you use a shampoo everyday your hair will get used to it and then just go flat or not look as good, not so with this shampoo. And it has none of the bad ingredients either, what you put on your skin goes into your body so getting something natural was important for me. I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;d be sorry with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I have had a lot of trouble with my scalp over the last 3 years or more, especially in the summer. My scalp itches, I get little sores, and I feel to much of my hair falls out. My hair is wavey.I had been seeing a dermatologist who ruled out everything and said it was neurological. I have tried a lot of special shampoos including prescribed shampoos and conditioners Over the past 3 years. I was surfing on Amazon and ran across this all natural shampoo.  What the heck I said to my self and ordered this shampoo. I have been using it for about a month. I have to say I was impressed the first time I used the shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed was this shampoo did not strip my hair. When I dried and then combed my hair it was manageable. I also noticed my scalp did not itch as much! The second time I washed my hair I noticed I did not have any sores in my scalp and the itch was gone.When I combed my hair very little hair fell out. At this time my scalp is still calm and very little hair is falling out. I no longer suffer and will never use any othe hair product except those from Maple Holistics. Try it. I think you to will be happy with this product Just as I am.</li>
    <li> I have more dandruff than ever.</li>
    <li> this shampoo made my hair very soft. my hair is normally very frizzy but this shampoo got rid of the frizz.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had skin problems for several years and have tried all types of commercial, organic, and rx solutions;even high end &amp;#34;natural salon&amp;#34;products. This is the first shampoo I&#x27;ve tried in years that seems to be working. I&#x27;m about 1/2 through the bottle and it has reduced or eliminated some of my more troubling scalp issues.  If I order a second bottle I&#x27;ll change it to 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Gentle shampoo that I have been using for a year. Won&#x27;t be using any other after this.</li>
    <li> I really loved this shampoo. I use it with a conditioner but alone it makes my hair super soft and hydrates my scalp.</li>
    <li> For real, this works great, I&#x27;m glad I followed my friend&#x27;s tip.</li>
    <li> I had been using a product that had left my hair dry and my scalp was super flaky all the time.  I thought it was just me, but I gave this shampoo a try-- knowing that my problem was not dandruff but dry flaky scalp.  After a couple times I seriously did not have the itchy flaky scalp anymore!  I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks and my scalp feels healthy again!  The shampoo is so worth the price.  I also have tried the silk conditioner and my hair has never felt so healthy and soft after a wash.  So glad I found this on amazon.  Love how it&#x27;s natural as well!  I tend to use only natural products for my hair with not much success as salon quality unnatural products.  The results with these  maple holistics products is up to par as salon quality.</li>
    <li> i like this one better than the ARGAN version. its infused with Botanical Keratin which makes my hair look thicker and fuller. it also hydrates my scalp which helps in cell growth.</li>
    <li> I tried this shampoo to try a natural way of getting rid of flakes because I am breastfeeding, so far it has been great . It makes my hair soft and my flaking has signifagnyly disappeared. It does way my hair down either. I paired it with the silk conditioner and that is also great and smells incredible with a hint of vanilla. I absolutely recommend this product and will continue to use it. Very satisfied :)</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see any difference.&lt;br /&gt;I still have dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;gotta find something else for me..</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband, and tried it myself the other day. I have extremely sensitive skin, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of shampoos hoping to find one that won&#x27;t make me itch, turn red, get dry patches or sprout bumps, or all of the above.  This is only the second shampoo I&#x27;ve found that gave me no issues at all, and you can imagine how happy that made me. It made my hair super soft, and slightly more resistant to the dreaded post-pony tail rubber-band crease. Plus, it felt clean for an extra day, and it didn&#x27;t take very much product to shampoo. The only issue I have is that it&#x27;s perhaps too hydrating . . . my hair and scalp are neither oily nor dry, and this is a bit more than I need for daily use. I will definitely try other products from this line to find the perfect poo for me. My husband likes it too. &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> This shampoo is so great on my dry scalp!  I don&#x27;t have any itching anymore, and it keeps my hair clean longer than store shampoo.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo I have used till now. I have a really itchy scalp with dandruff and I have tried so many different shampoos (regular, ayurvedic, prescribed). None of them are close to this one. The reason I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 stars is because I am still in review mode. I have been using it for the last 30 days and I can clearly see the difference. Itchiness is gone, hair looks more fuller, and no dandruff. I will definitely keep on using it. I have also ordered the &amp;#34;Sage Shampoo for Heavy Dandruff with Jojoba, Argan, and Organic Spikenard&amp;#34; to find out which one suits my hair better.&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased that I bought this product.&lt;br /&gt;P.S I read it somewhere there is a ingredient in regular shampoos (don&#x27;t remember the chemical name) that generates foam but that is harmful to your hair. This shampoo being completely natural doesn&#x27;t seem to have the foam causing ingredient</li>
    <li> Best shampoo I ever used and I used them all. Does not strip the hair dry and does not over condition causing limp hair. I have fine hair.</li>
    <li> Not good for me, my hair dry  when I used it becomes dry more and I can&#x27;t camping my hair even put Conditioner</li>
    <li> It really made a difference! I was hesitant to spend $16 on a bottle of shampoo, but my hair &amp; scalp are not doing too well in this Midwest weather (sitting in heated room all day doesn&#x27;t help either), so I decided to give this a shot. After a couple of washes, I noticed a pretty significant difference: my hair feels lighter &amp; no longer weighed down, and my scalp is no longer itchy from the dryness. Will keep buying from Maple Holistics!</li>
    <li> It made my sensitive scalp itch, surprisingly.  I switched to KMS and now have no problems.</li>
    <li> I have used another shampoo from this seller as well. This is one is even better. My hair is easy to comb after using this shampoo. Furthermore, my hair went from dry to smooth and silky clean thanks to this shampoo. This is definitely the kind of product that I would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair feel soft and has really reduced the itching scalp. Comes with a business card-size list of tips for haircare that are actually helpful and the shampoo smells good. I use it with the silk18 conditioner (which smells really good, too). I have frizzy hair and this combo tames it. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Wow.  You don&#x27;t need a lot of this super shampoo.  The scent is subtle and nice and it&#x27;s super foamy</li>
    <li> Been using this product for about 3 days now and I have to say that so far it works! only issues I have had is that it comes in such a small bottle for the price, but with how well its working, I really can&#x27;t complain too much!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a Caucasian woman with very thin, very fine hair. I&#x27;ve struggled with dry scalp for about 2 years now. We&#x27;re talking my own personal snowstorm on my shoulders / back constantly. Big, flaky pieces of scalp. It was gross; sorry to be so blunt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After two uses, I&#x27;m down to very few tiny flakes. I finally have hope I can get a handle on this. I&#x27;m using the Hydrate Shampoo and the Silk 18 condition from Maple Holistics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Previously, I&#x27;d be flake-free for about  8 hours then return to the blizzard. My hair is silky, soft, and smells yummy! The Silk conditioner has a vanilla sweet that is very light; not overpowering at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also using a shampoo brush to thoroughly remove any excess plaques from my scalp.</li>
    <li> I noticed a huge improvement the first time I used this product.  I have tried countless shampoos, including some recomended by the hair stylists, and this is the only 1 that gave excellent results. I don&#x27;t remember the last time my hair looked this good.</li>
    <li> This shampo feels really good and does calm my scalp. I&#x27;ve only been using it about 3 weeks and so far so good. I will purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> Having curly hair an not the best diet in the world has caused my hair to be a bit more then just a mess, it&#x27;s gotten more then just dry, my hairs end up splitting and have even noticed a slight bit of dandruff but ended up helping it quite a bit by applying this shampoo like I normally would instead of my usual one. An have noticed a tremendous difference in the quality of my hair. It no longer looks dry and horrible but nice and sleek with a bit of life to it.</li>
    <li> After weeks of searching, I think that I found the right shampoo for me.  My hair is long, fine, and pretty much all gray, which it tends to be dry.  But this year I&#x27;ve been having problems with my scalp being dry and itchy.  It&#x27;s not flaking, just dry, and my hair has been so frizzy.  So after searching on Amazon, I happened to notice Maple Holistics shampoo, although it was a different kind.  Anyway, I decided to go to their website and contact them.  They truly are very informative and helpful.  I explained my hair and scalp problem, but the person told me that they might have a better product for my particular problem.  So they sent me three samples.  I&#x27;ve just tried the Hydrate last night, and my hair felt like silk.  It still feels silky today.  Even my husband was impressed.  Right after I put it on for the first wash, I could tell that it made my scalp feel much better.  Then I tried the Silk 18 conditioner sample that was sent to me.  I like it, too.  I think that I left it on about two minutes in the shower.  Well, I will be ordering the Hydrate shampoo and Silk 18 conditioner.  Now I have one more sample to try, the Sage shampoo.  If it&#x27;s as good as the Hydrate, we might have to have that one as well.  One more thing that I am impressed with, the company will help you with any questions at any time.  It seems that they truly care about their fine products and their customers.</li>
    <li> All my life my hair has been dry and bushy. I&#x27;ve always thought it was the type of hair I have and there was nothing I could do about it. But Recently a friend got me into the whole holistic thing. She convinced me to start using only all natural products and she told me to use this shampoo and the silk 18 conditioner. And my hair has literally changed to a silky, smooth and shiny hair. By far the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used. I have than recommended to other friends and they&#x27;ve had the same results.</li>
    <li> The shampoo hydrates well and leaves hair feeling clean. It&#x27;s not difficult to lather either, unlike many other natural shampoos.</li>
    <li> I used it for about a week. My scalp was super-itchy before, and the shampoo did take care of this. There were fewer flakes but I cannot say they were all gone. However, my hair got super tangled and was not as curly as it usually is so I would definitely recommend using a conditioner with this product.</li>
    <li> A tad pricey for only 8 ounces of shampoo. Washing twice as recommended with long hair means I would have to buy this about once a month (to 5 weeks). I had tried dandruff shampoos for my dry, itchy scalp and they weren&#x27;t helping. So far this seems to work okay. No more crazy itching. I wash as recommended with the card that came with the shampoo which stated to use cool/cold water to close the pores when rinsing. Cool water is also more gentle on your hair. My scalp was still a little itchy, but not as bad as before. I have come to suspect I have a reaction to sulfates so I switched to a sulfate-free shampoo. Bonus is it&#x27;s only $6 and now no itching at all.</li>
    <li> The shampoo is okay. I found that my hair was dryer after using this shampoo regardless of what conditioner I used in conjunction with it. I&#x27;m going to use this as my back up bottle of shampoo until it&#x27;s gone because I refuse to throw it out after paying $17 for it. I just won&#x27;t purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I have thick wavy hair and dry sensitive scalp. Tried lots of products and very happy to have found this one. Makes my hair and scalp feel clean and refreshed, not dry and irritated. Keeps the unruly texture of my hair under control, and also smells good. Would reccomend. Was glad to hear it is now sulfate-free too. Check out Maple Holistics Website for more information too.</li>
    <li> THIS IS SOME GOOD SHAMPOO, I LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> For the past few months I&#x27;ve suffered with a dry scalp. It has gotten so bad at times that it would appear as if it was snowing from my scalp if I ran my hands back and forth in my hair quickly. I&#x27;ve tried several shampoos with no success and as a result have lately resulted to not wearing dark shirts or suits to keep from being embarrassed. From my research I was able to determine that this was not dandruff but a dry scalp. On a whim I ran across Maple Holistics and after reading several of the positive reviews about healing dried scalps I decided to try it. I have had the product for just about three weeks and I will honestly say in the first week I noticed a noticeable difference in the amount of flakes and today after 3 weeks I can run my fingers through my hair and not notice a flake! The shampoo is expensive but it lathers nicely so not very much is needed about a nickle to quarter size for my hair length of a few inches. I will not buy products tested on animals and I headed on over to Maple Holistics website where I read that their products were cruelty free. This is information is absent from the bottle. Had I saw this in a salon I would have put it down thinking it was not cruelty free.</li>
    <li> Used the product for 3 days and already my head has stopped being Itchy. I bought this as I have been a long time head and shoulders user and wanted to try something more natural to see if it worked. So far so good and a very decent price.</li>
    <li> After trying many different shampoos for my dry and itchy scalp, I searched Amazon and found this product. I was pleased with the other reviews and decided to order it. After only a few uses, I noticed that my scalp was less itchy and I had fewer flakes on my scalp. I have been using the product for a few weeks now and continue to love it! I also love that it is a natural product at a great price point!</li>
    <li> I am always more open to trying other new products, and was looking for something that provided the same, all-natural benefits, but was designed to be more moisturizing.I really like this product because it&#x27;s so light on my hair. It leaves absolutely no build-up and you can really tell that your hair is squeaky clean.</li>
    <li> Started to notice a difference on day one and I only have to use it every every 2-3 days to keep my scalp healthy and hair looking good. Although, I wish I&#x27;d have known that this company has a sls free version of this shampoo before I bought this one, I&#x27;m going to try that one out next.</li>
    <li> I have dry scalp near my forehead and wash my hair about twice a week (this is all my hair needs). This product has seemed to make my dry scalp much better, but hasn&#x27;t cleared it up yet. I have only used it a couple time though so hope it clears up with time (I am pretty sure I am allergic to sulfates). It definitely has improved my condition.</li>
    <li> So far so good. I&#x27;ve been alternating between this shampoo and Whole Foods&#x27; 360 brand. It definitely makes my head feel less itchy on days I use it but I&#x27;m not 100% sold on the way my hair feels the next day (a little dry, I think?). I&#x27;ll keep trying it and see and probably will switch to using it every day for a bit. For reference, my hair is too oily to not shampoo every day, but I&#x27;ve found that many shampoos dry it out too much to use every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I remember reading some negative thoughts regarding the smell. I really love the smell — it&#x27;s incredibly herbal and most strongly smells like lavender. I don&#x27;t think it lingers exceptionally long but I kind of wish it did.</li>
    <li> This is good when your hair is always exposed to the sun. This helps keep it in its normal, healthy state.</li>
    <li> Had a very dry scalp and dry hair. this helped a lot. i can now wear a black suite without a worry  about  having dandruff on the shoulders .&lt;br /&gt;i recommend this !</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my sister. She said she likes it and she thinks it has given her hair a bit more volume. We are both in our 70&#x27;s so volume doesn&#x27;t hurt!!</li>
    <li> The shampoo is okay. It reduces scalp flaking to some extent but doesn&#x27;t do much to take care of itchiness. Earlier I was using head and shoulders 2 in 1 hair endurance shampoo for men and that kept the scalp clean and I never had any scalp flaking or itchiness but that shampoo was harsh on hair as it left them brittle and my hair color started changing from from dark black to brown and besides it has a lot of non-natural ingredients. That&#x27;s why I decided to try this one. My hair color has returned back to normal but the scalp itchy now with a bit of flakiness.</li>
    <li> I have dry scalp. During winter, my scalp looks like i have dandruff. I tried so many products before trying this. After using this shampoo for a few weeks, i did not have to hid my dry scalp with hair oil any more,</li>
    <li> I used to have problems with dry scalp. I&#x27;ve tried many remedies and shampoos. started using this product along with their Sage shampoo and i haven&#x27;t had a problem since. itching is down to a very minimum and my dryness is almost completely gone, this is in a two month period. would recommend this product to anyone with scalp problems in a heart beat.</li>
    <li> Me - male, 60s, fine hair that starts out dry in the morning and becomes greasy by the end of the day. Plagued with dry scalp and associated scalp blemishes especially in winter.  Was using a DHC product that was good but very expensive and it was eventually discontinued. Received a sample of Maple Holistics Hydrate Shampoo to try and was pleasantly surprised at the great smell and good lather. Hair looks great and scalp not so dry anymore. I&#x27;m sold!</li>
    <li> Smells nice and is highly concentrated so you don&#x27;t need to use a lot but this did no better than any other shampoo for me. Left my scalp dry and flaky. I normally have a very dry scalp so you may have better results if yours isn&#x27;t as bad as mine.</li>
    <li> Love this product ! great for my type of hair keep my hair from being dry and brittle and also does not way down my hair like other product I have used</li>
    <li> This products works great for my hair during the winter months when my hair and scalp are most dry. I can&#x27;t wait to try the other kinds of Maple Holistics!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a month thanks to a friend that gave me this product as a gift! I love the way it makes my hair feel so much softer.It is so easy to apply and I love the fact that I can put it in and style my hair and Im ready in a jiffy! It smells great and works great so its a win win smells great and works great!</li>
    <li> This is unconditionally the best shampoo I have ever used for dry hair and scalp. For years I&#x27;ve suffered with dry, frizzy hair and constant, winter dandruff. About 2 months ago I began using this product with Silk 18 and my hair has transformed into how it was 30 years ago( now 65). It has a sweet, natural smell and gentle, cleansing abiliity to leave my hair feeling clean, smooth and light. I recommend HYDRATE wholeheartedly without reservation for anyone wanting a gentle, healing, moisturizing shampoo.</li>
    <li> Fantastic shampoo- revitalizes scalp &amp; gives gloss to hair  w/o leaving any residue behind. And smells great. And is entirely non-toxic &#x3D; i  so happy I found this shampoo! Will use always!</li>
    <li> Not surprisingly, this is an excellent companion product to their Sage shampoo. It lathers profusely, so a little goes a long way, and leaves your hair looking and feeling great. By alternating the two, I feel like I am giving my hair AND scalp the best of both worlds. Quality natural ingredients, and made in the USA;  can&#x27;t beat that!</li>
    <li> I noticed a difference from the first time I used this product.  It makes my hair fuller and richer.  I will be re ordering.  You only need a small amount of shampoo to wash your hair.</li>
    <li> This is, by far, the best shampoo I&#x27;ve every purchased. Cured my incredibly dry scalp. No more embarrassment.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo! I have oily hair with dry scalp which is a very weird combination. Have been using it for a few weeks now and my hair feels great. There is no more irritation of my scalp either. Love the fact that its organic and fragrance free! Definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for about a week, and I can already tell the difference in my hair and scalp.  I normally get a dry, itchy scalp during the winter, and my fine hair is pretty prone to frizz.  This shampoo took care of my dry scalp and, when used with a conditioner, helped give my hair a silkier texture.  Another plus: the shampoo has a clean, minty smell to it.  Love this product!</li>
    <li> I have been using Hydrate for several months, I can&#x27;t believe the difference in my hair. No more flakes, shiny, more managable. I have my whole family using this product.</li>
    <li> I had hoped it would make my dry hair soft, shiny and hydrated, but it really didn&#x27;t.  I also don&#x27;t care much for the smell.  I do however LOVE the Silk 18 conditioner this company makes.  It&#x27;s fantastic for dry hair.  I wish they made a shampoo that was more like the Silk 18 conditioner, with the same scent.  Update: I just called the manufacturer to ask if they had another shampoo they might recommend and I was so shocked that they offered to send me a bottle of another shampoo for free because I didn&#x27;t care for this one!  Now THAT&#x27;S customer service!  Well Done!</li>
    <li> I bought this hoping it would relieve my dry scalp and my scalp has seemed healthier since I started using it, but I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s because of this product or something else I&#x27;ve been trying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this product anyway because it&#x27;s so light on my hair. It leaves absolutely no build-up and you can really tell that your hair is squeaky clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update this review after I get to use this product for a while longer and can honestly give a review on its effect on my dry scalp.</li>
    <li> I would not recommend this product to anyone.  After two shampoos, I was loosing too much hair in my brush every time I ran it through my hair.</li>
    <li> I started using Maple Holistics products a few months ago and have recommended this line to all my friends and family. I absolutely love the way my hair looks, feels and smells. I bought my first items (Winter Blend Shampoo and Natural Silk18 Conditioner) just after New Year and just now needed to replenish so it lasts a good long time! I&#x27;m happy to say the Shampoo for Dry Hair is just as wonderful! I can&#x27;t imagine using any other hair product!</li>
    <li> I tried this shampoo looking for something that would cleanse the buildup off of my scalp without drying it out too much. The smell was very fresh and natural however I had to use a lot of the product to get rich lather. I was worried when my hair started to feel very tangled after rinsing but after a small amount of conditioner my hair was just as managable as after washing with my old shampoo. After I dried my hair it felt very soft and light. My scalp was not itchy and most of the build up from my old shampoo was gone. I have yet to rewash after three days. I would highly recommend this product!</li>
