      <li>Very comfortable</li>
      <li>I also love the fact that it has handles.</li>

      <li>citrus- in the overwhelming, pine sol, industrial cleaning product way.</li>
      <li>Everyone needs one or more of this comfort wrap.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s fantastic!  </li>
      <li>There really is something very comforting about the moist heat that works great!  </li>
      <li>It was great, but got grungy pretty quickly</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s fine, but could be better.</li>
      <li>These don&#x27;t really heat up as good as me or my mom</li>
      <li>I often heat it up and use it in bed, kind of a like a drug free, pain-relieving hot water bottle.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is very soft and smells good.</li>
      <li>I was kind of expecting a little more, but it&#x27;s an OK item for the most part !</li>
      <li>I gave this as a gift because I love mine so much!!</li>
      <li>I dug this out and was delighted to find the offending scent had completely dissipated.</li>
      <li>love the smell of it; it really IS warming and soothing.</li>
      <li>Glad I don&#x27;t have a reason to use this much</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m one of twelve and thanks to buying these microwavable neck warmers I am once again her favorite son.</li>
      <li>First as a lot of people said it smells strongly, I don&#x27;t mind the smell</li>
      <li>my mom is lucky she likes the smell</li>
      <li>It does hold the heat nicely, so I can back to work with this on my</li>
      <li>couple years back, I started using it to warm the foot of my bed</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
      <li>When I originally received this wrap as a gift five years ago, from someone who found it indispensable in fighting migraines, I set it aside due to the strong Rosemary scent (I can&#x27;t do aromatherapy.</li>
      <li>it has a comforting lavender/chamomile smell and heats readily in the microwave for about 2 min for ample relaxation of shoulder/neck muscles (more recently), and not a bad DIY wrap for my knee as well at the time.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t walk away from the microwave, and it feels hot...</li>
      <li>Two or more can be used at the same time to relieve all the achy spots.  </li>
      <li>Longer heat pack - more versatile for wrapping different locations&lt;</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice having 2 of these because you can heat one up while using the other and keep alternating them.</li>
      <li>microwave, btw, is very high tech and heats things up to the hot end of the spectrum.</li>
      <li>i was in dire need of something for a bum knee last year and purchased this at whole foods since it seemed to fit the bill.</li>
      <li>Sometimes I drape it around my neck to sooth muscle pains from too much computer work.</li>
      <li>The warmth it brings on a cold winter evening is delicious.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>The one thing that really got me was the smell...</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used it for relaxing sore muscles after skiing or running, sciatica, runner&#x27;s knee, as a warm compress for a sty on my eye, a neck wrap, to warm my chest when I have a cold ...</li>
      <li>What I don&#x27;t really like is the fact that the little beads inside, or whatever they are, are very compact, and they don&#x27;t spread very easily.</li>
      <li>i have one of these and a big back hot pad for my back, and we&#x27;re all good.</li>
      <li>This reminds me when I was a young child, my mom use to purchase rice wraps in pretty fabrics at the mall kiosks.</li>
      <li>When I first got this as a gift, I was sort of taken aback because I thought it was something for old people.  </li>
      <li>Yes, they do have a smell to them, so see if the non-scented ones are available if you are sensitive to such things.</li>
      <li>/&gt;You throw it in the microwave for two minutes on high.</li>
      <li>but this thing HOLDS the smell for a SUPER long time...</li>
      <li>To clarify, just about any other person might enjoy how the new wrap smelled, but my sinuses are super sensitive (due to a sibling constantly burning incense in the house).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
      <li>Even the scent stayed until the very end with my last Earth Therapeutics</li>
      <li>- personally I can&#x27;t stand too much of it and have to get away from her while she uses it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;An injury to my back answered that question really fast.</li>
      <li>This wrap is one of the few things that quickly and effortlessly relieves my neck and lower back</li>
      <li>I generally use it on my lower back or neck/shoulder area for soreness</li>

<li> ummm, not really.</li>

<li> Cold or Hot</li>
<li> a little chilly.&lt;br</li>

<li> It comes with a LOT of warnings, but IMHO, you just use common sense.</li>
<li> These things are seriously relaxing.</li>
<li> Seriously.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a little weird but bearable.</li>
<li> Going back to amazon :(</li>
<li> It&#x27;s really not great.  </li>
<li> Also I play cricket game every weekend, sometimes my legs are sore after the game.</li>
<li> would still buy these again, despite the weird scent.</li>
<li> You guys have it all wrong.</li>
<li> Can also be placed in the freezer for use as a cold pack</li>
<li> I like it cold to ease a muscle or bruise.  </li>
<li> Very disappointing.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> so i didn&#x27;t buy this on amazon. i was in dire need of something for a bum knee last year and purchased this at whole foods since it seemed to fit the bill. it has a comforting lavender/chamomile smell and heats readily in the microwave for about 2 min for ample relaxation of shoulder/neck muscles (more recently), and not a bad DIY wrap for my knee as well at the time. i have one of these and a big back hot pad for my back, and we&#x27;re all good. the scent will probably dissipate over time but i imagine the therapeutic properties should be good for another couple years yet.&lt;br /&gt;4 stars because i think that my heating pad for my back tends to stay hot longer than this one, but this one isn&#x27;t too bad, either.</li>
    <li> Great product -- smells wonderful (like lavender), and the heat feels amazing on your neck. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This comfort wrap soothes and eases pains in the neck, lower back, shoulder blades, and elsewhere.  So it cuts down or out the need for pain medication.  The warmth it brings on a cold winter evening is delicious.  If you like your comfort, you will like this comfort wrap.  Also, it&#x27;s easy to take with you!  When I head out the door to do errands and am having a rough day with neck pain, I simply wear the comfort wrap as I go.  I take it with me also on trips.  Two or more can be used at the same time to relieve all the achy spots.  Everyone needs one or more of this comfort wrap.  It&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Use one and shared one.  Cold or Hot - I like the moist heat.  I like it cold to ease a muscle or bruise.  Glad I don&#x27;t have a reason to use this much but, when I do I grab this out of the 4 different ones I have at home.</li>
    <li> These things are seriously relaxing. After my wife has a long day, I&#x27;ll just heat one up and put it around her neck. They&#x27;re so nice!</li>
    <li> This is a nice product, however...I only recieved one, the description says it&#x27;s a two pack. And the one I did get had a big stain on it...so I returned it. Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> You guys have it all wrong. These things totally smell like fruit loops! It&#x27;s a little weird but bearable. The wrap works well.</li>
    <li> Everyone deservers one of these for that pain in your neck or anywhere.I gave this as a gift because I love mine so much!!</li>
    <li> When I originally received this wrap as a gift five years ago, from someone who found it indispensable in fighting migraines, I set it aside due to the strong Rosemary scent (I can&#x27;t do aromatherapy. Ack) and had every intention of re-gifting it. To clarify, just about any other person might enjoy how the new wrap smelled, but my sinuses are super sensitive (due to a sibling constantly burning incense in the house).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when a crazy string of physical impairments set-in about a year later, I needed to apply alternating ice and heat. I dug this out and was delighted to find the offending scent had completely dissipated. Just a 90-second stint in the microwave, then let the rice mix top-to-bottom a couple times to even the heat throughout, and it&#x27;s SO nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple years back, I started using it to warm the foot of my bed so I could get comfortable enough to fall asleep after ice-water foot baths, when my feet were so cold, I couldn&#x27;t fall asleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still use it for dry contrast therapy on my ankles and feet as needed for chronic ligament and tendon problems. I&#x27;ve now used the wrap from neck to foot over the years and would never want to be without one for even one day. Seriously. It goes with on vacations!</li>
    <li> I tried finding a product like this everywhere locally, but couldn&#x27;t find a store with it.  It has a pleasant smell and is an awesome heat-pack.  It&#x27;s nice having 2 of these because you can heat one up while using the other and keep alternating them.</li>
    <li> Was gift.  Receipient liked</li>
    <li> When I first got this as a gift, I was sort of taken aback because I thought it was something for old people.  Then I tried it.  Oh my goodness, it is sooooo wonderfully relaxing and soothing.  I&#x27;ve used it to help me fall asleep.  There really is something very comforting about the moist heat that works great!  I even bring it on vacation with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it for relaxing sore muscles after skiing or running, sciatica, runner&#x27;s knee, as a warm compress for a sty on my eye, a neck wrap, to warm my chest when I have a cold ... it&#x27;s fantastic!  Sometimes I will even use two at the same time, one around my neck and another for shin splints.</li>
    <li> I was kind of expecting a little more, but it&#x27;s an OK item for the most part ! Getting 2 was a good bonus, I think. These don&#x27;t really heat up as good as me or my mom thought they would, but with repeated microwave sessions - they&#x27;re alright I guess. The one thing that really got me was the smell... yes the lavender and Chamomile is a nice smell but this thing HOLDS the smell for a SUPER long time... it&#x27;s been about 2 months and they still (dare I say it...) REEK of it&#x27;s sent... my mom is lucky she likes the smell - personally I can&#x27;t stand too much of it and have to get away from her while she uses it. The smell does not fill a room but you notice it once you get closer.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product September 8th, they didnt ship it till September 12th and by the tracking information I should be receiving this product today or tomorrow, which is September 19th, or 20th. If I had known it would take this long, I would have bought from a diferent seller.</li>
    <li> I swear by these. I can&#x27;t make it through my lady issues without them. I use a chip clip to hold it in place around my waist. Yes, they do have a smell to them, so see if the non-scented ones are available if you are sensitive to such things. I am not, and the smell is totally gone after a year of use.</li>
    <li> I got an Earth Therapeutics wrap several years ago as a gift, and I thought, what am I going to do with this?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An injury to my back answered that question really fast. This wrap is one of the few things that quickly and effortlessly relieves my neck and lower back pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the smell of it; it really IS warming and soothing. It&#x27;s so pleasant I often heat it up and use it in bed, kind of a like a drug free, pain-relieving hot water bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You throw it in the microwave for two minutes on high. It comes with a LOT of warnings, but IMHO, you just use common sense. Don&#x27;t walk away from the microwave, and it feels hot...it is!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My microwave, btw, is very high tech and heats things up to the hot end of the spectrum. But I like it very warm (so I don&#x27;t have to keep reheating it.) It does hold the heat nicely, so I can back to work with this on my back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two attached handles make short work of carrying it to the chair where you&#x27;re going to use the wrap. Sometimes I drape it around my neck to sooth muscle pains from too much computer work. I often just bunch it up to a spot on my lower back and wedge it between the seat and my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The velvety cover is washable, which is a nice touch. It comes with a plastic bag with a snap so you can store it, but I use mine so often, a storage bag is almost superfluous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I&#x27;d say is that the last one I had, I used for a few years. The instructions now say you can wear it out...ummm, not really. Even the scent stayed until the very end with my last Earth Therapeutics wrap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But that&#x27;s all good. As long as they keep offering this, I&#x27;m going to stock up!</li>
    <li> This reminds me when I was a young child, my mom use to purchase rice wraps in pretty fabrics at the mall kiosks. This chamomile sent smells lovely and helps me unwind after work. Also, the wrap combined with heat helps relieves my shoulder tension, and puts me into a nice state to fall asleep in.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m one of twelve and thanks to buying these microwavable neck warmers I am once again her favorite son. A fair price for a nice convenience-especially in colder climes.</li>
    <li> I keep getting neck pains this one comes handy. Also I play cricket game every weekend, sometimes my legs are sore after the game. I use it on my legs too. Very comfortable</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s fine, but could be better. First as a lot of people said it smells strongly, I don&#x27;t mind the smell but I can see how it can bug some people. What I don&#x27;t really like is the fact that the little beads inside, or whatever they are, are very compact, and they don&#x27;t spread very easily. they tend to slide from one side to the other and it&#x27;s hard to keep them on the neck for example.</li>
    <li> I am wearing my wrap as I write this, and I love it! It is very soft and smells good. The heat is so relaxing. I also love the fact that it has handles. Can&#x27;t beat price. This would make a great gift for anyone.</li>
    <li> I used to have a &amp;#34;bed buddy&amp;#34; microwavable heat pack that I used all the time.  It was great, but got grungy pretty quickly and I ultimately had to throw it away.  I was looking to order a replacement when I came across this brand. I generally use it on my lower back or neck/shoulder area for soreness but sometimes I will just use them if I&#x27;m feeling a little chilly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why I like these:&lt;br /&gt;- Removable, washable cover!&lt;br /&gt;- 2 pack - can use on multiple sore areas or give one as a gift&lt;br /&gt;- Softer cover&lt;br /&gt;- Longer heat pack - more versatile for wrapping different locations&lt;br /&gt;- You don&#x27;t need to be connected to a power source to use this (as you would with an electric heating pad).&lt;br /&gt;- Can also be placed in the freezer for use as a cold pack&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I&#x27;m not a huge fan of:&lt;br /&gt;- The &amp;#34;soothing&amp;#34; scent... It&#x27;s really not great.  I would have preferred an unscented variety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would still buy these again, despite the weird scent.</li>
    <li> If it wasn&#x27;t for the smell, i would have kept them.  they&#x27;re really soft, perfect size, and well packaged. However, I smell absolutely no lavender or chamomile, just citrus- in the overwhelming, pine sol, industrial cleaning product way. I think it would give me a headache if I used it heated. Going back to amazon :(</li>
    <li> This is NOT a pack of two. Excellent product, but I wanted one for me and one for a friend.</li>
