      <li>Great value for the money.</li>
      <li>I purchased the Essie Fall mini collection because I had heard a lot of great things about the polish.</li>
      <li>My all time favorite polish and the perfect size for traveling.</li>
      <li>But, I thought this would be an excellent way to try the polish without having to fork over a ton of money (getting the four colors instead of just one was a huge plus to me, as well).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Both birthday girls absolutely loved it.</li>
      <li>I received the package on time and in good condition.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t find any others that look as good as these</li>
      <li>These fall colors are gorgeous.</li>
      <li>It is really gorgeous.  </li>

      <li>Love the colors!</li>
      <li>The colors are really nice.</li>
      <li>Color choices are really nice.  </li>
      <li>This fall cube of Essie nail polishes is fantastic!</li>
      <li>love 2 of the 4 colors.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love the colors, and the mini sizes.</li>
      <li>The shipping was quick, and I liked the colors in this.  </li>
      <li>Look really nice and make awesome stocking stuffers as gifts, they are a good size not too small or too big</li>
      <li>And the Essie brand is one of my favorites for how it goes on smoothly.</li>
      <li>Great way to try new nail colors without spending too much money.  </li>
      <li>I loved the packaging and the variety—a cute little cube of high-quality polish in interesting, varied colors.</li>
      <li>I did not like most of the colors; I only liked the Cashmere Bathrobe and For the Twill of It.  </li>
      <li>who really uses more than this anyway?  </li>
      <li>I love the mini nail polishes because I never finish a whole bottle of nail polish anyway.</li>
      <li>I definitely plan to buy more colors with each season :)</li>
      <li>I currently live overseas and all these colors are a HUGE hit whenever I take them to the nail salon!</li>
      <li>They go on really nicely and last.</li>
      <li>I loved these colors, especially the bright pink one (which is not a color I normally would&#x27;ve considered for myself).</li>
      <li>(I&#x27;ve yet to find a regular polish that does), it glided on smoothly and lasted a good, long while on my toes.</li>
      <li>I love the minis because u get enough of the nail polish and don&#x27;t splurge on it too much</li>
      <li>I also love the grey teal color.  </li>
      <li>The bottles are a very decent size for the price.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried all 4 already, and I really like each and every one of these colors.</li>
      <li>They are the exact same formula of the full size bottles, all the greatness you can always expect from Essie.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I will continue to buy Essie brand polish - particularly this upcoming spring when it&#x27;s time to update my polish.</li>
      <li>Arrived in original packaging and the polish was not old.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I was pleasantly surprised with the polish.</li>
      <li>The dark silver &amp; the holographic color are just OK for me; I have lots of gray already, and the holo is not as pronounced as other holo colors I have.</li>
      <li>(sparkly grey -love &amp; sparkly dark grey -jury is still out).</li>
      <li>That hot pink color is the bomb diggity!  </li>
      <li>but my 23 yr old daughter loves the grey colors.</li>
      <li>Seriously, when is the last time you ever finished a full size bottle of polish anyway?</li>

    <li> I have never, in my life, finished an entire bottle of nail polish. I will use it a couple of times and then get sick of the color and put it in the drawer with the rest until I dispose of them.  When you get the minis you can use them a few times, for only a few bucks and not feel bad that you wasted polish.  I loved this color set!</li>
    <li> The colors are really nice. I love the minis because u get enough of the nail polish and don&#x27;t splurge on it too much</li>
    <li> So-so.added to my stash of colors.</li>
    <li> This is a great value and an awesome way to get to try out all the new colors. They are the exact same formula of the full size bottles, all the greatness you can always expect from Essie. These fall colors are gorgeous. I especially love the cashmere bathrobe. The bottles are a very decent size for the price. Seriously, when is the last time you ever finished a full size bottle of polish anyway? I definitely plan to buy more colors with each season :)</li>
    <li> I bought two of these for two separate birthday gifts. I loved the packaging and the variety—a cute little cube of high-quality polish in interesting, varied colors. Both birthday girls absolutely loved it.</li>

    <li> I currently live overseas and all these colors are a HUGE hit whenever I take them to the nail salon! I am so happy with the Essie Fall 2013 edition!</li>
    <li> Perfect size nail polish!  who really uses more than this anyway?  Between my friends and I, the shades appear to be universally flattering.</li>
    <li> That hot pink color is the bomb diggity!  It is really gorgeous.  I also love the grey teal color.  The dark silver &amp; the holographic color are just OK for me; I have lots of gray already, and the holo is not as pronounced as other holo colors I have.</li>
    <li> Love the colors! Stays on great! I do wish the they had their other Fall 2013 colors in mini as well.</li>
    <li> Look really nice and make awesome stocking stuffers as gifts, they are a good size not too small or too big</li>
    <li> The shipping was quick, and I liked the colors in this.  I bought this as a gift but I wish I had bought one for myself too.</li>
    <li> I did not like most of the colors; I only liked the Cashmere Bathrobe and For the Twill of It.  I received the package on time and in good condition.</li>
    <li> My all time favorite polish and the perfect size for traveling.</li>
    <li> Ordered these. And then got email telling me they are out of stock.</li>
    <li> Great way to try new nail colors without spending too much money.  Color choices are really nice.  I like it a lot.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find any others that look as good as these</li>
    <li> this product arrived on time and was as described. the bottles were small, but convenient if you dont paint your nails a lot. Arrived in original packaging and the polish was not old. Great colors.</li>
    <li> I bought this for me but my 23 yr old daughter loves the grey colors. They go on really nicely and last.</li>
    <li> love 2 of the 4 colors. 2 are very similar (sparkly grey -love &amp; sparkly dark grey -jury is still out). green is ok, still prefer &amp;#34;school of hard rocks&amp;#34; from a few winters ago. sparkly pink/purple is wonderful.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t wait for fall to come so I can wear these &amp;#34;fall&amp;#34; colors on my nails. Beautiful colors and 4 to minis to choose from.</li>
    <li> This fall cube of Essie nail polishes is fantastic! I absolutely love the colors, and the mini sizes. I&#x27;ve tried all 4 already, and I really like each and every one of these colors. Great value for the money.</li>
    <li> I love the mini nail polishes because I never finish a whole bottle of nail polish anyway. I loved these colors, especially the bright pink one (which is not a color I normally would&#x27;ve considered for myself). And the Essie brand is one of my favorites for how it goes on smoothly.</li>
