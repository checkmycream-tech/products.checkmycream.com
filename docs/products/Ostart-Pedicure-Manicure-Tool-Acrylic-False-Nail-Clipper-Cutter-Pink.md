      <li>Just what i needed..works great</li>
      <li>i was not expecting a good product for the price</li>

      <li>Great Item for doing your own acrylic nails.</li>
      <li>Great product cheap too.</li>
      <li>Perfect cut for my Acrylic and Real Nails</li>
      <li>Does a nice job.</li>
      <li>So cute and not flimsy at all.</li>
      <li>Does what it&#x27;s supposed to it made a nice clean cut</li>
      <li>Loved it at first, but broke after two weeks</li>
      <li>They cut crooked...not very impressed, more work to file nails down.</li>
      <li>The reason I gave them a 3 was because they do seem flimsy,like they are going to break easily.</li>
      <li>and i worked fine</li>
      <li>They seem cheap, feel cheap</li>
      <li>Not as nice in real life</li>
      <li>Cut great, ive only used them once do for.</li>
      <li>Not able to use it yet, but it looks like perfect condition.</li>
      <li>Super upsetting</li>
      <li>It felt a little wobbly but over happy i tried it on a couple of nails</li>
      <li>This nail clipper was great for the few months it lasted...</li>
      <li>Arrived on time, worth the purchase and wait.</li>
      <li>They were able to slice through smoothly which means they are sharp which was what I worried about when I first saw them in person.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to invest in a better quality product next time around</li>
      <li>I am still trying to get the almond shape cut with this tool but overall not bad.</li>
      <li>but it is sharp and cuts smooth.</li>
      <li>They get the job done, but feel a little cheap.</li>
      <li>Super sharp, would recommend.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I only wasted $2, but still... I could have spent the $20 for them at Sally&#x27;s and started using them right away.</li>
      <li>Need to do very little filing because the cut is so clean.</li>
      <li>Seems cheap but gets the job done...shipping was slow</li>

    <li> DON&#x27;T BUY!!! I waited 2 weeks for them to come in, and when they finally did come in, they were broken! They were bent up, and the blade was totally out of place. I couldn&#x27;t use them even if I tried. I&#x27;m glad I only wasted $2, but still... I could have spent the $20 for them at Sally&#x27;s and started using them right away. I was so angry!!</li>
    <li> Works great!  Super sharp, would recommend.</li>

    <li> They seem cheap, feel cheap but they get the job done well. I have only used them once and this is just for my acrylic nails.

But for now, this is a great product for my diy acrylic nails starter kit for my friend and I.</li>
    <li> Broke within two uses :(</li>
    <li> This nail clipper was great for the few months it lasted...then some of my nail glue got caught in it. The clippers got stuck and  they broke when I was trying to get them unstuck together. :( I&#x27;m going to invest in a better quality product next time around</li>

    <li> I only used it 2 times and it broke.</li>
    <li> Great product cheap too.</li>
