      <li>This product is great for acne!</li>
      <li>and it was awesome.</li>
      <li>great product...</li>
      <li>I decided to give it a shot and found it on Amazon at a great price.</li>
      <li>This works amazing well for me - best product I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;ve had acne for forty plus years.  </li>
      <li>Awesome product, bought more.</li>
      <li>It is an excellent product from a line of products that I love.</li>
      <li>I buy the 3-part kit and my skin has never looked so good - ever.  </li>
      <li>I have loved this product from the beginning.  </li>
      <li>Now, the catch is it comes from Greece which was fairly stated and that it would arrive within a month.  </li>
      <li>so I thought that it would be good for my skin - 30&#x27;s, oily, clogged pores.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not giving 5 stars, because I don&#x27;t think it works good for my skin</li>
      <li>/&gt;We are very pleased and will continue to purchase this product.  </li>
      <li>This is truly magic!  </li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>My skin looks amazing the day after I&#x27;ve applied it at night.  </li>
      <li>(I have seen it in a Walgreens) and it is an amazing product.</li>
      <li>She glows with gorgeous skin, and more importantly, she&#x27;s happy.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t find them as effective.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s own.  </li>
      <li>Love love love it!!</li>
      <li>Love Love Love this!  </li>
      <li>I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product!</li>
      <li>Very gently and mild, perfect for my combination skin.  </li>
      <li>dries my pimples right up and the smell is amazing!</li>
      <li>However for some reason I am more drawn to the US version because I can FEEL it working (reminds me of a chemical peel)</li>
      <li>More like spot treating.  </li>
      <li>The US is more like a spot treatment and the UK is for all over the face.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s and love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>voila, perfect for the next day.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried alot of skin products to prevent breakouts - most have been prescription and costly.  </li>
      <li>and I can see where its working on my skin better.</li>
      <li>CVS ran out of stock and the price offered online is better.  </li>
      <li>so by all means, I recommend this cream :)</li>
      <li>Effaclar K and Effaclar Mat have given me better results, for my acne prone skin</li>
      <li>I use this because my dermatology recommended,but I have to said that I prefer when is made in France is so much better like this one that I order  </li>
      <li>La Roche Posay Effacer Duo, is another good product for light acne skins, to help keep it clean and clear.&lt;br /&gt;it worked for me.</li>
      <li>Great facial cream!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great if you live in a hot, humid city like I do.  </li>
      <li>it does not work... make sure and buy the right effaclar duo...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a smooth and clean look/</li>
      <li>I was truly satisfied and I am definitely willing to do this again.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used the US one before and it is so much more effective than the European version.</li>
      <li>When it comes to this product, if you&#x27;ve got the right medication to go along with it, it will definitely help a great deal in treating your acne..</li>
      <li>Much better results and MUCH cheaper than the &amp;#34;seen on</li>
      <li>It made my skin blotchy and full of cystic acne and blackheads .</li>
      <li>Not bad</li>
      <li>I have tried sooo many products, and this is the only one where I&#x27;m SURE</li>
      <li>and it has cleared up my skin tremendously.</li>
      <li>It has helped somewhat with the clogged pores and I will probably repurchase it, but I really thought it would have been better for me with all the stellar reviews.</li>
      <li>Was made aware of it by a girl who works at our large local drug store (CVS), said she has been using it for years and her skin looks great.</li>
      <li>Definitely would recommend this to someone else-love it, love it!</li>
      <li>takes awhile to ship, but it is totally worth it to get your hands on this.</li>
      <li>I can use it allover my forehead, but on my cheeks where skin is more sensitive and thinner it reacted to.  </li>
      <li>soooo worth</li>
      <li>She gets depressed because kids make fun of her.  </li>
      <li>Plan on purchasing it again, but it seems like it should last a long time, so a very good value too.</li>
      <li>I like this product because I can use it right before puting my make up on.</li>
      <li>It stops break outs right away and minimizes redness.</li>
      <li>They warn their patients that it&#x27;s very strong, to apply it only at bedtime because it has bleach in it</li>
      <li>My daughter is 14 and gets large pustule pimples that appear quickly and stay forever.  </li>
      <li>By day 5 you are free and clear with skin like those makeup models!</li>
      <li>However be sure to buy the European version and NOT the US version.</li>
      <li>I ordered it before the first tube ran out so that I would not have a break in my treatment.</li>
      <li>and this is the first product that changed the texture of my skin in 3 days.</li>
      <li>After having acne problems for many years, I believe I&#x27;ve finally found the product that works.</li>
      <li>also it was the first time I had ever ordered something off of Amazon..</li>
      <li>Within 2 weeks of starting treatment, she saw 75% or better reduction in breakouts.  </li>
      <li>This Product came highly recommended regarding over-the-counter products that are worthy of purchasing.  </li>
      <li>To be fair, only my forehead needed it as my skin doesn&#x27;t exfoliate properly on</li>
      <li>The US one has 5.5 benzoyl peroxide and lactic acid (which is so much more effectivr with stronger ingredients) while the European one has niacinamide and other ingredients which is meant to be more gentler on the skin.</li>
      <li>Keeps my blackheads and pimples at bay, and my skin looks healthy ... not cracked and dry.</li>
      <li>and she hasn&#x27;t had a large pimple in 4 months of using this product.  </li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t be happier and will keep a large stock of this on hand.</li>
      <li>therefore I have certainly used it before..</li>
      <li>I could only use nourishing cleansing oil by grainier to clean my skin first....</li>
      <li>the ingredient that doesn&#x27;t irritate those of us with very sensitive skin is reduced to a very small molecular size so the absorption is great.</li>
      <li>This stuff really works.</li>
      <li>I hope my face heals fast.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m stressed out and getting the unusual pimple on my cheek and forehead</li>
      <li>It made me very disappoint.</li>
      <li>FAST</li>
      <li>so I can really vouch for its effectiveness.</li>
      <li>would recommend either version, but if you like gentle, then this is for you.</li>
      <li>but it is much milder, does not do almost anything to my skin.  </li>
      <li>I spent so much money on so many kinds of products.....</li>
      <li>i ordered this product by mistake thinking it was the DUO benzoil peroxide cream.. tried it anyways, and the first day i put it on, by the evening, i had 6 new pimples.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had acne,oily, sensitive skin my whole life.  </li>
      <li>It has helped reduce my pores, prevent breakouts and keeps your skin clear and free of excess oil all day long.  </li>
      <li>The US version is more harsh on the skin.</li>
      <li>All I can say is, if you&#x27;re brave enough to try it, you should try it on a small part of your skin, perhaps forehead, before bed, and certainly not the day before a hot date.</li>
      <li>Effaclar Duo made in France (not USA version) is the ONLY product that has consistently prevented breakouts of her cystic acne.  </li>
      <li>It absolutely, completely works!</li>
      <li>My first tube of this product made such a change in my completion.</li>
      <li>Former clogged pores clean out in daily shower like before, waaay fewer break-outs and cysts, goes on and disappears without oily residue.</li>
      <li>I have dry sensitive skin with mild acne and this product cleared my skin and has kept it clear ever since without drying it.</li>
      <li>This product does not seem to do much in the way of treating existing breakouts, but used regularly, prevents new break</li>
      <li>Keeps my acne prone skin clear.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought La Roche-Posay Effaclar Duo after my sister recommended it as a product that works.  I was skeptical since I have spent a ton of money on acne products for my daughter, both prescription and over the counter.  My daughter is 14 and gets large pustule pimples that appear quickly and stay forever.  She gets depressed because kids make fun of her.  After using this product in combination with their gel cleanser, her faced cleared up within a week and she hasn&#x27;t had a large pimple in 4 months of using this product.  She uses the Effaclar Duo 2x a day without fail and it has changed her life!  She glows with gorgeous skin, and more importantly, she&#x27;s happy.  This is truly magic!  (Not too over drying, either!)</li>
    <li> I like this product. I have always had acne problems and I have used several products.  I like this product because I can use it right before puting my make up on. It is not heavy and it keeps my face clear. For night time, I use someting else a little stronger to keep my acne under control.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried alot of skin products to prevent breakouts - most have been prescription and costly.  This Product came highly recommended regarding over-the-counter products that are worthy of purchasing.  I have loved this product from the beginning.  It has helped reduce my pores, prevent breakouts and keeps your skin clear and free of excess oil all day long.  It&#x27;s great if you live in a hot, humid city like I do.  I literally put about a dime size on my entire face and there is no oil or residue at the end of the day.</li>
    <li> I buy this product for my teenage son and he really likes it.  He has been using this product for 4 months and you can tell that it is doing it&#x27;s job.  Will order again and again.</li>
    <li> I can not live without this in my skincare routine. I have tried numerous times to substitute other skin care products for this one but nothing compares.</li>
    <li> This works amazing well for me - best product I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;ve had acne for forty plus years.  Much better results and MUCH cheaper than the &amp;#34;seen on TV&amp;#34; product with the horrible customer service.  I&#x27;m actually glad the customer service was so bad or I&#x27;d have never tried this product!  I buy the 3-part kit and my skin has never looked so good - ever.  Love love love it!!</li>
    <li> made me have acne I don&#x27;t know why</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t aware that effaclar duo came in two different versions, the US one and European one. This version is the European one which has different ingredients than the US one. The US one has 5.5 benzoyl peroxide and lactic acid (which is so much more effectivr with stronger ingredients) while the European one has niacinamide and other ingredients which is meant to be more gentler on the skin. I&#x27;ve used the US one before and it is so much more effective than the European version. After using the European one for a few days and noticed that it wasn&#x27;t doing anything on my hormonal cystic acne, I did some research and found that I over excitedly ordered the wrong product so I returned this item. Please do your research before buying, that way you can avoid this problem from occurring. Plus I spent $10 just to shipped this product back!!</li>
    <li> I use this because my dermatology recommended,but I have to said that I prefer when is made in France is so much better like this one that I order  and the services was excellent.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> My son was afflicted with horrible pimples as most teenagers are!  This product is a miracle because all his pimples go BYE BYE!  I used this product previously for my son before I bought it online so I can really vouch for its effectiveness. Why did I buy it online.  CVS ran out of stock and the price offered online is better.  Now, the catch is it comes from Greece which was fairly stated and that it would arrive within a month.  So buyers plan it out, like buy before it runs out because if the time it takes to arrive. I hope this review will help other buyers.</li>
    <li> i ordered this product by mistake thinking it was the DUO benzoil peroxide cream.. tried it anyways, and the first day i put it on, by the evening, i had 6 new pimples. continued to use it to see if it would change, but it didnt. instead of perfecting my face, it made it worse.</li>
    <li> Great facial cream! You can see results in a day!. Use sun block.</li>
    <li> It absolutely, completely works! Even if everything else before didn&#x27;t, don&#x27;t despair, this product will not let you down. Was made aware of it by a girl who works at our large local drug store (CVS), said she has been using it for years and her skin looks great. She said it&#x27;s for 2 reasons: 10 it doesn&#x27;t have the irritating ingredient most of these treatments do (I apologize, I cannot remember the name), and 2) the ingredient that doesn&#x27;t irritate those of us with very sensitive skin is reduced to a very small molecular size so the absorption is great. I&#x27;ve been using it a year now and here&#x27;s the skinny; you see some improvement (one thin application per day on clean skin), everyday it gets better. By day 5 you are free and clear with skin like those makeup models! The thing is though, you have to keep using it every, or every other, day (depending on your particular skin). If you stop, it comes back, and you&#x27;re wishing you had. But no worries! Wash your face well, reapply, (a little goes a l-o-n-g way), and viola! Within 4 or 5 days your skin is awesomely happy again, and so are you!</li>
    <li> BUYER BEWARE...THIS IS NOT THE ACNE GEL WITH BENZOL PEROXIDE..BEWARE BEFORE YOU BUY. READ OTHER REVIEWS..DO NOT WASTE $20 .</li>
    <li> I started with the Effaclar face wash and it was awesome. Very gently and mild, perfect for my combination skin.  Then I tried this stuff and together it&#x27;s made a big difference.  I went from the occasional blemish to hardly anything. It creates a matted look on your face, which I personally like.  It&#x27;s a smooth and clean look/feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is expensive, but I&#x27;ve had the same bottle for almost 4 months now.  A LITTLE bit goes a long way; its not a lotion.  Just a thin layer is enough.</li>
    <li> La Roche Posay Effacer Duo, is another good product for light acne skins, to help keep it clean and clear.&lt;br /&gt;it worked for me.</li>
    <li> I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product! I&#x27;ve had acne for 30 years and have tried everything from over the counter to dermatologist to Accutane. I finally decided I was going to have to just live with it. I bought this product and started taking Evening Primrose Oil and my acne has almost disappeared. I couldn&#x27;t be happier and will keep a large stock of this on hand. Buy it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I bought this in conjunction with the Effaclar Purifying Foaming gel cleanser. Now, this is the version made in France, but I have also tried the US version. I like them both, and they both seem to do the job of clearing up and healing any breakouts in practically no time. The French version does not feel like acid eating your skin away, and doesn&#x27;t give any sort of red reactions. However for some reason I am more drawn to the US version because I can FEEL it working (reminds me of a chemical peel) and I can see where its working on my skin better. I just put it on at night, and while I sleep all this goes away and voila, perfect for the next day.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend either version, but if you like gentle, then this is for you.</li>
    <li> Seriously, this stuff works.  Got rid of the blackheads that have plagued my nose for years.  Is a little drying but nothing that moisturizer can&#x27;t handle.  Keeps my acne prone skin clear.</li>
    <li> Product took forever to receive. Shipped from Greece, I should have known that but didn&#x27;t pay attention. But the big disappointment was that the French ingredients are not the same that is sold in the USA. I didn&#x27;t find them as effective.</li>
    <li> I have read and listened to a lot of reviews on this item so I thought that it would be good for my skin - 30&#x27;s, oily, clogged pores.  It has helped somewhat with the clogged pores and I will probably repurchase it, but I really thought it would have been better for me with all the stellar reviews.</li>
    <li> Never broke out as a teen, but at that time of the month I seem to have a few guest on my face that I cannot stand.  I started using this a week prior and it totally prevented that from happening.  I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s and love this stuff.  It has become a staple in my entourage of facial products!</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this product for my daughter who has had terrible acne since she turned around 16 years old.  Over the last 3 years, we have tried everything for her skin, Clarisonic, benzoyl peroxide, prescription medications, dietary changes, vitamins, antibiotic gels, cleansers, you name it.  Effaclar Duo made in France (not USA version) is the ONLY product that has consistently prevented breakouts of her cystic acne.  Within 2 weeks of starting treatment, she saw 75% or better reduction in breakouts.  This product does not seem to do much in the way of treating existing breakouts, but used regularly, prevents new break outs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are very pleased and will continue to purchase this product.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> i have a bad skin history.....extremely dry and sensitive skin any acne product would dry out my skin so bad and make it fire red and itchy I spent so much money on so many kinds of products.....how I used it. I could only use nourishing cleansing oil by grainier to clean my skin first....to me you have to use it religiously twice a day because at one point I just used it once a day and my acne came back but once I switched to twice my acne started to disappear within a week...I could see the dramatic difference in my skin.....you have to try you literaly have to if you have trouble skin you owe it too your self to buy it and btw I bought the French version not the American version</li>
    <li> I bought effaclar duo from amazon because the price was $20 as opposed to $36 at La Roche Posay official e-shop. Obviously the reason why it is so is that there are two versions of this product. The cheaper is for international market and it is totally different form the other one. Not bad but it is much milder, does not do almost anything to my skin.  When I use the american version my skin starts to peel of second or third day. The cheaper one just does not do anything visible to me.</li>
    <li> My first tube of this product made such a change in my completion. After having acne problems for many years, I believe I&#x27;ve finally found the product that works. My complaint is that since I placed the order for my second tube 5 weeks ago, I have yet to receive my order. I ordered it before the first tube ran out so that I would not have a break in my treatment. I hope I will see it soon.</li>
    <li> It is an excellent product from a line of products that I love. It did not do all the things the information I read said it would.  But it could just be my son&#x27;s skin.</li>
    <li> This gave me worst acne than I actually had. It made my skin blotchy and full of cystic acne and blackheads . I&#x27;m so upset I wasted my money on this . Thumbs down</li>
    <li> i ordered this by mistake. it does not work... make sure and buy the right effaclar duo...there are two..but with vastly different results!</li>
    <li> This stuff really works. I have tried sooo many products, and this is the only one where I&#x27;m SURE the product is actual working. It stops break outs right away and minimizes redness. It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but a little really does go a long way. I can usually use a pea sized amount for my whole face. I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> My YouTube guru Tanya Burr swears by this so I had to give it a try- soooo worth it- dries my pimples right up and the smell is amazing!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a while I am not sure what was in the tube, it was watery.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this vender.</li>
    <li> The first and only time I used it, I applied a thin coat on my face before bed. The next morning, my face was on fire, it was swollen, there were two area where I was bleeding. It was painful, and a week later, I still have a scab in the middle of my cheek which, I hope, won&#x27;t leave a scar. A single application literally burned my skin, and my face peeled for a week, looking leathery and scaley. I can&#x27;t believe they are getting away with selling this product without a prescription. I researched this a bit further (too late shame on me). A dermatologist told me that when they have cases of acne that are resilient to other creams, they prescribe a cream that has 5% benzoyl peroxide (this one has 5.5% if you can believe it). They warn their patients that it&#x27;s very strong, to apply it only at bedtime because it has bleach in it and it can stain your clothes, and to start only every other day with lots of moisturizer to see if the skin will tolerate it.  All I can say is, if you&#x27;re brave enough to try it, you should try it on a small part of your skin, perhaps forehead, before bed, and certainly not the day before a hot date. I looked like a chipmunk on benadryl! (the joke was on me).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not giving 5 stars, because I don&#x27;t think it works good for my skin, I don&#x27;t think it prevents as much as other products I have used from the brand to reduce acne appearance.  Also, it does not keeps me mat as my doctor said it would.By the middle of the day I feel very oily again.  Effaclar K and Effaclar Mat have given me better results, for my acne prone skin and  also by keeping me mat longer during the day.</li>
    <li> I was prescribed this facial moisturizer by my ex-dermatologist in Martinique 2 years ago.. therefore I have certainly used it before.. But not only was this the first time in a long time that I&#x27;ve used this product but also it was the first time I had ever ordered something off of Amazon.. At first I was worried the product would be fake or by chance used.. I was truly satisfied and I am definitely willing to do this again. When it comes to this product, if you&#x27;ve got the right medication to go along with it, it will definitely help a great deal in treating your acne.. FAST and it is certainly a great make-up base.. so by all means, I recommend this cream :)</li>
    <li> I heard about this product from a person in London who swore that it really helped her deep hormonal acne. I had been getting that type of acne on my chin and it was so frustrating. I decided to give it a shot and found it on Amazon at a great price. It is just starting to come over to the US (I have seen it in a Walgreens) and it is an amazing product. I put it on morning and night and it has cleared up my skin tremendously.</li>
    <li> Works every time!  My son&#x27;s acne has cleared dramatically since using effaclar and also since using the face wash.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because, on the picture, it shows it to be the EFFACLAR DUO DUAL-ACTION ACNE TREATMENT. It is not. It is the &amp;#34;Corrective and Unclogging Anti-Imperfection Care&amp;#34;, which is a weaker version of the product pictured on this page. By the time I finished my bottle and was ready to use this bottle, I found out the mistake, but it was already too late and Amazon would not refund me without charging me a restocking fee, even though they had misrepresented their product. So I decided to keep it anyway, because I didn&#x27;t feel like paying a 25% fee for someone else&#x27;s mistake. After using this bottle for a few weeks now, I can tell you that it is not the same, it does not work the same, and if you&#x27;re looking for the Dual-Action Acne Treatment, do not buy this product.</li>
    <li> I found out about this item from a few YouTube beauty girls (AModelRecommends &amp; Tanya Burr) who had mentioned this product in a few of their videos saying it helped their skin from those pesky tiny breakouts that happen all around your face. I tried it and it too has helped my face so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to note is that the US and UK version are different. The US is more like a spot treatment and the UK is for all over the face. I stuck with the UK one because that&#x27;s what was suggested to me so I know it works.</li>
    <li> Put this on a zit and , zap, it&#x27;s gone! Definitely would recommend this to someone else-love it, love it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not American version. Not same as the picture. I  bought it on January 6 and received on Feb 5. Almost 1 month. It claimed will received on Jan 30 but delay for 1 week. It made me very disappoint.</li>
    <li> I was given a sample from my dermatologist for a spot on my arm that looks like it could be an ingrown hair, but has been there months.  Over the past few weeks the spot continues to shrink.  I also have adult acne and this helps that a lot too.  I have not found it too drying.  Plan on purchasing it again, but it seems like it should last a long time, so a very good value too.</li>
    <li> great product...moisturizes but doesn&#x27;t make me too oily. takes awhile to ship, but it is totally worth it to get your hands on this.</li>
    <li> do not put this over your entire face.  You run the risk of burning it!  I suggest only apply to areas of acne.  More like spot treating.  I can use it allover my forehead, but on my cheeks where skin is more sensitive and thinner it reacted to.  To be fair, only my forehead needed it as my skin doesn&#x27;t exfoliate properly on it&#x27;s own.  Having said all that, this cream is the only thing that helps with my keratosis pilaris.  My skin looks amazing the day after I&#x27;ve applied it at night.  And I use it a couple days on and then take a break for a couple days.</li>
    <li> Love Love Love this!  It has helped with the spots and keeps news ones from forming!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work he needed Dr. care.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how this excoriated my face. I&#x27;m stressed out and getting the unusual pimple on my cheek and forehead but this cream did a number on my face. I am currently sitting with a leathery stiff face like a scleroderma patient. My face is so tight and dry and not to mention there are about 50 new dots of pimples under the dry scaly and tightness that this cream created. I used this 2 days In a row with alot of moisturizer and it still had a horrible reaction. I wish I never bought it. I hope my face heals fast. Cannot walk out of house looking like this :(</li>
    <li> ...for a long time but never as bad as after 38 years old. Tried EVERYTHING, (not exaggerating) have 10 other multi-stage poducts collecting dust and this is the first product that changed the texture of my skin in 3 days. Former clogged pores clean out in daily shower like before, waaay fewer break-outs and cysts, goes on and disappears without oily residue. Reduces sebum and oil production to get rid of that waxy look and generally allowed skin to heal and return to normal. Awesome product, bought more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had acne,oily, sensitive skin my whole life.  I&#x27;m now 45 and this has worked better than Retin a micro and Tazorac which are both by prescription and are very expensive and very harsh and drying to my more maturing skin.. I use this with effaclar.k and redermic r . Keeps my oil down ( do you know how hard that is to do in sunny humid Florida)?. Keeps my blackheads and pimples at bay, and my skin looks healthy ... not cracked and dry. You have to get this. And by the way, as a mask get Aztec secret!!!</li>
    <li> I have dry sensitive skin with mild acne and this product cleared my skin and has kept it clear ever since without drying it. I use it morning over my moisturizer and by itself before bed. This product is a must have!</li>
    <li> This product is great for acne! It helps reduce outbreaks and reduce scarring. However be sure to buy the European version and NOT the US version. The formulations are slightly different. The US version is more harsh on the skin.</li>
