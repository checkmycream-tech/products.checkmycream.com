<li> I am 62 yrs old.  </li>
<li> It is NATURALLY blond.  </li>
<li> It will remove all undesired shades, plus leave your hair silky soft.</li>
<li> Not heavy.</li>
<li> A tiny bit goes a long way.</li>
<li> I put it on my hair wet and blow dry and the flat iron.</li>
<li> and I use a curling iron, which makes my hair dry.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m glad I tried it but waiting to try other products that aren&#x27;t as expensive and less hyped up.</li>
<li> Just put a small amount every 3 days to keep hair texture soft and shiny</li>
<li> This oil works so well on wet (and dry hair).  </li>
<li> this may turn your hair a little yellow.  </li>
<li> I used to rip my hair out when it was wet, but now I can just run a comb through it and no tangles.  </li>
<li> I am never going back to heavy stuff.</li>
<li> I not only use this oil after washing, but I use it on my dried hair until I wash again which is usually 5 DAYS later!!!</li>
<li> Leaves my fine hair very silly and shiny.</li>
<li> I have had the Moroccan Oil in the past and the fragrance was such aromatherapy for me and this one didn&#x27;t do that, hence, the &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; label.  </li>
<li> Doesnt weigh it down</li>
<li> I had previously.  </li>
<li> The only thing that I was not happy with was when I went to ckeck out, the price was $16.00, not the $8.00 that was advertised :(</li>
<li> This is the secret.</li>
<li> I was a little disappointed in this one.  </li>

    <li> Great Product for Human Hair Weaves. Just put a small amount every 3 days to keep hair texture soft and shiny</li>
    <li> Great stuff, but platinum blondes beware....this may turn your hair a little yellow.  I recommend Davines silver conditioner. It will remove all undesired shades, plus leave your hair silky soft.</li>
    <li> I am 62 yrs old.  My hair was thinning just 2 yrs ago.  That was also the last time I colored it.  It is NATURALLY blond.  I not only use this oil after washing, but I use it on my dried hair until I wash again which is usually 5 DAYS later!!! This as well the companion products: repair shampoo and repair conditioner have SO Improved my hair.  I have hair which is past my shoulders now, strong and blond!  Very shiny.  This is the product I use to DETANGLE the snarls after I towel my washed hair.  Need nothing else to get the &amp;#34;birdsnest&amp;#34; untangled.  This product is the same as one would buy in the salon, btw.  Excellent.</li>
    <li> This oil works so well on wet (and dry hair).  I used to rip my hair out when it was wet, but now I can just run a comb through it and no tangles.  Pleasant scent as well.</li>
    <li> This is a Great product!!!! Not heavy. Nourishing. Perfect. Can&#x27;t say more. Just a really terrific product. You won&#x27;t be upset.</li>
    <li> Very good product, change the hair of my girlfriend a lot. Good for light and thin hairs.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much.</li>
    <li> authentic MO product...makes you hair look,  feel,  and smell great. Would definitely repurchase. and the price was nice as well.</li>
    <li> I am never going back to heavy stuff. So great on any hair type!!!!</li>
    <li> I was a little disappointed in this one.  I have had the Moroccan Oil in the past and the fragrance was such aromatherapy for me and this one didn&#x27;t do that, hence, the &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; label.  I had no clue that that would make a difference in the fragrance, as it was the same company and box color as the Moroccan Oil I had previously.  If I could have &amp;#34;sniffed&amp;#34; the oil before I bought this one , I would never have bought It...but I&#x27;ll know in the future.</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING for fine hair with dry ends. Saved my hair!!</li>
    <li> Best price around!  Authentic product, shipped fast.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Good item. Wish it did have a dropper. A tiny bit goes a long way. I live in socal, good to keep my hair hydrated and shiny. Doesnt weigh it down (i dont put it on my crown) just mid shaft and lower</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay I guess. Smells really good but doesn&#x27;t seem to do much in terms of smoothing and repair. I&#x27;m glad I tried it but waiting to try other products that aren&#x27;t as expensive and less hyped up.</li>
    <li> This is my 4 bottle of moroccanoil.absolutely love this product!!!will use it over and over again!!!</li>
    <li> Great deal! Smells so good and you only need a teeny bit at a time. Last forever! Everyone tells me my hair is so shiny. This is the secret.</li>
    <li> Made my hair too greasy!</li>
    <li> I Love this product!  The only thing that I was not happy with was when I went to ckeck out, the price was $16.00, not the $8.00 that was advertised :(</li>
    <li> Meh. Not as amazing as expected.</li>
    <li> I would only do the light version of this oil from here on out.  This oil actually does all that is advertised.</li>
    <li> Best stuff on earth for hair.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It protects my hair and makes it so shiny. I put it on my hair wet and blow dry and the flat iron. Leaves my fine hair very silly and shiny. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Moroccan Oil for a few years now and really love it so I thought I&#x27;d try the Light version.  It does a great job, doesn&#x27;t weigh down my fine hair, and is so much more affordable when ordered from amazon.com.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair and I use a curling iron, which makes my hair dry. When I use the light treatment it makes my hair shine and have more body. I really like it.</li>
    <li> Great. Received it on time. I love this product.</li>
