      <li>If feels really good.</li>
      <li>Good thing</li>
      <li>So tonight while my husband was out - I decided to brave the armpits on my own.</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s where the good things end.</li>
      <li>Shipping was good too</li>
      <li>I use hydrogen peroxide but rubbing alcohol or a good loofah-scrubbing in the shower would probably also work&lt;br</li>
      <li>Yes, it smells good.  </li>
      <li>I bought this product for convenience, not to heat water to warm wax, apply baby powder, use my own muslin strips and after oil!</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.  </li>
      <li>It is good and effective.</li>
      <li>I love this wax!</li>
      <li>For the pain I would expect more hair pulled!</li>
      <li>I love this wax!  </li>
      <li>Boy am I ever glad I did!  </li>
      <li>I read a beauty blog about how great these strips are because they are so easy to use.</li>
      <li>Very effective and easy to use</li>
      <li>so I guess I didn&#x27;t warm the wax</li>
      <li>a hair dryer on the skin to warm wax if wax on the skin remains, and the cloths strips and try again.</li>
      <li>i noticed it wasn&#x27;t that warm</li>
      <li>After five strips or so, I was kind of done with the pain and could not convince myself to keep going.</li>
      <li>you are looking for an effective way to wax hair without all the residue, I recommend Sally Hansen sugar wax, which comes off with a warm shower no problem.</li>
      <li>I thought i was going to have a nice bikini area</li>
      <li>Cloth strips might be nice</li>
      <li>However, I liked it for my legs and my arms.</li>
      <li>Use a hair dryer to warm it up and use something to scrap it up and throw it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never tried waxing on my own before this but have gotten waxed before.</li>
      <li>It goes on warm.</li>
      <li>I honestly can&#x27;t remember if that was a sponsered</li>
      <li>This is the absolute best waxing product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>It got all the hairs, and it honestly didn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
      <li>Warm up the wax to make it semi-liquid in the microwave (</li>
      <li>The wax, still warm and sticky, would not come off.</li>
      <li>First of all, the box shows this nice sized, beautiful bottle of the oil...</li>
      <li>This is by far the best wax I have ever used.</li>
      <li>it is the most amazing product I have ever used</li>
      <li>The best wax I have used so far.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 20 yrs old and going on a cruise to the Bahamas, didn&#x27;t feel like paying $40 for a bikini wax so bought this, and it was actually great!</li>
      <li>When I first bought this, I was really happy.</li>
      <li>I finished, a washcloth with hot water and olive oil cleaned everything off very nicely.  </li>
      <li>But for stubburn hairs this works better than sugar waxing.</li>
      <li>It is very sticky and gooey, but if you know what you&#x27;re doing this product is great.  </li>
      <li>so I&#x27;ve been through over 2 bottles of this stuff and still have more strips,</li>
      <li>and I have normal/fine hairs on it and was able to get it off.</li>
      <li>also this wax removed my hair with no pain the most I felt was the shock I put in the microwave</li>
      <li>I can get up to 5 waxes out of one kit, so even when I buy more muslin strips</li>
      <li>(two at the most) for upkeep, but</li>
      <li>I wish my hair would stay gone longer, but I think it&#x27;s my hair type and love of biotin supplements that cause that.</li>
      <li>I have switched to honey lemon mix and have remained satisfied with the results.</li>
      <li>Mancine wax is much better.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Sally Hansen All-Over Body wax kit for many years now.  </li>
      <li>It is more like a liquid glue that sticks to everything.</li>
      <li>; I have two complaints - 1 - provide your customers with more cloth strips in these kits or sell them at stores separately</li>
      <li>The wax that I wasn&#x27;t able to get off made my skin stick together and made my clothes stick to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I gave myself my first ever Brazilian wax with this product.  I&#x27;ve used Nair before to remove this hair, but it doesn&#x27;t get down below the surface.  The hair grows right back.  Going to the doctor is one thing, but I&#x27;m not about to drop trou for some salon flunkey to wax me there.  I decided to try this product even with the bad reviews it got.  I read the literature as well as the comments on two sites before proceeding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put down newspaper on the floor of the bathroom and near the sink and kept the jar of wax in a bowl of hot water after nuking it(many thanks to the person who posted this suggestion).  I went slowly and did only small sections at a time.  I used baby powder liberally.  This stuff took out the hair very effectively. My only problem was:  the farther down I got, the more it hurt.  That would be true of any product; the area is just sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I finished, a washcloth with hot water and olive oil cleaned everything off very nicely.  I was swollen and red with many red spots.  I applied lotion liberally and all the red was gone by morning.  (I did this late at night.) I just dropped the used strips and stick on the newspaper on the the floor and wadded the whole thing up and voila, clean!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just five hours later, I was very slightly swollen and a tiny bit tender.  That&#x27;s it.  The area isn&#x27;t even red anymore, and I didn&#x27;t lose even a bit of skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it four out of five because there aren&#x27;t enough stips for the amount of product.  It&#x27;s good stuff, if you use it right.</li>
    <li> I love this wax! This is the only wax I use because it gets all the small hairs too! It does get really sticky so I wouldn&#x27;t use it at least two days before a special event because the wax won&#x27;t all completely come off until after a few showers.</li>
    <li> I WILL NEVER BUY THIS AGAIN VERY HARD TO USE &amp; SUPER MESSY DON&#x27;t waste your money, i will continue.. with my search :(</li>
    <li> I bought this at a local store that sold it cheaper than amazon since I wanted to get ready for a pool party the next day. My microwave is an old piece of junk that still dings--I refuse to buy another one until it breaks. So, I did only thirty seconds and noticed it was quite liquid--as opposed to the almost solid wax when I pulled off the lid.  Not wanting it to boil, I tested it on my arm, it was warm, but not hot. I decided to get right to it and started with the bikini line. My hair was a bit long and it worked great--got a ton of dark, coarse hair. I was kind of surprised with how well it worked. Notes up to this point: it smells nice, it&#x27;s super sticky and gets ALL OVER THE PLACE like the bathroom counter and floor, and it can cause you to bleed a little from the hair it pulls out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The waxing itself was painful, but not unbearable. I did have to convince myself to keep going. After five strips or so, I was kind of done with the pain and could not convince myself to keep going. It wasn&#x27;t unbearable about a 5 on a 1-10 scale, but you have to be fast when pulling the wax off and I just wasn&#x27;t building up enough courage. I also noticed a bruise on my bikini line that I&#x27;m pretty sure wasn&#x27;t there before.  I tried my underarms and it didn&#x27;t work--my hair was too short. The hair&#x27;s gotta be pretty long 1/4 inch for it to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the bottom line of all this is that you really have to prep yourself, read the directions and watch some tutorials on how to do it. On the parts it worked well, it worked really well. Some of the people that ranked it higher have more experience and tricks, which I didn&#x27;t use.  I&#x27;ll have to try baby oil next time and make sure that the wax stays warm. Maybe I&#x27;ll have a friend help too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s. the reviewer that said her butt cheeks were sticking to each other, I feel you.</li>
    <li> I have waxed for years.  This product is horrible.  It takes the skin, NOT the hair.  After trying it once, I waited a week, and tried it again, heating it for less time and spreading the wax thinner...    same results.  Shredded (hairy) skin.  This product is a joke; please do not waste your money!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how awful this wax is.  Yes, it smells good.  But, that&#x27;s where the pros stop.  I have tried it three times, all with the same result.  The wax rips off my skin and only gets some hair, leaving me with red, bloody armpits that take about 3-4 days to heal.  You&#x27;d think after the first two times of the rash and bleeding I wouldn&#x27;t have tried it a third time; but, call me crazy.  I thought it was my technique.  It&#x27;s not the technique -- it&#x27;s the wax!  Ladies (and men), don&#x27;t even waste your money, unless you like blood and pain and still having hairy pits.  The wax is also super hard to get off, especially since the bottle of oil they give you is by no means enough for multiple waxes.  (As a hint, I&#x27;ve used jojoba oil and baby oil to remove the wax residue just fine.) Do not buy this painful torture wax!</li>
    <li> I have to agree with Tree Squirrel from Tx.      I have used waxes in the past and have never had any problems.  Even though I followed the instruction, this product was extremely painful to use.  After the first two strip-pulls I gave up-the pain was too much.  The area now has red bruise like marks under the skin.  I am not sure how this product pull the skin so painfully and leave all the hair behind. Horrible experience, threw it away, there goes $10 in the garbage.</li>
    <li> I have thick, hard to remove hair and with other kinds of wax (even from Sally Hansen) I get lots of hair and residue left behind. This is the only wax that makes my armpits presentable! For me, the trick is using baby powder to make the area as dry as possible before I apply the wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO:&lt;br /&gt;1) Clean the underarms first to remove any deodorant residue. I use hydrogen peroxide but rubbing alcohol or a good loofah-scrubbing in the shower would probably also work&lt;br /&gt;2) Use a bone-dry washcloth or towel to dry them as much as possible&lt;br /&gt;3) Spread/rub in a layer of baby powder on each underarm area after drying and immediately before applying the wax&lt;br /&gt;4) Spread the wax on in as thin a layer as possible over the baby powder&lt;br /&gt;5) Smooth the strip on in the same direction as the hair&lt;br /&gt;6) Rip off the strip in the opposite direction as the hair, as close to the skin as possible (across, not up).&lt;br /&gt;I do steps 4-6 in two parts for each underarm - first the lower part, where my hair grows down (and I pull the strip upward), then again for the upper part where my hair grows up (and I pull the strip downward).&lt;br /&gt;7) Last, *after* the whole underarm is done, rub in the finishing oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for years, and both my underarms are done in less than 10 minutes including wax microwaving time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DON&#x27;T:&lt;br /&gt;* Use the oil to \\&quot;prepare\\&quot; the area before waxing! This is a terrible idea, it will make it much harder for the wax to grip your hair.&lt;br /&gt;* Use too much wax, this will just make it harder to pull the strip and harder for the wax to pull out your hair.&lt;br /&gt;* Skip the baby powder step! For me, putting the wax over a smoothed-on layer of baby powder makes it less painful and more effective on the hair. On those rare occasions where I&#x27;ve forgotten to use baby powder, it hurts more and there&#x27;s MUCH more hair and wax residue left over.&lt;br /&gt;* Use deodorant for 24 hours after waxing, I think it makes ingrowns more likely. I just use one of those natural crystal/rock deodorants for a day before I go back to my regular deodorant/antiperspirant.&lt;br /&gt;* Screw the lid back on completely after you use it, it will just be more difficult to open the next time when it cements itself shut. I just place the lid back on and turn it maybe a 1/4 turn (and store it right-side up). If it does cement itself shut, you can microwave it with the cap on until the wax loosens up inside the lid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before you give up on this wax, try baby powder!fore I go back to my regular deodorant/antiperspirant.  * Screw the lid back on completely after you use it, it will just be more difficult to open the next time when it cements itself shut.

    <li> 1-star, for the one pro: it smells far better than any other non-sugar wax I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But that&#x27;s where the good things end. This product is by far the stickiest, messiest, least effective product I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I got a bad jar, but right out of the box, I encountered issues. The wax would not heat properly. I was left with either easy to spread but boiling hot wax, or sticky, cold, hard cement.&lt;br /&gt;Actual application was a pain in the neck. No amount of manipulation could get this stuff to spread into an even layer. Ripping the hair off with the provided strips was also a problem; it seemed to pull the top layer of skin and some useless blond baby hairs off rather than the thick dark stuff I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest gripe was getting this stuff off. Oh my God, I must&#x27;ve tried everything I had in the house once I ran out of the included oil. Baby oil, as some others have suggested, just made it slip and slide everywhere else. It took a rough plastic shower sponge and some elbow grease to scrub it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soon as I got most of the wax off, I dumped the whole kit in the garbage. You&#x27;re better off using sugar wax, or at the very least, some other brand.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been self waxing for 8 years now and this is the worst  thing I&#x27;ve ever used. I bought it at a local make up store and first time using it tonight I have deep regret for wasting money on it. It removes some hair but it always leaves a residue. The moment i opened it, half of it was stuck to the plastic and it was a mess just removing the wax without it going all over the place. If you put too much on, you&#x27;ll never get it off so you have to put a THIN layer of it if you want to be able to wax properly. It felt like waxing with Elmer&#x27;s glue or something. Anyway this is such crap I really need to find a better wax to buy now...next time I will read  Amazon reviews before buying random stuff from the store -_-.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try this... I love Sally Hansen products. Sadly... it&#x27;s horrible. First of all, the box shows this nice sized, beautiful bottle of the oil... so not the case. It&#x27;s a tiny amount of fluid, such a waste. Baby oil works just as well. The wax does smell wonderful... However i&#x27;ll just be shaving from now on. My chacha looks like someone kicked it&#x27;s ass.</li>
    <li> i hate this, i just couldn&#x27;t open the lid. i wanted to bring it back to the store but it&#x27;s too far. i&#x27;m not buying this again, what a waste of time and money. don&#x27;t ever buy this product...</li>
    <li> My 15 year old daughter had an horrendous experience with this product.  She read and followed the instructions carefully.  The wax became a sticky glue all over her arm and then of course her hands and anywhere else she touched.  The wax/glue could NOT be removed with the paper removal strips.  It also could not be removed with the tiny bottle of \\&quot;finishing oil\\&quot;. She AGAIN looked in the instructions for recommendations for removal, and there are NO EMERGENCY removal instructions.  She then tried to use soap and water in the shower (Hey, she&#x27;s 15, how&#x27;s she supposed to know soap and water is not going to work unless a caution is included in the instructions).  This STICKY GLUE (the term \\&quot;wax\\&quot; is not an adequate description)then ended up all over her body, her hair, the shower, the bathroom, towels, clothing, floor, fixtures,etc.--basically everywhere she had touched.  Hours later she alerted me to this emergency.  I looked on-line but could find no information.  I finally used two industrial-type wax removers,\\&quot;Goof-Off\\&quot; and \\&quot;Lift-Off\\&quot;.  These are dangerous chemical solvents designed to remove candle wax and dried latex paint.  These left an oily residue that I then removed with isopropal alcohol.  Imagine how badly these stung after the hours my daughter had spent trying to \\&quot;scrub\\&quot; this horrible ADHESIVE off her skin.  I am a veterinarian with a special background in chemistry.  I can&#x27;t imagine what some other poor soul would have done.  They probably would have ended up in an emergency room.  This all occured at night so there was no one to call at the \\&quot;Sally Hansen\\&quot; 9-5 phone number.  They NEED to include EMERGENCY INSTRUCTIONS!!  If oil alone will indeed do the trick (as one commentator suggests), then that should be stated in the instructions. Also, I have no idea how this product could EVER actually work, considering the sticky, gooey, useless substance that I observed.  I am still removing goo from newly discovered places (like my bedroom door knob from when my daughter woke me in hysterics).</li>
    <li> I am no stranger to at-home bikini and leg waxing--I&#x27;ve been doing it for years and when I couldn&#x27;t find my usual beloved Nair product at the drugstore I decided to try this--what a disaster!  It was impossible to clean up, stuck to my skin and all the hair it was supposed to be removing (the cloth strips only pulled up about 1/4 of the wax and hair and left the rest clumped on my skin) and left me with red, irritated skin for four days afterwards, which then all peeled off--very sexy.  I read all the instructions beforehand and I&#x27;ve never had this problem with any other home waxing kit, so I&#x27;m quite sure the product is entirely unfit for human use.  Maybe as torture to release state secrets it could be useful. STAY AWAY!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using wax for the last ten years, so I am not a novice. As a matter of fact, the last wax I had was from the same maker and I was very please with it (the Brazilian bikini wax). However, this product is just unusable! Once you apply it, you can&#x27;t remove it. I had to use my old wax to get rid of it. IMO, this product should be pulled off the market, it is awful!</li>
    <li> Okay here goes. I tried to use this for a bikini plus intimate area wax. Like a modified Brazilian. My hair was exactly 1/4 inch so I enlisted the help of my wonderful husband (Thank goodness I did). This was my first ever waxing experience. We started on the Mons, left side went well, right side went well, then onto one side of the unmentionables and YOW! pain, pain pain! My hubby wanted to look to be sure everything was okay and spotted a bit of blood. I was nervous to go on - but didn&#x27;t want to be stuck with 3/4 of a wax job. So on to the fourth zone - it went well. I am not very hairy so four strips did the job. So all day long, the area that bled has been a touch sore. Everything else feels fine and the redness is fading after 8 hours. So tonight while my husband was out - I decided to brave the armpits on my own. Big mistake. The first strip pulled off a bunch of wax and no hair. So I tried again, this time it hurt (like before) and still not much hair removal. I may be using too much wax??? When I looked in the mirror after the armpit job (a much easier body part to look at) I noticed BRIGHT RED lines, in my armpit. Two little 1/2 inch bright red lines. Whatever this is, it hurts. So I am fairly certain that this injury is what occurred \\&quot;downtown\\&quot;. After the armpit fiasco clean up was a nightmare. I used tons of the oil the kit comes with, plus vasoline, plus exfoliating body wash and my arm was still sticking to my torso. This wax is super sticky, smells good and is impossible to remove. Have a strong companion remove the strips for you. Esp. if doing the nether regions. I know I could not have done this alone. If I had the armpit experience first - I would give this one star. But it is too finicky for me to try it again. I think I will try sugaring which can be washed off in the case of a disaster! BTW - I ended up shaving the pits!</li>
    <li> As a seasoned home waxer I have to say that one star is way too much for this product! It is HORRIBLE! I moved to the States from the UK, where I am used to a wax that washes off easily with warm water, and real cotton strips that you can rinse then put in the washing machine and use again and again. Having run out of my British stuff I turned to Sally Hansen as a name that I recognized from other American products. BIG MISTAKE! Like all the other one star reviews say, it sticks like glue and the only way to get it off is with the tiny bottle of oil that comes with it. After one use on just my bikini line, I am out of oil and have no way of getting the stickiness off of just about everything in my bathroom!! The strips that come with it are some sort of paper derivative, and completely useless! And with how you have to tug to get them off, I am left with bruises and raw patches of skin despite using baby powder in preparation, as I always do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One star will cover the fact that it does have a nice hot fudge type smell, and it comes with about 5 or 6 spatulas. However, that is because you can only use each spatula once as you can&#x27;t wash them and use them again. If I was keeping this product and using up the whole tub, I would be out of spatulas about half way through the wax. Thankfully, the almost full tub, is firmly in the trash with the spatulas saved for another waxing kit. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can anyone recommend an American waxing kit like my kit from the UK that I described?</li>
    <li> if i could have left no stars i would have. left huge purple bruises on my bikini line. did not stick. was messy and didn&#x27;t heat up right. did not take off all the hair.</li>
    <li> When I first bought this, I was really happy. It smelled nice, and it removed hair with little pain. After initial use, I did not like it at all. Here&#x27;s why:    1. It&#x27;s sticky. The stuff does not come off. Granted, it&#x27;s wax, but after waxing I literally jumped into the shower and scrubbed. 30 minutes later, it was still there. Also, everywhere else; dripping down the side of the can, on the desk...    2. The hair had started to grow back less than a week later.     3. Left some major irritation marks.    Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I use this on my legs all the time and it works fine.  I haven&#x27;t tried this on any other body part and plan not too, since it is extra strength wax. It is a little annoying trying to get the extra off and you do have to use oil like all wax products. I don&#x27;t know why ppl are complaining about this it should be a given, as for making ppl bleed this may also happen with any product remember you&#x27;re pulling hair out of your body and this is extra strength.&lt;br /&gt;Buy the wax for the type of hair you have and if your skin easily bruises or rips this product might not be the one for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; IT IS EXTRA STRENGHT -</li>
    <li> Terrible. Stuck to the skin more than the hair, and I had to scrape it off for over an hour in the shower, from the small section I had done. Had to throw away the washcloth too.</li>
    <li> I bought this product yesterday, and tried it out literally 30 minutes ago.  I didn&#x27;t want to waste my money on getting professionally waxed, so I was excited to use this 10 dollar product.  At first, I got some hair off with little pain, but as I moved places, the wax would not harden. The cloth strips would not take the wax off, and I was left with a gooey mess all over myself which would NOT come off. It was easily one of the most uncomfortable situations I have EVER been in.  The oil barely took any of it off, and there was not enough of it. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS. It is down right awful, and will leave you bleeding and covered in wax.</li>
    <li> This product removed the hair no problem, but it also removed half of my skin while i tried to get the wax off.  I have used Nair wax in the past and  never had a problem.  Why did I switch??? I don&#x27;t know.  This wax is impossible to get off.  The worst of it was the more I tried, the more it spread.  By the end, my butt cheeks were sticking together.  Not a pretty sight!  Taking a shower only made it worse as my hands were covered with it.  Go With the Nair brand.  It washes right off and works almost as well.</li>
    <li> this wax kit works perfect for my eyebrow cleanup and mustache removal. Didn&#x27;t work on my super coarse armpit hair though. still worth the buy since I&#x27;m using this weekly on my stache &amp; beard</li>
    <li> While this wax is gentle, it is sticky and does not work well on the bikini area. Does not remove the hair and is messy. Used 3 times and the results were always the same, threw out the jar, not worth my time</li>
    <li> I bought this product at a local drugstore. I bought it because it was cheap. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND DONT BUY IT. Really painful, messy and finally after struggling for more than an hour, it still leaves a lot of hair on skin. If it does not leave hair, it takes out the skin there. It&#x27;s just the WORST waxing kit out there!</li>
    <li> It is the worse product you may ever experience. It sticks to your skin and not gonna go away in any way.</li>
    <li> Well, let me first state that I have not used this waxing kit for my body yet. I have only used it on my face. And let me say that it works wonders. With other waxing kits I had trouble getting the tiny hairs on my chin and lip. But this gets EVERY hair. Its important to get the wax to the correct temperature or it just wont work correctly. First time I applied it i noticed it wasn&#x27;t that warm but I tried it anyway... didn&#x27;t really work. Heated it up for 15 more seconds and tried it again and as soon as I applied it I knew I got it to the right temp and it worked. I got every hair in the section.&lt;br /&gt;However, like everyone has stated it is STICKY. Like.. crazy sticky. But if you are careful, and are taking your time you wont get it anywhere but the spot you are applying it to. If there is still wax on the area, simply use another strip to take off the rest of the wax. Cause water simply won&#x27;t do it.&lt;br /&gt;Again, I have only used it on my face and I give it five stars. It will save me so much money than going to the salon and spending tons.&lt;br /&gt;Hope this review helps!</li>
    <li> Omg I&#x27;m bleeding. Trying this product was a huge mistake. It&#x27;s so sticky that it peels your skin off. Even with heating properly and following all of the directions to a T this product was just awful. Bikini area is not a great place to start your first waxing experience, I know, but a trusted name like Sally Hansen should definitely be able to do better. Ughhhh</li>
    <li> This product is so horrible, it deserves no stars at all!  Normally the waxing process goes like this: warm up wax, apply on desired area, wait till it dries, pull! (Whether you use strips or not). Well, this wax never dried yet still managed to stick like glue to my face! At the end of the process you&#x27;re left with this gooey paste on!  I tried what usually works with any other product, alcohol, cream, washing it off, but nothing was working. Not only couldn&#x27;t I get it off, but when I tried to dry my face in between this attempts pieces of towel, toilet paper, cotton, etc stuck to it!!!  I had to pull a lot of the wax with my fingers and it was like I was slowly pulling my hair out, area by area.  I finally tried makeup remover which helped remove it.  In conclusion DO NOT buy this!! It&#x27;s a waste of money and time! I can definitely say that this is the worst hair removal product I have ever tried!</li>
    <li> I used to shave under arms and my legs but I&#x27;m tired of stubbles growing back by the end of the day. Not to mention that when you don&#x27;t shave for a couple of days, the stubble just feel uncomfortable. So I tried this and I love it. I love the fact that for a vacation, I can wax a day or two before I leave and I don&#x27;t need to pack anything for that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 - make sure you heat it up well, for me 30 seconds work best. I used to microwave it for about 15 seconds and that doesn&#x27;t work as well. It globs on if it&#x27;s not warm enough.&lt;br /&gt;2 - You need to use the oil that it comes with because that&#x27;s the only way to get the wax off of you, and the counter top.&lt;br /&gt;3 - You will use up the strips first with plenty more wax. I found that you can use the strips 3-4 x. Just apply more wax, and reuse the strips before throwing it away.&lt;br /&gt;4 - Yes, it&#x27;s painful, the first few times. But I am actually used to it now. I will never go back to shaving.&lt;br /&gt;5 - I tried the Lavander one just to see how it is. I like this better. While the lavander is easier to work with (not as &#x27;waxy&#x27;), I find that this removes hair better.&lt;br /&gt;6 - when you store this, store it right side up on a flat surface. You don&#x27;t want to deal with the mess if it&#x27;s on it&#x27;s side or upside down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I do not give this 5 stars is that it&#x27;s messy to work with.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this product before I read the reviews. I&#x27;ve never tried waxing on my own before this but have gotten waxed before. I would recommend using latex gloves since this product does get messy. I followed the directions carefully, cut the strips into smaller pieces and made sure the wax wasn&#x27;t too hot. Yes, waxing hurts and it will leave bumps but that&#x27;s what I expected before using this product.  Since I took small areas at a time, it made it less painful and the oil does help to soothe the irritation.  I would consider using this product again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is a sticky, gooey mess that&#x27;s impossible to get off your fingers once you&#x27;ve touched it. It was mostly ineffective on my underarms and the hair only ended up coming off in partial patches. I had to tweeze the rest...what a pain! After trying it two separate times with no better results, I ended up throwing away most of it and wasting my money. The oil works well to get the wax off when you&#x27;re ready to give up but it is such a tiny bottle that it&#x27;s gone after the first use. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> I bought this wax kit yesterday and went home to try it out. What a disappointment! Although the wax smells good, it is so messy that made impossible to wax my bikini line with it.   The striped do not completely sticks to the wax, which makes pulling it off a nightmare.  Don&#x27;t waste your money with this.</li>
    <li> This is possibly the worst wax I have ever come across. This is not even a wax. It is more like a liquid glue that sticks to everything. Yes, everything!! I applied this glue on my skin, it was very sticky and messy. It did not pull off much hair but the wax got stuck to my skin. I tried to wash it off with water but little that I knew, this product is water repellent. I had to try whole bunch of goo cleaner to get this thing off my Skin. Please do not use this one. Mancine wax is much better.  If you want a home made wax, use concentrated honey and lemon mix. It works like a salon quality wax. It does not stick to the skin much and it can be washed off easily with water. One good thing about home made product is, it is all natural. I have switched to honey lemon mix and have remained satisfied with the results. It is easy to prepare, easy to apply, microwavable and very very cheap (Less than $1 to prepare).</li>
    <li> great for course hair. Used it on my underarms. I had my sister help me and after pulling off the strip all of the hair came off after one application. I have used the lavender wax before but had to apply 2-3 times to get all the hair. I did microwave it for about 1:15. you don&#x27;t need a lot to get great results. I will continue using this product.</li>
    <li> I read other reviews and despite most being negative I assumed it was just people not following the directions, etc..Definitely not the case! No matter what I tried I could not get my coarse hair off! I did a test on my hand and I have normal/fine hairs on it and was able to get it off. But everywhere I have super coarse dark hair and it did not come off, just the wax! Yes it was a sticky mess while I was attempting waxing, but it was mostly taken off with oil. WASTE OF MONEY!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 20 yrs old and going on a cruise to the Bahamas, didn&#x27;t feel like paying $40 for a bikini wax so bought this, and it was actually great! It got all the hairs, and it honestly didn&#x27;t hurt. I have really thick hairs so I expected to be way worse. You have to use baby powder tho it&#x27;ll save a lot of pain. It&#x27;s great except for the sticky part bc I can&#x27;t close it and then open it later on with out struggling or hearing up first! Def recommend this.</li>
    <li> I got this kit and the Nair Roll On because it was my first time waxing and I wanted to see which worked better. I was skeptical about a roll on wax. This was a mess. I followed the directions, put on the wax with the spatula (wooden popsicle stick) and started pulling out my hair. It went great until I realized I COULD NOT GET THE WAX OFF MY SKIN! I tried many different things, but it just kept putting wax in more places. I got all panicky. I couldn&#x27;t even get enough wax off my fingers to check the internet on my phone for what to do.  A website said lotion. It didn&#x27;t work. It said try oil. I tried one, it didn&#x27;t work. The second oil I tried worked but I think I sloughed off my whole epidermis scrubbing it off. My bath mat is ruined. I could not get the wax out of my tub. My dad had to bring me Goo Gone. I will never use a Sally Hansen wax again.</li>
    <li> That was my second purchase of this kind product and works for us!!!&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend!</li>
    <li> All of the negative reviews seem to be from inexperienced people using the wax incorrectly. I used this wax after trying many other waxes that were not strong enough. Honey or sugar waxes just don&#x27;t cut it for me.  I love this wax, its inexpensive and it WORKS, but you *have* to be careful when waxing - don&#x27;t over heat the wax (it should not be runny when you apply it) and don&#x27;t apply too much. I have never burned myself or had any bad experience. The first couple of times were pretty messy because I didn&#x27;t know any better. Read up on how to wax before trying to do it to yourself.   You can use baby powder to prevent skin from coming off along with the hair, it really helps. And as for residue, you can pick up excess wax with a strip or by applying a small amount of wax over it. If not, the oil included in the box really does work to remove any left over wax, baby oil works too. I like to apply it to my skin and use a paper towel to take it off and it comes off pretty easily. Anyone who says otherwise should give a second chance.  If you can&#x27;t follow directions or if you can&#x27;t be neat (wax when pulled as it cools can leave strands flying - like a glue gun) or use it correctly, I don&#x27;t recommend you self wax at all.  I won&#x27;t say it&#x27;s not painful, because it can be - but you&#x27;re waxing, what do you expect? It also get much easier and less painful when you wax regularly. My hair is really growing in thinner and some areas do not grow hardly any hair at all now.  One note: If you have sensitive skin, read the box - it is extra strength.  My ONLY issue with this box is I wish it came with more strips, I always have wax left over, but no strips. I now buy Gigi strips so I always have enough.</li>
    <li> Bravo to those who can not only wax with this product but also somehow manage to get it off. I just used this wax one and a half hour ago and for the last hour i have been trying to get off the left over residue or the sticky messy stuff all over my legs. I used the oil that came with it. When that didn&#x27;t work i used the cream, then washed the whole thing away with soap and warm water. No use. Finally i used baby oil and managed to get most of it off, but there is still some left. I have used Nair before - wonderful product. However, this wax is the worst experience i have ever had. I don&#x27;t understand how it&#x27;s still in the market.</li>
    <li> Very messy, and when I applied it over half my hair stayed behind! For the pain I would expect more hair pulled! I used all my cloth strips and hardly any hair has been removed! So now my legs all splotchy with hair. If you want to wax yourself, pay more money for a better product.</li>
    <li> Terrible waxing kit. Seriously maybe it pulls like 3 or 4 hairs for the first try after that it&#x27;s just messy and it leaves you sticky with wax and still having those little hairs you wanted to get rid off. Do not buy or even try it even if it is a gift, just throw it away in the garbage!</li>
    <li> I have been waxing for about 20 years now, and had been going to salons to get this done. Since buying this product, I have been able to do a lot of easy-to-access areas at home. This is easily the best wax product I&#x27;ve bought from a store.  Best features: Easy to use, microwave-able, slides on to skin easily, and when used with Gigi-muslin strips, efficiently removes only hair (and is easy on the skin). Apply ice immediately after waxing, and when finished, use any body oil over skin.  Worst feature: if the wax drops onto a counter-top, it is difficult to clean. Solution: spread newspaper out when you start the process of waxing.  Once you buy it and learn how to use it correctly, you will always buy this product. Make sure you microwave it for an adequate amount of time, so that it is fluid and easy to apply to skin. I usually microwave it for approx. 60 seconds.  I feel this product deserves a better average review rating than it currently has, and is definitely well-priced at only about $10.</li>
    <li> I have been waxing myself since my teens and I am now 25. My friend is an esthetician and has waxed me many times so I have picked up a few tricks and I feel that I can say that I know what I am doing. I have used LOADS of different wax products, Nair, NADS, and many other Sally Hansen products. That being said:&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE this for my arms and legs. I do NOT like it for use on the bikini line, mustache, or eyebrows. I will use it if I am desperate but I MUCH prefer hard wax, Actually, I use the Sally Hansen Simple Spa Wax for my bikini line, etc.&lt;br /&gt;This wax smells very nice. BUT, I hate the strips that come with it (they&#x27;re near useless), so I went to the beauty supply store and paid $10 for good disposable strips to use with this (It&#x27;s a big pack so I&#x27;ve been through over 2 bottles of this stuff and still have more strips, so I think the additional strip investment is worth it). Cloth strips might be nice but I have never used those before, so disposable it is!&lt;br /&gt;You also need to keep this wax quite warm, so remicrowaving it several times is expected. Put old towels down because you will likely make a mess make a mess.&lt;br /&gt;I use baby oil (once I run out of the wax the kit comes with) and gauze (the texture helps) to scrub off left over wax.&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, I would HIGHLY recommend using baby powder before you wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have never been waxed before, go see a professional and observe them and take mental notes before you attempt an at home wax experiment.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t work all that well and man trying to get the residue off is horrible. It takes forever. Look at other brands, don&#x27;t try this one. Can&#x27;t imagine using it Brazilian style.</li>
    <li> This is the only home waxing kit I use. It is good and effective. After about 5 uses, I finally figured out how NOT to make a mess, but that&#x27;s more on my clumsy hands and less on the product. The was goes on, the hair and wax comes off. Then your skin is smooth for about two weeks.</li>
    <li> I am posting this review on amazon because i like this product but i didn&#x27;t buy it in amazon i bought it in a drug store but those looking for a waxing kit i highly recommend this product remember you can still return it so why not give it a try i guarantee you will be satisfy just make sure you follow the directions and start with a small amount.I am very happy to have found this product i was in search of a waxing kit and tried others and was very disappointed now this product is great i am in love with it in the past i had tried the Sally Hansen Micro Eyebrow-Lip &amp; Face Wax i was so disappointed with the product because i had to apply it more than once to remove my upper lip hair or eyebrow hair and the wax was a mess i had to throw it away,and i also tried the Nad&#x27;s Hair Removal Gel with Facial Wandnow it was worst!! i went to go return it to the store to get my money back i tried it for 20 times in one part of my skin to give it a tried and i was so mad because it didn&#x27;t take not even a single hair from my upper lip or eyebrow , now i dont have to search no more, i am happy to have found the sally Hansen all over body wax hair removal kit the only reason why i give it a 4 star is because if you get the wax into your skin is hard to remove that&#x27;s the only bad thing about this product but if you tried it you wont be disappointed if you follow the directions you wont get it into your skin i highly recommended for those that are looking for a product that works.</li>
    <li> They sent the wrong product, I didnt want to have to spend money to send it back.Used it and it started iff well except the wax never stayed hot long enough and it practically ripped my skin. Never again</li>
    <li> The wax isn&#x27;t perfect....but it works!  I&#x27;ve tried different products over the years and they simply don&#x27;t work.  This one pulls out the hair.  That&#x27;s the main point.  The negatives are that it cools and has to be re-heated a number of times while waxing legs.  Consistency seems to deteriorate a bit with repeated heating.  Never enough paper strips.  Must be supplemented.  Until something better comes along, I&#x27;ll stick with this.</li>
    <li> I did remove hair pretty easily but that was the easy part. Yes, between the microwaving 3 times, not enough wax to cover the entire body, and stickiness (it doesn&#x27;t harden), those were the easy parts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The absolutely horrifying part was trying to get rid of the excess wax on your skin afterwards (the little bottle of oil wasn&#x27;t nearly enough) and off the shower floor. The wax just does not come off. The waxing part took maybe 1 hour tops (so sticky!), but I spent the next 2 trying to get it off me and the floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips to get off skin:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- baby oil: rub it over the wax, using a washcloth will quicken the process, rinse. Took. Forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips to get off the floor:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- scrub and again, baby oil. I&#x27;m sure vinegar, ammonia, or other household cleaners would have worked fine but I used what I had at the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did get hair off, but to begin with, my hair&#x27;s pretty thin and I used the wax very quickly. I would not recommend and I would not buy or use it again.</li>
    <li> it worked great and the for the price, it is awesome !!!!  this is the first time I&#x27;m trying by myself and it was fantastic. I used gingely oil to remove the remaining wax before washing with water. would definitely recommend</li>
    <li> This wax is horrible. I followed the instructions exactly, and ended up with wax on everywhere. And I mean everywhere. Considering I was attempting to wax my bikini line you can imagine my horror as I peel off the strip and little to no hair is gone and I&#x27;m left with a sticky mess. The wax doesn&#x27;t harden. At all, at least not mine. When I opened it, it threw me off a little bit. It was like thin clay. Maybe playdoh. When I heated it up it seemed normal so I thought let&#x27;s try it. But as previously stated that didn&#x27;t work. It took me an hour to get all the wax and ended up having to trim and then shave my lady bits, which took even longer because the waxy hair kept preventing my razor from being able to get a close shave. I will never repurchase this item.</li>
    <li> I would NEVER recommend this to anyone.  I would tell anyone to definitely NOT TO USE IT.&lt;br /&gt;I used the ALL OVER BODY WAX HAIR REMOVAL KIT. I have used similar hair removal products for years but&lt;br /&gt;this was the first time for this product.&lt;br /&gt;Horrible, painful results even with closely following directions.&lt;br /&gt;The hair was removed but my arm was bruised and blistered my arm.&lt;br /&gt;The wax was not too hot.  The wax was holding on to my skin too tightly&lt;br /&gt;that when I pulled the cloth away, it bruised the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Very painful.</li>
    <li> Great product! Used it for the first time tonight and followed the instructions exactly.  Only complaint is there aren&#x27;t enough paper strips for full body or even just legs.  I only did my legs and have some spots left over simply because I didn&#x27;t have enough strips, so get extra! There is plenty of wax if put on in thin layers as the instructions state.  I only ended up with a few red spots, mostly around my knees, but even with professional waxes my skin gets a little rashy.  Pain is as expected for a wax so be prepared for that - only stings for a little.  Some say it&#x27;s messy and it was a little bit, but the blue oil that comes with the kit easily cleaned up excess wax on my skin and on the bench I was working on.  As others stated I did have to reheat a couple times - I agree a small warmer would come in handy.  All and all I&#x27;m really satisfied with this product, I imagine doing other small areas would be just as easy if not easier than a large area like the legs! Took off a star just for the fact that there were not enough strips, way too many sticks and I would like a little more of the blue oil.</li>
    <li> Wax seemed really old. Better off buying from Walmart.</li>
    <li> While on vacation I watched as a friend removed her unwanted lip hair with this product. She did it so easily and her lip was hair free. I have used tweezers to remove any hair that I found bothersome or unsightly, but after a while the tweezers leave marks. I used the wax. I heated it up and applied the wax with the supplied stick. It goes on warm. If feels really good. I let it sit on my lip for a few minutes and then applied the paper supplied in the box to my lip on top of the wax. I pressed the paper onto the wax smoothing the paper over my lip. Next I quickly ripped the paper from my lip. When I looked at the paper, there was wax and hair embedded inside. My lip was hair free and I was happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to be really careful with the wax. It&#x27;s not easy to clean from surfaces. To prevent the wax from dripping onto counters I roll the stick around until all the wax is seated on the stick. If you happen to let the wax drip near the top it will be hard to remove the top for you next use. The hardest thing with this product is making sure the wax only touches three surfaces, the stick, your skin and the paper. There is a finishing oil included. A dab of this will remove wax from your finger tips if they happen to come in contact with the wax. Although sticks are provided for wax application, it&#x27;s not many. Your wax supply will far outlive the sticks. The paper sheets I cut in half. There are plenty.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Sally Hansen All-Over Body wax kit for many years now.  They NEVER put enough cloth strips in the kit.  I&#x27;m assuming this is to force customers to buy additional kits (??)  In the past, I&#x27;ve emailed SH customer service for more strips (I&#x27;ve offered to pay for them) and they&#x27;ve always sent me more in the mail, free of charge.  Over the course of the past 3 weeks, I&#x27;ve attempted to email SH (now Coty customer service) and have received &amp;#34;Wax incident customer complaint forms&amp;#34; in the mail.  I&#x27;ve called the 800 number as well only to be told &#x27;we&#x27;re out of them&amp;#34; and my favorite &amp;#34;your account shows we mailed you some back in 2012 and it&#x27;s a one-time courtesy&amp;#34; I have two complaints - 1 - provide your customers with more cloth strips in these kits or sell them at stores separately and -2- hire people in your customer service department that aren&#x27;t idiots.  Looking for another hair removal product.</li>
    <li> Not user friendly at all !!!!!! how they can sell this thing to the public? the wax ends up being one thick, gloppy, sticky mess and it ends up pulling on skin and leaving it bloody. It&#x27;s very hard to be precise with this, and I honestly started to panic while doing one of my armpits because I couldn&#x27;t get the upper hair removed. thankfully it finally got peeled off but it left the skin a bit bloody, which freaked me out. I&#x27;m not totally new to waxing, so I know what I&#x27;m doing. I did use the azulene finishing oil as well as a homemade pure lavender oil and water spray AFTERwards which has helped. I also did use some dry powder as some posters suggested BEFORE applying any of the wax. i&#x27;m not sure how much it helped, but I would NEVER Use this product if i knew what I know now. And I can&#x27;t imagine how someone can use this on any sensitive areas without going to the ER afterwards !!! Seriously, this is just not worth it. I&#x27;m considering getting cold wax strips where u don&#x27;t have to deal with a sticky, imprecise, weighty blob.</li>
    <li> This wax kit is fantastic- it easily grabs hairs and removes them with little pain. I have very sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all. I would definitely recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER. There is such a thing as too much of a good thing. This wax takes no prisoners- Once this wax stuck to my hairs and skin, the only way it was coming off was on a paper strip or with the provided azulene oil. It takes quite a bit of effort to get the wax residue off my skin after I&#x27;m done. Additionally, never get this product on any hair you intend to keep because you will be SOL. I did not use talcum powder or baby powder and maybe this would have made a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for an effective way to wax hair without all the residue, I recommend Sally Hansen sugar wax, which comes off with a warm shower no problem.</li>
    <li> (I&#x27;m writing this from my husband&#x27;s amazon account.) Tired of paying $50 to $60 dollars for a Brazilian at the salon I decided to try this product.  I was super scared to try this and honestly thought I was going to end up with a big painful mess.  While the wax was a bit messy it did a good job at pulling out my hairs and came off easily with the provided oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a professional waxing done about 4 weeks ago and most of my hairs were slightly under half an inch long. It states on the box that it shouldn&#x27;t take longer than 1 minute to warm the wax enough so that you can apply a thin layer.  This was not true for my little 700 watt microwave.  It took me about a minute thirty seconds. I stopped it every thirty seconds and stirred the wax.  Before waxing I applied baby powder to my lady bits as that is supposed to help the wax stick to the hairs and not your skin.  I think it worked well because it was actually less painful than my experiences at the salon.  Make sure to follow the directions.  Apply a thin layer in the direction of hair growth.  Apply a strip and rub in the direction of hair growth.  Pull up strip quickly in the opposite direction of hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest putting an old towel under yourself while doing this as the wax is easy to spill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.  The only down side is how messy it can be.  I was able to remove almost all my hair and those I didn&#x27;t are due to my inexperience with waxing and not the product.</li>
    <li> This product is for anyone who hates shaving or has really coarse hair. It works great just make sure you have help!!</li>
    <li> I read all of the reviews and thought I would follow the advice of putting baby powder on the area before use and keeping the wax container in a bowl of hot water. I think out of the 20 wax strips I used, maybe 3 were successful. This wax is so messy and ended up all over me and my bathroom and even with the baby powder, bruised the crap out of my skin because the strip wouldn&#x27;t take up all the wax/hair and just pull the hair. Two days later I am still sticky even with the oil that comes with the kit. Good thing I tried this a couple weeks before my husband came home, because the red, bruised, sticky patches on my body certainly are not sexy.</li>
    <li> I would not get this, if I were you. I got it at the store today, thinking I could deal with it. The thing is, the actual pulling off the strip was not bad...it was the aftermath. One part on my leg had wax caked on and it was a pain in the *** to get off. I used oil, which helped tremendously. But let me save you some money and time: Just don&#x27;t get this and just shave. It&#x27;s not worth dealing with. I could have already been done shaving by the time I was done trying to get this crap off my leg. I hate this. I was almost in tears trying to get it off.</li>
    <li> I was so surprised by the low reviews of this product, when I went on Amazon to buy it (since I couldn&#x27;t find it my local stores), I wondered if it was the same one I&#x27;ve loved for years. It is! This is the absolute best waxing product I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;m Italian and have the kind of hair that laughs at the &amp;#34;sugar based,&amp;#34; &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34; waxing products. So yes, this stuff is sticky...it has to be! As long as you use it correctly, any tiny remnants are easily removed with the after-waxing oil. This product works better than any pro waxing place I&#x27;ve gone (disclaimer: I use it only for my &amp;#34;tummy stripe&amp;#34; and haven&#x27;t tried it on other areas.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for quite some time now. Very effective and easy to use</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been waxing at home for years. I always use self hardening wax as I find the strips painful. Not this! I was actually amazed and pleasantly surprised at how painless this wax was. I took one star off only because I felt a sticky residue in some areas after waxing, but the included oil took care of that. I would buy again!</li>
    <li> Awesome!!! Justa great product to put it does its job and only down fall its that its a big messy at first</li>
    <li> I swear by this brand of hard wax. I have been using this to wax my entire body since high school and I won&#x27;t be switching until I become wealthy enough to get regular waxes every week. Being able to wax at home means you can wax more frequently, and this is a definite plus. I warm up the wax for about a minute, apply some to the wooden stick, blow on it to cool for a second, and apply. Always direct the hair in the opposite direction in which you plan to rip out your hair. When the wax is very hot and thinly applied, that is when results are the best. Can be used anywhere on the body for a smooth finish. It has been difficult to locate this in Target and Wal-Mart anymore, so I am glad that Amazon stocks this regularly.</li>
    <li> Do not buy these! About 5 hours after a lackluster wax from these, I noticed red spots and torn skin. It kept getting worse throughout the night and now it looks like I have 1st degree burns allover my forearms. I warmed the strips with a hair dryer to a comfortable temperature, so it wasn&#x27;t that. I truly believe these pulled my top layer of skin loose and now it is sloughing off as if I had a terrible sun burn. I have pictures to prove it and will be seeking a full refund.</li>
    <li> The wax does its job. It removes hair. If you have waxed at home a few times, you shouldn&#x27;t have any problem with getting the product to work properly. That being said, WHY doesn&#x27;t it wash off with WATER, like other kinds of wax ??? Waxing is messy. You will get some of it on the sink, your hands, the floor if you&#x27;re not careful, and I have personally never managed to wax without some bits of it remaining on my legs. I would have appreciated not having to spend 20 minutes scratching my legs even rawer with the mostly inefficient oil , and 10 minutes more scratching at the sink, getting the sticky mess on the sponge in the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t even try getting if off the strips. For this price I could have gotten another brand with more wax and washable strips for another use. It did its job, but in the poorest way possible</li>
    <li> arrived on time and as described</li>
    <li> I have been waxing for 20 years at home with Persian, which is found everywhere in Canada. I didn&#x27;t find it in the pharmacy when on vacation in Florida, so I figured I would try something different and bought the Sally Hansen at CVS. It seems to do the job (my eyesight is not what it was, and I have the feeling that it broke some of the hairs instead of pulling them). It is also messy to apply, leaves a sticky residue that takes a lot of effort to remove and is full of chemicals. The Persian (http://www.amazon.com/Parissa-Cold-Hair-Remover-Persian/dp/B004X8HPMG/ref&#x3D;sr_1_4?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1428515297&amp;sr&#x3D;8-4&amp;keywords&#x3D;persian+wax) is a sugar-based natural wax, dilutes in water (you just jump in the shower after you wax), is cheaper, lets you wash and reuse the strips, and works just as well if not better. Verdict: I will never purchase this product again.  NEXT DAY UPDATE: It also gave me a painful rash in the underarm area!</li>
    <li> I hate the stubble that comes with shaving so I only wax every few weeks. This is the only wax I use now. I&#x27;ve tried a ton of different kinds. It&#x27;s not water soluble (those kinds don&#x27;t really work), so you are likely to have some little spots of wax left over, but the oil that comes with it helps get rid of it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product and got a spray bottle instead of the wax kit.</li>
    <li> great wax…one of the best out there</li>
    <li> This is an ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE PRODUCT. I bought mine new in the local walmart. At the end of the day after using this, I spent MORE time and MORE money trying to clean it up. MY SKIN STILL HAS WAX THIS VERY MOMENT. It stained my clothes and got on my bedsheets and I&#x27;m just TERRIBLY UNHAPPY. I still have a ton of hair, I probably would&#x27;ve gotten a better shave than using this crap of a product. I&#x27;D GIVE IT A NEGATIVE IF I COULD. Please save your money and go buy something else!</li>
    <li> I read a beauty blog about how great these strips are because they are so easy to use. I honestly can&#x27;t remember if that was a sponsered post.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These strips were money down the drain and I should have just gone to get a wax professionally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To begin with, I would never allow someone to wax me with wax strips they warmed up with their hands, so why I continued with these strips is beyond me. Secondly, the wax strips were bigger than my hands so I guess I didn&#x27;t warm the wax enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hardly any hair was removed and my skin was so sticky afterwards. That oil didn&#x27;t do much to remove the residue and the cotton ball just started stick to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read a number of reviews and it seems this product is most effective when used in ways other than described on the box. I bought this product for convenience, not to heat water to warm wax, apply baby powder, use my own muslin strips and after oil!</li>
    <li> the best wax i have found yet. highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product off and on for the past 6 years between professional waxes if I can&#x27;t get an appointment when I need it, or I&#x27;m trying to save $$.  I&#x27;ve been having professional Brazilian waxes year round for 15 years, and so I already had a good idea of the process.  I think that&#x27;s key for this wax.  If you&#x27;ve not had a few GOOD professional waxes, it can be hard to figure out the technique all on your own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great wax product.  I agree it&#x27;s annoying that there aren&#x27;t enough strips.  I can get up to 5 waxes out of one kit, so even when I buy more muslin strips, it&#x27;s far less expensive than a professional job (I&amp;#34;ve paid as little as $30 in rural MO and as much as $55 in urban TX).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re having an issue with clean up you just pour some of the azulene (a little puddle, dime size) in your palm and just rub it all over.  I do this if I drip on the floor or counter too -- rub it with my oily hand until it&#x27;s gone.  You can even put it on a paper towel.  No biggie.</li>
    <li> Okay so i actually brought this product last night from the store. needless to say, my boyfriend had to help me with the entire waxing process. Im half and half on my decision. My best advice is to 1. If you have long hair down there, trim it before you use it or your going to be screaming like somebody is tryna kill you. and 2. make sure the wax is hot. LOL i had a very entertaining time trying to wax myself, ill just leave it up ti the professionals.</li>
    <li> It did not make get delivered by the expected date. How disappointing! I would look for another item when I get a chance.</li>
    <li> This product is so hard to use.  It&#x27;s hard to get the wax to the right temperature, it&#x27;s hard to spread, it gets absolutely everywhere, and it&#x27;s hard to clean up.  You need about a gallon of oil to clean up after each use but they only give you a tiny little vial.  I will be going back to the ready-to-use prewaxed strips.</li>
    <li> I have been waxing since the past ten years. I have always used sugar based waxes that look kinda golden, and wash off easily with warm water. Since Sally Hansen is such a reputed company, I tried this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the instructions on the booklet. I tried it on my legs only (thankfully). Here is my experience:&lt;br /&gt;Pros: I must say, it did a good job removing the hair.&lt;br /&gt;The wax is microwavable, can be microwaved multiple times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- It is a horribly sticky mess! Firstly, I had trouble getting the lid off, then after microwaving and applying, it started solidifying immediately on my skin, even before I could apply the strip! Though it removed the hair, the strip stuck to my skin... I had such a hard time ripping it off. There was still a layer of wax on me. I could just not get it off. I tried oil, detergent, apricot scrub, and lastly scrub for utensils! I still feel there is a little wax left on me!&lt;br /&gt;- It is so damn sticky, the newspaper I had spread out stuck to me, the faucet, the bathtub, the microwave button were all sticky. I spent 2.5 hours cleaning myself up and the bathroom! Not to mention, I had not reserved this much time for a grooming ritual and landed up being very late for a party.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, please do not try this product. If you do, try on a small patch in your legs, even if you are an experienced waxer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just hope Walmart gives me my money back! All in all, it was a dreadful experience.&lt;br /&gt;Sally Hansen should seriously consider modifying this product.</li>
    <li> I buy this at Walmart all the time, and even though I am a repeat customer of this product, I am giving it 2 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s start with the good:&lt;br /&gt;You can find this product nearly everywhere, so if interested just take a ride to your closest pharmacy or big box store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kit includes the wax, 18 strips, some wooden sticks, and oil for cleanup/soothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a VERY relaxing scent that reminds me of vanilla and lavendar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And here is the harsh truth:&lt;br /&gt;This product isn&#x27;t good for thick hair... at all. I once attempted waxing my legs and went through the excruciating pain of pulling the paper only to find about 10 hairs on the strip. All that pain for nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first use, it is likely that you got a spot on the rim, especially from swiping the bottom of the wooden spoon. Try getting the cap open in about a week or so; it&#x27;s difficult. I actually have to pry it open with a butter knife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The strips run out EXTREMEMY fast. Not nearly enough to wax &#x27;all over&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also think the wooden sticks are a bit too big for smaller areas. I use this wax for my eyebrows only so I need to purchase the smaller ones from the dollar store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What doesn&#x27;t get taken off with the strip must be removed with the oil. It does make for easy clean up of leftover, but oily skin is awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hairless skin does NOT last 8 weeks,  hence the wordS &#x27;up to&#x27;. My hair stubbles start growing back as soon as 3 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can only use this product on my eyebrows because it only works well on fine hairs. I think it gives false hope with their tricky words, so just keep these things in mind. I still use it because it doesn&#x27;t give me any irritation on my brows, but will never attempt to wax anything else on my body with this product.</li>
    <li> One star is way to much for this horrible stuff! First of all, I had to use a pair of pliers to remove the plastic lid inside the top, and by the time I FINALLY for it off, twisting it, this wax was all over my hands! And there is no tips in how to get it off! I used a strong fingernail polish remover and that burned my skin. And I was scared to pull the strips too hard after I had them intact because I was afraid they would take my skin to the bone with the strip! Come on Sally Hansen you can do better than this. I have been using Sally Hansen products for years and years and even used wax products, but not this one. In fact, when it said microwaveable I thought I was getting the same old Sally Hansen wax. Boy was I ever fooled!!&lt;br /&gt;I would think long and hard before buying this awful mess! Read the reviews! There are much better products out there than this mess!</li>
    <li> The best wax I have used so far. A  little sticky but that is expected and any residual is easily removable with any type of oil.</li>
    <li> Before purchasing this wax...I had a different wax, also made by Sally Hanson, that was WONDERFUL.  It removed hair wonderfully and the paper strips washed off easily so I could reuse OVER AND OVER again.  I only use wax above my lip, so the wax lasted for a few years and the paper strips looked brand new even after two years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOW THIS WAX....TERRIBLE.  It is NOT water soluble...so the application sticks, the paper strips and your skin are left with the gooey mess that WON&#x27;T wash off.  I have to throw away the strips after one use, which means they will be gone very soon and I will have lots of wax leftover and no strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another horrible part....getting the wax off your hands and skin!!! I actually had to pull out my finger nail polish remover and use that to get the goop off my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The worst part....it will leave your skin raw and bleeding.  It does a better job tearing your skin off than it does hair. My skin above my lip is left with big unsightly red blotches all over that take days to heal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sally Hanson can do better than this...I know it...because I have used their previous wax and LOVED it!  This wax is a total FLOP! BRING BACK THE OTHER STUFF!  THIS ONE SUCKS!!!!</li>
    <li> The first time I tried a microwavable wax it was my sophomore year in high school back in 2007. Actually, it was my first time trying any kind of wax. I used it for my upper lip and the first time trying it I ended up burning my poor upper lip and never again tried another microwavable wax again! Years later I decided to buy those wax strips that you rub with your hands to start using on my armpits. Those never ever worked! I TRIED to use them for years and with no luck. About a month ago I decided to buy en epilator. No matter how careful I was and how well I used the epilator it ended cutting my armpits badly. I couldn&#x27;t wear any short sleeved shirts. I ended up returning the epilator last week. So fast forward to today and I end up buying another microwavable wax. I was skeptical it wasn&#x27;t going to work because waxes aren&#x27;t really for me. I was surprised when I used this and it actually removed all of my armpit hair! The best part, IT DIDN&#x27;T EVEN HURT. WHAT?! When I pulled off the strip and it didn&#x27;t hurt one bit, I thought &amp;#34;Oh well. I guess this is another wax that didn&#x27;t work.&amp;#34; but when I glanced at the strip and saw it pulled off my hair I was so happy! This is my first time using it so I&#x27;ll have to give another updated after I run out of wax to see if this really does deserve the 5 stars I give it so far.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best wax I have ever used. But beware! it is extremely strong so be careful of any spills!</li>
    <li> Using this product was a total fiasco. Not only was the process messy, but not all of my hair was removed. Although the ouch factor was low, the hassle and time was so not worth it. Afterwards, the wax would not come off my legs no matter what I did (even the teeny amount of wax removing oil did little to help) and I spent 40 minutes trying to get it off and there&#x27;s still wax residue on me. I advise to not use this product, and to either get a professional wax or stick to a razor.</li>
    <li> This product is a lawsuit waiting to happen. I got a free sample of it with my gojane purchase and thought that it would be a potential buy. I always get my eyebrows done at the nail shop, but imagine how much money I could save by doing it myself?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it on my arm first to test it out, it removed the hair okay. I then placed part of the strip onto my eyebrow and attempted to pull away....I get left with a big sloppy, sticky mess. It was gooey and gross...nothing like the consistency of wax. I tried to wash it off with warm soapy water but that only made it worse. It smeared all over my brow and my eyelid. After struggling to get it off and bleeding, I had to go get some Goo Gone just to get this crap off to prevent practically going blind! There still was a thin sticky residue all over my hands, arm and eye area left over...even after all that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not understand why this was ever put out to people for use. Save yourself and don&#x27;t even think about using this crap, free or not. This needs to be discontinued immediately!</li>
    <li> A few weeks ago, I cut myself shaving my legs. It was pretty bad and I swore off shaving. I decided to look into getting a wax, but didn&#x27;t have the time to schedule an appointment. Well, the weather warmed up and its too hot for jeans now so I had to make a decision. I decided to try this home wax kit before reading any reviews. My mistake. Sally Hansen is usually a brand I trust, so I figured I&#x27;d go for it. I purchased this kit tonight and came home to get started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions to a T. After some bad home hair dye jobs, I am cautious about reading the directions several times before beginning. As I was getting started, things were going well. Most of the hair was coming off and I figured what wouldn&#x27;t, I&#x27;d grin and bear it with a razor. Finally I got to my knees. I decided to do them in halves. I put wax on one part of my knee, put the strip on, did everything like the directions said, and ripped it off. Only...the wax came off in painful strings and most of the wax was still on my knee. I tried again and still no dice. The wax, still warm and sticky, would not come off. I used the oil that came in the kit and still nothing. Finally I got in the shower with a wash cloth and scrubbed until my knees were raw and still the wax remained. I put on lotion in the shower and scrubbed and I even tried putting hair conditioner on and scrubbing. Nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is still all over my fingers as well. I tried to scrub that off with the cloth and eventually a tooth brush with soap on it but they&#x27;re still sticky. And even after my shower, as I am writing this, there are globs on wax on my knees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not purchase this product. Go to a professional. It may seem worth it at first, but its not.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that alot of people were giving this product a bad review but after reading their comments I figured that most of the reviewers didn&#x27;t know a simple trick to make this wax worth your money. So I&#x27;m posting it now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Items you need before using this product:&lt;br /&gt;- Baby powder&lt;br /&gt;- Kleenix/tissue paper&lt;br /&gt;- bowl of hot water (enough water to surround the wax container to keep it warm) if you don&#x27;t have a wax warmer&lt;br /&gt;-the product itself (oil, wax, paper strips &amp; wooden stick)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Steps:&lt;br /&gt;1- Warm up the wax to make it semi-liquid in the microwave (usually a few second does the trick), use the wooden stick to stir the wax [Please note: you don&#x27;t want the wax to be runny like water, should be like a pasty consistency that&#x27;s a little runny]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2- Place the wax container in the bowl of hot water to keep wax warm&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3- Use a Kleenix/tissue paper to pat the area you want waxed with baby powder so you have a white layer of powder on that area (helps prevent the wax from sticking to your skin)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4- Spread the wax onto the powdered area and immediately put a paper strip over the wax (slightly patting it onto the wax)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5- When the wax is not so warm/ thick (a couple seconds later after putting the paper strip on) pull the strip quickly in the opposite direction of the way your hair is growing [it&#x27;s going to hurt not going to lie but if you do it fast enough it&#x27;s not that bad, just think of your new hairless skin when you pull]. If you aren&#x27;t fast with your hands, having someone else (friend, spouse, family member, etc...) will make pulling the strip less stressful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6- Repeat steps 3-5, the powdering of your skin where ever you plan to wax to prevent pulling off your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7- Use the oil (blue bottle) that is supplied to any wax residue to rub off the wax on your skin (do this after your done waxing)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8- Take a shower, then put lotion on the spots that were waxed and you have your perfectly waxed skin to show off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quick profile:&lt;br /&gt;Male&lt;br /&gt;Asian&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Took a star off for not having enough wax to actually do a full body wax.e your perfectly waxed skin to show off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quick profile:&lt;br /&gt;Male&lt;br /&gt;Asian&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Took a star off for not having enough wax to actually do a full body wax.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worked in a spa and have done numerous waxes on myself and coworkers using our company&#x27;s wax pots and supplies. Hard wax (stripless wax) is typically less painful to use because it does not pull on the skin as much as strip wax. However, for larger areas such as back, chest, arms, and legs, strip wax is more efficient because it can wax larger surfaces (hard wax works best when applied in teeny segments). With all that in mind, I found this kit not to do anything so great for my face or bikini/Brazilian area. However, I liked it for my legs and my arms. One major tip is that the instructions say to microwave for 30 seconds, but I found that was not nearly enough time! You want the wax to be as hot as possible (hot, but not painful on your skin) so it comes off with the strip. You should be able to stir it around without too nuch resistance. I found when the wax cooled down too much, it wouldn&#x27;t come off with the strip, as other reviewers have mentioned. There isn&#x27;t a lot of cleanup oil included, but any oil will work (tanning, baby, cooking oils) with a cotton ball. The wax has a soft floral fragrance, too.</li>
    <li> So I have never waxed anything aside from my eye brows. But this weekend is our 1 year wedding anniversary and were going away to live on the beach and I want to wear my bikini bottoms! I did not read up on it before I bought it, it was $12 so I figured what the heck. It was my first time so it was messy. I had no idea about the baby powder thing, so I will try that next time. It got a lot of hair off, but not all. Wasn&#x27;t nearly as painful as I prepared myself for. And it did leave a small bruise which Im hoping will be gone by saturday (5 days). My skin started to get irritated so I stopped. But I plan to shower tonight, loosen the hair follicles, apply the baby powder, and do it again just to get all the leftovers.&lt;br /&gt;Also now that Im reading the reviews I did not have it hot enough (mine was very thick and hard) and I did not wait for it to set. And for fear of the pain I don&#x27;t think I ripped it off fast enough.  So I will be sure to do that all next time. But over all I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
    <li> I am black with very very thick underarm hair, it does not grip the hair but my skin! I put baby powder under it and it managed to grip less skin and only 3 strains of hair. The wax works for thinner hair like my arms or legs, but I dont grow much hair in those places to begin with.</li>
    <li> I love this wax and I use it regularly on my underarms and my bikini area.  I have not had any problems.  I read some of the other reviews, and I think that many of the complaints come from users who are unfamiliar with waxing/ have little experience doing it themselves.  I recommend getting waxed professionaly before trying it out yourself.  The first time can be very difficult/ painful, bt it gets better!</li>
    <li> TOO MESSY&lt;br /&gt;this is horrible. i love sally hansen products and i must say i was disappointed with this one. It is super sticky and super messy. I bought the sally hansen microwavable eyebrow, face and lip kit first and it was fabulous. The wax is easy to heat, super easy to clean. and it does exactly what a wax should do without the mess. HOWEVER, purchasing this product was contrary to my belief. NOT BUYING THIS AGAIN. Seriously sally hansen, what happened!</li>
    <li> Great product for at home waxing! Easy to use and clean removal on first strip. Wax does get sticky if left on skin but oil included in kit works great to remove any remaining wax. 3 bikini waxes per kit.</li>
    <li> Its a great product but not for all the body.. It perfect for under arm and the bikkini line...&lt;br /&gt;But one advice for everyone.. To make this work and to have a perfect result.. Dont use it on long hair.. And put some baby powder before u apply the wax..</li>
    <li> I am a black female and finding waxes very hard I went to Walmart and I found this works it is the most amazing product I have ever used I tried nair and hair removing products and it caused. me nothing but ingrown hairs I&#x27;ve shaved and I got nothing but a growing down there also this wax removed my hair with no pain the most I felt was the shock I put in the microwave and I heated up for three minutes and I applied after I blew on it on the wooden stick I will be buying more especially off of Amazon</li>
    <li> I am a self-waxing newbie. The only thing I ever had waxed was my eyebrows and lip area, which I get done professionally at a salon. This was my first ever experience with home waxing (it was an impulse purchase while wandering around Target).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, this product DOES work. I used it on my face (between my brows, on my cheeks, and around my lips), my lower legs, and my bikini area. It hurts, but the only time it&#x27;s extremely painful is on certain parts of the bikini area if you&#x27;re going for the brazilian look. One thing I will say and recommend is that you do NOT do a full brazilian with this. I stopped in the areas where it really felt like I just couldn&#x27;t rip the paper off without taking my skin with it (mostly the fatty areas and the closer you get to the true &#x27;private&#x27; area / thin skinned part). I had very little trouble with just the bikini line, if that&#x27;s all you&#x27;re going for. I wound up doing the bikini line, the top part (like where the top of your underwear sits) and a few areas lower as tolerated. Honestly, the areas I was able to wax tend to be the most noticeable for stubble, so if you can do those parts then use a brand new razor for the rest, you&#x27;ll be pretty darn smooth. Some is better than none, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another tip I&#x27;d suggest is when working in the bikini area, do very small sections at a time (as small as a quarter). This is for two reasons: one, the pain is less overwhelming when working in smaller areas, and two, the hair in this area grows so many different directions that it&#x27;s just causing yourself undue pain to work in a big area and only take off half the hair, break most of the other hairs in half without removing the root, then trying to do it all over. It takes longer to do the small sections, but it&#x27;s easier in the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the same topic, I&#x27;d definitely recommend cutting each strip of paper into about 5 pieces for smaller areas (using a whole sheet would be fine on legs etc). At first, I tried using awhole sheet for the bikini area, but it&#x27;s much easier and you won&#x27;t run out of paper if you cut the paper into strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to hold the skin taut as you pull and pull QUICKLY. Then immediately dab the skin with the same paper and rip again a few times and it helps with missed hairs and also with stickiness / excess wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the full bikini area, use a grainy sugar scrub or a hot washcloth the day before to exfoliate and reduce the chances of ingrown hairs after waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be afraid to reheat the wax as many times as you need to. I had to maybe once every five minutes, but that&#x27;s not a big deal. I noticed that, as the instructions indicate, a thin layer seems to work much better than a thick layer, so keeping the wax hot and runny facilitates applying a coating that isn&#x27;t too thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the huge caveat. These people aren&#x27;t kidding about the stickiness and the mess. Holy moley. I thought maybe the other reviewers weren&#x27;t being careful enough, and for the first 10-15 minutes or so it&#x27;s fine, but eventually you&#x27;ll feel like you used Gorilla Glue for lotion. Seriously! I felt like Clark Griswold&#x27;s wife in National Lampoon&#x27;s Christmas Vacation, that scene where they&#x27;re laying in bed and they have tree sap on their hands and the magazine pages get stuck on their hands....yeah, that was me! With everything! It&#x27;s all over my bathroom floor, my counters, I&#x27;m sure it will all stick to my trashcan, but worst of all, it&#x27;s all OVER ME! And it doesn&#x27;t wash off, not even with scalding hot water, I tried using soap, I tried using a sugar scrub, *NOTHINGGGG* takes this stuff off. I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s a Saturday morning and I don&#x27;t have to go to work tomorrow constantly pulling my underwear off my skin through my clothes so my co-workers think I have crabs. This is bad. Really bad. Like, I already showered, yet as I type this the blanket is stuck to my foot, my pants are stuck to my &#x27;private area,&#x27; my fingers keep getting stuck together,if I cross my legs I have to rip them apart....the stickiness is NO JOKE. I have no idea how long this will last but I&#x27;m worried I&#x27;ll look like a used lint roller sheet before the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And not the first clue as to how I&#x27;ll get it off my bathroom counters etc. Even touching the hard / dried wax is like touching superglue! A paper towel won&#x27;t do anything but smear it and get stuck. So please be careful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, it works, so if you&#x27;re really looking to save a lot of money by waxing at home, it&#x27;s worth trying. IF you can handle being human adhesive for a few days.</li>
    <li> I used to buy Sally Hansen sugar wax which worked great and washed off with water. This new stuff is vile, it doesn&#x27;t wash off with soap and water, or the included solvent, or gojo, or alcohol. It leaves a sticky residue on your skin that does not come off no matter what you do. It doesn&#x27;t even work, to boot.</li>
    <li> If you are not an experienced at home waxer this is not the kit to start with. It is not easy to use, or helpful. First off it doesn&#x27;t heat well, and is a weird consistency. Then when applying it is thick and hard to get on. The strips do not work well with the wax and don&#x27;t take off a considerable amount of hair. Also this wax is IMPOSSIBLE to get off. I would not recommend using this, it is terrible. I have heard nair works far better so if you are planning to use a waxing kit, please go with nair.</li>
    <li> From a hairy veteran who has undergone many pull and tug wars, this is the best HANDS DOWN&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so hairy that I have to wax my feet, I have gone through many waxes trying to get the hair off my feet and this took out every single hair, it was finally a day of VICTORY for me&lt;br /&gt;For my \\&quot;miss-stauche\\&quot; it took out hairs that I didnt even know were there!&lt;br /&gt;For my bikini line, ditto, and it didnt hurt that bad!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hansen was doesnt cool down as fast as other which makes for a QUICK and EASY session&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;USE THE FINISHING OIL&lt;br /&gt;its really important that you use the finishing oil, it helps you scrape out the extra wax on your body&lt;br /&gt;Also it lessens the amount of breakouts:&lt;br /&gt;I didnt use the finishing oil the first time and I broke out like crazy! But my 2nd time I almost didnt break out at all&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah its a little messy, but for the results I dont mind it at all&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A+++++++ product!</li>
    <li> I had used Sally Hansen wax strips for years, and I bought this kit instead on impulse.  Boy am I ever glad I did!  It&#x27;s much simpler, much less painful and much more efficient than the wax strips.  I used it for the bikini zone (I do not recommend self-Brazilian, but for shaping/clean up, it works very well), and it was quick and thorough.  I was able to be much more precise than with the strips.  This will be my go-to from now on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note:&lt;br /&gt;- I have a high pain tolerance.  By my standards this was a 1/10.&lt;br /&gt;- I have been waxing my bikini-zone for years using other methods; this kit may be more difficult for beginners.&lt;br /&gt;- I trimmed the hair to 1/2&amp;#34; before waxing&lt;br /&gt;- I heated the wax by microwaving for 50 seconds in a 1100w microwave</li>
    <li> So I bought this at a regular store, same product same everything. I regret it to this day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I heated up the wax until hot but not too hot temp. The wax looked like white honey.&lt;br /&gt;So I applied a very thin layer in my -you know- spot. Tried to pull it off but it only got some hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It left a red,red rash on my vag for about a week or so.&lt;br /&gt;But that&#x27;s not the worst part, the worst part is that I got a fever from it.&lt;br /&gt;Luckily, I took my pills,everything and my infection went away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It scared the shiz out of me.&lt;br /&gt;Also, even when you pull of the wax there&#x27;s ALOT  left over.&lt;br /&gt;Even if you try using the soothing oil and such, there&#x27;s still alot of wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really don&#x27;t trust this product.</li>
    <li> This product works very, very well and exactly how it should. Waxing is tricky and can be messy. If it spills, it is difficult to clean up.  (For spills use something disposable (a plastic knife or spoon) Use a hair dryer to warm it up and use something to scrap it up and throw it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use a hair dryer on the skin to warm wax if wax on the skin remains, and the cloths strips and try again. Use the oil only for little spots of residue left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the wax (sugar) that can wash away with water. it makes clean up so easy. But for stubburn hairs this works better than sugar waxing. The only thing that works for me.</li>
    <li> The result is defenitely perfect and wax is not really hot.&lt;br /&gt;Kinda painful thing but not too much. It&#x27;s also pretty easy to use even you never did it before</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a new waxer, recently starting with home made sugar wax and getting fed up with the sticky messiness of it.  So I went to my local grocery store and grabbed this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It worked great on my legs.  The hair was removed easily (I had about a week of growth) but my hair isn&#x27;t coarse on my legs.  The bikini area didn&#x27;t yield the same results, but the hair is a bit different there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My problem with this product is that it where the wax isn&#x27;t stripped off it is nearly impossible to clean off you.  This might be a feature of all waxes; I can&#x27;t really say as I haven&#x27;t tried them all.  But even after scrubbing in the hot shower with soap and water, my pants are still sticking to my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not exactly the sexy smooth I was going for.</li>
    <li> The product works that&#x27;s why I am giving it 2 stars but it has to be heated again and again. I bought it from Target and it was summers so the room temperature was not like cold. I heated the bottle in microwave for almost 1 minute as instructed . For 5 minutes it was all okay but I realized after that it became sticky. I almost hurt myself while trying to pull out the wax. Reheating helped but it was needed every 5 minutes. This was painful and almost the same as buying a traditional wax heater and using it. I ended up hurting myself multiple times as I am a newbie at doing it myself and wouldn&#x27;t know the exact consistency when it went thick enough that it wouldn&#x27;t come out. After a few trials it was a painful realization that it needs to be heated almost every 5 minutes... Huh ... That&#x27;s insane given its all sticky and if you aren&#x27;t an expert and you end up spilling around the jar edges ... Taking it to the microwave and re heating every 5 minutes means a hell lot of cleaning... I would rather recommend getting a heating instrument like the one they use in the parlors</li>
    <li> I just got this kit because my boyfriend and I are going on vacation and I wanted to surprise him a little with a bikini wax. I didn&#x27;t wanna spend a lot so I decided to try to have a friend help me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is a mess. I tried using the baby powder technique and I still had problems. The wax was too sticky on my skin and the strips would only get about half of it off so I would have to put another strip on and it was too much for my skin. I am one giant bruise! All of the skin it pulled is purple and red and I bled some. I&#x27;d rather pay someone at a salon to do it.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money and buy this product. It is absolutely horrible! The wax doesn&#x27;t work to remove hair it simply sticks to your skin. It is horrible to try and get it off. I had to try multiple times in one area to try and remove the wax and it only pulled out like 2 hairs! I sure wish I would have read reviews on this product before I wasted my money and bought it. It is going right in the trash!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few years now, it takes awhile to get used to it, especially if you are doing your own bikini/brazillian wax. Trust me it is way cheaper than spending $30-$50 a pop to have someone else do your wax. I see many women on here getting discouraged by the messiness of this product, yes- it is messy at first, but like I said practice makes perfect. I will often wax once a week (two at the most) for upkeep, but like I said if you want to keep paying someone else to do what you can do yourself ... go right ahead! Another FYI - you will run out of wax cloth strips you can purchase more here on Amazon. Happy Waxing!</li>
    <li> This product was horrible.  It was so sticky and tacky.  Wouldn&#x27;t come off my skin.  Don&#x27;t waste the money on it, just spend a little more and have a professional do it at a salon &amp; spa.</li>
    <li> This wax is sticky and gooey at room temperature.  I actually never was able to use it because the jar tipped a little and leaked wax all over my cabinet.  It is almost impossible to remove, there is gooey wax everywhere.  I can only imagine what a mess it would cause on your body.  Oh, I don&#x27;t quite have to imagine - my fingers are getting wax all over the keyboard as I type.  Can&#x27;t get it off.  Do not buy this!  The Sally Hansen Extra Strength Bikini Wax was great but it seems to have been discontinued.  Go figure.</li>
    <li> Bought this product wax heated fine for me . Followed all the directions . Only tried to wax one of my legs and bikini area. It removed verry little hair the pain I expected, but what I didn&#x27;t expect was to be left with the most painful bumps and lumps all over. Its horrible the pain of them worse than the waxing itself ... the wax was left everywhere stuck to everything and the oil only helped so much. So now I&#x27;m left to figure out how to treat my legs . Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> Years ago I was a cosmetologist so maybe I expect too much from a product.&lt;br /&gt;That said, I found using this product a gummy mess.  It never hardens which makes removal of coarses pair more troublesome.&lt;br /&gt;In addition any residual wax on the skin is a real chore to get rid of. I tried two area and trashed it.</li>
    <li> My go-to wax for years that they aren&#x27;t selling in stores anymore :( But be careful not to go over the same area twice (unless you&#x27;re made if rhino hide, like me), and you might have bruising for a couple days in sensitive ares that have thin skin (bikini area). I use this stuff everywhere (even eyebrows, although you&#x27;re not supposed to) and I love it. I wish my hair would stay gone longer, but I think it&#x27;s my hair type and love of biotin supplements that cause that.</li>
    <li> THE BEST AT HOME WAX!!  I love this wax!  I love the warm water idea of another reviewer, but I always heat the wax to consistency that spreads very thin.  I have a high powered microwave but I almost always heat it for almost a minute (careful to test wax temperature before use).  Then I spread the wax on very thin.  The complaints about the wax not coming off are more than likely from big gobby messes.  A thin layer will not produce this issue.  Another thing, if you are afraid to rip the strip off fast enough it can leave behind residue and hurt!!  Do small sections if you find it painful (Ill cut the strip down into thirds for bikini area).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike the Nair Sugar wax, this wax is not &amp;#34;stringy&amp;#34;  While the Nair sugar wax worked well, I felt sooo sticky afterwards because it was everywhere.  The wax would stretch from the jar to application sight, impossible to get a clean application.  And even when the strip was removed, with the sticky residue, I had couch fibers stuck all over my legs from sitting.  You must take a shower after that stuff.  With This Extra Strength Sally Hansen, I just rub the oil on after and good to go, no more re-showering (because its good to shower prior to waxing to remove oils and lotions).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike the Sally Hansen Lavender (regular strength wax), The extra strength wax stick to the strip - every time!  The regular strength wax didn&#x27;t adhere to the strip on several frustrating occasions.  Plus, I also found the regular strength to be &amp;#34;stringy&amp;#34; like the Nair brand, I had wax &amp;#34;strings&amp;#34; all over the counter and chair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion - this wax sticks where its supposed to and no where else!  It sticks to the strips every time and comes off the skin clean without leaving a sticky residue.  This stuff doesn&#x27;t leave a stringy mess from the jar to application sight.  Just wipe off extra from the popsicle stick on the side of the jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE LOVE LOVE this wax.  Will NEVER buy another brand.  I was appalled to see such bad reviews.  Honestly, don&#x27;t leave a bad review if this is your first time waxing.  It takes practice.  My first at home wax was horrible, but that had nothing to do with the quality of the product.</li>
    <li> There is a disclaimer in this post that is of a rather &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; nature. I hope you think it is as helpful and funny as I now do. It will help you make a decision, I think. Okay, so, this wax is definitely heavy duty. It definitely gets ALL of the hair, with almost nothing left (unless there&#x27;s breakage or shorter pieces). I actually am really really happy with the results! The product itself is hard to heat, the first few times I was heating it up it wouldn&#x27;t soften much at all. Once I got it to the right consistency (slightly runny but not watery) I could wax away for awhile before it was too hard to continue. I think a wax heater or keeping it in warm/hot water would help significantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s my big DISCLAIMER! One of the times I was waxing, by myself, I got a little too close to the sensitive areas and when I held my skin taut to rip off the strip, I didn&#x27;t hold close enough to the skin I was waxing and I tore my very special places quite badly. I&#x27;m pretty sure it might have required a stitch, but who&#x27;s to say when I was alone and most likely blowing it out of proportion due to how traumatic the moment was. As you can imagine, this is the worst waxing nightmare! I was absolutely freaking out, texting what were probably the most horrified and hilarious texts of my life to my sister. Everything really was fine after a day or two, since this area does heal quickly. I do still have a very thin 2 inch scar. Barely noticeable. Also, I do not have kids, so ladies, I&#x27;m sure it was NOTHING compared to that if you have braved that miracle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that to say, I DO STILL USE THIS product. Call me absolutely crazy. It gets all the hair! ALL OF IT! I am just EXTREMELY careful when I get to the lower areas. Please use caution. If it isn&#x27;t warm enough you can rip your skin. If it is too close to the special areas you will want to be sure you are holding the skin tight right next to where you are waxing so as to not run into this mistake. This may be the case with all wax but I&#x27;ve tried a lot and never run into this problem. And I also have never been able to get all of the hair in one swoop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure this was horrifying and hopefully a little funny to anyone reading. I would never normally blurt out this crazy injury to a bunch of strangers, but you all are looking for the right wax and this could be it! And if it is THE WAX for you, you just seriously need to know this information before you find out the hard way. I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of different waxes and used to use ones that would never have done this, but also would never have gotten all of the hair. So, choose your battles. Happy waxing!</li>
    <li> I love these kits. I have been using them for years.</li>
    <li> I had bought this wax about a week ago. I was super excited that i could have a do it yourself waxing. Until i put some wax on my bikini area and the wax wouldnt even barely stick to the paper -_- i managed to pull some hair off but thats about it. Oh it also got all over my hands and wouldnt come off even when i took a shower. I thought i was going to have a nice bikini area but now it looks even worse. For the first few hours i was walking around like a penguin because it was sore. The next day i woke up and it was bright red and sore around my bikini area still. Save your time and money! Not worth ot! Go to a pro!</li>
    <li> This is personally my favorite wax. The price is reasonable &amp; it works well. Shipping was good too but I recently just started buying it from the CVS near my house. Walmart also carries it too. Also, make sure you follow the instructions carefully. This will make the process a bit easier. And keep the wax heated up in the microwave as frequently as you need to. It&#x27;s annoying to have to run from the bathroom to the kitchen (unless you own a wax warmer, which I do not, but I may invest in one)</li>
    <li> As already echoed here, this wax is HORRIBLE. It&#x27;s too messy and too sticky. Nothing removes it from your face...or your counter-tops. Not even the strips it comes with it! For $10, to say I&#x27;m HIGHLY disappointed is an understatement! This process should be a little bit easier and more straight forward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon requires you give a rating of at least one star in order to post. I actually give this NO STARS!!!</li>
    <li> I have thick, coarse hair and this wax removes it nicely from my legs. It is not a water soluble wax! You must use an oil (I use coconut oil) to remove any excess wax when you are finished. I used to use the white chocolate wax from Sally Hansen before it was discontinued, and that one WAS water soluble. THIS ONE IS NOT. Coconut oil (or any oil..olive, baby, etc) will remove it. The only downside is that it does not come with enough strips. I have since found some on Amazon (100 for $4.95/free shipping) to have a stash of. They are better quality strips too. I wish I could get just the container of wax though, instead of buying a whole kit every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend this if you read the instructions! Waxing takes practice!</li>
    <li> Works great!!Perfect for summer.</li>
    <li> Maybe because I have coarse hair.... But this product is amazing! Ive been using it for five years. I moved to the UK for two years and bought enough to see me through since they didn&#x27;t sell it there. The other Sally Hansen waxes don&#x27;t do it for me because they&#x27;re too weak in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes it can get messy.... But the mess is worth it because it gets EVERYTHING the first time. I even use it for my eyebrows. (I use a toothpick to apply and cut the strips to size). For the people who say it doesn&#x27;t take the hair off, you&#x27;re not giving it enough time to set. It has to get tacky before you pull the strip off. If you heat it for too long and it&#x27;s soupy, let it set for a couple minutes before putting it on. This will keep it from running all over the place and subsequently not attaching to the strips. It has to kinda look like melted taffy when you mix it. Not too thick but not too thin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have coarse hair and/or thick hair, this product is for you. It&#x27;s better to be a little more experienced because as I said, it does get messy if the wax is too hot. But it&#x27;s definitely good!</li>
    <li> I literally came onto Amazon just to see if other people had the same issue with this product that I had.  I&#x27;m glad to find out that I&#x27;m not the only one (far from it) who thinks this product is just awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been going to salons for years to get my bikini line waxed, but I figured that I&#x27;d try it at home and save myself time and money.  I purchased this product because Sally Hansen is a trusted, known brand.  Big mistake!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the wax never hardens.  NEVER!  Not even in the bottle.  Which means that while heating it up, and afterwards, when you touch it with the tip of your finger to test the temperature, it will stick to you and anything you touch.  I think this product might be better used to repair the Space Station, since I have never encountered anything so sticky and hard to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you go to apply the wax to your skin, and then run the strip over it, the wax never hardens, it just stays at the same sticky, gooey consistency.  When you go to pull the strip off, it maybe takes off some of the wax and, if you&#x27;re lucky, a few hairs, but most of the wax and most of the hair stays on your skin.  It&#x27;s basically like stepping on a piece of bubble gum - that exact same effect.  And the wax is really, really difficult to remove.  Plan on going over the same areas 4-5 times to get most of the wax off, and plan on having tweezers nearby to remove the hair that will be left behind.  Going over the same area multiple times with the strips left my skin red and bruised.  Thankfully, I was only doing this for maintenance, because I could not wear a bathing suit anytime soon due to the bruising.  The wax that I wasn&#x27;t able to get off made my skin stick together and made my clothes stick to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you choose to ignore all of the negative reviews here, do yourself a favor and wax yourself over a towel that you can throw out when you are finished, because the wax will stick to anything it touches.  I accidentally got some on my bathroom floor and I don&#x27;t know how to get it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would really love to know what these people who wrote the positive reviews are doing.  Waxing is not rocket science.  I&#x27;ve been waxed many, many times in a salon and have waxed myself at home before, but with a different product.  Of course some pain and redness and perhaps a little bit of remaining wax is to be expected (but wax is supposed to harden so you can just pick it off).  I let the wax cool until it was warm, not hot.  I let it set for a LONG time.  This product is defective and you should avoid it unless you want a mess and a headache.</li>
    <li> so I tried using this wax the first time and was confused did an ok job i bled a little and my armpits were soooo sore the next day..im used to waxing everywhere i have a high pain tolerence..&lt;br /&gt;after three diffrent times of testing i finally have it down to a science..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*take a shower use a scrub i use st ives apricot scrub on my armpits daily&lt;br /&gt;*warm your wax not to hot or you can burn yourself&lt;br /&gt;*dry your armpits really well&lt;br /&gt;*then add a thin layer of baby powder to your armpits&lt;br /&gt;*dip your wooden stick in the wax and use a small amount to spread thin on your armpit&lt;br /&gt;(using to much will not remove your hair correctly)&lt;br /&gt;*then place strip on the wax rub it really good then pull strip away opposite of hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;* i usually reapply wax for stray hairs but my friend said it irritates her skin so she plucks stray hairs out&lt;br /&gt;*then apply baby oil and it should remove the wax and wash underarms&lt;br /&gt;*your finished&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i always have had a problem with ingrown hairs but since i have been waxing no problems at all and my underarms are much lighter and smoother..&lt;br /&gt;good luck</li>
    <li> pros:&lt;br /&gt;less painful and time consuming than epilating&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons:&lt;br /&gt;wax is too sticky&lt;br /&gt;wax is hard to clean off&lt;br /&gt;annoying having to microwave it every 10 minutes&lt;br /&gt;not enough strips&lt;br /&gt;definitely not enough oil</li>
    <li> I only use this product on my bikini area.  It is perfect for it.  Only one strong enough to pull out the hairs.  It is very sticky and gooey, but if you know what you&#x27;re doing this product is great.  I don&#x27;t think one should use it for all over the body like it says cuz it is an unnecessarily strong of a product for the rest of the body.</li>
    <li> DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT!!I am used to waxing hurting while done. This product left bruises- finger tipped sizes on both forearms. I also have hicky type areas on one where it pulled my skin so badly. I recommend sugar waxing only. I barely was able to remove the strips from my second forearm because of the pain. This product should not be allowed .</li>
    <li> If you read those reviews, their difficulties are generally as a result of user error.  Not knowing how to use a wax properly is not the fault of the wax!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS NOT A HARD WAX!  IT WILL NOT HARDEN!  IF YOU TRY TO APPLY THE STRIP AFTER THE WAX COOLS, YOU WILL BE LEFT WITH A GLOB OF WAX STUCK TO YOUR SKIN!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You must apply a thin layer of wax to the skin, apply the strip right away, pull the skin tight with non-dominant hand, and then pull the strip in the opposite direction of hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you bleed, you likely did not pull the skin tight.  OR you have sensitive skin.  If you have trouble with that, rub on a dusting of baby powder to clean, dry skin.  It will prevent the wax from grabbing the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have leftover wax and run out of the azulene oil, any oil will work.  Baby oil, olive oil, vegetable oil, canola oil... you get the point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this wax for 5 years now on the tops of my feet, my legs, and my armpits without issue.  It&#x27;s a strong wax for course hair.  If you know how to use it, you will not be disappointed.</li>
