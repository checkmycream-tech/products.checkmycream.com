      <li>and they&#x27;re good for beginners and makeup snobs as well.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t used all of them yet, but they seem to pick up product and blend fairly well.</li>
      <li>Because the bristles are synthetic and so dense, the brushes aren&#x27;t too good at blending.</li>
      <li>I say buy this is you need a starter set or even if you are on the market for better brushes!</li>
      <li>AMAZING product.</li>
      <li>the packaging is nice.</li>
      <li>For this price you can&#x27;t expect real hair brushes or the best quality.</li>
      <li>The make up artist said real hair brushes were best, not synthetic.</li>
      <li>great deal, but the eyebrow groomer broke off right away.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be honest, the case isn&#x27;t super nice</li>
      <li>I love the variety of brushes in this set.</li>
      <li>Love them.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in love with them</li>
      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>Cheap!</li>
      <li>I love the feel of the brushes, I did get a couple bent brushes from the packaging</li>
      <li>These are my favorite brushes ever.  </li>
      <li>I am always in the market for more makeup brushes, so when these showed up as a lightning deal, I had to get them.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I feel confident in using these brushes on myself and others.</li>
      <li>will be pleased with this product.</li>
      <li>Well I must say that I am overly pleased with this set of brushes.</li>
      <li>I could of got better brushes at the dollar store.</li>
      <li>, super super happy softness I love them</li>
      <li>There are a very large number of brushes in good shapes and sizes.</li>
      <li>These brushes are very soft and work great.</li>
      <li>I was impressed I have order other brushes from amazon n</li>
      <li>I love how fluffy they are and they blend wonderfully.</li>
      <li>they are super soft and beautiful.</li>
      <li>and it was fine.</li>
      <li>i really enjoy them</li>
      <li>overall I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
      <li>I was surprised since I own mostly Sigma brushes.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall - I have been to so many high end stores and was about to buy a brush set of 8) for $125 until someone pointed me here.</li>
      <li>Still excited to use these</li>
      <li>The brushes are good and really soft, but as soon as I opened the brushes, one of the handles came right off.</li>
      <li>They have more sophisticated magenta colored handles which contrasts nicely against the black.</li>
      <li>That is my true review</li>
      <li>My daughter loved this set with all the different types of brushes.  </li>
      <li>But good enough for this nonprofessional make up wearing girl!</li>
      <li>However, many of the brushes are very densely packed and deposit a lot of product on either eyes or face.</li>
      <li>They are all very soft and very full brushes!</li>
      <li>it was inevitable however the tops fell off a few of them nothing some glue can&#x27;t fix, most definitely worth what you for thwm, they have a great density and don&#x27;t shed so that is nice</li>
      <li>I am ecstatic that I finally have a great full set that is of high quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Make to wash first with a sulfate free shampoo.</li>
      <li>They are very pretty brushes.</li>
      <li>I loved these brushes, they are super soft and they look very professional as I am a cosmetologist/ makeup artist.</li>
      <li>I love that they are animal haired (I use more powder product and tend to use my fingers for liquid and crème although the foundation brush in this set worked like a charm) and that they didn&#x27;t empty my bank account.</li>
      <li>This is definitely worth the price.</li>
      <li>I received them a day early also like many of you.</li>
      <li>However, the fan brushes are very nice and some of the smaller eye-shadow brushes are useful - precisely because of the short, dense bristles.</li>
      <li>i am new to the makeup field and these brushes are so easy and fun to use</li>
      <li>brushes arrived right on time.</li>
      <li>The brushes that need to be stiff are (ok, maybe the stippling brush could be stiffer) and those that require more flexibility do.</li>
      <li>so this is handy for me even if it&#x27;s not high</li>
      <li>But they do the job pretty well</li>
      <li>I love the brushes I have only used them 2</li>
      <li>The handles on these brushes aren&#x27;t the highest quality (like say, my Sigma brushes) but they will suffice -- better than the elf handles which always seem to fall off instantly!</li>
      <li>Overall, I would recommend this set for anyone, even if for nothing more than some backup brushes.</li>
      <li>but overall they are ok if you want them for traveling or lite make up applications</li>
      <li>The handles are of adequate length for each specific job and they are light.</li>
      <li>I only give a 2 star instead of 1 because the actual brushes are good...</li>
      <li>Pink is my favorite color</li>
      <li>/&gt;P.S. - Do not be fooled by the seller&#x27;s name (toys...), this is the real deal.</li>
      <li>These were not very expensive brushes so my expectations were not sky-high.</li>
      <li>I had to super glue them back on.</li>
      <li>They were not glue right to the wooden handle.</li>
      <li>The sizes of each specific brush is just right.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The brushes themselves are all very soft, synthetic brushes.</li>
      <li>Very soft.</li>
      <li>- The brushes are very soft and dense.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m still learning some things, but these brushes are 100% better than the ones I previously had (bare mineral brushes).</li>
      <li>Also, one of the ferrules slid off the wooden handle the first time I used the brush.</li>
      <li>A first I was skeptical because the popular idea is that &amp;#34;if</li>
      <li>Its soft to the touch and works well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>No problems with the makeup brush so far.  </li>
      <li>I like that they are dense as well as soft.</li>
      <li>Soft bristles and spreads my make up evenly.</li>
      <li>Maybe not up to professional quality.</li>
      <li>use it for my professional makeup class.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product was very nice for the price. I have been looking for a complete set of brushes for a very long time. This did the job great! Maybe not up to professional quality. But good enough for this nonprofessional make up wearing girl!</li>
    <li> Cheap! Broke shortly after use.</li>
    <li> For the price they are great! All the brushes you need are included!</li>
    <li> The price was great for all of the brushes you get. However the glue that they used to hold the handles on did not work very well at least 5 of them have come apart.</li>
    <li> I am always in the market for more makeup brushes, so when these showed up as a lightning deal, I had to get them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes arrived right on time. All 24 brushes come with plastic over them so they didn&#x27;t arrive all splayed out. Several have the harder plastic covers (blush brush, powder brush, fan brush, etc) which I keep on mine. The brushes come in a plastic foldable case with a flap that folds down over the brushes. I&#x27;ll be honest, the case isn&#x27;t super nice but it serves its purpose -- traveling with your brushes. I&#x27;m out of town almost every weekend so this is handy for me even if it&#x27;s not high quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes themselves are all very soft, synthetic brushes. I haven&#x27;t used all of them yet, but they seem to pick up product and blend fairly well. The handles on these brushes aren&#x27;t the highest quality (like say, my Sigma brushes) but they will suffice -- better than the elf handles which always seem to fall off instantly! Some of the brushes could be a little sturdier (stippling brush, I&#x27;m looking at you).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a solid assortment of brushes in this set (seriously, every brush you could need is in here) and they&#x27;re good for beginners and makeup snobs as well. And for the price, you can hardly beat it - 24 brushes for $25! Overall, I would recommend this set for anyone, even if for nothing more than some backup brushes.</li>
    <li> I recieved my brushes on the 17 was expected to get here until march 18th. they are super soft and beautiful. the packaging is nice. Pink is my favorite color so thats a plus! great for beginners and also pros. I cant wait to test them out on myself and clients! wonderful brushes. i recommend them</li>
    <li> It took 2 days to get my brushes, thats a plus I opened them and I was amazed  they did not shedd one single hair,  I was impressed I have order other brushes from amazon n my other brushes do have fall out, but not this brand no sir n the smell I did not notice a bad smell either a new smell yes but not that bad Smell everyone talks about  no fall out when I washed them either , super super happy softness I love them, I am very impressed  by SALON DESIGN brushes. That is my true review I hope it helps.</li>
    <li> These are my favorite brushes ever.  They look awesome and the case is really nice.  They work so well. This is definitely worth the price.</li>
    <li> These were not very expensive brushes so my expectations were not sky-high. There are a very large number of brushes in good shapes and sizes. However, many of the brushes are very densely packed and deposit a lot of product on either eyes or face. Because the bristles are synthetic and so dense, the brushes aren&#x27;t too good at blending.Also, one of the ferrules slid off the wooden handle the first time I used the brush. However, the fan brushes are very nice and some of the smaller eye-shadow brushes are useful - precisely because of the short, dense bristles.</li>
    <li> I loved these brushes, they are super soft and they look very professional as I am a cosmetologist/ makeup artist. I did have a problem with a couple of them being a little wobbly but nothing a little glue cant fix to tighten them up. overall I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> No problems with the makeup brush so far.  Its soft to the touch and works well.&lt;br /&gt;I use it for my professional makeup class.</li>
    <li> Well I must say that I am overly pleased with this set of brushes. I received them a day early also like many of you. So let&#x27;s get to it...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looks- These brushes look a little darker than the picture displayed here. I like that they do not look very-very pink. They have more sophisticated magenta colored handles which contrasts nicely against the black. All brushes come covered in plastic tubing and five of them have sturdier plastic tops (i.e. fan brush). The lip brush comes with a standard hard plastic tube cover. The case is pinker than the brush handles with small yellow stitching. It has a slight plastic feel (and smell) to it and does not look expensive...but I&#x27;m here for the brushes. There is a flap that covers all the brush bristles so that you can rest assured of their safety in storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel - The brushes are very soft and dense. After trying them out today, I see that they hold the product well and they disperse evenly on my skin. I like that they are dense as well as soft. Sparse brushes are awful. The brushes that need to be stiff are (ok, maybe the stippling brush could be stiffer) and those that require more flexibility do. The handles are of adequate length for each specific job and they are light. The sizes of each specific brush is just right. There is a wide range of sizes and specified uses for this set. I am ecstatic that I finally have a great full set that is of high quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall - I have been to so many high end stores and was about to buy a brush set of 8) for $125 until someone pointed me here. A first I was skeptical because the popular idea is that &amp;#34;if you want quality makeup brushes, you have to shell out a lot of cash for them&amp;#34;. This set has proven that theory wrong. Makeup artists, fanatics, professionals, etc. will be pleased with this product. I feel confident in using these brushes on myself and others. I love that they are animal haired (I use more powder product and tend to use my fingers for liquid and crème although the foundation brush in this set worked like a charm) and that they didn&#x27;t empty my bank account. Finally...I&#x27;m in love with them and I recommend them to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. - Do not be fooled by the seller&#x27;s name (toys...), this is the real deal.</li>
    <li> These are actually good quality brushes! I was surprised since I own mostly Sigma brushes. I love how fluffy they are and they blend wonderfully. I say buy this is you need a starter set or even if you are on the market for better brushes!</li>
    <li> It was incomplete set of this make up brushes</li>
    <li> Girlfriend loved the brushes and is very happy with them speedy delivery good price good quality had to look up what they where all for but over all happy with purchase</li>
    <li> you get what you par for they do shred a little but overall they are ok if you want them for traveling or lite make up applications</li>
    <li> great deal, but the eyebrow groomer broke off right away. but its still great quality!! and so many for the price!!</li>
    <li> Been using them for a while now and no problems out of ANY of them. They are all very soft and very full brushes! AMAZING product. One of the best deals I have ever gotten.</li>
    <li> I did a lot of looking around before I decided to buy these &amp; I couldn&#x27;t find any bad reviews on them so then I went ahead &amp; bought them &amp; was very disappointed. They are very pretty brushes. They brush itself is awesome. But when they arrived in the mail, they had plastic over each brush. While taking off the plastic, 5 of the brushes detached from the handle &amp; later, 3 detached from the handles as well about a week after use. I had to super glue them back on. I didn&#x27;t buy brushes just to fix them.. I only give a 2 star instead of 1 because the actual brushes are good... Just after you take the time to fix them...</li>
    <li> I love the variety of brushes in this set. For this price you can&#x27;t expect real hair brushes or the best quality. But they do the job pretty well and I am happy with them.</li>
    <li> The brushes are good and really soft, but as soon as I opened the brushes, one of the handles came right off. I can glue it back myself but still frustrating. Still excited to use these</li>
    <li> was surprisingly impressed with these brushes. my only complaint so far is the the way they were packaged; some of the brushes were bent like the fan brush but I let it sit over night in a book to flatten it out and it was fine.</li>
    <li> Bought these as a gift. My friend loves them! Great buy &amp; great price!</li>
    <li> I love the feel of the brushes, I did get a couple bent brushes from the packaging I th I n it was inevitable however the tops fell off a few of them nothing some glue can&#x27;t fix, most definitely worth what you for thwm, they have a great density and don&#x27;t shed so that is nice</li>
    <li> I was happy with the amount of brushes you get for the price. However, the brush heads keeping falling off the handles. I have had to glue several of them back together.</li>
    <li> The handle that connects to the metal piece holding the brushes came apart, every single brush except 1 fell apart like legos. The \\&quot;E.L.F\\&quot; makeup brushes are better then this crap.</li>
    <li> My daughter loved this set with all the different types of brushes.  Don&#x27;t know how well it will hold up yet.</li>
    <li> I bought these about 9 months ago and I&#x27;m still using them. Theyre awesome as a beginner set for your makeup collection. Very soft. My only issue is the powder brush doesnt collect enough powder so it will wipe your foundation off. The rest of the brushes are awesome and the stippling brush is better than my mac!</li>
    <li> I recently went to a make up class and decided I needed some decent brushes that wouldn&#x27;t break the bank. The make up artist said real hair brushes were best, not synthetic. These brushes are very soft and work great. I&#x27;m still learning some things, but these brushes are 100% better than the ones I previously had (bare mineral brushes). I noticed the difference as soon as I started applying the make up. Make to wash first with a sulfate free shampoo. Love them.</li>
    <li> I love the brushes I have only used them 2 and they are falling apart. They were not glue right to the wooden handle. I could of got better brushes at the dollar store.</li>
    <li> Love it i am new to the makeup field and these brushes are so easy and fun to use i really enjoy them</li>
    <li> Soft bristles and spreads my make up evenly.</li>
    <li> These brushes are too flimsy</li>
    <li> Great product.  Got them for my teenage daughter she loves them.</li>
