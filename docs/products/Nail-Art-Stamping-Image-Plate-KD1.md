      <li>I am a huge hello kitty fan and a nail polish junkie</li>
      <li>like my others cause it doesnt fit in my book.</li>

      <li>It came pretty fast which was nice!</li>
      <li>The images were crisp and easy to transfer!  </li>

      <li>HOW QUICKLY I RECEIVED MY ORDER AND HOW WELL PACKAGED.  </li>
      <li>I love this product but it was kind of sharp in the side</li>
      <li>so I had kind of paper cut or something but other than that I love the product</li>
      <li>just need to remember to clean them with acetone before the first use.</li>
      <li>Well worth it.</li>
      <li>I love the fact that I get more images than just Kitty; there&#x27;s other characters to mix and match.</li>
      <li>I think I might work into it, and I just ordered 2 more plates that have the KD numbers on them because I like how this company has such cool designs and my plate stamped well</li>
      <li>I always use konad stamper and white polish with my generic plates to ensure a great image.</li>
      <li>this designs are goods , but  i had purchased a different brand cheaper than this brand , and the depth is better than this brand ...</li>
      <li>Plates were scratched up, I could tell they had  been used,  as the scratch marks were consistent with the scraping of the excess polish.  </li>
      <li>This was my first nail art stamping plate</li>
      <li>image stamped clear and clean.</li>
      <li>They came quickly in the mail and the stamps all came out clear.</li>
      <li>This whole stamping thing has been a nightmare.</li>
      <li>I really liked the few that do come out.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Plate is very smooth, easy to scrape, I used a plastic scraper off born pretty store, and a konad double ended stamper on the small end&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>and I personally prefer the Konad special polish.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is a fun plate to use, my three girls received lots of compliments and it was fun and easy to use. They came quickly in the mail and the stamps all came out clear.</li>
    <li> Loved the images on this plate - but when I used it with polish and stamper the image isn&#x27;t stamped deep enough to pick up the image on the stamper.  Most don&#x27;t work but I was able to pick up a few of the images.  Disappointed -</li>
    <li> This was perfect. The images are so clear and come out so nice. I have done hello kitty several times and this is a great way to make my life easier. I love all of the images. So perfect and so cute!</li>
    <li> Plates were scratched up, I could tell they had  been used,  as the scratch marks were consistent with the scraping of the excess polish.  I paid for new ones. This whole stamping thing has been a nightmare.</li>
    <li> Their plates and designs are really awesome. Make sure when you are using the plates that you also purchase the Special Konad polish to use with the plates. You will get some really great results when you use their special polish. I have tried regular polish with the plates and I personally prefer the Konad special polish. Its all well worth the money!!</li>
    <li> Image is hardly ingrained on the plate. Whether using a professional scrapper or a credit card the paint is just wiped off leaving you with no image to transfer. Huge disappointment.</li>
    <li> Very good quality images and very cute  ! Hello kitty images are always so cute and easy to see on nails</li>
    <li> My only compliant is you have to be careful with the scraper, because i scraped part of the squirrel off the plate.</li>
    <li> I really liked this plate and couldnt wait to get it. I was sad that the one i really wanted to stamp didn&#x27;t work. Its not deep enough. But, most of them work okay.</li>
    <li> I have only used the Hello Kitty face and heart images so far, but both of those transferred clearly. Adorable!</li>
    <li> It works! I have every in my family Hello Kitty Out since day one of receiving it.  Shipped very quickly and nicely. Will purchase more soon.</li>
    <li> Plates are awesome. Images transferred well and looked great. I used the Konad special polishes and we had no problems at all.  Love the hello kitty designs, super cute!</li>
    <li> exactly what my daughter wanted very cute fast shipping  I do wish it was round like my others cause it doesnt fit in my book.</li>
    <li> I WAS SUPER IMPRESSED AT HOW QUICKLY I RECEIVED MY ORDER AND HOW WELL PACKAGED.  THESE IMAGES ARE SUPER CUTE. MY DAUGHTER AND I HAVE USED THEM ON ALMOST EVERY FINGERNAIL AND TOE.  SUPER ADORABLE.</li>
    <li> This Hello Kitty plate is wonderful! It is VERY popular with kids AND adults. It works wonderfully with Konad nail polish. A must buy for salons and home use!</li>
    <li> I am a huge hello kitty fan and a nail polish junkie so when I say this I was super excited. It came pretty fast which was nice! It works great. I have read some reviews were they had problem with it picking up an image but I have never had that problem. The only thing that people need to be aware of is its not a circle stamping plate.  Its an octagon.  Love it still!</li>
    <li> The shipping was good. The plate is pretty awesome! I&#x27;ve used all of the images at least once. The transfer to the nail is great, no gaps.</li>
    <li> Adorable plate, picks up and prints very well.  Very good quality.  I would recommend this plate.</li>
    <li> Things I love about this plate:&lt;br /&gt;Very clean image stamping&lt;br /&gt;Images are large, much bigger than Cheeky Summer single images Not too big for short nails though.&lt;br /&gt;Plate is very smooth, easy to scrape, I used a plastic scraper off born pretty store, and a konad double ended stamper on the small end&lt;br /&gt;I tested all images with Wet N Wild Black Creme, Wet N Wild French White, and Sinful Colors Casablanca.&lt;br /&gt;Every image stamped clear and clean. No halo, smearing, missing spots.&lt;br /&gt;Great addition to anyone&#x27;s plate collection&lt;br /&gt;Things I don&#x27;t like about this plate:&lt;br /&gt;The edges are sharp, it&#x27;s a hex not a round plate&lt;br /&gt;No backing</li>
    <li> you can get so creative with this stamp plate.  Everyone loves all my nail art designs.  If you like hello kitty the stamp is great.</li>
    <li> Another great stamp to go with my collection!  This stamp will be used A LOT, my daughter loooves Hello Kitty!  Everybody should have a Hello Kitty stamp!! :)</li>
    <li> Some of the engravings are too think and don&#x27;t transfer well. I really liked the few that do come out.</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical about buying this plate because sometimes there are knock offs and also because it is not Konad brand but the plate I received stamped great. I used Konad special polish.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product because I love hello kitty. I was expecting to recieve it this week(12-9/12-15) but recieved within days of the purchase. I was shocked. This was my first nail art stamping plate so I had to wait til I got my other pieces I ordered(stamper/scraper) when I did it took practice as with anything new. But was pleased with the results I recieved. My girls love it as well. They have neat lil designs on thier nails. Thank you very much! :)</li>
    <li> Who doesn&#x27;t love a cats affection.  Now I can show how much I care:)</li>
    <li> This plate works very good! I am very happy with it, the heart combined with hello kitty&#x27;s face looks super cute.</li>
    <li> I love this product but it was kind of sharp in the side so I had kind of paper cut or something but other than that I love the product</li>
    <li> Really cute plate ! No problems transferring the image to my nails, although some of the fine details doesn&#x27;t transfer perfectly but overall really good! :)</li>
    <li> My daughters loved these. Well worth it.</li>
    <li> This nail plate was perfect no flaws any where all of Hello kittys designs came out perfect all 3my daughters liked this item including their little girl friends that wanted their nails done the same way.I RECOMEND nail plate KD1 for all Hello kitty lovers of all ages!</li>
    <li> I have a daycare in my home and I have already used it on the girls&#x27; fingers and toes. They absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> Tried these plates using actual Konad polish as soon as I got them.  Loved them!  The images were crisp and easy to transfer!  Thank you for an adorable disc!</li>
    <li> It works just as good as my konad plates. I always use konad stamper and white polish with my generic plates to ensure a great image. sally Hansen insta dry polishes all work great too!</li>
    <li> Item was just as described arrived very quickly. Thanks so much will be doing business with you guys again for sure!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used them yet, but it&#x27;s Hello Kitty so I already love it! I will try to update my review once I try it out.</li>
    <li> the product prints clearly, arrived on time. I love the fact that I get more images than just Kitty; there&#x27;s other characters to mix and match.</li>
    <li> At first I was dissapointed because the engravings of the design were not deep enough. I then noticed that when I scraped the image a plastic covering would lift. I then noticed there was a plastic sticker on top of it to protect it. I then removed it and my THE DESIGNS came out awsome.. I love it. Just make sure you take out the plastic covering.</li>
    <li> Image show up perfect! Thank you</li>
    <li> this designs are goods , but  i had purchased a different brand cheaper than this brand , and the depth is better than this brand ... but is ok .</li>
    <li> Purchased these since my daughter loves Hello Kitty. Stamps are work great and good size. just need to remember to clean them with acetone before the first use.</li>
    <li> I just got mine in the mail today great timing there&#x27;s a huge snow storm and nothing to do because driving with 4 wheel drive even is hard, so I immediately had to try it out! I used to have another Hello Kitty plate and that one was really good but I lost it and its not that I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again, but now there are new options to pick from so I wanted to try something new, I got this one because it has pretty much the same kitty on my old plate and then a few other designs and the total cost was about the same but the fact that there are more Hello Kitty images makes it a better value in my opinion. Plus there are lots of other neat plates through this company I saw browsing so I wanted to experience one so I knew if it was worth buying other plates- I think it is. I spent my day playing with it on my current manicure to get ideas and see how it worked (it works as expected I used Konad special polish and there stamper/scraper) and after playing with it I made a polish change and I plan on stamping it into a holiday design tonight with my bundle monster plates I have some cute light bulbs and candy designs I think I might work into it, and I just ordered 2 more plates that have the KD numbers on them because I like how this company has such cool designs and my plate stamped well so I trust the others will be just as good, I also don&#x27;t mind the plate not being round all my others are round so if I have a few that aren&#x27;t it&#x27;s easier to pick them out the way I organize them.</li>
    <li> I bought this so I could do my nieces&#x27; nails. The plate came looking perfect and the image transferred over great. The only problem I have is that it&#x27;s extremely sharp. It&#x27;s not a round plate, it&#x27;s more octagon with sharp corners and no paper backing. This is not great for a Hello Kitty design that the girls&#x27; wanted to pick up and look at constantly. I had to watch them while they were studying the designs to make sure they didn&#x27;t get cut.</li>
