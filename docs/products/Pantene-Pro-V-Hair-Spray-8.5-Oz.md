      <li>and I knew they would want me to look nice.  </li>
      <li>I love the smell of it too veryy good.</li>
      <li>so very glad it&#x27;s available here.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t ask for a better hairspray.  </li>
      <li>Love the scent and love how it holds my hair into place.</li>
      <li>I love this hairspray,it holds my style, will order again.</li>
      <li>I also like the fact that it is not an aerosol can, as those seem to clog so easily.  </li>
      <li>I love this hairspray it works perfectly, keeps my hair in place without feeling too stiff</li>
      <li>The day after I received this I had a huge day.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just comfortable for me</li>
      <li>What more could i say thank you very much.</li>
      <li>nothing special, except the cheap price</li>
      <li>Nothing special about this hairspray.</li>
      <li>My girls love it!So much in fact they each took a bottle.</li>
      <li>I love this hairspray it holds very well without making your hair sticky.</li>
      <li>Smells good, keeps my hair in place and does not turn white to the touch.</li>
      <li>I love this hairspray &amp; as always happens, I find the one I love &amp; the next time I go to buy it, I can&#x27;t find it anymore.  </li>
      <li>This is a very stressful situation for me because I have naturally straight hair that doesn&#x27;t even like perms, so how could I do my hair that would look nice.  </li>
      <li>Instead I decided to scrunch my hair and go more naturally.  </li>
      <li>I really like Pantene and love the extra strong hold.  </li>
      <li>Next time I will try an aerosol for more even distribution.</li>
      <li>As soon as it arrived I knew exactly what I was doing to my hair.  </li>
      <li>I really like the hold of this hairspray.  </li>
      <li>This product gives the &amp;#34;extra strong&amp;#34; hold stated; the drawback is that it can get crunchy if you use too much.</li>
      <li>I really like this hair spray.</li>
      <li>This really is a miracle hairspray for me.  </li>
      <li>I use it more as a styling tool and it holds much better for me than any other hair spray and without the glu-like cohesion that other sprays can create.</li>
      <li>Pantene is my absolute favorite brand of hairspray because it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling sticky the next day and keeps my style all day long.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product to everyone.  </li>
      <li>Love the scent and firm yet flexible hold.  </li>
      <li>After the event (5 hours later), I came home and took a nap, got up and went to a birthday party which was also held outside and this product was still holding strong.</li>
      <li>Pleasant smell but a little sticky due to the pump spray.</li>
      <li>Left my hair feeling soft and fresh smelling.</li>
      <li>I generally use it to set my hair and also keep my bangs in place.</li>
      <li>Much to my surprise, I got out of bed, fixed a few pieces that were tangled and walked out the door.  </li>
      <li>Minus one star for the strong perfumey fragrance, which I probably wouldn&#x27;t find so unpleasant if it weren&#x27;t so strong and lingering.</li>

    <li> I really like Pantene and love the extra strong hold.  Holds my hairstyle without making it still and sticky.</li>
    <li> YIKES! It was like spraying my hair with water! I was shocked! I had just finished styling my hair and chose to try this hair spray for the first time and my hair went completely limp as though I were wetting it down with water. I have never had such a bad experience with hair spray before. I can&#x27;t recommend this hairspray at all.</li>
    <li> My go to hair product.  Keeps my hair tamed all day.</li>
    <li> Great Price Great Product Great Service !!! What more could i say thank you very much.</li>
    <li> Best hair spray on the market - period. Holds my hair for hours. At this price, nothing could be better!</li>
    <li> I got this product on a discount and because of this I am leaving a review.  The day after I received this I had a huge day.  My preschool class was graduating from preschool and I knew it would be a bittersweet day.  I knew I had to look nice considering people would want pictures of their kids with their teacher and I knew they would want me to look nice.  These pictures would be kept forever.  I kept questioning which product I would use, how I would do my hair, etc.  This is a very stressful situation for me because I have naturally straight hair that doesn&#x27;t even like perms, so how could I do my hair that would look nice.  Everyday when I go to work or out somewhere, my hair is up in a ponytail.  It&#x27;s just comfortable for me and it&#x27;s my style.  This hairspray arrived in the mail just in time to save the day.  As soon as it arrived I knew exactly what I was doing to my hair.  I had planned on attempting to curl my hair, but that didn&#x27;t pan out.  Instead I decided to scrunch my hair and go more naturally.  I sprayed this product in my hair the night before to scrunch it and prayed that it would hold through sleep, it did!  Much to my surprise, I got out of bed, fixed a few pieces that were tangled and walked out the door.  Our event was outside in the North Carolina heat and humidity, and this product held all day long.  After the event (5 hours later), I came home and took a nap, got up and went to a birthday party which was also held outside and this product was still holding strong. I couldn&#x27;t ask for a better hairspray.  It doesn&#x27;t make your hair stiff or hard looking.  It holds like it says it does.  I will be buying this product on a regular basis from now on.  Since receiving it I have also curled my hair and sprayed this product on my hair and the curls were still perfect in the morning and lasted all day of work at a preschool.  This really is a miracle hairspray for me.  My hair has never held a curl, not even a perm.  I highly recommend this product to everyone.  Happy hair everyone!everyone.  Happy hair everyone!</li>
    <li> works great and smell&#x27;s good</li>
    <li> I really like the hold of this hairspray.  Keeps my hair in place without being sticky or crunch.  I also like the fact that it is not an aerosol can, as those seem to clog so easily.  There is a slight scent when you spray it, but I do not notice it after the spray dries. I will be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> Love the scent and firm yet flexible hold.  Pantene is my absolute favorite brand of hairspray because it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling sticky the next day and keeps my style all day long.</li>
    <li> Beside what it says on label, it makes my hair look younger by changing from white to black. Holding, being touchable, just perfect.</li>
    <li> Love this! Pantene rules!</li>
    <li> nothing special, except the cheap price</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. Held my style in place without stiffness or stickiness. Left my hair feeling soft and fresh smelling.</li>
    <li> I love this hairspray it holds very well without making your hair sticky. I love the smell of it too veryy good.</li>
    <li> Just a little bit and you are good to go. Love the scent and love how it holds my hair into place.</li>
    <li> Performs as advertised.</li>
    <li> Very good. packaged perfectl</li>
    <li> I love this hairspray,it holds my style, will order again.</li>
    <li> I got this at a discounted price to reach the 5 &amp;#34;subscribe and save&amp;#34; threshold and my wife says she loves it.  All I needed to hear to give a rating.</li>
    <li> I love this hairspray it works perfectly, keeps my hair in place without feeling too stiff</li>
    <li> My girls love it!So much in fact they each took a bottle. I purchased 2. And never got to use it myself.  Teenagers!  Thank you. Its a great product</li>
    <li> I love this hairspray &amp; as always happens, I find the one I love &amp; the next time I go to buy it, I can&#x27;t find it anymore.  But thankfully I have recently found it at CVS.  It holds well &amp; doesn&#x27;t make me smell like a hair salon!</li>
    <li> My favorite hairspray!  Great hold.</li>
    <li> Pleasant smell but a little sticky due to the pump spray. I generally use it to set my hair and also keep my bangs in place. After about 4 hours I can still feel the crunchy hair parts where I had sprayed it. Next time I will try an aerosol for more even distribution.</li>
    <li> Great hairspray , nice scent excellent hold</li>
    <li> This product gives the &amp;#34;extra strong&amp;#34; hold stated; the drawback is that it can get crunchy if you use too much. But, it works, and it&#x27;s fairly inexpensive. Minus one star for the strong perfumey fragrance, which I probably wouldn&#x27;t find so unpleasant if it weren&#x27;t so strong and lingering.</li>
    <li> Love it! Smells good, keeps my hair in place and does not turn white to the touch.</li>
