      <li>Very good</li>
      <li>I bought this on a whim because the Triple Nutrition tag line sounded great.</li>

      <li>I took a chance on line and was thrilled to find it!  </li>
      <li>It feels GOOD.</li>
      <li>This smells good as well.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Third, the nutrients must be helping; I can&#x27;t know for sure, but my hair looks healthy and flowing and GREAT!</li>
      <li>I loved the way it smells, love the way you shake it to blend the oils...and best of all, it leaves a beautiful, healthy shine, that has more to do with healthy hair than cosmetics.</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>I first purchased this wonderful product in the sale section at Target over the summer when my double-processed hair was feeling and showing the effects of sea and sun.</li>
      <li>I love this product!  </li>
      <li>Love the smell!</li>
      <li>Amazingly my fine, highlighted hair looked amazing after using this product.</li>
      <li>I LOVE the olive, avocado, and shea oil formula</li>
      <li>Much better than &#x27;</li>
      <li>This is a wonderful product for your hair, especially if it is color treated!  </li>
      <li>I just spray the lightest spritz around my hair and it works its magic.  </li>
      <li>Feels like it could have been a lot more money for what it delivers, too.</li>
      <li>The liquid feels healthy.</li>
      <li>Thanks for the great product</li>

      <li>It would be a shame to see such a great product be discontinued.</li>
      <li>Oh, I feel fortunate to have found it.</li>
      <li>Works great to dampen your hair and blow dry out for a touch up,  instead of water.</li>
      <li>so I already told all my girls to buy it based on the amazing results i&#x27;ve seen thus far.</li>
      <li>Nice, soft and shiny.</li>
      <li>Leaves the hear nice and soft.</li>
      <li>Each time I wash my hair, it actually looks and feel better than before!</li>
      <li>I just hope to see more positive reviews very soon.</li>
      <li>My hair looks very shiny and it gives glossy finish to my fine hair...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many expensive shine sprays because I always assumed if I bought them in a salon that they would naturally be great products.</li>
      <li>I spritz a bit on my damp hair before styling &amp; my hair is soft, bouncy, smooth &amp; shiny.</li>
      <li>Since then, the photo has been changed to reflect what I received (yellow top), but the ingredient list has not been updated.</li>
      <li>After I started using this spray it now looks very healthy and does not weigh it down at all!</li>
      <li>Conditioning my hair often has given me great results so far, so black women: dont sleep on this product!!     </li>
      <li>It really works as described..</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product as well as the rest of the triple nutrition line!</li>
      <li>I really like this product for my hair.</li>
      <li>I have long, fine hair but a LOT of it</li>
      <li>Not dull!  </li>
      <li>the description, this shines your hair and makes it oily and vibrant.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for a leave-in conditioner and this is actually the first time I felt compelled to write a positive review about any product.</li>
      <li>Well, this was one of those rare times a product actually comes through.</li>
      <li>The product pictured and described (green top) is NOT WHAT I RECEIVED.</li>
      <li>Unfortunately, have not been able to find this easily</li>
      <li>I was thrilled to find it online because I can&#x27;t tolerate the smell of the almond oil they have replaced the shea with (previously purchased in a local store).</li>
      <li>When you have a guy friend who isn&#x27;t gay stop you in front of everyone and tell you, &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing differently to your hair, but don&#x27;t stop doing it, because it looks amazing,&amp;#34; and this is the only thing you&#x27;ve changed, you find a way to keep using it!</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t live without this.</li>
      <li>I put it on my dry hair at night &amp; by morning it is absorbed &amp; my hair is soft &amp; shiny.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair, once thick, now much thinner.</li>
      <li>I wear a naturally curly style and Garnier Fructose keeps my hair moisturized and shiny.</li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t until I actually tried it out on my hair that I realized what it really does.&lt;br</li>
      <li>My hair is very unique in that most products that seem to solve problems for other black women&#x27;s hair does absolutely NOTHING for my hair and sometimes makes things worse</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t expect to love it--because I had tried so many other shine products...only to be disappointed with an oil slick that flattened my hair and then left it more damaged than before.  </li>
      <li>I have just purchased and recieved this spray and so far it has already left my hair moisturized and shiny!!</li>
      <li>Greasy, heavy, badly absorbed.</li>
      <li>Typically my hair is very stressed from frequent coloring and straightening.</li>

    <li> Triple nutrition spray dual shine by Gardiner Fructis.  Works great to dampen your hair and blow dry out for a touch up,  instead of water. Spray on brush and blow dry.  Nice, soft and shiny. Not dull!  ONE HAS SHEA IN IT, ONE HAS ALMOND IN IT.  PLUS OLIVE AND AVACADO.</li>
    <li> I first purchased this wonderful product in the sale section at Target over the summer when my double-processed hair was feeling and showing the effects of sea and sun. I didn&#x27;t expect to love it--because I had tried so many other shine products...only to be disappointed with an oil slick that flattened my hair and then left it more damaged than before.  Well, this was one of those rare times a product actually comes through. I loved the way it smells, love the way you shake it to blend the oils...and best of all, it leaves a beautiful, healthy shine, that has more to do with healthy hair than cosmetics. It feels GOOD. Feels like it could have been a lot more money for what it delivers, too. Oh, I feel fortunate to have found it. It was just what my hair needed. When I&#x27;m done styling...I just spray the lightest spritz around my hair and it works its magic.  Unfortunately, have not been able to find this easily and I&#x27;m afraid it will be discontinued...so I&#x27;ve been searching it out online.</li>
    <li> Everything you may have doubts about regarding leave in conditioners can be disguarded.  Having tried a few other products before this...one of which made my hair into a workers helmet.  Anyway, the buoyancy that this product leaves your hair in is the equivalent to a commercial.  Just hope this product endures the market.</li>
    <li> I am so upset that Garnier discontinued this product in October 2014. I have been looking for this product for months and months on end without luck. I finally emailed them and was told that because of the lack of sales they stopped producing it. Too bad. The other oil sprays they sell are way too oily. Can&#x27;t use those at all. The Triple Nutrition spray was the perfect balance of oil and other ingredients. BRING THIS PRODUCT BACK!!!</li>
    <li> The product pictured and described (green top) is NOT WHAT I RECEIVED. Since then, the photo has been changed to reflect what I received (yellow top), but the ingredient list has not been updated. I LOVE the olive, avocado, and shea oil formula and I can &#x27;t find it in stores anymore. I was thrilled to find it online because I can&#x27;t tolerate the smell of the almond oil they have replaced the shea with (previously purchased in a local store). I will be returning this! It may work for people who are not bothered by the smell, but I am quite disappointed that inaccurate information and photos were posted by the seller.</li>
    <li> I am African American with dense, coarse, and overly dry hair. I&#x27;ve been searching for a leave-in conditioner and this is actually the first time I felt compelled to write a positive review about any product. My hair is very unique in that most products that seem to solve problems for other black women&#x27;s hair does absolutely NOTHING for my hair and sometimes makes things worse (ie protein treatments and other natural anti-breakage treatments). This product had me in awe from how soft and shiny it left my AIR DRIED hair. Usually, my air dried hair feels like a brillo pad!     Let me put it in perspective as to how wonderful this spray is:    I&#x27;ve had this spray for 11 days. Since it&#x27;s summer now, I&#x27;ve gone running outdoors and swam in a chlorine pool 3 times each in these 11 days. i washed my hair with [[ASIN:B0038TVHGG Shea Moisture Raw Shea Butter Moisture Retention Shampoo - 12 oz.]] 3 times this week and used this as my ONLY leave in conditioner. Each time I wash my hair, it actually looks and feel better than before! I&#x27;ve also used this spray sparingly before I use a creamy moisturizer every night and i must say that my hair is finally at the health that i&#x27;ve always dreamed of!     I always thought that leaving my hair alone would make my hair flourish, but once again the solution for other black women is the opposite for me. Conditioning my hair often has given me great results so far, so black women: dont sleep on this product!!     It&#x27;s so lightweight but packs wonderful nourishing and shining properties. It also is a great heat protectant from blow drying so I already told all my girls to buy it based on the amazing results i&#x27;ve seen thus far. I just hope to see more positive reviews very soon. It would be a shame to see such a great product be discontinued.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many expensive shine sprays because I always assumed if I bought them in a salon that they would naturally be great products. I saw this product on a shopping trip at my grocery store and decided to give it a go. Amazingly my fine, highlighted hair looked amazing after using this product. Typically my hair is very stressed from frequent coloring and straightening. After I started using this spray it now looks very healthy and does not weigh it down at all! I actually use it prior to straightening and then add a little as a finishing touch. No product compares to the sheen this stuff gives it! Love it!!</li>
    <li> I have long, fine hair but a LOT of it so I use this product when straightening my hair.  I start w/ a heat protector spray and then use this on the fly-away areas.  Just spray a section of hair with this and then run your straightener back over it and, voila!  Fly-aways are tamed!  Also seems to add a little &amp;#34;weight&amp;#34; which helps give the appearance of thicker hair.  Can&#x27;t live without this.</li>
    <li> I use this product as a leave-in conditioner on towel-dried hair. Detangles my hair like a dream! Smells awesome! You don&#x27;t need much to get nice results. Gets your hair shiny, especially if you use it on dry hair. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> It really works as described..My hair looks very shiny and it gives glossy finish to my fine hair...Thanks for the great product</li>
    <li> I bought this on a whim because the Triple Nutrition tag line sounded great. It wasn&#x27;t until I actually tried it out on my hair that I realized what it really does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, it smells great.  A definite plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, you spray it all over your hair when your done styling and it gives it an INSTANT shine.  I&#x27;m usually a skeptic about these shine sprays and serums, but this one actually gave me a very luxurious and glossy finish, without making my roots look oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, the nutrients must be helping; I can&#x27;t know for sure, but my hair looks healthy and flowing and GREAT!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product for your hair, especially if it is color treated!  I couln&#x27;t find it in store anymore and was heart broken. I took a chance on line and was thrilled to find it!  it does not weigh your hair down or make it greasy, it softens it, as well as getting rid of brittleness.  I use it every morning before I put a brush to my hair, it is just terrific!  I also use it to detangle my hair after shampooing.  It makes your hair shine and look great.  I have bleached hair that used to be like straw, now you couldn&#x27;t tell.  I love this product!  Leona</li>
    <li> I used to have frizzy hair and nothing seemed to tame it.  But I finally found a product that will without weighing my hair down.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I have fine hair, once thick, now much thinner. Gave up trying for faux volume &amp; decided to just take care of it. Tried this on a whim &amp; was blown away. I put it on my dry hair at night &amp; by morning it is absorbed &amp; my hair is soft &amp; shiny. I spritz a bit on my damp hair before styling &amp; my hair is soft, bouncy, smooth &amp; shiny. I can&#x27;t believe how well it works. Much better than &#x27;It&#x27;s A 10!&#x27;  Plus much cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tried the Garnier Fructis Miracle Dry oil &amp; it was awful. Greasy, heavy, badly absorbed. Sticking with this!</li>
    <li> When you have a guy friend who isn&#x27;t gay stop you in front of everyone and tell you, &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing differently to your hair, but don&#x27;t stop doing it, because it looks amazing,&amp;#34; and this is the only thing you&#x27;ve changed, you find a way to keep using it!</li>
    <li> This product is considered one of the best rated hair nutrition product. So, I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;As the description, this shines your hair and makes it oily and vibrant. I like the fact that this product is organic and has no toxic unknown chemicals in it. The liquid feels healthy. This smells good as well. This isn&#x27;t too expensive, so it&#x27;s worth trying out and you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> I have just purchased and recieved this spray and so far it has already left my hair moisturized and shiny!! As a woman who has naturally curly hair, i have always battled with my hair&#x27;s moisture level but with garnier fructis they never seem to fail me! I highly recommend this product as well as the rest of the triple nutrition line!</li>
    <li> Leaves the hear nice and soft. Not greasy or heavy on the hair. Love the smell! Very good</li>
    <li> I really like this product for my hair. I wear a naturally curly style and Garnier Fructose keeps my hair moisturized and shiny. I would recommend this product to those who don&#x27;t have chemicals in their hair and would like to keep their hair moisturized.</li>
