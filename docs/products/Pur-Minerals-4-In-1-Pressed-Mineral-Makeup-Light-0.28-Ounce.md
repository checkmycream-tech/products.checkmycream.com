      <li>Good coverage,</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good to my skin.</li>
      <li>You can get thicker coverage using a makeup sponge, which I still use, but now I don&#x27;t have a good place to store it, plus I&#x27;m always having to wipe of the mirror.</li>
      <li>This had good reviews</li>

      <li>Lite with good coverage.</li>

      <li>I found Pur through the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s website, then I found this good deal on</li>

      <li>I have been using this for years, love it!</li>
      <li>Easy to put on with great coverage.  </li>
      <li>This our minerals is so amazing I won&#x27;t ever go to anything else</li>
      <li>before it was more matte which is what I loved about it.</li>
      <li>Maybe that&#x27;s the reason for so many good reviews?</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t too thrilled with this.</li>
      <li>but I just could not find a good match in their product for my insanely light skin.  </li>
      <li>Love it because even with acne-prone skin it doesn&#x27;t clog pores</li>
      <li>What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
      <li>You can never be 100% sure of cause</li>
      <li>Each individual has specific makeup lines that work best with their skin --- this one works best with mine.</li>
      <li>Much as I love Ulta, this Pur Minerals powder is often 2-3 dollars cheaper here and is a Prime item.  </li>
      <li>This product replaces the use of liquid foundation and is better for my skin &amp; pores.  </li>
      <li>Much as I love Ulta, this Pur Minerals powder is often 2-3 dollars cheaper here and is a Prime item.  </li>
      <li>what more could a girl ask for?</li>
      <li>Absolutely love our minerals</li>
      <li>Love the pressed powder.</li>
      <li>One of my favorite makeups ....  </li>
      <li>love Pur and won&#x27;t use anything else.  </li>
      <li>This is my favorite powder.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I found Pur Minerals.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping, doesn&#x27;t break easily, your skin can breathe (lol)</li>
      <li>This makeup is so comfortable, light, quick and easy to apply, and good for my skin.</li>
      <li>Great natural match for my skin tone.</li>
      <li>I love this so much!!!</li>
      <li>Luckily, I was able to find Tarte cosmetics and love them.</li>
      <li>I want the original!!&lt;br /&gt;This &#x27;new and improved&#x27; formula is NOT as good.  </li>
      <li>If I were going out to dinner I would need to powder my nose,  it the rest of my face would be fine.</li>
      <li>It is light</li>
      <li>I use Light in the months when my face has a bit of tan in it and Porcelain the rest of the year.</li>
      <li>I really love this makeup, it&#x27;s a bit pricey but completely worth it.</li>
      <li>The coverage is awesome and it lasts a pretty long time.</li>
      <li>but it offers good coverage.</li>
      <li>When used in conjunction with their concealer, I get a great, seamless finish and don&#x27;t have to do my makeup all the way to my collarbones to look right.  </li>
      <li>covers well, lasts all day, and is quick, easy, and covers all the makeup steps in one.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it for years due to the health benefits it provides to my skin along with excellent coverage that can be light or heavier depending on how much is applied.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s important that you use the right brush...</li>
      <li>Wears off quickly.</li>
      <li>Offers more full coverage than bareminerals - is still a foundation so used without primer can wear off during the day.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply, easy to love, and has replaced every other powder I ever kept in my arsenal.  </li>
      <li>Pur Minerals is a great everyday product.  </li>
      <li>P&amp;uuml;r Minerals just looks more natural on us.</li>
      <li>This kind of makeup also requires a slightly different touch in application</li>
      <li>Stays on all day - does an excellent job covering up broken capillaries</li>
      <li>I apply it with a large make-up brush, and I&#x27;m not disappointed.</li>
      <li>I like it much more than Bare Minerals.  </li>
      <li>I love how natural it looks, and the 4 in 1 means my total makeup for application (this, blush, sometimes mascara) takes five minutes at most.</li>
      <li>Pur minerals is much better than bare minerals because the pressed powder doesn&#x27;t get all over the place.  </li>
      <li>Thinking about going back to dermablend as it is good matte coverage that doesn&#x27;t effect my sensitive break out prone skin.</li>
      <li>, recently, the company has changed the formula, and the original is no longer available...</li>
      <li>A little pricey, but it lasts for a good three months or so.</li>
      <li>This was definitely more sheer coverage even though I applied it with a sponge applicator.  </li>
      <li>I definitely prefer their &amp;#34;Powderful&amp;#34; pressed compact better.</li>
      <li>Love this make-up, have been wearing this for several years.  </li>
      <li>It is the right shade for me and goes on smooth (using the Bare Escentuals Precision face brush instead of the Pur Minerals one).</li>
      <li>My skin doesn&#x27;t break out a tenth as much as it used to, and that&#x27;s thanks to mineral</li>
      <li>It looked very geisha like, which was not the look I was going for.  </li>
      <li>I really like this product.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t wear makeup because it too much work to put in and maintain.</li>
      <li>My skin doesn&#x27;t break out a tenth as much as it used to, and that&#x27;s thanks to mineral</li>
      <li>I really do like this foundation.  </li>
      <li>Good solid compact, decent amount for the price, wish there were a little more in there as loose powder seems to go farther.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Pur Minerals 4-In-1 for several years and it&#x27;s the best concealer/ all-over cover up for anything on your face-  without magnifying wrinkles or crinkles or pores.  I&#x27;ve tried other products and sent them back.  This is the best powder I have ever found!  Truly hides imperfections while looking very natural and not pancake-y!!&lt;br /&gt;BUT, recently, the company has changed the formula, and the original is no longer available...I want the original!!&lt;br /&gt;This &#x27;new and improved&#x27; formula is NOT as good.  Turned dry and didn&#x27;t cover as well.  Not happy...I want my old and unimproved Pur Minerals back!  How can you improve on perfection?  You can&#x27;t!!  Not a good decision, Pur Minerals Company...</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years and I love it!  I like it much more than Bare Minerals.  It is less messy and more convenient than the loose product and stays on better than their compact.  I have combination skin, with an oily t-zone, and Pur minerals covers perfectly and stays put.</li>
    <li> Best I&#x27;ve used to date.  Color is very natural.</li>
    <li> Great product. Since I&#x27;ve been using it my skin has improved.</li>
    <li> The best powder I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
    <li> Best makeup I&#x27;ve every used. After I ran out I picked up some Maybelline powder, which didn&#x27;t last and promptly broke me out. This makeup is so comfortable, light, quick and easy to apply, and good for my skin. I love how natural it looks, and the 4 in 1 means my total makeup for application (this, blush, sometimes mascara) takes five minutes at most. A little pricey, but it lasts for a good three months or so. Love it!</li>
    <li> I really do like this foundation.  It is the right shade for me and goes on smooth (using the Bare Escentuals Precision face brush instead of the Pur Minerals one).</li>
    <li> One of my favorite makeups ....  covers well, lasts all day, and is quick, easy, and covers all the makeup steps in one.</li>
    <li> Whenever I can&#x27;t find this at Birchbox, I order it here for the same price. This is my favorite powder. It covers like liquid foundation but doesn&#x27;t leave your face looking cakey.</li>
    <li> This is a great medium coverage powder foundation.  Since it&#x27;s compacted, you don&#x27;t have powder flying everywhere when applying it.  This product replaces the use of liquid foundation and is better for my skin &amp; pores.  It provides a natural looking, even skin tone.  Also perfect for my teenager - evenly covers acne &amp; blackheads.  I prefer this product over Bare Minerals.  P&amp;uuml;r Minerals just looks more natural on us.</li>
    <li> Pur Minerals is a great everyday product.  It is light so it does not feel like I am wearing makeup but it offers good coverage.</li>
    <li> This is a good mineral powder foundation for those of us that do not need a lot of foundation.  It is not drying.</li>
    <li> Awesome product... Love it!</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I have used it for years.</li>
    <li> Love this make-up, have been wearing this for several years.  Liked bare minerals but using this is way less messy!  Stays on all day - does an excellent job covering up broken capillaries</li>
    <li> Minimal coverage. Wears off quickly. I was very disappointed. Neurtrogena&#x27;s Mineral Pressed Powder provides much more coverage and lasts longer for less than half the price.</li>
    <li> Pur minerals 4 in 1 performs as it claims.  I really like this product.  Have bought several times and will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> Covers flawlessly. Covers well ---- but looks so natural. Can&#x27;t tell you&#x27;re wearing any powder. It&#x27;s good to my skin. I have acne prone skin. My skin has improved with this makeup.</li>
    <li> Offers more full coverage than bareminerals - is still a foundation so used without primer can wear off during the day. Love it because even with acne-prone skin it doesn&#x27;t clog pores</li>
    <li> Back story:  ever since I was about 12 (which is a long time ago), I was a Cover Girl pressed powder chick.  Creamy Natural all the way, baby!  No other powder matched my skin tone--or lack thereof--so well, nor did any other effectively cover my myriad of skin nightmares--cystic acne, scars, melasma, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, after 30-odd years of fighting with genetically lousy skin, I took the plunge and invested in laser treatments, specifically looking to obliterate the coffee-like patches of melasma on my forehead and the sad number of scars left from deep, extremely painful acne.  The laser treatments were the catalyst for my switch to mineral makeup; I will never again use the regular stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you&#x27;re healing from laser treatments, you can&#x27;t use just any makeup--you either go without (WHAT THE WHAT?!), or you must use mineral makeup.  Unlike traditional makeup, mineral makeup is antibacterial and therefore safe to use on a face that&#x27;s just been blasted by a laser.  Mineral makeup is made from rocks and doesn&#x27;t harbor bacteria.  This kind of makeup also requires a slightly different touch in application because if done with too heavy a hand, it looks awful and can age you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to use Bare Minerals--which I also like--but I just could not find a good match in their product for my insanely light skin.  Their powders either made me look like a ghost, or the powder made me look like I fell asleep in a vat of self-tanner.  I received a tiny pot of Pur Minerals powder as a gift and decided to give it a try, since I was on the hunt for a replacement to Bare Minerals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love Pur and won&#x27;t use anything else.  The light shade matches my skin tone perfectly and is amazing at obliterating rudiness.  When used in conjunction with their concealer, I get a great, seamless finish and don&#x27;t have to do my makeup all the way to my collarbones to look right.  It&#x27;s easy to apply, easy to love, and has replaced every other powder I ever kept in my arsenal.  My skin doesn&#x27;t break out a tenth as much as it used to, and that&#x27;s thanks to mineral makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re wary about buying makeup over the internet, I get that.  Go to Ulta and look at the shades in person to decide what works for you, then come back here and buy through Amazon.  Much as I love Ulta, this Pur Minerals powder is often 2-3 dollars cheaper here and is a Prime item.  What&#x27;s not to love?arsenal.

    <li> I really love this makeup, it&#x27;s a bit pricey but completely worth it. The coverage is awesome and it lasts a pretty long time. It has your foundation, concealer and powder all in one. Doesn&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re earing make up at all!</li>
    <li> Used it before, works well.  This was just the wrong color.</li>
    <li> Love the pressed powder. I switched from a loose powder and I&#x27;m so glad I found Pur Minerals. So much easier and less messy for travel. Good coverage, but with oily tending skin or activity I do reapply. Great natural match for my skin tone. Good solid compact, decent amount for the price, wish there were a little more in there as loose powder seems to go farther. No irritation for this sensitive skin. Invest in the best brush you can find (you&#x27;re worth it) and what a difference THAT makes, as does a really good brush cleaner. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> This beauty product (and line) is one of my favorites. Each individual has specific makeup lines that work best with their skin --- this one works best with mine. I used Bare Minerals for years, tried this, and have stuck with it since. I would recommended at least giving this product a shot!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a replacement for my Emani makeup, which was no longer sold by my local store. I found Pur through the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s website, then I found this good deal on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The make-up is lightweight, but it covers well. I apply it with a large make-up brush, and I&#x27;m not disappointed. It leaves my face looking better-rested and younger than I really deserve.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love our minerals</li>
    <li> I have used Pur Minerals 4 in 1 foundation for over 5 years now, and I will NEVER go back to any other makeup!! Definitely recommend it to anyone who struggles with acne. It&#x27;s my compact miracle!!</li>
    <li> Lite with good coverage.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t dare put any other foundation on my face.  I have combination skin that flares up with breakouts and/or dryness at any moment.  This product has been instrumental in helping to prevent breakouts.  I&#x27;ve used it for years due to the health benefits it provides to my skin along with excellent coverage that can be light or heavier depending on how much is applied.</li>
    <li> Pur minerals is much better than bare minerals because the pressed powder doesn&#x27;t get all over the place.  I also travel a lot and never had the press powder break.</li>
    <li> Dry and way too pale.</li>
    <li> I have been using mineral makeup for about 15 years and have tried a lot of brands.  The brand I had been using had changed their formulation, raised their price; it was coming off when I blew my nose and it didn&#x27;t have nearly the shine control that it used to.  So that brought me to Amazon where I selected 2 products based upon their reviews and my skin type (oily).  Yesterday I tried this product and it never warmed to my skin.  It looked very geisha like, which was not the look I was going for.  I prefer a medium-full coverage which can be difficult to find for fair skin.  This was definitely more sheer coverage even though I applied it with a sponge applicator.  All in all I wasn&#x27;t too thrilled with this. I would say it was comparable to Neutrogena Sheer Minerals which you can get at a fraction of the cost.</li>
    <li> This is my Go To everyday make-up .. I am 47 and have tried everything. Doesnt cake, sit in fine lines, good coverage and best of all not skin irritation</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn mineral makeup for quite a few years now and try and use natural products. I wanted to search for pressed powder as it&#x27;s not as messy as the loose. This had good reviews so I gave it a try. Well, it&#x27;s by far the worst makeup I&#x27;ve ever tried. It looks so oily and cakey on my skin. I only used it a couple times and it caused me to break out horribly. My understanding from other reviews is that an older formula used to be better. Maybe that&#x27;s the reason for so many good reviews? I&#x27;m not sure, but I also ordered other Pur Mineral products with this powder and they were all completely awful. Their customer service is horrible too, it took 3 weeks to get a reply to an email and when you call the phone rings and then eventually hangs up, you can&#x27;t even leave a message. I would advice to avoid this company at all costs. Luckily, I was able to find Tarte cosmetics and love them. I definitely prefer their &amp;#34;Powderful&amp;#34; pressed compact better. And of course, you can purchase Tarte on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I used to be the biggest rep for pur minerals, especially the 4 in 1 pressed powder. Would have given it 5 stars for years. I had been wearing it in all seasons of the year for the past 3/4 years when I realized that the new compact I recently ordered was different. The packaging was different but the makeup looked/seemed the same so I put it on as usual. The first few days of wearing I noticed I was oiler and shinier than usual after a few hours of wear. I have acne scarring and some discoloration that I cover with a little foundation brush with the 4 in 1 makeup. I don&#x27;t wear all over my face as I don&#x27;t need it and feel less is more when it comes to sensitive skin wearing makeup all day. I finally came to the conclusion after almost a week that the new formula must be different. It was not wearing the same, and as I said before, it&#x27;s was glimmery..before it was more matte which is what I loved about it. The biggest upset is that in the week I was wearing the new formula of 4 in 1, I developed cystic acne on my chin. You can never be 100% sure of cause but my cystic acne has been under control until I started using the new compact of pur minerals. I found that the new formula contains BISMUTH which is a mineral that, A: makes the makeup more &#x27;glimmery&#x27; as i described (not a good look in my book) and B: can cause cystic acne and breakouts. So both of the things I noticed can be linked to the new formula of the 4 in 1 makeup. I am so upset that I have to look for a new concealer/foundation. Why oh why did they change the formula that was great for my skin? I didn&#x27;t want to believe it but it is definitely not the same product it was when I bought it 4 years ago. Thinking about going back to dermablend as it is good matte coverage that doesn&#x27;t effect my sensitive break out prone skin.</li>
    <li> I love this so much!!! It leaves my skin so clear!! I used to use bare minerals few years back and it made my skin all patchy and my skin color was different colors and it just didn&#x27;t work out. This our minerals is so amazing I won&#x27;t ever go to anything else</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years, love it! Offers coverage without a makeup look.</li>
    <li> 4 in 1 is the best way to describe this powder. For me, it provides the best coverage without any greasiness.  It also last for about 4 to 5 hours so you aren&#x27;t reapplying but once in a day.  It&#x27;s important that you use the right brush...</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, doesn&#x27;t break easily, your skin can breathe (lol) if you are like me and suffer from a random break out from time to time this really helps and it stays on your skin a lot longer than other make up, what more could a girl ask for?</li>
    <li> Love this makeup!  I have rosacea and this covers it perfectly.  No bumps either if you accidently leave it on.</li>
    <li> Not really much to say other than I really like the product, but I wish it wasn&#x27;t so darn expensive.</li>
    <li> Have been using this makeup brand for a year now.  Skin is not oily like other makeups do to me.  Nice to order online without going to the store!</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time, I would reorder this product again in the future</li>
    <li> This is the best makeup I&#x27;ve ever used. Worth the little bit extra cost.</li>
    <li> I have used this makeup/foundation for years and have always loved it. It covers great without flaking and the color is great.</li>
    <li> I have been using Pur Minerals for years now; I love this product!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few years now.  It has great coverage &amp; is light on your face!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t wear makeup because it too much work to put in and maintain. This stuff is great though, I just use a bursh to put it on and bam. I&#x27;m done. No blending, or funky face lines. One coat lasts all day. If I were going out to dinner I would need to powder my nose,  it the rest of my face would be fine. This is the only product I will use and continue to purchase</li>
    <li> I have been using Pur Minerals 4-in-1 Pressed Powder Mineral Makeup for 5 or 6 years now. I use Light in the months when my face has a bit of tan in it and Porcelain the rest of the year. I have rosacea, and it does not irritate my face or cause the rosacea to flare. It&#x27;s an excellent mineral makeup, and I plan to keep on using it. :)</li>
    <li> Easy to put on with great coverage.  This also layers well, which I find helpful for covering trouble spots.  I have very oily t-zone, and this helps keep the oil down, but when I do get oily later in the day, the coverage keeps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They used to have the mirror on bottom with a compartment to hold a sponge which I liked better, because now the mirror gets dirty with the powder, which I find to be a downside.  You can get thicker coverage using a makeup sponge, which I still use, but now I don&#x27;t have a good place to store it, plus I&#x27;m always having to wipe of the mirror.</li>
