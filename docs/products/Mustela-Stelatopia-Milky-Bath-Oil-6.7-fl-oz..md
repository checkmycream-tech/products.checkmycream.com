<ol>
      <li>Great product!  </li>
      <li>Mustela is the best.</li>
      <li>Wonderful product.</li>
      <li>Use in the bath creates a milky film that skin absorbs, when you take baby out SIM ppl my blot skin to keep product from washing off, works great!  </li>
      <li>I wish you all the great experience with it that we had!</li>
      <li>Seems to be the best way to keep our son&#x27;s skin moisturized and avoid rashes.</li>
      <li>A great company!</li>
      <li>My daughter&#x27;s eczema is now getting better !!!</li>
      <li>Great for eczema, wish it was cheaper.</li>
      <li>Works great</li>
      <li>Great for diaper rashes or skin irritant.  </li>
      <li>This stuff works great.  </li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t think it did a great job at keeping my baby moisturized.</li>
      <li>Good for babies with eczema.</li>
      <li>I am more than happy i bought it.</li>
      <li>It is a nice supplement to a good regime of skin care.</li>
      <li>Very light, but pleasant.</li>
      <li>Love!</li>
      <li>She sleeps better at night!</li>
      <li>Love this stuff!</li>
      <li>she does not scratch her head vigorously any more!</li>
      <li>comes out of the bath lightly oiled, and her skin is great.</li>
      <li>I recommend buying an organic sunflower oil and adding it to an oatmeal bath (Rainbow collodial oats or you can grind your own).</li>
      <li>For example, I don&#x27;t wash his body with any kind of cleanser.</li>
      <li>It keeps her skin nice and supple.</li>
      <li>It absorbs into his skin quite nicely.</li>
      <li>He seems to like a good ole oatmeal bath better than anything.</li>
      <li>and it is still as effective.</li>
      <li>We have a happy, clean, and balanced skin baby.</li>
      <li>However, this product is great and really resolved my son&#x27;s eczema!</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>Love it.  </li>
      <li>Love it love it love!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Then wash the hair with baby shampoo 1 or twice to make sure the oil is gone.</li>
      <li>I like this product, but I find that about a teaspoon of coconut oil works better to soften the skin.  </li>
      <li>maybe I have to put more?</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s even better when combined with the creamy wash and lotion.</li>
      <li>my daughter seems to enjoy it!</li>
      <li>I love Mustela baby creams.</li>
      <li>My babies skin comes out more smoother.</li>
      <li>I definitely recommend the moisturizer, even though it is has petroleum because it cleared up my son&#x27;s skin 95% and is the best his skin has been since 3 months.</li>
      <li>We bathe her three times a week using just these bath oils and it has successfully cleared it all up (once a week we use straight up soap instead).  </li>
      <li>Liked it so much I use it for my own bath.</li>
      <li>Very effective oil, but we go through it pretty quickly.</li>
      <li>She is now 3 months and has beautiful soft skin due to this fabulous oil!!!!</li>
      <li>I am not bashing this product, we have used Mustela products on all of our other children and we love them!!!!</li>
      <li>, this bath oil works great in the cheap plastic wash basin we now use, but when we used a different baby bath with a fabric liner, it made the liner smell.</li>
      <li>I amalso gping to try the Dolphin fragrance free lotion.</li>
      <li>Wish it was a larger size but works great.</li>
      <li>Well worth it to see how healthy her skin is now.</li>
      <li>and it was fabulous.</li>
      <li>If I use this then lotion then right after, it keeps their skin smooth!</li>
      <li>So I wrote to Mustela, and they confirmed this was the case with the sweet almond oil</li>
      <li>My daughter gets significant eczema patches on her knees and elbows.  </li>
      <li>So glad I did because as predicted our precious guy has sensitive skin!</li>
      <li>It works inmediatle and left my baby skin soft, and best of all, it does truly cure eczema in one use.</li>
      <li>We love it and would highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>really works well and her skin is much better.</li>
      <li>Clears it up with just the first use!</li>
      <li>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!</li>
      <li>It is truly fantastic at helping keep my baby&#x27;s skin smooth and soft.</li>
      <li>We rarely (if ever) use steroids anymore.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
      <li>We rarely use prescription cream to control it since adding to their bath each night.</li>
      <li>/&gt;We get about 4 baths worth of use out of this bottle.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I needed to get rid of the  mild scalp eczema of my children.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say it cured his eczema, but noticed right away that it stopped him from itching during and after his bath.</li>
      <li>my bottle arrived in the mail, I, too noticed the sweet almond oil in the list of ingredients and I was sure I would have to send it back.</li>
      <li>I use this as a last splash right before getting out the shower and it leaves my skin feeling so silky and soft, most importantly it doesnt irritate my eczema.</li>
      <li>;-)</li>
      <li>In fact, after his first bath in the milky oil, the first thing I noticed was he was, for once, not scratching and clawing at his skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Many people have the baby bathe for 15-20 minutes but 10 minutes has been enough for us.  </li>
      <li>Leaves your skin clean and soft.</li>
      <li>But this product didn&#x27;t show any positive result.</li>
      <li>Seller is amazing, there was a slight issue and they sent out another one immediately even when I said they didn&#x27;t have to.</li>
      <li>For winter or just really dry skin, would recommend following up with a good lotion.</li>
      <li>Works really well for us.  </li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t care much for the Mustela Stelatopia moisturizing cream.</li>
      <li>A whole arsenal of supplies.</li>
      <li>Really disappointed.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t do much for my sons eczema.  </li>
      <li>Washes away fast.  </li>
      <li>This has really helped with my infants eczema.</li>
      <li>I recommend the whole system of Stelatopia e.g. milky lotion cleanser and moisturizing lotion.  </li>
      <li>Cerave Cream really did it for us though.</li>
      <li>Helps my eczema so much.</li>
      <li>it doesn&#x27;t really like milk when it was poured into the water...</li>
      <li>The key is to do it the right way!</li>
      <li>This product is really effective for babies/infants when they get dry skin or eczema especially winter season.</li>
      <li>I noticed some parents of kids with nut allergies left comments that they couldn&#x27;t use this bath oil because one of the ingredients is sweet almond oil.</li>
      <li>My daughter only seems to have mild eczema break outs as the weather changes.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m particularly peeved because I can&#x27;t wash the oil smell out of the towel and bath mat I used after I took a bath with this oil.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Still, just to be safe, before the first bath with a new bottle, it is recommended that you place a bit of the bath oil on a cotton swab and apply it to a small area on the skin.</li>
      <li>Keeping him out of the dry heat and using a humidifier at home in the living room and keeping him cool.</li>
      <li>But I did some research and found a New York Times article that talked about how processing these oils remove the proteins that cause an allergic reaction.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s soo the bomb for sensitive skin!</li>
      <li>Our baby was getting dry, red splotches, even if we went light on the soap.</li>
      <li>We tried some cortisone to clear it up and found out she had hives from that too.</li>
      <li>He has sensitive skin.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Seems to be helping my kiddos&#x27; (age 4 and age 1) eczema.</li>
    <li> Not sure if this works. I&#x27;ve been using it on my baby but I feel like it&#x27;s not really helping her dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a lot of product , the bottle is small. Not what I expected, I thought it would work.</li>
    <li> I have eczema and did as a baby so I wasn&#x27;t taking any chances. I actually brought this to the hospital with me and requested that the nurse bath our baby boy using this and the cleanser by the same company rather than the standard J&amp;J stuff. So glad I did because as predicted our precious guy has sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> My daughter&#x27;s eczema is now getting better !!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it doesn&#x27;t really like milk when it was poured into the water...maybe I have to put more?</li>
    <li> Mustela products have national eczema association seal of approval, that is why I wanted to try if it would help my son to relieve his eczema, I didn&#x27;t see any drastic difference and will not repurchase it again. At the same time i don&#x27;t have any negative comments about the product.</li>
    <li> Love! Doesn&#x27;t leave sink or tub too greasy.  Washes away fast.  But leaves baby&#x27;s skin soft. For winter or just really dry skin, would recommend following up with a good lotion. Oh and the fragrance is yummy.  Very light, but pleasant.</li>
    <li> I noticed some parents of kids with nut allergies left comments that they couldn&#x27;t use this bath oil because one of the ingredients is sweet almond oil. My son also has a nut allergy. He has bathed in this -- three capfuls per bath, up to twice a day -- during major eczema flareups and he has NOT had any problems. In fact, after his first bath in the milky oil, the first thing I noticed was he was, for once, not scratching and clawing at his skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my bottle arrived in the mail, I, too noticed the sweet almond oil in the list of ingredients and I was sure I would have to send it back. But I did some research and found a New York Times article that talked about how processing these oils remove the proteins that cause an allergic reaction. So I wrote to Mustela, and they confirmed this was the case with the sweet almond oil: the allergens are removed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, just to be safe, before the first bath with a new bottle, it is recommended that you place a bit of the bath oil on a cotton swab and apply it to a small area on the skin.</li>
    <li> This product is really effective for babies/infants when they get dry skin or eczema especially winter season. We started using this on my son when he was 6 months old. Now he is about 3 and it is still as effective. Just be careful when using in a tub, it can get really slippery (because it is oil).</li>
    <li> I use this as a last splash right before getting out the shower and it leaves my skin feeling so silky and soft, most importantly it doesnt irritate my eczema. I will be using this always from now on.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! I use it for my kids when their eczema flares up. If I use this then lotion then right after, it keeps their skin smooth!</li>
    <li> We use this to wash out baby&#x27;s head.  Our son has monster cradle cap, we felt the Mustela shampoo was too harsh and drying so we have started a daily &amp;#34;cap&amp;#34; wash where we dry brush his head with a natural fiber boar&#x27;s hair brush (to loosen the flakes) and then we wet his head, apply a few drops of the milky bath, lather and brush gently in one direction, rinse, pat dry, and brush with a SUPER gentle goat&#x27;s hair brush.  Lots of brushes and care but we wanted to keep his head from getting too dry and irritated.</li>
    <li> My 9 month old has been using this for about two month now. I use generous amount in her bath and after a week of use, her cradle cap was gone! We live in Colorado, so weather is super dry specially when the weather gets cold. she does not scratch her head vigorously any more! She does not pull her hairs anymore! She sleeps better at night! no more bleeding on her scalp!&lt;br /&gt;She had pretty bad eczema on her face, too..It&#x27;s gone now. Her face was flaky and would bleed time to time even when I put Vanicream on her 10 times a day.&lt;br /&gt;just be careful when you pick up your baby after bath, after all this is oil and will make your baby slippery. ;-)</li>
    <li> We were skeptical whether this product would work.  However, this product is great and really resolved my son&#x27;s eczema! We love it and would highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This product has worked wonders for our kids&#x27; eczema.  We rarely use prescription cream to control it since adding to their bath each night.</li>
    <li> My son has eczema that flare up in a handful of spots every few weeks and when it does they get raw and very irritated. I use this in combination with the Mustela Stelatopia Cream Cleanser and Aquaphor and it usually calms the flare up down within a few days and takes about a week and a half to heal completely. The Milky Bath is a bit pricey and you go through the bottle quick if using daily, so I only use it daily when I notice his skin is starting to get irritated, dry and when he&#x27;s got a dry patch. I do however use the cream cleanser and aquaphor daily.</li>
    <li> Our little baby came home and we used J&amp;J with no real problem. Then about 2 months old she started have dry skin and a rash on the back of her arms and legs. We found out she was allergic to flame retardants in her car seat. We tried some cortisone to clear it up and found out she had hives from that too. So this has been our go to. It keeps her skin from getting too dry and the balanced skin can then help keep the flame retardants from bothering her. We use it head to toe about 3 times a week and the bottle lasts almost 2 months. We don&#x27;t have to rinse it, but I do brush her hair with a wet comb to get some of it out. We have a happy, clean, and balanced skin baby. Now if they would only put it in stores.</li>
    <li> Nothing works like this oil for my baby&#x27;s eczema. Clears it up with just the first use! It&#x27;s even better when combined with the creamy wash and lotion.</li>
    <li> we have used this for my 18mo old since she started having excema at 4mo old. really works well and her skin is much better. she isn&#x27;t crying and scratching at night!</li>
    <li> Great for diaper rashes or skin irritant.  Use in the bath creates a milky film that skin absorbs, when you take baby out SIM ppl my blot skin to keep product from washing off, works great!  I recommend the whole system of Stelatopia e.g. milky lotion cleanser and moisturizing lotion.  It&#x27;s soo the bomb for sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my son who has excema. Liked it so much I use it for my own bath. Leaves your skin clean and soft.</li>
    <li> O.M.G!!, this stuff its really, really good!!!.I didn&#x27;t bought it here, because i want it fast, and with the shipping would be more expensive, so i went to baby r us and got it. I jyst stop here to write a review, so the people who is hesitating about buyng, DONT BE!, you regreat it. It works inmediatle and left my baby skin soft, and best of all, it does truly cure eczema in one use. I am more than happy i bought it.</li>
    <li> Certainly you can&#x27;t expect everyone to experience the same results, so I can only report on how this product worked for my son...and it was fabulous. He has pretty mild eczema--much worse during the dry winter months. But the poor kid scratches himself until he bleeds :(&lt;br /&gt;After 2 baths with the Stelatopia, his dry, itchy patches were completely gone. Two.  It was unreal.  I wish you all the great experience with it that we had!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, just wish it was less expensive!</li>
    <li> This really helps our toddler&#x27;s dry skin.</li>
    <li> I bought this in conjunction with the soap and lotion after reviewing all eczema treatments. A whole arsenal of supplies. My daughter only seems to have mild eczema break outs as the weather changes. This cleared it up almost immediately. I only use it every so often now. It leaves a film on the tub and her toys but it is oil after all. Well worth it to see how healthy her skin is now.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do much for my sons eczema.  We&#x27;ve tried everything and nothing seems to help.  He seems to like a good ole oatmeal bath better than anything.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed to get rid of the  mild scalp eczema of my children.&lt;br /&gt;It put a few drops and massage their scalp, let sit for 20min and then use a comb. Then wash the hair with baby shampoo 1 or twice to make sure the oil is gone.</li>
    <li> Love it love it love!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My son had (has?) severe head to toe eczema at 2 months which became horrific and unmanageable at 3 months. It was so scary that we had to resort to steroids to reduce the rashes that were spread ALL over his body. Of course, the rashes came back after we stopped using the steroids. I didn&#x27;t want the steroids to become the usual go-to treatment so we discovered a few things that really helped our son. Remind you, he&#x27;s 4 months and he is starting to grow out of it a little but I still swear by this product as one of the key ingredients in ensuring he no longer has flare-ups .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We get about 4 baths worth of use out of this bottle. Now that&#x27;s expensive but let me tell you, I would pay a lot a lot more if I had to. I mix the bath oil with the Aveeno baby oatmeal bath. I kid you not- I see the rashes reducing in the bath. Many people have the baby bathe for 15-20 minutes but 10 minutes has been enough for us.  He still has some patches of red spots that show up here and there, especially on his legs where he has it the worst to begin with. After his bath, those areas are significantly reduced and in the morning, they&#x27;re usually gone. He no longer gets those scary raised rashes that look red and fiery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your baby has  moderate to severe eczema, don&#x27;t be afraid to bathe him/her every day or every other day. The key is to do it the right way! For example, I don&#x27;t wash his body with any kind of cleanser. He doesn&#x27;t need it! I do use the Mustela Stelatopia cream cleanser to wash his hair. He has eczema on his head too and a lot a lot of dandruff. I also use lukewarm water (never hot).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t care much for the Mustela Stelatopia moisturizing cream. I went through 4 tubes so believe me I tried to make it work but I don&#x27;t think it did a great job at keeping my baby moisturized. Cerave Cream really did it for us though. Immediately after my son&#x27;s bath, we lather him in Cerave cream. It absorbs into his skin quite nicely. I moisturize with Cerave at every diaper change also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My son still has eczema but it&#x27;s not a major concern anymore as we have figured out how to manage it well. We rarely (if ever) use steroids anymore.</li>
    <li> I like this product, but I find that about a teaspoon of coconut oil works better to soften the skin.  This is very expensive for the small bottle so my expectations for results for my kids itchy skin was high.  It is a nice supplement to a good regime of skin care.</li>
    <li> Helps my eczema so much. I love this stuff.</li>
    <li> My 2 month old had very dry, flaky skin I tried everything and nothing worked until I found this product. It&#x27;s worth every penny. In combination with the cream cleanser my baby&#x27;s skin showed signs of improvement within 2 days. I recommend this to every parent with a little one suffering from severe dry skin.</li>
    <li> LO&#x27;s eczema improved alot after we started using this and the Mustela moisturizing balm.</li>
    <li> My youngest son is 17 months old. A few months ago, I noticed he was developing &amp;#34;chicken skin&amp;#34; or Keratosis Pilaris. We tried every skin cream on the market from the inexpensive, to the homeopathic, to the very expensive and even foreign with no positive results. It wasn&#x27;t until I was randomly shops ng here on Amazon that I came upon this product. I read the reviews, consulted with the pediatrician and figured we had nothing to lose. To my delight and amazement, this product works!! It is truly fantastic at helping keep my baby&#x27;s skin smooth and soft. And all you have to do is add the oil to their bath water. My son&#x27;s skin is softer and feeling like what a baby&#x27;s skin should feel like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***** FIVE STARS!!! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!! *****</li>
    <li> My daughter gets significant eczema patches on her knees and elbows.  We bathe her three times a week using just these bath oils and it has successfully cleared it all up (once a week we use straight up soap instead).  She also happens to hate moisturizers and using this has reduced the need for moisturizers.  I highly recommend giving this a try if you or your child has eczema or even just dry skin.</li>
    <li> I love Mustela baby creams. But this product didn&#x27;t show any positive result. Just waste of money. Won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> Works great my daughter seems to enjoy it! She still has her rough patches but they stay moisturized for quite some time after bathing with the milk bath.</li>
    <li> Good for babies with eczema. My babies skin comes out more smoother.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. My baby loves it. Seller is amazing, there was a slight issue and they sent out another one immediately even when I said they didn&#x27;t have to.</li>
    <li> This oil, and make no mistake about it, this is an OIL, is a wonder bath additive for eczema.  It&#x27;s the one product that has helped my child with her skin irritations.  Just a little in the bath, ten minutes of soaking and her skin is much improved.  I even take a little of the oil and dab on her &amp;#34;hot spots&amp;#34;.  Mustela is the best.</li>
    <li> After trying a multitude of products to help clear up my newborn&#x27;s eczema without any luck, I finally came across this and it worked - my baby&#x27;s eczema cleared up almost immediately. This is a holy grail of baby products for me.</li>
    <li> This made a big difference. Our baby was getting dry, red splotches, even if we went light on the soap. We also use Aveeno Baby Soothing Relief Creamy Wash. All unscented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Baby comes out of the bath lightly oiled, and her skin is great. We just dry her off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note, this bath oil works great in the cheap plastic wash basin we now use, but when we used a different baby bath with a fabric liner, it made the liner smell. Zero problem with the all-plastic bowl.</li>
    <li> Love it.  I bought it for my toddler who has eczema.  After one bath with this oil and the lipid replenishing balm, her skin cleared up almost completely.</li>
    <li> Great for eczema, wish it was cheaper.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Cleared my newborn&#x27;s rashes instantly.</li>
    <li> Works really well for us.  Seems to be the best way to keep our son&#x27;s skin moisturized and avoid rashes.</li>
    <li> It smells awful, like rancid oil. Maybe I just got some bad bottles that had spoiled? I bought two and they both smell the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t have taken the time to review this but I&#x27;m particularly peeved because I can&#x27;t wash the oil smell out of the towel and bath mat I used after I took a bath with this oil. Really disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two stars are for the oil making my skin feel soft, despite the aroma.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great.  Thought it would leave my sons hair and body greasy but it did not.  Wish it was a larger size but works great.</li>
    <li> Great product!  This has really helped with my infants eczema.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product on my daughter from the day she was born. After her bath, I would pat her dry and just add minimal lotion. It keeps her skin nice and supple.</li>
    <li> My 18 month old had a reaction to something in this. He has sensitive skin. He also reacted to the cleanser. Body went red. Used aveeno eczema baby bath therapy until redness was gone... a few days later I switched to all natural without mineral oil since that was keeping his skin dry underneath the top layers. I recommend buying an organic sunflower oil and adding it to an oatmeal bath (Rainbow collodial oats or you can grind your own). Then, cleansing a few times a week with a glycerine bar or I&#x27;m going to try Dolphin Organic shampoo and body wash. I amalso gping to try the Dolphin fragrance free lotion. I also purchased the stelatopia moisturizer and balm. They worked well for 2 weeks and then his skin was dry in the day time even with the moisturizer.  This is when I decided not to mask his skin in mineral oil/ petroleum. I definitely recommend the moisturizer, even though it is has petroleum because it cleared up my son&#x27;s skin 95% and is the best his skin has been since 3 months. Keeping him out of the dry heat and using a humidifier at home in the living room and keeping him cool.</li>
    <li> My daughter had dry skin and baby acne. She is now 3 months and has beautiful soft skin due to this fabulous oil!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this as another product to try for my son&#x27;s eczema. I wouldn&#x27;t say it cured his eczema, but noticed right away that it stopped him from itching during and after his bath. It moisturizes the skin without being too greasy. It does leave the bathtub a little slick so be careful. I wish it were a bigger bottle for the price because it doesn&#x27;t last long if you follow the directions. It has been one of the only products that keeps my son from scratching his skin around bath time, that&#x27;s why it earned 5 stars in my book.</li>
    <li> As an Atopic adult I passed the gene down to my daughter. Please be careful when using creams, oils, lotion.  Have your children allergy tested for soy, eggs, wheat, nuts, grass etc, etc.  This product contains Almond oil, a nut.  Also, Sunflower oil.  I am not bashing this product, we have used Mustela products on all of our other children and we love them!!!! A great company!</li>
    <li> Very effective oil, but we go through it pretty quickly. Suggest that the company supply a much bigger bottle with a pump in the future.</li>
