    <li> great nippers. easy to use, soft and they don&#x27;t cut you off. recommend.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product.  I had to replace the nippers I have had for 30 years.  I hope these serve me as well.</li>
    <li> These are very good nippers and I was happy with the length of time it took to get them</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Mehaz for the 10 years I&#x27;ve been manicuring and have to agree their product has taken a nose dive. I usually have to buy local because only then can I take them out of package and make sure the edge&#x27;s of both side meet. Nine out of the ten I open the edge&#x27;s don&#x27;t meet, end to end! Very sad! I&#x27;m looking for another maker!</li>
    <li> very happy with these nippers. they are very sharp and just the right size for trimming around my cuticles.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen the Mehaz get rave reviews. I feel they are OK--pretty sharp as far as the cutting goes--but a little awkward to handle (too large to fit in my hand?). And they don&#x27;t come with any sort of case or way to protect the tip. I have a case from my old nippers, but these are too large to fit in it.</li>
    <li> These are the best cuticle clippers I&#x27;ve used thus far! Sharp, smooth, no pulling.  I&#x27;ve only had them a couple of weeks, so I can&#x27;t speak yet to their longevity and no rust.  But I&#x27;m hoping they prove out as others commented.</li>
    <li> These are very nice and sharp nippers, just a little too tight for my liking. May need to adjust them.</li>
    <li> cheap and good quality!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not want to anything else but this nipper!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;why should I need more from this?</li>
    <li> I choose these because they were not made in China. German pride can be found in their workmanship no matter where they go. You get what you pay for only time can tell.</li>
    <li> This is my third pair of nippers, the others do go blunt after a while, the difference with these is they have a much more refined nip to get to very small cuticles.</li>
    <li> This nipper is very sharp, but a little difficult to work with</li>
    <li> Works for me, ideal for small hands.</li>
    <li> The 1/4 inch jaw is the perfect size.</li>

    <li> Perfect, just what I hoped for.  The quality was as good as the ones I had purchased years ago at a fine cutlery store.</li>
    <li> I am so pleased with this purchase! The device is so well-engineered and manufactured. The small jaw allows a high degree of precision in use. This is such a step forward from the cosmetic-company nippers I had before. I strongly endorse this product.</li>
    <li> Very disappointing.  One side of the nipper blades bent after having these for less than a month; now they are unusable.</li>
    <li> Very high quality clippers, nice and sharp, well built</li>
    <li> These are great, very sharp (be careful) work great on hang nails.</li>
    <li> Very easy to handle, sharp and excellent quality.  Creates professional result.</li>
    <li> Great price I could find.  Arrived in 3 days.</li>
    <li> I have tried other brands of cuticle clippers but was not happy with them. This is my third Mehaz Nipper in many, many years and the quality of this brand cannot be beat.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Fast fast shipping!</li>
