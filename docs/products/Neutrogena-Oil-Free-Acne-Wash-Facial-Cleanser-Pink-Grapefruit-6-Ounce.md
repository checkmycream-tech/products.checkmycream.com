      <li>I have &amp; love all of the Neutrogena Oil Free Acne Pink Grapefruit products.</li>
      <li>But on my most severe red, dry, itchy flaking parts, I put a nice amount of A&amp;D ointment on it (yes, diaper rash cream)</li>
      <li>I like the scrub much better but its a personal preference.</li>
      <li>I feel like the price is pretty comparable to in-store pricing as well.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin/somewhat smooth, although i wish it could stay that way..</li>
      <li>I have been a huge fan of the Neutrogena Oil Free Acne Pink Grapefruit products (wash, scrub and wipes) for a couple of months</li>
      <li>i have really sensitive skin, I can rerely use toners or special face washes</li>
      <li>If you use a wash cloth and kinda rinse your face and then put a little bit of this on its amazing.</li>
      <li>Though it did help a little, it didn&#x27;t help as much as I would&#x27;ve liked.</li>
      <li>I really hope this is helpful.</li>
      <li>and it really freshens your face as well as cleans it</li>
      <li>It also leaves your face soft and fresh smelling.</li>

      <li>I only have light acne</li>

      <li>I only have light acne</li>
      <li>I feel like the important ingredients are penetrating deep into my skin to unclog my pores with every tingle!!</li>
      <li>I originally thought it was just a standard lathering cleanser with a creamy texture (much like Clearasil&#x27;s Daily Cleanser or Noxzema&#x27;s Triple Clean cleanser)</li>
      <li>Like any other teenagers whose face is wrecked by the raging hormones, his face sometimes is more like moon surface.</li>
      <li>I believe I bought the Neutrogena Deep Clean at Target for about $5, maybe even $4.</li>
      <li>Anyways, when i first tried this product it made my face feel tight, then it got really really dry(i had always had dry skin before this, so this product made my face more dry), So i kept using because perhaps i thought my skin was trying to get used to it, and it somewhat  helps, but honestly i still get zits after i use this.</li>
      <li>Please, please do not waste your money on this garbage, unless you want to feel like a molting boa constrictor in the hot sun in the desert.</li>
      <li>As a result, I would get the occasional pimple but didn&#x27;t have a true acne \\&quot;problem.\\&quot;</li>
      <li>Most regular doctors will treat acne too so an expensive appointment with a specialist or dermatologist may not be necessary so check with your regular M.D. Good luck!!</li>
      <li>Decent staple product to keep on hand.</li>
      <li>This actually makes your face feel clean, especially when you first start using it.</li>
      <li>and this helps me feel clean with out making my skin flaky and dry.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Like any other teenagers whose face is wrecked by the raging hormones, his face sometimes is more like moon surface. He tried a few products on the market but sticks to this one after a few tries.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin and this helps me feel clean with out making my skin flaky and dry. I also love the scent!</li>
    <li> THis product is of high quality - I ordered it 3 times - every time same quality.&lt;br /&gt;It is not greasy and refreshes perfectly</li>
    <li> I actually bought this product on accident thinking it was a moisturizer rather than a wash (don&#x27;t ask). I previously purchased the pink grapefruit facial cleanser in the plastic bottle. And fell in love with the smell and it worked really well so I went looking for a lotion form and grabbed this.     I read the reviews on it and got nothing so I went into the bathroom and tried it myself and immediately I loved it. If you use a wash cloth and kinda rinse your face and then put a little bit of this on its amazing. It gives this refreshing cool burst which I have come to love in the mornings. It doesn&#x27;t dry out your face too bad, of course like most acne cleansers removes a lot oils  and stuff but I was amazed at how soft my face felt after. I use this in the morning and the regular cleanser at night. I&#x27;d be careful doing that you don&#x27;t want to dry out your face too much and remove too much of the natural oils on your face, but i really like it. I&#x27;d recommend both products, they&#x27;re both really nice.</li>
    <li> It smells great but I dont like the film feeling it leaves on my face. I like the scrub much better but its a personal preference. The brand is great, just not a huge fan of the cream cleanser.</li>
    <li> I like Neutrogena products, but this one just has a smell that I can not stand. I expected a fresh grapefruit/citrus scent, but it just doesn&#x27;t smell like grapefruit at all.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s simple, rub this stuff into your face. I like to leave it on a few minutes, then wash it off. Nothing else I&#x27;ve tried leaves my face feeling so clean and looking so good. I have, like, this rosy glow and people tell me I look good. What more could you want. I&#x27;ve tried the expensive stuff, but this has it beat. A brilliant purchase!</li>
    <li> This cleanser is so ineffective and inefficient, that it doesn&#x27;t even take off the make-up off my face. I&#x27;ve been using Neutrogena for years and I love their line. But not this product. Would not recommend it and will not buy it again.</li>
    <li> smells good. leaves my face feeling soft.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin/somewhat smooth, although i wish it could stay that way.. Sometimes I get zits on my face and they take FOREVER TO GO away. So i decided to try a product to prevent future zits, because i usually get them over night, and i end up waking up with a pimple on my face! Anyways, when i first tried this product it made my face feel tight, then it got really really dry(i had always had dry skin before this, so this product made my face more dry), So i kept using because perhaps i thought my skin was trying to get used to it, and it somewhat  helps, but honestly i still get zits after i use this. ( I personally wouldn&#x27;t it bu it again.</li>
    <li> They took these out of all the stores near me! I used it mainly for spot treatment and believe me my skin was perfect. Now in the stores they have the scrub kind but that just makes me break out. $8 freaking for the smallest tube they make! So glad I found this cause it looks like my four years of clear skin is up and it&#x27;s a dewsy. I finally look like a teenager for my last year of being one.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I bought the generic brand of this, only used it twice and my skin got so dry and red, I am absolutely miserable. I try not to itch but it&#x27;s awful. It makes your skin feel good for about 2 seconds and then that&#x27;s it.  My skin constantly feels like it&#x27;s on fire and is just red, itchy and flaky. My acne is gone, but what I got instead is much, much worse.  Please, please do not waste your money on this garbage, unless you want to feel like a molting boa constrictor in the hot sun in the desert. .&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been reading the reviews to figure out how to fix it and no one seems to be offering any solutions. HOWEVER! I did find something that helps. After I shower, I use a cotton pillow case, make it really cold with cold cold cold water and dab (NOT RUB) on my face.  Then I&#x27;ve been putting a small layer of Aquaphor on my skin (that stuff is awesome). But on my most severe red, dry, itchy flaking parts, I put a nice amount of A&amp;D ointment on it (yes, diaper rash cream) and it seems to take the itchiness away and doesn&#x27;t burn as bad. It doesn&#x27;t take it completely away but it definitely is very helpful. I put it on at night so I don&#x27;t smell like a chaffing baby during the day. I really hope this is helpful.</li>
    <li> After trying several other cleansers for acne, I bought this for my daughter who had recently started to break out. My daughter loves the creaminess and the smell of this product. She uses it everyday, morning and before bed - followed by an oil free moisturizer. I noticed a difference in her complexion within a week! Her skin looks much clearer and less red. Other products dried out her skin and she found the acne scrub products  irritated her skin making her blemishes look worse and actually impeding the healing process. Bottom line, the cream version works and I will continue to buy it for my daughter!</li>
    <li> it is very good. i use it now .It smells good .Very lubrication skin fresh and pure and fresh. good</li>
    <li> Works well and doesn&#x27;t really dry out my skin.</li>
    <li> Did not work I&#x27;m sorry</li>
    <li> I know that acne-fighting products work differently for everyone, but this just didn&#x27;t work for me. I have fair, sensitive skin (I am a redhead). My skin has relatively normal texture: neither excessively oily nor excessively dry. As a result, I would get the occasional pimple but didn&#x27;t have a true acne \\&quot;problem.\\&quot; Unfortunately, for the last two years I have been breaking out more severely. My breakouts usually occur as inflamed red bumps (no whiteheads or blackheads). These breakouts are on my chin and forehead, and sometimes my nose. Anyway, I really wanted to like this pink grapefruit cream cleanser but as I said, it did not diminish my acne. I gave it two stars because I loved the scent as well as the fact that it was a cream cleanser (as I have found liquid or foaming cleansers to be too drying). Anyway, everyone&#x27;s skin is different, so this may work for some, but I am still looking for the product that will work for me.</li>
    <li> I love the nice airy scent and the creamy texture. Works wonders on my occasional acne. I do alternate between 2-3 different face washes though so that my face doesn&#x27;t become too accustomed to one in particular. I feel like the price is pretty comparable to in-store pricing as well. I say give it a go it you are are looking for something to help out with your facial acne. Nice product!</li>
    <li> The \\&quot;Oil-Free\\&quot; label is misleading. It may not contain oil, but this is a very heavy, moisturizing cold-cream type cleanser. I originally thought it was just a standard lathering cleanser with a creamy texture (much like Clearasil&#x27;s Daily Cleanser or Noxzema&#x27;s Triple Clean cleanser) but this is an actual lotion cleanser, similar to standard cold cream, that definitely leaves an oily residue on skin. I had to re-wash my face with a standard cleanser to remove the residue. Rubbing a heavy lotion all over one&#x27;s face is NOT a good idea for oily skin that is already prone to breakouts and blackheads, and all the salicylic acid in the world is going to be useless in this formula. I was scared to use it a 2nd time; 30 - 40 seconds on my face could mean 2 week&#x27;s worth of recovery time from a massive breakout. We acne sufferers have trouble enough fighting clogged pores on a daily basis. We don&#x27;t need a skincare product to make it worse.</li>
    <li> Happy with this product. Cleans effectively.</li>
    <li> Before I tried the pink grapefruit version I was using the normal (unsented?) one. If I keep up with washing my face once a day with this my skin looks great. I kind of like the smell of this one too but if it came down to price I&#x27;d probably just purchase the regular one because it works just as well.</li>
    <li> This cream cleanser is a nice face wash. I leave it on for a couple of minutes and it really freshens your face as well as cleans it</li>
    <li> Very good for oil skin, i like it and this produce is suitable for oil skin people in asian areas</li>
    <li> I love this face wash! It cleans well, yet the creamy formula does not dry out my skin. Perfect for my combination skin! It also smells delicious which is always a bonus. I have been using it for several years!</li>
    <li> This does a good job but leaves a bad smell in a washcloth.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something new for my skin and purchase this because it smelled great and seemed like it would be good for the cooler months. This product is awful. I have fairly average skin, not really dry or oily. This product is extremely heavy and leaves my skin feeling greasy, almost like I&#x27;ve applied way too much moisturizer. It also does nothing for breakouts or my skin tone. I really wanted to give this product a chance and used it faithfully for 3 weeks and my skin looks the worst it has since I was a teenager (10years ago).</li>
    <li> I usually wash my face while I&#x27;m in the shower in the mornings and this stuff not only made me break out on my face but also all over my chest (from running off my face onto my chest while washing off).  I only used it a couple times and had to stop.</li>
    <li> i have really sensitive skin, I can rerely use toners or special face washes and I normally just stick to cetaphil because of my eczema, but I&#x27;ve been getting really bad clogged pores with all the extra lotion my skin needed this winter, and this stuff does the trick! I also got the wipes which are awesome.</li>
    <li> I have used this cleanser for a couple of years and it does help my acne as long as I don&#x27;t pick at my pimples. What I normally do it use a gentle cleanser and toner to make sure there isn&#x27;t any dirt or makeup on my face and when the toner dries I put on this product. I treat it like a mask and put a layer on my face and wait. After about 5-10 minutes (normally brushing my teeth and mouthwash) you&#x27;ll feel a small tingling but not burning. After the 5-10 minutes I wash it off and pat dry with a paper towel, then put on my moisturizer. Depending on how severe my acne is I do this once daily at maximum, but if not I&#x27;ll do this every 3 days or so and do other face treatments throughout the week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Disclaimer: I usually don&#x27;t use as many products on my face unless it is treating acne because my face doesn&#x27;t absorb the treatment unless my face is completely dirt free, but everyone is different.</li>
    <li> I have hereditary problems with acne. It appears at random on my face, back, and chest. While this is annoying, this is something I have to deal with regularly. I&#x27;ve never found a &amp;#34;acne wash&amp;#34; that works without fail, but this one did help a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are a few good things about this product: The smell is better than most face washes, though I don&#x27;t know that it really smells like grape fruit. This actually makes your face feel clean, especially when you first start using it. I was surprised, I don&#x27;t think my face has ever felt so clean! Even when I didn&#x27;t wear make up for a few days and washed my face everyday, my face never felt so fresh! It definitely gives you a more confident feeling. I felt less nervous about going outside without make up after I put it on. I like the texture of this product as well, the cream doesn&#x27;t feel hard or rough. It didn&#x27;t really seem to dry out my skin too badly either, which is a common problem I have with face washes or any &amp;#34;acne clearing&amp;#34; product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad- I went through a bottle FAST. I&#x27;m not sure if I was using too much, or what made it seem to go so quickly. I used it every morning before applying make up, and every night after removing make up before bed. Though it did help a little, it didn&#x27;t help as much as I would&#x27;ve liked. It seemed break outs I already had did not go away, and I didn&#x27;t see a major noticeable difference. Break outs did ease up a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend going with this Neutrogena alternative rather than grape fruit if you are purchasing locally rather than ordering off Amazon-  http://www.amazon.com/Neutrogena-Oil-Free-Clean-Cream-Cleanser/dp/B000052ZB5/ref&#x3D;sr_1_2?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1396912084&amp;sr&#x3D;8-2&amp;keywords&#x3D;neutrogena+deep+clean&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I recommend the other product is because of the price, and quantity. I believe I bought the Neutrogena Deep Clean at Target for about $5, maybe even $4. This product is much more effective, but the smell isn&#x27;t as nice and it won&#x27;t make you feel as clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall Neutrogena&#x27;s Grape Fruit wash deserves about 3.5-4 stars. How well it works? Not as well as I wish it would- especially not for the higher price. The smell is great, and the color and texture of the product make it cute and fun! (Yes, I just said fun.) If you only have moderate acne or break outs, this product would probably work great for you!ice and it won&#x27;t make you feel as clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall Neutrogena&#x27;s Grape Fruit wash deserves about 3.5-4 stars.

    <li> I am 46 and I am oily in the t-zone, normal on my cheeks and I get whiteheads and clogged pores on my chin and along my jawline that lead to cystic acne. I have been a huge fan of the Neutrogena Oil Free Acne Pink Grapefruit products (wash, scrub and wipes) for a couple of months now so I purchased the Cream Cleanser to try. It feels just like a very expensive spa facial cleanser and I&#x27;ve wasted so much money on skin care in the past. Luscious is the best way to describe this cleanser but it has ingredients to treat and prevent acne, however, I seriously doubt ANY single cleanser is going to stop your acne problem unless it&#x27;s a very slight one. Almost always it takes a combination of products, very good hygiene, a decent balanced diet and good old trial &amp; error. This creamy cleanser cleans perfectly WITHOUT stripping my face of moisture. My skin is never dry or tight feeling afterwards. I feel like the important ingredients are penetrating deep into my skin to unclog my pores with every tingle!! If you don&#x27;t like tingling products try the wash or if you prefer a good scrubbing Neutrogena makes a scrub as well. If you love the feeling a scrub gives you - you may not FEEL clean enough even though you ARE after using this creamy cleanser. I have &amp; love all of the Neutrogena Oil Free Acne Pink Grapefruit products. The WASH leaves my face squeaky clean but slightly tight feeling, the SCRUB leaves my face gently buffed but also slightly tight feeling but I still like them both. I prefer the creamy cleanser because I love the clean feeling the TINGLES give me and the SOFT, MOISTURIZED feel of my skin after I use it. I do NOT feel as if a filmy residue is left behind but I always use a clean wash cloth (wet w/hot water) when cleaning my face no matter what brand of cleanser I use and I follow that up with a very cool rinse. I use a Pink Grapefruit cleansing product (wash, scrub or creamy cleanser) twice daily and I follow that up with the Neutrogena Rapid Clear Fight &amp; Fade Toner. My skin looks so much better and I am very fortunate that my cystic acne break outs have responded well to the 2% salicylic acid in the products. As a pleasant surprise I&#x27;ve recently noticed that my deep forehead wrinkles and crows feet are less noticeable since I began using the salicylic products almost two months ago (:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI: Keep in mind that RARELY does ONE product eliminate acne. I only have light acne and I must be vigilant in the prevention of it. I still have a break out rarely but every once in a while so I apply a dot of a sulphur mask (any brand) onto the pimple or area and leave it overnight. The sulphur masks are the absolute best spot treatments that I&#x27;ve found to dry up an existing pimple and the local stores carry them in the acne section. Benzoyl Peroxide products do not work for ME. PLEASE if you have serious acne and the anti-acne kits do not work for you - seek medical advice! There is no reason for anyone to be traumatized by acne and this happens often especially with teenagers. Most regular doctors will treat acne too so an expensive appointment with a specialist or dermatologist may not be necessary so check with your regular M.D. Good luck!!Toner.

    <li> This product is terrible! It smells like B.O. and I contacted manufacturer and got a $10 credit to use on a different Neutrogena product....definitely wont be buying this again</li>
    <li> This stuff is so nice. It really helps and doesn&#x27;t smell awful like other products out there. It&#x27;s a creamy texture but still lathers a bit once you work it in. It doesn&#x27;t dry my face out when I use it all week either, so long as I still use a moisturizer before bed. I actually use theirs and it smells just as nice.</li>
    <li> good scent; provides a good cleaning. The only negative is the long list of synthetic ingredients.  It performs as expected. This is a good value.  Decent staple product to keep on hand.</li>
    <li> This acne wash works. It won&#x27;t dry your skin out and has natural salicylic acid from grapefruit extract. It is awesome.</li>
    <li> by far the best face wash I have ever used. It also leaves your face soft and fresh smelling. I feel like a totally different person when I use this product. ThankYou</li>
    <li> This left my skin feeling oily and not very clean.  I thought I was getting a replacement of a gritty product that works really well.  My fault, but the labels are practically identical.  Pay attention!  I will probably toss this moderately expensive tube out because it is just too heavy And greasy, I dont trust it for my acne regimen.</li>
