      <li>I love it.</li>

      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>Well, I fell in love with this stuff.</li>
      <li>but i love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I absoultly love this product.</li>
      <li>I totally love the Moroccan Oil Hydrating Styling Cream.</li>
      <li>Maybe it works better on thicker hair...who knows?</li>
      <li>I know my hair will be better protected and hydrated with this.</li>
      <li>I also feel like the oil does a better job with frizzy split</li>
      <li>Better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I ordered the Moroccan Oil hydrating styling</li>
      <li>and you&#x27;re better off with some cheapie drug store brand.  </li>
      <li>It adds a lovely shine and softness to my hair.  </li>
      <li>Makes my hair soft and shiny, in a good way!</li>
      <li>Using these products makes my hair stay healthy, always smooth and shiny like silk.</li>
      <li>With cancer, it helps you to feel your best so that you can put one foot in front of the other.</li>
      <li>My search for a high quality hair styling product has ended and I am now a loyal and enthusiastic fan of Moroccan Oil: Hydrating styling cream!</li>
      <li>While it&#x27;s not cheap, the quality and value are excellent.  </li>
      <li>My hair was curled, and this helped smooth out my curls</li>
      <li>Correct application and amount is important.</li>
      <li>I spray lightly with the Glimmer Shine Spray and my hair</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s light and not sticky.  </li>
      <li>This product makes hair smooth and manageable.  </li>
      <li>It smooths the fly-aways and makes my hair feel silky smooth without any greasy feeling.  </li>
      <li>It is well worth the price!</li>
      <li>but well worth it!</li>
      <li>I really liked the oil, but wanted to try something new.  </li>
      <li>love the line so much I had to try the cream.</li>
      <li>only thing i don&#x27;t like is that a lot of the product gets stuck at the bottom of bottle, pump doesn&#x27;t do a good job at getting it all out.  </li>
      <li>The good news is that the dryness factor makes my hair a little stiffer,  making it a bit more manageable.</li>
      <li>Shipping was fast and clean!</li>
      <li>The first time I used it it looked like I&#x27;d just stepped out of a salon, the texture completely changed, I&#x27;d never seen my hair this soft and bouncy and shiny, not oily at all, and it smells great too.</li>
      <li>What&#x27;s nice is that I apply it to my hair in the morning, after taking a shower, and it last all day.   </li>
      <li>:) This styling cream added softness, shine, definition, soft hold and most importantly, is the only thing that has ever taken my frizz away.</li>
      <li>But I sacrific a more natural look and feel for that manageability.</li>
      <li>Well worth it.</li>
      <li>I must not be using it right?</li>
      <li>Also, if you get this product, use sparingly until you find the right amount for your hair.</li>
      <li>My hair is soft, the curls keep their shape, look healthy and the product lasts ages (my first bottle lasted almost three months).  </li>
      <li>I have unruly, coarse hair but this stuff makes my hair very easy to work with.</li>
      <li>Every time I&#x27;ve used it, my hair is really dry and kind of brittle by the end of the day.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s so easy for someone with natural curls.  </li>
      <li>First time it was used was when i was getting my hair done for an event.   </li>
      <li>I use about a dime size (I have below shoulder length hair), spread it between my hands the apply it to the ends first and then work it in to the scalp.</li>
      <li>The first time I heard about it on a magazine I wasn&#x27;t sold...since I read a lot of \\&quot;Neutral\\&quot; reviews about it here on Amazon</li>
      <li>and I began using it when the weather was still hot.  </li>
      <li>At first it seems like it will make your hair greasy</li>
      <li>This is okay, but definitely does not make my hair as shiny and healthy-looking as the oil did.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s looks &amp; feels very healthy and not frizzy or weighted down.  </li>
      <li>It worked really well the first three days I used this</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I highly recommend the Moroccan Oil styling products. A hairdresser turned me on to these products about 2 years ago and I have been using them ever since. I even got my mom hooked on it. A little goes a long way. I have straight hair to the middle of my back and I use the Oil Treatment,  Hydrating Cream and Glimmer Shine Spray everyday. The bottles last me a very long time. Using these products makes my hair stay healthy, always smooth and shiny like silk. I am always receiving compliments on my hair. My hair is very thin, so keeping it healthy is a lot of work, which people with thick hair don&#x27;t understand. Thin hair damages and breaks easily so if it is not well taken care of, including regular trims, it looks stringy and limp. I coat my hair with the oil and cream when it&#x27;s wet. I blow dry my hair and use a round boars hair bristle brush. When I&#x27;m finished drying my hair I spray lightly with the Glimmer Shine Spray and my hair looks like I went to a salon. People who don&#x27;t know me think I straighten my hair and spend hours on it, which I don&#x27;t. My hair is naturally pin-straight, and I spend 7-10 minutes tops blow drying/brushing my hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this hair product for about four months now, all throught the heat and humidity of a Florida summer, and it&#x27;s the best product I have ever used on my hair.  Even when it&#x27;s been humid I haven&#x27;t had the frizzies. So I was just thrilled to find it cheaper here than at my salon. My hair is soft, the curls keep their shape, look healthy and the product lasts ages (my first bottle lasted almost three months).  There&#x27;s no need to use a lot.  My hair is  short, it&#x27;s comes to about the top of my ears, and I use two light pumps from the dispenser then work it into my hair while it&#x27;s wet let it air dry.  I have had the best looking hair of my life using this and it&#x27;s so easy for someone with natural curls.  As a bonus it smells really great.  I&#x27;m also very sensitive to certain scents and some can affect my allergies, but I haven&#x27;t had any problems with this product.  Cheaper than the salon and it arrived quickly - perfect!</li>
    <li> while i was at the salon, i tried the mo hydrating styling cream along with the mo intense curl cream.  tried both while my hair was almost dry.  didn&#x27;t like the curl cream at all, made my hair sticky and weighted down (even though i have thick curly hair).  but i love this stuff. i especially like it on my dry hair, does wonders for frizz and flyaways.  from time to time use it on wet hair and it doesn&#x27;t have quite enough hold to set my style for my liking.  it&#x27;s light and not sticky.  only thing i don&#x27;t like is that a lot of the product gets stuck at the bottom of bottle, pump doesn&#x27;t do a good job at getting it all out.  so now i have lots of mostly empty bottles in my cabinet waiting for me to spend half a day redistributing it all into another bottle.  annoying.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I use it with a few drops of the Moroccan Oil itself, mixed in with one pump of the cream (for bra length hair) and I finish with a few more drops of the oil (after my hair is dry).  It adds a lovely shine and softness to my hair.  Having coarse Asian hair, it definitely tames it (without weighing it down) and adds a silky manageability to it.  I tried it without the oil and I&#x27;d say I would use a LITTLE more than one pump.  But if using with oil (highly recommended), I would only do one squirt.  My hair does not get greasy with this and I began using it when the weather was still hot.  So I look forward to the Winter with this product I know my hair will be better protected and hydrated with this.</li>
    <li> But..this product did not live up to the hype. It just didn&#x27;t do anything for my hair at all. Maybe it works better on thicker hair...who knows? I won&#x27;t buy this product line again.</li>
    <li> Great service from company. Received the oil and the oil is excellent. Works wonders on my hair</li>
    <li> Received Item as Described - Great Deal - Quick Shipping - Happy as can be with this purchase.  Thank you, v/r Susan</li>
    <li> The first time I heard about it on a magazine I wasn&#x27;t sold...since I read a lot of \\&quot;Neutral\\&quot; reviews about it here on Amazon but I decided to try it for myself.  My hair is curly by nature (Dominican), so I use a lot of heat, relax and flat iron it. The first time I used it it looked like I&#x27;d just stepped out of a salon, the texture completely changed, I&#x27;d never seen my hair this soft and bouncy and shiny, not oily at all, and it smells great too. I heard that it&#x27;s the same as an Argan Oil sold at Sally&#x27;s but it&#x27;s not.Use it before and after you blow dry, you can also use it in combination with their oil..IT IS WORTH EVERY PENNY!!!!!!</li>
    <li> My salon used this on my hair and I loved it.  I had to buy it to use at home.  It makes my hair thick and shiny.  It also smells great.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff and plan to buy more...  First time it was used was when i was getting my hair done for an event.   My hair was curled, and this helped smooth out my curls and it helped protect against the harsh flat iron process.  I was going to buy this at the salon, but it was double the amount.   Definitley recommend for every day use, it smells divine.</li>
    <li> Great product. I am african american with dry hair.  This cream hydrates my hair without leaving a oily residue.  I use it on my kids as well.</li>
    <li> I totally love the Moroccan Oil Hydrating Styling Cream. It truly is for ALL hairtypes. Makes my hair soft and shiny, in a good way!</li>
    <li> This product was as advertised.  It helps control my curly hair as I blow it out and adds moisture without making it greasy.</li>
    <li> Moroccan oil hair cream is another product on Instyle&#x27;s 2011 best product for curly hair.  This product has a strange smell perhaps from argan oil.  You are only supposed to use a quarter size amount yet it is not enough, but if you use too much it makes hair oily, so it&#x27;s a difficult balance to attain.  What I&#x27;ve also found is after a few uses the product does not have the same effect as it originally did.  This is another expensive hair product that I feel does not have the results it has promised.  Be weary of buying it.</li>
    <li> I have color treated thin hair and this Hydrating Styling Cream have made my hair shiner and stronger than ever! I love, love, love this product! It is concentrated so you really don&#x27;t have to use a lot. It is well worth the price!</li>
    <li> Very hydrating &amp; not too heavy. Love this product. Great for thin or thick hair. Smells awesome too.</li>
    <li> I live in colorado and have a hard time managing dry hair.  This product makes hair smooth and manageable.  I put a little on wet hair and it makes a huge difference.  Well worth it.</li>
    <li> DOES absolutely NOTHING AT ALL I have thick wavy hair and I bought this product based on the good reviews ....make stroy short ...smell good didn&#x27;t control frizz didn&#x27;t style another bottle to my collection.......booo hoooo :( there go $30 bucks</li>
    <li> I like this product as a leave in more than anything, it works well on dry hair but I prefer it on my wet hair mixed with the moroccan hair oil.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product.  Has made a big difference in my hair.  No more frizz.</li>
    <li> My hair is wavy, dry and tends to frizz. This product makes it silky and emphasizes the waves. It is the best product I have used. Correct application and amount is important. I use about a dime size (I have below shoulder length hair), spread it between my hands the apply it to the ends first and then work it in to the scalp. The second day I may add a little more to the ends but my hair looks great for about 5 days, then it is time to shampoo again.</li>
    <li> I love using this for my hair. I have a million little hairs that stick up and this stuff keeps my hair from frizzing and gives it some bounce. I don&#x27;t even have to blow dry my hair. I love it. At first it seems like it will make your hair greasy but it doesn&#x27;t. You just keep brushing your fingers in your hair and let it dry. I recommend this to everyone!</li>
    <li> This is styling cream (looks like conditioner) and it is not quite as good as the oil version.  I really liked the oil, but wanted to try something new.  This is okay, but definitely does not make my hair as shiny and healthy-looking as the oil did.  I will use up the product, but I don&#x27;t believe I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I bought this at the salon I got my hair cut at thinking this would add shine and hydration to my naturally curly thirst 3B/3C hair.  It worked really well the first three days I used this but I noticed my hair felt coated, almost like  plastic was wrapped around my hair shaft.  Then by the second week I used it my hair was really dried out and really frizzy and it had been the MO Hydrating cream that was damaging my hair.  I attribute it to the \\&quot;cones\\&quot; that are in it because the cetyl alcohol I don&#x27;t think would dry my hair as bad as it did but this product was really disappointing.  I had tried the shampoo and conditioner, the curl cream and even the oil and all of the products have been over priced and have left me disappointed.  Save your money on this because this has no properties as a leave-in conditioner at all.  It&#x27;s more or less just a cream based-lotion and you&#x27;re better off with some cheapie drug store brand.  Just look at the ingredients list.  The first four ingredients are not even natural and will damage your hair so stick to something else.  And they&#x27;re not even water soluable.  Yikes!</li>
    <li> i have been using moroccan oil &amp; the styling cream for about a month, my hair feels great. it&#x27;s looks &amp; feels very healthy and not frizzy or weighted down.  it&#x27;s a miracle treatment for your hair &amp; you don&#x27;t have to use a lot either, you just have to use a tiny drop!!</li>
    <li> I have fine/medium/wavy/color treated hair past my shoulders that I prefer to air dry. Frizz was my major complaint and anti-frizz products did nothing for me. A hair stylist told me the only thing that would work for me was a flat iron but I didn&#x27;t want to damage my hair. She also told me that this product would weigh my hair down but I just had to have it. She was SO wrong. :) This styling cream added softness, shine, definition, soft hold and most importantly, is the only thing that has ever taken my frizz away. I am finally happy with my hair.</li>
    <li> The title \\&quot;moroccan oil\\&quot; gives the impression that the product is oily or greasy on your hair, but it is not. It is a wonderful cream that smells great, and leaves my hair shiny and SOFT. I have shoulder legnth hair that is dry from frequent coloring. This product bring my hair back to life. I only use one or two \\&quot;pumps\\&quot; rub hands together and spread through lightly wet hair. Style.</li>
    <li> I have always had oily hair and thought this would be the worse product for my hair, but I was very suprised how much this made my hair very manager and healthy hair. I absoultly love this product.</li>
    <li> look at the second ingredient. its alcohal. this dries my hair out by the second day of use. i spent a lot of money on this and only used it about 4 times. bottom line, not worth it.</li>
    <li> First of all, I don&#x27;t normally write reviews and I have no relationship to this company or the health care industry. Secondly, I&#x27;m one of those people that is constantly searching for the right hair care products. I have dry / course hair and a particular challenge for me has been finding a styling product that would keep my hair feeling moist / hydrated, looking natural and provide control. I also didn&#x27;t want anything that felt greasy or left my hair stiff.  I&#x27;m so glad I ordered the Moroccan Oil hydrating styling cream![[ASIN:B0015QTA3G MOROCCAN OIL: HYDRATING STYLING CREAM FOR ALL HAIR TYPES 10.2 OZ]]   I&#x27;ve been very pleasantly surprised how well this hair care product works and how great it makes my hair looks and feel. It leaves my hair feeling soft and manageable.  It gives my hair the right amount of hydration, without feeling wet, sticky or hard. What&#x27;s nice is that I apply it to my hair in the morning, after taking a shower, and it last all day.   I&#x27;ve found that I don&#x27;t need to use a lot of the products on my hair, so the container should last for a few months.  While it&#x27;s not cheap, the quality and value are excellent.  My wife, who had expressed her dissatisfaction with other styling products I had used previously, really likes this and has started using it on her hair.  She commented how much she likes it also.  I&#x27;m surprised the hair styling centers don&#x27;t use this product and I would highly recommend this to everyone, especially if you have dry or color treated hair. Order it and give it a try.  Very impressive and immediate results.  My search for a high quality hair styling product has ended and I am now a loyal and enthusiastic fan of Moroccan Oil: Hydrating styling cream!</li>
    <li> This is good product for conditioning or regular application for dry hair.  I found it a little too heavy for daily use.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best hair product I have ever used! I have hypothyroidism which makes my hair very dry and brittle. My stylist recommended this product and it has worked wonders for me. The difference has been amazing and I have gotten so many compliments on how good my hair is looking. It makes it smooth and silky without making it flat.</li>
    <li> My hair stylist introduced me to Moroccan Oil. She put it on my hair when I had extensions to add moisture and silkiness. Well, I fell in love with this stuff. I use it now on my entire body - Yes - I use it all over on my skin and my hair! I started out by rubbing it into my hands after applying it to my hair. It felt so darn good and smelled so nice that I started using it everywhere! It feels great, very silky and light yet nicely moisturizing and not greasy AT ALL! The scent is also wonderful! I think this product should be sold as a full-body moisturizing product because it works great all over! I LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> This product is great. I have unruly, coarse hair but this stuff makes my hair very easy to work with. Better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used. Worth every cent and more!!!!</li>
    <li> I cannot live without this Moroccan Oil creame for my hair.  It smooths the fly-aways and makes my hair feel silky smooth without any greasy feeling.  I wish it weren&#x27;t quite so expensive but I will reach deep into my pockets for this one!</li>
    <li> I use the moroccan oil shampoo and conditioner, also the hairspray. love the line so much I had to try the cream. my hair is of medium thickness and on the dryer side. this cream is a god(or whoever)send. it is light and doesn&#x27;t make my hair weighed down or greasy. it also gives me peace of mind knowing it is hydrating while styling. love it- would recommend it to all hair types, it is THAT amazing. long live Moroccan oil!</li>
    <li> I have terminal cancer. It is difficult to deal with all the physical and mental changes. I purchased the shampoo,conditioner hair serum &amp; the hydrating stying cream. I am not sure if it is one product or the combination but I love it. My hair smells great and feels great-it gets rid of the medication smell. The last thing you want are the physical signs of cancer. As vain as it sounds, \\&quot;a womens hair is her shining glory\\&quot;. With cancer, it helps you to feel your best so that you can put one foot in front of the other. I don&#x27;t normally write reviews but I had to on this.</li>
    <li> I am sorry to say that I am not blown away with this product. I have used it about 3 times on my hair and I don&#x27;t like the way my hair feels afterwards. It has a greasy kind of feeling. I must not be using it right? I think I will have to work with it to figure out the right amount for my thick, coarse hair. I may just use it as a lotion on my skin instead. Not worth the money in my opinion.</li>
    <li> i have dry damaged hair from chemical burns from a salon as well as recovering from balding patches from a glued in weave.  i have been working with my hair and have gone completely natural however the hair and scalp are still noticibly dry and damaged.  i tried a sample in regis and had to go back and buy this product.  my hair felt batter instantly after the cream was applied.  the cream breather life into my lifeless dry patchy hair.  you now can not even see the patches.  it smells great and i will continue to by this.  im kicking all other haor supplies aside[[ASIN:B0015QTA3G MOROCCAN OIL: HYDRATING STYLING CREAM FOR ALL HAIR TYPES 10.2 OZ]]</li>
    <li> My hair is very dry, highlighted, bleached.....this product brings new life back to my hair!  I will continue to use this product.  Additionally, it smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> This product makes it easy and faster to blow dry my hair, its a must try for those of you who have a hard time blow drying your hair! .... Shipping was fast and clean!</li>
    <li> I and my daughter are addicted to this product!  Moisturizes hair and the smell is wonderful!  You can put in wet hair and style as normal or after flat ironing I put some in and leaves my hair frizze free and smelling great.  Pricey but well worth it!</li>
    <li> Este producto es uno de los mejores que he probado. Me ayuda a peinar el pelo aun estando mojado o seco. Realmente me encanta y lo seguiré comprando.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to everyone. It smells fantastic and it is not greasy or heavy so it does not weigh down my fine hair.</li>
    <li> I have been using moroccaan oil for a very long time and thought I&#x27;d try something different. This product left my hair feeling so soft and managable that i cant stop touching it.  Its very light and does not leave your hair feeling  greasy like the oil.  The only down side is it does have a very strong fragrance that may be bothersome. I also feel like the oil does a better job with frizzy split ends so after this I will return to the oil.</li>
    <li> i have very thin, curly and very processed hair, when its wet it can brake super easy and this leave in makes it easy to comb when its wet, the smell is definitely one of the best and once my hair is dry, i feels soft.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser used this on my hair and I had to get a bottle of my own. Good item for the price. Makes my color-treated hair soft and silky.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed in this product. Based on what I&#x27;d read about it, I was expecting a very hydrating leave-in conditioner that gave my hair softness and shine. It actually dries my hair out. Every time I&#x27;ve used it, my hair is really dry and kind of brittle by the end of the day. The good news is that the dryness factor makes my hair a little stiffer,  making it a bit more manageable. But I sacrific a more natural look and feel for that manageability. Also, if you get this product, use sparingly until you find the right amount for your hair. Too much and it will completely weigh your hair down and leave it somewhat goopy and sticky. My bottom line: This product doesn&#x27;t live up to the hype and is in no way worth the money.</li>
    <li> I have super thick, super coarse hair.  This is the only styling cream that I have found to tame my unruly hair.  Definitely adds shine and definition!  I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of Moroccan oil.  So after running out of the moroccan oil I was using,  I ordered this cream instead of oil.  Same scent but this creamy version leaves residue similar to dandruff after it dries.  Beware..</li>
    <li> I am a level 10 platinum and retouch every 2-3 weeks.This product helps put some life back into my hair while giving it a really firm hold with tons of movement. It also smells heavenly.</li>
