<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My husband says that these work great and last a long time.</li>
    <li> Perfect, fits very well, and the new one it&#x27;s better than firts blade that came with my BodyGroom.</li>
    <li> Not sized correctly, falls out of the Bodygroom.  The whole Bodygroomthing pretty much sucks.  Steer clear.</li>
    <li> Works better than the original foil, and absolutely works on model BG2028.</li>
    <li> Perfect....just what I was looking for. Was very difficult to find these in the store.  Amazon is a great tool for purchasing products online.</li>
    <li> Thank goodness thier availible!I would hate to have to replace the whole razor.When the first screen popped a hole I thought it was done for.</li>
    <li> Expensive replacements but with proper care should last a long time.</li>
    <li> Good price.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Cuts just as well if not better than the original that came installed on the razor.</li>
    <li> This is more a review of the whole Bodygroomer from Philips than just the shaver foil. There is nothing wrong this this shaver foil replacement. I think its great that I can buy it to replace the old broken one. But I have to say that the Philips Norelco Bodygroomer system is just too unreliable when it comes to the shaver foils. May be its just the model that I have (BG2020) but the shaver keeps popping out of the groomer all the time. And its way too delicate. Everytime it falls on a hard surface like my bathroom floor, it breaks or the foil pops out or gets cut or gets a hole in the middle which means that it is useless after that. I have had to replace a shaver foil four times in six months! I am not sure if thats supposed to be the average. I mean what kind of reliability or quality or robustness is that for a product. Otherwise, this replacement shaver foil is good. Its a genuine product and I am glad I can buy. I just think Philips is making money off making a bad quality groomer that requires a replacement foil every month.</li>
    <li> Much better than what it came with originally. Sounds different, but works better...and hopefully longer!</li>
    <li> Fits perfect and came as advertised, but sometimes it pops off the razor, which is a little annoying.</li>
    <li> A little bit pricey in my opinion, but necessary if you use a Norelco BodyGroomer often.  Still cheaper than blades!</li>
    <li> Really good product just one little inconvenient it requires special liquid for cleaning other wise it will get oxidation from water.</li>
    <li> Bought these replacement blades for my friend in Brazil since he said that his blades were not functioning properly after using them for several times...</li>
    <li> These work well, and you just have to buy them.  The foils get bent or dinged, or just get dull over time, so you need these.  It sucks that they don&#x27;t last longer, but paying for a replacement is better than getting those irritated red bumps or ingrown hairs.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad I don&#x27;t have to buy a whole new machine, which would be so wasteful! I hope they will not lower the quality on your replacement foils.</li>
    <li> I like it because it doesn&#x27;t give me the razor burn I get with my face razor. Works great as long as you keep the hair short and the replacement really made a difference in performance.</li>
    <li> This replacement head would not remain in place while shaving, falling out continually. Fortunately I still have the original head and only needed the foil. I used the new plastic piece with the original head which remains in place while shaving. This avoids the time and hassle of an exchange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This replacement head lists my Bodygroom BG2020 as compatible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps I simply received the defective one of a batch?</li>
    <li> The problem I had before, which is what prompted me to purchase the replacement foil, was that when I use the Bodygroomer on certain parts of the body it tended to snag and the foil would fall off. I attributed this problem as wear and tear on the foil, but after just buying the new foil the problem still persists. This can be very aggrivating, especially if you shave over the toilet! Granted, I realize that I may be pressing down too hard on my skin with the Groomer, yet I still rate the Bodygroomer good, just not great - which is what their website indicates.</li>
    <li> Great quality! Works even better than the original which comes with the bodygroomer!</li>
    <li> My testies have never felt smoother. My old blade started knicking the bottom which caused excessive bleeding. I&#x27;ll never go this long without replacing the blade, definitely better than the one that came with the bodygroom</li>
    <li> My 22 year old son is the owner of the referenced trimmer/shaver. He LOVES this shaver. He originally dropped his trimmer &amp; got a huge hole in the Foil. Hence, the reason for the purchase of the replacement foil</li>
    <li> got this this and was trimming with it and shaver always gets stuck on my hair and falls out. thinking of getting a new trimmer altogether</li>
    <li> This was a good purchase and I really enjoy using the product. I should have bought two of them at the same time.</li>
    <li> Delivery was on time. Trimmer is now good to go for another year! This foil is pretty sharp and gives even a close shave to the face if you prefer!</li>
    <li> This replacement foil is a THOUSAND times better than the stock one it comes with! Seriously, closest shave EVER. I absolutely love it! Buy this item and you won&#x27;t be disappointed!!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem as smooth as the original foil that came with the razor. but gets the job done</li>
    <li> With that being said we as men need to do well for our female counterparts and get into a regular \\&quot;grooming\\&quot; habit. I&#x27;ve been using this bodygroomer/foil for years now and love it. It almost seems as though the quality has actually gotten better as well. No pinch, closest thing to shaving full body without as much mess, less time, and can be used in water or as I prefer with fresh out of shower dry skin. 2012 gentlemen...2012. Shell thank you.</li>
    <li> Shipping was amazingly fast! My issue is with the razor. It is not the same quality as the original that came with my body groomer. It does not shave as close. It will work but I am not blown away by it.</li>
    <li> Bought a &amp;#34;Philips Norelco BG2028/42 Bodygroom 3100&amp;#34; from Amazon. After a while, the parts in the foil came apart and rattled around too much. Bought this replacement and now it works as good as new.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a replacement for my barely used $60 body groomer.  That foil was horrible.  It took for or five passes and then your skin looked like Freddy Kruger had a crack at you.  This version is much improved, but doesn&#x27;t cut as close as the original.  They still haven&#x27;t found the proper smooth/trim medium here.  My other complaint is the tissue paper thin foil is almost impossible to touch when installing and moving for cleaning.  I bent my previous one this way.</li>
    <li> It is a great product at a fair price. Amazon has the best price for it.</li>
    <li> After seeing that this was the cheaper of the few, I was kinda skeptical about the quality. Well after installing the shaver foil and going to town, I believe that it is actually BETTER than the one that came with the unit. Awesome!</li>
    <li> The razor lasts about a year and does not do a very good job, I am on my third one.  The heads do a poor job and last only three or four times of use.  There must be something better on the market.</li>
    <li> great product, it arrived on time and it was ready for use.</li>
    <li> Able to get them much less expensively from Amazon and came very quickly when ordered.</li>
    <li> I keep buying them because they work.  Too bad you can&#x27;t find them in the stores.</li>
    <li> This item works great! It was easily found and purchased on Amazon.com for the right price.</li>
    <li> This is a great replacement blade.  I think it is actually better than the blade that came with it... Not sure to what extent but I can tell a small increase in quality.  Plus for the price, it was a sure thing.  Def. recommend this to people considering buying a new blade to replace their worn out one or to replace the one that fell down the drain (like yours truely) lol.. :)</li>
    <li> When I put this in my shaver, it was a noticeably loose fit compared to the stock shaver/foil.&lt;br /&gt;Also, this is an absurdly expensive little piece of metal. Shame on Philips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it works great, and seems gentler on my skin than the stock foil (probably because the stock one was worn out).</li>
    <li> I mean, there&#x27;s no bid thing. I&#x27;m just getting my stuff refilled. My shaver wasn&#x27;t broken so ya, no probs...</li>
    <li> Fits perfectly. Like many said, better than the original.</li>
    <li> Good replacement razor for the body groom. Better than the one that comes originally installed.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price on a necessity!</li>
    <li> Does what I need it to do, the last one went for a little under a year. Not bad for the price.</li>
    <li> the new revision seems to have a smaller foil section. It is working quieter, but I did prefer the older models better</li>
    <li> i love this thing it&#x27;s prolly one of the inventions ever haha... amazon was the only place i could find it the cheapest for replacements.</li>
    <li> i bought one a while ago. it wasn&#x27;t form phillips and norelco and boy it was of bad quality. always buy original on these things. This one cut like a charm and won&#x27;t harm my skin like the bootleg one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this particular Bodygroom shaver for well over two years and I am completely satisfied. Obviously the foil has (and that&#x27;s what these are for) to be replaced every year but that&#x27;s not a problem. If charged and used properly it will not give you any problems. I am very happy with my choice of Bodygroomer.</li>
    <li> Title says it all.  When this arrived in the mail, I popped out my old foil, snapped in my new one, and kept on trimmin&#x27;.  No issues whatsoever.</li>
    <li> This product was a great replacement for my bodygroomer. The blade seems to be better out of the box than the original blade was when new. Would definitely purchase again for a close comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> The manufacturer recommendation is to replace the trimmer/shaver foil once a year.  Yikes, I replace mine every 3 months, don&#x27;t want dull blades or damaged foil anywhear near my \\&quot;boys\\&quot;.  This is very thin foil so make sure to inspect it often, don&#x27;t want any jagged edges \\&quot;down there\\&quot; either.  Anyway, this is a review for the replacement cutter and not the trimmer itself.  So I, and \\&quot;the Boys\\&quot;, are very happy with this.</li>
    <li> My original head lasted three years before it fell apart. Was still shaving ok at the end. The new one is much closer shaver.     The trimmer itself no longer holds the head in place securely. I put a strip of electrical tape on the plastic tabs in the trimmer which works well.</li>
    <li> Item very hard to find locally, went to Amazon and lots of them to choose from.  Received it quickly.</li>
    <li> Works great for it&#x27;s intended purpose. I couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
    <li> This is great! I destroyed my last cartridge and didn&#x27;t realize I could buy a replacement. It works wonders.</li>
    <li> nice item it works really good</li>
    <li> Love my bodygroom.  Love it even more that you can so easily replace shaving head!</li>
    <li> This is a replacement to the bodygroom machine  Nice product but the head is the weakest piece. It has an aluminum foil grid that get stuck with hair if you take care and proceed gently it will last longer. But in the end you will have to replace the head sooner or later.    Great product though !</li>
    <li> When I first bought the philips norelco bodygroom I was ecstatic at how easy it was to use, then the shaver foil broke.  I purchased a new one reading reviews that it&#x27;s even better than the original.  I installed it and tried to trim my body hair.  I would have to disagree that it was doing a better job than the original foil.  It works, but it takes twice as long now as it used to with the original foil.  It may just be my hair because it&#x27;s really course, but the shaver worked fine before I replaced the shaver foil.  It&#x27;s gotten to a point that I rarely use it at all now.  Just FYI, this is shaving with a guard on.  It works great without a guard on, but not everyone likes to go \\&quot;bald\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> Came as shown and fit perfectly</li>
    <li> I bought this blade due to the fact that my old one kept poping out during shaving. After reading the reviews it looked like replacing the blade would get rid of my problem. Guess what? I wasted my money. After installing I started shaving and five minutes later the blade was poping out. Time to get a new body groomer, but I will Never get another Norelco!!!</li>
    <li> We must have gotten the epilady version on accident.  This thing doesn&#x27;t trim the hair.  It pulls it out.  I&#x27;m going to order another one and hope this product hasn&#x27;t gone down hill.  The original blade was fantastic for over a year.  Perhaps this was a fluke.</li>
    <li> Fits perfectly in the device, works just like I remember it! The hypoallergenic foil and the close proximity of the blades definitely gives you a close, almost razor-smooth shave as advertised. I was concerned when I opened the package that this was a new head from the type of groomer I owned. It&#x27;s been two years since I had a working head, but I was pleasantly surprised when the razor head popped right in perfectly, just like the last.</li>
    <li> the norelco body groom is a great product. i&#x27;ve owned it for almost 5 years and used the shaver foil till it fell apart, literally. The only bad thing is that i couldn&#x27;t find a replacement foil at target,walmart, or best buy where i bought it. Fortunately, amazon had it. replaced the foil which took about 2 seconds and it works like new again!</li>
    <li> Snapped right into my Philips Norelco BG2030 Professional BodyGrooming System.  My previous one&#x27;s foil tore, but it was old, and it says to get replaced every 6 months.</li>
    <li> Item does the job but is fragile...unexpectedly a hole will develope in foil with unpleasant results. Note: have replacements on hand.</li>
    <li> I can confirm that it works with the BG2020</li>
    <li> Replacement blade works as intended. As many have said, it seems to work even better than the original. Have used a handful of times already with no problems. Came in about 5 business days.</li>
    <li> Good as always. This name does not need any intro but I found here so good price on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This replacement blade works for my body groomer.  The groomer itself was around $40, so why almost $15 for a replacement blade?  Seems like they got the idea from printer manufacturers to sell the product cheap and charge alot for the consumables they use.  Ugh.</li>
    <li> This is the 3rd replacement head I bought for the Phillips Body Groom 2020. They all just don&#x27;t fit as snug as when you buy a complete new unit. Does it cut and all, sure. But many times the head will pop out when you are using it. And for nearly 1/2 the price of the full unit itself, it&#x27;s tough to keep justifying replacing the heads rather than just buying a new unit where you constantly aren&#x27;t having the shaver part pop it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the Norelco Bodygroom for 2 or 3 years now, but it&#x27;s been sitting dormant on a shelf for at least the past year. I needed the replacement trimmer/shaver foil, which for some reason wasn&#x27;t being carried in stores any longer.  When I first checked on line the part was either really expensive or on back order, etc.  Eventually I just stopped looking or checked randomly here and there.  I was thrilled that Amazon had the replacement, it was in stock, a great deal on the price so I bought 2, and it was just so simple to purchase through them.  To top all that, I received my order in 3 days! What results!!! I&#x27;m back in business and very neatly groomed once again!  Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> ive used body groomer for couple years and geting replacement heads was always a hastle. until now. i ordered 2 at the same cost of 1 at my FORMER supplier, plus i get a order every 2 months without getting online. its shipped automaticly.  thanks</li>
    <li> I just ordered one since i found it in amazon, I have BG2020 and the trimmer is broken, it is the original trimmer and it&#x27;s good as the old one i got with the device.&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;my opinion is to use the shaver foil carefully because it has a weak design\\&quot;</li>
    <li> The part was fairly priced and shipped very quickly from the supplier.  I am completely satisfied with the part and the service and would shop there again.</li>
    <li> I was looking for one of these forever. I finally found it and darn does it work nicely. Thanks! I&#x27;ve only had to buy 2 every year.</li>
    <li> Everyone who has this body groomer should have an extra shaving head on hand.  It makes the body groomer work like new.</li>
    <li> UPDATE AUG 2014&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently I wrote a rave review in 2009.  Well aug 2014 a crazy one day sale price got me to buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SURPRISINGLY there has been a lost of design updates (I can only tell from the exterior appearance, but I am sure the inner working have been updated as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite my 2009 rave review ... It pales in comparison to how much EVEN better the replacement cartridge is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Non-sale price seems a bit high to me.  but look for a sale, and jump on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much smoother trim and less tugging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also fits more snugly into the trimmer and I doubt it will fall out as easily as the past version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THANKS AMAZON!</li>
    <li> does the job. no manual razor touches my face (except the barber shop, of course). i know i should buy another pack but i;m lazy so i will wait.</li>
    <li> It had been about 2 years since I purchased my Philips Norelco Shaver.  I thought that it was a titanium foil which never gets dull, but after replacing the foil, I know that this is not true.  Do yourself a favor and replace the foil at least once a year.  After a while, you forget about how smooth and easy the morning shave is until you have a fresh foil.  This product arrived in the original manufacturers box and snapped right in.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Philps Bodygroom for a number of years now. I am actually on my second one after the first one wore out after a long life. I was ready to upgrade to the newer one anyway. They trim so well, and the heads only need to be replaced every 6 months or so with regular use. Amazon is the easiest place to get them, and also at the best price!</li>
    <li> Sharper and smoother shave than the original blade.</li>
    <li> the thing works great...but for a short time...the foil is substandard or something ...within two uses it has a crack n puckered out...causes scratch marks on skin...i wonder how they cudnt manufacture something more lasting n durable...&lt;br /&gt;also it tends to snap out while in use...can u believe that...not even a decent lock in mechanism...whush...wudnt buy this thing again n wudnt gift this to anyone for sure...</li>
    <li> These make your body groom new again.  If you are in Canada you are apparently expected to buy the whole appliance, as the replacement foils are pretty darn scarce and expensive.  Next visit to the US, buy them and take them over the border.  N.</li>
    <li> Yes, I just purchased the replacement foil, and haven&#x27;t had to use it yet...but...it&#x27;s for the Philips Body-Groomer BG2040, which I purchased over six months ago... and it&#x27;s the same foil...that,  I&#x27;ve been using for the last six months...and it&#x27;s the same foil on that one....so,  of course..??!!  lol  Really, I think it&#x27;s a great type of foil, which works great on sensitive skin, and shaves close for me anyway!!!  I highly recommend it so far...  Thanks Amazon &amp; Philips-Norelco</li>
    <li> My original shaver foil broke and I bought the replacement, it works exactly as the original for a very good price.</li>
    <li> I finally found a replacement. My Bodygroom is like brand new again. For a while I take it Phillips had to stop manufacturing replacement trimmer foil&#x27;s because I could not find them locally at any retailers or online but Amazon had them and I am back in buisness again.</li>
    <li> as usual product  performed admirably.</li>
    <li> Quick shipping. Product as described.</li>
    <li> This is great product. There was one small issue it took a long time to receive the product through the mail. Although I have used the free shipping before it it has never taken two weeks to receive an item. The product itself is great.</li>
    <li> Although the product does perform well, its useful life is only about 6 months so be prepared to keep dropping $30+ a year if you continue to use the groomer.</li>
    <li> Not happy at all. Barely used the product and the screen is already ripped. Now I cant shave for a couple days without scratching up my face and I have to shave everyday for work.</li>
    <li> Very good - a solid 4* - hubby likes it a lot - not 5* but definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Delivered fast.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got the Body Groomer BG2030 and this replacement foil fit it perfectly.  It also has a much nicer feel to it.  The grill surface is smoother and never pinches.  The original part did a good enough shave, but for some reason, the grill was not as smooth and would tend to feel like it was scraping at times.  This replacement product really improved my satisfaction with the Body Groomer product overall.  I will be ordering more of these while they are still available.  What is up with stores not stocking replacement parts any more?  If it wasn&#x27;t for Amazon I don&#x27;t where I&#x27;d find these kinds of things at such great prices. If you have the BG2030, this is a great find, as it&#x27;s a perfect fit and feels like a product upgrade.</li>
    <li> I am over all very satisfied with the price and quality of this product. I was finding it hard to get the spare blade for my Norelco Body Groomer ( after I lost the original one) and where ever it was available, it was way too costly. So this was the best deal for me, original product on a reasonable price. The only glitch I am finding is that some times I feel that the blade is somewhat loose and will fell down with a strong jerk but this may be just my doubt otherwise a very good product.</li>
    <li> The replacement blade is a lot better than the original blade that came with the razor.  I recommend getting a replacement blade if you are purchasing the bodygroom and try both of them.  The new blade did not bind up in sensitive areas like the old blade.</li>
    <li> I am not rating this product as 5 start as it is not something exceptional. Its too like all other products available in market with different vendors having an edge over them. Good part is that it will give you fewer itches in shave than other products in same price range. I love this product along with machine because of it&#x27;s ease of use and I can switch it readily to a trimmer.  It does what it claims to do.</li>
    <li> Cheap and they work, they were slightly smaller than the original and easier to fall out but they do work great.</li>
    <li> Not much to say about this product, other than it is  great and it works perfectly, it arrived super fast</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s the best grooming device I ever had. That&#x27;s the second head I got. It lasts for around a year which is pretty good deal</li>
    <li> Was hoping that this replacement foil would work in my boyfriend&#x27;s Bodygroom - nope, doesn&#x27;t work.  Sadly will have to cancel subscription.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve shopped around quite a bit for these, and this is the best price I can find.  If you&#x27;ve used the Norelco body grooming line of products, you know these things last for a while.  I think it recommends replacing the head once a year, but I find that I need to do it a little more often.  Overall, great product for a great price.</li>
    <li> This item is necessary for my razor and I am glad for amazon and their great prices.</li>
    <li> I looked at Walmart, Walgreens, CVS, and all grocery stores to find the replacement foil for my razor. Everything under the planet but these. I was just about to either buy the razor again or just buy one that does have replacement blades and finally found it here!! Thank you for having it!!</li>
    <li> I had expected. large parts</li>
    <li> Well, the only thing I can say, is that its way lot cheaper than the BG2020 replacement, but it fits the same as some other people have suggested.    You might want to check out my review on the BG2020:    http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EG8HLE/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_rev_prod_title</li>
    <li> Was right product as described</li>
    <li> I accidentally ordered this thinking I was ordering replacement foil for the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, I ended up replacing my entire Bodygroom system because the rechargeable battery died and the battery was more expensive to replace than an entire unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, you shouldn&#x27;t have to replace the trimmer head unless you are getting some pretty heavy use on the Bodygroom, but you should replace the foil on the trimmer head every 6 months or so.</li>
    <li> changing the blade head on my shaver was long overdue &amp; I was happy to find what I needed on Amazon. no more hair pulling.</li>
    <li> I have 2 foil-head shavers  that do fine on my face but not as well on my neck and underside of the jaw.  I also have a rotary-head Phiips Norelco YS524 that I don&#x27;t shave with because the foil-head shavers do my face better.  However, I use the snap-on  Philips Norelco Bodygroom trimmer that cane with the YS524 very frequently because it does a much better job on my neck and the underside of the jaw than any other razor I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For example, I frequently don&#x27;t shave on Sunday  so the hair on my neck and the underside of the jaw is rather long by Monday morning.  It seems the older I have become the faster the hair on my neck grows (though not on the top of my head) and the harder to shave it gets.  The foil head razors just slide over the neck hair it seems, but the bodygroom trimmer snapped onto the YS524 mows it down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not want to be without this attachment.  It is the best thing I have found to keep me reasonably clean shaven on the neck, jawline, and underside of the jaw.</li>
    <li> Just what I need. Works great and great delivery time</li>
    <li> didnt fit as snug but it worked okay it did the job I thought it would have been shaper but eh</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this replacement head for my BG2020 model.  I also believe, like others have already stated, that this blade is much better then the origninal head that came with the bodygroom shaver.  It cuts smooth and close and is made by  Norelco.  The price is also very reasonable and I will definitely buy more of these for future use.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I have replaced whole razors in the past just because of the heads, these work great and are a lot cheaper than a new razor</li>
    <li> Great choice. No problems so far.</li>
    <li> Ordered this replacement for my bodygroom and I was disappointed to see that it does not remove the hair as easy and smooth as the original piece. Expected this to be just as good or better as it is an OEM replacement piece.</li>
    <li> Doesnt stay in. In all fairness, from what I&#x27;ve read, the problem seems to be with the shaving unit itself.</li>
    <li> This was delivered pretty quick. I&#x27;d been looking for this replacement at all the stores that I could think of and didn&#x27;t find it. Turned to Amazon and of course they had it ... and at a good price. I read the reviews before purchasing it and quite a few people remarked how much better the replacement was to the original one that came with the Bodygroom, so that&#x27;s what I was expecting. So, I&#x27;m a little disappointed to say that when I got the replacement and tried it out, it was about the same as the original ... no better ... no worse.  I didn&#x27;t get a closer or better shave.  Still, I really like using the Bodygroom and getting the replacement at such a good price is great.</li>
    <li> Not long after I had purchased it it failed to last  the foil started to gave out and started to self dis trucked</li>
    <li> I had ordered this product because the blades that came with the shaver didn&#x27;t last long and I couldn&#x27;t find them in stores in my town anywhere. These blades last much longer than the blades that come with the shaves. My order arrived when it was supposed to and I was totally happy with the speed they got to me so now I&#x27;m ordering more.</li>
    <li> Had to order it after the original one that came with the Philips Norelco broke. A small bit of the foil came undone when it arrived, but I managed to fix it and got it working fine, but just make sure to check it&#x27;s condition if you get one.</li>
    <li> the best philips i like it</li>
    <li> but that the replacement heads have worked great.    Given the heads are for the BodyGroom, which comes in contact with some intimate areas, this shave head is very sensitive and does not catch any skin whatsoever while doing its job.</li>
    <li> Like everyone else says, works better than the stock blade it comes with. I reluctantly ordered this blade because it says BG2000, and mine is a BG2020, but the box it comes in says it&#x27;s compatible with models ranging from BG2020 to 2029, so aside from the weird naming scheme, this thing is great.</li>
    <li> So i bought this two pack - and we all know the \\&quot;replacement blades\\&quot; or what ever is like the same gimick as printer ink... more expensive than the printer.  -&lt;br /&gt;anyway  - i bought these because the one I had kept popping out.  turns out its not on the cartridge side.. its on the body groomer itself, the little plastic prongs dont hold in the blades for me.</li>
    <li> Better than the original blade</li>
    <li> I have a 2040 and needed to replace the foil after a couple years. You can buy this foil anywhere, but I already have prime so it was a great deal for me.</li>
    <li> The second replacement that I have purchased. Works great and have had the body groomer for 5 years and still only needed to replace the blades twice. That&#x27;s good in my book.</li>
    <li> I love my bodygroom trimmer, but these foils are it&#x27;s Achilles heel. It makes it like a new trimmer, but the foil over the trimmer head tends to come loose over time, and this particular replacement has popped out of the trimmer several times while I was using it, leaving me to try and find where it fell. Some design improvements would be appreciated</li>
    <li> This is a decent razor, but definitely not the best in the market. The top and bottom cutters give a close shave but the foil is not precise enough. I bought it just a month ago and its going fine  for me, so I can&#x27;t really comment on the lifetime of the product (Most people have said, it goes for around a year). You are not looking for  a close shave, just a trimmer, this  is a good one.</li>
    <li> i have been using the shaver now for a while and i noticed one thing right off the bat.  The shaving head foil is very weak and you shold be very careful with it or it can get pushed into the shaver. that doesnt bother me to much cause i use it with a gaurd on it anyway.  i thought i was needing an new head so i got one and reliezed that really all i needed was to charge the shaver after every use...i needed one anyway cause the foil was pushed inside it</li>
    <li> The replacement blades for my Philips Norelco BodyGroom BG 200 restored the Groomer to like new quality.  The price of the replacement blades and foil assembly   were very reasonable. I would recommend this product to anyone needing replacement parts for their Philips Norelco BodyGroomer. I received the product in a timely  manner and the transaction was done in a professional manner.</li>
    <li> I love this shaver... replacement blades work great....clean, close and no cuts</li>
    <li> I have never had any issues with this product and am a subscriber to having one delivered every six months. I&#x27;m sure there are probably newer models (Bodygroom Trimmer) but I&#x27;m happy with the one I have and these blades.</li>
    <li> The foil on my body groomer got a hole in it so I needed a replacement.  Instead of buying the 30+ dollar one from Walmart I tried this one.  I was a little unsure if it would fit my model, but if your razor looks like it has this blade, it will most likely work.  Some say it works better than the OEM blade, but I don&#x27;t see a different.  It does work just as well as the original though, so have no reserves there!  I plan on getting a few for replacements now that I see the price and know it works!</li>
    <li> It worked well for awhile, but it was cheaply made and not as good as the original. It ended up falling out of the shaver all the time. I was disappointed in that.</li>
    <li> While I like the Bodygroom, once the trimmer/shaver foil goes bad, it is time to replace the complete body groom. The replacement trimmer/shaver foil was a waste. Once you apply pressure, it jumps out of the groomer.</li>
    <li> I bought the replacement trimmer/shaver foil on May 1 (received it about May 7).  It won&#x27;t stay in the shaver...falls right out.  Not worth anything, much less the $20 I spent on it.</li>
    <li> The stock blade served it&#x27;s purpose fairly well, but did not hold up long-term. Straight out of the box this foil performs superior to the stock blade in every way &amp; I am hoping it will last longer as well. Overall a great purchase.</li>
    <li> This replacement head seems to have a wider cutting head than the original head that came with the shaver.  Hopefully that will help it not to rare through the foil.</li>
    <li> Within the first 2 weeks of owning the shaver, I had to replace the foil. This is because the head falls off if you&#x27;re not careful and can damage the foil. When it works, it works good (much better and closer shave than clippers), just don&#x27;t let the head fall off and damage the foil.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t fit the model I had so I just ended up getting one that uses a regular shave cartage.</li>
    <li> Get this spare in hand if you use the Bodygroom 7100 regularly.</li>
    <li> as i have read in other reviews, I also find the replacement blade does a better job than the one that came with it when I first bought the shaver.</li>
    <li> Would be nice not to need an exacto-blade to cut out the foil. The perforated lines didn&#x27;t work at all. I appreciate that you still offer the foil that fits my razor. I like my model, and you are helping me keep it working as good as new. Thanks.</li>
    <li> it works fine, exactly what I needed to trim the hair.... so I bought it here, good cost and value</li>
    <li> It pulls my boyfriends hair. I must have gotten a lemon because the one previous worked great! I am not happy with this purchase..</li>
    <li> I was happy to find a replacement since it&#x27;s not found in stores in North Carolina. I loved that I received it quickly.</li>
    <li> Weeks ago my Philips Norelco Bodygroom&#x27;s trimmer/shaver foil became far too dull. My pubis was far too hirsute, you see, even when using the Philips Norelco Bodygroom!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This replacement has been a miracle, fallen to me from Heaven.</li>
    <li> I love this product because I have sensitive skin and it allows me to stay smooth without the razor burn that disposables give you.</li>
    <li> My old one was starting to get really dull and not cutting right, so after getting this one, all is well again.  Cuts really smooth and I don&#x27;t have to run over the same place multiple times.  I&#x27;d recommend it for bodygroom users.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin and gives a smooth skin. all that I need. each one for me lasts about 8 months</li>
    <li> I have been a very satisfied customer of the Norelco Bodygroom and have purchased numerous replacement foils over the past years to great satisfaction.  However I was very disappointed with my latest order.  They looked cheap once I took them out of the packaging and broke on initial usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am purchasing the more expensive version to see if there is any difference.</li>
    <li> It was very good and it did everything I needed it to do. It was sharp and fit on my body groomer</li>
    <li> Screen break easily already on #5</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know that the shaver needed replacement shaver foils. After replacing it, this worked so much better! I was thrilled and the price was right too!</li>
    <li> These blades are awesome. The replacement blades are better than the original ones they came with. They fit the model I have perfectly. It says what models it fits right on the box.</li>
    <li> I rated this product at 3 stars because the foil seems to never stay in the place. Each one that I have bought seems to have the foil tear or comes undone and can never get it to fit perfectly. The product still does the job but the foil can cut you if you replace it immediatly when it is torn.</li>
    <li> Great Product Thank You</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a Bodygroom razor for years. About once a year the head becomes noticeably dull (pulling sensation). This is my second replacement. It takes a second to install.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WARNING - The design of this head is different from previous ones. It fits on my razor and works well. However, none of the comb heads that came with the razor will work with this new design. Fortunately, Norelco includes a comb with the replacement. This is the shortest comb. The longer ones that come with older razors won&#x27;t work any longer. This isn&#x27;t a problem for me. I only use the shorter one (or no comb at all), but if you use those longer combs, this new head will not hold them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure when Norelco made this change. If you bought your razor after the design was revised, then your combs will fit. Otherwise, like mine, they won&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I bought 4 of these based on previous reviews, since I travel frequently.  My original foil was damaged in transit.  The replacement is better than the original that came with the shaver!</li>
    <li> I had one replacement foil fail very quickly. Edge inserts were separating.  Seemed as if it didn&#x27;t fit as securely as the one on the original unit.  So far no problems with head #3, however it&#x27;s only been used once.</li>
    <li> I could not find this replacement foil anywhere in the store and was happily surprized to find it so easily at such a low cost on Amazon.  I received my order three days after placing it and have been very satisfied.</li>
    <li> This replacement foil is much better than the one that came with the orignal razor.</li>
    <li> I ordered this replacement head after my original head became dull after a year. This one fits into the bodygroom but it&#x27;s not as tight and it&#x27;s definitely different than the original head. This one falls out easily when I shake out my bodygroom. Does the job, but the original was so much better.</li>
    <li> good product as described fast delivery</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. Fits its designed purpose.</li>
    <li> Since I live in Brazil, I bought 2 replacement trimmers and sent them to a hotel in San Francisco, where my folks were on vacation. But they have the same old problem: they come off easily. Considering a Philips stuff something more robust was expected.</li>
    <li> Received the norelco blade, put it in place and it&#x27;s been working great.  Some advice, don&#x27;t drop it and then step on it like i did.  The blade pops out and it breaks easily.</li>
    <li> This definitely \\&quot;clicks\\&quot; into the trimmer, as it should, but it falls out when met with the slightest resistance. When it does fall, if it hits your shower floor, you&#x27;ll need to spend a few seconds reassembling it. Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> It is exactly what it says it is and it trims my gardener snake grass the way my lady likes it.</li>
    <li> Though the manufacturer claims that the head trimmer/foil never needs to be oiled, they fail to mention that the head must be replaced on a periodic basis.  To date, I am having to change the head about every 3 months, which happens to be much more expensive than simply oiling.</li>
    <li> This is excellent.  I didn´t find this in stores, but here was much more cheaper than other webpages.    I recommend this product to everyone who has a norelco bodygroom shaver</li>
    <li> The new shaver head is better and stronger than the original. It shaves closer and with less effort. It arrived in just a few days from stock. Thank you very much.</li>
    <li> This replacement shave head for the Phlilps/Norelco Bodygroom shaver is far superior to the one that came with the razor. The original had a rather flimsy foil that warped out of shape with normal use, refused to stay in place on the head and kept popping loose at either end.      The new replacement head is better made:  the shave foil itself is of a superior weight and thickness and stays in place within the head.  It also has a better array in the shaving &#x27;grid&#x27; to do a more thorough - and comfortable job of hair removal.    My only complaint is that the entire head unit doesn&#x27;t stay on the razor as well as the original did - seems to be a looser fit.  It is quite easy to dislodge the head while shaving, or while removing one of the comb attachments.    I still would recommend this product.  It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found for the job, which it does well.</li>
    <li> Works great again these were definitely worth it.  Cheaper than buying new razor.  I love this razor and am now glad it works like new</li>
    <li> It work better wet and slick. BUT it keeps coming off, I have no idea why. Kinda sucks that for sure.</li>
    <li> Recently, I bought my third replacement cutter blade for my razor.  It looks like the others, but it pops out seconds after using it.  It&#x27;s not worth returning.  The quality has gone way, way downhill.</li>
    <li> This is the first replacement trimmer/shaver foil and it seems to be working great so far.  Hopefully it will last longer than the original that came with Bodygroom.  The original didn&#x27;t last but a couple months.  This replacement fits my Phillips Norelco Bodygroom model BG2020.</li>
    <li> I dropped the trimmer and damaged the foil.  This makes it run like new and is reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> It works perfectly, thanks a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Others accessories sellers don&#x27;t work like this one, I recommend to anyone, best regards.</li>
    <li> On time works fine Thanks..</li>
    <li> These are great shaving heads and they are much safer than the scissors and exposed razor approach. It helps one avoid cuts.</li>
    <li> Been using this body groomer for well over a year.  This replacement foil/trimmer is (obviously) the same as original parts.  Works great as always.</li>
    <li> It came undamaged despite the postal service shoving it into a little mailbox. The product did it&#x27;s job, no bite, smooth.. Thank you for it!!!!</li>
    <li> These heads are easy to put in and take out...they are easy to clean...and most of all the give a smooth shave</li>
    <li> The thing works of for about 4 months, then you have to change it, but it work really good, a must have!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s working great, Just as it was describe.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks LuKs</li>
    <li> Norelco advertised these as being safe to use anywhere on your body, so obviously a lot of guys are going to use them to trim/shave their junk. While the main shaver is safe to use on your balls, be careful with edge trimmers cause they are open razors that have left me with a couple knicks on my nuts. Maybe a newer model provides better protection</li>
    <li> I lost the original shaver head that came with the Norelco Bodygroom and needed a replacement. This is an authentic replacement and clicks right in.</li>
    <li> If you like thos product this replacement will help you out. Since its only a replacement head you are probably enjoying the product. Otherwise you&#x27;d probably trow it away. The Bodygroom will not become a different appliance with this replacement.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK. The Bodygroom Foils tend to fall out easily if not maintained under constant pressure. In falling out regularly, sooner (rather than later), they develop the skin-tearing foil tears which require replacement. I typically order 3 per order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would be nice if they fit snugly, and didn&#x27;t tend to fall out of the shaver at the least &amp;#34;provocation&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> The replacement does not fit properly and keeps falling out. This is the second time I tried this and will not order again. Looking to replace the whole unit with a better product.</li>
    <li> The original head just fell apart without any warning after about 6 months of weekly use.  The new one pops in just as easily as the old one pops out and restores the shaver to like brand new.  Aparently the head does not last long and it is important to keep a spare around.  The shaver is probably the best and safetest shaver to use around certain sensitive body areas like arm pits.</li>
    <li> Good quality replacement head for the Bodygroom razor.</li>
    <li> I love my trimmer and having the option to order the replacent head is perfect! I use it daily so every 2 to 3 months I need to replace.</li>
    <li> Im very satisfied with the product. It seems far superior to the factory shaver foil that came with the razor. I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone who owns this razor. The performance will be much improved. I also received it rather quickly considering I opted for traditional shipping.&lt;br /&gt;AMB</li>
    <li> Does the job. gives you close shave with less in irritation the than other screen shavers. the side clippers don&#x27;t work well on thick hair it&#x27;s more for hair on the legs, ears etc.</li>
    <li> Great product! Night and day difference from the worn out blade. I like to wait a few months before reviewing and we have had zero problems with the replacement blades :)</li>
    <li> Love my bodygroom shaver, but after 2 years, the foil on the blade finally broke. I looked at Amazon and, of course, here was this replacement. It&#x27;s a great price, and arrived real quick. I&#x27;ve got to say this feels better than the original (it looks ever so slightly different) and it&#x27;s now like having a new shaver. Thanks Amazon :-)</li>
    <li> I was sent the wrong product. The label on the companies personal barcode said it was a body groom, but the actual product was a completely different blade. It had the 3 circular blades, rather than the longer bar shape as shown in the picture. I&#x27;m not sure if this was an accident or if the company has this product mislabeled/imaged.</li>
    <li> Brand new in perfect condition.  Works great.  The cat knocked my shaver onto the floor and ran away with the original.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and worked great in my Norelco body groomer. Have the newest model and my old blade was over a year old and the foil on these things just start falling apart after awhile and become more of a torture device than a body groomer. This new replacement blade made it like new again. Very pleased, stays in very well when knocking it around so haven&#x27;t experienced what others have said about it falling out easily.</li>
    <li> the replacement cartridge does not stay in place. I have to put a piece of paper on the side to make sure the cartridge does not fall out. I&#x27;m not spending $50-90 for a new groomer each time. I&#x27;m on my 2nd groomer right now.</li>
    <li> The replacement head was like buying a new unit all over again. This unit seems like it will last forever as long as I buy this replacement foil every once and awhile.</li>
    <li> Blade cuts like new again. Very happy.  Very easy to install. A monkey could do it :-)</li>
    <li> It works perfectly it was everything I expected and more. If you need one then you should consider this it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> While the Philips Norelco Bodygroom Replacement Trimmer/Shaver Foil works well, it appears to be way too expensive.  The cost detracts from the value of the product.  The return on investment is just not there.  I would not buy it again or recommend it to a friend because it is so expensive.</li>
    <li> I had been using the stock foil for 2 years now.  Way too long!  I switched and I couldn&#x27;t believe the difference it made.</li>
    <li> Good product. Does anyone know if any department stores carry this? For example, Walmart, target, etc.? I used to have to buy the whole razor set whenever the little guard tore and it&#x27;s expensive!</li>
    <li> My boyfriend is allergic to regular razors and breaks out when he uses them. These razor and refill heads are perfect and keep him from breaking out. Loves that its a trimmer and shaver.</li>
    <li> Fit perfectly.  Need up replace thus every six months.  Genuine Norelco replacement part.&lt;br /&gt;Fit perfectly.  Need up replace thus every six months.  Genuine Norelco replacement part.</li>
    <li> you would think for a well known brand, it would be engineered correctly.. my replacement is slightly smaller than the original and it falls out quite often when i go to shave...</li>
    <li> This foil met my expectations completely. No less than I thought it would. I have used the shaver for two years completely satisfied.</li>
    <li> wish they still carried this typw of shaver i had to go on another site to get another one as a gift for someone but perefect for the price</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed! It was hard do find this Philips Norelco Bodygroom Replacement Trimmer. And this is the best price I&#x27;ve got! Thanks!</li>
    <li> Product was exactly what I needed and exactly as pictured. Was able to order cheapter than anywhere else and was received very fast!</li>
    <li> great price, does what it&#x27;s supposed to!  Everyone remember to replace your foils on a regular basis, at least every 4-6 months.</li>
    <li> Not sure what happened with this replacement, but this one tends to fall out. I have tried others, but this one has a hard time being secured.</li>
    <li> I was having trouble using my Bodygroomer , besides having to shave the same area more than once it was also pulling hair until I read that the cartridge should be change every 6 months . I had it for two years , no wonder, ouch.</li>
    <li> It works just as well, if not better, than the one that came with the shaver.</li>
    <li> not working as original it is fake product not original</li>
    <li> Good product. Will order again.</li>
    <li> This replacement foil fits both my old BG2020 and new BG2028 just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve bought several over of these folks during lifespan of my BG2020, but recently had the chance to compare the performance of the new (original) cutter foil that came with my BG2028, to this replacement foil which I had bought for the old BG2020.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others here have reported, the replacement is hands-down better than the original, clearly sharper and more effective at going through hair, with both foils being essentially new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The combination of Subscribe+Save and a recent coupon made the price very reasonable.  Recommended.</li>
    <li> Works better than the original, great service by the seller.</li>
    <li> Works as it should, just like the original, great !  The shipping cost was pretty stiff, but the Bodygroom is a good product, and worth having the foil replaced, especially since I messed up the original one in the first place.</li>
    <li> It fit on perfectly I had no problems with it and it shaves like new now.</li>
    <li> Fit perfectly and since these are hard to find in stores it was a huge relief and the price wasn&#x27;t too bad either. We will purchase again!</li>
    <li> Thank God for this replacement. Fits perfect and feels good to have a fresh blade. Had no idea there were even replacements and and almost bought a brand new groomer when I dropped mine and broke the teeth off my original razor.</li>
    <li> If you want good performance from your groomer, keep the foil oiled and replace it 1-2 times per year!</li>
    <li> This 3 star rating is directly related to the product...not the E-Comm store. They were great. I have been using this product for about 2 years,mans regularly change foils...every 3 months or so. It is suggested on the label to change every year...when you pay $15 for a razor/foil...it should work. AGAIN...THIS IS NOT A REFLECTION OF THE MERCHANT.</li>
    <li> The price is right on this one and works great! I have owned a Bodygroom for 2 years now and love it! This blade is much cheaper than the new one and works great.</li>
    <li> Bodygroom shaver works great and this replacement trimmer and foil were very easy to install.  I really liked that the two hair trimmer blades are combined with the razor blades so that when you replace one, you replace them all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the Bodygroom for a few years now, and something has changed in their clips or whatever connects the foil to the main unit.  The last two have given me trouble staying clipped-in during use.  Overall, good quality, just annoyed a bit that the foil pops out during use sometimes.</li>
    <li> Snapped right into my Bodygroom handle. Worked like a charm... far sharper than the one I had in there (I use it to shave down my head, so the blades get a little more use than normal).&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfied. Will absolutely go this route again when it comes time to get more replacement cartridges.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the right piece, but for some reason every time I would point the unit towards the floor, the blade would fall out.  The measurements of the blade were off and it did not fit correctly.  Expected better.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to replaced the old head on my Norelco Bodygroom. In my opinion I think it does a better job then the old one when it was new. Cuts the hair without pulling (THAT&#x27;S A HUGE PLUS), and gives me a close shave. I am going to purchase again!!</li>
    <li> Excellent and the price too.</li>
    <li> Have been using the Bodygroom razor for quite awhile.  Eventually the blades need replacement!  All in all this is an excellent product and certainly does well what it is supposed to do. The newer replacement blade works even better than the original.  It gets &amp;#34;there&amp;#34; very closely without any nicks or scratches.</li>
    <li> As a black male model with sensitive skin (and beard), I live by this razor for giving such a quick, wonderful close shave; I often give the bodygroomer as a gift plus I&#x27;ve been ordering the replacement heads for years now and believe me when I say that I have used it to shave EVERYTHING in my line of work. I highly recommend it to ANYone who suffers from ingrown hairs in their beard or simply endures hyper-sensitive skin (no matter where that skin is).</li>
    <li> 3 years later and the foil trimmer is still going strong. 100% recommend. Can&#x27;t beat Norelco for body grooming.</li>
    <li> This is the best shaver for Mens body. You can get all those &amp;#34;spots&amp;#34; you do not want to cut. Make sure you change the head every couple months and you will never cut yourself.</li>
    <li> Long lasting blades for a long lasting machine</li>
    <li> Exact replacement at great price. Quick Prime shipping!</li>
    <li> This is my second replacement foil, i usually change them every year or as needed. The packaging looked original and it even came with an extra comb. The shaver foil however is CRAP! It constantly pops out of the bodygroom when trimming/shaving! My original foil and my first replacement were both gray in color, this one however was black. It looks the same as the gray ones in terms of dimensions, however fits the bodygroom terribly (there&#x27;s a little shake) which is the cause of the head constantly falling out of the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice is look for the older transparent packaging (genuine philips) to ensure you get the better shaving head</li>
    <li> They come on time and intact with every order. They always fit my Norelco Body groomer like they are supposed to. They last for several shaves.</li>
    <li> I have used ladies&#x27; electric razors for over 50 years and none of those can even come close to this body groomer.  It holds a charge longer, cuts closer, and has a red light that glows when you have an hour&#x27;s charge left.  I love this razor and will never go back to using a ladies&#x27; razor again after using this body groomer.</li>
    <li> I got my original shaver from Sam&#x27;s for about $30 bundled with some extra attachments and bought the first replacement foil from Amazon. For that price, it works great, but I find it hard to believe that anyone who shaves daily can get five months use (according to Amazon&#x27;s recommended subscription delivery schedule) from the face shaver attachment before a tear appears in the foil that can leave a painful scratch on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d like to see a more durable foil that can last six months in the real world. The original foil and its replacement lasted about two months each on my light to moderate facial hair.At that rate, my replacement screen subscription would cost over $70 a year. In fact, I&#x27;m writing this as I order ANOTHER replacement foil and wonder if I need to ration my use of this precious commodity; I wonder (with apologies to &#x27;Seinfeld&#x27; fans) if today&#x27;s five o&#x27;clock shadow is &amp;#34;foil-worthy&amp;#34;?</li>
    <li> Smooth razor head great replacement  to the original  one I have a axe body  groomer fit perfect</li>
    <li> These fit in my shaver and it started working like new. I&#x27;m not sure what else to say. These are a good replacement for the shaver that they are meant to fit into.</li>
    <li> This is the correct replacement for the Philips Norelco body trimmer.  It is easy to install and does not require any tools.</li>
    <li> Very good cartridge, much better than the original, exceeded my expectations, can buy because it is very good but produto.ja&#x27;ll buy to let saved!</li>
    <li> This razor allows me to shave parts of my body that I would never attempt to shave with any other razor, hand held or electric.  Now I can shave anywhere, anytime without fear or pain.</li>
    <li> The unit that came with my Bodygroomer had the painful tendency to snag and pluck hair as well as to scrap and cut delicate skin. This replacement has been wonderful, shaving quickly and cleanly without any blood loss whatsoever!</li>
    <li> The part was exactly what was needed and did an excellent job.  This saved us from buying a new shaver.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a replacement for my BG2020 shaver. I have used it approximately 15 times so far. The first couple of times, it pulled my hair harder than the stock head, but still worked fine. After about 10 uses, the foil would frequently lose its connection from the part of the shaver that makes the blades move, which meant the razor was on but the blades would not shave my hair. I had to reattach the foil numerous times before the blades began moving again. This resulted in at least twice as much time required to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the foil constantly falls out of the shaver when it is being used. For some reason, the fit has become very poor. The razor is now unusable at this point. It seems I received a dud.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied w/my purchase.  Will definitely do more business in the near future And I will refer my friends to this website as well.</li>
    <li> It works well, is easy to use and to clean. compact and save you money because you don&#x27;t have to replace it as often as a regular blade.</li>
    <li> This was for my son. He is very pleased!</li>
    <li> Great deals on the replacement heads, esp. with Subscribe &amp; Save. I&#x27;ve been using this product for years. It&#x27;s solid and hasn&#x27;t broken yet. I don&#x27;t have a lot of body hair so I can&#x27;t attest to how well it does in those cases. I trim my body hair once a month and it works for me. No snags, no irritation.</li>
    <li> 8&amp;#62; Thank You $$$ 8&amp;#62; :D ^^</li>
    <li> This item was a replacement for an older damaged foil, and it fits perfectly and works just as the original.</li>
    <li> Much needed item. Went to many stores in the Boston area but unable to find (July 2013) I now live in the Philippines and I often need outdated items not available on line or in retail stores in this country but only found in the USA.&lt;br /&gt;I was pleased with the shipping &amp; packing.&lt;br /&gt;I am disappointed that I am not able to buy my much needed items here on line in the Philippines. I have two bodygrooms. One of which the battery has died and the other does not hold the trimmer/shaver foil in place. It just falls out. I will not be back to USA until July 2014.Therefore I am without my grooming set. I made the mistake of not buying a new unit while in Boston. Is there anyway to buy new unit while here in Cagayan de oro Philippines?</li>
    <li> The one star is for Norelco&#x27;s website policy of coercing the purchaser to go through a survey to warranty the product.</li>
    <li> Just like described and received package quickly</li>
    <li> Extends the life of my unit another 2-3 years</li>
    <li> great item, just needed a replacement.....</li>
    <li> I have had the same shaver for over several years and I have only had to replace the blades.  Great blades too!</li>
    <li> Perfect fit and cuts much closer than the one it replaces</li>
    <li> Excellent replacement. No probem.</li>
    <li> The Bodygroom is great, I&#x27;ve bought two of them, but after a while the replacement foils get loose and start to fall out while you&#x27;re using the shaver. I&#x27;ve now bought the higher-end Bodygroom shaver, which has a different style of shaving head, in hopes that it will last longer.</li>
    <li> Just like the original. Everything came as expected and gives a great shave.</li>
    <li> The battery drains very fast, but very good product overall</li>
    <li> This is my second time ordering the bodygroom replacement. The foil actually lasts pretty long but its easy to ruin it. Once the foil parts gets damaged, you can get cut so you have to eventually replace it. It works well for what its intended. Overall, great product!</li>
    <li> The Phili[s Norelco Bodygroom is the best shaver ever used.  The foil has needed replacement at least once a year -- the manufacturer says every six months.  Amazon&#x27;s price is the lowest I&#x27;ve seen for replacement foils -- plus free supersaver shipping!  What more could one ask?</li>
    <li> The quality of this replacement head is way cheaper than the original one. The plastic inside the head broke after one time use, and I had to replace that part with my old one. I should&#x27;ve bought the whole kit rather than this poor-quality head</li>
    <li> If your groomer has some mileage on it you will appreciate this.  It brings it back to life with a fast close groom.</li>
    <li> Great replacement, grate product</li>
    <li> very good replacement for my body groomer</li>
    <li> I like the shave head/foil performance.  Very smooth, and like the trimmer blades on the bottom to shave my neck.  I can&#x27;t use a regular, ordinary wet razor daily, because of ingrown hairs in my neck, but this shaver works great.  The only complaint is the fact that I get around only 7-8 months from the head/foil.  After that, a hole wears through and can&#x27;t use it safely.</li>
    <li> Still going strong. Great seller.</li>
    <li> Certainly made an improvement in the performance of my electric razor after I replaced the head after two years of use.</li>
    <li> good price; fast deliver.</li>
    <li> This item shipped out fast and was exactly what i was looking for.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product to shave my head, and had to purchase these replacement trimmers. I need to replace them maybe once a month. If you shave your head, this is an awesome option to use instead of a straight razor. It gets a really smooth shave right down to the skin....love it.</li>
    <li> Works well.  Repeat purchase.</li>
    <li> Very fragile, lasts around 2mo.</li>
    <li> Good price if with free shipping. Seem to last long time.  I usually dent the foil before it gets dull and it then has a tendency to nick.</li>
    <li> Changing this every couple of months make a difference.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about two months now. In my first week of using it One side of the foil came out I popped it back in Then the trimmer pop out when I was using it So I snapped it back on. I tried to look for someone else that sells this item But so far I haven&#x27;t.It&#x27;s been okay ever since then The foil looks like it might pop out again I&#x27;ll probably order another one. I have no choice.</li>
    <li> these are awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to get a replacement for $6. Definitely worth it if you like to keep yourself well groomed. Easy to clean, and lasts a long time. The screen got busted on my first one, so I had to order a replacement. Works great.</li>
    <li> Does what it was designed to do.  Remove unwanted hair.</li>
    <li> I got two replacement in my order and my norelco looks like new. I&#x27;d recommended to anybody to get this replacement.</li>
    <li> It was as expected. IT would be useful to know how much is official use time before it get broken and dangerous (I almost hurted me when the previous shaver get broken)</li>
    <li> This razor keeps falling off. Maybe, I got a bad one but I&#x27;ll take the chance and reorder a different one.</li>
    <li> Exact fit and extremely reasonable from a pricing standpoint...definitely would recommend and will purchase again in the future.  A+ Experience</li>
    <li> I have read other reviews of the body groomer where people complain about being knicked by the blades.  Change them!  It&#x27;s not the groomer, the blades wear out.  I change the blades every6 months because I used the grommer to trim body hair several times a wekk.  You can&#x27;t go wrong at this price.  It trims almost as close as a multi blade razor at a fraction of the price with no ingrown hairs.  There is even a discount if you schedule the replacements.</li>
    <li> I got two of these blades recently. I have a BG2000 and these blades keep falling off every once in a while when I am shaving. I tried using the secong foil that I got and same thing. Gets the job done in the end but very very inconvenient.</li>
    <li> It is correct part just too pricey and a nuisance. No more buying razors from Wal-Mart or Target if they make me do this.  This is the 4th one of these I bought. These are cheap knock-offs. They fall out of the razor when being used. Some of them come not even flush cross-wise. Some are not aligned, 1 side is flush other side is pushed in 1-3 mm. Ouch!</li>
    <li> I bought the bodygroomer to tirm my back and shoulders and the biggest problem was that the blade trimmer foil would fall of very often.  I bought the replacement head thniking that the head was just a bad fit.  The new head does the same thing.  Not a very good product.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, item as descibed :)</li>
    <li> perfect replacement great price</li>
    <li> Great replacement on my body groomer that I have used for many years and will now get many more out of.</li>
    <li> Perfect replacement. Great price. Tks</li>
    <li> Seemed to work better than the one that comes with it.</li>
    <li> My asshair has never been shorter.</li>
    <li> Great replacement head. Works better than the riginal. After use would recommend you put some sort of oil on it to keep it new like new.</li>
    <li> Did not fit our bodygroom (but supposedly it was listed as compatible). The problem was when you applied any pressure to the trimming head, it would fall off.</li>
    <li> Doesnt fit to good ... like it small ...</li>
    <li> Perfect just what I needed, especially that I can&#x27;t find the! On the stores any more, great good a new thanks so much!</li>
    <li> The package of the original groomer instructions is to replace it every 5 months. I used it for 18 months and I did not notice much improvement in the shaver. It is a good product that works pretty well on coarse hair. Save your money. Don&#x27;t replace it every 5 months.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t find the replacement in stores, instead of buying a whole new razor just bought this. fits well works well</li>
    <li> The Philips Norelco bodygroomer is a great product. i use it once a week and it works. i would recommend it to anyone who is looking to shave any part of there body.</li>
    <li> Pros:  cuts hair well, no irritation, quick shaving, better alternative to regular razors&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  can break somewhat easily, foil can bend easily</li>
    <li> Does not fit properly though it is meant for the specific model. Simply no where in the range of the original that comes with the whole unit.</li>
    <li> Wow I was long over due for a new head. I placed this unit on my shaver and it made a world of a difference! The older one still works but not nearly as well. Easy replacement.</li>
    <li> Perfect!  Made my razor like new again!</li>
    <li> My husbands trimmer head got broke and I was upset we&#x27;d have to buy a whole new one! but nope.. found the replacement on amazon</li>
    <li> Perfect replacement , good service</li>
    <li> Good replacement shaver.</li>
    <li> This replacement blade is so much smoother shaving and nicks way!!!!!!!!!!! less. Super awesome for those DOWN-TOWN AREAS ((Wink Wink)).</li>
    <li> very pleased with this came qwibetter tyan stock</li>
    <li> snapped right in but dont give a close shave on the body.</li>
    <li> Very useful trimmer.. Recommended</li>
    <li> finally got it after submitting my order three times, works like a charm. I will order another in 12 months or s when this one wears out.</li>
    <li> perfect replacement for my shaver. made it like new again</li>
    <li> Good fit, original packing and sharp enough, but not as sharp as the original blade. All an all a good replacement.</li>
    <li> If you use this dry and do not get it wet, it will last a whole lot longer.  I have used these blade for over a year before replacing.  Also, don&#x27;t let it get clogged up with hair.  Remove it and gently tap it against the sink to get the hair out.</li>
    <li> these replacement foils appear to be hit or miss.  i have had ones that sucked out of the box and others that cut like a champ.  this time it was a good cutter version.  still pretty crappy that you never know what you will get-- especially when it is 15 bucks a pop.</li>
    <li> This item is exactly as described. We purchased it for my son&#x27;s razor, and it works perfectly. Thank you so much.</li>
    <li> Works well. I forgot how the device worked when it was new and replacing the head made it work like new, i would recommend this.</li>
    <li> Shipment was super fast and packed well. Fit perfect in trimmer so i did not need to replace whole thing. Will recommend and will buy again.</li>
    <li> Been using this shaver and heads for years and years and I still love it.  This is a decent price</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve reordered these 6 times now. Best price. Best quality (genuine Norelco). Will reorder many times to come. Great job.</li>
    <li> works like the original one, had no problem with them so far. Philips Norelco bodygroomer has been one of the best in the market, i recommended to many of my friends and they all love it.</li>
    <li> Needed a replacement was looking for chrome but the black one was a little less money. Works very well.its a keeper.</li>
    <li> This is a Wonderful replacement part. Arrived on time with no worrys at all.</li>
    <li> Fit my razor perfectly.</li>
    <li> Best groomimg shave available</li>
    <li> This replacement do not adapt 100% to the BodyGroom</li>
    <li> Perfect. Now my shaver is like new again.</li>
    <li> Replacements never really seated permanently for me.  When it was in place it works fine, but it would unseat pretty regularly.</li>
    <li> I have been using my Bodygroomer for years and did not know I could replace the head.  Now it is like using a brand new product and cheaper than buying a whole new groomer.</li>
    <li> It is what it is at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Blades are sharp but do not seat securely and constantly fall out during normal light usage. Avoid.</li>
    <li> Not sure if these are knock offs but they suck. They would never stay attached to the trimmer head and would fall out during use. Not fun!</li>
    <li> this blade really gets the job done. It lasts a long time as well no matter how coarse your hair is</li>
    <li> Best razor ever for the use I got it for. If you are shaving your lower mid section, THIS is the best razor to do the job without pinching or cutting.</li>
    <li> If you haven&#x27;t purchased new blades and your using an older bodygroom unit, then you&#x27;ll be pleasantly surprised like me to find that they rounded the blades that catch the long hairs and it no longer tears at the soft skin in the &amp;#34;delicate place.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad they sell replacements foils so that you don&#x27;t have to replace the whole razor. The foil works great &amp; so does the trimmer. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I simply needed a replacement foil for my Bodygroom, and this worked as advertised. Postage was a little longer than desired, but hey Australia is so far away ... :-)</li>
    <li> GREAT PRICE QUICK AND EASY PURCHASE. I WOULD PURCHASE IN FUTURE FROM THIS PARTICULAR RETAILER !!!!!!!!!!!!  NO HASSLES ,GREAT REPUTATION</li>
    <li> Purchased the Philips Norelco BodyGroom Pro a couple weeks ago and I&#x27;m in love! Surprised to find out I won&#x27;t have to replace my trimmer/shaver foil for a full year!!!</li>
    <li> They always come sharp and ready to go. That is why I buy them from you. The price and quality.</li>
    <li> This replacement fits it my machine perfectly, it was exactly what I was looking for, now i can shave again!!!!!! thanks !!!</li>
    <li> Thought my first one may just have been bad but these things just don&#x27;t get close enough to be useful. Need to follow up with razor.</li>
    <li> Works great but wish it would last longer.  Seems like the blades get dull really fast.</li>
    <li> It was nice to have a fresh set of blades in my shaver. So far they are doing what they need to do. I would reorder this in the future.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice ang good it&#x27;s high quality</li>
    <li> As described.  Works great!</li>
    <li> These are wonderful shavers and replacing the foil once in a while definitely makes a difference for comfort and closer shave.</li>
    <li> Worst then the original trimmer foil</li>
    <li> I thought I was going to have to throw the handle away and buy another one when the last one fell into the sink and promptly washed away. Does the job. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Purchased on here to avoid having a hard time finding replacements locally. Model fits my razor as intended and is the correct model replacement. No longer have to consider buying a replacement razor. Fits my BG2020 and BG2040 razors.</li>
    <li> takes 5 seconds to replace</li>
    <li> After searching many stores for this replacement foil I finally found it online. The replacement foil works great and it&#x27;s made by Philips. If you use your bodygroomer alot like I do then you should really order extra since these are sometimes hard to find. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I purchased it because the original one had some of the foil missing and I couldn&#x27;t shave with it without getting nicked by the blades. I try to keep myself groomed below the belt for a smoother area.</li>
    <li> This is a great  bodygroom replacement trimmer.  I have used&lt;br /&gt;it several times now and find this to be very easy to use</li>
    <li> This razor blade assembly is a great replacement for your worn out blade. It does what it&#x27;s supposed to, and it fits well. It feels like it&#x27;s made well also. No reason to go anywhere else! Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> I have a BG2020 for about 3 years without changing the blade, I thought it wouldn&#x27;t be necessary. Recently it started to stuck when I was using, and was doing its job poorly, I thought the problem was the hair in the body, but I decided to try a new blade. Result was WAY BETTER than I expected, the new blade fits perfectly in the BG2020 (actually it holds better then the original one), and it feels like I bought the bodygroom again, the new blade does the job very very well. Just started using so I dont know how long it lasts, even though I rate 5 stars for it, and recomment strongly.  best regards</li>
    <li> I bought it 6 months ago its still working great. Amazon is great</li>
    <li> Cuts better than the original.</li>
    <li> I would use my body groomer until it started to literally cut me up from the foil being worn. I finally smartened up and ordered a replacement and much to my surprise it actually worked better than the original brand new foil that came with the groomer! It&#x27;s really easy to install as it just pops in and clicks. Amazon has these replacements on sale every so often for like 80% off so if you own a bodygroomer keep your eyes peeled - I only wish I bought another!</li>
    <li> They work as intended.</li>
    <li> I never bothered replacing the foil for my bodygroom and it was basically useless the last couple months. As soon as I got the new one put on the product worked like it was brand new. I recommend keeping up with the maintenance, it isn&#x27;t that expensive and makes a huge functional difference.</li>
    <li> It fit my bodygroom, that was all I needed it to do. The bodygroom is the best hair trimmer ever.</li>
    <li> Great buy for the money.  These replacement heads can cost almost $25 from Schick.  I got all four for far less than I imagined.  The foil on the heads tend to be very delicate, and require replacement about twice a year, depending on use.  If the foil gets a snag or tear, it will cut your skin.  I like the Bodygroom system, since it works very well, but keep extra shaving heads on hand.  Good value.</li>
    <li> Too soon to tell how long the original blade will last but thought I&#x27;d buy a replacement now as so many products change. Love the device to date and hope I get lots of mileage from the blades.</li>
    <li> Did not fit secure into mechanism. Kept falling off out of machine while I tried to use it. Had to glue it in place. Obviously not able to remove blades to clean properly any longer. Disappointed, was exteremly happy wit product until this point.</li>
    <li> I like my ladies (well, now, my lady) nice and neat, and one day (probably many days too late) I realized that the least I can do is return the favor.  So, after a lot of research into how to tend your garden sans wax or razor blade, I decided to give the Bodygroom a try.  The fact that I am buying replacement blades shows I have decided to stick with it.  It&#x27;s still a cautious process, but with only 2 slightly small minimal nicks in 3 years, I&#x27;m a pretty big fan (and the lady appreciates the reciprocity in grooming).</li>
    <li> I have had my trimmer for a few years now and nothing cuts as close as these foils. Will stick with Philips</li>
    <li> I love the new design. The new edges are much more skin friendly. Easy to clean wet or dry too.</li>
    <li> Love this product, always fast shipping and no issues</li>
    <li> I am on my second one, and I don&#x27;t use the groomer that often. Going to need a new one soon. The quality isn&#x27;t that good. Unfortunately, if you have the machine and you need this part...there aren&#x27;t any other options.</li>
    <li> Perfec and not priceyt! This works great to replace worn out piece and continue enjoy the groomer more more and more.</li>
    <li> This is a perfect replacement head for the norelco bodygroom. It&#x27;s exactly like the ones it came with. Much more expensive at a retail brick-n-mortar store. I&#x27;d definitely buy these again when needed.</li>
    <li> As some of the other reviewers have said, I think the replacement head might even be better than the original one. I was a bit worried that it wouldn&#x27;t fit snugly as some reviewers had said but I didn&#x27;t have any fitment issues with my BG2040. The replacement foil snapped right in to place and then it was good to go.</li>
    <li> Exceeded my expectations, delivered on time, received exactly what I needed. Strongly recommend your service.</li>
    <li> Hard to find locally and this just extended the life of my husbands MUST HAVE body groomer.</li>
    <li> Wonderful...My husband is very pleased.</li>
    <li> All the other reviewers have it right: thing thing works better than the one that came with my Bodygroom. Pick one up ASAP.</li>
    <li> fast delvery and good product</li>
    <li> came quickly and as described</li>
    <li> I use this to give my husband hair cuts.  Husband uses this daily to shave.  Lasts a long time.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly. Also comes with a new guard!</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace the foil that originally came with the trimmer.  Works exactly as I needed it to.</li>
    <li> Wrong part I returned it.</li>
    <li> great replacement head to a great product</li>
    <li> Fit good but kind of pricey for no more than the groomer cost.</li>
    <li> Cheap, and effective.</li>
    <li> They are alittle better the the blades that come with the shaver I have had to replace it about once a month  or once every two months I do clean it after every use. Now I am looking for a new shaver after I ordered another blade foil.</li>
    <li> This replacement foil fits perfect and is an easy direct replacement when your original begins to fail.  Worth the purchase to replace the foil every 6-12 months depending on regular use.</li>
    <li> Yeah it works, but the cost is close to the cost of the product.  A few years ago these were $5 a piece.  That&#x27;s fair.</li>
    <li> It´s possible to be used at BG2024.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with the Philips Norelco Bodygroom device and the replacement allows me to continue enjoying it&#x27;s use.</li>
    <li> These trimmer foils are a definite improvement over early models.  They are well made and hold up well.  I highly recommend buying these to extend the life of your trimmers and ensuring a clean trim on any part of your body.</li>
    <li> Over priced little piece of junk. Makes me made when I get the product only to have it break the second time I used it. which is funny because the original head did the same thing, cept not quite as fast.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit very well. It keeps falling off. This is my third replacement head. The first two were fine. This one is a dud.</li>
    <li> Should have bought  the hand set this one falls out more than my ordinal one. but it cuts good.The hand set prongs that hold the blade in wears out faster than the blade.  Still a good blade. I gave it a 4 star because it falls out more than my old one</li>
    <li> The latest product lasts a little longer than previously.</li>
    <li> Bought to fit Axe body groomer, works better than the original that lasted on my husband less than a week, will purchase in the future</li>
    <li> Great replacement to the original.</li>
    <li> This particular trimmer works very well. It doesn&#x27;t get as close of a shave as the Gillett body razor, however when it comes to trimming (not shaving) this is my to-to weapon.</li>
    <li> Works nuce, and it lasts long time.</li>
    <li> Arrived fast with prime!  I really liked the original trimmer.  Worked well for years.  I purchased the replacement blades and it fits very loose and pops out often.  Will not purchase again</li>
    <li> This is perfect. Better than the original and stays put and cuts well.</li>
    <li> Of course Amazon did fine shipping and processing the order, but make sure you get the right replacement blade.  Something about the replacement blade thay sent me was wrong...it looks exactly like the one that was in there, but it doesn&#x27;t work.  More of a pain to try to send it back than just pitch it.  Don&#x27;t know where I will get a new one probably in a local store if I can find it.</li>
    <li> As you&#x27;d expect, a replacement head identical to the one that came with the original product. Very useful as the thin foil on the head tends to tear after using for a while. I recommend buying an extra one to have on hand so you&#x27;re not stranded high and dry when the foil tears.</li>
    <li> The head that came with the groomer was slightly defective and got worse over time. Replacement was perfect and has worked very well so far. It is dificult to clean the blade though.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product.  it did excetly what it suppose to do and it was deleiverd on time.</li>
    <li> It works fine but now as good as the original one that came with the original product itself. Dont understand why there could be difference between replacement and the part that came with the product originally.</li>
    <li> Man what a difference new blades make! After almost 1 and 1/2 years I remembered to change mine out and its working just like it was when I took it out of the box.</li>
    <li> I have concerns about replacement. Original was great. The replacement has left razor burn on multiple occassions. I am not sure if its related to excessive summer heat or actually the screen. It works okay????</li>
    <li> worked very well replacing the original that came with the shaver</li>
    <li> I really love this. Lasts for a long time and very reliable-</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to cut as nicely as factory original but still gets the job done.</li>
    <li> it fits a bit lose, will fall off during use. other that that work fine.</li>
    <li> I have ordered 2 of theses heads for my shaver and the first one only lasted for about 8 shaves , i only used the thing about twice a week The foil splits on two of them in less than six months</li>
    <li> Women wax their lady parts like all the time! Now us men have a tool to trim our furry friends!</li>
    <li> Always check foil, cutters, and trimmers for wear or damage before using the groomer. Do not use the Groomer if foil, cutters or trimmers show signs of wear or damage, as injury may occur. Do not use the Groomer until shaving foil, cutters or trimmers have been replaced immediately. Do not use a towel or cloth to dry shaving foil or cutters as this may cause damage; allow to air dry thoroughly. Note: The trimming and shaving attachmens do not need any lubrication. The shaving foil unit is very delicate. Handle it carefully. Replace the shaving foil unit if it is damaged. Do not clean the shaving foil unit with the cleaning brush, as this may cause damage. It is recommended that you replace your shaving foil and cutters once a year.</li>
    <li> it work like if it was brand new and the blade was just right as well. I am going to buy more in the future as well</li>
    <li> I had no idea I needed to change the head on my razor. I was getting tired of the feeling that my hair was being ripped out all the time. I was also having trouble with the head falling off constantly. Changing the head helped a lot, and now I&#x27;m back to a hairless back!</li>
    <li> Over priced, poor quality loose fitting.  This product is not the same specs as the original.  Dead fit loosely and frequently fell out of the handle.  I purchased a whole new trimmer for only $12.  Don&#x27;t buy these replacements.</li>
    <li> Works but fits loosely in my shaver.  It is definitely better than the stock head though.</li>
    <li> Finally found replacement blades for my razor. They&#x27;re a bit newer designed than the original blade. Fits perfectly. Will be buying again soon.</li>
    <li> These blades are not very sharp and they fall out of the razor constantly. This thing has a great design but is poorly made</li>
    <li> I am very pleased that the replacement for the bodygroom exists. Eversince I bought the Shaver, I haven&#x27;t had to use any other. And it is one of my very favorite beaty accesory.</li>
    <li> great item and price after coupon. works perfect.</li>
    <li> VERY loose fit. Have to hold the replacement head to the razor in order for it to not fall off. Put your $17 towards a whole new shaver.</li>
    <li> Excelente producto, recomendado 👍🏼</li>
    <li> Gets the job done quickly, closely, and without irritation.</li>
    <li> Quick shipping, item was exactly as described and works fine</li>
    <li> I lost this little piece almost a year ago until I somehow happened to come across this while searching for trimmers. It&#x27;s exactly what I needed to be able to use my old razor again. Win!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an exact replacement by the manufacturer, of course it works.</li>
    <li> The Philips Norelco Bodygroomer is an Excellent razor but if you shave regularly you will Need replacement shaver foils as they tend to tear after use which can scratch up your face quite nasty if you arent paying attention.&lt;br /&gt;I needed a new one every 3-4months so I just set my account up for auto-re order considering it&#x27;s only $12 a pop.</li>
    <li> Fine but the guide did not fit my model.</li>
    <li> my skin is sensitive , and I do get burns/rashes ! But , this is the only replacement foils .if you can find another foil , let me know ?</li>
    <li> Love the Bodygroomer and will be using the Replacement heads sooner than later.  Generally like most Philips Norelco razor products.</li>
    <li> Perfect replacement item.</li>
    <li> fits my Philps Nerelco body groomer</li>
    <li> I brought this replacement foil after about a year of using the old one and it had a few dents in it from falling down. Anyway great replacement and works well. Make sure if your going anywhere near your Groin to have your shaver at full charge or else its your doom. If your shave isn&#x27;t at full charge the trimmer will slow down and start pulling hair and also your meat. That is the only recommendation I can think of.</li>
    <li> Product was as ordered and will work fine.  Price good and arrived very quickly.  Ordered 2 to save money.  Almost as cheap to buy a new razor but I thiink we are a throw away society and need to spend more to use what we have.  Would order again.</li>
    <li> I think my original blade went bad after a few months. I purchased this replacement and the trimmer feels new again.</li>
    <li> Refill ordered for the third time. The shaver has lasted me very long. In fact more than 2 years. Bravo!!!</li>
    <li> I had the body shaver for over a year, like any other electric razor you get used to it being dull.&lt;br /&gt;Wow did a new cutter make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;Cut twice as fast and didn&#x27;t pull.</li>
    <li> It fits the body groom and I use the body groom  to make the wife happy... Wife happy &#x3D; me happy</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve had your body groom for a while and you are starting to feel a bit more tugging and the cut isn&#x27;t as close go ahead and purchase a new foil head.</li>
    <li> NICE QUALITY! nice packaging and price is reasonable. should give it a try if u r looking for a good bodygroom replacement trimmer :)</li>
    <li> My Bodygroom 2020 feels like a brand new shaver. Simple install and it should be good for six months. Got this with a rebate coupon so it was a good deal.</li>
    <li> Why someone one would purchase a whole new groomer when you can pop in the replacement cartridge for pennies on the dollar beats me. NO brainer folks</li>
    <li> I use it as a body groomer for my body, it&#x27;s as close u can get without using a razor, great purchase.</li>
    <li> I have had these replacement heads before and I truly have no complaints that I can think of. I will definetelt by them again,.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery. Good product quality. It was exactly as pictured on amazon. No irritation with shaving. No issues with comparability with my shaver.  Recommend it.</li>
    <li> i bought the bodygroomer at target a while back. it didnt work to well but it was better than shaving. the whole design was not really thought out. the different sized clippers would fly off and you would end up leaving a bald spot wherever you were trimming at. and after a while the foil head would start falling off too! after a couple more months it would barely cut a single hair. bought the replacement foil head. works just as when i first bought it. if you have this model and its not trimming as good as it was, replace it with a new one. i highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This piece is really amazing because it does exactly what the original foil head does! Make sure to change it after 6 months of usage! Thank you!!</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I ordered and it works</li>
    <li> If you have anything other than peach fuzz the blade will simply fall out.  The worse part is when it gets stuck in thick hair and you have to pull it out, ouch!</li>
    <li> As long as u can get it to fit securely in place it will do what it was designed to do.  Mine pops off  quite easily, pretty annoying.</li>
    <li> I like the razor but the parts wear out very fast. When it works, it works well though. Ill buy it again.</li>
    <li> I used this blade one time and it began to make loud noises. Upon further inspection the screen covering the blade was broken and flew off. Horrible product. Buy somewhere else.</li>
    <li> works as good as the originals</li>
    <li> I replaced my bodygroom&#x27;s head with this soon after I had bought it and it&#x27;s a perfect fit, and easy to replace.</li>
    <li> The norelco shaver is one of the best shaves in my opinion, the results last a long time and your skin feels smooth and not irritated in any way. Definitely a good buy.</li>
    <li> Feels much gentle on skin when using this product. That is, compare to the dull shaver foil that&#x27;s been one year+ in service.</li>
    <li> Great product! accurate description!has never cut me once! Very safe and very close shave!</li>
    <li> It always works so much better with new blades.  I should replace it them more often because the difference is uncanny.</li>
    <li> Replaced the heads on my groomer and saved a bundle.</li>
    <li> very nice an clean cut  if you want to,use a body groom this is it</li>
    <li> This is the fourth time I have had to replace the shaver head on the Bodygrommer.  The manufacturer even recommends replacing it once a year, whether it is broken or not.  The price has been increasing so much and shipping charges are not going down.  The next time I will probably just buy a different shaver.  Filling up the landfill just to avoid expense shaver head replacements.  Here we go again.</li>
    <li> I love the Phillips BodyGroom; the replacement foils are good but tend to come out of the BodyGroom&#x27;s Head when grooming tight or slightly moist areas. Did I mention that I love the BodyGroom? I have 2 of &#x27;em, one at home and one at the gym. I never thought I would be as fastidious about body hair, but with the BG, being smooth is easy and looks good. My only gripe is as above, the replacement heads don&#x27;t fit as securely as the originals and it is a real nusaince when they pop out. But I will still give&#x27;m 4 Stars because overall I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I cant remember when i lost it, came off easily....Lucky to replace it.  Feel just Like a new one now.  Will be more careful next time for misplace.</li>
    <li> Love to use this on my trimmer but hate how fast it wears out. Don&#x27;t know why they would make them wear out so easily.</li>
    <li> These are great replacements for the Norelco Body Groomer. Perfect fit and seems to work better than the original foil shaver that it came with. Never cuts you. Easy to clean. Very good price. You should replace every 6 months or so... as anything longer than that the foil head begins to knick and cut your skin.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-- Works for 6-8 months, use 2-3 times per month&lt;br /&gt;-- Been using with Philips Norelco BG2040/34 Bodygroom 7100 since 2011&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-- None</li>
    <li> These things work great.  My shaved chest is soft as a baby&#x27;s a_ _.  I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> woo CHILD! i cannot believe i can cut anywhere on my body and not get nicked! i can pull on things, spread them etc. and get all the little hairs i dont want and i never am nicked nor do i bleed! sistas especially! if you dont like hair down thair (lol) GET THIS! and to the men? do yourself a favor if you like diving at the Y and get this for your girl!</li>
    <li> It works fine. for some reason though i feel the original one was better and a gave a smoother and closer cut.</li>
    <li> Awesome! Works great! Will buy again!</li>
    <li> Works great. Cuts super close with no pulling on hair.</li>
    <li> Although these are the Philips Norelco Bodygroom replacement foil heads - they ARE NOT the same ones that come on the trimmer out of the box. They do not work as well as the standard ones and Ive looked for them but couldnt find them. They do fit, and do the job, and will last you about a year with a few times a week usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When its time for new ones, it will deteriorate and simply not cut as well over time. My first replacement - the mesh gave away and scratched my face all up pretty bad.</li>
    <li> Works just like the original. Perfect replacement part. Only downfall is they don&#x27;t last. I&#x27;m on #4 as the foil tends to split and crack over time</li>
    <li> had the original one that came with it for a while just got replace with these and these a little bit more smoother and refined.  Like it!</li>
    <li> What original can one say about a shaver head?  Lol.  They work great with a great body shaver.</li>
    <li> Leaves the skin very soft and also hair do not grow as quickly as with Razor. Would highly recommend it to people who want to get rid of body hair easily.</li>
    <li> item is as described, it&#x27;s quality made, so far it&#x27;s holding fine and looks like it will last for some time.</li>
    <li> These last along time this is my second set and i use them often. They are very good for the price and most people i recommend them too the feel the same.</li>
    <li> It was way past time to replace the old Foil, so ordered a replacement.  It is not bad, just not much of an improvement in shave/trim as the old one.  The old one was more than 5 years old (ew, gross, I know...moving on), so was expecting a dramatic improvement.  It is working better in water, though.</li>
    <li> Way too fragile.They break all the time and they fall out way too easily. The razor they go with is also awful.</li>
    <li> Works great and with discount they offered it was even better.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t stay in place on the razor</li>
    <li> The blade itself is fine but doesn&#x27;t stay in the trimmer, it&#x27;s like it doesn&#x27;t fit right but it is the correct replacement so my guess is that it is a bad design! Very disappointing! While trying to trim my bikini area the blade would just fall out!!</li>
    <li> But I didn&#x27;t have to!  I love this bodygroomer!  It gets all those &amp;#34;intimate&amp;#34; places with a close cut and no razor burn!  I love that I can just buy a replacement head when it gets dull!</li>
    <li> I have two  of these shavers.  The replacements fall out on both. Faulty design.</li>
    <li> my husband has the body-groom and i was upset to find that the store didn&#x27;t have replacement shavers where i bought it.  after about a year the foil that protects from the blade had broken and would scratch him and he couldn&#x27;t use it.  i later read that they really needed to be replaced every year.  who knew?  glad i found a place to find them.</li>
    <li> It works but it doesn&#x27;t fit my device quite like the original did. Also the attachment heads (levels 1-3) don&#x27;t fit well with this replacement razor blade on the razor.  They are constantly popping off now, they never used to do that.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this! Fit my hubby&#x27;s electric razor perfect! Still going!</li>
    <li> Fits the Axe Norelco bodygroom perfectly</li>
    <li> Just a basic replacement its not as much of an improvement over the original as lead to belive, but good</li>
    <li> Seemed like the trimmer blades were dull right from the start.  Pinched and grabbed hairs rather than cutting/trimming smoothly, even on a full power/full battery charge.  This is odd, because I&#x27;ve RARELY ever had an issue with a Philips Norelco product.</li>
    <li> Its an amazing product. Mine usually last 8-9 months.</li>
    <li> The people that said these cut better than the original blade that came with the trimmer must have gotten a better blade than I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had no problem inserting the blade like some people, but the new blade cuts only marginally better than my old, dulled-out one did.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a loyal user of the Philips Norelco BG2040/34 Bodygroom 7100 since 2011. Lately, my Bodygroom has been acting finicky and even giving me some nicks/cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This replacement foil made my Bodygroom work just like it did when it was new in 2011. Since I do not use my Bodygroom everyday like the shaver I use on my face, I do not expect to purchase a new foil annually. The original foil that came with my Bodygroom lasted me 4 years. This replacement looks and seems pretty much identical, so I expect this replacement foil to last me quite a while as well.</li>
    <li> When I first purchased this Philips Norelco shaver, I thought my days of driving to the supermarket for a Mach 3 were over. The product worked fine, and I did not have major complaints outside of acquiring a beard trimmer. As time passed, I noticed a major problem, but not too extreme.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver foil on the trimmer popped out of its compartment, and I could not put it back in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, I wondered why - at least - a couple of blades weren&#x27;t purchased when I bought the razor. So, I purchased another shaver foil with the thought of the previous problem as a fluke. Then, the second foil had a crack, which as we know, another replacement is needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased another foil and the same things happened as the previous foil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, this made me wonder...are they building the foils to fail? And so, is this the money maker for this product? Its like the jean designers who build jeans only to have the back-bottom ends of the pants to rip so another pair needs purchasing.</li>
    <li> i was worried that the bg2000 replacent shaver might not fit my bg2020 model, but it did and both shavers work the same.  get the bg2020 replacement shaver...it is cheaper.</li>
    <li> thankfully, I can just replace the head and not the entire thing. My husband was going to throw it away instead of take the time for a replacement piece so now it&#x27;s mine.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I got these.  They work amazing.  So I didn&#x27;t have to buy a whole new razor.  Thanks Amazon.</li>
    <li> Fits the Philips Norelco Bodygroom perfectly. Works well and shaves hair well. Doesn&#x27;t matter which way you insert it, if it fits it&#x27;ll work.</li>
    <li> Somehow, they must have fine tuned this replacement head to be better than what came on my Bodygroom originally. It is much more comfortable to shave now. Before, I would nick myself. This replacement foil doesn&#x27;t do that.</li>
    <li> The replacement blade seems to cut better than the blade that came with the shaver. Happy with the purchase and will purchase again when it is time for a new one</li>
    <li> I LIKE THIS TRIMMER BUT IT HAS NO DURABILITY AT AT ALL. IT ONLY LASTED A FEW WEEKS AND ALL IVE DONE WAS SHAVE MY HEAD WITH IT. AS SOON AS THE &amp;#34;CHEAP&amp;#34; FOIL STARTS COMING APART JUST THROW IT AWAY. ITS IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND REPLACEMENTS ANYWHERE EXCEPT ONLINE. ITS A GOOD DESIGN AND IDEA BUT IT SHOULD LAST ALOT LONGER</li>
    <li> Great replacement heads.</li>
    <li> The blades don&#x27;t work all that well when new and pop off and break fairly easily.</li>
    <li> Quality all the way is the way I would address yet another suberb Philips Norelco Product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works and it works well...I an not a company employee nor spokesperson paid by the company.  I am a satisfied customer and have been loyal to this company for years.  The reason - quality products, innovative and advanced design...most importantly - superior performance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ron Greene&lt;br /&gt;rgreene@stellarecarehealth.com</li>
    <li> I bought this replacement after using the old one for at least 2 years and it works perfectly. I believe that it works better than the original head the BG2020 comes with.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice shaver and i&#x27;m glad we can replace parts easily because it&#x27;s lasting much longer than others we&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> These replacement trimmers are OK. They just don&#x27;t last long and have to be changed frequently which gets to be a little costly.</li>
    <li> The Axe Body Razor is an amazing product at a fraction of a price juxtaposed to other Norelco Razors, however the replacement blades are not advertised. After some research, I took a gamble and ordered these blades to see if they would work--and they did, marvelously! Now I can continue shaving without nicks and irritation because I have a sharp blade again. Keep calm and shave on!</li>
    <li> This is the right part--it looks a little different but fits perfectly and it works.  Shipped very quickly--so all happy.</li>
    <li> The head keeps jumping. I think it is more of a bad flaw / design of the trimmer than the replacement</li>
    <li> I replace my foil&#x27;s every 6 months and considering how much shaving I do in that amount of time and the price of this replacement, I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> It fits and it works.  Sounds simple right?  For some reason, finding a replacement the fits AND works for this trimmer isn&#x27;t that easy.</li>
    <li> This is my second replacement foil and this one is low quality compared to the original and previous replacement foil. The shave quality is worse, the comfort is worse, and it is continuously popping out of the shaver body. The previous replacement foil was great but this one is garbage. If this is actually from Philips and not a knock-off, their product quality has gone downhill.</li>
    <li> Wish these were easier to find. This is the standard foil replacement for all of their body groomers. They fall apart rather easily and cause significant wear to the groomer itself.</li>
    <li> Replacement heads are well made and last for a year or so. Easy to clean and maintain.  However they are hard to find locally.</li>
    <li> Nice.... could cost a little less, but not bad.</li>
    <li> Fit the Bodygroom perfectly, and works as well as the original that came with the Bodygroom when I bought it.</li>
    <li> These replacement shaver foils are of a higher quality than what I have previously received and they came to the door the day they were promised.</li>
    <li> Buy this until and unless you have 6 months old machine. If you have few years old machine this Replacement piece will not stay snug. If you tap little on machine and the blade will come out of machine. Also ran into problem, where grooming the hair and the clip gets stuck in hair and unhooks from the machine. (Its painful to take out the blade from the stuck hair)</li>
    <li> I have not changed my blades in about a year and a half. What a difference this makes! Makes it just like new. I would have to change them more often.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  I highly recommend it... so much easier than a manual razor!</li>
    <li> I replace this once a year, and it is a great shaver!!!!</li>
    <li> These don&#x27;t last long but we already had trimmer and cheaper to replace head then to buy new trimmer. Mesh screen does not last long. Seems almost intentional by company so you have to keep bugging them</li>
    <li> The Item is good, as described and works as expected but  I feel like the cost could be a little lower.</li>
    <li> This product does need to be replaced due to normal wear.  Have never received one that did not work.</li>
    <li> A few shower drops left some missing teeth on the factory head, this is a great little replacement.</li>
    <li> A simply installation to the trimmer, it works pretty good and smooth, highly recommended.</li>
    <li> As others have said, this replacement is MUCH better than the shaver foil than came with the device.  I would immediately replace this if you get nicked or find your original clippers not making the cut (pun intended).  If you are using this in your &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; areas, you will be well served.  Also great for those little hairs on the ears....</li>
    <li> great foil but should  las t longer</li>
    <li> Works so fine, but is kind of expensive if you take in count that it would die within 3 months using it once a week.</li>
    <li> great value for the money, works great for those private areas, easy to use and clean with or without the trimmer atachment.</li>
    <li> These refills are awful.  They snag very badly and hurt.  The original one that came with my razor over 2 years ago was better than a new refill!  Don&#x27;t bother.  Now I have to buy a whole new body groomer.</li>
    <li> I was a little concerned about buying these replacement foils but they fit my shaver just fine and give as good a shave as the original foil when it was new.</li>
    <li> The replacement trimmer /shaver foil, does not last a year like theY say . It only lasts 3 months or less if you use it every other day</li>
    <li> Great product at the very decent price. use it every day and definately recommend this product, Price was very good.</li>
    <li> Much like the original which game with the bodygroomer when I purchased it, this head fell right out upon use...  Had to crazy glue it on the sides. PoS.</li>
    <li> used to remove male body hair. Though Amazon&#x27;s caption does not show it, this is in fact the BG2000 replacement head specified by Philips for the BG2020. As some other reviewers reported, in use it tends to fall off the Body Groomer. Though inconvenient to have to be so careful, it can be kept attached by pressing down on the shaver so it is always perpendicular to the skin. Use device above something soft, so when the head falls off the foil does not get dented. [If buying this as a &amp;#34;trimmer&amp;#34; be aware that the comb attachments make the cut so close that only stubble remains, and the device is effectively just a &amp;#34;shaver&amp;#34;.]</li>
    <li> OMG i just love this shaver and the replacement works for me for months. this is so useful for every guy.</li>
    <li> I bought Philips Norelco Bodygroom Replacement Trimmer/Shaver Foil to replace the old one. It&#x27;s ok to use, but not good as original one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never written a review for a product before, but these are terrible.  After 1 use, the foil portion of the trimmer head falls off, leaving the replacement head completely unusable.  I&#x27;ve tried to reinsert the foil, but it is impossible to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought it may be a &amp;#34;one off&amp;#34; malfunction, so I put in the second replacement, and yup... sure enough, it too fell off on the second use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical, but this worked as good as the original head on my trimmer,, and at a great price.</li>
    <li> Product works well with my bodygroom</li>
    <li> OEM Part &#x3D; OEM Quality&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice to have sharp blades for trimming.</li>
    <li> This replacement head was really good, but it&#x27;s just like the one you are replacing. The quality is fine and it works great at first, but in my opinion they seem to fall apart rather quickly.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a shaver and this is a replacement head.  It does it&#x27;s job and it does it well.  In my experience, these things last way longer beyond what Philips Norelco says.</li>
    <li> Great product! Good material great quality... Let see how much time it last... I was not sure about this product because my bodygroom is not norelco... It is just Phillips ... But it fits adequately...</li>
    <li> Replacement Trimmer part fit  perfect. I could not find it at stores. So thanks for having it online. Thanks Again. CHARLIE</li>
    <li> Just like others have mentioned, it is better than the original foil that comes with the shaver and worth the money.</li>
    <li> Works great - lasts for a long time too.  If your second guessing buying the body groom because of the replacement razor costs - dont!  It is by far the most convenient thing to have as a male or female.</li>
    <li> Maybe cause it&#x27;s new....has to be broken in. Was grooming my chest, arm&#x27;s and leg&#x27;s and this new cartridge was really pulling on my hair.....it was painful. I always thought the sharper the blade, the less tugging and pulling you get......so what&#x27;s  the deal ? This is a brand new replacement cartridge.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my bodygroom for about 1.5 years and noticed that it started to pull/grab hairs sometimes, once I replaced the shaving head it was back to smooth cutting.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s kind of awkward rating a replacement part that works like it should, but I guess that is the point.</li>
    <li> Foil works great with my BG2024/15. Fits into the shaver just right, and is even sharper and provides a cleaner cut than the original foil the shaver came with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Plastic comb doesn&#x27;t fit, but perhaps that&#x27;s because I bought my shaver in the UK. Doesn&#x27;t really matter though, since plastic combs don&#x27;t wear out.)</li>
    <li> I have used this one for several years and it still works good. I would buy it again when this on e breaks</li>
    <li> UPDATE, IMPORTANT: I go from 1 to 3 stars on my reviw after I try my last replacement on my father in-law BG2020... for some reason his model and mine are visible identical but in his case the replacement fit great. I can only conclude that Phillips chance my model for a newer one and keep the model number and look the same (I purchase the two razors at Walmart but about 1.5 years apart). In that case this repacement will fit any newer 2020 model but for the ones purchase before 2011 may have the same problems I report.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hello please read,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a [[ASIN:B000EG8HLE Philips Norelco BG2020/31 BodyGroom]] and this replacement DON&#x27;T FIT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not throw your money on this replacement if you have the BG2020 model since this is not going to work well and DON&#x27;T FIT. It is way too loose, it will came of the razor machine just by turn it upside down. The only way to hold it is using the trim attachments, but still is very loose and I cut my self on 3 diferent ocasions when the hole razor came of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not think a this is plain bad luck since I write this review after buying two replaments over a period apart of almost one year so that bad luck is not a likely factor. The box was original, sealed and in perfect condition. Even says it&#x27;s a Norelco replacement for the model BG2020/31.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand Do fit great on a[[ASIN:B0037HP9OA Philips Norelco BG2040/34 BodyGroom Pro]] and maybe on the new models but if you are planning to use it on the BG2020 is a waist of money and a potencial \\&quot;manhood\\&quot; castrating devil device.</li>
    <li> Heck with expensive laser or waxing, just use the bodygroom. It is the most cost effective way to keep facial and body hair at bay.</li>
    <li> This one came from Korea and did not last long. I had to buy one from Bed, Bath, and Beyond.</li>
    <li> Thank you, i purchase again in 1 year :)</li>
    <li> Does not work properly. Sits loosely in the socket and does not cut. Is actually painful to use. Not worth purchasing.</li>
    <li> It works just like the original blade, but the construction is better quality. The only strange thing I noticed is that I didn&#x27;t receive the one in the picture (which looks identical to my original blade). Instead I received one that had black rubber instead of the grey plastic. Doesn&#x27;t impair the function, just something I noticed.</li>
    <li> Great product. I buy every time I need replacement. Cheapest around.</li>
    <li> IT fit in my body groomer perfect and worked just fine.</li>
    <li> great product, great vendor</li>
    <li> Close shave, but not as close as a blade. It would be nice if they lasted longer. This is my second replacement in 18 months.</li>
    <li> It works great and I am so glad I ordered it. I highly recommend this product to everyone who needs a new replacement.</li>
    <li> THE REPAKCEMENT HEAD WAS AS I HOPED, AND SO FAR HA SBEEN AS GOOD AS THE ORIGIONAL. UNFORTUNATLY THE ORIGIONAL WASN&#x27;T WHAT I HOPED IT WOULD BE AS THE FOIL BROKE LONG BEFORE I WOULD OF LIKED. MAYBE THIS WILL BE BETTER AND LAST LONGER, BUT IF YOU NEED TO REPLACE THIS IS THE ONE TO DO IT WITH.</li>
    <li> Package arrived as advertised.  This item works as advertised and the price was reasonable. The replacement foils fit our body groomers</li>
    <li> Perfect replacement. Everything works as it stated it would work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back Hair Beware .. your time has come yet again.</li>
    <li> Amazon has this and the price is right. It was an easy install to add life to your shaver.&lt;br /&gt;You can tell when the blade is getting dull when it pulls hair or just takes way to many shave passes to get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately my shaver was over two years old and when I replaced the blade the battery started to go. I get about four minutes before it needs recharged. Still a good deal and the best shaver for what it is designed for.</li>
    <li> My electric razor needed this to start performing like it used to. Made it like it just came from the factory. I&#x27;m a real smoothie again!</li>
    <li> The Bodygroom is a great product. Only replaced the head because it got damaged thanks to an airline company. I didn&#x27;t want the damaged head to damage my little head. I&#x27;m pretty attached to it and it&#x27;s two pals.</li>
    <li> fast delivery, item as described</li>
    <li> I purchased the Phillips Bodygroomer a couple of years ago for entire body shaving. I have been happy with the performance of the product. The last 6 months or so I noticed the shave head pulling hair more than cutting it. The manufacturer reccommends replacing the foil head every 12 months. Upon ordering and using the new shave foil I was amazed in the difference in performance. I guess the manufacturer was about right. The new head is fairly inexpensive and cuts great. I gave it 5 stars for price, quick delivery and performance. Wish I had ordered it much sooner.</li>
    <li> Needed to replace the one I broke and it works great!</li>
    <li> Great product all around, very effective. The handle has lasted several years as well (like maybe 5?)</li>
    <li> Met all expectations and was received quickly after being ordered.  It was great to be able to replace a lost part and being able to find such a resonable price</li>
    <li> Great replacement piece also came with this blue trimmer piece that that fit my 2040 but may fit one of the others described</li>
    <li> Could cut better. Need to make multiple passes over same area, more than you should have to. Not expecting a clean shave but better.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m tired of buying this replacement every 3 months because it brokes in the superior part and starts to cut the skin&lt;br /&gt;why in the box says that replace every 12 months it brokes only with 3 months of use??</li>
    <li> Good price, good product</li>
    <li> Order was everything it was listed as. Fit perfectly into the shaver that I needed to repair.</li>
    <li> Works well. As described. Fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Philips Norelco BG2040/34 BodyGroom 7100</li>
    <li> This is a direct quote from a previous review because I had the same experinece --- These refills are awful. They snag very badly and hurt. The original one that came with my razor over 2 years ago was better than a new refill! Don&#x27;t bother. Now I have to buy a whole new body groomer.</li>
    <li> Went blunt very very quickly !</li>
    <li> Got it quickly and accurate.</li>
    <li> Does not last long, need to purchase another one. Not for sure if i will.</li>
    <li> Does the trick bull becomes dull quickly</li>
    <li> this is a very good replacement blade and it will fit this perfectly. I would highly recommend getting this because the price is just right.</li>
    <li> I Was looking for the Norelco Bodygroom Replacement like crazy, n I founded here, n the prize was the best.</li>
    <li> The replacement foil works like a dream and gives you a clean smooth shave every time for all your unwanted hair.&lt;br /&gt;I would defiantly recommend this product to anyone wanting to show off their athletic body.</li>
    <li> not much to say about a spare part. Came on time, actually a bit earlier, and package was really good!</li>
    <li> i bought this replacement head in december 2012 as a backup for an electric shaver that was gifted to me over the summer. i&#x27;m not a fan of electric shavers in general because i dont believe they really shave as close as a blade does. but this was a gift after all and the first shave was remarkedly close but after that day it didnt seem to shave as close. well, 2 days ago i put the new replacement head on and on the second day of shaving the foil detached on one side of the head exposing the blades and wont slide back into place. well now i have a headless shaver and i dont plan on spending anymore money on any more faulty heads.</li>
    <li> Lowest price on a standard part.  What&#x27;s not to like?</li>
    <li> Not as sharp as the one originally included to the shaver.Quality of this product vary.Price was not too bad.&lt;br /&gt;OK</li>
    <li> The Philips Norelco Bodygroom is a nice product that works well when it works but it&#x27;s manufacturing is flimsy and the plastic falls apart and eventually this foil will no longer fit in place.  A complete re-engineering needs to be performed to make this more usable for the longer term.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***</li>
    <li> good price, convenient</li>
    <li> This thing seemed expensive, but the original foil on my Norelco lasted me 2 years before it really started pulling hair. I&#x27;ve only had this for a couple weeks and its working perfectly. Even if this lasts me a single year it will be way worth the price!</li>
    <li> Used it maybe 1-2 a week and it finally just stopped doing anything but getting trapped in hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see that the money comes from these flimsy replacement foils since the actual machine was so inexpensive.</li>
    <li> He seems happy with this trimmer for sensitive skin. Received promptly, and you can buy refills for the blade which is a plus.</li>
    <li> You feel the difference after replacing it. Cuts faster and smoother</li>
    <li> Affordable. I couldn&#x27;t figure out why my trimmer wasn&#x27;t working very well and it was because I hadn&#x27;t replace the head in 3 years! Replace your heads often and it will work like a dream!</li>
    <li> Exact replacement.  No issues.</li>
    <li> This replacement was shipped fast and works awesome with the model I have.</li>
    <li> Fit right on my existing bodygroomer. It hasn&#x27;t pulled any hairs and seems to be sharp. No complaints! Will buy again if I find myself in need.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality and packing.&lt;br /&gt;I strongly recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought this replacement foil as the original one had become old and worn. It popped on very easily and I was able to continue to use the Bodygroom product as I had before. I would definitely recommend this product to someone looking for a replacement foil for their existing Bodygroom!</li>
    <li> Just as expected, It came in black but it works just like my original.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected.  Very difficult item to rate.  It is  not smooth and can iritate skin.  Maybe i need to replace the main razor</li>
    <li> Dropped my trimmer/shaver on the floor and ordered this replacement head.  Does the job just as promised.  Smooth all over!</li>
    <li> Works great.  Better than original.</li>
    <li> PREÇO MUITO BOM.&lt;br /&gt;MATERIAL E BOM TMB. ATENDE TODAS AS MINHAS NECESSIDADES. ERA EXATAMENTE O QUE EU PRECISAVA PARA CONSERTAR O MEU BARBEADOR. BOM CUSTO BENEFICIO.&lt;br /&gt;OTIMA ESCOLHA.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t stay attached to razor very good.  It does cut nice though.  Could be just a bad one.  I&#x27;ll still probably purchase another one when needed.</li>
    <li> you are kidding!  It was the correct part</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t have been better. The razor arrived in the days mail and was refreshing to have that smooth glide of a new razor.</li>
    <li> I love it, and will be easier on it....so that it will last longer than the original one.&lt;br /&gt;I love Amazon too for having it.</li>
    <li> Delivered on time and works as expected.. What more can one say.</li>
    <li> My original was damaged from droppage, so this would be a cheaper replacement than buying a new unit. To my surprise, it worked very well. I would almost say it works better, but lets see how long it lasts.</li>
    <li> Mine doesn&#x27;t say anything about bg2000 or 2020 model.  It says for use with model no hq850 and xa2029.</li>
    <li> I like the Bodygroom (although I&#x27;ve had some issue with it as noted in my review of the product). I&#x27;ve been using it and the razor heads for several years. These replacement heads are a necessary evil with this trimmer. I wouldn&#x27;t mind the price so much if they were super-durable, but they are not. I&#x27;ve had issues with multiple heads where the foil screen keeps popping out of of the plastic frame that holds it. It seems to be either a (poor) design or a (shoddy) construction issue, or both. The foil on my most recent head (which I had been using weekly for only 2 months, which btw was a replacement for one where the \\&quot;eyelets\\&quot; that holds the foil screen in the frame broke/ripped) just recently ripped, exposing the razor (this had never happened before). Amazon.com replaced the last one free of charge; we&#x27;ll see if they do so for this one, too, but I can&#x27;t them expect them to continue to do this...especially if I&#x27;m going through several a year. I am not rough with these foil heads: I use the Bodygroom once or twice a week to shave the light growth/stubble on my head. I clean it/remove hair while using and afterwards. For that light usage and at this price point I would expect these to last longer/be more durable. I like not having to lather up to shave my head and not having to worry about nicking myself (a non-issue when using the Bodygroom...on your scalp at least), but for as frequently as I seem to have to replace these heads, the Mach3 and Sensor are less expensive options. I&#x27;ll probably continue using these until I find a better option, but I&#x27;m not all that impressed. 2.5 stars (rounded up b/c of Amazon&#x27;s great customer service).</li>
    <li> item shipped fast as usual thanks amazon. however item inside no longer matches the picture or whats on the box&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;item now has a plastic surround vs metal really disappointed i&#x27;ve purchased these before in the past and im really disappointed that norelco has decided to go even cheaper on these since im only replacing one that broke not for lack of a good shave i can only imagine how long this one will last now.. take it or leave it i guess</li>
    <li> Perfect fit, works great.</li>
    <li> Right product quick ship</li>
    <li> Good, but too expensive for the price I paid.</li>
    <li> Gave my old body groomer new life. Just as described in the seller page. I would buy again in the future to replace dull and old cartridges.</li>
    <li> works. wish it was less expensive. too hard in the delicate curves/area though.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a replacement....and does what it&#x27;s suppose to do. No good, no bad. Just does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
    <li> Have a Philips Norelco BG2020 BodyGroom. It is not identical to the original head, but fits and works great</li>
    <li> They are sturdy and practical. They withstand shock and are smooth on contact. They are satisfactory.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not sharply enough</li>
    <li> Always perfect, on time.</li>
    <li> Sometimes it cuts my face when pressed to hard.</li>
    <li> The replacement foil arrived in a reasonable time and like the little chick on the old baking soda box, it &amp;#34;hasn&#x27;t scratched yet&amp;#34;.  :-)&lt;br /&gt;While it doesn&#x27;t get down and yank pubic hair out by the roots, like I wished it would, it cuts as close as the original.  Maybe it will last longer than the original if I don&#x27;t push so hard on it and avoid using it on my tough facial hair (either I&#x27;m a really grizzled old lady or Maria is just my &#x27;stage name&#x27; LOL)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It fits perfect and while it doesn&#x27;t have a death grip on the trimmer head, it has yet to fall off after a month&#x27;s use.  I&#x27;ve only removed it a few times to look for a build up of pubic whiskers.</li>
    <li> OEM replacement head for the body groomer.  I did notice that this head does not fit as securely as the original head.  Not sure what the reason is for that but sometimes it pops off while I&#x27;m trying to use it.  I feel like I have to be more careful with it than with the original head.</li>
    <li> appreciated the efficiency of the replacement</li>
    <li> I am glad there are replacements available.  Philips Norelco advises to replace the foil  in a year but my first lased over 2 years..</li>
    <li> Fit perfectly. I thought it was a bit pricey, almost as much as the razor itself, but still saved some money.</li>
    <li> My Braun 7505 works better on all of my body parts.  I have no knicks, etc. with the Braun but I have had some problems with the norelco.</li>
    <li> This replacement foil left me smooth in all the right places. I would definitely recommend it as a replacement. I would say that it probably shaves better than the original.</li>
    <li> Great blade works fine as a replacement for body groom sytem. Be sure to disinfect and lube the blade often you can buy a all in one lube and disenfectant spray at beauty supply or disinfect using alcohol and lube with blade lubricant</li>
    <li> My bodygroomer foil was several years old, and wasn&#x27;t working too well. I switched foils with this - and it was immediately back to doing the job right, just like it was new.&lt;br /&gt;Tip: With all electric razors (this one is no exception), use some kind of blade wash and lubricant now and then to keep them clean, sanitized, and functional.</li>
    <li> Practically monopoly in this area. so the review would be that it is good as Philips is the only one that makes it</li>
    <li> This replacement foil is as good as the original foil included with the bodygroom shaver.I can tell no difference other than the replacement foil is newer and shaves better than the worn foil,</li>
    <li> Works great just was hard to find any place around here that sold the replacement part.  Is there a replacement sold for the shaver foil in a pack out there?</li>
    <li> This was my second replacement shaver I&#x27;ve gotten and I&#x27;m very pleased with it. I would recomend this shaver to anyone</li>
    <li> I should have done this months ago...my shaver cuts &amp;#34;like a knife through buttah!&amp;#34;  Like others have said, I hate to throw away stuff that works because it needs a replaceable part, and this while about half the price of a new razor is a great solution.</li>
    <li> the price of this replacement foil is outstanding. i thought this would for sure be too good to be true... but it wasnt.</li>
    <li> The replacement was exactly as described and new.  The shaver is without a doubt the best I&#x27;ve found.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> See summary below that I wrote for my neighbor and that he liked it so much that he purchased one for his nephew.</li>
    <li> This blade lasts an entire year and it shaves like a champ.</li>
    <li> replaced the original blades after 2 years. works great and has been for several months. snapped right in, worked with no issues.</li>
    <li> I tried these replacement foil and I was disappointed that they are not as sharp or good as the original ones that came with my Bodygroom.  They do cut the hair, but only after going over the &#x27;area&#x27; a few times.  Unlike the original that cut after just one passing.</li>
