<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Tattoo kit is amazing. I recommend buying a different foot pedal. Had a defect with my foot pedal since I bought it. Other than that it&#x27;s great</li>
    <li> The power supply went out in 1 hour and i had to but a new one dvd sucks dont buy please dont</li>
    <li> this is the kit which served as an entry to the amazing world of tattoos, really great for a beginner.</li>
    <li> I recieved this very fast and its decent for the price, but when I try to tattoo on the practice skin with either gun it stops vibrating, i was told I was pressing too hard but even when I barely press down with it, the gun will stop. Not sure what the problem is though.</li>
    <li> i ordered this expecting to receive 4 tattoos and twenty inks i only got one machine and 5 inks tell me why</li>
    <li> It is the law and you all know but don&#x27;t care which makes me sick only people 18 and older are allowed to have tattoo guns just ask shelly</li>
    <li> Shipping was not that fast, but overall the product is great.  I also had to purchase additional ink because the ink in the kit was very little.</li>
    <li> I received my order quickly package was not damaged every thing was intact. I&#x27;ve  bought deals like this one in the past from eBay but this is the best by far. Everything that is in the picture is in the box. Comes neatly packed in the carrying  bag. All materials are very good quality. Keep up the great work.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what its designed for. Great price! No comlaints on this product from me. Love it. The disc is very helpful if ur not educated already. Easy step by step learning. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> This is the greatest deal on a tattoo set I have found. The equipment is great and easy to use everything is of excellent quality. I received my order in good time and I am very pleased with this set. I would recommend this to everyone who wants to get a start.</li>
    <li> Our only real complaint is that when the package arrived the transfer oil was empty.  Still a good starter kit</li>
    <li> I have only had this kit 4 days and have already made well over the cost of the machine. Everything seems to be good quality. The only thing is the transfer oil does not work but thats no biggie.</li>
    <li> in the short and sweet i wasnt sure what to expect never doin tats b4 but i got the kit a few books with designs and some trace paper a couple of family members and off i went. the ink is ok not top-notch but its good, power supply works great eventually im gonna upgrade the power supply but for now all in all the kit is great..... i have already ordered atleast another 150 bucks in tat stuff ive had people that my family and i dont even know commenting on how good they think the work detail and color is(stock inks from kit) anyways buy this kit if you are in need of a beginners kit you wont be sorry</li>
    <li> This item shipped quickly and works well. If you plan on purchasing this make sure you have a way to get your stencil on your body. kit does not come with stencils or carbon paper for steciling.&lt;br /&gt;The instruction video is worthless it does not really explain set up and use of this product.</li>
    <li> I just got my tattoo kit wow it got here fast got every thing that it says.the gun works good can&#x27;t wait too tat my self up lol. It got here in a day in ahalf the ink exp in year 2020 lol.</li>
    <li> Over all its a great set up. A better brand of ink would give this kit 5 stars.</li>
    <li> This is a great kit to get you started and making money the machines it comes with are good although the antique machine is heavy and not my style however the other machine is perfect light weight the inks that caqme in this kit are good not the best but a hell of alot better than most ive used overall i would highly recoment this kit</li>
    <li> great kit gives you everything you need i just started tattooing and every one that ive done has came out fine defenitly worth the money the ink is not bad either black is pretty good colers are ok to not that good but not bad i would buy it again</li>
    <li> One of my guns stopped working after one tattoo</li>
    <li> Okay, so I&#x27;m a TOTAL beginner when it comes to tattooing. The one thing I can&#x27;t figure out how to do is HOW to put the disposable tip and the metal tube into the grip??? How do I put them in the grip and have them stable?? Can&#x27;t figure it out for the life of me LOL Can anyone help me out? Email me!    hawa11ansty1e1808@hotmail.com    Thanks all in advance.</li>
    <li> Extremely fast delivery.... great product</li>
    <li> I was very weary as to what i was getting, but i had spent 200$ on 3 small tattoos in the past so i figured it couldnt hurt for 60$.  I love the product, so far i have done 14 tattoos and have more ink and needles on order now.  The only downfall was that the armature bar bolt lock was broken on the liner.  Gun still works 100%, minor adjustments need to be made during the process which isnt a huge deal, it just becomes annoying.  Overall i love the product, and would recommend it to any beginning tattoo artist</li>
    <li> it has been almost 5 days and this item tht i have orderd hasnt even been shipeed out yet and i have concerns of why it has not been shipped off and  need to cantct and fid out why</li>
    <li> i was very happy with my purchase. it was worth the money i paid for it. im very impressed with this tattoo set</li>
    <li> I ordered this as a gift for a friend. He was excited when he received it as it came with everything he needed. However, after literally less than 2 minutes of use the power supply box completely died and would never work again. The only way to get a new one was to exchange the entire kit, which we were not keen on doing as it seemed likely the next one would be crap as well. We bought him a new power box from a local store for $30 and the guns worked, but they are extremely pissy and if everything is not JUST so the needle will not move. The petal is cheap and seems like it will go out soon. It clicks on and off, but does not adjust the speed so we will be replacing that as well. The test skin is total garbage and you are better off using a grape fruit. They are cheap rubber and just sort of rip apart. The ink is OK and what you would expect to come in a cheap kit, but he will be ordering better ink. The tracing paper does not transfer well and comes off almost right away. By the time you are done replacing every thing wrong with this kit you might as well have bought it all seperate to begin with!  I know you get what you pay for, but this time we did not even get that. If I could go back we would get a better kit from the get go or just make the drive to the tattoo shop where we got the new power supply and spend the extra money for better quality.</li>
    <li> perfect item for a even ore perfect price.   came on time, ive been using it ever since its been 1 1/2 months since and ive done 50 tattoos with it   the inks good  needles great  and both guns are perfect</li>
    <li> you get what you pay for. this is cheap and cheap quality. my money was wasted, and my lesson learned.</li>
    <li> I give this kit only 4 stars due to the cd that came with it does not play in any of my players.  Would really like to see what was on the disk.  Other than that the guns are nice and needle set is great!</li>
    <li> This is a funny tattoo kit with very detailed instruction. I asked the customer service and he / she provided me very satisfied answers and make me decided to buy it. Highly recommended tattoo kit here is .</li>
    <li> This product surpass my expectations.my body art and its great&lt;br /&gt;I have 10 tatts now and i want more to</li>
    <li> I ordered My Kit On The 1/6/15 today&#x27;s is the 1/8/15 I got it in Im in with love it works great</li>
    <li> Everything came when it was supposed too; only problem I have is the dvd wont play on an xbox. Other than that I would recommend this kit as practice before buying something more expensive an better.</li>
    <li> I got my package in the mail a couple of days ago, and i love it. I&#x27;ve already done several tattoos. The guns work great, i ordered extra ink and have not yet used the ink that came with the kit, but I&#x27;m sure i will like it!!! I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase!!!</li>
    <li> I just ordered it and i hope it will live up to it&#x27;s reviews. I looked at allot of different kits before choosing this one and all the ones iv&#x27;e seen all had negative things to say about the ink. So i bought that separately. I chose Starbrite after hearing good things about it for around 30$. Also i heard this doesn&#x27;t have soap so i ordered some of that too. I got a gallon. i don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s too much, like i said this is m first kit. I have tattooed before but everything was already set up for me. i can&#x27;t wait till it gets here. Any tips anyone can give me i would appreciate.</li>
    <li> got my kit today, ordered it the 10th, got it the 14th, everything seems real nice and everything is there that they say comes with the kit, BUT, the instructional dvd has to have programs downloaded to watch it only on your computer, and half of the videos or info cant even be opened, also doesnt have any even basic written instructions for all of the unlabeled equipment, excited as all hell to use the guns, good for just startin up if youve seen others doing it.</li>
    <li> I got this for my brother for Christmas. I have no tattoo experience, but he loves the gun. It took a little time getting used to because he was used to homemade guns. Putting the gun together was simple and he was ready to tattoo that day. I only knocked off 1 star because the carrying case is useless and the DVD is very poor quality.</li>
    <li> Great tattoos nephew loves it</li>
    <li> Just got this kit and it has almost everything you need.  The machines and inks are good and get the job done.  All that was missing was some green soap, real (pig) practice skin, and transfer paper.  The practice \\&quot;skins\\&quot; are rubber and not that good, while the \\&quot;transfer oil\\&quot; smells like (and probably is) nail polish remover.  The included VCD didn&#x27;t help much either.  I have a copy of Huck Spauldings Art of Tattooing that provided way more info.  I did a tattoo on myself and it turned out great.  Overall, the price was a bargain.  The machines alone were worth it.</li>
    <li> Everything came sealed and works fine I like it all the inks work ok guns might need tunning power box works fine im happy with it</li>
    <li> The kit arrived 2days earlier than expected. Everything in the kit came wrapped, and in prestine shape. The only complaint that I have about the product is that I received an empty bottle of transfer oil and I can not play the DVD in my PS3, XBOX360 or my Computer :-(. Overall a good kit for the price.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY THIS KIT (or at least from this seller)!!!! The inks are watery and from Taiwan, which are known to be extremely unsafe, the practice skins are useless, the power supply is of the lowest possible quality, but the most important thing here is that the tattoo machines are NO GOOD!!!!! When I first got the kit, I tested both of them and both capacitors blew up on the lowest power setting. I returned the machines and got two new ones, and again, I tested them and what do you know?....One of the capacitors blew up again. All in all this whole kit is \\&quot;made in china\\&quot; (the land of knock-offs). I guess I got what I paid for, right? Cough up more cash and buy American made kits, which are more expensive, but are of way better quality.</li>
    <li> Bought in 2012 for my sister. Complaints were mainly with the quality of the practice skins. The inks were sufficient for learning and practicing, but probably not for a real live human. All-in-all, very learner-y oriented kit. Can&#x27;t remember and not sure of current pricing, but I believe this was/is a good deal to get all the individual components together to start.</li>
    <li> Very nice kit, came with everything you could really need. Even came with its own bag to hold everything in. The DVD(VCD) that comes with the kit is ok, basically just shows a guy tattooing some people, explains how to set up, and some shading techniques. I wouldnt use the vcd as your primary source of learning.</li>
    <li> the machines themselves are average  and the trace paper is awesome  same with the needles. but  the lack of needles  is frustrating,  the quality of ink is horrible  and worst of all the &amp;#34; instructional“  DVD is nothing more than a guy giving a tattoo not explaining a  thing.  if it wasn&#x27;t for the power  supply and machines being as decent as they are this would be getting one start.</li>
    <li> I was completely ignorant of anything to do with tattooing when i purchased this, but with this kit (and youtube videos) I am pretty comfortable being on both sides of the needle. It&#x27;s also worth mentioning that this kit costs less than a tattoo at most professional shops, and yields infinite tattoos (give or take). Great purchase!</li>
    <li> Got this today and did not even try to come on power suppy shows power but gun is not even twitching waste of my money</li>
    <li> Just got the kit in today and everything that they offered was sent. I tried everything out and it all works great.. I think one of the machines is a little heavy, but definately doable.. I think this kit is great for a starter kit. I cant wait to start with my first tattoo. Ill leave another review after the finish of my project..</li>
    <li> Power supply is crap but its a good starter supply kit. I received a different machine then pictured, a buddha, but it looks and performs well. Good deal for price.</li>
    <li> I just got my kit in the mail and Iam thrilled about it .....it is everything and more..I would recomend this to any one it is well worth the money I got everything the kit had to offer.and when I need anything else I will order from here.</li>
    <li> goo product, only problem was the power supply, but amazon quickly gave me a 30% refund, and ordered a dual power supply(works great), everything else with the kit was of good quality and works great</li>
    <li> goooooood and on time forreal guys its worth it for ur first tattoo machine its good for starters go get it</li>
    <li> If you need a tattoo kit, look no further. This has everything you need. From rookie to pro. I bought this as a surprise for my roommate, he&#x27;s quitting his job soon.</li>
    <li> Just got mine, the day after I ordered it. Everything looks great. I will be trying out the colors very soon. I&#x27;m super excited.</li>
    <li> This is truly an amazing package giving you everything it claims and a major feed of happiness. Im a tattoo artist myself and i highly reccomend this for anyone looking to buy</li>
    <li> I got this for my friend, he says it&#x27;s great.  But the packaging could be better.  But I guess that is what you get for this price.</li>
    <li> Obviously, if you had read other reviews you can tell that this kit is not professional. Good for beginning and practicing but not professional by any means.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Generous price for a starting kit&lt;br /&gt;-Unique looking liner and shader gun&lt;br /&gt;-Many disposable needles at various sizes&lt;br /&gt;-Nice for practice, not actual tattooing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Very poor ink performance, fades quick, not impressive colours&lt;br /&gt;-Poor power source (sometimes gives out)&lt;br /&gt;-Very flimsy &amp;#34;practice sheets&amp;#34; (Not even close to real skin)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, you should expect the pros and cons listed above, as this is a $60 kit. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> do not buy if you are not a licensed you need to work in a tattoo shop! and go through a training to use all of this stuff    artist[...]</li>
    <li> Did 3 tattoos the same day it arrived! It is not supposed to have guns that look like ones used in professional shops. It is an at home kit! Some things about it seem cheap like  the foot pedal which is plastic and only goes on and off and doesnt control speed. You can just set your speed on the digital sreen of your box. Also the transfer oil sucks and does smell like nail polish. We just used clear deoderent on skin and laid transfer on top and applied it to the top of the transfer also. Worked like a charm! The inks were not too bad either. I think it comes with everything you need to start tattooing at home!</li>
    <li> Everything working fine.. just hope the power supply losts for good time</li>
    <li> The digital box didn&#x27;t work</li>
    <li> Great product for a great price. Guns work great for beginners! I&#x27;ve done numerous of tattoos with it and had no problem with the equipment! Came in with everything shown above and was delivered on time! Once again great buy for great price</li>
    <li> when i got it only one gun worked and the gun to shade in tattoos didnt and still doesnt work i tryed to fix it but couldnt !</li>
    <li> Everything worked! I&#x27;ve payed 3x the price before for half as good equipment from other online suppliers  ...I&#x27;m quite happy with this order.</li>
    <li> As soon as I received it I started practicing on the practice skin, then my own arm and it works just fine! I&#x27;m still getting used to it, but I was already able to improve in just a couple of days. I basically draw with it everyday since and I could highly recommend it for beginners!</li>
    <li> I received this right on time and he was very pleased with the gift. I will be working with thm again for any tattoo needs I may get</li>
    <li> I Absolutely LOVE This Product. Since I&#x27;ve Had It I&#x27;ve Done 6 Tattoo&#x27;s And They Are Amazing. The Shipping For This Product Was Quick And Swift. Just AMAZING! I Recommend This To Anyone!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with my product, I&#x27;ve had no issues and look forward to tattoo much more in the future and its great for starters! Overall everything was good, Shipping was better thsn expected!</li>
    <li> You can make what this cost by doing one TATT. Then after a few, go pro. Spalding and Rogers I still use. Good deal for the buck.</li>
    <li> Let Me Start Out By Saying I Did NOT Purchase, This Kit. However as a Shop Owner... Here is My Advice : As  Follows ;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  In My Opinion I would not buy a \\&quot; TATTOO KIT \\&quot; although it does have some advantages it gives you a head start on supplies you will need. Typically Kits are over priced &amp; do not contain equipment that will last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First Thing get a good book to start out with a good book - Tattooing from A-Z by Huck Spaulding. amazon.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You Can Buy Every Thing that is in a Kit, Individually. Generally of higher quality that will last you a good while in your new career.&lt;br /&gt;Personally I would look at: Amazon, amozon.com :  Alie Express, alieexpress.com,  DH Gate, dhgate.com. They typically all offer free shipping.&amp; Guarantee you will receive your products.  I would look at quality Chinese Machines &amp; Power Supplies, Clip Cords, Foot Switch, etc.. You can buy quality if you know what to look for &amp; save 90% off retail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.)  Look for quality built machines, Constructed of either, Cast Iron, Cast Brass, Cast Copper, Cast Steel. They will hold up longer &amp; generally have a truer frame geometry. C.N.C. Machined, machines hyper accurate, high quality. constructed of Air craft Aluminum, Aluminum, Steel, Brass, Copper. High quality CNC machines. Cast Iron tends to run a little cooler.  Stay a way from Stamped Metal Chines Frames.they are Fubarbed from the get-go. When ran for extended times. $5.00 to $20 each. Note However with Chinese Rotary Machines They are generally as good as the real ones. Know what to look for, we will get to that. Coil Machines Most Chinese Coil machines will need to be rebuilt. New Coils, $25.00 Capacitor, $1.00, 47 uf is a good rating for beginners. for all coil machines.  New Armature Bar, $1.00 to $6.00, New Springs,$1.00 to $5.00 a set. So Say $7.00 machine + the parts &#x3D; $30 to $35 a piece is about right total. investment. Worth about $300 to $350.00 each. Wow! You can also buy knock off&#x27;s. So Quality &amp; Looks.  You Tube Channels with Information on this. Undergrounddemographix, Frame geometry for beginners talks about which Chines Machines are good. SinCityTattooz, Disc 1 &amp; 2  #1. Tuning Your Machines. #2.Rebuilding your Chinese Machines.  SUPPLIERS THAT HAVE GOOD PARTS FOR CHINESE MACHINES: Monster Steel,[...] &amp; Infinite Irons, [...] , Both have quality parts, for Rebuilding Your Chinese Coil Tattoo Machines. Click on top page for more of my reviews for information on how to rebuild coil tattoo machines &amp; rotary machine reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.) Power Supplies:  Knock offs.  * Look at Hurricane, $35.00 about 80% less than the real one. * Eikon $100.00 about a third of the real one.  * Led Read out Dual Machine $20 or less only voltage read out.. Basic, no read out &amp;  only one machine hook up. $7.00. *  IMO buy the Hurricane or The Monster Point -  Dual Machine Led read out. Both the Hurricane &amp; Eikon&#x27;s have not only volts, but amps, duty cycle, the ability to make the foot-switch a  \\&quot;Constant \\&quot; on or off. That means one click &amp; it&#x27;s on &amp; another one &amp; it&#x27;s off. Very useful. Once you have tattooed for awhile you will see what&#x27;s meant here. Also a timer for time tattooing. If you charge by the hour. Then there you no arguing from client it is on the screen. These features are not necessary but are nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.) Clip Cord:  $1.00 to $20.00. The $1.00 is a good quality one stick with at least a 5&#x27; clip cord most 6&#x27;  The Dollar ones will not have the positive Terminal Marked. Typically both leads are black. Buy a Voltage Meter &amp; Learn how to use it. FREE INFORMATION: You Tube Channels - Sin City Tattooz &amp; UnderGroundDemaGraphix, They both have videos on this &amp; tons more. The meter can be used for a multitude of things in tattooing. Mark the Positive Lead with Red Nail Polish. &amp; Save about $18.00 which you use to purchase your voltmeter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.) Foot Switch:  $3.00 to $50.00  \\&quot; A good price is about $5.00. \\&quot;  *  IMO Look for the Stainless Steel Round FootPedal with black rubber pad in the middle. Nice heavy construction.  *&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5.) Needles, Monster Point, [...] they also go by Piercing Pros on Amazon.com.  Quantity 50 - assorted  Tattoo Needles, about $8.00  That&#x27;s CHEAP &amp; I have gotten Specials on Amazon for 100 Needles $10.25 That is dirt Cheap. &amp; Monster Point Makes High Quality Needles. They also sell  Tattoo Supplies, piecing supplies &amp; Jewelry.  Great Company to deal with they really go that extra mile. More Expensive Needles Due to Sponsoring Artist &amp; doing Tattoo Conventions. But Good Quality.[...] - They sell needles &amp; supplies +supplies  for making your own needle groupings, Box of 50 about $25.00  Mithra,[...], They sell  needles Tattoo Supplies &amp; Materials for making your own needle groupings. Box of 50 about $25.00 So IMO Stick with Monster Point.  a Jewelers Eye Loop. Dh Gate, Alie Express, Amazon Most say. 5 X &amp; 15 X  &amp; 22X, I Say Get 1 like Get a 10X &amp;  30-60X  or higher with built in Led Lights. about $3.00 to $15.00. This is a must for checking needle, groupings for damage. Also a painters razor blade or a barbers. One side Flat &amp; smooth so you can hold it. The other a thin, blade. For Separating needle groupings. Additionally a watch makers set of glasses built in lights. good for seeing intricate details. Following the needle tips when tattooing. About $ 1.00 to $8.00.  Same Amazon, Alie-Express, DH Gate.  This is a Huge Tip!&lt;br /&gt;Next: You-Tube Channel undergrounddemagraphix has a great video on Tattoo Needles. The Best I have see. &amp; You-Tube Channel tattoolan has a great video on making your own. Monster Steel, Needle Jig &amp; Mithra all sell Jigs &amp; supplies for making your own. However unless you are making Mag&#x27;s you can not readily purchase say a 50 mag. Cost wise it is not worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6.) Tubes &amp; Tube Grips. Amazon. you can find tube grips for about $5 to about $50.00 I would look at buying a set. They Typically have a set of say 7 tubes Aluminum or Stainless Steel,for $7.00. That is Cheap. U.S. Made usually about that much for just 1 Tube Grip.  * Tube Tips look for a set Typically like 22 in a set Stainless Steel about $20.00 to $200.00. Again Amazon or DhGate or alie Express about $10.00 to $20.00 for a set of 22, Stainless Steel ones That is Cheap. You can also buy disposables. But I would stick with the Stainless Steel Tips &amp; Aluminum or stainless steel grips. They are able to be sterilized &amp; re-used like a dental instrument.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7.) Spirt Master Paper:for Transferring stencils to skin.  Stick With Spirt Master, it sticks better &amp; last longer Than Plain Carbon Paper. 25 sheets about $8.00  on Amazon. You Can also buy hecto-graph pencils, quantity 12 in a box. about $8.00. This not Necessary. Just The Paper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8.) Green Soap - Cheapest Supplier: Superior Tattoo supply, [...] or amazon A Gallon about $14.00. This will make several gallons. However I do not use it I use an Ant-Bacterial Soap diluted with water. Like dial Anti bacterial soap.  Far Cheaper &amp; works better. Dollar store, Wal-Mart, etc... Also Hipiclens CVS Wal-Mart, Amazon. USED BY DOCTORS BEFORE SURGERY. I use Hipiclens before tattoo &amp; to clean off at end in a spray bottle. You-Tube Channel Hipiclens. for information,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9.)  Medical Supplies : Alcohol 70%,  Witch-Hazel,  Dollar store, Wal-Mart, K-Mart, etc... $1.00 each. Sterile Water , 250 ml about $10.00, Amazon or  - Medical Supply house look up on Google.  or you could use Distilled Water, Drug Store, Wal-Mart.  [...], Dry-Lock Medical Pads, 4\\&quot; X 7\\&quot;  Quantity  25 Pack about $5.00 This is the best &amp; What Doctors use for open wounds. It allows air to get to the Tattoo &amp; does not stick to it. Superior Tattoo Supply or Amazon or Drug Store. Quantity 10,  3\\&quot; X 4\\&quot;  about $4.00 Also Non Stick Gauze.  Not Necessary but nice, You can also get some Diapers Cheap Wal-Mart. &amp; Wrap over Bandaged area for more Cushion. A&amp;D Ointment. a small tube about $1.00 or Vaseline, I like A&amp;D Ointment. After you have been tattooing a while you can get it in larger quantities. Anti-Bacterial Ointment. $1.00, Dollar Store, Wal-Mart, drug Store etc.  Disposable Razors, 1 Use Only ! $1.00 for a pack of 5 to 10. Sharps Medical Waste Container for Dirty Needles. About $5.00. Check with your state health Dept. some allow Used Coffee Containers, &amp; they Are Free. Just Print up a Paper Label on your Computer That Says Medical Waste Sharpz Container. Dispose of as required by your State.  Check your State Health Dept. Also superior tattoo supply has a section on that on their site. Medical Gloves Latex &amp; or Nitrite Gloves.  I Have both. reason some people have latex allergies. a box of 100 is about $10.00. Also [...]has a medical glove size chart. Amazon also carries these, Wal-Mart etc.  Individually Wrapped  Wooden Tongue Depressors, Only Buy them Individually Wrapped. Sterile. 500 for about $10.00  Sundry Jars, $5.00 to $35.00 each,  Amazon, Wal-Mart,Drug Store, Craft store, superior tattoo supply.  For Storing Tongue Depressors, Ink Caps, etc... small med lg &amp; ex lag ink caps so  4 jars for them &amp; 1 for the tongue depressors. Use the tongue depressors to put lotion ointment etc. on client. 1 time use throw away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 10.) Nalgene Wash Bottles - Spray Bottles : about $5.00 each if you get these spend the difference &amp; pay about $10.00 each &amp; get the anti-siphon, ones. Much Better. Personally I like Spray Bottles. They are faster neater cleaner &amp; Cheaper. About $3.00 each. It&#x27;s a personal choice some use one or the other. Some Artist use a combination of both. You put your anti-bacterial soap, Sterile Water or Distilled Water, Alcohol, Witch-Hazel, in these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;11.) Stencil Transfer Agent : Stencil Magic, Stencil Stuff, or Make it your self, It Can Be Made Far Better &amp; Cheaper Than Store Bought. Any Deodorant Stick, Most use Speed Stick. Melt in Micro-Wave about 20 seconds.  Add Aloe Vera gel,The with ladocaine is best. Witch-Hazel, either 70% rubbing alcohol or Anti Bacteria Hand Cleaner gel, a little Bactine. Bactine that you use for cuts sun burns etc. Stir When it comes out of Micro-Wave. Do I Need to say remove the speed stick from the container? Add other ingredients stir. This Works Better, Last Longer, I have tested all products side by side scrub test this wins no contest. &amp; if the Deodorant is scented it smells good as well. Videos on How to Make:  on You-Tube - Sin City Tattooz  &amp; Under Ground Demo Graphix. Both Great For Education on Tattooing. These 2 Channels are by far the Best. Click my reviews on top of this page. I have a recipe listed in my stencil stuff review. That is Cheaper, Better, Longer Lasting &amp; Safer. Than Stencil Stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;12.) After Care. Some Use A&amp;D as after care as well as to Tattoo with some use a Tripple Anti-Bacteria Ointment. Some use Noxema, Some Coconut Oil, Others a Cream or Aloe Vera.  Bag Balm, Others a specific product for Tattoo After Care. Some States Require a Antibiotic Ointment Be applied.  I Typically use the Antibiotic Ointment on Client when they leave. &amp; A&amp;D To Tattoo with. &amp; Recommend That They Use Pure Coconut Oil The Kink that is in a paste in the Health Food Store. You Eat it Cook with it. Use for skin. It has natural Healing &amp; Antibiotic Qualities to it. Look This up on Line. NEXT VERY IMPORTANT.. FOLLOW WHAT YOUR STATE SAYS THE PROPER PROCEDURE IS... Next If you are in a Shop FOLLOW WHAT YOUR MENTOR TELLS You To Do..  It is not business if you tattoo in a shop or at home. That is a choice that you must make. IMOP A Shop Will Be a Better Environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;13.) Cleaning Supplies: Paper Towels, Clorox Bleach Wipes, 70% Alcohol,  Dollar Store Wal-Mart. Ultra Sonic Cleanser Solution, Meda Cide or  Cavi Cide, about $25.00 a gallon. Superior Tattoo Supplies, Amazon.com, That will last a while. Clear Plastic Wrap, Aluminum Foil, Plastic Bags,  Dollar Store, Wal-Mart, K-Mart, or you can buy barrier bags etc Much Cheaper my way &amp; works fine. You Bag your Tattoo Machine Sandwich Bag, Foot switch same.  Bag Your Bottles same or a larger size bag.  Plastic Wrap, Wrap Your Chair, The Tattoo Table, The Chair the client sits in, your clip cord the foot switch cord, bag the front part of power supply.  Dental shield for you disposable, Breathing Mask Medical. For you Do not breath or spit on the clients tattoo area this must be a sterile field.  Paper Towels on Clients Chair taped down . medical tape for bandages &amp; or Scotch Tape, for bandages, the clients chair,taping bags shut on bottom of machine on bottles etc. Leave back of machine bag open for air.  Dental Bibs for station. Aluminum Foil Line Tray That goes on Station first with plastic wrap, then foil. Makes Clean up easier. Lysol Spray Disinfectant spray or Wal-Mart Brand Dollar store Brand. Spray Area after Cleaning &amp; before tattooing to air borne germs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;14.) Ink Caps. Small, Medium, Large. about $5.00 for 500 ink cups. Amazon.com, superior tattoo supply Superior Tattoo Supply, Monster Steel.[...] I prefer the clear ones. monstersteel &amp; Amazon the cheapest followed by superior. Also for Larger Needle Groupings you can use fast food condiment cups. Price FREE.  Make sure They are Clean. Before using with gloves on wipe all caps out with an anti bacterial wipe or rubbing alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;15.) Tattoo Ink, also called pigment. BUY THE BEST.

    <li> This kit is the best deal on the internet period. Comes with just about everything you need. Easy to assemble. Inks are okay but not horrible. I&#x27;m happy with the product and the seller is awesome.</li>
    <li> The stencil paper is rubbish - I bought new stencil paper from another vendor and that paper works a million times better. The transfer fluid doesn&#x27;t work at all. Dettol works way better. The inks provided in this kit are rubbish. I bought some Kuro Sumi outlining black ink. Honestly I&#x27;m starting with no experience in tattooing, especially with a gun/machine. I bet if I worked with a more expensive, more well built machine I&#x27;d think this machine is rubbish, too. Save your money in the long-term and buy something with a more substantial power supply, and a better build for the gun.</li>
    <li> At the time of purchase this seemed like a good buy. Personally I know nothing about the art of tattooing aside from what I have seen while getting my own tattoos done (professionally). This package was purchased for a good laugh among my fraternity brothers saying that whoever passed out would get tattooed, a step up from sharpie. All jokes aside this product seemed solid until I went to go watch the instructional DVD. The company claims it will show you how to put the set together and use the machine, it doesn&#x27;t. The &amp;#34;DVD&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t play on a laptop, DVD player, Xbox, or playstation. 6 months after purchase the machine is still in its original box untouched aside from a layout after receiving the package. I suppose this is a decent buy if you are too cheap to go get real tattoos done. Machine came with all the ad said (see product details).</li>
    <li> This is the best Christmas present my son got this year! He loved it and is on the road to becoming a great tattoo artist. This kit comes with EVERYTHING you need to get started.</li>
    <li> The power supply works like it should, both machines feel comfortable, it comes with a generous assortment of spare materials(rubber bands, needles, etc.) and is a reliable kit so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did notice the setting on my power supply dropped a couple of decimal points all by itself in the middle of a tattoo, which made things difficult. All I had to do was turn it up a little and its held true ever since.</li>
    <li> the item came stupid quick, everything was in the box....skin sucks should of kept that and sent more tips...but i never done a tattoo....it came i tuned, and WALA TATTOO!</li>
    <li> good price. however the ink SUCKS you need better ink. it also doesn&#x27;t include transfer oil. the skins are nice quality. i had fun playing around with this.</li>
    <li> I got the priduct but i cant get the gun to work my power supply is turned on and everything it just wont work i dont know what te problem is</li>
    <li> it has all items it says it has, it would be great for a beginning artist. the ink stands up well but it&#x27;s not the best, all needles of course are sterile, it&#x27;s a pretty low key power supply and foot pedal one machine was great but the other just didn&#x27;t stand as well. Practice skins were not used but have used the same quality practice skins before and you would bee better off using pig skin or and orange to practice on. I myself watched the dvd included and it didn&#x27;t teach anything it just showed someone tattooing, I found that pretty disappointing and was so glad my friend wasn&#x27;t going to need/ or watch it.</li>
    <li> I had expedited shipping and used this machine a few times now on myself and it works great been a month or two and the ink seems fine but I would recommend getting some top quality ink but to me it was a great buy for the price.</li>
    <li> I chose the free shipping option and i recieved my package in 2 days! I have not used it yet but all of the items described are there and it was packaged nicely. I am very please with the quality and shipping of this item. I am so excited to start using it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been meaning to get into tattooing for a while. Expenses have been tight so it was a tough choice to kill $60.00 for a starter kit. Typically when it comes to eqpuiment like this you get what you pay for. However, this was money well spent! The order arrived two days early : ) All of the equipment was accounted for and sterlized appropriately. I tried the machines out last night, they work great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is in the beginners DVD...I&#x27;ve been tattooed quite a bit, however don&#x27;t spend my time in the shop staring at the equipment lol. The DVD was VERY brief about assembly and proper cleaning and sanitation technique, and was relatively outdated. It wasn&#x27;t useless, however wasn&#x27;t the greatest for a beginner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I put all of the loose ends together, not much problem. Researched cleaning and sanitation, already tattooed myself, and am very optimistic. For the cost, this prdouct has really come through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> everything came as described with the package  only problem i am having is that the power supply is not sending power to the gun</li>
    <li> It is a good starting kit. It came perfectly on time,packaged very well. Only issues I&#x27;ve had so far is,  no oil in the transfer oil bottle at all and The video wasn&#x27;t very helpful. But the Machines themselves and power supply work well, a little catchy sometimes but very good. Certainly comes with everything you need, and a lot of it. I would recommend it for anyone for their first kit, but you might want to get a new carrying case because my first time opening it the zipper came undone.</li>
    <li> Love my new kit, it&#x27;s perfectly weighted and runs smoothly and quietly. I&#x27;ll be buying another one from this company for sure!</li>
    <li> By checking most of the popular tattoo kit online, which include amazon and other platforms, I commit myself to write reviews on multiple tattooing products. This tattoo kit k03 from ordertattoo is one of those in my list.&lt;br /&gt;To be qualify as a completed tattoo kit, it have to comes with all the basic equipment and tools that can finishing a tattoo job from beginning to the end, which means it have to provide all the tools that can do this: copy a pattern to the stencil paper, transfer the pattern to the skin, something u can practice or make adjustment on, make outliner, make shader.&lt;br /&gt;So you need stencil paper, transfer oil, tattoo needles, tattoo guns, power supply to operate the tattoo guns, clip cord and power pedal power supply to tattoo guns, practice skin.  Tattoo Kit K03 from Ordertattoo have meet these requirements, It provide more needles than basic needed, it provide accessories for future needed, both tattoo guns are 10 coils which make it good for shader and liner.&lt;br /&gt; 5 Stars so far. hope my guidelines are helpful and good luck on your shopping</li>
    <li> Everything that came in the kit was pretty impressive for the price, i would reccomemd to buy some items seperate though 1. Better power supply 2. Better inks 3. Stencil goo 4. Stencil paper &amp; better machines, basicly just buy everything seperate instead of the kit, but great starter kit if your new to tattooing &amp; packaging was safe &amp; secure &amp; fast</li>
    <li> For a starter kit it&#x27;s not half bad.  But I would suggest for someone to do some more digging for a better quality kit.  You get what you pay for.  The machines aren&#x27;t bad for starters.  The ink is tough, the practice skins are not good at all (they don&#x27;t retain the ink very well), the tools are handy, all the other items are very helpful.  The DVD is old and the quality of it is horrid.  But overall if you&#x27;ve done your research and are just beginning, this kit should treat you well</li>
    <li> This is an awesome kit for beginners at a great price. The two tattoo machines work flawlessly for their intended purpose, though the shading machine is a bit too heavy but that&#x27;s not a huge problem. The kit comes with everything you need to get started, though I highly recommend against using these &amp;#34;Sakura&amp;#34; inks on anyone&#x27;s skin. They work fine for practice on fake skins or oranges, but they do not hold well at all in real skin and will turn out splotchy and faded if you use them for actual tattoos. I know because I did a couple tattoos with them and they did not turn out that great. I bought a 19 color set from Radiant Inks for $79 as well as a 12 oz bottle of Intenze Zuper Black ink for $32 and they work very well and have done some pretty sweet tattoos since with these inks. Another problem with this kit is the plastic disposable tips that come with it are not actually in sterilized packages, they&#x27;re just thrown in a little ziplock bag and therefore are not sterilized and probably aren&#x27;t very safe to do tattoos with if you want to be legitimate. I recommend buying extra tips that are individually packaged and e.o. gas sterilized like the needles are. The practice skins that come with the kit are fine for practicing line work and such, but are nothing like real skin and so aren&#x27;t of much help, but they do help get the hang of using the machine. You cannot shade on them at all so don&#x27;t even try. Oranges are much better to practice on as you can actually do shading on them. Lastly, the foot pedal that comes with this is not very good, you have to click it in to turn on your machine and then click it again to turn off the machine and this is not how it should be, you want a pedal that you hold down with your foot to run the machine and lift up to stop it. You can purchase a much better foot pedal for around 5 bucks so this isn&#x27;t a big deal. These are all minor issues so don&#x27;t let this scare you away, this kit has a great value for the price so I definitely do recommend it, but you will most likely have to spend a good deal more money to get everything needed if you want to actually do a good amount of tattoos. Everything else about the kit is great. Comes with plenty of grommets and rubber bands, a decent amount of assorted needles, a good ink cap holder, a good amount of ink caps, 2 sheets of stencil transfer paper, and 2 practice skins. Also metal tips that I would not use if you don&#x27;t have an autoclave, and between 10-15 disposable tips. Overall an awesome kit, I have gotten a good amount of use out of it so far with no issues. If you have any questions don&#x27;t hesitate to ask.o recommend it, but you will most likely have to spend a good deal more money to get everything needed if you want to actually do a good amount of tattoos.

    <li> It was a great buy. It was a anniversary present and it showed up three days early. I am very pleased with this perchase.</li>
    <li> the kit is amazing, love the guns and everything else it comes with. im very happy with this purchase, deff a great buy for the price.</li>
    <li> I liked the kit alot I will be purchasing another one very shortly</li>
    <li> I got this as a birthday present for my boyfriend and he loves it. He can&#x27;t wait to put it touse. I would have given 5 stars if it came with instructions to put together,thank God for utube. Also the ink is poor quality but that&#x27;s minor. Overall,I&#x27;m happy. Plus it came like in less than 24 hours.i ordered it at 11 pm on the 10th and got it 4:30pm on the 11th.</li>
    <li> But is it all sanitized (beware)? The needles are packed individually but everything else leaves the mind to wonder if it is safe. I had to end up buying disposable tips and tips with grips because I don&#x27;t have a sterilizing equipment and didn&#x27;t want to take the chance. So if you are in the same vote as me it would be a good Idea to do the same. Also I ordered all the other basic needs green soap/bottle,disposable tips/plus disposable tips with grips, practice skin, Sharps bio container, stencil paper, and MOST IMPORTANT QUALITY INK MADE IN USA (Starbrite) The Sakura ink is GARBAGE (colors are way off and its watery) if you are using for practicing it may be ok but that may not be a really good idea as you wont know how the colors work unless you order better ones made in USA!</li>
    <li> The service is amazing. We received our equipment on time as promised. Our equipment works to our satisfaction. I will be ordering from this company again soon. I give them a big thumbs up as far as customer satisfaction. Awesome you guys are really awesome! Thank you so much and you will have our business again very soon!</li>
    <li> This item is awesome because it came with everything needed to get started and so much more. Its simple enough tp use and for the price it cant be beat!</li>
    <li> F***ing di** heads sent me 1 gun and half the ink was missing and it was so cheap. What the hell am i suppose to do tattoo with just the needles.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if i would consider this a waste of money because i got to practice tattooing at a small price. I was hoping for at least a decent product, not the best, obviously, but at least a functioning one. The machine crashed and was very weak. The inks were not great either, although I did not use all of them. (the green was ok?)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s what it said it was. Keep up the good work, look forward to getting more from this particular seller.</li>
    <li> i like tgis product i use it for tattoing on leather and it works great for that so thank you</li>
    <li> It was return because of a filt breakup but it was exactly what she wanted and would have loved it</li>
    <li> The kit shipped very fast and there was no damage to the box (boxes because they ship nested which seems like an added security) It actually comes with a little carrying case. I have had no problems with the skins, If you go too deep they do rip but you should only be working with the top layers of skin anyway. I have not used the transfer paper yet, The only problem I had with this kit was the lack of instructions. If the seller could make a new DVD It would be perfect. I&#x27;d suggest watching this playlist on YouTube it helped me a lot.[...]  Overall It&#x27;s a great kit if you want to see if tattooing is right for you and I would definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> I enjoy every part of this kit except the inks. Everything worked great but the inks were not that good.</li>
    <li> I love everything about this kit except the DVD its terrible quality and doesn&#x27;t really give any helpful information your just watching some guy tattoo (free-handed) on some Asian chick and its stupid and time wasting it didn&#x27;t show how to put the gun together or set anything up i had to go find something on YouTube to help me set up my kit and attempt to start practicing and the tattoo skins that came with it are too advanced for a beginner tattooer. So hope this was helpful. its worth the buy and its neat to have my own tattoo guns and kit and whatnot.</li>
    <li> the ink is good and the guns are great :) must buy for a starter</li>
    <li> While I don&#x27;t know much about tattooing I got this as a gift for my brother for his apprenticeship and he loved it. Aside from the ink which he said is good for practicing and not really the best for people&#x27;s skin he loved it.</li>
    <li> Just as described.  Tanks.</li>
    <li> The power box doesn&#x27;t work I&#x27;ve tried it alote of times and it still won&#x27;t work and also the stencil paper is messed up.</li>
    <li> It came here rather quickly and it is like the perfect beginners kit if you wanna start tattooing. All in all, I was pretty satisfied.</li>
    <li> perfect item for a even ore perfect price.&lt;br /&gt;came on time, ive been using it ever since its been 1 1/2 months since and ive done 50 tattoos with it&lt;br /&gt;the inks good&lt;br /&gt;needles great&lt;br /&gt;and both guns are perfect</li>
    <li> bought this set to get me going and to learn about the parts of the machine. I have done five tattoos with it. on the six tattoo the machine power started to jump around a lot making it harder to control. I recommend this set to any  learning or who wants to give tattooing a try</li>
    <li> Works so well that my ex boyfriend stole it from me, to bad the paper work from here doesn&#x27;t prove that it belongs to me.</li>
    <li> My uncle absolutely loved this! He started tattooing immediately. Thanks to this, I&#x27;ve got four new tattoos. So glad I was able to add to my collection!</li>
    <li> people when you buy tattoo kit make sure it is American made  this crape should be way cheaper an I know some of you wonder or not about why the machines get hot so quick because the coils are metal not carper and the ink is not that good, I would buy moms tattoo ink one of the best inks out there also American made not china not all things are bad from china still would not trust it, some of the makers of these knockoffs get up here to make it sound good just to make a quick buck, I hold strong on these words  (buy  American made)</li>
    <li> it could have came with more stencil paper but other than that i love it</li>
    <li> My shipment came in yesterday and i expected it today! So that was really cool. It came with everything as described,one thing i would complain about would be, what&#x27;s with the crappy &amp;#34;instruction video&amp;#34; ? It doesn&#x27;t show how to even put the kit together and with this being a &amp;#34;beginner&amp;#34; tattoo machine i figured it would be much more informative and that&#x27;s really upsetting. Their was a cheaper kit on Amazon and i figured this one must be worth the little more. I suggest getting the cheaper one since you&#x27;re paying more for nothing. All in all i&#x27;d give it a 4 really a 3 1/2 because without the video,i have to find out myself how to help my husband put it together and this was his gift. So yea , i can&#x27;t review the ink or anything else because i can&#x27;t put it together!!!!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this on Friday got it Sunday afternoon and let me tell you, I have given my self 11 tattoos in the past 5 days this kit is bomb, I never had a tattoo or have done one and just watched some YouTube videos and jumped right in, really I have nothing but positivity for this kit, I have a new power supply coming and another machine cause you can only hook up on machine to the box so but really for the price grab one!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a gift for my husband. He won&#x27;t be home until April. But, everything seems to be in good shape. Everything that is listed came in the box. I can&#x27;t wait for him to see it :)</li>
    <li> Great Value for a Great product</li>
    <li> Great price. You get what you pay for and more. Just got my kit today and already did a tattoo, which came out great. I&#x27;m not to sure about the colored inks. But the black worked fine. Thanks!</li>
    <li> the kit came on time there was alot of stuff for only $55 the inks are ok and the practice skins are not that good the machine are great for a beginer so coming from a beginer if your just starting out grab this kit cant go wrong for under $60</li>
    <li> The guns were the best part the ink sucks falls out and the pedal wire connector was broke had to go to radio shak to get a new connector</li>
    <li> I enjoy using this kit I use it every time I get the chance thanks and keep up the good work I also like the fast shipping I had my kit in 3 days thanks again</li>
    <li> The machines and everything inside the kit was amazing. Everything worked perfect. What I did not like about it was the fact that it came with a soft case, instead of a hard shell like casing for everything to fit in, abd the case that came with it tore after two weeks of having it. I recommend getting this product just for the machines and whatnot, but make sure you buy a separate case to use because the case that comes with this sucks, and not everything fits in there in an organized manor.</li>
    <li> So i get the item thinking it would be amazing...turns out it doesnt even work and they won&#x27;t send a new one considering it&#x27;s their fault for not checking the item before selling it. HOW STUPID&amp;#62; I&#x27;d defiantly would love a refund.</li>
    <li> Very good thank you. I tattooing everybody at home incuiding myself now. If you have more tattoo items let me know</li>
    <li> I bought this tattoo kit for my grandson.  He is so enjoying it and has tattooed himself, his cousin and friends.  Tattoo artists say he has lots of potential. For a beginner, this is the perfect tattoo kit.</li>
    <li> verry good starter kit for tatto</li>
    <li> The package came on time ,all the prices were there nothing was missing. Quality of the machines are a bit on the lower end but if u know how to adjust your machines then you should be more than fine.. Really great deal....  👌✋👆✊👌</li>
    <li> Awesome for beginners to play with</li>
    <li> Everything came in the kit as listed, however the needles were dull and unusable. The ink was ok but I also ordered better ink as well but the kit was nice and came in a nice back to hold everything.</li>
    <li> Great product fast shipping</li>
    <li> The ink was not a very good quaility. The dvd did not work.  Overall for my 14 year old it was the best Christmas present ever!</li>
    <li> Great kit!! glad i bought this item, i already got a few tats in, just got it today, defenatlly reccomended by me, only slight problem i seem to have is the transfer is a little flimsy, but other than that, its a great product! thank you!</li>
    <li> Do not buy this kit. It is a p.o.s!! Liner machine died after one hour. Shader did not last 2 min. Total garbage.</li>
    <li> Got this for my hubby and hes been tattooing his heart out. Hes a beginner but has been expirimenting with the needles and voltage and is really enjoying it. I posted a pic of one of the tats je did with the skull and tribal. The kit was shipped with an empty bottle of transfer oil so I emailed them and like the next day they processed a refund for 13 something. The whole kit is only 60 so I thought that was a pretty good deal. Fast shipping. overall pretty happy</li>
    <li> i got it today and i checked everything out and it looks oky my hubby  going like it when he opens it on christmas day   thanks</li>
    <li> The first time the guns didn&#x27;t work, but I got it returned and everything works fine now. The dvd is low quality and not very informative so if you&#x27;re wanting to learn find some books or something on tattooing. This isn&#x27;t high end stuff but it gets the job done if you&#x27;re just starting out.</li>
    <li> I bought this hoping i could finally start doing tattooes i started using it and did 2 tattooes went to start on a 3rd on and my power supply quit working this kit is useless if the power supply doesnt work was happy with what i got but not that i cant even use it not sure how to even get a new power supply this sucks</li>
    <li> works fine, the inks are fair to good quality.</li>
    <li> I purchases this for my grandson for his 18th birthday. I am very pleased with this, Thank you so much</li>
    <li> First of all, I&#x27;m not a professional tattoo artist or anything like that but I bought this kit in order to try to learn how to tattoo. All these \\&quot;professionals\\&quot; on here saying not to buy this or calling a beginner a \\&quot;scratcher\\&quot; are full of s***. This kit works great and I definitely recommend it. The reason I give only four stars is because some of the ink was dried up inside the containers. A prisoner can create works of art with a CD player motor and some guitar string so if you can&#x27;t tattoo with all the real equipment needed then I don&#x27;t know what to tell you, but you don&#x27;t have to spend 500+ dollars and become an apprentice for years, I do suggest watching youtube to learn the basics and I do not suggest starting out by tattooing other people. Hope this was helpful</li>
    <li> Kit has 2 machines.One frame is o.k.&#x3D; black,plain &amp; light,2nd&#x3D;A skull with a helmet(?LOL),which is real heavy. Inks&#x3D;Iron Sakura-cheap brand from China,which I wouldnt use.Bought Starbrite inks seperately.The box of needles werent in kit,the seller sent me 2 boxes to make up for missing ones.Power supply works o.k. Has plenty of grommets,etc. The dvd is a cd-rom,will only play in a computer. Practice skin is junk.If this kit is under $40.00,then it might be worth it.I HIGHLY suggest buying better inks,or look up on Google at dangers of using cheap inks compaired to American made inks! This kit is more like a swap-meet novelty item,than a professional set up.But,if you call it a \\&quot;gun\\&quot;,then its perfect for you.</li>
    <li> When I got this kit I was excited to start my journey into the world of tattooing.  However, that excitement quickly faded as I realized what a pile of junk I had purchased.  The first disappointment came when the power supply&#x27;s screen didn&#x27;t work... AT ALL.  I figured I could manage by sound and feel of the machines, so I continued on.  The second time I opened the tattoo case, the \\&quot;lockable latch\\&quot; broke.  Not that it would have been useful as a lock anyway; it&#x27;s soooo cheap that a 2 month old could break it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next on the list: load ink and try laying lines on the practice skin. That was riddled with challenges as well: half of the ink cups won&#x27;t fit in the holder, the skin was useless, and worst of all, ALL OF THE INK WAS EXPIRED!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I could give zero stars, I would!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor; DON&#x27;T BUY THIS JUNK!!!</li>
    <li> hats off for fast shipment , but i returned it coz i got with incomplete stuff !</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cheap so it gets 3 stars but I&#x27;m not too happy with it. All the tattoos i did as well as the ones a pro friend of mine did leaked most of the ink. Maybe the needles just suck? It&#x27;s not to good. But if you just wanna screw around buy it.</li>
    <li> Would not purchace again. Quit working after the first night it was used.</li>
    <li> Does not work. I wish I could tell you more. I am not a tattoo professional by any means and I am not sure which componet is busted. Ill have to buy a new voltage amp and try troubleshooting it..</li>
    <li> iam 15 and i have ben tattooing for 1 and a half years all in all this kit i great i am getting a nuther one i did 20 tattoos with it still works great. ink is great to still use the same bran ink.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my son and he absolutely loves it, didn&#x27;t expect it to be so nice for that price.</li>
    <li> one of the machines did not work, and the &amp;#34;Practicing Leather Like Sheet with Tiger and Dragon Pattern&amp;#34; are not useful, the ink stay on the sheets even if the ink just drop on it... so you cant see if you are actually tattooing. beside that everything is great</li>
    <li> First of all, the package came relatively quick. everything was there when i opened the package. Everything was awesome except a couple of things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the dvd does not work whats-so-ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;one of the ointments was ripped open, (seems like from shipping) not that messy because it was like Vaseline yet still annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but the thing that annoyed me the most is the soft caring case. the bag is cheap and id rather have a case for it.</li>
    <li> I loved my tattoo kit thanks it was what i expected it arrived fast</li>
    <li> Did not come with guns described. But other than that great starter kit.</li>
    <li> Package was delivered on time through UPS. I recieved everything that was expected, but the power supply is not good. I have dont 3 parts of my leg sleeve. Had it about a week and its running crazy. Also the practice skin? i dont know how youre supposed to get practice when u cant wipe the ink off so its a one time use thing its like rubber not pig skin so order your own if you need practice. I cant comment on the ink until my tats heal i have used the black and green only. Good bundle though. And dont expect alot from the DVD. just toss it or let your kids watch it. Learn from an experienced artist. Last but not least get some trasfer paper you&#x27;ll need it.</li>
    <li> This kit has everything you need to start tattooing. Has all the information you need in the description for picking this kit. Every piece of equipment came with works and works well.</li>
    <li> I just started tattoing and i wanted a cheap tattoo kit with everything i needed and this was great the only reason why i gave it 4 stars was because the plug for the power generator was kind of messed up when i got it, anyways i just use the one from my computer is the same thing lol hope this helps anyone:3</li>
    <li> Got this as a gift for a friend and it stopped working after the first tattoo. I returned it and will be looking for a better start up kit.</li>
    <li> Bought this kit a few months ago. Don&#x27;t know how the disc was because it can only be played on a computer and I have a notebook (no disc drive). But just from learning through YouTube and some people from work who do tattoos as well, I have to say I&#x27;m not too bad. I will say that when I first got it, I tried the practice skin and it sucked. But then I came across someone&#x27;s comment that said you should slather it with petroleum jelly while using the skins. Good to know. Treat the practice skins like you would a person - use the jelly and green soap. Neither come in the kit so make sure you get them before falling into a routine with this thing. The inks aren&#x27;t all that great. The black isn&#x27;t actually black. It comes out more of a faded purple. I recommend these inks being JUST for practice. If you want to stick somebody, make sure you guy the good stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and the kit comes with two guns, but I&#x27;m only able to use one of them because a part is messed up in the second one. Doesn&#x27;t really bother me too much because I can just trade one gun part for the other, but I would really have prefer that the item was checked before shipping. Also, as I&#x27;ve noted in my review of the $5 add-on Tattoo Goo, that stuff has lavender oil in it, which turns out my sister is allergic to and it made a rash break out over her fresh tattoo, the ointment that comes with the kit is much better. We put that stuff on her instead and it soothed her right away.&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all, this a great for newbie tattoo artists. Just make sure to get as much info as you can on the full tattoo process and the care and maintainance for your tools before actually trying the stuff out on anyone but yourself.</li>
    <li> Bad ink, cool looking guns, but not very sturdy, I would spend more time looking for a better training set, and in no situation should you use these on real skin</li>
    <li> came earlier than expected everything that was in the picture came with it power supply works great everything you need to get started only complaint that i had was the instuctional disc really wasnt as helpfull as id have liked still a great buy</li>
    <li> I want to be a tattoo artist and this set was perfect for me to start tattooing! All the equipment is incredible, there was actually more in the case then I had expected but the only problem that I am having is that the power supply is not working. Help?</li>
    <li> Looked good but no power to gun so have to return...don&#x27;t like the hassle but is what it is</li>
    <li> the tattoo machine came exactly on time, all the equipment was there and in excellent condition, not one thing was missing, it even comes with a handy carrying pouch, comes with everything pictured. i will definitly purchase from you guys again in the future. the tattoo guns work perfectly, this is a great kit for someone wishing to learn the art of tattooing, you cant go wrong with this machine :)</li>
    <li> I am extremely satisfied with this product. It works better than expected for the price. If anyone asks where to get this type of equipment guaranteed to get a referral from me. If you sell needles and ink separately I&#x27;ll definitely buy from you.</li>
    <li> I really like it and it works vary well and it I easy to clean and is actually really cheaply prized if you would like a tattoo gun I would strongly recommend this set</li>
    <li> Very nice starter kit and it&#x27;s still working today</li>
    <li> junk ink guns r passable with adjusting</li>
    <li> Horrible the machine doesnt work and I turned it to and set it all up ....wouldnt recommend this machine to anyone...</li>
    <li> I got this  as a Christmas gift to my gf and when she tried to use it the power supply was already dead/defective. it wouldnt turn on and also the cords didnt fit in the power supply. i was very unhappy especially since i got it as a gift. this was a complete waste of money and suggest buying this from another seller.</li>
    <li> Very Awesome. My son will start  his career with this purchase. Thanks so much for easy to find for this first time. Buyer.</li>
    <li> the dvd for the tattoo information was broke and I try look for more information on line with the tattoo company and I doesn&#x27;t have any answer.desapointed...now am afraid buy more stuff for this company.</li>
    <li> Everything in the kit looked nice but I was having trouble with the power supply. Amazon wouldn&#x27;t let me simply do an exchange so I returned the kit for a refund and I&#x27;m going to just order another one as soon as the refund goes through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will re-review when I have a functioning one.</li>
    <li> i Love this ! It worked amazing ! &amp;#60;3 its Great Totally Recommend! &amp;#60; This was An amazing Gift to Get !</li>
    <li> Works great, not impressed with the ink tho, screaming ink is better</li>
    <li> i was told it would be in on tuesday prior to being lately delivered everthing came which they said would but the dvd dont seem to work and thepower supply was crappy in the middle of preforming my first tattoo using it the power supply went completely out  which being as that was the day it arrived im upset i got this but then im not because it is a good kit besides the horrible power supply</li>
    <li> Well after the speedy shipping (the only reason it got one star), I was excited to open my newly arrived package, only to realize the black machine did not work at all. AT ALL. Completely dead. Another the metal skull machine was bent and barely worked. It&#x27;s like they gave me some one else&#x27;s returns. I am extremely pissed, but most of all disappointed. You should have seen my jaw drop. Wish they would send me a damn new one, but guess i&#x27;ll have to return it. Weak. Very weak.</li>
    <li> if your buying this to start putting permanent ink to your &amp;#34;clients&amp;#34; skin, dont. if your buying this for any other reason, dont. stop trying to learn the at home and get an apprenticeship. its the only way to gain respect in any shop owners eyes, and will start you off on good habits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: the machines are crap, the power supply is crap, and this kit is crap.</li>
    <li> I brought this for my nephew&#x27;s 21st bday and he LOVES it!!! Thanks!  I just might let him tattoo me soon :)</li>
    <li> This Tattoo Kit is very well built I love it and Im always using it so its a great product I highly suggest this tattoo kit</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my kit for about 3 weeks, I&#x27;ve used it for 7 tattoos, and it works great! My only issue is the power supply died completly. It will no longer turn on or even light up. And yes, it&#x27;s set up right, plugged in, the breaker has not been tripped, and because of it&#x27;s failure, I had to leave my last tattoo unfinished. It was a major bummer, but I know I got what I paid for. So my only recommendation is it&#x27;s a starter kit. Not a pro&#x27;s kit. Thus, I&#x27;m moving on and purchasing a better and more expensive power supply.</li>
    <li> The tattoo gun it came with is pretty good and I like all the cups and needles it came with also. But the inks are s***  and you would wanna invest in another power source as well</li>
    <li> Okay so I bought this actually for my fiance to start tattooing with, at least that was the plan till it ended up being mine. She opened it and the next thing I know I&#x27;m the one who is playing with it trying to figure everything out. Youtube is great for setting up the gun, the minute the package arrived we instantly threw that DVD into the trash. The skins aren&#x27;t like other practice skins ive felt, don&#x27;t really like them honestly but still used those ones up and got better ones from our local supplies shop. The inks are great for practice(DO NOT USE THESE ON A REAL PERSON) I do like the guns but honestly one is WAY heavier than the other so you have to get use to that. The power supply is great and i&#x27;ve never had to push the power. I will report back after I&#x27;ve put a few more hours on the guns.</li>
    <li> Such a great kit. Has everything a beginning tattoo artist could need. This awesome kit even includes a VCD disc with How-To help, and imitation skin to practice on. 5 STARS</li>
    <li> Very good product! On time delivery!</li>
    <li> The power supply went out after I did only three tattoos.</li>
    <li> The tattoo Kit Arrive Right on time, this is a gift for my brother because he been wanting a tattoo kit for a while but now its finally here, it has all the accessories and the equipment that you will need i recommend you with this kit for a start off :).</li>
    <li> Order came a day early. Everything was there and in perfect condition. Both guns work and are close to being in tune. Power supply works fine. Inks look good. Did one tattoo with it and looks fine. Wont know how the ink holds untill its all healed up.</li>
    <li> I loved everything about this kit! But...I&#x27;ve only had it for two days and I used it only ONCE and today the tattoo power supply machine would not work...when I used it I literally had it on for two-three minutes MAX. So if you do buy this beware of this happening, but the rest of the kit is great, just going to have to buy a newer and more reliable power supply.</li>
    <li> The power supply broke the 2nd use. had to solder in a new potentiometer it got stuck at 23 and i didnt even put it higher than 7 soooo idk i may have just gotter a bad power supply. Ink is cheap gun are pretty decent though</li>
    <li> Delivered on time. Works great</li>
    <li> Not happy.. The ink isn&#x27;t all that good.. You have to go over it more then normal.. If your heavy handed there&#x27;s a huge problem.. Will nt buy again.. I waste of money in my opinion..</li>
    <li> not a bad kit but nothing but the needles come sterilized in any way but oh well. The INK SUCKS i have done 2 tattoos with them so far and the black did fine but the colors on both did not take well and out of both tattoos the color areas got infections in them with pieces of skin falling out while cleaning pretty bad. I would suggest not using any of the inks in this kit and purchasing another reputable ink brand.</li>
    <li> I bought this prior to xmas for my sons birthday in February, he did two small tattoos and now cant use it...completely dead...  The ink besides being cheap appears came in from china ..we were under impression this was a usa made product... realize for the price you cant expect much...but it should work for some time and not go out after two tattoos......very disappointed</li>
    <li> The kit has more then you pay for in it. Although the decorative gun is heavier then I care for it seems to be good quality  product. I&#x27;m still reeling over the incredible price and will recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> The kit showed up three days early!(nice!) everything was as described. The machines are of good construction and quality. Inks are good quality also. The only change I would want is a momentary on foot pedal instead of the push on push off pedal. This is a pretty good starter set, I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Everything came as described. The ink isn&#x27;t the greatest and the shipper put the wrong address so I had to deal with the shipping company more than I would have liked too, it ended up taking a week or so to get it, had he filled in the correct info it would have only been around 3 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t bother with the VCD that comes with it, it&#x27;ll only work in a PC/Laptop and most likely contains nothing more than what is already available on Youtube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The practice skin is some of the worst out there, I&#x27;d recommend getting it elsewhere if you&#x27;re seriously wanting to practice on it, or go to your local butcher and get some pigs feets or the like.</li>
    <li> came with everything I expected, and was pleasantly surprised with the quality for the price. a little disappointed with the bag everything came in, but was already planning on getting a metal case.</li>
    <li> the amp that comes with is a piece of s***. the dvd was Bull. looked cheap. cheap ink oh and needles cheap. not worth it. sloppy</li>
    <li> For the money spent is a great gun, had a small issue one of the guns didnt work and were missing the transfer paper, the seller sent me a brand new gun and paper within 2 days! still working and havent had any issues. Did alot of research before buying this and would purchase from this seller again, great company and very kind when it comes to fixing issues.</li>
    <li> Great tattoo kit will recommend to anyone who asks 5 stars 🌟🌠⭐🔯✴</li>
    <li> Got the kit quicker than I thought I would. I am very satisfied. I did some shading on a few older tattoos I have and the machines work perfect and the inks are great.The power pack and the needles are good quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, you will be receiving more business from me.&lt;br /&gt;Trace Johnson&lt;br /&gt;San Diego, Ca.</li>
    <li> Product was a bit weak but i guess you get what you pay for</li>
    <li> I bought this item to avoid the hassle I have had in the past, with getting a tattoo done professionaly. I am very excited to use this product, as it comes with so many tools and accessories. Shipping was fast, and item came exactly as described, though the case does have a spot where the fabric looks scratched, this is only cosmetic, and everything else looks in pristine condition. Everything is individually packaged, and I am looking forward to watching the instructional dvd included. Overall a great item for a novice such as myself.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my brother who is a amateur tattoo artist. He said he like the product and is ready to order more.&lt;br /&gt;He said that he will practice with this gun and look at ordering a more professional gun soon</li>
    <li> Love it. Came with everything i need to get started. Cant thank them enough! :) already started practicing and gonna soon start tatting myself and friends.</li>
    <li> The Tattooing Kit was by far amazing. Came with everything and came in perfect conditions. I could have not ask for anything more for a great buy</li>
    <li> Did 3 stencil tattoos &amp; it was easy, didn&#x27;t hurt a bit, healed fast. First tattoos by myself with a gun. Came with 7 colors.</li>
    <li> decent budget kit but i say skip the whole cheap tattoo supplies part and invest in some quality tools that being said there&#x27;s actually a pretty decent liner in here</li>
    <li> I guuss for the price the kits is ok. The down side to it is that it comes without instructions on how to put the guns together and does not give you any tattoing tips. It does come with a dvd but the set up makes it very hard to actually find the file to watch it onces its in the dvd player, and the kit on the dvd is NOT the kit you are ordering here. Its for a much different kit with a lot more items. It does tell you how to put the gun together but he goes thru the steps very quickly so you have to listen very carefully. This was bought for my fiance for christmas and he went over an old tattoo with the ink it comes with, so i will give more when it heals. He also let the tube that goes on the gun soak in water to remove access ink and it started to rust pretty quick. Idk if it was suppose to be soaked to clean it bc it did not come with care instructions, so my advice is to look on google before using or cleaning any of the items. The practice skin that it comes with is just a few peices of thin rubber with patterns already drawn on them, so simple designs are impossible to practice.</li>
    <li> This jawn jawn is the bomb diggity. My licensed friend said that he&#x27;d like to buy 3 more kits for a bundled price</li>
    <li> Kit has everything needed to start out, but the power box quit working after about 3 weeks.  Expensive for such a main thing to stop...</li>
    <li> I like the tattoo guns. d.v.d sucks dont actually tells you every thing best bet is to use youtube. set ups easy The ink AINT INK. its water.but the main stuff is great quality and i the lion head on the power supply is dope.</li>
    <li> This kit comes with everything needed for a beginner. One terrible thing though was that the case that comes with it was completely ripped open on one side, but I didn&#x27;t really care however, because I knew it looked shabby before I bought it and was planning to buy a better case anyways. The machine works, there are plenty of accessories and the inks are great. For the price this is by far the best beginner kit on amazon.</li>
    <li> They send you everything pictured,  but they don&#x27;t tell you what ANYTHING is. Not how to assemble the machine, no explanation as to which needle is used for what, and the VCD they send is just god awful.</li>
    <li> Mine came with no ink</li>
    <li> I was happy it came with a ton of supplies, I was not happy however with the learning DVD. I also had to fix the wiring in the machine because it wouldn&#x27;t work when I got it. If I couldn&#x27;t fix it, I would have sent it back and probably ordered from another company.</li>
    <li> Got this for a bday present, and he loves it. I would give this a 5 star if the ink would be better quality, but black works just other bleed and run and have a hard time taking. Everything else happy with.</li>
    <li> This kit is alright. One of the machines is overly detailed and heavy...also the clip cord was flimsy from the start and broken after a few uses,</li>
    <li> I love this seller.&lt;br /&gt;Got the product fast. Everything was in the kit nothing missing. I had an issue with a gun but they mailed out another one right away no extra charge or hassle. Everyone loves these guns and I have actually sent people to this seller because they loved my guns so much. I have no complaints. Customer services was great and they responded quickly I didn&#x27;t have a hard time reaching anyone or have to wait a long time for a response.</li>
    <li> I use it on livestock to fix a tattoo you get a lot of stuff in the kit lots of different colors</li>
    <li> I just ordered this kit and it should be in tomorrow. Does anyone know what brand of machines these are ? Im a beginner and will be practicing on oranges and such. Any pointers on getting started would be appreciated</li>
    <li> Good machines , the cd dont play but other than that its a pe kit for new learners smi pro</li>
    <li> muy buenos productos me llego todo completo y todo en muy buen stado no tengo ninguna queja sobre el producto</li>
    <li> My daughter loved it, she is having a bit of trouble following the dvd it came with, had to have a tattoo artist (friend) show her how to set it up. but she loves it...</li>
    <li> It was a good kit overall for beginners. Ink is china town quality (not good). Just wish it came with a kit hand book but it does have the DVD.</li>
    <li> Good for the price. The gun is flawless, and the kit is complete. The power supply kinda sucks, very junky. The ink sucks too so I&#x27;d buy separate ink. Needles are good. Over all worth it&#x27;s money</li>
    <li> well this was my first time buying stuff over the computer and i tell ya, this is a good buy! everything works as it should and everything was as told! i have ran 4 tatz and all have came out pretty damn good!! well worth the buy!</li>
    <li> Great starter kit , came with all the essentials needed to start off a kick ass career</li>
    <li> i got it on the day it said it would be hear. i iset it up and it all worked except the dvd sucked so i youtubed how to put it together. I haven&#x27;t tried it on anyone but the inks look like they work ok. but its good enough for your money i would say.</li>
    <li> tracking a tattoo kit</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter as a Christmas gift and she absolutely loves it!! I had it shipped directly to her in Hawaii so I wasn&#x27;t there to see the contents, but she seems not to have any complaints!</li>
    <li> It was on time an all there ty</li>
    <li> It was well pack came on time one gun did not work so I took it apart put it back together &amp; now it works.&lt;br /&gt;The bad ink is junk I would use it just on fruit to learn how.&lt;br /&gt;The real bad there are no instructions how to use the guns what needles you use for what the DVD that guy needs to work on his people skills.</li>
    <li> pretty good everything is working fine don&#x27;t use the ink on people. everything was in the box as described. good seller the item was shipped in time and it arrived on time</li>
    <li> This deluxe tattoo kit machine gun power supply with needles and eleven inks is fabulous.  I love how it works.  It is much better than the previous gun I bought.</li>
    <li> Had everything I wanted and made a perfect gift gift for my cousin who just started his tattoo business! It included everything it said it would. Would definitely recommend to everyone!</li>
    <li> came just as described i rate this a 5!. everybody get it!. it is hands down the best tattoo kit for its price!.</li>
    <li> Absolutely GREAT product. I will say, one gun worked a little funny but improved, it may have been my fault. The seller was extremely nice and professional. I contacted them with my worries and concerns and they sent me two new guns. I really value this company and will be recommending and purchasing from them again. Thank you so much for your help!&lt;br /&gt;As far as the actual gun goes for tattooing, it works great. Im a new artist so I am not 100% certain on all aspects, but I feel as if maybe the gun doesn&#x27;t retain as much ink as I would like, which is a super easy fix, I just dip into the ink more often. Otherwise, the designs are great, the products included are awesome.</li>
    <li> Great for a beginner!:)</li>
    <li> we love the product got a hold bunch of tats now</li>
    <li> good for a beginner, If you want to make a career out of inking though you&#x27;re going to need to upgrade.</li>
    <li> simple machine but iv given like 8 tattoos with it</li>
    <li> These guns out preformed my buddy&#x27;s 400.00 guns, everything was complete and brand new in package and as described in picture, only con is should have a set box to put everything in, and the ink is only for practice, do not use on it skin, buy other ink from tattoo world.</li>
    <li> The product got here quick everything in order as far as supplies... The power source is shaky though!!!! It&#x27;s cool at times but if your at a location with poor power sources it WILL burnout had to order another one after 2.5 wks of use..... The guns and everything else is great.</li>
    <li> I bought this as my 1st step into tattooing. And this kit has everything. Ive done many tattoos most on myself for practice. For the price this is a steal! I&#x27;m just now restocking on rl3 needles. The ink is good iron sakura.  The foot pedel is a clicker step once and it runs step again and it turns it off. Power supply is awesome. The test sheets that r provided are like rubber and r terrible to practice on. Use a orange if u wish to practice before hitting the skin. Overall this is worth its cost and more!</li>
    <li> great for beginners for sure. everything is of good quality and it runs great, one tattoo and it pays for itself. the shipping only took two days too!</li>
    <li> This kit is pretty awesome for the price, the only thing that could have made it better is more disposable tips. Love the variety of everything you get though good for beginners</li>
    <li> this is a nice kit for the money. but as others have stated the &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; looking machine is WAY heavy and uncomfortable to use. other than that its a nice selection and a great starter kit, however if you plan on purchasing this kit i would recommend ordering some transfer paper. the papers that came with this kit were so old it would take a hammer to make a transfer. and the DVD that comes with is very outdated and of very little use. but if you want cheap then this is it.</li>
    <li> I guess this is a good starter kit, as far a starter kits go. Wanted to learn some easy tats and the kit has everything needed and more! Except transfer paper which i bought outside of this order. My first tattoo i used the lighter weight tattoo gun and it seemed super smooth and easy to controle, perfect for straight lines. I also used the four needles in one to get a thick outline, which i find more applealing. The paint is good too, not sure what the end results are yet but exciting having all the tools and everthing fits in the bag they provided with the kit.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend started doing tats, so I brought this for him. He loved it, he started using it right away. The prices was fine, it shipped in a nice time, and it comes with a lot, if he likes it I love it.</li>
    <li> I bought this kit about a month ago. Overnight shipping it was on my door step before i was out of work the next day.Ive done several tattoos with it including a touch up on an older one of mine the ink sets good, guns are great, and a price you cant beat</li>
    <li> I have done about 15 tattoos since I bought this kit, the ink it comes with is not that great will recommend getting different inks, machines need adjusting but they are functional.. overall nice beginners kit..</li>
    <li> THEY WERE DETECTED HAD TO RETURN.  MY DAUGHTER WAS DISAPPOINTED, CAME WITH ALL THE PARTS, BUT IT WAS A ASTE OF TIME AND EFFERRT.</li>
    <li> This kit is great for the price came with everything that was described and everything you need for doing tattoos.  I am 100% happy with my purchase.</li>
