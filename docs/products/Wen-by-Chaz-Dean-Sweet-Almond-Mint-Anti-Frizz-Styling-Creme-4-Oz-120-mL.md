      <li>Love it would like to get the Lavender</li>

      <li>I love Wen products</li>
      <li>This is one of husband&#x27;s favorite Wen products.  </li>
      <li>I really love this styling creme.</li>
      <li>this and the Wen shampoo leaves it softer and more manageable.</li>
      <li>But love shampoo</li>
      <li>My favorite.</li>
      <li>still love WEN.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t even have to use a straightener any more.</li>
      <li>Make sure you order the 4 oz.</li>
      <li>love this product.</li>
      <li>All of the wen product, are pretty good</li>
      <li>not as impressed as i expected I would be</li>
      <li>Works good just dont use as much as it says.</li>
      <li>but once I tried it (from the Q on a special today&#x27;s value) I love it.  </li>
      <li>Also, this company is fine to deal with.  </li>
      <li>Quick ship!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s still available here</li>
      <li>This product did not leave my hair frizz free.  </li>
      <li>I am a die-hard WEN user (Sweet Almond Mint Cleansing Conditioner, and Re Moist Intensive Hair Treatment)</li>
      <li>Love it; it really works well.</li>
      <li>This anti-frizz creme got most of the frizz out of my hair and felt very light and soft (using too much will make your hair greasy, however).</li>
      <li>I love the wen products and would highly recommend them.</li>
      <li>this stuff is great not oily and doesn&#x27;t make your hair heavy.</li>
      <li>but I have to use a good amount due to thickness and texture of my hair.  </li>
      <li>my hair is very fine and short ...</li>
      <li>After trying the whole Wen system, I found I only liked this 1 product.</li>
      <li>I have some pretty stubborn hair.  </li>
      <li>Try any Wen product and you will love it, my hair dresser is now using it for her client&#x27;s and charging extra if they want to use it.</li>
      <li>This my first Wen Product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It helps slightly at first, but not a lot of differance.</li>
      <li>Love the entire line of products.  </li>
      <li>Shipping was also fast!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried it before and love how it keeps curly hair from swelling up in the humidity (only those with truly curly/frizzy hair would understand the &#x27;swelling&#x27; thing.)</li>
      <li>Also, it left a film on my hair that you could feel on your hand after touching my hair.  </li>
      <li>I have very thick curly hair and this styling creme is perfect for allowing natural curly hair to keep it&#x27;s curls and shine</li>
      <li>I was hoping that it would also help enhance curls but it really just controls frizz pretty well</li>
      <li>I have baby fine blonde hair and this product helps with frizz</li>
      <li>It used to be my favorite, but I found another product that costs the same and works a little better.</li>
      <li>I have VERY curly hair</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t see much improvement, but I wouldn&#x27;t knock the product either...</li>
      <li>Did not do much for my hair wont buy again</li>
      <li>I love this product as well as my other Chaz Dean hair products.  </li>
      <li>Only recently started using Wen but love it.</li>
      <li>Yes, I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>Only product that prevents frizz in my hair, even after a hot shower!</li>
      <li>and I live in South Florida.  </li>
      <li>Again, CAN&#x27;T  LIVE WITHOUT THIS PRODUCT.</li>
      <li>The smell was so unexpected and Vaseline-like, I questioned the authenticity of my particular tube.</li>
      <li>Moisturized my hair and kept the curls styled and defined, very soft to the touch no stiffness.</li>
      <li>However, I would definitely recommend trying it, because it might suit your hair care needs, and if this particular product doesn&#x27;t do the trick (if you have the same problems as I did), try using the Sweet Almond Mint Cleansing Conditioner and Re Moist Intensive Hair Treatment.</li>
      <li>so cannot comment on that, but it makes styling fine thin hair much easier and holds up pretty well throughout the day.  </li>
      <li>If you have naturally curly /frizzy hair, I promise you ....</li>
      <li>It really does not keep the frizz out of your hair, especially on humid days.</li>
      <li>My hair is soft and shiny.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love it would like to get the Lavender</li>
    <li> Did not do much for my hair wont buy again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a Wen girl with naturally white (now that I&#x27;m nearing 60!), naturally wavy and curly, long hair that tends to be very frizzy without a little help of a hot iron brush. I love Wen products but this didn&#x27;t do a thing. I&#x27;ll stick with Wen&#x27;s SixThirteen styling cream that also has heat protecting qualities.</li>
    <li> Hair still got frizzy.  But love shampoo</li>
    <li> I am African American this  was hyped through marketing product failed to deliver results I expected. The initial moisture was there but not long lasting  for the  money. I would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Just what the wife wanted</li>
    <li> This is one of husband&#x27;s favorite Wen products.  He won&#x27;t be without it.</li>
    <li> It is a very good hair gel.  It does not leave any residue in your hair like other hair products for styling hair.</li>
    <li> I could not live without this stuff.  Hands down.  I have thin, fine, straight processed hair - this styling cream allows me to curl my bob under, tames my flyaways, and softens and moisturizers my hair.  I get tons of compliments and people always are asking me if they can feel my hair.  Again, CAN&#x27;T  LIVE WITHOUT THIS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> my hair is very fine and short ... I was not satisfied ... provided too much conditioner and left my hair feeling too conditioned</li>
    <li> First time purchasing a Wen product and am very impressed with the product.  In fact I ordered more and will use.</li>
    <li> Good product but I have to use a good amount due to thickness and texture of my hair.  However, it is very good</li>
    <li> Only product that prevents frizz in my hair, even after a hot shower!</li>
    <li> my great granddaughter was delighted.</li>
    <li> I have VERY curly hair and I live in South Florida.  Unfortunately this product did not remove the frizz from my hair. My hair was as frizzy as always.</li>
    <li> A friend recommended this product to me.  I have very curly hair and frizzy with the least bit of moisture.  It shines the hair and helps me style it without leaving any residue.  The amount of usage will vary with the amount of hair one has.  Yes, I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love it; it really works well.</li>
    <li> I use this on the ends of my hair after washing and it does take the frizz out. Only use a very little as it goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I&#x27;m on Chazy mailing list for his other stuff if you have curly hair this stuff is great not oily and doesn&#x27;t make your hair heavy.</li>
    <li> The regular cleansing conditioner is expensive but once I tried it (from the Q on a special today&#x27;s value) I love it.  I found this styling creme here for a great bargain and I like it.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s still available here but if you like Wen this is an authentic and good product.</li>
    <li> love this product. works very well with keeping frizz down. I will be purchasing again.  thank you... Shipping was also fast!</li>
    <li> This was a great price for Wen that I use all the time. Love the fact I can purchase without having to have auto ship.</li>
    <li> The product worked so well on my hair that I don&#x27;t have to blow dry it  anymore. To me he scent is more of a chemical smelling mint but I don&#x27;t care as this styling creme works works on my hair.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see much improvement, but I wouldn&#x27;t knock the product either... but for the price, I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> This my first Wen Product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike most users here, I actually have very straight, very thin hair, mid-length, that is impossible to style and frizzes very easily. This anti-frizz creme got most of the frizz out of my hair and felt very light and soft (using too much will make your hair greasy, however). Being that my hair is limp and thin, the styling aspect of this creme really didn&#x27;t apply to me, since my hair is impossible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as far as frizz goes, it did a great job with my difficult hair!</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best! I wanted to grow my hair long again but it didn&#x27;t look good because its too wavy and frizzy but with this cream and a flatiron it looks great!! I get tons of compliments on my hair now!</li>
    <li> I have used WEN&#x27;s Sweet Almond Mint Anti Frizz Styling Crème for approximately four years and I like it because it does the job without any noticeable smell, no heavy weigh down and the product size lasts me for months.</li>
    <li> I brought this styling crime, and use it with my Wen cleansing conditioner, remoist treatment, &amp; replenishing treatment spray. The result of my hair: less breakage, thick, volume hair, zero frizz. For those who have relaxed hair, look at the instructions and use it wisely.</li>
    <li> I have some pretty stubborn hair.  It maintains control without being &amp;#34;gunky&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Have used it on my granddaughter - not frizzy hair - but it provided a lot of control for her as well</li>
    <li> Love it!!  It has been keeping my hair under control.</li>
    <li> All of the wen product, are pretty good it leave your hair feeling nice and moistizer. I wish it was a little bigger but it&#x27;s thick so you don&#x27;t have to use a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend it? Yes I would.</li>
    <li> Works good just dont use as much as it says. It will make your hair look greasy. If you use amt of dime works great on med length hair. Use halfway down shaft.</li>
    <li> Moisturized my hair and kept the curls styled and defined, very soft to the touch no stiffness.</li>
    <li> I really love this styling creme. I use it before I blow dry my hair and then just a little bit on my hair after it&#x27;s dry. Works great!</li>
    <li> Not the results that I was expecting</li>
    <li> Only recently started using Wen but love it. My hair is soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> It really does not keep the frizz out of your hair, especially on humid days. It helps slightly at first, but not a lot of differance.</li>
    <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t seem to be as frizzy since using Wen products.  I&#x27;ll continue for awhile!</li>
    <li> Love the entire line of products.  I have baby fine blonde hair and this product helps with frizz</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried it before and love how it keeps curly hair from swelling up in the humidity (only those with truly curly/frizzy hair would understand the &#x27;swelling&#x27; thing.)</li>
    <li> I wrote a review on this product for sale by another person a few minutes ago, and I will say the same thing on this product. I am a die-hard WEN user (Sweet Almond Mint Cleansing Conditioner, and Re Moist Intensive Hair Treatment) and I really was disappointed with this product. It made my hair look and feel greasy near the roots, didn&#x27;t have a strong enough hold, and it smells awful to me. However, I would definitely recommend trying it, because it might suit your hair care needs, and if this particular product doesn&#x27;t do the trick (if you have the same problems as I did), try using the Sweet Almond Mint Cleansing Conditioner and Re Moist Intensive Hair Treatment. I have written reviews on those products as well, and I absolutely love them!</li>
    <li> Wen products are great. I have to wash my hair daily because of  my profession, and use  all of Wen products with No problems. I have curly hair, this product is great, gives me a nice texture and shine.</li>
    <li> I have curly frizzy hair, I use about a dime size amount on my shoulder length hair and OMG!!! magic!!! this is the best stuff ever!!! no frizz at all! I don&#x27;t even have to use a straightener any more. My hair looks and feels so healthy now! I have been using this for about a year now and I swear by it!! If you have naturally curly /frizzy hair, I promise you .... you will absolutely love this!</li>
    <li> My hair is thick and coarse...this and the Wen shampoo leaves it softer and more manageable.</li>
    <li> The promises made in the informercials is not what I received when using this product.  This product did not leave my hair frizz free.  It left it hard to manage and heavy.  Also, it left a film on my hair that you could feel on your hand after touching my hair.  I would not recommend this product.  I am very disappointed I spent the money I did.</li>
    <li> I was hoping that it would also help enhance curls but it really just controls frizz pretty well</li>
    <li> A+A+A+A+A+A+A+A+A+A+A+A+</li>
    <li> After trying the whole Wen system, I found I only liked this 1 product. Wen does not sell the products individually so had to look elsewhere. Thankfully, Amazon had it and I bought enough, (Great price by the way) to share with my curly-haired daughter.</li>
    <li> gave it a four have used it before like it but only gets three fourths of the frizz will continue to use it thou</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! I&#x27;ve used it before and will continue to do so! Makes my hair shiny, helps to detangle the strands, and helps to keep it healthy looking! Great product! Quick ship!</li>
    <li> Exceptional product, great value</li>
    <li> Shocking, as I LOVE the shampoo.  It felt a little too &amp;#34;gelly&amp;#34; where I prefer more creamy ones.</li>
    <li> It used to be my favorite, but I found another product that costs the same and works a little better.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter who has shoulder length hair.  She says it&#x27;s the best anti frizz product she has ever used.</li>
    <li> It smooths and conditions my dry hair and makes it shiny and silky.</li>
    <li> Being an older women with gray hair coming in and having to color every 6 weeks, my hair was getting dry and brittle. I started using the Wen products about 4 months ago and my hair has never been healthier. I love the wen products and would highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> I have very thick curly hair and this styling creme is perfect for allowing natural curly hair to keep it&#x27;s curls and shine</li>
    <li> Have been using this for about a year I like it</li>
    <li> Nothing about this smells like honey mint. The smell was so unexpected and Vaseline-like, I questioned the authenticity of my particular tube. I bought it thinking it would add a pleasant scent to my hair. Total fail in that arena.</li>
    <li> I have long, coarse, dry hair thay frizzies at the thought of moisture.  The first time I used this product, I didn&#x27;t quite get my thick hair dry.  I left for work and realized my hair was not frizzy!  I will be using this product for a long time</li>
    <li> Quicker than expected results. My wife loves this product. Her friends and co-workers just keep complimenting her about her hair.</li>
    <li> Hate this. Will never buy again. Wen products ruined my hair.</li>
    <li> My favorite. My hair is shine and beautiful</li>
    <li> My third purchase.  I love it.  Works better if hair is on the wetter side.  I don&#x27;t have frizzy hair so cannot comment on that, but it makes styling fine thin hair much easier and holds up pretty well throughout the day.  The smell is not really strong enough to have an opinion one way or the other.  Make sure you order the 4 oz. size.
