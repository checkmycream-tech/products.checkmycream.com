<li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it&#x27;s a little small for my bag, but that&#x27;s not such a bag thing because I still have room to put in a blanket, spare chare of clothes for my baby, and 1-2 bottles / sippy cups.</li>

    <li> Hate it. I ordered two different ones and both of them would fold over in my purse and would not hold the items.</li>
    <li> The product arrived on time and in its plastic packaging.  It was a little smaller than I thought it would be but it still works nicely, especially in handbags that don&#x27;t have any dividers or pockets.  Great for smaller extra things that usually sink to the bottom.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I used this for my toddler twins: I fill it up with crayons, markers, small coloring books, small notepads, stickers, a small container filled play dough, little toys, decks of cards. etc etc stuff that will keep the kids busy/quite when out to dinner or doctor waiting rooms... works like a charm, they each have their own and mommy is happy</li>
    <li> Great product, fits PERFECTLY inside my purse, and holds everything I need, and keeps it where I can find it too! Good quality, wont tear or rip easily. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Because I was completely satisfied with the product.Item fit perfectly as required Thank you.I will soon order again.Everything&lt;br /&gt;fits nice and cozy.</li>
    <li> This bad is perfect for my uses... it keeps everything in place while in my larger bag. Could not be more pleased.</li>
    <li> perfect for my thin tote bag</li>
    <li> This is possibly the best invention in the world, for women anyway!  I bought the wider one which I can quickly switch from one purse to another and am thinking about getting the narrow but taller one for other purses.  There are ample pockets for neatly organizing what was formerly a bottomless pit of items in my purse.  Pens, nail file, lip gloss, reading glasses, hand lotion, hand sanitizer, coupons...all stand up and stay put!  There are little pockets for my well-worn calculator, Tylenol box and tiny tape measure, and that is all on the outside. The center is generously proportioned for a check book, cell phone, credit card wallet, or whatever else you carry every day. The black one works for me, as it matches my dark purses, but the light one would be perfect for light colored bags.  This is a great product!</li>
    <li> I use this in a larger tote. It&#x27;s perfect for keeping all of my purse contents in one place and leaves plenty of room for school books, notebooks, and water bottle.</li>
    <li> I am enjoying this little organizer bag! It helps put everything in place ! I highly recommend it to everyone!!!</li>
    <li> I carry a Longchamp Classic Tote as my diaper bag but the lack of pockets was making it impossible to find anything. I use this to keep diapers, wipes, important paperwork, pens, checkbook, etc all within reach. It has a lot of pockets, which makes putting items in their own space easy. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it&#x27;s a little small for my bag, but that&#x27;s not such a bag thing because I still have room to put in a blanket, spare chare of clothes for my baby, and 1-2 bottles / sippy cups. And if I want to change to bags, I can pull out the organizer and drop it into the other bag - it takes all of 30 seconds. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Love this!  I am a nurse and use this to organize all the things I need to carry in my bag on a day to do basis. Keeps everything I need easily accessible</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m the women who changes her handbag daily to coordinate with my shoes. My daily wardrobe revolves around my shoes and handbags.  This has made my life easy.  Everything small that usually falls into the pit of my handbag is now in this tote.  Lift the tote out and I&#x27;m ready to switch to the next bag.  I truly don&#x27;t know how I have lived all these years without this fab tote.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT  LOVE IT  LOVE IT</li>
    <li> This bag is sturdy and the pockets are good. I like the two zip pockets that go with the length of the bag for papers and what-not...</li>
    <li> Wish they had more colors to choose this would have been much better as a gift idea for others, .</li>
    <li> Smaller than it appear on the picture. Does provide extra organized storage for the bag. Material is not as good as the other one I ordered.</li>
    <li> This has made it so much easier to find everything in my purse quickly.&lt;br /&gt;It has many pockets and two zipper compartments and is very sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;Great Service ... it arrived very quickly.</li>
    <li> Works like its supposed to -- I wish I could find this exact thing just an inch or too taller, but didn&#x27;t have much luck.  Other than that, works great.</li>
    <li> Shipping by merchant fast.  Organizer OK but there are no slots for pens or pencils.  I need those.  Will keep for gift giving</li>
    <li> This is a great organizer, it is for larger handbags but works well.  I carry lots of stuff.  It is lightweight.</li>
    <li> This organizer is great for big purses but the size I usually use it&#x27;s a little bit too big.  Otherwise it&#x27;s a&lt;br /&gt;great organizer.</li>
    <li> Not as big as I had hoped. Originally planned to use it for school but it fits perfectly in my purse! I would recommend for your purse.</li>
    <li> The item is much smaller than I thought it would be. I have a tote that needed organized and I thought this would work.  For my purpose it is to small.  I am not returning it - to much trouble. Maybe I can use it to organize one of my smaller purses.</li>
    <li> Was disappointed thought it was a lot bigger</li>
    <li> Its very handy. It must have lastwd 3 yrs.</li>
    <li> This is much smaller than it appears.  If you use the inside zipper compartments, the outside pockets are rendered virtually useless. It also slips over onto it&#x27;s side inside your purse. Having said all that, I&#x27;m still using it, so it must be OK.</li>
    <li> I used this organizer for a week with no problems. I did not over stuff it or treat it unkindly.  Alas, I just noticed that the stitching that divides the outer pockets in two is coming apart.  Will have to look for a more robust alternative before it eventually disintegrates.</li>
    <li> I bought this item hoping it will help me find the things I have in my purse.  But when you put the items inside the two zippered compartment it is hard to get into the middle section.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s useful as an insert. As my bag is big and I wished the bag has 2 more inches on the length.</li>
    <li> I really like knowing where to find things in my purse! This is not a large item, so it doesn&#x27;t work very well in big bags (it falls over), but works perfectly in midsize bags.</li>
    <li> I was a bit hestitant of a purse organizer, but ordered and found now I can not be with out one.  perfect organizer</li>
    <li> Great product!  It is just the right size.  It is also very lightweight to start with so your purse doesn&#x27;t get too heavy with all the items that fit into the organizer!</li>
