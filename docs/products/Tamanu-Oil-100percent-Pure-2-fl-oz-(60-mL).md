      <li>I use it to moisturize my face 2x&#x27;s/day to boost my mix of facial oils(mostly camellia &amp; ricebran oil w/2 droppers full of rosehip seed &amp; tamanu oil all in a 1oz dark bottle.  </li>
      <li>After reading what the product is supposed to do I ordered it as I have very dry skin patches in certain areas of my face.</li>
      <li>I think the product is high-quality and pure, but it had minimal effect on anything i used it on.</li>
      <li>Soo glad I went ahead and spent the extra few bucks and ordered from a reliable company.  </li>

<li> Soo glad I went ahead and spent the extra few bucks and ordered from a reliable company.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using it daily but really see very little improvement.  </li>
<li> I have very combination skin that changes from one extreme to the other</li>
<li> This bottle should last me a long time maybe a year at this rate.  </li>
<li> This little bottle will last months if only used on the face.</li>
<li> In fact I have used olive oil and gotten tge same result and much less inexpensive.</li>
<li> Its like any other oil as long as your using it</li>
<li> Over the last few months I have been using the Konjac Sponge for cleansing and the dabbing tamanu oil on my eye area at night and in the am.  </li>
<li> but I use it every other night with a mix of other oils for dry, scared skin.</li>
<li> its like a sweet smell that is also a little wrong.  </li>
<li> It does what any other oil product does.</li>
<li> because if you are buying it for any other reason, the scent may cause you not to use it.</li>
<li> Rub hard on your scars two times daily.</li>
<li> A slight nutty scent, but I like it.  </li>
<li> Still, while it is heavy and greasy, it does not clog my pores.</li>
<li> I read an article somewhere to add tamanu oil to the oil blend to help with trouble skin.  </li>
<li> Use just a little because it is very heavy and greasy; also a bit smelly.</li>
<li> I used to use thick, expensive eye creams, but they were clogging my pores on that sensitive skin around my eyes.  </li>
<li> Within two weeks of applying this product, I had small bumps spreading gradually all over my face.  </li>
<li> Tanamu is no better than vitamin e or jojoba oil.</li>
<li> Not sure what to expect.</li>
<li> I have noticed a small difference, but then again I still have problem skin and acne keeps appearing.  </li>
<li> I cannot yet vouch for its effectiveness--I am just trying to get past the scent.  </li>
<li> this product is an oil, so it is thick.</li>
<li> In fact I have no more scars!  </li>
<li> And it&#x27;s subtle</li>
<li> This is unfortunate trial since I do not have any nut allergies.  </li>
<li> Sadly...</li>
<li> Therefore this product or oil is not best for me.</li>
<li> I use Cold Pressed Coconut Oil on my face and bod in winter.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I paid $14 for this oil.  I cannot yet vouch for its effectiveness--I am just trying to get past the scent.  The best way I can describe is like maple with some type of nut....its like a sweet smell that is also a little wrong.  Like a sweet smelling bug bait.  I bought the oil for its known properties as I have a few areas of my body that could surely benefit.  Sadly...I think I will only be using it at night before bed as I do not wish to walk around smelling the way this oil smells during the day.  I am hoping to find a combination of essential oils that will mask the smell of the Tamanu.  It is very strong and unyielding.  I say to only buy Tamanu oil if you need it...because if you are buying it for any other reason, the scent may cause you not to use it.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this purchase. It was packaged well, arrived in time and is just as described. I use it in making my own facial oil and it is perfect for that.</li>
    <li> I bought this oil after doing some research on oil cleansing and oils that will help improve scars. I don&#x27;t use this for oil cleansing (castor oil, jojoba, tea tree and lavender essential oils) but I use it every other night with a mix of other oils for dry, scared skin. And it&#x27;s subtle but I swear it&#x27;s helping the scars. And I know it&#x27;s helping the overall appearance of my skin. I love this oil.</li>
    <li> Over the last few months I have been using the Konjac Sponge for cleansing and the dabbing tamanu oil on my eye area at night and in the am.  My fine lines are ALL GONE.  I used to use thick, expensive eye creams, but they were clogging my pores on that sensitive skin around my eyes.  Since switching to tamanu oil I have noticed plumper skin and my fine lines beneath my eyes have disappeared.  So excited to have found a great, natural eye serum!  The smell is strong and make sure to not use too much around your eyes as it can sting.  Dab onto moist skin before bed and you&#x27;ll be all set.</li>
    <li> Very effective for controlling blemishes. Use just a little because it is very heavy and greasy; also a bit smelly. Still, while it is heavy and greasy, it does not clog my pores. As for the smell, it does not last or perhaps I got use to it. This little bottle will last months if only used on the face.</li>
    <li> I love this for my extremely dry skin.  It absorbs well.  A slight nutty scent, but I like it.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t get passed the smell of this oil.  I&#x27;m sure its great for the skin but I can&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> I was recommended this oil for problematic skin but was adviced that it does take a while and this is why i only gave it 4 stars. i do like the way my skin feels though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard great things about using this oil for scars, acne, blemishes, burns, etc.  I have been doing the OCM (oil cleansing method) for about 2 months now and love it.  I read an article somewhere to add tamanu oil to the oil blend to help with trouble skin.  I have noticed a small difference, but then again I still have problem skin and acne keeps appearing.  I rated this product a 5 star because i love the way the oil feels on my skin, even though it hasn&#x27;t helped my skin out the way that i was hoping.  Every person&#x27;s skin is different and reacts differently to products.  I would still recommend anyone to try this oil, because it may work wonders on you!</li>
    <li> Tanamu is no better than vitamin e or jojoba oil. Tanamu has a pungent odor.  Tanamu burns my eyes for hours if it gets near or around the eye area.  My scar did not change in color or texture using Tanamu.  Try emu oil and then add jojoba or vitamin e or all three but do not combine them in one bottle.  The oils works best applying them in layers.  Rub hard on your scars two times daily.</li>
    <li> I love the feel of the Tamanu Oil.  It is definitely thicker than Rose Hip Seed Oil which I use as well.  It moisturizes very well and smooth old acne scars slowly but surely.  I use Cold Pressed Coconut Oil on my face and bod in winter.  Will see how the Tamanu oil compares.</li>
    <li> I had a rash/dry spot on my leg the size of a quarter and have had many topical steroids, etc. prescribed. Years later, it is still there.  I have been using this oil for about a month and it is noticeably smaller, and looks to be healing nicely.  So far so good....</li>
    <li> This has a great smell, and makes the skin feel great.&lt;br /&gt;its a great and amazing five star product.&lt;br /&gt;i reccommend it to everyone who loves beauty.</li>
    <li> this product is an oil, so it is thick. it is very moisturizing and i loved it. i wear it after i get out of the shower if i&#x27;m not putting any make-up on.</li>
    <li> I mix this oil with Jojoba and i use it to moisturize my face at night. I think it does a good job and i am hoping that it will help remove some of my acne scars as well.</li>
    <li> I think the product is high-quality and pure, but it had minimal effect on anything i used it on.</li>
    <li> I use this oil to make my moisturizer.  Guess that is works - idk.  Try it for yourself.  I don&#x27;t have any compliants</li>
    <li> After reading what the product is supposed to do I ordered it as I have very dry skin patches in certain areas of my face. I&#x27;ve been using it daily but really see very little improvement.  Its like any other oil as long as your using it it moisturizes  the skin but doesn&#x27;t heal or really improve as suggested. I went one day without it to see if I would see any difference and there was none. My skin was basically the same. It does what any other oil product does. In fact I have used olive oil and gotten tge same result and much less inexpensive.</li>
    <li> I was hoping this oil would improve my acne scars.  Within two weeks of applying this product, I had small bumps spreading gradually all over my face.  With very oily skin it also dried my face a bit.  This is unfortunate trial since I do not have any nut allergies.  Therefore this product or oil is not best for me.</li>
    <li> So far it&#x27;s OK, but I don&#x27;t care for the smell.  Will have to give it more time.  Not sure what to expect.</li>
    <li> Soo glad I went ahead and spent the extra few bucks and ordered from a reliable company.  The bottle is nice and arived in Hawaii safely.  Here it is called Kamani oil and I have no time to make my own so this was a deal for me.  I use it to moisturize my face 2x&#x27;s/day to boost my mix of facial oils(mostly camellia &amp; ricebran oil w/2 droppers full of rosehip seed &amp; tamanu oil all in a 1oz dark bottle.  I have very combination skin that changes from one extreme to the other so I decided on using non-comedogenic oils to moisturize my face so it can get with the program and help itself.  I even use it at night in my homemade facial oil washing routine where i mixed 1/3 castor oil, 2/3 sunflower oil and added a dropperfull of tamanu oil and rose hipseed oil fo acne scars and uneven skintone and my face hasnt ever been this manageable and simplifed in my life.  My scars and craters on my face are smothing out and improving.  Soo glad i tried this.  In fact I have no more scars!  Just the illusion now from the craters since they have a shadow at certain angles. I guess I will add more camellia oil and ricebran for more collagen production. This bottle should last me a long time maybe a year at this rate.  Soon I will be making my own body oil to heal my stretch marks that are 4 years old already!  I read somewhere that this works best on old scars?  Will update if it works.  Lmk if you have any questions I&#x27;m more than happy to help&#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff I heard about on Dr. Oz. Haven&#x27;t found any irritations yet that it hasn&#x27;t improved, including the occasional pimple.</li>
    <li> bought for a friend who lives out in the desert as i do and has skin issues . works great and lasts a long time . one doesnt use more than a couple drops at a time . thanx .</li>
    <li> I use this oil in my teenage daughters oil for her face wash. This oil is great for acne prone skin epically those with red spots! And I personally think it smells wonderful!</li>
