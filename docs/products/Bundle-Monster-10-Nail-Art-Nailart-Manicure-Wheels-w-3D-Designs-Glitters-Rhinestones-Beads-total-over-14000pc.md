<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Got this for my mom to use while she is making designs and stuff. There easy to drop and make a mess, they stick pretty good to the nail and they don&#x27;t fall from there. There pretty and has a lot of options.</li>
    <li> Got them fast, great assortment of shapes and colors.  Would have liked more gems but for the price you cannot beat it.</li>
    <li> I love it....and the price is great. For the price I find it to be a great deal...shipping was pretty fast....I will def buy more from this buyer &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I was completely satisfied with this product. The wheels are miniature (about the size of the bottom of a regular mug) and cute and all the little rhinestones,beads,glitter pieces, and confetti were adorable. They all varied in colors and not many were repeated which was good. :) I have to admit that when they arrived some of the partitions in the wheels had mixed stones and such, but i didn&#x27;t mind picking them out and sorting them. It wasn&#x27;t too bad :D I use them every week-2 weeks when i do my nails!</li>
    <li> I love this product I can do so man cute designs now. Its really changed the way I design nails and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. It did take some time to organize the little pieces but it was well worth it. I will totally by buying more products from this seller!</li>
    <li> So these came quick which is what I expect from Bundle Monster.  I got my image plates quickly as well.  I didnt have any problems with my stones being mixed up.  I think I had one where a few pieces had went to visit neighbors but thats about it.  No need for any serious sorting and what little sorting I did do took 5 mins if that.  I did have some stars that were in big chunks.  Like they didnt get sliced down.  But other than that I am satisfied with my purchase and will update if I find something I dont like.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed to see the wheels are actually smaller than what is pictured on here. Granted, it may have been a close-up but it still doesn&#x27;t justify the fact that there was many repeats of the same stones and colors. Also, many of the designs were combined and actually outside of the wheel compartment. I take it was because of the shipping but it still looks a bit messy when you&#x27;re taking it out of the box for the first time. I took a wheel to my salon and asked them to add some stones to my full set, only to find the majority of them falling off...even with it sealed with UV Gel....after about 4 days. I&#x27;ll give it another shot, but for now, presentation wasn&#x27;t that great and the repeats totally made me not want this product.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with this purchase.  I received my rhinestones super quick.  When I received my order I could not believe how many rhinestones I got, there are so many.  For the price this is a GREAT BUY!!!  I have even placed another order with Bundle Monster. I can&#x27;t wait to get my stuff:)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure whether I like this or not. There are more sequins (not glitter) than rhinestones or tiny beads. There&#x27;s a great variety of designs but I wish it had more rhinestones. Also the packaging is kind of flimsy. Some of the pieces fall out quite easily. I tried using the sequins on my nails, but they are just too rough for my taste.</li>
    <li> The disks are the size of my palms, they were a little mixed up but individually packaged so it was easy to sort them out. I noticed that after two weeks some of the color had come off or really faded, so it&#x27;s better to put them under the acrylic. Also, there&#x27;s not any duplicates. The title is misleading. There&#x27;s not very many rhinestones in there</li>
    <li> I really like this product i did read reviews from other people that bought this and was a little worried about everything being all over the place, this was not the case, there were a couple of the tiny beads that had worked their way into a different compartment but so what, the packaging was great. This was shipped out of Hawaii and I am in Florida quite a long trip. Any way my daughter and I used these today on our nails we made different color flowers on our toe nails and they came out great the color did not rub off when we applied the top coat or anything. some of the sequin I don&#x27;t think we will use for our nail, but my daughter likes artwork so it will most likely be used for that. there were a couple repeats, but its o.k. since its rhinestones that were repeated which is mostly what we use. Buying this kit and doing our nail is much cheaper then going to the salon. I am very happy with this product and would certainly buy it again.</li>
    <li> Arrived right on time (about a week) and in perfect condition. Some of the patterns got mixed up in shipping but it&#x27;s no fault of the seller. Merely the trouble with mail handling. It doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. I just grab what I need as I do my nail art. They are pretty, there&#x27;s LOTS of shapes and colors. I&#x27;m VERY pleased!</li>
    <li> Pros:  - shipped incredibly fast  - offers a wide variety of glitters, rhinestones, and beads  - great for beginners and young adults  - very colorful and vibrant selection  Cons:  - wheels are so much smaller than expected (the size of a bundle monster nail art stamp plate)  - the wheels are difficult to turn  - many of the rhinestones and other glitters are pretty big and are not very subtle on finger nails, maybe used on toe nails  The product is great for the reasons mentioned above. It would offer a great variety for someone who is starting out and does not want to spend a fortune on crystals and beads.  My biggest issue with the glitters and rhinestones is that they are so large.  I wanted to use the rhinestones as the centers to flower designs but they cover the whole flower! Again, it is all about personal preference but I can not imagine trying to fit more than a few crystals or rhinestones on your finger nail and not looking like mardi gras on your hand! I think that these sized stones are better fit for toe nail designs.  Also, regarding the tiny colored beads, I used the pink ones and set them in place with some glue. After the glue dried I used a top coat to seal the tiny beads, the color bled all over my nails! The little colored beads will bleed. I do not suggest anyone use them! Other than that I think that hte stars and rhinestones are cute.  Again, I gave it a 3 out of 5 because the wheels are smaller than anticipated, the stones/glitters are larger than anticipated, and the colored beads bled.</li>
    <li> This bundle was a great deal.  It was part of a gift of nail items for a 13-year-old girl.  She really loved these.  Things to be aware of: the wheels are much smaller than you think they are going to be; some of the tiny little gems get mixed together during shipment; and, you need something to apply them with as they are tiny for your fingers to handle them.  I would buy them again.</li>
    <li> Love my stuff and the service from bundle monster. I know my mother had bought some of my Xmas from them and had no problems. The stuff is smaller than I pictured but it doesn&#x27;t affect the product. There are also no duplicates. They also got back to me fast about a question I had. I will for sure be buying from them again! Worth my time and money!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll admit a lot of the rhinestones and beads were mixed up and it took a while to put them in order.  It took me about an hour and a half and honestly I don&#x27;t see how it could take anyone 17 hours, I think that must have been quite an exaggeration.  Anyway, even though it was frustrating it gave me a chance to really look through all the different designs and I love most of them.  I will tell you that I did find the color of the tiny beads would rub off when I put a top coat on but through all the frustration of that and the sorting I can honestly say that if I had to do it all over again I would.  You just can&#x27;t beat the price and I truly do like the product.</li>
    <li> This is worth every penny. I was looking for rhinestones because i like having them in the center of flowers when i get my nails done. I decided that spending 5-10 on art alone was getting to be too much. I saw all the other bundles and the single ones that were being sold between $6-$15 so i figured if i could get 10 of them for $18 i was getting the best deal ever because some were selling 4 for $30. Bought it and nothing arrived so i contacted  bundle monster and they were super duper fast in responding i waited a couple days to check my email and turns out they replied by the next day. They informed me it had been lost during shipping and that they would send me another which was fine because i was in no rush and i got the 2nd one within 2-4 days. So happy with bundle monster and with these rhinestones!!  So many designs and sizes i haven&#x27;t even used them yet. An extremely good buy!</li>
    <li> I love the Bundle Monster they came in a small box wrap and number individual  they are a little smaller that the ones you buy at the store. But they are beautiful and the price is very good. Now I can have fun doing my nails.</li>
    <li> I ordered this and received really qick shipping which is great.. but they are so small and the beads are mixed up from being tossed around in the mail. Not what I was expecting but it&#x27;s not bad. There are a one or two wheels that look like they are the same thing. The wheels itslf are smaller than what they appear in the picture.</li>
    <li> I love this product I got it fast and there is lots of fun things I can do with it I might order tons more. Its fun to use on moms and girls day :)</li>
    <li> This was a pretty good purchase but...when I got my order some of the wheels were doubles, and a couple of beads and rhinestones were mixed up. But they look really nice on my nails.</li>
    <li> My customers, young and more mature alike, enjoy the embelishment these little jewels add to their nails. I will buy these again, and plan to keep a supply in my supplies at all times.</li>
    <li> I love these! I got no repeats and I seriously got it Saturday when I ordered it late Thursday! Being as I live in Hawaii THATS AMAZING! I cannot wait to try them out!</li>
    <li> este producto me encanto, tiene mucha variacion de pedreria y demas cosas para hacer arte en tus unas, es super economico y tiene muchisimas opciones para hacer combinaciones en tu hermosas unas, lo recomiendo para cualquiera que este pensando en ir a las tiendas, no lo hagas, compralo aqui, te va a encantar.</li>
    <li> I love to do my nails so this is in my collection.friends and family love to come over for nail art night.</li>
    <li> The pic looked great! The price was greater! Bought the Bundle Monster 10 wheel set without thinking twice. Got my box! SUPER EXITED! Opened my box-face fell to the floor. The wheels are TEEENY TIINY and the stones and beads were all mixed up into each compartment. Very disappointing, took me 7 hours to sort it all out. The wheels look HUGE on here-but they&#x27;re about the size of a Chips Ahoy cookie :(</li>
    <li> This came before the date expected to arrive which was great because I was going away the next day for a week :D the only thing is that some of the pieces were mixed in with other ones, mostly the little tiny beads which are not easy to reorganize because they are VERY tiny! good size of gems and decals. but i wish there were more sizes of gems, they only really come in a larger size</li>
    <li> this product is great and came without any breaking I recommend this to anyone who wants to play with their nails!</li>
    <li> when i received this in the mail, all the different designs were all mixed up. i had to separate them  all! there were many repeats too.  after 17 hours of sorting and reorganizing, im satisfied somewhat.  After putting a topcoat on the pieces to secure them to my nail, most of the color comes off. I would NEVER buy this again</li>
    <li> So o love the product absolutely worth it to me, only gave 4 stars because I was sent the wrong product at first. but after contacting Mandishop I received my actual product and I was told to keep the product I had originally received and the 4 stars is because I received my actual item later than my received item that wasn&#x27;t what I wanted so good product good store great contact through email very happy with my product</li>
    <li> If you know what you&#x27;re doing with nails then these will be a dream for you. They&#x27;re all very pretty and colorful. They come with a great selection, but you have to have a very steady hand &amp; a lot of patience to get them in the exact place you want. I also had a hard time getting them to stay in place after the nail polish dried.</li>
    <li> I assumed that the wheels would have a small amount of different designs and types, but there was a good amount of each (even for the doubles that were there). They came exactly as described.   My nail art came packaged with another purchase from Bundle Monster, so they were packed in nice and tight. The box was reinforced with tape along with the industrial glue used on the package. The wheels were in individual packages numbered 1-10 (1 &amp; 2 actually weren&#x27;t numbered, but the rest were). The wheels themselves are small, but that&#x27;s not too much of a bother for me (they are just holding nail art, after all). What I like about them is that you don&#x27;t actually have to open them. There&#x27;s a slot on the wheels that allows you to just pick them out of there with a tool.  Unfortunately, the wheels aren&#x27;t sealed tight enough to stop the beads and whatnot from getting jostled and moving into other compartments. That was the only problem with the whole package.   Definitely worth the purchase :]</li>
    <li> I like the fact that they give you so many but when using them they don&#x27;t stay on the nails with out glue.... plus u have to put extra top coat on them to keep them from catching on things...</li>
    <li> I bought these thinking I would be doing finger nails, but I use them more for crafting and my clay work than anything else. have to  buy more!! Good price great quality!</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong spending 18 dollars for 10 wheels.  Merchants have been selling 1 wheel for about 8 dollars.  The possibilities are endless.  I&#x27;m so excited to start using them. I will be buying from this seller again. 2 Thumbs Up!</li>
    <li> Great and responsible Seller...and selling at a very reasonable prize.  Plus...i received the items before the expected date.  Thanks a lot.</li>
    <li> Im giving four stars because the plastic thing that holds the various things needs to be upgraded!!! Like everyone else comments they are all mixed up partly due to shipping...Even though it seems like this is packed upside down its impossible to know if its usps or bundle monster&#x27;s fault.  But overall I am extremely happy I got no duplicates and the mini circle holder that houses the various jewels and such are a good size for whats in them,  After i get used to putting them on my nails and get a better tool for picking them up I will be in love!</li>
    <li> It came very quick... Everything was great the only complain I have is most of it came mixed up and I had to fix them</li>
    <li> Wish they had more variety in color but overall I like the different shapes. The packaging was nice but some of the  rhinestones were mixed up. Overall its worth the purchase if u are a diy person like myself.</li>
    <li> I am not in love with these but they are what they advertised for the most part.  I don&#x27;t like how they feel on my nails and some were too large or my nails are too small and since my nails are quite curved they won&#x27;t stay on but others wouldn&#x27;t stay on either unless they were really small.  My daughters nails are more flat so they work better.  i just put them in a baggie as they do fall out.</li>
    <li> i got them for nail art and they do the job...cant complain....now i just need to fill the required words.</li>
    <li> My wife used them and really enjoyed them they were very nice, and would recommend them to anyone that does nails.</li>
    <li> I was so excited for these...it took over a month for them to arrive and when they did the gems were mixed in the discs and too tiny to resort. Would return but make do with this. Not happy with overall product/packaging.</li>
    <li> I just opened these and I&#x27;m already in love with them. They may not be bundle monster brand per say, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me at all considering what I received. Firstly, all the wheels were sealed in such a way that most of the pieces stayed inside of each individual space, with minimal mixing. I received 9 wheels, and then a packet of 12 different colored microbeads, each in their own little mini bottles. The amount appears to be more than it would be if they were in a wheel, and this obviously prevents the colors from mixing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other wheels included:&lt;br /&gt;1 wheel of pearl rhinestones, various sizes&lt;br /&gt;1 wheel of different colored beads&lt;br /&gt;1 wheel of different colored flowers&lt;br /&gt;1 wheel of different colored hearts&lt;br /&gt;1 wheel of different colored bows&lt;br /&gt;1 wheel of neon stars and hearts&lt;br /&gt;1 wheel of metallic rhinestones, various sizes, and&lt;br /&gt;1 wheel of smaller, different colored Rhinestones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t get any stars or moons like in the pictures, but I already have stars so I&#x27;m not so disappointed by that. I&#x27;m so excited with the bows and the hearts. I think that, depending on the sender, it will vary in what you receive, but i am so happy with this, i would definitely recommend this seller!</li>
    <li> NICE VARIETY AND PLENTY OF COLORS, COMES IN HANDY WHEN YOU WANT TO HAVE SOME NAIL FUN AND TRY NEW THINGS</li>
    <li> These were really cute for the cost and come in a variety of decorations from stones to beads to plastic images and glitters too. I am happy with what I received.</li>
    <li> The set is amazing, it has so many different colors that I would like to paint my nails everyday just to use them.  :-D&lt;br /&gt;It defenitely complement my nail polish briefcase.</li>
    <li> Awesome amount of variety and a must have for your nail art collection. I will definitely order this item again :)</li>
    <li> So excited to get this in the mail along with my fake nails to try some nail art. There was a lot of variety which I liked but some pieces came out of the ox and one set wasn&#x27;t taped so it may have been used [previously. Over-all very satisfied. It only got three stars because on the box it said it comes with applicator and nail polish which it doesn&#x27;t but the supplier doesn&#x27;t specify that so I AM OKAY WITH PURCHASE.</li>
    <li> Getting these rhinestones was exciting!  They came SOOOOOOO quickly in the mail.  My daughter and I have been using them about every 3-4 days.  We painted American flags with rhinestones for the stars for the the 4th of July.  Everyone loved them.</li>
    <li> Super super super tiny!!! Great for nails!!!</li>
    <li> Keep in mind you get what you pay for the wheels are smaller then ones you might get in most stores, some of the flakes and beads got a bit mixed up in transit and the shipping takes a while either way you get a tone of confetti sequins, rhinestones and micro beads would make awsome party favors for like a teen girls party.</li>
    <li> 1st of they were packed Individually but because alot of them are tiny they get out and mixed all up..alot of trays had empty slot..there where alot of little stones stuck to the tape on boxing, packaging .The majority of them are 1mm and don&#x27;t make a big impact unless u put a lot of them on in a cluster..your better off buying them in store at a higher price cause you will get all u pay for and see the size..not to happy with this order at all..learned lesson but rhinestones in store because u don&#x27;t get what u expect when u order this product..very un happy customer..would love a refund ..</li>
    <li> This is a really good item, and I really like it! The only problem is that I got 9 wheels instead of 10. But I honestly think 9 is enough! There is so many things in each wheel! I think it was worth the money!</li>
    <li> wasn&#x27;t what the picture showed. it was 2 different wheels. but 5 of each. 😔 turn down</li>
    <li> The wheels have a good amount of rhinestones and other stuff in each section but there is a fair amount of repeat items. I&#x27;ve used maybe 10 different items so far and they all work great with nail art. My only problem so far is a few of the pearl bead things lost their color when I applied my topcoat. I feel like the price is unbeatable so the little things aren&#x27;t deal breakers.</li>
    <li> Well when i read about this product i was really amazed and thought wow 14000 pcs and a promise of NO DOUBLES  when it arrived (fast, thanx for that) i found many doubles, not only that but the wheels aren&#x27;t tight enough so the containers missed some pieces and got mixed up!! i was disappointed but for the price of the product it&#x27;s ok i guess</li>
    <li> Great selection. The wheels are poor quality. Difficult to select your pleasure, they don&#x27;t turn very easy. All the items get mixed together to they don&#x27;t seal well.</li>
    <li> Pretty good quality, and a good variety. I bought it as a gift for my sister, and I think she&#x27;ll really be pleased. However, the packaging is deplorable. They come in the round containers shown, with little sealed plastic bags over them. The containers are cheap and the tops don&#x27;t fit snugly and (worse) don&#x27;t keep the sections separated. The glitter/rhinestones get everywhere because they&#x27;re not adequately separated; they get into other segments within the container, but they also somehow get out of the container entirely and just float around the plastic bag. This is going to take me FOREVER to sort out... literally hours upon hours of sorting tiny specks of glitter because of a low quality container. Not a crisis and not the worst thing to ever happen to me; I&#x27;ll probably just sort it all out while watching TV later. But, I think it&#x27;s definitely something to take into consideration before you buy this product.</li>
    <li> I really like and enjoy the Bundle Monster nail art wheels. They help me with making better designs and My friends like them too. Thank you. Clayre</li>
    <li> Woww!  My mother asked me what are you gonna do with all that? and I laughed jajajaja  I really liked. I&#x27;m still surprised by the variety of models and designs.  Some designs are mixed together and that saddened me, then, with help from my mom managed to separate them and they are fantastic.  Buy again and when I run out I will.</li>
    <li> Item shipped incredibly fast, and while the wheels are small, (about 2.5 inches/6cm or so in diameter) they are not smaller than expected. These items are for nail tips, not clothing, so the size of the case compared to the size of the sequin compared to the size of the tip of my nail gave me a pretty good idea what to expect. Each wheel received in the package was unique and where there were one or two wheels with one or two of the same sequins/rhinestones duplicated, the variety received was really good. I do recommend using a nail glue for the sequins as a top coat wasn&#x27;t quite enough to keep the sequins on my hands for more than a day or so, but for a flatter nail that is less frequently used (big toe) I have no problem with a simple top coat to seal them on the nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend a good pair of pointed tweezers for application. Slanted tip/rounded tip just weren&#x27;t precise enough.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. These work just fine and I love decorating nails and using these as an extra kick. But the picture is decieving. You dont get nearly as many as in the picture.I would say a third of each. You do get all the different types with the exception of one or two doubles. But for the price, it is what it is.</li>
    <li> I am diving into the \\&quot;nail art\\&quot; craze and decided that hands down, for the price, this was a must have... and I am SO GLAD I did!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, please do not let reviews of horrible packaging snafus or the other reviews of having to open and sort these even make you stop buying this set for even one moment. They are not that bad when they arrive. I guess either Bundle Monster has begun to send them differently or something because mine were still sorted when they arrived.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh... and the shipping was fast as well!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, this is an AWESOME collection of nail doo-dads! There are stones, die cut pieces and uber-mini pearls.... and there is such a plethora of shapes and sizes - you should NOT pass this up! I saw dots and playboy bunnies and shamrocks and hearts and even Mickey Mouse heads! I was so happy I purchased this! It is not just rhinestones... it is flat cut-outs (die-cuts?) and super tiny \\&quot;pearls\\&quot; of all colors! Just a great set to have!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, each of these \\&quot;pods\\&quot; is about the size of a grouping of 4 quarters - they ARE small. But they have a lot of pieces in each section of the wheel. And there are no other packs with 14,000 pieces going for this price!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pick this up - you will be so glad you did!!</li>
    <li> I only got five of the 10 wheels and what was in them were not all that were shown in the pictures. There are a lot of duplicates of colors and shapes of rhinestones. Not happy at all.</li>
    <li> didnt come packaged like it was supposed to and i had no idea that anyone even made wheels that small. wow.</li>
    <li> When I bought it I thought its better than this, the wheels are tiny and the quantity aren&#x27;t fair some of them are almost empty, and they has the same kind and color more than once. Also when I opened the box I find one of the wheels glitters are dispersed outside and stuck on the plastic cover. This exactly what \\&quot; crap for money\\&quot; is!!!</li>
    <li> I love the variety that came with these and the price just couldn&#x27;t be beat.  I&#x27;ll be able to come up with a years worth of nails designs with these!</li>
    <li> The pin wheels are in fact much smaller than they look in the picture.  Some of the rhinestones are mixed up with the others but mine personally wasn&#x27;t that bad.  I do wish they had more just silver studded rhinestones or even different sizes of the regular circular rhinestones but really, I got a HUGE variety of shapes and colors for a good price.  I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I was kind of skeptical to order this, but I am very pleased with the product. Yes some of the rhinestones and glitter did not stay in their correct \\&quot;slots\\&quot; but it was NO where near what I was expecting to find from other reviews. Honestly I can&#x27;t blame them, being shipped x amount of miles and the the sequins are soo teeny tiny and thin. I was very happy with the product and they look great on my nails</li>
    <li> Bought the Rhinestone Beads for my 17 yo daughter, she thought she closed the container, there were everywhere. She is still experimenting with them.</li>
    <li> In the picture shown all the Gem rings shown were different.  When I received the package I got 10 rings but 5 of one kind and 5 of another,  and the rings had barely any gems in each one.</li>
    <li> I gave a box of these to one of my Granddaughters and it was like I gave her the world!  All her cousins were delighted with them .. and I only wish I had given them each a set.  If you have a tween or teen .. this is the perfect gift.</li>
    <li> What great designs ... highly recommend these</li>
    <li> I know, I know. This is coming directly from China but, I&#x27;ve ordered things from this seller before and never had a problem. Fast delivery under the circumstances and great products. Like the saying goes though, You pays your money, you takes your chances. Right? So, yes the wheels are teeny tiny but I&#x27;ve come to expect that. What I didn&#x27;t expect was to get 10 of the same wheel.....yes I said 10 of the same wheel. All the same colors and all the same shapes in each. Oh well! What are you gonna do for $12.00?</li>
    <li> I bought this for the wife . She has been using it for several months now with no trouble ..&lt;br /&gt;seems to be a good product !! would buy it again .</li>
    <li> These charms were ABSOLUTELY adorable,  the colors are sooo pretty and go well together in lots of different combos. They are also dainty.  I Lovvvve them &amp; plan on ordering more ...for myself &amp; some for my daughter...</li>
    <li> This product is exactly what I was looking for it is enough to start my nail polish line....Thank you much</li>
    <li> Saw them and really wanted them, I was a little disappointed because then picture shown online they looked really big but they were small:( but I&#x27;m still satisfied with them an really like them... The packaging seeme good but some get out other that that this was a great thing I get.</li>
    <li> A ton of cute shapes come in these little wheels! Super cheap to do yourself and not have to pay a nail tech!</li>
    <li> This is an awesome variety pack! Glitter, Microbeads, rhinestones, and 3d decals! The packaging was very good too! I&#x27;ve purchased similiar items that arrived broken or mixed up this is really good quality!</li>
    <li> I received 9 of the same exact combinations. Only 1 different wheel from the others . The jewels come unorganized with all the handling during shipping I&#x27;m assuming. For the price its worth it.</li>
    <li> A wonderful selection of decent quality embellishments I use for nail art. The colors do not fade or run with a top coat.</li>
    <li> Very happy with item and was excited that it was delivered early</li>
    <li> While the variety was decent I received 2 each of 5 different wheels, so I had duplicates of everything. Only had one wheel that was really bad with migrating items. Inconsistent fill on the compartments, mainly with regards to the micro beads. Some micro bead compartments were very full while others were barely half full. The wheels are also smaller than other wheels I have received. There are some very nice items that I do look forward to using.</li>
    <li> I received my package containing 10 small nail art wheels that were fully packed, and contained and amazingly good assortment of nail art in a variety of designs and beautiful  colors. This collection is a MUST HAVE for anyone who enjoys decorating their nails. the sizes included are approximately 1-2 mm in size, the beads are even smaller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can expect during shipment some of the product getting a little mixed up or loose during the shipment, which is no fault of the sellers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And first and foremost you can&#x27;t beat the price for the product received. The package deal is well worth the money spent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definately buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I received these fast, in great shape (only a few needed to be redistributed) and exactly as described.&lt;br /&gt;I love the variety of shapes and colors these come in. Thank you</li>
    <li> This came early, which was nice. There are 10 wheel, and the rhinestones, glitters, beads etc. are very beautiful, some of the stuff are mixed up, but if you have bought wheels before, well that’s a normal thing. Sadly thou the wheels are no way even close to being as full as the ones shown in the picture. I would say most are about half the amount shown in the picture and others are even less than that shown in the picture. Honestly for the $12.12 I paid for it, I feel cheated.</li>
    <li> it was small, and i can take it everyhwere i want</li>
    <li> loved the selection. so many its hard to decide what to do. they are small so u definetley need tweezers preferably small ones. it cmes with a varity of flowers hearts stars playboy bunnies dolphins circles beads( tiny tiny beads) jewels in a varity of colors. i mean just an amazing selection. the one thing i did notice is some of my favorites ended up not having as much in slots compared to the rest. but still more than enough to do lots of designs. the package arrived 3+ days earlier than expected.i got saturday delivery without paying for it. very nice and excited i got to spend the day playing around with my nails,</li>
    <li> Wonderful set lots of choices to uses. Fun to use and lots of great ideas to create for kids and adults for toes or nails</li>
    <li> They came all mixed up and many had to be thrown out!  Will never buy this crap again !  Waste of money!</li>
    <li> 1) I got a total of two different wheels. I got eight copies of the first one and two copies of the second one. EIGHT!! I expected maybe one or two designs to repeat, but not an entire wheel! Especially not eight copies of the same wheel!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) They are mixed up. Some of the wheels have half the wheel empty, and the other side is completely mixed. Now, I guess I don&#x27;t really need to sort that wheel, since I have EIGHT copies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) They contain a lot of static. This makes it really hard to sort out. They keep sticking to the tweezers, and the top of the wheel. Since they stick to the top of the wheel, they keep getting mixed up (even after you sort them).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this purchase was not worth the trouble...</li>
