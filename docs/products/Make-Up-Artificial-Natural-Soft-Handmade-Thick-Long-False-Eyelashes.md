      <li>so I&#x27;ve had to learn to apply my own lashes COUNTLESS times.  </li>
      <li>These are my favorite pair of lashes so far since purchasing lashes online.</li>
      <li>but they&#x27;re fun to use when you go out/ costume up,</li>
      <li>My favorite lashes so far</li>
      <li>These lashes were complimentary to my eyes, and adding mascara made my makeup look very &#x27;dressy!&#x27;</li>
      <li>I just tried them the first time for a special date with my fianc&amp;eacute; and not only do they look really naturally thick and beautiful and go on super easily</li>
      <li>Would definitely recommend and I plan on buying them again soon :3</li>
      <li>I was looking for lashes that are not over the top but definitely noticeable and accents your eyes!</li>
      <li>It is true that the &amp;#34;strip&amp;#34; where you apply the glue is kind of thick</li>
      <li>but I really like the way these flare at the ends.</li>
      <li>They arrived really fast.</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend!</li>
      <li>I just received my lashes the other day, I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like them because of how they looked in the package.</li>
      <li>Normally by the time I get off work I am ready to take my lashes off.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve ordered a TON of stuff off of amazon, but these are hands down THE BEST false lashes I&#x27;ve ever worn and I was a model, actress and stage performer for 10 years</li>
      <li>Was surprised by the realistic look.</li>
      <li>these got here pretty fast but were not at all what I expected.  </li>
      <li>They are too hard in my opinion they should be more flexible for the price</li>
      <li>Tried using rubbing alcohol to get rid of it, but it didn&#x27;t take off the residue completely.</li>
      <li>Super stiff, and super thick band.</li>
      <li>The wings on the ones in the picture are way longer, more dramatic.</li>

<li> Super stiff, and super thick band.</li>
<li> The wings on the ones in the picture are way longer, more dramatic.</li>
<li> The are plain straight if to bed them</li>
<li> Although it comes packaged in a box, weirdly enough, there&#x27;s strange residue on the flip side of the lashes- where you&#x27;d put the glue.  </li>
<li> I cannot work with the thick lash band, so if you have trouble with large bands, these are not for you!</li>
<li> They did not look like pictured at all, longer in the center and not at all winged.</li>
<li> but these lashes are so comfy that I feel like I could sleep in them and not regret it the next morning when you normally have to pull the twisted things off if u accidentally fall asleep in them.  </li>
<li> With other lashes it would always take me an hour or 2 or NEVER to get used to them and not feel like they were poking at me or one was falling off or they looked</li>
<li> To me they seem a bit lighter on my eyes then some of your other name band lashes .</li>
<li> These were my first false lashes, and they definately did the trick!</li>
<li> I&#x27;ll only use this on background actors where we don&#x27;t have to stare too hard at the actresses.</li>
<li> With previous lashes, I felt as if two heavy wings were sitting on my eyes.</li>
<li> They don&#x27;t feel heavy like others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
<li> They did not look big and fake like some of your thicker lashes.</li>
<li> and I&#x27;m not entirely sure what it is.  </li>
<li> I could seriously wear these everyday</li>
<li> That thick band is the bane of my existence as a make up artist.  </li>
<li> They hage no curve , difficult to put on</li>
<li> These are so awkward looking and are not flexible at all.</li>
<li> Looked very fake to me, but they stood out and that&#x27;s what I was going for in my costume.</li>
<li> Slightly disappointed.</li>

    <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever written a review on anything ans I&#x27;ve ordered a TON of stuff off of amazon, but these are hands down THE BEST false lashes I&#x27;ve ever worn and I was a model, actress and stage performer for 10 years so I&#x27;ve had to learn to apply my own lashes COUNTLESS times.  I used to buy the ones from the drug store, but never again!  I just tried them the first time for a special date with my fianc&amp;eacute; and not only do they look really naturally thick and beautiful and go on super easily and evenly- they are SUPER COMFORTABLE.  With other lashes it would always take me an hour or 2 or NEVER to get used to them and not feel like they were poking at me or one was falling off or they looked asymmetrical- but these lashes are so comfy that I feel like I could sleep in them and not regret it the next morning when you normally have to pull the twisted things off if u accidentally fall asleep in them.  I just used my regular glue that I already had from some drug store, so i know it has to be the lashes.  I could seriously wear these everyday they go on so quickly.  WOW, just really happy I discovered these!! totally fab!</li>
    <li> Love these lashes!! The shipping takes awhile, but I order two cases at a time..I recommend these</li>
    <li> The eyelashes pictured were not the ones that I received. The wings on the ones in the picture are way longer, more dramatic. Slightly disappointed.</li>
    <li> I Love this lashes they are easy to put on and look absolutely beautiful, and are great to use on any occasion since they&#x27;re not over the top... My favorite lashes so far</li>
    <li> They hage no curve , difficult to put on</li>

    <li> Love these lashes , They lok so nice on my 👀</li>
    <li> That thick band is the bane of my existence as a make up artist.  I&#x27;ll only use this on background actors where we don&#x27;t have to stare too hard at the actresses.</li>
    <li> Love love the lightness of these lashes! They don&#x27;t feel heavy like others I&#x27;ve tried. With previous lashes, I felt as if two heavy wings were sitting on my eyes. These lashes were complimentary to my eyes, and adding mascara made my makeup look very &#x27;dressy!&#x27; Would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> These are not even curved so you could use then on your eyes. The are plain straight if to bed them is possible I would like to know how. Not use able in the condition these came in</li>
    <li> I just received my lashes the other day, I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like them because of how they looked in the package. But to my surprise these lashes are GREAT&amp;#62; the were very sturdy and easy to put on. They did not look big and fake like some of your thicker lashes. To me they seem a bit lighter on my eyes then some of your other name band lashes . Normally by the time I get off work I am ready to take my lashes off. Not these they seem to be  so comfortable that I have to remember that I have the on. I now I will order another set  on my next purchase with Amazon.....</li>
    <li> These were my first false lashes, and they definately did the trick! They&#x27;re great.</li>
    <li> in love with my wife, if she&#x27;s happy, I&#x27;m happy...</li>
    <li> I found them difficult top put on and getting them to stay on. They are too hard in my opinion they should be more flexible for the price you get what you pay for</li>
    <li> I was looking for lashes that are not over the top but definitely noticeable and accents your eyes! These lashes are amazing! The people noticed a difference when i put it. Easy to put on, and they blend very well with my lashes! Definitely worth it!</li>
    <li> I bought these for use on halloween, they worked super well! Looked very fake to me, but they stood out and that&#x27;s what I was going for in my costume. Good deal!</li>
    <li> These are so awkward looking and are not flexible at all. Super stiff, and super thick band.</li>
    <li> I admire these lashes! Second to best from a lot I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> If you can wait three weeks to get 10 pairs of lashes on the cheap, then this is the product for you.  It&#x27;s definitely not &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; looking lashes- but they&#x27;re fun to use when you go out/ costume up, etc.  Although it comes packaged in a box, weirdly enough, there&#x27;s strange residue on the flip side of the lashes- where you&#x27;d put the glue.  It looks fuzzy/ feathery and I&#x27;m not entirely sure what it is.  Tried using rubbing alcohol to get rid of it, but it didn&#x27;t take off the residue completely.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought many eyelashes but I really like the way these flare at the ends.</li>
    <li> This are pretty good for the price, honestly. They arrived really fast. I had to trimmed the ends, but the look they give you is amazing, noticeable but not too exagerate. It is true that the &amp;#34;strip&amp;#34; where you apply the glue is kind of thick but I didn&#x27;t mind. I love how many of them you have.</li>
    <li> Really nice eyelashes i love them</li>
    <li> These are my favorite pair of lashes so far since purchasing lashes online. They are a nice thickness and add just the amount of drama I want for my eyes. Perfect for an everyday look.</li>
    <li> Great received mine !</li>

    <li> I loved how big my eyes looked and how full they made my eyelashes look too. Would definitely recommend and I plan on buying them again soon :3</li>
    <li> i love my lashes, it just took for ever to get them,</li>
    <li> bought for daughter, she likes these.</li>
    <li> they are good, but a bit too long,</li>
