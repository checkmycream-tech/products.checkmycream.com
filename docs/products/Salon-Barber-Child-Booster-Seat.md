    <li> The booster seat was a nice quality and fit into the barber chair perfectly.  It serves it purpose and we have had no complaints or problems.</li>
    <li> First of all the item on the picture is not what I received, mine is smaller and different shape too. The price is $19.95 but the S/H was  $42.64 SO I payed  $62.59 for something that don&#x27;t even look like what is been sold to me! I&#x27;m very upset and disappointed! I purchased something that was bigger in size heavier in weight, coast $57.95 and the S/H was $11.97. I would like to know how is that possible? If I would have known it before I purchase it I would&#x27;ve never buy it!</li>
    <li> I love the child booster seat that i got! It fits perfectly in my styling chair! The kids love it and it was EXACTLY what i was expecting, if not better!! Thank you so much!!</li>
    <li> Seat is just what I wanted, I clicked on buy now without reviewing shipping charges- which was rediculous.  It&#x27;s my fault, next time I will pay closer attention.</li>
    <li> I bought this for our salon and haven&#x27;t had any problems.  Works well with the little kids that come in and they seem to be comfortable.</li>
    <li> Looked great besides the slice in it. Other than that I would of gave it 5 stars</li>
    <li> This exactly what I expected..perfect for the job.does what u need it to do.worth the money.i wil recommend to any one.fast delivery too.</li>
    <li> Does the job and shipped super fast. Only complaint is it doesn&#x27;t sit flush with the back of the chair because it is straight.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, no problems! Great for working with the little fellas or when you need an extra lift at the shampoo bowl.</li>
    <li> I am a  female barber ,I have been cutting hair for over 25 yrs. I would definitely recommend ,it is a sturdy seat.</li>
    <li> Seems a little smaller than I was expecting but it will get the job done! Great price and seems like good quality. Haven&#x27;t used it yet but I&#x27;m not worried about it at all! Thanks!</li>
    <li> This booster seat is packed with a thick foam, so it has been very supportive of those sitting upon it.  No scratches or tears upon arrival.</li>
    <li> Was expected a bit biger but its still cool</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this booster seat a couple of years now and it is still holding up like new!  Works great at shampoo chair and stylist chair, I would recommend.</li>
    <li> Have not used yet, but looks good</li>
    <li> Works great for kids covers the entire barber chair seat. Soft yet firm enough the the kids don&#x27;t sink in too far. I feel a lot safer with children on these boosters than the ones that sit on top of the arms of the chair. I only gave 4 stars because I don&#x27;t care for the flap on them. The barbers and clients tend to pick them up by this flap and it tends to rip over time. It doesn&#x27;t really seem to serve much purpose.</li>
    <li> According to this photo, the flap hangs down almost to the foot rest.  The actual product&#x27;s flap is less then half that long. A good product if you&#x27;re not looking for the flap to extend more than a few inches.</li>
    <li> This is really small.  The seat isn&#x27;t accurate at all.  I don&#x27;t see how this looks like an adult sized salon chair and this tiny guy is nothing like advertised.</li>
    <li> My son loves having this booster to cover to cut children&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> Cheap quality but it was cheap so makes sense I guess</li>
    <li> I am not able to use the seat because it does not fit comfortably. It is still in the box and due to circumstances I waited too long to return it.</li>
    <li> works well with all kids 1 to 7 yrs of age in the salon for all styles on kids great product</li>
    <li> Fits great in any styling chair or shampoo bowl chair. It&#x27;s very supportive and sturdy.  I&#x27;m glad I purchased it.</li>
    <li> Wifey uses it as her job. Works goodl.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why I heard negative about this booster seat before I purchased it. I&#x27;m glad I was brave and bought it because I really like it!</li>
    <li> Works great, exactly what I was looking for. Lutes the price was the best I could find, even when the supply stores had them on sale!!  And it was here in no time</li>
