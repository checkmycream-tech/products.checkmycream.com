      <li>I wish is were better packaged.</li>
      <li>and i&#x27;ll be buying again whenever I need some more.</li>
      <li>There is also some static happening, the rhinestones and beads are sticking to the top of container but that will go away.&lt;br</li>
      <li>are so cute</li>
      <li>use these for craft projects more than nail art.  </li>
      <li>1 day I&#x27;d purchase it again but seeing as they give you sooooo many that won&#x27;t be for a while now</li>
      <li>LOVE THEM</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly, very tiny gems, but great variety, beautiful and alot of fun.</li>
      <li>Product arrived very well packaged with a huge assortment of BEAUTIFUL Nail Art in a variety of designs and colors.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>Im soooo loving and enjoying all these different wonderful items...sooo worth buying....</li>
      <li>very good , I just wish they came in different sizes.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall the shipping was great, super fast, the packaging is pretty good, could be a little better for the beads but no big deal, and the product itself is great, lots of rhinestones and beads and a great variety in colors, good variety in shapes.</li>
      <li>This shipped very quickly and was just as they had advertised it.</li>
      <li>Will buy more for sure price is right.</li>
      <li>The actual wheels themselves are great.</li>
      <li>Its very nice, although is smaller than you may think, but it is a nice item and u can use it very well.</li>
      <li>My daughter was so excited for this</li>
      <li>All the rhinestones stayed in the right places with no spillage into the envelope!</li>
      <li>Overall, this is a good deal for the price.</li>
      <li>It came in a quick fashion and everything was full to the brim.</li>
      <li>Other than that, great product for your money.</li>
      <li>My order arrived quick and nothing was damaged.  </li>
      <li>She is having so much fun with these.  </li>
      <li>Otherwise worth the money.</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t need 5 wheels that are the same and would love more silver</li>
      <li>They are just the right size.</li>
      <li>These were packaged well, i&#x27;m sure there was nothing more they could do to stop the spillage, since the were wrapped tightly and they still spilled out...</li>
      <li>These help the creations I do for every holiday have a little more sparkle and grad more attention, I think that they a glamour look to everything.</li>
      <li>I love them, just tap lightly if some of the rhinestones stick to the top and be careful when you turn to open them to get what you want for your nails.</li>
      <li>I was surprised at how quickly they got here, which is great because I&#x27;ve been impatiently waiting to do my nails with these.</li>
      <li>soo pretty and shinny  shapes &#x3D;  </li>
      <li>Had I known they were mostly going to be mini circles I would have just opted to buy individual reels from another seller to ensure variety.</li>
      <li>There are so many different shapes, sizes and colors!</li>
      <li>I wish there was more variety in the different types of rhinestones i was given.</li>
      <li>These are smaller than I imaged but that&#x27;s not too much of a set back, although a lot of the wheels are very similar, I thought there would be more size and shape variety, but regardless they should all work great.</li>
      <li>These Rhinestones are nice &amp; pretty much what I expected.  </li>
      <li>Nice and tight against the dividers, keeping everything in the right spots.</li>
      <li>collection of nail art is definately worth every penny paid, I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND this product for nail art lovers.</li>
      <li>Even though there were wheels with duplicates, I was OK with that as it will be a long time before I run out of stones.</li>
      <li>I will definitely order more and highly recommend this product.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I LOVE THESE RHINESTONES! Compared to Sally&#x27;s for what you get for so little and not worth you money, this is a great deal and worth every penny. I love them, just tap lightly if some of the rhinestones stick to the top and be careful when you turn to open them to get what you want for your nails. Other than that, great product for your money. Very please and shipped and received within 2 weeks...great delivery.</li>
    <li> Out of 10, 3 were the same, another 3 were also the same and the other 4. Containers are pretty bad, rhinestones got mixed up with each other and some even fell out of the container.</li>
    <li> Great value and quality. Love the variety of shapes(moon, stars, hearts, tear, diamond, etc) and colors! Easy to open and use.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with these when they arrived I got everything as pictured except I was supposed to get 2 wheels of the colored shapes and 1 only got 1 but I probably wouldn&#x27;t have used them much anyways.  Very happy.  1 day I&#x27;d purchase it again but seeing as they give you sooooo many that won&#x27;t be for a while now</li>
    <li> These came within 2 weeks or so. They where well packaged nothing loose or rhinestones not out of any packages etc.  these are so great. The colors are very clear and very bling bling.  Good quality. Will buy more for sure price is right.</li>
    <li> Good deal for the price.</li>
    <li> Whoa. Yes. This is what I was looking for. I like variety, I think it&#x27;s the spice of life. And although there are a couple wheels that are the same, there&#x27;s enough otherwise to keep it interesting, and I figure I won&#x27;t run out for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve bought a singular wheel of rhinestones from another seller and a different company a long time ago. Comparatively, these have 2x the number of rhinestones per wheel.  Which is nice. I don&#x27;t feel cheated at all. So happy!</li>
    <li> I thought this was an awesome deal for rhinestones as they are expensive to buy from my local beauty supply stores...usually one wheel is $10-$15 in my area...AND I remember way back when when I had acrylic nails, the nail salon that I visited charged $1 per nail when rhinestones were added...so this makes it an awesome deal!  Even though there were wheels with duplicates, I was OK with that as it will be a long time before I run out of stones. Lots of colours; lots of variety for me for what I do in my nail art!</li>
    <li> I expected the wheels and rhinestones to be bigger, but once I looked through the colors and designs I was very excited! Since the rhinestones are pretty small you could put more on a nail. I am very happy with this deal!!</li>
    <li> 4 multi color rhinestone packs. 3 multi color and 1 silver shape pack. 1 multi color bead pack. 1 silver rhinestone pack. Small and packed to wheels capasity for easy access.</li>
    <li> OH MY GOSH!!&lt;br /&gt;  This was just amazing the colors everything! And for the price they offered you cant go wrong with it!The colors were amazing they had some duplicates of the same reels but i didn&#x27;t mind. I would definitely recommend this, for someone who likes to bedazzle there nails  for these rhinestones are very small but very pretty!</li>
    <li> very good , I just wish they came in different sizes.</li>
    <li> My order for the Cheeky nail art decorations, was just perfect! The stones are vibrant with delicious colors, perfect for my glitzy art work.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for a great product, unavailable in my area, and for sure I will be reordering.  The delivery time was also quick, great service, great products!&lt;br /&gt;laura P.</li>
    <li> Very fast delivery!!! The rhinestones are amazing with a great shine to them.. Packaged very well although i expected the wheel to be bigger but i don&#x27;t regret buying this item!!</li>
    <li> These Rhinestones are nice &amp; pretty much what I expected.  Except the variety was very limited.&lt;br /&gt;Here is what you get:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10 Reels with 12 slots (each reel is approx. 3\\&quot; across - each slot approx 1\\&quot; deep).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You get 2 Reels that are Variety Packs:&lt;br /&gt;Each with 12 different colors in different shapes 11 in standard nail rhinestone size  1 in mini circles- 3 of the shapes are circles (two different sizes).  The standard size look to have approximately 30 to 50 rhinestones per slot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You get a 3rd Reel that is a \\&quot;Variety Pack\\&quot;: that is the same as above except all Silver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 4th Reel are not really rhinestones but Micro dots - about the size of a piece of glitter only spherical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other 6 Reels are All mini circles about 1/2 the size of the standard nail rhinestones (using pictures for description they are the smallest circles next to the dime) 5 of these reels are multicolored as in the last picture the other reel are all silver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So of the 122 slots you get 18 with standard size rhinestones in variety colors &amp; different shapes (other than circle).  You get 9 variety shapes (other than circle) in All Silver - So my guesstimate is about 1000 MAYBE 1200 of the 15000 are not circles. The rest are all circles (mainly minis) less the one pack of micro sphere&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use these for craft projects more than nail art.  I wasn&#x27;t disappointed in the product as a whole only the variety.  Had I known they were mostly going to be mini circles I would have just opted to buy individual reels from another seller to ensure variety.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;Very fast delivery (only 3 days and I didn&#x27;t pay extra for \\&quot;expedited\\&quot; service)! I am so happy about what I got too, there are 10 wheels with different rhinestones in the perfect size for nail art. I have been pricing these wheels at different stores in town and each wheel is $7 to $10!! All the rhinestones stayed in the right places with no spillage into the envelope!</li>
    <li> This is a great addition to anyone&#x27;s home nail salon.  The rhinestones looks really nice. They are just the right size.</li>
    <li> 1) It was very messy when it came in and all the rhinestones were falling all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;2) The rhinestones look dull when set with a top coat... Like not shiny at all....&lt;br /&gt;Not a good product.</li>
    <li> The size and quality of the stones is not so good.  It is not what you are used to when getting nail art at the salon!</li>
    <li> 10 Wheels Premium Manicure Nail Art Decorations...</li>
    <li> BUY ALL THE TIME. LOVE THEM</li>
    <li> The set comes with:&lt;br /&gt;- 3 pallets with different shapes. (2 color and one sliver.)&lt;br /&gt;- 6 circle pallets. (5 colors, same size and color, and 1 sliver)&lt;br /&gt;- 1 caviar bead pallet.</li>
    <li> I was surprised at how quickly they got here, which is great because I&#x27;ve been impatiently waiting to do my nails with these. They are pretty small, smaller than I expected, the beads are super tiny. They aren&#x27;t a bad size though, good for nail art.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rhinestones and beads come in a little disk with slots for each of the rhinestones. Each container fits in the palm of my hand, it is about the size of a chips ahoy, which I like because it&#x27;ll be easier to store. I received six wheels of round rhinestones, one in silver and the others in different colors. Three wheels in various shapes, one silver and the other two different colors. The last wheel contains the tiny caviar beads in various colors. It is a lot of rhinestones, I don&#x27;t see myself running out anytime soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It shipped in a plastic bag taped up. The only shipping problem I see is that while getting here the little caviar beads got spilled in and out of the container. Its just the colors closest to the opening though and it wont be an issue when using them. There is also some static happening, the rhinestones and beads are sticking to the top of container but that will go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall the shipping was great, super fast, the packaging is pretty good, could be a little better for the beads but no big deal, and the product itself is great, lots of rhinestones and beads and a great variety in colors, good variety in shapes. I recommend it and i&#x27;ll be buying again whenever I need some more.</li>
    <li> Ordered bigger gems, received small ones.</li>
    <li> Im soooo loving and enjoying all these different wonderful items...sooo worth buying....</li>
    <li> I love this! There are so many different shapes, sizes and colors! Will def buy again if I ever run out.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty hard to tell in the stock images, but you aren&#x27;t getting 10 different wheels. Three of the wheels were the same round gems in the same colors. Then the two wheels of colored shapes have the same color/shape combos. I.e. both had purble hearts, blue squares. Overall it&#x27;s not a huge deal, I can give the doubles to a friend that also does nail art.  The actual wheels themselves are great. Nice and tight against the dividers, keeping everything in the right spots. They came in a ziploc baggie, wrapped up very well, no sliding around getting broken!</li>
    <li> This is very nice nail art specially when you see them on your nail already</li>
    <li> Great deal one down side one wheel came a mixed up but was totally worth it.</li>
    <li> Good product!&lt;br /&gt;Deliver before the estimate date</li>
    <li> i got this product in less than a week ! amazing! great sparkles! loads of them too! love them and great for nail designs! will buy again!</li>
    <li> These are smaller than I imaged but that&#x27;s not too much of a set back, although a lot of the wheels are very similar, I thought there would be more size and shape variety, but regardless they should all work great.</li>
    <li> I wish there was more variety in the different types of rhinestones i was given. all in all it was still a lot of rhinestones and they were  nice colors.</li>
    <li> I am so happy with my order. It came in a quick fashion and everything was full to the brim. I love everything about this company and will order more from them again!! If i could have given more stars i would have!!! Perfect for nail art.</li>
    <li> Its very nice, although is smaller than you may think, but it is a nice item and u can use it very well. Thank you</li>
    <li> I ordered the product on sunday and it came tuesday ( I have prime membership).  Frankly, when i saw it i was shocked that they are so tiny. I can&#x27;t really complain too much because it says Nail Rhinestones. 6 out 10 packs I got circles with different colors.  On one container, it looks like micro and the rest are hearts, flowers, teardrops,triangles and squares.I know  why other customers might be upset with this product but personally, I was very satisfied and I didn&#x27;t really care about the shapes.  I will rate the following features  colors &#x3D;  5 stars..soo pretty and shinny  shapes &#x3D;  4 stars.. maybe  give 5 containers with rounds/circles and 5 containers other shapes.  container &#x3D; 5 stars. I like it how you can slide the lid around to avoid the spill.  quality &#x3D; 4 stars for now I haven&#x27;t used it yet.   prize &#x3D; 5 stars. come one for 10 packs for that price. What else can you say. I have purchased other rhinestones from different website and it was expensive for only 300 pcs for $ 5.99.  I will be using it for my cellphone or anything. I will update my post and maybe even post my review on my personal blog.</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed with the packaging of the 10 wheels because when I received the wheels that were stacked one on top of the other the bottom one had not been closed properly and all the gems from the bottom wheel had spilled all out into the packaging. I haven&#x27;t even opened the clear taped baggy because I know once I do the crystals are gonna go everywhere.</li>
    <li> These help the creations I do for every holiday have a little more sparkle and grad more attention, I think that they a glamour look to everything.</li>
    <li> I love these gems, and the price is right, but I lost a few of the gems because they spilled out during shipment. These were packaged well, i&#x27;m sure there was nothing more they could do to stop the spillage, since the were wrapped tightly and they still spilled out...</li>
    <li> The containers are quite small and to be very tiny gems.  The colors do not stay separated at all... but the selection is nice.  I wish is were better packaged.</li>
    <li> My daughter was so excited for this, she does her own gel nails, she has the lamp and loves to change them and add the designs to one finger,  She is having so much fun with these.  You get an amazing selection of colors and styles and many to choose from.  Great deal for price... Best I have seen</li>
    <li> These are a great addition to my nail art collection.  I can not wait to use these with some of my designs. Excellent price and fast delivery. Would recommend to everyone.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly, very tiny gems, but great variety, beautiful and alot of fun.</li>
    <li> I ordered the crystals and what I received was beyond my expectations. There were ten containers filled with different colors and shapes and there was no mix ups! I will definitely order more and highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> These are totally awesome!!! The packaging was better than I expected after reading the reviews...A couple of the smallest beads had shifted out of place but packaging was done with great care! Also, quality of this product is really wonderful for what I use them for. Scrapping booking has become very expensive for me especially little jewels and gems and these are vibrant and just the right size. I am tickled to death. My husband just said I have lost my wife for a little while...lol</li>
    <li> This shipped very quickly and was just as they had advertised it. there are alot of  colors and stones to choose from so it makes a great gift for anyone who likes to do their own nails. I would not only buy from this seller again bu would recommend them</li>
    <li> Came in the mail and the disk that has all the &amp;#34;caviar&amp;#34; style &amp;#34;rhinestones&amp;#34; more like beads were spilled all over the envelope they were shipped in and made a mess... and the clear plastic part that covers it and makes it slide so you can access the color you like is hard to twist sometimes.</li>
    <li> Product arrived very well packaged with a huge assortment of BEAUTIFUL Nail Art in a variety of designs and colors.&lt;br /&gt;This collection of nail art is definately worth every penny paid, I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND this product for nail art lovers.</li>
    <li> good for the price I also love nail jewelry  on my nails</li>
    <li> I love these .. I love looking good and my nails is one thing I like doing these are so cute just the right size not too much and love perfect for the girl that likes to look her best!</li>
    <li> Out of 10 wheels 5 are repeated.</li>
    <li> This pack is a good deal for the price. Of the 10 wheels you are really only getting 4 varieties (not including colors). But the rhinestones are very nice and come in a lot of colors. My order arrived quick and nothing was damaged.  No loose rhinestones either. Overall, this is a good deal for the price. If I ever run out of rhinestones, I would order again.</li>
    <li> Very perfect! Came in 2 weeks, 5 are the same with mixed colors with all circle gems, 2 are silver (1 all circles the other mixed shapes) 2 are the same colors as before but with mixed shapes and then 1 multiple colored caviar pieces...I really don&#x27;t need 5 wheels that are the same and would love more silver but these are great!</li>
    <li> The jewels are nice, small, and shiny. The wheels do tend to spread the gems everywhere though.  Work over a dinner plate to contain them. Otherwise worth the money. Will buy again when I run out.</li>
    <li> The only reason I put a 4 is because when I saw the picture I thought the containers would be much bigger. But when I got them they were small but I like the quality overall and they work great for nails! Will buy again!&lt;br /&gt;Also I got them before the estimated date.</li>
