      <li>REGRET PURCHASING THIS MODEL !!!!! :-)</li>
      <li>but i love not being tied to the wall with a cord.</li>
      <li>then most clippers</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s why 3 stars,but if not the heat issue it would get 5 stars for sure.</li>
      <li>Its better than the 76 because its more quite</li>
      <li>There is a button on top of the switch.  </li>
      <li>In terms of quality, I got more than what I paid for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase.  </li>
      <li>The motor appears to be very powerful, and most important, they cut evenly and smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;Could not be happier with our purchase!</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t matter because I ordered a separate blade for my ideal cut, but others might be affected if they expect a specific blade with the clipper kit.</li>
      <li>he said that it is fast and really good.</li>
      <li>I was impressed with this compared to my other ConAir, Wahl and Oster products.</li>
      <li>The blades are easy to change (pop-off) vs. the unscrew method.  </li>
      <li>I AM SUPER PLEASED AND LOOK FORWARD TO MY WEEKLY BUZZ(FAST &amp; EASY).</li>
      <li>They are comparable to the Oster 76&#x27;s in terms of cut capacity and power but with variable speed for close or fine work.</li>
      <li>The blades are securely fit and easily pop in and out in two seconds.</li>
      <li>smooth clipper, strong and reliable.</li>
      <li>The variable speeds really come in handy with the dogs.  </li>
      <li>Extreamly maneuverable and light weight compared to my Oster 76 and my Masters.</li>
      <li>The clippers run quietly and do a great job of clipping.</li>
      <li>, I&#x27;d rather jack it up myself for free</li>
      <li>Being cordless would have been a great advantage, maybe they will improve the batteries only time will tell.</li>
      <li>These clippers are spot on, and all of my oster blades fit the</li>
      <li>The device itself is very sturdy and the rotating cable is a nice touch too.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s going to extend the life of this powerful motor.    </li>
      <li>I ALSO OWN THE OSTER FAST FEED AND</li>
      <li>through all hair types smoothly and in one swath.  </li>
      <li>Loved my Oster 76, but it was way too loud.  </li>
      <li>I was able to whip right through a cut and it was smooth as could be.    </li>
      <li>Love this unit, strong, powerful, variable speed, light weight, AMD large accessory selection availability including using Oster blades.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve already purchased and used the CeramicEdge (that uses an actual ceramic blade) - luke-warm to the touch and feels nice, and UltraEdge (Stainless Steel blade) - warm to the touch</li>
      <li>The guards it comes with are very short though, the longest one being 1/4&amp;#34; so its a good idea to order some longer ones along with this.</li>
      <li>I love the variable speeds as I work on so many different hair textures and densities.  </li>
      <li>this was pricey with the extra blades but it really really does a nice and very accurate job.  </li>
      <li>Although neither one really knew much about the product; it didn&#x27;t matter because after getting all the info I needed directly from Andis&#x27; customer service staff, I realized this was the best unit that was out there for a professional clipper, so I decided to purchase this model from Discounts Jungle.</li>
      <li>Love the variable speed, which is very beneficial for the 000 and 00000 blades which can get very hot on higher speeds.</li>
      <li>Very quiet while running compared to cheap models and most full size clippers I have heard in barber shops.</li>
      <li>However, I could easily continue clipping even with the hot blade since it was not uncomfortable.  </li>
      <li>glad i bought them.everything about these say professional barber...</li>
      <li>Best hair clippers I have ever owned, bought them because I was tired of paying people to jack up my hair</li>
      <li>It operates smoothly, quietly, and effectively.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s like using a paint brush; just feels right.</li>
      <li>IT is mush better then the &amp;#34;Wahler&amp;#34; one i had, the only concern I have is that it gets hot after I cut one of the boys hair, then i have to let it sit for a wile to cool off, so I don&#x27;t burn my kids ears or something.  </li>
      <li>Very smooth, quiet, and powerful.  </li>
      <li>The motor is powerful and quiet, and I love how it cuts.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Can&#x27;t wait to use this clipper at work. Just waiting on the attachment combs since I wasn&#x27;t sure if they were included in the box. It comes with clipper oil and a 1 blade. So if you want more blades or the comb attachments make sure to order them as well.</li>
    <li> As a new buyer of professional clippers I wanted to know who was better in terms of quality, performance and price. At least that&#x27;s what we evaluate when we decide to represent other companies products that we resell. Well, the \\&quot;race\\&quot; was on between Oster and Andis and from a few beauty and barbering supply places the main feedback was ANDIS ALL THE WAY!!! Well, after reading a few reviews on different varieties of their models I called up Andis to speak with their customer service dept. and was told the Andis BGRv (Model #63100) was their newest model. Also, the main reason why I wanted this model was because of the reviews (of their their similar models) and price. So I decided to call a local distributor where I live in Houston, TX and asked if they could at least match the price (I was even willing to pay the tax - since they were local). But this was my reply: \\&quot;I am not Walmart and don&#x27;t match prices. Your welcome for my time...\\&quot; I guess you can see where that conversion went; especially since he was charging $175.00 PLUS $14.44 for Tax. Uhhhh, no... He didn&#x27;t even spell \\&quot;your\\&quot; correctly, (really it should be spelled - \\&quot;you&#x27;re\\&quot;). But that&#x27;s not the point. My main issue was lack of customer service as well as price and I didn&#x27;t receive either one from that person. No worries, with that kind of mindset he&#x27;ll be out of business soon, especially since businesses are tanking anyway and more (unfortunately) are coming this year...    I decided to contact one of the guys here on Amazon.com and I was expecting the same service. Man, was I WRONG!!! I contacted a couple of resellers and received calls back rather quickly by two different resellers here on Amazon. Although neither one really knew much about the product; it didn&#x27;t matter because after getting all the info I needed directly from Andis&#x27; customer service staff, I realized this was the best unit that was out there for a professional clipper, so I decided to purchase this model from Discounts Jungle. I orderedit for $103.95 + $10.96 for shipping and received it in two days (WOW - that was FAST !!!).     Here&#x27;s why I chose this clipper:    1)  The Motor. The rotary motor is extremely quiet (and I do mean quiet) and has variable speed control (5 speed modes). I usually keep it on the lowest level and it works just fine. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s going to extend the life of this powerful motor.    2)  The Blades. The variety of blades that can be used on this model are more than any novice or professional could ever ask for, since they sell almost every length of blade you can imagine and can also use other blades from other companies (like Oster 76 model). I&#x27;ve already purchased and used the CeramicEdge (that uses an actual ceramic blade) - luke-warm to the touch and feels nice, and UltraEdge (Stainless Steel blade) - warm to the touch and I can say first hand that both are fine (even cutting hair on children). Not HOT like what found in my prior model that I used before this one (the Remington 22 piece Titanium Coated Haircut Kit Item # HC921 $20.00) that I used for over 7 years straight, before the cord went out on me twice; the first time it went just right after 5 years of owning it and brought it to someone that fixed it for $10.00. Then it lasted another 2 years before I got tired of wiggling the cord, since it continued to flicker on and off while using it right in the middle of cutting my hair - OUCH !!! :-S That&#x27;s what you get for trying to save money.    3)  The Cord Saver 360 tangle-free swivel. One of the MAIN reason why I bought this unit. When Andis claims that the cord increases mobility and reduces hand strain and cord wear, well you just have to use it ONCE to know what that means - it&#x27;s AMAZING !!! You can also purchase the separate recharging unit (with the battery) that can be attached to clipper in place of the cord and then use it as a stand alone clipper, if the cord gets in your way. So far I&#x27;m fine with the cord attached as it doesn&#x27;t tangle. Also, the clipperfits in your hand nicely no matter how you position it. It&#x27;s like using a paint brush; just feels right. I just hope it lasts for years. At least that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m planning for...    4)  Lastly, PRICE. I continue to realize that you ALWAYS GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR and in this situation it&#x27;s the same. If you buy a Remington (like) clipper, you may have it for years, but you will NOT know the difference in the quality of your haircut and coolness of the blade contacting your skin until you use the Andis BGRv (Model #63100). Worth every penny, especially since I haven&#x27;t gone to a barber in years and don&#x27;t want someone else experimenting with my hair for $18.00 - $20.00+ every every month. This is will pay for itself in no time. Also, (to me) it&#x27;s therapeutic when you can take the time to do it yourself...    With all that said - YOU WON&#x27;T REGRET PURCHASING THIS MODEL !!!!! :-)</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical about the price on this but took a chance.  I was pleasantly surprised at the quality.  I have typically purchased the Walmart/Kmart kits in the past and have gone through at least 4 of these.  The blade that comes with this product is a little long for my liking so I bought the Andis Ceramic Edge blade # 00000 [ 64730 ] to go along with it.  The blades are easy to change (pop-off) vs. the unscrew method.  I was able to whip right through a cut and it was smooth as could be.    I don&#x27;t take long to cut my hair but the blade can get a little warm.  As long as you follow the instructions and keep it oiled as you go there shouldn&#x27;t be a problem.    The device itself is very sturdy and the rotating cable is a nice touch too.  At some point I may purchase the battery pack to go with it but buying both just seems to pricey for me at this time.    I was impressed with this compared to my other ConAir, Wahl and Oster products.</li>
    <li> Perfect clippers for haircuts! Light weight and very quiet!</li>
    <li> I got The Andis ceramic Bgrv variable speed clipper. this is the only clipper that can compete with the oster 76. Its better than the 76 because its more quite and it has variable speed for all hair density</li>
    <li> There is a button on top of the switch.  I have to hold the botton to use the switch.  :(</li>
    <li> I bought this for my sister, she is a hairdresser. She loves it and can&#x27;t stop talking about how much she loves it</li>
    <li> I bought this product to cut my son hair (4 years) old and it is working well.  1. its quiet  2. light vibration, hardly feel it.  3. get the outliner detachable blade</li>
    <li> This clipper cuts evenly without any snagging of the hair or leaving any patches. It also remembers the last speed setting u used after switching the the clipper off then back on again. The swivel cord is helpful because the cord never gets in the way while cutting. I also like the fact that the power supply it comes with is dual voltage for worldwide usage.  This is convenient while I&#x27;m overseas and I don&#x27;t have to use a clipper just for 220 voltage. Good buy and the clipper fits the hand like a glove.</li>
    <li> The clippers run quietly and do a great job of clipping.</li>
    <li> I have been cutting my husband&#x27;s hair for over 15 years.  In that time, we have owned the typical WalMart purchased Wahl Clippers.&lt;br /&gt;These are disposable, and were inferior even while still working.  In fact, the last pair I bought, actually did not even last one entire haircut!&lt;br /&gt;So we found these and ordered them.  They are awesome.  The motor appears to be very powerful, and most important, they cut evenly and smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;Could not be happier with our purchase!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a professional stylist, and I only use these clippers every 4-5 days, but these are great, professional-quality clippers.  I could tell the difference in quality immediately (compared to much lower-cost clippers).  The motor is powerful and quiet, and I love how it cuts.  The swivel cord makes moving the clippers around much easier than a fixed cord.  Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase.  In terms of quality, I got more than what I paid for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These came with a #1 blade, while I actually expected a #0 blade.  It didn&#x27;t matter because I ordered a separate blade for my ideal cut, but others might be affected if they expect a specific blade with the clipper kit.</li>
    <li> smooth clipper, strong and reliable. makes cutting hair that much easier.little 2 no noise small but powerful..glad i bought them.everything about these say professional barber...treat yourself to the cadilac of clippers..master barber 12yrs.. DEAZY</li>
    <li> I am a dog groomer by profession and this has got to be one of the best clippers i have ever bought for my business.</li>
    <li> Overall experience is positive. Good craftsmanship, looks reliable. A little bit annoying vibration but pretty quiet, works well even on a second speed, so maybe vibration is not a big deal. I use it on my ones hairs, big improvement compare to non blade changeable trimmers. Only one thing I have to complain its comb set. Looks like that comb is to small for such type of blades. This is strange because comb set is the only one that recommended by Andis.</li>
    <li> I am a professional cosmetologist.  The percentage of male clients vs. female clients is 70/30, so my clippers are running the majority of any given day.  I love the variable speeds as I work on so many different hair textures and densities.  These clippers are spot on, and all of my oster blades fit the And is bgrv, so I didn&#x27;t have to make an additional investment.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> I bought this clipper to use at home for three of my boys and maybe husband (a little later when I get better at it practicing on kids;)lol  The first one came broken so i sent it back and they shipped me a new one. At firs I was very exited to use it. IT is mush better then the &amp;#34;Wahler&amp;#34; one i had, the only concern I have is that it gets hot after I cut one of the boys hair, then i have to let it sit for a wile to cool off, so I don&#x27;t burn my kids ears or something.  That&#x27;s why 3 stars,but if not the heat issue it would get 5 stars for sure.</li>
    <li> Love this unit, strong, powerful, variable speed, light weight, AMD large accessory selection availability including using Oster blades. Having an older Oster that never failed,  I considered the Oster 76 and model 10, but very tickled with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Love it.................perfect as I groom for a living!</li>
    <li> This clipper is fabulous due to the lightness and rotating cord</li>
    <li> I used the clippers twice and the insulation protecting the wire split in two, just at the base of the clippers, where it rotates.  Another con about the clipper, I didn&#x27;t like the power button it was hard to turn on/off, this is a little slide button hard for my fat fingers.  I did however like the overall feel of the clipper in my hand, lightweight, small, and it seemed to cut pretty smooth.  However, had to send it back, due to the wire splitting after two uses.</li>
    <li> this clipper doesn&#x27;t live up to it name, it dnt compare to the 76er in power,quality &amp; performance, Im always hearing you dnt hv to do maintenance on the andis, but it only takes 5 minutes to do the maintenance on the 76er and it worth that long 5 minutes to get the performance it puts out, cuts through any type of hair effortless. The andis detachable clippers are mediocre in my opinion bc it want cut through thick hair easily and fast which the clipper was design for quick and accurate cutting. I&#x60;ll stay ole school and stay with what works best.</li>
    <li> Seriously these work good but there are better ones out there in the same price range. They are comparable to the Oster 76&#x27;s in terms of cut capacity and power but with variable speed for close or fine work. But for go to all around clippers I personally feel the chrome Whal Sr. anniversary edition or the Andis Masters are a better tool. From what I&#x27;ve read and heard about the batteries for this they suck so I only use the cord. Being cordless would have been a great advantage, maybe they will improve the batteries only time will tell.</li>
    <li> For a $100+ dollars, I&#x27;m supposed to perfect the art of the trick to getting the blade back on while the motor is running without cutting up my hand?  The diagram in the booklet is horrible.</li>
    <li> Best hair clippers I have ever owned, bought them because I was tired of paying people to jack up my hair, I&#x27;d rather jack it up myself for free then pay somebody for it, haven&#x27;t had one problem with the Andis clippers</li>
    <li> Bought this product for a friend in the hair business. He is very happy with his Andis.</li>
    <li> I will never go back to $20 clippers! The brg line is just perfect for home use. The five speeds seems a little over done. I don&#x27;t do detail work so never use lower speeds. Very quiet while running compared to cheap models and most full size clippers I have heard in barber shops. You have the option to go wireless if you want but I don&#x27;t need to. The cord is fairly long and the power transformer is at the plug. It use to take me 10-15 minutes to cut my own hair,  now it takes less than 10 to cut hair and trim beard and neck.</li>
    <li> I used to shave my head bald with a razor, which is the closest shave you can get.  However, due to religious reasons, I am no longer able to shave my head.  So I wanted clippers that would cut my hair down to the closest cut possible without being a shave.  I used to use Oster Professional Clippers that I used to use on my poodles.  I was constantly nicking myself, and blood was always on my pillow.  The clippers were heavy and loud, and my arm would tire just using them.  My wife constantly bugged me about purchasing \\&quot;human\\&quot; clippers, so I finally relented and purchased this clipper.  Boy, what a difference.  It is small, light and quiet.  It gives a great, even cut without any nicks.  I cut my hair weekly.  Since I wanted a cut as close to a shave as possible without being a shave, I experimented with different blades.  The unit comes with a #1 stainless steel blade, which would cut down to about 6 mm.  This was about the length my hair grows after a week after shaving it bald.  So I purchased ceramic 0A, 000, and 00000 blades.  I did not find any difference between the stainless steel blade and the ceramic blades.  The 0A cut my hair down to about 3 mm, the 000 down to about 1 mm, and the 00000 down to about 1/2 mm, which is probably the closest cut you can get with clippers before going to a razor blade.  I will use all the blades, except probably the #1, depending on my mood at the time.  The only downsides of the clippers are the cost, although they are worth every penny, ,the blades, which get a little hot after continual use.  However, I could easily continue clipping even with the hot blade since it was not uncomfortable.  The only other downside is the cord, which only gets in the way a little, about as much as any cord would.  The positives far outweigh the negatives.  I can see using these clippers for years, and possibly getting the rechargeable battery kit.  Anyone want to buy Oster Professional clippers for their dogs?</li>
    <li> Received these clippers and can&#x27;t be more impressed with the results. Extreamly maneuverable and light weight compared to my Oster 76 and my Masters. I run it on level 3 and its perfect for textured curly hair. Blade will get hot on level 5 with prolong usage on that speed, but its not as bad as some will say.  Overall I really enjoy using these clippers.</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT THIS CLIPPER FOR HOME USE AND I BOUGHT IT BASED ON THE REVIEWS AND IT HAS VARIABLE SPEEDS. I FOUND THE CLIPPER TO BE SOLIDLY BUILT AND COMPACT. I BUZZED CUT MY HAIR WITH THE INCLUDED #1 BLADE WITH A #2 COMB ATTACHMENT(NOT INCLUDED) AND IT DID A VERY NICE JOB. I STARTED OFF USING THE #3 SPEED AND THEN USING THE #5 SPEED TO GO OVER WHAT I ALREADY HAD CUT. I THOUGHT THE HIGHER SPEED MIGHT GET HAIRS THAT THE LOWER SPEED MIGHT HAVE MISSED. WHETHER IT DID OR NOT, I ENDED-UP WITH A VERY GOOD HAIRCUT. THE CLIPPER WORKED FLAWLESSLY.&lt;br /&gt;I GAVE THE CLIPPER 4 STARS AND NOT 5 STARS, BECAUSE THE BLADE GETS VERY WARM ON SPEED #5 AND I DO NOT THINK THIS IS A GOOD THING. I ALSO OWN THE OSTER FAST FEED AND THE OSTER CLASSIC 76 AND THEY DO NOT RUN HOT AND ARE EXCELLENT CLIPPERS. I ADDED ANDIS TO MY CLIPPER COLLECTION, BECAUSE OF IT&#x27;S COMPACTNESS AND IT&#x27;S 5 SPEEDS, WHICH GIVES YOU OPTIONS WHEN CUTTING.&lt;br /&gt;*UPDATE: I RAISED MY RATING FROM 4 STARS TO 5 STARS. I HAVE BEEN USING THIS CLIPPER FOR 9 MONTHS AND I WILL NOT EVEN LOOK AT MY OSTER FAST FEED AND OSTER CLASSIC 76. IT IS HANDS DOWN MY GO TO CLIPPER. IT DOES A GREAT JOB AND A VERY COMFORTABLE CLIPPER TO USE. THE BLADE GETTING WARM HAS NOT BEEN AN ISSUE. I FIND USING THIS CLIPPER WITH AN ANDIS #3 1/2 BLADE GAVE ME A FINER CUT THAN THE OSTER 76 WITH AN OSTER #3 1/2 BLADE. THERE WAS A NOTICEABLE DIFFERENCE. I AM SUPER PLEASED AND LOOK FORWARD TO MY WEEKLY BUZZ(FAST &amp; EASY).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that the majority of reviews are coming from home users which is great but I wanted to let the professionals out there know that I highly recommend this clipper for Professional use as well.  Everyone had described it beautifully so I won&#x27;t add anything except to say that you will need to turn it off between blade changes or it WILL bite you, lol.&lt;br /&gt;You need to press your thumb down pretty hard to push it back as it is a pretty tight fit but other than that it&#x27;s fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;I have the one speed.  I thought I was buying the 5 speed, I didn&#x27;t realize there were two different ones.  It&#x27;s sufficient although I may buy the battery charger because it still tangles!  grr.  :)&lt;br /&gt;That was the main selling point for me, a tangle-less clipper. (swivel)  Battery pack will fix that.&lt;br /&gt;Cuts through all hair types smoothly and in one swath.  Very rarely do I have to make a second swath.  And QUIET.  I can carry on a conversation no problem with my customers.&lt;br /&gt;Great clipper.  Buy it.  Shop around though for a deal.</li>
    <li> I had bought these Clippers a year ago and wow have things changed since then. This manufacturer is making the Bgrv look bad and cheap. I had to go ship them back because I thought it was a joke. They were loud and the metal hinge wasn&#x27;t even metal it was plastic. The picture that&#x27;s being posted doesn&#x27;t look like what they sent me.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> It shave my husband exceptional well. He loved it he said that it is fast and really good. Good brand shear  i would recommend it to any one</li>
    <li> Loved my Oster 76, but it was way too loud.  The Andis is a Great clipper.  Very smooth, quiet, and powerful.  Love the variable speed, which is very beneficial for the 000 and 00000 blades which can get very hot on higher speeds.</li>
    <li> Bought for boyfriend for xmas after many hours of research. They were rated one of the top clippers and had great feedback.&lt;br /&gt;He has only used them a few times but says they cut great and feel of very high quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blade it came with (1) is not quite short enough for my boyfriend as I think the gradings are of slightly different size in UK and America. Need to get a 00 blade now so more expense. Top product but really should have come with at least one other blade.</li>
    <li> This is really a great clipper. I have used it now on my family giving a total of 6 haircuts and couldn&#x27;t be happier with it. The guards it comes with are very short though, the longest one being 1/4&amp;#34; so its a good idea to order some longer ones along with this. The power is more than enough for our thick hair and is very very quiet. I definitely recommend</li>
    <li> Value for the money. The clipper meets and exceed my expectation. With Andis 00000 blade, it provides skin-tight hair cut.</li>
    <li> they are heavy then most clippers but i love not being tied to the wall with a cord. I will never give up the blades so it  takes the cake that they use the blades. i work it a very busy store so i have 2 battery and they change in and out very easily. MAKE SURE YOU DONT USE OIL CLEANER  with this clipper when cleaning your blades they will BRAKE by over heating and burn you hands to the touch</li>
    <li> As a professional, licensed cosmetologist with heavy barber experience, I feel that I can weigh this rating pretty evenly. The bgrv is everything you&#x27;d expect from a top of the line Andis clipper. It operates smoothly, quietly, and effectively. As a basis, I have compared it to the Oster Classic 76 and here are my results:&lt;br /&gt;Andis bgrV: Pros: Quieter, lighter, slightly more convenient design, 360 degree swivel cord is a plus, requires less mechanical maintenance (no carbon brush replacement, grease for clipper motor, oil for bearing etc.), ever so slightly less expensive, ability to go cordless (with separate battery pack). Cons: Overall weaker power, more fragile, still had difficulties when it came to cutting thick, long, ethnic hair on max speed setting (albeit slight), on max setting can easily overheat, overall product felt cheaper than the Classic 76, adapter plug is big.&lt;br /&gt;Overall great product when used occasionally, but again, will not easily stand up to all hair cuts and will always be a notch lower than the Classic 76. Hope this helped.</li>
    <li> After going through a few pathetic sub-$40 clippers that cut well only for a month or two, we got these PFO clippers and these are great on our three toy poodles.  This is much quieter than the cheap clippers (which buzz loudly because they don&#x27;t have an actual motor like these pro clippers have), so the dogs are more compliant getting haircuts. The variable speeds are wonderful, and it feels well made. The blades are securely fit and easily pop in and out in two seconds. Way better than those cheap clippers that require a screwdriver and a few minutes to  re-align.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The #10 blade does it all, even paws. We did buy the additional 5/8\\&quot; blade for paws but returned it because it was was dull and useless. I would actually go the opposite way, and buy a finer blade to finish off the facial areas and paws after going over it with the coarser #10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came with blade oil. I also purchased the cool blade spray to use while cutting for a quick clean &amp; cooling off. Not that the blades get super hot, but it helps when doing the face as dogs don&#x27;t prefer hot metal near their eyes and snout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One tip - wash and blowdry your dog before clipping. Clippers always cut better this way and they stay cleaner and sharper as dirt and debris/mud would dull the blade.</li>
    <li> Some of the best on the market .</li>
    <li> Excellent clippers. I like the option to go cordless if you want to. Upgraded to these and use my 76&#x27;s as my backups now. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> 5 speed BGRV is absolutely quite and smooth fast cutting (even my 14 m.o. son seats calmly).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Andis clippers are great but their customer support service and official dealers are LAZY, UNPROFESSIONAL AND USELESS. It looks like Oster or Wahl sent to Andis support team their spies to destroy the company. When I tried to find a simple information regarding BGRV&#x27;s compatible comb set and voltage range they responded completely wrong (after TWO WEEKS of silence and my three annoying requests):&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Andis Universal Comb set# 12995 does not fit BGRV\\&quot; and  \\&quot;all US BGRV models sold in US are 120V, 60Hz\\&quot; . Fortunately, I am too stubborn and always double/triple check the information from different sources. And Amazon&#x27;s customer service agent immediately provided me correct info: \\&quot;universal worldwide voltage 100-240V, 50-60Hz\\&quot;. I bought the BGRV in retail store in Texas and it also has 100-240V, 50-60Hz. Sent a couple weeks ago the picture of the BGRV&#x27;s power supply with printed voltage range to Andis. They still keep silence. ;)</li>
    <li> I am a licensed cosmotolgist and purchased this clipper about one year ago. The other day at work it died on me out of the blue. I take good care of my tools and I must say, I thought this was a better buzzer. When I emailed amazon I was told I had to go through the seller, not amazon. At this point I would just like a refund so I can purchase the osters 76 classic</li>
    <li> Bought as part of a hair cutting outfit. All items purchased worked together to provided good haircuts saving money over time.</li>
    <li> PROFESSIONAL GRADE - this is NOT a $20 disposable product... I was thoroughly finished with &#x27;disposable&#x27; clippers... the Andis BG series clippers have super sturdy motors and features that you would only find in a quality product... the variable speed motor is great and cutting on slow speed works well, reducing noise, overheating and wear on the unit... the swivel power cord is a nice feature... the blades are durable and readily interchangeable... $20 clippers do not have this feature and if they wear or fail the entire clipper needs to be replaced... the BGRv clipper is a little more expensive, but you get what you pay for... overall an A+ product...</li>
    <li> BGRV is well built and  nicely executed.  uses the standard Oster type blades if you dont like the Andis blades.  speed control is nice.  Couple of things that are not apparent from Andis that you should know&lt;br /&gt;1- the wall wort power supply for this model is a multi-voltage type.  it will do 100v thru 240v 50/60hz.  this is notmentioned in ANY of andis&#x27; literature NOR will they tell you this if you call them.  I had to call a compnay that actually pulled one off the shelf and opened the box to look to verify this.&lt;br /&gt;2- the BGRC model had a different power supply that DOES NOT do the 100-240.  it is 120 ONLY.  this is also the spare power supply you can buy from andis&lt;br /&gt;3- if you want this trimmer for your beard then a #2 blade will get a nice trim look but still give some body to lite haired folk.  for a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow the 1A might be better&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this because I got tired of junk beard trimmers with batteries that eventually went bad and caused failure.  this was pricey with the extra blades but it really really does a nice and very accurate job.  It can be a bit of extra effort and care if you are doing fine detail work tho as the blades are about 1.5&amp;#34; wide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside to this is that Andis seems like they dont know much about their products and dont care to help you with them.  I have little confidence that they would be of much help in a warranty or repair situation.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a barber for 35 years. This is the best motor I&#x27;ve ever had. The 5 speeds are enough different from each other (for thick vs. thin hair), to be useful, unlike the 2 speed. The swivel cord is the first I&#x27;ve seen on any clipper and is a great feature. Unfortunately there&#x27;s no 5 speed battery version, although is is the very same motor as the rechargeable, and is interchangeable with those battery/ charger units. I&#x27;ve had no consistency issues such as it developing rattles or anything. It&#x27;s light and quiet especially compared to the whine of the Oster 76. I&#x27;ve used the battery version for years, and it is also an excellent performer. For me, I&#x27;ll put up with a cord for the 5 speeds and swivel.</li>
    <li> Works great on any type of hair..a must buy</li>
    <li> I bought these for myself a couple years ago as a birthday present.  I use them one a week to cut my hair, and once a month to cut my dogs hair.  The variable speeds really come in handy with the dogs.  These clippers are great!  Spend the extra bucks and get the ceramics blades.  The standard metal blades heat up pretty quickly under normal use.  On my bald head, that doesn&#x27;t feel so great.  The ceramic blades never get hot.</li>
    <li> Been using this now for a couple years.  Never going back to the box store clippers of the past (you know the brands).  This one has never once &amp;#34;bitten&amp;#34; my hair.  It just cuts nice and smooth with no bogging down (I have very thick hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update May 2016.  Faster than they should have, these clippers have developed a problem.  The motor is now surging, and sometimes cuts out.  I am extremely disappointed that a commercial grade clipper should do this, when we only use to cut my hair once every 3 weeks.  Out of warranty.  I am keeping 2* instead of 1* because they worked fabulously while they worked, and I&#x27;m hoping I just have a bad unit and others have better luck.</li>
