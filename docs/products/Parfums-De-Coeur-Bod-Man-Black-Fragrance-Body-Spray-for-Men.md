      <li>SMELLS GREAT.</li>
      <li>I knew this product would be great</li>
      <li>I have never gotten so many wonderful remarks about what I am wearing.  </li>
      <li>I will say that these colognes are infinitely superior to any \\&quot;Axe\\&quot; product, which will burn people&#x27;s noses from a great distance.  </li>
      <li>Why spend $30+ when you can spend $10 to smell good?</li>
      <li>Two sprays and your good.</li>
      <li>Hey guys this stuff is good.</li>
      <li>A couple sprays and your good all day.  </li>
      <li>I always get lots of compliments on how good I smell.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not as good as it said to be it should be cheaper then</li>
      <li>These ARE after shower products, not a substitute for good hygiene.</li>
      <li>It sure smells good.</li>
      <li>Smells Good - The Women Love It</li>
      <li>It winds up that I am not fond of the musty note of this OR Armani code, but for those that are, this is a cheap and fairly good alternative.  </li>
      <li>Really though, great cologne.</li>
      <li>MY MOM PUT ON MORE ON HIM AND THE NUZZLES AND KISSES CONTINUED.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok</li>
      <li>I can not belive how many people ask we what I am wearing.</li>
      <li>Better than axe body sprays.  </li>
      <li>Not my favorite Bodman but</li>
      <li>Great fragrance, but really, whats with the bottle?</li>
      <li>but I like some of the others better...</li>
      <li>Boy, this man-musk-spray was surprisingly fan-blooming-tastic, the smell of success.</li>
      <li>still okay.</li>
      <li>I have tried all of the Bod Body Sprays -- this is my favorite.  </li>
      <li>I have enjoyed this when I found it in a store some time ago</li>
      <li>A pretty good scent from BOD which resembles a lot like Giorgio Armani&#x27;s \\&quot;Armani</li>
      <li>BOD product fragrances are not just pleasant, they have 10 times the amount (sprays) of any aerosol sprays that cost nearly as much.  </li>
      <li>and you will smell too strong if you don&#x27;t go easy with it.  </li>
      <li>OTHERWISE IT&#x27;S TOO STRONG.</li>
      <li>I highly reccomend this product it makes you smell fresh and great</li>
      <li>Best scent from the Bod brand is definitely black.</li>
      <li>Good smell, Lasts long, Inexpensive for so kind value</li>
      <li>Its very light but powerful.</li>
      <li>I am a 400 pound MAN and so many ladys have come and asked what it is that makes me smell so fresh.......</li>
      <li>PARFUMS de COEUR also confirmed that Bod man products do not have any animal derivatives.</li>
      <li>looking to smell cheap?</li>
      <li>anyway it is so cheap if you need to keep applying it.</li>
      <li>Since I like the fragrance I feel comfortable wearing it.</li>
      <li>This is by far my favorite cologne!</li>
      <li>I love the fragrance but the spray is to much when you use it.</li>
      <li>No disappointment whatsoever.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>The fragrance is nice, but fades by the time you&#x27;ve left the house and gotten in your car.</li>
      <li>If you are a regular working guy who wants to smell good and not spend $50 a bottle you can get 5 or 6 bottles of bod for the price of one brand named fragrance.</li>
      <li>This is worth it.</li>
      <li>, right?</li>
      <li>I was banging 10/10 elbows just right.  </li>
      <li>I went from working at McDonalds slapping buns to being a 10k a day ceo slapping 10/10 elbows just right buns.  </li>
      <li>An amazing fragrance that lasts extremely long.</li>
      <li>I like it very Much.</li>
      <li>smells very much like Armani Code.</li>
      <li>BodMan isn&#x27;t an apt enough name for this particular brand of body spray.  </li>
      <li>Smell is ok especially if you work out at the gym, will keep you from stanking of sweat.</li>
      <li>Use of this product does not eliminate the need for a hot shower.</li>
      <li>Different and refreshing.</li>
      <li>Dont miss out on these products with the funny name of BOD....</li>
      <li>Its a personal thing so that&#x27;s why the one star for the most part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Better price then the local drug stores.</li>
      <li>If you use body sprays after showering, these products are far superior to the spray on types that are so widely advertised.  </li>
      <li>I was at first a skeptical hippo about this brand of cologne, I&#x27;ve never had any good experiences with the cheap ones from Ross</li>
      <li>IT SPRAYS OUT TOO MUCH FRAGRANCE</li>
      <li>and you can spray too much.</li>
      <li>It smells like you: the real deal.   </li>
      <li>SO YEAH IT ENCOURAGES TOO MUCH PDA...</li>
      <li>I mean good.  </li>
      <li>BOD is potent, but smells good if sprayed moderately (1 or 2 sprays  for big bottle 2 or 3 for small bottle).</li>
      <li>RobotDeathSquad was trying to aware all the other miscers about this cheap phenomenon of a men&#x27;s perfume.  </li>
      <li>It is very subtle -- but, a very effective lady magnet .  </li>
      <li>Depending on the person you may have to spray more or less.    </li>
      <li>Black exudes an essence of confidence, charm, authoritativeness and (when appropriate) professionalism.   </li>
      <li>Just a couple of sprays and you&#x27;re good for the night, seeing as how a little goes a long way.</li>
      <li>No hard feelings to the seller</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m looking forward to trying their new fragrance Freshest Cleanest.     </li>
      <li>but you gave to be careful because it comes out pretty fast</li>
      <li>It is strong, lasts forever, and is a projection \\&quot;monster\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;However, these bod sprays do have a certain \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; character which may be due to  artificial components, so you might want to try Armani code first (on your skin, and smell it over hours) as it might hold up better.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Otherwise if you LIKE the scent (kinda smells old mannish)</li>
      <li>nice odor, but a little more subtle than I expected.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Not exactly the scent. A little musty.</li>
    <li> I can not belive how many people ask we what I am wearing. I am a 400 pound MAN and so many ladys have come and asked what it is that makes me smell so fresh....... belive me this a great product........</li>
    <li> I knew this product would be great which is why I had ordered two to start with. I tried it first a few years back and then purchased a small sample pack, deciding BOD Black was my favorite. No disappointment whatsoever. I must say this though. Use of this product does not eliminate the need for a hot shower. Just because you spray this on, it doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;re clean. Spray this on immediately after drying off after a shower to maximize its effectiveness. Just a couple of sprays and you&#x27;re good for the night, seeing as how a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> A pretty good scent from BOD which resembles a lot like Giorgio Armani&#x27;s \\&quot;Armani Code\\&quot;. It actually has better longevity on my skin compared to Armani Code, but something in both colognes makes me sick of them after a while. Maybe it&#x27;s because they kinda give off a note of licorice? Not sure. Check out your local drug store and try it out, it&#x27;s a decent scent once it has dried down.</li>
    <li> I must agree with the majority of the reviewers of BOD fragrances.  You can&#x27;t beat it for 7 bucks.  I&#x27;m not a cologne expert or anything but I have owned a few \\&quot;good\\&quot; brand named fragrances over the years that I have paid 30 to $50 a bottle for a couple ounces.  I must say the bod fragrances rank right up there in my book. A couple sprays and your good all day.  Be careful with the large 8 oz. bottles because they have a really wide spray dispersal and you will smell too strong if you don&#x27;t go easy with it.  BOD is potent, but smells good if sprayed moderately (1 or 2 sprays  for big bottle 2 or 3 for small bottle). Depending on the person you may have to spray more or less.    If you are a regular working guy who wants to smell good and not spend $50 a bottle you can get 5 or 6 bottles of bod for the price of one brand named fragrance. I especially like Fresh Guy, Money, Black, Really Ripped abs, Rock Hard, Tekno in that order.  I&#x27;m looking forward to trying their new fragrance Freshest Cleanest.     Try one of these and you wont be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great product. I would recommend it to anyone.  Smells great.  Better than axe body sprays.  A must have for my fellow man.</li>
    <li> I picked this product up today for $8 and let me tall you.... This scent ( Black )beats expensive colognes such as abercrombie or hollister.... One spray keeps you good for hours! I highly reccomend this product it makes you smell fresh and great</li>
    <li> Perfect cause I stink!</li>
    <li> Specific Bod products are hard to find, however Amazon has them.  Better price then the local drug stores.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok but I like some of the others better...</li>
    <li> Not my favorite Bodman but still okay.</li>
    <li> nice odor, but a little more subtle than I expected. if you want &#x27;subtle&#x27; perhaps you will like thiwe one.</li>
    <li> looking to smell cheap? then buy this product[[ASIN:B000O1NVW4 Bod Man Black 8 oz Body Spray]]</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  BodMan isn&#x27;t an apt enough name for this particular brand of body spray.  Might I suggest \\&quot;Teenage Girl Magnet.\\&quot;  Boo-Ya-Ka-Sha!</li>
    <li> it last longer than axe spray. Awesome great smell and sometimes people ask what is it. This is by far my favorite cologne!</li>
    <li> Great Product  I like it very Much.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not as good as it said to be it should be cheaper then that, it took long before I got it I understand stand the holidays but at the end I wasn&#x27;t happy about this product. No hard feelings to the seller the product was not nice</li>
    <li> I believe this item was overhyped.  Not a fan</li>
    <li> Bod Black is a not a fragrance, it is a cover letter.   Black exudes an essence of confidence, charm, authoritativeness and (when appropriate) professionalism.   It smells like you: the real deal.   With Black, women won&#x27;t need to ask \\&quot;What qualities do you bring to the table?\\&quot;  They&#x27;ll know.</li>
    <li> I bought my son this for christmas and he loves it but you gave to be careful because it comes out pretty fast and you can spray too much.</li>
    <li> If you use body sprays after showering, these products are far superior to the spray on types that are so widely advertised.  BOD product fragrances are not just pleasant, they have 10 times the amount (sprays) of any aerosol sprays that cost nearly as much.  These ARE after shower products, not a substitute for good hygiene.</li>
    <li> Hey guys this stuff is good. I mean good.  I have never gotten so many wonderful remarks about what I am wearing.  Both men and women notice.  Dont miss out on these products with the funny name of BOD....</li>
    <li> Still work til this day!!! IJS LOL</li>
    <li> I have yet to wear this great fragrance that I don&#x27;t hear, &amp;#34;You smell good!&amp;#34;  It is very subtle -- but, a very effective lady magnet .  I have tried all of the Bod Body Sprays -- this is my favorite.  Likewise, you can&#x27;t go wrong with fresh blue musk or warrior.</li>
    <li> The fragrance is nice, but fades by the time you&#x27;ve left the house and gotten in your car.</li>
    <li> I have enjoyed this when I found it in a store some time ago then I could not find it in the store anymore and decided to find it on line if I could in which I did and that&#x27;s why I ordered it again. If you have any specials on this item I would like to know at any time so thank you and have a great day.&lt;br /&gt;JPB</li>
    <li> I was at first a skeptical hippo about this brand of cologne, I&#x27;ve never had any good experiences with the cheap ones from Ross so why here?  why now?  I was browsing the MISC one day and this ph4get named RobotDeathSquad was trying to aware all the other miscers about this cheap phenomenon of a men&#x27;s perfume.  I almost negged his 4$$ for this ph4getry.  But I curiously killed my cat and I gave it a go.  Boy, this man-musk-spray was surprisingly fan-blooming-tastic, the smell of success. I was banging 10/10 elbows just right.  I went from working at McDonalds slapping buns to being a 10k a day ceo slapping 10/10 elbows just right buns.  So I went back and repped that badboy cuz he had potential.  Seriously, very good cologne for the price.</li>
    <li> I love the fragrance but the spray is to much when you use it. I use the mini bod bottle and refill them as I go.</li>
    <li> This body spray is the best I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve been using it for two years now. Anyone who I&#x27;m around loves the smell of it. My girlfriend also loves it. I buy this in bulk all the time. The only thing is the price is a little much for a body spray but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> IT SPRAYS OUT TOO MUCH FRAGRANCE AT ONCE, MY DAD WOULD HAVE PREFERRED THE MIST TO BE FINER.IT&#x27;S AROMATIC. SMELLS GREAT. USE SPARINGLY FOR PERFECT INTENSITY AND YOU WILL BE ALRIGHT. OTHERWISE IT&#x27;S TOO STRONG. IT GOES A LONG WAY. MY PARENTS STARTED NUZZLING AFTER MY DAD PUT IT ON. MY MOM PUT ON MORE ON HIM AND THE NUZZLES AND KISSES CONTINUED. (WRETCHES) SO YEAH IT ENCOURAGES TOO MUCH PDA... OH MY GOSH...LOL</li>
    <li> This item was non usable once it came in the Spray part was cracked and leaking and the actually spray did not spray out so we had to throw it away</li>
    <li> smells very much like Armani Code. just got it for Christmas so have no clue on staying power. anyway it is so cheap if you need to keep applying it. 5 stars for smell.</li>
    <li> Shipped and received with no problems and in a timely manner. Smell is ok especially if you work out at the gym, will keep you from stanking of sweat.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;ll be five star stuff but i guess i won&#x27;t know until it gets to my house, right?</li>
    <li> Different and refreshing.</li>
    <li> Great scent. i always use it ,no matter if i am going to work or somewhere else&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;What is that you have on? It sure smells good. Since I like the fragrance I feel comfortable wearing it.</li>
    <li> Smells great! A pleasant fragrance for men for $10.99 is so Kool! Packaging is also good!</li>
    <li> Good smell, Lasts long, Inexpensive for so kind value</li>
    <li> It winds up that I am not fond of the musty note of this OR Armani code, but for those that are, this is a cheap and fairly good alternative.  It is strong, lasts forever, and is a projection \\&quot;monster\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;However, these bod sprays do have a certain \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; character which may be due to  artificial components, so you might want to try Armani code first (on your skin, and smell it over hours) as it might hold up better.  I will say that these colognes are infinitely superior to any \\&quot;Axe\\&quot; product, which will burn people&#x27;s noses from a great distance.  If your teenage son has bought into thinking that Axe will get women to chase them naked on the beach, you might transition them to this before buying them a \\&quot;real\\&quot; cologne.  Consider it scent methadone to the flat out heroin addiction of Axe stink.</li>
    <li> I bought these based on reviews here and elsewhere. I don&#x27;t like the scent. Its a personal thing so that&#x27;s why the one star for the most part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise if you LIKE the scent (kinda smells old mannish) then fine... but still consider the shipping fee!!!!</li>
    <li> Usually colognes wear out in 3-4 hours but this stuff is all day and then some. Two sprays and your good. Best scent from the Bod brand is definitely black.</li>
    <li> Great fragrance, but really, whats with the bottle?</li>
    <li> I always get lots of compliments on how good I smell. Why spend $30+ when you can spend $10 to smell good?</li>
    <li> Smells Good - The Women Love It</li>
    <li> Hard to find, but powerful.  Spray under your shirt for long-lasting, non-overwhelming scent.</li>
    <li> Todo bien!! realizo como se esperaba! sin detalles, todo en buen estado! sin embargo  recomendado con toda confianza! esperemos hacer negocios  futuro otra vez! saludos desde Venezuela.</li>
    <li> For this price.  This is worth it.</li>
    <li> buena colonia de diario o para hacer deportes, huele muy bien y algunos me han preguntado que llevo, las chicas tambi&amp;eacute;n parece gustarles</li>
    <li> After trying it on, i gotta say. I almost instantly became CEO $10k a day and gained the ability to shapeshift. Really though, great cologne.</li>
    <li> Best body spray and BOD product out there. I always get compliments on this smell especially from my girlfriend. Its very light but powerful.</li>
    <li> An amazing fragrance that lasts extremely long. PARFUMS de COEUR also confirmed that Bod man products do not have any animal derivatives.</li>
